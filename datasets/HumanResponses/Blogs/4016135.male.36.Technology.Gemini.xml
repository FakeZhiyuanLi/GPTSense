      When is a criminal not a criminal? When he's also a naturally gifted, highly recruited linebacker. His name is Willie Williams and he is an entering freshman at the University of Miami. He's also a convicted criminal. The details can be found  urlLink here.   So this guy has been arrested  10  times in the past 5 years and was on probation when he was recruited to Miami. Okay, so maybe he's paid his dues to society and has learned his lesson. Everyone deserves a second chance, or in his case, an 11th chance, right? Well, incredible as it may sound, while he was at the University of Florida on a recruiting visit, he had THREE complaints filed against him. One for hitting a man in a bar, another for hugging a woman without her consent, and another for setting off three fire extinguishers in a hotel. And this guy was just admitted to the University of Miami.  Am I the only one who sees the ridiculousness of this?? So he's one of the top high school football players in the country. Because of this, the University of Miami is willing to ignore his considerably shady past so that he can play football for them. Never mind that he's got a rap sheet that equals his football talent. Never mind that he caused all sorts of trouble on his recruiting visit. Hell, he can tackle people better than anyone else so screw all that other stuff. The U of M administration has got to have their heads up their asses if they think that this guy will suddenly become a model citizen just because they felt it in their hearts to give him a chance. Oh, and it's all gravy that he can play football. The university says that they will be watching him closely and will hold him to a higher academic standard than anyone else. Wow, how noble of them.  Here's what's going to happen. The guy is going to end up in trouble with the law again. Whether it's for burglary, for assaulting someone, or worse, for rape, it's going to happen and it's only a matter of time. He'll probably get suspended for some games, then go right back playing football while his court case is pending. Then at some point, the university will be forced to kick him off the football team and take away his scholarship. But just before that happens, he's going to declare himself eligible for the NFL draft and some sucker of a team is going to draft him in the hopes that he can be a stud linebacker for them and keep out of trouble.   The tragedy of all this is that a) letting this guy into the university denies a spot to a student-athlete who truly deserves to go based not only on athletic talent, but also on character, and b) Williams is not going to learn his lesson. Why? Because he's going to play football. Everyone is going to tell him how great he is. He's going to have his posse all around him influencing him more than any teacher, coach or counselor will. In other words, he's going to be "big man on campus" and have no incentive whatsoever to learn anything from his past and try to be a better person. The guy is a train wreck waiting to happen. As a father, it would scare the hell out of me to send my daughter to a place where someone like that could run into her at some party. Does that sound too extreme? Well don't discount it because it happens with more and more frequency these days. Think about it. How many times have we seen news stories about young women at colleges getting drunk, being slipped a drug that knocks them out, and getting raped. And the reality is that many incidents like this never get reported, so don't think this is some isolated phenomenon.  So Willie Williams, congratulations for being admitted into the University of Miami. I'm sure you'll be a stud out on the football field. Maybe you'll prove me wrong and stay out of trouble during your time there. My bet is that you won't. You'll get into trouble again because you're too too stupid and too much of a thug to know otherwise and you'll surround yourself with homies that will suck up to you and teach you all the wrong things. The university will ultimately ditch you like yesterday's meat scraps because that's what you are to them. A piece of meat. They'll kick you to the curb and move on to the next talented but troubled recruit because the pressure to win and remain a premiere college football institution is too great for them to care about what happens to a delinquent like you.  Welcome to the glitz and glamour of bigtime college football.

      I'm a San Jose Sharks season ticketholder. I've been a hockey fan since I was a little kid living in Canada, and a Sharks fan since day one of the franchise's existence in 1991. I consider hockey my favorite spectator sport over football and baseball. It's easy to since the 49ers have sucked since John York took over ownership of the team, and the SF Giants can't seem to get over the hump in the playoffs. Barry Bonds ain't getting any younger either. But I digress.   As I was saying, hockey is #1 in my mind. You can't beat the excitement or the speed of good NHL hockey. The Sharks have for about half of their existence been a pretty pathetic team. I believe they still hold the record for the worst season ever by an NHL team. Wow. We're #1! Two seasons ago, they were supposed to be a serious contender for the Stanley Cup. Instead, they crashed and burned hard. It started with several contract holdouts that dragged into the beginning of the season. Then they got off to a terrible start and never recovered. Soon, Darryl Sutter, their coach for 6 seasons, was fired. Then general manager Dean Lombardi was fired. Some popular players were traded away. To top it all off the Sharks didn't make the playoffs. It was a brutal, nightmarish season that for the first time made me question whether or not I should renew my tickets. My wife, being the voice of reason that she is, insisted vehemently that we renew. Bless her heart, it was a wise choice because last season the Sharks had their best season ever. 104 points. Pacific division title. Eliminating the hated St. Louis Blues and Colorado Avalanche in convincing fashion in the playoffs. The lone negative being elimination at the hands of the Calgary Flames, coached by their ex-coach Darryl Sutter, in the conference finals. A disappointing end to a magical season, but one that was the best I've ever experienced.   So against this background, the upcoming season is one to look forward to. The franchise has been rejuvinated under GM Doug Wilson and head coach Ron Wilson (no relation). The team is young, athletic, very talented, and poised to do great things. As Doug Wilson put it, the Sharks are about a year behind developmentally in comparison with the Tampa Bay Lightning, who won the Stanley Cup this past season.  So what's the catch? Well, the catch is that there may not be a next season. Thanks to the commissioner of the NHL, Gary Bettman, the owners and the player's union is headed for a showdown over money that could result in a player lockout. The league's collective bargaining agreement expires on September 15 and without a new one in place, there will be no hockey. Bettman talks about the league needing financial stability, which the player's union interprets as a salary cap. And they won't accept  a hard cap, like there is in football.   Now, as the average fan, it's a little hard for me to sympathize with guys who make millions of dollars. I don't doubt that the owners are losing millions of dollars, as they claim. Player salaries are getting near ridiculous levels and the NHL doesn't have the benfit of a lucrative television contract. In fact, their TV deal is downright pathetic. The revenue from TV comes to about 3 million dollars per team, which is barely enough to pay for one mid-level free agent's salary.   When the lockout comes, and it WILL come, we can essentially thank one person: NHL commissioner Gary Bettman. He's created this showdown by publically taking a hardline stance, overexpanding the league in the 90's, and doing a terrible job of promoting the game of hockey resulting in a TV deal that is a colossal joke.   It's all about the money. It was when football and baseball went on strike. As a fan, I couldn't care less. Talking about that much money is foreign to me. All I know is that posturing and lack of urgency is going to destroy whatever shred of goodwill exists between the league and the fans. That's what kills me. Both sides have known about this situation for well over a year, yet they've put off talks until essentially the last minute. Only in the past week or so have the two sides agreed to sit down and have substantial talks. Unbelievable. Major league baseball went through a strike almost 10 years ago that nearly destroyed the game. It took years and a magical run by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa for the home run record to bring fans back to the game. I fear that hockey will suffer the same thing. A long protracted lockout will do nothing but destroy goodwill with the fans. Many may not return and it'll take years to rebuild what gets ruined. All because a bunch of rich guys couldn't get their acts together to sit down and bargain in good faith for the good of the sport.  I don't know how this will affect the Sharks. It's a shame that a team on the verge of great things will be stopped by something so ridiculous. The frustrating thing is that the fans are the ones who really get the shaft. We have no voice in the matter. All we can do is just sit back and hope the two sides can get a deal done. It's a real shame. The fans are what drives the league. Too bad all these rich guys can't see that.

      I love my wife. She is an absolute sweetheart. Yet there are things about her that scare me, like her eating habits. She's a petite woman at just a hair under 5 feet. What's unusual is that she eats about as much as it would take to sustain a small bird. Me, I start to hallucinate if I miss a meal. Going to buffet places is out of the question because in that scenario, the house wins with her. I'll stuff myself so that I can feel like I got my money's worth. Because there is such a disparity in the amount of food we eat at meal times, whenever we go out to eat, her favorite tactic is to suggest that we order something to share. She'll skip meals at work because she is too busy. Okay, I've done that a few times. Yet she does it with disturbing regularity. She'll also skip meals if she is too tired. Hmmm, maybe you're too tired because YOU HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING. Now when she does eat, sometimes it'll be a hearty meal like a cup of yogurt, or a few stalks of celery and a scoop of peanut butter. I'm sorry but that's not a full meal. That's a snack. When she was pregnant, it scared me that she might skip meals, which is not exactly healthy for the baby.   I don't know how she does it. With the volume of food she eats, she should be about 50 pounds and built like an anorexic Olsen sister. Maybe I shouldn't worry about it. After all her weight seems fine. Me, I'll just keep feeding my fat ass to keep from passing out.

      Last week, I saw The Last Samurai on DVD. Good film. Not great, just good. To balance out the seriousness of that movie, last night I decided to watch one of the great icons in American cinema: Showgirls.  Almost everyone has a guilty pleasure and mine is Showgirls (and Hudson Hawk, but that's another story). I don't really know why. Yeah it has enough T and A to desensitize even the horniest teenage boy. Maybe it's because Showgirls is one of the most ridiculous, brash, loud, obnoxious, and vulgar movies ever released. It's so bad it's good.  I already own the original DVD release that came out several years ago. It's a decent disc, but it's pretty light on special features (other than the wall to wall nudity) and the video is non-anamorphic widescreen, so viewing it on a widescreen TV isn't all that great. So, I was pretty excited several months ago when I heard that there would be a special edition coming out. Not JUST a special edition, but a VIP special edition. I was getting horny just thinking about it. Not only would it come with the movie remastered in glorious anamorphic widescreen video, it would also include some sweet goodies like a couple of shot glasses, a deck of playing cards, some glossy picture cards that double as drinking game instructions, a blindfold, a couple of tassled pasties, and a poster of the spunky hero Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) with which you can play pin the pasties on the stripper, er dancer. All that for the low, low price of $29.99. I am SO there. Anyhow, this cinematic treasure was in-store yesterday (July 27) and of course I headed to the local Best Buy to pick it up. Yes, I actually bought it and wasn't ashamed to be seen carrying it up to the cashier.  Cracking open the package at home later that evening, my wife was floored that I would buy Showgirls again, othwise know as double-dipping.   "But honey, it's a SPECIAL EDITION with REMASTERED VIDEO! And look at all the cool stuff you get! Pasties!!!"  Okay, so she was less than impressed. Actually, she seemed more interested in playing with the baby. I guess Showgirls is one of those things that women just don't get, unless they're an actual Vegas showgirl or a stripper or a lesbian...or a combination of all three.  Okay, suffice to say I would be watching the movie by myself. I settled down late in the evening in anticipation of the spectacle I was about to re-live. Now for those people out there who haven't seen Showgirls, and there are a LOT of you, the plot is deceptively simple. It's a rags to riches to rags story about a young ambitious girl who wants to be a star in the garish glare of Las Vegas. Ah, but there's more than that. The movie also includes: endless, relentless full frontal nudity, lesbian kisses, revenge, dancing (if you can call it that), glitz, glamour, a brutal gang rape, stripping, lap dancing, a sex scene in a swimming pool that has to be seen to believed. Hell, it even has a scene with  TRAINED MONKEYS . My wife and I have this running joke that if a movie has any sort of scene with chickens in it, the movie has to be good. Chickens are one thing, but having trained monkeys in a movie takes it straight into the stratosphere of movie greatness. Trust me on this.  Watching Showgirls, one has to acknowledge the special effort put forth by Elizabeth Berkley as Nomi Malone, our mercurial stripper turned "dancer". Before Showgirls, I knew about Berkley from the old kids show, Saved by the Bell. She was pretty cute on that show, but in a wholesome sort of way. From what I recall reading just before the release of Showgirls, Berkley really wanted to re-invent her image as something other than the cute Saved by the Bell chick. Oh boy did she ever. To describe her acting in the movie to someone who has never seen it before is pretty straightforward. It's angry acting. Every movement, every line, every smile, every dance step is done with NO subtlety at all. Just watch her dance moves. Every movement is accompanied by an angry grunt. Unhh!! Ugh!! Agh!! It's like being given the most aggressive lap dance you've ever had, not that I've ever done anything like that (ha!). The infamous sex scene in the pool deserves special mention. Berkley gets it on with Kyle MacLachlan in a way I can only describe as a dolphin with an epileptic seizure. I swear, she was thrashing around so hard it looked like someone had just hooked her, reeled her into shore, and needed to release her...QUICK.  It's interesting that a movie like this really should have destroyed the careers of all those involved, yet for the most part all the major players seemed to have moved on with their careers. Paul Verhoeven, who fought tooth and nail to get Showgirls made, went on to do Starship Troopers and Hollow Man. Not the best track record, but at least it's work. Kyle MacLachlan went on to do mostly TV stuff. Gina Gershon went on to do many other movies including the excellent Bound, directed by the Wachowski brothers, before they hit it big with the Matrix. Poor Elizabeth Berkley. She went on  star in a bunch of movies no one has ever heard of let alone seen, with the exception of Curse of the Jade Scorpion, the Woody Allen movie people may have heard of but nobody saw. The one guy who seems to have gone down the toilet career-wise is Joe Eszterhas who wrote the screenplay for Showgirls. I guess Hollywood didn't exactly agree with Joe's ideas of what is erotic in movies. It must be hard being a mysoginistic, sexist, woman-hating bastard writer in Hollywood.  One final mention about the Showgirls DVD. I actually started out watching it with the regular audio track (in glorious Dolby Digital 5.1 sound). About 45 minutes into it, I was curious about the audio commentary track included so I switched over to it. Unfortunately, the commentary was not done by Paul Verhoeven or Joe Eszterhas. A pity really. I would have loved to hear their serious take on their masterpiece. Instead, the commentary track is done by some writer/uber-fan of the movie. What makes it enjoyable though is that the guy throws out comments and one-liners that make it sound like an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. There's some great funny stuff in the commentary and it makes an already classic movie even more enjoyable.  So at 2am after finishing the Showgirls spectacle, I sat there wondering what was it about that movie that I like so much. I won't deny that there is a certain naughty appeal about seeing all that boob action, and Elizabeth Berkley's acting is so over the top you can't help but watch in that horrible train wreck sort of way. I guess I like Showgirls because it's made so badly that I'm constantly amazed that it takes itself so seriously. It's unintentionally funny. I do understand the serious moral and societal themes that Verhoeven was trying to address, but I just can't help but laugh at him and his pompous attempts at social commentary. I think there should be a  lesson in film school where you're taught that serious dramatic themes should never be utterly obscured by an endless barrage of T and A. Of course, how can you not like  a movie with the classic line, "Must be weird not to have guys cum on you". That, my friends, is quality screenwriting.  I just hope my daughter never gets any crazy ideas about running away to Vegas to become a showgirl.

      The internet is such a wonderful thing.   One of the coolest things about the 'net is that you can meet just about anyone online. Whether by instant messaging, messageboards, newsgroups, or heck, even online dating services, you meet all kinds of folks. For the most part people are nice and come across as half way intelligent. Then, there are the people out there who really should not be allowed anywhere near a computer. These are the people who, when you encounter them, you just have to say to yourself, "what the?".   Case in point, the ongoing message board thread here:  urlLink linky   Gone Gold is one of my favorite websites, mostly because of the messageboards. What sets the Gone Gold messageboards apart from the rest of the chaff available on the internet is that the members are generally a very informed, opinionated, but mature and civil group of people. Unlike your typical messageboard frequented by foul mouthed, juvenile little punks, acting like an ass-monkey is really looked down upon at Gone Gold. So of course, whenever one of the unwashed masses makes an appearance on Gone Gold to act like a goombah, the natives will jump all over him like hyenas to a carcass.   Here is the guy's initial post that sent the Gone Gold regulars into a frenzy:   Yall can call me U.2.K.  Here is my computer specs and short profile.  Intel Graphics Card/800x60016 or 24bit/8 Video Ram/Gateway/96Megs of ram  Real Name: Shawn Vegas/Male/22/Untouchable(yes believe it) I have 587 pc games, got xbox, n64, psx1,dreamcast, getting married dec 25th of this year, no kids, 8 baby kittens, 3 cars, business man, plan on changing the world reaaaaaaaaal soon, 12 tattoos, my fav band is: Smashing pumpkins and Dave Matthews and Stage.  Peace "W"   Let's dissect the this juicy target of opportunity, shall we?   Yall can call me U.2.K.  - Anyone who appoints themselves an acronym deserves to be drawn and quartered. Oh, and I'm still trying to find "Yall" in the dictionary. Maybe I should try the official ghetto/redneck dictionary.   Intel Graphics Card/800x60016 or 24bit/8 Video Ram/Gateway/96Megs of ram  - Dude, those are computer specs I would not be sharing with the world. With that kind of "power" you should be able to run Myst with no problem.   Real Name: Shawn Vegas/Male/22/Untouchable(yes believe it) I have 587 pc games, got xbox, n64, psx1,dreamcast, getting married dec 25th of this year, no kids, 8 baby kittens, 3 cars, business man, plan on changing the world reaaaaaaaaal soon, 12 tattoos, my fav band is: Smashing pumpkins and Dave Matthews and Stage.  - Oh lord, where do I start? Shawn is UNTOUCHABLE. Cue up "Can't Touch This" by MC Hammer. Yeah BOYYYYYYYYY!!!  I won't even ask about the kind of woman who is going to marry this guy, and if they decide to breed, yikes.  He's a businessman who plans on changing the world "reaaaaaaaaal soon". On another gaming messageboard, this guy posted a crazy plan about developing hundreds of Sega Dreamcast games by hiring a ton of people to do the work. Never mind that a) the Dreamcast is an obsolete game console that Sega abandoned almost four years ago, and b) all but the most hardcore gamers have either buried in the attic, sold or given away, or tossed in the local landfill their beloved Dreamcast. Now, if that's not changing the world, I don't know what is.  So, back to the messageboard thread in question, by posting this little introduction, our man Shawn opened himself to the most meciless barrage of abuse ever seen on Gone Gold. I mean, if you're going to leave yourself open as the butt of everyone's jokes, might as well leave an opening wide enough to fly a 747 through, right? Now, I know some people may see this and think that people are being mean ,or that I (gasp) am being mean. Hey, if you're going to show up out of nowhere, stand at the top of the hill and yell "Whassup Homies!!" in a place where this is clearly not the usual type of correspondence, well, you get what you pay for. The best part is that unlike a troll who will just post something and then disappear forever, the guy comes back several times to provide even more juicy targets for people to throw bombs at.  Anyhow, read the entire message thread for some hilarious posts. Poor Shawn never knew what hit him.

      The things I do for concert tickets.  My buddy Kennedy and I are Yes fans. You know Yes. The aging progressive rock band who have been around since the dawn of time and who tour relentlessly to the enjoyment of their faithful fan base. It seems like only yesterday that we saw them in San Jose. Come to think of it, it was almost yesterday. April if I recall correctly.  So, Yes is coming back to the Bay Area on Sept. 17 at the Concord Pavilion. Great. We'll get tickets. Now, if you've ever purchased tickets online, you usually deal with either Ticketmaster or Tickets.com (the old Bass Tickets outfit). Neither is a great experience. The Ticketmaster website works for the most part, even when they're being bombarded by people buying tickets. Tickets.com less so, but still not that bad. With either, you end up paying the "convenience fee" which seems more like extortion. I've never had problems with Ticketmaster or Tickets.com although I always grumble about how much the "convenience fees" are.  Now Yes, being the type of band that is so devoted to their faithful fans, have partnered with an outfit called FanFire to sell special ticket packages for the latest Yes tour. Kennedy and I are interested in the lowest cost package, regally named the Bronze package. Each ticket is around $90. Kind of expensive but hey, we're fans. The other packages include other stuff like t-shirts and something about being able to meet the band in person. Of course, the prices are out of this world too. Sorry, but the thought of meeting the band while surrounded by some of the more scary hardcore Yes fans is something I will pass on. Watching overweight 40-ish women wearing spandex pants and t-shirts airbrushed with pictures of the band hitting on Chris Squire scares me. The image of Squire in spandex alone is enough.  So, the tickets went on sale today at 11am sharp. I figured that the site will be slow since everyone will be trying to buy their tickets online at the same time. What I didn't figure is that it would be really slow. Painfully slow. So slow that it timed out to an error page TWICE during my transaction. The second time, when it was trying to process the credit card information. On top of that wonderful experience, you are not allowed to select how many tickets you want to buy. You're allowed to buy two and only two at a time. Kind of sucks if you want to buy three tickets. Now here's the kicker. At no time during the entire process do you find out where your seats are. We could be in row 6. We could be in row 30, but we won't know until the tickets are delivered and in my hands. You buy them and if you don't like the seat location for whatever reason, tough luck. There's always eBay.  In an age where online commerce is so commonplace, it's amazing to me that there are still outfits doing business online that emulate what it was like in 1997. FanFire must have their website running on a Pentium II running Windows95 ,with an ISDN line.  Here's a thought: try using modern servers and provide ample bandwidth so that customers don't bust a gut trying to buy something on your woeful system.  I never thought I would ever say this, but I appreciate Ticketmaster now.

      I hate it when I can't sleep. Here it is 3:30 am and I'm wide awake.   Sleep is a foreign concept these days. Anyone who is a parent can relate. For all the cuteness a baby shows you, there is the flip side of caring for an infant. Well aside from the constant drooling, the endless diaper changes, the crying, the fussing, the frequent feedings...where was I. Oh yeah, so babies pretty much just eat, poop and sleep. The sleep part is the tricky thing because unlike adults and older children for that matter, babies wake up in the middle of the night. Right now, my girl Sabrina is waking once during the night, usually around 2 am. Then again at 6 am. I am not a morning person at all so these interruptions are tough. You're sleeping when all of a sudden you hear the baby crying over the monitor. It's a sensation not unlike getting a bucket of cold water thrown on you. So you jump out of bed and stumble your way to the baby's room. Change the diaper full of pee, or toxic poo if you're really lucky. Go downstairs to make some formula. Return to the baby's room and settle in for the feeding. Half an hour later, you're pretty much awake. You put the baby back in the crib and shuffle your way back into bed.   My problem is that I either just stay up all the way to 2 am and the kid's feeding session. Or, I go to sleep early, wake up at 2, do the routine, and then can't fall back asleep. It's maddening. When the baby is newborn, it's even worse. The first month of the baby's life, it wakes up every 2 or 3 hours. Now, that was a tough road. I know this happens to a lot of parents, but there was a time after a couple of weeks where I literally had a breakdown. You are sleep deprived for so long that it starts to really affect your mental state. When you're expecting a child, all your friends who already have kids pretty much tell you the same thing. Get all the sleep you can before the baby arrives because once it's here, you'll never be able to sleep well until the kid is 18 and off to college. Joy.  Of course, poetic justice being what it is, the evening/morning I write this, the baby has, so far, slept through the night. And here I am unable to sleep.  As long as I'm talking about what parents should expect, parents-to-be, like my brother in law Kenji and his wife Bonnie, should know about some things:  1. If you want to travel, do it before the baby is born, because once the little squirt is home, the only travelling you do is to the store to buy diapers and formula. If you do travel as a couple, flying is cool now because you can use the pregnant wife as an excuse to preboard before the rest of the travelling masses.   2. For some unknown reason, everyone tells you to make sure you take a Lamaze class. Yet, during the actual birth, no one ever uses the Lamaze technique. Save yourself the money and bail on Lamaze. Take a childbirth preparation class instead.   3. Don't spend too much money on baby clothes. Why? Because everybody and their mother will be giving you baby clothes as a present. Also, infants grow out of their clothes incredibly fast. If you have too much, the baby may wear a given outfit literally once before he/she can't fit in it any longer. That being said, buying baby clothes is a blast. There are so many cute outfits to dress the baby in, especially for little girls.  4. After the baby is born, don't wait until the day you leave the hospital to learn how to install the baby car seat. Seems like a no-brainer, but it happens a lot. Those seats are not easy to figure out in a couple of minutes.  5. Here's a mystifying phenomenon. After the baby is born, it seems to get harder to communicate with your wife/husband. Everything concerning the baby becomes a big production that requires in-depth discussion. Guy will be guys and just kind of assume things, while the women have to practically chair a Congressional hearing on stuff.  6. If you are lucky enough to have family and relatives who offer to take care of the baby, NEVER turn down that offer. That allows mom and dad to go do other stuff without worrying about bringing the baby. Believe me. New parents NEED to occasionally take a short break for themselves. See a movie. Go shopping. Go to the beach. Anything to get your mind focused on something other than the baby.  I'm sure there's more, but incredibly enough, I'm getting sleepy. Time to climb into bed...

      Anyone who knows me knows that I LOVE movies. All sorts of movies. My DVD collection rivals ANY video store. It's been so long since I actually counted how many titles I have, but it has to be over 2000. I haven't stepped foot in a Blockbuster Video in something like 6 years, and I cut up my Blockbuster card years ago. Ironically, I go to very few movies in the theater. Partly because it's not possible with a baby in our lives, but also because it is so freaking expensive for two adults to go to the movies. Let's figure this out. A matinee show is $7 a ticket, so $14 for two. Then add popcorn for $4. Then a drink for $3. Maybe some candy for another $3. So two people will cost around $24. On top of that you get the privilege of getting in a car, driving to the theater, finding a parking spot and dealing with the crowds. Then during the movie, you may experience loud obnoxious people, cell phones, loud obnoxious people ON the cell phones, screaming kids, idiots who kick the back of your seat. You get the idea. Now you know why I have over 2000 DVDs. For the $24 you spend at the theater, you can buy the DVD, sit in the comfort of your own home and not worry about the BS of theaters. Of course it helps to have a home theater setup. I find that with a 50" widescreen TV, a good Dolby Digital receiver and a good progressive scan DVD player, you can pretty much approximate the good things about going to the movies.  Speaking of which, I FINALLY saw Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai. It's been one of those titles sitting in my "to watch" pile for what seems like forever. I like Tom Cruise (I feel the need. The need for speed!). I also like Japanese history and culture. So, Last Samurai is right up my alley. Very interesting movie. ALMOST too corny for its own good. I'm sure some people felt it was. It has a very romanticized view of the old world vs. the new world. What clunkiness the plot exhibited, it made up for with the spectacular cinematography. This is a BEAUTIFULLY shot film. The Japanese countryside is gorgeous and makes me want to move there and be a farmer. The whole story revolves around one man's (Cruise) journey from shattered, disillusioned Civil War "hero" to someone who discovers the harmony and beauty of life in rural Japan. It also is a portrait of Japan during the Meiiji era where the entire country struggled with its identity. On the one hand, Japan has followed the Samurai code for thousands of years. Now, it wants to join the industrial powers of the world which mean incorporating Western ideas and technology, often in direct contrast with the old ways.  So while the movie is good overall, some things bothered me. We have yet another movie set in a distant land telling the story of other cultures, yet the film centers around a white male. Once, just once, it would be nice to see a film like this center around a hero who isn't your usual white dude. You have movies like Shogun, Come See the Paradise, Thousand Pieces of Gold. Heck, even Joy Luck Club has a white guy. The white guy always gets the hot Asian girl.   Another bothersome aspect of the Last Samurai is that our hero LIVES in the end. This after enduring a massacre of a battle where he is LITERALLY the only survivor. Actually, the main Samurai lives, but good ol' Tom helps him fulfill his honor by helping the guy commit seppuku. There is no reason why Tom Cruise's character should live. It would have made a more powerful statement if he had died with everyone else at the battlefield. I can see why he lives though. His whole purpose at the end was to finally give the Emperor a clue that he's been a right bastard selling out his country. Imagine that. A white guy showing the wimpy Japanese Emperor that he's selling his soul to the white race. The end almost spoils the rest of the movie, it was so contrived.   With all the criticisms I have of the movie, I still found Last Samurai to be very entertaining. The fight scenes and the big one sided battle at the end were technically well done. Tom Cruise was believable as our hero and Ken Watanabe as the renegade Samurai is excellent. I can see why he was nominated for an Academy Award. His role was unique in that he played a very masculine, powerful Asian male. A rarity in big budget Hollywood movies. The lone female character, played by the singularly named Koyuki, is pretty much there as window dressing. No doubt she is stunningly beautiful, but she didn't do much beyond tending to Tom Cruise's wounds and looking off into the horizon with the doe-eyed look of a woman in need of a man for some sweet loving, which thankfully didn't happen. It's enough that Tom gets the respect and adoration of the natives, let alone get to sleep with the widow of a guy he impaled through the throat early in the movie. In any case, I digress. I liked the Last Samurai. Really. I did.  I give it 4 out of a possible 5 fishes.

      Why blog now?? Because I can. Really though, it came as a moment of inspiration motivated by the blog of one  urlLink Bill Harris . He doesn't know it, but he is my idol. A longtime poster at GoneGold.com and author of the 'Night Call', his ramblings about everything from games to vacations to his son Eli were darn near the highlight of the day for me. He also seems like the kind of guy I can sit out in the backyard and have a beer and BBQ with. Maybe if he ever sees this he'll invite me. I hope my random writings are as humorous, witty and entertaining as Bill's.  So, what's with the fishy thing? Jimmy the Fish is my screen name at the San Jose Sharks Fanhome  urlLink messageboard . It sounds vaguely mob-ish and fits in with the aquatic nature of Sharks and fish and all that. It's a lot more creative than calling myself Sharkie or god forbid, my real name. Out of all spectator sports, hockey is my favorite, and the Sharks are my team.

      Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of seeing Van Halen in concert at the San Jose Arena (I refuse to call it HP Pavilion - LAME!). As a child of the 1980's, Van Halen is one of those bands I recall fondly during my high school years. Being the deprived child I was in those days, I never got to go to any concerts, let alone a Van Halen concert. So, as the years passed and the band embarked on their spectacular downwards spiral in the 90's, I resigned myself to the notion that I would probably never see them in concert. After Sammy Hagar left the band (quit or kicked out depending on who's side you believe), and one godawful release with Gary Cherone (Extreme) as lead singer, it was clear Van Halen had seen better days. Oh sure there was the fleeting failed attempt at a reunion with David Lee Roth, as announced on the MTV music awards not too long ago. However, David Lee Roth being the egomaniacal dumbass he was, and still is, had to go and screw things up by reminding Eddie Van Halen why he was kicked out of the band in the first place. So close yet so far away.   I began reading rumors about a reunion with Sammy Hagar several months ago. Rumors became fact as the band announced the upcoming release of a two disc greatest hits collection AND a summer tour. Needless to say, I would be all over tickets for the show. I didn't care that they were nearly $100 a ticket. This was Van Halen. A band I never thought I would see in person.   So fast forward to August 10. My old high school buddy and I were really looking forward to this. Sure the band is a "little" older but this was still Van Halen. And yes, I do count the Hagar era as true Van Halen, despite what some David Lee Roth fans think. The guys did not disappoint. From the opening song, Jump, to the finale, When It's Love, it was a loud and interesting show. Sammy Hagar has a little bit of a spare tire around the old waistline, but he was running around, jumping, and working the audience like he always has. Alex Van Halen (drums) appears not to have aged one bit since 1984. He must drain his blood every night. Eddie Van Halen on the other hand, has not been treated kindly by the progress of time. He looked like the walking dead. Thin as a crack addict, he barely moved around on stage. I recall he jumped a couple of time on Jump, but that was as animated as he got. Healthwise, he's been a wreck over the years, battling throat cancer and having hip replacement surgery. Now, one would think that something as serious as throat cancer would be enough incentive to quit smoking, yet there he was smoking like there wasn't a care in the world. Luckily for him, his hands have remained intact. Eddie has, and always will be a guitar god. During his 20 minute guitar solo, he reminded everyone of this fact. Sadly though, the ravages of life as a rock and roll star appear to be taking its toll. His playing was ragged and inconsistent all night. Sure it was still vintage Eddie, but there was something that was not quite right. It's hard to describe, but his guitar playing didn't sound as clean as I expected.   Yet, in spite of the raggedness Eddie displayed and the constant reminder that these guys are all pushing 50, it was a night to remember. I fulfilled a wish I never thought I would ever see happen. To be able to hear my favorite songs live: Dreams, Poundcake, Unchained, Best of Both Worlds, Right Now, Panama, was something meaningful to me. Several times during the show, I was taken back to my high school years and reminded of some great memories. I've read some reviews of the concert in some of the local newspapers. They weren't kind. I kind of expected that. The critics saw the same things I did: Sammy Hagar dominating things so much that the rest of the band seemed to get pushed into the background, Eddie's ragged play and lack of physical energy. I didn't care though. It was still Van Halen. Maybe with a few extra miles on them, but it's the band I grew up with. Who knows what the future of the band will be after the tour is over. All I know is that for one night, I was back in high school again, and it felt great.

      My wife just sent me flowers at work. My first reaction was "what the hell?". We had a little spat this morning over something insignificant, but it was enough to put us both in a bad mood going out the door for work. So, imagine my surprise when the receptionist in the lobby called to tell me I had a delivery, and there they were. A big bouquet of flowers, in a PINK vase no less.  Now, when you send your wife/girlfriend flowers at work, you, as the guy, feel pretty cool. You're showing your woman some love and all her little work friends go "oooh" and "ahhh" over how lucky she is to be with such a sensitive and thoughtful guy.  When guys receive flowers at work, you grab them and run back to your desk in the desperate hope that no one sees you. First of all, you have to answer the nosey receptionst's questions: "Who are they from?", "What's the occasion?". Here's a question from me. How about you mind your own damn business? So, you make up some lame answer. Uhhh, they're from...my mom.   So, after ditching the receptionist, you grab the bouquet AND teddy bear (gack!) and hurry back to your desk, taking the path that you think will be best to avoid contact with anyone, which means out the front door, around the building, in the back where the loading dock is, through a back door. Luckily you don't run into your boss, or the one co-worker who has to know EVERYTHING and then proceeds to tell everyone else in the company.  You escape detection in the halls and now you're back to your desk, only there is no place to hide the flowers. Instead, you're forced to put them on the desk, partially hidden behind the computer monitor and risk the rest of the day all passers-by doing a double-take and asking you who sent them to you and what the occasion is. It's not like being able to proudly display your favorite action figure that you can bend in all sorts of manly poses. Good luck at the end of the day when you try to sneak them all the way to your car to go home. Try getting that far without being seen.   I think the wife and I have to have a little talk after work about this. Somewhere in the handbook for men, there is a rule that states:  Article 5, section 10, paragraph 4: At no time shall flowers be delivered to the man's location of employment. Penalty for such action can result in revokation of the official man card and reinstatment no more than 6 months from such time.

      Ever heard of IQ? Chances are, the answer is 'no'. Who is IQ? One of the best bands in existence, that's who. For me, every new IQ release is a major event. In my opinion, music these days is a vast wasteland of crap. Maybe it's my old age, but back in the day when I was but a boy, music in the 80's was music. Heck even the crappy stuff sounded catchy. I just don't get the music kids listen to today. Especially rap. Someone needs to explain to me the "genius" of Eminem. All I see is a white trash punk who beats up his wife and talks crap about his mom. Musical genius? Please. In any case, being a progressive rock fan is like being a dinosaur. Prog rock seems to become marginalized more and more as time passes. It won't be long when the more mainstream prog bands will literally die off. How much longer is Yes going to be around? You get the feeling that the end is near for a band like Rush. Marillion, another of my favorite bands, is less of a prog band and more of...I'm not sure what they are. They've gone off in different directions musically that it's hard to categorize what they are really. Their latest release, Marbles, does give me hope though.  Anyhow, back to IQ. I was introduced to IQ's music by my friend back in 1994 when they toured for Ever. I had no familiarity with ANY of their music other than Ever and the show we went to was a near religious experience for me. Needless to say, I went out and bought the rest of their CDs. For the most part every IQ release has been a masterpiece. The exceptions being the period of two albums when their original lead singer, Peter Nicholls, left the band in the late 80's and was replaced by Paul Menel. For two albums, the band morphed into a bizarre 80's pop band singing happy songs. It's akin to Genesis when Peter Gabriel left and was replaced by Phil Collins, only worse. Exit experimental progressive rock band, enter cheesy pop band.  So, the latest IQ CD is out and I got myself a copy. After listening to it, my impression is...meh. In my opinion, the zenith of their musical mastery was Subterranea, an epic two CD set that had so much complexity and richness, every time I listen to it I discover something new. It's THAT good. Subterranea came out in 1998. Since then, they've done some re-recordings of old stuff, some live CDs, and two new studio albums: The Seventh House, and the new one, Dark Matter. Seventh House was good. A little short but still brilliant in its own way. Sadly, Dark Matter is a different...matter altogether. First of all, it's short. For a band that regularly composes epic songs in excess of 10 minutes, a 53 minute CD is shocking. But even more shocking is the fact that the songs are boring. Sure you have an 11 minute song to start it off and an 24 minute song to end it, but overall it's the most nondescript effort IQ has ever done. There is a distinct lack of complexity in their musical arrangement and a total lack of complex harmonies. Things that IQ normally excel at. They start building on some good stuff and then cut it short. The centerpiece of the CD, a 24 minute epic song, was, for the first time that I can remember, actually boring. The soaring, dramatic instrumental segments which I love are missing and the ones that are there just don't grab me the way that they usually do.  I write this as a first impression after giving Dark Matter a good listen. Quite frankly, I'm beyond shocked. To me IQ has always been the type of band where I know that I'm going to get excellent quality, memorable songs. For the first time, they let me down. Maybe I need to listen to it some more to see if it will grow on me. I really hope it grabs me the more I listen to it, but I have a feeling that it will not. For the first time, I'm wondering if this is a hint of things to come. Is IQ washed up? Are they losing "it"? Or is this just a once in a lifetime strikeout? It's enough to make me pause and think about whether or not one of the last bastions of good progressive rock is about to go the way of the dinosaur.
