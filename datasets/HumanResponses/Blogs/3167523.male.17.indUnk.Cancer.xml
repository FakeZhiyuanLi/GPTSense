      nah that wasnt duck, gary. and please, if you need something(money, ideas, whatever) please dont hesitate to ask me. i will help you out in whatever way i can.. as for a place to stay, im sure that if you dont have a place to stay, my mom can rent out my room at her house for you. he has had many people stayin at her house before, and as long as your willing to help with th rent every month and not eat all their food, i dont doubt that she will let you live there. and i havent spent ONE SECOND in the realm of the cock so dont even fuck with me you ass-faced jew-banger! lol. im workin tonight and saturday morning, but after that, if you want to do something, give me a call.  -§ÉLÉk7å-

      You do know me silly pants!!! And as of getting married, #1 Although we have met, I am sorry to say that I don't know you  that  well... # 2 perhaps in the future, if you are not threatened by comments such as "mr wheat, marry my girlfriend and i will eat you." then we might be able to consider it.  As of now, I think the answer is no. Sorry. Good news all, tomorrow is Friday, and then that means 3 days of no schools! :oD!! PEACE!

      sorry bra, i was confused--good for u tho, hope that whole vagina thing works out for ya, with all of your experiences lying in the realm of cock. now was that duck trying to talk to me? honestly i dunno what the fuck hes squakin about. so life's ruff without the barn--just yesterday i put a 2D rpg in my ps2--lunar silver star story--fantastic game, but only tolerable in boredom. the thing is i have so much work to do--getting my car fixed,getting a place to live, packing all my shit, but i lack motivation. and its not like i have anyone to push me. ive always given off this image of self-sufficiency, so now when i want help i cant ask for it because it dissassembles everything ive worked for. i always thought myself to be one of foresight, and in a very shallow way i am--i often kno what to do in the morning if i want to achieve happiness later in the day but thats about as far ahead as i can look.  o well, elixirs tonite and tomarrow evol intents playing at element so everythings cool.

      ...seriously, im desperate and lonely...stop laughing! im dying inside!...eh, forget it. what have i gotten myself into? as if having my own weblog, where i could seek pity from complete strangers with equally pathetic lives wasn't sad enough, here i am battling wits with the only person ive ever known to have taken a wet plunger to the face, warding off the inane babblings of a chappelle-posessed half-wit with the voice of a woodland fowl, and proposing marriage to a someone ive never met who may or may not have a vagina...if this were a glass of fruit-juice we would be the soaking pulp at the bottom, and i the fattest chunk.

      Hi Y'all. I'm Jenny, not to be confused with Steve's Bitch. (lets see how well that goes over) Anyways, I was forced to delete my first intentional entry because someone didnt like that, not to name names... And to who ever Duck-O is, you should obviously talk to me, because I am apparently the only one in this "interactive shit" that has a vagina. :o)  Peace   P.S.  Hows that for a title? Sucka

      sigh. once again i have been dumbfounded by gary wheat's endless slur of words that i dont understand. fuck you. thats all i can say. i must tell you, that when i read the line about the plasma grenade, i started laughing so hard that i began to cry. that had to be the FUNNIEST fuckin thing iv ever heard in my short, plotless life. thank you sir. and may the better man win. my balls should drop in a week or so.  i present the award to gary wheat, for the funniest fuckin thing iv ever heard.   -§ÉLÉk7å-

      whoopdi-shit. i passed my drivers test. i guess i dont hate the dmv as much as i though i did lol. anyways. i should be getting a car soon. that way other people dont need to cart my ass all over the place. i got a job too. yyup, thats right. im moving up in the world. i got a job at a restaurant just down the street from me. i make 5.25 an hour under the table with at least 25 in tips every time i work. i am a happy happy boy. and when gee got busted, a picture of me smoking a cigarette was on his dads camera. lol, i am anxiously awaiting a bitch-session the next time i venture into the depths of avon. oh well. -§ÉLÉk7å-

      So my parents found out im not the godsend they once thought, but a raving, smoking drunk. So now im a stranger in my own house and i hate it. I need to get out quick. I need a real life. So much of my stress comes from my parents, but once im out so much of it will come from money--or my lack thereof.  All i want rite now is to make some decent money and pursue my DJing and music production. But its hard to work on the extra things in life when all the important things are falling apart.

      hello, this is §ÉLÉk7å.(steve mccorry). attention friends of me. this is a blog that i have created for the purpose of multi-user ranting and raving. i will give a select few of you the passoword so that you may add your thoughts or feelings. Rather than each of us having an individual site for this shit i have decided that a forum style blog would be a nice way to share thoughts and ideas. if you have any questions or concerns please contact me at theresbeerhere@hotmail.com   thank you. -§ÉLÉk7å-

      yeah, the site is gonna be awesome. a friend of mine(the php programmer) is now making a shout box. a shout box is a section of the site where there is a text bar to type in, you type..add it...and it pops up in the chat. it keeps on re-updating itself everytime you refresh. it is going to be very similar to the degolburg square in lotgd.net  this should all be done by tomorrow or the day after. me and a friend have been slaving over the flash nav bar on the site. it looks fuckin sweet. and gary, the ideas(as far as the comic itself goes)remain the same.except i liked your idea of making it a community comic. there is still the process of creating characters and a story-line. if you have any ideas, i leave this partly up to you. i would like to keep tick and gee though. things are looking pretty good for the comic this time. i now have people involved who know what the hell they are doing. and better news...my friend murph(the php dude) is letting me house his server at my place. so not only will we have a kick-ass site...it will be on our own server with our own band-width. no more of that angelfire shit. good times. -§elekta-

      ah yes. i can see that this blog has grown substantially. i want to thank everyone for posting so frequently. that aside.  most of you know that i had a pitiful excuse for a webcomic up and running a little while ago. well...its down, and a new comic is in the making. foolish? yes. but this time,i have help. plus i know someone who is fluent in php prgramming. so, there will be a forum on the site not so different from blogger. members will be able to update posts and profiles, and comment on that days comic. i have gained more knowledge on how to build web-sites, and how to plan a biweekly comic. if anyone would like to help, please email me.  the new site url is www.angelfire.com/ill/selekta     it will be moved to a domain once the page templates are finished. gary, if you are still interested in drawing or writing for this comic, please, for the love of god, step forward and offer your mad skills to me. arigato.

      If sleep is for the weak, then I must be the weakest person ever, because I slept from 5pm on Friday to 6am on Saturday, and then was still tired.  I dont know what time I went to bed on Saturday, but I think I woke up around 9:30? And then last night I went to bed at like 12:30 only to be dragged out of bed at 9:30-ish again. AND TRUST ME IF I DONT HAVE SCHOOL TODAY THIS DAY IS DEVOUTED TO SLEEP! Seriously, I think that should have nap time at school, like they did in like preschool and kindergarten, Im sure it would make alot of people happier, I know I would be.
