      This is a handy guide to posting images using  urlLink Picasa  and  urlLink Hello .  It may seem intimidating at first, but posting pics is actually really easy after you've done it once or twice. First you need to download both of the above programs and install them on your computer. Picasa is kind of a digital photo album program, the first time you run it, it will search your hard drive and organize all of your pics for you (be careful, deleting a pic in Picasa will delete it from your drive as well!).   urlLink    Screenshot 1:  Picasa Main Window  urlLink     Once you finally open up Picasa, you probably should play around with it a bit and get used to the interface. To send a picture from one of the albums to the blog, click on the picture you want to send and then click on "Send Hello" in the lower right hand corner. This will open up Hello... Hello will ask you to register for an account (if you don't have one already). Once you login, Hello should automatically take you to the screenshot below:   urlLink    Screenshot 2: Choosing BloggerBot in Hello  urlLink     Select "BloggerBot" and "Send" to upload the pic you selected earlier in Picasa. The program should then bring you to the following screen:   urlLink    Screenshot 3: Sending using Hello  urlLink     Make sure that under the Blogger Menu (see last screenshot) "*U of U Friends*" is selected, and type a caption in the lower right box. Then click "Publish". If all goes well, your picture will be directly uploaded to the blog.  I haven't quite figured out how to publish multiple pictures to the same post (without some editing work by hand), if and when I do I'll post a detailed howto here.

      I think *U of U Friends* is a functional name, but kinda lame. What do you all think? We can change the site name and address to whatever the majority thinks sounds best, please leave some comments and then we'll have at some point we'll take a group vote.

      Hey, it's really nice being home! For the first week of my glorious vacation, I've pretty much been a lazy bum. We had a computer gaming party last weekend for about 14 hours straight, and my sister and baby are doing very well (the baby has grown a ton! see the pics below). I'm playing a lot of  urlLink Final Fantasy X-2  just to past the time (thanks Raymond), I think I'm about 1/4 the way finished... it's like playing a fantasy version of Charlie's Angels with the girls running around in skimpy outfits. :D Anyway hope everyone else is doing well and no one misses me tooooo much. Right now, I can't believe I'll be returning to the U in another week and a half!

      Saturday we tried to go to  urlLink Thai Siam  for some lunch... however when we got there, the restaurant was closed early (on a Saturday afternoon?) so we decided to come back later and try our luck at getting some dinner... finally FINALLY they were open at 6 and we got to eat before running over to the  urlLink Gateway  to see M. Knight Shyamalan's  urlLink "The Village" . I was tired from finals and so on and I fell asleep about halfway through the show - Raymond and Tomoko seemed very freaked out afterwards and there were lots of screams from the audience so it must have been pretty good. :)   urlLink    Raymond and the food of the gods ("Guay-Teaw Pad Kee Mao" or the "Drunken Noodles")... notice the insane amount of red pepper!  urlLink                   urlLink    We also got the food... soooo good!  urlLink      urlLink    Close-up  urlLink      urlLink    At the movies... sorry the pic is a bit blurry it was kinda dark...  urlLink
