      I went back to work yesterday! I was kinda lost at first.  Leaving work for 4 days can do that to you.  Customers were ok.  Walang pasaway.  Only a few...  There was this couple who asked for a venti frappuccino.  I forget which frappuccino.  I asked for the name.  I said, "Can I get a name?".  It basically means that I need to get either of their names.  This was how the conversation went:  moi: Can I get a name? panget girl: FRANK foreigner guy: That's not my name! (At this point, I was looking at them with confusion) panget girl na mukhang katulong:  But she said, "Can I get   a   name?"  I suppose any name would do! (She said this with a very strong probinsyano accent) So, I got annoyed.  I am not sure if one eyebrow was raised.  I just don't trust myself sometimes... gorgeous moi:  Ok, then...Can I get   your   name instead? katulong girl: Jessie...  There! That wasn't so hard, was it?!  I don't know why it's such a big deal to some people when we ask for their names!  What they don't know is that they start to look stupid when they do that.    Anyways, it's late.  I gotta get ready for work.  I need to serve coffee to more stupid and feeling sosyal people!

      FINALLY! I got the excuse to go out today.  My mom needed fish so I went to the grocers to get fish.  I got 3 big fish!  (GRAMMAR POLICE: i remember my high school english teacher telling me that u cant say  "3 fishes" .  Because  "fishes"  is a verb.  So it's  "fish"  whether it's singular or plural) (Back to our regularly scheduled program.......) My mom taught me how to check if the fish is fresh or not.  You have to check the "hasang" if it's reddish.  If it's black, u might not want to buy it!  And, u can also check if the eyes are clear!  Otherwise, it's very, very stale!  I got home with the fish and some ingredients for another oriental dish that I want to try out.  I'm making my family guinea pigs with all these recipes that I've been trying out.  Well, so far, nobody has grown a tail or a whisker.  So I guess I'm doing pretty good with the experimentation.  Tomorrow is my big bro's birthday.  I don't wanna know how old he is because it'll only remind me of how old I'm gonna be in a few months.  Anyways, I made leche flan (custard) for him.  It's my birthday gift.  I've gone cheap again, as always!  Well, I think I'm going to buy him a new wallet.  He told me that he wanted to buy a new one but it's bad luck to buy your own wallet.  So I asked him why can't he just ask me straight out if I want to buy him a wallet.  There you go.  Now it's my problem to look for a new wallet for him come payday.  ARRRGGHHH!  I also decided to rent some videos.  I got The Runaway Bride, Waterboy, Mano Po 2 , and the latest Mandy Moore flick.  Too girly huh?  Well, I decided to get some feel good movies 'cause lately all I've been watching are Schwarzenegger films.  Oh, and Bad Boys 1 & 2.  Don't get me wrong but I just love action flicks!  Maybe my boyfriend influenced me in some way.  'Cause now I'm waiting for the new Jackie Chan movie which, according to my boyfriend, is supposed to be real good!   It's almost 11 pm here.  I gotta get some rest 'cause tomorrow's gonna be a busy day for us.  Some people will be coming over.  AND tomorrow's my last day of rest.  I'm not looking forward to it.  Although, I miss work.  But staying at home is my most favorite thing in the whole world!    Unless I'm bored...

      I slept late again last night!  I think I went to bed at 4am.  I watched TV 'til about midnight.  I was watching this feature on cybersex in exchange for a celphone prepaid card.  It was really funny.  They didn't show the girl's face but they showed her lips.  I figured she somewhat looked like this local comedienne, Zorayda Sanchez.  I'm not kidding!  She really looked like a horse!  Ok, maybe that's too mean but it's true!    I cooked lunch again today.  I grilled a fish (bangus) that's about a foot long.  I didn't do it outdoors.  I just had the stove going in the kitchen and grilled it there.  The fish was all wrapped up in foil so I couldn't see what's going on inside!  Too make a long story short, the fish was all black when I removed the foil.  This time, I was really praying to the Lord Almighty that nobody should die from the burnt fish.  Luckily, He heard my prayers.  My mom and bro are still breathing and still alive.  And my cat, who is a big fan of my cooking, ran away with the rest of the fish.  I don't know what's happened to him.  I think I hear him barking!  2 more days of this ultimate boredom.  Now my brother is annoying me with all his stories.  This is hell!!!!!!

      i took 4 days off this week.  i planned to get some rest and prob'ly hang out with my folks for a change.  now that i'm here at home, i feel like i should go out and watch a movie.  what's wrong with me? i change my mind so quickly!  my mood swings are soooo uncontrollable!    anyways, i cooked lunch today. it was pretty good.  nobody died. i believe that's a good sign.  it's ground pork with carrots and mushrooms with loads of oyster sauce and sesame oil.  it's pretty oriental.  i got the recipe from a chinese friend.  she said it's better with mayo, but i thought that it's too much for me.  i still wanna see my grand kids.    tomorrow, i'll be staying at home with my dad.  gotta look after him now after his mild stroke.  my mom and bro will be going out to do some shopping.  sometimes i think that what happened to my dad is a good thing for all of us.  my dad and i rarely talk to each other.  and now after the thing happened to him, i started talking to him. it's actually fun taking care of my dad.  it's about time the kid takes care of the father.  God really works in mysterious ways.  I remember praying to God to help me improve my relationship with my father.  I guess this is what He had in mind.  It's ok, really.  No complaints from me or from anybody in the household.    Since I'll be staying here for 4 WHOLE DAYS, i better go and rent some movies.  I'm thinking of some comedy and action!
