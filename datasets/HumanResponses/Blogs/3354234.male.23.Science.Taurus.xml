      Hey all!  So it's been a while, but we found a little library just outside of Buffalo.  The past few days have been pretty standard.  After we left Sandusky, we made it to Cleveland, which was a neat town; it reminds me of St. Louis.  From Cleveland, we went to Mentor-on-the-Lake, Then we went to Conneaut, near the Pennsylvania border.  From Conneaut, we skipped through Pennsylvania and stayed right on the border of NY and Pennsylvania.  Last night we made it to Blasdell and now we're sitting in the library waiting for Add (Ed's brother) to come pick us up.   Cleveland was nice, although we skipped out of town faster than we expected.  Originally we were going to hang out for a night, but we just wanted to get back on the road.  In Mentor-on-the-Lake, we crashed at a state park right on Lake Erie, I have some really cool pictures of the sunset which I'll post as soon as possible.  There was no camping allowed, but luckily, the park caretaker, a really nice guy named Alex, let us set up our tents in his back yard.  In the morning, his wife and daughter made us breakfast and even packed us a lunch, which was totally awesome. One of the best parts of this trip has been meeting genuinely nice people, I seem to have forgotten that such people exist.  The next day, we pedaled to Conneaut, and bushwhacked a place in another state park on the beach.  Again, more great pictures.    When we left Conneaut into Pennsylvania, we started noticing the hills start to form, although they weren't bad yet.  After a bit more pedaling, we made it just outside of North East, Pennsylvania, where I got yet another flat.  Luckily, I bought some extra tubes for my new rear wheel in Sandusky, and we made it into North East, where we met Dave Dennis, a really cool guy who owns  urlLink Lake Country Bike .  He tweaked my bike a little bit, and gave us some good advice for the road.  If you're ever in the area, I highly recommend checking out his store, it's in downtown North East. We stayed in this neat hotel outside of North East on the NY side, called the pines, which was relaxing.  The next morning, we pedalled to Buffalo (ok, Blasdell, NY, just a few miles south), NY, which is where we currently are.  New York is where the hills begin.  While they're not terribly large inclines, theres just a ton of them, and they really beat us up.  Luckily, Add, as i mentioned earlier, is on his way to pick us up.  I'm not sure if we're going to head to NYC, Toronto, or Washington DC, but we definitely can use a break.  It'll be nice to hang out and drive around for a bit. We'll be checking out Niagra Falls this evening, hopefully it won't be to hectic on the Holiday Weekend.  Hope everyone is doing well, I'll talk to you soon. -Kris

      So its been a few days, we haven't run into any convenient areas with Internet access...  Right now we're in Sandusky, Ohio (home of Cedar Point, an amusement park), on our way to Cleveland.  We've only travelled a little over 200 miles now, mostly due to inclimate weather and poor luck.  I managed to destroy my rear wheel in Florida, Ohio, and was forced to take a taxi back into Defiance, OH, to get a new one.  Then, after riding my bike back into Florida, we got caught up in a nasty storm, and had to hang out in the towns only store, a little convenience store called Miami & Erie market for a few hours.  Apparently, just east and west of us, the storm was dropping softball sized hail, but we were lucky and didn't have to deal with that.  Anyway, the new rear wheel didn't get taped up properly (bike wheels have rim tape that covers where the spokes are laced into the rim), so I was consistently getting flats.  To make things worse, the new wheel I bought only took Schraeder valve tubes, and we only packed Presta valves.  After my first flat, I was able to patch the wheel, however, after the 3rd patch, it was becoming pretty obvious that something was wrong.  Furthermore, I broke 2 of the 3 tire levers we brought installing and removing my tire so many times.  Luckily, yesterday, we ran into a retired guy named Chuck (we were trying to patch the wheel in front of his house for the better part of an hour), and he hung out with us all day and let us shower and camp out in his backyard.  He dropped us off this morning in Sandusky at the bike shop, and we got everything (I hope!) taken care of, and bought some new tubes.  Anyway, other than that, we're doing well, and hope to be in Cleveland tonight or tommorow.  We're healthy (although maybe a little homesick), and having a good time.  Talk to you soon, Kris

      Here are a few pictures from today.    Ed and I at the hotel in Huntington, just before we left. Notice the heavy, heavy bags.    A sign outside of the Monroeville Library.

      So we've made it to Monroeville, which is about 30 minutes southeast of Fort Wayne. Dave Guney dropped us off in Huntington last night, and we paid too much for a cheap hotel.  Thanks mother nature!  The weather ahead of us looks rather ominous, and weather.com says to expect T-storms for the next several days... So we're not sure what we'll be doing for the next few days.    On a lighter note,  urlLink Kyle  will be picking us up shortly (he lives in Ft. Wayne), so we won't have to sleep in the rain.  Perhaps some sushi will convince him to drive us past the nasty weather.  Now, some of you may be thinking:    "With all this driving, what's the point of taking a bike?"   Well, I'll tell you.  I start my new job on June the 7th, and we want to make it to Bar Harbor, Maine.  If you mapquest West Lafayette, IN to Bar Harbor, ME, you might notice that the distance is 1289.92 miles. The route we're taking avoids major highways, and ends up somewhere around 1400 miles.  Anyway, the point is, we'd have less than 21 days to bike 1400 miles, and catch a train / bus / ride back to Indiana, and frankly, we probably wouldn't make it to the Atlantic without, eh,  fudging  the route.  As far as Monroeville, the people here are very nice.  On the ride so far, I counted at least 4 motorists who smiled and waved at us while we were biking, and the city here actually puts up bicyclists while they're touring.  They have a system set up so the roaming biker can stop at the gas station, call the park caretaker, and be given keys to a small shelter at the pavillion; where there are apparently beds, laundry facilities, and other amenities.  While I'd be much happier staying with Kyle, it's nice to know that there are still cool people in the world.  Anyway, this is dragging on, so I'll wrap it up.  Ed says hello, and that he is too lazy to set up an account for this journal, so he's not going to chime in yet.  I've taken a few pictures that I'll be uploading when we get to Kyle's.   If you've made it this far, congratulations! -kris

      So this is our web log of the bike trip.  We're hoping to leave on Monday, the 17th (my birthday!).  I'll be putting up a few "before" pictures as soon as the rest of our gear arrives (still waiting for some saddlebags, cycling socks, tires and tubes).  I'm not sure how often we'll be able to update this page, but I'm hoping to post an entry every few days or so, to let anyone know that we're still alive and how far along we are.  If you'd like to drop me an email, feel free to mail me at biketrip [atsign] supersharpshooter [dot] net.  I apologize for the incoherent formatting, but I want to keep my email from getting clogged with spam.  I suppose the next thing I'll do is post a list of the gear we're taking on the trip (as soon as we've collected all of it...).

      So Ed and I made it home, safe and sound.  I know it took me a long time to let everyone know; most of you know that I can be a real lazy-ass.  But, to make it  up to you, I also finally organized some of my favorite pictures of the trip!  You can check them out at the link below:   urlLink Bike Trip Pictures!   Also, if anyone would like large copies of the pictures, let me know and I'll email them to you.  Ultimately, the trip was awesome.  We met many awesome people, learned a little bit about ourselves and each other, saw some beautiful things and pedaled a lot.  Our final odometer reading was right around 500 miles, a pittance of our original goal; but that's okay.  It's really hard to describe the experience... it's like the inside joke you and your friends always talk about and love, but when the new guy wants to hear it, he gives you the "oh, right..." look.  Someone I love wished that I'd go on "a huge mental journey that people can't imagine going on, to have experiences that I can't properly describe to anyone simply because they weren't there, and to find myself changed."  I did, and those words describe how I feel/felt a lot better than anything I can come up with.  The riding wasn't really as hard as I thought it'd be; but it still wasn't easy.  I think we could've been putting in more milage daily, but it seemed to work out.  I will do another trip like this (hopefully many more), the sooner the better.  Now go take a look at  urlLink the pictures , write me an email or post a comment, go ride your bike, or hug/kiss/call someone you love.   thanks. Kris
