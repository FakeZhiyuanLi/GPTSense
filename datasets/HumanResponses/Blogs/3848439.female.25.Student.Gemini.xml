      As I think I've mentioned before, this summer I'm doing something called Clinical Pastoral Education, or CPE.  I'm part of a group of students acting as summer chaplains at a hospital in one of the Chicago suburbs.  So I'm on duty right now and I feel like I'm getting my "meet-and-greet-mojo" back.  For about 2 weeks, I've been sad-sacking around, feeling listless and barely able to do the minimum number of visits I'm responsible for.  But it looks like the lamentable days have passed for now.  CPE has been an amazing experience.  I still struggle with the concept of meeting up with 15+ people a day, 4 days a week.   Introverts everywhere cringe in solidarity   But, I'm getting back the strength to do it.  I'm not sure if I lost my mojo due to stress or just midpoint blahs.  But it's good to not feel like a total slack-ass at this anymore.  It's ridiculously draining to do CPE, but it's supposed to be like that.  Being at this hospital and accompanying people and friends and family on this part of their journey is an incredibly humbling experience.  I think this solidifies for me that I'm meant to be in ordained ministry, but that I'm also someday working toward a pencil-neck job.  As much as I love people and I love interaction, I think the bulk of my being will be happiest as a desk jockey.  As much as I hated getting my business degree, I still think if I had done it in management - especially non-profit - I'd be much happier with it.  I think that's my calling.  When it comes to CPE, I feel like my perfect fit would be coming up with a system of deploying chaplains at a hospital and possibly helping them process their experiences rather than being out on the floor myself.  That said, I also hope to do CPE when I take a sabbatical during my 9th year of ministry.  I think taking my 9th year off from the parish (or whatever office I'm residing in) for a sabbatical and ending it with a summer full-unit of CPE would be a good way to reflect on ministry and my call in prep for my 10th anniversary of ordination.  So, CPE sites in the summer of 2017, watch for my application to darken your doorstep.

      Last night, I finally convinced a cadre of my sem friends to witness the glory that is  urlLink "St. Elmo's Fire."   A movie written and directed by Joel Schumacher before he got schlocky and crappy.  It's early 80's Brat Pack quarter-life crisis angst at it's best.  Gladly, even after all my trumpeting of the movie, most of the folks enjoyed it.  I recommend it highly to anyone in their post-college life and trying to figure out what the hell is going on.  Heck, I just highly recommend it in general.  After watching it we realized two things: 1. If "St. Elmo's Fire" is to early 80's self-absorbed quarter-life crisis angst buddy film genre,  urlLink "Reality Bites"  is the early 90's version.  You know what that means - it's time for someone to write the one for the early 00's (naughties?)  I personally figure this one should come from a crowd of friends who just graduated from a seminary.  Honestly, there's enough angst, sex, drugs, rock & roll, and general quarter-life crisis angst to fill at least a couple seasons on HBO.  I should get crackin' and write this stuff down....  2. Everyone who starred in "St. Elmo's Fire" is now probably old enough to do the early 00's version of  urlLink "The Big Chill!"   Yeah baby!  80's movie redux - gotta love it!  Oh, and if you get the DVD version as I did, don't miss the *classic*  John Paar video "Man in Motion (St. Elmo's Fire)" in the special features section.  Damn but I miss those 80's permed mullets!

      Okay, last night I made a vast miscalculation in judgment.  I knew that I wanted to spend the evening with some friends.  So I agreed to go with them to a drum circle at a bar called  urlLink Rhythm  on the near south side of Chicago.  Big mistake.  NOTE: I  highly  recommend Rhythm to anyone looking for a neat experience.  This is *not* a slam on the bar.  Just a slam on my decision to go there on this particular night, because I didn't get to bed until 1 AM when I was already cranky from lack of sleep.  Which means I got about 5 hours of sleep before I had to get up for  urlLink CPE (Clinical Pastoral Education - a summer of hospital chaplaincy in my case)  in the morning.  Urrgh!  After getting about 5 hours of sleep the night before.  Double urrgh!  So, I basically went to this drum circle and and was one of the few people of African descent there participating in this African drumming.  Grrr! - White folks with trust funds co-opting my  general heritage so they can assuage their White liberal guilt. But I stay out and pissy until 1 AM.  I'm taking responsibility for my bad judgment.  Usually whenever I'm at one of these cultural events where I'm surrounded by folks who probably want to urge me to vote for Nader while people of all races sit and sing  "Kumbaya"  in our dashikis, the first sighting of a White Guy with Dreadlocks just sends me over the mental edge.   Too many White Folks!  Ahhhhh!   I promise you, I'm a big fan of racial unity and understanding and folks meeting and seeing eye-to-eye.  I'm all about the interracial love.  But damn it!  Can't this happen in arenas where we all are fully clothed, all my fellow females are properly bra-ed up, and no White guys are walking around declaring their beeswaxed love for Bob Marley?!?!  ================ But I also fully understand and admit that this problem is mine to own.  I'm an African-American and I don't have enough  go-to  African-American friends.  I never have.  And now since I'm doing CPE at a hospital with a tiny population of African-Americans plus I'm continuting to live on campus at a Lutheran seminary, my day to day interactions with folks of my complexion is at an all-time low.  Which means I basically need to get off my own ass and find a way to meet Black folks like me.  Trouble is, I have no blasted idea as to how to do that.  Maybe I can figure something out by the end of the summer.  Also, I need to cultivate some hobbies.  It's really important for me to get myself out of Hyde Park whenever I can.  If I don't, I'll just go stir crazy.  I think my problem is that I don't have any hobbies or interests that I pursue.  So then I get bored and campus and wait for other folks to suggest outings.  So I go out a lot - basically whenever folks invite me - but I don't really do a lot of stuff that I initiate.  I just follow other people as they pursue their hobbies and interests.  So, what hobbies can I get before the end of the summer that won't add to my stress level?  I don't know, but surely something will make itself apparent.  Or I might just have to suck it up for the summer and try to get something going in the fall.  Here's a list of ideas: - ballroom dancing - touch football - movie watching club - rock climbing (but I'd have to get into shape first) - music lessons of some sort (I'm looking at doing bluegrass banjo lessons at  urlLink The Old Town School of Folk Music  in the fall.  Yes, I know, it's a hotbed for White Guys with Dreadlocks.  I'll just have to deal with it.) - some sort of Buppie or aspiring Buppie (Black Yuppie) reading group. - martial arts  I just need to find a way to meet more fellow Negros and get my ass in gear.  Wish me luck.  Maybe I'll actually even follow through this time.

      "I generally avoid temptation unless I can't resist it." - Mae West  This is a reboot of a previous blog I kept in the months leading up to seminary.  So why keep a blog?  Why the hell not?  But mainly I just want to keep a running record of what's going through my mind.  At some point I'll post some crucial info about myself.  But for now, I'm feeling a bit shy.  Don't worry, I'll loosen up with time.

      I've used this poem I found online for several devotions.  I feel I should share it with everyone (all 2 of you) who read this blog.  One night I had a wondrous dream, One set of footprints there was seen, The footprints of my precious Lord, But mine were not along the shore.     But then some strange prints appeared, And I asked the Lord, "What have we here?" Those prints are large and round and neat, "But Lord, they are too big for feet."  "My child," He said in somber tones, "For miles I carried you along. I challenged you to walk in faith,  But you refused and made me wait."  "You disobeyed, you would not grow, The walk of faith, you would not know, So I got tired, I got fed up, And there I dropped you on your butt."  "Because in life, there comes a time, When one must fight, and one must climb, When one must rise and take a stand, Or leave their butt prints in the sand."

      I have a serious bone to pick with Tim LaHaye & Jerry Jenkins and those fool "Left Behind" books.  The previous books  might  have passed muster.  But "Glorious Appearing" looks to be a piece of jingoistic trash.   Note: I read the first book and a half, just so I could know what I'm railing against.  I haven't read any of the others, but I imagine I will check them out from the library at some point so I can speak with personal experience.  Check out this  urlLink op-ed article "Jesus and Jihad" from the New York Times  (you might have to register)

      I listen to a certain amount of Country music, both the poppy new stuff (that doesn't piss me off) and older stuff.  So I've been on a bit of a Johnny Cash kick recently.  I figured I'd listen to the actual song "Man in Black" and see what it's about, since it's such a large part of his mythos.  So, I love it.  I'm a big fan of black clergy wear myself.  If I had my druthers I'd probably wear only black clergy gear, especially outside of services at my particular church.  And I heard this song and somehow want to work it into my ordination service or afterparty in Summer 2007.  To fully appreciate the song, you have to know a bit about the man.  To learn more about the life of Johnny Cash I suggest this  urlLink article from CMT.com.   There's also this wonderful audio story from  urlLink the NPR show "This American Life."   It's in Act Three, entitled "The Greatest Love Story of the 20th Century" by Sarah Vowell.  (You'll need Real Player to listen.)  While this particular song leans a little toward the pessimistic, I think it also speaks to the prophetic role that pastors and priests are called into.  We have to make sure that folks know the world isn't operating the way God intends.  Creation is at war with itself and it's not supposed to be that way.  People don't take care of anyone - themselves or especially others.  So for your perusal, below are the lyrics to Johnny Cash's "Man in Black."  Enjoy! ============ Man In Black By: John R. Cash, © 1971 House of Cash, Inc. Recorded February 16, 1971 Number 3 - Country Charts; Number 58 - Pop Charts       Well, you wonder why I always dress in black, Why you never see bright colors on my back, And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone. Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.  I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town, I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, But is there because he's a victim of the times.  I wear the black for those who never read, Or listened to the words that Jesus said, About the road to happiness through love and charity, Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.  Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose, In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes, But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back, Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.  I wear it for the sick and lonely old, For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold, I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been, Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.  And, I wear it for the thousands who have died, Believen' that the Lord was on their side, I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died, Believen' that we all were on their side.  Well, there's things that never will be right I know, And things need changin' everywhere you go, But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right, You'll never see me wear a suit of white.  Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day, And tell the world that everything's OK, But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back, 'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black.

      I don't like Martha Stewart.  No, not solely because of her shady dealings.  The woman's a dynamo, for God's sake.  She built a company from the ground up.  Her name is a world-wide brand.  That takes some serious  ganas  my friends.  And for that I give her some major props.  But that company she built, was probably built on the broken backs of others.  She's a royal bitch by many's accounts.  Perhaps even to the extent that she might actually be one - not just accused of being one by men who feel emasculated when faced with a strong woman.  Oh well.  But she's a powerful bitch.  So there's  urlLink this article from the New York Times  (you may need to register - it's free) speculating her amount of influence on Martha Stewart Omnimedia while she *might* be serving her 5 month jail term, followed by 5 months of house confinement.  Come on folks - it's Martha Stewart Omnimedia.  So Martha, you may be a meany who almost single-handedly made North American hausefraus and gay men neurotic about the precise fold in their linen napkins and how exactly to create those homemade marshmallows for high-class smores, but I still love you.

      I just got back from some impromptu grocery shopping.  After hitting Hyde Park Produce, the 53rd Street Rip-Off…er, I mean 53rd Street Co-Op then the 47th Street Co-Op I had a great assortment of food.  I was in the midst of making  urlLink Spanakopita, Moosewood Cookbook style  (it's a baked Greek dish with spinach, feta cheese, onions, garlic, & herbs sandwiched between buttered layers of filo pastry dough - serious  yum  -age).  I had just started to mix the cheese into the spinach/onion/garlic/herbs mixture.  Then I realized I needed fruit for tomorrow’s lunch.  So I decided to make a true trip of it.  About halfway through the 53rd Street jaunt, I had a hankering for Bagels with Lox.  But not just any bagels with lox.  No, these puppies must replicate the joy of the bagel shop near my freshman dorm in college.  Bagel, cream cheese, lox, red onion rings, & capers.  Capers!  That’s what it’s all about!  I like some brine with my raw salmon.  I believe they called it the "Lake Norman." I knew I had some capers in the fridge, so I wouldn't need to buy any.  But, alas, 53rd Street didn’t have any good looking lox.  Anyway.  I also wanted turkey breakfast sausage and other random crap.  So I went up to 47th Street.  While there, I got the bagel w/lox stuff, but I also came across some pork & veggie potstickers. Yum!  And I even have a decently easy recipe here at the apartment for potsticker sauce.  I also bought a bottle spring roll sauce on a whim, but I couldn’t find frozen spring rolls.  When I’m more ambitious some weekend, I might try to make some up.  Can’t be but so hard.  They did have spring roll wrappers, so that’s probably the hardest part.  Right?  Right?!?!   ::crickets chirping in background::   Well then.  So, now the spanakopita’s done and I’ve had a semi-spectacular bagel w/lox – apparently I didn’t have capers in the fridge (blast!), so I just left off the red onions.  All or nothing with the Lake Norman special, my friends.  But I also found  urlLink mochi ice cream balls  while looking for the frozen spring rolls.   I think you can find them at  urlLink Trader Joe’s  and other places that cater to condiment-and-funky-food fiends like myself.  Wonderful stuff!

       For you so loved the unlovable That you gave the ineffable That who so believes the unbelievable Will gain the unattainable  -- "There You Go" by Aaron Tate, Sung by Caedmon's Call on the album "40 Acres"   As I write, I'm on-call at my CPE site.  I just got back from being beeped to attend to two deaths.  At first I thought it was three, but the 3rd was just a repeat of the first.  So, how am I as a hospital chaplain to attend to families who have just watched a loved one die.  The first family I had met before on my floor.  They got ping-ponged between my general medical/surgical floor and the intensive care unit (ICU) for at least the past two weeks.  They'd be on my floor for a few days, then back in ICU depending on how the family member was progressing or regressing.  I hadn't talked to the family beyond a 45-second check-in over the past week because I didn't want to make them nervous.  I find that folks, even folks of great faith, get a little antsy when faced with constant chaplain visits.  I think we all think  "How bad am I really if this pastor/priest/chaplain keeps coming by?  Aren't there other people who need her/him more?   Well, this patient just died.  The patient was surrounded by family and spouse and children.  I went up and said a few prayers.  I didn't even say as many as I meant to because I made a pause and they said "Thanks."  So I stayed for a bit.  Then moved to the second beep.  This was another person who had died.   Expired  in hospital parlance.  I had talked to the family earlier.  Even brought in the on-call priest from the local Catholic parish to administer the  urlLink Anointing of the Sick .  This patient was going to die pretty soon.  And they did.  I spoke with the family again.  One of the patient's children was being very efficient in contacting funeral homes.  The other relatives had only recently driven in to the hospital today.  They had been by last night, though.  They made it in time to be with the patient before death, so that was good.  I said a few prayers -- once again, not all the ones I intended.  Stayed for a bit and moved on.  So my questions, at what point do my prayers become ineffective as pastoral care?  These prayers I'm speaking of specifically come from the  urlLink Occasional Services  for the Lutheran Book of Worship.  I've had few occasions to use them in CPE.  But usually one of two things have happened.  1. I don't get through the entire intended rite.  I try to make a significant pause, and folks think it's done.  So I just pack it up.  2. I get all the way through it, and it feels so inadequate.  I could probably fix situation 1 by becoming more familiar with the rites.  I want to feel like we're paying significant and proper homage to the person and the event.  If the family is fine with the Lord's Prayer, I'm fine with that.  Maybe that's all that's needed.  Perhaps I can always start a rite by saying, we'll end with the Lord's Prayer and try to read the crowd as to how much prayer they're receptive to.  But part of me says, that's just me wanting to play a bigger role in their grief.  If they're people of faith, they'll be praying and prayed over a lot.  My little words, even if they were carefully chosen by a group of ELCA worship gurus, don't mean a whole lot in the grand scheme of things.  In situation 2, that feels as if it's just the inadequacy of responding to people's needs.  I still feel like I should try harder and be more open.  I don't feel as sorry for people when I'm the chaplain that shows up, but I still feel it.  These words are wonderful.  They're part of the faith proclaimed by the ancient and future church.  But they're still just words.  And I'm still just a speaker.

      That's a message I've been getting from various folks recently.  And I've been getting it from different circles of friends and associates, so I know it's dang well time to do something about it.  I  know  I'm dour.  I  know  I'm a stick in the mud.  I  know  my friends and loved ones usually have to use a crowbar to force me to talk about my feelings.  I'm a bit emotionally locked up.  So here's the deal.  Of the 4 folks reading this blog, I encourage you to challenge me to be a bit forthcoming with my emotions.  I encourage you to tell me I need to find something to actively smile about each day - even laugh if I'm feelin' really frisky and daring.  I'm sick to death of being the grimacing brick wall.  But old habits die hard and I'm cranky and cynical deep down.  But we all know it's only to the bitter candy coating to my more sensitive and feeling and romantic side.  Urgh.  Yeah.  And we fear nothing as much as those things we don't face.  So I'm facing it.  My 25th year will be better then my 24th - not that the 24th was bad, mind you.  I've fully hit my quarter-life crisis and it's time to take stock and change my path if I'm not going to end up some lonely neurotic nut job by my midlife crisis.  Hopefully I can be a friendly, engaging neurotic nut job by then.

      Yo all!  Here's the easiest charity act you'll ever do.  And you can do it every day.  Go to  urlLink The Hunger Site  and press the button that shows up in the middle of your screen.  Every day, donors pledge to give a certain amount of money/food to hunger relief efforts for every computer user who presses the button.  So do it, spread the word.  Check out the sister sites for Breast Cancer, Child Health, Rainforests, and Animal Rescue.  They're all linked, so you can get to them easily.

      I missed his speech (don't worry, I'll watch the recap tomorrow online!  Sheesh!), but I heard  urlLink Obama held his own .  Whoo-hoo!  Way to represent Illinois!  Hear that sound?  That's Ronald Reagan doing flips in his grave as son  urlLink Ron speaks to the DNC about stem cell research.   Opening quotable: "A few of you may be surprised to see someone with my last name showing up to speak at a Democratic convention. Let me assure you, I am not here to make a  urlLink political speech...."   Ha! My black rear end.  Then they trot out the 12-year-old founder of "Kids for Kerry."  A more maudlin thing I've not seen recently.  I think the leader of "Youth for Bush" will probably have to come out in a wheelchair now.  Or at least a leg brace that makes a convincing thump.   urlLink  Check out this picture  and ask yourself -  To quote my friend Mike, "Is it wise for the Heinz widow to wear a ketchup colored dress?"

       A New Hymn - by Todd Miller  Why do I not feel you all the time? Is it your fault?  Or is it mine? Close to you is where I long to be. Tell me why I feel so far from thee.  Why do I not see you all the time? Through my eyes, I find you hard to find. Should I go and seek to search another place? Tell me where oh Lord to look to find your face.  And why do I not hear you all the time? When I pray I listen for a sign - But my own voice it echoes in my heart. Tell me how to tell the two apart.  Tell me why I question all the time. Why small doubts still linger in my mind But as I seek so also shall I find For I know that you are faithful all the time.  For I know that you are faithful all the time.

       Taken from the email version of the  urlLink Moravian Daily Texts   for Monday, July 26, 2004   O Lord, my strength and my stronghold, my refuge in the day of trouble. Jeremiah 16:19  Jairus came and, when he saw Jesus, fell at his feet and begged him repeatedly, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live." So he went with him. Mark 5:22-24  Dear God, we come today to thank you and praise you for the gift of our lives - for joys and sorrows, for health and suffering, for belief and doubt. We are thankful that we can come to you with our prayers, knowing that you hear us and respond to us. Amen.

      I get the daily headlines from the NYT plopped in my email in-box each morning.  Don't think I'm all high brow or nothin'.  I usually just read the TV & movie reviews.  Besides being a blinded bastion of liberalness (anyone know a "b" word meaning liberal?) the folks at NYT have this amazing ability to endow anything they want - and honey, do I mean  anything  with enough praise & 10-cent vocabulary to make it seem like a true wonder to behold.  Case in point: Check out this  urlLink movie review  (You may have to register, but go ahead.  It's free!)  ...and it's two pages long.  Really! Heh!

      Last night, whilst on-call at the hospital, I had the rare opportunity to watch 3 AM TV.  (Yeah I watched  urlLink Cheaters.   Egads people.)  But the worst thing about 3 AM television watching is the pop culture theology that crops up.  And yes, I'm aware of the hypocricy of talking about bad theology when I'm admitting to watching Cheaters.  Go honesty!  i.e.  urlLink "Discover the Champion in You!   God help us indeed

      I've spent the last 1.5 hours online looking for info at  urlLink About Dogs - A Resource for Dog Owners and Owners-to-be.   I'm thinking a random mutt from the  urlLink  Anti-Cruelty Society  will be best.  They offer staff help in making a selection, there's an application process and adoption counseling, and my $55 fee covers (among other things) a vet exam, inoculations, some tests, fixing, and a microchip.  So, I'm also thinking about who to will the dog to should something happen to me.  Don't worry!  I'm not planning anything, just want to be prepared.  Any potential takers?

      Check out this definition of  urlLink "time porn"  from The Word Spy.  In the spirit of that phrase, when I got my new MacConnection catalogue - blasted junk mail! - I thought of a new word:  Tech porn.  Tech porn is the catelogues from OfficeMax, the gear reviews on reviews.CNET.com, the front page of the Apple website.    40 GB iPods! 5 Megapixel digital cameras! Portable LCD projectors with handheld wireless remote that reaches over 500 yards so you can wander during presentations!  I can't afford this stuff!  I don't even need this stuff!  But, sister, do I want this stuff!  I'm from a long line of gadget hounds; I can't even remember the number of PDA's and digital cameras my Dad's bought in the past 2 years.  Tech porn is a more specific subset of gadget porn.  A picture of a DLC-X Plus 20-cup capacity Cuisinart food processor in Martha Stewart Living is gadget porn.  If the processor has a Wi-Fi internet connection so you can command it to mix zucchini bread dough through the laptop you're using as you sip a light frappichino at Starbucks - that's tech porn.  And Steve Jobs is the number one pusher.

      Yeah baby!  I got the scholarship for the Bluegrass Banjo I class at  urlLink  the Old Town School of Folk Music.   Since I'm so blasted poor, I qualified for the 90% tuition help.  Thus the 8-week class will cost me ::drumroll:: a whopping $5.40!  Score!  I'm really looking forward to it.  Heck, I'd look forward to anything that only costs me $5.40 for 8-weeks of fun.  And if you're in the Chicagoland area and looking for a guitar, banjo, djembe, etc. - check out the Old Town Different Strummer Music Store's  urlLink 7th Annual Garage Sale next weekend.   I hear there are some seriously slashed prices there.

      This morning, I read this New York Times article, urlLink "Links Between Prison and AIDS Affecting Blacks Inside and Out."   I picked up the August 2004 issue of  urlLink Essence magazine  and one of the cover stories is "Do Black Men Still Want Us?"  Inside, there's an article entitled "Love Repair" with this as the first paragraph:  "The numbers are staggering: One in every five marriages will end within five years, and one in three will end within ten years, according to a 2001 report by the National Center for Health Statistics.  For Black women, the news is even more distressing.  We are less likely than White and Latina women to stay in our first marriages.  And if we remarry, those unions are also more likely than theirs to fail."  Now I've had an epiphany.  I need to stop reading these articles!  All they do is freak me out and terrify me.  This is not helpful.  Thankfully, the Love Repair article went on to give an account of the authors' (a married couple) experience in preventative marital counseling.  They went in okay and came out better.  Bully for them.  But I'm of that wonderful slant of mind that always says, "optimism for others, but pessimism for yourself."  Things will turn out great for everyone else, but I'm up the creek without a paddle.  So I've got to stop letting articles like this get me down.  I get scared and then I lose desire to act.  Perhaps I'll declare a little moratorium for myself - no new negative input on relationships is allowed to enter my head.  I can come up with a pessimistic view all by my self.

      Check it.   urlLink Lord Voldemort  has been chosen!  Whoo Hoo!  Also, I love the last couple of paragraphs: "The latest Potter film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, was still in 600-plus screens through last weekend. Since its release June 4, it has earned $244 million--the third biggest hit of the summer.   "Still, the movie is on track to gross less than 2002's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets ($262 million), which grossed less than 2001's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ($318 million).    "Wonder if Voldemort's got a spell on how to reverse a downward box-office trend."  Yeah, because  $244 Million Smackers  is just such a huuuge disappointment.

      from  urlLink http://www.freewebs.com/allentown/     What the Unmotivated Are Doing for You   Who are the unmotivated? Are they losers who just don't get it, who refuse to hold a job, or join the human rat race? The unmotivated are, in fact, people who do get it, who know it's all a scam, who refuse to be led by corporate and religious wranglers to the slaughter.  It takes great will and integrity to remain unmotivated in the face of society's constant motivational assault: Work hard, follow the rules, fulfill your potential, keep up with the Jones or the Patels, believe in this deity or that deity. Success for the vast majority of us would be achieving less than 1% of what the people behind the scams already have and want to keep us from ever having. The haves promote delayed gratification to the have-nots. You'll go to heaven when you die. You'll be able to do everything you always wanted to when you retire. The more gratification we delay the more gratification the haves enjoy today.   There is no greater struggle for the human race than to remain unmotivated. Only through lack of motivation can we crush this evil scheme that keeps us chained to our jobs, mortgages and fears. Fear is a big motivator - fear of failure, fear of being different, fear of being alone. Fear keeps us in bondage. Society provides comfort and structure, but it's a shell game, a carrot on a stick, the old bait-and-switch.   The rebellion is already taking place. It's happening with the gal in the next cubicle who is always on break, the pizza guy who never delivers a hot pie, and the customer service rep who doesn't bother acting like he cares. There will be no shot heard around the world, only the quiet but willful voices of those saying, "No thank you," to buying into the lie. These people are our heroes, not the overhyped celebrities, athletes and "stars" created by the media. Knock them off their pedestals! Better yet stop building pedestals. Why is the ability to look beautiful on TV and push hair conditioner more valuable than the ability to shovel manure from a stall? When push comes to shovel, it's all just different manure. Freedom is only an unproductive day away.    (December 2002)

      Why is life so fragile?  Why does God give us this wonderful gift of being able to feel the sun on our face, feel the wind stinging our eyes.  Why can we know the joy of feeling a love so strong and sure and right that it nearly crushes our bones with it's intensity.  And then the next moment we're alone and abandonded, every breath is a laborious task, and we cry and cry and cry and don't know what to make of ourselves.  Why is it that I can be doing rounds in a hospital and see someone one day, they're chipper in spite of the breathing tubes and IV's and various pokes and prods from someone trying to make them better.  Or even if they're not putting on the brave face, they're cranky and cantankerous and in pain and lashing out at everyone around because they're scared out of their wits and can't control anything that's going on and their family cares - or doesn't - but their attention or apathy can't do a damn thing to help you.  And then the next day, I'm saying the Commendation for the Dying over them.  Or holding their widower as he cries.  Why is life so fragile?  Why are our hearts and spirits and minds so prone to pain?  What is the good of this.  Forget all this "better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all" crap.  Shakespeare didn't know what on earth he was talking about.  Is that line any consolation at all to the woman who buries the person she thought would be her life partner and then he's gone 3 weeks after the wedding?  Or is it any consolation to the couple who celebrates their 47th wedding anniversary in the hospital and she's wondering if it's selfish to want him to live to the 48th because he's in so much pain.  And even if you live to a ripe, old age and feel relatively happy with the life you've led as you cross the bar -- there's always  always  the sighs that come with you saying to yourself, "I could have treated that person better.  I could have spent more time with this person.  I shouldn't have rushed to judgement against that person.  I shouldn't have trusted that person with as much of my heart as I did."  Sighs and tears and still no closer to an answer.  And I'm not really expecting an answer, from anyone or even from God.  I don't know what I'm expecting - other than light and dark (whatever each may symbolize) in proper, hard-to-understand measure.

      This morning, I ended up watching Fox News in the Morning on the local affiliate (not of Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly, but the station of North Shore and Trading Spouses: Meet Your New Mommy.)  Anyway, the local political pundit was saying that the name of Alan Keyes was being bandied around to run for IL Republican National Senate.  Alan Keyes?  That man's nearly had his National Negro Card nullified due to dumb behavior in public.  And no, not just because he's a Republican - Armstrong Williams and J.C. Watts are still on good terms with the voting committee at the National Negro Annual Meetings.  But most modern gansta rappers and execs at BET are in danger of losing theirs.  Alan Keyes?  And Jim Oberweis (he of the big ol' dairy) is still screaming, "Hey, I came in second in the primaries!  Where's the love?"

      "and says, 'I'm lookin' for the man who shot my paw.'"  I just returned the cat I've been kitty-sitting for the past week.  And granted, I'm not a cat person, but I'm fond of animals.  I never really had many beyond a few suicidal fish growing up.  But it was really nice having a creature around who liked me. The cat was a bit above oblivious to me, which I figure is good for a cat/person relationship.  I've wanted a dog for a while.  I prefer them to cats b/c I wish to be more than just a food source to the sucker.  I've been holding off on getting a dog because I want a large one.  Huge if possible - the size of a small car, perhaps.  But it'd be excessively cruel and really stupid to get one now as I live in a city in an apartment.  But I'm thinking.  Perhaps an older, smaller dog from a pound.  Nothing tiny and yippy.  But I really remember that Animal Society commerical from my youth, "Get an older dog.  They're cool!"  So perhaps I can look into it.  Of course, me being neurotic and all, I'm concerned that I'm just getting a dog to fight loneliness.  Perhaps I'm not truly called to have a furry pet beyond the potential vermin in the basement.  However, I think I can love a dog without luuuuving a dog.  But I'll look into it and let you all know.

      The worst part about an overnight on-call at the hospital is how it messes up my sleeping schedule for the next day or two.  Luckily, most of my on-calls recently have been on the weekend.  So I get home wired and can't sleep (even though I probably haven't had a decent amount of sleep in 36 hours).  I stay awake until mid-afternoon then take a nap.  I run around for the rest of the day, usually collapse around 10 PM.  Then I wake up around 3 AM and have trouble getting back to sleep.  So I've been trying to fill my early morning today with finding a church to worship at tomorrow.  ::sigh::  Okay, I'm Black and I'm Sacramental - rah rah Communion & Infant Baptism!  I'd really like to commune tomorrow.  I'd really like to be surrounded by Black folks while I'm doing it.  My White contact factor is a bit high these days and I'm trying to be pro-active about my search for go-to Black folks.  So here's my dilemma, the kind of church I want to commune at really doesn't exist.  I know I'm picky, but this shouldn't be this blasted difficult here in Chicago.  What I want is this:  1. Lutheran sacramentology and communes every week at every Sunday worship service.  If I can't get that, I'd go for an  urlLink ELCA Full Communion partner  that communes each week.  2.  Theologically - Jesus is divine Son of God, human Son of Man, not too much "washed in the blood of  Jay-sus! ," they'd embrace my gay friends and encourage them to get married and become pastors, social justice-y without too many white guys with dreadlocks (preferably none if I can get it)  3. Lots of Black folks (including the pastor), at least 75%, and lots of them with bachelors & advanced degrees.  I'm tired of sitting in churches feeling like the pastor and I are probably the only ones who've pursued higher ed.  And I hate the feeling that I'm one of the few scholastically bent folks around; people expect you to be smart and that just ain't true.  4. A good amount of approaching, eligible young Black men who could deal with dating a future pastor.  Yeah, I said it - I want to hook up at church, damn it!  5. Good sense of mission and vision and a proper balance of outward/inward focus  So yeah, this doesn't exist in the ELCA as far as I can tell.  Or at least in Chicago.  And it's bugging me.  If I wanted this in a White Lutheran church (perhaps minus eligible young men) I could easily find it.  Chicago doesn't lack for Buppies, they just lack for Lutheran Buppies.  So, this reiterates my desire to do a mission plant among Black, Young, Urban Professionals.  The ELCA has some big issues with race, but they're usually tied up with class.  The ELCA, on average, is comprised of congregations and congregation members that are fairly well off.  Last I heard, the ELCA was only behind the Episcopal Church USA in average earnings of members among Protestant churches in the US.  There are a lot of Swedish farmers who left big estates behind.  Now the ELCA finds itself trying to reach out to Black people, but it's usually Black folks in urban centers and urban congregations that decided to stand firm in the face of White flight.  I'm grateful for the decisions of those congregations that didn't run off with their members to the suburbs.  However, this leaves poor Blacks as the bulk of the minorities in the ELCA.  So - painting in very broad strokes - the average White ELCA member is "rich."  The average Black ELCA member is "poor."  Bad politics, that.  But now, I'm part of the first generation of African-Americans that has grown up solidly middle class.  The children of my cohorts will be the beginnings of the first generation of African-Americans that grew up solidly middle class with parents that also grew up solidly middle class (instead of urban or rural poor, my parents growing up as the latter.)  So my dream is to some day start a Lutheran version of  urlLink Trinity United Church of Christ,  a congregation here in Chicago on the South Side.   I figure part of my call is to help the ELCA integrate overall.  I don't necessarily feel called to help integrate individual congregations.  If the ELCA is going to ever hit it's goal of being 10% people of color (which is still pretty damn paltry in my opinion, but it's a start) it's going to take the influence of an ELCA brown-skinned megachurch that doesn't fall into all that Prosperity Gospel sludge.  If there are large congregations of upwardly mobile middle-to-upper-middle class, educated Blacks, they will be able to speak to the upwardly mobile middle-to-upper-middle class, educated Whites about the issues of race in Christianity and the ELCA.  This will hopefully allow us to speak honestly about the issues of race without the mitigating factor of class also being thrown in.  That just kills a lot of conversations, I think.  We pretend the issues are the same - and lots of times they are.  But lots of times, they're different.  And back to my current dilemma.  The church I want doesn't exist.  So I'm out on a limb, here.  I've spent the past hour or so just breeding frustration by looking at churches online.  There are a few I'm interested in worshipping with, but I can't find their worship times.  One of them is a worshipping community (not a full church yet) so they don't have a set worship space.  I think folks in their neighborhood know where they are, but they don't have an office number I can call to get the info.  And this pisses me off to no end.  I want to worship.  I don't want to jump through the hoops.  It sucks being a Black Lutheran some times.  This is definately one of those times.

      "It was the end of summer, a summer during a two-year nightmare.  African American children around Atlanta were vanishing, and twenty-nine would be murdered by the end of 1981.

      Okay, I'm in charge of chapel for the hospital this Sunday.  Guess who's festival day it is - Mary, Mother of Our Lord!  So a Lutheran chaplain, who's honestly not much of a Marist, gets to create a service and preach a sermon in prep for Sunday chapel services at a hospital that serves mostly Roman Catholics.  On a feast day celebrating a person who's basic identity is seen in vastly different lights by Lutherans and Roman Catholics.  Great.  I resisted adding into the sermon, "And when Mary died and went to heaven, I'm sure her other sons and daughters mourned her passing."  Perpetual virginity my rump.  I just had a dry run with the other chaplains, and it went pretty well.  But, question: what does the (Blessed Virgin?) Mary, Mother of Our Lord mean to you?  Feel free to  urlLink email me  with any ideas or leave a comment on this post.  Even if they come after I do the service, I'd be glad to hear from folks.

      I realized I haven't obsessed about my compatriots or my eating habits recently.  I need to keep the promises of my profile. So here goes.  Today I had a  great  homemade BLT for lunch.  The secret is using turkey bacon (mainly because it gets crispy after less cooking time than regular bacon, plus it's less bad on the heart) and cilantro mayonaise.  Now, the cilantro mayonaise is one of the few good things I got out of the South Beach Diet Cookbook.  South Beach isn't nearly as dangerous as I think Atkins is - "eat a pound of bacon with breakfast, a pound of hamburger in your patty melt for lunch, and a sensible dinner of a meat lover's pizza with the crust made of sausage!"  I'm all about cutting down on refined carbs. Heck I even made a batch of Moosewood Fudge Brownies with whole wheat flour.  So there.  But dang it, meat is expensive!  I did lose about 17 pounds with South Beach last spring, but at least 10 pounds was due to the lightening of my wallet with buying all that expensive meat.  I dig me some meat, but dang it, beans are cheaper.  As a fellow seminary student once told me, "I'm a freegan.  I only eat meat when it's free."  Back to cilantro mayo - to (approximately) make it, I use 1/2 cup cilantro, 1/2 cup light mayo, 1 tsp lemon juice (or lime if you've got it), a minced clove of garlic, and 1/2 tsp of soy sauce.  Mix and let refrigerate for a while for the flavors to mix.  It's one of my new favorite condiments. =================== Concerning the friends, Praise the Lord, folks are moving back to campus.  Not that my current on campus friends aren't wonderful (y'all rock!) but I'm sure I'm boring folks with my tales of personal growth and despair from the hospital.  If more folks show up, I don't actually have to go out and get some new experiences.  That's the key to life people.  You don't need to go out and get new stories.  Forget actually having a perpetually interesting life.  You just need to get new friends that haven't heard the old stories.

      "For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do."  No kidding, there.  So of course, to compensate, I find myself trying to force myself to do things that I find distasteful or scary.  At CPE, I've discovered that often ends up being the best thing.  Often, the room I least want to go into (I'll disturb them, They're talking, They look like they're trying to sleep, That patient just looks really cranky) ends up being a place God calls me to.  Dangit!  All this denial of self and taking up my cross daily is giving me splinters on my back!

Not enough to pay the $65.00 ticket price (horror!), but definately enough to take advantage of a free ticket (won in a radio contest by friend's sister but sister had prior engagement that night) and a chance to head out to the Tweeter Center venue.  So friend and I are in the dark surrounded by swooning 20-year-olds women and their equally swooning mothers and grandmas.  It was a good concert.  He sang stuff in Italian, Spanish, and perhaps Portuguese that I couldn't understand, but it sounded impressive.  He sang the stuff in English that I've heard before.  Once he sang "You Raise Me Up," friend and I figured we had heard all the stuff we wanted to hear, it was 10 PM, and we had hospital work in the morning.  Let the true fans sit out the 3 or 4 encores.  Yes, I know someone out there may want to beat me up for not savoring every moment of the concert.  But, y'all, as much as I luv me some deep male voices ::shivers up spine:: I can only stand so much Italian.

      I've noticed an interesting thing about my faith life recently.  At CPE, I pray.  A lot.  I've never prayed so much in my life.  I pray with people, for people, on behalf of people, in spite of people.  And my prayers are often extemporaneous and off-the-cuff, but with a formula.  That's a bit of a security blanket.  In the past, I've tried to avoid letting any vestiges of the faith of my youth show up in the faith of my young adulthood.  But, now it's creeping back in.  I tend to talk of our "Gracious God."  But I find a lot more "Father God" escaping me.  (Someday I hope to be equally comfortable with "Mother God," but that's a ways off.)  I thank God that we woke up "with breath still in our bodies and blood still running warm in our veins."  During Sunday services that phrase crossed the lips of my father and others many a time.  At first this scared me.  "How can I fully be a justified-by-grace Lutheran if I'm embracing even a small part of my old works-righteousness upbringing?"  It kind of felt like the gnesio-Lutherans from back in early post-Reformation days, "In times of confession and declaring who we are, we can't bend on any point!  Everything is important to distinguish ourselves from the Papists!"  But then, given time, most of the gnesio-Lutherans died out.  Once the fire of "We must be distinct at all costs!" isn't burning with such blind fervor, then the more reasonable voices saying, "Now let's look at our similarities," can be heard.  Maybe it's time for me to move away from that overwhelming need to be different.  If I truly believe - as I often state - that the Churches of God Holiness are comprised of Christians, then we do have a lot more in common than not.  I can truly believe that their message isn't what I need to hear and I actually think all that talk of "earning our way into heaven" did a lot of damage to me individually and to other people, but I want to believe they do that in the spirit of trying to be faithful to God's call.  No, I don't know what it means to call a group or a person "Christian" when I know I'm a Christian and we believe some truly different things.  I'm still working on that.  But now that the terminolgy of my youth is pervading my young adult hood, maybe I'm finally ready to cull through the stuff they've left me with.  Some will stay, some will go.  But maybe I'm more prepared to discern what belongs in which pile.

      - from the song "Landslide" sung by Fleetwood Mac, Dixie Chicks, Ari Hest, and God knows who else  I've spent the last few days seperating myself from situations I never should have gotten into in the first place.  Over the past few years, I've discovered that I have this grand talent and tolerance for putting myself into crappy situations.  I do this for two reasons: 1. I figure I don't deserve any better than crap, and/or 2. I think I can redeem the situation from the crap it's housed in.  And, as I've been living out this weekend, neither of those scenarios are true.  I've stuck it out in relationships, jobs, classes, etc that no person should have to put up with.  Often, I'd realize I was in way over my head, but I'd be too prideful or scared to  get the hell out.   So this weekend, in various arenas, I left some folks high and dry.  I pulled myself (quite belatedly) out of promises I never should have made in the first place.  And I'm endeavoring to be a bit more discerning before I jump into things.  The problem with being a "Yes Woman" is that you lose all sense of perception.  I have a habit of saying "Yes!" to the first thing that comes along, because I'm afraid of people not liking me or being afraid this is the best shot I'll get.  So as some of those dratted self-help tomes I devour say, "Don't let 'good' get in the way of 'best'."  I'm truly,  truly  sorry for the folks I've screwed over.  Even when I saw the situations going south, I didn't take the more noble and mature path and get OUT!  No - I lingered, and hemmed and hawed to myself about leaving, and ended up faltering in place, and eventually failing and causing more damage than if I hadn't gotten involved in the first blasted place.  So I must remember to tell myself - "It's better to feel like I'm screwing people over early, than to truly screw them over later."  I can't afford to spend my life building it around what other people expect of me.  Or, even better, building my life around what I  perceive  people expect of me.  So, this marks the beginning of my end of desperate living.  I have choices, I should act like it.

      Yeah, right.  I live near the Chicago Southside.  Local folklore said my Southern suburban hometown had a higher per capita murder rate than New York City.  So I know a scant bit about crime, both of the random and the "he needed killin' 'cause he disrespected my sistuh" variety.  So we know there's crime, yes.  We know there's violent crime, yes.  We know there's epidemics of poor and rich youth with too little supervision and too much time on their hands and too little to strive for, yes.  But do we acknowledge  where  it's happening?  Here's an  urlLink interesting article (yes from the New York Times, just register already!)  about gangs hitting rural areas.  This paragraph below is a good reason for me why foreign affairs should always be paid attention to.   Like 19th-century Irish-American gangs, which arose from an immigrant community that had fled famine, MS-13 has its origins in turmoil abroad. As the brutal civil war in El Salvador was waged in the 80's, pitting leftist guerrillas against the American-backed government, more than a million Salvadorans sought refuge in the United States. Thousands literally walked much of the way to America, initially settling in the Rampart neighborhood of Los Angeles, where they were not warmly welcomed by the established Hispanic community. ''Mexican gangs picked on them mercilessly,'' says Al Valdez, a veteran gang investigator in the district attorney's office in Orange County, Calif.   It's all connected people.  Folks get crapped on elsewhere, they come to the US and spread crap here.  So there are wayward folks going downhill fast - and taking everyone with them - in rural areas.  But, rich white kids aren't immune from doing this crap either.  Oh, no, no, no, my friends.  Check out the PBS Frontline documentary  urlLink "The Lost Children of Rockdale County."   This is a wealthy suburb of Atlanta, GA.  A syphllis outbreak among youth signaled to (some) community leaders, "Hey!  Something is seriously wrong here."  So Frontline followed a group of teens around to look at their life.  It's shocking and scary and sad.  And people still believe that it can't happen in the 'burbs.  Honey, I grew up in the burbs.  I went to school with your children in suburban schools.  Let me assure you, it's happening.  Something I like about living in an urban environment is that church and city leaders usually don't need to convince people that something is wrong.  Granted, most folks still like to believe there's nothing wrong with them or their own, but at least folks generally concede that life ain't as grand as it could be.  In the suburbs, not so much.  Suburban life is built around the idea that everyone is the same, so nothing can be wrong with anyone.  Because that would mean that something's wrong with everyone.  Unfortunately, I think the latter is more the case.  And I think suburban kids get trapped in a bad way.  They're trying to make themselves distinctive when all their cohorts dress alike, think alike, move alike, and have similar characteristics.  Even if someone busts out of the box - goes all Goth or becomes a Korn Kid or a Riot Grrl! - they've just changed from the big herd to a smaller herd.  Still a herd.  And I'm fine with herding.  Get every square inch of your skin pierced or tattooed for all I care, just don't be writing checks with your mouth that your butt can't cash.  On a whim, a few weeks ago I was in a local 'burb with some friends for a city festival.  Paris Hilton skirts and scantily clad girls as far as the eye could see.  Most of them were aiming for Paris & Nicole's blondness with the other members of their tribe.  Then the Korn Kids came in, and they had on Punk Paris Hilton skirts!  It never ends!  My friends and I kept wondering, "Did their mothers let them out of the house looking like that?"  But then we also recalled our high school days.  For two of us, backless shirts were the big rage, back in the day.  I personally came to the conclusion that high school and youngster fashion will always push the envelope.  Since the 60's or so, that envelope is always, "How much female skin can we get away with showing?"  For my age group, it was backs, sometimes it's shoulders, a few years ago it was midriff (and still is many times), and now especially - legs.  And there will always be a group of kids at your local high school who will do drugs.  In my day (by cracky, you young whippersnappers!) they did Pot or cheap beer.  Now, pot's bad.  It can kill you or just make you do dumb stuff that you'll pay the rest of your life for.  But, your downward spiral with pot can take a year or two.  You've at least got a few months in there before rehab is unavoidable.  In that "grace" period, an attentive adult or friend can find out and smack some sense into you.  But now, youngsters jump into E, Special K, Meth, Crack, and chase it with whiskey or Everclear.  More potent poison = less "grace" period to get caught and/or get off it.  Now, you do Ecstacy, and you could be dead in 2 months, easy.  So the stakes are higher.  Parents, your kids are less than 3 degrees of seperation from someone who can get them a chemical that could peel the paint off the walls of their brain.  Kids are less than 3 degrees of seperation away from a party where they could get into a sexual situation that scars them for life.  Youth today are less than 3 degrees of seperation away from getting involved in a gang (or some dipwad friend's "posse") and getting trucked off to jail.    Pay attention to your kids!
