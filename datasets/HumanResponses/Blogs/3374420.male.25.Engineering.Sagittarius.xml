      Things did not run smoothly as my imagination.And a good paper needs the reviews of experts.Thus, We have to make a wide modification on our paper even though we had modification a lot before. Keep doing that~~~ but a bit lazy and tired now.

      These two days I had a hard experience with the performance. I had to re-build a new program to test some performance of the iButton for DES,RSA operations.I did many many tests.....I think I should do this work before starting the implementation. The results: testing is a killing time work. :(

      Last night and this morning, I spent almost 6 hours on doing the performance evaluation and I think the testing results are perfect good. :) I am looking forward to Chong's reply now. But at the same time another "performance" makes me mad....

      It is not easy to get a chance, so if you get one, you should try your best to handle it,and do not let it go away.

      Living abroad is not a easy thing. You should learn how to live ,study and solve some troublesome things. But they are precious experience for me. Our paper is still in improvement. But I don't know when we can finish it. Hope soon.   PS. The weather becomes very hot today comparing with the cold in previous days.

      Life is hard. Troubles will become more and more with age's increase. Sometimes I picks up the memories of my childhood. What a wonderful time it is!  "非淡泊无以明志,非宁静无以致远",an old chinese maxim ,which I should remember all my life.

      Eclipse.org published the Eclipse 3.0 recently ,a product of an open source software project. Many people prefer to use it as a Java IDE , but it is much beyond that.Other tool builders can be installed as plug-ins and integrated in Eclipse.   In my projet I also used the Eclipse(a old version 2.1) to made the Java code(almost 3000 lines)for the hardware token(iButton) and the Host.I feel very smooth and effective by using Eclipse comparing with the later versions of Jbuilder ,which gives me the impression: massiness.(Sorry,just my own idea, Jbuilder can support some technique such as JSP,etc very well.)  I like Eclipse indeed.
