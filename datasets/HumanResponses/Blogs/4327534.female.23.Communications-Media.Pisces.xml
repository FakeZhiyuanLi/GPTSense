      Just discovered Darlene Zschech last night. She was in the news. I know..i know..i'm very the outdated for most of you penangites out there :P pity me lor..i hermit mah. haha. but makes me nostalgic for Wesley. Absolutely love the songs. Gonna go get the CD. If anybody wanna send to me...i dun mind ;) **hint hint**  So sienzz today...stupid house agent..disturbing my privacy. GrRrr..Supposed to go body combat..but didn't make it. And now home..waiting for the troublesome pesty agent. and boooreed at home..althoughi should stop procrastinating and start on my Aboriginal presentation and my Script/Storyboard for media. YaWWNn...haha.. just the thought makes me SOoOooo happy.  ~"A careless word may kindle strife; a cruel word may wreck a life; a timely word may level stress, a loving word may heal and bless."~  Man..this is so true..I had a fren in uni the other day..dunno him well. In my group, and he was really breaking down in front of us. (a couple of us gals in the same group) His stress level, tension, ..the whole lot was so HIGH, you can actually feel that its possible to cut a knife through it. So lost for words..since i dunno him well..dun wanna 'activate' him (get him violent or something..make it worse) and yet..*Sigh*  "We rush towards an eternity of seconds lost" "Stop and smell the roses... ;) the little things in life. "  Anyway gonna tidy up the house a bit now. GrRrrr..HUG HUGS  MmMm..i had GuyLian seashelly choc the other nite...YuMmMYYyy

      ~The Grand Essential of Happiness are : Something to do, Something to love and something to hope for. ~  After much talk of blogging, i'm finally in the blogging world. THANKS a Zillion to my dear for putting up with the fussiest client in the world!~ME! Love my page now. hehe. Just hope i keep it up! (Crossing fingers) Well..as my dear friend, Cher and i said..its a good outlet to vent our pent up emotions. Writing is always good. Found this Quote somewhere...Hmm...   ~A Road without obstacles leads to nowhere. A road with no obstacles has no merit to follow. Don't spend your life looking for the meaning of life. Life has no meaning ; you give it one. ~   Well..provoked my sleep deprived mind for awhile..contradiction. I think its so true..and yet..form the back of my mind, i know i've always wondered since i was a small kiddo.."What is the meaning of life" " why am i on earth" " Why does the system of life itself consist of studying, working..etc" " why is everything in the world...the way it is..??" A Flashback of my first encounter with fear of the unknown...I was very young then..not even in primary i guess, and out by the gate with my dad (think he was painting the gate or something) and i remember i've seen in the tv about comets hitting earth..etc. I recall suddenly feeling scared and looking up to the sky. I guess thats kinda when i started having all these ponderings about life...and possibly for a long time to come.  Anywaysssss, i think thats all i can muster up for a first blog! My mind's pretty much konk off d. :)
