						   Once there was this young married couple, named Janelle and Alex. Janelle is a woman of average weight and height. She has long flowing corn silk hair that went all the way down her back. She has sparkly emerald green eyes and creamy milky white skin, that was soft as a baby’s bottom to the touch. Her breast where round and supple like two fresh picked melons. Alex on the other had is a tall rouged man, with well built legs and arms. He has short dark hair with the spookiest blue eyes you ever seen. Janelle and Alex seemed like the worlds greatest couple. They complemented each other like pie and ice cream. Before they married, it seemed like they had been together forever. So the bond between them was a tight unbreakable one.   It was going on their five year wedding anniversary, when Janelle began to feel something missing in their marriage. Its not that after being with Alex for so long, that Janelle was losing interest in her husband. She was just looking for away to spice up there love life in the bedroom. It came to mind that they had tried all most everything that a couple can do together as husband and wife. So for there anniversary, she wanted to do something different for him. Something that would blow his socks off, something that would put that spark back in the marriage. For the ideal wedding anniversary gift, Janelle thought she would give Alex the one thing he always wanted - the opportunity to have a threesome. So the next logical step was to sit down and discuss this idea with her husband. After which they would work together to find a woman that both of them would feel comfortable with. Someone that would be open to there interests and needs. Someone that would understand that this was something that was new to the both of them. Janelle was really hoping that they would find someone that would really turn on her husband.   When Janelle sat down to talk to Alex she carefully explained to him the following:  First, she loved his with all her heart and soul. Second, she was wanting to give him the ideal wedding anniversary present. Third, she was wanting to spice things up a little more in the bedroom. Fourth, she trusted his judgment to find them, the right person to do this.  Alex sat there and listened to what his wife was telling him and he kept thinking he was the luckiest man in the world to have Janelle. Here his wife was wanting to allow him to have another woman come into their relationship and throw in some spice. Alex was more then pleased with his wife’s idea for his anniversary gift.   So with that in mind, Alex went to work to find the ideal woman to bring his wife’s idea to give him the ultimate anniversary present to life. For Janelle told him to write up a few ads stating the kind of women that he would really like to have besides his own wife. Janelle figured it would be better this way. She thought that when it came down to picking the right woman, for the job that Alex should be able to choose the one. Kind of like turning a kid loose in a candy store saying you can have anything you want . Janelle had full faith in her husband and what ever choice he might make.   Alex placed the following ad online and in there free personal section of the paper in all hopes of finding a woman to meet there needs.  His ad read like this :  Clean young married couple, in good health (D/D free), and attractive. We want to try new experiences, and have some good clean fun. We are willing to do most anything. An ideal person for us would be a lady who's in good health (D/D free), bi or bi- curious, attractive, fun loving and willing to try new experiences with us. Must be discreet. Spontaneity is encouraged.  Not even a week after posting there ad Alex and Janelle had tons of people emailing them and leaving them messages about there ad. Both of them have where shocked by the all the responses. One by one they went threw all the ladies that answered there ad. The where women of all backgrounds, shapes and sizes, but none of these woman did it for Alex. He had the ideal women in his mind and he wasn’t going to give up until he found her.  Well Alex was just about give up when Andrea had walked into there life. Andrea was the ideal woman that Alex had been searching for. See Andrea was tall slender woman that stood about 6 foot 3. She has golden brown skin that is silky smooth to the touch. Her breasts are the size large round melons that bounced ever so slightly when she walked. She has long dark beautiful hair that was about&nbsp;½ inch from touching the floor. She has sweetest shade of almond colored eyes, that had a twinkled when she smiled. Andrea was an ideal woman all right not a part on her sexy body was fake. She was angel that was cast down to this earth to please both men and women. Well mostly women she loved to be between a woman’s legs munching on some carpet. She like being with men as well, its just that she been burned on men so they kind of put a sour taste in her mouth. Andrea theory on things was a simple one men make good friends and good lovers, but women know how to get the job done.   After reviewing a few other women Alex finally presented his with wife with a top five and told her that out all the people that responded these are the women he narrowed it down to. Janelle was please with Alex top five picks. So she was careful to make a the best choice that she had found the right one that would understand her position in all of this. For Janelle did not have the fist clue as to how to go about pleasing a women or even how to get thing started in a threesome. So the women that she was going to pick would have to make this process smooth for everyone. Kind of take on all the pressure kind of thing. After a little bit of time of reviewing Alex notes and talking with the women, Janelle pick Andrea to be there new partner. She pick Andrea for the fact that she been with both women and men, along with done a few threesome before. There was all so something about Andrea that kind of just made Janelle feel at ease and turned her on. Janelle Just didn’t know what it was yet about Andrea, but she was about to find out.  After a few times of talking on the phone and emailing each other, Janelle along with Alex finally set a date for Andrea to come over to the house and have there little adult fun/dinner. Janelle thought it would be a good ice breaker if they all sat down and have a nice dinner at the house, that way they could relax and not be so nervous. Janelle made a nice dinner for the 3 of them, which compiled of Roast Beef, Mashed Potatoes with Gravy, Peas &amp; Carrots blend. They even had cherry pie for dessert, with Vanilla ice cream on the side.   With the dinner done and the dishes washed Alex went into the bedroom to set everything up, while Janelle and Andrea sat in the living room talking. Alex thought his wife might feel more relaxed if the bedroom was more of a relaxed environment. So Alex went and lit a few of the in scent and candles around the room and turned down the covers on there bed. The whole time he was doing this Andrea was sitting out in the living room plotting how to do everything in her head. Janelle just sat there had carried on a con version with Andrea trying her best not to show how nervous she was about all of this.   Alex finished his preparations in the bedroom and walked out to the living room. He stood there in the entrance way of the hall and say “When you ladies are ready the bed awaits you both”. He said this as he bent forward and stretched his arm out like the do when they greet you in a fancy hotel. Both Andrea and Janelle where impressed by this and got up slowly and walked passed Alex. Andrea walk with a seductive slink to her with her bag in one hand and Janelle’s hand in the other. See Janelle thought she would make the first move by leading Andrea by the hand down the hall to the bedroom.   Andrea was glad to see that Janelle was starting to get into all of this, and made the first move. In Andrea’s mind everyone has to feel comfortable and if its the women in this makes the first move then that’s the green light to keep going. Now, if Janelle wouldn’t have given the green she would have found a different way to get the thumbs up from her and Alex. The last thing Andrea was trying to do was making anyone feel out of place with her actions. Andrea knew how it was the first time she was in there position. Andrea was trying her hardest not to let her aggressive side be to strong for now that is.

						   Before she started to work on Janelle’s skirt, she asked Janelle nicely to stop what she was doing. She explained to Janelle that she would be able to play more later. Not that she wasn’t enjoying what Janelle was doing its just that she couldn’t finish with Janelle playing.  Alex watched as Andrea spoke in softly into his wife’s ear. He looked down at his pants that where by this time getting really tight and starting to hurt. He could only wondering what was being said. He was hoping that they where making plans to free him soon Then he seen a sad look on Janelle’s face. He was unsure if Janelle was upset about having to stop, and help relieve the pressure that was building. Only if he knew the reason his wife was upset, was due to the fact that she indeed need to stop. Not to let him out of his pants, but for Andrea to let Janelle out of her panties and skirt.   Janelle was slightly upset that she had to stop; on the other hand she was happy to stop for a moment knowing she have a chance to play with Andrea more later on. Away in thought Janelle, started to think to that she wasn’t sure of these feelings that where brewing up inside of her. For this is the first time she had ever been with another woman before. The feeling was like it was like unlocking this box inside of her. She couldn’t help but feel turned on and open to playing and sharing Alex with this woman. Janelle was pondering these thoughts as she allowed Andrea to remove one more article of clothing.   Andrea unassigned the clasp at the top of Janelle’s skirt and slowly took the zipper all the way down. Let the skirt fall to the floor on its own. The she grabbed both Janelle’s panties and stockings, and slowly carefully pulled them down at the same time. She removed this way to avoid getting any runner in the stockings. When She was finally reached Janelle’s ankles; Andrea carefully lifted each foot and slipped everything off.  With both removed (panties &amp; stockings), Andrea got up off the floor with Janelle soaked panties in hand. She took the panties and raised them up to her nose so she could get a good whiff of them. Andrea had a thing for smelling women’s panties after she knew the woman has at cummed at least one time in them. She got a kick out of doing this with every woman she was with.   After taking in the lovely smell of Janelle’s cum soaked black lace panties. Andrea glanced at Alex for second then tossed them at him. In all hopes he was going to catch them. Alex being in the state of mind, he was in he never seen the panties flying at him, for poor Alex was trying to think of things then the great pressure building up and causing him pain.

						   As they walked closer to the bedroom, Andrea took notice of the light smell of lavender and jasmine in the air. She was impressed that they had remembered that they were her favorite scents. Alex knew he did good by Andrea for the fact she had a really big grin on her face.   Alex made sure when he set up their bedroom that he had left nothing out of place and that the whole romantic setting was perfect. He had laid out the best sheets out - the ruby red satin sheets that Janelle bought some time ago for a really special night. On top of the sheets were their two best full-sized pillows, with dusty rose pillow shams over them, along with two small heart-shaped throw pillows in the middle, which matched the bed sheets. Alex carefully placed four candles on top the old oak headboard of their bed, and made sure they were not too close to the edge where they might cause a fire or tip over. The last thing they needed tonight was a fire and then having to explain to the fire department what happened. He could see it now, “Oh I’m sorry, Sir. My wife and I where getting are freak on with this other lady and we kind of knocked over one of the candles that was set out to make the mood.” Hell no, he wasn’t going to take any chances tonight. Last but not least, Alex carefully placed the lavender and jasmine incense on the far corners of Janelle’s dressing mirror.   Now, with them all inside of the room Andrea sat her bag down gently on the floor, and then walked around the room, taking in all the sites and smells. After she examined the beautiful setting that Alex had created, Andrea walked up to him and asked “Did you do all of this for me by chance ?” Alex stood there with his eyes locked with her, the whole time having that star struck look and nodded yes. Janelle was also quite impressed at how her husband went to such effort to make this both a romantic and relaxed environment. She was extremely pleased with how everything complemented each other in the room.   There was a brief period of silence in the room, as both women were awestruck at how Alex had spared no expense on making tonight the perfect night. Also, there was the silence as to what was going to happen next. Andrea took liberty and broke the silence and said, “Why don’t we all get al little more comfortable by removing some of these clothes?” So with everyone agreeing to get undressed. Andrea slowly crept behind Janelle, then wrapped her arms around Janelle’s waist like she was going to hug her. Instead of giving her a hug, Andrea reached up and started slowly unbuttoning Janelle’s top.   With their eyes locked Alex had a relaxed feeling about him, as he started removing his shirt as well. Never flinching or taking his eyes off the show Andrea was giving him. In the mist of fighting with his belt, he could see the worried all most scared look Janelle for projecting him. Alex tried to reflect back to her a calm relaxed kina look back to her, one that said its ok just got with it kind of thing.   Now Janelle on the other hand was feeling a little nervous about the whole thing, but there was that small part of her that was enjoying it. For Janelle has never had a woman undress her this way, let alone a male fro that matter. It was all new to her right now, and it was something she was willing to try.   As Andrea stood behind her slowly undoing one button at a time, with high hopes of teasing Alex and turning on Janelle at the same time. She got this feeling to glance around her subject for only a brief moment. What she seen was Alex deadlocked his eyes on them as he was fighting to remove his belt. It was only a matter of time, that he would have his jeans as well as his boxers removed.   Andrea paused for a moment, so she could walk over to Janelle’s side. When she stopped like she did. Alex stooped all together too. Before she made her way to Janelle’s side, Alex had asked her in a concerned tone “ Is everything ok, do you need something, did I or we do something wrong?” Alex was shooting off these questions like rapid fire not even giving Andrea a moment to give her answer to what was wrong.   When Alex stop a second Andrea took it as a sign to quickly voice her opinion on this subject. She told Alex in a calm voice that nothing was wrong and she didn’t require anything at the moment, that she had only small request of him. Alex stood there with his hands still on his belt, and an eager look on his face. He told her that her wish was his command. Andrea got a sly grin on her face when Alex had told her this.   For if Alex is willing to do whatever she wanted this early in the game, then her work was cut out for her. She told him in a sweet seductive tone that all she wanted him to do right now was stand there enjoy the show and keep his jeans on for the time being. She explained that all in good time they would help him with his jeans.   So being the good sport he is, Alex took his hands off of his belt and did as he was told. Andrea was pleased, when she had taken a moment to poke her head to the side to one side to one side of Janelle. All the while she had her hands on Janelle’s slender hips. She seen Alex was standing the stiff as a soldier waiting for his orders.   With everything in order Andrea went back to the task at hand, which was working on the many buttons on Janelle’s top. Andrea did just that, she ducked her head back and slowly moved her hands back up to where she left off.   This sent a slight tingling feeling threw out Janelle’s body. Which caused Janelle to lean into Andrea with her head slightly tip to the one side. Janelle let out a little moan and reached her hand back and started to lift Andrea’s dress. Janelle figured might as well have some fun while she was getting dressed. So she moved what she thought was Andrea’s panties over, so she could start fingering Andrea’s pussy. As she was playing with Andrea, she could tell that Andrea was all ready hot and bothered due to she was soaking wet.  Alex stood there up against the wall watching every move the two women where making, while having fun with each other. He couldn’t help to think that he was not in his bedroom with his wife and another woman; but in the middle of a porn video. For this was nothing like anything they done before.   After all that was Janelle’s main reason for this little arrangement, was she wanted to do something different for her husband this evening. You only get one chance to celebrate five wonderful years together.   Janelle was hot and bothered, as well as pleased by the look that was on Alex’s face. She was really getting turned on by how wet Andrea was becoming with just a little bit of play. Plus it was a real turn on, to her having another woman removing clothing slowly gently and so lovingly.   Andrea finally reached the last button on Janelle shirt. As she gently removed Janelle’s shirt, she took time to kiss on Janelle’s neck. This made Janelle moan loader and Alex pants to swell slightly. With shirt removed and breast exposed. Andrea moved on to the removal of Janelle’s shirt She left Janelle’s bra on for now not wanting to rush the release of Janelle’s wonderful breasts. Alex was wondering why Andrea had left Janelle’s bra on, after she removed Janelle’s shirt. He figured she had her reasons and would clue him in later.

						   After getting Janelle set up so that she could see and everything, Andrea walked back to where she was standing at Alex ‘s side. She had Alex turn so they where standing face to face, and looking deep into each others eyes. Andrea could see the pain that was welling up in Alex’s eyes and was pleased to see that she was doing her job so well. Up until this point Alex was having a hard time focusing on anything really but the pain in his pants. There was just something in Andrea’s almond eyes that took and melted away all the pain.  They stood with there eyes locked for a little bit, then Andrea took and wrapped her arm around Alex and started to kiss him with great passion, along with fondling him threw his jeans. At first Janelle is pissed because she couldn’t do anything being tied down to the bed all. Then she then realizes how hot and bothered she was getting watching another woman making out with her husband. With all the excitement going on Janelle pussy was becoming dripping wet and Alex’s cock was starting to throb.  After 10 to 15 minutes of this, Andrea thought it was about time to let Alex have some freedom from the problem brew down below. Andrea got down on her knees so she would not be blocking Janelle’s view, and then reached up to Alex’s waist. Alex looked down at her with a puzzled look on his face, Andrea just looked up at him and said don’t worry I will be gentle. Alex just got a big grin on his face and leaned up against the wall and let Andrea do her thing.  Andrea slowly removed his belt; after that she moved on to unbuttoning his jeans, then grasped the zipper on his jeans and took her time unzipping them. She was wanting to prolong the event of removing his jeans as long as she could. When she was in the process of unzipping his jeans Andrea got a little bit of a surprise, Alex cock popped out of his jeans like a jack in the box that would pop out of box after you cranked it enough times. He cock had just sprung of his jeans and smacked in the face. Alex looked down at Andrea and said “I am sorry I didn’t mean for that to happen“. Andrea didn’t seem to be bothered by this she just kept up removing Alex’s jeans.

						   Not wanting to up set their guest Alex did as he was told, he took the two sections of rope that Andrea threw at him and started to tie down his wife’s left arm and leg. All the while Andrea was tying down Janelle to the bed tons of ideas where flying threw her head. She was thinking of the many ways to get Janelle all worked up as well making things harder on Alex. For what Andrea didn’t know Janelle was all getting worked up and was a little scared all at the same time about being tied up.  Janelle laid there on the bed and tried not to let on that she was scared about being tied up. She was both afraid as well as turn on by the fact that this really hot woman was tying her down to their bed. In fact Janelle was really getting turn on by this. It was the whole idea of not know what was going to happen next to her that was really lighting Janelle fire.  After they got threw tying up Janelle to the bed, Andrea started to slink her way over the side of the room where Alex is standing was in great pain. She took him by the hand and lead him to the foot of the bed . She asked Janelle if she could see everything ok or did she need an extra pillow under her head. Janelle said that she could see but and extra pillow would be nice to have. Andrea leaned over and gave Alex a kiss on the check and squeezed his cock lightly, then walked back over to Janelle left side.  She gently lifted Janelle head and placed one of the heart shaped throw pillows under her head and then asked is that better sweetie. Janelle just laid there unable to move any part of her body but her head and her pussy dripping wet. Andrea took from the silence that was a yes. She looked at Janelle and said are you all right and can you see everything ok . Janelle quickly said yes everything is ok and she could see everything all right.

						   To get things back on track Andrea took and wrapped her arms around Janelle and started to give her a passionate kiss and groping her. All the while Andrea was kissing and feeling up Janelle, she slowly moved back towards the bed. Her whole idea was to distract Janelle and get her on to the bed with out her really noticing what was going on.   Watching his wife get felt up and kissed was really starting to make the problem in Alex pants get worse. For he was getting everything he wanted for this whole experience and some. Alex has always watched stuff like this happen in porno’s, but never in his wildest dream did he ever think it would come to life in his own house. He was enjoying every moment, even thought he was in a great deal of pain.   Meanwhile over by the bed Andrea was still playing so gently with Janelle’s breasts and kissing her ever so sweetly. She carefully leaned Janelle back on to the bed, the whole time in full lip lock. Andrea had moved her into the center of the bed and then stopped what she was doing. Then got up off the bed and grabbed Janelle one arm and said to Alex ok sweetie lets get started. Alex looked at with his head cocked to the side with that what do you mean look on his face.   Andrea said we are going to tie her down to the bed and then start to have a little fun. Janelle laid there with her one arm pinned down on the bed and started to get a little scared but turned on by the idea of getting tied up. Andrea looked down at Janelle with a loving smile and said don’t worry we are not going to hurt you.  After putting Janelle mind at ease Andrea reached into her black bag and pulled out for sections of love rope. She took two of these sections of rope and tossed them to Alex and instructed him to go ahead and tie down Janelle arm and leg on his side to the bed, while she went and tied down Janelle arm and leg on her side.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

						   Back on the other side of the room with Andrea, Janelle stood there for a few minutes debate the best place top have Andrea stand . She wanted Andrea to be standing in the best place so Alex could see everything perfectly. She wanted him to have the same advantage/ view as he did when Andrea was undressing her. She thought it was only fair that he should get the same view as did before with her. With that in mind Janelle moved Andrea into position and started to slowly unzip her dress.   As Janelle was unzipping the dress she took notice to what she thought was panties that she was moving to the side earlier was a teddy. She knew just by the way the stocking that Andrea had on where attached that it was a full teddy. This made Janelle even more hot and bothered, she was all getting turned on by undress Andrea but making this discovery was really make here horny. She couldn’t wait to share her little discovery with her husband. For now she was the only one that knew this secret besides Andrea.   With Andrea’s dress fully unzipped, Janelle used the same slow care to remove the dress; as Andrea did with her clothing earlier. As she slipped the dress off of Andrea’s slender shoulders, Alex stood there trying to figure out if she was wearing a full teddy or she just wearing a corset above her panties to hold up the stockings. Alex knew he would be find out the answer to his question as soon Janelle removed Andrea’s top.   Janelle thought before removing their guest top she would try and take a peak at the look on her husbands face. She wanted to see if the suspense was starting to build up in his eyes or to see if he had that look of he knew as well what Andrea was hiding under that what cotton top of hers . Janelle could see her husband had that some what puzzled look about him and was in did waiting for her to get on with the show.  She was satisfied by the look that was one his face and went back to what she was doing. Janelle whispered sweetly into Andrea’s ear Could you help me out by lifting you arms up, that way I can slip you top off easier. Andrea complied simply by raising up her arms, allowing Janelle take off her top.   With both the dress and shirt off the mystery of is she wearing a corset or a teddy was solved. Alex stood there with jaw about to hit the floor. For Andrea stood there in an all most all lace black teddy. It was all most all lace expect for the sides in the front had teal green ribbons woven in it and the was a small teal green bow right in the middle of it. Alex was blown away at how the teddy just seemed to hug every last curve of her body. Janelle was equally impressed by Andrea’s wonderful body that was hiding under the dress.

						   Alex was brought back to reality really quick, by the simple fact that Janelle cum soaked panties hit right square in the face. He jumped up high do to the fact that he was deep into thought and was excepting to be hit in the face with a pair of panties. There for being pulled back to reality and out of his deep train of thought. After get his bearings he bent down and picked up his wife’s panties which Andrea threw at him like a little prize. He placed the panties in his back pocket and started looking at his wife stand there in her stunning beauty.   Andrea got a smile on her face and asked Alex “Its nice to see that you are still with us over there”. Alex placed a faked smile on his face to try and hide the pain for the women the last thing he wanted to do was show he was buckling under the pressure building up in his pants. He simply replied to Andrea that he was sorry that he mind kind of wonder off there for a sec doing the wonderful show, and that he promised wouldn’t happen again.   Janelle turned around to Andrea with a loving look on her face, said shall we continue what we started. Andrea reply back that yep they should continue if everyone is ready and willing then I am game. She glanced over at Alex as she said the last few words. Both James and Janelle said they where ready and willing. Alex even agreed to no more drifting off into outer space again.  With that said Janelle walked back over to Alex and gave him a French kiss and afterwards she whispered into his ear “ Hope you are enjoying your gift dear”. Alex just stood there and shook his head yes. As she was walking away and getting ready to go back over to Andrea, Janelle played with Alex just a little bit to tease him. With her back turned to him Alex just gave her that you big tease kind look. Andrea felt that on some level that Janelle was reading her mind. She was really hoping that Janelle would step up and take the ropes for a little. All in all she was glad to see that Janelle was making the effort to make Alex squirm and suffer a little bit.   Janelle pondered how to start undressing Andrea on the her short but what seemed to be long walk to the other side of the room, where Andrea was standing and waiting for her. She thought that she might as well do to Andrea what was done to her. But she wanted to put her own spin on things. How do it and everything was alluding her all together. She thought that all in good time there would be a chance to be creative. So she let the idea past for the moment.

						   Andrea was pleased at how Alex’s lower half was standing to attention; just waiting more or less begging to be sucked and played with. She started to ponder in her head what to do about Alex and his problem; all the while she was removing each leg slowly from his jeans. All the while Alex was enjoying the freedom from the pressure that was building down there. He still had pressure that need to be released, it was a different type of pressure he had that was building up. This kind of pressure is the sexual kind that boils up when a man gets all hot and bothered. The kind that can’t be relived by a woman or by the man himself. Given he must pop in a porn video and whack it off . All an all Alex was just grateful to finally be out of his pants.  With pants and boxes completed removed and a little bit of Alex’s pressures was removed Andrea slowly crept up on he knee and started to work on the other pressure Alex had pent up inside. She gently grasped Alex’s cock in her hand and sloe but carefully lowered it into her mouth. She ever so lovingly moved head back and forth type motion of sucking on his cock, all the while playing with Alex’s balls. James started to get into Andrea going do on him. He reached down and gently caressed her hair with his one hand and started to fondle her one breast with the other one.

Holm  Finished First Draft - 8-22-03  FADE IN: EXT: Triad City - Evening The scene opens up on a shot of a neo-futuristic city; grand in design and technology, but showing more than a few signs of decay and spoiling. (Kind of a cross between the "Delta City" Project from RoboCop, and Gotham City.) This is Triad City. The camera pans along the streets of Triad City, until coming upon a large corner building. The camera then sweeps upward along the side of the building until it reaches a massive shining neon-lit sign. The image of a large white bird incased in a circle, and underneath, in all-caps "CRANE INDUSTRIES." The camera sweeps past the sign to a large set of plate-glass windows that show into a large, opulent office. A man stands at the window, watching the lights of the city begin to blink on. INT. Hargrove Crane’s Office – Evening Hargrove Crane, 65, stares out the window of his high-rise office, surveying his empire. He is tired, bitter and impatient with life. He sips slowly from the glass of single malt whisky in his hand. A door opens across the room. A young man enters. CRANE How did the meeting go, Denis? The young man, Denis Crane, 32, his son, walks over to the bar and pours himself a drink. He is very agitated. DENIS I’m glad you didn’t go to the meeting, Dad. It was a nightmare… An absolute nightmare. Crane stares intently at the cityscape that will no longer be his to survey. DENIS You were right, Dad. It was worse than anyone could have imagined. CRANE How much are we standing to lose? Denis downs the remainder of his drink in one swig. DENIS All of it. The entire company is to be liquidated. Lou Davenport specifically made a point of saying that nothing would please him more than wiping Crane Industries off the map. The arrogant son of a bitch even grinned at me when he said it. Crane lowers his head and sighs deeply. CRANE All that hard work, time and money… Everything that we ever worked and strived for in life… Gone. Denis walks over to his father and puts his hand on his shoulder. CRANE This company was one of the first businesses in Triad City. Hell, it was a business even before there was such a thing as Triad City. Ours is a rich history, and now, that’s gone. Davenport knows what this company means to the history and heritage of this city. He worked here for 15 years. DENIS Bastards like Davenport don’t care about history and tradition. Even when he worked here, it was obvious that he had no loyalty to this company or anything it might have represented to the world, at large. He’s just another vulture who wants as much profit as he can pick away from us, regardless of the cost to those involved. CRANE And the board of directors went along with this? DENIS Yeah… Just like you thought they would. Goddamn Judas Iscariots, all of them. Promise them several fat wads of cash and blowjobs from 19-year old cheerleaders, and they would have signed over the goddamn moon, if they could. Crane says nothing. He continues to watch the city. DENIS Traitorous old bastards… I’d like to… Crane turns around sharply. CRANE Those traitorous old bastards were the ones who kept this company afloat during the times when profits were short and situations were dire. They are decent old men who deserve far more respect than you’re showing them, Denis. Denis makes to say something in retort, but find he cannot. His father’s gaze, while tired, is still formidable enough to command unwavering obedience from his son. CRANE But, sometimes… Even decent, respected old men get senile. They don’t know what they’re doing. Crane sits down at his antique desk. He stares intently at the blotter. CRANE It’s a goddamn shame that modern business requires its participants to slaughter and devour the ailing of the group, son. He downs the rest of his whisky, and grips the glass tight. He looks up at Denis with a lean and hungry look in his eyes. CRANE But it also requires that sometimes we have to play extremely dirty in order to stay out of the hyenas’ jaws. Denis nods. CRANE Now… Let’s figure out how we keep our company out of Davenport’s dirty mouth. INT. Crane Industries Hallway – Night Crane and Denis stride down the plush, refined hallway. CRANE Now, whatever happens, we’re going to need to distance ourselves as much as possible from this. The last thing we need is to get hung by our own ropes, when we’ve got so much at stake. DENIS Naturally. CRANE What we need is to find a couple of patsies. Someone we can distance ourselves from entirely, if the shit does indeed hit the fan. DENIS Some junior executives, you mean? Shit-can them, then lay all the blame on them, if everything goes to hell? CRANE Of course. What’s two shlubs who will never get anywhere in life compared to the future of this company? We can lay some cockamamie story about how they must have did it all as a way to try to get back into our good graces again. DENIS It’s brilliant. They turn into a large room dotted with a multitude of buzzing cubicles. DENIS Shall I? Or, would you like to do the honors? CRANE Be my guest, son. INT. Hargrove Crane’s Office – Evening Two very young men stand side by side in Cranes office. Their names are Troy Losey and David Diederich. They are both in their mid-twenties, dressed in rather cheap suits and both look scared out of their wits. Crane sits behind his desk. Denis stands behind Crane. Both have big, shark-like smiles on their faces. Denis motions towards the chairs in front of Crane’s desk. DENIS Won’t you both care to sit down? Both tentatively move towards the chairs and slowly sit down. Neither of them take their eyes off of Crane and Denis. Crane motions to a box on the corner of his desk. CRANE Cigar? Either of you? Both look at the cigar box as if it’s a coiled rattlesnake. Finally, Losey, speaks. LOSEY I… I don’t smoke. Crane opens the box. CRANE Well, I’ll have one. He lights the cigar and takes a couple of puffs on it. He watches the smoke rise for a moment, then suddenly… CRANE BOO! Diederich and Losey nearly fly out of their seats. Crane and Denis laugh. Diederich and Losey begin to meekly chuckle. DENIS You boys are way too tense. Relax. We’re not going to bite you…. Well, I won’t. I don’t know about my dad, though… Crane makes a growling noise and utters a couple of ridiculous-sounding barks. All four of them laugh at this. CRANE Good… You’re loosening up. That’s just what we wanted to see… Denis, go fetch these fine young men each a drink. Denis saunters over to the bar and pours a two glasses of scotch. He walks back over and casually hands the glasses to Diederich and Losey who take them, nervously. Denis picks his glass up and raises it in a mild toast. DENIS Chin-Chin. He takes a drink. Both Diederich and Losey make half-assed return raises and drink their whiskey. Losey chokes slightly. DENIS Now… I’ll bet you guys are wondering why we called you up here, aren’t you? Both nod nervously. DENIS Well, the truth is, we’ve seen you two at work, and we think that you both have that special something that we need for a certain secret project. Diederich and Losey look at each other and then both look at their glasses. DENIS This project… It’s very important to the future of Crane Industries, and could very well mean even greater things for the both of you, should it succeed. Now, there are some risks involved… Both stare nervously at Denis. Denis laughs. DENIS Don’t worry, Fellas… There’s no health risk. Your hair isn’t going to fall out and your dicks aren’t going to shrivel up. All we’re requiring from you is a little hard work and ingenuity. CRANE Now, we know you boys will want to do your best for Crane Industries, because it’s given you both so much, hasn’t it? Both nod emphatically. A little too emphatically. Crane pretends not to notice this. CRANE I can promise you both nothing but the best, if this project succeeds. Money, promotions, houses, cars, pools, women… Oh-ho-HO! Women!!! Crane presses a buzzer and speaks into an intercom. CRANE Michelle? Dominique? Would both of you come in here for a moment, please? A side door to the office opens up and two women of astounding beauty walk in. They walk up to Crane’s desk and drape themselves sensuously over it, in clear view of Diederich and Losey. Crane grins wide-eyed at them. CRANE Nice, huh? You like? Diederich and Losey stare glassy-eyed at the two gorgeous women. CRANE I’ll take that as a yes. (To girls) Thank you, Ladies. That will be all. Both women walk back out of the room. DENIS Now, about this project… DIEDERICH Yes! Yes! Oh, God, yes… Losey merely nods his head. CRANE Good… Good… That’s just what I wanted to hear. DENIS We want your total commitment on this, Gentlemen. This task is extremely important and could mean the end of the company, should you fail. He leans in between the two men and pulls their heads towards his. DENIS I want to know if we can count on you. DIEDERICH Y-yes sir. LOSEY Sure. Denis slaps them both on the shoulders. DENIS Great! He resumes his original place behind his father. Both have that shark-like look in their eyes again. DENIS Here’s what we want you to do… We want you to kill Lou Davenport, his executive staff and the board of directors for this company. Diederich’s and Losey’s eyes widen to the size of dinner plates. DIEDERICH You… what?! CRANE You heard him. We want them dead. Any way you want to kill them, it makes no difference to us. DENIS Just so long as they’re all worm food by Friday. Diederich continues to stare bug-eyed at the two of them. Losey just sits there mouthing words that make no sound. Crane’s and Denis’ shark-like visages turn to sympathetic looks of understanding. CRANE Oh, boys… Boys… Don’t worry. We’re fully prepared to cover for you on this. Trust us… You won’t get caught. Diederich and Losey look completely freaked out. Crane focuses on them with that piercing, authoritative gaze, and speaks quietly, but firmly. CRANE Gentlemen, what this all comes down to is that Crane Industries is in grave danger of dying out. Lou Davenport and his lackeys from Liberation, Incorporated are looking to descend up Crane and suck out everything that they can make a profit from, like a goddamn vampire, and then get rid of the rest. No one will be safe from their cuts, and nothing will be spared. We’ll all be out on the street before the end of the week, unless… DENIS Unless, you both come to the rescue of the company. The board of directors is meeting with Davenport and his staff on Friday, to finialize the deal. We want you to make sure that nobody comes out of that meeting, and that all paperwork is destroyed. CRANE You’re backed by the whole of Crane Industries. You won’t even see a single police car… Inside or out. We’ll provide you with whatever tools or resources you need… Just so long as you complete the task you’ve agreed to. Both of them stare at Crane and Denis like they’re insane. DENIS A promise is a promise, Gentlemen. You swore a commitment to my father and myself. We expect you to live up to it. Crane puffs on his cigar. CRANE Think of what Michelle and Dominique would think if you disappointed us… Diederich puts his head down in his hands and mulls this over. Losey downs the rest of his drink, as well as Diederich’s. DIEDERICH All right! We’ll do it! CRANE AND DENIS Wonderful. INT. Crane Industries Hallway – Night Diederich and Losey are walking down the hall. Losey looks like he’s going to vomit. Diederich looks almost as bad. DIEDERICH I can’t believe I said yes. LOSEY I can’t believe you said yes for me. DIEDERICH Still… It can’t be that difficult. I mean, look… Out of everyone in the entire company, they picked us. They obviously felt like we were the right guys for the job. We can do this.. LOSEY Yeah… You’re right. We can do this. DIEDERICH Then, it’s giant fucking paychecks, executive washrooms, and Dominique in my bed every goddamn night. (punches the air) YES! LOSEY Hey, I called "dibs" on Dominique. DIEDERICH No you didn’t. I called "dibs." Besides, I specifically saw you checking out Michelle. LOSEY No, I wasn’t. DIEDERICH Well, why weren’t you? Did you see the ass on that girl? LOSEY Oh, yeah… INT. Hargrove Crane’s Office – Evening Crane and Denis are laughing it up. Both have a glass of whiskey and a cigar. Michelle and Domonique are back in the room and draped over each of the men. CRANE Oh, Son… That was priceless… I wish we could do that every day. DENIS Yeah… Did you see the look on the one guy’s face… (Mimicking Diederich) "You… WHAT?!" Both laugh uproariously. DENIS Mark my words… We play them well enough, and we could blame the Chicago fires, the Holocaust, and the crucifixion on them, too! FADE OUT FADE IN EXT. Cohee’s Parking Lot – Night The camera is brought back up in the parking lot of a Denny’s-esque family restaurant. The illuminated sign reads "COHEE’S FAMILY RESTAURANT – AMERICA’S #1 FULLY AUTOMATED EATERY." Yet, for being #1, there aren’t very many cars parked in the lot. Closer inspection of the eatery shows us that Losey and Diederich are seated in a windowed booth. They’re eating a late dinner and talking animatedly. LOSEY This is insane, Dave. We’re never going to pull this off. DIEDERICH What are you so worried about? You heard Crane. We’ve got the entire company at our disposal to deal with it. Quit whining. We’ll be fine. He takes a bite of his omelet. DIEDERICH (mouth full) Besides… How hard would it be to kill a room full of people anyway? A little old lady a couple of booths away casts them an odd glance. Losey’s eyes get about as big as they were in Crane’s office. LOSEY JESUS CHRIST! Would you keep your voice down? DIEDERICH What? Are you worried that guy’s gonna stop us? (points to a shaggy, disheveled cycloptic man in a nearby booth) Or him? (points to a fat, slug-like thing eating a massive, salsa-covered omelette) Or her? (points to the sour-faced old lady gawking at them) He laughs. Losey stares incredulously at him. DIEDERICH Jesus, would you relax? (he leans in and talks softly) Look… I picked this place to talk about it for a good reason. For one, it’s one of the safer places in the world to discuss the project without anybody listening. These people? (waves his arms to indicate everyone in the room) These people could give a fuck what we’re talking about. For all they know or care, we could be rehearsing lines from a fucking play. Losey nods. DIEDERICH (continuing) Also, this place is owned by a restaurant franchising company, called Bluebird Eateries. Now, do you know who happens to own Bluebird Eateries? LOSEY Your mother. Diederich rolls his eyes. DIEDERICH What are you, a fourth grader? He smacks Losey in the forehead. DIEDERICH Crane Industries. CRANE FUCKING INDUSTRIES. We couldn’t be in a safer place to talk. LOSEY Yeah, but… DIEDERICH (cutting in) ALSO… I picked this place, because the place is totally automated. The only living, breathing biological entity that works here is the maintenance technician who comes in, once a month, to make sure everything is in working order. Otherwise, the place is 100 percent run by robots. He motions to a gorgeous redhead in a waitress uniform, smiling brightly and pouring coffee for the slug with the salsa and omelette. DIEDERICH If our waitress over there comes by to fill up our coffee, and we’re screaming at the top of our lungs about putting a hollow-point bullet straight into Joe Blow’s fucking brain, she’s just smile, ask us if we need anything else and go on to the next table. She won’t snitch to the cops. She won’t tell her buddies in the back. Because behind those pretty green eyes and incredible ass, she’s just a machine. She doesn’t give a fuck about anything, because she’s nothing more than a goddamn walking coffee decanter. Losey’s eyes suddenly brighten. If there were a light bulb hovering over his head, it would be flashing on, suddenly. LOSEY Just a machine… DIEDERICH What? LOSEY Just a machine… Losey laughs… It’s not so much a mirthful laugh, as an "I’ve just had the idea of the century, and I can’t believe it" laugh. DIEDERICH What the hell are you laughing about? LOSEY I’ve just figured it out. DIEDERICH Figured what out? What the fuck are you talking about? LOSEY This. Losey suddenly knocks Diederich’s coffee over. It spills all over the table and splashes onto Diederich’s suit. DIEDERICH Hey! What the fuck are…? LOSEY Shut up and keep quiet. Losey motions to the waitress to come over. LOSEY Oh Miss? Could you come over here for a second? The waitress walks over to their table. She is breathtakingly beautiful; appearing to be in her early twenties, with gorgeous skin, shoulder-length red hair, brilliant green eyes, and an incredible smile. She looks down and smiles warmly at Losey and Diederich. WAITRESS Can I help you, Gentlemen? LOSEY Yeah… We’ve, uh.. My friend, here, had a bit of an accident with his coffee. She casts a look of pleasant sympathy towards Diederich, who is scowling at Losey. WAITRESS Of course. Let me clean that right up and I’ll get a you a fresh cup, Sir. DIEDERICH (Through gritted teeth) Thanks. She wipes up the mess quickly. LOSEY Oh, Miss? You missed a spot. WAITRESS Oh? Where? LOSEY Back here. He indicates a small puddle, no bigger than a quarter on the far end of the table. The Waitress smiles happily. WAITRESS Yes, Sir. Happy to please. LOSEY Thank you so much. She reaches to the far end of the table to wipe up the coffee spot. As she reaches, Losey reaches around behind her back and presses own on the back of her neck. She makes a whirring noise and slumps down onto the tabletop. Losey quickly glances to Diederich. LOSEY Quick, Dave! Help me get her up and out of here! DIEDERICH What the hell did you just… LOSEY Shut up and pick her up, for Christ’s sake! He stands up and addresses the gawking diners. LOSEY It’s all right, Folks. Nothing to worry about. We’re with the company. We heard that this unit was malfunctioning and we’re going to take it in and have it serviced. He grabs one of the arms and helps Diederich quickly drag the waitress out the door. The diners continue to stare blankly at the door. EXT: Triad City Street – Night A car speeds down the busy streets of Triad City. Troy Losey is behind the wheel. Diederich sits next to him, looking just as incredulous as Losey had in the diner. INT: Losey’s car - Night DIEDERICH What the hell did we just do? LOSEY WE just found the solution to our problems. DIEDERICH What the fuck are you talking about? LOSEY OK… I got to thinking. Remember that huge fucking research project that Bob Griffin sandbagged us with about 6 months ago? DIEDERICH Yeah…? It was a pain in the ass load of busy-work, as I recall… LOSEY Exactly. Now, remember how we made sure it got done? DIEDERICH We talked Purinton and Seger into doing it all. LOSEY Right. Now, look at our situation now… How is this any different? Diederich stares at him blankly. LOSEY Jesus, Dave… Do I have to spell it out to you? DIEDERICH Purinton and Seger? Losey smacks him upside the head. LOSEY No! This! (Motions to the backseat) This is our Purinton and Seger! DIEDERICH What, you mean the robot? Are you crazy? LOSEY Not at all! Look, you, yourself, said that it was a machine. A machine does what it is programmed to do. DIEDERICH Yeah? LOSEY So, we program it to kill those people. It does all the work, and we sit back and reap the rewards. Just like Purinton and Seger. Only this time, it won’t cost us a case of whiskey and 200 bucks. Diederich sits back and takes all this in… DIEDERICH Troy, you are a genius! Losey looks excessively proud of himself. LOSEY Yes… Yes, I am… DIEDERICH There is one problem, though… LOSEY What’s that? DIEDERICH Who do we know that can do that kind of programming? And what about equipment for that kind of a job? Now, I don’t know about you, Troy, but I don’t happen to know any arms dealers that can reprogram androids! Losey smiles slyly. LOSEY One step ahead of you, mi amigo… EXT: Triad City Street – Night The car speeds off into the night. EXT: Pot of Gold Gun & Pawn Storefront – Night Diederich and Losey park in front of a storefront lit by a large, flickering-neon sign that reads "POT OF GOLD GUN &amp; PAWN." There is a large graphic of a black cauldron imprinted with a white dollar sign and overflowing with gold. Losey runs inside. He walks back out, shortly, with a thin, weasily man in his mid-twenties. He’s dressed in jeans and a wife-beater undershirt, and sports a mop of untidy, bleached-blond hair, a week’s growth of beard stubble and black sunglasses. His arms are wiry and tattooed. This is Ernie Bishop. He gazes into the back-seat of the car at the deactivated android. He lowers his sunglasses. One of his eyes has no pigmentation. BISHOP Hmmm… Where the hell did you get a Cohee’s waitress droid, Troy? TROY I’d rather not say, Ernie. It’s better off if we kept a lot of these details on the hush, if you know what I mean. Bishop crinkles his nose, pushes his shades back up, turns around, and walks back towards the shop. BISHOP OK, Losey. You and your girlfriend can bring the ‘bot inside. My sister can look it over for you. Losey and Diederich unload the android from the back seat and carry her inside. INT: Pot of Gold Gun & Pawn sale floor - Night The store is a bit of a hole in the wall. Various odds and ends are littered on shelves and racks of varying sizes. There’s a sign on the wall, which reads, "NO, WE DON’T HAVE ANY DAMN POKEMON CARDS." Bishop crosses the floor to a set of double doors, marked "Employees Only." Diedreich and Losey stumble in, half-carrying, half-dragging the cumbersome waitress android, which lolls around like a corpse. They lug her to the counter and heave her down onto the countertop. DIEDERICH How in the fuck do you know this guy? LOSEY Eh… I met him in college. DIEDERICH Guys like that actually go to college? LOSEY Yeah. The guy’s a fucking genius at robotics. The problem is he’s such an insufferable asshole that nobody wants to work with him. BISHOP (O/C) I heard that. LOSEY (calling out) Just calling it like I see it, Ernie. BISHOP (O/C) Fuck you. The employees only doors swing open and Bishop walks back out, carrying a large red metal toolbox. Following him is his sister, Rosie, a very attractive woman with long, blonde hair and wearing a pair of red safety goggles atop her magnificent head… At least, she’s a woman from the waist up. Her lower half is a mess of wire and metal, attached to a small, bulky tank-like base. She coasts forward to the counter and smiles at Losey and Diederich. ROSIE Good evening, Gentlemen. Ernie tells me you want to retrofit an android. ROSIE Ooh, I see… A food service drone. (She smirks) Interesting choice. She rolls the android on its side, and runs her finger along the line of her neck. A small whirring sound is heard and the skin around the neck seems to dissolve to reveal a small rectangle. She gently pushes down on the rectangle, and it pops open like a lid, revealing a unit identification number, a small data drive, and a few flashing lights. ROSIE Hmmm… Universal Improvement Industries Food Service Drone, unit LY491. That’s good. One thing you can say about the U.I.I. units, their bodies are quite adaptable to tinkering around with. She closes the lid and runs her finger down the original path she made to open the panel. The lines disappear and the skin appears to have not had a single mark in it at all. ROSE I love this dura-skin they’re putting on these things, anymore. The stuff can stop a bullet, feels warm to the touch like real skin and still allows for easy access for repairs and modifications. If you look at the crappy old stuff they used to put on androids, you can see… Bishop sighs impatiently and interrupts her. BISHOP (cutting in) If you’re done fawning over Little Miss Clockwork, Rosie… We’ll get down to business. (to Losey &amp; Diederich) What all are you wanting done on this damn thing? DIEDERICH Guns. Lots of Guns. The kind of stuff that can clear a room out in less than a minute. LOSEY Not to mention the knowledge of how to use them. The last thing we need is her waltzing into the room, armed to the teeth, then not knowing what the hell she’s supposed to do with all that hardware. BISHOP Sounds like you’ve got a serious mean-on for somebody, Losey. LOSEY This? Nah… This is business. Bishop shrugs and lights a cigarette. BISHOP You do realize that the modifications that you’re wanting made to this android are, for the most part, quite illegal, correct? How do I know that we’re not going to wind up with our asses… (He casts a glance at Rosie.) Well, MY ass in a sling. I don’t know what the hell they’d put her in… She smacks him upside the head. BISHOP Anyway, it’d be the shits if we got caught being tied to this, if you get my drift. Do we have anything to be worrying about, Losey? LOSEY Nope. I can guarantee it. There’s no paperwork being tied to this. Nothing will lead back to either of you. BISHOP Good. That’s real good, Troy. And on the subject payment? DIEDERICH Cash. Name your price. You can practically see the dollar signs light up in Bishop’s eyes. LOSEY The catch is that this is a seriously rushed job, Folks. I mean, really rushed. We need it ready to roll by Friday morning. ROSIE Not a problem. I work fast. LOSEY Great. We’ll be in touch, Ernie. BISHOP Yeah. We will. Losey and Diederich walk out. EXT: Pot of Gold Gun & Pawn Storefront – Night DIEDERICH I don’t trust that oily fucker one iota. LOSEY I don’t either. Fortunately, he’s greedy and egotistical. It’ll have a massive fucking price tag on it, but it’ll definitely be quality work. Anything less would make him feel like he might look bad. DIEDERICH It better be. A lot more is riding on this shit than his reputation. They get in the car and drive away. INT: Pot of Gold Gun &amp; Pawn sale floor - Night Standing by the caged-in window, Bishop watches them drive away. He then proceeds to dance all the way up to the front counter and plants a huge wet kiss on the android’s mouth. BISHOP Ooh, you beautiful little cash cow! You are going to make me so much money… Rosie looks concerned. ROSIE I’m a little worried about this, Ernie. BISHOP About what? Since when were you concerned about the occasional jack-off getting a pill in the head? We’re getting paid for it not to be our problem. ROSIE It’s not that… It’s just that reprogramming a cybernetic brain, once its primary operating system has been initialized, is tricky business. There’s a self-extracting directive that formulates itself in each droid’s mind, which makes up its personality and dictates who it becomes and what it does. I don’t care how skillful you may think you are… Trying to go in with some fancy new program and change it out seriously fucks up the unit’s mind. And I mean SERIOUSLY. I’ve seen it, first-hand. That’s like going into a flesh and blood person’s brain with a screwdriver to try and change their personality... It’s just not something that can be done quickly or easily. Hell, they’re STILL trying to perfect the process. No one’s really been able to pinpoint exactly why this happens. Bishop flashes her an irritated glance. BISHOP And your point is…? ROSIE My point is that a week couldn’t be enough time to rewrite the droid’s entire brain. A few months.. Maybe a year, and maybe we might be able to do it… But five days is not only impossible, it’s insane. BISHOP So we won’t fuck with its brain if we don’t have to. We’ll just dump the new directive in and call it good. ROSIE We can do that. That’s little more than a simple directive switch. I’ll need the program for that, though. I don’t have anything like that on hand. BISHOP I’ll get it. Don’t worry. ROSIE There is one small problem, though… BISHOP And that is…? ROSIE Well, it will still be running on its old operating system. Have you ever heard the saying, "You can take the girl out of the country, but you can’t take the country out of the girl?" This is the same principle. It’s true that U.I.I. droids are easy to modify, and we can arm this waitress droid to the teeth and give her the programming to kill, kill, kill, but that’s like taking a nanny drone, attaching a jackhammer to it, and putting it to work doing construction. BISHOP But it will work, right? ROSIE Oh, yeah. We can make her into a killer, easy. But she’ll be the nicest, sweetest, most considerate killer you ever laid eyes on. Bishop takes a long drag and then smashed out the cigarette in the already-overflowing ashtray on the counter. BISHOP Then let them deal with that. We’re just getting paid to make Little Miss Sunshine here into Charlie fuckin’ Manson. Let them deal with whether or not she tries to clean up the mess after she splatters some poor fuck’s brains all over the wall. That isn’t our problem, Sis. Rosie shrugs. ROSIE Well, when you’re right, you’re right. BISHOP Of course I am. Now, c’mon… We’ve got work to do. FADE OUT FADE IN: EXT: Triad City Street – Day Losey buys a hot dog from a street corner vendor. He takes a bite from it, and dials a number on a nearby pay phone. Diederich stands nearby, watching. LOSEY (Into phone) Hey, it’s me. How’s our little girl doing? INT: Pot of Gold Gun & Pawn back room – Day Bishop is on the other end of the line. He’s seated at a workbench with working on an arm connected to a computer. The monitor reads a series of diagnostic reports off. The fingers of the hand attached to the arm flex and extend. The arm occasionally bends and straightens. BISHOP (Into phone) Doing all right. She’s growing up considerably faster and better than even I thought she was going to. LOSEY (from phone) Good. Wonderful. Will she be ready by Friday? BISHOP (Into phone) Well before then. Bishop types a series of keys, and a small hatch opens up in the wrist of the arm. A rectangular box clacks out of the hatch and pops open, to reveal it’s a small pistol. The pistol is caught in the hand and the arm straightens, as if to aim. The trigger is pulled, although nothing happens but a series of clicks. The gun then flings the gun away. It clatters across the room. ROSIE (O/C) Dammit, Ernie, will you watch what you’re doing! Bishop smirks. BISHOP (Into phone) Like now. He types another set of keys, and a knife suddenly flips out from within the housings of the arm, and stops at palm level. The hand closes around the handle of the knife and proceeds to slash and jab with it. BISHOP (Into phone) We’ll have her ready to … The arm swings wild, and knocks a bottle of beer into his lap. BISHOP SHIT! He frantically tries to mop up the mess. BISHOP (hurriedly, into phone) She’s ready to go. I’ll wire you with the place to meet and the fee. He hangs it up and resumes mopping up the spilled beer. BISHOP Dammit… EXT: Triad City Street - Day Losey hangs up the phone. He nudges Diederich and they both walk off. FADE IN: INT: Warehouse - Day Bishop and Rosie both wait in the middle of an empty, expansive warehouse. There’s a honk that echos across the expansion. The doors on the far end of the building open automatically, and Losey’s car drives in. The car pulls up to them and parks. Diederich and Losey get out. Diederich is carrying a large case. Losey looks around the empty warehouse. LOSEY Well? Where is she? BISHOP Let’s see the green, first. Diederich slides the case across the filthy cement floor to Bishop. He picks it up and opens it. The case is bursting to the gills with cash. He shuts the case, and turns toward a delivery truck parked behind them. The truck door opens, and the waitress droid steps out. Instead of her Cohee’s uniform, she’s wearing a pair of cutoffs, a T-shirt, and scuffed work boots. She saunters over to them and smiles warmly. WAITRESS Hi there! Can I get anyone anything? Coffee? Tea? One of Cohee’s delicious homestyle muffins? DIEDERICH Hold on! She’s still in waitress mode! BISHOP Relax, Sugar… It’s just the android’s standard operating system. Don’t worry, she gets the job done just fine. LOSEY What’s with the outfit? ROSIE Easier access to the armaments. Ajax? Slats in either side of her outer thighs open up, revealing two holsters, bearing a pair of shining pistols. She draws them, and twirls them on her fingers. The slats close up again. LOSEY What did you just call her? BISHOP Ajax. I thought it was appropriate, considering she’s getting rid of a bunch of stains. Bishop motions towards a set of targets set up on a far wall. Ajax turns and fires repeatedly at the targets. Perfect head shots each time. Then, perfect dead-center chest shots. Then, perfect groin shots. BISHOP We’ve also got her equipped for melee fighting. She runs at a man-shaped punching bag, slung from a rafter. She proceeds to beat the living crap out of it. A well-placed kick causes the chain holding the dummy to snap, and the dummy goes flying. Blades ejects from her wrists and she pounces onto the prone dummy. She slashes the wrists and throat of the dummy. Sand pours out. She jabs both knives into the mid-section of the dummy and slashes upward. Sand erupts from the gash in a tidal wave. BISHOP She’s equipped with twin pistols and bayonets, as you’ve already seen. She also is capable of street-brawling tactics, as well as several different styles of martial arts. Not to mention knowledge on how to use most conventional weapons, as well as an improvisational program that I wrote personally for her, for some not-so-conventional weapons. He tosses a box of thumbtacks at her. She catches the box and proceeds to hurl the tacks at a nearby wall with such velocity that they embed themselves deep. DIEDERICH Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. ROSIE She’s also been equipped with a scanner blocker, which can fool most id scanners and metal detectors. Scanners will register her as completely human, without a single weapon on her. Guard dogs won’t be able to tell the difference, either. LOSEY Excellent work. You both earned every cent. BISHOP Of course. You were expecting a half-assed job from someone as brilliant and talented as me? DIEDERICH We’ll need to stash her someplace until she’s ready. That way, we aren’t seen near her before or after she does the job. BISHOP She can stay here. Just give her the info of where and when, and she’ll take care of the rest. LOSEY Beautiful. Check the pocket of the case. Rosie opens up the case, and produces a disc. She examines it for a moment. ROSIE This’ll work. LOSEY Great. We’ll take our leave of you three, then. Thanks again, Ernie. You came through like a pro. BISHOP No shit, Sherlock. Now, get out of here. Diederich and Losey get in their car and drive off. Bishop watches them leave, then looks to Rosie. BISHOP It’s all in there, right? No phone books under a layer of bills? ROSIE Nope. They paid it all. Frankly, I’m amazed, considering the price you asked for. BISHOP That’s because they’re stupid and desperate. He glances over at Ajax, who’s building a sandcastle out of the sand from the dummy. BISHOP She’s kind of loopy… Haven’t you noticed that? ROSIE I don’t know. I think it’s kind of cute, really. Bishop sighs in disgust. BISHOP You would. ROSIE Anyway, it’s nothing to worry about. You get these occasional personality quirks like that when you do a rush job reformatting their programming. She’ll still get the job done, no problem. BISHOP Whatever. It’s not like I’ll ever have to deal with her ever again, after tonight. Let’s upload the data they gave us into Little Miss Sunshine and get out of here. We’ve got cars and houses to buy. INT. Hargrove Crane’s Office – Day Losey and Diederich sit opposite Crane and Denis. They look confident and poised… Much different than their last meeting. LOSEY We just wanted to let you both know that the project is a definite go. DIEDERICH We just witnessed a demonstration, this afternoon, and I can tell you right now, that this is going to work perfectly. DENIS Excellent. We can’t afford any hitches or mistakes. LOSEY Not to worry. It’s all been taken care of. CRANE And there will be no ties back to any of us? DIEDERICH Not a one. Guaranteed. CRANE Excellent, boys. I can’t wait to see what happens. I almost wish I could be there, but I imagine that would be rather ill-advised, to say the least. All laugh. DENIS One thing’s for sure, I sure wouldn’t want to be in Lou Davenport’s shoes… He drains the rest of his scotch. EXT: Patio - Night Cut to a middle-aged man soaking in a hot tub with two naked beauties. He’s sporting a bronze tan, slicked-back hair and the look of someone who’s loaded. He laughs heartily as he puffs on a cigar. This is Lou Davenport. Swanky music plays in the background, as he drinks martinis. One lovely nibbles on his earlobe, and the other kisses his neck. Suddenly, he stops laughing and his face goes slack. The cigar falls from his mouth into the tub. He goes rigid and clutches his chest, then falls face-first into the tub. The girls scream. INT. Hargrove Crane’s Office – Day Close-Up on newspaper front page, which reads "Business Mogul Davenport Dies in Hot Tub." The subhead reads "Congestive heart failure ruled cause." Panning out reveals that Crane is reading the paper. Denis looms over his shoulder, also reading the article. CRANE Talk about divine justice. DENIS So,where does the buyout stand, now? CRANE I think we can turn this thing around to your advantage. Liberation will be in disarray now that Davenport’s gone, and we can bully the Board of Directors back into our fold. Unless some act of God happens, we’re going to come out on top. DENIS What about our two patsies? We’ll have to call them off. CRANE I think we’ll have to do more than call them off… Their role in this situation is nothing more than a liability to us, now. This current situation calls for a bit more extreme measures to ensure stability. DENIS Easy enough to take care of. EXT: Triad City Street – Day Losey and Diederich buy hot dogs from a street corner vendor. They get back into Losey’s car. The engine turns over. The car explodes. INT. Hargrove Crane’s Office – Day DENIS Still, they never actually told us what they were proposing to do. I told them not to tell us, as I figured that it was in our best interests not to know. CRANE Well, that was a prudent move at the time. Though it does pose a problem for use right now. We need to think about what they might have planned. DENIS As clueless as they both were, I seriously doubt that either of them was stupid enough to try and pull it off, themselves. It had to be some sort of outside connection… A hired killer, or perhaps, a bomb. CRANE Still, unless we can root out the problem, we’ll just have to bulk up security tomorrow, and hope that nothing will happen. INT. Warehouse – Morning Ajax stands motionless in the middle of the warehouse. Dawn is breaking, and the sun is beginning to shine through the filthy windows of the building. The camera rushes up to her until it’s focusing on her closed eyes. They open suddenly, with a pleasant look about them. FADE OUT FADE IN: EXT: Crane Industries - Day We are focused on the entrance of the large, gleaming Crane Industries building, when a large delivery van pulls into the frame, obscuring the camera's view. A car door is heard opening and closing and footsteps on the pavement are then heard, walking towards the back of the van. We hear the back door open and the sound of something being pulled out of the back. Footsteps are heard walking away from the van. The camera pans along the side of the van, to see the back of a shapely woman in a delivery uniform, walking towards the glass doors of the building, carrying a large box. The camera follows her into the building. INT. Office Building Lobby - Day We follow behind the delivery girl, as she walks across the busy lobby. People scurry by, lost in their own world, and would almost collide with her, if she were not already moving with catlike grace; so unusual for someone carrying a large, bulky package as she currently is. She stops in front of a large reception counter, and props the box onto the counter. It's very large and obscures the view of the receptionist behind the counter. The receptionist sighs irritatedly and looks up at the box from her paperwork. She pushes the box aside, and we get a nice big look at the face of Ajax. Her hair is partially-covered by her deliveryman's cap, save a few strands hanging down. She smiles brightly and cheerfully at the receptionist, who scowls back at her. RECEPTIONIST Yes? Can I help you? AJAX Good Morning. I'm from the Crixus Courier Company, and I have a package to deliver to a Mr. Skyler Luntz. The receptionist looks totally uninterested and irritated. The delivery girl continues her bright, sunny smiling. RECEPTIONIST Ah. Well, I'll sign for it. AJAXI'm Sorry. I’m afraid I can't do that. RECEPTIONIST Excuse me? AJAXYou see, it's Crixus' company policy for me to personally hand the package over to the intended party, and that I am to get his signature, and his signature alone, for said package. This way, the chance of the parcel being lost, stolen, damaged, delivered to the wrong person, or any other factor that might, in any way, cause tarnish to the reputation of Crixus being the world's leader in reliable, expeditious delivery of parcels, packages, documents, and whatever else that needs sending, stays one hundred and fifty percent in the clear. She smiles wide and happily. The receptionist is beginning to get very irritated with her. RECEPTIONIST And it's company policy, here at Crane Industries, as well as any other company in the known universe which has even the remotest sense of intelligence behind it, to not let anyone just waltz into it's offices with a sealed box which could very well hold something threatening. To do so would be both mind-numbingly stupid and hazardous to the well being of our employees. Ajax seems rather amused by this statement. AJAXI can assure you, there's nothing about this package, or myself, that's the least bit harmful to you or anyone else. The receptionist rolls her eyes at this. She REALLY dislikes this girl now. RECEPTIONIST Look, Miss… I've got a lot of work to do right now, a four-star migraine. What I don’t have is the patience or mood to be bothered by this crap right now. Just give me the goddamn form, and I'll sign it, and you can get this stupid thing out of here. AJAX(Still smiling brightly and maintaining an extremely pleasant tone of voice, but obviously means business) And I told you, Miss, I'm not at luxury to do so. Were I to just go ahead and allow you to sign for this package and just assume you were going to let Mr. Luntz have it, I would catch all kinds of grief from my superiors. Then, your company might get a series of angry phone calls from Crixus' main office, inquiring as to why our reputation was to be blemished, simply because you have a headache. The receptionist has had it, by this point. RECEPTIONIST Fine... Whatever... (INTO INTERCOM) Wade, could you come over here? A security guard strides over to the receptionist desk. RECEPTIONIST Wade, I need you to escort this woman through the detector, then, if she's clear, escort her up to Mr. Luntz's office? See that she's quick. I don't want her wandering around here any longer than she needs to be. Wade nods dutifully, then motions to Ajax to follow him. She does and cheerfully waves goodbye to the receptionist, who scowls at her. INT. - Security Office Screening Room - day WADE Put the box on the scanner table and then stand in the red circle on that platform over there, please. AJAXI know the procedure. She gently sets the box down on a large metal table, positioned in the middle of the room, then walks up a small set of steps into a large glass tube. She stands in the middle of a red circle, positioned in the middle of the floor of the tube. Wade walks into a small windowed enclosure off to the side and shuts the door behind him. Lights turn on and the sound of machinery starts resounding softly in the room. WADE (VIA INTERCOM) I imagine you go through this sort of thing a lot, working for Crixus and everything. AJAX (VIA INTERCOM) Occasionally. It's usually the big corporations that give you the most hassles about doing the job. The Mom and Pop places aren't nearly so jittery. Though I do understand the necessity of such a process. I mean, no one wants to get blown up or anything, do they? Wade chuckles. He's obviously taken with her. WADE (VIA INTERCOM) No, I don't imagine they do. OK, I'm initiating the scanning process... (BEAT) Now. The room turns a soft shade of blue as two long, jointed metal tubes descend from a large device attached to the ceiling. The ends of the tubes dart around frantically over the boxes as small beams of light trace out patterns of the box's contents. Two similar tubes decent from the top of the glass tube on either side of Ajax. Rather than jointed, these descend straight to the bottom of the tube and emit a lengthwise wall of soft blue light from tube to the other INT. - Security Screening Control Room - day Wade examines the control panels and monitor screens. One large screen monitors the contents of the box on the table. The other monitors Ajax in the tube. WADE (INTO THE INTERCOM) I always feel kinda guilty doing this. I feel like I'm snooping at people's private stuff. AJAX (VIA INTERCOM) Well, I don't image that I could be helped, could it? I mean, security's security. WADE (INTO THE INTERCOM) True enough. A light on the panel flashes green. INT. - Security Office Screening Room - day WADE (VIA INTERCOM) OK, everything checks out. I'm shutting down the scanner now. The room resounds with a powering-down noise. The tubes retract into their housings, and the lights return to their usual soft white. Wade steps out of the control room and smiles. WADE OK, where are you needing to go? INT. - Elevator - day Wade and Ajax are in an otherwise empty elevator. She's looking at the control panel; her usual sunny smile on her face. Wade stand behind her, obviously checking out her ass. WADE Do you have a lot of deliveries to make today? AJAXNope. Just this one. WADE Really? Given the time, that sounds like it leaves you with a fairly open schedule for the rest of the day. AJAXKinda… WADE C’mon… What? DELIVERY GIRL Oh… Stuff…Wade chuckles. WADE Which is…? She turns her head to look at him. Her eyes twinkle at his questioning. She smiles. AJAXWell, if you must know… I'm going to see if there's anything else I'm supposed to be doing, today. Then, if my schedule's totally clear, then I'm going dancing. She goes back to watching the numbers on the control panel screen go flashing by. 9, 10, 11, 12... WADE Dancing, eh? Do you go out often? Ajax continues to study the control panel but makes a soft grunt of acknowledgement. WADE I've been out to the clubs a time or two in the last couple of weeks, but I don't think that I've ever seen you at any of them before. Is there a specific one you go to? She says nothing. She continues to gaze at the control panel screen. 14, 15, 16... She suddenly presses the "STOP" button on the panel at 17. DELIVERY GIRL This is my stop. WADE No it's not. Mr. Luntz works on the Twenty-seventh floor. This is only the 17th. Ajax smiles coyly at Wade. AJAXI know. Suddenly, with blinding speed, Ajax sends an elbow to Wade's jaw. The tall guard goes flying backwards into the wall of the elevator with such force that his head puts a colossal dent in the wall of the car. He slumps to the floor of the car. A small stream of blood oozes down the side of his head. Ajax then looks up towards the corner of the elevator car. INT. – Main Security Office – day An overweight security guard sits in front of a sea of security cam monitors. He’s not paying attention to a single one of them, however, as his attention is totally focused on a porno magazine. One of the monitors shows the elevator that holds Wade and Ajax. The camera zooms toward and focuses tight on it.POV SHOT - ELEVATOR SECURITY CAMERA Ajax is seen in the green view of a security camera. She smiles brightly. She then puts her hand over the lens. A pop is heard, then snow fills the screen. INT. - Elevator - day Cutting back to inside the elevator reveals that Ajax has crushed the security cam with one bare hand. She removes her hand from the camera. Ajax proceeds to open the box. Inside is a pressed business suit, a pair of wire-rimmed glasses and a wig of long, straight and blonde hair. At the bottom of the box is a small, black briefcase. She opens and examines the briefcase. Inside, in foam housings are two silver pistols. Each has the embossed words "Mr. Bang" imprinted on the sides. She checks the chamber of each, as well as the ammo clips, and then returns them to the case and clamps it shut. She unzips her uniform and puts on the business suit. She then gathers up the uniform, stuffs it into the box, and shuts it. She then opens the emergency hatch and shoves the box through the hatch on the top of the car. Finally, she presses the "STOP" button again, and the elevator resumes its course. The jarring of the elevator resuming its course stirs Wade from his unconscious state, and he emits a low groan. Ajax cracks Wade across the forehead, sending him back into dreamland, once again. She removes a set of keys from his belt. She then picks Wade up and stuffs him up through the emergency hatch and shuts the hatch door. INT. – 27th Floor Landing – day The Elevator dings and the doors open. Out steps Ajax in the business suit, glasses and blonde wig. The landing is empty, save for a scrawny young man in a business suit, who is busy banging on a nearby candy machine, trying to rattle out a chocolate bar that’s stuck in the machine. He pays no attention to Ajax as she walks out of the elevator. Ajax walks over to him. AJAX Did it get stuck? BUSINESSMAN Heh… Yeah. AJAX What kind were you trying to get? BUSINESSMAN A "Choc-A-Lot." Really, I don’t know why I even bother with this stupid machine, sometimes. It’s notorious for taking my money and getting the candy stuck. I was just so hungry this morning that I couldn’t help myself. Ajax smiles and nods at the man. She then puts her fist through the front glass of the candy machine, snatches out several candy bars for inside the machine, and places them into the dumbfounded man’s hands. AJAX Here. I imagine that should make up for a few previous losses. BUSINESSMAN Th-Thanks… Ajax walks off, leaving the dumbstruck businessman staring after her. INT. – Office Hallway – day Office workers scurry around like ants throughout the long hallway. Ajax strides down the hallway, pert and sunny as ever, dodging businesspeople as effortlessly as she did in the lobby, when dressed as the delivery girl. INT. – Office Hallway – day The camera dollies past the office doors, revealing that each has a nameplate fixed to each. It pans along the hallway, until it reaches the door with the name "Skyler Luntz" embossed upon the nameplate. It holds there for a couple of beats, and suddenly, Ajax walks by the door, without stopping. She finally stops at a door marked "Authorized Personnel Only." The door has a keycard lock. CLOSEUP ON AJAX’S POCKET As she removes Wade’s keys. The camera follows her hand as it brings the key to the lock and turns the handle. A click is heard. INT. – Office Hallway – day Checking to see that no one is watching, Ajax slips inside. INT. – Executive Hallway – day Ajax finds herself in a long, steel-blue-painted hallway. Another elevator resides at the other end of the hall. She strides briskly towards the elevator landing. Two business suit-clad security operatives rush towards her from around a corner. OPERATIVE #1 Hold it! Stay right where you are! Ajax stops in her tracks. She doesn’t seem the least bit cautious or even concerned at the two imposing men running towards her. In fact, she looks quite interested and amused; like a child watching a caterpillar crawl across her arm. OPERATIVE #2 Lay down on the floor with your hands out and away from you! She suddenly flings her briefcase at the second operative’s chest. It slams into him hard and sends him straight to the floor, gasping for air. The first operative reaches into his coat for a weapon. Ajax grabs him by the throat with blinding speed and slams his head hard against the wall with such force that a huge splatter of blood erupts from the impact point. The operative slumps to the floor and does not move. Her sunny facial expression has not changed once during the course of this carnage. Ajax walks over to the gasping security operative on the floor. She bends down and picks up the briefcase. Then, she steps on the operative’s neck. A sickening crack is heard. Ajax walks away, as if nothing has happened. Two more security operatives emerge from the corridor, already brandishing their pistols. They say nothing, but commence firing upon Ajax. She begins running towards them, picking up insane speed. The bullets whiz by her, grazing her clothes and hair. She suddenly leaps towards the gunmen, tackling one and kicking the gun out of the still-standing gunman’s hand from the ground. She snaps the neck of the tackled guard, and low-roundhouse-kicks the other man off of his feet. The second guard’s pistol is just out of his reach from where he has fallen, and he makes a quick grab for it. Before he is able to reach the pistol, however, Ajax has grabbed the first guard’s pistol and fires a round into his forehead. She gets up and examines her clothing. It’s bloodstained, singed and frayed in places from where it was clipped by the guards’ gunfire. Her wig is messy and singed in places as well. She removes the glasses, suit coat and wig, and makes her way to the landing. INT. – Executive Hallway Landing – day Ajax cautiously peeks around the corner. The landing is surprisingly free of guards. She steps forward onto the landing and is about to use the guard’s keys on the locked elevator button when a loud bang is heard and she is thrown sideways across the room by a huge concussive blast. Across the room, she is picking herself up, amongst much of the rubble that had previously been most of the surrounding wall. A large, robotic foot steps down with a loud clunk in front of the camera’s view. The robot is huge; at least 10 feet tall and solid bulk. The center of its head sports a large monitor screen, which displays a digitized skull and crossbones. Its arms each sport a trio of heavy, talon-like digits that look like they could easily shatter bones in a fraction of a second. Set in the middle of the claws is a pair of large barrels, about the size of a child’s head. One of the barrels is wafting a small stream of smoke. It strides towards her, and postures menacingly. Ajax smiles pleasantly. AJAX Hi there! She suddenly charges the sentry robot, guns blazing. The bullets ricochet off the robot’s shiny armor. It grabs Ajax by the arm and swings her across the room and straight into a wall. Her impact leaves a sizeable crater in the marble wall. She picks herself up and dusts herself off. The cheerful smile hasn’t left her face. She giggles as the robot bears down on her. AJAX Oops. My mistake. Let’s try a new approach, shall we? The robot charges towards her. It’s monitor screen depicts a snarling, frothing, barking Rottweiler. She grabs a sizeable chunk of marble and hurls it at the robot’s head. It impacts with the monitor screen, which shatters. The robot swings it’s arms around in confusion, and inadvertently backhands Ajax. She goes sailing across the room, but shifts herself around in midair and rebounds off the wall. An even more pronounced grin forms cross her face. She charges at the flailing robot, dodging its flailing arms this time, and baseball slides beneath it’s massive legs. She rights herself, and rips a small panel off the robot’s back, as easily as if it were made of paper. She then thrusts her hand inside the exposed hole and begins ripping out wiring. The robot whirrs to a halt and stills, as if it were an inactive marionette. AJAX Now… Where were we? She finds the keys on the floor, amid the rubble. AJAX Oh, yes. She places the key in the keyhole, and turns the key. The button pops out. She presses the button, and a beep is heard. The doors open to reveal an elevator. She enters, humming to herself; a smile still beaming across her face. INT. – Secured Area Elevator – day The elevator is very stark. The only feature therein is chrome box with two buttons, indicating up or down. Ajax presses the up button, and the doors quickly shut. She discharges the clips from her pistols and they clatter to the floor. Then, she unbuttons her shirt. She holds out her arm and runs her finger gently across the base of her wrist. A soft whirring sound is heard and her skin appears to melt away in a small, rectangular pattern along her forearm. She presses the pattern and the patch of skin flips up, revealing a small control panel. She presses the buttons in a short sequence and two more panels appear on her sides. These pop out, and reveal two small compartments, each storing fresh clips. She removes two and reloads each of her pistols. AJAX Never again. These shirts just don’t work right for this kind of thing… The two compartment slots close automatically, and skin develops around them, again, making them appear as if they had never been there at all. She closes the flap on her arm, and the skin around the panel door redevelops, then she buttons her shirt again. INT. – Secured Area Landing – day The elevator reaches its destination and Ajax readies herself, pointing her guns directly at the door. They open on landing where nearly twenty security operatives, much like the ones upstairs stand to meet her, their guns aiming straight at her. Ajax unloads round after round at the initial guards. She leapfrogs over one guard, kicking two other guards hard in the throat as she jumps. She flips around him, and wraps one arm around his neck and fires at guards with her other. Bullet holes erupt on the captive guard’s chest, as she continues to fire. She smiles happily. AJAX One, two… Two guards’ heads erupt in fountains of blood. AJAX Buckle my shoe. Three, four… Two more guards’ heads blast open. AJAX Shut the door. Five… One more guard’s head collapses. There are no more guards standing. She looks disappointed. AJAX Darn… She lets go of her human shield and skips merrily down the hall. The door at the end of the hall is shut. There are no markings on the door, nor is there a visible handle. Ajax pays this no mind and kicks it in. INT. – Secured Area Meeting Room – day AJAX Candygram! Hargove Crane, Denis Crane, and seven important-looking old men sit seated at a long table. There are huge, muscular, armed guards flanked at either side of the door. Ajax unloads the remainders of her clips at them. They slump to the floor in bloody heaps. She grins happily at the shocked men. AJAX You guys are the Board of Directors, right? I just want to make sure that I came to the right place. Crane and Denis cast frantic glances at each other, and rise from their seats in alarm. An old man in the center chair looks as though he’s about to have a heart attack. AJAX Now… Which of you is Lou Davenport? Crane stares at Ajax, who’s looking around the room with an expression like this is a big guessing game. AJAX Wait… Don’t tell me… I want to see if I can figure it out. CRANE Lou Davenport’s dead. He died two days ago. Who the hell are you? AJAX Me? I’m Universal Improvement Industries Food Service Droid, Unit LY-491. Reformatted and retrofitted for executions and sabotage. The two slats open up on her thighs and a pair of pistols emerge on small racks. She removes them and the slats close. She smiles at the board members, who murmur in alarm. AJAX Simply put, my name’s Ajax. I kill people and break things. She twirls the pistols in her hands and points them at the council. AJAX Hargrove Crane sends his regards. CRANE But I’m Hargrove Cra- She fires one round from her pistol and shoots Crane between the eyes. He slumps back in his chair, dead. Denis and the board members stare at her in fear and panic. They call for help that will not be coming. Ajax giggles and opens fire on the board members. Ajax surveys the carnage the she’s just wrought. Nine men dead, and the room covered in blood and bits of skin, flesh and bone. She giggles softly to herself. AJAX Wow… I sure did make a mess. She shrugs, holsters her pistols, and heads back towards the elevator, humming to herself. INT. – Office Hallway – day Ajax emerges from behind the security door. She’s back in her business suit again, even though it looks like she’s been wearing it through a war zone. People gawk at her as she walk by, but she pays this no notice. She walks to the door with the name "Skyler Luntz" embossed upon the nameplate, and walks inside. INT. – Luntz’s Office – day Skyler Luntz sits at his desk, yelling into the phone. He is a loud, skinny man in his mid-30’s, with curly hair that’s showing signs of thinning. He doesn’t seem to notice that Ajax has walked into the room. LUNTZ No! Damn it, Paul, No! Dark blue is NOT fucking what I asked for! I told you that I wanted the car in midnight blue, and no other color. I don’t give a shit if that’s all that you were able to find in the city. I’m already paying you a ridiculous goddamn amount for this goddamn car, so you better try fucking harder! I don’t want to hear this… He looks up and notices Ajax. LUNTZ Who the fuck are you? EXT: Crane Industries Building – Day Glass shatters from one of the high floors of the building and Skyler Luntz goes sailing out of the windows. He screams and plummets to the pavement. EXT. – Rooftop – day Ajax jump out the window and lands on the rooftop of the next building over. Next to the rooftop exit is another Crixus Courier box. She picks up the box and removes a pair of cutoffs and a t-shirt. She goes through the exit door. EXT. – City Street – day Ajax emerges onto the street from the building next to the Crane building. She is no longer in her executive dress, but in the clothes from the box. Her hair is back to messy red. She glances at the crowd gathered around Luntz’s smashed body. No one seems to notice her as she crosses the street and walks away. FADE OUT FADE IN EXT: City Street – Night Ajax walks down a busy, dingy city street, a vision of cleanliness and beauty among such decay and ruin. A shabbily dressed man with a bald head, largely covered in tattoos (the most noticeable, being a large back spider tattooed across his face), emerges from the shadows and starts following her. TATTOOED MAN Hey, Gorgeous! What’s your hurry? Ajax stops and smiles pleasantly at the grungy man. AJAX I’m trying to find some people I know. The tattooed man smiles. It is an ugly, leering smile. TATTOOED MAN Well, I’m someone. I can be your friend, too… Can I be your friend, Doll? AJAX Well, I don’t see why not! She holds her free hand out to the tattooed man. He’s rather surprised at this. This can’t be right. This is too easy. TATTOOED MAN Ooo-Kay… They call me "Spider." AJAX That’s a nice name. Why do they call you that? The tattooed man flashes her a very quizzical look. Slowly, he points his index finger up to the large spider tattoo that covers much of his face. AJAX Ohhhhhhhhhhh… I see. The tattooed man nods tentatively. This girl can’t be for real. She just can’t! TATTOOED MAN What’s, uh… What’s your name, Doll? AJAX Well, my friend Bishop calls me Ajax. I don’t know why, really… I don’t really have a name, if you want to get right down to it… The tattooed man looks puzzled by this statement. He shrugs it off though. It’s not like this crazy bitch is going to be around much longer, anyway. AJAX Well, I need to get going. I’ll see you later, OK? She starts to walk away. He follows after her. TATTOOED MAN No, wait… I’ve got some friends who’d love to meet you. Would you like to meet some new friends? AJAXMaybe some other time. TATTOOED MAN It’ll only take a second. C’Mon… She keeps walking. AJAX No, some other time. Sorry, Spider. The tattooed man suddenly grabs her arm forcefully. TATTOOED MAN No, I think you’ll be coming with me, right now, Doll. She flashes him a cheerfully puzzled look. AJAX Oh, OK… But I’ve only got a minute. INT: Alley - night He yanks her along, trying to seem forceful and threatening, even though she’s walking at normal speed and slightly amused at the way he’s acting. They end up in a dark alleyway. Three hulking figures are standing there, waiting. TATTOOED MAN I brought something for you guys to snack on. AJAX Hi! What’re your names? Two of the hulking men grab Ajax by the arms. The man on the right has a massive robotic arm. TATTOOED MAN Shut up. He pulls out a sizeable knife and waves it threateningly at her. She watches the blade with rapt curiosity. TATTOOED MAN Are you scared yet, Doll? AJAX Nah… I just thought that was a really nice knife. I’ve got a couple, myself, but that one is really neat. Do you know where I might get one, myself? The tattooed man smiles at her. It’s an even more menacing smile than the one he gave her on the street. He slashes at her shirt, ripping it. Ajax looks shocked. The hulking men laugh. AJAX Hey! Your ruined my shirt! This is the only one I have! The tattooed man breaks out in a fit of laughter. TATTOOED MAN If I were you, Girlie, I’d be worried about more than my shirt… Not that it’s gonna do you much good. You’re in for a lot of rips and tears before we’re through with you, Sweetheart. All three men laugh stupidly and evilly. Ajax frowns and narrows her eyes. AJAX You’re not a very nice man, Spider. I don’t think you can be my friend, after all. TATTOOED MAN Awww, now that’s a shame. And here I thought we were getting along so well. He lunges for her. She kicks up and lands a foot in his groin. He screams and doubles over. The third man advances on her and the two men holding her tighten their grip. Ajax stomps down hard on the man on the left’s foot. A crunching sound is heard. He howls in pain and lets go of her arm. She then grabs the remaining man’s mechanical arm with both hands and pulls hard. It rips away from the large man in a shower of blood and sparks. He screams and falls to the ground, clutching the remains of his bloody, smoking shoulder with his remaining arm. Ajax brandishes the arm like an oversized club and baseball swings it at the oncoming third man. It connects with the bridge of his nose with a sickening crunch. He roars in pain and comes at her again. She easily dodges out of his path, and he crashes headlong into a dumpster. He clutches his chest in pain. His ribs have been broken in the impact. She turns around and beats him repeatedly with the mechanical arm until he is motionless. The now-one-armed man lies screaming, quivering in pain. Ajax snaps his thick neck like a tree branch. He makes a strangled grunt. Spider, sputtering and wheezing, makes it to his feet, and attempts to run away. A swishing sound is heard, followed by a stabbing noise. He suddenly stiffens, mid-stride and falls to the pavement. His huge knife protrudes from his back. Ajax stands behind him, grinning. AJAX Mind if I take this? She rips the knife out of Spider’s back. He screams, and a sickening, tearing sound can be heard. AJAX Before I go, do you want to see my knives? She unsheathes the bayonets housed in her wrists, and grins pleasantly on Spider. He manages a terrified shriek as the camera fades to black. FADE OUT FADE IN EXT: City Street – Morning CLOSE-UP as a fly darts hither and yon on Spider’s dead face. The sound of police-band radio and crime-scene photography flashes resound. Two sets of footsteps approach. Shadows of two people engulf Spider’s face. VOICE #1 Jesus, what a mess… Meat wagon gonna get here any time soon? VOICE #2 They’ve been here for about 20 minutes, Sir. The camera cuts to the owners of the two voices. Both are plain-clothes policemen. One is young, around mid-20’s, and dressed sharply in a suit and tie. The other is older, 45 or so, and dressed in a rumpled trenchcoat and a fedora hat, covering his vintage suit. He is horribly scarred. His left eye is pure white and stares off into nothingness. FRANKENSTEIN (formerly VOICE #1) So why haven’t they gotten around to cleaning this up yet? QUAGMIRE (formerly VOICE #2) Probably because they’re not done puking, yet, I’d imagine. Cut to panning shot of the crime scene. The bodies of Ajax’s assailants were gutted and hog-tied, with their small intestines binding their hands and feet together. Each length of innards is tied with an intricate bow. The heads of Spider and his companions have been separated from their respective bodies and sit neatly in a row. A dirty, frayed napkin has been folded ornately and placed atop Spider’s head, like a grungy party hat. FRANKENSTEIN Understandable. QUAGMIRE Maybe it’s a matter of you being around the block more times than I have, Boss, but I gotta tell you… This is by far the most fucked-up thing I’ve ever seen. Frankenstein nods. FRANKENSTEIN Frankenstein glances at a couple of nearby uniformed policemen, bagging evidence. FRANKENSTEIN Have we found a murder weapon yet? POLICEMAN #1 Not yet. We did find this, though. He tosses the evidence bag to Frankenstein. Inside the clear, plastic bag are shredded fragments of a pink t-shirt. Frankenstein surveys the fabric with a grim look about his grizzled face. FRANKENSTEIN Strange thing to find in the middle of this mess, don’t you think, Farley? QUAGMIRE What is that? T-shirt material? FRANKENSTEIN That would appear to be the case. If you look close, you can see the screen-printing on the edge of it. QUAGMIRE There doesn’t seem to be any blood or anything on the fabric, from what I can tell. There’s dirt, but it’s more than likely just from this grungy alleyway. Frankenstein nods. FRANKENSTEIN Any locals see or hear anything? POLICEMAN #2 We haven’t heard anything yet, Frankenstein. Scarsdale’s trying to take what statements he can from the few bums who’ve set up living quarters nearby. FRANKENSTEIN Let me know what he hears ASAP. And keep looking for that weapon, ladies. INT: Clothing Store – Day Spider’s knife is set down upon a glass countertop with a clack. It’s been cleaned of any blood or smudges and shines brightly under fluorescent lights. Next to the knife is a small pink T-shirt. Pan up to a flustered store clerk. CLERK What is this? A robbery? Ajax smiles brightly at the clerk. She’s still wearing the ripped shirt, although it’s been stapled and knotted together. AJAX No, Silly… I’m buying this shirt. The clerk looks severely annoyed now. CLERK This isn’t a trading post, Lady. We don’t operate under a barter-system. Only cash and credit. AJAXBut I don’t have any money. CLERK Well, that’s not my problem. Go pawn that thing off somewhere. AJAXBut I don’t… CLERK Security! A big, burly guard appears out of nowhere and places his hand on Ajax’s shoulder. INT: Pot of Gold Gun & Pawn back room – Night Bishop is sitting in a brand new, expensive chair, smoking a large, fat Cuban cigar. He’s letting a huge wad of cash flap like a deck of cards, reveling in the sound. He casts a disdainful look over at Rosie, who’s tinkering on a small, robot dog. BISHOP Jesus, would you give that shit a rest for five minutes? Christ, we’re independently wealthy now… We can finally close this pit down. We don’t ever have to bother with the crap anymore, if we don’t want to. ROSIE That’s just it, Ernie… I want to. BISHOP Whatever. Stay broke and married to this dump. See if I care. Me, I’ve got bigger fish to fry… O/C, we hear the dinging and creaking sound of the front door opening. BISHOP Jesus H. Christ… He labors to get out of his big, cushy chair. Rosie puts her screwdriver down. ROSIE Don’t hurt yourself, Ernie. I’ll take care of it. She exits the room. The robot dog looks at Bishop. It growls at him. Bishop flicks his cigar butt at it. It bounces off the dog’s chrome muzzle. Rosie peeks her head through the door at Bishop. She has a look of deep surprise on her face. ROSIE Um, Ernie? I think you might want to come up here, after all… INT: Pot of Gold Gun &amp; Pawn sale floor – Night Bishop stumbles through the door to the sale floor. BISHOP What? What’s so damn impor… Bishop’s jaw drops. Ajax is standing in the middle of the sale floor, looking positively giddy to see both him and Rosie. BISHOP What the hell is she doing here?! AJAX Well, I didn’t know where I was supposed to go or what I was supposed to do next. So, I went to find you both and await further instructions. ROSIE Does anyone know that you’re here? AJAX To my knowledge, no. I met a couple of people on my way here, and I informed them that I was looking for some people I knew… BISHOP Oh, wonderful… What do they know about you and where you were going? AJAX Very little, really. Anyway, they proved to be rather unfriendly, and I was forced to deal with them. She turns around and points to the bloody stain on the back of the filthy coat. ROSIE Well, at least that problem’s been cleared up. She holds up a copy of the Chronicle. Below the fold, a headline reads, "Downtown Car Blast Kills Two; Terrorism Suspected." ROSIE And no ties back to us from the Wonder Twins, considering they’re now Blackened Cajun Morons. BISHOP Well, what are we going to do with her? ROSIE I don’t know, Ernie. I wasn’t expecting her to come back here. BISHOP Well, neither was I! ROSIE Oh, no shit, Sherlock? Ajax watches, with rapt adoration, as the two siblings bicker. BISHOP Well, we need to figure out something to do with her. ROSIE Of course. I imagine I could put her to work here, but she’s really not very suited to stuff around here, in her present condition. I imagine I could retrofit her again, but I worry about too many program changes. Not to mention the time it would take to remove all the weapons and stuff… A look of epiphany comes across Bishop’s face. BISHOP Wait a minute… Rose casts a puzzled look at him. ROSIE What? BISHOP Who said we had to change her? ROSIE Well, I just figured that she’d have an easier time around here, if she knew more about basic operations and… BISHOP (cutting in) No! Don’t you touch her! He stands in front of Ajax, with his hands out, as if he was trying to protect her from Rosie. Ajax looks over his shoulder with a look of puzzled amusement. ROSIE Ernie, what are you doing? BISHOP Don’t change her again. Just think about how much money this little darling just made for us! She could keep making us money by doing the same thing, over and over and over! Rosie rolls her eyes. ROSIE Ernie, don’t be ridiculous… There’s no way that would work. BISHOP How do you know? Jesus Christ, Sis… A gold mine just walked back into your store, and you’re not even considering taking a little for yourself? ROSIE Neither of us is in the murder racket, Ernie. We buy and sell crap. We fix the occasional appliance, droid, whatever. I don’t know the first thing about getting into the assassin business, and neither do you. BISHOP I doubt it’s all that tough, Rosie. You kill a person here, you kill a person there. You kill enough people, and you stay alive long enough, you get yourself a reputation. Word of mouth travels, and boom. There’s the big time. Rosie claps sarcastically. ROSIE Oh, Bravo, Ernie… You simplified that so well. Jesus, I’m surprised I hadn’t thought of that. Why in God’s name I’ve been wasting my time here, I’ll never know. Bishop ignores her obvious sarcasm and plods on. BISHOP Look… All I’m saying is that it would be completely stupid not to take this opportunity when it’s pretty-much fallen into our laps… Er… He looks downward at her torso. Rosie glares and him and points a finger at him threateningly. ROSIE Don’t you even say it, Ernie. I know you’re itching to, but don’t. BISHOP Or, what? You’ll roll over my foot? ROSIE Just knock it off, Ernie. I mean it. BISHOP Fine. If you’re going to be too stupid to cash in when you’ve had the chance, then you can stay poor. Best of luck to you, Sis. (to Ajax) C’Mon. We’re leaving. He grabs Ajax by the arm and leads her out the door. She looks politely confused, and a little troubled to be leaving Rosie behind. When Bishop reaches the door, he shunts Ajax through. He then stops and turns to Rosie. BISHOP I’ll be back in a couple of days for my share of the cash. He turns to leave, stops, then turns to face Rosie again. BISHOP Oh, and my chair, too. Lord knows you’ll have no use for it. He turns and slams the door behind him, leaving Rosie alone and staring at the door. FADE OUT SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: SIX MONTHS LATER FADE IN INT. – Apartment – day The camera fades in on what appears to be an old lady’s apartment.     _________________________________________ TO BE WRITTEN INTO CONTINUITY _________________________________________ EXT. - Courtyard - evening The shot opens up in a lush, perfectly manicured garden, overlooked by a large, ornate mansion. Ajax is walking down the paved pathway of the garden with a very old man in a wheelchair, being pushed by a large, blond amazon of a woman. AJAX The dragon was placed on the table, as per your instructions. The old man looks up at her and smiles. This is Heinrich von Zell. Though in his 80's, he has a deep air of authority and shrewdness, which hasn't dulled in the least bit, despite his age. VON ZELL Ah, Sehr Gut. I congratulate you, Fraulein. You have exceeded my expectations utterly, and such is not always an easy thing to do. Ajax smiles sheepishly at the compliment. VON ZELL You will stay for a drink, yes? We have much to discuss with regards to your future with this organization. AJAX Of course. They head towards the door of the house. INT: Mansion Lounge - Evening von Zell sits in a sumptuous leather chair, holding a snifter of brandy. Greta, his Amazonian attendant, stands silently behind him. Ajax sits across from him, looking pleasant as usual. VON ZELL First and foremost, your reward for services rendered. Greta produces a large briefcase. She opens it up for Ajax. It is filled with cash. She shuts it, and passes it across the table. von Zell watches Ajax shrewdly and sips from his glass. He sits for a moment. VON ZELL My apologies. The thought of you not being able to imbibe food or drink had not even crossed my mind. AJAX No apologies necessary. VON ZELL It is a great asset that you have that your actions and behavior don't betray your true self. I, myself, admit to being fooled into thinking that you were a true human, until you proved otherwise. He regards his drink for a moment. VON ZELL Many people would not even consider allowing automatons to dine with them, much less even converse with them, but I am not most people, much as you are not like most automatons. Ajax smiles politely. VON ZELL On the whole, Fraulein, I value efficiency and effectiveness. You have impressed me with your actions, and, as such, you have earned the right to become part of my establishment, regardless of your...status. AJAX It is an honor, Sir. VON ZELL An interesting statement, Fraulein. Though I did not think that honor was a trait which automatons possessed. AJAX Technically, Sir, we can't. On the whole, my processor can calculate each new variable that adds or detracts to the situation and can judge its import from there. While I am not physically able to feel true feelings of honor, and a regular person would, I can dictate that it is an important addition to my master-servant protocols and so I can act accordingly, from there. von Zell laughs. VON ZELL There is no need to get technical, or even explain yourself, Fraulein. I was simply amused by the statement. Ajax nods, looking rather sheepish. VON ZELL Were you able to understand the meaning of the dragon that I had you leave with the council? I understand that you and I have not met face to face before this night, and I am curious if you understood its significance. AJAX I know that from 1984 to 2020, you were involved with a group in Berlin, known as Zahn das Drachen, or "The Dragon's Tooth," which was involved in many illegal activities throughout Germany and much of Europe. The group dissolved shortly, thereafter, and you took up residence in Triad City. Since that time, some form of a dragon symbol at the scene of various acts of theft, violence, murder and destruction. I would assume that the dragon had something to do with that. VON ZELL You have done your homework, Fraulein. Again, I am impressed. Yes, the dragon has become my symbol, and I used it to relay a symbol to those who cross either my establishment or myself. Cliché, yes... But old ways are sometimes the best ways, are they not? AJAX Indeed they are. VON ZELL The beautiful thing is that the organizations tied to the council will do their best to keep your handiwork entirely out of the media. Criminal organizations tend to keep matters like this strictly in-house, for fear of embarrassment or possible police investigations into their "businesses." Ajax nods. VON ZELL The dragon serves as a message to them that I am greater than any "Council of Bosses." That I can send people in to remove their leaders, slaughter their guards, and take whatever I please. That I and I alone, rule Triad City. Von Zell smiles smugly to himself. VON ZELL Of course, they will try to exact revenge upon me... But I am more prepared for such actions than they even realize. I will not be brought down so easily by petty thugs and hoodlums. Von Zell laughs softy, but his chortles are soon replaced by a fit of violent coughing. Ajax rises and moves toward him, but Greta holds out a hand to block her. She reaches for a small pitcher of water on a nearby writing desk, and pours a small glass. She offers the glass to Von Zell, as well as a small handkerchief. Soon, his coughing subsides. VON ZELL Thank you, Greta. (to Ajax) My apologies... My health has not been favorable in recent months. Ajax says nothing. She merely smiles politely. Von Zell whispers something into Greta's ear. She produces a manilla envelope from the writing desk. VON ZELL I will not beat around the bush, my dear. Here is your assignment, which I will be,,, His words trail off as another coughing fit resumes and he fades out of consciousness. Greta runs to a panel on the wall and presses a combination of buttons on the keypad. Two men dressed in white coats and pushing a stretcher rush in. Greta nods and motions to the unconscious Von Zell. Her silent face is marked with panic and dread. The men say nothing, and load Von Zell onto the stretcher. They rush back out. Greta hands the envelope to Ajax, who has been watching this all with a look of puzzled curiosity on her face, and escorts her to the door. When she is gone, Greta turns around and goes into a dead sprint towards the stairs.   INT. - Elevator Landing - evening Greta is standing next to the stretcher, carrying the unconscious Von Zell. He has an oxygen mask covering much of his ancient face, and what breathing he does do is quite shallow. She squeezes his hand slightly, and tears roll down her face. The elevator opens and the two med techs roll him in. INT. - Medical Lab - evening The elevator doors roll open and the med techs roll the stretcher to an operating table. A large, four-armed scientist is prepping for surgery. Behind him is a large machine with a huge glass dome set in the middle of the top. Inside the dome is a thick, purple liquid. One of the med techs looks at the scientist with a look of apprehension. MED TECH For the record, I don't think that we should be doing this yet. SCIENTIST Duly noted. Unfortunately, we have no choice in the matter. Orders are orders, and Mr. Von Zell specifically told us that we were to initiate the transfer as soon as we were able to. It appears that we have to do it a little sooner than we were prepared for. MED TECH But his body isn't ready yet! The Scientist picks Von Zell's body up and lays him on the operating table. SCIENTIST It's functional enough to initiate the transfer. It just hasn't matured as much as I was planning on before this operation was to take place. The med tech looks at him with a slightly panicked look on his face. SCIENTIST Look, if you have any other option, you're welcome to spill it out. If he comes through, and realizes that we didn't follow his orders specifically, you're welcome to tell him all about your reservations. If not, then help me get him ready for transferal. The med techs say nothing. They remove Von Zell's robe and shirt. The scientist preps an I.V. and attaches it to Von Zell's arm. A robot lumbers forth, carrying a large device, with a curious headpiece attached to it. Needles attached to wires, which connect back to the device, surround its contours. The med techs plug two long cords into the large machine behind the operating table. The headpiece is placed on Von Zell's head, and fixed to his scalp. The needles snap down and lock into place within his scalp. Greta shudders. The scientist walks over to her and puts one of his arms around her. SCIENTIST I'll be all right. Trust me. Greta nods and walks over to a seat across the room, where she breaks down into silent sobs. Back at the operating area, the techs strap Von Zell's limp body to the table. The scientist walks over to the robot and places his hand on the machine it holds. SCIENTIST Now, when I initiate the transferal, his body may go into sever convulsions. Above all, I want you to make sure that his head is VERY secure. We don't want a single one of those wire slipping out, or it could be disastrous. If it comes down to it, I want you to hold him as steady as you can without damaging any of the equipment. One slight nudge and we might lose part of him. The med techs nod. The scientist turns toward the machine. SCIENTIST All right. Initiating transferal... Now. He flips a switch on the machine, and it hums to life. Von Zell's body begins to slightly twitch. SCIENTIST Hold him down, gentlemen. CLOSE UP on Von Zell's face. We see Von Zell's unconscious face shake and shudder. Fading in over his visage are scenes of dark, transparent aspects of his life. All show the full life of a very rich and evil man. Violence, greed, sex, power. An old shopkeeper's head hollowed out by a shotgun blast. A beautiful topless women smiling and laughing seductively. Cars exploding. Showers of money cascading down. People being beat mercilessly by mobs of street toughs. A younger Von Zell driving in a convertible down a beautiful countryside, with an even more beautiful man at his side. Newspaper images, newsreel footage, television interviews and photo ops. More violence, more sex, more greed, more power. The images begin to overlap each other and spin around in circles, as if being caught in a drain. They spin faster and faster, then suddenly split in to several long, thin strips and drin themselves into the wires attached to Von Zell's head. His mind and his memories have been siphoned into this machine. Von Zell's body goes limp. His heart rate continues to beat weakly on the monitor, but he is dead inside; an empty, lifeless husk. SCIENTIST Phase one is complete. His thought processes have fully transferred into the system. Is the new host ready? MED TECH Yeah. It's in stasis inside the incubator. SCIENTIST Bring it up. We're ready to begin phase two. Both techs move to either side of the large, domed machine. They grab hold of large levers and push them forward. The domed machine whirrs to life and the purple fluid inside the tank begins to bubble and thrash behind the glass. Panels in the bottom of the tank open and the level of purple fluid rises. A small shapeless form rises from the portal in the bottom of the tank. A long, gray cable is attached to the form. SCIENTIST Initiating phase two. He flips a large switch on the tank machine's control panel. Lights flash and the form in the take begins to convulse and pulsate. CLOSE UP on Control panel. A pie chart depicted on a monitor screen is slowly filling up. SCIENTIST Phase two complete. All we can do now is sit and wait. FADE OUT              INT. – Bishop’s Car – day Behind the wheel of the black car is Ernie Bishop. He glares at Ajax in the rear-view mirror. BISHOP So, I’m guessing you got it done, right? Ajax smiles softly. AJAX Yes. Everything that Herr Von Zell requested. BISHOP He didn’t want trophies this time? AJAX No, he said that their finding the dragon with the bodies would be just what was necessary. Bishop grunts a surly acknowledgement. BISHOP What the hell was all that commotion back there? AJAX Remember Mary-Ann Luntz, that lady we met at the deli the other day? BISHOP You met her. I could give a fuck about the people who’re in there when I am. AJAX Anyway, she told me how her husband was cheating on her… BISHOP I can’t believe that complete fucking strangers tell you this shit. What the fuck is wrong with people? Ajax smiles patiently. AJAX She said that she’d love to kill him, herself, but she was scared of losing her family if she ever got caught. BISHOP So, you… Ajax nods. AJAX Out the 21st floor window. Bishop slams on the breaks. He turns around to face Ajax and glares at her. BISHOP God Damn it, what have I told you about these penny-ante killing jobs? They don’t pay worth a shit, and nine times out of ten, you run the risk of getting caught. They aren’t even worth your time, so you should be avoiding them like the fucking plague. AJAX I know, Bishop. BISHOP If you knew, then you wouldn’t be doing it in the first fucking place. He turns around and resumes driving. BISHOP Nobody saw you do it, did they? AJAX If anyone did, I was in costume, and it’d be difficult to place. BISHOP Don’t be so sure about that. (beat) How much are we making for this side job, anyway? AJAX Nothing yet. At least, nothing until the heat dies down from it. She said she didn’t want to be implicated if she could help it. BISHOP So, essentially, you took a job for nothing. Jesus… AJAX Just trying to be nice, Bishop. BISHOP You’re not supposed to be nice. Not in this fucking business. I swear, if you weren’t a prime cash cow for me, I’d drop your dumb clockwork ass in a heartbeat. Ajax smiles patiently. EXT. – City Street – day The black car speeds away.

BISHOP That was a quick meeting. Are we in? AJAX Yeah, but… BISHOP But what? AJAX He started coughing really hard and they wheeled him out on the stretcher. After that, I had to go. BISHOP Great. He’s dead. God damn my luck. I finally find a way to get my foot in the door, and the old geezer kacks it that very night. Fuck me…. AJAX Well, I did get an assignment. She holds up the manila envelope. BISHOP Fat lot of good that’s gonna do us now, since he’s worm food. We’re lucky we got paid at all before the old fossil kicked. INT. – Elevator Landing – evening Greta is standing next to the stretcher, carrying the unconscious von Zell. He has an oxygen mask covering much of his ancient fact, and what breathing he does do is quite shallow. She squeezes his hand slightly, and tears roll down her face. The elevator opens and the two med techs roll him in. INT. – Medical Lab – evening The elevator doors roll open and the med techs roll the stretcher to an operating table. A large, four-armed scientist is prepping for surgery. Behind him is a large machine with a huge glass dome set in the middle of the top. Inside the dome is a thick, purple liquid. One of the med techs looks at the scientist with a look of apprehension. MED TECH For the record, I don’t think that we should be doing this yet. SCIENTIST Duly noted. Unfortunately, we have no choice in the matter. Orders are orders, and Mr. von Zell specifically told us that we were to initiate the transfer as soon as we were able to. It appears that we have to do it a little sooner than we were prepared for. MED TECH But his body isn’t ready yet! The Scientist picks von Zell’s body up and lays him on the operating table. SCIENTIST It’s functional enough to initiate the transfer. It just hasn’t matured as much as I was planning on before this operation was to take place. The med tech looks at him with a slightly panicked look on his face. SCIENTIST Look, if you have any other option, you’re welcome to spill it out. If he comes through, and realizes that we didn’t follow his orders specifically, you’re welcome to tell him all about your reservations. If not, then help me get him ready for transferal. The med techs say nothing. They remove von Zell’s robe and shirt. The scientist preps an I.V. and attaches it to von Zell’s arm. A robot lumbers forth, carrying a large device, with a curious headpiece attached to it. Needles attached to wires, which connect back to the device, surround its contours. The med techs plug two long cords into the large machine behind the operating table. The headpiece is placed on von Zell’s head, and fixed to his scalp. The needles snap down and lock into place within his scalp. Greta shudders. The scientist walks over to her and puts one of his arms around her. SCIENTIST I’ll be all right. Trust me. Greta nods and walks over to a seat across the room, where she breaks down into silent sobs. Back at the operating area, the techs strap von Zell’s limp body to the table. The scientist walks over to the robot and places his hand on the machine it holds. SCIENTIST Now, when I initiate the transferal, his body may go into sever convulsions. Above all, I want you to make sure that his head is VERY secure. We don’t want a single one of those wire slipping out, or it could be disastrous. If it comes down to it, I want you to hold him as steady as you can without damaging any of the equipment. One slight nudge and we might lose part of him. The med techs nod. The scientist turns toward the machine. SCIENTIST All right. Initiating transferal… Now. He flips a switch on the machine, and it hums to life. von Zell’s body begins to slightly twitch. SCIENTIST Hold him down, gentlemen. CLOSE UP on von Zell’s face. We see von Zell’s unconscious face shake and shudder. Fading in over his visage are scenes of dark, transparent aspects of his life. All show the full life of a very rich and evil man. Violence, greed, sex, power. An old shopkeeper’s head hollowed out by a shotgun blast. A beautiful topless women smiling and laughing seductively. Cars exploding. Showers of money cascading down. People being beat mercilessly by mobs of street toughs. A younger von Zell driving in a convertible down a beautiful countryside, with an even more beautiful woman at his side. Newspaper images, newsreel footage, television interviews and photo ops. More violence, more sex, more greed, more power. The images begin to overlap each other and spin around in circles, as if being caught in a drain. They spin faster and faster, then suddenly split in to several long, thin strips and drin themselves into the wires attached to von Zell’s head. His mind and his memories have been siphoned into this machine. von Zell’s body goes limp. His heart rate continues to beat weakly on the monitor, but he is dead inside; an empty, lifeless husk. SCIENTIST Phase one is complete. His thought processes have fully transferred into the system. Is the new host ready? MED TECH Yeah. It’s in stasis inside the incubator. SCIENTIST Bring it up. We’re ready to begin phase two. Both techs move to either side of the large, domed machine. They grab hold of large levers and push them forward. The domed machine whirrs to life and the purple fluid inside the tank begins to bubble and thrash behind the glass. Panels in the bottom of the tank open and the level of purple fluid rises. A small shapeless form rises from the portal in the bottom of the tank. A long, gray cable is attached to the form. SCIENTIST Initiating phase two. He flips a large switch on the tank machine’s control panel. Lights flash and the form in the take begins to convulse and pulsate. CLOSE UP on Control panel. A pie chart depicted on a monitor screen is slowly filling up. SCIENTIST Phase two complete. FADE OUT A baby’s cry can be heard to blackness. FADE IN EXT. Drive-in Restaurant – Night Bishop’s car is parked in front of a large, garish, neon-sign-laden drive-in restaurant. Both he and Ajax are sitting in the car. INT. Bishop’s car – Night Bishop is munching on a hamburger and gawking at the ass of a waitress who is bending over the car parked next them in the lot. Ajax is pouring over the contents of the manila envelope. AJAX Y’know, this is really interesting. You should look it over. BISHOP (mouth full of food) Why the hell would I want to look at it? We aren’t going to see a red cent from that job, even if we did do it, simply out of charity to the deceased, or some shit. I say burn it, and let’s move on. AJAX I want to do the job, anyway. He was a nice old man and he deserves his last wishes honored. Bishop turns around to face her. He is obviously furious. BISHOP Nice old man?! Do you have any inkling of an idea as to the shit that old geezer has been involved with over the years? (He counts it off on his hands) Robbery, extortion, arson, kidnapping, hijacking, murder… I could go on and on about this guy. He didn’t get filthy rich as he was by being a nice old man, you dimwit. Ajax says nothing. She sits there and ponders the contents of the envelope. Bishop reaches out of the car and slaps the ass of the waitress as she skates by. The waitress promptly turns around and slaps Bishop. WAITRESS Asshole! INT. Apartment – Night Bishop and Ajax’s apartment is a rathole. It’s dirty and musty. Plaster has come free of the walls in great chunks, exposing insulation, wiring, etc. Bishop has tried to cover this up by plastering up posters (mostly of rock groups, bikini ladies, and shlocky b-movies) over the patches, but no no avail. Evidently, lodgings were not high on Bishop’s "to-buy" list, when he received his payment for Ajax, or maybe he simply frittered it all away on meaningless crap. Bishop is asleep on a huge couch across from a large, obviously expensive TV (a sharp contrast the rest of the crap in the room), which displays a test pattern. The clock above the TV reads 3 a.m. Ajax sits in a mismatched chair, reading over the envelope’s contents, most of which is spread out on a nearby coffee table. Documents, photographs, transcribed telephone conversations. She glances up at the clock, then looks over at Bishop. Quietly, she gathers up the information, stuffs it back into the envelope, and sneaks out of the apartment.
