      ...on my French reading, REALLY WEIRD BOOK, Rhinocéros, although i'm only like 50, 60 pages into it, i wouldn't suggest it to maintain mental health... but anyway... i woke up at 7 to go swimming.... that didn't happen, then woke up at 9h50 and i had to be at my Japanese teacher's house in Pleasant Hill at 10h00... zoomed over there feeling all gross and she stuffed me with food like i was a turkey for thanks giving or something, she doens't understand when i tell her i don't want any... and that last for like three hours.. finished up my third-year Kanji (the characters) and then came home around one or after... need to go to registration, but would rather go on monday... my mom is busy with the counselor anyway... i need to do like five loads of laundry, read at least 40 pages of french ...and study a bit of my spanish before school starts, and then i took a shower, need to eat breakfast... and mucho ist aller on (that was awesome: sp, ger, fr)   and .. later i'm goin to Robert's to watch the one and only Princess Mononoke! then chill or whatever... anyway, i'm psyched... but i still need to manage my time better... and i wont have too much to do anything before school starts cuz i work on Sat and Sun from 9-5... so not a whole lot of time to do my homework... although i will be getting much money for the amount of time i'm working... i love money... and this is Cullen REDDY, signing off with Channel CTR news...

      I've decided to metion a couple songs or artists that i've discovered while i was in Europe every so often because STUPID america doesn't like good music.... well ... ...anyway, download them and see if you like...   Jamelia - Stuper Star  (it's in english, but i don't know if she's british or not, so didnt know if we'd have it here...) K Maro - Femme Like You  (all you frenchies out there, good song) Tiziano Ferro - Perverso  (there's an italian, a spanish, and a french version.... check out his other music too, good stuff)

      So a couple days after i got back from Europe, i noticed that my hermit crabs weren't moving too much altho they didn't do too much of that in the first place... and then noticed one of the limbs fell off one of them, and i found out my first crab was dead, and then a coupel days later, the other died.... how sad.... AND THEN a couple days later i step out of the shower and notice somethign squirming on the counter, and it's one of my crabs! A miracle!  so my favorite one was still alive.... (yes i often leave dead crabs on my bethroom counter for days on end...) and then this morning i realized he was dead again.... that's sounds weird... i hate those crabs messing with my mind...
