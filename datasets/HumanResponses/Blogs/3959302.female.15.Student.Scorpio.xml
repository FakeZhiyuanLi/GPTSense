      Take My Breath Away Vocals: Jessica Simpson  Watching every motion In my foolish lover's game On this endless ocean Finally lovers know no shame Turning and returning To some secret place inside Watching in slow motion As you turn around and say My love  Take my breath away Take my breath away  Watching I keep waiting Still anticipating love Never hesitating To become the fated ones Turning and returning To some secret place inside Watching in slow motion As you turn around and say My love  Take my breath away  Take my breath away  Through the hourglass I saw you In time you slipped away When the mirror crashed I called you And turned to hear you say If only for today I am unafraid  Take my breath away  Take my breath away  Watching every motion In this foolish lovers game  Haunted by the notion Somewhere there's a love in flames Turning and returning  To some secret place inside Watching in slow motion As you turn around and say My love  Take my breath away Take my breath away

      I'm kInDa BoReD tHiS dAy... I sAw ThE "PaSt" haViNg Ft HiS aV.   aba hindi ko inakala na mabubuhay pa siya ulit sa oz. naiimbyerna ako't nakita ko pa siya... i was kinda nervous when i saw his NEW avatar moving... he stopped right in front of me... good thing i was talking with rainbow_val during that time... good thing i was good in faking my laughters sometimes... good thing... i never did such reactions upon seeing him like that... now i realized that his things were not really given to all people at oz... he transferred it... goddamn... such lies... lies, lies, lies... i'm sick and tired of it... oh i wish i never saw him that time... i wish i hoped that he will never come near me during that time... damn...    &nbsp;  i was very sure... that some part of me still missing him... after all his lies... damn i think i was starting to cry... everytime i post here in my blog... it's just always make me cry... argh.   last night (i guess), i saw kuya pao at the bus stop... we exchanged "how are you"s etc. until he asked me what happened to us... "Naku kuya, wag mo nang paalala...Wala na kami pakshet na tae yan" someone reacted... it was the girl i saw shouting one time at v/r, yummyhotchiq/phaubie, "marc? poor_marc?" argh... bat pa natanong un ni kuya? nakakainis e... ayan tuloy i have to fake it all over again...

      Haaayyzzz... ewan ko ba... break ko na kaya siya? I mean, ung recent bf ko T_T pano naman kasi i deadly miss him na. Huhuhuhu... sana naman magkita ulit kami... sana maka-ol na siya ng matagal-tagal sa oz... I REALLY MISS HIM NA TALAGA!!! huhuhu.  Newayz, mejo nag'heart-to-heart' kami ni ulan ngaun (rainbow_val sa oz hehehehe) all about sa mga ex namin... wala lang... biglang dun napunta dun ung topic hehehe...then un na nga... we exchanged some infos about our pasts... wala lang... parang reminsce lang... and i'm so shock dun sa ibang mga sinabi sakin ni ulan! nyahahaha......oh well... pero wala lang......  Naalala ko ung tinanong sakin ni ulan na kung mahal ko pa rin siya. And I said yes, pero hindi ko na sure kasi lahat ng feelings ko e naging SUKLAM na. You know? ah ewan....hindi ko talaga alam... but I text him last night... nagsosorry ako sa kanya dahil naging harsh ung way ko nung nakikipag-usap siya sakin. Naging masyado akong BASTOS at pinagtatabuyan siya masyado. Ewan ko... And yet, I was right, that 'SOMETHING' that makes me feel conscious was my heart.  Oh well... *takes a deep deep breath*

HOW DID YOU KNOW  Vocals: Gary Valenciano   I remember so well  The day that you came into my life  You asked for my name  You had the most beautiful smile   My life started to change  I'd wake up each day feeling alright  With you right by my side  Makes me feel things will work out just fine   CHORUS  How did you know  I needed someone like you in my life  That there's an empty space in my heart  You came at the right time in my life   I'll never forget  How you brought the sun to shine in my life  And took all the worries and fears that I had  I guess what I'm really trying to say  It's not everyday that someone like you comes my way  No words can express how much I love you   Repeat Chorus

      "Forget Me Not"  Listen to my plan to call him back 'cause I'm very bored Things seem so simple except love and what Heaven knows But I know the trick of finding him even in a beehive Hackneyed phrases can be used today as downers Deadly weapon and words are the same for lovers you'll see I know the magic of making him miss me at the daylight Under the bed I hid forget me not everywhere he can smell forget me not forget me not If he forgets me, am I supposed to forget him too? He never promises me so I can never blame what he'll do  I hope the scent of forget me not will make him really uptight tu tul tu tu tul tu tu tu... Under the bed I hid forget me not everywhere he can smell forget me not forget me not  Takenote peepol:&nbsp; I only posted it heh... not for any reason... peace ^_^

It's O.K." but I knew it doesn't last so long So I try to dream of you every night And I try to hold you every time  This is the land very far from you I never can hear your voice This is the land far from success So am I, no matter how you bet perfect starry sky, grand piano Quiet life I longed for is my enemy now Birds started for you left me here I forgot everything even your way of waving  In a dream, darling you stroke my arms and say "It's O.K. It's O.K." In a dream, darling you stroke my hair and say "It's O.K. It's O.K." but I knew it doesn't last so long So I try to dream of you every night And I try to hold you every time  Quiet life Quiet life  &nbsp;

In such times,  I see you laughing  whenever I close my eyes.   Until the day I reach eternal sleep,  that smiling face will  have to stay with me without fail.   People are all sad, so  they go and forget, but--   For that which I should love,  For that which gives me love, I will do what I can.   Back then, when we met,  it was all awkward.  We went the long way, didn't we?  We got hurt, didn't we?   Until the day I reach eternal sleep,  that smiling face will  have to stay with me without fail.

      I posted this to my second blog at  urlLink http://maidenbelle.tripod.com/krishna001 &nbsp;although none can see my posts so I will repost it here. Happy Reading! ^_^ &nbsp; Oh, and by the way, I would like to greet my beloved father a happy happy 61st birthday. Best Wishes Dad! I love you! Hope you read my stuffs! Hehehe &nbsp; -------------------------------------- &nbsp; Mahirap ang talaga makalimutan ang isang taong minahal mo ng todo-todo... Kahit anung gawin mo... Sa pang-araw-araw na buhay... Naaalala mo siya kahit anung gawin mo... Oo, tanggapin mo na lang na meron nang muling nagmamahal sau... Pero kaya mo bang mahalin din siya ng mas higit pa sa pagmamahal mo sa nauna mong minahal? Hindi natin masisigurado. &nbsp; Ngayon, tila napakabilis ng mga pangyayari kahit na sa loob lamang ng ilang araw ay may mga nagaganap na hindi mo inaasahan... Mga pangyayaring lalong magpapasakit sau. Magpapababa sau... &nbsp; Pero wala na e... Kasi hindi ka na mahal nung minamahal mo dati ng todo-todo... Meron na rin siyang iba gaya ko... Nalaman ko na rin na sinabi niya sa babaing pinakamamahal niya na hindi na niya ako mahal... Masakit hindi ba? &nbsp; Hindi mo naman siya masisisi... dahil pati ikaw ay nagiging tuliro na sa puso kahit na anung sabihin mo na siya rin naman... Aminin na lang natin...na mahal na mahal pa rin natin ang isa't isa... Kahit sa huling sandali ng ating pagkikita... &nbsp; Nagagalak ako at nagkakilala tayo... Hindi ako naggagalit, pero instead, nagsisisi... Regret. Alam ko may kanya-kanya taung dahilan kung kaya ay nagkasama tayo... Pero sana huwag mo akong ibasura at hindi na lamang iisipin... &nbsp; Muli, hindi ako galit. Natutuwa ako para sa inyo ng bago mong iniibig. Ang sakin lang, nasasaktan ako sa tuwing sasabihin mo na hinding-hindi kita sinasalo sa tuwing nahuhulog ka. Oo, naging selfish ako. Naging selfish dahil mahal kita. Pero ano pa nga ba? Tatawanan mo na lang ito hindi ba? Kasi hindi na tayo. At mahal na mahal mo na siya. &nbsp; Bakit pa kasi, kung kelan pa na nagsisimula na akong magmove on e anjan na naman ang isyu tungkol jan. Unti-unti na naman akong uulit sa simula. Unti-unti ko na namang gagamutin ang matagal nang sugat na nakalaan saking puso. &nbsp; Uulit akong muli sa simula. Sa pinakasimula. Pero tandaan mo sana, na kahit na wala ka na sakin puso at isipan, alam ko na may konting parte ka pa rin sa buhay ko na mahal na mahal pa rin kita. &nbsp; Kung binabasa mo ang sulat na ito. Nasa sa iyo na un kung iintindihin o hindi papansinin ito. Sana lang ay maging magkaibigan pa rin tayo.

      you know... when you're still in love with your ex... do you think you can make it to forget your feelings for him? well i don't think so... if you can't hide it, maybe it's just the right time to tell him to make yourself ease. does somebody agrees with me?  you know... it's kind of solitary... all alone, no one hugs you, no one kisses you, everything... especially when the one you love can't go here beside you. no one can amuse you, make you laugh, and express the feelings you've got that is not normal you can feel with your friends, relatives, and people that surrounds you.  well... i don't really know why i still love him? do you know the reason why? everytime i see him, talk to him, laugh with him, i just felt an enormous joy which i can't express... and my heart always says, don't let him go away... even if you're no longer together... just don't let him go away. do you think it's selfishness? even though he already got another girl he can love... well, maybe, more than he used to love me.  but my heart says hold on. do you think he's the one for me? actually, i'm still confused. full of mixed emotions. i can't say it. it's invincible, unbelievable. something like you're in a vertigo. it's impressing. :)
