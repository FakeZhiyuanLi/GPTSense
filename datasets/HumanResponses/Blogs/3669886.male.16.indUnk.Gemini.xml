      Alright. Well I have been very bored and at the same time incredibly busy during the last couple of days. You know what that means: RANT TIME!!! I have been doing WAY too much thinking than is humanly probable, and a lot of things have done a complete flip-flop in my mind. I have begun to notice how the smallest things cause unfathomably huge consequences. Has anyone ever said anything to you that just keeps on running through your head over and over? What if they had never said that? What if instead of uttering that one sentence, they had been silent? What if instead of asking that one fateful question, they had offered you a stick of gum? How much would your life be affected? All the time spent brooding and contemplating that comment would never have existed. So what would you have been doing? Maybe going for a bike ride that ends in you being hit by a car and put into a coma for the next 17 years. Maybe deciding to come home early only to find your mother minutes away from death lying on the kitchen floor, and you call the ambulance and save her life. But man cannot constantly think on the "what if". For that is a waste of time. What I am trying to get across to you is this: We have no idea how much our actions affect another person. What if a single IM session an AOL drives them to suicide? All because you were in a bad mood because you lost a bet, or something like that. One short conversation can change the flow of the rest of our lives. Why is that? WHY WHY WHY? Is it simply because we are human? I don't want to be that susceptible to things. I don't want people to have that much power over me. It frustrates me. So to the 2 (maybe) people that are reading this. I submit yet another poem, by Ryan Mastrangelo:  Call on your friends to pick you up What if they let you down? Everywhere you turn... Nothing Depression has a way of swallowing all What was that? What did you say? All the words Running through my head Try to stop the thoughts But like a bad addiction They return to haunt my consciousness Why do they talk? The Voices in my head. Why don't they shut up? And leave me to be alone.   I continue to think Perhaps more than I should Is that what you meant? Or have I retarded the meaning? Twisting your words in my mind Until they are what I want to hear To brood on things Spoken or not Straining my mind I just Need A break  So there. That feels good. Written for reasons innumerable. Posted to calm my mind. I am hungry, and I leave you all now to go eat soup. Please tell me what you thought.

      I had a party the other day. It was a lot of fun. We had smores, and jammed in my basement. I can write good. Like a first grader. But seriously, the party was an absolute blast. I hope everyone had as much fun as I did (which I don't think they did) frowny face. Anyway... Screw those spoil sports, I had fun. I was pondering life and that party and other things. I also had some serious ZZ-Top stuck in my head. So I went inside to watch King Of The Hill, which was not very funny at all (another frowny face) :(. I had all that going on, plus blasting PINK FLOYD in my room, and inspiration hit. I wrote a poem. I bet none of you can guess who it is about. (No duh it is a girl, but who?)  There comes a time when the sun fails to shine, And men fear to tread outside their front door. The land turns to the grey and gloom of the storm, And the beauty of the world seems gone.  It takes a keen eye to find the hidden wonders, In these times of depression and dark. What good is that eye if it hides from the world? What good am I if I hide what I see?  But I am trapped in a glass bottle, Cut off from the rest of the world. I cannot communicate with anyone, The glass muffles my voice, distorts my meaning.  If only I could call out for someone to join me, But if I see her, how to ask her? Am I forced to live alone, glass stifling my words? Watching others mingle outside, and wishing...  There it is. My first internet posted poem. Please leave me comments guys, I really want to hear what people think. Bye.

      Yes, Ryan Mastrangelo has officially entered the world of Blog! I know, I am happy too. No one Knows about it though, yet hee hee. It is My birthday! Yay! Sixteen; thank the almighty and everpowerful Lord I will be able to drive now. Freedom at last. And I can start dating. (I had taken a vow not to date until I could drive due to... Personal reasons.) I am awful at this. If it weren't for Emily I wouldn't have clicked on that damn link and now be writing this. Grrrrrr. Stupid internet. Oh well, it will be something to do over the summer. It feels good to have somewhere to vent. Ahhh. I have to figure out how to add in all of the cool gimmicks on my page. "You got the gimmicks on your gimmicks!"                     - James McCann ha ha. I just remembered that one. Oh god, Homeroom 418 kicked butt!  One more; "Tell her your OVARIES exploded ... OVARIES"                     - Me Okay.  I believe this is enough for one day. I will leave you with my thought during me FAILING my Geometry final. When babies are born, they are already nine months old. So why does your life begin the day you are born. I read an article in   Discover magazine which argued the finer points as to when life begins; and therefore when abortions should be made illegal. They did not mention the aforementioned fact, however. And in case any of you are wondering about my views on abortion, here they are: I am a Christian. Okay, that's out of the way. I believe killing is wrong. Life begins with sex. If something has the potential to become life, no matter if it is a cell big, it is. I think ending life is cruel enough, why must we stop a life from even having the chance to take its first breath? I am sorry guys. Almost feels like I am PMSing. I need some golden grahams....

      Hello,  This is going to be either the least significant post EVER by me... Or an okay one. I never know how these things turn out until they are done. But that's just the way the cookie crumbles.  I am going to be on vacation for a week. Yea, I am pissed off, too. And I don't know why. I love going to the beach, but for some reason I am dreading leaving tomorrow. I need some help. I don't even have a swimming suit that fits. Hooray. I went to a flea market the other day and bought (literally) 20 novels. I am planning on bringing most with me.  I am really bored. Try to e-mail me.  urlLink bigrappinryan@hotmail.com . I guess that one will be best. I most likely will not be able to check very often though. But please, a friendly e-mail cheers me up in ways you can't understand.  Ryan is tired. He went to help some friends move today and it ended up taking around six or seven hours. I was not happy. My arms are KILLING me. Wow, with the way I am complaining about stuff, you would think I had PMS. I gotta apologize guys. Because right now that makes more sense than simply deleting all of the previous comments. For some reason I have been really, really depressed lately. I can not figure out why. I have thought long and hard on the subject and every one of the possible answers makes no sense. I am considering going to visit some type of psychiatrist or therapist. Not only because of the depression, but because I have been thinking a lot about... Things. Maybe too much. Long story, and I won't bore you with the details.  I got a job! I am now employed by the Eckerd in the West Goshen shopping center. My first day was yesterday, and I worked for seven hours. Go me. None of it is really hard. All I had to do was stock products, and operate the cash register (I had much practice with that at McDonald's). It pays good, so I will probably be working there for a while.  I have no Idea why I am typing this. No one will ever read it. Except maybe Em. At least she's the only one who is nice enough to always leave a comment. I take that back, Lex usually comments too.  I would like to leave you all with some amazing poem or song that I have written, or maybe a deep and thought provoking question. But I can't. Sorry.  Oh, you may want to set your alarm on August 12 and 13 for 2:00 A.M. This is the best time in PA to see the perseids meteor shower. Just go outside and look to the northeast. I think. But you really should do it, meteor showers are really cool. And this one is supposed to be pretty big. All right, hopefully you guys will settle for a Queen quote (ha ha, alliteration!) because that is all you are getting.  Bicycle bicycle bicycle I want to ride my Bicycle bicycle bicycle I want to ride my bicycle I want to ride my bike I want to ride my bicycle I want to ride my Bicycle races are coming your way So forget all your duties oh yeah! Fat bottomed girls They'll be riding today So look out for those beauties oh yeah On your marks get set go Bicycle race bicycle race bicycle race Bicycle bicycle bicycle I want to ride my bicycle Bicycle bicycle bicycle bicycle Bicycle race    Oh boy I love that song. Goodnight, all.

      This latest entry contains subject matter that some people may find disturbing.&nbsp;Proceed with caution.   Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear  Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair  And for this, Fuzzy Wuzzy was an outcast from society. From birth, Fuzzy knew he was different. Bears would recoil in horror every time he was near. The sight of his wrinkled, hairless, pink body made even the strongest bears nauseous. At the age of seven, Fuzzy was forced to attend elementary school. As was expected, he was teased terribly. The teachers at FuzzyÂ’s school tried to help by punishing any student who made fun of Fuzzy. But nevertheless, the teasing sessions continued, maybe even more ferocious than before. The other bears refused to befriend him. It seemed almost as if they were afraid to catch his baldness. Fuzzy tried the public schools, but the constant ridicule drove him to seek private tutoring. Still, Fuzzy could not enter any public area without bears always making rude comments. This constant battery of ill-natured comments slowly whittled away at FuzzyÂ’s sanity. Towards the last years of his life Fuzzy began speaking to bears that were not there. His fragile brain had found a way for Fuzzy to obtain the one thing he had always wanted; friends. But FuzzyÂ’s view of himself was already warped beyond all repair. He refused to believe that anyone would ever want to be his friend. Sadly, even FuzzyÂ’s imaginary friends left him. Fuzzy was admitted to Marie St.JohnÂ’s hospital for clinically insane mammals. After three weeks of treatment, it seemed that Fuzzy was making a full recovery. After only a month, he was allowed to return to his family. The Wuzzys tried to make Fuzzy as comfortable as possible, but their efforts were futile. After only two weeks back in the real world, it was apparent that Fuzzy was returning to his old depressive ways. On July 19th, 1986 Lois Wuzzy found her 19 year old son Fuzzy dangling from the pipes in their basement. His suicide note included the following:  Â“I cannot bear to live in this twisted and hypocritical world anymore. I have been ridiculed beyond what anyone should be forced to bear. I cannot stand being a part of this awful society anymore. So I have taken my own life. My only regret is not having done it sooner.Â”   There you go. Further proof (as if it was needed) that I am losing my mind. I am seriously considering seeking professional treatment. Oh well, dinner time! COMMENT.

      Oh man am I bored. So let's add a post onto my blog and see who cares. NOBODY! Hooray! I actually did have a hell of a good time the other day. Me, Em, Alexa, Jen, Allison, and Josh Cole (whom I have never spoken to before) thought maybe mini-golf would be fun. It wasn't. They didn't have any shiny moving things to keep my attention. So my ADD kicked in around the second hole. That's okay, we only played 8 more after that.   Then I thought "hey Ryan, I bet you can't walk all the way around the edge of that water hazard without falling in." "Your on loser!" I lost. My right leg was soaked up to the knee. Luckily we stopped off at the Laundromat to wash some.... Things. I spent a dollar on the drying machines (25 cents a run) and my shoe was still wet, and now warm as well. But I had a good time. It was a fairly entertaining group of people. I should hook up with them again.   I have to go turn in a job application in an hour. I don't want a job. Work sucks. But I am in need of money. Very badly. So I will go. Two or three word sentences are very fun. Aren't they? I think so. Maybe not. I'll stop now. No I wont. HA HA! Oh man, I have no life.   I am going to the store now. I got a hammock as a present to my family. I bought it while I was down in Guatemala. Now I need to go buy little screw things so I can hang it. Hooray, now I have another place to think about nothing.   For some reason I am in a very bad mood. Maybe it is all the girl problems I have been having lately. Maybe it is the fact nobody is home so I have NOTHING TO DO. Maybe it is because I am stuck on a level on my legend of Zelda video game. Maybe it is because my mom is absolutely CONVINCED I am on drugs. I swear, now it is out of hand. Today she made me come and sit in the front seat of the car and tell her weather or not it smelled like pot. To make things worse, my father was chosen to be the guy to give random drug tests in his Army unit. So now she has access to free drug tests. She has not given me one... Yet. But it does not matter, I have never done anything! Sucks for her.   Blame it on the Tetons,  God I need a cola now....   Modest Mouse kicks ass    Random Improv Poetry Hour:    This week: Ryan Bitches!!!    Have you ever considered  What it may mean to me?   A small comment  Leaves a deep scar  When used at the right time.   I know no better  Ignorance is anything but bliss  Ignorance is a mistake.   But you can't see that,  You can't understand.  "Been there, done that"  But you can't remember it.   Try to wear my shoes  Walk a mile in my skin  Bet my bottom dollar  You won't say&nbsp;those things again.   The grass may be greener  On the other side,  But it will give you cancer  And steal your life.     &nbsp;

      Hello everyone... Or no one I really don't care,  &nbsp;  I have been away for 2 weeks in Guatemala. That is why I have not been updating. I didn't feel like paying $1.25 for an hour of internet. Yes, I am very cheap. I missed everybody, but it was definitely worth is. I did more thinking in those two weeks than I have in an entire school year.  &nbsp;  I saw some of the saddest things I have ever seen there. The sheer amount of poverty in the country hits you like a speeding train. I didn't even WANT to believe it the first few days. People living in a house bade out of barbed wire, corn stalks and burlap sacks.&nbsp; Seven people, two beds, and one room. Imagine being a girl (or guy) and going through puberty in a house where you have NO privacy whatsoever from the six other members of your family. These people had NOTHING. A group of us were able to get about 50 dollars per 13 different families and go out and buy enough dry goods to last them about 2 months.&nbsp; How big of a dent could that have made?  &nbsp;  The group I was with also visited a place called the Potters House. This is an organization that sits on the outskirts of the dump in Guatemala City. They are trying to educate the people (mostly children) in order to get them out of the dump. There are close to 11,000 people LIVING IN THE DUMP. 6,500 of them are children! And the government as well as the people pretend like they don't even exist. There is a 90,000 square foot area with 11,000 guatemaltecans (Guatemalan citizens) in the&nbsp;capitol city, and the government freaking pretends these people don't exist. Now I am all pissed off. These people scrounge through the garbage ever day looking for anything they might be able to sell. Even a little but of food to hold them over one more day. They earn the equivalent of about 6-19 u.s. dollars a MONTH.&nbsp; And that has to feed a family of five? How the hell do you pull that off? So this organization has taken around 150 kids and is attempting to&nbsp;educate them. They also serve them one hot meal a day. Most of the families won't even let their kids go, they are so dependent on them working. We brought Potter's house around 80 "care kits". That is basically a plastic bag with necessary personal hygiene items in it. Toothbrush, soap, washcloths, razor etc. We found out that they had been communicating with other groups (not us, this was pure chance) and asking for that exact same thing. They needed them because they were trying to take around 60 of the kids on a weekend retreat. We had brought exactly what they needed. It was great. Unfortunately we were not able to see all of the dump, but the smell was enough for me.  &nbsp;  Another thing we did was take up a collection for leggos and crayons in the elementary and middle schools in West Chester. We then filled up a good 5 or 6 big suitcases full and brought them to one of the schools in Antigua, Guatemala (where we were staying). IT was called excel Integrada. It was a school for very poor children who otherwise would not be able to have any type of education at all. When we brought the leggos to them, they called all of the students out and split them up into groups and assigned each of us as group of children. My group consisted of 10 pr so first graders who were all seven or eight years old. They were amazing. We had to teach them how to play with leggos. (Imagine being 13 or 14 years old and never having played with leggos before.) They were the happiest group of children I have ever seen in my entire life. All because of a few used leggos we brought them. I was amazed. They had the most creative imaginations I have ever seen. Building huge complicated things and all the time chattering away in Spanish. One kid put together a stack of green leggos about 6 inches high with one yellow one on top and told me it was a giraffe. I couldn't help but laugh. After that they made us join in a bunch of games with them. I had SO much fun. It was amazing. Little kids are definitely the greatest people ever.  &nbsp;  We also visited Hermano Pedro hospital, which is half hospital half mental ward. It, like potter's house, concentrates on children. I forget how many they have. Sadly we only got to visit it, we didn't have enough time to volunteer at all. This had to be the saddest thing I have ever seen. Period. Girls and boys hardly old enough to walk lying down inside metal cribs that eerily remains you of cages. The most exciting part of their day was when we came to visit. It broke my heart to see them use every ounce of their energy and coordination to push their wheelchair out of the room and awkwardly grasp your hand while muttering a barely audible "buenos dias". That hit me hard. I have never been so depressed in my life. It took every bit of self-control I had to keep myself from crying. I am getting there right now actually. LAter that week we went to an English church service at one of the local coffee houses. It was called "Higher Ground" (very clever). During the worship part I had to sit down because I actually DID cry. I think that is when everything that I had been closing my mind to hit me all at once. It was some heavy stuff. That was the first time I have cried in a long time.  &nbsp;  I wrote a lot of poems and stuff there, but most of it was bad. I think all of my writing is bad though. Here is a sample:  &nbsp;  How many  How much  How is it  How can it be  How...  Underneath the surface?  How many deaths,  Underneath the surface?  How many go hungry,  Underneath the surface?  How many children shoeless, homeless,  Underneath the surface?  How many suffer needlessly, endlessly,  Underneath the surface?  How can we help them that are  Underneath the surface?  How can we reach,  All of the unreachable?  How...  &nbsp;  When we have barely scratched the surface.  &nbsp;  There you go. I will probably be writing a lot more about what I saw and experienced while down there. It truly was a life changing event. Sorry about any problems here, I wrote this one king of fast. Seeing as this is my (by far) longest entry ever, I would really appreciate your comments. Just click that little link down there. It really isn't that hard. Come on, you can do it... Believe in yourself!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      So, Ryan is having a bad summer. So now YOU are going to have to sit there and suffer because YOU were dumb enough to click on that link in my profile. And I know how you work; after this introduction, nothing will be able to tear your hungry eyes off the screen. It's like a car crash, you don't want to look, but at the same time you  have  to look. And you cast a glance at my life discreetly. What you see scares you more than anything has ever scared you before. To continue with the car crash analogy; there is a mass of twisted burning steel smoldering in the middle, and radiating out you see more and more destruction. Charred and bloody bodies lay heaped at the side of the road like rag dolls. Men, women, and even children lay bleeding in the street, many missing limbs. It is an awful and disgusting scene of pure carnage, and let me tell you folks... The future sure don't look any better.  Wow, I sound like a mental case. Maybe I am.... In the course of me seeking counseling, now I have received a prescription for a medicine which it's main side effect is (drumroll) depression! As if I wasn't messed up enough. Apparently a lot of teens actually committed suicide after starting on this drug. But it is the best thing for me right now. So now my crazy parents are going to be watching for depression amid constantly questioning me on drugs.  God I am so pissed off right now I am gonna go. I don't feel like saving this and adding to it later, so here you go. a short and utterly pointless entry in which all I do is beat myself up about how much things SUCK, instead of getting off my lazy ass and doing something about it. Goodnight.

      Oh wow, getting your wisdom teeth take out really hurts. A lot. Thankfully my gums have stopped their bleeding. That was supposed to happen after 2-3 hours. It took me around 4 and a half. Almost five hours of walking around with an ice pack wrapped around my head and gauze stuffed halfway down my throat to soak up the blood. Every half hour (when I changed the gauze) I would try to swallow a mouthful or two of Schweppes so that I would not get dehydrated.  Thank god for doctors. Honestly, I do not know how people survived before modern anesthetics. I am taking the pain pills every four hours on the dot. It doesn't really hurt until they wear off...  I did, however, like being knocked out. First they gave my laughing gas, and now I know why they call it that. I got all light-headed and.... Happy. The nurse offered to turn it down a little, but I said no, that won't e necessary. But for some reason I kept taking the pulse thingy off of my finger and she had to constantly replace it. Then the doctor said "all right now I am gonna give you a little prick in your arm that is gonna make you feel real happy. After that I don't really remember anything. I woke up on a little bench thing and hour and a half later.  So my mouth is really sore right now. And it still tastes like blood. And the stitches are poking me. But I don't care because I have a combination of Ibuprofen and some other narcotic goin' through my system right now, and I feel fine, hey hey hey. So here's to you, Mrs.Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you will know, woah woah woah.  I think I am gonna fall asleep again. The darn anesthetic is still in my system. I been nappin' all the day long. That and playing Madden 2004, which I haven't played since like the end of football season. I fell asleep in the middle of the game. I lost.  Joe shenanigan and the Dirty Wires is going to rock the stuffing out of Henderson come school time. We have ALL seniority now, unless Relayer gets back together. It is good, but I am gonna miss good ol' Thurgood and Granted Nothing. They were good.  So bye bye for now comrades. I am eating a lovely dinner which consists of mashed potatoes and Jell-O. Yummy.

      Please disregard that title. It, like me, is very random.  I am really bored, which is customary of Ryan in the summertime. I am actually looking foreward to September seventh and the return to school. Now that Mr.Geanette is gone (unless that is just some cruel rumor) I don't think it will be that bad.  I hate summer, because all I have to do is sit around and read crappy novels and listen to the same old thoughts go around and around and around in my head. Not good thoughts either.  Bad ones.  The ones that make you want to cut into your own skull and  scrape away the frontal lobe of your brain just so that they will SHUT UP!  Woa.  Calm down there, Ryan.  So besides all of THAT; I really have not been up to anything. "Then why are you posting dumbass?"  Because I want to, thats why!  I spent a week down at the beach. It was beautiful. Except for the rain. I learned new things about my family.  For example: when my brother has nothing else to do, he talks.  Not even to anyone in particular, just so long as he is talking. Or rapping. Or repeating some RIDICULOUSLY STUPID PHRASE OVER AND OVER AND OVER. It got annoying. to say the least.  So I am writing a post to keep myself occupied. I fear I may be doing this all too often in the near future. I WAS talking to Pat and Em while writing this, but now they are both gone. The Johnny Winter CD ended and now I have switched to Yes. It is a live recording from a show in '96.  Good stuff, to say the least.  Ha ha. I just realized I ended the previous two paragraphs in the exact same way. Too bad, this isn't going to be graded.  Hey, maybe I could write a story. A strange story. About a fish. Who has a mid-life crisis, and he finds a magical oyster who gives him three wishes. But he blows them all and in the end he is just an unhappy fish again. DAMN. That got depressing. How come everything is doing that lately?  I need some help.  My mom baked chocolate chip cookies, they are really good.  Still warm.  Yum.  So I think I am going to go now. But first, lets see what I can pull out of my hat of amazingness.  here goes:  nevermind. I began writing a story right here, but it was taking too long, so I transferred it to a MS Word document. If it turns out any good, I will let you know. Until then, Adios!
