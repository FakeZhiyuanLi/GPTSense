       COOL PROGRAM   It's been a while since I've posted here, but I have a good little download for you.      It's called gAlarm.  It's an alarm clock that you can download.  I had problems with time when I was online.  I would miss the start of a show I wanted to watch because either I forgot to watch the time or I forgot that it was coming on.  With   urlLink this   small 266K download, you can set up to four different alarm times, you can use a general buzzer, a silent alarm or your own MP3.  It's a good program, and it's FREE.  I recommend you download it.    AN AWESOME CD   I have a new CD to praise.  It's called   urlLink Whole Lotta Blues: Songs Of Led Zeppelin  .  Right now it's not avaliable on Yahoo, but if they get it back or you see it in stores get it.  It's Led Zeppelin songs sung by blues legends.  The only thing more perfect would be AC/DC songs sung the same way.  But this CD is 99% perfect.  I'll get to that other 1% later.  Stand out songs would have to be  HeartBreaker  sung by Alvin "Youngblood" Hart,  Rock N' Roll  sung by Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown and the two versions of  Bring It On Home  sung by Robert Lockwood Jr.  Part one is sung the in traditional blues style and part two sung with an awesome rock/blues sound.  As for that 1% imperfection.  No  Living Loving Maid .  You can't have  HeartBreaker  without  Living Loving Maid .  It's just not right.  Other than that, there are no complaints.  Get this album.  It's well worth the money.

       GREAT BLUES ALBUM  It's time for me to hock another piece of music from my vast library.  Today it's an album called   urlLink Long Time Coming   by Jonny Lang.  If you're into blues, then you may find this album kind of weird.  It's not strictly blues, it's more of a blues/electronic funk sound.  A Kenny Wayne Shepherd meets Lenny Kravitz sound.  But it's a great piece of work.  Some really goods songs.  "Dying To Live", "Red Light", the title track,"Long Time Coming".  But "Goodbye Letter" is the best song on it.  It's just an uplifting song that makes you feel good, despite the subject matter.  Go there and listen to the samples.  If you don't like the blues, I think this may change some of your minds.

       A SLAP AND A TICKLE, AN ENDORSEMENT AND A RECOMMENDATION   Okay, for my first post I though I would endorse a product and give a recommendation for a song.  First, the endorsement: If you use an electric shaver, then you know that those damn things hurt sometimes.  Unless you have one of those expensive models with the gel that comes out of it.  I found a product that will stop that burning and itching of the electric shaver.  It's called  urlLink FaceSaver  and it's made by Remington.  It's a shaving powder stick.  It's made from Talc and Paraffin, so it's as soft a silk and it smells good.  I really like this stuff.  You can get it at a Wal-Mart near you.  Now my recommendation of a song.  It's  urlLink The Rain Song  by Led Zeppelin.  Windows Media Player is required to play the sample.  This is a great song, hell, I'll even go so far as to say it's beautiful.  Soft and slow, but has a very Zeppelin sound.  Download it or by Houses Of The Holy, you'll love it.

       NEW ENDORSEMENT   It's been awhile since I've updated this, but I've found a new toy.  It's a   urlLink  Black & Decker 6V Cordless Drill  .  I know, I know, 6V isn't much, but if you only do light jobs around the house then it's perfect.  I'm no Mr. Do-It-Yourself type of person.  The only tools I have are a few wrenches, pliers, a hammer and this new drill/screwdriver.  I'm like a kid with a brand new toy.  I'm going around the place looking for things to use it on.  Have you ever bought one of these and then went around the house looking for something to do with it?  And when you can't find something, you create something to do.  You go around unscrewing things just to screw them back in.  Don't lie, we've all done it.  The best thing about this drill/screwdriver?  The price.  $17 at Wal-Mart.  So if you can't afford a $50 cordless drill, get this one.  It works great and it's cheap.  One downside.  16 hour battery charge every time you charge it.

       It's been way too long.  But I have an album review for you.  It's    urlLink Get Born    by  Jet .  First, a brief bio on Jet.  They're a band from Australia.  That's all I know about them.  You may have heard one of their songs,  Are You Gonna Be My Girl , on an iPod commercial.  As most of my readers know, I'm not big on today's music.  Most of it is pure crap.  But every once and awhile there comes a band that breaks through the garbage and shines.  Jet's one of them.  They have an awesome sound.  Sort of an infusion of AC/DC, The Rolling Stones, Nazareth and maybe even The Beatles a little.  I've read even Oasis, but I don't listen them so I don't know.  Some outstanding songs on the album are Cold Hard Bitch, Move On, The Radio Song, Rollover D.J. and Are You Gonna Be My Girl.  There are a few wussy songs, Lazy Gun and Timothy, but for the most part it's a good album.  Check it out, you may like it.    I'm Such A Sellout.  But I Sold Out For Some Cool Stuff.

       TONY THE GERBIL   There once was a gerbil named Tony. Now, Tony wasn't like the other gerbils at the pet store. No, Tony was very different. You see, Tony was bent on world domination. That's right, world domination. Tony wanted to be supreme commander of all he surveyed, and more. He didn't like being cooped up in a small cage with a little wheel and a bottle of stale water. He felt that demeaned him. Tony knew from day one that he was meant for greatness. As a baby, he would dream that he was all powerful and omnipotent. He would envision himself atop a mountain of sawdust with no less than 4 girl gerbils to wait on him paw and paw. Maybe even a guinea pig or two, because you know Tony liked the big girls. But Tony knew that as long was he was stuck inside his cage in the back of the pet store, the world would never be his. Everyday he would see people come in and take the stupid dogs that did nothing but bark and lick themselves day after day. They would take the lazy, good for nothing cats. They would take the fish, birds and even the lizards. But not Tony.     " Why does nobody want me ?"  Tony would ask himself every night before he would cry himself to sleep. Then one day, a little boy came into the pet store. The little boy was full of energy and excitement. He was running all over the store looking at all the animals. Then the little boy came to the Hamster/Gerbil section and Tony felt his little heart beat faster.     " Is this it ?" He asked himself. " Is this the one who would help me escape from this metal hell hole ?"  Tony quickly worked to get himself presentable. He groomed his fur. He removed all the sawdust from this food dish and in a flash covered his droppings. He ran to the bars of his cage and look both sad and excited at the same time. The little boy stopped right in front of Tony's cage. He had a huge smile on his face.     " Mommy, mommy. This is the one I want ," he said pointing right at Tony.  Tony was about to burst with excitement. Finally, his time had come. He had been working on his plan for months on how to escape once some poor unsuspecting human decided to choose him.     The little boys mother came over and looked at Tony.     " Billy, are you sure this is the one you want ?" She asked him. Tony wanted to punch her in the face. With the same huge smile on his face, Billy said " Yeah. He's cool ." So the little boys mother picked up Tony's cage and began walking towards the check out. Tony's muscles were about to snap he was so tense. He had placed himself into the position he had planned on and readied himself for his escape. The little boy's mother payed the man at the checkout and went to grab Tony's cage.     " No mommy, let me carry him ," Billy exclaimed.     " Okay, but don't drop him ."     " I won't mommy ."  Billy took hold of the handle on the cage and walked to the door with his mother. Tony was so preoccupied with making his escape work, that he took no notice of all the thing that were beyond the pet stores front door.  As she opened the door, Tony's plan came to a head. As he knew would happen, the little boy put his finger in the cage to pet Tony. That's when Tony made his move. He took hold of the little boy's finger and bit down as hard as he could. Billy screamed and dropped the cage. Tony braced himself the stop.   SLAM      The cage hit the ground and the little popped open. Tony ran like a bat out of hell.     " Free. I'm free. After all this time, I'm finally free ."  Tony ran a few feet and stopped. He turned around to take one last look at his former prison. He lifted his little paw to flip them the bird, but before he could get his little finger up,  SPLAT .  A passing truck ran him over. Tony never knew what hit him. The moral of the story. A little gerbil can't rule the world. No matter how big the dream.  Or, stick to what you know best.    I'm Such A Sellout.  But I Soldout For Some Cool Stuff.

        TWO CD REVIEWS   As you can see, I've updated the favorites blog.&nbsp; I think it looks a lot better.&nbsp; Hope you enjoy it.&nbsp; Anyway, on to the reviews.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The first CD is:&nbsp;    urlLink Ted Nugent - Craveman    This is what rock and roll should be.&nbsp; Fast, nasty, loud, offensive and unapologetic.&nbsp; We all know Ted likes to sing about sex, and this album is no different.&nbsp; With songs like  Change My Sex ,  Pussywhipped  and my all time favorite,  My Baby Like My Butter On Her Gritz , he does't disappoint his fans.&nbsp; Then there's  Klstrphnky , don't ask me to pronounce it, and  Crave .&nbsp; Awesome songs.&nbsp; Crave has to be one of the top five songs I've ever heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Crave  is what rock and roll is meant to be.&nbsp; It's one of those song you have to crank your stereo up while listening to it.&nbsp; Then we have  Earthtones .&nbsp; This song's hard to explain.&nbsp; It's a softer side of Ted Nugent, well, as soft as Nugent can get.&nbsp;  Earthtones  is an instrumental, no lyrics.&nbsp; I want to say New Age, but it's not.&nbsp; But the title really describes it well.&nbsp; Click the link and have a listen to it to really know what it is.&nbsp; It's one of those songs that you want to listen to two or three times back to back because it's so good.&nbsp;  Craveman  really shows why Ted Nugent is still a God of rock and roll.&nbsp; He's really topped himself with this album.  &nbsp;  The second CD is:    urlLink Al Green - I Can't Stop    This is latest release by the Rev. Al Green.&nbsp; That's right, the man who wrote songs to get people in the mood became a Reverend.&nbsp; But this isn't a gospel album.&nbsp; It's&nbsp; a straight up Soul album.&nbsp; Every song on  I Can't Stop  sounds like it could have been written in the 70's.&nbsp; It's just got that quality to it.&nbsp; And Al Green's still able to get you in the mood for lovin.&nbsp;&nbsp; There really aren't any stand out song here.&nbsp; They're all good.&nbsp; But maybe  I've Been Thinkin' Bout You  could qualify as a possible stand out.&nbsp; It just make you want to get and dance.&nbsp; Awesome album.&nbsp; You really should pick it up.&nbsp; I'm not a huge fan of Soul music, but this CD may just change that.    I'm Such A Sellout. But I Soldout For Some Cool Stuff.
