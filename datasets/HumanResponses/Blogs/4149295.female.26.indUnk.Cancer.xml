      I have been with Jonard for more than four years now.  Some might think that four years is more than enough to get too used to someone, losing the thrill and excitement of a new-found love.  But, for me, that is not the case.  Even after four years, Jonard can still sweep me off my feet with his smile and make my heart skip a beat and hop for awhile everytime he enters the room.  He has this very strong, yet sweet and calming, effect on me.  He has the uncanny ability to bring out the lovestruck girl within.  And, often, I would find myself enthralled and shamelessly flirting back. ;)  Much of who I am now is greatly attributed to my relationship with him.  I just want to give him credit for all the goodness he has done to me by giving you a glimpse of the man I have truly learned to love and call my other-half.  To start off, Jonard tops the list of highly adventurous persons I have ever met. He is a free spirit.  He is not bound by rules and is full of spunk.  He fears nothing as long as he knows he is not doing anyone any harm.  And, he is always raring to have a good time making him a regular crowd favorite and the life of any party.  He is also extremely driven.  He is very passionate in everything he does.  Whether it's work, tennis, or the NBA finals, expect Jonard to be focused and engrossed with what's going on.  He always puts his mind and his heart on whatever he wants to accomplish which is a very good indication that this guy has a long way to go and will not have any difficulty attaining success.  His strong will is complemented by a soft and noble heart.  He posseses a strong moral disposition, always keeping the interest and benefit of others before his.  He never hesitates to lend a helping hand and has the purest intentions and kindest words to offer people who are in need.  On a more personal note, I can say that he is the yin to my yang.  He balances me out like nobody can.  When I am emotional, he is practical.  My being a worrywart is matched by his optimism.  I am a hopeless cook, while he can easily cook up a splendid meal with all the tricks he has hidden.  We complement each other in so many ways and I believe that makes it easier for both of us to cope with the chaos and confusion that life has to offer.  And, last but not the least, Jonard is a man of faith.  He is not only spiritually blessed but he also shows a great deal of faith on the people he loves.  He always pushes me to be the best that I can be and believes in my capabilities and what I can deliver.  He is always reliable and relentlessly guides me to the fulfillment of my dreams.  I never thought fairy tales came true. I mean, not at least for ordinary people like me.  At one point in my life, I found myself jaded with the idea of finding the right one, a perfect someone out there (don't we all go through this phase for some time?..hehe..).  But, when I met Jonard, he made me believe in happy endings again.  He made me realize that even if stories take certain twists and turns and some plots might be full of suspense (and horror for some!), a happily-ever-after is always in sight.  He is the best gift that this lifetime has offered me.  And, to show my gratitude to the One who lead him to me, I made a vow to make every moment count and to be the person that he is to me.  Hopefully, through my own little ways, I can give justice to the example he has shown and be worthy of the love I am given.

      I am the eldest in a brood of six. Oh yeah, my parents were very prolific.  We have a very big family, and I would not have it any other way.  Although, I remember it got a little frustrating back when I was still a moody teenager who wanted to just retreat to my own corner, 'twas very hard because I was sharing the room with four sisters.  Or, when slicing a small cake became a complex mathematical problem because we had to make sure there were enough slices for eight people, which then lead to a philosophical debate on who should get the extra piece or who deserved to get a second serving.  This usually ended with a neck-to-neck battle between the eldest and the youngest.  But, it was well worth it.  The house was always jam-packed.  Never a dull moment with six kids running around and making a ruckus.  A party was always expected when six teenagers gathered around the stereo and played loud music, or vegetated on the family sofa and laughed hysterically about nonsense shows on TV.  I miss my siblings.  Jonard would often tell me that i should have gotten used to it by now.  I have been away far too long that another day of being away is the same as the days that had passed.  But, a person can never get used to it i guess.  I miss those happy, carefree moments.  I miss spending afternoons playing games that were made up and dealing with imaginary, petty, and ridiculously childish issues.  Being the eldest, I would always defend them when their playmates made them cry.  I would oftentimes give up my share of candy so they can have more.  They were too cute and lovely to resist. Those were the good old days.  Now that we are no longer the carefree kids that we used to be, and my afternoons are no longer spent playing with them but instead earning a living, and life has proven to be tougher than all the games we used to play combined altogether, I need to be there for them more than ever.  I have to make sure that they have all they need to be the best they can be, that i will be able to defend them whenever the real world tries to take a piece of their self-esteem and confidence, to help them stand up whenever life knocks them out with a strong blow and they have little strength left, and to share all my blessings with them so that they can have enough to share with others.  So, come to think of it, although I am not with them, I am always with them.  For I have them where it matters, in my heart and in my soul.  They are my inspiration to always strive to be better so that i can serve as a good example for them to follow.  They push me to be stronger, strong enough to be there for them whenever they need someone to defend them, to help them, and to guide them in this crazy game called life.

      I was chatting to a good friend last Friday...you know, usual friendly banter.  We asked how each other was doing..what's up...what's new...until we got to the juiciest topic of all: LOVELIFE.  Apparently, she is in a stalemate.  She has fallen hard for someone who seemed to like her enough to spend some time with her.  But, not quite enough to commit and have a meaningful relationship.  To add insult to injury, the guy blatantly admits his incapacity and my dear friend is willingly embracing her tragedy.  This might be a common setting, you might say..everyone goes through this crap at least once.  But, that is not why her story got to me.  I am more in the line of thinking: "WHY DID IT END UP THAT WAY?".  As the cliche goes, "It is better to have loved and lost, than not to have loved at all".  Sweet, but I also think it is very sad and quite masochistic.  I mean, shouldn't love make you happy?  Then, why is it punishing my friend with a regular dose of pain and rejection?  Well, I will answer my own query with one word: MODERATION.  I think the reason why most people (I, myself, have been a victim more than once.) fall into the trap of unrequited love is that they have forgotten the first rule in starting relationships: LEARN TO LOVE YOURSELF.  Do not take me wrong, I am not advocating narcissism.  But, if you think about it and think about it really well, learning to love yourself helps you set boundaries.  Sometimes a person gets too engrossed with  pleasing others, even when they are not worthy to be pleased, to the point of losing herself.  She (let's use she for simplicity's sake) does not realize that she is investing too much emotions to the wrong cause and, more often than not, channeling her love to the wrong person.  Hence, when she reaches a point where things get way too unfair and awkward, she gets the shock of her life when she finds out that both of them do not have the same expectations, they are not on the same page, and they are not speaking the same language (voila!).  If one factors in moderation into the equation, then you get a formula that will balance out unrequited love.  By being moderate, a person will learn to be more cautious knowing that real relationships that are for keeps do not happen overnight.  She will be able to assess how much they mean to each other and decide if she really wants to be with that person not because he is simply unattainable, but because it is her happiness.  By being moderate with actions, decisions, and emotions,  one can think clearly and read the signs along the way.  Hopefully, an early warning of rejection will soften the blow.  Love is strong, I know.  But, I don't think it's cruel.  If it's real love, then it should bring out the best in people, not make them insensitive to each other's pain.  By being moderate when matters of the heart are quite unclear (yet), then you are protecting yourself from any disillusionment caused by false hopes, empty promises, and uncompromising relationships.  I know that this is way too ideal.  As always, easier said than done.  But, I think it's worth a shot.  Besides, if you cannot learn to love yourself, then how can you expect others to love you the way you want them to.  What if he is Mr. Right, you say?  Well, for one thing, if he doesn't love you back, then I don't see why he should be Mr. Right.  Moreover, I would like to think that dealing with Mr. Right does not entail a lot of pain and rejection...otherwise, how could that be right?

      I always wondered where the phrase "two cents' worth" came from...I know what it meant figuratively but I was just wondering how it came about...So, I did some research from the Internet (where else?!)...and I found a very interesting article:   put in one's two cents' worth   by Mark Israel   "This expression meaning "to contribute one's opinion" dates from the late nineteenth century.  Bo Bradham suggested that it came from "the days of $.02 postage.  To 'put one's two cents' worth in' referred to the cost of a letter to the editor, the president, or whomever was deserving".   According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the first-class postal rate was 2 cents an ounce between 1883 and 1932 (with the exception of a brief period during World War I).  This OED citation confirms that two-cent stamps were once common:  "1902 ELIZ. L. BANKS Newspaper Girl xiv, Dinah got a letter through the American mail.  She had fivepence to pay on it, because only a common two-cent stamp had been stuck on it."  On the other hand, "two-cent" was an American expression for "of little value" (similar to British "twopenny-halfpenny"), so the phrase may simply have indicated the writer's modesty about the value of his contribution."     From the site: http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxputino.html    See, my blog can also be educational! ;)     "Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh. W. H. Auden (1907 - 1973)"

      It's been a decade since I left home.  My father was right.  When my mom asked him if they should allow me to get a college degree in Manila, he said once he allows me to leave, he'll have to let me go in the truest sense...that i will be moving out of their care and start living my own life....indepedently...freely...detached...  But, if that was the price to pay for me to have a better future, they willingly granted me the opportunity to study in one of the best universities in the country.  True enough, i left and i am still in a relentless journey.  I had a kick from my college years.  Some would call it the best years of their lives, though I would not consider them my best yet (for the benefit of the years to come).  Nevertheless, I owe my folks big time for letting me go and be myself.   College life was a rollercoaster.  It was exhilirating.  There were times when i found myself shamelessly throwing my hands in the air and screaming my guts out of excitement and delight. But, at some points, i also needed to close my eyes, fervently praying my fears and apprehensions away.  It was definitely an awakening.    After spending four crazy years in QC, i went for the next challenge that every fresh graduate must face head on.  That is to get a decent paying job in the CBD.  Makati then was considered to be one of the most convenient places to work at, mind you.  If my memory serves me right, major parts of Libis where still under construction.  I always considered working in Makati to be "prestigious" (for a lack of a better term) and exciting for one can easily mix career and leisure.  After being tortured by a tyrannical boss, one can then transform at exactly 6pm and rub elbows with the bigwigs and top-notch working class while sipping over-priced coffee at Starbucks 6750.  Plus,the fact that I will be sharing a condo unit with my best college buds made it all the more alluring.  Makati was definitely the way to go...   To cut the long story short, it was where it all started but it did not end there.  After finding a stable niche in IT and successfully proving the fact that romance is definitely sweeter in the work place, my beau and I found ourselves on the road from makati, to Hong Kong, to Singapore, and finally, the US where we are currently based (and hopefully staying for awhile).  Point is I've witnessed my own metamorphosis: from a certified  "promdi"  very eager to take her slice of the Manila lifestyle, to a very relieved  "SMEG"  (sure ME graduate, as what they called it) making sure that I pass all my core subjects so as not to jeopardize my status, to a newly-grad rookie giving out resumes as if they were fliers to an underground rave party , to a party-crazed yuppie trying to get hold of fliers to the latest underground rave party, to a struggling young employee like a worker ant trying to make myself noticed to the omnipotent powers that be, and finally, a confident professional who knows my skills and capabilities by heart but not forgetting that there are still alot of things to learn and growth to sustain....   I have grown from being a lost girl who desperately tried to seek happiness and meaning in one to many failed crushes, flings, and what-have-you...to a disillusioned individual realizing that relationships are not black and white simply because the world does not revolve around you...to a self-confessed romantic trying to make my world a better place by holding on to a fairytale...and finally, to a happy and grateful woman who has finally found contentment and peace from the person who people lovingly refer to as "THE ONE"...  I am all these and more....Looking at the past ten years, I would say I have done my loved ones, and most especially myself, proud...and I know that life, together with destiny and luck, are bound to bring more experiences my way...and i say BRING IT ON!    "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- I took the one less traveled by,  And that has made all the difference. Robert Frost (1874 - 1963), The Road Not Taken

      Before I start ranting or raving, I just want to make it known that this blog is dedicated to my partner-in-crime...to the fortress i rely on when i am disheartened and low...to my proud advocate when i am triumphant and delighted...and my reliable companion during the moments in between....    "Do not think that love, in order to be genuine, has to be extraordinary. What we need is to love without getting tired... I have found the paradox that if I love until it hurts, then there is no hurt, but only more love."-- Mother Teresa
