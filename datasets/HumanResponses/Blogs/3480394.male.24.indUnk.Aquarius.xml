      For my first real blog entry (considering the previous one was a bit of a waste of time) I’ve decided to attempt to review the new Final Fantasy game.  I say “The new Final Fantasy Game because I’m not sure if the title Final Fantasy X-2 is supposed to be pronounced as ten-two, twelve or ex-two.  But anyway…  Having been a fan of the series since playing FFVIII I had high hopes for the latest game in that it’s predecessors have set such high standards.  The game (as you may already be aware) is the first sequel in the Final Fantasy series and reprises the world and many characters from FFX.  My initial reaction to this is with some dismay as it strikes me as almost more of an extra game disk than a new game with so many environments, characters and fiends being so similar to FFX.  However, the style of the game takes a more light hearted approach and adopts a less linear style to it’s gameplay compared with its recent predecessors which helps to warm the gamer to it.  We begin two years on from the events of the previous game with Yuna (the Grand Summoner from FFX) and Ricku (her Al-Bhed guardian) teaming up with new character Paine (a mean and moody biker chick) to form a group of spherehunters known as the Gullwings.  Spheres, if you’re not aware are important recordings in Spira’s history which have been lost and their recovery can provide important information as well as financial rewards.  Yunas quest is strongly driven by a sphere showing somebody that looks decidedly like ‘him’ (why can’t they just refer to him as Tidus, that was his name for goodness sake, it’s really irritating) and her attempts to find more spheres that might help her to find him despite what seemed like a fairly permanent exit at the end of FFX.  The usual plots ensue, with a high standard of stunning animation sequences and countless hours of play.  A nice touch for this game has been the addition of dress-spheres.  With the Aeons gone and only three characters to play as (compared with the usual five or six) the dress-spheres provide much needed variety to battle sequences.  They enable each character to don different outfits with differing statistics, for example a Warrior dress-sphere has high levels of physical defence and strength whilst a Black Mage has poor strength but good magical defence and can learn various attack spells.  Throughout the game the user can find more powerful dress-spheres as well as learning new abilities associated with their existing ones.  This game has considerably more mini-games and “missions” than recent Final Fantasy titles and this enables the user to try missions in different orders depending on their whim.  There is a meter for percentage complete, however, to achieve 100% the gamer must complete every mission in the game (somewhat tedious).  I, for example, despite taking some 40 hours to complete the game only achieved 70% complete at the end of the game.  It does however provide the more hardcore of gamer with a reason to replay the game.  Overall the title has, in my opinion, the weakest plot of any Final Fantasy game I have played but is still an engrossing, cinematic style experience which might not attract new gamers to the series but will certainly be a case of ‘usual service’ for fans of Square-Enix’s long running series.  It still remains to be seen whether they can effectively inject new life and new ideas into the next game if Final Fantasy is to remain a gaming institution.

      Greetings, welcome to my  first ever  blog  The concept behind this blog is pretty vague so I apologise for the random selection of topics I’ll probably be discussing over the forthcoming weeks.  Hopefully with time I’ll hone it into something coherent (or maybe not)…
