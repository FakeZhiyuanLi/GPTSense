       True Crime The Streets of LA  First I have to say I didn't enjoy the graphic really, It's definitly Boring! The designes of streets and the way the cars crash or explode is not so graphically good. In my opinion this game is a half Matrix Reloaded and half GTA Series.With a glancy look at the fights that are really not so natural and the way of driving in streets(which is mostly a chore)you will get to the same result as mine.it also reminds me Max Payne!! But all of the game is not so bad.one of the good points in the game is that you can have the story go in many ways.for example if you fail a mission you can continue the game and see the results and its effect in the story.and sometimes the episode could be played in 2 or more ways to continue the story. I don't know what would you say but i enjoyed the dialoges in the game. and at the end I have to say sth about the story that I really don't know weather it's a good one or not.Please help me findout about it and give me your opinions. About the system requirements i have to say that it won't cost you much. So enjoy the game!

        an incredbly nice action game which i really enjoyed playing. the game cutscenes are the same as the movie with the best quality i have ever seen.  the story is also the same as the bookes and the movies but the makers tried to make it a little bit more difficult.so they changed some parts of the story. the characters are really well made and their movements styles are individual. in an interview inside the game(one of the feautures that you can unlock inside the game after finishing every level) sean astin(sam) mentioned that the character of sam is quiet soft and kind and ofcourse very couragous for those he likes but in the game some of these personalities have been ommited.for example sam fights like a great warrior and even in some opportunities he kills his enemies very badly.at the end i have to say some of the last levels of the game are definitly very hard so you would have some trouble finishing the game. if you want to enjoy the game, i recommand you to have tese system requirements: VGA:G-force 3 or higher or ATI Radeon 8500 or higher with 64 MB RAM on it CPU:Intel 1500 or higher RAM:256 MB or higher by any chance these are not the minimum system requirements but they are only what i friendly recommand you to have to enjoy the action in the game. Thanks for reading
