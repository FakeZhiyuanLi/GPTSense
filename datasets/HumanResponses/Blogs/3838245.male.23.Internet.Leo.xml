      ahh.. the last few days were the busiest days of my life .. but came very fruitful..  I felt the power of time .. how it makes one very sad at a momment and very next momemnt it makes the same person very happy ..  Well !! It was placement season ,(it's not yet over.. only the first round is finished) ... I got placement in Oracle .. a company where, I used to think; that only geeks or toppers go .. but finally I am there...  ... any way I am little relieved ... but these teacher will not let us enjoy our final year... it's our final year and they have imposed new rules..that we have to attend 85% of the classes ... wtf.. Is it a college or a jail.. any way only one year ... after that I'll be free

      .. it was amazing.. though from traditional perspective  it won't give any good impression .. but I enjoyed; enjoyed a lot last night... First time in my life I got drunk , it wasn't the first time when I tasted wine ... but it was the first time when I really felt that I am drunk... and what followed next was also unforgettable ... all of us, were truely ourselves... no  hypocrisy... just the reality ... and the confessions .... wow.. I really got to know some new facts ... can't write it here .. becoz some of those were really personal..  ... the only thing that I want to do now is I want to get drunk once again ...

      Come  come along with me to the plateau in the black sky with a thousand stars all bright which melt with your gentle smiles  Come sweet angel let's stand on this cloudy floor where we don't need to close our eyes in our place so high  Silence listens to our every breath And with the morning sunrise We'd have made a dream to try

      I am very lazy .. and this can be seen here .. last time I updated my blog after more than 15 days and today it is after a week or so...  well, the new month has come with Friendship day to begin with .. I had a good time on first ... talked to some of my long lost friends... All of them are very busy in their work.. Mukesh is not getting much time off from his job, Yashvir is prparing for his job interview.. I am sure he will get some good job. Sabi is also very busy with her work. I think I am the luckiest of them. Still in college and enjoying my days but I really miss them a lot ...  Well, apart from the 1st august, rest of the week was as usual. Didn't do any productive work .. wasted mine as well as Vidit's time... I think, in last week ; almost every day we planned to go  for Lakshya but somehow we couldn't make it ... Ok Vidit never mind .. we will see it tomorrow... lol ..    Yesterday was good for me in the sense that I communicated with 3 beautiful ladies ... first got mails from Indrani and then chatted with Yashvir's friend and in the evening talked with Sabi on phone :) ..
