      I’m having one of those periods where you feel lackluster. I feel it at work, but especially personally. The thoughts keep racing through my head….my career isn’t getting off the ground, I’m not making the money I need to make, I eat too much, I weigh too much, I don’t look pretty enough, I don’t say the right things, I don’t do the right things….blah blah blah.   So I try to balance it the words of Padre Pio: Pray, Hope, and Don’t Worry. I even have that phrase displayed in my office, just to remind me. But I do pray, I do hope, but I worry 25 hrs a day.   It’s a faith and trust issue. Letting go and trusting God to work in my life would lessen my worry tremendously. Not doing so is saying that I don’t completely have faith in God to shape my life in the way that’s best for me.   I suppose that’s the eternal struggle in living of a life of faith.

      Until the last couple of years or so, I had a problem learning how to enjoy simple things. I was so overcome with worry and anxiety in my life that I couldn't let myself enjoy anything.   Little by little, I'm getting there.   Today was definitely a simple pleasure, and I enjoyed every second of it.   when I moved here last July, I rented the upper part of an old home. when the lower part became available, I jumped on it, even though the rent was higher.   Now I have two bedrooms, a dining room, a large kitchen, a frontdoor, a back door,a basement, and a yard. I feel like I almost actually own a home.   My father is up this weekend, and he brought my grandmother's dining room table for me, so today I bought a very pretty tablecloth and table runner...sort of shabby chic style. I bought a tomato plants and sweet basil and strawberries and spent the evening with my dad planting them in my backyard. As I filled up my new watering can, I felt giddy. Actually giddy.   And I thanked God where my life is now as opposed to where it was a year ago today. I moved to a new city, I got a new job, I passed a bar exam,and I have this great apartment (even though old homes bring a host of little problems).   Sure, I pat myself on the back a bit. It took a lot for me to make this move, coming here with no job and enough money for just a few months. But it's because of Him. I completely credit God for all of this.   I have a long way to go. I still am struggling to pay my bills, to get my license to practice (being held up for an ethics investigation because of financial problems and a bankruptcy), but I'm slogging along.  God is good, and life is good, and simple pleasures are so incredibly wonderful.

      for a brief administrative message.  Thanks to all who emailed me about comments not showing up. They weren't showing on the blog, nor were they being emailed to me.  I think it was the template I was using. Hopefully it's now fixed.   Comment away and let's test it out!

      I watch TBN for fun. I'll admit it.   I've been tremendously entertained the past two weeks by  urlLink Jentzen Frankin's  presentation called :   Keep Your Underwear On: Control Your Need to Breed   You know, I can't imagine a Catholic priest standing up and giving this speech, but I think I'd pay to see it.   I remember saying the same thing here on the blog a month or two ago about people who are into the toothing craze.   Keep your underwear on!!!

      God, in His infinite and perfect Wisdom, has allowed me to make so many mistakes in my life such that I’ve become a very, very late bloomer. My birthday is about a month away, and every year at this time I ruminate, so bear with me. At any rate, most of my peers have been in settled into their careers for 10 or 12 years by now. Most of them are married and having kids. And here I sit, trying to begin my career with no man in sight anytime soon.   A co-worker told me yesterday that she’s pregnant. And it made me wistful. She was an older bride (36) and she’ll be an older mom, so it’s still entirely possible for me.   But I felt wistful.   Being a late bloomer has its advantages. I think I’m more sure of what it is I actually want now. I’m hopeful that once I do find a husband, I’ll be going into a marriage for all of the right reasons and it’ll have a better shot at lasting.   But honestly, right now it just feels a bit lonely, and a bit hopeless, which isn’t very faithful of me, because in God there’s always hope.   I’ve been thinking about all of my ex-boyfriends and all of the mistakes I’ve made. Some of it, I wish I could change. Some of it was unpleasant, but I learned important lessons.   And that’s the beautiful gift of our free will. God let me go, He let me make those bad decisions. And that’s the most loving thing He could have done for me, because now I know that I’ll never make them again.   God’s greatest gift to me has been my imperfection

      I need a prayer chain. My best friend from back home is in the middle of a custody battle (for the second time) with her ex-husband (who is my ex-boyfriend. Don't ask.).  Without getting into details, just let it be said that he's not a nice man. In fact, he walks around pretending to be a devout Catholic, but he's far from it.   And two young children are caught in the middle of this.   Please keep them in your prayers if you can.

      I hesitate to say that I'm in a spiritual dry period, because I think that sounds too harsh. I think that life has just gotten in the way. Rather, I've let life get in the way. And when I think about it, the whole point of spirituality is learning how to live your life in your faith. So I suppose I'm failing a bit right now in that praying seems difficult, Mass seems difficult, my mind is full of worry.   I'm sitting here at home, waiting for a washer and dryer to be delivered, somewhat thankful I'll be at work later today. But I think about how I hate having to do things like this alone...picking out things like washers and dryers for a home...not knowing what to get at Home Depot...feeling frustrated.  I suppose the answer is just to keep plugging along, praying even when it's a struggle, and thanking God every single day for the things that He's given me. The rest will follow.  -----  My photoblog is now operational at the main part of this site (www.7nineteen.com).

      Welcome, welcome.   Here I am in my new domain, with a new design. I'm using WordPress for my photoblog, but it has the capability to do only one blog per installation. Instead of going through the hassle of doing multiple installations and designing two sites, I thought I'd use Blogger for ReVersion. Simple enough! The commenting system here is a bit different but it's livable.   And best of all, I'll be spending less money per month by having everything over here on one domain.   Bear with me while I get my Blogroll back in order and add some finishing touches, but ...it's done.  Whew!

      You may have noticed that my posting here has slowed down quite a bit.  &nbsp;  Frankly, I'm disheartened by the tone I see on so many Catholic blogs.  &nbsp;  I've quit reading several, and my blogroll is shrinking rapidly.  &nbsp;  I feel lost out here in St. Blogs.  Lost and lonely.  &nbsp;  I was going to write a big post about my feelings about the entire thing, but I just went over to  urlLink Mark's site and found that he is feeling the same things, and saying exactly what I wanted to say.&nbsp;

      While stopping in my favorite café for an iced mocha this morning before work, I found this interesting little travel&nbsp;pamphlet for a 11 day tour of Europe: &nbsp; "The Da Vinci Mystery Tour: On the Trail of the Grail"  &nbsp; The subtitle is "Explore Your Faith." &nbsp; Well, naturally I was intrigued and took one with me for further perusal. &nbsp; Let's see what's inside, shall we? &nbsp; The inside cover starts with the question:  &nbsp;  Did Jesus actually take Mary Magdalen as his wife?... It's time to examine the evidence for yourself. On this fascinating and provocative tour , you'll see and experience firsthand the msysterious places and compelling clues that have sparked worldwide debate.    &nbsp; The itinerary is quite interesting. You can see it for yourself  urlLink here.  &nbsp; It's a good thing I just bought  urlLink this book.     &nbsp;

      My mom and my dog left a week ago after being here since Easter.   I'm lonley, of course. It's amazing, how when your mother is around, your problems don't disappear, but they don't feel as overwhelming.   Of course, like so many people, I never appreciated my mother until I grew up a bit and went out into the world, and didn't have her around all of the time. Oh, how you appreciate your mother then, on those lonely nights when you're sick, or you're depressed, or you're so lonely that you cry.   And it's amazing what a good bowl of homemade spaghetti will do for one's spirit.   I've said all of these same things about the Church, about God, about the Blessed Mother ...minus the spaghetti, of course (but I bet God could make a killer sauce if he wanted to).   I'm finally starting to get it...

      somtimes you just have those days. those days that stop you in your tracks. those days that bring you to decisions.  work stress. regret over poor decisions, especially where men are concerned. financial frustrations. an annoying neighbor. eating poorly. sleeping even more poorly. pounding headache. and tears. many, many tears.  the decisions: how much will you let other people bother you? how long will continue to eat poorly? when will you make an effort to sleep through the night? where do you want to be a year from now?  how much longer are you willing to exist this way?

      life is messy. who doesn't realize that?   so why do we have to make believe that it's all so sweet and profound. it's really not, you know.   sometimes passing a homeless man on the street isn't profound. sometimes seeing&nbsp;a child getting yelled at in wal-mart isn't&nbsp;profound. somtimes a flower is just a damn flower.   and&nbsp;sometimes it's just so incredibly sad that it's wasteful and stupid and sinful.  life is messy.  why is everyone so afraid of that?

      all moved into our new office building, but it's far from done. we work alongside construction workers now, ears ringing from drills and hammers.   good things about the new office: my completely modern new office furniture. my view out to a small lake and trees. a 7 minute drive from home, 5 in light traffic. the new café on the way where after only two days, the barista recognized me and&nbsp;said, "hi, red!"&nbsp; (it's the one shocking red streak in my hair that makes me memorable, you see).   ----- last week marked my first anniversary in this city.   i've come pretty far.

         &nbsp; when i was a teenager "thirtysomething" was the popular show.  i remember watching it every week and being unable to imagine being that age.   then in a blur, you wake up one day and the ripe tomatoes in your garden excite you more than anything else in your life, and you realize that you  are  that age.

      i was frantically driving towards downtown earlier this afternoon. my upstairs neighbor locked his keys in his car and then locked the garage door and shocker...couldn't get into his apartment. because our landlords are constantly, awol, i got a call at work. i thought about telling him that i couldn't leave, but i know what it's like to be alone in a new city and to have everything seem so hard, and so frustrating. so i said i'd come home and open the garage and let him get his keys.   secretly, i was happy to leave the office.  but that's all another story.   the point of this story is that, as i drove,  urlLink this song  came on the radio and i started singing at the top of my lungs in my closed up, air-conditioned car.   then i realized that i was the only funny scene from  urlLink "white chicks."   oh, how wonderfully, beautifully lame i felt.

      there are two sisters in my church. they are old. so old that i won't even venture a guess as to how old. they are so old that they both look like shrunken heads. they wear white hose, white shoes, handmade royal blue dresses, and white scarves on their heads. each week, they dress exactly alike, in those same clothes.   from the first, i was drawn to them for some reason. i'm just like that. i'd rather sit next to someone "interesting" in church because, well, it seems like what one  should  do in church.   the sisters fight a lot during mass. they've even been known to shove at each other a bit. it's quite comical, really.   today, before mass started, they were getting their coins ready for the collection basket. and then i heard raised voices.   in her shrunken head voice (imagine what a shrunken head would sound like...that's exactly how they sound), one of the sisters said: "this is church! i'm going to go right up to the front and tell them all how you steal from me!"  it was the only smile that crossed my face all day.

         my new roommate.   she came from the humane society. she was a stray. they guess she's around 5 yrs old.   she can’t see very well. she keeps running into things. she can't see a treat right in front of her eyes. she never blinked as the flash from the camera went off in her face. i wasn't told this when i got her, but now it doesn't matter. if she has a vision problem, then it just means she needs me more.   she doesn't play with her bones or her toys.  she pees on my carpet every so often.   she’s great on a walk.   she is nice to my rabbit.   she has matted fur that we're going to shave off next weekend. we just need to start over.   she's not eating much of her food, but she begs me for tortilla chips.   she follows me everywhere, even to the bathroom.   she is afraid to go through doors, so she crawls through on her belly.    she’s very timid and scared and gentle and sweet.   she needs a tremendous amount of patience and love.

      i rent the bottom of a large, old house. i used to rent the top of it, but moved down to the bottom about a month ago. (separate entrances, so i don't share space)  i never realized how creaky the floor upstairs is, or how much you can hear from up there, until my new neighbor moved in.   he's a new resident at the hospital up the street. at 4 am most mornings i can hear him up there clomping around.   it never fails to wake me up.  and i haven't failed to be grumpy about it.  but on the 4th of july, my neighbor rang my bell and asked me if i could hear him up there, and if so, he was terribly sorry.   i smiled and said it was ok, that he can't help the creaking floor, and that i can sleep through anything (a lie).   this morning at 4 am, i awakened to the sound of clomping feet, but it didn't seem to bother me.  it was still dark out. i got out of bed, turned on the light above the garage for him, and got back under the covers.   and i slept.

      i used to know someone once, not so long ago. i think about him more than i find comfortable, or desirable. he said something wise. actually, he said many wise things (and a fair amount of not-so-wise things). he said:  "start your life with the steady foundation of a good dog, then build up from there."   seems to make sense.

      i found a photo online of someone i slept with last summer.  it was a photo of him with his new girlfriend.  that’s the thing about online things…there’s no escape.  anyway, i showed it to a co-worker, asking all the usual questions: “she isn’t that pretty, right? i’m much cuter, right? i can do better than him, right?”  she asked when I was with him and I said, “a year ago, before i moved here. it was all downhill from there.”  and then i immediately stopped myself. and she stopped me too. and we both said, “that’s not true!!!”   my life is completely different than it was a year ago, and completely better. and i don't regret losing this person.  i didn’t mean what i had said. i thought it was flip and sort of funny, and i said it without thinking. it's an old habit of mine...putting a crappy spin on things.  and  it was out there. i put that energy out into the ether, and somehow, i can’t imagine how that’s a good thing.  it was a quiet lesson in the importance of watching one’s words.
