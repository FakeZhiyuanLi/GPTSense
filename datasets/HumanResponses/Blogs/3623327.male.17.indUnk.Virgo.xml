      when to school as usual today , and brought the wrong suona to school , where almost all the notes are nt accurate .after that haf lunch with friend at nafa, and followed them to sim lim to buy printer. Mr low also called mi to ask mi to go to teach a sch for today as the instructor was unavalaible , but very sad  have lesson ....... haiz ... wasted..  than Mr ng [conductor for siling sec sch] , called mi , and told mi that mr lee [woodwind instructor of siling sec] will be leaving .and previouly mr ng has told mi that he will be also leaving after the speech day performance. therefore 2 instructor will be leaving sch ler ... haiz ... Mr ng was the conductor for siling almost 20+ years , its really a waste to leave this sch after 20 years of teaching . while mr lee was my first co or suona teacher i met .. he is my first teacher .i am really quite sad abt this when i heard the news. i respect the both of them very much especially mr ng , haiz ... he has given mi alot of opportunity in music , and its nt comfortable to see other pple conducting the siling sec sch co ..... lor .. .cauase for decades it was mr ng ...  althought if they really leave siling , i will still see them every sat , but i think i really appreciate the things they have done for the sch, i think that the both of them spent alot of their effort on this sch . i really hope to tell them that 'they are the best' .......
