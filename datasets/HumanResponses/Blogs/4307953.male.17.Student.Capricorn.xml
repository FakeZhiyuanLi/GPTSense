      By: Ivan Joshua V. Estrada              Tempora mutanter et nos mutamur in illis. In English, times change as we change with them.  Yeah, I’m fond of saying quotations in Latin. That’s my identity during MADICSA and BULPRISA Extemporaneous Speech. And this is but one of the things I’ll miss in high school. Through my four years of stay at my alma mater, there are many things that have changed. And only one out of these four years have I been able to rediscover myself in the company of precious individuals, my friends! And to all of my friends, this article is for you guys. Peace out!              Having been tasked to make an article about seniors’ memories on a one leaf space in the Icon’s Yearbook 2004 is worth a difficult job. The more I’m moving forward after the heartaches of bidding goodbye during the retreat and graduation, the less the wound heals because destiny would always remind me of them. Tunay nga sigurong mahirap kalimutan ang isang alaalang nakapagpabago sa iyong buhay. Nevertheless, at the end of every passing day, we should continue moving on to reach our goals.              Absolutely, there are many memories our batch, BATCH 2004, had left to our brother Icons. Memories of good and bad, but what is important is that all of these had helped us define the real sense of friendship. Through the memories we got, we learned that true friendship cannot be equaled to any form of happiness. The contentment of having true friends is worth than getting all the laurels. Anyway, the true measure of success is yet to come. We should just learn how to dream.              Negating on a person’s statement:“If you’re going to dream, dream high! Not just settle for being a dancer.”  Whatever it may be, for as long as you work hard for it, it is worthy. You may be the greatest writer, the most famous lawyer, or the best doctor, but if you don’t have friends it is identical to losing your life.              Kindhearted we become when we find true friends and great individuals who will mold us and best, transform us. We tend to be generous with our friends and just go on with what we call peer pressure. Yet, self discipline dictates that an Icon is an image of Christ. We have learned it from the grounds of the institution and surely we will continue to live by it.              So together let us reminisce the memories of our batch, BATCH 2004 has given to the community for a year, let me share to you the most frequent things a Senior Icon should experience for him to be called a real Icon.(Surely, we will miss these things!)       1.      You are wearing the purely white santana polo bragging the patch ICSB-4. It’s obvious you’re on your senior year then, but most importantly aside from the polo, you live by the word Icon as an image of Christ.  2.      You are tired going up the fourth floor but can already feel the cool breeze coming from the air conditioned rooms.  3.      You can smell the addictive whiteboard markers and can hear the loud tapping of shoes in the wooden floor.  4.      You can feel your superior among the undergrads as if they were afraid of getting in contact with you.     5.      You frequently run for the 7 o’clock finish line in the gate because of sleeping late due to YM and Friendster.  6.      You have tasted the sisig, PROMO, ham and egg and bacon and luncheon and burger plus the “anong dressing mo, Kuya?”  7.      You have been in the washroom every after a class ends just to loiter and feel the necessity of going out.  8.      You have been used to cramming. Doing assignments before the morning prayer or during breaks.  9.      You have more Maths! Trigonometry, Calculus, Physics, and Economics.  10.  You have been under the Balite Trees eating and chatting. Then running after the teacher in the corridor.  11.  You have been in the courtyard playing basketball the more.  12.  You have been used to the karatig jeepneys surrounding you as soon as you go out the gate.  13.  You have to choose between Manong Jim’s sorbetes or Milko’s creamstick.  14.  You have been attending the Wednesday Mass to see girls wearing brown.  15.   You collect brochures from different universities choosing where to enter college.  16.  You start reviewing for the UPCAT and other university entrance tests.  17.  You have been the most enthusiastic people during Friends Day.  18.  You are the champs during Bulletin Board Making Contests, Field Demos, and Community Day.  19.  You are to build a bridge made of stick and a jar made of broken tiles.  20.  You are to find for a Prom date during the Christmas Break as well as practice for those who are included in the cotillion de honour.  21.  You will have your best night ever during your prom where you become a knight of shining armor.  22.   You have been at the courtyard one afternoon holding a rifle with the Aguinaldo look.  23.  You have to finish the piles of project before going to Baguio.  24.  You have to go to Baguio and recall all the memories of high school during the retreat.  25.  You have to be good and show nothing foul, for you to have a loyalty award.  26.  You have been constantly singing the school hymn thinking it was the last.  27.  You have been practicing the graduation rites the whole day.  28.  You will pass papers and autographs to batch mates and write simple messages.  29.  You have been touched and maybe cried during the graduation rites at the 25th of March.  30.  And last but not the least; you will learn how to value real friendship and brotherhood.              Once again, my deepest thanks to all my friends who continue lighting my path of reaching my goals. To my senior colleagues Armand, Don, Janno, Moi, Nie, Dro, Jovy, Regi, Paeng, Wilson, Jojo, Bill, Tadeo, and Ross, thank you for tapping my shoulders! To my junior friends Paulo, Charles, Ryan, Jr, and Jenno, thank you for sharing with me your rhythmic moves! To my sophomore and freshman comrade, thank you for your childlike attitudes. Forever you will stay in my heart!!! Maraming Salamat!
