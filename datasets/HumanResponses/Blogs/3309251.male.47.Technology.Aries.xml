      This might come in handy if you're out taking a swim in the outback or wandering the bogs around the Kennedy Space Center...  If you are on land, try to get on the alligator's back and put downward pressure on its neck. This will force its head and jaws down.  Cover the alligator's eyes. This will usually (but not always) make it more sedate.  If you are attacked, go for the eyes and nose. Use any weapon at your disposal or use your fists.  If the jaws are closed on something you want to remove (a limb, for example), tap or punch the alligator on the snout. Alligators often open their mouths when tapped lightly and may drop whatever they have taken hold of and back off.  If the alligator gets you in its jaws, you must prevent it from shaking you or from rolling over. These instinctual actions cause severe tissue damage. Try to keep the mouth clamped shut to prevent the alligator from shaking.  Seek medical attention immediately even for a small cut or bruise to treat infection. Alligators have a huge number of pathogens (stuff like bacteria and viruses) in their mouths.   Of course the best advice is to not swim or wade in areas where alligators are known to inhabit and never feed, harass, touch, poke nor capture one of those pesky creatures....if you know what's good for you.

      It all started a few years ago on a warm day in May. There had been rumours of cars disappearances from the Sunday morning soccer gang.  Dave had mentioned that his neighbour's 1982 Rabbit vanished over night but the peculiar thing was, the tires were left behind.  Big Mike mentioned that he had heard of a 1992 volks disappear from the IGA parking lot the other week, with the same MO. The car was gone but the tires were left behind. Bizarre.  Having a 1999 Volks myself, I was developing a healthy interest in these mysterious car thefts.  Why would someone want to steal a car and not take the tires?   I would find out the truth, sooner than later.

      I was walking back to my "office" (a small cubicle on the 15th floor) after a leisurely walk along St. Catherine's street...when suddenly, I spied one of those pesky multi-legged green creature scurrying from under my desk.  Those damn aliens.  They're everywhere!  Just when you think you got ride of them, one of them shows up.    Now I can hear it...soon people around the office are going to start complaining that things are disappearing.  Things are being misplaced. Things have been chewed or biten. Erasers, lead pencils, pens, paper clips, lunch pails and tucked away snack foods have vanished without a trace.  Well I know what's happening...the root cause of all of this distress.  It's those damn aliens!  They ate my volks too!
