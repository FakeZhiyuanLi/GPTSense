      Well, yesterday was culmination and today was the last day of school.  We had a bonding session during something called "Magic Circle."  I went around tyo each student and said something nice about them.  WE cried and cried.  Most of the boys cried.  It was so sad.  A lot of these kids will never see each other again.  I told them that they were my first class and I will never forget them.  THat when they come back to visit when they are graduating from high school and getting ready for college, although i may not remember their names, I will always remember their faces.  I got a couple of cards from some students and they were really sweet incredible words that you would never know these kids could come up with.  Very loving, honest words.  I will cherish these words forever.  On to the new year!  SChool starts in a couple of weeks and as I was driving home today, I was sad for my old kids, but excited at the prospect of a new class; a new beginning, more experiences.  Its kinda cool because I know who most of them are going to be.  So, it's going to be great.  I'm gona try a "Hogwarts" Houses team thing. I'll have them in the sorting hat thing, and they will be sorted into their house for the year.  Of course, they will work with other houses, but they will do core things with their team.  So I'm excited.  So tired...ta ta for now...

      So yeah, already three days overdue for another post.  Well, this weekend started off pretty well, I saw "The Terminal" with Sean, and I thought it was a great film.  Very creative.  THen it all went downhill from there... I had a WHOLE WEEK OFF next week between school years and a certain friend of mine is being a stinky and not wanting to go away for even one night.  Let's just say when depression hits ya, it can hit hard.  THen saturday night we almost didn't got out...I was just in a bad mood.   So I have decided to "X" out this weekend and go on...today was a crazy day at school.  Softball game was supposed to happen but we weren't allowed to watch for some lame reason...the kids are acting like, "let me outta here!"  And I'm ready for a mini-break between years.  I have stayed the latest I have stayed this year at school, (6:00) and I got a hell of a lot done.  I am beginning to get sad that my first class is leaving me.  I mean I have learned so much this year, it's unbelievable.  I had a wise teacher tell me that she cried everyday her first year of teaching.  I only cried less than a week, I would think.  So I guess I'm pretty lucky.  There's a teacher at school who had my class last year, and although he told me that they were horrible, he acts as if they are the best class ever, and seems to try to taker over my class and make it his own.  HE-LLOOO!!!  You are DONE with them!  Let go, man.  anyways, hopefully he is leaving next year because he was just always sooooo negative towards the kids and threatening constantly, and never following through with the threat.  Which is one major thing I learned this year:  If you say something to those kids like you mean it, follow through with what you have said, otherwise they won't believe you and will stomp all over you.  Whew!  Nuff said for today...

      Well, I thought I was going to post here nearly everyday...but as you can see that might not be working out so well...  i just saw my old best friend, Dara, that I haven't seen in a little over a year for circumstances I would rather forget.  I really hope we can become great friends again.  I can see us "getting old" together: through weddings and kids and old people stuff too.  I really should tell her that, don't I?  We had this huge conversation and although I really wanted to push her out of my life, seeing her made me realize what a good friend I had lost.  Like a soulmate, I told her.  We cried of course and I don't know.  I guess I realy did miss her.  Anyway, she looks absolutely amazing and I give her so much credit for what she did.  So, as an inspiration to me, I will begin my long and difficult journey into losing weight.  Now, it's only about 30 or so pounds i want to lose, and I have lost nearly 30 already.  So I guess that puts me about half-way there.  Its just difficult, being around kids with snacks all day.  Yes, I'm a 5th grade teacher and I adore every minute of it.    The year is nearly over with a week left to go. Jeez...I can't believe it's been a year since I first started teaching.  I can clearly remember arguing with my parents, specifically with my mom...about being a teacher.  She always had this way of adding in that I should think about it, how great I am with kids, etc., etc.  Well...I did it...and now its the end of the first year.  I already told my kids I will cry on the last day of school and even possibly their culmination.  Ha Ha!    So, I guess that's it for today.  I will hopefully keep you updated on my journey. Ta Ta for now...

      Well, almost.&nbsp; Jeez I haven't written in a LONG time.&nbsp; sorry, guys.&nbsp; I was at Open Court Training this week, and well, I have just been lazy.&nbsp; Let's see how the year is going so far.&nbsp; One kid has gotten suspended twice ALREADY&nbsp; (it's now the 4th week of school)&nbsp; Once because of defiance and the second time I heard he pants another student.&nbsp; I wasn't there that day.&nbsp; It happened this week.&nbsp; My kids are doing horribly in math, and I think the biggest reason is because I haven't been there teaching them myself. They are not putting their personal numbers on their papers and boy will they get it tomorrow when I start handing out graded tests only to those who have their personal number on them.&nbsp; I'll be throwing the others in the trash as I hand them out.&nbsp; terrible I know but I think it's the only way they might get it.&nbsp; I need to start them all over with writing.&nbsp; I think we are going to do it together.&nbsp; they will choose the topic as a class, and we will write it together.&nbsp; I think its the only way I can do it. They have horrible writing skills and I hope to improve that this year.&nbsp; also their spelling is horrendous and I can't think of a way to get them to spell correctly.&nbsp;   enough complaining.&nbsp;   I have back to school night on Tuesday, and I'm not really looking forward to it.&nbsp; there's so much to discuss and not enough time.&nbsp; unfortunately, these parents don't always "get it" in the parenting sense.&nbsp;   this weekend was pretty good.&nbsp; I'm just so tired.&nbsp; I wish I got to spend more time with Sean. He seems to just wants to hang around all day.&nbsp; oh well.&nbsp;   I should really get to bed.&nbsp; I gotta get up early tomorrow for work.&nbsp;

      Well...The new year has begun, and I feel as though my brain is being pulled in all different directions.  My classroom is still not up to par with my personal standards...Although its the crappiest classroom...The kids are pretty good.  My main thought the first day of school this past Tuesday, "Will I ever get them to be as great as my kids last year?"  Well, one of my answers is no, first they will NEVER compare to my first class.  I told Sean that I think I'll be comparing every class to my first class.  I saw one of my old students Tuesday and I nearly started to cry.  I wasn't nervous at all to start the new year...Maybe in my own mind I thought it was all a dream and that I was able to keep my first class forever.  Oh well...One must grow from what they learned and move on to the next task at hand.    I have a student who I realized with my own eyes and ears is a little thief.  And a liar.  Arghhh...I WILL put a stop to it this year.  I will not have it in my classroom.    So I am about to leave to go to Best Buy....I think I might be getting myself into a bad hobby: scrapbooking.  YIKES!  They have a whole new section where they help you and stuff...We'll see.    Last night Sean said something about how he thinks we are just used to each other.  I was thinking about it and hmmm..Maybe that's true.  Although he has things that can annoy me, those things don't bother me the way they used to. I'm sure I still have my idiosyncrasies that piss the hell outta him but I'm trying.  Anyways...I'm off...

      IT's such a shame to waste my short short vacation time before the new schol year starts again by watching The Ashlee Simpson Show..god, what a poser she is.  Everytime they show her recoring tracks, all it is is her fuckin up all the time...hm...maybe she doesnt have the cords her sister was blessed with.  Anyways...  Yesterday was a fun but long day.  Jenny, Sondra and I went to Newport Beach...one of my favoritest places in the world  :)  Its just so relaxing there...too bad it was obnly for a day.  I wish I could have slept there.  Oh well...another time hopefully.    So I don't have much to say.  Today was an okay day.  Sean went home to visit for the weekend.  Miss him.  I broke down and bought a needlepoint that I'm making for my mom.  Its kinda cool.  Its relaxing in a weird way, to just chill in front of the tv and do it.  :::Yawn:::  Whew I'm tired.  Been up since 7:30 am.  I'm thinkin about hittin the sack.  Yeah bed is goooodddd....  good night, NEVERLAND!!!!

      Well, hello everyone. I have been pretty busy lately with school and everything. I feel like it's two steps forward and one step back everyday with my class. Their behavior is sllloowwwwwlllyyyyy changing. There are a few students who I want out of my class...But oh well. So, today, I was going into the restroom right after the lunch bell rang, and lately, the students seem to think it's okay to run to the bathroom or the drinking fountain AFTER the bell, when they had 45 minutes anyways. :::rolling eyes::: So I said to one of them, *Johnny, who is on my shit list, go line up, you had 45 minutes to get water. So I went into the bathroom. After I came out, I saw Gio, our literacy coach, yelling at him. I come to fine out that after I turned my back, he runs into the bathroom! I was livid. So defiant....So ARRGGHHHHHH...So I reamed his ass for doing that and defying my authority. He just pisses me off.  Anyways. God, I was just thinking how WEIRD it is without my brother around. I miss him, and I hope to see him soon. Duh, I'll see him in like a month, for my cousin's bar mitzvah in D.C.  gonna chill with Sean and watch TV.
