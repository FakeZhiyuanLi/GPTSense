      Got home from work at about 12:41 am. I went onto MSN and found out that no one was on. So i read the various emails that i received and one was from kalin. read it. it was about blogger so i decided to make my own to discuss how i feel on a digital means. i made my own blog, using feelings that i felt at the time, which i usually do in most circumstances, then i sat down and was unsure about what to type for my first blog. why not work? so i decided work. i work at subway, which can be one of the most demeaning and disgusting jobs. health food i dont think so. did you know the guy who created the atkins diet died of a heart attack. something to remember when your being fed all this informational mumble jumble that doesnt necessarily have to be true, just has to follow the rules. i realized that me being at work kept me away from the people i love most, my friends. its hard when your pretty much the only one in your group who works regular midnight shifts, maybe twice or three times a week. i miss my friends greatly, and i dont show it that much. its not like they need to be burdened with what i feel. work is letting me live out my dreams i say. whatever. the only reason i wanted this jobwas to get a car, and now that im 16 and a half, i havent even came close to picking one out. anyways. i worked with tristan today, who is an older brother of a good friend of mine who i dont see much of, but really enjoy his company, and his name is darnell. ive also became really good friends with tristan and look forward to working with him becuase i can just act stupid and he enjoys it. speaking of work, naw...i dont know what i was talking about. i read other peoples blogs and i wonder what they are talking about, like, is that what really goes through their heads? even with my friends, they blogs are so deep and i can see into their minds and how they feel just by reading it and realize how hectic a mind can be, and how much we are so alike, yet so different. i miss my friends so much. this weekend is going to be tough. too much studying and working and working and studying and not enough of seeing my friends. im sorry guys, i really am. well, before i bawl like a little girl i mid as well change back to work again. i made 6 dollers intips today, but since i felt bad becuase i pretty much just had to serve customers while tristan and tracy did other work, i thirded it or whatever. well...i kept 4...but the first three doller tip was mine, but the second one really wasnt, so i split it. it felt good to see the smiles on their faces. ok this blog is too long i beleive and i do believe its time to get going. so later to all who reads and to all that dont, have a good one.

      Hey! It looks like i will be going to get my bikers learners license. Ive thought about for awhile, but held out for my mom. She was in a bad accident as a teen and doesnt want me to do the same. But me and my oldest brother have gotten through her and she has reluctantly decided that we can. Considering i know mainly nothing about bikes, i may have my learners for awhile. Which is cool. Thats all i really wanted to anyways. Im excited. All i have to do is go down to SGI and pay my 10 bucks, do the same exam i took pretty much for my car learners, then do that eye test thing, and i get my lessen. Now all i need is someone to teach me. ill go search someone out. But in the mean time everyone be excited for me. I am limited to something 450cc and less, but if i find one for 500 or 600 i think it will pass bye my parents radar. im excited. Anyways im alone again because of my curfew and plan on just hanging out with my coke out, you heard me, my coke.so you guys have a good one. later.
