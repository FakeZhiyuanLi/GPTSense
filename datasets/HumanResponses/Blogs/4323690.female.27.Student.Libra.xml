      Well, I'm in a crappy mood today, so anything I say will be negative. Anything I do won't be nice. Well, ok, perhaps in my own mind I feel that way but then again everything is in my own mind. Lets see. . . . today. Yeah, today I finally upgraded my Mac to Panther and I just got Office 2004 for Mac so I can use Panther for SOMETHING! It's a nice feeling. But I shouldn't be spending money right now. I owe money to some bills and spending it isn't a good thing, but thank goodness for my credit card! :D I am getting a feel for blogger. So, if you're bored and reading this then feel free to reply back. I might be in a better mood then. It don't take much anyway for me.  Well, I'm doing my best. I'm going to go and pray for better things. Pray for a better job. Pray for the ringing in my ears to stop! If it happens, i'll tell you. Um, pray that god grant me money to pay my bills. I have rent coming up and I don't have it. Somethings I like to use my credit card for, but that is not one of them, you know? Oh, why did I do the you know thing. It's tacky. Well, I need to be doing my business plan for school. Yes, I go to school and hopefully I'll get a job. I sometimes hear not nice stories like the ones who can't find a job and work at a grocery store instead of their field that they study in. Sad, I know. I think I came to a point in my life where God is telling me to pray or something. I know lots about spirituality and read alot but actually do it is another story. I don't have much time to do the meditation and why should I with that constant ringing and the fact I still can't sit still because I'm constantly doing something now because of school and work and school and work and school and work and you get the point. Somewheres I do sleep. So, I guess I can take a minute to pray. I sometimes thank my food but not all the time. I guess I pray in a way with all of my thinking. But they say to be positive. Don't use don't. Don't use No. Don't use negative  words and sometimes that's what comes out and when I'm feeling crapy, why should I use positive words. I sometimes see things happen with the power of thought. And then I end up not being able to complain but I really want to and know I can't and then I get all pissed of but then I can't because you can't be pissed off at your thought but to do the forgiving thing. Forgive yourself and move on. But I really hate it when all that is coming out is negative and so I just go through the motions and yeah, I need to do that praying thing cuz I can't do it on my own. . . right now, right? Perhaps in the future I can, but now it's hard and I need to use prayer to assisst me. -I think they need speel check here- Well, now I have a blog. And now you read a real thought from me. I wish you all well, and may you find piece of mind. Peace be with you and much love.
