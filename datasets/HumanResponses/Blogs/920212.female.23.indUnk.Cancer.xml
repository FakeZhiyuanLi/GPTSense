      getting sick on the eve of one's vacation is bullshit. i succumbed to all the hype and bought some emergen-c. i'm already in the midst of the cold, but maybe it might help. i'm probably kidding myself, though. i just hope i don't spend all 4 days feeling like shit with snot running out of me every second.  i've always hated my nose, but now that it has started it's own snot factory (whose slogan is apparently "all snot, all the time"), i like it a whole lot less.  thankfully, the baseball bat down my throat has been removed, and i'm not too ache-y. i guess i can live with having tissue burn in my nostrils. it's like getting rug burn, but without all the fun bits.  sniff sniff.

      imagine you're out with a bunch of people. friends, people you see every once in awhile, co-workers,etc. you piss your pants for some unknown reason. just humor me, here. streaks down the legs, no way to hide it. everyone is aware that you have pissed yourself.  every time you see one of these people, you will remember this night. the only thing you can think about when you come into contact with one of these people is the damp river of urine trickling down your thighs. you will think about how they are probably thinking about it. you will not be able to hold an adequate conversation with this person because of the lingering embarrassment of that night. you will forever be known as the person who peed their pants that one night at that one place. and even if these people don't necessarily care about what happened, you do.   this is how i feel when i talk to you. this is how i feel every time i think about you and what went on between us.  there's just no way around it.   and i fucking hate that.

      violet beauregarde from willy wonka and the chocolate factory, dressed as red from fraggle rock, in a fucked up version of mr. roger's neighborhood spliced with sesame street. isaac mizrahi as a candy inventor trying to get his fruit stripes gum sold by smiley, the town's candy store owner. john ritter in an ancient ford running from nazis, carrying a head in a mesh cylinder.   my dreams are fucked up.

      "Strangers fascinate me. I like the fantasy of molding them into your vision. Real people are so disappointing."   i just read this in someone else's blog. i think it's pretty profound and sad. you can never live up to someone else's fantasy of you..

      yesterday i was in line at the grocery store. there was an older man in front of me, he looked to be about 50 or 60. he set a big bottle of whiskey on the conveyor belt. nothing else. i recognized my father in the deep bags under his eyes and the slack mouth beneath them. luckily for me, my father does not resemble this sad old man any longer.  i had to wonder what this man's life must be like. it's hard for people to understand what drives a person to become so dependant on something that is so destructive, but after living with an alcoholic for part of my life, i can see the lure of self-medication.  still.. as we get older, you hope that you can assess the bad habits you form and eradicate them from your life after seeing adverse affects. but at a certain point, after the line is blurred and a person stops caring, numbing oneself is the only goal.  i see a lot of men like this one. it seems everywhere i go, there is some lost, lonely person just trying to get through their day without losing it. it breaks my heart to know there are people out there with so little to live for, and so little to lose.  my father was an alcoholic for many years. i hated him for half my childhood. now that he's recovered, i can put away a lot of that anger and resentment and see his journey and what it took for him to get to where he is.  there is so much pain in this world. it's such a tired old cliche, but there it is. you can't fix everyone, even if you tried. the futility of that is humbling.

      because it's the 'what-ifs' that will kill you in the end. and i don't want to be haunted - just gently carressed by the bittersweetness of memories that almost were.    and 3 years after this was written, i've learned that some things are just better left undone..

      the street was a blocked intestine. metal congealed with angry red faces; loud beeps punctuated by middle fingers and squinted eyes. we moved on the sidewalk, together.. but not. i was further from him than he could have ever realized. our eyes never quite met when we spoke. if stilted syllables and single words could really be considered speaking. it seemed i couldn’t force myself to put in the effort it would take to create a sentence. he wasn’t worth the mechanics of lips and tongue and breath working to create sound. i didn’t know what i was doing there, or why i was with him. i wanted to crawl into one of the hot, vibrating cars inching alongside me and pretend the week was over. or that it had never happened. one or the other.   i felt his fingers brush mine and i pretended to scratch my arm. “don’t fucking touch me.” i didn’t say it, i didn’t have the balls to. i repeated it over and over in my head, and i felt stronger. letting him hold my hand would mean that i was giving in. maybe it wasn’t fair to him, but there was no fucking way i was going to let this progress into something he could assign some deeper meaning to.  we found my car parked along the road and i unlocked the passenger door for him. as he climbed in, i made my way to the driver's side, steeling myself. yeah, it’ll be alright. one more day. i slid the key into the ignition and turned the radio on. one more day. together.. but not.  thank fucking god.
