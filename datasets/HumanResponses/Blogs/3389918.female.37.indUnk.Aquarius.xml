      I had this conversation with a man the other evening... more of an argument, I suppose, or at least a debate... I thought it was interesting... HIM (4:35:45 PM): like i said...you can live in your dream and not care about amterial things until you need that money....and then say....someone will pay it ...or take care of it HIM (4:36:50 PM): I pay for the hiways you drive on...I pay for the military that protects you...i pay for everything our govt provides you....and you pay for none of it.......so much for you paying for everything you need ME (4:37:22 PM): I pay taxes.... I have never been on welfare..... no one has ever given me handouts..... HIM (4:37:36 PM): you do not pay federal income tax HIM (4:37:51 PM): as a matter of fact...you get a child tax credit....that I pay for ME (4:37:51 PM): I didn't write that law... I can't help it HIM (4:38:07 PM): guess you do take a handout then ME (4:38:09 PM): and you are putting yourself in a big box labeled "SNOB" HIM (4:38:39 PM): no..i am putting myself in the box of people who don't think they should have to pay for everything you enjoy HIM (4:38:49 PM): I pay my part and yours ME (4:38:56 PM): I work my ass off 40-50 hours a week..... HIM (4:39:03 PM): so do I HIM (4:39:27 PM): I just pay my fair share and you do noT ME (4:39:34 PM): so, next year should I send you my taxes? would that knock the chip off your shoulder? HIM (4:39:39 PM): actually...i pay for more than my fair share ME (4:39:52 PM): so quit working so hard.... you wouldn't pay so much in taxes ME (4:39:59 PM): you pay for the lifestyle you want to lead HIM (4:40:23 PM): if everyone had that attitude we would have no roads...no schools....no military...and no freedom to choose  ME (4:40:41 PM): so you want that stuff as long as you don't have to pay for it HIM (4:41:04 PM): I DO PAY FOR IT....but I also pay for other people who don't pay for it ME (4:41:20 PM): I work hard... I pay what the government says I have to pay.... I can't helop their laws HIM (4:41:25 PM): you are the one who wants it...but does not pay for it ME (4:41:39 PM): if everyone had jobs like yours, your trash wouldn't get picked up every week..... your stores wouldn't have anything in them because there would be no truck drivers to haul it there would be no waitress to take your order then next time you eat in a restaurant HIM have news for you....trash haulers make 40k a year and belong to unions ME (4:42:45 PM): my ex husband is a trash hauler for the city.... he makes $10 an hour, with no union HIM(4:43:09 PM): that is because he choose to live in a little town and haul trash ME (4:43:27 PM): you can live the life you choose, but no one else can ME (4:43:28 PM): interestinG ME (4:43:56 PM): and if there were no farmers, which my whole family is, what would be on your dinner table tonight? HIM (4:44:26 PM): I believe it is my duty as an american to PAY MY FAIR SHARE....I don't care what the govt says...then I also donate money to charities.....my father owns a cattle ranch in Protection Ks ME (4:44:40 PM): people in little towns need their trash hauled too, you know HIM (4:44:46 PM): almost lost his whole biz 2 years ago because of the poor beef market ME (4:45:01 PM): well... thats because he chooses to be a rancher ME (4:45:11 PM): if he lived in a city and had a desk job that wouldn't happen to him ME (4:45:16 PM): your logic, not mine HIM (4:45:17 PM): true....and there will always be someone willing to take that job and not pay thier fair share HIM (4:45:39 PM): I can haul my own trash ME (4:45:46 PM): we pay what we are told to pay.... go be a politician and change the laws if you don't like it ME (4:46:59 PM): and you are going to grow a garden and raise cattle in your back yard, right?? HIM (4:47:00 PM): that is the problem....exactly what our founding fathers warned us about....50% of the population pays little or no fed taxes..........and they vote in congressman that pander to them...so the people who have good jobs keep having to pay more and more and more ME (4:47:17 PM): so run for office and change it! ME (4:48:25 PM):how do you want me to fix it? tell me what I can do.... ME (4:48:39 PM): stop voting? I can do that.... HIM (4:49:09 PM): next time they want to raise taxes to pay for schools tell them no.....ask them what more money is going to do...how is it going to raise test scores HIM (4:49:35 PM): ask them why teachers are tenured and have no job performance reviews HIM (4:50:53 PM): ask why teachers are bitching.....they work 1/2 the days in the year and get paid full time wages HIM (4:51:39 PM):ask why a woman on welfare can have another kid and get more money from the govt HIM (4:52:25 PM): why people in prison get tv libraries....and everything they want ME (4:53:09 PM): the starting point is to stop raising taxes, and start cutting out things that are not neccesary ME (4:53:25 PM): raising taxes is treating the symptom, and not the disease HIM (4:53:30 PM): why someone who has a million dollars in the bank when they die gets 55% of it taken by the govt....this is money they already paid taxes on ME (4:54:32 PM): so why bother making that money and putting it in the bank if the government is going to take it anyway? (this is not a personal attack this is just a hypothetical question for the sake of the debate) HIM (4:54:42 PM): if we are all supposed to be equal...why is my tax rate twice of yours ME (4:54:56 PM): I don't know... and I don't think its fair either ME (4:55:05 PM): its the government HIM (4:55:06 PM): in our govt...I am actually punished for being more productive ME (4:55:10 PM): not the little people ME (4:55:18 PM): yes, you are ME (4:55:38 PM): you are not making a good point here for me wanting to be more productive~~~ and it went on... Id like to hear other opinions on this...

      My dad died tonight. 7:03 pm. He wasn't my birth dad, but he adopted me when he married my mom, I was 1 1/2. They divorced when I was about 14 or so, but he was always a part of my life. He had cancer. I hadn't seen him in a year. We weren't getting along... every time I went there, he found a way to insult me, I always left there feeling bad... so I stopped going. My step mom had called, today, said he was real bad. My sister and I were going up tomorrow to see him...  I wanted to put things right between us...  I wanted to tell him that I still loved him... My friends say that of course he knew that... but I don't know that... I didn't get to look into his eyes and tell him that...  Please, if anyone ever reads this, no matter what time of day or night it is, if your parents are still living, call them NOW and tell them you love them... before its too late.

      Have you ever read "The picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde? It is an interesting book... here is an interesting bit I just came across, reading today... (I'm rereading the book, haven't read it in years)  ~~"Only when one is young," she answered. "When an old woman like myself blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me how to become young again." He thought for a moment. "Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?" he asked, looking at her across the table. "A great many, I fear," she cried. "Then commit them over again," he said gravely. "To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies." "A delightful theory!" she exclaimed. "I must put it into practice." "A dangerous theory!" came from Sir Thomas's tight lips. Lady Agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened. "Yes," he continued, "that is one of the great secrets of life. Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes." A laugh ran round the table.~~  The only thing one regrets is one's mistakes... Interesting theory. I'm not sure that I agree with that... Maybe, to some degree... But the OTHER theory... To get back one's youth one had merely to repeat one's follies... That is very true... So many people tell me that I look and act so much younger than I am, but the acting young is what promotes the looking young... Other people my age think that now that they are a "certain age" they have to act a "certain way"... That is what makes people old... old is an attitude, not an age... I can think of lots of "follies" from my youth I would love to repeat... and do so on every available occasion....lol

      Lacuna Coil. I suppose I am the last person to hear this group, but I just did so recently. They blew me away. My tastes in music vary widely. Classic rock, alternative rock, techno, country, jazz, R&B, hip-hop, new age, classical... just about anything but polka...(appologies to the polka fans out there.) This is my current "obsession". Living out in the boonies in southwestern Kansas has its advantages, but available radio stataions and nearby music stores are not among them. So, I listen to Lacuna Coil online, until I can get somewhere that actually sells their music.  Check out their website at:   urlLink http://www.lacunacoil.it/etc/html/eng/index.htm

      One of the best Gothic poetry sites on the web, in my opinion, is this one:  urlLink http://www.ravensrants.com/index.html   Raven's poetry is brilliant, breaking the gothic poetry stereotype...everyone thinks gothic poetry = poems about death.  Crystal Night  I walked out one crystal night and the air was cold and black every star held bright and true against it's midnight back The moon hung low above the trees as silent as a ghost and I sat there in the fields as frigid as a post This night was so gorgeous just like a movie scene and even the trees kept still to keep my view pristine My mind began to wonder through thoughts about this place It wished to share with someone nature's purest face But around me there was not a soul not a heart to make a sound and I knew I was all alone when I began to look around Then my heart felt empty like the space between the stars I knew the night alone couldn't heal all my scars So with that I began to walking back into the night i knew that I would need someone to help me win this fight So now I must leave this scene until some other time Because until I can share it it's just a song without a rhyme ~RAVEN~ If poetry interests you at all, you must check this site out... even if you are not goth, open your mind and experience something new...

      Ok. Maybe that last entry was typed with rose colored glasses on... he is a very great guy, but I never get to see him that much. haven't seen him in two weeks, or talked to him in over 1 week... I really think we could be perfect, except I need somone I can do things with... My sister (the "golden child") has a great man. She always has great guys...and always gets her way, and has a perfect house...blah, blah, blah.... not to mention she is 6'1", about 130 wringing wet, is very pretty and very classically feminine... she has it all, always has....ANYWAY... She and her boyfriend are constantly together, doing things with his kids, and working on his farm together... he is very respected, he is the undersheriff of our county. I seem to have a sign on my forehead that says "Losers Welcome", because that is the only group of men who ever ask me out... *sigh* Not that Steven is a loser, by all means, but he is so busy in his life, and set in his ways, he doesn't think about taking me with him to go do things, and I live 45 miles away, and most of the time he would have to pick me up because my ex-husband has my car...(long story) Anyway... life just kinda sucks, but seems I'd better get used to it, eh?

      It never ceases to amaze me how wonderful it is to go to Steven's farm ... out in the middle of nowhere, with a half mile long driveway... it is quiet, secluded... beautiful... not to mention that Steve is the most wonderful man on the planet... I am so glad we decided to stick it out and stay together, looks like we are going to be together for a long while... He told me, "I have finally decided to admit it...after three years, I admit that I love you, and I want more of you in my life." then he asked me what I thought about that... I said "It's about damn time..."  LOL... Patience Perserveres... the good girl wins out in the end...lol Life couldn't get much better than this...lol

      I have the night off... And I'm spending the day and probably the night at Steven's... I am so psyched... I hope that my patience has paid off.. He has come to a point in his life where he wants to settle down with one woman he can trust... And, he says, the only one he can trust is me... That he has always known that I was the one... Said I scared him a bit, because I understood him way more than any other woman ever has... He isn't the sort to get close to anyone, really.. But we are close, and that has bothered him in the past, but he has accepted it now... He knows I love him no matter what... We will see how it goes... I have thought this was happening in the past, only to go months without hearing from him... But maybe this is the time... I'm holding back judgment, though, I have been hurt too much before... We shall see... There are a couple of guys who have been sort of trying to get me to see them, but they are both attached... Both of them not traditionally married, but have live-in girlfriends... And I just won't go there... I talked to both of them last night, and they both made slightly jealous little comments...LOL... I am just not that sort of girl... Plus, Steven has always been the "high standard" in my heart... No one lives up to him....

      I have had an on-again off-again relationship with Steven for the last three years. He goes months without calling me, but every time he calls, I go back to him... It's hard to explain, but he is exactly what I want... And if living this way is the cost of being able to be with him occasionally, I suppose its worth it... He is EXTREMELY intelligent, 6'4", 240,piercing blue eyes, very intense, disciplined, confident...But he is also very kind, and caring... He makes me feel completely safe when I am with him... And even in the months in-between, I know that if anything happens to me, I can call on him and he will be there... If anyone ever hurt me, I know he would "take care of it"... He is a little scary, maybe, knowing what I know about the world he lives in, and some of the people he knows... But he is so strong, I have always felt like he was my "protector"...  Anyway, he has contacted me again... It is so wonderful seeing his messages, knowing he is still thinking about me, even if his life gets too complicated to call or email me at times... Maybe I will go to be with him soon, that would be wonderful...Someday, I hope to be with him all the time... But until then, I will take what I can get...

              Arwen   If I were a character in   The Lord of the Rings  , I would be Arwen, Elf, the daughter of Elrond.  In the movie, I am played by  Liv Tyler .  Who would  you  be?   Zovakware Lord of the Rings Test      with  Perseus Web Survey Software         I would have rather been Eowyn... I think I have more in common with her... we both would rather ride into battle with the men than stay behind...we both end up  falling in love with a man already taken... she and I have lots more in common I think than Arwen and I... (Although having a man like Aragorn in love with me is worth this test saying I am Arwen...lol) I do have a man I am in love with... he is sort of like Aragorn, although he has a dark side that Aragorn doesn't have... maybe he's more like Boromir...who, by the way, is the one in that movie that really drove me crazy...lol

      Last night, my night off, I ended up working from midnight to 4:30 am because my best friend at work pulled a no-show, no-call... he showed up at 4, seems he and his girlfriend were fighting all day and he took off too mad to think about coming to work... hmmm... he'd better grow out of that, maybe take some anger management classes, and maybe get rid of the girlfriend if she's gonna be that much trouble...just because two people have a child together doesn't mean they were meant to be together forever... Anyway, I didn't have any sleep before I went in, and I was dead by the time I got home... got woke up by severe thunderstorms this  morning... hail as big as shooter marbles...now its just wet and gloomy... Will be going to sleep later, have to go in to work at midnight, (my own shift this time!) This gloomy day will make for good sleeping... Found some interesting movie trailers last night... look like pretty good movies... One of them is from M. Night Shyamalan, who has done some really great movies like "The Others", "Signs", and "Sixth Sense"... its called "The Village"... can't wait to see that one... urlLink http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2483648   the other is "Ju On: the Grudge", a Japanese horror film... it looks awesome too...  urlLink http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2639981  Can you tell I like horror movies?  lol... that  urlLink http://www.ifilm.com/ is a great website... another one I really like is:  urlLink http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/  I can't wait for my daughter to get here to watch her brother... its extremely dark in my bedroom, and its nice and cool,(maybe I lived in a cave in a former life????) and the thunder is still rumbling, and the rain falling lightly... what a great afternoon to sleep....

      This place is wearing on me like it did growing up here.  Everyone in this town works their ass off trying to be just like every one else.  Someone needs to tell them that the world does not end at the county line. We are citizens of the world, not just of Hick County.  Around here, music means classic rock or country. Period. (Nothing wrong with either... I listen to those too...) I listen to Gothic, punk,&nbsp;alternative, jazz, R&amp;B, soul, classical, techno, industrial, you name it... Anything but polka...LOL I have friends around the world, (online) and from all religions and races. If most of the people here knew I had friends that were Pagan, or wiccan, or heaven forbid Agnostic, I would probably be burned at the stake.  I get so tired of know-it-all people who never think outside the box... I love art, and poetry, and good literature... I crave intelligent conversation, on literature, philosophy, religion... I want to be able to buy really good clothes without driving 250 miles... (I HATE Wal-Mart!) I long for coffee shops, with real cappuchino, not the powdered kind that sputters out of a machine like bad hot cocoa... A book store with a good selection, a music store that actually has the music I want (Cooper Temple Clause is an unheard of group in this God-forsaken place!!) I want to get my nose pierced without losing my job. (Yes, I was told I can't work where I work with my nose pierced!)  My house is probably the only one for miles that is decorated in modern furniture and artwork... (95% of all homes here are done in "cutsey" country... )  All women are expected to be sweet little things, quiet, "respectful"... that isn't me either! I am tough, intelligent, and that scares most rednecks...  What am I still doing here??  I wanted my son to go to a small school. Not one with rampant drugs, and teen pregnancies, and security guards...  I suppose this is a small price to pay for my son, but I will be 49 years old when he is 18... Will I be too old to start my *real* life then????

      Why can't I just learn to say no!? Last night at work, a guy came in I hadn't seen in a while. We... Well, for lack of a better term, were "fuck buddies" when I was in high school. He was with another woman, but while she was busy at the counter, he came back and talked to me...Flirting, hinting at things that we had done "back then", and asked for my phone number and email... And I gave it to him!  I know for a fact that he is not interested in what I am looking for... I want a real relationship, I want someone that respects me, cares about me. He just wants someone to "play" with... I KNOW THAT, so WHY did I not just say no??!?  When I married my husband, I loved him. But I also had, in the back of my mind, the thought that no one else would ever ask me to marry him, so I'd better say yes. That recording seems to be still playing in my head, as if I should feel grateful to any man who shows the least bit of attention to me. I know that is what I am doing, yet when the man is standing there I don't think about it... I don't say no... I simply grab onto the attention like a woman overboard grabbing a flotation device.&nbsp; I get so mad at myself sometimes... I seem to be scared to say no...  &nbsp; I have been doing the same thing with another man, Stuart. All he is looking for is a good time... But I tell him, oh yeah, I'll call.... Instead of just telling him that we want different things, and a "roll in the hay" is not what I want...  Someday, somehow, this has got to change... But IM not sure how to get there...

      I have a habit of constantly heading down dead-end roads, that I KNOW are dead ends. Not real roads, but life's roads... I usually ONLY am attracted to older men. I have never really been attracted to younger men. BUT... I have a friend that is 10 years younger than me that I am VERY attracted to. Not a bad thing in and of itself, BUT he has a girlfriend. A pretty permanent one.  Why do I always fall for the ones I can't have? Girlfriends, wives... Every man I find myself being attracted to is already attached... Isn't there some psychological reasoning behind that??  Maybe it's just that what they say is true... All the good ones are taken... I don't know, but it drives me crazy... And HE drives me crazy... And it doesn't help that he is an incessant flirt, that just makes me feel worse... **NOTE TO GUYS: If you are otherwise attached, please don't be a tease! If you are not happy in your relationship, get out of it, THEN you can flirt... It's not fair otherwise...
