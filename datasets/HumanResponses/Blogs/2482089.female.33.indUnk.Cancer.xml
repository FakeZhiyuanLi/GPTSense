       urlLink Registrants  may not  [at need]  use free,   anonymous  [unaccountable] e-mail accounts  (such as those from Yahoo, Hotmail,  and others [as no-account])  when creating a new account.  [And, whatever you may think, or do or say] Only e-mail addresses from   paid   Internet service providers,  [private] companies,  [profiteering] educational institutions,  and similar  [proper] organizations   will be permitted to auto-register.   We apologize for any  [auto] inconvenience  this may cause.  [Oh, and]  We are also,  regrettably,  [secondarily] unable to accept   [you or]  e-mail addresses  [given to you] from some ISPs  based outside the United States,   if the hosts are unable  to determine  [your value] based on the service's homepage  [and] whether it is a paid or free service.   We appreciate your understanding.  Thank you, The Management  [my question, can they read French?]
