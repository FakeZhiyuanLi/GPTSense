      I made a typo in my previous post... I said I believe Sen Kerry lied under oath.  I meant to say I believe he did not lie under oath.  That does not excuse his actions then or later.  A thousand pardons.

      I found this to be enlightening and interesting.  I have read Kerry's testimony and while I believe he lied under oath to Congress he has certainly fled from the logic of his own statements.  Enough...it has  been a busy day here in the double A.    We seldom hear directly from Maj. Gen. Patrick Brady, MOH recipient.  Below is the guest op-ed he submitted to our newsletter which we now have posted.  Respectfully,  Roger & Pam Young Northwest Veterans Newsletter - Local News       Guest Op-Ed by Maj. Gen. Patrick Brady 16 Aug 04   America has no kings or queens but we do have nobility our nobility is called Veterans. That nobility is responsible for the bounty that is America but tragically their influence has faded in recent years and the values they died for are under attack. But this election year they are back in demand and some have said the veteran vote could decide this election. It may have put Bush in the White House. With this in mind, John Kerry is seldom seen with out his band of brothers and constantly plays the² hero² card as a cornerstone of his bid for president, indeed, as the definition of who he is. Kerry defines patriotism as ³keeping faith with those who wear the uniform of this country. He also brags that he ³defended this country as a young man². If Missouri is the show me state, Veterans are the show me voters  we are not much for words, deeds are our stock in trade. Lets look at Kerry¹s deeds.   Before Kerry played his "hero" card, he played the atrocity card. When Kerry came back from Vietnam he joined with Jane Fonda and in 1971 denounced "those who wear the uniform" as terrorists-like rapists and assassins who ³cut off heads, taped wires Ð to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, shot at civilians, razed villages, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks and said he "committed the same kinds of atrocities as thousands of others". He made these charges under oath. Kerry says today that he would have framed some of what he said in 1971 differently. But he does not say he lied, which he did, nor does he apologize. How can one properly frame the denunciations of ones comrades in arms as modern day Genghis Khans?   The very day that Kerry was calling Vietnam veterans¹ war criminals the family of one of those ³war criminals², Michael Blanchfield, was posthumously receiving the Medal of Honor for Michael who had thrown himself on a grenade to save the lives of his comrades. How different from Kerry was the way this man kept faith with those who wore the uniform with him. How different from Kerry was the manner Michael defended his country.   He could have attacked the war without attacking the warrior. He could have questioned policy without supporting the communists¹ claim that our soldiers were war criminals. He could have kept faith with those who wore the uniform with him. But he did not and he should be held accountable.   By every measure, the Vietnam veteran has been an exceptional citizen; but there is one disturbing statistic -- their suicide rate. In the first 5 years after discharge the rate was 1.7 times higher than non-veterans. After 5 years it was less. This may have been due to the treatment the Vietnam veteran received from the media ­ and the anti war movement led by Kerry -- in the early years after the war. Living with the scars of war is difficult, for some unbearable, but all veterans suffer. The Vietnam veteran suffered physically as much, perhaps more than any veteran of the past century, but no veteran has suffered the mental agony of that veteran.   What Kerry/Fonda and the media elite did to the Vietnam veteran and his family is deplorable. They opened a gash in his psyche and then rubbed salt in it. Not just the living but also those who died and their families who questioned if a loved one is a war criminal. And the POWs some who believed the Kerry/Fonda cartel extended the war, increased their torture and filled more body bags. Whether Kerry and Fonda have blood on their hands is debatable but there is no doubt they have salt on them.   Kerry¹s "hero" card is based on medals he received in Vietnam and is much celebrated, and unchallenged, by the mainstream media. I know many Medal of Honor recipients who have received less publicity for their medal than Kerry has for his. But medals don¹t make a hero. It is how one uses medals that make a hero. Every honest soldier knows that medals are a function of circumstance, even happenstance, but most of all the support of ones fellow warriors.   I was awarded the Medal of Honor; but my fellow soldiers who supported me in the actions and took the time to write it up earned it. I wear it for them, they own my medals. And every Medal of Honor recipient and hero I know believes as I do. Medals should be a sign of patriotism, a symbol of sacrifice, support and defense of a great nation. The highest form of patriotism is service to our youth; heroes also wear their medal for them to signal the importance of courage. Heroes do not use their medals for personal political gain. As I said they are not theirs to use.   Senator Kerry threw his medals away (or ribbons, they are symbolically the same), a political act very difficult for any veteran to understand. He must have been proud of them for he wore them even on his fatigues, in violation of all regulations. But they were not his. They belonged to those who he served. By that act he symbolically denounced his fellow veterans -- again. Does one keep faith with those who wear the uniform by throwing away their medals?   But perhaps most telling of his leadership qualities is his use of his Purple hearts to abandon his band of brothers, his command, on a technicality. Kerry may be the only person in history who took advantage of a Navy regulation that allowed him to leave his command after 4 months for 3 purple hearts none of which ever caused him to miss a day of duty. In my experience men fought to stay with their band of brothers, especially commanders. All the commanders I know would get out of a hospital bed to be with their men. Some one had to take his place; someone probably less experienced who would have to learn the ropes. That put his command more at risk than if he stayed. It is not hard to understand why those who stayed in combat for the full year are upset with Kerry.   And veterans today would be upset with Kerry¹s support of Flag Burning his non-support of weapons systems and his 12 votes against military pay raises. But his use of veterans and misuse of his medals should bring into serious question his loyalty, integrity and character all of which equal leadership. He is not fit for command.   Maj. Gen.

      I found this while reading the early bird this morning by Ben Stein.  We don't say thanks to these ladies enough.  I have been a rear detachment commander and been deployed.  Life deployed is hard, but we forget how hard it is for those we leave behind.  We are following our dreams, living our ideals, doing the job we have been training all of our live fir.  The ladies (and men) keep it together at home while we are out doing that.  I believe that the unit they are talking about is CB's but I cannot be certain.  It doesn't really matter though.     Wall Street Journal August 18, 2004  Pg. 10  Strength At Home  By Ben Stein  This is a letter I wrote to the newsletter of an Army unit called The Strykers, stationed in Iraq out of Ft. Lewis, Wash. The editor asked me what I would say to make the wives feel appreciated while their husbands are in Iraq. This is what I wrote to one soldier's wife.  Dear Karen,  I have a great life. I have a wife I adore, a son who is a lazy teenager but I adore him, too. We live in a house with two dogs and four cats. We live in peace. We can worship as we please. We can say what we want. We can walk the streets in safety. We can vote. We can work wherever we want and buy whatever we want. When we sleep, we sleep in peace. When we wake up, it is to the sounds of birds.  All of this, every bit of it, is thanks to your husband, his brave fellow soldiers, and to the wives who keep the home fires burning while the soldiers are away protecting my family and 140 million other families. They protect Republicans and Democrats, Christians, Jews, Muslims and atheists. They protect white, black, yellow, brown and everyone in between. They protect gays and straights, rich and poor.  And none of it could happen without the Army wives, Marine wives, Navy wives, Air Force wives -- or husbands -- who go to sleep tired and lonely, wake up tired and lonely, and go through the day with a smile on their faces. They feed the kids, put up with the teenagers' surliness, the bills that never stop piling up, the desperate hours when the plumbing breaks and there is no husband to fix it, and the even more desperate hours after the kids have gone to bed, the dishes have been done, the bills have been paid, and the wives realize that they will be sleeping alone -- again, for the 300th night in a row.  The wives keep up the fight even when they have to move every couple of years, even when their checks are late, even when they have to make a whole new set of friends every time they move.  And they keep up the fight to keep the family whole even when they feel a lump of dread every time they turn on the news, every time they switch on the computer, every time the phone rings and every time -- worst of all -- the doorbell rings. Every one of those events -- which might mean a baseball score or a weather forecast or a FedEx man to me and my wife -- might mean the news that the man they love, the man they have married for better or worse, for richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health, is now parted from them forever.  These women will never be on the cover of People. They will never be on the tabloid shows on TV about movie stars. But they are the power and the strength that keep America going. Without them, we are nothing at all. With them, we can do everything.  They are the glue that holds the nation together, stronger than politicians, stronger than talking heads, stronger than al Qaeda.  They deserve all the honor and love a nation can give. They have my prayers, and my wife's, every morning and every night.  Love, and I do mean Love, Ben.

      Busy, Busy, Busy Work, Work, Work  I feel like Mel Brooks playing the Governor in Blazing Saddles.  Real busy here yesterday and probably today.  Spent all day in mandatory classes educating me on things I already knew (to be fair some information was useful) and then had a long meeting in the same area going over maintenance and supply data for the real meeting today.  Finally got home at about 1930.  Another day just like it in store today.  Defending your country is not all cool training.  Boring maintaining, maintenance and death by powerpoint are part of your service as well.    Now I can't wait for PT today (Physical Training) because I know exactly what I will be doing and will not have to think.  It's becoming one of the favorites times of my day.  Another days of classes then a maintenance brief today.  I love taking fire for maintenance statistics.  Be well  All The Way!

      Normally don't like repeating stuff I get over the internet, but my father in law sent this to me and it seems right.  And, despite my Army face I did go to school with Marines so I can put out some of their good news too. If you read it all the way through you see a young Marines enthusiam but his willingness to accept the consequences of his decisions. That is as much we can ask of any who don our nation's uniform. As I have said before, if this war has taught me anything it is to trust in our young Soldiers and Marines for they can do all that we have asked them and trained them to do. They are wonderful with all their flaws and even because of them. I know now why Ernie Pyle loved these guys so much. It is our fault if we have not done all the we can for them:  From a young Marine  This is a poem being sent from a Marine to his Dad. THE MARINE We all came together, Both young and old. To fight for our freedom, To stand and be bold.  In the midst of all evil, We stand our ground, And we protect our country From all terror around.  Peace and not war, Is what some people say. But I'll give my life, So you can live the American way.  I give you the right To talk of your peace. To stand in your groups, and protest in our streets.  But still I fight on, I don't bitch, I don't whine. I'm just one of the people Who is doing your time.  I'm harder than nails, Stronger than any machine. I'm the immortal soldier, I'm a US MARINE!  So stand in my shoes, And leave from your home. Fight for the people who hate you, With the protests they've shown.  Fight for the stranger, Fight for the young. So they all may have, The greatest freedom you've won.  Fight for the sick, Fight for the poor. Fight for the cripple, Who lives next door.  But when your time comes, Do what I've done. For if you stand up for freedom, You'll stand when the fight's done.  By: Corporal Aaron M. Gilbert US Marine, USS SAIPAN, PERSIAN GULF, March 23, 2003  Since I am not a poet, I cannot critique.  But I like it.   Be well and Happy National Airborne Day!

      To all paratroopers past, present and future-- happy national airborne day!  If you're thankful about reading this post, and in English then thank a paratrooper around you.  Thank those we went out the door in World War II: Sicily, Salerno, Normandy, Holland, Corregidor, Nabzab, Tagatay Ridge and many more combat jumps where paratroopers paid with their blood to be first on the ground.  Thank those who have taken the paratroopers creed and followed in their footsteps since-- conventional airborne soldiers, rangers and special forces.  They continue to serve today with the same pride and esprit de corps they had back in 1942 when the 82nd Airborne Division was consituted in August here at Fort Bragg North Carolina.  Paratroopers are special to me.  My father served a a paratroop in World War II with the 11th Airborne Division in the Phillipines and after the war here in the 82nd.  He always said that he and the Army had different definitions of discipline, but he was always extremely proud of being a paratrooper.  Honor the guys who jump out into the propblast every day to defend those freedoms we hold dear.  We are celebrating this morning at Fortress Bragg by doing a Division run in the drizzling rain aftermath of Hurricane Charley.  We'll see how much fun that is, but with a day off afterwards that should be OK.  Be well all.

      OK, and thanks to 91 Ghost for validating that this thing actually works.  Looking at the world this morning over a hot cup of coffee... despite the devastation of a Hurricane in Florida the thing that seems to worry me most is the abject and nearly nonsensical polarization of the US during the last 10 years. The complete inability of two opposing groups to see any validity in each others viewpoint. That worries me, though I probably have added to it by injecting my own opinions at times.  Being a little of the history geek, I'm trying to look back and see when the US was polarized this badly. This look back keeps bringing me to the Civil War. That ended badly despite the right side winning. Plus it was divided along regional lines, quite unlike what we have going on here. But the similarities of the times frankly scares the piss out of me. McClellan running against Lincoln in 1864, North and South divided over several issues, the least of which was slavery initially. And bloody fighting and sharp debate. Brother fighting brother with horrible recriminations. In 1861-1865 I guess it had to happen, but it need not happen now.  Something has to happen to resolve the issue, and I just don't know how this one will resolve itself. If the US lets this division devolve into any kind of bloodshed, we will have lost, justly so, our right to be a world power. Might as well sign up to be a French colony at that point. But something must happen...I believe the strength of the US system is that there are a number of checks and balances that allow us to overcome these types of divisions without devolving into civil war. But if the current divisions continue I am worried about what may come.  Any one have any discourse on this?  And a disclaimer...I am a soldier so if my arguments, statements or meanderings take on a slightly military tone, forgive me. I will always attempt to be civil if you give me the same courtesy. I hold my opinions strongly as my own and am not shy about defending them. They are not the reflections of the U.S. government, Army or anyone else. Flay away at them with that in mind.  Be well and no matter what your opinions may be. Send your best thoughts, prayers, wishes and hopes to our guys serving at the sharp end of the spear. They deserve our best, even if we are at our worst.
