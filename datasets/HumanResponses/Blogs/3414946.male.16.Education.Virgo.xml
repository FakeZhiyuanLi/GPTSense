       Mood:  mm, sorta Hungry  Listening To:  Nothing,....:/  mmm wow, its been a while, Friday went well, English Lit test was ok, though extremely long, but I planned everything out and I hope for the best. I seem to have chosen the questions nobody else did :/  Met Jo after, we went to Marks and Sparks, then McDonalds, god some food etc then just hung out for a few hours doing litterally nothing at Figgs Marsh. I have this thing about people coming to my house, mainly because I'm sorta ashamed of it, and well only 2 people since I've started Secondary School have came round and thta was Jo when we were going out and Claire when we watched Shawshank redemption. Well at least Mum want to redecorate, though shes leaving our room to last..  mmm, Saturday was boring as I didnt do anything, would like to have met up with Jayson, but he had plans, so I just played games etc. Sorta developed a crush on him, but he'd rather stay friends, which is fair enough.  mmmm, I gotta get up off my ass more.  I dont really have much more to say, catcha later!

       Mood: Calm, Happy  Listening To: Laura - Scissor Sisters  Had a chat with Jo(Ursuline Variety) very nice girl, though people dislike her for being too kind, hmmm. Either way I'm not going to say anything bad because she helped put things into perspective. I need to branch out more, whilst relying on Aidan isnt too fruitful, although can be, and relying on Jo, whilst she can be excellent company, her sharing her time with Ben isnt leaving me too happy. Relying on any of the ventures for social activity is like speaking to a brick wall.  Lord knows WHERE I'll branch out to...  But I'll be wanting to get a job, probably in sutton as it's pretty damn close and I know my way around. I'll have to look around, maybe over the half term...mmm..  AH, English Lit test tomorrow, 2 hours 15 mins of unadultarated FUN FUN FUN[/sarcasm]  Bit of a short one today...maybe an update later, I'll leave you with a tip top from Jo,  " Just remember that you are the only one who can live your life and that you will only get out what you put in: put in good, the outcome is good "

       Mood:  Blank  Listening To:  Midnight Sonata-Beethoven  Wow, Im feeling sooooo blank tonight, however seeing as I havent updated for a good while, my apologies...mainly because of tests, I'll tell ya whats been happening. ICT was pretty long and tiring, alot of detail. The FOUR module tests for science I took wore me out, the 50 minute wait inbetween the 3rd and the 4th pretty much drained all enthusiam, alas, lets hope I did well.  RE today wasnt so bad, easy questions on the stuff I'd revisied, but harded questions on stuff I hadnt revised but sorta knew, alas, sorta the test you'd expect really. I REALLY want to get an A* in this, Im sorta expected too...and I could.  umm, Jo's really into Ben at the moment, sorta annoying as She's dumped me (see Dean and Nelson) before, looks like I'll have to find something else to do, meh.  mmm, Im sorta in a weird mood at the moment, I dont really care about going out with anyone, but yet, I sorta would like someone..:/  blaaaaaaaaaaaah, Im sorta frustrated, gah I need some entertainment, but the gcses are boring me SO MUCH!  Well, thats enough from me, expect something from me tomorrow...  Saying that, Im about as reliable as a Tom Emerton(TM) Joke..

       Mood: Calm   Listening To: Nothing, a bit late for it..   Ah, what a very mixed and weird day.  Not totally out of the ordinary though. I woke up, past midday and got myself a pint of tea (yeah, in a pint glass, Im wasnt feeling too hungry) Then went straight on the computer, something I must get out of the habit of doing, I end up wasting far too much time.  I went about starting some ICT Revision for my test on Monday, things looks good, though I need to settle some definate pieces, which I will try to do tomorrow. Speaking of which I plan to try and do as much science work as possible. Which reminds me of the RE I need to finish for Wednesday. Oh, the joy of revision.  Did some running today, times of 8.28 and 6.32-ish non-stop jogging which isnt too bad, I need to keep it up though, Also measured myself again and I seem to be losing some inches around the upperbody which isnt too bad, that or the fact i used string instead of the metal tape to measure may have something to do with it.  Really need to get some work done.  Ah, reminds me that my dad promised to get me a laptop if i got 6 A*'s.....Not sure If I can do it, I'll analyse some of what tests I'll be doing below...   Maths - Could  get an A*...A otherwise  Bio -Could get an A* for all of them....A for all though  Chem -A  Physics -A  Eng Lang -....Could get an A*...Maybe an A  Eng Lit -A Hopefully.  ICT -Depends on the coursework...shame theory is only 40%  RE -I could realistically get an A*  Hist -...It'd be good to get an A  French -mmmm Coursework :A, Oral prolly a B,...need to do well in the listening and reading  Classics -....Prolly a B...  I could get 6 A*'s...though im not sure if I could....talk about an Incentive...

        re·gret    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (r-grt) v. re·gret·ted, re·gret·ting, re·grets   v. tr. To feel sorry, disappointed, or distressed about.  To remember with a feeling of loss or sorrow; mourn.   v. intr. To feel regret.  n.  A sense of loss and longing for someone or something gone.  A feeling of disappointment or distress about something that one wishes could be different.  regrets A courteous expression of regret, especially at having to decline an invitation.    I dont like...to regret in life. It seems to be one of the worser emotions in life. While it's acceptable to understand and to act on times when things have gone wrong. It would be a mistake and tragedy to dwell on it. To look back and see only wrong and to bring back bad memories.  I tend to not regret, while I can look back at 8 months of fancing, and dare I say loving Tom, I do not regret. I just understand that things turn out like this in life, and that I must grow from this. I learnt to accept that not everyone would be as understanding  as him, nor will I expect such love in return.  I tend to not regret loving carelessly, while it hurts, I feel as if it is a duty or perhaps an uncontrollable habit that I suck myself into.

       Mood: Slightly Depressed; Some Hope  Listening To:  Nothing Yet, but "Irish Born, English Heart" by Morrissey soon  The origin for this blog stemmed from my want to put down my emotions, what I feel and what i think. I wanted a place where I could look back at a definite article and not a blur of general feeling at the "round-about" time.  Searching around my contact list, I wanted a random word on their mind, below are the results..   Wheat Shit Wedge Bumblebee Ring Relationships Blank   Enthralling, and eventually didnt really have anything to do with the blog title. The title "The Untitled Work" actually came from the notepad header I was unsing at the time to hold the words.  I guess it was a touch of inspiration

       Mood:  Tired, anxious I need to revise for RE  Listening To:  Nothing :/  Mmm, not a bad English test today, slightly boring but not bad. If the test doesn't challenge me then meh I give up.  French wasn't too bad, though the final question sorta proved how not knowing one verb can ruin your answer, but hopefully that was the only mistake....doubtful.  Me and Jo met up today, talked about loads of stuff, including, tampons, childbirth, blowjobs and giving them, oral sex for women, slagness and how other people treat other people. This was of course after a good solid few hours of revision. Religious debate is fun with Jo. Opinionated Young people rule, except when they're wrong.  Wanna have someone to be with....tho I don't seem to like relationships :/  Rob from NW London seems cool, don't seem him on too much tho, and I don't want to rush stuff, there's no need.  After RE tomorrow the weekend will prolly be revision-based but if I could meet up with Robbie I would, he seems well decent and cool....hmmmm  I think that's it from me for today, maybe a update tomorrow, and no doubt some from over the weekend.

       Mood:  Calm, Happy...getting ready for revision  Listening To: Avril's New Album, which is pretty good, no *bad* songs, then again I mark for Avril so..  WOW, Alots sorta happened since Tuesday..   Wednesday  Cinema, saw Harry Potter, not too bad, wasnt really a kid-ish film, nice plot tho there wasnt really any substance in terms of what happened, no voltemort....the next film will rawk tho.  Went with Aidan, Dan(from Ball Boys, FIT, eyed me up loads...¬.¬), Kate, Claire (Who's been having phone sex with Dan...), Nicole and Jen, cool bunch of guys. Met at 12.30, left at like 8, chatted for ages, was cool though.   Thursday  Planned to meet Ryan, nice guy, tho I didnt feel anything, disliked his accent and general looks, mm I'm too picky. Got the 270 home, kenw I'd pass Jo's dads shop which she'd be working at so I gave her a call. Got a strange text from someone called Dan wich i later worked out who it was (15/m/nearish me). We had tons of fun and took LOOOOOAAAADSS of pics, some of which are on faceparty  urlLink which you can click here to see .  Jo's amazingly cool.   Friday   Usual Wated Day (c). Heh, sorta okish day played on PC, Downloaded new Avril Album and Maroon 5. Wanna get Lost Prophets, prolly get it today and leave the comp to download it.  lol, THAT was Friday.   The Weekend Ahead....   REVISION.......doubtful, I need to get some done tho, It would be a real shame if I dont.   Bah, I really like Jayson.... :/

       Mood:  Happy :)  Listening To:  Nothing, too late  Wow, wasted Monday and Tuesday. Dossed, played games, surfed, chatted. Had a good bitching session with craig tho. Really dislike Mark; have no real problem with Ben, but how he begs it from ben and paddy is sorta sad.  Aidans grandad had a heart attack, hence the shortage of him. Jo was at Marks for 2 nights, hence her shortage. I'll be out to the cinema tomorrow, maybe with a review for the blog, who knows.  Reason for happiness?...Ryan. Pretty damn cute guy. Sweet, never been in a relationship before. Seems well decent, heh fallen in love (L) but yeah he's well cool and we'll prolly be meeting, w00t!  Short sweet post. I think I post more when depressed :/  PS:- Reading Dead Air by Iain Banks, pretty good so far, excellent Author.  End Transmission

        Mood:  Fairly Happy  Listening To:  Bit of Elton John    &nbsp;  What can I say, I've been busy? GCSE's were fun...well tiring for sure, but everything seems to be ok. et up with a guy on the last day of exams, got quite excited about it...for nothing, the guy was a let down...pretencious and the rest.    &nbsp;  Saturday after met up with Katie and Alec, mates of Aidan, went to their school fair, dropped of a card because Aidans grandad died.    &nbsp;  Met up with Jo, Lucy, Aidan and Kerry the next Sunday to go and watch the mens final. Party at the common afterwards. Gathering on the common the next day.    &nbsp;  Since then its been on/off gatherings of mates.    &nbsp;  However last night I stayed round Aidan's, I mean nothings wrong with that at all. He's probably the person in the world ive most been able to connect with, whereas with Jo we can talk easily and we can just bond easily.    &nbsp;  Jo thinks I fancy Aidan, and this is where the pointless worrying begins, because when someone sayd you fancy someone else invitably it ends up happing if you find the other person attractive, and I think it may be. Which would be a waste of time. I respect his sexuality pretty much as I expect he respects mine, as I understand he's straight, it's just the pointless speculation and consideration which will do no good.    &nbsp;  I'm getting on well with this guy called Nick. Though he doesnt see himself being with a guy for the rest of his life which is slightly disheartening, however is the catch as all good things have in life.    &nbsp;  I'm pretty sure I'll end it there....for how long....I myself dont even know.    &nbsp;
