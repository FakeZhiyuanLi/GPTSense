       Am I surrounded by idiots?!   Now I really notice who really is my friend and who not.So, Isabel definetly is the one who isn't. Isabel, she was supposed to be my  best friend,  has finally her first boyfriend. I feel happy for her, really, but I don't understand why she tells her boyfriend secrets and lies about me?! I guess she does because she's afraid that her boyfriend  Johannes  could like me more than her.... I mean - would  I  be a good friend if I took away her boyfriend?! And though  Johannes  doesn't know me, he takes my name in vain. By this behaviour I can see that he's still not mature enough, although he is 21.... +laugh+      Yesterday at a beachparty a young man (26, I dunno his name) talked to me. Well, he was a bit drunken... He asked me if I'm a single-child and I said "yes". He then answered that I seem to be snooty and selfish. I didn't show an interest in that in front of him. But secretly I'm wondering if he's right. Well, I have to admit that I'm regaled, yes... but it's not that pernicious, I know there are people that really get everything what they want and that's not(?) the case with me...      Am I really arrogant or s.th.? But when I'm really that snooty, that selfish, that arrogant - why do I have then that much friends? Are they my friends anyway? Am I thinking too much? o.O   Maybe he's right and that's the reason why I now haven't got a boyfriend.....?   I want to fall in love....    urlLink http://www.getpics.de/liebe/1.gif   kay, bye 4 now.....

       Tonight I phoned my hostsister in Ohio, she's so cool! Well, we have to share a room but I think there's no problem cause we're getting along well. I'm so exciting, it must be awesome to spend a year in another country with other cultures! And when I'm back in Germany my English will be really improved! ;)       I'm thinking all the time of my ex-boyfriend. On Tuesday it's 12 weeks when he left me... Yeah, he left me because of another girl... I don't know what likes about her. I know her from seeing and she doesn't seem to be nice; but it's his choice. Now they aren't together anymore and I would like to call him but I think if he would like to talk to me, he would have called but he didn't and so I better leave it this way.   But maybe I'll call him the day before I'm going to leave Berlin and say goodbye...what do you think? Should I say goodbye or should I just leave?
