        Do you remember     The first time we met?     The first time I saw you--     I'll never forget.       &nbsp;   Your vision was cloudy,     The tears in your eyes.     I gazed on in silence,     As we looked to the skies.       &nbsp;   It's hard to forget you,     Hard as I try.     I ask the same questions     Whenever you come to mind:       &nbsp;   Why aren't you here, now?     Why don't you return?     There's so much to teach you--     And so much to learn.       &nbsp;   You turned to me sadly,     And asked for my name.     I felt I should tell you,     And did, just the same.       &nbsp;   I could sense your innocence,     Your inner beauty, clear.     My heart, it beat wildly     Everytime you came near.       &nbsp;   I want to forget     Your kind, sweet face.     But my fondest memories     Are impossible to erase.       &nbsp;   And then there are times     When I know you are near.     I whisper your name,     Expecting you to appear.       &nbsp;   But you choose to stay hidden,     You chose to forget.     Did you feel nothing special     The first time we met?       &nbsp;   I've returned to that spot,     I've gazed at the skies.     I've remembered the clouds--     And the tears in your eyes.       &nbsp;   ~The Demoness Tetsumaru

        Looking, but never really seeing,     Touching, but never really feeling,     Hearing, but never really listening to me,     These are the ways you have let me down.       &nbsp;   My love, a deep and powerful desire for you,     My dream, a wish for us to be together always,     My soul, crying out for your attention,     These are the ways that I loved you.       &nbsp;   But, you coldn't see that desire,     You couldn't feel that wish,     You couldn't listen to my soul's plea--     And so these are the ways      I must say goobye.       &nbsp;   ~The Demoness Tetsumaru

        A darkened flame,     A dimmed twilight,     A forceful quarrel,     A wronged right.       &nbsp;   A stifled cry,     An imaginary real.     A crowded abyss,     A mistaken feel.       &nbsp;   A crossed line,     A world of grey.     A closed door,     And hell to pay.       &nbsp;   A withered rose,     A broken word.     A joyless song,     Left yet unheard.       &nbsp;   A teary farewell,     A world fallen apart.     These are the words     Of a broken heart.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   ~The Demoness Tetsumaru

        The hair, the fire-colored hair,     That stretches down beyond the waist;     The skin, chocolate-colored brown,     Contrasts beautifully with the face.       &nbsp;   The eyes, two emeralds that light the face,     The sparkle, glittering in the eyes.     They dazzle, giving the features grace,     Reflecting the crescent moon in the skies.       &nbsp;   The smile, warm, fantastic, alive,     Add light and beauty to thy name.     To weaken all, the expression seems to strive,     And put the shimmering stars to shame.       &nbsp;   The attire, seemingly shadowed in the twilight,     Lets it be cloaked in night.     Those eyes, seeking the other's light,     Those emeralds, that captures the other's sight...       &nbsp;   ~The Demoness Tetsumaru

        Do you care?      I'm sitting here, crying over you.&nbsp;      Do you care?      I don't think I can go on without you.      Do you care?      I cannot face the world without you.      Do you care?      I think that I may die without you.      Do you care?      I'm lying here, dying over you.      Do you care?      ...I think that I still love you...&nbsp;        &nbsp;    ~The Demoness Tetsumaru

        A sweet serenity,  An unnerving calm.  A peaceful tranquility,  An unearthly song.   A deafening silence,  A crowded clear.  An impossible reverance,  A shrouded tear.   A mystery to the heart,  A fallen might.  A lightness of soul,  A brightness of night.   A peace that is brought  To the heart, spirit and mind--  For all those who seek it,  I hope, someday, you find.   ~The Demoness Tetsumaru
