      Hey, I watched the clip of the closing ceremonies for the Winter Olympics.  Jane sent me a small clip of it since  urlLink Moby  was one of the performers. In case you didn't know, I'm a big fan.  urlLink Check this link out , and read his journal about what was going through his mind before, during, after... such a cool guy. He updates his weblog frequently, which is another reason why he's so cool.  Alright. Now it's REALLY time to go study.  Right.

      Wow, it's 3:20 AM.  We stayed up playing Gran Turismo 3... what a rush.  I discovered this futuristic concept car, ZZ II, from a small Japanese car company called Tommy Kiara or something like that... phew. It handled really well, had great acceleration, had lots of power, etc.  Anyhow.  Wow. I'm actually keeping this thing updated... maybe I'll post a real thought now.  Tonight, I "led" praise again at church.  This week's preparation was a little hastier than the past few weeks, and I found myself focusing upon guitar parts to invent instead of the actual themes I was hoping to stress and focus upon.  Well, actually, that's how every week goes.  And, as soon as I get up there every week, I get the nervous jitters that I usually get when I do stuff in front of people... which in turn makes me forget all that I had thought of and practiced, and things then don't go as I'd hoped or planned...  At the moment I start stressing inside my mind about how I'm not keeping beat or how I totally just screwed up a song, God always then seems to take over.  The lyrics start to have a more intimate emotional impact, and I find myself playing and singing softer and starting to  listen .  I think at those moments of stillness, He really does become the real worship leader.  People start responding more emotionally and thoughtfully in prayer and in quiet song, and somehow the message of His Grace becomes much sweeter sounding to the heart... the themes He called me to focus on during the week come up again in my mind, and I start to sense this emotional intensity that comes from and  that can only be appreciated by being still and meditating upon His Word.  At that moment, He really does make it clear to me... "leading" an effective time of worship doesn't take flash or talent, it takes His influence and a heart that is willing to pursue Him through song and prayer.  I wish I can remember this every time I prepare.  God always reminds me of that truth, but I always forget after a couple of days I receive it.  Hopefully I'll get it right next time.  —The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.— ||.Psalm 51:17.||

      Movie night was fun! "The Professional" seemed to satisy everyone. Hopefully. But I'm sure the freshly made donuts, chicken wings, etc. sealed the deal for sure. Yahoo. OK, time to clean up. I'm going to also think of more interesting things to post, like musings, observations, things I'm workin' on, etc... look out in the future.

      whoo! what a long day of class.  i'm taking a class called intermedia studio; the group i'm in had a a brainstorm session for our end of the year project. we're thinking of having a live jazz band perform with visual elements that directly respond to and visualize the music you're hearing, in order to conduce a dance environment and convey the interconnection between the visual and auditory senses in music.  wow. that's a mouthful.  come to movie night tonight!

      Today, I pulled a semi-all-nighter doing that dynamic systems homework. phew.  anyhow, to my surprise, a big package came from whom I already mentioned was "the best:" jane! thanks.  I'll be sure to check out the moby beedeo clips (you keep saying poorly edited and whatnot, but the thought is infinitely more important, and it's probably great anyhow) and start practicing with the slide whistle.     I reiterate: You the best.

      This is my final post for the evening... must... finish... dynamic systems homework.... must... prepare... for friday worship... Anyhow, it turns out that I'm getting an offer to go to grad school here at Hopkins, which is cool, but I'm getting no funding, which is not.  Yeah, basically, I don't think I'd be able to go here for at least an year... if I work and get fellowships, maybe...  BUT THAT MEANS I'D HAVE TO BE HERE FOREVER!    (well, for at least 5 more years)  God, I don't know what you want me to do, what you want me to learn, research, discover, etc... please, just strengthen me to simply do what i should be doing now to the best of my ability.

      What a day!  9:30 AM - Woke up, showered, hung around 10:30 AM - Drive to meet up with ATD 11:20 AM - After a couple of missteps and miscommunications, we made it to Reba's house.  Hung out. Ate. 12:30 PM - Left for the Greyhound @ Center City Philly. 1:40 PM - Got ticket. Boarded. 2:00 PM - Sketched a scene from the bus in my journal. Slept. 4:00 PM - Once at Port Authority in NY, bought a ticket for bus ride to Parsippany.  Met a guy in line. 4:30 PM - Bus ride home. 5:30 PM - Hung out at CompUSA while waiting for Dad to pick me up. Settled in, called Jimmy, slept. 7:40 PM - Left for an adult cell group meeting with my folks and brother. 11:30 PM - Arrived at my brother's apartment.  Ok, so basically, in a matter of one day, I was in Philly, NY, Parsippany, and New Brunswick.  Crazy, huh?  Oh! it's 12! Happy birthday, Edmund.

      Well, Jimmy and I made it up quickly and safely to Jimmy Choi's apartment.  It was weird... Jimmy Choi lives in the same apartment complex as this girl I used to give rides to and from church during high school.  Anyhow, Jimmy took us to Buca Di Beppo, which had some mighty fine Italian.  Afterwards....  Jimmy and Jimmy took it upon themselves to violate and torture me.  I was not amused.  They forced me down and held this girly rabbit hair band to my head and took my picture...  Scary.  Ok.  I go sleep now.

      Today was a good day.  After running errands, I was going to get a haircut this morning... but Edmund was studying at the library, so I couldn't pass up the chance to hang out with him for lunch.  Times with people are never to be passed up, you know? Especially if they're cool.  As well, it's his birthday on Sunday (everybody wish him a happy birthday) so cheer him up... he thinks he's getting old.  Psshhh.    Edmund, you're a cool brother.  Happy Birthday.  Anyhow, I went straight to class down at Peabody; it was ok, a little tiring since I got like 3 hours of sleep. I've been haywired all day (Ed can attest to that).  Tonight, I'll be heading off to Jimmy Choi's place up in Conshohocken, PA, a suburb north of Philly... very near where I used to live.  Very cool.  Ok, I'm off to clean the apartment a bit then go to philly.  Arriveduci.

It was addressed to:  Mr. Timothy Kang 10 East 33rd Street Apt. 300D Baltimore, MD 21218  Yet, the greeting is:  Dear Mr. Patronik:  Hmm... so... is it to me, or to this guy with last name Patronik?  Right.  Anyhow, it's time to go to Danny's.  Good night.

      A new day! And a nice day it sure is outside... sunny and 60 degrees. A little on the chilly side but still nice.  I've acquired some more pics, and have been working on the popup picture window template.  It'll have commentary soon... so watch out!  Ok, time for the library. Maybe I'll be productive...  Again I reiterate, 3.5+ years, and I haven't learned. :-)

      When I went to drop of my books at the library, I thought it'd be nice to see if anyone was there.  The library is essentially the student union of our school... at least, M-level, the main level, is.  People actually do study there, but mostly it's a gabfest going on there.  It hit me... for all the time I've ever gone to the library, maybe 10% of it was actually productive because of me being stupid enough to think that I'd actually productive on M-level.  3.5+ years, and I still haven't learned.  Ok. Good night. Enjoy the pictures.

      Tonight was a great evening, folks.  Jimmy and I made fresh potato chips and fries, complete with salt and vinegar.  It was very tasty... oily... and oh so... oily.  Check out the pictures section; it is now officially up. I'll be adding commentary and streamlining the viewing of the pix... so stay tuned!

      Wow, what a good practice today. I practiced guitar for about an hour; today's regimen was focused on strumming.  I used a program called "Fruity Loops" as both a metronome and pattern trainer... it's really cool, basic point and click. I've been trying to train myself speed, consistency, endurance, and a good ol' sense of rhythm... I'm especially trying to get down a 1/32 strum.  By the way, I'm on my way to putting pictures up.  First up is the trip to Boston last January.  Jane and Amanda came down to hang out here with everyone;  at the end of that week, Jimmy, his—ok, now he's our—friend Dan, and I drove up with them to hang out in Boston.  What would have been a 7 hour drive (we actually were making quite good time) ended up a 14 hour doozy... thanks to this tractor trailer that stopped all traffic RIGHT before an exit were about to get off of. We sat parked on the highway for 3 hours... it was crazy.  We then ate at this quaint little Friendly's in NY; I think three of us had this meatloaf platter thing because it came with a free sundae.  Finally, after we made it back and dropped Dan off, we hung out in Boston for the rest of the weekend (after a solid 5 hours of sleep).  Wow, it's already been almost 2 months since then.  Time sure flies.  Speaking of time, I should finish putting up those pix and get to my schoolwork.

      So, last night I gave my computer's power cord to Jimmy. The computer was distracting me too much for me to study for my midterm... which by the way was good till the end.  The last couple of problems stumped.  Danny's over for lunch again. I feel bad for him.. he had both the same exam I took and Phys Found at 4.  Poor Danny.  Ok, I'd write more but I gotto go cook.  I'll be back.

      Well, it's almost 8:00 and I just finished my BK dinner. Time to get going with this midterm study session. What subject? Design and Analysis of Dynamic Systems. For all you engineering folk, it comprises of applied diff. eq. to model mechanical, eletrical, thermal, and fluid systems.  Requires a bunch o' basic physics and stuff.  Not so bad of a class, pretty straightforward.. just gotto do it.  For all of you non-engineering folk, it's a bunch of math.  We draw lots of pictures and lots of equations... and then we solve them.  Sounds like fun, eh?  Anyhow, I just read what I've written so far and it's stunning how boring this all is.  Ok.  Time to stop being boring. Good day.

      Studying, rather, the motivation to study, has been difficult. I havea midterm tomorrow but every time I sit down to work, I get all antsy; after about 5-10 minutes, I end up doing something else for 10-30 minutes.  I don't like that ratio; it'd be nice to be antsy about doing something else for 5-10 minutes and absorb myself in studying for long periods of time... but man. I really have to fight to get focused.  Anyhow, before I go to Burger King with the Supes—make sure you check out his  urlLink website  as well, the link is under Jane's—I'll finish that random thought.  This is my hope for myself and for others...  is it possible for us to make an effort to not always assume we have "figured someone out?" I.e., I think to a certain extent we can, but it'd be cool if we made an effort to just accept what we see and move on with it.  There's more to everyone than we can see at the moment.  Ok. That's my touchy feely thing for today.  Time to eat some greasy fast food.

      Darnit.  Have you ever woken up to realize that you have a nasty crick in your neck because you slept wrong all night?  I have to go throughout the day with my head tilted to just function.  The pain... the horror...  Danny Dokko, stop laughing.

      Here's a random thought.  I find that I tend to this as well...but one thing I notice that has a big impact on relationships is the phenomenon of "figuring someone out." I think that's one of the biggest problems within relationships... we think we've figured out the personality of someone and instantly pass our judgement over them.  What are some problems with that? 1) Life is boring - the relationships become stale and we start to get "sick of that person" 2) Life is unhappy - who's honestly happy when they're complaining about someone else's foibles? We also start acting towards the people in ways that will only make them respond more negatively than before. More on this later.  Danny Dokko is here. And I must entertain him.

      A new day.  I'm about to go off to class.  So, I've started Leviticus.  It's not as scary as I thought it'd be... so far.  It's quite interesting, actually.  Quite detailed... God requires a lot for Himself...  Today in class, I stole Danny Dokko's pen cap.  As he tried grab it from my hand, he stabbed himself with the pencil I was holding: "Ow. Excuse me while I remove this piece of lead from my hand."  It was quite funny.

      Just caught the last part of today's Nightline special on the World Trade Center six month anniversary.  Ted Koppel was checking out the processing center in Staten Island where NY policemen, firemen, etc. take all of the remains and sift through them for any sort of personal identification.  It's a 24 hour operation located on top of an old garbage dump, where the debris goes through many layers of filtering until money—over $45,000 of loose change and cashe has been collected—  That was the main point Koppel seemed to get through:  only in America would there be a massive effort undertaken to help bring closure to the families still grieving over lost ones.  That made me really think... not just about the patriotism of what he was saying but of simply the liberties that we enjoy in this country.  We have so much, yet it seems we still seem to complain more about our state of being than ever before.  We're picky about the food we eat, the grades we get (and don't get), our jobs, etc... At least, that's something from which I've not escaped, I admit.  Has 9/11 changed things?  Has it changed things for me?  Am I more grateful?  Is my life changed by a deeper sense of grace?  Am I thinking too hard?  "Back" to studying.

      Dag. It's already 11 PM.  This evening is a prime example of how I end up handing assignments late, etc. etc. After review session, I got back here around 8:30.  Since then, I've done nothing. I started to read something on the net, and chat a little, and next thing i know, it's an hour past. So, I thought I would be a little more productive and focus on practicing guitar.  Didn't work so well, because I kept reading the  urlLink series of articles  I was reading.  The worst part is, they were not important.  Stupid pieces of humor that really contributed nothing to my brain except a good laugh.  Maybe for 10 minutes, that's fine.. but for over an hour? Not good.  I finally snapped to it and focused; I worked on my strumming regimen: endurance, syncopation, and the combination of both.  Man, it's tough to keep learning and developing.  But hey, I gotto keep working at it.  Anyhow, so, it's 11 and I need to get studying for my midterm on Wednesday, as well as other stuff.  One thing I'm hoping I can get done before I graduate:  a personal art project that is a culmination of all I've learned so far artisically and with my engineering stuff.  Dunno what.  Maybe a song.  Maybe something visual.  Maybe something both.  Or, maybe nothing at all.  Boring life?  Maybe. So sue me.

      Quiet time has been up in the air lately. I've gotten to this point to which I frequently get: what book of the Bible do I start going through next? I was thinking Leviticus, because I've never studied it before and it seems that I should.  Maybe going through all that detail about how specific one must be to worship/approach God will teach me a deeper grasp of His Holiness.  Anyhow, there's been a lot of prayer topics bouncing around in my head today... I wish I could just drop everything and just sit and pray. But, it's time to get ready for Dynamic Systems Lab.

      I'm about to go off to class, but had to get a little blurb in.  For some reason, I've been very tired for the past 2 days... keep falling asleep.  Let's hope that I don't have mono.  Last Friday, I shared some ice cream with 4 guys from my intermedia studio group. Maybe I'm being paranoid.  Maybe.

      Ok.  So, today I go to the library to study, and I fell asleep. LIttle did I know, that whilst I was in my state of bliss, Danny Dokko took it upon himself to take my shoe. So, when I woke up and packed all my belongings to go home, I bent down below the desk to put on my shoes—yes, I sometimes take them off to let my feet breathe—I found one missing, and the other with a note that said, "Clue: Your buddy has been 'reserved.'"  Instantly, I knew the culprit... by his handwriting, and by the virtue that a mutual friend was working at the reserves desk during that time.  To top it off, I was in the FARTHEST POSSIBLE SPOT in the library from the reserves desk; I was studying at the far end of D-level, the lowest level in the library, while the reserves desk is on the opposite end of the library on M-level (ground floor).  Meaning, I had to walk all the across the floor, take the elevator, and walk the rest of the way to the reserves desk with only a shoe on.  No phsyical harm done of course, but yes, some funny stares.  I got it back. But man. I have to admit, he got me good.  Let the games begin.

      For once, I actually woke up at at 7:10 today.  Usually I repeatedly hit the snooze until 8:00, but today only once.  It was good, I actually had time to do a good job of ironing and grooming. At church, I had a great time playing bass... it's just so fun.  Kenny Choi, the speaker today was pretty cool, but I'm not sure what his main point was; commitment is better than dedication?  Know "the religion of your fathers" in your heart, not just in the head?  Anyhow, the message was a character study of Jacob.  He explained the passage—Genesis 28:10-22—of Jacob's dream as he was running away from home, and how that time became the point where dedication to God became a true commitment.  Hm.  when wll that time be for me?  Anyhow, I had the pleasure of eating lunch with the UMAB pharmacy/nursing students today in the fellowship hall.  They're really cool; I hope that these relationships will really become true "iron sharpening iron" experiences...  It's just strange to see how within Hope Chapel, there are so many different worlds.  Some people still don't really know each other—nor the existence of each other—and it sometimes saddens me that they don't make the effort to.  I'm just hoping that over time we'll learn as a whole to branch out and really get to know each other... how can we do that?  Ok. Nap time.  Estoy muy cansado.

      When I said it's REALLY time to go study, I packed up my stuff and headed off to pick up a bite to eat, visit Angela along the way (to deliver a letter to her from Jane), and go study.  What really happened:  I got my food, realized I had forgotten the letter, and ended up talking to Angela for half an hour. Of course, by then I had to go to praise team practice.  So basically, today was really not study day.  But, bible study at practice on Luke 13:1-9 was very eye-opening and humbling.  In short, what I personally got out of it was that Christ always was making the point of what real spiritual people are like. 1) They are broken and humble; they're willing to admit their absolute need for God. 2) After they receive His blessing, they respond by constantly returning to Him in thankfulness and by constantly striving to do His will. Both characteristics are extremely hard to come by; I can attest to that personally.  I don't really admit my need for God until something bad happens. And, after I cry out for His help and receive it, I find myself instantly forgetting about what He did and just go back to being my old self.  I'd try to give an example right now, but this post is long enough as is...  urlLink email  me if you want me to elaborate.  So, yeah... I really got a lot out of it... thanks Edmund for leading it.  Your bible studies always stimulate my heart and mind.  Afterwards we ate at Chile's.  Gyju presented her idea for a night where the praise team members would present their own personal take on what praise and worship really is, why they're in the team, and what God's been doing through this calling... interesting. I like. Go Gyju.  Ok. Good night.

       urlLink Check this link out , it's Amy's (whom I met @ Penn) website. I think I'll place a link to the right.  Done.  Anyhow, today, I woke up, went grocery shopping, cooked up a storm with my brothers for my birthday.  My older brother made oxtail stew and chowder; I made spaghetti and kalbi.  Joe, my younger bro, cleaned during the whole time and helped with things here and there.... mmm, it was a hearty meal.  Anyhow, I fell asleep, got a haircut from my mom, and have been reading and doing random stuff.  I read the recent issue of New York Times Magazine because it had a very good spread of articles; the focus was on the future of music.  Moby was featured... very cool.  If you don't know me, I'm a big fan.  Anyhow, tonight, I vow to get my work done.  It is time to study like I've never studied before.  Please, Lord, help me study well.

      Today I went to Philadelphia to visit Jin Choi, my friend from high school, and to visit UPenn to see what it's like.  After all, Jin is a senior there, so everything worked out nicely.  After I got there, I hung out at his dorm a little, then went to eat at Philly Diner.  I got this grilled chicken thing, it was pretty good.  I'm convinced now that all diners have the same distributor or something, since every dish I've had at every diner I've eaten have this diner "taste."  Dunno how to describe. It's not bad, not good, just distinct.  I had parked at a meter (25 cents for 15 minutes... what a ripoff!), so all day I had to keep checking the time and feeding the meter. It was a bit annoying for me, but oh well.  I hope it didn't inconvenience them; I got a couple good quick convo's with Jin.  After all, we hadn't seen each other for four years.  Yay. It was a great time.  After the diner, we got ice cream (thanks Christina Kim for buying it; though I doubt you'd ever read this, I thought I'd give credit where it's due) at this new supermarket nearby, fed my meter, checked out the Penn Bookstore, checked email at the VanPelt Library, stopped at Douglas' (a cosmetic store that Amy Park (is that your last name?) wanted to check out), fed my meter, and stopped back at Jin's dorm.  Amy needed some help with her physics lab, and during that time I made the discovery that her lab partner is this guy that was in my high school youth group.  *sniff* these kids, all grown up and gone to college....    So, afterwards, I left.  What a quick 4 hours, I tell ya... it felt like I just got there, and now I had to leave. Oh darnit. Traffic was thick, and I missed an exit... so I ended up going past my old neighborhood again, 2nd time in one week.  So weird.  Oh, so, at the bookstore, I was telling Jin and Amy about this funny little clip I had of a penguin, so  urlLink here it is .  Enjoy!

      So, it's Thursday night, Spring Break is almost already over.  Dangit.  Yesterday I slept over my brother's place and woke up with a plan to study.  Well, I did get some work done.  Ok, I did get a little work done. Ok.  I didn't get much done.  I ended up watching cable, testing out the webcam I bought a while ago, going out to eat with my brother (we planned to play racquetball but the courts were booked), and going out again for some wings with my brother's friends.  Phew.  Then, today I had a plan to get some work done.  Again, no.  Instead, I weeded my mom's garden and watched a buttload of tv.  TV vs. agony of handing in homework late....  TV won, but man. Handing in homework late? Arg.  What a Spring Break.

      I drove to New Brunswick to visit my older brother Steve's apartment.  Known to some as "Shuilaba," I've called him "Hamem" (pronounced hum-mem) all my life so I'll refer to him as such from here on out.  Hamem invited me over to eat, since he was cooking dinner anyhow.  It was good... savory beef ribs and linguini with seafood alfredo sauce.  No wonder he's bigger every time I see him.  Anyhow, I decided to sleep over so that I can focus on studying tomorrow, and play racquetball with Hamem after he gets back from work.  Now.  To get the details straight about last Friday night.  To preface, earlier that night, I overheard Jimmy & Jimmy talking about how they were going to "get me." Naturally, for the rest of the night I was on guard... but as you'll see, it didn't do much to prevent disaster from happening.  So, we're playing Test Drive Rally.  Jimmy Su got a call from Jane Choi for plans about meeting with ATD the next day. All seemed normal... until I started to ask Jane for some more details about where to meet, since I knew the area pretty well.  That's when the trouble started.  I went over to Jimmy Choi's room to look up the map of the area online... and that's when I heard their footsteps behind me.  Fearing the worst, I ran into his room and slammed and locked the door.  At least, I tried to do so, but they figured out a way to bypass the lock.  Yelling for help, I dropped the phone not out of will, but out of the fact that they bumrushed me.  The next 15 minutes was a daze of torture and wrestling and me hiding under the desk for dear life.  Finally, it was over.  So I thought.  Later that night, it started up again. I was on the couch with Jimmy and Jimmy, and the next thing I know, they were going at it again.  This time, in the midst of it, Jimmy Choi pulled out this bunny hair band thing, complete with head and paws.  Jimmy Su cracked up and rushed to get his camera ready... for the next 20 minutes, Jimmy fought to put it on as I was on the couch.  Finally, they got the shot they wanted, and I slithered under the coffeetable for refuge.  Unfortunately, they weren't finished.  Jimmy Choi eventually forced me out from under the table and SAT on me. I think that did it.  I kept fighting and crying out for Albert, Jimmy's roommate and fellow Hopkins alum, to get home quick and help me.   Well, it just so happened that he came 3 minutes after they got their second shot.  For shame.  So, I told Albert to help me the next time that they would try to do something, but of course, he wasn't too sympathetic... especially when they did it again.  By that last attempt, I was just too tired.  I couldn't fight both Jimmy Choi sitting on top of me and Albert holding my arms down.  You guys are weird, scary, and unrelenting.  Phew.

      This morning, I tried to study at the library near my house.  After falling asleep for a couple of hours, I was able to get some personal reading done.  I finished "Personal Narrative" by Jonathan Edwards.  I.e., it's his personal testimony.  Very cool.  After stopping at home for lunch, I went back and tried to study.  Man, I just have a struggle to concentrate. I did get stuff done... but not as much of course as I'd like.  I was also thinking about a lot of things, and praying, throughout the day, about how to handle what's going on in my heart and in my mind.  I think soon I'll be posting thoughts in separate files for all to view, since they probably won't fit in these small blurbs.  I'm thinking about discussing how I've been dealing with some issues in my life that may seem relevant to many.  We'll see what happens. See you all later.

As for Jimmy's story (check his webpage) about how their taking pictures of me, I have to set it straight... as he left out some details.  But now, I must go do dishes.

      This past weekend has already been packed with so many memories.  Driving up, through, and around philly with Jimmy Su, especially the areas I grew up in... Buca di Beppo... Jimmy's apartment (albeit, traumatic experiences)... lunch w/ ATD (how was the wedding?)... driving through Philly again...  What stories does this week withhold?  I'm hoping that it'll be one of those life-changing experiences.  Good night.

      Wow. What a day.  Last night was really strange, I tell you.  After coming back from trying to do homework at the library, I tried to continue working on my homework due at 10 AM this morning.  I also had to prepare myself for Good Friday worship service: make the set list, think about what to focus on, etc.  Anyhow, what ended up happening was, I started thinking, maybe I should just not do my homework since we're allowed 2 late homeworks. That way, I'd be able to focus on the prep time.  That's when the weirdness began.  I started to get a little tired, and I also went over to Jimmy's room to ask him for his opnion on what I should do: homework, or prep?  Upon hearing his reply, for some reason it really infuraited me.  "Do what ever you want, but don't come to me to justify whatever you do" was sort of the gist of it.  Now, I know he didn't mean any harm with it, since he really wasn't paying attention.  But for some strange reason, this wave of anger and judgement washed over me and I started to think all these scathing, judgemental thoughts of Jimmy.  I decided to do my homework instead, since it seemed the more obedient thing to do, but i couldn't focus on what I was doing; those angry thoughts kept creeping in.  So, I decided to take a shower to just relax and take a big time out.  Something was up.  Somehow, upon looking back on it, it seemed to be some sort of spiritual attack mixed in with my natural sinful tendency to judge.  The suddeness of the anger (when I was perfectly fine the minute before), the big temptation to entertain and dwell in those thoughts, and their distracting effect from my studies seem to all point to marks of spiritual attack: malice, pride, and distraction.  I started to pray immediately about asking God to protect my mind, and I started to counter all the feelings and thoughts with the Truth of Christ's sovereignty over my them.  I think that hepled a lot; it was still there, but they weren't as bad.  Weird.  Anyhow, I ended up falling asleep at around 3-4 AM and not getting the homework done.  Furthermore, my alarm went off at 7:00, but I ended up hitting snooze until 11:30.  I just couldn't get up; the exhaustion was so overpowering.  Well, long story short, after I woke up, I prepared the rest of the setlist, went to class, came back, practiced, and went to church with Scott Burkholder (great guy at my church!).  Worship turned out to be really amazing, and we were all really blessed by it.  What do I mean?  Well, the time of singing songs together was very emotionally charged and responsive; we focused on praising God for sending Christ to die for our sins (especially since it's Good Friday), and simply praising Him.  Funny, how those times are the times in which I feel the  best ... the exhilaration I get from other means can never match how I feel at those moments of praise.  Well, it's time to sleep. Thanks for reading.

      Since 4:00, I've basically reverted to my natural self... the lazy, whimsical, and unfocused individual.  I've just been drifting around all day (for 7 hours!)... fiddling with the guitar, talking to people online, cooking dinner, giving guitar lesson, then coming here to the library to study. Of course, I didn't get any studying done.  I've been socializing with people I've not had the chance to talk to in a while, so that's good.  However, when I sat down to study, my mind was abuzz and I just could not sit still.  It happens a lot and I think it's a sign that I'm not really in a good environment to study.  No wonder my productivity schedule has always been focused on those last minute cram sessions.  Lack of discipline has always been a weakness of mine that I have yet to conquer, but I know it's something God has been calling me to and enabling me to battle.  On the topic of God, a struggle I've been having recently is the timeless battle of applying what I read and digest from the Word to my life... the question of how I can get my heart and soul to grasp what I know in my mind.  This subject came up in a recent conversation with Amanda from Wellesley, and it's interesting how she brought it up at a time in which I've been thinking about what it really means to worship lifestyle.  I've been studying Ecclesiastes, and I'm again brought to that place that I often get to in my walk... how do I heed the instruction of the Teacher?  "The conclusion when all has been heard is to fear God and keep His commandments," the recurring theme of the purpose of man: to enjoy the gifts of God and to enjoy worshipping Him, the warning to "let your words be few" as you approach God. How can I really live this out? It sure takes a lot of discipline...  More on this later.  Time to go home and sleep.

      Phew! PDE exam is over.  I think it went ok, considering I was so in the dark just a few days ago.  Anyhow, when should I plug my computer back in?  Do I dare to? Can I start using it again without the worry of it sucking my time away?  Maybe not yet. I think this weaning process is still not finished yet... and in case you're wondering, I'm typing this from the library.

      So, I got an email from Carnegie Mellon saying they sent the notification letter for my application.  Looks like I'm not going to CMU for grad school.  Unless, of course, I can pay for it myself.  Oh well. At any rate, I reap what I sow, eh? It's good. This whole application process has been a good crucible for me; I've really seen firsthand the effects of character faults and laziness and whatnot instead of knowing about that they are. So, I think college definitely in that aspect has been a really rewarding time for me; I definitely don't regret coming here to Hopkins, regardless of all the bad stories and rumors that always mill about it.  There is some truth to them (the competition, the sometimes oppressive academic atmosphere, the extremely sheltered environment) but the relationships God's led me to, the academic and experiential training, learning what church and ministry is really about, and overall the nonstop lessons on humility have all proved to show that God really does work for the good of those who love Him.  Wow.  It's already almost over.

      This entry is my 3rd attempt today, since all other attempts were thwarted by slow and bad library computers.  So, yesterday after Jimmy Choi polished off his 50th wing at Bill Bateman's, we returned and hung out at our place.  After some time, he started jamming on my guitar... and yes, one thing led to another, and we started to record some more songs.  2 were instrumentals that I recorded to MD, but unfortunately I erased them by accident later that night.  We then recorded "So We Come," complete with an overdub guitar solo. it was great.  Anyhow, class today was uneventful and I ended up either studying at the library (which I will be doing again soon) and going to office hours.  It's still a struggle for me to get myself working at times, but God is always "providing a way out so that I can stand up to" the temptation of laziness.  It's pretty interesting how He does it... like, today, I took a nap, which I was ok.  Earlier on, I was praying that He'd help me study more efficiently, but when it was time wake from the power nap, I of course didn't want to wake up.  I napped for an extra hour, even though my alarm kept going off every 20 minutes.  My reasoning kept getting worse and worse (I need more sleep, I'll study better later because it'll be more efficient, etc.) until finally, the alarm in our fire escape went off.  Yeah, I couldn't turn that off, and that's when I realized, "Argh. I have no reason to be sleeping so much."  Well, God sure provided a way out, regardless of how I felt, and it was definitely for my good.  Thanks God. Yet again, You've shown how you answer prayer when I least expect You to, but always when I really need it.  Ok, off to the library now to resume studying for the P.D.E midterm tomorrow.

      I'm sitting in the basement of Barton Hall as I type this entry. For those of you who don't or didn't go to JHU, Barton is the Electrical Engineering building here at Hopkins. I was supposed to meet a professor with my group for one of my classes, but since we were early, we went to this building since they all work here.  Once again, I have to reiterate how much work I have to do.  Why? Well, I guess it'll keep me accountable to actually doing it: Partial Differential Equations homework and midterm both on Wednesday, Dynamic Systems homework due Friday.  That first class I mentioned is a beast of a class... man. Please think twice before ever taking it.  Yahoo. We go now. Later.

      Wow, I actually got up at 8 today, AND on top of that, it was a good 9 hours of sleep.  I ended up preparing for praise team, hanging out in my room, going to practice, and bumming for the rest of the day.  How does one learn how to fight that really strong urge to do absolutely nothing?  Anyhow, looks like I'm not going to Northwestern, I got my rejection letter yesterday.

Class was cool, and I had ample time afterwards to prepare for praise tonight.  Man I'm tired.  Sleep. It's what's for dinner, since I didn't eat dinner today.

      This week has been one of my laziest, distracted, and most unproductive weeks here in my last 4 years of school.  I don't know why it was so hard for me to get any work done.  As well, I haven't set a time of daily devotion this week, and now I'm starting to see the toll... I've been getting more impulsive and I've been wasting a lot more time.  Maybe it was the sleep deprived weekend. Maybe God's starting to answer a prayer I had over the weekend, "Let me be someone that knows You and is known by You."  Recently I've been trying to get my homework done but I've been blanking out more often; the mental connections simply aren't being made and I'm left frustrated.  Whatever the case, once again it's clear that I'm a sinner in need of Grace.  Grace float down and cover me, a picture painted muddy brown and dirty.

      This week's quote was matter-of-factly stated by Danny Dokko over lunch at Gail's apartment (thanks for lunch, Gail).  It was said while discussing chauvinism, obviously.  Ok ok, so after Gail, Paul, and I stopped laughing, he completed his sentence by adding "...to change the oil."  Right.  What a NICE DAY again.... man.  I love this weather.  I've been borrowing the digital camera from the digital media center on campus, so I'll soon be posting up some pix I've taken. I'm trying to be artistic again.  Ok, stop rolling your eyes.

      This past weekend has been one crazy weekend.  Thursday, after getting up at like... 1? and studying all afternoon, Rena took me out to dinner for my birthday.  Afterwards I went to small group at Scott's, but no one showed so I ended up giving Adam Jackley, his roommate, some guitar lessons. That night I stayed up in a desparate but failed attempt to finish my dynamics homework.  I woke up, prepared for Friday worship, went to class, then to church, then back, then practiced guitar, then slept. Man. What a short day.  Then. Saturday, I went to praise band practice.  And, it turns out, they forced me (well, not necessarily forced, but I just wasn't planning...) to go to Lois' recital. Then, at the reception, we had to wait there forever. I was kinda getting annoyed because I still had that assignment due... to make matters more interesting, when we got back to my place, I saw Jimmy Choi's car parked outside.            "Jimmy Choi? What's he doing here?" I didn't get it.  What was he doing down at Baltimore again? So, we go up, and what do you know, they were holding the door shut.  So the guys with me and I were pushing to get in, and well, when I got in, the lights were all off, but I felt this big squishy thing bounce off of my chest, and heard, "SURPRISE."  As well, "Happy Kwanzaa!", "Happy Veteran's Day!", and other holidays (it's a long story, ask me if you want to know what it means).  Wow. A suprise party!  And they got me these really nice speakers for my computer, as well as a "Live Drive" in which I can plug in my guitar and any other sound source! That was a totally unexpected, shocking gesture. I am still in shock. And I'm very grateful.  Well, except for the 3 times they violated me that night, and except for Jimmy showing everyone the embarassing Adoremus Concert Video from freshman year, the rest of the night was filled with much laughter and joy.  It was a great time, and I'm just so thankful that God has blessed me with such great people.  For pix of the evening, check out  urlLink Jimmy's site .  At any rate, I ended up tossing and turning that night until it as already time for sunrise service.  I went to the Grace Life Church one, since Hope Chapel didn't have it, I miss everyone there, and I wanted to see how things have changed over the past year.  After service, I ate breakfast, went straight to church, came back, slept for 7 hours, then set up the speakers in my room.  Man. What a weekend.

      So. I got into both UPenn and Rutgers, yesterday.  Decision making time... I still have to figure out the whole money situation, and I also have to visit.  I don't think I can just decide till Monday... hopefully Hopkins will be able to push my notification date by a week.  I didn't finish that homework I was working on at the Hut (from the previous entry); Danny and I ended up going back to my place to rest, get up early, and finish as much as we could.  Unfortunately, we just ended up taking turns hitting the snooze button on my alarm clock. Danny went home, I went to class, and neither of us finished the homework. Augghh!  Thanks to my lack of sleep, the rest of my day I was in a daze.  I lost track of what we were singing once during praise time, so there was this uncomfortable wait as I found my spot again in the song.  Praise practice went surprisingly well... I worked the mixer and played bass at the same time.  It was much fun...  Today, Jimmy and I picked up free hats and lunch at the Homecoming game.  Man, it was packed.  we're studying in the library right now, though he's gone back home to get his jacket.  Tonight, I'm going to the KSA banquet... there will be pre-frosh there. Doh.  Sigh. My time here at Hopkins is ticking away...

      The Hut. 3:45 AM.  I've been trying to do this homework for a couple of days now and I still haven't been able to get even the first one done.  Why didn't I go to TA session?  Arg.  Anyhow, it was fun an hour ago when Dustin Yoon and I engaged in a pen fight.  We both had an arsenal of about 10 pens... arming our fists with pens bristling, we duked it out.  I ended up victorious, but alas, I ended up accidentally stabbing Dustin... a little blood came out.  Pen fights... dangerous for the untrained.  Be wary my young grasshoppers, for it is an art yet to be tamed in all its fury.  Clearly, it is 3:45 AM.

      Small group today once again reminded me of how little my fear is of God, particularly of His wrath.  It's a humbling realization to see how little I really do believe in my heart what I know in my mind... it's even more humbling to see that it's largely due to my error in thinking that knowing spiritual truths is equal to knowing them genuinely in my heart.  How do I personally follow Christ?  Christian tag lines like "die to self every day" sound so convicting, but have you, have I, have we fallen into the trap of being content with just verbally repeating to ourselves?  Anyhow, us four guys in the small group have picked things to keep each other accountable until we meet on Wednesday morning at 7 AM.  Yogi will journal his quiet time every day, Scott will read The Two Towers, James will do his 15 page paper, and I will do my homework and not use my computer.  The problem with that last one is, I now have a real reason to open my computer that I had forgotten about when I made that pact:  there are a lot of emails with important dates that I have to write down on my calendar, and they're all saved on my computer.  DANGIT.  What do I do? This is important.  I have to write down my dates for my FAFSA appointment, lunch with professor, getting tickets for graduation, etc.  God, please, help me figure out a solution.  Supervised usage?

      I got back last night from the library at around 1:30, but I ended up sleeping at 4 AM.  Danny came over to finish coping my class notes, but I think the brunt of the time was spent talking with Jimmy about life these days.  Ah. Life these days.  Well, I got up this morning at 8 and hauled my butt over to prayer meeting.  Prayer meeting was good, we covered a lot of topics and we got to share (well, at least Scott, James Lieu, and I shared) about what were going through afterwards.  When I got back I found that my old roommate John Yoon left a funny message on the machine.  I'd tell you what it was, but you wouldn't really get it unless you knew him.  As Jimmy Choi fondly states, John Yoon is... the Golden Boy.  Anyhow, I will probably be working my butt off today.  James Lieu was just standing here with me in the library as I type this... we just thought up of a plan for his website dedicated to his enormous shoe collection.  We're thinking of calling it... "Lieu's Shoes."  Heh heh.  I'm typing this entry and probably will be doing so for the next couple within the library because I've unplugged my computer at home once again.  I've actually been able to get studying done... hoorah.  Jane Choi, if you're reading this, drink a lot of water and go to sleep.  All that blood gone means no fun, eh?  (For the rest of you reading this entry, click her link on my link section to read about her recent entry about being tired out from blood donation.)  Ok. Eat? Study?  Dangit. Study.

      The weirdest thing happened today.  At about 10:40 PM, as I was studying at M-level, I noticed a box being lowered into the glass-enclosed statue courtyard resides in the middle of M-level (see the pictures from April 4 for a better understanding of what I'm talking about).  Turns out, it was full of 5 chickens, one of which went out and started hunting around for food.  Crazy.  I wonder who thought of this... pretty funny, I'd say.  It's caused a major distraction; it's now 10:50 and people are still sauntering over to watch them poke around.  What is the significance of 10:40?  If you've never been at my aprtment before, our clock in the living room is stuck on 10:40.  Conicidence? Is 10:40 the twighlight zone?  *squawk*

      The weather has been incredible for the past couple of days in this usually gloomy city...  Yay.   Anyhow, today I had an uncomfortable situation during my group meeting.  I should have been more tactful about the way I did it, but I shot down a group member's idea for our robot and he didn't take it too well.  We ended up arguing about it for about 20 minutes as our 2 members uncomfortably sat working on their own parts of the project.  Naturally, the rest of the time was shrowded with the cloud of tension and I think we were all glad to disband.  During the last part of the meeting, I kept praying for Christ to just take control of my emotions and actions; I don't know if it was visibly so, but my hands were shaking.  That usually happens when I'm placed on the spot; my body gets jittery, my mind shuts down, and I start to stammer.  Explains why I've always had trouble with public speaking, etc.  But anyhow, today's episode was an immediate reminder of my sinful condition... just after my study today on justification.  I was listening to "So We Come" by Jimmy Choi and the words rang true with the study on Romans 1:16-17... We come and worship only by the grace given to us by God, only with Righteousness won by Christ.  To see my instant propensity to sin puts me to shame...  It's interesting how quick God can be in teaching the heart what is known in the mind.  If only our hearts are as quick in learning...  Anyhow, I'm about to find out about my U Penn app.  I called them up and they said they'd call me in 10 minutes.  As well, Rena stopped by with her sister who's visiting, which was cool.   John Kim and John Yoon, my old roommates, are down here as well for the week... it's weird to see them back, but in a good way.  I miss those guys... it'll be like Ivy 300 in the olden days.

      Have you ever done 3 loads of laundry with 2 available sets of washers/dryers?  It took me four hours to get it all done.  Today was awesome... Danny came over for lunch, and we again went to get food from the Philipino Phenom. I'm telling you, she was in high, phenomenal form today... she realized that we were splitting a sandwich since Danny had no cash, so she made one for him on the side, no charge.  Phenomenal, I tell you.  Anyhow, today was a good day.  I gave Scott dinner, and we went out for dessert... majorly got ripped off for the ice cream we got, but it was a good time.  We had a really good talk about church and I really am thankful to God that He initiated and carried it through.  Who are you? Do you know whom you really are?  That question lingers in my mind a lot.  Does it bother you? If you don't think about it, maybe you should.  It's interesting... the concept of finding one's identity in Christ. I forget a lot about my identity in Christ... evidently, I don't spend nearly enough time as I should exploring it.  It's about high time that I do.   What about you?

      After class, I practiced scales for an hour... MAN I stink.  I guess that's why I need to practice.  Jimmy Choi came in later and decided to do another take of an instrumental he recorded on my computer before... thanks to the Live Drive you all got me, it sounded phenomenal.  We ate at Egyptian pizza (mmmmm) with Paul Han in tow... it was a great night of food, fellowship, and conversation.  I got to ride, once again, in Jimmy's souped up Integra on the way there... quite a ride, I tell ya.  Yeah.  What a night.  But I must sleep.  Tomorrow is a lonnng day, and I've done nothing for the past 3 hours but bum.  Ok. later.

      Man. Only 4 hours of sleep today.  I was up late doing a lab... that didn't get done before I slept @ 5 AM.  I got up at around 9:20 and did a rush job to finish it, but definitely, it was not a good quality report.  Anyhow, when I came back from the apartment, Jimmy Choi and Jimmy Su went at it again.  I had to get out of the living room fast, because they were being too... friendly.  Whenever I hear them say, "Tim, we thought we'd get you...", I shudder.  *shudder*

      Church was cool today.  Today's speaker was a 4th generation Chinese American professor (soon to be) at Reformed theological seminary, very young, very smart, very eloquent.  He spoke about the Bible being God's redemptive story, about the hope we have in it.  Something to ponder upon once again.  Afterwards, we had a church picnic... it was really fun, and I got to hang out with the deacons, the UMAB people, etc... which is really hard to do, since everyone's so busy. A great time of burgers, sun, sports, etc... yay.  Just now, I've added comments to last Thursday's photo journal.  Hope you like!

      Today I visited Rutgers.  It was cool. First, I took the bus to NY; my dad picked me up from there.  As we were driving through the city to get out, I noticed something funny.  There was this one street with official city parking signs that said:  Don't Even THINK Of Parking Here  Ahh... some good ol' NY attitude. The best thing was that a big van was parked right under one of them... heh heh.  Rutgers trip was good.  I thought the projects there were interesting, they'd pay for my tuition plus a stipend, my brother lives right across the street from campus, and the professors seemed to be really open and to have a desire to create a good working atmosphere.  Long sentence, sorry, but yeah, it seemed to be a good visit.  I got to spend time with my father, and had some good sleep/reading/thinking/praying time on the bus rides to and back.  Ok, I must go study now.

      Add!ct!0n t0 th3 !nt3rn3t?  !n4mat!0n 0v3rfl0w.  50met!m35 !t c0mes to a sh0ck to me the extent that !'ve become addicted to the computer and the !nternet.  Ever since our family f!rst got a computer right before ! entered 9th grade, I've been glued to a computer screen.  At first, it was video games.  I installed X-Wing and then Tie-Fighter, then Doom came around.  Towards the latter part of 9th grade came the adv3nt of A0L... I must have used up 5 different free trials for the next couple of months, for each of the five credit cards my mom had.  My friend at church Abe and I would go into chat rooms and meet all sorts of weird people.  Throughout junior year, I would stay up late nights downloading video games...  ! was h00k3d.  Since then, I've not known life without a computer, besides some trips to places that I wouldn't have acces to one.  I didn't necessary go through any withdrawal symptoms... but nowadays, I do.  I just find myself "HAVING" to check my email, or making up excuses to go on the internet.  Sometimes I just open up the web browser for no reason other than force of habit.  I'm always onlin3.  I have gigabytes of mp3s and movie files on my hard drives.  I am the poster child of !nf0rmat!0n 0v3rfl0w.  I seriously think it's one of the root causes of my poor grades in the latter years of high school and all throughout college.  I've noticed a serious deficit in my attention span since I got the computer, and it's not just because I'm getting older...  How can I remedy this?  I really don't know how I can.  One can't really survive in this world these days without an email address, without word processing, etc.... at least, in the engineering academic world into which I'm about to dive.  The computer has become an indispensable tool of productivity in the modern age... but has it also become the centerpiece, an idol of beige plastic and glassbowl face?  God, how do I overcome a habit that is almost 8 years in the making?  Anyhow, I have to go to sleep since I'm getting up at 5:30 AM to catch the 6:30 AM shuttle to peabody, to catch the 7:30 AM bus to NY.    Lord, I just blew my night preparing for this trip and worship this weekend.  Where's the discipline in my life?  Why did I end up spending so much time on the computer.... yet again? God, am I starting to slide down the hill again?

      ARG.  I'm planning my trip to Rutgers tomorrow, and it's complicated.  I have to take a shuttle to Peabody, walk to the Greyhound, take bus to NY, walk to Penn Station, take the train down to New Brunswick, take the Rutgers shuttle to the professor's building, take it back, take train back, walk back to Port Authority, take bus back to Baltimore, hopefully get picked up by someone.  Some steps in there may be eliminated if my dad picks me up at NY...  but it's still a big hassle.  This trip is going to cost time, money, energy, etc... God, why am I even going? Just so that I can know what Rutgers is going to offer?  Oh well.

      Slightly tired and in pressure to get all my work done. The feeling of hopelessness keeps creeping in, to which I respond with apathy and laziness.  Learning how to fight all this is no easy task, but I know that I must, for in the end I'm guaranteed victory, right?  Christ, continue to teach me what it means to truly believe that I'm Justified.

      Today I spent the afternoon and evening at MSE (where I'm currently typing).  Edmund's been here all day studying for a med school exam... it's been crazy.  Danny, Edmund, Jimmy, Paul, and I have been pulling practical jokes on each other all day.  Danny and I started it off by inverting Edmund's bookbag and leaving "You're a Dork" emblazoned on the screen of his laptop.  Later that day, I found that Edmund had inverted my bag, and when I came back later again, I found he had stacked up all my books and notes into a 1.5' high tower. Later, he, Jimmy, and Paul inverted my bag and filled it with packing styrofoam peanuts.  There's more, but I'm too tired to type it out. I give Edmund all these free meals, and look what I get in return.  The games have just begun. Just wait and see what I'll do next.

      Last night, I went back home to take a nap... and missed my lab.  That means I'll get 50% taken off.  The "nap" lasted till 9... after eating and checking email, I went to the library and studied, then went to HAC and picked out the setlist for Friday night.  Man, this semester is getting worse and worse. I'm really frustrated with how things have been turning out, especially since it's my fault and I have no valid excuse.  If I can't be good and faithful to things like this, what would happen in real life? if I had a family?  God, please teach me how to understand Justification; if my life doesn't show that I'm being a good steward, how can I know then that I'm under Grace?

      Class was a very tiring ordeal today; I feel very sick right now.  Yesterday I was counseling a prefrosh about how I've dealt with pressure in college, and how the Gospel really is the only solid reference point to return to... it's interesting how right away I'm being tested to see how well I know what I've shared.  It never seems like I really live out what I share... but God, I know that You're keeping me accountable to what I say.  It's just not always easy, that's all, but You surely have it all in Your Will, right?  I'm going to go home from the library now to take a nap.  Tonight, I hope to simply be faithful to all my responsibilities...

      I fell asleep, got up (somehow) at around 9:30, and called both UPenn and Rutgers.  UPenn's not giving any money, because the program they admitted me into was the "professional career" kinda track.  Dangit.  I'll be going up on Thursday to Rutgers essentially to interview with the professor that is interested in me... he said that he couldn't tell what I wanted to do from my application (as did every other school) so again, I'm reminded of how poorly it was done.  Oh well. I got acceptances of any sort regardless of my shortcomings, totally and solely by Grace. What now? I'm extremely weary due to the lack of sleep today.  I read up on UPenn's program... I wasn't really that impressed simply because it's the same exact thing that I've gone through already here as a BME undergrad; granted, maybe a little more indepth, but not really substantially different than what I've done so far. But no money??  Good news, though, Hopkins is giving me another week to decide since both Penn and Rutgers were so late in sending me their letters... phew.  Some breathing room... sorta.  I have a TON of work to do this week... no socializing or fun for me.  That's good.  There's always a time for concentrated effort, right?

      Sunday already. The KSA banquet was held at a bar/club area within the Ravens Stadium, so we got to hang out in the stadium.  Personally, hanging out in the stadium itself was the highlight of my evening, because I really wasn't in the mood for a banquet/dance sort of thing.  I felt really bad and selfish that I wasn't, because a lot of people I knew put much time and heart into it; you all did a great job, and I tip my hat and apologize for my party-pooper attitude.  There was a lot going on in my mind... grad school, the end of my college years, overdue hw assignments, upcoming hw assignments, seeing all the freshman and pre-frosh there, and seeing the scant number of people my year there (only a couple) also added to the glumness of the evening... For a few moments of time that night, when I was either staring out the windows at the passing cars on the highway, or enjoying the quiet, grand solitude of the empty stadium, I was able to escape and think about nothing.  The rest of the time, it was hard for me to smile and enjoy things... making a fool out of myself at one point didn't help either.  Jenny Hwang had brought a mutual high school friend, and introduced me to her.  In response, I crinkled up my face really weirdly and I think they took it the wrong way, because instantly they just turned off and away from me.  I tried to ask what Jenny was doing next year, but got curt responses, and when I turned to go to my table, there was no friendly acknowledgement upon their part. Dangit.  The Jenny episode was another reminder that I have issues with dealing with my emotions.  Will I ever learn?  When I left, Vicky had left a message on the answering machine, so I returned the call.  It was cool, we caught up on things; she got into Fuller @ CA, so she'll be going there for the next cuppa years.  After talking to my dad about grad school stuff, I read Ecclesiastes and went to bed, but I couldn't sleep.  I borrowed Jimmy's guitar and played out what I was feeling -- melancholy, sadness, etc.  Church today was still under the shadow of those feelings... aptly, the message today was about God, the Lord of Peace, and I think it's something I needed to hear, but it's still lingering.  I guess I'll have to fight for the rest of this week...  Ok, it's time to study.  See you all later.

      As soon as I woke up yesterday morning I went to lunch with Dr. Okamura.  We ate at Gertrude's, the restaurant at the Baltimore Museum of Art.  It was ok, I got a salmon steak with slasa fresca and garlic spinach.  I decided to go for healthy, eh?  I then spent all afternoon at the digital media center working on my intermedia studio project... kinda tiring.  After preparing for Friday, I tried to get at least some of my Dynamic Systems homework done, but it's just a lost cause... I'm going to get such a bad grade in this class.... arg.  Friday night was cool, Deacon David Lee spoke on dating. Shrek (Eric Ahn) was especially attentive, which I found to be quite amusing.  It was really cool to hear about Dave's experiences with his wife Susan... how they met, how he asked her out, married life, etc.  We then hung out afterwards, until worship practice started at 9:30. It was tonight because a Korean praise ministry from Texas called "Singspiration" is rehearsing all day and performing in the evening.  Today, I get to help set up the stage and sound for the Roots Concert... I'm excited.  Something interesting for you Wellesley peeps... I was talking with one of the sound guys, and he was telling me how it was the same production company as the one producing the Sugar Ray/MagCho concert at Wellesley today.  Cool, huh?  Later today I'll go back to watch the sound check, then get dinner, then go to the show...  hot hot myoozik... the hot myoozik!  Another cool thing, my mom got back from Korea yesterday, quite safely, I might add. She went to pitch a book she wrote to publishers, and to meet up with old friends.  Seems like she had a good time.  This Sunday is my parents' 29th wedding anniversary.  CRAZY! I can't believe it's already almost been thirty years for them... over half of their lives spent with each other.  Wow.  From reading his posts, Jacob's been having weird dreams lately, and it made me realize... I haven't really had any vivid dreams in a very long time.  Why is that?  Maybe it's lack of sleep?  I don't know.

      Right after the last post, I studied for about half an hour... and nodded off, though I was fighting not to. I guess I didn't fight hard enough, since I got up 2 hours later.  I don't get it... why was I so tired?  I think I've been malnourished... I've been eating very poorly the last couple of days.  But, God provides...  After studying till about 1, I went upstairs and ran into Sukyeon (now Nathan, since he just got his citizenship)... next thing I know, we're in his car on the way to U Jung for a laaate dinner. It was good, I haven't had some good healthy Korean food in a while.  Bist.  So, here I am at HAC, about to resume my homework.  It's 3 AM. Yay.

      Praying over the past few days, an interesting memory hit me.  At a pre-frosh picnic 2 Sundays ago, I was giving advice to this high school senior about dealing with guilt and failure by learning how to preach the Gospel to oneself, and how to explore it in its objective truth.  Little did I know that I was about to plunge into another pit of guilt and of depression.  It's funny how whenever I give advice, I find it immediately being put to the test in my personal life... God, you sure keep your children accountable.  Now that I'm in the Rutgers program, I should feel a little more secure about my future, but I don't.  But, I know that I have to learn how to fight my emotions, to be more steeled in my will... it's shaming to admit that I'm a passive person, but what does the Gospel say?  Shall I fear my emotions? Shall I fear my faults in character?  Shall I fear condemnation? Or, shall I fear the God that forgives? the God that saves? the God that empowers? the God that loves?  Whom shall I fear?

      Today I will attend the meeting for the Roots Concert setup crew.  Woohoo!  That means:  1 Free ticket into the show. I get to listen to the Roots sound check. Preferred 'standing room' during the show.  Awwz yeah.  But in the meantime, I must study my butt off.  There's a lot of work to be done and not much time to do it.  Today I had a good study on the first 8 verses of Romans 6.

      Last night I finished the bible study chapter for this morning's small group. It was pretty fitting for what I've been going through recently (see below);  I think one of the best suggestions it had was to go through Romans 6.  Understanding that one is forgiven for sins is one thing... living life in freedom from sin's grasp is another.  I know there's a lot of things that I have problems with, but God's surely working on them.  One thing I noticed that I have to deal with is to cut off my over-dependence upon relationships for emotional support.  It doesn't mean that I want to be a loner now, but God's been showing me how I tend to go to people first with my problems or if I'm feeling lonely, rather than spending time with Him first...  Anyhow, tonight is going to be a busy night of studying.  I'm skipping out on hanging out tonight with Jimmy Su, G, and Jolene at Joe's Crab Shack down at Gaithersburg, MD, in order to get work done.  I have a feeling that Jimmy's not too happy about that... "you better get work done within those 3-4 hours."  He meant it. Sorry Jimmy.  I guess I have have to suck up the consequences for my procastination.  Spring Fair's this weekend, and I may not really go there to have fun... yeah yeah, it's my senior year, but I am so back logged with work that I need all the time I can get to catch up.  I've been waiting for this Saturday's Roots Concert all year, but I may not even end up going...  God, am I just looking at my situation in the wrong light? Am I dealing with things in the wrong way? Give me a better perspective on this...

      What do you do when it feels like your entire consciousness is within the confines of a relentless vise, restricting you from performing any constructive duty?  Do you pray? Do you sleep?  Every time I sit down to do homework for the past couple of weeks, that's my experience.  I've prayed.  I've tried to preach the Gospel to myself.  I've proclaimed the Truth of Christ's Sovereignty.  Why is my heart and my mind so slow on the uptake? Why can't I get it? It's a frustrating cycle: I try to do work, get distracted or can't sit still, I end up not getting assignments done, I get frustrated, I try to do work, my frustration distracts me, I can't do the backed up work on top of the current assignment.  Once again, I've shut off my computer at home to keep myself from wasting time at home.  Once again, I've been trying to limit social outings for the week so that I can focus on studying.  Once again, I end up moping around the library instead of fighting my emotions.  It's times like now that show me how weak I can be.  It's times like these that show me that I don't have any power within me to resist my body.  Then, God, where is Your Strength? Why am I still caught in this cycle?  Why is it still so difficult for my heart and soul to grasp and be motivated by Your Grace?

      What a weekend.  Yesterday I came back to my apartment at 3:40 to get a book , and ended up in Philadelphia 3 hours later.  That's right, Phily... Jimmy convinced me to go with him to support Adoremus at the UPenn Full Measure concert.  It was cool, I met up with some people that I had not seen since I moved from Philly. As well, I met this guy that went to my church waaaaaaaaay back in grade school. He was a lot taller than me, but he looks exactly as that same kid I remember playing with.  The concert was good! Good job FM.  Afterwards Jimmy Choi, Jimmy Su, Paul Han, Ajin Tae, and I ate cheese steaks at Pat's Steaks... so good.  We then headed back to Jimmy Choi's and slept over, then woke up and went straight back to good ol' Bawl'mo.  Wow, it's already been a full day since Jimmy and I left for Philly.  Time to really get cracking on assignments... later.

      I stayed up till 5:30 AM editing the concert audio.  It seemed like the minute I fell asleep, I had to wake up to go to church... I was falling asleep the whole day at church.  As soon as I got back at 1:00 PM, I conked out until Jimmy woke me up.  I'm not @ HAC to focus on doing work; I'm with Scott and James Lieu, we're keeping each other accountable to do our work.  So tired.  So tired.

      Such a long day.  Worship practice, then setup for Adoremus concert, then Adoremus concert, then cleanup, now editing the audio.  The recordings turned out really well... especially my favorite song of the evening, "Hallelujah."  Ok, back to work.

      Ok. I'm up late, but I still haven't touched my homework.  After the last entry, I went to the library to study, but after I got there, I realized that I had to do my laundry, so I figured I'd just study at home.  Big mistake.  I have done my laundry, but while waiting I worked on a drum loop for this weekend, talked for five minutes on AIM, hung out at Dan and Cyrus' place downstairs, read the paper, talked to Danny Dokko a little on the phone, and sat here reading up on others' pages and lives.  My time went to all of these things, and for the next half hour I'll be folding and putting away my laundry.  What should I have done tonight that would have been the most efficient with my time?  Probably this following blurb would have been ideal:  I should have gone straight home to do my laundry, and opened up my dynamics book and notes at my desk.  Afterwards I would have set my timer for 20 minutes for when I would have to go down to put the clothes into the dryer, and commenced studying.  For the next hour and half, I could have gotten cracking at this assignment.  Then, I'd get my laundry, fold it, study a little more, work on the drum loop a little, then sleep at around midnight.  That's what I am feeling my night should have been like.  Unfortunately, I ended up going for the immediate urge versus sticking to the long term necessity.  Well, that's already passed, and I live only one life... and that's by Grace alone.  God, keep me from being frustrated at my impulsive self, and grant me Your gift of enjoying this life you've given to the fullest.  Please, teach me, make me teachable, that I can be what You want me to be.

      Yay, Albert is now linked up.  Check his site out as well!  Today, after spending the afternoon programming and attending the exit interview for loans, I went to dinner @ Blimpies with Suk and Angela nuna.  It was fun!  Writing a paper afterwards with my Mechatronics was not.  A plus, though, in their lab (from which I'm typing at the moment) they have the largest mp3 collection known to man.  They have like 3 gigs, 648 files worth of U2 songs and videos alone... puts my paltry 1.5 gigs of U2 stuff to shame.  Paltry, I say.  Tonight I'll be up late doing homework...  Fun.

      I went to bed at ~1 last night.  I didn't sleep till ~3.  Why?  I went online, and I was trying to make a good drum loop for this weekend.  I think I annoyed the $*@! out of Edmund.  Sorry, Spesh.  Well, as a result of last night's stupid display of un-discipline, I woke up at 11.  DANGIT (a la Janet Lee)!  It's time to really get a move on today. No Instant Messenger, no compromise. I've compromised the past couple of days and all it's gotten me is a truckload of trouble.  And a teacup of sleep.

      Well, today I had my last class, and my mechatronics group successfully made it through all of our trial runs (if we messed up, we would have had points deducted). Yay! The project is done! Well, almost. There's still the write-up.  On the downside of today, I've had this really painful canker sore on the back left part of my tongue.  It makes everything taste bad, I guess the pain I experience associates itself and just ruins the experience of eating.  I took this test because I saw it on Amy Kim's site.  Ames, I got the exact same thing you did.    urlLink        urlLink which children's storybook character are you?   this quiz was made by  urlLink colleen    Tonight, I'll probably end up attending the rehearsal for the jazz band that will be performing for my Intermedia Studio project.  What's the project? We want to increase audience interaction with the musicians; ie, we want to explore different ways they can influence the musicians' emotions.  The audience has the opportunity to select and display a random picture to the musicians, and the musicians in turn respond to the picture.  I still have to finish writing the image selection program, hopefully it will work.  It has to work by this coming Tuesday, the night of the concert.  For those of you in Hopkins area, if you want to attend, we're the final act of the Computer Music Performances, Tuesday night, Griswold Hall in Peabody.  I've also been preparing for Worship Night on Saturday... i've been practicing this  urlLink intro  that I recorded last night..  Hope you like it.  As well, hope you can make it this weekend or on Tuesday.

      I got up at 6:30 today to go to 7 AM small group. I like small group, it's good to spend time with the guys, eat breakfast, share about what we've been going through... though, it always becomes a Yogi-counselling session by the end.  I don't know how he does it, but it seems every week he just ends up getting put on the spot.  Poor Yogi.  In half an hour, I'll be going to my very last lecture at Hopkins as an undergrad.  Hard to believe that what I came here for 4 years ago is about to end.

      Today has been the beginning of the end, the last Monday of class I'll have here at school.. unless I don't finish all my work.  This is just unbearable, I can't figure out why it's so hard for me to concentrate.  It's been over a month now that I've been having problems again.  Before that I think I was ok in terms of my school work.. in fact, I was really enjoying it.  Math is a real skill that one gets good at with enough practice and thought, just like any other art.  It's just viewed so negatively because people don't always see direct applications for it, but since I'm supposed to be an engineer, it's my job to apply it.  There are so many cool things you can do with math if you really know how to use it... in my class called Dynamic Systems, some applications include modelling car suspensions, understanding how speakers physically work, etc.  Enginerds, unite.  That's great and all, but these past few weeks has been an uphill battle to even get cracking at any of my work.  My homework assignments have not been getting completed—resulting in my slipping grades—so things just aren't going so happily.  After reading Joe Chen's posts, it looks like he and I have much in common.  Joe's a great guy, if you ever get a chance to meet him.   He's a second year med student at Pittsburgh; I know him because he went undergrad here.  He's 2 years above me. Check out his site, the link's to your right.  Later.

      10 years.  It's hard to believe that it's already been ten years since the L.A. Riots.  The media blitz is still a vivid memory; the grainy videos of Rodney King and burning stores, the stark brutality of rioters as they extracted Reginald Denny from his truck and proceeded to pummel him to the ground...  Afterwards, I recall In Living Color dealing with the issue with humor, with David Alan Grier (I think he was the one that did) posing as Rodney, and Jim Carrey as Reginald.  Isn't it interesting how the sometimes only thing people can do to cope with negative experiences is laugh at them?  About the concert yesterday.  Something that was running through my mind as I stood there, intensely enjoying the music.  I noticed, for example, this one black guy besides me—I'll call him "Snoop" because he reminded me of Snoop Dogg—really getting into the music.  Whenever Black Thought would rap a string of good lyrics, "Snoop" would get this esctatic grin on his face, close his eyes, cock his head down as he bobbed to the beat, and raise his hand in the air.  He'd then move his hand to the beat of the syllables, in order really get into their groove.  It looked like he was worshipping.  I looked around at all the people with huge smiles on their faces, throbbing to the tight beats, and hands raised up.  It looked like they were worshipping.  The similarity between them and people I've seen in worship was almost identical.  What were all of these people worshipping?  "I'm here 'cuz the Roots are awesome."  "The music is so great."  Everyone was there (including myself) to find pleasure in the music, in the emotions evoked by the music... Is it setl-worship? Is it worship of the music? of the Roots?  That made me think... how was my experience last night different from me going to Delirious concert, or when worship at church is simply really good?  Sometimes I think that I'm not really worshipping but simply getting lost in my emotions as an end for themselves, and that unsettles me.  But then again, one must cnosider, there is one difference... the Object, or the object that sparked the emotions.  God, You were so gracious to let me enjoy the fruits of the talents that You've gifted these incredible musicians with.  But God, why aren't they making You the object of their playing?  Last night, I got a glimpse of what it is within us that God is jealous for... our utmost enjoyment and attention, our sheer pleasure derived in exploring Him and seeing how Good He Is.  God, will you teach me more on worship? How to explore You? How to relish in and obey your Word? Will You bring me into a deeper level of intimacy with You than the one I currently have?  I've distracted myself this year with someone else, with music, with laziness, with the desires of my flesh...  but You've been stripping so much away this semester; is it so that I can turn to You?  God, in the Name of Christ alone I request, that You lead me to a more confident and obedient relationship with You...

      THE ROOTS ARE INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I just got back from the concert... man, what a day, what a night.  The sound check was AWESOME... the keyboardist would start a little melodic riff, the bassist would kick in, then skratch, "the human turntable", would start doing some crazy record noises and beat boxing.... seriously, i think he's better than Rahzel.  After they kicked us out from sound check, I went home and met up with Cyrus, Louis, and Tony.  We came back, and after waiting a while in line, we finally got in.  The opening act, "Cex", was a white guy who was a former Hopkins student (he would be a junior right now).  He had talent and he was putting everything into his act.... but.... it was not quite an enjoyable experience for me.  The crowd didn't seem to liike him either and kept booing him.  I felt really bad, I know it takes a lot of guts to get out in front of alot of people and perform, but still... he just didn't have that "it".  Give him a few years, and maybe he'll make it.  After he walked off, it took the band an hour to get onto stage.  Seriously, NOTHING was going on on the stage for over an hour, it was quite annoying.  But as soon as they came on... WOW.  They came on with all the lights out, and they started to hammer out a reallly solid beat.  The bassist (named Hub) was grinding out a pumping riff, the drummer (named ?uestlove) was workin' the bass drum, the keyboardist was hammering out this nice little riff, Skratch was goin' nuts, and Black Thought started to rap like none other.  WOW. They were just incredible for the whole concert. They had these impeccable stops and go's, coordinated dynamics, etc... when they were jamming, they broke into COUNTLESS numbers of covers, little snippets mixed in... ranging from Dave Matthews Band, Nirvana, Guns 'n Roses, Charlie Brown theme song, Super Freak, and a lot of rap stuff as well.  At the latter part of the concert, they showcased of the band members.  First up was the drummer, ?uestlove.  He has such a stripped down drum set-up, but he gets such crazy rhythms... so talented.  He started off with a nice solid beat, and by stopping the bass drum, snare, etc., he gradually stripped the elements of the beat until it was down to the hi-hat.  He then started to do this CRAZY syncopated rhythm on the hi-hat, played the rims and sides of the drums, and gradually worked across the set to the big tom.  At that point, the guitarist came up with a pair of sticks and started to play the snare; ?uestlove then got up, and they started to rotate in and out while keeping beat.  So cool.  The guitarist was up next, and started to do a slew of crazy stuff... jazz to metal to alternative... he broke into Dave Matthews' Crash, Nirvana's Smells like Teen Spirit, and when he started to play Guns 'n Roses' Welcome to the Jungle, the whole band joined in. It was so funny to hear Black Thought belt out like Axl Rose... he did a good job, I'd say.  The keyboardist was really funny, he was playing classical stuff, funky stuff, Charlie Brown, etc.. he did a lot of atmospheric, rhythmic grooves as well; crazy.  The bassist was awesome.  He eventually broke a string, but man, he kept it going strong... he was nuts.  Then.  Skratch.  INCREDIBLE.  He sounds just like a turntable scratching, and mixed in with his beatboxing... oh DEAR.  INSANE.  He'd similate scratching a record with his hand, and "scratch" along with it... then he'd break into a breakbeat.  All you a capella beatboxers should listen and learn.  Well.  I must say. What a night.  I'll write out my personal observations of the night later, in the philsophical evaluation realm.

      This post is my warning that I will not be posting till Monday.  I have insane amounts of work to do, so I'm cutting out many elements. This weekend is going to be killer.  Dynamic Systems Final, 9 AM Friday (my bane of the semester)  Partial Differential Equations Homework and Take Home Final, Monday  These are 2 of my hardest classes here... in terms of keeping interested and focused.  It's killer.  This weekend will also be the first Sunday that I'm going to be substitute worship-leading for Edmund at church.  Thanks for the advice, Jimmy.  By the way, Jyco, congrats on the cello jury.  I was going to ask about it yesterday but I forgot. Those bad memories of embarrassment were too much for my one-track-mind to handle.  Sorry, I guess I'm too self-centered, eh?

      I've liked U2 for a while.  I recently acquired some more material, and it reminded me why I like them.  I'm currently listening to "Bad", 2 different live versions of it (from "Wide Awake in America" and from "Rattle and Hum").  The first time I listened to this song, I didn't really think much of it, but it really grows on you.  Such is the case with everything U2... I didn't really notice/care for them at first, but the more you listen to their work, there's this certain quality and depth of musicality and meaning that starts to surface.  Many people get confused about them being a Christian band that sold out their beliefs 20 years ago, but that's not really the case.  I'd tell what I know about their whole story concerning that sort of topic, but it will take too long and I have to go study. What I will say is that although I've never met them and therefore never gotten to know them, after listening to their lyrics and reading myriads of interviews over the years it seems like they're not born again believers.  Bono emotionally and intellectually connects to the Bible, but it seems like he really loves the Bible more as a great literary classic.  He has stated over the years his belief in it and in the Holy Spirit and whatnot... but never have I seen any Bono or any of them publicy profess that they adhere to the Gospel... ie, that they're sinners in need of salvation, that Christ has redeemed them and called them by name, that they're now on the path of sanctification.  There's a book out by this Irish Presbyterian pastor, called "Walk On" in lieu of a song title from their recent album, that chronicles their "spiritual journey" over they years. I'm interested in reading it, to see if more light can be shed on the subject.  Regardless, from a secularly poetic and philosophical point of view, they are deep and they do have very meaningful things to say (namely, Bono since he writes most of the lyrics).  The song "Bad" was written out of the emotional stew of frustration, sympathy, and sorrow over a friend of his at the time that couldn't escape the clutches of heroine addiction.  You should listen to it, now that you know that tidbit of info; the song is definitely put into perspective.  Off to study.

      After church yesterday, I fell asleep, woke up, and worked on the program for Tuesday's performance.  The program I'm writing is made only using this Mac-only programming environment called MAX/MSP; it's used by artists and musicians to do basically anything you can possibly do with multimedia.  The reason I told you that will be evident later.  So, I handed in the laptop, thinking I'd be able to work on it the next day, Monday. Then, for the rest of the night I went to C-level in the library to study.  I was able to finish one problem, and one problem only... my concentration problem acted up again.  At one point, I almost broke down and cried, I was getting so frustrated.  I got up and walked between a pair stacks, away from everyone in the library.  As I sat on the footstool, I put my head down on one of the books, closed my eyes, and inside I cried many things, summed up as, "Why am I this way?"  Opening my eyes, I found my head resting on a book that was incidentally another textbook on my subject that I was studying.  Surprised, I took it back to my desk, and found it to be quite helpful for the first problem.  So, that's the only problem I was able to get done.  I cracked open my small group Bible study book, "This Great Salvation."  I opened to the last chapter of the book, entitled "The Fruits of Justification (II)",  and started to read.  It was based off of  urlLink Romans 8:14-23 , and many key points struck me, one of which I'll quote:  "Adoption touches a profound human need, a universal insecurity... the entire human race struggles under what a German philosopher of the twentieth century has called "angst," a nagging anxiety lurking just below the surface of the soul...  Salvation through Jesus Christ is the only answer to this fear.  'For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear,' wrote Paul, 'but you received the Spirit of sonship.  And by him we cry, 'Abba, Father...'"  Abba is the term used by children to address their fathers (very similar to Korean children's "ahp-bah") and it's a striking reality.  Since I've been justified with Christ, I've also been born again, adopted by God the Father.  Why do I constantly worry about my life, as if I'm not being taken cared of?  The rest of the night I was still haunted by the anguish I had from the realization of my failure to keep up in this class.  I left the library to find Danny Dokko at the Hut, so that he can offer some perspective on the homework, but he wasn't there. I'm glad he wasn't, because I needed some time alone with God.  I found an empty room in 2nd floor Shaffer, but it was too noisy outside—people were playing ultimate @ 1 AM in lower quad... weird—so I went up to the little hole called Shaffer 4th floor.  I didn't end up crying, but I found myself just calling out from the depths, "Abba... Abba... I just don't know how to live, I still don't understand why my heart is not understanding the Gospel..." And so I prayed about how I was really doing:  I still can't get over an attachment to someone that I tried to start a relationship with, frustration over last weekend's ordeal, frustration with my classes, frustration with my concentration problems, frustration with my wayward prioritizing...  I prayed for people that asked me to pray for them, then just lay there.  I didn't know what to do anymore.  So, I got up and went home to sleep, praying that I'd get up early to study.  Though I set my alarm clock to 8 AM, I snoozed it till 11:30 AM.  I washed up and went to the library to begin studying.  After I started, I realized that I had to go back home and take care of some errands;  as I was home, I talked to some people online as I typed up group evaluations for mechatronics.  Danny Dokko came over so that we could work on the lab together.  We ate lunch, stopped by the library to get my stuff, and went to HAC.  I was at HAC till 11:00 doing this lab.  I figured that I'd at least work an hour on the program for tomorrow's performance, so I went to the Digital Media Center since that's the only place that has Macintoshes with MAX/MSP installed, and they're open till midnight.  I got there to find the door locked and the lights off.  "For crying out loud, why do they close at 10 PM during finals?"  I got frustrated again, because they don't open till noon and I had no idea how I'd get this program done in time.  But then I started to think... why am I frustrated?  God's brought me to this circumstance... do I listen to my frustration over my expectations not being met, or do I listen to the Truth that God has brought me to this point for His own reason?  I calmed down and the frustration left me.  I printed out the lab I worked on at home, called security, and asked if they can open Latrobe for me so that I could turn it in.  I went.  I opened my bag.  I discovered that I forgot to bring the lab.  Instantly, frustration swept over me again.  I also got a 28/50 on my last homework, and that made me remember that since I didn't turn in Homeworks 8, 9, Lab 4, I have zeros in all of them.  How quickly I am to forget things that God tries to teach me... just 15 minutes before I was thinking about how I should be satisfied in whatever situation I find—or dug—myself into.  Well, this entry took a long time. Jimmy just got back from his job interview from Texas, and Danny Dokko just picked up notes. Another long day tomorrow. Maybe this time around I'll get up earlier.  God, please, let me get up earlier.

      Long weekend.  Senior night last Friday was memorable, though it was a little embarrassing to find that they had decided to make sure everyone in the church knew that I had worked in Chuck E. Cheese back in high school.  Practice for Saturday's worship night went till 2 AM that evening... oh man.  I then had to stay up later to work on a program; I fell asleep at around 6:30, only to be awakened at 10 by a phone call from my mom.  I'm sure some of you would find the following conversation funny:  "Tim, it's mom." "Hi mom.", then *snore* "Did I wake you up?" "....."  No, she didn't tell me that she was leaving, alright?  Sorry, inside joke.  Anyhow, I got up afterwards, washed up, and went to a jazz band practice with laptop in tow to rehearse for my upcoming intermedia project.  Yay, until I got there, and people were late. That's ok, I didn't mind them being late, but the rest of the band members decided to smoke it up with some mary jane to pass off the rest of the time.  At that point, I started notice my surroundings (they're art students) and happened to notice a bong sitting on the coffee table.  I was like, "uh... ok..." and left to get some Burger King with my group member.  Our conversation was pretty cool, I found out that he has brother that runs a theater in Seattle, and that he'll be going up to visit him.  Set-up for worship team was quite harrowing and stressful, especially since I brought my computer to record the night.  The loud songs didn't really turn out well since they were too loud... they ended up just being really distorted and bad and unhappy sounding.  I still have to cull through the rest, after finals are over, and see what is salvageable.  Everyone seemed to really be blessed by the worship night.  The Gospel was so explicitly stated and celebrated in every single element of the night...  As for me, the night left me a lot of things to think about.  I came into the night with a lot of baggage from the past couple weeks... and from the past semester and that made everything more difficult.  As well, as soon as the night started, my mind blanked out and I felt like I forgot how to play the bass.  When it came for the special praise, I forgot where all the chords were on the guitar, even though I had practiced it a lot.  Then, the recordings didn't turn out very well, and that left me in even more cross of a mood because a couple of people were stressed that I had to set up the recording equipment and computer.  By the time time it came to the message, I found myself not being in a very positive state, even though God really was blessing everything that was going on.  Adoremus was really on fire, the skit was meaningful, the body worships and dances done with full conviction.  Jimmy Choi, though, brought out a crucial point that I pondered upon for the rest of the night.  Since all of our worship is perfected through Christ the Intermediary, the Intercessor, the quality should not be determined by our feelings at the moment, the circumstances of the moment, etc.  Hm.  I didn't know how to respond with that.  The rest of the night I found myself in this state of flux and weariness from the lack of sleep and amount of activity done this past weekend.  Have I been serving God more than following and listening to Him?  Sometimes I think I mis out on what great things He's doing because I'm so set on performing things right...  I came into this school excited about what God wanted to do through me while I was here, and now I'm leaving thinking that I've tried to do too much  for  Him instead of simply listening, learning, and obeying.  Anyhow, afterwards everyone that presented that night (besides Adoremus) went to Nautilus Diner.  It was a fun time of fellowship and food, and I'm glad to have spent it there.  Jimmy Choi and I then came back to place, where he spent the night.  This morning had a melancholy note, since it was GyJu's (our keyboardist) last Sunday here.  The members of worship team that are staying decided to take this opportunity to say goodbye to us who are leaving.  Jane and GyJu are going back to Chicago, while I'll be shipping off back to New Jersey.  Professor Jeff Jue spoke again today at our church on our unity with Christ.  I was trying my hardest to stay awake—though I did drift off sometimes—because it was such a meaningful and deep message.  Unity with Christ, justification... do we really get it?  Are those Truths the foundation of our lives?  I'm left with a lot of things to think and meditate upon, this weekend, as I catch up for classes that I'm behind in and start studying for finals.  God, please, have mercy on a servant like me.

      Tonight, Jimmy and I went over to Yogi's to hang out with some Hope Chapel People again.  We watched "Not Another Teen Movie."  Shocked, confused, amused, and revolted, after the first half hour we couldn't take it anymore.  Unfortunately, we decided to watch "Mystery Men" instead.  I personally like the movie but it's a very subtle humor that many people (namely, girls) don't connect with... sortuva campy, dry, geeky humor.  So, after about halfway through we finally mustered the strength to eject it and put back in "Not Another Teen Movie."  The last half wasn't as raunchy, which was ok.  But overall, it was just plain bad.  I hope never to see it again, or any movie of such nature.  What's the "redeeming" quality?  That it made me laugh?  How can humor be a justifiable reason to watch it?  But alas.  My actions betray me. I watched and found it very funny at points

      Today I stubbed my toe in Jimmy's room. It left a big, bleeding gash... doh.  The funny thing was, I was on my way to get a bible commentary, and when it happened, I yelled, "AUgh! Dangit!"  Of course, James Lieu was over and all he heard was a thud and my yelp.  Stop laughing, buddy.

      God, please answer these questions.  Am I all wrong?  Why do I always feel so guilty?  Why do I always feel llike I'm not where I'm supposed to be?  What is this undercurrent of restlessness and discontent about myself?  And if the problem is that I'm too me-centered, how do I become genuinely God-centered?

      On romantic relationships, and to those like me who aren't in one.  A lot of theorizing and idealizing gets you no where if you're not building up whatever current relationships you are in, friendship or not.  God is soveriegn and will lead you into a relationship when He does.  If you're not in one now, stay content and continue to build up your skills in conflict resolution, communication, and generosity.  "Why is it that every girl I've been interested in has either not shared the same interest in me or not been interested in entering a relationship of any sort?  What is wrong with me?  Is it that I'm so immature, that I can't manage my time or prioritize wisely?  What is that overall unattractive quality about me?  Insecurity?"  Really, that's what I feel constantly, but I try to fight those feelings.  God's working on me, and He's guiding me... Those were all self-centered thoughts, and that's why they're not to be dwelt upon.  Every person and every couple is different.  We all come together in different ways, and that's why I think it's impossible to set generalize-able hardand fast rules of dating.  What matters is prayerfulness, honesty of character, and a God-ward focus in life.  If you really practice those things,  the Holy Spirit's wisdom will guide you fully and sufficiently to deal with any feelings you have with someone.  Lord, help me to deal with these feelings that still rage so strongly with in me.  Give your wisdom, Lord... give me your peace...

      The last post is long.  You don't have to read it.  It is more for me than for you.  And so arise questions about this online journal.  Is this journal a nexus of narcissism?  Is it a celebration of self?  Honestly, I am not sure.  I do know that people who read this site read it to catch up on me, to see what I'm going through... and for those of you that do, thanks a lot.  That means a lot ot me.  However, to be honest, I started to write in this page because I really wanted to keep a journal.  I didn't develop this site out of the recent fad of weblogging, because I've intended and actually tried to start something like this ever since freshman year of college.  Again, more problems arise... what happens to my privacy?  What happens to my inhibitions and fears of losing who I am if people read my innermost thoughts and experiences...?  I really don't know the answers to these questions.

      A lot has happened in the past two days, but I will write about 2 things: the opening midnight viewing of Star Wars, and the long karaoke run with Hope Chapel.  5/15/2002  I was actually reluctant when friend of mine asked me to go see Star Wars.  People like Jyco expressed concern for me because I am usually an avid fan.  No, I wasn't ill, and I wasn't in a bad mood. It just didn't excite me anymore.  I was busy doing laundry and starting my packing process, and I thought it'd be good to have some conencentrated solitude with God.  But, I decided to go.  We got to the theater at around 8:30.  That was the earliest I've ever been to a movie theater to wait in line, and I'm hoping that I will never again resort to doing so.  Besides Cyrus & Daniel, only a few other college students and a bearded, potbellied, Star Wars-shirt-wearing thirtysomething stood in line.  Conversation was sparse.  The employees let us into the theater at 9:00.  After we saved our seats, some of us sat in the brighter lit areas to read.  I found it a difficult to concentrate because of the atmosphere, so I started to convrse with others in our group. Surprisingly, people didn't begin to trickle in until around 10:15.  The first and only group of costumed fans didn't even enter until 10:30. Nonetheless, by 11 pm the main part of the theater was reasonably filled, and the room was abuzz with impatient chatter.  Even though the theater had 4 screens showing the movie, I'd have to admit that there were a lot of people in ours...  this movie was big.  As for the movie itself, I'd have to say that it was the stuff that Star Wars fans dream of.  I won't give any spoilers, but it definitely had a lot of subtle hints and nuances that only a Star Wars nerd like I could appreciate.  In no way do I say this in an elite-ist manner; au contrair, it shows how much time I spent watching the movies, reading the books, etc. It was a very fun movie, and I liked it a lot more than the Phantom Menace.  However, once again my fears were confirmed.  If you've seen Star Wars and Episode One and compare them to the Empire Strikes Bad and The Return of the Jedi, you will notice a slight difference in the levels of acting.  Namely, the first two mentioned had the worse line readings and direction... and, they were the ones directed by Lucas himself.  Well, walking into this movie, I feared that the same problem would plague this movie, and it did.  Lucas is a genius in filmmaking but definitely not in directing people.  It wasn't bad enough to take way the joy from the movie, though.  It was fun and it definitely had its moments, I'd have to admit.  5/16/2002  Tonight Hope Chapel people rented out two karaoke rooms.  The horror, the hilarity... the horror.  As my first evening of karaoke dragged on, I tried to enjoy myself by singing some songs I knew.  To some degree, I did have some fun, but something kept bothering me.  Some of the songs we sang were of such deep meaning and whatnot, but they were being butchered and sung for shallow entertainment... and I think it really took away from the songs.  For example, singing "Zombie" by The Cranberries did NOT work... lyrics wailing anger concerning the violence in Ireland did not fit the atmosphere at all.  The only thing that made the night redeemable was James Lieu's R&B skills... he sure made the night fun.  I have a lot to say about the subject, but I'm too tired.

      Brief Rundown of the day: Best Buy/CompUSA/Guitar Center. Errands. Cleaned Room. Yogi's Potluck. Watched Spiderman.  Hey, please read Jacob Lee's Blogs.  They're really good.  Sometimes it scares me about how similarly we think... we've been comparing ourselves to each other since I first met him.  Yes. Mystery in a relationship... that's key.  Do you know why? Think about it... the most important Relationship we can have will always be filled with mystery.  Why else would we have to spend eternity to explore God in all His riches and splendors?  Why else is His supplying of Christ such a resonating Truth? Mystery causes us to desire, explore, create... it pushes us to live. Once we have this Relationship, it sets the tone for the rest of our relationships.  It teaches that God has that same mysterious relationship with all of His children, and that adds mystery to what is happening in their lives. I hope though, that you don't think I'm just extolling this mystic quality called mystery.  It's not a quality... if you want to know what mystery is, read Colossians.  The Mystery of Christ... something to ponder upon.  Note: this blog isn't really well thought out nor organized, please excuse me.  One point I just want to ultimately get out is that everything that's involved with knowing Christ is a mystery, and that's what makes knowing Him so exciting... because we can never fully know Him in all His sovereignty, but at the same time we can fully know Him to our current capacity.  And, that capacity will keep increasing to infinity...

      Wow.  I'm done.  8 semesters of college.  Ok, I didn't finish off so well.  I struggled to hand in homeworks... or even do them in time, and the final exam for Partial Differential Equations... horrible.  But, it's over. It's over.  8 semesters ago, I came bright-eyed, praying to God that He'd use me for His Purpose.  Wow.

      Today I ate with Edmund Moon at Blimpie's for lunch.  He's been studying daily for the med school board exams at my school's library... so much he has to do, so little time.  For the rest of the afternoon, I tried to get in touch with Rutgers BME to get more info about the summer, since they haven't sent anything. I'm a little miffed.  The thing is... NO ONE was answering their phones.  I called at 3 PM... wouldn't anyone be in?  The secretary? The professors? The chair?  Maybe it's due to Memorial Day weekend.  At any rate, I also applied to a temp agency.  In the meantime, I was talking to Amanda Severin from ATD, she's back home in PA.  As well, I was working on creating a composite self portrait using different snapshots I took of my face.  It took a while because my computer didn't have enough RAM to handle the huge amount of data, but it turned out pretty well.  Maybe I'll post different iterations of it, maybe I won't, we'll see.  Angela Chung asked me to move and store all of her things into my apartment, so I spent most of the evening doing that.  Afterwards, I cooked up some salmon for G.  She came and visited later that evening, which was cool.  G and I went down with her to walk her to her car, as well as wish her parents a safe flight.  The funniest thing happened... at the end of the conversation, Ange's dad turned to me and said, "You are a Good Looking Guy!"  I was stunned.   No , I thought,  this fine gentlematn besides me is the GLG...  If all of you don't know the significance of G, G is short for GLG, short for... Good Looking Guy, which is Derrick's nickname.   At any rate, I pointed to G and made the correction, to which Ange's dad declared, "Well, you are Good Looking Korean, and He is Good Looking Chinese!"  I had no idea what to say.  Afterwards, I gave Derrick a guitar lesson, then went to the Carlyle to spend some time with some Hope Chapel people.  I also hung out with some of my non-Christian friends, which was good... but man, by that time, I was so tired... it was like 12 and I was just worn out from the day, so I went back to Paul's place to get a ride home.  Suffice to say, I'm still here, we just ended up talking.  Man, I'm tired, but it's cool.  Good stuff shared and laughed about.

      This day went by really fast.  Parents came, we all got ready, went to the graduation tent, took pix along the way.  I lined up and then we walked to the tent with the processional march from the band playing.  After many formalities and speeches (Tom Brokaw's was quite excellent, I must say... such an eloquent guy.  Spoke about us being the generation to rise from the ashes of 9/11, just as all the war geeratoins did, etc...), Brokaw and Ripken got there honorary degrees.  After more formalities, we went up to get called.  After everything was over, we got our diplomas, then the madness of finding relatives and taking pictures began.  After all that, my family went to this new steakhouse called Chester's in Fell's Point... 20 ounce steaks for 15 bux, can't go wrong.  Mom and Dad went home.  During the day, Mom was constantly nagging about something... the topic changed, but it was always something coming out of her mouth.  She meant well, but man, it was really stressful.  I just got back from the midnight graduation party held at the Mattin Center, a set of school buildings near my place.  It was good to see a lot of people that I hadn't seen for a while... for example, one of my roommates for the first 2 months of freshman year, my freshman chem lab partner, and some other people I've randomly met in classes or through people over the years.  A lot went through my mind.  1:  Almost all of my asian christian friends were not there.  This observation made me wonder. Did they ignore that this was going on? was it deemed an "unholy" event? Or, which I most likely guess, it wasn't within their social interest since all of their friends are in their respective ministries?  That last thought made me slightly sad.  College fellowship was great the past four years, but I wonder if any of the asian christians I know made a real effort to build up relatoinships with non-asians, christians or not.  I wonder if it was even within their scope.  Then again, my observation is from my narrow scope as well, i recognize, but the fact still stands that I was the only asian christian not part of InterVarsity.  (To explain, IinterVarsity is usally associated with non-asian Christians, vice versa.. )  I wouldn't have thought much of that until I saw that non of the "cool" asians were there either.  Maybe it's a Korean thing, not necessarily associated with Korean christians  Well, you can draw your own conclusions.  I will try not to draw any of my own, lest I just end up being more judgemental than I already am... God, please, forgive me.  2.  I've built up relationships with such a wide variety of people... but really, I'm still not close with many.  I think I'm too self-absorbed of a person or something...  at least, lately.  God, you've been brining that to my attention a lot more, Strengthen my reslove to be more in tune with Your Heart for your people, instead of my heart for myself.  Anyhow, yeah.  I found myself drifting from different people group to different people group, and they all had their own little worlds... albeit, they were co-mingling, but yeah, still congregated in their own worlds.  Well, I'm not sure what I'm trying to communicate.  I guess one thing I'm trying to say is that it's good that fellowships within churches are good and strong, but it'd dangerous if their members aren't willing to go out "two by two" if you know what I mean.  Then again, it is a time consuming thing to do both, so I guess it's understandable. The other thing I'm trying to communicate is more of a confession towards my ineptitude in developing strong relationships with people...  My self-absorbed mindset can really take its toll, eh?  Ok.  Well.  That's not the end of all of what I'm thinking, but I'm tired and I must wake up early.  God bless.  Thanks, God, for letting me make it through.

      Today, after some quick shopping at SuperFresh, I spent the whole entire day cleaning and packing up my room.  So tired.  My older brother camed down after work, arriving at 10 PM.  My mom called and talked until 10:40... oh, it was a little tiring.  I was in a cranky mood from being so tired, and I didn't want to hear her talk about what she should bring, what we should eat, etc.  Afterwards, we went to eat at Rocky Run... man, I'm stuffed.  Ok, time to sleep. Big day tomorrow.

      After this past post, I went out to eat with my small group.  It was a good time of laughter and sharing, and I'm glad that we had that time.  Scott drove me home, and in that drive we had another good conversation.  Scott is the small group leader, and we've been friends since freshman year.  He's been one of the people here that has most challenged my faith and pushed me to be more authentic, more sincere in the faith.  Afterwards, I drove with Jimmy Su to pick up Jimmy Choi, who was down in Baltimore again to drop off his car.  A drunk driver rear-ended his car and totalled the back end of it.  Jimmy and Shirley, who was in the car with him at the moment, were alright though... thanks God.  We went straight to Geno's in South Philly and got cheesesteaks.  I dabbed on a little bit of hot sauce onto mine, and what a mistake that was.  The sauce wasn't even good, it just caused massive amounts of pain.  I teared up like crazy and it hurt just to eat the cheesesteak.  Let this experience warn the reader to never try the hot sauce at Geno's.  Jean Park, Jimmy's friend, was staying over that night because Jimmy had to drop her off at the airline shuttle.  She had to take the shuttle to the airline because its only terminal is in NYC.  It was a fun evening of watching "The Fast and the Furious," busting out guitars and singing, and just reminiscing about good times over the years.  After sleeping @ 7 AM, waking at 11 and washing up, we went to see Episode II.  It was my second time seeing it, so it was a little boring.  The fact that it didn't have much of a replay factor speaks for itself... sad.  Anyhow, we then dropped Jean off at the shuttle stop.  Jean was very cool, she had a good sense of humor, especially since it was mostly guy sorta humor.

      I have to be up in 5 hours for church.  Leading praise has come to be one of my biggest challenges.  I'm glad that leading worship has not... since it's not something I do, but something the Holy Spirit does.  I guess it's difficult to see, at least for me, how I can make it so that the praise team sorta becomes background and it's just a good time of concentrated worship.  God, have mercy on me, on us... Help me forget the distraction of my music and have it so ingrained that it's just an expression what I'm thinkingand feeling.  Personal preparation for praise time is something I always try to do ahead of time but always end up doing before I have to do it. Story of my life.

      What a day.  After waking up and reading, I went to Superfresh and took care of errands on campus.  These Rutgers people aren't ever getting back to me, and I will probably have to start making more phone calls, it's been a week and I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON FOR THIS SUMMER.  The rest of the afternoon I worked on the Adoremus concert video.  AFterwards, I cooked spghetti for Vicky and Sophia, the two La Crescenta/Canada, CA girls that go here.  Vicky and I have been good friends from literally the first week of orientation.  Sophia I met by moving her stuff in her freshman year.  Anyhow, yeah, so the sauce turned out to be just as I've always envisioned my sauce to be... heavily flavored, full bodied, sweet but not too sweet, slightly salty, tangy, etc.. it was great.  I really liked it.  I don't think I'd ever want to go back to tomoto paste, pre-made sauces again... this was too good to be true.  And I owe it all to foodnetwork.com for the suggestion of putting equal parts fresh italian parsley and basil.  Anyhow, afterwards, we sat for a bit to digest.. then we had Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake Ice Cream.  GREAT STUFF.  Since it was all, done, we walked out.  Sophia went back home, Vicky and I went to the DMC to check on the Adoremus video, which was done dubbing to tape.  I then started the DivX encoding process so more nerdy people can watch it on computers. :-)  Vicky and I went for a walk and talk around campus, just like we've always done, it was a good time of catching up, debating, sharing, etc.  No, we're not involved or anything, she's already taken.  No feelings shared, either, so don't get any ideas.  After that, I went to J-Loo's place to hang out.  Dustin asked me to fix their VCR.. after much fiddling around, I discovered that the fuse had blown, and they needed to replace it.  This discovery was after I had been fiddling around with it for a while, though... phew.  I've been back now for 2 hours.  I chatted on AIM with Jane Park, who's home forever now, never to return to Baw'lmer.  Hooray!  Ok, gonna go read then sleep. Good night, world.

      Well, I finished the editing and adding titles to the Adoremus video, but maaaannnn... the rendering is going to take a LONNNNG time.  I have a feeling that at the end, the harddrive is going to run out of space, as well...   Typical.  Well, I guess I might as well read in order to pass the time.

      Yesterday's pot roast turned out very well.  The meat was tender and juicy, the gravy just right, and the potatoes and carrots were nice and soft.  Khoi and I finished it off very quickly.  Well, we left some for Jimmy, who was at Yogi's playing video games.  How about that game yesterday.  The Kings have been doing a fantastic job at fighting off the Lakers, even if the Lakers have Kobe and Shaq.  On to game 6.  In the meanwhile, hopefully the Nets will beat the Celtics.  Sorry to all of my Wellesley readers who say nay, but my little brother is a big Nets fan, and I wouldn't want him to be heartbroken.  This is the farthest that the Nets have ever gone, ok?  Give them a break.  The Celtics already have some past championships under their belts... and you had Bird!  Be generous. :-D  I'm starting to give up on finding that job.  Well, it's time for me to wash up and go over to the DMC to work on the Adoremus video.  In other news, I am going to try to kick the IM habit, once again.  I was actually doing pretty well at points during the end of the semester, but in the last couple of weeks I've regressed.  Hopefully people will still know about my website.  Maybe I'll just leave up AIM just for the sole purpose of posting my profile up.  Ah, it's excuses like that that keep me online and addicted.  There's much better things to do with my time.

      I don't know why I'm always haunted by this feeling of hollow loneliness.  In the undercurrent of my consciousness, I'm always sensing it. What is this loneliness that lurks within the recesses of my heart?  And what do I do with it?  After I woke up today, I went to Gilman to check out this on-campus temp job bulletin board that Khoi told me about.  It actually wasn't advertising for temp jobs, so I went into the bookstore to read some stuff.

      Today was a long day.  I got up, went to Baja Fresh for lunch with Jimmy, Yogi, and Ajin, then Best Buy, Superfresh, and Ajin's place.  From there, The Udge, J-Loo, PHanzie, CJ, and I went to Jeff Tarr the opera singer's place for a Memorial Day cookout.  Those were some GOOOOD burgers and nachos... oh man.  We watched the Nets game, some baseball, the Stanley Cup playoffs, the last part of Meet the Parents, and this movie called "The Others."  Jeff Tarr was quite the comedian... he would scream at all these points to freak out Jung Yeon, the only present female.  It was quite humorous.  The movie itself was ok, thought it dragged sometimes.  Nicole Kidman did a pretty decent job, as well as those cute kids... they acted pretty well.  Ok, I had 3 burgers, and a ton of nachos.  Man, I really need to start exercising so that all these calories and all this protein will be put to good use.  Please be put to good use. Please.

      Responsibility.  Motiviation.  2 things that I've sorely been missing in my life for the past year.  Time is running out, it always feels.  What do I do now?  Do I walllow in self-pity?   Change and rejuvenation take commitment and determination, two things I sorely lack as a person.  God, what have I been living for? Fill me with a greater calling in life to hold on to, instead of this feelings-driven emotional rollercoaster I call life.  It's time for refocusing and action.

      I write this blog after 3 consecutive days of non-stop (virtually) data-entry into Excel for my temp job.  Let's just say that I really need this cash.  As well, I've learned a lot about car history just by punching all of this data in.  Trends, etc. etc.  I also listend to a ton of John Piper messages on my computer.  That guy is just so out of my league with his depth and breadth of spiritual insight into the word, into the glories of the Gospel, and man... I am just constantly blown away by what he has to say.  His messages have really changed my outlook on things since I first started to listen to him in the summer of 2000, when I first heard him at the One Day conference.  Wow, I'll be in Chicago for the first time in my life, all weekend starting tomorrow.  See you all later.

Hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to clear up the Rutgers situation.  One thing I've noticed recently is that I've not been doing my quiet times at all like the way that I used to, complete with journalling at all.  I'm starting to think that this online journal is not really doing a good job as a replacement for my old journal.  Well, I guess I should sleep soon.  Darn those Lakers, I wanted the Kings to win.  I'm fearing the fate of the Nets this week... how'll they ever shut Shaq and Kobe down?

      Today I finally got a temp job from a school... God surely has provided.  I've been getting having really annoying conversations with my mother lately... she really knows how to push the exact buttons to tick me off sometimes.  I must admit, there are problems in myself these days that I have realized only because of these unpleasant conversations with my mom.  For the past year, I've slipped into this state of unmotivation, where I've listened to my body, my emotions, and my whims, allowing them to control my actions and my life.  It hasn't been really happy, either, and I've been shirking a lot of responsibilities.  This is a little hard right now to describe, but it just feels like there's a vise tightening my chest every time I talk with my mother.  However, I think there's even a worse sort of vise tightening around my life, as I haven't really been passionately pursuing God... it's a worse because it's subtle in its lack of any negative sensation.  However, I find myself feeling hollow and listless all the time these days.  Things that used to excite me about God don't excite me as much anymore, and I find myself starting to delve into things that really don't please Him... things that cater to old sinful passions that I've struggled with for so long.  Jesus, please, rescue me from this body of death.  Anyhow, even better news.  Rutgers sent me information about the $20,000 in loans I will have if I go next year.  WHAT THE HECK? The BME Department said that they'd pay for my tuition... AND, they would pay me a stipend, but I've received -$40,000 from what they promised.  I don't get this.  But, God is good, and I know that He's doing this to get me off my lazy butt and start taking care of business that I should have taken care of a while ago, but was too lazy and unmotivated to do.  Once again, Jesus, transform me... thank you for doing all this to show me how.

      This is my first real journal entry in a while.  How did it become early Thursday evening already?  It still feels like I just got back from Chicago.  What've I done this week? I've cooked for people, I've read a very little bit (not nearly as much as I woudl have wanted), watched Rocky, Citizen Kane, and High Fidelity, chatted a bunch, hung out a little, played video games, and slept a lot as well.  Rocky.  I loved it for seeing parts of Philly that I recognize, the great acting, and the camera work.  It is definitely the best of the series, they should have just left it at the first one.  Citizen Kane.  It's always been curious to me as to how a movie should be picked to be the number one movie of an entire century, so I decided to see what the fuss is all about.  To be honest, I thought it would be a boring, stiff old movie, but what I got was a vibrant, fast-paced, complex drama.  I think I can see why critics would eat this movie up... good acting, well written script, revolutionary camera work and special effects (for the time... the special effects were good because you really don't notice them, so they really do succeed as special effects), etc.  It was a very deep and meaningful movie, and I'm still trying to piece together what it was trying to say about the heart and motivation of man.  High Fidelity.  I wouldn't have enjoyed nearly as much as I did, had I not visited Chicago this past week.  I recognized a lot of the sights and the feel of the city, so that was a big bonus.  The casting was really well done, especially the music store workers.  I wish the movie didn't discuss sex so blatantly as much, but I think it did work in a way.  The culminating marriage proposal speech by Cusak was very interesting, and I found myself relating to what he was saying.  Ok, that's all I'll say about those movies.

      Chicago was a blast. Wednesday I went downtown, Thursday was the bachelor's party @ Six Flags, Thursday was Adoremus rehearsal and dinner with everyone, Saturday was the wedding, and today was church and flying back home.  This is all I will write. Nice and boring, but I'm going to start focusing on writing in my journal again.  My real journal.

      After running errands today I ran into a guy I had a couple of classes with this past year.  Since niether of us had lunch, we decided to eat at Rocky Run.  It was a good lunch, and we had a good chance to catch up.  Afterwards, I prepared for worship practice, then went to Yogi's for dinner and to print out the song sheets.  From there, we all went to bible study at church; incidentally, my final Friday at Hope Chapel.  Afterwards, practice was a little rough... things weren't out the way I had hoped, and I started to get a little frustrated.  Man, I really think I should have prepared on Sunday... but oh well.  I'm now at Paul Han/Yogi's place watching the Korea/Spain game.  It's been a frustrating and intense ride... it's already overtime, and there have been many close calls so for.  Just now, Spain attempted to score but it bounced off of the goalpost... so insane.  Everyone here is going nuts.

      Well, I finally am back home in Baltimore after my trip to Austin with Jimmy.  We drove down in two days... it was a nice, long drove halfway across the country in a overloaded Camry.  1600+ miles of staring at the farmland that predominated the landscape for most of the trip.  The modern age of automobiles and planes enables us to go such great distances in such little time, it's a very jarring experience to travel sometimes.  We left 6 AM from Baltimore, and made it to the southern tip of Virginia by lunchtime.  We stopped at a Wendy's, only to be cheerfully greeted by a smiling, Caucasian teen with a southern accent.  It was quite strange.  By the time we made it to Memphis, Tennessee for dinner, the windshield and front was covered with the Tennessee bugs...  Tennesee has a LOT of insects flying around.  It was a little nasty.  Funny story:  We stayed at a Quality Inn in West Memphis, Arkansas, which was across the river from Memphis.  When Jimmy went in to check out a room, I noticed a swarm of insects congregated at all the lights.  When we parked, after I stepped out I noticed that there were bugs everywhere; crawling all over the door and the asphalt and flying all over the place.  Jimmy joked about the situation by saying, "Hey Tim, be sure not to open your mouth."  Of course, as soon he said it, I heard him yelp and gag as a bug flew into his mouth.  The irony, oh the irony.  We got a really nice room for $50, thanks to the AAA discount.  For those of you that have cars, it is highly recommended that you get a AAA membership... it really is a convenient service.  Maps, travel guides, and discounts and many participating hotels and restaurants all over the country.  Pretty cool.  ARkansas and Texas was all flat farmland.  There were times when it was very picturesque;  big bales of hay scattered across rolling green hills, grazing cattle, rows and rows of corn.  But then, when the scenery stayed the same, it got boring after a while.  Austin is a very interesting and fifferent city.  Everything in Texas is bigger and more spaced out... every highway has what you call "feeder roads," local roads with stores along both sides of the 8 lane automotive corridors.  The highways were also decorated by sculpted supports.  I also have never seen so many trucks and SUV's in my life... it was crazy.  Texas BBQ is so good.  REALLY good.  We went to "The Salt Lick,"  an all you can eat BBQ joint that's housed in a ranch in the southern outskirts of Austin.  Oh yeah. It was good.  Back to describing Austin.  I was expecting a normal city... but besides it's downtown, everything was spaced out all over the hilly terrain.  It didn't feel like it was a city at all... everything also looked nicer and newer.  There was a lot of construction going on.  Signs of a growing economy and industry, you know?  Ok. I sleep now.

      This is I was thinking about during church today:  I've been stuck in this emotional rollercoaster for this past year for too long.  To be honest, this ride has stunted my perceived spiritual maturity and growth.  I use the word "perceived" because ultimately it's God that only knows how much I've grown, but from what little I see, I see that I've regressed in my maturity and in the rapid period of growth I had over the years.  To explain, this emotional rollercoaster = struggling with my unrequited feelings for someone I was interested in all throughout college.  There's nothing wrong in that of itself.  It's perfectly understandable to me when a person doesn't share your feelings; the attraction simply isn't there.  That I understood in my mind, but I honestly didn't deal with my heart's attachment in as Godly a fashion as I thought I did.  Instead of responding to my feelings by dependence through prayer and personal Bible study,  I simply wallowed in them and let them guide my actions.  Over the course of the semester I noticed myself becoming less responsible with my schoolwork and job search, going online a lot more, daydreaming a lot more, generally wasting more time.  Ultimately I revived my old habit of nursing and responding only to my feelings.  So here I am. I'm broke, and I'm still struggling to sever this stupid attachment to this idol I've made of this person (it's not even this person, you know?).  Now that I'll be going home to NJ for good, new responsibilites await me.  I know that God has a heartfelt desire for me to enjoy Him and His gifts that He's given me, and I know that will come if I put my heart into serving my parents' church back home.  Although I still haven't fully prepared my heart for it, I know that obedience will be rewarded with His joy and blessings.  As for grad school, I know that I have to get myself into gear and into focus for my career and my academics.  All these extra responsibilities require so much more of my passion and my heart.  Up until this point, I haven't lived ambitiously.  God, grant me an ambition for Your name to be known, and to know you more intimately.  I'll be going to Texas this week to move Jimmy's stuff back with him.  Really, it's to spend time with one of my best brothers here at Hopkins.  This relationship has surely humbled me... he gives more to me than I've ever given to him.  If anything, our relationship has shown me how selfish and self-centered I am, and how gracious and Christ-like Jimmy can be in his heart for those around him.  God surely has been good.  I'm praying for maturity, for straightened priorities, for my life's passions to be awakened again to the important things to pursue and know:  loving God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and loving those He sends my way.

      Thank goodness I went to JHU.  I know med school students :-) Alberto the blob informed me that I had/have the summer flu.  Fever, chills, nausea, extreme fatigue, and dizziness.  It's going around... so be careful, all of you!  At least you'll know what it is when you get it.  "Handling the moment."  Successful people seem to be the ones that handle the moment very well. But, what is the meaning of success?

      I moved back today... on the trip home I got really sick.  Not sure why...  had the chills, nausea, extreme fatigue and dizziness.  You med students out there... what did I have?  The last time I had this was when I flew to Houston for missions.  That time was my first time on a plane... I was fine until the end of the flight, when I started to get really dizzy, tired, and nauseatic. (is that a word?)  This time around, it got realllly bad by the late afternoon.  So weird.  I'm feeling better now, after taking some Tylenol... but woah, I've never felt so sick in such a long while.

      Today, church people and friends took me out to Minato, a nice sushi place in Mount Vernon area in Baltimore.  It was really good, thanks everyone... not just for the food, but really for the memories and for the gesture of hospitality, it meant a lot to me.  The sushi was done really well, but the service wasn't so good. I guess it was because we had a big party, but I was a little mad that they took an hour and a half.. even 2 hours for my roommate to get his order. But that was ok... we all had a good time and good laughs.  Afterwards, I conked out at home, thanks to the glass of plum wine.  I've since been doing laundry and packing.  My last night here....

      "I think George was not comfortable with ACTORS. We were not chess pieces he could move around in his technical wizardry. Every day, before we shot a scene, the four of us would brainstorm to get to the subtextral content in the script , on film. We kept telling George this film will not work unless we are able to breath life into these characters. Unless an audience can connect with these life forms, who live in that real world, we would have nothing!! George wasn't too happy to have to deal with our ideas, but he came around."  Don Pedro Colley, actor from THX 1138, George Lucas' film debut.  From watching the recent installments of Star Wars, it seems like Lucas has learned little over the past 30 years about directing actors.

      Today: 1) What I did today.  2) Things I noticed.  1) So, during and after waking up and taking a shower, I spent my thoughts praying.  It was good to catch up on praying for people whom I'd promise to pray, for my church, and for other things.  After that, I did the final stage of cleaning the carpet: sprinkling the deodorant and vacuuming.  Afterwards, my brother and I went shopping again for the barbecue we had tonight.  We also got our cable receiver replaced because our old one was going haywire.  It was fun firing up the grill (actually, 2 small grills) with the charcoal, lighter fluid, etc.  We had hot dogs, barbecue chicken, mashed potatoes, "sahm gyup sahl" (thinly sliced pork belly) and sliced ribeye, chicken caesar salad, and almond tofu/fruit mix.  2) The new thing I encountered today was the multiple "Spanish" categories in the nearby Pathmark (a chain of supermarkets in NJ and PA area.)  It was strange... some aisles would list a couple of items, and then have "Spanish" displayed above.  I really didn't see much a difference in the aisles besides a couple of items, like maiz for tortillas in the flour section and a section devoted to Goya products.  (Does anyone remember the "Goya... oh boy-a!" commercials?)  I forgot how drivers in NJ are a lot worse than Baltimore drivers... they cut you off a lot more and they don't really obey traffic laws.  Be careful if you go through NJ... at least, the local roads.  I've become anti-social now.  It's just too draining now to put energy into forming new friendships and relationships.  What happened to me? When all of my brother's and roommates came over today, as well as throughout the week, I just smiled politely and then went back to doing whatever I was doing.  What a great impression I must be leaving on everyone.  What happened to the excited, social butterfly that I was during freshman and sophomore year?  So, that's what I've done and noticed today.

      I just tried to watch the recent, modernized version of Hamlet.  Too tired to watch something of this weight, so I stopped.  I guess I'll finish later.  So far, it's been interesting how they're doing all the scenes.  I like the staging, and the ideas of how they've modernized it... Denmark is a corporation in NY, Hamlet wears Oakley sunglasses and a ski cap, and Bill Murray, at times, worked well as Polonius.   I like what they did to it in terms of staging, but the acting and some of the delivered lines... were too awkward for some of the actors to pull off well.  Oh well.  I'll finish it tomorrow.

      What a long day.  Yesterday, I brought the carpet steamer back from home to clean the carpet in my brother's (ok, now mine as well) apartment.  It was really dirty and heavily stained, so I decided to do something about it.  I woke up, read the Word, and started to clean at around 12:30 PM.  I didn't know how powerful the detergent "Oxyclean" was, until I used it to spot clean the nasty stuff.  It tooke things out... perfectly. I was really surprised... the spots are totally gone.  Anyhow, afterwards I ran errands with my brother.  We went to Costco... and I'm surprised.  I have never seen so much liquor in my life.  Ros and stacks of beer cases and wine bottles and hard liquor... in Costco? Since when did Costco sell alcohol?  We ate White Castle....  I haven't had it in such a long while.  White Castle, if you've never heard of it, is a small fast food chain, but it's the original chain of restaurants that invented the concept of fast food.  Oh... they're so good, the tiny, ~2.5" X 2.5" square little burgers, with their onion-steamed beef patties, the american cheese, and soft buns... i can eat at least 10 of them at once if i wanted, but I settled for five.  But man. They are so good, I tell you.  We rented Shallow Hal, the recent Ethan Hawke version of Hamlet, and some anime.  I really liked Shallow Hal, because though I expected a silly and mindless movie, it actually was a really humbling thing to watch.  It revealed to me how I think a lot when it comes to girls... ok, so I can be very shallow at times. Ok, a lot more than I'm willing to admit.  Guys really do act more out of their hormones than they realize they do... a lot more than they'd like to admit.  But yeah, I think it's definitely a movie that guys should watch.  As well, Jack Black's a riot... he's such a funny actor.  I'm going to watch Hamlet now.  Let's see how good a job Ethan, Bill Murray, and other pop culture actors can hold up to Shakespeare.

      Today, after lunch my brother, my roommate, some of their friends and I went to see Men In Black 2.  Eh.  It was ok.  Just ok.  Will Smith wasn't as charismatic a screen presence; kinda lost that energy he had in the first one.  It was also a lot of rehashed jokes from the first.  Don't go see in theaters, just wait for rental.  Afterwards, my brother and I went home for dinner and to discuss church matters with my mom.  On the drive back to our apartment, we saw three separate fireworks shows from the highway. It's very calming to watch fireworks from afar, when you can't hear them... that combined with the hum of the highway made for a nice peaceful ride back.

      So NASTY!  We lost count after catching/swatting 30+ flies in the apartment.  Many were on the window, right behind the blinds... good thing I broke out the Hoover.  Man, those vacuums are powerhouses.  I was able to suck up a couple of flies in mid flight... heh, i felt like i was in a movie or something.  I still can't figure it out; we have AC, so none of the windows have been open.  I can't find any rotting food anywhere.  Where are they coming from?

      today was similar to yesterday.  woke up. spent time in 1 john.  did errands, watched tv, cooked & ate, watched more tv, more errands, and already it's ~10:00 PM.  I still haven't been able to start my job search yet, and it's already july.  how am i going to find a job quick?  temp?  i don't even have a car.  arg.  creation festival.  so, an interesting about it was, that friday I got to attend this outdoor youth worker q&a session with deliriou5.  I sat in front with my brother, taking pictures with his camera.  the funny thing is, it started to rain a little, so they all moved up in their chairs until they were about 2 feet away from us.  pretty cool.  very interesting questions asked and very well answered.  they played well that night... and with the added availability of the huge video screens, they incorporated some visual elements too.  very well rehearsed, i might say.  the one thing that i found strange all throughout the festival was that i was very disinterested and emotionally detached from everything going on...  I even tried to get into it at times, but it just didn't feel right.  one thought that kept coming through my mind was actually a struggle of mine that i've been dealing with since... oh... probably the middle of first semester senior year, last fall.  it's a little private, and i haven't told anyone what it is, but it's not been really good.  it's a feeling that i can't shake, and it has been sparking really bitter feelings.  God, i just can't get over this.  that compounded with the events of this past year, as well as graduating from college, has built up now and for the past half of the year i've found myself a lot more self-centered, unhappy, and not as passionate in my relationship with God.  I just want to handle this well.  how do i surrender all of this to christ?

      "We're gonna live forever!" - The Cross Movement @ Creation East Festival, last week.  So, last Tuesday night the youth group kids in my church slept over my home so that we'd leave early morning.for Creation.  Thus started the adventure that would last five days and four nights.  We left at around 7 in th morning.  I drove the minivan while my older brother drove the van.  When were pulling out of the street that I livedon, my mom relized that she forgot something, so I honked at my brother to wait up while we turned and went back. However, much to my annoyance, he decided to take off instead of waiting for us.  After we got onto the highway, I sped at an average of 80 mph in order to catch up, but to no avail.  It wasn't so safe, especially since I was driving a car full of people and luggage.  I made good time, though, and we had almost caught up to them when it happened.  We hit the Creation camper traffic at around 1:50... The line of cars stretched a couple miles long, so we parked every now and then to wait.  To be nice, we even let the kids in our car go out and play.  Boy, was that a big mistake.  One particular boy is a really athletic, but not so quick with his wits when it comes to being careful.  So, at one point, the line of cars moved forward a couple of yards, so we moved up a long.  to catch up, the kids that were outside ran along.  For the life of me, I can't understand why the aformentioned boy did this, but he decided to cross the rod between a couple of cars behind us.... without looking for oncoming traffic.  Yep, he ran straiight into a slowly moving van.  I watched it all happen in the corner of my eye through the rearview, and my heart stopped when I saw it happen.  The lady driving it screamed, "That boy just ran into my car!" and for the rest of the hour, kept saying how it was all my mom's fault for being irresponsible and how bad a person in charge she was.  Not nice, lady, not nice, even if you were right.  So, that put a dampener on the rest of the day.  The kid got wisked to the hospital with my mom to keep him company, and we got back into the long line of cars.  We didn't get into camp until 4:30..almost 3 hours after we had gotten there.  The worse part was, I was told to pick them up from the hospital during the opening act, a Cross Movement concert... and when I got to the hospital, it turns out that they had already gotten around from the Creation Festival people.  I was a little annoyed.  Just a little.  It was the Cross Movement!  But ah, God provides.  They came and did another concert a couple days later... and wow, they were awesome.  Not just because of their incredible skills, but they were the music group there that most clearly presented the Gospel, in its entirety, details included... So awesome.to see how they really strive to practice saturating every part of their lives and work with the Gospel.  Oh, and yeah... that quote above is from one of thier songs, and it's celebrating eternal life in Christ.  Yep... it'll be for they new album.  Can't wait!  Ok, I'll write more later.  I must sleep.

      I waited all night for my brother to go home, but he didn't get back till 10.  However, I had to drive his car while he drove his co-worker home in her car, since she was drunk up the wazoo.  What happened was, his office went out to eat, and during that time she drunk "a couple" of shots.  Well, to my brother's dismay, they carpool together, and she's the one that drove today.  Yeah.  Stinks.  So, we were supposed to go home tonight, but we didn't.  Oh well.  What'd I do all night?  Television hypnosis.  Dangit.

      Ok. Ok.  I admit, in some cases, it is a sane thing to represent such violence on film.  Think Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, etc... films that have violence to make a good point.  I think I refer more to the senseless, pointless violence in display.  No, it's not just a modern thing, I realize... people have loved senseless violence for ages (gladiatorial combat, etc.) but that still doesn't justify subjecting our minds to it now.  As Christians, shouldn't we be learning how to derive our joy from exploring the Lord?  But then again, it's difficult to do, and we're all lazy.  How do we consistently push ourselves to get past that point of laziness?  By Grace, by the prompting of the Holy Spirit, right?  Does anybody know any passages that pertain well to this subject?

      Last night I got hit by an overpowering wave of negative emotion.  This happens to me from time to time, and I have no idea why.  Previously during the day, I was praying and studying 1 John, as well as "Knowing God."  It's instances like that that really put to test what I learn in the Word...  So, in response to the emotions, I prayed my heart out.  I tried to recall to mind the full message of the Gospel, that I am free in Christ and He is greater than my feelings.  I picked up the guitar and made it a point to try to rejoice, as I wrote in the last post.  Thanks God.  Well, I wrote the last post during the commercial break from a 3-4 hour run of watching TV.  I was really tired and I wanted to relax, so I started to watch whatever was on cable... and of course you know, something is always on.  After an hour or two of surfing, I finally got to a showing of Mercury Rising.  I don't know why I watched the movie.  I don't know why I had to keep watching something.  As well, I was thinking about what I was studying, earlier that day, and so that's what made me really think about what I was doing.  Yet, after I typed the last entry, I kept watching.  Why did I find it entertaining?  Well, some of it took place at the Wrigley building and the bridge right next to it, in Chicago.  So, since I had just visted there a month ago, I find myself taking pleasure in recognizing where everything was taking place.  However, it was a really violent movie.  People got shot in the head, back, etc. I used to be desensitized to it, but recently, I've been determined to not be such anymore.  It just doesn't seem right that I'm entertained by watching the staging of murder.  Call me crazy, I know.  But, I'm starting to wonder... where is the sanity in taking pleasure of watching people kill each other?  Well, next thing I know, I'll be watching yet another violent movie after this. :-T  All I want to do is to start taking life more seriously, yet I don't want to lose the joy and fun of being and living as a child of God.  How can I explore the riches that He has in store for me in knowing Christ, and therefore knowing God?  This is what I've been reading and studying and meditating upon in 1 John.

      "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."  Matthew 6:33-34  Rejoice in the Lord always, I say again, rejoice.  What steals our joy in life?  Cheap entertainment.  Entertainment that promises instant gratification, but it leaves us feeling hollow and grasping for more.  All people seem to live for (me included) is to be entertained.  Real joy, where does it come from?

      How is it Thursday already?  So, my advisor is here at Rutgers, but he's at a meeting, so I STILL haven't been able to talk to him.  This stinks like rotten fruit.  Well, anyhow.  James Lieu, sorry I haven't replied to your email.  I'm trying to get my life together in this neck of the woods.  Ok, I guess as I'm sitting here in my potential research lab (SO NICE... brand new computers, and there's a set-up with high speed cameras, lights, and screens to do motion capture stuff!), I might as well do somethingn productive, like read "Knowing God." :-)  Oh, and the bible as well.

      I got my ID, my advisor hadn't come in yet, I started to study "Knowing God", and I did get to lift at the gym.  But, I spent more than an hour online.  Arg.  Good thing is, I got some good amount of practicing in for guitar.  Tried to work on major and natural minor scales, as well as 32nd note strumming... varied from 60 to 100 bpm.  32nd note is too hard.  How do I improve my coordination between both hands as I try to do 32nd note scales? It's still too sloppy.  Any tips, anyone?  After dinner and chatting with some people online, I went out to get some wings with my roommate Pete and his church friends.  Afterwards, we picked up a video at someone's place and now we're back here, since they want to watch it.  As for me, it's time to get ready to sleep... phew.  Ok. Night everyone.  God bless.

      Well, it's 11 AM and I'm pretty much done my morning routine.  Today, I hope to get my school ID, meet with my faculty advisor, go to the gym (if I get my ID), and start studying Knowing God.  What I hope not to do is spend more than an hour of watching cable, surfing the net, or chatting online.  I've done way too much of those three lately.  Life is too short to be wasted.  Yet, wasting life seems to be my best skill.

      Today I sure wasted a lot of time, I feel.  But I got to spend a lot of it chatting with Jyco and some other people; I actually caught up with a friend from high school.  Er, my high school from Philly, not Jersey.  I spent a whole chunk of my day reading up on and selecting my potential courses, as well as trying to find a job and getting an ID card.  I still have to figure out some scheduling thing, I didn't find a job, and I still haven't gotten my ID card yet.  On the plus side, I made pierogies today.  After boiling them to defrost, minced some garlic and a little bit of fresh rosemary,  grated a heaping amount of parmesan and some romano cheeses, and cooked it all up in some olive oil.  So good.  I also cooked mixed veggies and broccoli, for some health.  Later that night, I went out to Applebee's to hang out with some of my roommates' church friends.  Big difference my brother pointed out beforehand to me, and I found out to be true today:  people at Hopkins always joke about how much work and studying we have to do, and have done, but people at Rutgers always joke about how little work and study they really do and still get by.  Talking to my roommate, I found the Rutgers experience vastly different than mine... I never had time to do anything but study, but he had all the time to do anything but study!  Well, I'm glad that I went throught it all.  I sure learned a lot and it really was worth the stress and heartache.

      All you ladies and gentlemen out there,  meet  urlLink Edmund Moon , one of the coolest guys I know.  I first met him while visiting JHU during my senior year of high school.  It was during Asian Perspectives weekend and I wanted to see what the ministries were like in college, so I checked out this ministry called "Agape".  After it was over, I he walked over and greeted me with his trademark, sortof aloof grin. "Hey."  The conversation consisted of greetings, introductions, and then he asked me if I had met his brother Jeff, who was also visiting. (No, I hadn't then.)  There was a connection made, at least on my part, that I knew would begin a good lasting friendship.  4.5 years later, we're still friends, and I'm the lucky one.  Why?  The guy has passion for the Lord, passion to live a life of integrity, and a passion for worship.  It rubbed off on me some over the years, especially from serving on worship team under his tutelage.  Sure, he's a bit goofy, and sure, he makes the corniest jokes, but he makes up for it with his genuine, fun-loving personality.  He's also one of the most considerate people I know.  He's always concerned about the good of those around him, and not just by doing the big things, but by consistently remembering the little things.  I remember, I think it was my freshman year, where he was one of the few people that remembered my birthday.  Heck, I never even told him my birthday, so it was a surprise to me that he sent a card.  Thanks Edmund, that made my day.  What also made my day was something he mentioned to me the first Sunday I attended Hope Chapel after I decided to attend, last year.  It was after service, and he pulled me aside with that sheepish grin again, and said something along the lines of,  "Hey, man, you'll make a difference here. God will do a lot through you."  Up till that moment, I just wasn't too sure, but yeah, that really perked me up.  There's a lot else that I could say, but I just want to leave it at that.  Ladies, consider:  he's caring, he's thoughtful, he loves the Lord... and he's going to be a doctor.  $$!  j/k.  Thanks for the friendship, Edmund.  Man, I miss Baltimore already.

      So, today I woke up and washed up, and went on campus to start the ball rolling for my new life here at Rutgers.  I began the paperwork process for getting my stipend (filling out W-4 forms... it's like a job!), received course advisement, and talked with a guy that was in my faculty advisors lab.  Afterwards, I walked to the student union, which was next door, and wolfed down some pizza.  (The student union on this campus (there are 3 others) has always been a big marvel to me, since Hopkins "student union" was virtually unused.  It was/is really crappy. The Hopkins library is essentially the student union.)  So yeah.  I went back, and tried to... ahem.. work the angles (jimmy and jimmy, I hope you appreciate me saying that) for finding a job.  I talked to my advisor and the grad secretary if they knew anyone that had any positions open.  To no avail, did I work those angles.  No openings.  Dangit.  So, I went home to start choosing my coursework and whatnot for registration.  It was really warm on the couch though, and the sun was beating down from the skylights, so I took an unplanned nap.  It got really hot at times but I stayed asleep until 5:30... man, where'd the day go?  I started the rice going for dinner, and prepared some songs for my brother's cell group tonight.  This morning, he sent some really confusing emails and it didn't hit me until I was making the rice that he was giving me the worship topic.  *rolling eyes*  My bro came back, so we started cooking dinner.  Only one person came this week, and he brought some food as well (linguini and some sour cream sauce).  Worship and bible study was ok.  We covered the conversion of Saul/Paul in Acts.  Since then, I've been typing away for this entry.  For the past month it's been more difficult to keep it up, since I've been travelling a lot.  It's not that I haven't access to the computer, it's that so much has happened, I've been too lazy to type it all out.  Here's a memory.  The first night at Jimmy Su's place in Texas, Jimmy and I hung out at his church's youth group function.  It was in this really nice house in a neighborhood on a big hill; man, the house was packed.  They all love Jimmy... as soon as we walked in the door, they all yelled his name (kinda like Cheers) and crowded around him.  Local celebrity, I tell you.  Afterwards, we went to a cafe with his friends Alex Chen and Pey Lin.. uh.. dunno her last name, and Jimmy's sister, aka Junior.  That's what I called her because she's Jimmy with long hair.  A little shorter and more athletic, but yeah, Janice's face = Jimmy's face.  It was there I shared cheesecake with everyone and tasted Jimmy's drink.. maybe that's how I got the summer flu.  Next post:  a tribute to my brother and friend, Edmund Moon.  oh, and for you ladies out there, count it as an advertisement.

      Today was my church youth group pastor's last Sunday, so afterwards we stopped by Applebee's for dessert.  A lot of us ordered milkshake. Strange, for some reason, I downed mine in a second, but everyone else wasn't as enthusiastic, so I ended up drinking lot more milkshake.  Afterwards we went to the park to play ball.  All my Hopkins peeps reading this must be surprised, since I never play.  But, it was for my youth group kids, and I decided what the hey.  I played a lot better than I have done in the past, but man... I wasn't feeling so well. I started to get light-headed and dizzy, so I drank a lot of water and laid down on one of the benches.  It must have been the milk shakes.   Afterwards, I drove my mom home, and she gave me a haircut.  For some reason, she really likes my massages (most people cringe in howl in pain because I of my grip, but my mom likes it for some reason), so I gave her a massage.  Poor mom, she's sometimes having weird episodes of slightly losing motor control... some parts of her body start spazzing out.  Not in any extreme way, but her muscles sorta tighten up.  The thing that stinks is, we don't currently have insurance.  Kinduva transition period.  Man.  So, my bro and I got some food, and headed back.  We had a good talk about running the youth group, basketball, and tomorrow's cell group.  Since getting back, I've been talking online and setting down what I want to do this week.  What I thought about during the car rid home:  Multi-talented people really aren't multi-talented, they're really good at one thing: drive.  They have the drive to learn, the drive to meet an ideal.  So, naturally, when they turn to different areas of interest, they get really good at them.. but it all goes back to just being proficient at pursuing their ideals.  I'm not sure if that communicated exactly what I was thinking, but oh well. That will do.

      I joined my roommate's small group, led worship, and we all went to Applebee's afterwards.  I have ~7 dollars left in my bank account.  You know, Sarah, you're right.  I have, again, let myself become trapped in my own condemnation again.  Man, it's hard to fight it, but I know that I must, and I can, because of the firm truth of the Gospel.  It's just very difficult to listen to the light... funny, huh?  Well, I have no doubt that these depressive thoughts and feelings will always keep coming... but I think with time, I'll learn how to be distracted from them with the greater joy's in Christ...

      Today I read a  urlLink Calvin and Hobbes  collection that was lying around the apartment.  Bill Watterson is a genius.  After reading that, I made lunch and headed off for campus, from which I type this entry.  I really don't come into contact with people I know besides my roommates, and it's not healthy.  I just don't want to become a loner, because loners can be very weird.  When alone, one gets comfortable living in one's thoughts until it creates a tiny little world that eliminates the need for people.  Loners have problems dealing with people because people can't possibly understand the Loner's rules (the Loner never communicates them, so how could they?) in the Loner's world, and the Loner can't control people the way he or she can control his or her world.  Life isn't meant to be lived alone.  We're all built for companionship.  I think too hard.  I should just sleep for a very long time. Yeah.

      Here I am, the end of the day.  Man, during the whole day, I was totally under this laziness bug... just didn't have motivation to do much, besides read.  I finally worked up some nerve to practice guitar, but that didn't last long either.  All my dreams and hopes and plans are not being met, because this feeling overpowers.  Since I don't fight back successfully, does that mean I'm falling away from His presence?  Was I in it in the first place?  In what shred of proof can I place my confidence of salvation?  Well, the Word says that the only proof is Christ crucified, dead, buried, and risen.  But why does it seem like I haven't changed?  Why still continue doing the same old habits?  I'm always reading in the word that those who know Him are the ones that obey Him, and that's how we have confidence:  "No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God. This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God; nor is anyone who does not love his brother...    Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth. This then is how we know that we belong to the truth, and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence whenever our hearts condemn us. For God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.   Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from him anything we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him. And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us. Those who obey his commands live in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us."  From 1 John 3.  Well, I just don't see how I love with actions and in truth... oh, how self-centered I am.  But I also have the desire to fight it, to really try to love.  And so, the battle inside me wages on.  I feel terrible and condemned, I fight, it goes away, comes again, I fight, etc. etc.  The thing is, it just seems like I just don't learn from my mistakes... I forget to believe in Christ's name, and I forget to love those around me.  And so I read  urlLink Romans 7 and 8 .  Yet, why does my heart still feel guilty and heavy and depressed inside?  I won't lie.  Why is it so hard for me to be joyous these days?

      Tired. Listless.  That's what I am these days.  I haven't done much, don't feel like doing much, though there is much to do.  Well, for the past two days, I spent my time reading Timeline, a Crichton novel.  Ate some.  I should be preparing stuff, and I want to, but man, just can't do it.  Such is my life!

      For the past 2 hours, I watched a movie that brought me 10 years back, when Vanilla Ice was still in the spotlight and we were all hooked on Sonic The Hedgehog (all the cool kids were into Sega Genesis).  The movie brought back an age of innocence, a time when I was still getting used to my new house in Pennsylvania, and I was struggling to fit into a hostile social environment.  The movie in question?  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2.  Man. I still remember when it just came out, and now when I watch it, it looks like it's still from the 80s... the outfits were tacky, the style of the jokes... but then Vanilla Ice dancing and yelling "Go Ninja, Go Ninja, Go!" reminded me that it was the early 90s.  Man.  I can't believe it's already 10 years.

      So here I am again in the Library of Science and Medicine, reading... a Michael Crichton book.  Go ahead and laugh. Yeah, I should be reading a book on gait analysis or biomechanics, but instead I've chosen pop culture fiction.  Hey, at least I'm reading instead of watching tv or going on the internet.  I figured a book like this will get me back into "the zone,"  the mental state where I can read for hours and feel like it's only been a minute.  I used to be a genuinely joy-filled, excited person.  These days, I'm constantly depressed, apathetic, and tired of the same things.  Yet, I return to the same things like, in biblical imagery, a dog returning to its vomit.  Don't be depressed by this entry! I've not given up hope on life, nor on the future.  It's just a phase that God's been using to teach me how to fight my feelings and depend Him for my strength in my willpower.  I've never really had much willpower... and these times have shown how truly scant amounts that I have.  But when I will develop it, I will have the confidence to say that it's God's, not mine... and truly give where the credit is due.  "How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure." — 1 John 3:1-3, today's topic of personal study.  I view this online journal as a personal essay column.  Albert, thanks for that little article you recently wrote in your blog about blog etiquette.  I agree and I hope that this medium doesn't become one that replaces personal contact, but a medium that simply enhances our instant message/phone/real life conversations and interactions by giving topics to talk, think, and pray about.  I pray as well that this will show that there's more to meets the eye in people that you know, and that these sort of things should be pushed to be communicated during conversation and interaction.

      According to  urlLink The Ultimate Personality Test ,  "Timothy, you're a Lethal Weapon!   Your personality is actually determined by two personality sub-types — your primary, or dominant sub-type, and your secondary sub-type. You are a Lethal Weapon which means you are a Seeker / Thinker. Your primary sub-type is defined by "Seeker" characteristics and your secondary sub-type is defined by "Thinker" characteristics.   That means you're open-minded, enthusiastic, and popular. Chances are you might even break the rules sometimes. You're motivated and serious, and you always jump at the chance to take on a new project. Innovation and abstract thinking are your strengths."  I guess that's true.  But it fails to mention that I thought I jump at chances to take on new projects, I'm not one for endurance.  However, reading these descriptions made me realize to that they are so general, they don't really describe much about what the test says about your personality.  Unless you shell out fifteen bux.   urlLink Keirsey.com  has consistently, over the past 4 years, has said that I am  urlLink a Teacher in the Idealist category .   urlLink Here's  another description on it.  Read up on it if you like.

      Here I am again sitting in the Rutgers Library of Science and Medicine.  Busch campus has some butt ugly buildings.  Butt ugly.  Concrete grids stained with rust (?) and dirt.  Research buildings that try to look futurist and modern but really have no aesthetic value. They're uneven and harsh to look at.  For you Wellesley students, think of that big concrete science building in the middle of your campus.  Now, think of a whole campus filled with that sort of building.  phew!  But, one quickly gets used to it, and I'm not complaining; I'm getting paid to do research.  I've spent a considerable amount of time researching... what to put in my new computer.  I've $500 that will be paid for, and anything over is what I pay.  I sure hope that I can get it down as low as possible, but since my brother insists on having an all in wonder, that's hard to do.  Those video cards go for at least $147. Arg.

      What I was thinking about as I woke up this morning:  The problems with un-reciprocated affections/intentions for someone  1)  If not dealt with right away, over a long period of time they will lead to obsession.  If you like someone, it's not very healthy to keep it in for such a long period of time, if you know that the person doesn't feel the same way about you.  It's difficult, but maybe it's wisest to start off a friendship by being fully honest with your feelings, instead of thinking, "maybe i'll be friends with him/her first, and then he'll like me."  However, every case is different; you'll either end up with a good, healthy, relationship based upon friendship, or be left in the dust, burned and scarred for life, AND still have to try to maintain the friendship... because friendship is always precious.  Or, both can happen as well.  Quite a gamble, don't you say?  So, let's say that if you're like me, you've ended up liking someone for a long time, then informed that person, and had your worst suspicions confirmed: the person doesn't feel the same way.  Well, that's when it gets very difficult, because one should have communicated intentions earlier on BEFORE the attachment had grown  this deep  for  this long .  The danger is that developing a relationship while having those attachments left undealt with can lead to obsession.  For example, you can't stop thinking about that person, how wonderful that person is, how you like everything about the person (including what you perceive the person's faults to be) etc... and it frustrates you, because you can't communicate it with the assurance that the person will joyfully appreciate your affections.  Usually, no matter hard you fight to think about other things, it comes back, because again, you've developed an attachment for so long.  That's how you know that you've become obsessed.  If you act upon that obsession... calling too much, doing too much... that's when you become creepy.  If you don't act upon it because you don't want to be creepy, that's good for the person in question, but it's still torture for you... but it's better that way.  Who wants to be known as creepy?  And if you really cared for that person, would you want him/her to put up with you?  For this person, showering too much affection on him/her is like forcing him/her to eat something they've already tasted... disliked.  2)  Obsession leads to delusion.  So, sadly, you're caught with this obsession, and you don't know how to deal with it.  You fight it, but if it's already grown strong enough, it starts to make you think:  "maybe after a long time, things will work out" or "someone else is in the picture".  Since you start thinking too much about it, that leads to making up unrealistic scenarios that seem real to you.  Watch out for that.  3)  Delusion leads to bitterness, anger, jealousy, and territorialism.  The problem with entering the delusion stage is that it usually yields the above negative fruits... you start feeling bitter towards the person, or to the phantom competition, and anger comes up... jealousy, then territorialism.  I.e., a false sense of possession takes over:  "The person was mine first! I liked him/her first!  I've known him/her longer!" etc. etc.  That's why matters of the heart are to be dealt with extreme carefulness.  For me, the only thing that's brought me to this point is God's grace.  I'm still here.  I still struggle a lot with thinking too much about this person.  My problem is, I form very vivid memories, so even if I don't see someone for a long time, I can still be very emotionally involved because I remember the times spent together very well.  However, God has been gracious to teach me a lot.  He's taught me a whole lot about my weaknesses and how my sinful tendencies rear their ugly heads.  He's shown how self-centered I can really be in my outlook, with my time, and with my thought life.  Most importantly, He's shown what a life lived in love with Him should be like:  total, joyful, faithful, loving obsession.  He wants to be the center, because He knows He is the only one that can fulfill... because He's the only one that deserves being the center of attention.

      Here's yet another entry.  I've spent all day running around campus in order to find a job (applied to one place), get registered, and start research on my topic.  So, here I am in the Library of Science and Medicine, sitting at one of the computer terminals.  I found a buttload of books on my topic (gait analysis. ie, scientifically analyzing/modelling how humans walk) and I sorta skimmed through them, but quickly lost interest.  Yes, short attention span strikes again. I would check out these books, but I can't yet since I have to be a registered student to check out books and my registration hasn't gone through yet.  Why do I continue to blog so diligently?  You see, I'm not following a fad.  I didn't do this because everyone else was doing it; I started my online journal without even knowing that there was a trend in the first place.  I've had the idea to do this since freshman year of college, but I've always been too lazy or too occupied with something else to start it... but finally, here it is, 6 months and still going.  I wanted to do this journal because I hoped that it would give an honest snapshot into the daily life and thoughts of a Christian in the modern day world.  I also wanted to start using this page as a platform upon which I can start expressing my artistic urges and ideas.  I don't know why, but in the middle of my junior year I renewed a keen interest to be more artistic of a person.  I was interested in the arts a lot in high school, but in college that was all thrown in the back burner to make room for math and science.  A course called Intermedia Studio really opened my eyes to the art world.  The class was a joint effort between Hopkins, Peabody, and Maryland Institute College of Art students/faculty and it tried to explore the connections between media to communicate artistic statements.  It was really interesting and really forced me to see the importance of having a deep purpose for everything we do as scientists, artists, and musicians.  Most of the musical bands, movies, etc. that people tend not to like, the forgettable hiccups of modern culture are the ones that have little meaning and thought put into their making, they're the ones that don't have a sense of adventure and exploration in whatever craft, in whatever purpose they have.  I've desired to produce a cohesive, artistic work for a long time, but I haven't been able to do so yet.  I think that class, prayer, and failed works have forced me to realize that I haven't done so yet because I've not had something deep and meaningful to communicate.  I've focused too much attention to details that I've lost the big picture of things:  God wants all the glory, and we can find our only meaning and joy in giving glory to Him in all that we do.  I can spit that out, but I haven't exhausted my attention and energy in exploring that truth.  Well, God's Grace has brought me this far.  He's taught me important lessons.  What does he want to do through me now?  Well, He's placed me in charge of the elementary school kids in my church, in a scientific laboratory, in the midst of a college campus with a myriad of ministries, in the midst of a state with a need for revival.    He's shown that in order to be taking seriously musically, I have to learn real musicianship instead of basing my practice and skills soley on little tricks I've picked up here and there.  He's shown that I have to seek to know the purpose of things, then learn the music technique in order to meet these ideals.  Yes, it's very Aristotelian (or is that Platonic? or a mixture of both?) logic:  knowing the "greater good", the underlying theory, and being the "master craftsman" is more important than just learning how to copy things.  These are all ideals that I have.  Are these Godly ideals?  Have I learned well?

      In reading "Knowing God" this morning, I was humbled by the following quotes:  "We need frankly to face ourselves at this point.  We are... orthodox evangelicals.  We can state the gospel clearly... smell unsound doctrine a mile way.  If asked how one may know God, we can at once produce the right formula:  that we come to know God through Jesus Christ the Lord, in virtue of his cross and mediation, on the basis of his word of promise, by the power of the Holy Spirit, via a personal exercise of faith.  Yet the gaiety, goodness, and unfetteredness of spirit which are the makers of those who have known God are rare among usÂ—rarer, perhaps, than they are in some other Christian circles where, by comparison, evangelical truth is less clearly and fully known. "  "A little knowledge  of  God is worth more than a great deal of knowledge  about  him."  "All very fineÂ—yet interest in theology, and knowledge  about  God, and the capacity to think clearly and talk well on Christian themes, is  not at all the same thing as knowing Him. "  "We must learn to measure ourselves, not by our knowledge about God, not by our gifts and responsibilities in the church, but by how we pray and what goes on in our hearts.  Many of us, I suspect, have no idea how impoverished we are at this level. Let us ask the Lord to show us."  *hand raised*  I have no idea the full extent how impoverished I am, but I know that at least to some degree of understanding, I'm pretty darn impoverished.  "It is those who have sought the Lord Jesus till they have found himÂ—for the promise is that when we seek him with all our hearts, we shall surely find himÂ—who can stand before the world to testify that they have known God."  Can I really stand and testify? It's time, again, to start seeking Him with all my heart.

      After living on my own without work or many responsibilities for the past couple of months, I've come to see the following things:  1) I have the unexhaustible tendency to be lazy, shirking what little responsiblities I have to do what I feel like at the moment.  2) Due to that constant lifestyle of instant gratification, my ability to concentrate and keep a well-sustained train of thought has dwindled.  The perpetual option of choice offered by TV and the internet has trained my mind to need a rapid, changing medium in order to keep its interest on something.  3) I still have been able to do some good thinking, and I've been meditating on the seeds of some of my bad habits and addictions.    One fault I have is an intense fear of others' opinions, as well the fear of "the unknown."  I'm not sure where they all came from, but I remember having them since early childhood.  I remember going to a birthday party with a gymnastics theme; I think I was in third grade, and upon arrival, everyone was at the big trampoline.  Well, I was terribly frightened, because while I was small and scrawny, everyone seemed to be well coordinated and physically fit.  Therefore, since they were all doing all these fancy tricks, here was scrawny, nerdy old me, I lied and complained that I had a headache and wanted to sit down.  Of course, after 5 minutes, I was bored, and I decided to play by myself in the obstacle course on the other side of the gym.  Instances like that typify the initial response I have to deal with internally when faced with high pressure, like when I step into the employment office of a company to get a part time job, or meet my professor for research, etc.  I'm learning to recognize when I'm caught up in those fears, but it's still an uphill battle to say no to all of it.  I guess those tendencies led to my passive tendencies, as well.

      What a long weekend.  I'm not sure I have the energy to say all that happened.  Too bad, I don't.  Something learned this weekend:  A strong, healthy, MUTUALLY encouraging marriage makes all the difference in the world.  When you're in an environment that doesn't have that, well... life can be unbearable.

      I'll summarize the last post into a more easily readable post, in the near future.  Anyhow, all I did today and yesterday was watch TV.  Ok, I also led worship for my roommate's small group time.  That was good.  I didn't prepare adequately for the kids tomorrow, though. ` Why?  The small things that I always give my attention to, throughout the week, always end up sucking up hours on end of my time.  I just got a new computer.  On Tuesday, I went home to pick up all the parts.  It was going to only be for a little bit, but then I decided to start cleaning my brother's car.  That ended up becoming a 3 hour task.  I then wanted to take my little brother to get an anti-static bracelet from CompUSA, but my mom decided to come along... that became a 1.5 hour ordeal.  Then, over the next 3 days, I spent all my time building my computer, installing, tweaking, etc.  Then, Friday hit.  My brother asked me to help him make a dish for lunch and a potluck that evening.  That became a 3 hour ordeal.  I then had to go on campus to take care of some business, then back...  And, throughout the week, on countless occasions, I sat down and picked up the remote, to find my self falling asleep 4 hours later after having watched 2 movies.  That's where my time goes.

      what i've been thinking about, laying in bed, as i have been writing, staring at the ceiling.  as shared with jacob online.   me:  jacob   jake:  hey, dude   me:  i was deep in thought until   me:  now.   me:  and i was thinking about   me:  what life is.   jake:  dude, that's too deep for me   me:  essentially, it's about, what you want, and how to get it.   me:  people want.   me:  they want something   me:  they either get it   me:  or they don't   me:  and all life seems to revolve about all the things that we want   me:  and whether we get them, or not.   jake:  hm...   me:  all of pain   me:  and dementia   me:  and struggle   me:  and anger   me:  and bitterness, joy, love, everything   me:  is based upon us having wanted something   me:  and either getting it, or not   me:  isn't that what life is?   me:  sustenance of existence?   me:  and in order to meet the sustenance of existence, there are needs?   jake:  that's eithe too deep or too oversimplified   me:  that's how God created us   me:  no   me:  think about it   me:  fundementally   me:  very very fundementally   me:  we all are driven by something that we want   me:  but we really don't know what it is   me:  and that's why God said   me:  or, jesus said   me:  the greatest commandment is this:   me:  Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.   me:  in other words   me:  actively make your deepest need... to be God   me:  and that's where eternal Life is   me:  eternal life = wanting God, and satisfying ourselves in Him   me:  life = sustenance of existance   me:  God knows that our only source of existance is Him   jake:  you should share this with ppl   me:  i will   me:  i am with you   me:  and i'll post this conversation online   me:  :-)   me:  but i'll protect your screenname.   me:  but think about it.   me:  we all want something… for example.   me:  men want sex   me:  why?   me:  why do men want it all the time?   me:  because they want to feel good   jake:  true   me:  and that's the easiest way for men to feel really good   me:  it's quick, it's physically invigorating   me:  it involves the imagination, and the senses   jake:  all the qualities that adam saw in the fruit   me:  and that's how men are wired   jake:  of the tree of knowledge   me:  and sex drives men's culture   me:  at least, in the media   me:  why?   me:  because it touches a very easy vein to tap   me:  but women as well   me:  they want a lot of things   me:  and when they get old   me:  if they've not gotten them all their life   me:  they're extremely miserable   me:  they're never happy   me:  and therefore no one that they no is happy when they're around.   me:  well, that's a generalization, i apologize.   jake:  you are like the christian siddhartha   me:  but, i guess, that goes for women as well.   me:  but isn't that true?   me:  but the thing is   me:  Truth is in Christ   me:  Christ knew that   me:  and so that's why He said   me:  "I am the way, the Truth, the life"   me:  because He knew that   me:  if we know Christ, the Son, we know God, the Father   me:  and if we know the Creator, OUR creator, and if we look to Him for life, then we'll get it   me:  because He's the One that made us   me:  and He knows EXACTLY how to please us   me:  the problem arises   me:  that in our stupid sinfulness   me:  we turn to ourselves, the functions of our natural bodies   me:  that, without sin, function to enable us to enjoy God   me:  but with sin, these functions became the only things we can think about   me:  and so we look to the tools to please us, not the Maker.   me:  right?   me:  so, thinking about all the problems in American society   me:  a society where our basic needs are pretty much met   me:  so much, that our needs have become our secondary needs: entertainment   me:  we want to feel good   me:  and we try to pursue that with all our money and will   me:  but we have so much depression   me:  so many basket cases   me:  so many suicides, cases of abuse, etc.   me:  why?   me:  because we look to ourselves for what we want   me:  and then, we try to meet those wants   me:  and so all these problems arise   me:  psychological problems   me:  but Christ, He knew that the only thing that matters   me:  is that we want Him   me:  and all we have to do is ask.   jake:  this is a good sermon, defnitely   jake:  i think u have preacher blood in u   me:  haha.   me:  but yeah   me:  in the depths of who we are   me:  Christ said, we have to die to it   me:  because they lie to us   me:  they = our phantom desires   me:  no one really knows what they want   me:  in the fundemental level   me:  there are so many things to believe in this world   me:  I choose to believe that Christ is right   me:  "I am the way, the truth, the life"   me:  "Love me, with all your heart, and all your soul, and all your mind"   me:  not the next fix of entertainment   me:  or the next thrill you get when you see the girl you obsess over   jake:  yes..   me:  Christ wants that object of obsession to be Himself   me:  and that's HARD for us   me:  it's awfully hard for me   jake:  these are conclusions similar to what mark lim came to and shared with me, long ways back..   me:  we just don't get it   me:  I just don't get it.   me:  what it really means to want Christ   me:  with all my passion   me:  with all that I am.   me:  what does that really mean?   me:  I think   me:  that want   me:  that desire   me:  is the only real need that really underlies everything.   me:  the need to figure out   me:  what it means to really have passion for Christ   me:  I've obsessed over this girl   me:  and all that's come out of it  me:  is me feeling bad   me:  and her having to deal with this obsessed guy   me:  I've obsessed over being an artist   me:  but i honestly didn't have the drive   me:  to produce works of art   me:  I have zero works to present to you at this moment.   jake:  keep working at it, bro   me:  and i have no job. I can't support myself.   jake:  God is working in you, shaping you   me:  I can't get into my school research.   jake:  taking u thru experiences   me:  all these things led up to my depression   jake:  thru rough times, even   me:  but i realized, now, that I've been wanting the wrong things   me:  and that's why i'm miserable.   me:  i hope this has been an encouragement to you.   me:  and food for thought   me:  thank you for listening, since i seem to only to function   me:  by talking to someone   jake:  defnitely food for thought   jake:  that's cool   jake:  i'm always here to listen

      I have been slipping and sliding closer to living like a vegetable, just existing day to day for the next glass of water, the next plate of food, the next thing to please me.  Not such a happy sentiment to listen to or read, is it?  I have to be honest, though.  I do have to say, though, that thought I'm slipping and sliding closer to that state of being, I have been fighting.  I started off this week on a really good note, I got a lot done on Monday and Tuesday.  But quickly again I lost to my feelings of laziness and whimsical mind.  So, the battles have been lost, but the war isn't close to being over.  I've had past burdens on my shoulders:  failed romances, unmet expectations in my academics, art, and whatnot, but life isn't over, it's just begun.  Life begins every day.  I regress a lot, and I lose myself in my feelings, thereby acting in ways that put others in unease (like, during an AIM conversation that I had Thursday afternoon, or being slothful about the dishes, or not commencing on my research), and there's no excuse.  I've sinned, I've failed, but I have a hope in Someone that never does.  I'm not sure where this thoughts are going to take me.  I'm not sure if I'll stay in my low state.  But I will fight, and I will fight by settling with that lack of confidence in my inheritance in Christ.  People ask me what I need prayer for, well, this is it:  I need to deeply dig into the root of my being and settle my fears, my sins, my angsts, my joys, and ask Christ to replace them with His joys, His promises, His truths, and His goodness.  I need to get serious with who I am in this world, in existence, if I'm to live life to the fullest.  I need to get joyous over my state in existence:  I am a child of God.  I am a child of God.

      I am tired.  I am in a position right now where I want to tell this person something but I am not quite sure how I should or if I should.  This is the result of much thinking and mental battling, yet it's not even close to being finished yet.  Why is it so hard for people to believe in Christ, in God?  I think the biggest reason that people have, but won't ever admit, is that it's the fear of losing one's authority over the self's life.  It's a scary and abstract idea to entrust yourself to something or someone you can't physically see, hear, feel, touch, or relate to in the way we do with people we see daily.  I am very tired right now.  I sleep.  What's your purpose?

      Well, this sure was a busy day.  I got up, cleaned the apartment, tried to start taking care of my loans, made dinner (I made meatballs, then sauce, then spaghetti... recipe from  urlLink www.foodnetwork.com ) that my brother asked me to make for small group tonight.  It was incredibly good, the recipe... the meatballs were a pork/beef mix with roasted fennel, coriander, a chili, freshly chopped rosemary, and salt and pepper.  I think it'd make an incredible burger, as well.  Just think.  That mix for a burger with fresh mozzarella, fresh parmesan, a good green lettuce, tomato, red onion, and pickle all on a garlic toasted bun.  That's my ideal burger.  It's a blend of italian and american... so good.  Well, another busy day tomorrow.  God, have mercy... please lead me to do what you desire for me to do.  Keep me from listening to those feelings of laziness.  I still miss all of my college friends.  But life must go on.  I had a conversation with a guy that will be staying here for a couple of weeks about music.  Honestly, I've been really jaded and disinterested with much of the music out there these days.  This is not to say that it's without talent... in fact, I think that there is exceptional talent out there.  However, all recent innovation in music has been based off of rehashing and remixing old things.  This is not bad either, because for the moment it sounds fresh and exciting.  But, I think it quickly loses my interest because, after all, I've heard it before.  (What I mean by rehash is the heavy amount of sampling done in hip hop music, the rap-metal fusion over the years, etc.)  I believe the stage is being set for something really new, bold, innovative, and lasting in its ability to excite.  The last way I felt that way about music was my personal discovery and research of  urlLink U2 . Their musical still sounds exciting and fresh to me... every time you listen, you don't get bored, you hear something new, another shade and texture that you've not heard in a previous listen.  I think that quality really drew me in... every song I've liked by them (and that's a LOT of songs...) has had that same experience for me, even the deceptively simple tracks that they released as pop singles.  The first U2 song that caught my attention was "New Year's Day" from their third album, entitled "War." (Incidently, they named it so because they were "declaring war" on a lot of the stale music of that time, as well as setting the tone for their very political purpose at that time for making music.)  "New Year's Day" is very dense in its soundscape... the first time I heard it, I thought it had a cool melody line.  The second time, I started to notice some different guitar sound here and there... and so it started, my intrigue for U2's music and how they create it.  That song sure doesn't sound like they were my age when they recorded it, but they were all about 22 or less.  Incredible.

      "maybe you shouldn't depend on people so much."  or, something similar to that was said to me by a friend of mine (I think you'll remember this convo, maybe you don't, the reader that said this to me).  It was in response to a me talking about this intense feeling of hollowness I had after I had just gotten back from the Chicago trip.  I think in some sense, that lonliness has been a cause of my depression and listlessness of late.  I miss a lot of the friends I had the pleasure to meet and know during college.  I think that I've grown so attached to the vibrant, social college environment, that the absence of it has rendered me with this hollowness inside.  In fact, a lot of depression started junior and senior year because those are the years in which I had less time to spend with friends, or meeting/interacting with people in general.  My personality and mental health seems to thrive on relationships and people... I need social contact.  So, that leaves me with a couple options to approach this problem.  1)  Maybe the problem is as I introduce this topic:  I could be too dependent upon people for my stability and strength, and not dependent enough upon my relationship with God.  Therefore, maybe I should spend a lot more time praying and reading the Word, instead of going online and reading blogs all day.  2)  Maybe it's just part of my personality, and it's not a problem to want to be around people.  After all, I am the extrovert, and God used that attribute to develop strong relationships over a wide range of people during college.  That really helped me to develop not just tolerance, but a real sense of God's love for His people.  Therefore, maybe I just have to move on and try to start building a new base of friendships here, and make all the effort I can to keep those old relationships alive.  3) Maybe it's a mixture of both.  It's probably a mixture of both.  Well, that's enough personal soul searching.  Today, I had the opportunity to lead childrens' worship, and take them out to McDonald's for some ice cream (or other treats).  It's been 4 years since I left my position to go to college, and my mom stuck me back into it.  Begrudgingly, I did so.  It was a begrudging effort because my heart hasn't been into that idea, and she just told me to do it.  I like children a lot, though.  The kids I have to work with now are really cute and well-behaved, and are very eager to learn... especially when it comes to memorizing bible verses.  They retain it a lot more than adults seem to, and it seems to be an easier effort.  At least, for grades 3 - 5.  I'm teaching a 6 year range of ages, which is really big, since stages of mental development between spans of even a year are very different.  So, I set up a top down chain of command... each kid is directly responsible for the kid that is directly younger.   That way, a good system of discipline is set up, and the kids learn a good understanding of responsiblity.  I taught them a quick lesson and led them with a little song; it was really cute, because they had rhythm instruments to play along.  Kids are such incredible windows into realizing how we really all are still children... it's just the older we get, the more stubborn we get.

      As I went to the bathroom on the ground floor of my house, something strange happened.  I didn't turn on the light from the hallway was bright enough to illumine the room.  The weird thing happened when I looked in the mirror as I washed my hands...  Picture yourself staring at your reflection, dimly lit... but all your features are dusted with a white coating of light.  It really creeped me out... it reminded me of that white face that flashes momentarily during the exorcism scene in The Exorcist.   I find it very difficult to not give in to my emotional episodes of late.  I find myself overcome with longing, disappointment, and hollowness.  I think if I weren't Christian, I would have succumbed to all of this a long time ago.  It's very hard for me to have hope sometimes.  I find myself getting angry because I messed up so many things this past year: friendships, school career, etc.  "School career? But you're getting your PhD!"  Yes, but it just doesn't seem right.  Maybe I'm not really supposed to be doing this.  I've always been more interested in multimeda and the presentation of information, than biomedical engineering.  But, I know that I tend to unrealistically fantasize too much.  People have asked me, "If you want to do music so much, why don't you put everything you have into it?"  Honestly, I'm not quite so sure.  I get really depressed on this subject, first and foremost because I haven't been able to produce a single work yet.  I can't write songs.  My mind loses focus and I guess I just don't have the talent or skills.  Yet, since high school, I've always wanted to write a song.  All throughout college, I tried, but nothing really ever came out.  Maybe I've lived too easy of a life, that my heart doesn't have much material to express.  I am not quite so sure what it is, but here I am, wishing I can express myself and write some good songs, but I can't.  Why do I want to write good music?  I honestly don't know why either.  I admit there is a sense of pride in there... having people enjoy your music is quite the ego trip.  I was always the kid growing that starved to be the center of attention.  But when I got it, I always and still choke.  All my ideas and creativity flee, all numbness enters and lose any sense of thought.  Whenever I sit to try to write a song, that happens.  Whenever I try to record, it happens.  There are these times where I launch into this long, absorbed bliss of playing around on the guitar... so in my excitement, I hook it up for recording, and it all just goes out the door.  Maybe God's led me to this point this way to get rid of that self-seeking attitude.  In any case, all praise to Him...  I still don't get why I'm the way I am, and where I'm going in this life.  I guess it's moments like these that make people write lyrics like, "I still haven't found what I'm looking for."  I am just hoping that I can get the courage and strength to get off my butt and start to live life, not wasting it away by "familiarizing myself with culture," i.e. watching excessive amounts of cable television like I've been doing the past couple of weeks.  I just don't understand it.  Why do I feel like I've missed out on life?  Why do I feel like I'm broken?  I still don't see what purpose God's called me to.  Maybe it's my church kids.  Maybe it's developing computation models of walking to aid in the development of orthopadic devices, preoperative planning tools, video games, and movies.  Maybe it's music, after all.  Maybe it's to find that girl.  Maybe she's someone I know, and neither of us has caught on.  The here and now in my life is still searching for the what's next.  Maine, here I come.

      Tomorrow, the family and I drive to Maine.  This Sunday, we'll be attending Grace Chapel in Boston.  Boston people (all... what.. 2 of you?) that read this, be there! j/k.  I know you have your own churches to attend.  Am I a creepy guy?  I wonder if I've ever come off as such.  I hope not.  Life is like a box of chocolates, it has all these dark bittersweet pieces amongst sweeter ones.  I must move on. I must move on.

      To explain why I know I've become too introspective:  I've developed anti-social tendencies in this past year.  I find it hard for me to really relate to people more often than not these days... not because I can't, but because I'm too caught up with what I'm feeling to make the effort.  I've shied away from playing sports with friends, and enjoying activities in groups.  Well, recently, God smacked me in the face with that realization, and led me to see how childish I've become.  I used to have a heart to care for those around me, but these days that twisted into expecting people to do things for me, to accomodate themselves for what I want.  Seeing myself turn into that sickened me, and it sickens me now.  How could I dare say that I believe in His Name?  How could I ever dare to say that I am a child of God, when I have such a self-centered outlook?  God's been very gracious.  "He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." - John 1:11-13  A question I pose:  What does it mean to "receive Him?"  What does it mean to "believe in His name?"  How you do receive Christ in your heart? What is it that you receive, a concept? Do you just memorize it, and say that you know it?

      I've been boxed out, and there's no way in Why do I care?  'Cos rejection makes me want it more 'Cos rejection makes me want it more  Life is too short to hang myself up on this On what's not real.  But rejection makes me want it more But rejection makes me want it more  there's no cadence and poetry to what i've written.  and it's a bit abstract, i realize. but it's what i think about these days. I'm a clueless guy.  I have a logical, thoughtful head on my shoulders, but when emotions and feelings rise up, all that's left is recklessness and fickle emotions.  The worst part of all of this is that I've become way too introspective... I've become way too self-absorbed.  I critize easily, but am not above the same faults myself.  Maybe I should just become a shallow person.  What's the use of all this thought?  It's overkill. It's overload.

      Tonight I hung out with my roommates at Stelton Pizza.  Man, I miss good ol' NJ/NY pizza.  Nothing in the world like it... eating NJ/NY pizza during my childhood was what got me hooked on Italian.  Yes, it's my favorite style of food.  Yes, I'm Korean.  No, Korean isn't my favorite (and don't get on my case about it).  Not to say I don't like Korean food, but I have more of an Italian taste.  We watched The Royal Tenenbaums.  Very sweet, very quirky, I liked it a lot, I found myself laughing a lot... but sadly, at places where no one else in the room laughed.  It was quite embarrassing.  I liked the music selection, as well... Charlie Brown themes, the Ramones, etc. Very eclectic.  I realized this earlier tonight:  I have a very driven and motivated mindset, but I'm very lazy and easily distracted, so I'm frustrated all the time.  Either, I lower my standards, or start trying to meet them.  Go visit  urlLink www.dyske.com .  I have him linked up.  He has some very interesting articles.  I liked "Instruction Manual for Youth" parts one and two, as well as his "Dyske the Brand" campaign.  There are many choices in life we make, and the most fundemental choice being what we believe in... because what we believe in defines the direction and purpose of our lives.  Are you sure what truths you hold dear to are really worth holding dear to?

      Does anyone read this site anymore?  I never get any comments.  Not to say that I'm hungry for comments, but I just don't get any reactions to what I post.  Maybe I do too much at once?  Today, I awoke at 11, washed up, and went right to work at making a mix for a girl in my youth group.  She's one of the people that are interested in praise team.  I went on campus and took care of a bunch of mundane details.  I went back home and spent all night cooking for my brother's small group and d/l Radiohead songs and videos.  Yes, recently, if you haven't been able to tell, I've been getting back into Radiohead again.  I think this may be a test to see if I'll really apply what I've been thinking about and learning this past week.  In other words, I'm getting distracted.  I suppose I will have to tear myself away from listening to them and dreaming about how I can make music that is as thought provoking and complex.  I've lost a little focus.  It began when I was sitting in the computer lab on-campus; I decided on a whim to watch some Radiohead video online.. that spurred me to go home and record the sound of it so I can listen to it more.  That took a long time.  But man, they sure are really professional at their mixing, sampling, and just getting that unified sound.  Small group was interesting.  The one guy expressed his view that, from what he was learning in his religion classes, that the Bible shouldn't be given so much weight that it's given, to which I disagreed.  What else are you going to base your faith off of?  Your relationship with God?  It's more interesting to note that all his teachers for Islam, Hinduism, and etc. are devout believers of their respective faiths, but the class on Christianity is taught by an outspoken disbeliever.  "We will not refer to Jesus as 'Jesus Christ' because it is a religious affirmation... the only time I would use it is to use it as a profanity."  How screwed up is that?  You don't see anyone teaching Bhuddism saying something of that nature.  Not only is that going against what many believe, it's simply rude and one-sided... in that the professor is forcing the students to believe his view of Christ and the validity (or in his case, the invalidity) of the Bible.  How many of you Muslims out there would be offended if a professor in Islam would announce that he would not allow the usage of "Mohammed the Prophet" because he didn't believe Mohammed wasn't inspired, or the usage of "Allah" because that would be an confession of faith in Allah? And then, have the professor proceed to say that he would only use "Mohammed the Prophet" or "Allah" as profanities?  I would be offended as well.  Well, anyhow, tomorrow is a new day.  I am determined to get it right, to the best of what God strengthens me with.

      Start of a new week, and I'm determined to get it right this time.  I'm going to find a job.  I'm going to exercise.  I'm going to read for school.  I'm going to avoid television.  I'm going to eat my vegetables.  I'm going to practice guitar.  I'm going to read the Word and plan out a vision for my church.  I'm going to spend time with my roommates.  I'm going to clean the apartment.  I will be fitter. happier.  Ok, this is a total ripoff of  urlLink Radiohead , I admit.  Is there something creepy about this post? Or is it just me.

      "You give and take away, You give and take away, My heart will choose to say, 'Lord, blessed be Your name' ..."  A recent song that I've been blessed by is "Blessed Be Your Name," by Matt Redman on his latest cd.  Man, I'm so very immature.  Won't I ever learn?  When will I learn to sing this, with full truth, with experiences that reflect this?  By the way, that line reminds me of "and you give yourself away, and you give yourself away... with or without you... with or without you, oh... i can't live... with or without you."  I guess it's the repetitive phrases.

      "The song that finally climbed into the British Top Ten in late 1993 was written in the midst of genuine lovelorn trauma. 'When I wrote it,' said Thom, 'I was in the middle of a really, really serious obsession. It lasted about eight months. And it was unsuccessful, which made it even worse. She knows who she is.'" - Select Magazine  Thom Yorke, you say it exactly how it's been, just... as... it's been.  I know I've been a creep.  I know that I don't belong.

      "I can't get you out of my head."  -Kylie Minogue  I really don't like that song.  But, that line sums up my experience for a long time.  I can't get you out of my head.  As a result, my emotions have been up and down, I find myself lost in thought.  What do I think about?  I think about you and I.  But, then, I think, if we finally were together, would I really be happy?  Do I really know what I want?  I find that I don't.  Who knows what they really want?  Hopkins people complain, when they first get to Baltimore (and actually, some do all throughout) that there's nothing to do.  "I'd be so much happier in a school in NYC, because Baltimore sucks."  As I'm here in Rutgers, I meet people that go to New York schools like NYU, and they have their very long lists of complaints... and you know what?  NYC is the city of choice for all those Hopkins people.   In other words, people want something, but they don't know what that something is.  So, I return to this fixation, this attachment that I write about.  I can't get you out of my head.  I haven't been able to get you out of my head for so long now.  But, do I really know what I want?  Do I even realize that you don't think the same way about me, that you don't even think about me in the first place?  That you, in fact, are really annoyed and put at unease as I unwittingly act upon how I feel during our interactions?  Those of you reading this post may be wondering whom I refer to.  It's pretty much my fantasy that I am addressing.  My fantasy of someone.  My fantasy of my career.  My fantasy of what would make me satisfied.  The genius of God in saying that He's the only thing that will satisfy us lies in this:  we really don't know what we want.  We think by wanting all these corporeal things, by wanting a romance, by wanting a phantom called Success, we will be satisfied when we get it.  But, the genius lies within the incorporeal, incomprehensible nature of God.  We can't imagine what He looks like.  We can't smell, touch, or hear Him.  But, He's there.  He can't be imagined, but He's in a relationship with those who believe in His Son.  What we could ever want is Something outside of us.  The thing that kills me is that I still turn to the promises of instant pleasure made by modern entertainment, and my body's desires.  I am caught in the habit.  I will be fighting this habit for a very long time.  How can I fight to seek the greater pleasure in God?  How do I keep that Hope, that Promise alive for every waking moment?  How?

      Well, I'm going to go off to the first retreat in an hour.  I've never felt comfortable at home, or with my home church. Don't ask why, because I really don't know why either.  I guess the fact that my older brother and I are the only ones in our age range has something to do with it.  Or, maybe it's the fact that I was shoved into the charge of the kids ministry.  Please pray for me, I just don't have a good feeling about any of this.  There's a lot of issues I still have to deal with, like how I'm really uncomfortable with my parents when it comes to discussing spiritual things (which they want to do all the time).  Actually, I'm ok with talking about them with my dad, I think it's just my mother.   +++++++++++++++++++   What is my state of mind right now, but like a rowboat in a whirlpool?  My thoughts are like the eddies traced out by the oars.  Trying to escape, I feel like I'm going in circles through the relentless current.  I want something, but it's not attainable in my eyes.  Is it even what I think it is?  Is the placid water over the whirlpool's rim... placid? Is it there? Maybe I should let the current take me down... to the center, the deep, the dark.  See you all on Sunday.

           This little optical illusion illustrates one of the foibles of human visual perception.  I just generated that picture, so I can tell you with confidence that the picture is pure black and white; there are no grays existent in the picture.  Yet, as you can see, in between the blocks (especially at the corners), it seems like there are gray spots in the white.  Therefore, the human mind incorrectly assumes that there is gray, when in truth, the picture is black in white.  As I was walking, I don't know why this just came up to me, but it did.  I was wondering this:  Just as this image points out one of the limitations of human visual perception, I am wondering.  There are many topics in ethics, philosophy, etc. that people consider to be "gray areas."  However, what if things are more black and white than they seem?  Maybe in these issues, we distort the truth by our own imperfections.  So, how do we find that objective, cold hard standard to measure what's black, and what's white?  I'm not really sure what gray areas I have in mind, but I'm more thinking about just the concept of having gray areas in general.

Ok, that was pretentious.  My current thoughts for what the new site will have:  ·Keep a simple interface.  Remember, "Simple is best." ·Different sections:  I'm thinking of, in addition to my journal section, having a tech section in which, from time to time, i will post a "how things work" sorta deal with one of my interests.  For example, how to set the guitar delay to match the style of the Edge from U2 or all the copycat Vineyard/christian music peeps that use it now.  Etc. etc. ·Possibly, a forum.  I'll have to see if i'm allowed to run the cgi stuff on my school server.  Any more ideas?  Wow, I've wasted quite a bit of time here.

      Over the past week, I have been reading "The Return of the King,"  the third part of the Lord of the Rings saga by Tolkien.  This guy's a genius, and I think the reason why his works are above the rest of the fantasy fare (besides the fact that he virtually started the whole genre with these works in the first place) is that, well, he created more than a series of tales, he created a whole world.  He made up his own languages, complete with their own alphabets, word structures, etc.  He created a vast historical background for all the events that take place.  He wrote all the poems and whatnot.  Oh, and he wrote the books themselves...  The Lord of the Rings trilogy; it's prequel, the Hobbit;  their prequel, the Silmarillon; Unfinished Tales, and so on.  Volumes and volumes.  After reading the books and watching the movie again, I realize how much I really didn't understand a lot of the nuances here and there when I first saw the movie without reading anything.  There are many nods to the Hobbit in the movie, and there are a whole lot of allusions to what will happen later in the series that I didn't quite pick up.  The books are sometimes hard reads, though, in that they all move very slowly when you first start.  But they do get pretty good as you plod on.  Did anybody know that during the late 60s, the Lord of the Rings received this huge jumpstart of popularity?  It became a big cultural phenomenon.  People would write in subway walls, "Frodo Lives!", and it was sortuva hippie kinda thing (not really popular, but enough to be remembered) to say at the time.  They also generated buttons and bumper stickers and other paraphernalia which proclaimed, "Frodo Lives", "Gandalf for President", and opened new "head shops" with such names as "Middle-Earth", "Hobbit" and "Mithril".  Just some nerdy trivia :-)

      Well, couple strokes before midnight, and I post.  Today was a productive one;  I set up my new email account, finished registration, had my parents' phone fixed, and started to check out prices for a new video card. I'm also in the planning stages for what I'll be teaching the kids this weekend at my  urlLink church 's family retreat.  Then, as soon as I get back, I have worship team practice with Jimmy Choi and Jane Park for a retreat next week... what a busy time.  Sorry daily readers, starting from Friday I must be off again for a bit of time.  I may have time to post on Sunday, but I promise to write daily in my journal, and type out the more interesting details after this week.  As is, tomorrow will be spent taking care of more errands, and preparing for all the hard work this week.  Well, again I pose this question, and I hope I get some responses this time:  What does it mean to "receive Him?" What does it mean to "believe in His name?" How you do "receive Christ in your heart?" What is it that you receive, a concept? Do you just memorize it, and say that you know it?

      "From Bal'mo' to Jersey, to Maine and back..."  The moment we got to Maine, it started to rain.  Go figure, huh? :-)  Good thing, by the next morning it didn't rain again until our last evening there.  Maine was very excellent.  We went to the spahklin' beaches of York County, since they were rated one of the 10 best spots to vacation by Money Magazine.  On the first full day there, we first went to a  urlLink nature reserve  down the road from our campsite.  The hiking trail at the reserve went through forest and had some spectacular views of the marshes and coast.  Afterwards, we found this isolated beach down the road called Parson's beach that wasn't crowded at all and had especially clean water.  White sand and very very flat, so the waves were gentle (and at some points, nonexistent... kinda like a swimming pool).  My parents enjoyed picking mussels and snails for some grub.  What a first day!  The next couple of days were spent exploring the whole coast in that county... the Yorks, Cape Neddick, Ogonquit, Wells (where we had camped), and the Kennebunks.  We found this one tiny restaurant in Wells that was voted the best clam chowder, lobster roll, twin lobster dinner, and clam strips in the county.  They were right... we had the best clam chowder and clam strips I've ever tasted... as well as some "wicked deals on lobsta'," as the locals say.  $4.75 a pound! What a steal.  We went there a couple of times throughout the weekend.  The next day, we went to another nature reserve nearby; the forests seemed to be right out of a fairy tale, like Lord of the Rings.  Bad point: Mosquitoes up the wazoo.  I lost count of how many bites I got... same goes for the rest of the family.  Most of them were acquired as soon as we got there and started to pitch tent, when were were not so wise about the area.  But oh! the food, the beaches, the locale sure made up for it.  We spent a day touring towns listed in Money: the Yorks and Ogonquit.  Incidentally, we also drove around the Kennebunks, where President Bush is still vacationing.  We drove by his house, which was on this really tiny peninsula of rock.  There were secret service checkpoints, between which we weren't allowed to make any stops. It was pretty cool.  Yum.  Did I mention the lobster?  The clam chowder, the clam strips?  The best I've ever had.

      Today the youth group went hiking at the same spot as the last time we went hiking.  It was fun, the kids had a good time, and now it's a cookout for dinner.  Sweet and sour short ribs, jalepeno jack muffins, and other delightful recipes from the  urlLink Food Network .  It is still a daunting task that I should be in charge of the elementary school kids.  I am not the best person when it comes to thinking of fun things for the kids to do and learn with at the same time, and it's a scary fact that I'm responsible for their spiritual education.  So far I have been teaching them memory verses, letting them do workbooks, etc.  I wonder what my father goes through as he thinks about spiritually leading the people in the church.  I hear that one of his weaknesses lies in his sermons being too academic, and too involved for the common man to digest.  Point, subpoint, subpoint of subpoint, etc.  This coming week, I start research. God, help me.

      One struggle these days:  reading the Word.  It's a bitter struggle to do it, and I am not sure why. This is how it's a struggle:  Competing Thoughts  Things that I haven't even considered to think of during the day crop up, and they're usually such petty things, like, "I need to shave now," or "My fingernails are getting a bit long."  When I really think about it, why do these thoughts and concerns appear to be so important as soon as I start to read the Word?  But, when they come, in my mind they become almost an absolute necessity.  I have to bitterly fight and pray to get them out.  Sadly, these days they usually win after, at most, half an hour.  Competing Desires and Feelings  These are closely linked with competing thoughts, but these usually don't necessarily come in the form of thought (though they usually manifest themselves in that way).  These usually happen when I am first considering about reading the Word, or as I'm trying to get into it.  I feel a very strong desire to do something else, or, simply to dwell in my feelings at the moment rather than focus on what's being said.  Honestly, I don't know why I've become like this.  Maybe I've been like this for much longer.  Regardless, my short attention span has greatly hampered my relationships with God, family, and friends, as well as my studies.  However, I do also know that God made me this way and that He has a purpose for this, one of the most obvious being the lesson of being Theo-dependent vs. Self-dependent.  What does it mean to be dependent upon God?

      As you can see from the last post, we all had a great time serving at Glory this week.  Joe, my little bro, learned the finer art of Powerpoint word display.  As for me, it was an extremely humbling, learning, and refreshing experience.  I made a lot of connections there (I worked angles, Jimmy, but not  those  angles like you did :-D) with other church leaders, and many of them knew my older brother from Rutgers.  Why Humbling?  I came in and for the first day with sort of an attitude. Not necessarily one of superiority or whatnot, but simply baggage from this year.  I had been really down because I just didn't want to adjust, I didn't want to serve with kids, etc., so for the first day or so I felt very anti-social and decided to listen to those feelings (as opposed to being God-centered with them).  As I started to interact more with the workers and the kids, though, God was very quick to show me how I had become.  I sure felt shame.  I also entered the retreat thinking that I was pretty good at guitar, pretty good with music, but once again, I was humbled.  I know jack squat about music, especially in the high-pressure time period of performance.  Everything flies out of my mind; creativity, sense of melody, etc... and even though it was worship time, it was still difficult for me to express what I wanted to.  However, that was good in that I really learned more to pray for God's strength.  It always seemed that when I did, I was able to gel more with what was going on at the moment musically and spiritually.  Worship times aside, either when we were practicing or just jamming, I could see how limited my view in music had been while I watched other teachers or Jimmy or Jane get into it.  I have much to learn, much to practice.  I was humbled with my lack of social skills.  These days I have sunk back to my pre-college days, when I was really depressed and didn't really want to reach out to people.  As well, I still say random things out loud as I'm thinking, and when people are around, they realize that I'm just talking to myself. So yes, I am weird.  In a related subject, my control of my tongue is really poor... I speak before I say just a bit too much.  Why Learning?  See humbling section... many lessons learned there.  As well, I learned some fresh things about the Gospel that I had not considered before.  So much work goes into running a retreat, especially a larger one such as this.  Why refreshing?  It was good to see kids learn and respond to the Gospel, to worship, to be with old friends again, and to make new ones to boot. It was good to get away from things for a while.  It was good to rethink my priorities in life.  I also thought of new ideas for this site.  On my spare time, I'll start working on it.

      "The Fall of Jane's Ego"  A Tragedy.  Cast:  Jane - Singer extraordinaire, the subject of this tragedy Dan - The Instigator, the agent of destruction Jimmy - a.k.a Vin Diesel, a.k.a. Triple X, a.k.a. Judge Dredd, the Instigator's aid in destruction Me - The UN-biased observer  Setting: Glory 2002 Retreat, The Catskills, Upstate New York.  Jane had an ear infection due to an ear piercing, so she needed antiseptic ear cleaner to treat it.  She seemed to be fine until the later part of the retreat, so she asked Dan, the retreat director, if there was any available.  Incidentally, Dan had recently gotten his ear pierced, so she was in luck.  He had a bottle of Claire's Ear Treatment solution (at which many of us questioned his manliness... the fact that he cried during Disney's Aladdin didn't help either), for which Jane was very thankful.  Little did all of us know, this little bottle had much to play in the tragic events to come.  After the retreat had ended, we were all waiting in my room to start eating Chinese take-out for our final meal.  As Jane stepped out of the room, Dan decided to hide his very feminine bottle of Claire's Solution in her purse, most likely as a ruse to cover for his lack of male self-confidence.  Most likely, mind you, but none ever knows what goes on in the heart of the other man, correct?  Luckily (or, for future's sake, unluckily), Jane found it in her purse after Dan had stepped out to take care of end of retreat business.  Not to be bested, Jane mustered up a plan to get him back.  We brought our belongings out to the parking lot and waited near Dan's car, as Jimmy left to get his tires refilled with air.  The moment was at hand; Jane looked around to make sure Dan wasn't looking, and quickly slipped Claire's Solution into Dan's bag.  Victory! Jane had won!  She rejoiced in her cunning, her easy defeat of the Instigator.  Oh, but the plot thickens like cold Thanksgiving gravy.  We all decided to meet up at a rest stop on the way home.  Many of the churches were there as well, so we all had our last conversations and partings.  Jimmy and Dan were off for a very long time, because his car battery had died again.  Oddly enough, though they came back to say that all was well and we were all ready to leave, they disappeared again.  Jane didn't suspect a thing until one of the directors suggested that they were up to no good.  Quickly, she checked her purse, and found that she was still on top.  Again she rejoiced, since they still didn't know that she had hidden the bottle in Dan's bag.  As we drove off, Dan decided to drive right by us.  Jane, thrilled with her victory, started to hop in her seat, exclaiming, "He doesn't know! I got him!"  Later, down the road, when we caught up with Dan again, he placed a sign on his window that stated, "I win."  Slightly perplexed, Jane rechecked her purse.   Ah! No bottle!  He still doesn't know! I have the upper hand! , she thought.  So, to show us her victory, she turned to us in the car, brimming with excitement, and said, "I can't believe it!  I've never had the last laugh before!  I actually won this time!"  At this point, Jimmy was unable to stifle a giggle.  Jane paled with horror at the sound of his laughter, and started to question him.  Though he claimed innocence, clearly, something was amiss.  Panicking, she turned and asked us to check her suitcase.  I turned, opened her suitcase, and, indeed, discovered Claire's Solution.  "NO! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!"  She grabbed the bottle and stared at it.  At that moment, those in the car felt it... her ego had fallen, crushed by the Instigator's sinister machinations.  In disbelief, she shook her fist and the bottle at the evil green Galant that bore the Instigator.  "I'LL GET YOU, IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO!"  At that, the Galant drove off into the sunset, never to be seen again.  The damage had been done, the scars were made, and Jane's ego was left cracked.  Watch out if you're ever driving on Interstate 87 in the state of New York... it can happen to you.

       A Ton of Bricks   In the earlier part of this week, I was really starting to get into preparation for both the praise night and for giving the message to the youth group on Sunday.  There some really key mental connections that I made one night, and I was starting to get excited.  The next day, my video card came.  I spent all day waiting for it, and in the meantime I played with the Marshall stack and my effects pedal.  Oh, but when the card came, for the past two days, most of my time has been spent fiddling with my computer.  Looking back, 50 percent of the time was very unnecessary, and now I am missing my valuable emails from the past half year, all the important dates and contact information.  So it hit me like the title of this entry: I fell headlong into idolatry again this week, and now all the time I was going to spend in preparation, and all the time I have to spend recollecting contact information is wasted.  Oh, what a shame.  But there's no use in dwelling in it.  I'm just humiliated :-)

      "A Day With Amanda!"  Today, Amanda from Wellesley drove down here from Pennsylvania to hang out.  It was good to see yet another good friend from college :-)  After showing her my apartment, we went searching for a part I needed (an S-video to composite converter) in order to hook up my video card to my TV.  We headed to Circuit City first, but they didn't have it.  They suggested we go to the Radio Shack down the street, but as we drove, it wasn't to be found!  So, 1we decided to go eat in New Brunswick.  We found parking and walked down the main street, and decided upon this pizza parlor.  As we sat near the window to look out, lo and behold, a Radio Shack was right across the street!  I rejoiced.  The pizza was good, but eh.... at the same time.  The downfall was that we ordered to have some garlic on it, but they used a really strong garlic with WAY too much salt, so it was a little much to handle.  However, we had good conversation, though I tended to ratlle off a bit.  I only really do that when I'm in good company, though, and Amanda's really cool.  I think since we share the same sentiment that all relationships, be it friends or more or whatnot, should be meaningful, vulnerable, and honest, we've always hit it off really well.  A great friend to have.  Oh, so yeah, we go into Radio Shack, and this guy walks up to us and starts relishing in this one song that was blaring in one of the radioes. It was a little weird, I have to say.  He went on about how great the song was and how we should have been getting into it.  Then, after I found the part and was in the process of buying it, he started to converse the clerk, from across the store, about how loud that stereo was and all of its virtues. Very weird.  The thing that bugged me was that the TINY little adapter cost TWENTY DOLLARS.  Ridiculous, but hey, I needed the part.  Oh well.  Afterwards we drove back, and, barely containing my excitement, I hooked up the video card to the TV.  Voila, it worked without a hitch! So, to test it out, we watched a movie that was on the shelf (Suicide Kings) using my computer.  It was definitely a lot better image and sound quality than the cheap Samsung player, I tell ya.  Oh, and we could now navigate the menus, since we didn't have the DVD remote.  After the movie, I couldn't believe that the day had passed so soon.  Oh well.  But, yes, it was definitely a treat to hang out.  Leslie (from Adoremus) was going to come down and hang out as well, but that didn't work out.  Thanks for coming down to hang out, A!  It's always a treat to spend time with you :)

      Yesterday, I didn't post because I was obsessed with my new video card.  It's working quite nicely, though it doesn't allow me to do one thing that I'd hoped it could do: DVD frame captures.  That's how I got that A.I. picture from my previous post.  However, I found that my older brother's laptop can do it, so all is well.  A.I. has so many incredible shots, so I sat there last night taking shot after shot of eye candy.  I don't know why I'm obsessed with art, in the general sense.  I love the arts in general, the ability to express truths and beauty.  I love, in images, when things lines up, or colors are rich and alive.  I love it in music when the emotion and the thoughts are expressed not just in lyric but in the arrangement, the way the players passionately play.  Yet, I still can't produce a full work on my own.  I guess that's why I haven't always been the happiest person, in some ways, because I created that expectation of myself and still haven't met it.  It's a bit too self-centered to be of any merit, I admit.  I think when I start to really explore God more, things will start to flow out more naturally :-).  The problem is that I still let myself get too distracted with stupid stuff like cheap entertainment, but it's a work in progress, and I'm getting there.  Cheers.

            From the movie  urlLink A.I.     Today was yet another productive/anti-productive day, and our apartment's cable connection has been going haywire until now.  Productive     - Fixed cable connection. I think. I hope.    - Listened to "The Main Thing" again in preparation for leading the praise team practice this weekend, as well as for my personal necessity.    - Spent time setting up the Strat... the intonation was still off and it takes a bit of time to do it, after every re-stringing.    - Figured out a cool guitar sound patch.    - Practiced a song for the praise night.    - Cooked dinner for my brother and I.  Anti-productive     - Woke up at 11:30.  Took two hours to wash up, and waited for the video card.    - Video card never came (though it was sent to be delivered at 8:15 AM), so I went to research lab, sat around for 3 hours doing nothing but browse the web and try to get some code to work, then left.    - Turns out that the video card was delivered right after I left. The didn't leave it, so they deliver it tomorrow.  Go figure.  Yesterday I watched A.I. and went bowling with my roommates and some of their church friends.  A.I. is an incredibly beautiful movie... the cinematography was breathtaking, to say the least.  As for the glaring plot holes and unresolved plot elements, eh.  The great acting redeemed it.  As for the themes, I can see how Stanley Kubrick a movie it was; he likes to explore the perils of technology, the perils of the "progressive thrust" of the industrial age, and perils of trusting in establishements in all of his works.  I think I'm going to watch it again.

       urlLink My new video card is coming !  Last night, I went bowling with my roommates' church and watched A.I. on my computer.  I enjoyed the movie, glaring plot holes and unresolved issues aside (If the Professor left to get his team, how come they never came back? And why didn't they search for the kid if he was missing?).  The cinematography was just incredible.  Every scene was filled with gorgeous hues and blends of color, pleasing camera angles, etc. The acting was superb, as well.  I want Teddy... much cooler than my talking Eeyore.  Yes, I have a talking Eeyore toy.

      One thing I don't understand.  I have a problem with my throat and lungs while I sing, especially when it's in public.  Some saliva or something always comes down into my lungs, so I end up choking.  It's really embarrassing and distracting, and frustrating.  In general, I've had respiratory problems in and out since I was a kid. It's not terribly bad, and not necessarily asthma, but it's just enough to be a nuisance.  I guess that's one way God keeps me humble.

      I am getting closer the the realization of how clueless I am with my research.  I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, though, I know what I'm supposed to be doing.  God, have mercy.  I stayed up till 6 AM today putting together prep materials for the praise team that I'm heading up for next next Saturday's praise night.  I cleaned up a poorly recorded message by C.J. Mahaney, "The Main Thing."  Oh, what solid meat that was.  Increible, senors y senoritas.  Muy bueno.  I also put together a mix of possible new songs that we'll sing, songs that they probably wouldn't know.  I have come to learn more and more how the Enemy works to slow spiritual growth at the personal and church body level.  He does it primarily by convincing or enticing us to listen more to our critical thoughts and darker emotions... because when we think or feel them, they breed self-righteousness.  Why would we ever want to think ourselves to be wrong?  We are very quick to always assume that we are right, and very rarely do we catch ourselves from going down that path.  I think 99% of the problems in church stems from people getting too self-important and prideful about what they think their church needs, what problems their church has.  When it comes to listening to leaders, they focus more on their negative feelings and reactions to the leaders' foibles and weaknesses.  Vice versa, the leaders can start feel the same way about the followers, they don't want to change what they're doing, and they try to exert their authority more.  Cycles of bitterness and resentment form, and thus the commonly known problems arise:  church splits, fights, and whatnot.  That's an oversimplification in many aspects, I realize, but I have seen it tear myself apart and so many churches apart.  I've grown up in the church, and I've seen it from both the elders'/deacons' side, the pastor's side, the members' side.  Self-righteousness is very deceptive, very hard to detect, so it usually starts small and end up becoming the key factor that splits the church.  It is only by Grace and through prayer that we come to detect it.   I hope that all of you that have been embittered by past, recent, or current experiences in church consider the following question; what is at the root of your anger?  What is at the root of your resentment?  Is it really reasonable, or Godly, to worsen your wounds with the salt of bitter thought?  Have you prayed and sought to see what is the most sensitive and encouraging thing to do at the moment?  I am still dealing with these feelings whenever I deal with my mom, and I think people in my church, and my family are as well.  I am not so sure why, but I really sense that the Enemy has hampered much progress in my church's growth in this respect.  But, glimmers of hope always emerge, and God has already used a lot of these things for the good.  For example, I see my dad has been getting more sensitive with my mom's feelings and needs; in turn, I hear he's been doing so more for the church as well.  Well, I must go back to work.

      I played Chrono Trigger, an old role playing video game for the Super Nintendo, until 6 in the morning today.  I woke up at 1 PM.  What I should have done:  Work on the powerpoint slides of the song lyrics for tomorrow's praise night Make the small group question sheets Prepare the key verses and what will be said between songs Work out technical details for sound and whatnot Make up an icebreaker  How could I preach that Christianity is a way of life, a life of worship, when all I do is try to satisfy my instant urges... to glorify myself?  What happened to "the life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me?"  What happened to "I no longer live, but Christ lives in me?"  That's what the theme of the afternoon/night is, that Christianity is life of worship and looking outwards instead of inwards.  Maybe this is all to teach that I'm getting too self-righteous these days?  Trusting too much in what I do?  But that's no excuse for laziness or self-centered hedonism.  Well.  Anyhow, Sprint PCS has been causing trouble, and I don't even have a phone or a number yet.  They never sent me a confirmation email in the past three days, though I was promised, "You will receive a confirmation e-mail within 24-48 hours."  Try 72!  Well, after more than an hour of being bounced around 10 operators (but hey, at least they were people not automated systems), I finally was able to piece together the exact department that was dealing with my order.  PHEW.  They said they'd take care of it, since it was backlogged due to technical problems they've been having.  So, I SHOULD be getting it by next Wednesday.  But, if I do get my plan, I'd say the trouble was worth it.  4000 n&w?  6000 bonus n&w for the next six months?  500 anytime?  all for $36.68?  That's not too bad.  The more daytime minutos, the better, right?  I was going to have dinner with my friend from college, Jimmy Choi, but he couldn't make it.  What to do now?  I'm starving.  Well, I should get going.  See you all after the weekend.  No Weekend Update for you!

      Check the following out from my  urlLink new link  (For whom did Christ die?):  "JAKE: But isn’t the difference really one of emphasis: that universal atonement emphasizes the love of God while definite atonement emphasizes His sovereignty?  JOHN: Not really. When you get right down to it, the difference is primarily not one of emphasis, but one of content. The bottom line is this: one doctrine proclaims the God who saves, while the other teaches of a God who enables people to saves themselves.9 In fact, J.I. Packer emphasizes this by saying that Calvinism has only one point to make in the doctrine of salvation: God saves sinners.10 The atonement not only made salvation possible, but it actually secured it."  another thing i've been thinking about.  Family is the context where your faith is really tested, because there are no barriers.  If you feel angry, you don't hide it with your parents or siblings.  That's the context where your real personality comes out.

      Tonight I played basketball in the projects of New Brunswick.  Yeah, I guess you can call it projects.  We had pickup games with a lot of these black kids that made a big deal about us being Chinese.  or Japanese.  or, "that other one.... does it start with a C?"  hehe.  They weren't all bad kids.  One was going to be a senior in high school, and he wanted to play football for Rutgers.  ***  3 more days till praise night.  Is my life really a life of worship? Today, I'm not sure if my life realy reflected my status as a child of God, a person that is freed to live Life.  I find it a hard thing to keep the message of the Gospel fresh and alive, to have my heart genuinely respond to its message.  If I have a hard time, how can I possibly live this life of worship?  But, I still talk with God constantly.  We're in a relationship.  How do I revitalize my end of things?  God, remind my heart what You've taught my head, that story about Your love.  Remind me so that I can be decisive about my actions and resistant to my laziness.

      Sprint it is.  Oh! There's this weird deal, for this week and the next, that they're giving out 6000 free minutes for nights and weekends, to be used for the next six months if you get it online.  Phone:  urlLink LG 1010   Something I was thinking about today.  Maybe it's a waste of thought, but I was wondering, how can one describe the feeling of liking or "falling in love" with someone?  How does one qualitatively describe the feeling?  It's easy to describe other emotions, like happiness.  Happiness is the state where one thinks and has positive feelings, is it not?  But when you like someone, there's this one specific feeling that I just can't find a way to put into words.  I feel it in my chest; maybe I can say it's like muted excitement.  It includes an overwhelming sense of longing to be with the person in question; there's that really strong sense of adoration for the person, regardless of perceived imperfections.  I wish I can say the word 'longing' would be another way to put it, but there's still more to it.  Maybe it can be described as this:  romantic feelings are when you feel pleasure, excitement, desire, concern, and the rest of your emotions in response to the person in question.  I have no idea why I was thinking about this, besides the fact that I'm a very emotional/sentimental type of person.  Too much so, in which I find myself rendered stupid when overcome by them.  Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.  How can we humans feel the same way about God?  About Someone we can't perceive with our physical senses?  Yet, God desires that for us.  How can I feel pleasure, excitement, desire, longing for God, in the same and even in a more intense manner than I do with romantic interests?

      Sprint or Verizon?  Opinions, please.  My options:  Sprint - $36.89 a month • 500 Anytime Minutes • 4000 Night & Weekend Minutes • Includes Long Distance • ~$50 bux for the phone, after $50 rebate  Verizon - $35 a month • 300 Anytime Minutes • 4000 Night & Weekend Minutes • Includes Long Distance • ~$30 bux for  urlLink phone  (the Samsung SCH-T300)  200 minutes for 1.89 more a month is really nice.  Would that be worth more than the perks i get with the really good rebate on the phone from verizon?  If you have an opinion, please tell me your reasoning. or experience with either company.

      "My Wife Is Gangster"  I did something tonight that I thought I'd never bring myself to do:  watch a Korean movie.  Yes, that's right, it's no typo, I watched a Korean movie, and it's title?  Take a wild guess.  Seeing as its title was grammatically incorrect, I steeled myself for what I guessed would be a typical Korean drama.  I was surprised to find that it was an action movie, but yes, it was pretty bad.  There were some moments, but it convinced me again about how non-Korean I am in taste, culture, and mentality.  As well, it convinced me how biased I am towards Korean-produced media and entertainment.  I suppose I should broaden my horizons, but I dunno... the past 20 years of seeing painfully sappy and cheesy movies, shows and music has burned that negative bias into my mind.  All of this brings me to ponder upon the age old issue (for me, at least) of identity.  I'm definitely American.  I'm Korean by genetic and physical makeup. But culturally?  I understand aspects of Korean culture, but not all of it.  The fact that I'm saying that shows how outside of Korean culture I reside.  When it comes to Korean food, it's not my favorite, but I don't dislike it.  It can be really good, but it doesn't give me the satisfaction that Italian food does.  Yes, I have more of an American taste in food.  As in, I can be made full and enjoy it with Korean (or Asian food in general), but my stomach and mind are more pleased and satisfied with American.  The same goes for music.  I'm not a fan of Asian, but Western music.  Well, aren't I happy about myself.  Man, this page makes me feel so narcississtic and self centered when I go on too much about myself instead of analyzing and describing things around me.  Ok.  How about this?  My roommate's old TV's been busted for a while, so I tried to fix it today.  I was hoping that it would have been just a blown fuse (the problem is that the TV doesn't turn on), but alas.  Both fuses were intact!  Bummer. I traced the path of electricity from the cord to the transformer to the circuitboard in hopes of seeing, maybe, something that wasn't right, but no luck.  I still can't figure it out, oh well.  This is one dumb entry ;-)

      Today I attended new grad student orientation.  Closer and closer to school I return. I sit here and think of what battles I've won, What battles I've lost in the war for Truth. It wages on in mind and soul Of all and one, in practice, in thought. Do I know? Do I live? Is it me? Is it real?  I can't write poetry. What am I thinking? I'm in the mood, and no, I'm not drinking. Stop reading this now, before it's too late. Before in regret, you mutter, "oh great."  I ran into the ex-girlfriend of this guy that will be a senior at Hopkins.  She had visited many a time over the years.  We had lunch and then went to College Ave., since we both had things to take care of (me, orientation, her, getting books).  Of course, she knew my name, and I had forgotten hers.  What IS it? Jenn? I think it's Jenn, I'm not so sure. Arg.  It was too embarassing to ask.  I'll remember it. Eventually.  Darnit, I used to be good with names, too.

      What a long weekend.  So many thoughts, so many things happened.  7 hour practice for this Saturday's praise night.  It went on so long because things kept coming up... be it technical issues, ideas, etc. etc.  I have a lot to learn about not being so focused on getting my musical vision of things, or the fact that things don't come together the way I want them to.  I also realized how limited that vision was.  Most of all, It was striking to see how much more important the vision, heart, and soul of the people playing is than the actual ability of the players.  Why? Music that has life has it because its function is to communicate life.  If the players aren't passionate about expressing what they're feeling or thinking about (usually both), then music becames mere entertainment.  I gave a sermon today to the youth group; I presented the gospel. Next week, I'll speak on how to apply it.  This evening, I cooked dinner with my brother and watched 2 movies.  Goldmember (my roommates had d/l it) and Amelie (DVD), both using my new setup with the computer and tv hookup.  Tomorrow's grad school orientation.  School starts next week.  Am I ready to start again?  Am I ready to tackle life?  Am I ready?

      Flashes of thought that hit me today.   Topic 1: I'm still talking too much.   The level to which that statement reaches is very deep.  Consider:  In the past two days and three nights, I've used almost 7 hours of phone time. That's right.  About 400 minutes. Well, to explain, I have been trying to catch up with all the people that I wasn't able to talk to all summer long, due to my lack of any phone services.  Oh, and free long distance is a big factor in that, as well :-)  But to get back on topic, when was talking with one friend, and she brought that up (since we discussed my verbosity previously) during the conversation.  I then proceeded to do exactly what I do not want to do, and I didn't do what I wanted to do.  The rest of that conversation was me blabbing;  though, I did make more of a concious effort to listen.  However, the level to which the statement reaches is this:  It's not necessarily the amount that I talk that concerns me, but the  reason why that amount is high .  I think the reason is that I think by speaking first,  then  evaluate and organize afterward, as opposed to evaluating and organizing my thoughts and then speaking.  That's not always a bad thing, and that's the way my mind works.  However, I do notice that I tend to share too much information at once, not in the revealing sense, but in the info overload sense.  I find myself then losing my train of thought, and I find the people I'm talking to sitting there with glazed eyes.  How can that change?  It's a very difficult thing for me to recognize, sometimes, because of the way I think and communicate.  How do I slow myself down and think things through?   Topic 2:  My issues with my "C"orean heritage.   It struck me again today as I met a couple of fellow BME grad students that were "yoo hahk seng," or international Korean students.  Yes, I don't speak Korean at all (You know, basic stuff here and there, but I can't carry a conversation or anything).  Talking with them made me realize how different I am from a Korean Korean.  How very different I am, if you think about it: they grew up only knowing Koreans, only speaking Korean, mostly eating Korean food.  I grew up as the only Korean on the block, only speaking English, eating so many different kinds of food.  Thinking about that made me wonder why I've never made a conscious effort to learn Korean, or of my heritage.  In fact, I'm a little apprehensive about the idea of visiting Korea, because I don't want to deal with people giving me stares and treating me in a substandard fashion.  I've already been subjected to that in elementary school; it wasn't pleasant then, it wouldn't be pleasant now, it'll never be pleasant in the future.  I think those environments of being forced to be conscious of my Korean background left  almost  a sense of shame and distaste for my culture.  I stress "almost" because I'm not exactly shameful of it, but it always leaves me with a queasy feeling whenever I'm exposed to Korean media.  I grew up forming the opinion that Korean dramas, movies, and music are of substandard quality, so now it's hard to think otherwise.  I'm sure that there is good stuff out there, but it's really difficult to fight this bias that's 22 years in the making.  I have yet to find/listen to a Korean music act/band that strives for artistic integrity and originality and tries to convey personal philosophical viewpoints with their lyrics.  Ha! Not that I would understand the lyrics. :-)  But generally, I find myself alienated sometimes when I see some of my Korean American peers getting into Korean music/drama/culture in general, because of that bias that I have.  I find it even harder to relate to Korean Koreans for the same reason.  That alienation then results in me wondering what I am, sometimes, but then I realize, I am American.  I embody the typical melting pot American ideal, it seems:  my favorite cuisine is Italian, favorite styles of music are British Rock, Jazz, and Hip Hop, I have many friends of different heritages.  Well, just things to think about.  You know, typical identity crises sort of things ;-)   Topic 3: Last Night's Dream   I dreamed about you.  You grabbed my ankle (how confusing!), smiled, and told me that my mom told you to do it. I'm still confused about that.

      Class was ok.  Tonight I hung out with the youth pastor from Agape, a Korean church nearby (My dad was pastor of Agape during a large part of 1980s, for your historical edification).  It was cool, discussed some things here and there about ministry.  I was on the phone, later that night, with a friend from high school.  Weird, she said that I was part of her conversion experience.  Kinda weird when someone says, "Hey, I became Christian because God worked through you!"  Wow.  I didn't know.  Praise God, huh?

      Start of a new day.  I'm about to go on-campus for class.  Thoughts about today so far:  I read/meditated on a couple of chapters of Isaiah, since I'm going through it these days.  It seems a bit abstract at the moment, since I'm reading prophecies concerning the punishment of some countries like Cush and Egypt.  What are their relations to the work of Christ?  What is God saying to me through these words?  Things to ponder.

      Tonight I called a whole buttload of people.  Friends from high school, friends from college, etc... it was like a breath of fresh air, I tell you.  I think a summer devoid of real contact with people built this innate urge to call so many people.  Thank you, God, for Your provision.  How good, how great You are, that You provide so much to someone that deserves nothing.  Blessings to count:  My apartment Getting paid to go to school Getting to know God The actual desire to know God Knowing God  Oh, but how little I know You.  How very little I make attempts to.  How could I not?  How could I rush through reading Your words?  I sense that, in my rush to finish and do something that, in eternity, won't be important?  I rediscovered this song that I really got into my freshman year:  'The Friendship and the Fear' by Matt Redman  Here are the lyrics:  You confide in those who fear You Share the secrets of Your heart Friendship give to those who seek to Honor You with every part  Though I'm one with unclean lips, Lord I am crying woe is me Trying now to rid myself of All the things that hinder me...   From knowing You, hearing You speak Seeing You move mysteriously Your whisperings in my soul's ear I want the friendship and the fear Of knowing You   There is one thing You have spoken There are two things I have found You, oh Lord, are ever loving You, oh Lord, are always strong  I am longing to discover Both the closeness and the awe Feel the nearness of Your whisper Hear the glory of Your roar...  This song always sends tingles up my spine.  I want this closeness.  I want to be at this point of intimacy with God where I sense the close friendship, and the reverent fear that results.  If I can only approach the Word and read it for the life it contains, not for this experience that I'm hoping to get.  A burning question that I need prayer for.  How am I to be fed?  I think God's put me in this point in my life to learn how to feed myself... but does that mean I don't listen to the Word being preached on Sunday?  Maybe I should go for listening to John Piper's sermons, as they're updated weekly from his services.  Maybe.  Please, keep that in prayer.

      Going to go back on campus to take care of errands.  But before I do, I jsut wanted to extol the virtues of my tiny new phone.  How fun it is to call long distance... without paying extra!  The first thing I did last night was call Jimmy (my old roommate).  'Twas good to hear from him again.  I also called Vincent.  Ahh, yes.  Texas and CA calls, with no extra charge.  Sweet.  And, with 4000 N&W, it's basically unlimited. ;-)  ok, I gotto jet.  next post will be about how my Biochem lecturer reminds me of Al Franken.  Actually, that's all I have to say about that.  Next post will be about other things.

      So tired.  Rutgers is tiring.  I walked all over campus, had to return home because i forgot my notebook, took the bus to college ave, and had to walk all the way to the book store.  I bought 2 books that weighed 20 pounds each.  Burdens sure are an incredible tool to teach about how great freedom is.  Freedom from weight on one's shoulders, figuratively and literally.  I received my new phone today! It works great, and is on the new Sprint 3G network, so it sounds really good.  Ok, that's today's update. I'm too worn out to say more.

      I find myself awake at 4:15 am, tossing and turning.  So much on my mind.  Going to Rutgers is a totally different animal than Hopkins, I'm not sure how I can adjust.  I find that in order to get all my details in order, I have to be 10 times more on top of things than I was at JHU.  Loans, registration, etc.  Life is harder in that I'm not sure if I'm missing something, whereas at Hopkins I knew exactly what I had to pay, what I had to do, when I had to do it, and where I had to do it.  Here, I'm still not sure how I'll get paid, I'm not sure what it is I have to do, I don't know when I have to do anything, and I certainly (nor does anyone) know where to do anything.  Welcome to grad school life.  Another thing keeping me up:  Do I life what I preach?  How am I keeping myself spiritually healthy?  My spiritual health of late is like my diet and exercise routine: I don't have an established diet besides what's in the fridge at the moment, and I exercise once a month, looking at my last month's regimen.  I practice not the art of meditation on His Words.  By God's grace, the past few weeks have been getting better in my prep for the praise night, but I'm am struck (as stated in a previous entry) about my genuine faith: do I life what I profess?  I preached the following last Saturday:   urlLink Romans 5:6-11   Life Is Worship  A worshipful life is a life spent in continual response to Someone greater than everything: see 1 Corinthians 10:31.  A life of a Christian should be a life of worship.  We are a royal priesthood, see 1 Peter 2:9.  We are living temples, 2 Corinthians 6:16.  Is playing 4 hours of Chrono Trigger an example of a life spent in continual response to Someone greater than everything?  When I think a lustful thought, am I being a living temple?  Am I a royal priest of integrity when I lie in order to save face?  What a body of sin in which I live.   I shirk so many of my responsibilities for the sake of the here and now.  I've done so all summer.  What a poor example of discipline!  Those thoughts are what keep me up at this wee hour.  Grace, grace, why can't understand and be freed by the concept of grace?  Free to LIVE?  I lose out on so many things in life because I go for the stupid cheapo lure of modern entertainment.

      ARG!  My post was lost.  Ok, the weekend is over, praise night was tough in the making but fun in the execution.  Today, I went to a potluck at my brother's friend's place.  Tomorrow, I start school.  As in, starting Tuesday.  I don't think i'm ready. Will I ever be?  The design process has started for the new Simplicity.  It will have more features but, i'm going to try to make it yet simpler.  How can that be done? We shall see.

      I had my first experience with the "RU Screw" today.  Just in case you don't know what an "RU Screw" is, it's the name that students at Rutgers give to farts in the Rutgers bureaucracy.  Basically, they didn't give me my paycheck today...  I was supposed to get it, or so I thought.  Turns out, the people that took care of handing in my payroll paperwork didn't hand it in until August 30th... even though they were all submitted in the middle of July.  So, no pay today.  Welcome to Rutgers.

      Am I just being pretentious with this website?  I've been having second doubts about my online journal.  I originally conceived this idea of having one during my freshman (or was it sophomore?) year:  to present the life experiences of a Christian in the modern day.  However, I didn't get a start on this page until www.blogger.com came out, because it tremendously simplified the process of posting while simultaneously giving me the freedom to present my site in any form I want.  However, at the time I was developing the site, I learned that web logging had been a phenomenon... man! I thought my idea was original.  Oh, but I digress.  My heart has been torn for the past couple of weeks in trying to define the line between artistic expression and sensitivity.  For example, if you've noticed for the past week, I've been trying to address what's been plaguing my heart for a very long time now:  one-sided emotional attachment.  When I first had the idea to record and display my thoughts and struggles on the subject, I questioned myself as to the appropriateness of it:  would it follow the vision of the site, while protecting the anonymity and feelinngs of the person in question?  I racked the situation in my mind and came to the conclusion that feelings will inevitably be hurt or disturbed by my expression.  But, I wanted to stay true to the vision:  this thing has been utterly consuming my mind, and if I want to be fully honest and vulnerable with my thoughts and experiences, I would be leaving out one of the biggest factors in my mental state to this day.  So, I started to communicate the reality of my consciousness, and it was quite a release to be able to communicate my grapple with my obsession; to me, it was definitely following the vision of the site.  This is the stuff that life is made out of.  This is the stuff that people go through.  This is the pain that, unfortunately, many of us go through, and I wanted to present my experience to show how Christ will work through it.  I still don't know how He will, but I know that He will.  But, isn't that pretentious?  As aforementioned, the person in question is inevitably uncomfortable and disturbed by my writings.  If stuck in the same position, who wouldn't be?  I tried to make it clear that it wasn't really herself but predominantly the obession that I was addressing, but I think a few times I did lose my judgement and did direct things her way.  This problem, then, brings to mind something that reddens me with shame:  am I so cowardly as to not deal with this with her personally?  Am I hiding behind my little pet project to deal with my pain?  Even worse, am I embarrassing this person in public?  She's never done anything wrong to me; in fact, she's always was been a good friend to me, and I've tried, albeit my feelings and this recent episode, to be a servant of Christ for her.  These ramifications grieve me.  What have I done?  Have I crossed the line?  The artist in me says, "Ah! Controversy has stirred... that means what you're doing matters!  Think of the artists that you like, think of 'Creep' by Radiohead... isn't that a personal song?  Didn't Thom Yorke have to hurst someone with that song?"  Yes, but Radiohead can be pretentious.  Yes, but I'm not really much of an artist.  Who has any right to be pretentious, anyway? The super ego in me says, "Ah! You megalomanic, you think this is about you?  You think you're at the center of attention?  Don't you care about others' feelings?"  I have no answer...  I'm at a loss inside for what it is I am to do.  I'm at a loss inside for what is the God-glorifying thing to do; have I mired myself in my flesh's thoughts so much, that I've clouded all of my judgement?  The fallen nature likes to sin, but it never likes the consequences.  The regenerated nature doesn't necessarily enjoy sin, and doesn't like the consequences.  The temptation:  why not just like it, instead of never be happy at all?  The answer:  the regenerated nature has a future, and has access to real Life, here on earth.  That's great... but... I'm still left in this position.  Have I gone too far?  Am I being to self-important with making a big deal in the first place?  The conclusion, when all has been heard, is:  I am a coward.

      Once again!  At the end of the summer, after much prayer, reading the Word, and internal deliberation, God made my selfishness this past year very obvious to me.  Instantly in response I felt grief and anger at myself, hoping and wondering if I can right the wrongs.  Reading my posts for the past week has convinced me that I have returned to the same state of mind... oh goodness.  Will I ever learn?  I wrapped myself up in my thoughtlife again, and I lose sense of reality.  God, You are gracious to reveal my sin and its consequences to me... and offer me the strength and means to live Life regardless of them, and only in regard to Your Son.  Strengthen my mind and will.  ****  This dialogue has been with you, apparation in my mind.  You're a fantasy. You're a dream. You've toyed with my emotions My fears were suaded by your seductive ploys  But you will not tear me apart You will not tear friends apart. You've done your damage, You've done your hurt  But Christ has overcome Christ rules my heart Christ brings me back Be gone.

      This is the time of healing.  It feels like I'm losing all my strength.  I feel like this summer, this year, I've lost my grip on life.  Tim for the past 3 years is not the Tim of the past year.  Then again, I'm the same.  This is what came to me today:  A fatal flaw:  laziness/fear.  Laziness is the fear of pain.  My laziness stems from my weak, passive will.  I see what it takes to do something, then shy away from it because my feelings take over.  In a sense, it stems from my oversensitivity to my feelings.  I think because I experience them so strongly, I don't want to face them when they're negative.  Hence, my wishy-washy, whimsical experience (Funny, a couple of entries ago, I wrote about Christ the Rock.  Goes to show how slow my heart is getting what's in my head):  This time is an example of my struggle as a Christian... being sensitive to my sin.  When I start familiarizing myself with the goodness of God and the perfection of Christ, I have been becoming more aware of the depth and the immediate results of my sin.  Oh, how I turn to it with every chance I get!  In this student environment, the effects are immediate: late assignments, frustration over late assignments, poor grades, missed education opportunities... etc.  I know what it takes to understand the subject:  making a strong mental effort to see what the teacher is getting at, trying to adopt the new way of thinking, reading the book and the notes... obsessing.  It takes obsession to know something well, and obsession requires a lot of energy.  When I see that I need that to do learn, I don't want to go through the pain.  If I love the subject enough, then maybe that'd be different.  But I don't love math.  I don't love Biochemistry.  However, I know that if I do learn these things, my mind will be able to see things in an enhanced and structured way.  Do you see the duality?  See the struggle:  I see the end result as greater, but I don't go after it because the immediate pain of doing something I don't like overpowers my mind.  How do I get the steel will, Lord, to break through?  How do I keep making those seemingly tiny, constant decisions to keep going?  Jesus, how can I keep going?  Please, Lord, teach me.  Give me that strength.

      The weather today is exactly the same as last year, besides a stronger breeze this year.  Same crisp air. Same sunny blue sky.  I don't think I've changed for the better as much as I had wanted, in the past year.   The thing that I resolved to do as a response to the day... I haven't done.  I haven't gotten myself focused.  I still get distracted by the stupidest things, by the stupidest feelings, by the stupidest thoughts.  But what's the point of this introspection if it's not done in light of the cross, for the purpose of regeneration?  It's just self-pity.  This afternoon, I'll try my best to fight.  I'm going to sit at that table and stay seated. I'm not going to fall asleep.  I'm going to study hard, I'm going to make mental breakthroughs.  I'll "break on through to the other side."

      Ok, I lost my good post.  I'll try to recall what I wrote.  It seems that the best way to honor those who died is to snub the terrorists' hope to instill fear in us... to snub it by living without fear, by living with courage.  It's easy to live in fear, but we who are in Christ don't have to.  In fact, we're called to do something different:  "Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God." - Colossians 3:1  This brings to life the well-remembered parable about the wise man building his house upon the rock.  Regardless of how we are assaulted by the storms of our emotions, there's a greater Truth that keeps us standing.  The solidarity of historical event and the promise of life from the most trustworthy person are enough for us to face our irrational fears and emotions and fight with a strength that is not our own.  Establishment upon the Rock enables us to look above and to hope in the promise of Life.  "Therefore,  since we have been justified through faith , we have peace with God  through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And  we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God . Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces  perseverance ; perseverance,  character ; and character,  hope . And  hope does not disappoint us , because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us." - Romans 5:1-5  What will you listen to?  What will determine if you will be left standing or broken on the ground?  Will it be the waves and storms of emotion, or the solid Rock in which you are planted?

      One of the most encouraging things I've heard in a while:  "okie i've been thinking about hope chapel a lot. and guess what the result is...I LOVE HOPE CHAPEL!!!!!!!!!"  When Laura came last year, I could sense that she felt like an outsider.  Plus, not many really wanted to talk to her (or anyone else new, really... one of my many frustrations with what i considered the heartlessness of some of the hope chapel college upperclassmen) and she didn't seem to be adjusting too well to Hopkins.  Maybe she didn't really feel like one, but I started to privately pray for her adjustment and try to welcome her.  To see her genuinely say the above statement is such a blessing; God has worked so powerfully at HC this past year.  So much prayer, the moment I got there...  Thanks God.  You overwhelm.  You broke my self-righteousness, healed old wounds, and strengthened HC.  Thanks.

      I've been here for two hours and did nothing.  So tired, I think I'll just go home/sleep/get up early.  Maybe that "get up early" part won't happen.  God, strengthen me to get my work done.  Or, maybe I'll just record some more.  ****  When you come up in my mind (which is often), all these thoughts come up.  In response to these thoughts, I pray for them to stop, then I pray for your well-being, then for my healing.  I just pray that regardless of the burden of me, you'll grow and mature in your relationship with Him.  God's jealous for your heart, infinitely more so than I am.  That always strikes me, and today's passage (see two entries ago) is an example.  God's jealous for my heart; not because I would benefit Him, but because He deserves to be the center of attention, and because it's for my sake.  Why, you as?  He knows that I would be the most satisfied if it was Him I desired.  It all seems so wrong.  It seems like I've screwed everything up.  I should go home now.

      How God astounded me today:  KING NEPTUNE NIGHT AT THE CAFETERIA!  I.e., all you can eat seafood... lobster, crabs, shrimp, etc.  Steamed, broiled, fried.  All for a whopping 12 dollars.  Oh, so so good.  I had 3 lobsters, umpteen crab legs, umpteen pieces of fried shrimp, and umpteen clam strips.  Even better, God led me to start developing relationships with some people on campus.  A fellow Hopkins BME alumni has started the program with me; I went to his place and hung out a little.  During dinner, I met this one guy who started his own performance shop... crazy! He owns five Supras (old ones that he rebuilt under the hood).  The one he drives around has twin turbos, NOS, and a supercharger... craazzy, that's about 850 hp to the wheels (not on paper, Jimmy).  He said he'd show it to me sometime.  Ministry opportunites You've given.  Thanks, Lord.

      911.  Nine one one.  Nine Eleven.  "The Lord says:   'These people come near to me with their mouth  and honor me with their lips,  but their hearts are far from me.  Their worship of me  is made up only of rules taught by men. Therefore once more I will astound these people  with wonder upon wonder;  the wisdom of the wise will perish,  the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish.'"  - Isaiah 29:13-14  Things like that day showed us how unwise and fallible humans can be, but I am not intimating by this passage that God let the planes hit out of punishment.  I decided to post this up because it came up during today's quiet time, and I took it as a direct rebuke.  I've definitely been paying more lip service than I'd like, these days.  My actions have been still impulsive due to my unbridled emotions (see any of the previous posts for prime examples), because my heart is far from Him.  Please, astound me, show me how great You are.

      Alexander Library @ Rutgers is pretty nice.  I like the architecture, I've already thought of good photos to take (with my brother's SLR).  I will get back to studying Biochem soon, I promise.  So, any musicians out there willing to play?  ****  I made so many mistakes, like making this thing inside me a public thing.  However, that's the point of this journal, full honesty into the life of a Christian in this culture.  Full vulnerability.  I believe there should be limits to what people see, and there are limits; I haven't said everything.  But maybe somewhere out there someone else is reading and sharing and understanding what little I've revealed on my experience, and seeing how God is working through it, how every road of my experience leads to the cross, and how my relationship with Him informs my daily experience.  I hope you understand.  I've been reading Isaiah for my quiet times of late, and I am trying to see what relevance it has for my passion for you.  Maybe I can make sense of it and deal with it accordingly.  I hope you understand.  This isn't a replacement form of dealing with the problem, and I will deal with it for real, eventually.

      I said this on Jacob's site, but I wish I could find musicians around here that I can start jamming with.  I really need an outlet and the experience, otherwise I'll always be a crap musician.  I can trick myself into thinking about all these great musical ideas, but without testing it in a live environment with other people, they can never be tested or shot down.  Anyone out there?  This is my plea for a drummer, bassist, dj, whatever.  ****  Why drag this out? Why not make our peace? Should I take the scalpel and sever our tie? Should I take up the lasso and reign you in? Should I repeat the past and let things fester inside?  Why are things this way: Discomfort for you, Yearning from me?  Who's gonna ride your wild horses? Who's gonna drown in your blue sea? Who's gonna taste your salt-water kisses? Who's gonna take the place of me?  I resonate with Bono's frustrated wail, but I stop and consider: I never had a place with you. You and I were never  we .  What's the use of all my hope? What's the use of all my dreams? You never shared either of them, did you. I always thought that deep down You did. I always hoped that deep down You had the longing. Aren't you glad that you're loved? But, I'm not in the horizon, I'm a burden.  This quicksand called unrequited desire has engulfed me. Will you pull me out? Will I escape and find another? Every moment I battle. Please reconsider. Who else thinks about you daily? Who else prays for you daily? Who else wants you to be happy?  But I reconsider. Do you respect me? Do you see my faults as grounds to turn you off? Would you accept what little I have to give (myself)? Is this enough Will it satisfy  I'm being selfish, aren't I Is this sin Is this hurtful I'll leave you alone, if that's what you want. If it'll bring you happiness If you'll find peace from my absence  Whatever you want. I'm at your mercy. I've always been at your mercy.  God, show me what to do God, show me what to say God, show me the way.

       If it wasn't for Your mercy If it wasn't for Your love If it wasn't for Your kindness How could I stand?  If it wasn't for Your cleansing If it wasn't for Your blood If it wasn't for Your goodness How could I stand?   - from "Where Angels Fear to Tread" by Matt Redman.  How could we stand?  ****  I still find myself thinking about you when I wake, when I sleep.  If you only knew how appreciated you are.  But would you appreciate the sentiment?

      Stayed up all night rewiring a bass.  Tired.  God, help me in this week to really focus and get my work done.  ****  One year.  So much can happen in one year, yet it doesn't seem like it's been that long already.  It's a cliche to say this, but it seems like it all happened yesterday. When I woke up early that morning, I remember jumping out of bed and with my newfound conviction to get into shape.  At around 8:50 AM on a crisp Tuesday morning, I went to jog around the block.  Along the way, I greeted two underclassmen I knew.  Definitely out of shape, I panted up the steps at 9:00 AM, ashamed that it was only a 10 minute run.  I showered, got ready, and walked to the library with my books to get a good head start on the first semester of my senior year.  Paul Han greeted me from an M-level desk, by the windows and the newspapers.  I don't know if it was him or Rena that first told me, but I heard the news as soon as I put down my bag.  "Did you hear?", and "Isn't it crazy?"  It didn't really sink in at first.  I thought it was just an accident, and that though some people got hurt, it'd be ok.  However curious I was, I sat down and started to unpack.  Then, I noticed that a lot of people were getting out of their seats.  More curious, I got up and realized that they were joining a crowd at the couches and telnet terminals.  They were all huddled around a TV that was set up on the telnet desks, so I pushed through to see what had happened.  It was at that moment when the towers began to collapse.  Chills overtook my body, and I stood, gaping.  I instantly thought of my brother, who works in New York.  Paul found me, and we went to John Tang's apartment to watch the rest of the broadcast.  During our trip to his place, the second tower collapsed... we sat and watched for another half hour.  Paul couldn't take watching anymore, and I was starting to share the sentiment.  The first thing I did was call home.  No one picked up.  I called again, and this time, my grandmother (who was visiting at the time) picked up.  Through my broken command of Korean, I realized that my parents had also gone into the city that morning.  Once again, I shivered with chills.  Next thing I know, I received a call about a prayer meeting.  I instantly got up and went to the freshman quad, and met Jon Chu and some others there.  The number grew to about 50 odd people.  All the ministries besides Agape were there... we prayed until the early afternoon.  People were trying to hear about their siblings or parents that worked at the WTC... we laid hands on them and prayed like we never had prayed before.  After people disbanded, I finally called home to find that my parents were ok, as well as my brother.  It turns out, he was on the last train in when it happened.  The next day, classes resumed, but obviously I couldn't get the previous events out of my thoughts.  I wrote a refrain in my mind, repeating the phrase, "it was the day the world fell, the day the world fell, on its knees, on its knees."  My brother told me that it was just crazy for the next couple of months as he continued to go to work (his office was near the Empire State).  The atmosphere crackled with tension, and he couldn't get over from seeing "Missing Person" signs strewn over every possible subway wall and traffic sign pole.  The smell from the smoke wouldn't leave for months, he said.  As the anniversary draws near, it brings back a lot.  In fact, it brings me back to the same state I was in last year.  I thought I had gotten over it.  I read up on account after account on why the Towers fell, on the engineering flaws that kept people from living, on the engineering strenghts that kept people alive, and pored over picture after picture of the hits.  It was all my way of getting over it... if I understood it, it wouldn't be so shocking anymore.  I was wrong.  At the time, it worked.  I got over the shock.  When Paul, Yogi, Ajin, my brother and I visited Ground Zero during Thanksgiving, I was sure that I had gotten over the shock after seeing the wreckage and the crayoned tributes from schoolchildren with my own eyes.  But, here I am.  It's an year later, and the shock has come back again as if it never left.  How can anyone forget?  People who weren't connected to it have, and they talk about it as "that 9/11 thing."  It unsettles me more that people make un-respectful mirth out of it (there is respectful mirth, but there's definitely more unrespectful humor out there), but oh well.  I still haven't gotten over it.  Will I ever?  Will we ever?  It's things like this that shock me to the reality of our frailty and our frivolousness.  God, I am frail.  God, I am petty.   Bring me back to the cross.  Bring me back.  Give me Life.  I won't forget the love You've shown, I won't forget the Love You've shown.  Bring me back.

      I have a major problem with concentration.  It's plagued my studies throughout college.  Well, I think I can concentrate, and do it well, but when it comes to the context of studying, getting myself into the zone takes a monumental, relentless effort of sitting my butt down.  I don't know why that urge to get up and do something else is so strong.  Today, I didn't get that much done.  I honestly did try, but found myself getting really antsy and unable to sit.  Later, I ate at Fuddruckers with my roommates and brother since they were at a softball tourney, and it made me realize how much I like it there :-).  I had a good chat with Lee Park today, it was good to hear how she was doing.  She's loving every hard-working minute of med school at Michigan. Kudos to ya, Lee!  My roommates and brother watched "My Sassy Girl" again.  I guess it's better the second time around.  Ok, I admit, I had fun watching it.  Time to sign off.  Later.

      "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because  we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope . And  hope does not disappoint us , because  God has poured out his love into our hearts  by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us."  -Romans 5:1-5 NIV  The heck?  How do I rejoice in this pain that starts in the middle of my chest and spreads throughout my torso, stifling me till I can't even weep?  How could I listen to and sing these following lyrics?  "Blessed be Your name And blessed be Your name on the road marked with suffering Though there’s pain in the offering Blessed be Your name  And when the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say, 'Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be Your name'...  You give and take away, You give and take away My heart will choose to say 'Lord, blessed be Your name'"  -  Blessed Be the Name of the Lord , by Matt Redman  How?  How can I get my heart to recognize this as a blessing in disguise?  Who could ever imagine blessing coming from deep, extended betrayal?  I'm bitter that I thought I was responsible for causing pain, but instead, all along I was being  betrayed  behind my back?  Then I think of Judas and Jesus:  "Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: 'The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.' Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, 'Greetings, Rabbi!' and kissed him.  Jesus replied, 'Friend, do what you came for.'"  - Matthew 26:48-50  Jesus, what're you doing?  You know that Judas, whom You love, is screwing you over...  You're just going to let Him take advantage of You like that?  "During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him..."  -Hebrews 5:7-9  God, I understand all this in my mind... that You did it all for our good.  But God, how do I actually make this heart rejoice?  I've even tried shouting at my soul to not be downcast, but it hasn't done anything.  I just don't know how to force myself to rejoice in suffering.  Yes, you're teaching me perseverance to teach me character to give me hope so that I won't be disappointed.  Yes, this is all a blessing.  You give and take away, but how can I get this stupid and stubborn heart to GENUINELY cry, "Blessed be Your Name!" in response?  God, please, teach me. You're the only One that can show me through this... You let me into it after all.  Help me to ignore all the naysayers that say to trust in myself, to simply just let go of something that won't let go of me.  Every blessing You pour out should turn to praise... let this be something that will enable me to praise You at a level so deep and true that those around me may be led to You.  I'm hurting.  Heal me.

      New U2 compilation coming out: Best of 1990-2000.  Only for you 90's kids, seeing as most people that grew attached to 80's U2 don't really like 90's U2.  To me, it's all the same to me at the core, I guess that's why I like them.  I previously posted the first line of the following lyric; now you can read the whole thing:   urlLink Moby  (though, the lyrics are sampled from gospel recordings)   In This World   "Lordy don't leave me All by myself  Good time's the devil I'm a force of heaven  Lordy don't leave me All by myself  So many time's I'm down Down down  With the ground  Lordy don't leave me All by myself  Whoa, in this world  Lordy don't leave me All by myself"  From  urlLink Radiohead's   Fake Plastic Trees , a song about disillusionment with the world of mass marketing and mass consumption, with our obsessions of image.  I'm relating to the disillusionment I experienced when my expectations and reality didn't meet on the street.  I won't stay down, but it sure helps to understand how I feel, so that I can fight it.  "She looks like the real thing She tastes like the real thing My fake plastic love  But I can't help the feeling  I could blow through the ceiling If I just turn and run   And it wears me out, it wears me out It wears me out, it wears me out    And if I could be who you wanted If I could be who you wanted  All the time, all the time "  Back to studying biochem.

      Last night, I saw "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" with my brother and some of his friends.  It was a really fun movie... sorta like  Meet the Parents  in the constant humorous situations that arise, but not as dahp-dahp-heh (frustrating).  The father was such a cute old man, from his extreme Greek pride (kinda like the Korean "Numbah one" biz) and his conviction that a spritz of Windex solves all physical ailments.  I related with the ordeals this girl went through, growing up in a Greek family... ie, related with the embarrassment and frustration with one's ethnic background, and the embarrassment that sometimes comes from being different.  Cute movie.  Definitely something you should go see.  Dangit, if only Windex could also get rid of this ache in my chest.  Ho-pah!

      The feeling was so strong today that I couldn't sit through class.  After a break, I had to leave early.  I tried fighting it as hard as I could, but people sitting around me started to notice the grimace on my face that I didn't realize that I had.  It was just too much for my puny self to bear.  I went home and have been plunking away at the guitar, since.  I'm wondering how I can be so affected by something so stupid, so stupid.  Listening to Moby's recent album, 18.  The opening line:  "Lordy don't leave me All by myself..."  sung by a gospel singer.  Sing it, sister!  God, please, change this stubborn, JUVENILE, stupid heart of mine.  I should go study now to just ignore it.

      Ok, so it took me a long while to fall asleep.  Why? Well, this feeling inside, how can I describe?  It might as well feel like taking an ax and splitting my chest in two.  in three.  in four.  Until there's nothing left but raw flesh.  Once again, I thought I had finished with this whole mess, but if new things keep cropping up like this, maybe it's time to just move to isolation in a remote Pacific island.

      Just when things seem to get good, things seem to happen to make things bad again.  Oh well.  I can deal with the ache, now that I've had it for so long, for different people, for different times.  This is my lot, who am I to complain?  Beggars can't be choosers :-).  All I know is, I can't let things like this get in the way of my life's normal functions, like studying and learning and teaching.  God, You never make sense, but in some way, I guess that's one reason why I trust You.  Life's too complicated for me to make sense, and when You do things that don't make sense or seem fair, that probably means You're just dealing with the complications.  Ok.  I need to sleep.

      Hello everyone.  Nothing much happened today, so I will not write about what I did today.  I have been working on homework and going to class today, so I didn't think about much today.  Therefore, there isn't much to say about what I did up to this point in time.  However, tonight my dad's coming down again to continue his series on systematic theology for my older brother's small group.  And tonight, I will be attending to some matters of extreme importance.  But for now, it is time to study and to prepare for tonight.  My friend, on her blog, brought up her fears about slipping into "a routine" in life.  As for me, I'm the total opposite:  I have no real routine.  Yes, regular class schedule and things to attend to, but there's no set time that I must get up to commute to work.  In fact, I have often found myself wanting to be in a good, disciplined routine where I can maximize my study, spiritual, and play times.  But, reading about her fears makes me wonder: is that what I want?  Rather, will my life be all the better if I have this rigid schedule to follow every moment?  Maybe it will.  Maybe I'll get things done in time.  Maybe I'll be less emotionally unstable, since I'll be on top of things.  But I ask... who is really on top of things in this world?  Just wondering.  Anyhow, like I said, it's time for me to study and to prepare for tonight.

      Problem solved.  Ok, so, the delay was that they needed an exact amount for my salary, but they couldn't get in touch with my professor.  He never returned emails or phone calls.  Once again, my professor seems to be at the crux of the issue.  Should I deal with it for the next four years?  I mean, it's not totally bad since I have all the freedom to do what I want, essentially... but then, he's really late and really slow about things.  Just a thought.  Today's studying was a lot more productive.

      "Vanilla Coke"  I just tried it for the first time today, and found it to be not as bad as I thought it would be.  Actually, it's pretty good.  However, it bears an uncanny resemblance (at least, in my mind) to creme soda.  Ok, let me just taste it again to make sure. *pause*  Yep, creme soda... well, maybe with a bit less "root beer bite", but pretty much the same thing.  I think next time, I'll just opt for creme soda.  Ok, time to try to fix my payroll problem.

      Had an interesting talk with Stan, tonight, and it was good.  He pointed out that I think too much, and don't act.  Yeah, I agree.  In fact, right afterwards, I did something to prove that observation of my weakness;  I won't go into details, but let's just say that I was faced with a temptation, recognized it, knew that I could have avoided it, but I followed through to commit the habitul sin.  So once again, I followed my old self.  Right, and I'm supposed to speak to youth group aged kids about the power of the Gospel to save us from sin, and about the fear of the Lord.  Yet, when I sin, I totally don't fear Him.  I forget Him.  I think that's the sin itself, you know?  Well, the repercussions have been felt, but you know, that's one battle lost.  The war's won, and I'll keep fighting.  I'll get it, one of these days :-)

      Darnit.  Glace and I were supposed to have dinner today, but because of a ton of workload I don't think it'll happen.  Maybe it will, but most likely not.  And I was looking forward to it, too! Oh well.  It's my fault, too, I should have handled my time better these past couple of weeks.  I've been asked to speak at a youth group praise night.  It's a little daunting... what can I possibly offer?  I don't even have any formal pastoral training.  God, help me.  Well, I am going to try to get that work done for which I'm missing a scrumptious dinner in NY.  See you tomorrow, folks.

      I'm not blowing up yet, but I'm pretty angry.  The lady that has been dealing with my payroll papers has not been doing a good job, and she's been very rude whenever I try to talk to her about it.  She just told me today that I filled my W-4 forms wrong and have to go in tomorrow to redo it... so I asked her why I'm having to deal with it now, when I took care of all this during July.  Ie, why did she wait till I didn't get my pay to inform me of the problem?  Her response?  "Come in tomorrow to refill in the form.  I have to go home now."  Of course, she took the day off yesterday, and it's 3:00 PM right now.  Who takes off work at 3 in the afternoon?  This is just ridiculous.

      I'm not a big fan of fads, seeing as I've always been an outsider.  So it makes me more unhappy that "blogging" is a fad, seeing as this site would be construed as one that was borne out of a bandwagon spirit (though I've had the idea to do it for a long while, since freshman year of college).  Ok, that's me being petulant and whiney.  This is me not:  I was thinking about closing down the site, after I had the idea to do this huge revamp where I would have an indicator for the nature of the day's entry. It'd say extraspective for entries that are observations of the world or are explaining, or intraspective for entries that convey my thoughts and meditations for the day.  Maybe I'll keep up the links, since it seems that people like the list of links that I've compiled.  Most likely, I'll keep doing what I've been doing up to this point, but it has been a consideration.  School has been showing me how tired I am of it.  I wonder a lot if i should be here, but it seems that the people God's led me to through the program are reason enough to stay on the boat.  So, I'm thinking to myself these days, less online journal, more real journal, less online time, more God time.  I'm not sure if my goal was met: an evangelistic chronicle of a Christian's life, seeing as most of the people that I know that read this page are my college friends, and they're mostly Christian.  Furthermore, I've now steeped myself in the culture of the technological age and find myself oversaturated and replete with information.  I've gotten much out of it, but I've gained little in terms of real heavenly rewards.  As for using the communicative powers of the internet, hey.  If you really want to see how I'm doing, just call me.  Or, I'll call you, since i have 3000 minutes left this month :-).  I think it's time to get back to real life.  I've lived in front of this computer for the past years to escape reality sometimes, and it's time for me to get back to my old self and get out there.  I'll still go in AIM from time to time, seeing as it is a good means of keeping in touch, and maybe I'll post on here from time to time, as well, to keep things interesting.  Bye.

      At the Steven Curtis Chapman concert, one of the natives that partook in the 1950s killings of Jim Elliot and his team of missionaries gave his testimony.  It was one of the most amazing ways to see how powerful and real the Gospel is... makes me see how shallow and trivial an understanding I have of its power and authority to change and give life to the lost... including myself.  I feel more lost now than I've ever felt in a long time.  If you've been keeping up with my blog for the past couple of weeks, you probably are familiar with some reasons for feeling lost.  I've felt so lost this past year, and I don't know why.  I've had and currently have every possible reason not to.  In fact, there were times in which I had at least a sense of peace about life, but overall there's still this uncertainty of life that constantly pervades my subconcious.  Feelings of emptiness and unfulfillment, waves of frustration, regret, and sadness wash over my mind sometimes.  I've addicted myself to the computer for the past... oh... 8 years?  I think if there's anything that has claimed my mind and life, it's this addiction to computers.  Well, more specifically, computer games, socializing online, browsing the internet, fixing and building computers, etc.  Sigh.  There's so much sin that lies at the root of all of this, and so much sin that resulted... things that have left me now forlorn and lost.  This entry doesn't sound so hopeful, does it?  Well, I do have hope in the fact that I can at least recognize these problems... and that Christ is eager for me to change.  Something that comes to my mind:  "This is what the Sovereign LORD , the Holy One of Israel, says:   ' In repentance and rest is your salvation,  in quietness and trust is your strength,  but you would have none of it .  You said, 'No, we will flee on horses.'  Therefore you will flee!  You said, 'We will ride off on swift horses.'  Therefore your pursuers will be swift!  A thousand will flee  at the threat of one;  at the threat of five  you will all flee away,  till you are left  like a flagstaff on a mountaintop,  like a banner on a hill.'    Yet the LORD longs to be gracious to you;  he rises to show you compassion.  For the LORD is a God of justice.   Blessed are all who wait for him  !"   - Isaiah 30:15-18, NIV

      "Weekend of Travel, Tribulation, and Lessons"  Friday night, I drove up to sleep over Jimmy Choi's house in Old Tappan.  Jon Chu was coming into NYC late that night, so we drove in to NYC.  Along the way, as we were engrossed in conversation, we ran through a blinking red light so a cop pulled us over.  It was such a dampener for the moment... it's also Jimmy's birthday, you know?  We stopped by Grey's Papaya to pick up some hot dogs (mustard and sauerkraut yum!), and had some interesting conversations about ministries... about the issue of authority, and how all of the problems in church history always stem from the issue of authority:  who has it?  Where is it?  Problems arise when leaders try to assume too much authority over the members of the church, instead of directing them to the Scriptures.  Well, I can go more into that, but I don't remember enough to explain... but it definitely makes sense, if you think about it.  After we slept, I drove back home the next morning.  I rested a little, then tried to go to my roommates' church's picnic, got lost, and had to go back home because I was getting picked up for the Steven Curtis Chapman concert in Philly.  We met up with some people, got cheesesteaks @ Tony Luke's (2nd best in city, supposedly... I thought it was realllly good), and went to the concert.  It was in Temple University's Gymnasium... I met up with the Hopkins crew.  So awesome.  Jane Park had also come from Chicago; she had a ticket to come to NY this weekend, so she spent time with Brian.  They both came, and that was a pleasant surprise.  The concert was just incredible, I'll write more later. Too tired right now.  Tribulation & Lessons:  I'm a worse driver than I thought I was, and I got lost for the first time in my life today.  Jersey roads are a lot more tricky than any other roads I've had to drive through in other states...  So many things that happened these past two days that I have to pray and think about.

          - Image taken from www.thespark.com  MENTOR ( S  ubmissive   E  xtrovert   A  bstract   T  hinker )  Like just 6% of the population you are a MENTOR (SEAT). Some would call you the most powerful and influential of all people. Those people are wrong.  The reality is that you DON'T really WANT to impose personal views or beliefs on others. Yet you are extroverted and intelligent, and you like to get involved. So you help others with the pursuit of knowledge.  You're the reason that people say, "teachers are also students." You are as much a learner as a master, and this satisfies you.   You won't die a lonely death, but towards the end you'll grow introspective, wondering if your life meant anything. This will last for decades, and you'll die after your spouse.  **** Of all the personality tests I've taken, this one has pegged me pretty much the best.  Submissive, extroverted, abstract, thinker... pretty interesting how that's pretty much on the money.  However, thinking about "Some would call you the most powerful and influential of all people. Those people are wrong.", I wonder.  What if I became more assertive, then, with imposing my views of others?  What if I got good at it?  Then I would be "powerful and influentional."  However, I guess God made me this way to show that He's the one that's so, not me.  Just a thought.  Here's the  urlLink link  to the test.

      I've had this concern before.  I still haven't done anything much about it.  Honestly, I don't know what I can do.  I've been addicted to the computer and to the Internet for so long now.  It has claimed so much time out of my life, it's kept me from being productive.  Rather, my addiction has, not the internet nor computers themselves.  Honestly, I don't know what I can do.  I've tried so many things.  I've tried to go cold turkey, in college, but that became an impossibility due to classes requiring the use of special programs for assignments, as well as important emails.  I want to get rid of this addiction. I have to.  This is just ridiculous, the amount of time I spend reading useless things on the web.  I find myself turning the computer on, or going to computer for NO REASON at all.  I just open up IE, and sit there, trying to think of things to type into Google to read up on, trying to go online and see who there is to talk to.  This is pathetic.  This is sad.  This is scary, because so much of my life has been wasted, I still waste it, and I know in the future so much of my time will be wasted.  Honestly, I don't know what I can do, but pray, and try to fix it, yet again.  This really stinks.

      "I never would have guessed that I would forgive and eventually love the man that had killed my father."  - paraphrase,  urlLink Steve Saint , at the Steven Curtis Chapman concert in Philly a couple of weeks ago.  I recalled this today through the most random thought process.  It started when I read on someone's website that she was going to go to Philly, and wanted to eat cheesesteaks.  That called, to my mind, Tony Luke's, the best I've had so far (but that doesn't say much, since I only had Geno's and Pat's, the mediocre touristy ones).  That called to mind the weekend that I ate Tony Luke's.  That called to mind the concert.  That called to mind the emotion and message of the night.  That brought about shame, because I had already forgotten, so quickly, about the Gospel, and that example that night of how it changes lives.  Read the story on the  urlLink website  I have linked up.  Something else on my mind.  It's been said to me that it's sometimes very frustrating to read this journal, because I always analyze but I never do.  You're right.  It's because I'm too sensitive to my emotions, not persistent enough to fight them in order to get something done, regardless of how I feel.  That's something I've always had a problem with; that's what I have to work with.  Ok.  Well, I have to go study.  Arriveducci.

      1:45 am, still doing homework.  I'm in my lab at school working on it, since the program I have to use for it is on these computers.  I feel really alone right now.  Not just "now" as in at this time, but "now" as in these days.  I think it's because of my general state of dissatisfaction; I'm not sure why I am so, but I just am.  God has given me every reason to be satisfied:  I'm in grad school, I live in a good apartment with my brother and 2 good roommates, I'm not plagued by any serious disease, I enjoy playing guitar, I serve at a church... and I know God (at least, at the miniscule level that I do).  Yet, I find myself unsatisfied.  I don't like my studies, at least, until I really get into it, but that's a real struggle.  I am plagued with these constant feelings of failure and inadequacy as a person.  Yet, I know that I am a child of God, and that's the only thing that seems to keep me afloat.  Call it a crutch if you will, but I've come to see that my subjective experience and strength are not very trustworthy; only this objective thing, the Gospel, keeps me grounded.  BUT, I still find myself plagued by a constant bombardment of these feelings and thoughts that I am a failure.  I don't know why they come, but they do, and at times, I give in to the temptation... I give in hard, and get lost in these episodes of utter despair and hopelessness.  That constant battle rages on in me.  Recently, it's gotten pretty bad to the point of my inability to function.  It's happened many times before, and somehow I've still gotten to this point in life.  Anyhow, to follow up on my day of "sabbath rest."  It wasn't much of one, though for the full afternoon, I did what I intended to do: I really got into a good meditation on the Word in preparation for this weekend, and came up with some things to chew on and refine.  However, I got distracted with other things and now, I'm doing homework.  Man.  I really need to figure out a better way to prioritize, to plan these things in a much more deliberate manner.  I'm slowly getting myself back into the groove of life, but I have a long road ahead.  This was a very rough weekend/week up to this point.  I just hope I can make it through the rest of it... not just for my sake, but for the sake of all those teens I'll be speaking to this weekend.  Speak to us all, God, please.  I'm all ears.

      I am finding more and more as life goes on that I have a weird love/hate relationship with technology, namely computers.  I spend so much time in front of them, yet they numb my brain.  Maybe that's why I spend so much time in front of them.  I am starting to see that I can't really think whenever there's a CRT of any sort within the vicinity; there must be some generated high frequency that bothers me.  Not sure how to explain it, but it's like my thought becomes scrambled.  Weird, huh?  Yet, I can achieve so many things with computers that I wouldn't have had access or the ability to do without.  I can amass huge music collections, manipulate them, create my own music, make images, videos, publish thoughts, communicate, process math for assignments... etc. etc.  Hate, Love.

      I watched the 2.5 hour MASH series finale rerun today.  That was one of the finest works of television drama I have ever seen.  It had great acting, great storylines, and although I didn't follow the show for its 11 year long pool of reruns, I didn't have to know.  The stories were so poignant, you didn't have to.  The only bad point was the character of "Soon Lee", since the actress that portrayed her did it with a Japanese accent.  Understandable, since Americans then (or now) wouldn't be able to tell the difference, but it was a little annoying as is.  As for the actress, she was Keiko from Star Trek Enterprise/Deep Space Nine, wife of character Miles O'Brian, and she was in the Joy Luck Club.  Today was another low point in my life.  Just one of those really hard days to get through.  MASH was a good escape, but it wasn't that much of one because many of the themes reminded me of what things have stormed my consciousness of late: nervous breakdowns, transitions, failure, close friendships, saying goodbye, etc.  Just one more day.  Just have to keep things in perspective.  Please.

I am starting to sense that there's a lot of spiritual battle going on, in relation to the upcoming weekend's speaking engagement I have.  Same sort of weirdness happened in my prep for last month's praise night.  Strange.  But, I must fight.

      "Weirdness!"  I had this dream last night that my old roommate and I were living in an apartment in some city; I couldn't tell which one it was, let's say it's NY.  We're hosting a party, but I couldn't find anything in the fridge that would work together to whip up snacks.  But, I found a lot of cheese, and I thought to myself, "hey, fondue is always good."  So we went downstairs to go shopping, and along the way I saw Christine Choy and Hanna Lee walking together.   Weird, they haven't lived together since sophomore year , I thought, but I walked up to greet and ask Christine what we would need for fondue.  "Jack cheese, fresh mozarella, and white wine." I scratched my head, wondering how mozarella would work in fondue, but she seemed to know about these things.  I turned to found no one standing there.  Confused, I looked around, but to no avail: gone.  In the meantime, Christine and Hanna invited me over.  It was weird, they were living in someone else's house, and were renting out one room.  Their room was dolled up very nicely, I must add.  By this point I forgot about why I had left the apartment, and I forgot that I couldn't find my roommate.   Why did I leave? Oh yeah, I left to go to orientation.   That's when the dream changed.  I went to orientation (for what, I have no idea), and as I was exploring the school after it was over, I found that Angela Chung was having a concert in this big hall packed to the full.  After it was over, I yelled to her.  She turned and turned and couldn't find me, so she told me to put my elbow on my head.  I did, so she found me, and that was fun.  My youth group kids were there, too, after the concert.  That was stranger.  I then woke up and took a shower, and this song was on repeat in my head:  "In my dream, I was drowning my sorrows But my sorrows they'd learned to swim Surrounding me, going down on me Spilling over the brim Waves of regret and waves of joy. I reached out for the one I tried to destroy. You, you said you'd wait till the end of the world."  --  Until the End of the World  - U2  I haven't had a good night's worth of sleep all weekend.  I go to bed hoping that I'd feel better, only to wake 6-8 hours later feeling like I had stayed up all night.  My limbs have no energy to move, my heart beats too fast.  Darnit, this stinks.  I have homework due today and a test next week, and other classes to catch up in.  I think I have to drop some courses.  Everything's been too difficult for me to handle:  re-adjusting to school life and to life at home church, this weekend's events, the demanding workload.  God, this is harder than ever.  What's the thing I'm supposed to do?  I can sense now what You want me to do, but it's too hard for me to sense it reliably with all these emotions running amuck inside.  All along, this pain has resurfaced in my chest.   Heh, it never takes a break long enough for me to recuperate... but I just have to get on with it, or else I'll sink deeper.

      Thinking back to the post about "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" reminds me of growing up being the only Korean kid around... along with all the resulting ignorance by people and its ugly fruits.  The funny thing is, us minority kids ended up sticking together:  picture a ragtag group of an indian, korean, and black kid.  Then again... I had a lot of white friends too.  It didn't make a difference to me then.  It doesn't now, either, I guess that's the reason why.

      Making  urlLink Roasted Root Vegetable Irish Lamb Stew  for dinner tonight.  I found some lamb in the freezer that's been sitting there for a couple of months, and decided that it'd be a good time to eat it.  Since it was only a pound and a half shank, it seemed to be a good idea to make it into a stew; stew = more food.  Let's see how this Irish dish will taste.  The result will be posted later.  ****  Once again, an advertisement:  does anyone from NY know a Christian female seeking a roommate?  I have a friend moving to NY from Chicago to start a new job, and she's hoping she kinda find a good sister in Christ to show her ropes of NYC survival.  Just leave a comment.

      Spent all evening and twilight practicing a guitar idea I had.  I love playing the guitar.  I really want to become fluent in the language of music. I would just love to express thoughts through scales and rhythm, through melody and harmonic chords, without having to worry about the technical details.  There's just that something about good, honest, heartful (not overproduced) music that speaks to me.  It is just so great to get into a groove and just express.  Ok, bedtime.

      ANNOUNCEMENT/REQUEST  Does anyone that reads this site live in New York?  For those that do, do you know any christian female that needs a roommate?  I have a friend that is moving from Chicago to work in CT, but she wants to live in NY.  She would like to live with a good Christian sister, if she can.  If you do, please leave a comment about how she can get connected.  Yes, Mr. Gentyle, Kangles are being worked, but this time not for me.  Please, no comments concerning "kangling." :-) **** Everywhere you go, people complain.  There's always something to complain about, something to be dissatisfied about.  All the conversations I find myself getting to lately involve me listening to complaints: "This sucks", "this professor is a jerk", "I don't have money", etc.  I just wonder, why do people complain?  To me, it seems to be done to gain sympathy and attention, in order to affirm self-importance/self-righteousness.  Complaints essentially say, "This isn't the way things should be, I deserve more."  Complaints are a declaration of ones' self-importance, aren't they?  The sad thing about all of this is that people find more pleasure in complaining instead of praising.  We seem to be so much more content about finding the faults in our environments versus rejoicing in their perks.  Another "why":  Why do we tend to enjoy looking at the negative more than the positive?

      "What do we want?"  Since we live in a society where the basic human needs of food, shelter, water, and sanitation are easily met, we're left with another need: what do we want?  I think when we leave "What do I want?" unanswered, we become dysfunctional.  It also seems that if we try to answer "What do I want?" with superficial things, we become dysfunctional.  There are so many levels of this question, and how we answer it:  "I want to be functional", "I want to be happy," "I want to feel right with the world."  When we try to answer "What do I want?", the answers to this question become our expectations, no matter how realistic or not they are.  These expectations become so important, that our lives become dictated by the desire to meet these different expections.  The questions I have:  why are we driven by this question?  Why is it so important to us to have a purpose... to the point where people kill themselves when they don't have one?  Why is "purpose" so important?

      Dreamed last night that I was going around with my contacts in, and they were causing me problems as usual.  Makes me wonder: should I start wearing my contacts again? They're so uncomfortable.  Since I have very bad eyes (-6.5 prescription), even though they're soft contacts, they're pretty thick, so it hurts my eyes more than normal peoples' contacts would.  Plus, I have to stare at screens and study much.  Oh, bother.  ****  It is another frustration that I have enough intelligence/skill to form an interest in many talents, but not enough intelligence/skill to really excel in any of them.  Either that, or it's my lack of discipline, or maybe it's God's way of humbling me from becoming cocky (which can very much happen).  Example, it's always been a dream of mine to write great songs.  But, for some reason, I can never really write anything.  I don't know if it's because I have the mental capacity to complete the ideas I come up with, or if it's because I lack the vision to carry them out.  Or, maybe it's both.  Or maybe it's just something different altogether.  But either way, I wonder if it's all because I am simply seeking attention and praise, not seeking to really impact others for their better.  Maybe that's why I don't have the gift.  Maybe all of this self-directed thought illuminates this hidden self-aggrandizing tendency of mine.  Oh, the possibilities are endless.  I might as well just get up and go to the library to study.  Ok, I will.

      Well, it's midday and I have to get busy with school work and errands.  Ahhhh, the grad school life.  Gotto love it.  Listening to Nora(h?) Jones, my roommate's been d/l a lot of her stuff.  She sounds like Macy Gray singing like Ella Fitzgerald.  She must have had an Ella cd on repeat all her life :-)  There's a very bossa-nova feel to her stuff.  Nice and chill, reminds me of Nicaragua.  Nicaragua.  It's 3 years since I went; that experience was quite an eye-opener.  The people we encountered were so loving, and family-oriented.  I wish people in the US had similar desire to be connected to each other; even with the past year's events, people are still disconnected in many ways.  We all just want to get on with our  own  lives, me included.  Ok, I had completed this post before, but it all got cut off.  This is frustrating.  The gist of what followed the last paragraph was,  in light of the ability to communicate with video/audio/text means, the absence of the physical reality of the person makes us more disconnected as a society.

      Biochem test is over.  Another oldie I remember:  "One day I was wondering what's it all about,  Life is full of heartbreak, restlessness and doubt,  Then a gentle Stranger, whispered words of love,  Pointed me to heaven, wrote my name above.  I know where I'm going, and who I'm gonna see, I have a friend named Jesus, waiting there for me, He has given something, that only he could give, He gave His life in payment, so that I could live."  A little better than the other song, but still shows the more emotional, subjective emphasis of that era of worship song-writing.  I still like it.  Anyone else remember it?  I have always had this arrangement in my head for it.  Maybe not a fully fleshed out one, but there's this sound in my head that I'm talking about.  It has this sorta alt-rock-ish feel to it, upbeat and driving.  But then, that's a bit hackneyed.

      "Give them all, give them all, give them all to Jesus Shattered dreams, wounded hearts, and broken toys Give them all, give them all, give them all to Jesus And He will turn your sorrows into joy."  Does anybody remember this age-old song? I can only completely remember the chorus; the first line of the first verse is, "Are you tired of chasing pretty rainbows?"  I think it's from the late 60s/early 70s, the melody sounds like folk music from that time.  There are some theological holes/deficiencies in the song, since it's derived from an emotionally-based mentality of Christianity, but it's nonetheless a good reminder of the sufficiency of Christ.  Back to biochem.

      Up until the moment I went up to speak, I kept thinking, "Even with all this preparation, it feels like I have no idea what I'm going to say."  But, it's over now.  That night really drained me; I notice that whenever I do this sort of thing, all of my energy is sapped out afterwards.  I'm still trying to recover.  But, enough about me.  Every day of working with the children and teens in my church is always a big lesson about how God is working with us.  They don't understand why they have to do certain tasks or be nice or etc., just like we don't understand why we have to be in our respective jobs or places in life.  This is an under-developed thought, sorry.  Estoy muy cansado.  (I'm very tired).  ****  Biochem exam is in two days.  So, I'm here in the College Ave. library, 8:40 PM on a Sunday night, about to start studying for it.  But my eyes are already drooping, I know that within 20 minutes I'll be falling asleep. :-)  ****  I'm still thinking about "Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold."  The strangest thing has been happening the past two days: the pain isn't there any more.  It just stopped.  I'm not so sure why God brought this about, maybe so that I can get focused with yesterday's speaking engagement.  However, it's starting to creep back in again.  I'm still determined to resist and not let it control me, but it's strange how these feelings have a life of their own.  ****  Kids go through a lot, and they have such strange, complicated social lives.  At least, the ones in my church do.  I'm hoping that they can really get the Gospel, and learn how it can help them start demonstrating more care for each other.  These kids have such a large capacity for it, if only they can see that.  I'm starting to see the real difference it makes when parents try their best to raise kids with Godly principles.  Those kids tend to be a lot more caring and humble and obedient.  They're not perfect, but they're definitely a lot easier to work with, a lot more pure and trustworthy at heart.  ****  It humiliates me more that as I see what kind of person I am.  I'm really not that rational, not nearly as rational as I had hoped/perceived/projected/wanted myself to be.  How shameful it is to see the reality that one is controlled more by one's emotions.  How can this change?  Or do I accept things the way they are... then see me go through life as if it's a constant roller coaster?  See me handing everything in late, doing things last minute, because I can't have the will to keep saying "no" to what I feel like doing at the moment?

      It just seems insurmountable, my weakness.  Here I am in my lab.  I've been here for 4 hours; I came here to work on homework, and I've barely done any of it, because I kept distracting msyelf with so many different things, mostly involving the Internet, again.  I'm here in a Ph.D. program, squandering away an opportunity that many people in this world would kill for.  It makes me mad that I still can't get my life together, that I'm so distracted by stupid television shows and information on the Internet.  Is it abnormal?  Why am I in this state of things?  Isn't it normal to be responsible with one's schoowork?  It's not just reading up on music bands or blogs or news stories, it's about my mind unwilling to sit down and focus on the task at hand.  It's been like this for my coursework all year, and frankly, I can't get why I keep doing the same things over and over again.  It's not even frustrating more, and as I right this, I'm not feeling any emotion right now.  This is more a statement of where I am right now.  Maybe this Ph.D. isn't the thing that I should be pursuing... but maybe it's the thing that God wants me to pursue, in order to beat my problem with scattered interests.  I really need some help.  I've struggled with this for too long.  I've felt guilty and frustrated for too long.  I've tried so many things to change, but I keep coming back to the same routine.  Now, I'm not frustrated, I'm just trying to figure out what it will take to beat this thing.  At that, I will announce a hiatus of my writing.  I don't know how long it will take, but I am determined to fight it.  Sadily, I'll still have to use the Internet because some of my coursework and research absolutely requires it! Arg.  That Korea article shows me what I've become: an Internet zombie.

      Just woke up from falling asleep at the library.  Man.  I had this dream that I woke up from falling asleep to see that I had come to the library with my brother, Joe.  My mom called me on the cell, and I listened to her talk for a bit.  Right after that, Pastor Ulysses from Remnant called me to return my message I've been leaving him throughout the week.  We tried talking, but the reception was to bad, so I left the library, and tried to drive home... eventually, the call was just lost due to bad reception.  Then, I woke up in my dream to find that I had fall asleep, and that my call with Pastor Ulysses was a dream.  Instead of Joe, I found that Jimmy Yun from Hopkins was sitting there.  I told him what I dreamed about.  He nodded with an understanding smile (which is kinda weird, since Jim usually had an uncomfortable smile whenever I talked with him) and said that he'd call Pastor Ulysses.  It seems that I had called him when I had fallen asleep and was sleep talking with him, and ended up cancelling the praise night.  So, Jim left to fix the situation.  Then, I awoke, for real, to find my biochem notes scattered next to me because I was holding them before I had fallen asleep.  I also had nasty cricks in my neck and back and a squashed ear.  I had fallen asleep in a really bad slouch with my head resting on the arm of the chair I was in.  I need to get a drink.  ****  I need to get out more.  I spend too much time inside and in front of the computer, these days.  Inside my apartment, inside my lab, inside the library, etc... always inside, in front of the computer.  Change will be difficult, but I think I can do it.

       urlLink The brainwashing of Korea .  I find that when I start inundating myself/turning to modern media, my mind generally becomes more frazzled.  It becomes this cycle of discomfort, turning to media for comfort, and more discomfort as a result.  Discomfort meaning, my mind is just numbed and not tuned in with what God's saying.  Curiouser and curiouser.  I found the lyrics below on my hard drive. I forget when I typed it out.  Fight  You've had me in the corner You've had me on my knees You've had my face in the pillow Screaming, as you pleased  You've snuck up close behind me You stole some life away Tiny moments here and there Precious thoughts, they say  I'm not going to stand here anymore Without putting up a fight, you be sure You've won in the past, you've won in the past But I'll start winning now, cos...  This Rock will break you down This Rock will break you down  ****  The "you" in this has been many things... particularly, that innate desire to be preoccupied.  Anyhow, I am looking around me at the people I see at grad school.  I see people like me, but at the same time they're not.  I feel so inadequate, not because of comparisons with my peers in my department, but in comparison with my ideal of what I should be doing with my time.  It's not good to dwell in these things if nothing's done, so tonight, I wrote out a long checklist of every single thing that I have to do in all areas of my life.  It's long.  And I still spent this past evening watching VH1 Behind the Music, The X-files, and Smallville.  My stupidity amazes me.  Though really, I guess I shouldn't raise such high expectations for myself anymore if I keep doing this.  I kid! I kid!  This editorial is finished. Time to sleep and get up early to get cracking at that To Do list.

I just hope it doesn't get stolen.  ****  "Why is purpose a necessary thing for human existence?"  In relation to a previous post,  it seems from the comments received, only one person really grasped the nature of my question.  Thanks John.  We had a conversation about it afterwards, and this is what came of it:    Me: our need for purpose Me: is God implanting His image into us John: yeah Me: animals don't have a purpose to live, they just want to live John: yes John: and even thinking about God Me: people need a purpose, so much that they're willing not to live for it John: and his creating this universe John: every thing he made John: and did John: was very intentional  In other words, I’m starting to think that the purpose… of purpose stems from us being made in God’s image.  God is the utmost being of purpose.  Since we are but a shadow of Him, a pale facsimile image of Him, we have implanted within us a facsimile of His trait of Divine Purpose.  This facsimile is our need for purpose  in order  to have an existence.  To reiterate what I just wrote, this is a facsimile, because God exists (He is “I AM”) and has Purpose, while we need a purpose in order to exist.  That’s how we are different from animals, and are made in God’s image:  animals’ only purposes are to stay alive, while humans want to have purpose more than they have life.  Think of all of why people are depressed and suicidal, why people go crazy, why it’s an ideal for people to die for their purpose rather than compromise it.  I wish I can develop this more, but it’s 2 AM. I’m tired.

      I had a whole slew of dreams that were really vivid last night, and I've already forgotten a lot of them.  One sticks out, and that's the one where paul, one of gentyle's friends, came over so that we could jam.  However, I was totally unprepared;  I didn't have a drumset, I lost my congoes, so he had nothing to play with.  Then, I decided I'd play anyhow, so I set my drumtrack going and tried to play.  I couldn't get on beat and my notes were all off, so paul got mad and went to the bedroom.  for some strange reason, there was this 3rd grader there that he knew and started to babysit.  As I walked to my room, the door of my roommate's bedroom opened, and out walked this 50-something Korean ah-jumma (lady) with this scolding countenance.  So, Paul decided to go home, and I went with him on the Rutgers bus... except the bus wasn't going on any familiar neighborhood.  strange.  It's dreams like these that scare me, because every time I've had a dream like this in the past, I end up encountering the strange locals and faces in the distant future... almost prophetic, if you will.  *shudder*  anyhow, I am mucho tired.  I tried to get up this morning, but it was really difficult.  I don't know why I've been so fatigued of late, in the morning... so much so that I notice that drool is starting to come out, and that only happens when I'm absolutely exhausted.  But, what is exhausting me?  Maybe I have sleep apnea, the condition where the airways close up while sleeping... leaving the person asleep without oxygen for as long as 30 seconds.  Is that why I wake up so tired in the mornings? Is that why I wake up sometimes in the middle of the night, because it feels like I'm suffocating?  Curiouser and curiouser.  ****  "Sweet Home Alabama"  I didn't see it yet, but doesn't it seem like it's a modern update of  Breakfast at Tiffany's ?  I mean, not an exact update, but its premise is really similar.   Country bumpkin trying to shed her roots, they come back to haunt when she least wants it to, etc.  Just curious.

      "Most people, if they had really learned to look into their own hearts, would know that they do want, and want acutely, something that cannot be had in this world. There are all sorts of things in this world that offer to give it to you, but  they never quite keep their promise . The longings which arise in us when we first fall in love, or first think of some foreign country, or first take up some subject that excites us, are longings which no marriage, no travel, no learning, can really satisfy.  I am not now speaking of what would be ordinarily called unsuccessful marriages, or holidays, or learned careers. I am speaking of the best possible ones.  There was something we grasped at, in that first moment of longing, which just fades away in the reality . I think everyone knows what I mean.  The wife may be a good wife, and the hotels and the scenery may have been excellent, and chemistry may be a very interesting job: but  something has evaded us ." [pg 135, Mere Christianity]  Clive Staples Lewis, you've pinned down my psyche.   urlLink Essays by Stan Wooh .  In the section labeled "The Call for Community," Stan touches on points that have been haunting me of late (see my post on 10/2/2002 9:09:35 PM).  Stan, your writings always impress me.  (hey, at least someone got something out of his major (writing seminars) during college.)  ****  I budgeted things so that I would have at least $100 left in my account after paying for bills and buying a bike. However, I found that there is a mysterious amount of about $130 missing, and I think it's due to Sprint.  They're overcharging me.  Yep.  I think I'm going to have to fight them, yet again.  Still having misgivings about Ph.D.  After the events of this past year, I'm wondering, how do I mess up every attempt to establish a romantic relationship?  The same exact thing has always happened ever since high school.  Girl of interest and I become friends, I find that it's one-sided, oh well, let's just be friends, or, let's just make new ones.  Every single person.  And I always get comments like, "You'll make a good husband", "You're a nice, sensitive, caring person".   It's quite humorous, in the sadistic sense.  I always seem to place myself in situations where I end up getting burned.  Well, I'm pretty much set in not really looking any more, at least for a while.  This is just too much for me to care about anymore, and if I look now, it'll just be rebound.  Life is still good, in many ways, and yes, I can't complain.  I'm still being lazy and irresponsible in many ways, as well, and it seems that God's teaching me to start focusing on Him, so that I stop being such.  All of these past events have been pointing to my New Year's resolution/prayer request, that I learn to love God more realistically and more meaningfully than ever before.  He's been supplying the answers, but in the ways that I had least expected or wanted.  Even though I have hope, I am still generally unhappy with who and where I am.  Why?  Why do I have such a weak grasp of my standing and benefits in Christ?  Again, I'm brought back to the issue of Ph.D.  What is it that I am to do?  ****  FYI,  urlLink the homeless guy  I have linked up  urlLink is really homeless .

      Me: you know Jacob: ? Me: the reason why a lot of things don't get done in life Me: ie, why we have so many half-baked ideas Jacob: ? Jacob: i would like to know Me: is because we are not deliberate with what we think about Me: we are not deliberate about fully thinking things out Me: we make up fancies, and create ideals out of them Me: but we never really think them through and never fully act upon them Me: so, lots of things get put off, lots of things don't end up getting done Me: because we're too impatient to sit down, think things through, and do them Me: it causes us and others frustration Jacob: hm.. Jacob: i can see that Me: we're frustrated because our ideals aren't met, and sometimes real life things don't happen Me: like, the ideal that "i'll figure out my finances" Me: or, "i'll study hard", or "i'll apply to and get that scholarship", or "i'll be in that next big rock band" Me: we are too quick to believe in the fancy, and too slow to count to cost Me: to count *the cost Jacob: hm.. Jacob: yes Me: another way to look at it is like a kid in a candy store with a credit card Me: he wants to get the big piece of chocolate Me: buys it Me: then goes into debt because he doesn't have the money for it Me: or, he wants the bar, but doesn't have enough cash in the pocket Me: all the kid could think of his frustration Me: doesn't learn Me: and then, does the same thing over and over again Me: that's me. Jacob: haha Me: i'm not deliberate enough with my fantasies Me: i'm not deliberate enough with my dreams Me: i dream, but stay in it Jacob: dreams are easy Jacob: not consequences for failure Me: nor is the realization of dreams Me: my prayer now, for one thing, is to be more deliberate with what i dream up Me: so that i can be more careful to evaluate and correct their source: God, or my self-centered, flesh inspired motives Me: and, that i can be more deliberate in pursuing them

      Temporary Break from Hiatus.  I am still awake after staying up to finish my Biosignal Processing homework.  Last weekend I went to Baltimore, and it was a good trip, even if I was only there for literally 12 hours.  Stinks, I wish I could have been there longer, but I read the train schedule wrong and thought I had to be back early.  Stupid me.  It was an incredible blessing to see the many new faces and hearts at Hope Chapel.  There's a lot of potential; I just hope that there will be a general thrust for relationships to keep going deeper, instead of letting things stay at the status quo.  I caught up with Rena, Chang Eun, Gail, and some others.  However, I missed seeing a lot of other old friends.  ****  I like travelling.  I like the Greyhound Bus, regardless of its drab and sometimes smelly interiors.  Every time I ride it, I think of how the Greyhound Bus is a microcosm of America.  People of all different classes, races, ethnicities, etc. all want to take advantage of the cheap fares and the rugged dependability.  Granted, you get what you pay for, but hey, who can complain?  I walked through NYC from the Port Authority to Penn Station in the light drizzle, noticing the dirty puddles in the roads and walks, and then thought occured to me... regardless of weather, there are always dirty puddles in NYC.  Even on the clear, sunny days, you can count on seeing dirty puddles in the dirty streets of NYC.  Regardless, I love NYC.  I don't know why I do, but I just love it.  I love the bustle, the tourists, the disgruntled (but brave) inhabitants, the overpriced food, the loud hum of traffic, and the lights.  I love the tall buildings, the resources, the possibilities.  Overall, the trip home from Baltimore took me 7 hours.  ****  The Tim Kang experience, at least, what is on my mind and heart 24/7:  I am trying to change my mentality about school.   It will slowly change.  I will earn to like it here at Rutgers, I just have to find my groove.  I will not waste my time with petty things.  I will spend more time with my hobbies.  I will learn how to ride down stairs on my bicycle.  I will learn all of those jazz scales, modes, and wacky variants of 7th chords and beyond.  I will learn how to express my emotions and thoughts into songs.  I will learn about Biochemistry, Biosignal Processing, Mammalian Physiology, my research, and current research topics in the Biomedical Engineering world.  I will spend more time talking to God and reading what He has to say in His Word.  I will spend my thoughts and energy in seeing the applications of the Gospel in my life and in the general human condition.  I will pray for my youth group and elementary school kids more.  I will apply for those fellowships.  I will eat my greens.  I will make that CD mix for my friends.  I will decide upon the Praise Night theme and compose a set list, practice schedule, and things that have to be done for the Praise Night.  I will meet up with old friends that live in this area and in NYC.  I will pray for my friends.  I will invest my time in them.  I will manage my money in an organized and responsible fashion.  I will not be on the lookout for potential partners of life.  I will not get sucked into chat and reading random webpages.  I will not play videogames.  I will not become familiar with TV plotlines and schedules.  I will not lose out on my life anymore.  I think when those "I wills" don't happen and "I will nots" do happen, I get really depressed.  No more.  The only grounds for my emotional well-being should be my status in life.  And, that is already established: I am a child of God, adopted thanks to the saving grace of God in Jesus Christ.  I know in the future I will get depressed, and I will fail, but the only grounds for my faith is not necessarily what happens to me, but what happened before me 2000 years ago on a cross, in an empty tomb, and from an open field on a mountain.  Be my strength.

      A couple of minutes ago, I was randomly looking at some pictures recently posted by a friend of mine, and I saw a person with whom I've recently had difficult experiences. Sigh. I had thought that I was getting over it, but seeing her again brought back everything. How could I be so foolish in looking at the pictures? I knew that my friend knew her, but I braved clicking to see the pictures anyway... I think my heart still hasn't let go as much as I had thought and hoped it did. No wonder it still hurts at times. Maybe it would be wise for me to stay away from the Internet for a while.  It is a sad thing that I had brought things to that painful point of rejection, again. It is a sad thing that when I fall in love, I become a millstone cast into the sea. It is even a sadder thing when, in every single romantic endeavour in the past, all the seas have casted me out to dry in the harsh winds of the empty beach.  This time around, God decided to rub it in on me that I had it all wrong, and that hurt all the more.  All this over a bunch of females who themselves are fallible, imperfect beings. Why do I let myself get so caught up in pursuing them?  Why do I quickly forget the previous pain the last rejection brought me, and make the same stupid mistakes over again? More and more, it makes me feel like I'm not really romantically attractive. Am I just too odd?  It is it my super-deformable nose?  Is it my obsessive tendencies?  Or, simply, God just doesn't want me to find anyone yet, and for His own good reasons.  It's at these points of thought where I realize that I still have a long way to go in my walk with God. They reveal that I am still trying to find my peace, my fulfillment apart from knowing Him. I find myself having to go online, having to blog, having to do all these things in futile endeavor to be liked, admired, and thought of as 'influential' in others' lives. I am falling into that same old pattern of trying to find my fulfillment in the praise and favor of others. That's what it boils down to, I guess.  God, I am the lost sheep. I keep going to places on my own, trying to create things for myself, when You are the one that knows what's best. Oh, let this foolish heart see what that best way is!

Starting to solidify details for my church's upcoming praise night.  God, please, have mercy, and do Your work in all of our lives.  Still trying to fight off those overwhelming sensations of lonliness! DANGIT. Why do they come in so strong, and so randomly?!  Dag.

      There are those people that are comfortable with losing touch with people.  They don't look back; instead, they are too busy dealing with what they're going through in life.  There are those people that can't stand losing touch with people.  They look back, and strain to keep the ties that they had formed with people.  Sometimes their current struggles are put in the backburner, and sometimes new struggles are created because they are refusing to let go of their social connections.  Since college has ended, I personally fit in the second category.  I can't stand losing touch with people I've come to call brothers and sisters; it is almost a matter of life and death for me to keep the ties alive.  This is a good thing, and a bad thing.  It is good because it keeps relationships alive, it strengthens ties, it maintains community.  It is bad because it keeps me from focusing on building new relationship with those around me.  It keeps me from adapting well to the new environments in which God has placed me.  I can't let go of who God has led me to know.  I also can't afford to live in the past.  Where do I go from here?  ****  'What do you do when the pains of life refuse to let you go?'  I pose this question because it is a question I have repeatedly asked myself, in one form or another.  I'm not really going through any painful experience right now, but this question comes to mind.  When I experience great pain in the future, how do I keep it from disabling me?  In the past, I have always succumbed to its piercing grip.  I have been rendered useless because the pain keeps me from concentrating on tasks.  Could the answer like in the Gospel that I have heard all of my life?  Can it be found in something to which my heart can be so unresponsive?  I am starting to realize that though I believe myself to be in a relationship with God, my life isn't always reflecting it.  I don't see myself being dynamically changed by the message of the Cross.  The instant response would be to find fault in the message, but really, the fault is in me.  I am too cowardly to truly face the facts it lays out, too scared to see the ugly truths of myself that it reveals.  As a result, I miss my chance of being changed by the incredible Truth of God.  It is my indifference and indecision that leaves me unchanged, not the Message.  We who think we are mature in Christ, who others consider as being mature in the faith.. are we really mature?  As C.S. Lewis says, when we are going the wrong way, the most progressive thing to do is to retrace one's steps.  To think that I've grown is folly, when I find my heart so cold and unresponsive to the message of the Gospel.  Some thoughts, that's all.

      Kite   Something is about to give I can feel it coming I think I know what it means I'm not afraid to die I'm not afraid to live And when I'm flat on my back I hope to feel like I did  'Cause hardness, it sets in You need some protection The thinner the skin  I want you to know That you don't need me anymore I want you to know You don't need anyone, anything at all  Who's to say where the wind will take you Who's to know what it is will break you I don't know which way the wind will blow Who's to know when the time has come around Don't wanna see you cry I know that this is not goodbye  In summer I can taste the salt in the sea There's a kite blowing out of control on a breeze I wonder what's gonna happen to you You wonder what has happened to me  I'm a man, I'm not a child A man who sees The shadow behind your eyes  Who's to say where the wind will take you Who's to know what it is will break you I don't know where the wind will blow Who's to know when the time has come around I don't wanna see you cry I know that this is not goodbye  Did I waste it? Not so much I couldn't taste it Life should be fragrant Roof top to the basement The last of the rock stars When hip hop drove the big cars In the time when new media Was the big idea That was the big idea  ****  I don't know why this U2 song pulls to me, but the sense of longing and forlorn emotions are what I was going through yesterday.  No, this is not a feelings update.  This is not a newsletter of my current emotional status.  Simply, another train of thought to be recorded.  Why does my heart become so randomly overwhelmed by these emotions?  Nothing happened yesterday to trigger it, but they swelled up and left me struggling to get anything done yesterday.  It is a mystery how the human psyche works; it is so difficult to tame. Thanks be to God for the Gospel, lest I would be in a worse place right now.  ****  Can't wait till the new U2 Best of 1990-2000 comes out.  However, now that I think of it, I have all the songs already... But I think I'll be buying both Best Of compilations, when I get the funds.

      Random memories of me being bad in childhood:  1)  In second grade, a friend and I were watching a riveting game of Battleship going on on top of a green metal box in of the courtyards of our apartment complex.  I realized that it was time to go, but my friend wouldn't budge.  I got angry, you see, because I was his ride home.  Back then we rode in two on our bikes; if we didn't have pegs, the second person sat on the bar right behind the handlebars.  So, since he wouldn't budge from watching the other kids play, I couldn't leave without him.  I pleaded, I tugged, but he kept brushing me away.  He didn't listen to reason, and my patience grew thin.  In anger, I walked my bike about ten yards away, got on, and rode the bike straight into his back.  2)  Around the same time period, the neighborhood kids and I were playing Thundercats.  I chose to be Tigra, because he had the cool whip and could turn invisible.  I took up a long nylon jump rope with plastic handles, and proceeded to whip someone with it.  3)  In fifth grade, I was at a friend's sleepover.  It was fun and clean until it was late at night, and the parents were asleep.  The friends decided, in excitement, to show me the sex scenes in Lethal Weapon II because I was the only one in the group that had not seen a naked woman.  I think the beginnings of the sinful way of handling lust began during this period of life.  Around that time, all the guys wanted to talk about 'who's hot' and female anatomy in vernacular terms.  I recall a rainy day where one kid excitedly came into the classroom with a soggy, graphic cover of a XXX video.  I didn't know that all of this was not a Godly way to view females or sex, until about a year later.  ****  A constant struggle:  It dismays me that I am so easily influenced by those around me.  I pick up expressions, ways of thinking, sentiments, etc. too quickly and deeply.  I lose my identity.  It reveals the weak will that I have.  It is because of this flaw and other personality traits that I connect with Peter so much.  He was passionate, emotional, and scared of people's opinions.  I have to make sure that I don't leave all of this introspection hanging, lest it be meaningless and a prime exercise of self-pity.  What do all of these episodes reveal?  — Leaving extreme passion unchecked causes me to do extreme things; if I am being self-righteous, I do very self-righteous things.  If I am caught up with my fantasies, I can do things that may negatively impact others.  — There are many roots of the ungodly ways I sometimes handle lust.  There is a lot of uprooting I still have to do.  — I fear others' opinions too much.  Other people end up having more authority than I do, let alone the amount that God has over my life.  In other words, I listen to my body more than I listen to God.  More to what I feel and see, than to the call of sanctification.  It is good that these things can be seen, so that the effectiveness of the Gospel will be seen more clearly when I continue to go through the cleansing process.  God, renew, and cleanse.

      Jacob and I talked about the dangers of being a passionate person (seeing as we both can be extremely passionate).  Our passion can lead us to delude ourselves into thinking that we are pursuing something good, and in the process, burn a lot of people along the way.  For example, some people can be really passionate about spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but if they are too passionate in the sense that their emotions drive them to do it more than the actual call itself, they end up doing more damage than good.  I think an important factor about using one's passion for good is the issue of authority.  Letting one's excited emotions rule us places authority on creation, not on God.  We can even delude ourselves into thinking that we're doing things for and listening to God, when really it is our emotions in RESPONSE to God's goodness that drive us.  I think that is a very subtle, but very important delineation that must be recognized and made.  There are so many things that I have done, that many pastors, that church leaders have done that speak to the dangers of that.  I won't go into supporting examples, but I'm sure many of you can list examples.  Passion is good, necessary and hard to find, but once we have it, it must be utilized with extreme caution and reservation.  For those of you who know Biochemistry, think about it in this way:  We all know that there is a LOT of energy stored up in Glucose, such that when it is oxidized all at once, that's a very high amount of energy being released.  But, the body uses that large amount energy by taking a little bit of it at a time, storing it in useful little packets of energy such as ATP.  The same should be for the highly energetic element of Passion.

      Hey.  So, yesterday was good.  Had Biochem test that wasn't so good, got back a Biosignal exam that was good, then went to NY, which was uber-good.  Good, because simply, God provided in so many ways.  I think the primary way He did was by showing me that I'm not alone.  I'm not alone. I'm not alone.  Walking through NY, I came across random friends from Hopkins, especially this one older sister that I had a great time hanging out with during my sophomore year.  What a throwback...  we had developed a system of greetings based off of the word "Yo", and it was funny that we still remembered it.  Melissa Villanueva is such a great sis, God really blessed me with letting me see her again.  He blessed me with Jacob, Stan, HanNa, Yeun Joo.  It was a great evening of laughs, memories, and stories up the wazoo at Carmine's and Edgar's Cafe.  I had not met Yeun Joo beforehand because she transferred out before I had come in as a freshman, so it was good to meet another alum :-).  Jake and I then stayed up till sunrise talking about everything.  What a great time of fellowship, of sharing thoughts and struggles, of expressing fears and joys, and of lifting laments and praises to God.  We always had a good, brotherly connection.  Today, gonna meet up with some peeps for lunch, then probably study all afternoon with Jake, then head back home.  ****  I love NY!  More like, I like the life that bustles through, and the fact that people are together.  Think of how the City of Heaven will be like... a bustling city of praise.

      Upon further introspection in light of the Gospel:  Introspection - While studying this morning for Biochem, I found myself becoming very emotional because I couldn't get the right answers to the problems.  This reaction has been a trait of mine since I can ever remember.  When I'm doing something with all of my concentration but failing at it, I get very emotionally involved.  I start complaining and venting my frustrations verbally.  In light of the Gospel - The cause of these emotional outbursts is sin. What sin?  Sin itself, ie, the declaration of self-sufficiency.  I expect things to work simply because I put my personal effort into them.  When my efforts fail, I get emotional because my expectations aren't met.  Patience runs thin, because, "it's supposed to work, this ideal I have MUST happpen."  But, that is sin.  That is my expectation of the way things I THINK should be, not the way that God has made them, not the way that they really are. To counter that sinful tendency, again, Christ is right at the door of my heart, reminding me that I don't have to worship those idols of my ideals anymore.  Things are in His hands, and are determined by Him, the Ruler of the Universe, not me.  Therefore, because He bought me, because His strength is in me, I have the confidence to realize that things are, in fact, turning out the exact way they should be.  What's the point of getting frustrated?  I just hope my slow heart can really understand this.

      I miss Hopkins, in many ways.  People, mostly.  Though, I'm learning, I really have a lot of foibles that make me socially awkward in the 'normal' world.  As in, I'm interested how things work, and I like to talk and discuss how they do.  At Hopkins, there were a lot of people that didn't care, but there was at least a size-able contingent of people that DID care, and in fact, cared more than I did.  It stimulated and humbled me.  People here in general (or, maybe, in the world), I find, could care less.  Hence, social awkwardness from high school, all over again.  Here, the humbling I get is that I'm too excited about talking to notice that NO one really seems to be interested.  Essentially, I have to learn more, again, that I don't know that much, that I'm too careless with my words.  Bottom line:  I'm really confused about myself. :-)  ****  1:14 AM  So, I'm home now, after driving home from the library where I just typed the above entry.  This addendum appears because I saw something today on the way home that I had never seen, and it made me think.  I had to drive through a flock of deer.   It was the most deer I had seen together in my life, about 10-20 of them.  Some were on the road, some were grazing on the grass to the side.  It was quite a sight; I had to switch on the high beams and drive at 5 miles an hour to scare them off the road and simultaneously avoid them.  After I circled the bend, I nearly hit another deer.  Why did this make me think?  The reason why there are so many deer like this is because there has been massive deforestation around the area to make way for a highway expansion project.  I haven't seen so many skunks, rabbits, deer, and other domestic wildlife before until the past couple of weeks.  It's quite sad, really, because they have no familiar homes to which they can return.  It recalls something else I read today:  the church that my home church rents out has recently been adding a new sanctuary to their building.  I read an article in the local paper that they had posted up on their bulletin board.  Apparently, during the '60s, the government had torn down their church in order to make way for a new highway then (I-287, ironically, the highway I take to get to this church).  That recalled to my mind a co-worker I had in an engineering internship a couple of years ago that went the same dilemma: when he was kid, he had to move because the government tore down his neighborhood to make way for I-287.  This brings me to what I'm thinking about:  the experience of dislocation, of not having a home.  Is it a Godly expectation to try to find our home here on earth?  Because ultimately, those who are in Christ have their home with God in the heavenly realms, so we'll have to go through an especially jarring dislocation from mundane existence to infinite glory.  How mind boggling is that?  It also brings about a reminder of the sadness and pain that refugees in this world have to go through, like the Kurds in Iraq, people fleeing their homes in Israel, and even us in the east coast of the US.  Our sense of 'safe home' was destroyed with the 9/11 attacks, and further blown away by the recent sniper attacks in DC suburbs.  We are now like the deer I first mentioned, because the seemingly secure existence we once called home was bulldozed by humans with a self-centered/self-righteous/self-important agendas on their minds.  Is the solution a fleeting ideal of 'world peace', an escapist ideal of 'this world is not our home', or, possibly, a combination of the both?  Isn't that solution the Gospel?  When Christ came, angels cried, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests." For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in Christ, and through Christ to reconcile to Himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through Christ's blood, shed on the cross.  We who know Christ are to be the instruments of peace on earth, though we ourselves have a home elsewhere.  It is us, the elect, those called by God to be holy and blameless, who are to work hard to find and implement the solutions to ills of the world.  We are called to be the salt and light of the world, of the communities we live in, of the places we work in, not just the salt and light of our isolated fellowships and churches.  It is not a call founded in humanistic pleas for tolerance, or tired pleas of escaping the pains of this world, but it is a call founded in the death, resurrection, and ascension of the Son of God.  The Gospel has redeemed men to do good works:  "For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men. It teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope--the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good." - Titus 2:11-14

      Took a 4 — or was it 6? — hour nap today.  So tired.  I just got up, with my teeth feeling all weird; I shouldn't have dozed off right after eating spaghetti.  Things God has been facing me with:  - realization of my self-righteousness, and depths of their extent which I did not realize.  I see it in the way I respond to people with whom I find much doctrinal and spiritual issues, especially when they think they're spiritual giants.  I see it in the way I respond to people who I can't relate with, particularly because they don't get what I talk about, and particularly because they talk about shallow topics.  It is striking to see how self-righteous I can be, right after asking God to help me with all of my faults.   urlLink The parable of the ungrateful servant  quickly comes to mind, in this instance.  - realization of my fickleness.  I find myself too easily swayed by my emotions and emotional attachments.  This battle between emotion and mind is uphill.  Intensely flawed.  ****  This one is for you anglers out there.

      I didn't have any access to their music while growing up, but  urlLink this  is just unbelieveable.  Why would anyone doe this?  Tupac, Biggie Smalls, I understand (to some degree) since that's 'the thug life' they always rapped about.  But Run DMC?  Who would ever want to take Jam Master Jay out?  Weird.  Man, I wish I knew more about these guys to properly make a proper tribute, but it is very clear that they are important.  I was watching a CNN Talkback special while was eating at the food court today, and they had the Sugar Hill Gang on as guests.  It is a striking thing to see that with the death of Jay, the reality hits hard that the 'foundation generation' of hip hop is getting older and will eventually pass away.  I just hope that some new artists come out with the same level of socially conscious and musically groundbreaking work that defined Run DMC of the 80's... because all that we have now is just the same vicious cycle of trash being pumped out by today's media.  "We are not thugs, we don't use drugs But you assume on your own They offer coke and lots of dope But we just leave it alone It's like that y'all (y'all), but we don't quit You keep on (rock!) shock! Cause this is it...  It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time It's Tricky...(How is it?) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky) It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time It's Tricky...Tr-tr-tr-tr-tr-tricky (Tr-Tr-Tr-Tricky) Tr-tr-tr.."  —  It's Tricky , Run DMC  (if you want to hear what it sounds like, go to  urlLink Stan's  site, or play the video game SSX)

      "The Language of Learning"  I have been up teaching myself the system of diminished, augmented, and 7th chords.  9th, 11th, and 13th will come later.  Seeing the systematic method of adding and subtracting nodes reminds me of memorizing molecular structures in biochemistry.  There is a pattern to learning them; it's just a systematic method of adding atoms and double bonds to basic structures.  This has started to teach me the reality of learning in the following light:  to learn how to do anything in life well, you have to become fluent in the "language" of it.  The simile starts with the subject of comparison, language.  Language is simply a systematic construct created for the purpose of  thought communication .   Though, sometimes it is not very systematic, seeing as we are also random, diverse beings.  Different people have a better command of language and thereby are able to communicate better, and thereby assigned the task of communicating life: hence, the poets, journalists, novelists, etc. of any culture.  These people communicate will because they understand language well:  they know their constructs of language so well that they don't get bogged down with details, they just express very well.  That is the purpose of all that training and workshop attending and paper critique-ing.  Apply this simile to music.  The language of music has the alphabet of notes, the words of chords, the sentences of chord progressions, and the grammatical rules of music theory.  Musicans are those that have a masterful command of the language of music:  as they create their masterpieces, they use their musical 'voices' to 'speak' the music.  Reading off of sheet music is directly analogous to reading a book out loud.  Arranging a piece of music is like drafting a letter.  The difference between crap and great musicians is just like the difference between an illiterate bum off the street and a Nobel Poet Laureate.  This makes me realize that if I want to be a great musician, first I have to be as literate as I can be with the musical language, and second I have to have the voice and artistic vision to masterfully express emotion and thought.  Apply this simile to science and engineering.  The language of either is mathematics and systematic rules drafted by observed patterns.  That is the core of the sciences of Western civilization.  Science is the arm that creates the language.  The good scientists are the ones that exercise their masterful command of the language of science to artistically develop ways to find, and to actually find new systematic rules.  The good engineers are the ones that exercise their masterful command of the language of applied science to artistically solve problems in this world.  Apply this simile to medicine, to sports, to any activity out there, and you will see why the greats in each field are the greats:  they know the language of their respective fields very well.  They are at the point where their energies are expended upon their task:  write a life-changing poem, shoot a perfect basket, design the perfect car, and score the perfect song.  I think if we  understand  these principles and  pursue  knowing our respective 'languages' as soon as possible, this world would be a lot different.  But we forget that life isn't just about careers and production, it's about caring for those God places in our lives —whether we love them or not!— and attending to the issues of survival.  It is then that we become frustrated, because we don't have time learn our 'languages' well or we can't use them to the capacity that we could.  Nonetheless, I think it is of utmost importance for people understand this concept.  There would be a lot less complaining if we really understood why we have to take whatever boring classes we have to take, why we practice scales 8 hours day.  In fact, one can extend this concept to include life, and life with Christ.  I think you can figure this one out again.  It is a special case where we are learning the language of life for eternity, and I think that is the key to bearing through hard times.  There would be a lot less complaining if we really understood why we have to go through hard breakups and unjustly suffer and struggle to make ends meet.  If we who are in Christ being to realize that we're learning the language of life, we'd find less room to complain because we have the hope that some day, the training will be over, and we can stand proud to say,  "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing."  2 Timothy 4:6-8

      "I'll laugh until my head comes off  I'll swallow till I burst  Until I burst  Until I..."  -  Idiotheque , Radiohead.  Regardless of what I think and reason, I always find myself in the same place:  despondence.  Why?  You got me.  The next lyrics speak to me as well:  "And it's you I see, but you don't see me. And it's you I hear, so loud and clear. I sing it loud and clear. And I'll always be waiting for you.  So I look in your direction, But you pay me no attention, And you know how much I need you, But you never even seen me."  -  Shiver , Coldplay  This is the story of me.  But, as I think about it, it is the story of Christ and us.  Except for the part, "you know how much I need you", since Christ doesn't need us.  But, He still longs for me to see Him, because He knows that it is only Him that satisfies.  Actually, what is the Biblical basis for that last sentence?  Anybody care to list some passages that clearly say that?  Anyhow. Oh, if my heart wouldn't be so blind.

      I had a good conversation with Lee Park last night about relationships, about God, about how we're both set to be single for a while.  At least, we're both content on being single.  No more depending upon romantic yearnings for emotional security.  ****  Looking back at college, there was never a time where I wasn't interested in someone.  Granted, I was really only interested in three girls, though I even tried to be interested in another one (I felt obligated to, don't ask why).  But, God has shown me, out of HIs grace, that I had pursued these situations the wrong way;  I depended more upon how they made me feel.  I depended more upon the excitement I got from interacting with them, rather than honest, heartfelt consultation with God.  I did do the latter, but it wasn't the basis of my pursuit.  The prayer and consultation were done to confirm the basis: my emotions and physical attraction.  It is quite a difficult thing to learn and recognize, especially for a pigheaded person like me.  But, now I am starting to learn, thanks be to God.  I have already started to see myself fall into similar patterns as before, but this time around I am trying to be much more cautious.  There is nothing wrong with attraction, but there is everything wrong with the way I start to respond to it.  God has been strengthening me to pray and talk with Him first, and it has been a joy.  I feel more free now.  ****  Back to work.  Adios.

      "Racism"  I can't believe that it still goes on in NJ.  I had to go through it when I was living in Scotch Plains and Fanwood during my childhood.  My brother had to go through it when we were living in Flushing during the early 80s, before all the Koreans flooded in.  According to the teachers and students, I was never Korean, always Chinese and Japanese.  Every new place we moved to, we had to prove ourselves to our friends.  Now, I'm talking to a student I know in Bergen County, and he says that it's pretty rampant in his school.  Teachers blame him and all the other Korean kids for causing all the trouble, for being lazy, etc.  Sad.  No side is perfect, but there is never justification for racism.

      From "What Do you See"  "No time to blink, but just continue to think of Scripture, Let it convict ya, focus get in to picture Watch it blow you square off the rector As it teaches you of the real Victor, Who prevails, you hear the crucifixion details Now ask yourself why’s your life still derailed, And why we fail to live for the One we nailed, This same Jesus, you know the One we Hail With our lips but not with our lives Time to see with the heart and not with our eyes See the Son, the One, who was hung like a poster Was buried, but popped up like a toaster Got all the host of heaven makin’ a toast to The King of kings who brings God and men closer  Sin’s roped ya, guns out the holster Can’t stay alive even with John Travolta Now I hope to pull you off the sofa Cut the TVs pause the CD’s, the culture Is in the midst of a raging storm The rage is on, obituary page is long Life is short, but casket sales are high, No surprise that numbers in the jails are high On the streets anything you want they’ll supply, That’s why beer, crack and weed sales are high Love songs making you wail and cry, Number of pregnant single females is high, Youth get high---deal just to get by, Doing street corner business with no suit & tie It’s “do or die”, truth or lie, you and I Refuse to try, and trust the Crucified   Yo what do you see when you close your eyes? What will you see when your life goes by? Think hard, visualize the ill mob Either you'll feel God, or your heart's real hard  Yo what do you see when you close your eyes? What will you see when your life goes by? Think hard, visualize the ill mob Bombarding, fatally scarring the Son of God   You gotto let this thing soak in... Sometimes we need we to reflect on what He went through for me, for you.  In light of His mercy, let us present ourselves as livin' sacrifices, holy, pleasing and acceptable to Him.  In other words, you believe it, live it."  - The Cross Movement

      "USA! USA! HOoooooooooooooooooooooooo!"  - Hacksaw Jim Duggan  You know, with all this 9/11 national pride hype, I am very surprised that we have not yet heard from the spokesman of nation pride hype himself, Hacksaw Jim Duggan.  For those who grew up watching WWF during the turn of the 80s to the 90s, how could you not like the man?  He was fun.  He spoke loudly and carried a big stick (remember that 2 X 4?).  He paraded around with that proud march and got us all to chant with him, 'USA! USA! HOoooooooooooo!"  He is another fond childhood memory.  I miss that man.  ****  Still I float around the campus on my bike, thinking, praying, hoping, wishing for me to live my life better.  I am twenty two, out of college, twenty two.  Lickety split, I have jumped clear from that furiously paced academic train onto the mezzanine, walking to the next line.  Do I take the 1,3,9?  The A C E?  The rustle of the stray newspaper awakes me from dozing off as I head uptown.  The past year I've been on this line, trying to escape the claws of mine obssesion, but I didn't 'stand clear of the closing doors' in time.  In time, I am thrown out, and find myself on the Northeast Corridor, headed into the depths of New Jersey.   God , I think/ask,  I don't like this, but I'm on this train.  I'm trying my best to find the seat, but people keep shoving me around.  All of these feelings keep welling up, and I don't know what I should do with them.  Am I in over my head?   Lickety split, I have jumped clear from that furiously paced academic train onto the mezzanine, only to find that it's a one-train-platform.  I get back on, hoping, praying that I can do right this time.  I get back on, hoping, praying that I can do right this time.   Maybe if I keep repeating that, I will find my own Kansas .  Girl, are you there? Are you listening?  Do you hear my heart beat, my prayers that have escaped my heart for you?  I have prayed that you would love God more than me.  I have prayed that you would understand my obsessive tendencies and love them and nurture them and become a part of my experimental mind, critiquing and molding the ideas.  It won't be just be me, it'll be us, and we can go to the stars with the space ships we dream up.  Girl, are you there? I can't find you. I kept thinking you were someone else, but I have found that maybe you're not in the horizons.  Treasure, are you there? Hidden pearl in the market, I would sell everything I own to obtain you, to love you, to cherish, to polish, to keep on a velvet pillow in the soft moonlight.  **** Time is too short to say its Ok To think I can live this way  For just another day  So I'll search through the night for the one my heart loves Wont stop till I've found You, for Lord I need to hold you close   Be the King of this heart again Be the King of this life In my soul there's a cry today Be the King of this heart  Be the King of this heart again  I've stood in the desert and thirsted for you I've run through the city now I wont let go I'm throwing myself on your mercy O God  You say it's all or nothing, I'm saying "Jesus, have it all"   Be the light for my eyes, Be the strength for my feet Be the love of my soul, be my everything  Be my day and my night, when I wake when I sleep Undivided my heart will be.     - Matt Redman **** God, what was that?  I'm looking for the wrong thing?  What was that?  I should be searching for a Lamb?  But God, why is it still so hard for me to be changed?  Why is my heart so hard?  You do all these things to soften it, but I keep saying 'no'.  Is my life the same I feared it to be?  I am doing jack squat for research.  I am doing the bare minimum, yet you bless me by more than I deserve:  I'm still afloat.  Can't you give me a love for what I do?  Oh, but that would be an idol before You.  God, why don't I have that special "it" that those music stars have?  Why can't I silence a room with the sound of my voice and the emotion of my heart?  Why can't I play deceptively simple but complex guitar phrases?  Can I be the guy that is 'strumming their pains with my fingers?'  I want to have that power, I want to change and impact people with my expressed thoughts and emotions through my musical language.  Yet, I feel like a 3rd year Spanish student, only at the level of understanding some words and phrases.  Oh, ok.  I see. That would make all the glory go to me, and that means that I wouldn't really be changing people... it'll eventually crumble.  Fine. So here I am.  What is to come of me?  All these dreams are gone.  All these hopes are gone.   You are the only Hope left.   Is this the point at which You wanted to get me?  **** Yours is my heart, from beginning to end. In the grip of Your grace, I will rest. Yours is my heart, my Redeemer and Friend For the cross is my refuge in times of distress, Oh Lord, Yours is my heart.  - Jimmy Choi  ****  Jesus, in this time of frailty, prove Yourself strong.

      "Paper Thin"  Quiet stares and furtive thoughts You see right through me. All the nervous laughing and silly joking You see right through me.  Where do we go from here?  My skin is paper thin.  What do You want from me?  These walls are paper thin.   Here I am, mouthing the denial You agree with me. Here I am, trying to know Your words You're here with me.  Where do we go from here?  My thoughts are paper thin.  Please, protect me.  My heart is paper thin.   ****  Sitting here, thinking about today so far.  Woke up, posted the last entry.  Made 'lunch', went to class.  Typed out a track listing and commentary for a mix that I made for the praise night drummer, then sent it off.  Came home, did laundry, prepared sushi for dinner, and since then I've been figuring out my bills & budget.  Still haven't started to study yet... phew!  What a long night this is going to be.  Thank you, God, for providing for me in all of these things. We do live in Your beautiful world... yeah we do, yeah we do.

      "The Dream Bandwagon"  So, seeing as the recent fad started by the great Yake, I present this morning's brain farts.  I was travelling downtown of this generic city (more along the lines of Baltimore and Philly, not NY & LA) with my brother's co-worker, Isabel.  It was strang, because we were supposed to be picking something up, and since we knew each other because of my brother, we sat next to each other in the bus.  When we reached our destination, the dream jumped to the point after we got what we needed.  Needing a ride home, we ran into someone that I knew (not really someone I know in real life, but a character created by my mind) that was willing to give us a ride.  We walked for a couple of blocks and found that her car was a truck.  More like, one of htose armored cars that banks use to move money, except the side slide opn to reveal rows of seats.  "Hey, I know you! You always drive this to the hospital where I work!" exclaimed Isabel.   Since when did she work at the hospital?   At this point, the dream shifted.  I was playing this poorly rendered 3D helicopter simulator game, but as I started to play, the dream shifted again, and I was now piloting a remote control helicopter.  After playing with that for a while, the dream shifted yet again to a window at the Carlisle Apartments near Hopknis.  I was with a bunch of kids trying to fly the helicopter from the room window we were at to a window across the way.  The apartments, if viewed from the top, are shaped like a big C; we were in the beginning of the bottom bend of the C, the other group was in the bottom tip of the C.  To ensure that the helicopter wouldn't crash, we had thrown a string across the way to link us together, and threaded it through one of the helicopter's runners.  Suddenly, one of the kids jumped out of the window.  I panicked at first, but out of nowhere, a rooftop materialized between the rooms.   Oh yeah, that's always been there , I reasoned.  The dream shifted again to the room I was in becoming a haunted room.  There were a handful of people besides me, none of which I knew, and it seemed like we were in a classroom.  The teacher in the room apparently knew the two ghosts: one an old man, one a mean old lady.  The old man looked like the nice old guy from the 80's helicopter action show 'Airwolf'  (He's been in a lot of other stuff, but that's probably the most memorable for me).  So, I was trying to do something to call back the other one; there was this pendulum that started to swing weirdly, and I had this little plastic toy strung up (don't ask) near it, so that it would bring her out.  She then came out and started to grumble, and then, started to say things from a book I had open.  I realized that they were blasphemous things against Christ, and that's when it dawned upon me:  there's no such thing as ghosts, only demons, and they were very clearly demons, because of what 'she' was saying.  Oddly enough, Yakob was sitting there as if he were there along, and we were agreeing that it had to be demons.  That's when I woke up.  ****  Did you notice that dreams (brain farts) can simply be randomly strung thoughts, strung together by weird and non-sensical ties?  For example, that last whole sequence was linked by helicopters.  Ok, time to live.

      Well, anyhow.  Start of a new week.  What will it bring?  Hopes:  - Less computer time - Less wallowing in feelings - More work time - More music time - More God time  God, because of my standing in Christ, please provide the strength to do the above.

      Again, from Danny:  "So this bear and this rabbit are in the woods taking a crap (why do they call it "taking a crap", when you're not taking it anywhere? you're actually leaving it) when the bear turns to the rabbit and asks "Hey, do you ever have problems with poop sticking to your fur?" The rabbit then turns to the bear, thinking fortunately and somewhat highly of himself, and replies, "Nope." The bear says "Oh, nice." Then, just as the rabbit's about to reply with a proud "yup" the bear picks up the rabbit and wipes his butt with it."

      "Grace"  The grace of God is a concept that has always eluded my heart.  Most of the things that I attribute to His Grace are pretty trivial, albeit, true.  Things like, my livelihood.  But, still, there is that oomph that I just still can't get.  Why?  Why am I still not fully and deeply affected by the message of the cross?  It is because of this absence of connection that I see my life always stuck in the same viscious cycles.  For example, I want to change the way I handle my emotions, but I'm too emotional to steel my will to carry out the conviction.  Another example:  since when I have become so petty?  Have I always been so petty, so easily annoyed at the stupidest things?  I find myself frequently in a whining mood, and then, after I try to change it, I slip back into this emotional, whiney, critical spirit.  An example of this tendency JUST happened recently, and though I thought I was joking, afterwards, I realized that I wasn't.  It's quite a humiliating thing to see oneself in such a state: out of control.  I attribute most of my problems to this inability/refusal of my heart/psyche to fully sit at the foot of the Cross and bare everything.  My lack of confidence, my laziness, my emotionally driven personality all seem to stem from my slow response to the Good News of Grace.  This is real. This is honest.  I cannot put up any pretense of holiness or righteousness, this is where I am and have always been:  struggling with myself to get the Gospel, to get God, to get life.  Mixed in there are my latent obssessions to be a good musician and to be held in the high esteem by others.  These are things that need to be fought.  God gave me a need for companionship in order to feel complete; I guess that's what makes me the extrovert.  ****  God was really gracious today in providing for youth group's first fundraiser for the drumset.  We made quadruple the amount of money that we had expected to make, and afterwards, I was stopped by an elder and the director of music for questioning.  I'm happy that the parents are starting to notice their kids being pro-active and responsible.  Sadly, I notice that Korean parents tend to give younger people little credit, but I hope it's things like this that will start to change that.  ****  I have noticed that even so soon after experiencing the pain of heartache, I find this fickle heart quickly on the prowl for someone new to attach itself.  If you couldn't tell already from my last post, when I fall, I fall hard;  it's something about that intimate exchange of thought, experience, and emotion that draws my heart to long for a strong, deep, meaningful, romantic relationship.  I think it is because of this tendency that feeds into this constant feeling of lonliness.  No self-pity here, but I'm simply trying to do some good, Christ-centered introspection so that I can GET this Gospel, so that I CAN change.  What a long road this is.

      "Naïve - Showing or characterized by a lack of sophistication and critical judgment."  —  urlLink www.dictionary.com   Frustration erupts after I review my limitations, my faults, and the problems that ensue as a result. I think about one particular scenario in my life, and it surprises me that I find my heart still angry, my mind still repeating things like,  "How can someone be so naïve?"  I think also about my own naiveté about that particular scenario and many others, and I am shamed.  It's one of those periods of time where it seems like I just don't have what it takes to make it anywhere in life except for doing deadpeat, menial tasks for a living.  It's one of those periods where I feel like I'll never meet anyone, since I've never met anyone that felt the same way.  But after seeing so many broken relationships, I'm not going to be tempted by the 'grass that looks greener,' since in my mind I know that being in a relationship with a girl isn't much better than enjoying 'the rich single life.'  ****  Biochem test, again, and I'm not prepared for it, again.  *sigh*  "Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now,  Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now?"  Sing it, sister.

      "Chamomile Tea, Sweetened with Honey"  I just had my first cup, and now I'm hooked.  This stuff has an odd, almost minty flavor about it, without the minty feel.  Honey just makes it all the more sweeter.  Very good. I think I'm going to drink this stuff on a consistent basis, from this point on.  That's right, give up old habits like AIM, take up new ones like.. drinking chamomile tea:  AIM.... is pulling... too... hard.... must not ope—  *sip*  Ah, much better.  AIM, you are toast.

      "Now if we can agree with who created us to be Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies  Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified Un-learn everything you know, and let him teach you Line upon line, every step upon pre-step, say goodbye, To this decaying social system He wants to know, how far we're willing to go If we love him like we say we do, He will try us  Just don't regress, Or slip into hopelessness Once he's satisfied his love, He won't deny us,  And then he'll tell us, What, what we gonna do now Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  And then he'll tell us, What, what we gonna do now Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now"  — Excerpt from   urlLink Adam Lives In Theory  , From the last Lauryn Hill CD, MTV Unplugged 2.0 (I think I got it last March)  I also like   urlLink I Gotta Find Peace of Mind  .

      "Email From Mom"  dear Tim:  I am grateful to have a passionate son for the LOrd. The fact alone you are a lover of our precious Lord comforts your mother very deeply. You are my reward for all these years' tears. How can I complain? How can I not praise God with all my might! Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love you Tim. Thank you.  In His grace, mom  ****  This is a very random email that I just received from my mother.  Albeit, encouraging, but really random. Ah. Who am I to complain?  ****  This weekend is going to be killer.  As well, I'm going to try to stay up, with no distractions, to study like I've never studied before.  Danny's most recent jowke:  "Where does lettuce go to worship God?  To the Sangchu-ary!  Oh snap yo, that one was a Danny Dokko original."  Ok, you have to know Korean to get the joke.

      How do we fail at breaking bad habits?  Listening to that voice inside that reasons, "Just once.  It won't hurt. It won't take up any time."  I find myself trying to reason with... myself... —right— to sign on AIM again.  "Oh, you have to talk to this person about this thing,"  or, "Well, Tim, you haven't seen this person in a while," etc. etc.  But then I fight that with, "If it's that important, then why don't I just give the person a call, or an email?"  HA! Take that, addicted mind.  Good thing I haven't listened to it yet.  AIM, you are going down!  Sigh.  I have 5.5 years of addiction that I'm going against.  I will win.  Anyhow, I'm finding myself starting to cut back on blogging and reading other's blogs as well.  No more extra browsing, I'll read only from the blogs on my list.  No more clicking on links on others' blogs.  That's what starts the downfall.  ****  "Half Baked"  How can I fight my tendency to get excited over ideas that are merely half-baked ideas?  How do I recognize that they aren't really worth getting excited over?  I'm starting to write things down more often now.  Well, actually, I was pretty good at writing things down, especially during junior year.  I had a pretty copius journal throughout college.  It didn't record exactly what I did, but it was more a collection of sermon notes, discussions with God, and venting frustrations.  Hm.  Besides the sermon notes, that sounds a lot like this blog :-)  Today was a productive day.  Thank you, God.

      I've compiled a list of bad habits that have caused a lot of distraction and problems.  The Internet is one of the things on the top of that list.  Honestly, I'm thinking of all the benefits and problems that have resulted from all the time I've glued my eyes to the CRT, soaking in information and falsely fulfilling my latent need for company.  I find that the problems have outweighed the benefits.  Looking at this past year alone, I think 75% of the time I have spent awake has been wasted on this blog, on reading others' blogs, chatting, staring, reading up on useless trivia on bands I like, etc.  AIM?  I think that'll be discontinued for a while.  Cold turkey rarely works.  It hasn't in the past.  This time it will work.  God, I ask for Your strength, in Your Son's name.

      No matter how hard I rationalize and uphold an ideal in my head, it rarely sways or changes my heart.  Why is that so?  Why do we so easily cogitate but fail miserably at getting our hearts to agree?  This dichotomy describes so many areas in my life.  One of the easiest examples can be getting over romances or bad relational entanglements.  Though my mind is quick is to fully understand rejection and to uphold the ideals of forgiveness, I find my heart being infinitely slow in cooperation.  Another example is honestly responding to the Gospel.  Although my mind is quick to understand the concept of sin, and believe in the truth of Christ's complete work in saving me from it, my heart is still slow in HONESTLY responding to it.  Why won't it listen to reason?  How does one conduct the chord progressions of the heart?  How does one steer through its stubborn waters?  Again, in my mind, I can come up with a reason.  But what of my heart?

      Why do I still feel like I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing, not at the place where I'm supposed to be?  Why are we, at large, plagued by this unhappiness, this dissatisfaction with our lives?  For me, I think I have a lot of issues to work out with dissatisfaction and pride.  I still don't get why I'm not full of gratitude.  I still don't get why I act like a spoiled child, demanding all these from God.  But I don't want to spend the next five years staring at computer screens, and that's what I might have to do.  Still haven't applied to fellowships, though I've been telling myself to do so for the past 2 months; deadlines are drawing near.   Tim, why are you this way?   Historically, I've always been a distracted person.  I've thus never really handed assignments in on time, my work has always been of low quality because I don't have the focus to work on it with full attention.  Is it a problem of motivation?   Tim, why are you this way?   When the problems in life hit because of personal failures and character faults, how does one escape from the viscious cycle of frustration?   Tim, the I AM will pull you from this miry clay.   From the perspective of the world, I am pathetic and weak-willed.   Tim, the I AM will show you His Kingdom.

      'Perfectionism'  Perfectionism is pretty much a defining trait of mine.  Coupled with highly sensitive to emotion, it can lead to many joys of completed projects, many frustrations of poorly done projects.  What is perfectionism?  I find that it is really the combination of its constituents: idealism and stubborness.  We who are perfectionist are very idealistic about the way something should be, and we are stubborn about that ideal.  This is a neutral trait;  it can lead us to do great, not mediocre, things, but it can lead us to be vessels of frustration for ourselves and those we impact.  What is the key to making the most of this character trait?  How does God use this trait while keeping us from attributing glory to ourselves?  Because ultimately, with all my perfectionism, I'm very easily distracted, so I tend to be a frustrated person more than a satisfied, joyful person.  Oh, to apply the Gospel in this situation. Ok, ok.

      To elucidate my last post, I mean to say that not thought process, but basic desires and simply being alive and conscious are always going to be constant throughout life.  Kinda redundant to say, I'm not sure I can really convey what I mean.  Anyhow, this is just coming from trying to teach and lead worship for kids and mentor the youth group praise team on Sundays, then interacting with their parents from time to time, and being with fellow grad school students throughout the week.  Sure, we all have grown in mental and intellectual experience, but I am starting to see that some things just don't change, no matter what age you are.  I'm trying to describe those 'things':  the drive to meet basic desires be it food, toys, acceptance, etc.  I thoughts that grown-ups would mature more as they grow older, but I'm seeing some elementary school kids being much more mature than many adults I know.  Mature as in, discerning what's right and wrong and actively trying to do the right thing.  Mature as in, being considerate of others.  ****  I had a lot of weird dreams this weekend.  One of them involved me being Tom Hanks in a movie.  It's starting to fade now, but I remember that I was invisible and trying to get people to understand that I was invisible.  Or something like that.  The dream ended up to be quite disturbing, but I forget why.  Just this morning, I dreamt that I was hanging out with Jacob and Joe in some rundown med school.  We wanted to get something to eat, so we had to go to this really weird way to get to the cafeteria:  the shower stall in a bathroom had a staircase instead of a back wall.  Even stranger, as we waited in the dingy lobby, other friends of the guys came and we all dragged out our books and started to study.  As I took out my Physiology book, a car pulled up — yeah, I think at this point the dream was starting to transition to the next — and a bum got out, pulled out a gun, and demanded us to give him money.  I needed all the cash I had on me, so I as I gave him my cash, I held the wallet at an angle so that he couldn't tell that I didn't take all my money out.  At this point, there was a full transition.  After the bum left, I pulled out my gun, forgetting my textbook, and found that I was now part of a task force working with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator.  I recall walking away down the street and into a clothing store.  Suddenly, The T-1000 was everywhere.  Ie, liquid metal was streaming from all the walls, floor, and ceiling.  Some of us hid in a corner closet with two layers of mirrored sliding doors, but I realized that the wall that faced the store was made of glass.  Halley Joel Osmont was next to me, and he ran out to try to escape.  T-1000 turned with gun in hand and brutally showered him with bullets.  The horrific sight turned my muscles stiff.  T-1000 then faced me, and started to shoot at me through that stupid glass wall.  He missed a couple shots, and pointed the gun straight at my face, and pulled the trigger.  Frozen in fear, I thought I was done for, but I felt the bullet whiz by my nose and embed itself into the closet door.  He ran out, and I finally got out of the closet to chase him down with Arnold.  But it wasn't too long for me to realize that T-1000 was masquerading as Arnold all along.  He chased me down into a supermarket, and started to shoot at me as I ducked through the aisles.  However, I found that the harder I ran, the more I started to slip on the floor.  In agony, I strained to flee.  That's when I woke up.  It was not a pleasant feeling to wake up from.

      While driving through the northern Philly suburbs, I passed by the center where I had gotten my first driver's license, 6 years ago.  Has it been so long?  Nostalgia swept through me.  I passed King of Prussia mall, where I had cracked a tooth on an overcooked buffalo wing from Boardwalk Fries at the foodcourt.  That quickly ended the cold turkey witnessing event that my youth group was there for... before it even started.  All of a sudden, I felt myself transported 30 years into the future, reminiscing about my early grad school days.  I felt the emotion of fear that my life had come to nothing up to that point... I felt the pangs of mid-life crisis.  It made me realize that though we get older, we still are the same people.  What do I mean?  We will always be at 'a current state of consciousness', trying to manage our lives at the moment, regardless of age.  Age simply gives us experience and deeper set of emotions to feel, but we're still at the same point: now.  Therefore, we all expect the same thing throughout all points of our lives: what we hope, what we want.  I don't know if this makes sense, it's hard to focus my thoughts with my brother flipping through  Event Horizon  and  Good Eats  on the TV behind me.  I'll review and edit this later.

      After the last post, I stayed up arranging songs for Saturday's praise night practice, slept at around 5.  At around 8:45 AM, I awoke to the sound of the television and my brother asking me to take him to the train station.  After dropping him off, I plopped back into bed at around 9:20.  9:50 AM greeted me with the loud cellphone ringing in my ear.  Upon answering the call, the fist thing I heard was my mom yelling.  Instantly, in my sleep-deprived state, i felt the strings of restraint snap as my heart grew angry in response.  Let's just say that the next 20 minutes were very loud and unpleasant, from both ends of the phone.  I hung up, took a hot shower to wake up and calm down the hurricane of anger.  As soon as I got out, another call from home;  another 15 minutes of fruitless reasoning.  What a start to this day.  11:20 AM - arrived at the parking lot of a local Pizza Hut to pick up a student.  Waited 20 minutes, she finally came.  Drove to campus, printed out the music from my computer lab, encountered heavy traffic due to Rutgers football game.  12:10 PM - Finally escaped the traffic and got on the highway.  Approached speeds of 90 to 100 mph at times, shaved 10 minutes off of the normal amount of time it takes to get to my house.  We were all supposed to meet up at 12 PM at my house.  12:40 PM - Found that I had to bring 2 extra people to practice, because they had slept over some of the praise team members' houses.  1:30 PM - Arrived at the church where we had practice.  For the next three hours, felt my energy being sapped out by the people that weren't supposed to be there.  4:30 PM - Exhausted.  Encountered traffic that turned a 30 minute trip into an hour long trip.  5:30 PM - Got home, ate a quick dinner.  Left at 6.  6:40 PM - Reached Edison.  The girl that I was dropping off didn't know how to get to her house, as she led me down multiple streets only to backtrack.  Took me an extra 40 minutes to get home.  7:20 PM - Took a dump, gathered my things, burned a CD, headed off for Philly.  7:40 PM - Low gas tank indicator blinks on.  Luckily, rest stop was five miles down the road.  Waited 20 minutes in line to finally get gas; had to turn off AC, stereo, lights, to conserve anythign that sucked up energy.  9:40 PM - Finally reached the destination: a church in West Chester where Portico, Jimmy Choi's band, was in the latter part of the set.  I didn't have any cash, but found that they had a $5 charge.  Luckily, they let me in since I knew Jimmy.  As I stood watching them, a friend I knew from high school greeted me; he goes to the same church as Jimmy.  11:40 PM - Reached Jimmy's apartment.  Hung out until he left for the airport at 3 AM... conked out on his bed.  8:00 AM - Five hours later, woke up, got ready for church, met Jimmy's roommate from CA.  Ha... he knew a girl I met online during my junior year of high school.  9:30 AM - Reached the apartment where my brother was staying.  It belonged to a mutual friend of ours... and it was one block away from his church, Emmanuel.  10:00 AM - Took off for home and church.  6:30 PM - Now.  I am tired.  I want to sleep.  This was such a long, tiring weekend.  But it was good in many ways, and I am grateful that God's blessed me with the fellowship of the body.

      Just watched Harry Potter.  It was fun, well done, I can see why people are so hooked on Harry Potter.  As for me, I've never been able to get into it; it never really pulled to me, didn't and still don't see anything special about it after having reading all those sc-fi and fantasy books as a kid.  But, I do see why people have gotten into it.  It was fun and had a good sense of adventure.  And you gotto love that flying car that has a life of its own... it reminded me of those " urlLink Herbie The Love Bug " movies from the 70's, like, "Herbie Goes Bananas", "The Love Bug", etc.  There, no spoilers for you fans that haven't seen it, ok? :-)   OH, but then again, if you are fans, you would have already read the book, and from what I hear, it's basically the book.  So, just go to see the book in live action.  Anyhow, it's 3 AM, we caught the 11:45 showing.  I am tired.  Good night.

      I picked up my  urlLink bike  today, after having it out of commission for a week due to a flat tire.  I didn't have any spare inner tubes and I didn't have time to take it in to the shop until yesterday.  I love riding around on  urlLink it ,  urlLink it  makes exercise fun.   urlLink It 's not even exercise anymore;  there's something invigorating about the speed and about doing jumps and going over rough terrain.  When I get tired, this is the only time where I don't give in and stop, because the thrill is too great.  But I'm still sorely out of shape.  ****  Please pray for praise team prep for praise night!

      Must finish this blog before midnight, and it's 11:54 right now, so I'll be quick.  Just want to make note of the fact that since I'm more on the ministry side of things now at church, I'm a little nervous that I myself won't get fed.  A lot of issues still need to be worked out.  Lord, help me.  ****  I am so busy with school and with other things, I don't get to spend quality time with my age anymore.  That's why I am lonely these days.  That's why I have all these urges to go online, because there are more people I know that are on there, as opposed to the people around here.  I'm not just talking about craving typical social contact, but good Christian fellowship: sharing, praying, bonding with people.  The last time I was able to do that was 3 weeks ago when I visited friends in New York.  Gosh, it's already been three weeks!  I was planning to meet up with Jacob yesterday at the NY Public Library on 42nd and 5th to study, but that fell through.  Anyhow, it's cool that I've met Jacob's friends at Remnant online through AIM and blogging, but they're out there, and I'm here.  It's cool that I have friends in Philadelphia, but they're out there, and I'm here.  People here just don't seem interested in hanging out... but I still should reach out.  I know that a lot of this has to do with my prejudices/barriers with people whom God has surrounded me.  I just can't connect with anyone around here... why?  Is it snobbery?  I don't feel like I'm being a snob, and I don't think that I'm being one, either.  Hopefully not, that would really stink.  All in all, at the end, I'm still lonely here at Rutgers.  I miss all my friends that graduated and are still down at JHU.  I want to get to know those people that I've connected with at New York.  I want to meet some good quality people here, people that force/encourage me to be good quality as well.  I've been searching for much needed accountability, but just haven't really found a good friend that I connect with yet.  Please pray for me.  Still searching.  Hopefully, I'll find them.  And maybe, I'll find her. Unless of course, I already have and I don't even know it. :-D

      "But the Cross was the fruition of God’s love for His people, an act of grace, and a sovereign work that could never be frustrated by either the creatures He intends to save nor by those who are lost in their sins."  Note to self:  How could one —who is in Christ— ever be insecure after reading something like this?  Think of  urlLink Romans 8 .  Man, I keep believing in the wrong things:  depression, loneliness, failure.  I'll still be 'hai-ting'.  (Koreanization of the word 'fighting.' It's a chant they do at sporting events... the fact that it's improper grammar speaks volumes of why I find Koreans to be very entertaining.  Think  urlLink http://www.engrish.com )

      Quotes to think about.  1) "So It comes down to this: what was the purpose of the death of Christ? First, what did the Father and the Son intend to accomplish by it? I say—the Scripture says—“to seek and to save that which was lost.” Second, what was actually and effectually fulfilled and accomplished by it? Many things: reconciliation, justification, sanctification and adoption."  2) "We can also answer the question—what was the purpose of the death of Christ?—another way: first, the immediate, supreme and ultimate end was for the glory of God; second, the secondary, intermediate and subservient end was to bring us to God."  3) "God, out of his infinite love to his elect, sent his dear Son in the fullness of time, whom he had promised in the beginning of the world, and made effectual by that promise, to die, pay a ransom of infinite value and dignity, for the purchasing of eternal redemption, and bringing unto himself all and every one of those whom he had before ordained to eternal life for the praise of his own glory."  4) "But the Cross was the fruition of God’s love for His people, an act of grace, and a sovereign work that could never be frustrated by either the creatures He intends to save nor by those who are lost in their sins."  from  urlLink http://home.earthlink.net/%7Emybrainhurts/biblical/DefAtone5.html

      I feel so isolated and alone.  Am I really?  ****  Anyhow, this thought occured to me.  If I was to die tonight, would I be satisfied with my life to this point?  I think would I complain, "But I never had a career," or "I didn't conquer my sin," or "I never had a girl to be with," or simply, "I'm not ready to go, life just started!"  I think that speaks volumes about how self-centered I am.  I am still in a state of mind where life is about my glory:  I didn't achieve, I'm still as prone to give in to my bad habits as ever, I didn't have a family, I didn't have a "worthy life."  Essentially, I've placed my values and ideals in ways to ultimately give myself glory, not God.  It's a legalistic, self-righteous state of mind that ultimately places its worth in itself, instead of trusting in the infinite worth found solely in Christ.  At the end, it says 'ME' instead of 'You,' God.  God, what now?  How do things change?  Where do I go from here, and how do I get there?

      Woke up at 11:30 AM.  Now in my lab, about to check out another lab since they're setting up some cool equipment.  I am cool. I work in a lab. I am, as Strong Bad says, 'crazy-go-nuts.'  I am cool.  ****  I was reading some random blogs of acquaintances (not friends) that I had in college, and it is striking to see further confirmation on why I never continued efforts to reach out to them.  We are all imperfect, but sometimes there are those you can tell really don't seem to be worth the time and energy; they end up exhibiting their ultimately self-centered natures like we all do, but they never make an effort to admit that it's wrong and to fight those tendencies.  They blame the world for not serving them, they complain.  We all do it, but some don't find it to be something wrong.  Anyhow, I'm glad that I still have had the blessing to know friends that are ardent about fighting those sinful tendencies.  God uses these friends to motivated me to join the fight against selfishness.  On a totally different subject, it is also striking to see how unstable our hearts can be.  At least, my heart is quite unpredictable.  I'm still trying to make it listen, to make it forgive, to make it love in the face of rejection, failure, and inconsideration.  Thank goodness that the Gospel is objective, otherwise I would have done so many more stupid and un-edifying things.  Back to life.

      "Up Late"  I am still up at around 4 AM working on the mix for the praise night.  Remnant STORM, you're in for a special treat with the first track, since it will only pertain to you.  Once again, perfectionism has been dictating this mix.  I keep struggling to decide what's the best combination of thematic cohesiveness, musical excellence, and theological/philosphical weight.  I am struggling to not put too much Matt Redman stuff on here.. heh.  Ok, so I keep praying that it will be the right mix for everyone.  Maybe some will dislike, some will really like, but all in all, I just want it to make a good, lasting impact.  Hence the perfectionism.  So far, here is the most recent iteration of the songs' thematic layout.  To me, it makes sense as a dialogue between God and worshipper:  Introduction (for STORM copies only).  God:  I, the Lord God, am asking if you know Me.  Since you are all mine, come, praise Me, the God who saves the day, the God romances you.  Worshipper:  God, you are my treasure.  Jesus, our friendship is firmly secure.  God:  Oh, really?  Then what do you see when you look upon the cross?  Are you changed, or is your heart hardened to what I did for you, out of my ultimate love for you, my child?  Worshipper:  God, you're right.  You keep leading me back to the cross, You keep reminding me of what You did to bring me to You.  You brought me into Your presence, a place where even angels fear to enter.  There are these times where it's hard for me to see Your love, but then I didn't notice You were standing here holding me, sharing my pain, washing my feet, dying for me.  I'm at Your feet, broken, crying out, and there You are, You are all I need.  Lord, my heart is Yours, in times of darkness, in times of pain... here I am to worship You.  You give and take and way, but I will still bless and praise Your name, because Your life and death are a firm reminders of Your faithfulness.  You are more than enough, Lord, You are sufficient.  You amaze me, and You show me that You really are in control!  All creation should cry out praises to You, for You truly are the Creator, the Life-giver, the Provider!  It's You alone that gives me reason to dance and rejoice... I could have been content to see Your glory from the farthest distance, but You graciously pulled me to Yourself.  So I come to foot of Your throne, shaking with the immeasurable delight that has overcome my senses, for I can see the glory of God up close and personal... and remain alive!  ****  Well, I hope that makes sense.  That's the song order that I have in my mind now.  Does it make sense?  It's 4:15 now, anything makes sense at this point.  I think that is my cue to sleep.  I guess I won't have time to go study @ the New York Public Library on 42nd and 5th, tomorrow.  Darnit, and I was looking forward to it.  This week, I will not waste.  I was able to be on the ball last week...  I won't be conditional and say that God's grace was on me any more than my bad times, but man, it sure felt good to make it through.  Plus... no AIM yet!  I am hoping to hold out on AIM for at least a month, so that I can develop a lifestyle that really doesn't need it anymore.  God, thank you.  Jesus, You Whom are in total control, protect me, strengthen me, and make my heart more sensitive to and moldable by the Gospel.

      Since Saturday evening, I've been preparing for tomorrow's Biochem test.  At this moment, I must confess that I've never felt so unprepared for a test since Fluid Mechanics my junior year.  But, you know, this is the best I could have done given what I've had to work with this past month.  Since this past week, I've been trying to change a lot of bad habits that have sucked my life away.  This time around, I'm really trying to do it based on the firm faith of Christ's sovereignty over existence, not just wishful thinking.  I am starting to see that it will be an extended and consistent process of reminding myself again and again about what's real and to act accordingly.  To explain, it's reminding myself that though my emotions and whims are strong, Christ's command of reality is ultimately stronger; therefore, if I ask Him to help me, He will.  And, He has.  I know that I won't do well on this test tomorrow, but that doesn't matter.  The fact that I was able to study this past weekend is testament to Christ's strength.  Every fiber in my being didn't want to study, and usually I would have listened to my body's objection, but I asked Christ to exert His control and give me the strength and motivation to do it.  Yeah, so, I studied, and to the best of my ability.  Yeah, I won't do well, I don't have nearly good enough of a command of everything, but that's ok.  That's ok.

      Last night, I went to bed at 8:30 PM and got up at 4:30, lay in bed for two hours, and got ready for today's practice.  I scheduled it to start at 11 AM, so I planned to leave at 9 AM to pick up a student that lives near me, and drive to my parents' home in Parsippany to pick up the rest of the students.  The car didn't start.  My brother didn't have jumper cables, so I had to take my roommate's car to WalMart and buy new cables.  The metronome/backing track CD I made didn't work, so I had to reburn it.  We hit traffic.  We ended up starting practice 2 hours late.  I was really tired.  We finished practice at 5.  After three hours of driving kids home, I got back home at 8.  My brother and I took... our other brother to an all-you-can-eat ribs place to celebrate his birthday.  Long, frustrating, humbling, day.  Thought about a lot of things, but nothing really substantial for me to write about.  Sorry.

      3:27 PM.  I am screwed.  I am not.  Yes, I am.  No, I am not.  etc.  ****  I've seen that I can't get rid of negative, positive, and romantic feelings by demand.  But, the difference between someone that is stable and someone that is unstable lies within the degree one allows them to have on one's life.  I am sad to admit that along those lines of definition, I see that I tend to be more unstable than stable.  My emotions and my feelings tend to dictate my actions more than my will.  Oh, what a joyous occasion it is when the will wins out! :-)

      "Taste them again, for the first time."  — Kellogg's Corn Flakes commercials from late '80s and early '90s  After all of this talk about the authenticity of faith, it dragged out a train of thought that has chugged through the back of my mind for a long time:  Am I really following Christ?  What is it about my life that reflects that I really am enjoying the riches of God's grace found at the foot of the cross?  Honestly, as I look at my life, I see more time spent watching TV, jamming on the guitar, and reading blogs on the Internet than the time I spend with Him alone.  I spend more time doing things "for Him", doing things for others, and doing things more me then I do by actually sitting by His Word, reading it, digesting it, praying, etc.  Authenticity is a quality I prize a lot, but is it something I myself lack?  Am I but a sham?  In the song  The Promise of Your Cross  by Matt Redman, he reminds me, "I have no other claim, I have no other plea.... the promise of the cross, the hope for everyone."  I recognize that a lot of these questions belie a heart that places emphasis on my actions as proof of Christ working in me, as opposed to the actual Christ working in me.  I recognize that I have  no other claim but the promise of the cross , lest the Gospel be 'weakened' and be a product of human works.  But, what is faith if it doesn't manifest itself by changing the life of one who has it?  It is but mere mental cognition.  And so I find myself still wondering about the authenticity of my faith, when I don't see how my life really reflects someone changed by the Gospel.  When I read and hear about Christ did, I don't see my heart responding with any emotion, it feels like it's desensitized to it.  It acts like there is no power in it.  Where are the riches of God's grace?  Where is the hope that I will receive them?   Why is the joy promised by this hope beat out by the instant pleasures I feel that I will receive when I obey the lusts of my body and the fickle distractions of the heart ?  How do I taste the Gospel again, for the first time?

      Awesome!  I found  urlLink this awesome online publisher .  urlLink http://www.bartleby.com  has all of the classics and references anyone would ever need.  Now I have no excuse not to read quality literature anymore.  Behold, a classic hymn below:   Hic Breve Vivitur     From “De Contemptu Mundi” By Bernard of Morlaix. Tr. J. M. Neale (cir. 1125)     BRIEF life is here our portion,   Brief sorrow, short-lived care; The life that knows no ending,   The tearless life, is there.    And after fleshly scandal,         5    And after this world’s night, And after storm and whirlwind,   Is calm and joy and light.    There grief is turned to pleasure,   Such pleasure as, below,         10  No human voice can utter,   No human heart can know:  The peace of all the faithful,   The calm of all the blest, Inviolate, unvaried,         15    Divinest, sweetest, best.    That peace,—but who may claim it?   The guileless in their way, Who keep the ranks of battle,   Who mean the thing they say.         20   Strive, man, to win that glory,   Toil, man, to gain that light, Send hope before to grasp it,   Till hope be lost in sight!

      I had typed up this post about my brief study on Kurosawa two summers ago, and lost it.  I am frustrated, but oh well.  I am too pressed for time to retype it, so here's the rundown:   Rashomon :  Didn't really find anything great about it.   The Seven Samurai :  Found it to be all that it was cracked up to be, something I would spend money to buy.  I also watched  The Magnificent Seven  since it was an adaptation of The Seven Samurai.  I found it to be almost as good, since it condensed a very long movie and gave it a faster pace, but it didn't take out too much from its source material.  I hope to watch  The Hidden Fortress  since it is the source of inspiration for  Star Wars .  I was a Star Wars nut when I was a kid: I memorized every line of all three movies, knew a lot of the bloopers, read the novels about what happened afterwards, played all the flight simulators, read the Star Wars encyclopedia, etc.  Mind you, I did all this in a span of ten years, not two, so I'm no Star Wars nerd. :-D  Ok.

      "Are you there?  Hello?"  It seems to me that when women complain, a lot of it has to do with the absence of men's attention.  Now, this is not to mean attention in the romantic sense alone.  This has to do with the absence of men's attention to what they should be paying attention, like responsiblities around the house, intiative in the world, taking care of their families, and treating their women with the respect and affection that they desire.  There seems to exist a cycle where women complain and men only see the specific things they complain about.  Neither party really strives to see what the core of issue is:  men not paying attention to why what they should be paying attention.  At least, I see this in my family.  My family consists of 4 males, 1 female.  To be honest, for the past 22 years of my life I've heard more complaints, nagging, screams, demands, etc. from my mother than thankful remarks and satisfied sentiments.  She seems to be more intent on saying, "This family is all talk!  You all say that you love me, but you don't do anything to help me!" as opposed to, "My life is so happy.  The house is clean, my ministry is going well because everyone is so supportive, and I always have someone to talk to because my family hears me and understands me."  The problem seems to start from top down.  My father was always studying in his office, and my brother was too rebellious and strong minded (a trait inherited from my mother) to listen, and so my brother and I passively followed him (a trait inherited from my dad).  Of course, this is an oversimplification of the problem, but from the point that we three boys began to think on our own, we found it our mission to point out all the fallacies and logical failures in our parents to do whatever we wanted.  That has become a pattern in our family and I think it is a common pattern in men when dealing with unhappy women:  1)  Men do not live up to their responsibilities, such as treating women in a respectful and serving manner. 2)  Women respond emotionally to the problems created, sometimes escalating to the Women's Rights bonanza in the '60s and '70s, to the constant nagging we receive from all of our mothers. 3)  The nagging and emotional response rarely gets the point across, because it elicits a negative and self-righteous response from men.  I list my mom yelling at me as the top thing in this world that can make me lose control of my temper. 4)  Men learn to ignore what the women complain about, then attack the emotional nature and foundation of these complaints.  They feel the women are wrong and are stubborn not to see that they are wrong, and both sides want to boost their egos by showing themeselves to be in the right.  At the end, no one feels the need to change his or her lifestyle. 5)  The cycle perpetuates:  Women get more emotional and angry because there is now a history of men ignoring them and continuing to shirk their responsibilities.  One possible course of solution:  1)  Both sides admitting that they are wrong, that their attitudes are self-glorifying and ultimately sinful. 2)  Both sides coming to Christ first and asking for His strength to change, for the the Holy Spirit to open their eyes to see what should be done. 3)  Both sides sitting down and logically laying out what the root of the problem is:  men shirking their responsibilities for "grass that looks greener on the other side," like petty hobbies and shallow means of entertainment that waste time.  Men know what they have to do, but they see more instant gratification in the projects, in their sports teams, in their pornography, in their hobbies, in their alcohol, etc.  The road to perdition is by giving into temptations that promise instant pleasure.  Pleasure, a thing that is good and that should be pursued, is pursued by the wrong means.  Men have to seek to find their pleasure by the right means, they have to seek to create higher ideals.  Women have to stop nagging, start being reasonable with they way the respond to their situation, and start praying for the stupid men to turn their hearts to God. 4)  Men make it their priority to CHANGE THEIR SELF-CENTERED HABITS AND PRIORITIES.  Men make it their priority to TREAT WOMEN WITH RESPECT and to practice the correct form of attention: prayerful provision and God-ward leadership.  Women realize that THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT IN THE WAY THEY DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM, and make it their priority to prayerfully and thoughtfully deal with problems. 5) Both sides practice the principles of Christ-likeness by realizing that change comes with persistent, insistent hearts that are striving towards a new goal: the Glory of God, instead of the glory of self.  This new, life-giving cycle with hopefully then perpetuate as each new problem in life arises.  I think this can happen.  I think it is realistic: it doesn't depend on some mystical force and circumstance to change things, it depends on desiring to and getting to know a God who works through realistic things, who works through changing the way we emotionally react to the things that we find our pleasure in.  For me, I am trying to get rid of my addiction to the internet.  I've cut out AIM, but I already see that I've been trying to make up for that change by reading more blogs and checking my email every single chance that I get.  My priorities should be my God, then my family, then my church, then my studies, then my friends.  Unless, of course, I find that girl.  Then she'll be tied with family for the heirarchy of priority ;-).  This list isn't generalizable to all, it's to what God has called me to manage.  God, turn me on towards Your direction.  Give me what I need to live.   Forgive me in the way that I forgive others .  Let that request motivate me to be more generous with my love that I can give.  Please, lead me away from distractions, and away from the evil in this world.  Christ is my claim ticket for these requests, so please grant me these things.  Let me live life and live it to the fullest.

      There were many thoughts I wanted to post, today, but I forgot them.  Let me try to extract them.  ****  "Whadder You Gonna Do?"  For the past year, I've frequently been asked that question about my future plans, and I've frequently answered, "I don't know."  Today, I was thinking about how I really haven't been asking that to myself enough.  This isn't a matter about worrying about what the future holds, it's a matter of being thoughtful about my direction in life.  Let's just say that I haven't been as thoughtful as I wish.  ****  "Kid's Don't Like It When..."  ... people older than them talk down to them, pinch them, and incessantly remark about how cute they are.  They like the attention, but they don't like how they get it.  For example, pinching their cheeks seems to be one of the biggest pet peeves.  Think about it.  Who ever likes having some lady squeal at your sight, pick you up, pinch your cheeks, and make stupid baby noises?  I noticed that it's very selfish of us to do whatever we want with them on their expense.  Are you really thinking about their welfare when you're selfishly enjoying all their cuteness?  Treat them in a Godly fashion: nicely and respectfully.  Sure they can't cogitate on our level, but they're still individuals.  They'll listen to you in return, if you consistently instill in them that you really care about them and are willing to listen to them.  These are my observations after working with kids during my senior year of high school and for the past couple of months.

      The praise band drummer flaked out on us today, so we had practice at my home in Parsippany.  I decided to have a more focused time of worship and prayer, then we did another run-through of the songs.  It is a great thing for them to see what goes into planning these sort of things in a prayerful, meaningful way.  We then bought supplies to make a welcoming card/poster for our church's new youth pastor.  He starts seminary in a year, hope God uses him well.  I'm sorta cautious about him, but we'll see.  I then went over one of the kids' house.  We watched Homestar cartoons on the computer, and I tried to fix his computer since it's been having mucho problemas.  That night was Samaritan's Purse at the church; the kids put together 14 care gift packages for goodwill.  All throughout this, the following thoughts ran through my mind:  "I must study.  I am behind."  "God, seriously, please work at this praise night thing."  "I must apply to fellowships.  I am behind."  ****  I have been trying to fight my heart's continuing negative reaction to events that happened during September, and I find that it's still not really getting over it.  The reason why I say this is that I was counselling a high school student about girl probs and it made me realize that I am still in disbelief over my personal situation.  "Put it behind you!"  "Deal with it directly!"  "Resolve to resolve the issue!"  Through all of this, I've been fighting the following grumble:  "Typical.  Some people always seem to get what they want, whether they realize they want it or not.  Me?  I definitely don't fit in that category."  It makes me realize how judgemental and self-righteous the human heart can be.  Not to mention petulant and spoiled.  This is what I counter that thought with:  "Even if you think you don't think you've gotten anything, so what?  What do you deserve, anyhow?  But regardless, you have things in life that others can only dream of having.  Most of all, you are in a good relationship with God."  "Yeah," my heart responds, "But you still didn't get that greener grass."  Sometimes I just want to take a Bugs Bunny-era mallet and wallop some sense into my heart.  Why must it be so stubborn?  Anyhow, yesterday I had dinner with some Korean Grad Students.  It was good kalbi.  Bist wan.  It made me realize that besides cultural differences, people are the same in terms of our need for Christ.  God, please, bring people I see around me to Yourself.  It doesn't have to be through me, but please, bring them to Yourself.  Still looking for good accountability.  Brothers, where are you? Unless, God will send it in the form of a future wife. ;-)

      praise night passed, by His grace, for His glory.  i hope the message of the night was clear; jimmy communicated it clearly in his sermon, thanks bro.  if you still don't think you got it, go to jacob's site, he has a good summary.  if that's enough, drop me a line, and i'll email you an mp3 of it.  after it was over and was done and put away, i dropped off the drums and the drummer at his church, and his mom drove him home.  i drove back, and along the way after i made a sharp turn, i noticed a strong smell of spaghetti and meatballs permeate the car.  i didn't want to look back to see what spilled.  came home, informed my parents of the spilled sauce, checked my site and others for entries and comments, brushed my teeth, and conked out.  i woke up 13 hours later, at 1 PM.  ah, blissful, uninterrupted sleep.  still exhausted.  i don't even have the energy to capitalize my i's in this entry.

      Happy Thanksgiving everyone.  My brothers and I made the BEST turkey I've ever had, thanks to the cooking wisdom of Alton Brown.  Alton Brown, from the Food Network show Good Eats, has an incredibly awesome, crazy-go-nuts method/recipe for turkey.  I have never had white meat so juicy and tasty... it was even juicer than the dark meat.  I am still in awe of that recipe.  Seriously, you MUST try it out.  It's elaborate, but it definitely pays off at the end.  Yum.  Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

      The real moments of truth that test one's character sometimes come when interacting with family, especially parents.  Let's just say that the only person that can show me how much of a temper I can get is my mom.  I don't know how she does it, but she presses the EXACT buttons that set me off.  Let's just say it's a humiliating thing that I still have those really shamefully uncontrolled elements within me.  How do I exercise control in those situations?  I think it's easy to lose my temper of situations of familiarity, not unfamiliarity.  When things are going wrong and antagonistic in an unfamiliar environment, I'm usually really understanding and I keep my cool because in my mind, I understand that... I just don't understand.  But when things go wrong and antagonistic in a FAMILIAR environment, I lose my cool really quick, because I have an established set of ideals and expectations that come into play.  Especially with my mom, there's a long history of nagging and her losing temper with us, that I automatically respond with much fury.  I really hope that this pattern doesn't extend to my relations with my future wife, if I do end up meeting one.  How do I fight emotions that well up so strongly and so furiously?  In those stormy times, how do I exert Christ-like character?

      Tossing and turning, I get up and realize that I need to clip my left hand fingernails to prepare for praise night's heavy duty guitar playing.  Currently I await my rommate to finish hhihs shower so that I can enter the bathroom and get the nail clippers.  After the last post I laid in bed, tossing and turning.  I got up, and went through the set list again.  I realized there were too many songs, I took one out.  That's when I noticed my long fingernails on my left hand were hampering my fingers from properly form the chords.  They weren't that long, just long enough to make a difference, maybe one and a half millimeters long.  Tomorro is Wednesday.  A day of much preparation to brring a lot of stuff home.  A day in which I will determine myself to make a difference in my life instead of passively letting my flesh and its fears freeze me into falling into the same pattern again.  Snow is falling outside.  My roommates take a break from their bout of Mario Tennis to note the layer of snow that has already formed.  Winter is here, already.  Seasons change, but do we?  I apologize, Dee, for all that commotion on your site.  It's my fault, and I want to make it up to you somehow.  Even if it is a small thing.  It's how we handle the small things that indicate how we handle the big things, right?  My roommates are getting more into their Mario Tennis Match.  I sit here typing, eyes closed, in my stream of consciousness, connecting, waiting for the next significant thought to appear.  Strong Bad, on the Homestar Runner site, noted in a recent email cartoon that "the Internet is place where nothing happens, nothing."  I agree with him.  To a certain degree.  Smalville episode was interesting today.  Kristin Kreuk seems to be the main draw for everyone I know that is hooked on the show.  Me?  I watch the show because I was into comics as a kid, and it's interesting to see the plot twists and turns.  Kristin is quite attractive, but that's such an impersonal medium.  Since friends started to idolize celebrities in the 5th grade, I sometimes bought into the whole "ogle the celebrity female" thing, but not much.  When I entered puberty, it became more of a physical thing, but I never really went crazy about obsessing over some stupid celebrity like I noticed many other guys did.  I noticed the girls around me, and was more content about finding interest in them, because they were real, and they were fun to talk to.  Since then, it's been the same.  I don't really care to admire celebrity females, because my heart doesn't buy into the cultural definition of beauty.  Well, to a certain extent.  It tends to fantasize more about girls I've met.  don't take that the wrong way.  fantasize as in, smitten, as in, admiring beauty.  my roommate is done his shower.  Time to clip these nails and try to sleep, again.

      There are times in which I am overwhelmed with disgust over this culture's entertainment-centered focus of life, and more disgusted with myself buying into it.  I find myself in this state of anger, like now, at how I have failed to really live my life with a real passion inspired by an authentic relationship with God, versus passion inspired by lesser things.  "Oh Tim, you put too much pressure on yourself.  You make things so complicated.  Just enjoy life."  I say no to that.  What is there to enjoy right now?  I can't settle for cheap thrills in life.  I won't.  Thrills like engaging my short attention span in television and movies.  People go about life like automatons, not realizing that they're living to only see the next movie, to pursue the next hobby, to find the next toy in life that will hold their attentions for a while.  I can't settle for that.  I won't.  I want something real in life, even if my dissatisfaction has alienated myself from people all my life.  I want to live real life; God, I want real life. Oh, God, I want real life.  But I'm all cheap talk.  I'm always like this when I go to sleep.  But when I wake, all these convictions are forgotten.  I do THE EXACT SAME THING THROUGHOUT THE DAY.  WHY?!  I can't STAND this life.  But I keep living it, enjoying it, regretting it, living it, enjoying it, regretting it.  Why, God, am I this way?  As I said in the last post, why can't I get the Gospel?  WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY HEART? Why doesn't it respond with humility, faith, obedience, and joy?  Please, oh please, let me know this Grace with which You say You give me, let me taste the boundless riches that You say are in the way of the Cross.  There's nothing in this world that has brought me any satisfaction, and I now have the foresight to see that there's nothing I haven't tasted yet that will provide it.  "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with  every spiritual blessing in Christ ."  Where are they, God?

      I'm trying to find solace in this crazy world Over this steaming cup of tea.  I'm reading Your words but I forget what they say the moment I begin my day.  What do You see in me?  ****  "Crumpled Paper"  I lapsed with my internet addiction, and my heart feels like crumpled paper.  ****  "Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls." — 1 Peter 1:8-9  Does this life show that I really love Him?  Does my receiving my salvation fill me with an inexpressible and glorious joy?  Answers:  I don't know if it does.  And as soon as God delivered me the past week, look at how I responded these past few days: anything but worship.  I've not changed a bit.  I see all my failure in life, and I see that I have no other claim other than the promise of the cross.  I see all my purported successes, what little ones I have, and I see that I still have no other claim, but the promise of the cross.  CHANGE ME, GOD!  Must keep going on. Must keep going. on. Must keep. going. on.  Must. keep. going. on.

Anyhow, yesterday I went to Blue 9 hamburgers in New York and met up with Jacob, Denise, Carol, and other friends of theirs from Remnant.  It was a really great time of good eats and good company.  I miss good company.

      "Simple Joy"  As I was waiting for my train to New York today, a woman and her 2 year old child sat on the bench besides me.  The woman kept whispering, "Watch out for the train!" to her son, who responded with excited glances down the track.  A man sitting on the other side of the bench asked if it was the first time for the child to ride a train.  "Oh, actually, he just wanted to see the trains go by," she replied sheepily.  "Oh," smiled the man.  I smiled too, and noticed a tiny Tupperware container of Cheerios in her right hand.  She opened it up and offered some to her son, who accepted it gratefully.  After a ten minute wait, the moment arrived.  The man noticed the high-speed Amtrak first, and motioned for the mother to get her son's attention.  Sure enough, after a couple of seconds the bright lights in the distance were upon us, and the train sped by with a big gust of air.  As its wheels screamed over the tracks, I looked over with concern at the boy.  Would he be scared?  The boy's face had the biggest look of surprise, joy, and excitement I had ever seen on anyone's face in a long time.  It was over in a second, but that moment seemd to last for much longer.  The mom arose with her child, and the boy pranced off the platform as if they just saw the greatest thing on earth.  ****  Funny Quotes of the day:  "i'm really glad i met your physical form"  "i never think guys are attractive"  — Carol Chu, over Instant Messenger today  uhh.... thank you carol.  and wow, uh... that's interesting.  ***  God, why do I always feel like I'm wasting my life?

      As I listen to  urlLink Moby 's album '18', I think the following thoughts:  1) He has a very definite style of chord progressions and instrumental arrangements.  After a couple of years of listening to his full body of work, from the early '90s to this album, one starts to notice the same style of beats, piano parts, strings, etc.  I love it when I can start to recognize an artist simply by hearing his or her or their music. 2) Some of his stuff reminds me of my friend  urlLink Stan 's mixes.  It must be a New York thing.  Some of their stuff has a very... shuffle-y sound to it, a lot of rustling and movement.  Yeah, it's definitely New York. 3) I love New York.  ****  I am appreciating Coldplay stuff more and more.  They don't really appeal much at first, but as you listen to it, there's this one quality that starts coming out.  I am not sure what it is, but I remember experiencing the same thing that got me hooked on U2 and Radiohead.  ****  On Good Eats a couple nights ago, Alton displayed the following factoid: "The average American eats 11 steaks per year."  I laughed to myself, because my brother must be a very un-average American.  Since I moved in with my brother, I have never eaten so much meat in my life.  Steak, ribs, chicken, fish, etc...  that's all he seems to cook.  If you look within our fridge, you'll see mostly meat.  No wonder why I gained 15 pounds since graduating from college.

      "From: Katie Subject: Asdf You’re Just 3 steps away…"  Sometimes I get a kick out of automated junkmail that tries to disguise itself as email from a friend.  We all know that some spam that comes uses typical names like Katie, Joe, Dan, Mike, etc. to make it seem like it's coming from a real person.  However, sometimes when I install software or buy something or register for something online, I don't use my real name, and I put my fake email.  Fake email as in, the email address that I have set up specifically for shopping online and registering for junk.  Sometimes I put, "Some Guy" or "Asdf Qwerty" just to see what will happen.  Those funny email subject headers are what I get, and though they're junk, they sure are funny. :-)  It goes to show that when you register for something and you click "Don't send me any notifications of updates" or something of the like, you'll get email anyway.

      I was thinking over the weekend that in engineering terms, life is all about a feedback loop.  It's about doing something, seeing "the error signal," readjusting, and doing again.  We see positive and negative results of our actions, and readjust accordingly, constantly, or never.  God, let me be a person that constantly sees the results of what I do and say and learn from my mistakes.

      "With You there is forgiveness, and therefore You are feared."  —  Where Angels Fear To Tread , by Matt Redman  Do we fear Him for our forgiveness?  How can being forgiven by someone cause you to fear him?  The only way I can understand this is the this:  if the person is fearful, and you have wronged this person greatly, you fear him more for his restraint to forgive you.  Let's say I got on the bad side of a WWF — sorry, WWE — wrestler, and he isn't the forgiving type.  He's charging towards me with a chair in his hands and he's about to swing... pauses, sets the chair down, shakes my hand, and says, "It's alright, I forgive you."  Relief sets in, and I grovel at his feet saying, "thankyou thankyou thankyou for sparing my life."  "Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us"  There is a lot to this simple statement from our good Lord's model prayer.  'Forgive me in the same way I forgive others'... in view of the pain I've gone through this year, I am torn by this statement.  Forgive me, God, in the same way I forgive others...  So I guess that means that mentally you'll forgive me, but not in your heart?  I really don't understand the dichotomy between the heart and mind.  Before this year I used to believe a lot in the power of ideals, but my heart's uncooperativity was a swift lesson to believe otherwise.  So, back to that prayer of forgiveness, it makes me realize that one can only truly ask for forgiveness when one understands what it means to forgive.  That makes sense, doesn't it?  How can one who doesn't give mercy demand it from others for himself?  "God, have mercy on me" is a very frequent prayer of mine, but I see that I don't have an equal level of mercy on others.  Help me to forgive those that have hurt me, please.  Teach me to fear You, as well, by seeing how much I am forgiven.  With You there is forgiveness, and therefore You are feared.

      "Lessons Learned, Part I"  As promised, I am going to start serially writing about some of the things I was thinking about during my trip to NY this week.  On the train ride up, I was reading Colossians 1 and doing some heaving prayer and meditation about what it is I really need to change about myself, and how I need to do it.  I also asked God why is it that I still don't really experience the real aspects of salvation that I think I should be experiencing.  I wrote about what has been bothering all semester, "Forgive me of my sin as I forgive those who sin against me,"  and how I realize I'm the ungrateful servant.  These were things I asked.

      "Groggy"  I don't understand why I've been extremely groggy today, unless it's the baked eggplant ziti I've been eating the past two days.  It's all I've eaten.  Is it possible that I'm groggy because I haven't had a balanced meal?  Well, I held true to my promise so far up till now.  I haven't spent more than 20 minutes on the computer checking online journals, and I didn't go on AIM (except to add someone's SN on my list, but it was a "sign-on, add name, sign-off" deal).  I organized all of my papers, notes, etc.  I started to read my Biochem.  Then, I fell asleep again, and dreamed this weird dream.  I came home, and we had to get ready to go to a retreat.  To my surprise, it was Grace Life Church that was over at my house, waiting for me.  To my suprise, they were sleeping over because it was going to be a retreat overseas.  Even to my FURTHER surprise, I saw Eric Ahn, who is in Hope Chapel.  I think my brain was confused and smushing my two undergrad churches together.  So, I went to sleep, and awoke.  I got ready, then my mom told me I had to be at La Guardia; up till this point I didn't know it was a retreat overseas.  Furthermore, she informed me that it was free, but I had to be at La Guardia in an hour because everyone else left.  Confused, I asked her how I was to get to the airport with no one to drive the car back.  I never got an answer about that.  Panicked, I hurried my little brother to get ready as well.  We piled into my family's old Ford Taurus, and sped off to the airport.  It was at this point that the dream slightly shifted.  We were still heading towards the same place, but now we were characters in some cheesy '60s spy comedy show.  Our car was still an old Ford Taurus, but it was falling apart at all the secret hinges that concealed the fancy features.  For example, as we made sharp turns, one half of my seat slid forward, and one slid backwards.  I had to hold them down with my thighs to prevent that shearing effect, and drive at the same time.  It was frustrating, and we realized that the evil organization was trying to slow us down.  That's when I woke up... but you know, I feel more tired in my body than I was before I went to sleep.  I hope this isn't mono.

      "Rejuvenated Shock"  I was talking with a friend last night about how much work she had to do.  It was about 3 AM, and I was feeling sorry for her because of the stress I knew she must have been going through.  Then I realized that I should be in the same situation, and the shock of my Internet addiction was rejuvenated.  When I woke up today, I roughly calculated in my mind the amount of time that I spent on the Internet this week alone.  Within the past day, I spent a cumulative amount of at least eight hours of talking to people through IM.  I think I spent at least 50% of my time this week on the Internet, and I am ashamed.  Here I am, all proud that I got six hours of concentrated studying down in NY with my friend Jacob, but what's six hours compared with all that time wasted talking to people?  Granted, talking to people is NOT a waste of time, but if that's all I'm doing with MOST of my time, then it's a problem.  Again, I know this habit is rooted in my deep need for social contact, and AIM promises an instant gratification of that.  Hence the word, "Instant," in its title.  I've fallen into the lie that this form of communication is a suitable replacement for actually going and meetin people.  It is a good form of communication, because it does make us more connected, but it can only convey so much.  Shamed, I look at how much studying there is to be done, yet I complain that there's no time to do it.  Shamed, I look at the grievious annoyance I had this week of the ridiculous warning levels with which people teased me,  while I see that God was doing it to get me off and get me to study.  Lord, seriously, I slipped back into the habit, and I slipped hard.  Get me back on track; I ask of you with confidence, in the name of Your Son, because I have His righteousness for my right to request.

      "Courtship vs. Dating"  I think generally the problem with Christian culture today, in the way it tries to address the difficult issues of dating and male/female relationships, is that it stresses convictions as truth instead of stressing Truth to develop good convictions.  It says, "This way of doing something is wrong, and this new way, or old way, is right."  For example, there's that sentiment within many churches today that dating is wrong, a sentiment that I grew up having to hear.  But, dating is not wrong, it's just a conviction on how to finding a mate should be done.  Courtship isn't necessarily better, because some courtships can be handled very poorly as well.  However, there's this whole army of books coming out saying that Dating is wrong, or that those who date are unwise, or both, and that courtship is the holy grail of dating.  I've come to realize that the real issue isn't addressed by replacing a “faulty” way of finding one’s mate with another model.  The problems that are pointed out by all these churches and people are not problems that stem from the methods, they stem from the people that use the methods.  The real problem is that people don't comprehensively place their authority they follow in the right place: God.  They place the authority within their feelings, within their bodies, within created beings.  They become dependent upon the way they feel and the way they idolize their partner.  Those are some problems, but all problems come from our sinful inclinations, and that's where the Truth comes in.  Stressing the Truth versus some conviction goes like this.  It says, "Make your reference point for all you do the Gospel.”  The Gospel trains people’s hearts to know the heart of God, and those people that do so are the ones that handle dating/courtship situations with integrity and wisdom.  They make mistakes, but what's important is that they respond to them in a healthful, Spirit-filled fashion: in light of their relationships with God.  That shift in priority of authority to God’s Truth, the Gospel, is what should be stressed.  Thoughtfulness and a God-centered attitude comes from preaching the Gospel to the self in every situation, in every day.  It sounds like a formula, but it's not, because it is not a specific instruction to do one thing in one exact way for situations.  It addresses the heart of the issue: the human heart, with all of its senseless meanderings and distractions and attachments.  The Holy Spirit fixes it back on track by reminding it of the mysteries found in the Gospel, then makes it see that it doesn't need to make ultimately damaging patterns of emotional dependence, etc.  The heart instead forms patterns of selfless, God-centered love towards the other person in the relationship.  It starts doing all the right things because it is naturally doing them in every situation, not following a checklist of do’s and don’ts.  So, again, it all comes back to the Gospel, the guiding light of life, and in this instance, of finding one’s life partner, and keeping him or her.  So, that's my schpiel on dating.  And courtship.  Etc.  There really should be no debate about which way is better, all energy should be going into teaching people how to realistically and comprehensively apply the Gospel in their situations.

      Posted new poems onto  urlLink http://wordbattle.blogspot.com/ .  One serious, one not.  ****  I was thinking today about this class I took my last semester of undergrad called "Intermedia Studio."  It was a really cool class, I was in it with other Hopkins students, MICA art students, and Peabody music students.  God taught me a lot of valuable lessons through the projects we had to do, and through interactions with all the different kinds of people there.  One thing that stuck in my mind is this:  if you do any sort of art project, make sure that everything you do is relevant to its vision.  Good music, good art, good science is characterized by deep ideas being translated and communicated thoroughly and beautifully.  The reason I decided to post this topic is that I had an idea about art in the church.  What if we had some sort of event that brought together different artistic pieces that communicated some deep concepts that each artist knew about Christian life?  Maybe the event can have a musical performances, displays of paintings and drawings, multimedia installations, etc.  Maybe it can be run like this:  a theme is chosen, and the artists have to all produce a work of art that reflects their personal thoughts and experiences in response to the theme.  For example, the theme topic can be, "Communicate how your faith in the Gospel effects your everyday life, your experience, your consciousness."  The artists don't have to do isolated objects, either; they can pool their hearts and experiences to come up with a message that is worth communicating, then communicate it with their talents and resources.  Just thought that would be cool.

      Hi, atus. High 8s  Hiatus.  ****  The past four days have been a time of much needed reflection, meditation, prayer, and good ol' fashioned concentrated thought.  I got a lot of studying done, not just for school, but of the Word, and of my soul.  It's strange how much God can say in such a little amount of time.  I'm really tired right now, and I have to eat, but I will post some of the thoughts later, maybe serially.

      so tired, stayed up chatting and playing  urlLink this game .  had a great time in ny, will be on the train in about six hours.  yay.  ****  had some good time of thinking, studying, meditating, but I wonder... for what?  even with accountability,  I did the same thing tonight.  granted, I got a lot of studying done during the day, but i could have done even more.  seriously, one of the harshest things God is teaching me this year is that  there is such a dichotomy between my great ideas and reality .  I guess that means my ideas aren't so great, after all.  it calls to mind how, when we were all kids, we'd read bible stories and watch cartoons about some hero being faced with a situation and making a wrong decision.  we'd all say, "don't, you stupid! I would have totally done it the right way!"  but now that we've grown up —for me hardly. actually, i'm still pretty immature— we are starting to see that it's not so black and white.  i make the stupid decisions over and over again, and i can just see some distant observer saying, "stupid tim, you know what you're doing is wrong, why are you still doing it?"  God, saturate me from the outside in with Your nutrients of the soil in which You've planted me.  Cover me with Your righteousness and salvation, because there is nothing in me that is righteous.  give me the will to say, "No," and to appeal to Hope instead of Fear.  Christ, you are my only Hope.

Yakov and I studied from 1 to 6:30, with a small 10 minute break somewhere in between.  It was a good and productive jolt in studying.  We had dinner, and now we're back at his place, chilling like the cool cats that we are.

      "lord i want to be up in my heart  be ohh just in my heart, oh lord just in my heart, oh lord"  — the shining light gospel choir,  in my heart , by moby  I like this song.  Upon first listen, it's very moby.  the piano part that starts it off is very moby.  upon second listen, i think the same thing:   everything about this song screams, "hi, i am made by moby."   it's his style of using minor chords.  it's his style of using the pad of synthesized strings, and it's his typical beat.  this song is very moby.  ****  Oh man!  urlLink this is the CRAZIEST go-cart I've ever seen !

      reading jake's comment on my long post, i also wonder.  How come no one ever has any response to the long posts?  are they that hard to read?  ah. well.  the other day, God answered a prayer of mine within an hour after I prayed it.  i was amazed, and disappointed in the answer.  and the way He gave it.  but regardless, that's how He did it, and I am starting to see how wise He was in it.  Dangit.  man, i can be so stupid.  *banging head on desk*  ****  At jake's right now, trying to fall asleep, and Jake's reading on his bed.  I left New Brunswick at around 8 PM, got into NY at around 9:10, and got to jake's at around 10 because I took an express instead of a local subway.  arg!  we actually did get studying done for a couple of hours.  must do the same tomorrow!  ****  Did some good thinking and praying and reading and journalling in the train ride over.  also read a bit of colossians, and found myself reading the same thing that I've been wondering about:  what is this joy of salvation?  sometimes i really wonder why it evades me so.  but regardless, the following passage piqued my interest:  "Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation-- if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant." — Colossians 1:21-23  it's not always about feedback.  often times, it's about feedforward.  it's not always about one's immediate return.  often times, it's about one's future hope.  future hope.

      I just had a conversation that reminded me of a lot of things I thought I had conquered in Christ, a lot of them stemming from pride.  Being overconfident in one's perceived strengths leads to pretentiousness and egotistical patterns of actions.  Not just actions, but I say, PATTERNS of actions.  This delineation is important, because we always apologize for individual actions, but we fail to notice that they're from PATTERNS.  These problems are specific manifestations of our intrinsic sinful patterns.  The following are patterns that I've been starting to be convicted of:  1)  Addiction to people's attention to glorify myself, to give me self-worth  This pattern has led to my addiction to the Internet, to IM, to talking on the phone too much, to wanting to hang out too much.  I find myself spending hours chatting and reading blogs because I don't want to be alone.  I place my self-worth in this idol of "people" instead of God.  2)  Flaunting my knowledge and my insight  This pattern has led me to dismiss people's thoughts and make hasty observations about people.  It has led me to be pretentious.  How do I effectively preach the Gospel to myself?  How do I fight these tendencies and replace them with God-pleasing ones?  1)  Addiction to God's attention shown to me on the Cross, finding my self worth in meeting my function to worship Him with my obedience in life.  2)  Humbly listening and learning, yearning for His knowledge and His insight.  Hm.  These solutions still seem half-baked.  Regardless, after seeing my actions and tendencies and hearts desires today, I am ASHAMED... but am I ashamed ENOUGH?  Looking back on this year, God seems to answer prayers in ways that I've least expected, most of them in ways that I wouldn't have wanted them to be answered.  But, I think God answered them with difficult means because those were the only ways in which my heart would respond in a God-fearing way.  In other words, God surely answers prayers, but because of my stubborn heart, He has been answering them with very strong means. These means have usually ended up with me being hurt, shamed, and embarrassed.  I have such an overactive and quick mind, that I can assess what problems I have and immediately think up of reasonable solutions in no time.  But I have such a slow, stupid, stubborn heart and sense of judgement.  What results is me knowing something is wrong, and knowing that I'm wrong.  What results is me quickly acknowledging my fault, and quickly desiring to change.  I quickly pray, "Christ, heal me, fix this sinful tendency, replace it with a life-giving tendency."  But my heart doesn't follow suit, and I find myself going back to my old ways, to my frustration.  What will it take?  Why is my heart so fickle, unrepentant, and stubborn to change?  All day today, my heart kept wanting to go online and talk, to read blogs, to see if someone commented on this site.  That's just the beginning of the list.  I tried studying.  I was able to get three homework problems done, but it took four hours because I was too distracted.  All night, I watched TV, cooked dinner, and then I prayed that God would change me.  Then I went online again.  Do you see where the frustration is coming from?  This entry is not a plea for sympathy, it is far from it, for there is nothing righteous about my heart and its actions.  Simply, it is a  request for accountability, and for prayer .  These are the things that I have to change, because I've been struggling to do what I should be doing: study, learn, do what God has wanted me to do.  This is not a time to be distracted with wondering if some girl likes me and if I should pursue her, if I'm making a difference in peoples lives, if people are being changed by me.  I want to learn Grace, I want to be changed by it.  I want to know what spiritual blessings I have in Christ.  I want to know the riches of God's Grace, Grace that was freely given and lavished upon me.  I want to know what it means to be redeemed by His blood, forgiven of my sins.  Why am I not changed by these things?  Why is my heart not transformed and changed?  Why is my heart so cold to these truths?  Why are the flames of joy not fanned by the greater things mentioned, but instead by lesser things like video games, TV, and the Internet?  I think as mentioned before, my problem is this:  my mind is smart and quick, but my heart is stupid and slow.  Oh, stupid, slow heart, learn!

      Good morning.  It is currently 2:41 AM.  I have been trying to sleep for 2 hours and 41 minutes.  I have spent time talking to God, tossing and turning, showering, and now typing this entry.  ****  "Full Circle"  I've come full circle.  I was born and raised in New Jersey, went all over the place, and here I am, back at my roots.  A week ago my brother and I took a different route up north to home, and along that route we passed the old road my family used to take to go to our old church.  Back then, our church name was Agape (they're still around) and we used a church in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey.  That area in New Jersey is loaded.  Huge houses, nice mountain views, some of the best maintained roads in the east coast.  Why has God brought me back?  ****  "Sleepless"  I toss and turn, my mind a maelstrom.  I'm thinking about romance, issues, what I need to do, frustration that I'll probably slack.  I think about the message of Nirvana and the real grunge movement of the early '90s, because I just read an article earlier today about the song, "Smells Like Teen Spirit," because it was on MTV2 today.  It's funny that the media did exactly to the song, and to the band Nirvana, what Nirvana said it hated.  Sigh.  The media.  Everyone loves and loves to hate the media.  We all speak of its evils in brainwashing the public, yet we still depend upon it for our entertainment, for our weather reports, and for brain fodder.  I espouse these criticisms of my entertainment-focused mentality, but I fail to present a better alternative use of my time and joy.  I think about what I just read in Isaiah today about how God desires us to rejoice in Him, the Savior.  How do I really rejoice in Him?  I think a typical human problem is to assume that we know in our hearts what we understand in our minds.  That's why after listening to someone's predicament, we are so quick to offer our two cents on what they should do.  Hence, we become like Job's friends, offering advice that is unwarranted and ultimately useless.  If we really made a real effort to practice what jargon we know in our minds, life would be quite different in this world.  Particularly, mindless Christians that I've grown up knowing -- sometimes, I admit, I drifted into this category as well -- tend to hear a problem, and spit out their spiritual solution to the problem.  However, this solution tends to be a hodgepodge of more sentimental understandings of Christianity, and it's filled with more jargon than real applicable Truth.  Granted, non-Christians, most people do that, but I think when Christians do it, that carries more serious weight because it's the truth of God here that's being discussed, not just personal opinion.  For example, things like, "let go, and let God," or "give it up to God,"  or "trust Jesus!" sound great, but what do they really mean?  How do you REALLY do those things?  Do you just sit there and wait for the situation to fix itself?  It's much wiser to say something like this:  "Try your best, but stop appealing to a standard that says, 'reality depends upon your efforts.'  Create a standard that says, 'God is in control, and He purposes things to happen.' Then,  let go  of your ultimately self/man-glorifying standard,  and let God 's standard show you the path to a greater, more joyous mindset of tackling life and it's obstacles."  That is a more thoughtful way of applying "Christian-ese", because it has analyzed the real meaning of the phrase.  No more depending upon cliches!  Down with cliches!  ****  "Quiches"  The word cliches makes me think of quiches.  I could go for some quiche right now, I'm hungry.  My brother made this good cornbread sorta quiche dish for thanksgiving, yum.  Thanksgiving made me see how short a fuse I can have.  I thought I was a very patient person, but when it comes to my mom yelling at me or things not going as I plan, I start raising my voice and generally become crabby.  Yeah, a lot more to go in life.  Have to find what sinful tendency/mindset really underlies all of this...

Yahoo!  ****  For a period of time, my link list shortened up a bit, but recently, it's experienced a resurgence of new members, like andy, deborah, roger, and veronica.  i guess this fad isn't a fad anymore, but a new dimension of social communication, like instant messaging.  speaking of instant messaging, thanks to a consortium of friends that pushed my warning limit to 100%, I can't go online.  i must admit, that's a good thing: i have to study a lot this week.  ok, good night.  and dee, jacob, carol, does anyone else you know want to meet up for the tree lighting? since i can't talk through aim, email me with details about when you guys would meet and stuff! :-P

      "Turning Point"  It always seems that life revolves around defining moments, moments for which we have been preparing or not preparing over long periods of time, moments which call upon all that we have.  Doctors have prepared all of their lives for their daily defining moments of treating patients.  Engineers have prepared all their lives for their daily defining moments of efficiently and correctly solving problems.  Musicians practice scales and chords and study music theory in order to masterfully execute their compositions, spontaneously rap their thoughts, and tear out their emotions through distorted guitar signals.  Teachers study education theories and the subjects that they teach in order to effectively communicate knowledge and mold the minds of their students.  The list goes on; we are either in training for defining moments, or are in those defining moments.  ****  I sense that God is leading me to a turning point in life.  I don't know what it is, but I can just sense it.  I think it's because of the praise night.  I think it's because of my school work.  I think it's because of all that's happened this year.  Essentially, there are a lot of lifestyle changes that have to be made.  I've become too dependent upon my latent dreams to be a musical performer, too dependent upon the internet to stave off my loneliness, and too dependent upon entertainment to get me through the day.  I've ignored the real important things of my life at times for these lesser things.  I'm 22.  Am I a real man of God?  I fear that I've been investing too much time in the wrong things in life.  I fear that I don't know how to handle the important things in life:  God-given relationships, resources, and opportunities.  I am riddled with fear that I am the material of unsuccess, that I will not be able to be a good husband and father for a future family.  Clearly, those fears bely a lot of misplaced and erroneous priorities, ideals, and standards to which I hold myself accountable.  God, where do I go from here?  What do I do?

      There are those times in life where the reality sets in that all isn't well, and that all isn't bad either.  Simply, the important priorities of life become evident.  Naturally then the unimportant things reveal themselves, and life becomes a matter of choosing to focus on the important.  For example, I am in graduate school for a reason.  I don't know why God has placed me here, but I do know that it is His will.  However, I haven't really been focusing on graduate school, I've been spending more time pursuing my personal interests.  I've spent more time with church, hobbies, trying to discover my own social circles, finding 'her', talking online, and reading online journals than I have spent studying, focusing on my research, and applying for fellowships.  Reality of my situation became evident.  I overlooked the God's call to be a good steward by trying to create my own future, by pursuing my own interests for my own sake.  It is this subordination of God's will that God graciously allows, but it is this subordination that hurts us in the end.  For God leads his children into environments that will ultimately work out for our maximum good, but we complain because our expectations aren't met.  We then stubbornly pursue our own paths, and seek instant gratification... and frustration in life ensues.  Things don't turn out the way we want, relationships are mishandled, and we end up blaming God for "letting this happen".  As I have been stating in my entries for the past couple of weeks, I sense that God has showing me the real important things in my life.  In the process, He has shown me that I have to let go of habits and addictions and start praying and acting upon convictions.  I have and will make mistakes, but it is the Gospel that says that I am not just forgiven, but I am given the power to learn from them.  Christ give me the will to actually do the right thing.  The Holy Spirit makes the mental connections and emotive  urges that instill passionate learning.  As Christmas approaches, I am reminded again of the measure of God's love.  In the foreknowledge of our rejection, He still sent Christ.  In the face of His burning anger for our offensive actions, He still sent Christ for our benefit.  Love becomes apparent when we recognize the greatest Gift of all.  I hope that I can now do the right things in my life, in response.

      "The Road to Freedom..."  Is surely found in the Gospel.  I realize that in my pursuit of trying to "get" the Gospel, it has ended up changing me in ways I never would have expected.  I got off of the phone a couple of hours ago, it was a good conversation, in that it's the beginning again.  ****  "I'm a man, I'm not a child A man who sees The shadow behind your eyes"  — Bono,  Kite , from the U2 album  All That You Can't Leave Behind   Some really deep things hit me earlier today as I was practicing for the weekend.  Some core issues that I had forgotten about in my heart bubbled up as I thought about issues in my life.  I've been praying and asking God about why I am the way I am sometimes, when it comes to insecurity, laziness, etc.  It's not easy when He starts hitting you with the truth.  ****  "Then the master called the servant in. 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?' In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.   "This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart."   — Matthew 18:32-35  "You, however, did not come to know Christ that way. Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be  made new in the attitude of your minds ; and to  put on the new self , created to be like God in  true righteousness and holiness .  Therefore each of you must  put off falsehood  and  speak truthfully to his neighbor , for we are all members of one body. "In your anger do not sin": Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold."  — Ephesians 4:20-27

      Ok, so I don't have an important call to make.  I spent 3 hours sitting and calling, making dinner and eating like mad so that I wouldn't be eating while talking.  But, no return, and no pick-up.  I accidently snapped the earpiece holder for my headset, so I spent a half hour fixing it.  I was thinking about the genius of Ernest Hemingway, as observed in the book I read last year for American Lit.  I forget what it was called, but it was some of his earlier stuff: a collection of short stories.  The last story involved a guy that was surviving in the wilderness, being so intent with everything that he was doing that it made it obvious that it was almost a sense of coping with the pain of his past.  ****  I filled a pot with water and set it to boil.  In the skillet beside the pot, I cooked garlic, chopped fresh rosemary, and dried basil.  I would have used fresh basil, if I had any.  I found half of an onion in the fridge, and chopped it up as well.  I threw it in with the rest of the ingredients.  As they were cooking, I opened a can of whole peeled tomatoes.  I tried to squash them while they were still in the can, as suggested by the Food Network.  The onions became tender.  I poured in the tomatoes, and everything started to simmer.  At this moment, the water in the pot had risen to a boil.  I salted the water and put in the pasta.  Turning back to the skillet, I twisted in some sea salt, some black pepper, and poured in some frozen green peas for my health and for color.  There was some Italian seasoning nearby, and that went in as well.  There was time to spare, so I washed the knife, cutting board, and spoon.  The noodles were done.  I let the extra liquid simmer out from the sauce.  I strained the noodles, placed some on my plate, and ladled on some sauce.  In the top left corner of my refrigerator door sat the wedges of parmesan.  I grated parmesan over the pasta, and hurried to my closet.  ****  As I sat there with pliers and paperclip and black duct tape in hand, I carefully unbent the paperclip until it was perfectly straight.  I bent it in half, and wrapped it with a skinny strip of the black duct tape.  It fit perfectly within the headset.  Taking the headset clip, I bent the other end of the wrapped paper clip and fitted it around the broken tip of the clip.  I wrapped it with some more black duct tape, and pushed the fixed clip into the headset.  There was about half a centimeter sticking out of the bottom, so I bent it against the headset.  I walked to the bathroom to see how it looked; it was bulky.  ****  Today was a total bust.  I tried to study for biochem, but fell asleep for three hours.  I went to my lab, went online, then tried to read some more, then went home.  Tonight was a total bust as well, except for arranging and practicing mom's song.  ****  I've never felt so wrong as I do now, but it's strange; I don't feel bad.  I'm not overwhelmed with any feelings, in fact.  Time to sleep.

      I rearranged and am now practicing Geoff Moore's "Listen to Our Hearts" for my mother's thanksgiving service Saturday evening.  She published a book this fall in Korea, so as a measure of gratitude and worship to the Provider, the church is holding a thanksgiving service this Saturday.  My parents requested that the three sons perform a song, so, here I am, practicing it.  Joe, my little brother, knew my mom liked that song very much, so we're doing it.  Anyhow, more Lesson's Learned will be coming up later.  Right now, I have an important phone call to make.

      Extremely drained, I pedaled home after the final.  Well, ok, I went online for a little bit.  Ok.  I get the hint.  I'll close AIM right now.  There.  I did it.  ****  "Lessons Learned, Part III"  For those of you that know what I've been going through this year, I had yet another talk with Jacob about it.  Again, I was reminded of a lot of things that I have known in my mind which my heart has tried to suppress with its wounds.  "Forgive me of my sin as I forgive those who sin against me."   These words rang through my head all semester, and they rang true that evening.  Yes, I knew that real forgiveness is not conditional.  But to be faced with a situation where I have to exercise that, well, God, I know that You are doing all this because You love me, but it hurts.  In these sort of situations, the heart wants to nurse its wounds by claiming its righteousness.   I deserve an apology.  I deserve retribution.   It is in this instance where the empathy with God's situation in forgiving us hits; God is so slighted, so angered, so offended by our ultimate refusal to give Him His due.  God burns with righteous anger, because we have insulted Him with every sin.  In my case, I wish I could have the right to exact my vengeful desires, but I know that Idon't.  God, on the other hand, has every right to exact His vengeful inclination.  I guess when it is put in this light, the weight of His act of forgiveness and His ultimate sacrifice really hits home.  How can we who have such levels of anger over such petty things ever fathom the level of His anger for our sins against His Holiness?  It's like comparing a child's anger over not getting a piece of candy to a man's anger over the murder of his family; the comparison cannot be made.  It is in the face of such extreme anger that the sole Being deserves to have that we are granted forgivness and mercy.  Speechless.  I think it's this concept that is highlighted in Jesus' parable of the ungrateful servant.  How can we who don't give mercy demand it?  I'm still trying to get my heart to understand this concept; the Gospel becomes more mysterious every day.

      Final tomorrow.  Going to bike home in the freezing chill of the twilight, hopefully it will not invigorate me to be wide awake by the time I arrive home.  Necesito dormir.  ****  Do I have no willpower at ALL?  I notice that during the evenings I always go through a time of repentance and regret for all the stupid things I did during the day, vowing the next day shall be better.  Then, during the mornings, it's as if I've forgotten all the I vowed, and do the same stupid things throughout the day that I promised myself I wouldn't do.  *rolling eyes, throwing hands up*  When I talk about salvation, I feel and see myself being like "the boy who cried wolf."  All this talk feels so shallow, when my life is so slow in reflecting what I praise with my lips and promise with my words.  So, when the real storms hit, and when I really do cry out these things in much deeper honesty, it will seem to others and maybe even myself that it's not to be taken seriously. Or, vice versa, because of all I previously said was taken seriously, this real crisis that I would be reacting to would not seem as a greater crisis.  I am still caught in my heart with the message that I read and preach, because it still doesn't seem to be fundamentally something my heart is responding to.  It's times like these where I start to question the validity of the message of the Gospel in my life.  Then I realize that it's the Gospel that lets me recognize these things in the correct light in the first place, and it's the Gospel that keeps me headed forward.  I am inclined to sin, but my direction is headed Godward.  I will make mistakes, but I will learn from them.  It is the promise, the fact that I'm forgiven, the proof of history that keeps me fighting myself from repeating them.  Your blood that covers, the Life that rose, By cleansing, instead of condemning By healing, instead of hurting By giving, instead of taking From ash to wood, Your glory You chose  Justice in the form of mercy Justice in the form of love Justice for my sin With peace from above  How gracious a God, We delight in You. How wondrous a Savior, Your message is true, So we rejoice in You, Lord, we delight in You.

      "Lessons Learned, Part II"  "I delight greatly in the LORD;  my soul rejoices in my God.   For he has clothed me with garments of salvation  and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness,  as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest,  and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.   For as the soil makes the sprout come up  and a garden causes seeds to grow,  so the Sovereign LORD will make righteousness and praise  spring up before all nations."  — Isaiah 61:10-11  I studied this passage during a study break last Wednesday, and it blew me away.  Here is a passage that CLEARLY indicates, in the Old Testament, that God prophesied that He would impart salvation upon us, declare us righteous by giving it to us, not finding it within us.  With the soil and sprout analogy, I conjured up this image in my head of the roots anchored in the ground, and the water and nutrients seeping into them.  Just as the soil feeds and infuses life into the sprouts, so does God infuse us with His ingredients of life.  Then righteousness and praise may become characteristics of us, His redeemed.  How do we rejoice and greatly delight in our God?  We firmly root our hearts within His Word and  continually  renew ourselves with the message of the Gospel, the hope in what we are promised in Christ.

      anger is but a mere mention of the violence within that festers, waiting to escape from its prison of the walls created by society for the sake of peace.  dissatisfaction has been my creed, and i falter because i cannot seem to turn to the Source of life. i consider myself farther away than i've ever felt before, where are You, and where am i?  i'm gripped by this sea of hopelessness that i won't make it through today or life that You won't lead me to her that i am not a real man.  i feel slight twinges of pain in my heart but it's not pain of anger or guilt or sorrow. it must be the lack of sleep of staying up because i had nothing better to do.  i'm trying to hold together but then i see i'm not falling apart like humpty dumpty my emotions are stoic, but i see that my world crumbling because of what i didn't do.  i feared and walked away, i didn't want to do it turned, i turned, i turned i turned to the pursuit of my acceptance and here I am now, sitting, reaping the wheat.  brushing against my heart are the thoughts that i've wasted my time on this earth that all is lost but nothing's lost  I have to turn around and face the facts embrace the facts, pet the facts, groom the facts love the facts, believe the facts and act.  Nothing else but You are there nothing else but You does care nothing else but You will share nothing else but You are there.

      HAHAHA!  So, I was interested by this "googlism" thing that Jacob did, so I decided to put in "tim kang" to see what I would get.  No results turned up and it said something like, "we're sorry, the world doesn't know enough about tim kang yet."  Miffed, I typed in "timkang" and this is what I got:  Googlism for: timkang  timkang is no ordinary witness testifying on circumstantial matters  thank you, googlism, for clearing up my identity.  All is well with the world now.  ****  "Allnighter at the Lab"  So, I'm here at my lab pulling an allnighter to finish this take home final, and there was another guy here that I didn't know was here until now.  As I was sitting trying to figure out the problem (the last one! YAHOO!), I heard this weird snorting sound behind me.  I got up to see what it was, and found a snoring grad student lying on the carpeted floor under one of the computer tables.  Ok, grad school life is weird.

      For all of the years that I've been studying the body's innerworkings, it never ceases to amaze me how so much can be fitted into our tiny little heads.  So much personality, so much memory, so many skills, so many thoughts are stored, processed, and activated within our brains.  How could this be?  We have so many nerve cells and billions of neural connections in our brain, forming a highly interconnected network of programs.  It's a wonder that we can have so much within us, all stored as dendritic patterns.  How could God make us so complex with such little space?  It's a wonder.

For the rest of today, I will not use the computer or play any videogames.  I WILL finish this take home final.  I WILL.  ****  I've been listening to DJ Shadow.

My mind becomes interested in everything else in the world besides the pressing task at hand.  And if so, how do you successfully convince your body to stay put and study?  I'm always on the losing end of the battle against these impulses.  Ok, focus.

      "Ain't Misbehavin'"  I love this song.  I've heard two versions: one by Ella Fitzgerald, and one by Louis Armstrong.  It's a good, ol' time jazz tune.  ****  "Bad Accent"  I was talking with my friend John today about how some Korean accents can be pretty funny.  Take my dad, for instance.  Instead of saying, "You have a pimple on your neck" after giving me a trim, he'd say, "You have a pimp on your neck."  Or, when we were kids, he'd yell at us to "SIT DOWN" when we were horsing around.  But, he would pronounce the consonant "S" as "SH", so you can gather what it sounded like when he said, "sit down."  We hardly ever had the strength to contain our giggles, but we'd sit down anyhow.  Well, to save face, his accent isn't THAT bad, and he has a very good vocabulary.  Ahem.  Er, I mean, he's read a lot of books for the past 30 years, so he has a good command of PROPER English.  As well, I don't know anyone that has an extensive knowledge of the Word as my dad, he seems to know the reference to whatever passage you give him.  Ah, dad.

      After sleeping and cleaning my room, I flipped through the channels and found  Sleepless in Seattle .  I had never seen it before, and it was halfway through, so I thought I'd catch it.  I found myself having a lot of sympathy for the Bill Pullman character.  Such a caring, understanding, mature guy, and he gets blown off by this unstable female.  He goes to the length of TAILORING HIS MOTHER'S WEDDING RING for her... and for what?  She's liked someone else all along, and she's led him on.  And even when he knows she's going to reject him, he still puts on a gentle smile and lets her go.  Poor Bill Pullman character.  Didn't he play the Lonestar in Space Balls?   When Harry Met Sally  is on next.  I guess today is Meg Ryan romantic comedy day on TBS Superstation. :-)

      From this past weekend:        My mom.  ****  "Priority"  I watched  Black Hawk Down  after my final today, and the thing that struck me was that the thread of events happened because the Americans were commited to their priority: no one get's left behind.  All the tragic events wouldn't have happened if they had left the first guy, but they stuck to their priority.  Many more were killed and wounded, but there was always the same priority: no one get's left behind.  What would my life be like if I stuck to my priorities with such determination and zeal?  What would the church be like if it had that passion for the lost?  Would it be for better or for worse?  ****  "Doing What You Preach"  Last Sunday I strongly urged my kids to strive to see the reality laid out in Ephesians in their lives, and to make a difference in their lives.  Little did I expect that God would immediately put my encouragement to the test with my experience with today's final and with my illness.  God, I still don't know if I'm getting the picture, but I request with the rights given to be through your Son, please continue to reveal to me Your purpose and to match my desires to Your desires.

      "Hack, Cough"  I've progressively been getting sicker and sicker.  Last week I had the lowest energy levels, no matter what healthful foods I ate.  That made it very difficult for me to study for my finals.  Then, since past Friday, I've been having trouble sleeping because the nasal drip would cut off my lung air supply and cause me to wake up in mid suffocation.  I really need to see that PCP as soon as these finals are over.  This evening, it feels like I have the mucuous seeped into in my lungs now.  I try to cough it up, but nothing comes.  At least that's good... no discolored mucous means no nasty infection. At least, not yet, and hopefully, never.  ****  "Honestly"  I have to admit that this past weekend, I haven't really been spending quality time with Him.  It's not just guilt that I experience in response.  There's an emptiness that I only experience when I start putting off reading His Word and really digging into what He's saying.  I start to see myself as I really am without Him.  I see my unregenerate, selfish mindset creeping in as I talk with people, interact with my family, and handle my time and interests.  I see it as I respond to my environment with complaints and anger, as I lend ear to distracting sentiments and desires.  It's times like these that, again, show how much it is a miracle that I have gotten up to this point in life.  God really is gracious, He truly is the Author of my faith.  I have no claim, truly, other than the Grace of God for my righteousness.  Why?  Because I see glimpses that when I am left to my own volition, I immediately turn away from Him.  Truly, all have sinned, and fall short of His Glory; truly, no one desires Him on their own volition, no one is righteous.  How much more gracious He is that there are people out there zealous for God, building His Kingdom, fighting for His Glory.

      Biochem exam at 8 AM, Monday.  Today.  In 7 hours.  I'm screwed.  I don't understand why I have had such an adverse reaction to this material.  I don't understand why I am really just not liking this course, why I have complained all semester about the poor quality of the instruction and thus the style of learning they expect us to perform.  I complain it's shallow and detail-oriented, and not taught well fundementally.  But if I complain, I should back it up by doing well, since it's shallow learning.  But, I used it as an excuse to be lazy, to justify putting off studying for this course.  Did I mention that I was screwed?  ****  I am in Christ.  I have all His blessings.  I now have the ability to put off the old, to die to the old self, and to  put on the new .  What is the new self?  On the theoretical level, it's the self that is confident.  It's the self that is humble.  It's the self that's fully dependent on God.  It's the self that doesn't complain.  It's the self that is thankful for every opportunity granted by the Lord.  It's the self that is responsible with the resources and time given.  It's the self that is interested in God's Heart for those around Him.  Spirit, please renew this fallen mind. Refresh this fallen heart.

      Ok, so, I was doing a really long post about today, and it got lost.  Summary:  Tonight's service of thanksgiving for my mom's book publishing went well.  People were touched, and credit was given to whom it was due.  "Compliments"  I am not good at receiving compliments.  It has to do with the deep roots of sinful tendencies that God has been revealing to me.  These roots go back to early childhood; they have grown from this sinful pattern of self-perception.  It's going to take some very careful, Gospel-centered introspection for me to uproot these issues and replace them with a God-centered way of viewing the world and living in it.  Ok.  This short post doesn't do what I was writing justice, so I'll try to elaborate more on this subject in a later post.

      I just rediscovered the song "River Constantine" by Jars of Clay.  It was the only song I liked on that CD, and I repeated it for a month during my sophomore year of college.  I've been trying to figure out the song "Clocks" by Coldplay.  I mean, I basically figured out the chords because it's the same progression over and over again (except the bridge).  However, I'm trying to get at the music theory behind it, because I like the unconventional chord progression.  I really like Coldplay's sound; I see their musical development being on the same path as U2.  Coldplay's first two albums are good in some ways, just like U2's first two albums, but to me it doesn't seem like Coldplay has reached their musical individuality and peak just yet.  U2 didn't really hit a truly distinctive sound until War and The Unforgettable Fire, so let's hope Coldplay develops more on their third and fourth albums.  It's exciting to think what they'll put out in the future.  Yep, I'm still trying to learn music theory... not just theory for the intellect, but as a language.  ****  God, I sin, I don't know why; but, I've learned not to trust my "try and try."  How will Your Gospel get me by?  Sigh.  ****  When will I stop feeling like I'm misplaced?

      "Outsider"  I've always been an outsider, until I attended a college full of outsiders.  I guess that's why I felt so at home at Hopkins, but I digress.  I've always been an outsider and that was a constant source of insecurity and frustration growing up, but now I've learned that it's nothing to be afraid or ashamed of.  I obsess about things, make connections that people don't usually make, I tend to be more passionate about my ideas than most people tend to be passionate about anything.  But, this isn't a post about me, God forbid I write a self-centered entry in a site that serves as a communicative medium for my daily experience, wink wink.  No, I wanted to say that this is something that God has taught me about being insecure vs. secure, and what the real grounds for self-esteem is:  I am worth something, because God prescribed worth to me through the Gospel, and coming to terms with that truth has changed that problem with self-image.  The problem is still there, but having a confidence in a God-given sense of worth has a lot more potential than having a confidence from a self-born sense of worth that modern psychiatric practices prescribe.  However, I am still wondering about my existence at this moment:  why am I so lonely?  Why am I so bored?  Why am I so lazy?  It comes clear that these things arise when I start spending more of my time indulging in myself, in my body's desires... when whims and selfish desires become the driving force for existence.  God has saved us and made us to be vessels of action in the sea of this world.  When we stop too long at an island for rest and self-repair, we easily begin to forget the real missions for which we set out: to seek and save the lost, to spread the news of Christ, to obey and develop a working relationship with our Father.  The Hope of the Gospel, the fuel of our engines, becomes watered down from unnecessarily long stops in front of the TV, while pursuing hobbies, while reading self-help books.  God, I don't want to be overtaken by this lethargy, but I have been.  I have sought my pleasures in such weak things; I have forgetten the promise of unspeakable pleasures derived from participating in Your Work.  Literally, for Christ's sake, bring me back.

      Before I woke up today, I had the most vivid and disturbing dream.  The last part of it entailed me facing my middle school bully, who was trying to kill me.  He was chasing me down in what appeared to be a retreat center.  No matter what tactic I tried to stop and subdue him, he kept coming.  He didn't care that we had grown up: he still had this disgust of me that I found confusing.  Why did he hate me so much?  Just because I was a dork?  The dream ended in a good way, but I forget how it ended.  All I can say is that the dream left me disturbed and in shock when I awoke.

      Just thought this was interesting. Not conclusive in any way, but interesting:  " 'I don't believe in preaching at people,' he told me, during a 1982 interview. A constant theme in his music, he added, is the soul-spinning confusion that results when spirituality, sensuality, ego and sin form a potion that is both intoxicating and toxic. "The truth is that we are all sinners. I always include myself in the 'we.' ... I'm not telling everybody that I have the answers. I'm trying to get across the difficulty that I have being what I am."  Bono took this inner conflict on stage during the media-drenched Zoo TV shows of the mid-1990s. The key moment was when the singer morphed into a devilish alter ego named Mister MacPhisto, who wore a glittering gold Las Vegas lounge suit and cheesy red horns.  Night after night, Bono would pull some girl out of the audience to join in his "Elvis-devil dance." Stockman's book includes a fascinating account of what happened one night in Wales, when one of these dance partners had an agenda of her own.  "Are you still a believer?", she asked. "If so, what are you doing dressed up as the devil?"  Their voices hidden by the music, Bono gave her a serious answer. "Have you read The Screwtape Letters, a book by C.S. Lewis that a lot of intense Christians are plugged into? They are letters from the devil. That's where I got the whole philosophy of mock-the-devil-and-he-will-flee-from-you," said Bono.  Yes, the girl said, she had read The Screwtape Letters. She understood that Lewis had turned sin inside out in order to make a case for faith.  "Then you know what I am doing," said Bono.  But no matter what happens on stage, plenty of believers remain convinced that Bono's devil suit was highly appropriate. While the singer and his band mates have made some mistakes, Stockman said he is convinced that the controversies that continually swirl around U2 are actually evidence of deeper divisions among believers.  U2 is attacking, in word and deed, the modern church's retreat from art and popular culture."  — from  urlLink http://stocki.ni.org/u2/atu2.phtml   As well as this:  "As Stockman himself admits in Chapter 6, their lack of commitment to a local church fellowship is a major issue arising from both their peculiar circumstances and the nature of mainstream evangelicalism more generally. Yet, though evangelicalism is chronically deficient in this regard, surely such a context is necessary to have personal faith sustained and artistic visions maintained. Has the lack of such a context meant that the Christianity of U2 has been emptied of its exclusive content? Is there a danger that if we adopt the attitude of U2 to the world and involvement in the church we, at the same time, will capitulate to the ideals of the world? What is more, are all of us called to push the envelope in the imaginative ways U2 have done?   offer these comments not as criticisms, but as personal reflections upon an issue that has profound implications for evangelicals. Steve Stockman rightly sees U2 as a challenge to the church. They display a heartfelt honesty in dealing with spiritual questions arising from the harsh realities and contradictions of modern life. They provoke us to examine our modernity infested and culturally determined beliefs in the light of a radical discipleship predicated upon grace and love for others. It seems to me that the example of U2 encapsulates the tensions involved in any Christian engagement with the world and the danger of drifting from communities of faith. In that context, the questions asked about U2 should not focus upon their personal faith, but the more important issue of whether or not we should follow their example of engagement with the world.  This review was by Andrew Holmes, the only man who could make a PhD in Presbyterian belief and practice in the 19th century seem sexy."  — from  urlLink http://stocki.ni.org/u2/studentnet.phtml

      I was wondering why Christmas is sometimes abbreviated with Xmas, and then I'm wondering:  Maybe it's because Christ in the original Greek is "Xristos", where the Greek letter X, or "chi" pronounced "KYE", is the first letter.  Hence, maybe Xmas is really CHImas.  Or, X could be like a cross.  Oh wait, a lower case "t" would be more fitting.  I like that first theory better.

      "White Christmas!"  It looks like Bing Crosby's dreams are coming true this year!  I can't remember the last time we had one here, but it looks like there will be about five to six inches of it this Christmas.  Ah, I love it.  Merry Christmas, everyone.

      "Regret, Return, Relaunch"  Looking at the past half year that I've been here at Rutgers, I have seen myself regressing and progressing in spiritual, mental, and musical development.  But I think I've given in too much to the slacker environment I find myself, and have become soft, lazy, undisciplined.  I can't stand that I'm giving into the narrowminded, lazy, cheap entertainment oriented, materialistic mindset.  The fact that I'm surrounded it, and the fact that those elements lay within me make it all the harder to do the right thing, and that has been the case in terms of shirked responsibilities.  I really don't spend real time with Him, talking and praying and listening and meditating and worshipping.  My passion has digressed to the things of the world.  I have lost sight of the Gospel.  I have lost sight of what God has called me to do.  What will it realistically take to go further?  Firmer dependence on God means firmer determination to focus my time on priorities, not distractions.  God realistically answers these prayers by having us ACT and do the RIGHT THING.  So, I have to write out my priorities and distractions.  I have be ruthless with myself at times to push towards the goal at then end of the journey.  I have to focus.  I have to enjoy and rejoice, but I have to focus.

      "Break On Through To the Other Side"  Stuck back in the music and computer binging. When I will I start changing instead of returning to the same vices?  ****  Whom is worth knowing in this world?  I get so many conflicting views from different people about how to deal with individuals that hurt you and are close to you, family or friend.  One camp says forget and move on . One says that things will work out, and to stay loyal.  Another says get revenge. But what really is the Godly way to deal with people that hurt you?  We all are —hopefully— familiar with Jesus saying to forgive the person seventy seven or seventy times seven times over.  My personal conviction aligns with this: God has forgiven me more than I can ever know, and I am to do the same as a result.  But people that know that as well say, "Yeah, so what. You're still human.  Forgive, then forget... them.  Just cut yourself off from them.  There are six billion other people in this world."  I say NAY to that, but that is what people,CHristians that I know, say.  They call me a person with a battered wife syndrome, giving excuses for unnecessary hurt.  I guess.  But one can say that about Christ, as well.  ****  I'm shaking my head at myself right now.  How materialistic can I get?  How judgemental and unrelistic can I get of people, living a double standard with my life?  For example, this past week I was talking to someone about staying true to one's word, and about being responsible.  Then, I promised my little brother that we'd take him to see "The Two Towers" Sunday night —today— and I fell through.  I forgot to tell Him that we couldn't do it.  It's the small things that show really how sinful and selfish and shortsighted one can be.  I have a long way to go in terms of maturity.

      Had a great time in New York:  Friday Transportation:  $13 round trip, $4 unlimited ride day pass.   Chinatown   Got a haircut at the place that Jacob told me about.  Wow, great service for $10, and with tip it was $12 dollars.  After the cut and trim, they shampoo your hair and give you this really relaxing scalp massage.  I think I'll go there again in the future.  I went window shopping for presents and to buy a ski cap for myself.  I ended up getting 2 ski caps and a headband for $11.  On the way to the subway I got a mango pearl smoothie.   Downtown   I took the 6 up to transfer to the FV, but I got a bit lost in the transfer because I went the wrong way down Lafayette.  Ah, well, it was ok.  I was only ten minutes late in reaching the Rockefeller Tree to meet up with MC Jamie P, her brother Gene, and his friend Elson.  Gene and Elson were visiting, and it was Elson's first time in NY.  It was lightly raining, so they didn't want to ice skate.  We hung out at the NBC tourist shop, then headed over towards Times Square.  Along the way we stopped by Sam Ash and checked out guitars, since Gene was looking into getting an electric.  I gave him my shpiel about what's good and bad, and jammed a little... it was fun :-).  We continued on to Times Square, where we got $54 to see the musical  42nd Street , then headed over to Virgin Megastores.  I got myself Coldplay's new album and a gift for my little brother.  We waited to meet up with Ajin, who came back up from Baltimore, and ate at Angelo's Pizza on 57th and between 6th and 7th.  It was by far the best pizza I've ever had: light, not greasy, simple, everything made fresh, delicious.  Pizza at its finest, and not bad price either.  After chilling there for a while, we took the bus back to Times Square in time for the show.   42 Street   It was great!  It was my first show, and it was the first time I've seen a live company of tap dancers doing their thing.  It was really well done: the sets, the acting, the dancing, the big musical numbers.  It was definitely a good 'ol throwback to the heyday of Broadway.   urlLink Tom Wopat , who played  urlLink Luke Duke  in the show " urlLink The Dukes of Hazzard " was in it... that was pretty cool.   NYU Med   Afterwards we headed over to Jake's and played a card game called "Nerts" —Pika, there has to be a better name for it. How about "Farts"?  That'd be funny.— that can be described as competive Solitaire.  We played for a while, until like three AM, then headed over to a nearby deli to get some grub.  Ah, so embarrassing:  I was going to pay by credit card, but they had a $10 minimum.  I had used up all of my cash by that point, so everyone had to cover for me.  I was thankful, but shamed.  By the time we had headed back and finished eating, band geek MC Jamie P, Gene, and Elson had to head back so that she could catch her flight, and they could catch their sleep.  I was too tired to stay up to catch the first bus back, so I crashed at Jake's.   Downtown and Back Home   The next morning, I headed back to Penn Station.  Since Macy's was only a block away, I headed over and got Christmas presents for my older brother and parents.  I caught an express back to New Brunswick and biked all the way home: about ten miles, I think, from the station to the northern outskirts of Busch campus.  Whew.  What a weekend.  I spent a grand total of $208.95, to be exact... in 24 hours.  That's more than I spend on average in like a month!  Ah, but great memories.  I felt like a tourist at times, when we were showing Elson and Gene around.  But no way, I ain't no tourist!  And as for you, John Kim, I don't know what all this "wannabe NYer" junk is.  I don't want to be one.  I ain't gonna lie and say I know or "own" the city, but I'm just taking advantage of the incredible resources found in it.  And dude, you know that I've always been loud, sociable and brash.  Plus, I've always been a fast walker.  I think I've been a NYer at heart, in some ways, since I DID LIVE HERE once.  Eat that, buddy! :-P  ****  I got some thinking done as well, and I have a lot more prayer to do. God, help me.

      I'm tired of going through these times where my sentiment and mind tells me that everything is wrong.  It happens from time to time: these thoughts and emotions try to convince me to be lethargic and unmotivated, to turn my attention to diversions in order to avoid reality.  Mind you, in real life, I don't go around pouting and demanding everyone to do what I say.  At least, I hope I don't.  ****  There has always been a contempt inside of me for people that are cliquish and box people out of their myopic circle of people that they are comfortable with.  They are polite, half the time, if an "outsider" tries to "enter" in by saying hello and being polite, maybe even try to start a friendship, but the other half they just brush you off.  I think out of any other trait in people, this is the one that would get me on my nerves the most, especially when I see people that say that they are Christians do it.  There is  no effort  to "love your neighbor as you love yourself", and as Christ said in Luke 6:32-33, "If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' love those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' do that."  It really angers me when I go to churches and see that activity rampant.  Then, I look at my own life, and see that I'm no better.  I trick myself into thinking that I'm open-minded and am a good outgoing person.  Throughout college, friends always said to me, "Tim, face it. You know EVERYONE on this campus."  But, looking at my link list on my page and my AIM buddy list, and I find mostly Asians of the Christian mindset.  Sure, I still try to keep in touch with people outside of that web and have many friends that aren't Christian Asians, but the ones that I try to connect and maintain relationships are predominantly in that niche of people.

      "Contacts"  I haven't worn contacts for about a year until today, when necessity called.  I lost my glasses.  I am again reminded of why I don't like wearing soft contacts:  — They are uncomfortable.  I think because I have such a strong prescription, they're thicker than normal people's contacts and therefore more annoying to wear.  I feel them constantly.  — As a consequence of them being uncomfortable, I have to constantly blink my eyes.  — They are blurry.  Sure, I have restored vision, but there's always a slight haze when I blink or dart my eyes.  Why am I complaining?  At least they work :-)

      I've not been satisfied because there is the overwhelming suspicion that for the past year and a half since the close of my junior year, I've seen myself progress deeper into a sinful, idolatrous lifestyle.  There are pretty deep issues that I don't want to go into right now, because I'm a bit tired and I'm frustrated with the fact that my new sound card is refusing to install correctly.  I've been preaching to my kids to "get the Gospel in a realistic, passionate way", and I've come to realize that it's something I should preach more to myself to anyone else.  Oh, for this year, I wish to be truly transformed by His Grace, to be freed from my sinful directions and free to live Life.

      In my successes I failed; My heart's excesses prevailed.  ****  It's 2:31 AM.  It is now 2003.  Thanks to the whim of the SciFi Channel's programmers, I am up watching The Twilight Zone marathon.  Otherwise, I'd be staring at the screen, wondering why I can't shake this overarching sense that my life is just wrong.  Thanks to the time capsule of TV, I am now watching familiar actors in their younger days of acting.  William Shatner goes crazy over a gremlin on the airplane wing and a cheap fortune telling machine in an Ohio diner.  Charles Bronson ruminates his nihilistic thoughts concerning war, and tries to flirt with the female enemy soldier.  There's this stark quality about the show that always grabbed me.  Maybe it is the jazz score, or the black and white photography.  Or, it could be the cheesy moralistic plot lines, the mistakes like how the guns used in that Charles Bronson "love story" episode didn't have hollow barrels.  Whatever the case, I enjoy this show.  ***  New Year's Celebrations are something I've never done.  I always have had to go to church to hear my dad drone in Korean.  This year was different, but it still was not satisfying.  ****  My current way of life doesn't satisfy.  In fact, I'm not sure when I've been satisfied.  I don't even know what sort of resolution or goal I have for this year, unlike last year.  I say all these things, but I don't even know if my life reflects them either.  I just don't know.

To take the cup To fill it up, to drink it slow. I can't let you go."  — from "Acrobat",  Achtung Baby , by YouTwo.  Something I've been listening to recently.  ****  Rent money's running low Can't see where my time goes I flee into my fantasy, To instant pleasures that I see  But it won't seem to go away Solutions don't want to come my way Problems mount up everyday Is this the price I have to pay?  The Gospel's Hope, Lord, is it real? Real life blues make it hard to deal Promised treasures stored for me... Is the Best Thing truly free?  How does this help me with the rent? How will it give me much needed cents? Show me, teach me, let tme see, This life you give abundantly  I pray to you, I'm still hungry The Gospel's truth: Lord, let me see This joy you speak of so highly I want to know your Glory  But it's something I still can't see Something that I cannot see Something that I want to see Something that I yearn to see.  ****  Nothing much else to say here.

      "Racist Ideal?"  I have a question.  Should minorities be suspicious of the romantic ideal of a "White Christmas," when it was borne from a song written by a Jew named Irving Berlin and sung by a white American named Bing Crosby?  Then again, I don't see how a yellow or black or tan Christmas would ever sound romantic.  Just a funny thought for the day. :-)  ****  I am starting to get a bit tired of posting on my online journal these days, but I'll probably still be doing it.  This has been the fruit of an idea that I had since my freshman year of college.  Now that I've actually been living it out, it's a bit different and more than what I had envisioned.  Well, in both good and bad ways.  I think it has been fulfilling its mission, but it has taken up a lot of time.  ****  "New Year Prayer/Resolution"  My new year's hope is to simply make it through the year in one piece, and to make it through with more maturity, responsibility, and joy.  This hope entails me being more strict with giving into sinful temptations, more liberal in enjoying God's joys, and more energetic in doing what He's called me to.  God, please fix me and build me to be Your man.

      "Spiritual Warfare"  I find it interesting that when my passion and hard work is needed most, apathy and depression work to keep those dreams from becoming actualized.  It's no coincidence that apathy and depression come when I'm called to do groundbreaking work for church ministries, fundemental things for school, and life-giving support for friends and those around me.  Isn't it funny how Satan works?  He doesn't commonly work in the typical way that we all think, by tempting us to overt, "horrible" sins.  He does it surreptitiously by using our desire for pleasure to justify doing life-stealing things.  I can't pinpoint any quote that C. S. Lewis said to help elucidate this point, but it's a running thread through much of his works, most notably in "The Screwtape Letters."  That was the essence of the first temptation/sin:  find your desire in lesser, self-centered things.  People probably come onto my blog and think me to be a morose, depressed, high maintenance person.  They do not realize that thoughts are not entirely reflective upon what I am like in real life.  Nor do they do not realize that what I try to post are deep issues that I go through each day —for the most part— that most people don't want to deal with or think about.  For example, I am not satisfied with the status quo of an entertainment-driven life.  Yet, I am frustrated because I am habitially caught up in it, due to the environment I was raised in and my personal iniquity.  I'm not sure what to do this year, nor for what I should pray and strive, because of this overwhelming sense of apathy and failure.  In the past, I was perplexed with why I would enter these episodes.  Are they physiologically derived?  Possibly, because my mother frequently gets caught in a stage of depression.  Maybe bipolar disorder runs through my family, who knows?  Regardless, I noticed, as stated previously, that these episodes come when I need them least: crucial times of my life that call for my utmost effort, energy, and passion.  It is a miracle that I am typing this today.  If it weren't for the hope I have in Christ, I probably would have done myself in a long time ago during one of these bouts.

      FINALLY! SOMEONE NON-ASIAN SAID SOMETHING RIGHT ABOUT SHAQ'S RACIST COMMENTS.  Sadly, it's Bill Walton.  Well, he's not so bad, it's just, he stinks at commenary on live games.  But at least he was closely on the mark with this following editorial:   urlLink Shaq should've thought before he spoke   If you don't know anything about the issue at hand, go to the following link:   urlLink Shaq's Apology Not Good Enough   The overall downlplaying of Shaq's comments by the NBA and his team are understandable in that they want to protect their fellow man... but when it comes to him doing something that indicates a deep, culturally ingrained racial bigotry, it shows that their support reflects a similar culturally ingrained racial bigotry.  We who have grown up in this country have at least once in our lifetimes had to deal with this sort of crap at least once.  I'm pretty mad, but, more sad since our culture at large generally is unable to see the real issues at hand.

      "Random Pictures"        I love the dawn, especially when I get to see it in my backyard.        I made this back in junior year.  I thought it was cool.  I called it "passion"; I made it during Easter time.  Different iterations had the pictures separated to have a white cross formed by their spacing.  I took this picture of Bono from the cover of "Wide Awake In America" because it seemed to capture the raw passion of the moment, and decided to repeat that image of passion to outline the cross.  I thought it was a cool idea at the time, anyhow.

      Something that I was thinking about when reading  urlLink someone's blog entry  was the difference between our hearts and our minds.  I believe that the reason it exists is because of the two are inherently different things; it's like comparing apples and oranges.  I have thought of a good way to explain the difference and the dichotomy by using the following analogies.  1)  Our hearts are like vessels, our minds like the sailors and passengers on these vessels.  Learning new things and recalling concepts are like taking on new passengers and taking a survey of their demographic.  It is the relatively direct and mechanical tasks of loading on new information and surveying what's in there.  However, changing the heart requires a deeper metamorphosis, because you are changing your personality and tendencies.  This concept is similar to changing the actual properties of the vessel.  It can happen through external circumstances, like barnacles and water damage eating away at the hull of the ship, or the ship colliding with dangerous obstacles in the sea.  And so it is with our hearts: our personalities are shaped by the hurtful things people do to us, or situations that we find ourselves in.  Change can also happen to the actual properties of vessels from the inside, like the sailors neglecting their duty to take care of the vessel, or the sailors adding improvements to different parts of the vessel.  And so it is with our hearts: we use the concepts we learn through philosophies, religions, psychiatrists, self-help books, etc. to mold our personalities.  So, that's where the dichotomoy/difference can be understood:  our hearts are the vessels, our memories the inhabitants.  Is the analogy making any sense?  Try the next one.  2)  For you fellow science heads, the difference is analogous to the difference between physical change of matter and chemical change of matter.  Physical changes of matter are more at a mechanical level: you can pulverize and chop the object, but the intrinsic properties of the matter are the same.  Chemical changes are at the fundemental level: you change the actual chemical makeup of matter when you burn something, when iron rusts, when you bake a cake.  What does this have to do with the mind and the heart?  The mind is more physical: it operates to store and compute data, it does things at a more mechanical, computational level.  The heart is more chemical: it is the essence of the person, it is more fundamental.  So, the mind can store all the data it wants, but that data doesn't necessarily reflect the fundamental essence of the person because it hasn't actually changed any personality.  A piece of paper "remembers" you cutting it by staying cut, but it is still a piece of paper.  You can fix a bad memory by relearning material, just as you can fix that cut paper with tape.  Contrariwise, the heart can suffer extreme rejection and pain, but the mind cannot grasp why it cannot recover automatically.  A piece of paper is changed by a match's flame, and you can't tape it back together to restore it.  It would require you to change the chemical makeup of the ashes to restore the piece of paper.  Therefore, learning and knowing something in your mind differs from learning and knowing something in your heart because they have different inherent natures.  The first is more "physical," the second more "chemical."

      According to eMode:  "Timothy, you're an Observer!   That means you're one of the more kind-hearted people around. You are unusually intuitive, and you probably understand yourself, as well as others. That also means you're a good mediator — though you may prefer to spend more quiet time on your own than most."  I guess.

      "Projection"  One thing I notice about animal lovers —at least, some of them— is that they try to project human qualities on their pets.  They coddle, talk to, feed, and even  urlLink dress these animals up into little humans .  Sometimes I would question the sanity of the lengths that people sometimes go, since there's no way an animal can appreciate, on our level, what's being done to them.  But, if you think about it, these actions reflect our purpose instated in Genesis: to be the caretakers of the earth.  I notice a similar pattern between parents and children.  Parents try to project their ideals and hopes in their children.  They send them to church, to camp, to school, to wherever in hopes that their children will grow up to be better than them.  These patterns of humans reflect the situation of God projecting His image onto us.  I liken this relationship to be most similar to the relationship between humans and their pets because of the great intellectual distance between the two parties.  God puts us through obedience school through all of these different situations in life, in order to discipline us —that is, us that are adopted in Christ— and project His ideals within us.  That projection of purpose seems to be the reason why we live this life, I suppose.

      "Meltdown"  Have you ever had a brain overload?  Like, say, have you found yourself inunundated with mounds of useless information until everything numbs over and you blankly read/stare/watch/listen with glazed eyes and sedentary body?  You see yourself doing the same things, reading the same stuff, watching the same junk, and yet you can't do anything to stop.  You feel removed, as if you're watching a bizarre copy of yourself doing everything... and you yell and scream, but nothing happens.  "Wake up," you bellow, "and get a move on!  Do something, just do it!"  But your body just sits there, tapping away on the remote, on the keyboard, on the mouse.  Broken, tired, your mind gives up hope.  The body keeps staring, watching, reading, listening.  You feel the exhaustion, but your body won't rise to go to bed.  It just drifts away, as you stand with the ropeless lifesaver.  So, you plunge into the waters to save it.  You busy yourself with trips to escape your environment, organizing events, doing schoolwork, meticulously involving yourself with projects.  But all this splashing hasn't brought you any closer to your drifting self.  You cry out for help, but no one wants to contribute a rope long enough to pull your body in.  Instead, you hear shouts of instruction:  "Swim this way!"  "You're not asking for help enough!"  "You're depending on yourself too much!"  "You have to..."  "Just do this..."  But no one actually ties the rope to your ropeless lifesaver and throws it out.  You wait in the water, by the dock, as you see your body float away.  Your mind is gone.  You've experienced a meltdown.  You repeatedly hear the same advice.  You see your despicable situation.  You are tired of feeling sorry for yourself.  You want to live life again... but that missing link is still missing.  You can't figure out why you're stuck.  And even when you hear the answers, you still stay in the same cage.  You don't know what to do anymore.

      In relation to my last post, here are my actions and symptoms:  — Intermittent, if any, real conversations with God.  More specifically, less praying, less reading His Word.  — Selfish, malicious tendencies are either developing or unearthing themselves.  I cannot tell if these are bad things that are growing into my personality, or bad things that laid dormant in my personality.  Things like, a growing disregard for other people's well-being and feelings, putting others down for my humor, listening to negative thoughts and feelings.  — Laziness, increased indulgence in unhealthy habits like TV, video games, etc.  — Growing disinterest in church matters, in friends, in anything.  Decreased pleasure from hobbies.  — Lack of motivation to do work, to take care of "mundane" details of life.  Is this phase "the dark period" that everyone tells me happens during the first post-undergraduate years?  Why have I been caught in this state?  I do not know.  I have learned in the past that it is imperative to retain my grip on the Gospel, to escape excessive passive acceptance of my feelings.  I have learned that God is most glorified in me when I am most satisfied with everything that He is, that He promised, and that He has done.  The thing is, I have become so self-centered and mired in patterns of self-centered patterns, it has been very difficult for my heart to be sensitive and responsive to Him.  I have never felt so lost.  I have nothing of my own to grab on to anymore.  True, I am never beyond the reach of His Grace, but somehow, that phrase doesn't comfort me, because my heart doesn't understand it.  I see myself reverting to the spiritual state that I found myself in during sophomore year of high school.  I get all serious about this state I'm in, and ask God to rescue me, to strengthen me to change, to give me the power to say "No" to myself.  But, the next day, I fall back into the same pit.  I will keep my head on that piece of sky i see up there, but it still sucks.  I don't know how to fight myself anymore.

      "Sinking"  Have you ever felt like you were sinking?  I feel like I'm sinking all the time these days.  It's not just feelings, but as well my actions seem to point that way too.  It seems like these times were meant to transform the things I know in my mind into things I know into my heart.  How could I complain?  I've been living a life of absolute bliss, in terms of humanistic standards.  I just can't seem to escape this pit.  I thought last week was a good time to rejuvenate me, but here I am, pulled by and doing the exact same things.

      "Pomp and Flatulence"  When I was getting a ride to Penn Station yesterday, I smelled the acrid odor of human flatulence in the air.  I tried to stifle my laughter.  Who did it? It wasn't me.  There were two other people in the car.  We were in the middle of a conversation when I first smelled it.  I was going to comment, but it didn't seem right.  I really was trying my hardest not to laugh.  I have a feeling the girl did it, because the guy in front of me acted like nothing happened.  I started to think that maybe I was imagining things... until the girl opened the window on her side.  Hm.  Maybe the guy did it.  HAHAHAHA.  Oh man, that was SO funny.  I don't know about the other two, but I sure felt, I mean, smelled the tension in the air.  HAHAHA. Ok, one of you two will have to confess who did it.  HAHAHA.

      Today's dinner for Dee was a wonderful night of meeting new people and getting to further know the ones I've had the pleasure to meet over the course of this past semester.  It was also very important time for me; this week as a whole was a very important time for me.  It's been very eye-opening to see how selfish I was, how selfish I am, and how selfish I have become.  I have become so self-oriented, caught in a vicious cycle of feelings, inaction, and excuses.  During college, I saw people that had become "vegetables," and I looked down upon them.  I couldn't understand how anyone could be so lazy, just eating junk food, playing video games, and watching TV.  I felt that it was despicable, unmotivated, and ultimately useless.  Then, I saw myself gradually become that person for the past year and a half.   What happened?  I thought.  I do know this one thing:  it has taught me not to judge or look down on others as much anymore.  We read stories about people doing despicable and crazy things.  We condemn them.  We watch movies, listen to music, read books, and verbally rip them apart without having done things like them ourselves.  We see people in deadend jobs, homeless walking the streets, and instantly form our opinions.  How do we learn how to give grace to those we come into contact from day to day?   I think a key element is to fight that human impulse to categorize people we meet.  We always try to fit people into this predetermined box/category in our minds, and treat them accordingly.  This tendency is dangerous, and it causes a lot of tension, doesn't it?  We create unreasonable expectations too much, and give grace too little.  Ok, I can't find a way to conclude this, so I'll end here.

      IT CAME!  After I got back from Dee's birthday dinner, I saw the tiny cardboard BMG box sitting on my coffee table.  Inside:  CHARLIE BROWN'S HOLIDAY HITS!!!!!  I think of all of my favorite childhood cartoons/comics, I always resonated most with Charlie Brown.  I loved the cartoons, the comics... the music.  This CD is already going to be one of my most treasured, I just know it.  I remember my mother taking me on weekly local library trips.  The first thing I always would do is run over to the stacks that had the Peanuts comics collections.  I would pull the book out, and sit down for at least an hour or two to finish reading the one I had picked.  I remember always getting excited to watch the Charlie Brown specials, the Christmas one being my most favorite.  I remember trying to plunk out the theme song, "Linus and Lucy", out on the piano.  Thank you, Charles Schulz, for the timeless world that you created.  Thank you, Vince Guaraldi, for these timeless musical masterpieces.

      When are the conditions ever going to be the way that we want?  We give excuses for undesired things done or felt because we demand a condition to be met.  We want the best gadgets, the best cars, etc.  Are extra features worth the extra money?  Is life worth spent earning cash so that you can get that extra luxury?  Will life really be better after you get it?  Are you going to be happier if you got the sleep that you wanted, the more vacation, the future spouse, the vacation home, the latest video card, the next CD?

      Scientists know what they are talking about, but they don't know what they're talking about.  "Eh?  Care to explain this one, Tim?"  Ok, I will.  Let me just preface with this statement:  science takes a lot of intelligence, perserverance, and creativity.  It is very hard to do, let alone do well.  Science is not just a collection of facts and figures, but as well it is a highly developed construct of ideals and philosophies to plausibly understand how the world works.  So I'm not dissing science, or scientists (seeing as I'm studying to be one myself).  It saddens me, though, that the general public seems to view science and the scientists of the present day in the same way that people in the past viewed magicians and religious figureheads.  I get that notion from the way people generally reason that science is about "cold and hard facts", that "reason is above belief", etc. etc.  Because it takes a certain type of intellect to understand and do well in science, people view those who do it well as the end-all authorities on their subjects.  What they, and scientists fail to understand, is that science is still nothing more than a highly developed construct of ideals and philosophies created by man.  Albeit powerful, they are still merely what they are: descriptions and predictions and representations of reality, not reality itself.  When you boil everything down, you'll find that everything starts with assumptions.  To believe these assumptions to be comprehensive and true takes a bit of FAITH, and henceforth comes a main point:  every person cannot be "fully rational" to the tee, because there is always a point where you can only have faith to say something is real.  Man can only manipulate and create images of reality; man cannot create reality itself.  And herein lies a really interesting truth, that we who are made in the image of God can only create images and manipulations.  Anyhow, so there you have it.  Scientists know what they're talking about, but they don't really know what they're talking about.

      Question to myself and to all who come across this page:  Do you honestly care about anything but yourself and your own personal glory/reputation?  Deep down, are you man-centered, or God-centered with the reasons why you do things?  In other words, are you on a constant quest to make yourself look better in front of others and yourself?  Do you even care about God's reputation among others and yourself?

      "At Your Mercy"  I have always known in my mind and emotions, but only have recently learned in my heart that I am totally at His mercy.  I have learned that we are totally at His mercy.  I have learned that reality is totally at God's mercy.  For the past year, after learning wonderful truths in college about "salvation by God's grace alone, through faith" and "sanctification by God's grace alone" God decided to show me that it really is by His grace alone.  He showed me that "no one is righteous, not even one," including myself, especially myself.   My heart being the rocky and thorny soils, I quickly soaked in these ideals, but as soon as trials came because of these ideals, and as soon as the worries of the world crowded in, I withered.  I crumbled, retreating into myself, as if I hadn't heard the liberating news of the Gospel to begin with.  The great things of God didn't get me excited anymore.  I turned to TV, video games, the Internet, etc. to pass the time.  I shunned my responsibilities.  I saw the weak characteristics that I had grown up seeing:  a terribly weak will, hypersensitivity to my emotional and physical feelings and desires.  Now that I think of it, my weak will stems from being hypersenstivity to my emotional and physical feelings, but that is a differen't topic.  Essentially, when left alone with all the time in the world and the means to do whatever I want,  I spent that time doing things that ultimately served myself, for my personal glory.  And that's when I realized the reality of my situation:  it really is Christ, it really is the Holy Spirit that gives me the desire to know God, because when left alone, I turn away from Him to exalt myself.  I am starting to see the truth of inherited sin:  it is ingrained in my very fibers to take care of myself, to love myself, to make much of myself.  God, I really am at Your mercy.  I don't even know the depths of this phrase enough, but this taste has already shown my heart that more than ever.  I previously responded emotionally and passionately with my mind, but now I respond with a note of defeat and surrender.  All of my responsibilities, all the people that are affected by me, all of my surroundings are at Your mercy.  We are all at Your mercy, God, and that frightens me.  I am out of control of the situation of reality, for You alone are in control.  God, I am at Your mercy, and I fear.  I fear that You will let me keep messing up and turning to myself in my sin so that I can glorify You by being punished for my sin, rather than glorify You by praising You in Your Presence.  I am shaken to the core...

      I dreamt of this strip mall type shopping center with an ATM near the sports section.  I was looking for an ATM because I had received a very large sum of money in cash and wanted to deposit it instead of walking around with it.  I came across this girl named ***** Park (not Jamie, or Lee) that I had once met many a year ago, and we started to flirt while looking for the ATM.  We got to the door, but the security guards wouldn't let us in due to closing time.  However, this worker came up from behind us that apparently knew the girl, and let us in.  "Just for you, because you're with that guy,"  the guard stated. "Go straight, make a left, and you'll see an ATM."  Following his directions, I saw two: one on a far wall, and one at the exit.  I sat down at the table near the exit and started to count the money.  When I started to organize the bills, I found myself pulling a lot of other things from my bag and pockets to organize.  Korean bootleg VCDs and Magic the Gathering cards given to me along with the salary I was counting, as well as some books.  I was thinking to myself,  With all this money, I realize I could just spend it.  I should just put it in savings and not be spoiled by the excess .  The girl, the worker that let us in, and other people were standing behind me in front of the exit doors.  For some reason, Patrick Stewart also showed up, as well as the security guard, and some stray cats from a previous plotline from which I dreamshifted.  I dropped something on the floor and bent to pick it up.  When I got up, a large sum of cash was gone, and I realized that someone in the group of people around me took it.  "Who took my money?"  The guard took out a gun, and with a wry smile replied, "You're such an idiot.  You expect us to watch you count all that cash and not do anything about it?"  Panicked, I turned around and saw that everyone had gone outside and was holding the door closed.   I turned around, and sat back down.  The guard aimed the gun pointblank at me, and pulled the trigger.  I found myself thinking,  How could I be so stupid and count all this money in public?  I should have gone home and done it first .  My head hit the table, and in my fading consciousness, I heard Patrick Stewart behind me, exclaiming, "Ok, he's down.  Let's get the rest!"  It was at that moment in which I woke up.  I felt more tired than when I had gone to sleep last night.  What a strange dream/nightmare.

      "Dreaming Up Reality"  I was browsing through my friends' blogs and came across  urlLink an entry  that echoed what I have been going through in my life, and so here are my two cents.  I have, as well, always been a dreamer and idealist of the worst kind.  I guess what I mean by "worst kind" is that I never really had the real discipline and drive to pursue them: I am the epitome of what it means to be to be a lazy dreamer and idealist.  However, there are some dreams that I have still pursue: playing guitar and becoming a good musician.  Regarding the laziness, a lot of it stemmed from dashed hopes as a result of trying to reconcile perceived reality with the imaginary reality I hoped for within my ideals.  These days have become particularly difficult due to this dreamer believing a particularly negative perspective of what reality is:  I kept seeing my limitations, my past failures, and whatnot as the definitive indications of reality.  However, dreams and ideals are what create new realities and see the present ones in a healthier light:  they see growth, change, direction, focus, life in things that "realists" say are indicative of the opposite.  Where these negative "realist" thoughts see failure and frustration, dreams and ideals see opportunity for growth.  After learning those lessons, however, I found a deeper issue at stake:  man-centered vs. God-centered dreams.  What are the chief end of my ideals:  are they to make a great deal out of me, or to make a great deal out of God?  I realized that their chief end were to make a great deal out of me:  garnering praise for the good, innovative, genre-breaking works that I would produce, and becoming celebrated for my talents.  Therefore, I asked God to give me God-centered dreams.  Little did I realize that He would answer my prayers by dashing all my hopes in myself, by showing me how hopeless I really am on my own, and how I could be so lazy, self-centered, and unmotivated.  And even when I did reach some of my dreams and my ideals, I found myself asking, "what next?" repeatedly to myself, and I lost all motivation.  Through "success" and "failure" in these means, I found real failure to be at the end of either road, just as Solomon and so many other wise men have said.  So here I am, a dreamer without dreams, an idealist with no more ideas, an entrepeneur without vision.  I have been devoid and am wondering... what next, God?  How do I generally develop a passion for dreams and ideals that make much of you instead of me?

      "Perspective"  A good friend of mine from college came and hung out with me today.  It was really good to see him; we went out to eat, then bought supplies for the project for that evening: setting up the surround sound speakers.  It was cool, and they went up ok, but later that evening I realized that my left rear speaker wasn't working.  Frustrated, I tried out the other speakers with other wires, and realized that that one port wasn't outputting anything.  I don't know why...  Anyhow, we had good discussions about things, including the all-important necessity of having a good perspective.  I found myself saying the same complaints and frustrations to him as I have to anyone else recently.  Later that evening, we did another recording of one of his songs.  Rather, I did the recording, he did the guitar playing and singing.  I've churned out some preliminary mixdowns, but it will be a work in progress to get things just right.  ****  One of the things that God reminded me today was the reality that I am totally at His mercy.  I cannot rest on the way I feel, the way I live, or on anything else of me for my salvation, for my pursuit of holiness... for my passion to know Him and make Him known.  When left on my own, I am so inclined to gravitate away the Creator towards myself.  It is totally His grace that can ever bring me to love and obey Him.  Found in Christ and won by Christ's finished work on the cross, it is God's strength and will alone that enables me to live life.  I am too flawed, too imperfect, too wrong in every respect to ever have the privilege of knowing Him on my terms... God, I am at your mercy alone.

      "Unbelievable"  “All of North Korea is a gulag,” said one senior U.S. official, noting that as many as 2 million people have died of starvation while Kim has amassed the world’s largest collection of Daffy Duck cartoons.  from  urlLink Death, terror in N.

      "Drinks"  Tropicana Orange Strawberry juice is really good.  As well, a couple of weeks ago, I introduced my friend Grace to St's Alp's Teahouse on 3rd Ave. in NY, and made her try the Taro.  I think after having it three times now, Taro tastes like cookies and cream to me.  Something about that aftertaste... kinda grew on me :-)  ****  "Creativity"  I was sweeping the kitchen right now when the following though occurred to me:  it is astounding how humans are still creative, more so than ever.  It is a testament to the creativity of the One in whose image we are made... think about it.  Billions of men throughout the ages, and look at the world around you.  Every other animal has been around for the same amount of time, but none can ever manipulate and cultivate the environment like us.  None can ever create constructs of thought that are recorded and developed like man can.  Isn't that amazing, the we have a collective human "memory" called history?  Isn't amazing that it can be stored using electrons, things that we can never be able to see?  Isn't it amazing that with all the people there have been, we're still thinking of new, original ideas?  Isn't it amazing?

            I am in this state of mind where I sense that I had been going back on track in life, but have now fallen off track again.  This time around, I'm not beating myself over the head in frustration due to my failure.  I am frustrated because there is so much of my old self that doesn't want to go away.  So, I sit, and ask God to graciously help me to change.  Then, I go do things differently.

        A song that I picked out a lot during my stint at Hope Chapel last year was "What Love Is This?"  I can't believe that it's already been 6 months since I left; moreover, I can't believe I almost forgot about this song as I listen to the " urlLink Holy " CD that I got a couple of days ago.  Moreover, I must admit that this album is probably one of their best ones to date.  Vineyard UK stuff has always been better than the US stuff, theologically and musically, which proves my firm belief that British rock will always be better than your typical American rock  :-D

            I love racing games and fast flight simulators, because they let me go ridiculously fast in cars and planes that I would never be able to drive and pilot in real life.  Ridiculously fast.  Someone should come out with a peripheral for racing games that blows wind past your face in proportion to the speed that you go.  It wouldn't be like real life or anything.  I mean, come on, these sports cars have windshields, and I'm not talkin' 'bout convertibles here.  But man, it would make you feel like you're going as fast as you are seeing on the computer/TV/virtual goggles/LCD screen.  Vroom!

      "Unconditional Joy"  I think one of the most powerful things that I've come across is the biblical concept of joy.  Essentially, the Bible says to find your joy in worshipping God.  I think this is radically different than any worldly philosophy, because in one form or another most pretty much say, find your joy in worshipping yourself, others, or any element of the universe.  Acetic routines point to ourselves as the source of our joy, at the end, because they say, "You will  earn  your joy by living up to this standard."  Humanistic ideals say to find your joy in loving others, which sounds good to some degree, because it comes close to the realization that we only find real joy in praising and loving something outside of us.  However, if you look at the big picture, the Bible says that we are to be for the praise of His glorious grace.  Where the humanistic ideals say to find your joy in loving others, God has made it known to us that the only way we can truly be joyous is to love Him with everything that we are made of.  This concept is distinctly different because the focus of our love is not on fallible, finite beings, it is on an infallible, infinite Being.  He sent His Son as a measure of love instead of wrath, so that we can find our utmost joy in giving all credit to Him.  I've learned this in my mind in the past, and it sounds great.  However, the trouble started when I tried to apply this by looking to myself again, and trying to force myself believe it with my life.  As a result, I have delved into deceiving, self-centered standards that have only resulted in frustration and depression.  On the outside, one might try to say, "Oh, it's because the Gospel is wrong,"  but I realize that it was me that was wrong in the way I immediately misunderstood the Gospel, and looked to myself.  God has been teaching me more and more these days that life isn't under my control.  Proverbs 3:5-6 has become more clear to me:  I can't lean on my understanding of reality to even know and enjoy God, let alone get by in this world.  Loving God is another thing that I receive from Him, from asking, from trusting in Him with all my heart, from acknowledging Him in all my ways.  How liberating it is to find that the God most High is establishing your own love affair with Him; the pressure isn't on you!

      Currently digging the new Delirious live double CD "ACCESS:D", only out in the UK, but thankfully available through  urlLink acorndirect .  Two non-stop hours of the D:boys live.  Also just received the Vineyard UK album "Holy."  New songs in store for church.  God, wake us up.  ****  I'm starting to lose sense of my vision for this site, since it's become just another "blog."  I should have written it a long time ago, but haven't yet written the purpose for this site.  I came up with an idea to do a web journal depicting the experience of a guy with a christian mindset/worldview during freshman year, after seeing my roommate maintain his own online journal.  And this was back in the beginning in 1999, before many normal people had an inkling to do this sort of thing.  Ah, oh well.  What I'm trying to say is, I'm starting to get tired of updating.  I'm looking at this past year, and found that the only thing this site has done is function as a venting station for my frustrations and childish whims for attention, and it's taken a lot of my time that should have been spent studying and doing research, or petitioning God to beat me upside the head to see what I should really pursue in life.  Do I stick with BME?  I find myself more ambivalent about my coursework, about any sort of research, and it scares me... I'd rather love it, or detest it, but ambivalence has driven me to have no motivation to study and do my duty, my "tentmaking."  What else could I possibly go into?  I'm a jack of all trades, but a master of none.  I can learn things, many different things very quickly, but only at an amateur level because of this easily distracted mind.  Ok, and to live up to that claim, I am going to shift my attention to something else:  sleep. :-)

      What do you do when you face all the ramifications of all the mistakes you've made, and the energy required to overcome them seems unattainable, the obstacles insurmountable?  What do you do when every last bit of will is lost?  I don't know why, but those thoughts plague me non-stop.  It's not because I'm pessimistic, masochistic, sadistic, or any other "-istic;" I don't voluntarily sit down and  intentionally  dwell in them.  Strangely, for every dreaming optimism that grips my tiny mind, five more accusing insecurities wrestle for attention.  This pattern is the way I can always remember being characteristic of my personality.  ****   Telling moment :  When I was in fourth grade, I sometimes stayed after school to participate in the arts and crafts activities held in one of the classrooms.  During childhood, I was always adept in this arena.   I especially had a knack for origami above all the other crafts, because I enjoyed the lengthy, precise procedures that produced fantastical paper animals.  So, in this one particular day, the teacher held up a thick, braided square and announced that we were making potholders that day.  We all got up and grabbed a mass of thick hairbands; these were the material we would use to weave the potholders.  She then distributed these square plastic racks with pins sticking up along the perimeter; these objects acted as the looms for the hairbands.  I confidently sat in my seat, forming my plan of action to make the best potholder at the fastest rate than anyone else in the room.  I stretched a hairband from one peg to its adjacent partner, and repeated the process down the face of the loom.  Looking around, I saw that everyone hadn't even finished half of what I had done so far.  This part would then become the real challenge:  weaving the perpendicular rows of hairbands.  Stretch.  Push.  Pull.  Stretch.  Push.  Pull. Stre—   Man!  I stretched too hard, , I thought in my mind as the perpendicular band popped off of its peg.  I had to start over again, because in snapping off, it pulled the band I was weaving, which pulled the bands that were already weaved.  I reformed the row of hairbands, and began to weave again.  Stretch.  Push.  Pull.  Stre—   What? I didn't even do it hard this time.   Fix. Stretch.  Push.  Pull.  Stretch.  Pus—   Again?   By this time, I had already started to grunt and feel the steam coming out of my ears.  Fix. Stretch.  Pu—  Frustrated, I stood up and stared at the loom with frustration... and felt a tear coming down my face.    Ashamed that I had started to cry, I started to get even more angry.  Determined to get it right, I sat down to start again, but I was too angry to do it in a good, controlled fashion.  I looked up and saw that everyone around me had already finished weaving halfway across the loom, and here I was, my fantasy of finishing on top shot.  At this point, all the elements came together to push more tears out.  I couldn't believe I was crying, but I was, and the teacher had noticed by this point... and did the exact thing I didn't want her to do:  she walked over and asked if I was crying, loud enough for everyone in the room to hear.  Embarrassed, the tears became sobs, which me made me even angrier that I, a boy, was crying in front of everyone over something utterly stupid.  I stormed out of the room.

      "Your Love.... it is the Compass of my heart Your Love... it is the Thing that let me start Always... You are the One to touch my heart!"  If any of you knew me during my freshman and sophomore years of college, I was a gung-ho  urlLink Deliriou5?  fan.  They were incredible live, and I saw them as the U2 of christian music.  I.e., they brought the raw passion and melodic rock soundscapes of U2 to praise music... and it totally lit my musically driven heart up.  I saw them live three times, I bought imports, I memorized lyrics and intricacies to every song.  Then I started to hear their newer stuff, and something seemed to be missing from their recordings.  I lost interest, as middle Christian America started to discover their music and turned the whole "modern worship" thing into an industry fad.  I lost interest, as it seemed like the band started to lose focus.  They become more interested in becoming pop-stars in their homeland of the UK, and it just seemed to lose the fire.  By the time I saw them live and attended a Q&A session with them last summer at Creation festival, I had lost all interest.  However, at that Q&A session, it was interesting to see that they started from where I was at the moment:  youth ministry.  Their insights were actually things I was thinking about, and it really did challenge me.  I recently bought their new live album, Access:D, which is only available in the UK at the moment, and I must say that it has started to rekindle my interest.  The passion seems to be back... a bit wiser and not as fully as before, but it's back.  I'm now starting to listen to them with a more mature and focused ear, from both spiritual and musical standpoint;  I'm trying to pick up on how they play live, how to play lead guitar, how to include the crowd, how to take the groove of the moment and focus it on praising Him with every ounce of energy, emotion, and conviction.  ****  God, please bring me back.

      HAHA! I saw this on  urlLink Albert 's site... it cracked me up!!  "On a visit to Boston, I noticed a parking meter with a paper bag over it that said: "Broken." A skeptical traffic officer removed the bag, inserted a quarter in the meter and turned the dial. It worked perfectly.  As the officer began to write a parking ticket, the car's owner rushed out of a nearby building. "What are you doing?" he yelled after a quick glance at the meter. "There's plenty of time left!""

      "Running the Race"  I really lapsed today; I spent more than 3 cumulative hours surfing the net/checking emails/reading blogs.  I've slipped, but God has picked me up and is now urging me on forward.  ****  This morning's time with Him was focused on Micah.  The opening verses:  2Hear, you peoples, all of you;    pay attention, O earth, and all that is in it, and let the Lord GOD be a witness against you,    the Lord from his holy temple.  3For behold, the LORD is coming out of his place,    and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth. 4And the mountains will melt under him,    and the valleys will split open, like wax before the fire,    like waters poured down a steep place.  Do I really see my God in that way?  Do I really have a proper view of Whom He is?  I see the way I lead my life, and I realize again that when left on my own, I do anything to ignore Him.  Things to think about, respond to, and live out...

      I'm just wondering what it must have been like for my mother to get married at around my age.  I wonder what it must have been like for my parents when both of them individually came to know Christ... it happened during their respective sophomore years of college.  To think of the complete transformation of mindset and direction in life that occured from that point... what was it like?  It harkens me to think of my personal experiences through college, and it makes me feel so much more immature than what it seems like my parents were back then.  I did go through some times of major theological revolution and understanding of Christianity, though, and how it affects my life.  It makes me think as well about now, will I experience an even more radical change in life soon, like:  - meeting that person with whom I'll spend the rest of my life, - finding my long-term career path, - or something else just as epochal and life-transforming?  As David said in Psalms, Lord, my life is an open book.  Please take that pen and inscribe Your will and joy and purpose within the blank pages of its future...

      I find that I am a very competitive person, by nature, and I'm not sure why.  I find that my jealousy over others' achievements sometimes pushes me more than a real genuine interest in the subject at hand, be it sports, academics, videogames, blogs, music, etc.  There's nothing wrong with competition, to a degree, but sometimes in my past it consumed me a bit too much.  Why must we be overly competitive?  What is so important about being the "best?"  Ultimately, it is for personal glory; at the root of excessive competition is the need to worship oneself.  Therein lies the sinful root that says, "I am above others, I deserve better, etc."  It is startling how the Gospel will then become a message of foolishness to that mindset, because it says, "Reality revolves around God, not you.  God's worthiness of glory deserves all attention, not you.  You fall short, and you need to fully rely on Someone outside of you to help you."  How can a man-centered mindset, which says, "my self-reliance is the definition of real strength," ever understand when the reality of the Gospel says, "Total Christ-reliance is the definition of real strength?"

One thing I thought was that I tend to write personal experiences on this site when I'm wrestling with dark thoughts and emotions.  Hence, it would give off the impression, by all my posts, that I am a morose, bitter, frustrated individual 24/7.  How wrong an image that image portrays!  It's only 23/7.

       urlLink Leung's death 2nd suicide since June   I don't.. even know how I can respond to this news.  I knew this guy.  I tried to reach out to him when he came in my sophomore year.  He came out to our ministry.  I tried to get to know him as a friend, but I got lost on my own issues as the years went on, and I lost touch.  To find out that someone you knew and for whom you prayed...  It happened a month ago, but to find out now, I don't even know what to say but to express thtat there is a strange hollowness that I am experiencing right now.  I could have been more than the putz i was during my years there and at least built up a real relationship with the guy, instead of being scared of what he'd think of what I believed in, or of generally what he'd think of me.  I could have been more confident about being a real brother, but I didn't.  We all ask these questions, but would they have made a difference?  God, will this make a difference to my cold, hard heart?  ****  TERRY WON AND YOUNG CHOI? DORICE YOO AND GEORGE WANG?  ENGAGED?  WHERE HAVE I BEEN, AND WHAT'S UP WITH AGAPE COUPLES GETTING HITCHED SO EARLY?!  AND FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW DORICE AND GEORGE WERE A COUPLE IN THE FIRST PLACE!

      I am posting a lot tonight, I know.  I just wanted to post this Psalm up, as a reminder to myself mostly. Text formatting added for ease of reading onscreen.  Psalm 111, NIV  Praise the LORD .  I will extol the LORD with all my heart  in the council of the upright and in the assembly.   Great are the works of the LORD ;  they are pondered by all who delight in them.   Glorious and majestic are his deeds,  and his righteousness endures forever.   He has caused his wonders to be remembered;  the LORD is gracious and compassionate.   He provides food for those who fear him;  he remembers his covenant forever.   He has shown his people the power of his works,  giving them the lands of other nations.   The works of his hands are faithful and just;  all his precepts are trustworthy.   They are steadfast for ever and ever,  done in faithfulness and uprightness.   He provided redemption for his people;   he ordained his covenant forever-  holy and awesome is his name.   The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom;  all who follow his precepts have good understanding.  To him belongs eternal praise.

      I don't know why this is, but I just realized that it is very hard for me to take encouragements and believe them.  It probably stems from the same impulse that loves to dish out advice, but not take it.  It may also stem from the depressive side of me that I constantly have to fight from consuming my life.  But the only thing the depressive side hasn't realized is that it's not me fighting, but the Creator of the Universe.  Otherwise, I wouldn't be sitting here typing, I probably would have been gone a long time ago. :-P

      So tired. I am.  I have been given so many things to do, yet my old habits and my easily distracted heart keeps me from being focused.  I really am under grace. Really living under His grace.

      "Putting Things In Perspective"  I've been interacting with more Rutgers students over the past couple of months.  Today, I listened to one student's church's recording.  It was well done considering everything was recorded in a couple of hours.  I have to "secretly" confess that I hadn't really had much respect for some people at the church, because of run-ins in the distant past that left a bad impression on me.  In fact, I have had a pretty arrogant attitude about coming back here to NJ.  A lot of frustration has come out of refusal to admit that I am not doing as good as I thought as I should.  I see it in the general way I explain things to people; I didn't realize it of late but it has always been in a condescending way.  I realize even more that for all things that I arrogantly think I know and have figured out, I am only one person, one tiny perspective.  Just because I think I know something really well, it doesn't mean that it's the only way to do it, or that I'm the only authority on the subject.  This realization is giving me the perspective that I can never really know much... no matter how much I trick myself into believing that I do.  I almost feel like I should quit my music hobby.  I have figured things out in a specific way, but because of my myopic approach to things, I have extremely limited myself from seeing myself in an honest perspective.  I may have technical understanding, but there is no real spark.  Though I try to evoke passion, it doesn't come out naturally.  When people see me play, they say, "Oh, he plays well and has a decent voice,"  but that's it.  I sense it too... it always feels hollow and unnatural when I sing and play.  So, I see myself in a dead end, wanting to quit here because I don't think I can get better.  The only problem with all of this is my man-centered perspective.  At the heart of this is seeing my limitations, my failures, and my desire for personal glory.  My frustration that I can't write a single good song is frustration that I can't do anything that will get people to say, "wow, you are good."  What is it about man's approval that makes it so coveted a thing?  I desire it more than I've ever realized.  I sometimes think that God has kept everything back because of His love for me.  He doesn't want me to become arrogant/self-righteous/idolatrous, which will happen if things go the way that I want.  I guess in that case, He'll always keep everything back for a very long time.  Regardless of what reality is, it is so much more apparent why humility wins over arrogance...  Oh God, who am I to ever think more of myself than what I really am?

      "Elementary Valentines"  When I was in elementary school, it was mandatory to bring in St. Valentine's Day Cards for everyone in the class.  I think starting from the second grade, my mom in her desire to stoke my creative side forced me to make them all on my own.  Oh, the drudgery of cutting out heart after heart from pink or red paper, pasting piece after piece... the horror.  It really stunk that I had to make it for the girls I didn't like and for any guy at all.  Ok, so I was a peevish little brat.  But man, after making 24 cards the night before Valentine's Day, you'd be annoyed as well.  They never even looked as good as the store-bought ones, for starters.  Well, I guess nowadays, I would go that route for girl of interest, but at that age, kids don't care about the effort you put in it.  They always said it looked ugly and they'd rather have Snoopy.  *grumble*

      Happy St. Valentine's Day, everyone.  Hopefully, if you're not single like me, you'll have a good time with your significant other.  As for the rest of us... are any of you eligible sisters in Christ out there interested in going on a date with me?  HAHAHAHA.  Just kidding.  ****  Along the lines of yesterday's post, I have been meditating upon Micah lately.  I found this passage to be really helpful:  "But as for me, I watch in hope for the LORD, I wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me.  Do not gloat over me, my enemy!  Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.  Because I have sinned against him, I will bear the LORD's wrath, until he pleads my case and establishes my right. He will bring me out into the light; I will see his righteousness.  Then my enemy will see it and will be covered with shame, she who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?"  My eyes will see her downfall; even now she will be trampled underfoot like mire in the streets."  — Micah 7:7-10  I've already messed up a lot the past few days, but I will keep striving.

      " urlLink Psalm 1: The Roots of Change "  When trying to change life-patterns, I find two ways to approach it:  with a man-centered mindset, or with a God-centered mindset.  The man-centered mindset views the undertaking with the ideal of strength of self.  If failures happen, it ends up with levels of frustration that correspond to the levels by which this ideal of willpower is held.  Ultimately, at the end of any man-centered undertaking, if successful the effort undertaken points to praising the self.  This praising of self usually leads to arrogance, confidence, and self-righteousness.  It looks down at those that don't have that same measure of strength, and attributes them as having less worth as people.  In this man-centered mindset, the Darwinian reality that "the strongest will survive" holds power.  The God-centered mindset vastly differs because, as the name implies, it appeals to the ideal that God is infinitely strong, and man thereby infinitely weak in comparison.  When failures along the path to change happens, the person doesn't have to be as frustrated, because he or she realizes that their success is not defined by or hinges upon their efforts.  Instead, those who have come to know Christ and have truly embraced the reality prescribed in the Gospel firmly believe that they will be fully made new in Christ, by the Holy Spirit.  This informed faith becomes instrumental in the process of sanctification, the daily, life-long process of change brought by the message of the Gospel.  Therefore, when changes in life patterns do happen after an extended time of discipline and perserverance, the individual can truly say, "It is God who brought me all the way.  All credit goes to Him, for my confidence, motivation, willpower were given to me by Him."  In this case, the individual is humble, truly joyous, and has a real heart of compassion for those around him/herself.  Instead of trusting the efforts and ideals placed in finite man, he has tapped into the ideals and strength found in infinite God, "like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither."  He may or may not experience success defined in the man-centered sense, but he will always experience real success:  knowing/loving God.  ****  I've been experiencing many setbacks the past two days since I shared my newfound determination in life, but this time around, I will believe in the faithfulness of God and keep fighting.

      There needs to be a PC version of Gran Turismo 3.  The only reason I'd get PS2 is to play that game.

      "Adios"  For you Spanish-speaking folk out there, I have a question.  Is the farewell "adios" an abbreviation of "a Dios," so that when you are saying bye, you are saying "to God" to whomever is leaving?  What is the etymology of the word?  Oh, wait.  I looked up the etymology in www.dictionary.com, and indeed, it comes from "to God."  It is synonymous with the french farewell, "adieu,"  and both are derived from the Latin "ad deus."  Isn't it interesting that the farewell for both languages comes from a phrase wishing you to go to God as you leave?

      Reading the liner notes for "Holy" album, I find some interesting things.  The person that wrote them, first of all, seemed to have a fun time typing them up.  The credits for each song are speckled with inside jokes and nicknames.  For example:  "Calum flahdaggahdaggahdaggahdaggahschlak Rees!:  Drums"  or:  "Sam 'the freestyler' Lane: coolfreaky-guitarstuff"  I also noted the heavy involvement with the Soul Survivor camp of musicians and producers in the credits.  If you listen to the bass lines in each of the songs, they are really tightly and masterfully executed... and then you find that they're done by Matt Weeks, who has to be one of the best bassists I've ever heard and seen play.  Listen to his work in Matt Redman's "The Father Song" album, and you will hear crazy offbeat runs that add so much to the beats.  Furthermore, from a spiritual standpoint, they received counsel from Les Moir and Andy Piercy, the producers on numerous Delirious and Matt Redman albums.  Yeah, this has to be one of the best, if not highest quality work put out by Vineyard.  Not perfect by any means —that "New Day" song is pretty cheesy....— but man, there are gems in this cd.  Get it! ;-)

      Eureka!  I found out that Fruityloops doubles as a VST plugin.  Which means, it seamlessly integrates with Cubase, a mixing program for creating music tracks.  Oh... the endless possibilities!  I can do real compositions now!

      "By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return." — Genesis 3:19 ESV  "And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. ...Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ." — Colossians 3:17, 23-24, ESV  "So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God." — 1 Corinthians 10:31, ESV  "In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths." — Proverbs 3:6  People my age —or any other, I suppose— are always wondering what their callings are.  I find that sometimes I create this romantic ideal about how I will find God's calling for my life.  I sometimes expect an almost magical connection to some certain vocation, maybe some "impression of the heart," or something as simple as an enjoyment in what I am doing.  However, I've come to realize that that many of us end up in positions and jobs we don't like.  We get tired of what we do, we don't like what we do, we can't wait till 5 or 6 or even 7 rolls around... only to go to bed three hours later to sleep enough to wake up early enough for work.  These passages reveal a truth deeper and contrary to that naive assumption.  They say that my calling is in the current places in which I work and live.  They say that calling isn't necessary contextual in nature, but simply our God-ward hearts amidst our contexts.  I shouldn't create man-derived imaginations of how He will work; instead, I should embrace the God-derived reality in which He placed me, while keeping my hope in the future.  God, oh God, if I am to live passionately for You, if Christ's peace is to rule in my heart, if I am to fix my eyes above, then let me do it with utmost passion and integrity in my research, my studies, my local church, my music, my friendships, and my home.  I ask this in the name of Christ, made righteous by Him alone, adopted through Him alone.  I ask as Your child... please supply me correct focus and Godly motivation, Father.

      I am fighting as hard as I can to start doing my research.  I've avoided doing it for half an year now.  I've complained to everyone about my problems starting it... from my problems doing it.  God was very gracious in allowing me to survive so far, and He has been pushing me through many people and circumstances to fight my complaining, distracted heart and get focused on what He called me to do in terms of career.  I don't know how I will get there, but I will get there, because God is infinitely more faithful and reliable than my own will or volition.  What I have to do:  - Keep up with studies - Read previous grad student's paper and references - Take out books on biomechanics - Research orthotics design papers, products, methodologies

      Just now, I thought of starting the tracklisting for a new mix.  I'm no DJ, mind you, so it won't be a party mix.  I want to call it the "joy" mix, and fill it with songs that elicit a strong sense of joy from me... the kind that sends chills up my back.  So far:  Deliriou5? - History maker (second half of it), love is the compass, jesus' blood.  (all from the access:d album) Vince Guaraldi Trio - Great Pumpkin Patch Vineyard UK - Awesome God (Your Voice), I Have Been Redeemed, What a Love (Redeemer)

      "Loneliness"  It has become apparent more so and ever that the habits I consider bad and life-stealing stem from a constant state of loneliness.  On the top of the list are reading friends' blogs, writing in my blog, AIM, and watching TV.  As you can see, most of the items on the list entail social contact on the internet.  Watching TV became my escape from having to think and feel... unti I found myself hooked.  During my last semester and the summer after graduation, I found myself spending almost all of my waking hours on the computer to fight the realization that all my friends weren't around anymore.  Four years of seeing or having the ability to see a familiar face conditioned me to expect friends everywhere I went.  Once taken away, it left a gaping hole in the heart, so I turned to AIM and blogging because they maintained this false illusion that I was still connected with people.  But as I did that, it started to blind my eyes to the Truth of the Gospel, to the facts that I was God's child, that I was now for Him, and that I was to passionately pursue knowing Him above all else.  I believed the lies that promised fulfillment in human contact and physical pleasures alone.  I started to notice that these habits kept me from functioning normally towards the end of the summer.  By then I tried to stop... but it was too late, for they were firmly entranced with my life patterns.  And so the cycle of guilt began, and found myself unable to escape from the frustration of seeing these habits steal time away from my studies and responsibilities.  Recently, though, God has been reminding my heart about what I have in Him: victory over my self-pitying loneliness.  He's reminded me that in so many ways that I cannot type here.  And though I still make these mistakes, it is more apparent that He really is in control of reality, not me.  I can never truly know what will happen in the future as the result of what I do now, but I do know that God is not only in control of that, but He is controlling that for my good, for His glory as the Provider for His children.  From this fact alone, I can have real confidence to fight off the frustration caused by my bad habits.  I can also have real peace in the firm knowledge the Creator of the Universe is giving me His attention.

      "For years, experts in the mainstream have been pointing out that the US is causing weapons proliferation by its adventures since others cannot protect themselves except by [weaponsn of mass destruction] or the threat of terror."  I read  urlLink Dee's link to a Noam Chomsky essay about the whole US war-mongering issue , and I'm very interested in seeing these intelligence documents leaked to the public.  The author's arguments are very persuasive, but I'd like to see another side to this before I can say that I will adopt them as my own.  However, I am close to doing it, because like I said, I find them persuasive.  "The chances that they will allow anything approximating real democracy are pretty slight. There's major problems in the way of that - problems that motivated Bush No 1 to oppose the rebellions in 1991 that could have overthrown Saddam Hussein. After all, he could have been overthrown then if the US had not authorised Saddam to crush the rebellions."  Sigh.  During the crazy times of 9/11, I prayed that the leadership of America would somehow practice Godly forgiveness and undertake more loving acts towards the countries in question.  Only by doing so would the opposition would be proved wrong that America was "the devil" and whatnot...  But it didn't that happen that way, and the dissidents against America find more reason to hate us every day.  God, what the heck is going on in this world?  None of us really knows what's going on.  At the end of the day, we just want to have our food, water, families, and lives to maintain, right?

      Why were the Pharisees the way that we see them in the New Testament?  Why are evangelical Christians in America today generally derided and viewed as a bunch of hypocrites?  I believe the answer to the question is the following:  Christianity in America has become tainted with the "serve-me" mentality of this culture —and human nature— and forgotten the message of Christ and the Gospel.  It looks at Christ's miracles and sees them as the reason why He came.  Ministries water down the message of the Gospel to say that it's only there to make you more successful, happier, fitter.  In other words, instead of aligning ourselves to the message of the Gospel, we have started to align the message to us.  Then, because of this false confidence that we "know God" and will "get into heaven", Christians start to have a condescending attitude around those not like them.  Preferences and convictions become absolutes, and if they see people with different preferences and convictions, they point fingers.  They see "the lost" as projects and goals instead of fellow sinners in need of grace.  Oh, God, please, let there be a transformation in the visible church in America.  You are doing great works in many churches in our land... bringing people back to You, in recognizing the difference between absolute and unabsolute, in seeing the reality of sin but the greater reality of Your mercy... in seeing that we are to be ultimately for You, not vice versa.  Bring us back to the point of accountibility called the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that we may be more like Christ instead of trying to make Him more like us.  Open our eyes to see our faults as they are, and to love those we know around us as they are.  Transform us with Your message of grace and point us to You in a way that will not make us self-righteous, but even more humble.

      Last weekend was so great, so packed.  I had the great privilege of playing backup guitar and singing backup vocals for my friend  urlLink Jimmy 's church in Philly.  I got up 7 AM last Friday, after which I did laundry and packed for the trip to Philly.  I caught a 1 PM train... on which a man refused to show his ID to the attendant.  We ended up sitting there for about twenty minutes.  This episode made me think again about something I've been thinking about lately... but this something will wait for a later entry.  Jimmy picked me up, and after chilling at his place for a while, we went to the church.  Funny story:  in the middle of one of the songs, I took a step back the wrong way.  My foot bones shifted oddly and painfully, and so I nearly fell over in the middle of that time of worship... heh. I wonder what would have happened if I did... that would have been hysterical :-)  It was a two night engagement, and I wish I could have been in two places at the same time the following day to have had the privilege to join them a second night.  However, I had already made plans to spend time with Jamie from Remnant.  She's a great sister in Christ with a great sense of humor, and it is sad that she is moving back to Seattle next Saturday.  As a goodbye,  urlLink Pika  had spent quite a bit of time organizing a goodbye dinner for last Saturday;  thank you so much, Pika.  I had also heard about a Da Vinci exhibit at the Met, so I thought it'd be nice to spend one last time with Jamie at her —and one of my— favorite musem.  After brunch at a nearby diner, we spent the whole afternoon there.  The Da Vinci exhibit was interesting, but extremely crowded.  We joined a tour with this guide named James Spann... he was GREAT.  He presented paintings in the manner of a one-man-Broadway show... it was totally unlike any tour I had ever taken.  After tiring our feet out from 4 hours of walking, we decided to get some dessert... but realized that it was almost five.  Of course, she didn't know that the dinner was a surprise from all of us, so we said our "final" goodbyes.  I walked to the restaurant from Times Square, and called  urlLink Andy , whom was about to go guitar shopping.   urlLink Dan  and  urlLink Tina  were with him, so it was a treat to see them as well.  I gave Andy a forty minute shpiel on the world of electric guitars, after which we left for the restaurant.  Pigalle's hosted about 28 of us that evening.  To my enjoyment, I had the opportunity to meet a lot more people that evening.  However, I was extremely tired from the events of the past two days, so I was quite out of it.  After saying my final goodbye to Jamie and temporary farewells to the rest of the bunch, I took the subway to Port Authority.  While waiting for my bus, I find myself waiting behind two students... one that was about 20, the other in her 30s.  I tutored them a bit in basic chemistry and calculus in the bus.  Ji Young slept over that night.  We stayed up watching some TV and talking about all sorts of things.  He's a great guy, I'm so glad that God brought him to our church.  I am so tired from this busy weekend, but I am glad that it is being tired from spending time with so many quality people.

      " urlLink Everybody Hates Us "  I found this article off of  urlLink Pat 's website.  I would have to say that the reason for all of stems from the fact that much of American Christianity has fumbled its grip of the Gospel... it explains on why we become more like Pharisees than Christ.  Instead of intently applying the Gospel to real life situations and personal character, attention focuses on many side issues.  I also wonder about the media's intense negative reaction to media that isn't skeptical of Christ.   urlLink Read this article about Mel Gibson, who is making a new Jesus film .  Personally, I have so much more to go in terms of honestly living my life in the reality of the Gospel.  God, I am so shamed of my sinful tendencies. Oh, let me live a life of freedom and joy...

      "Fractions"  The process of learning the concepts in my current engineering courses reminds of learning fractions in elementary school.  Since it's teaching a new way to think, it requires hours of problem repetition... oh, how droll, mechanical, and uninspiring it can be.  God, please give me the strength to study harder, even if it's like running a marathon in quicksand.

      I'm a broken record.  The metaphor carries a long way.  I need a hand to move the needle past the scratch that's causing this infinite loop of monotony.  My theme song?  Romans 7.  Apostle Paul's words resonate with my experience down to every letter...  Sometimes it's like I'm watching myself go into autopilot, repeatedly flying into the same sinful patterns.  In the face of last week's determination comes this week's opposition: failure, weakness, depression.  God! Steel this heart into action!  Soul, fight with a strength not your own!

      "Part of what appealed to me about U2 was that they were different from almost every other band that was around at the time.  They were not great musicians.  Like many bands of that era, they were inspired by the punk movement, and by the belief that  you did not have to be a virtuoso musician to form a rock band . But unlike many of the punk bands, U2 were not nihilists; they didn’t want to destroy the world. They were optimistic, they were honest, and they were passionate about rock and roll. In many ways they were the perfect blend of the punk bands like the Clash and the great rock stars of the Sixties, like Bob Dylan and John Lennon.  They believed that music mattered, and that through your music, you could touch people’s lives ." — James Henke, Curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame + Museum, remembers first meeting – and writing about – U2, in 1980.  From  urlLink www.u2.com   I still have the latent dream about becoming like these guys... but I have no Larry, Edge, Bono, nor Adam to jam with.  They proved to the world that what matters most in music is passion and how far dreams and ideals reach...  but mine are fading away as I keep studying for my classes, and as "reality" sets in that music doesn't pay the bills.  They fade away as I find that I can't even write a single song.  As I plod away at solving Laplace Transforms, I wonder why I never had the real talent or bold personality to drop all my academics and pursue rock music.  I guess it's the scared, passive side of me.

      "Joe Millionaire"  On the last episode —the only one I actually watched— the lady said something that caught my attention.  She said, "I don't even know what to do with all of that money," after the butler gave them a million dollars.  It made me think of my current financial situation.  I am not rich by any means, but with this current budget, I find myself starting to become like the third servant that buried his money in the famous parable told by Christ.  I don't even know what to do with what I have now, so I find that I'm just letting it sit there in the bank.  It's not much by any means, but I can buy at least one of the items of my wishlist that I always make.  However, I refrain from going on a shopping spree, because I refuse to be a typical, materialistic American.  I'm hoping to somehow invest it in something that will give me more than I put in, so that I can start paying off my school loans.  It's not enough, however, to spend on shares in the stockmarket.  So, I'm right now praying that God will give me the wisdom to do the best thing I can with what I'm given... at least in this way, whatever good comes out of it will be truly attributable to wisdom given by Him.

      I've been in a very Coldplay state of mind, lately.  They sing a lot about hope, especially in the context of the struggles in romances.  My roommate and his girlfriend watched "How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days" on my computer, which is hooked up to the television.  I caught a good part of it as well as I ate a late lunch/early supper.  I have been realizing that though I want to be in a relationship with a girl, but I really don't know what I want.  Is it companionship?  The fulfillment of physical desire?  The need to be loved and respected?  The need to love and respect someone else?  Well, I won't overthink it.  There are the obvious prerequisites of having a strong relationship with God, an unshakeable claim in the Gospel, and a Korean ethnicity, but when it comes to looks and personality, I don't have any expectations anymore.  The fatalistic, self-deprecating side of me says that I won't find anyone for a long time.  Maybe it's right.  The only things I do know are that I'm not ready now, that my time will come along later down the road, and that it is my duty to delight in today's blessings.  God, please build up a genuine passion to rejoice in obedience, and a genuine passion to know what treasures really do lie in knowing You.

      I brimmed with optimism and ideals weeks past, but I'm weak past the point of comprehension.  I have no self-control.  "Control yourself," I say, then the next thing I know it's bedtime and I lost the day.  Condemnation, guilt, frustration, depression hide behind every corner.  I try to corner every turn in life, but I collide into the barriers because I don't know how to drive.  I am more clueless than I ever realized.  Realizing ever so quickly this predicament, my emotions run high.  I look at my aimless wandering over the past week, and I wonder... what the hell am I doing with this life?  Why is it so hard for me to do what I should be doing?  Is God still trying to humble me and show me that all credit will definitely go to Him?  I guess, but that doesn't excuse my laziness, my refusal to study hard to "know my stuff."  I've never had the discipline to perservere at anything for an extended period of time, because I'm so used to things coming quickly to me.  Hence, I am the proverbial jack of all trades, but far from being a master of any.  The minute I face resistance, and difficulty, I switch to an easier gear and never progress.  I am filled with so much anger right now.  Right or wrong of me, but that's the truth.

      "Coldplay & U2"  I've said it in a previous entry, but I believe Coldplay will become the "U2" of this generation.  I believe so because they have the similar optimistic, spiritual, melodic quality to their music.  You have to at least notice that they have a big following amongst Christians.  I believe it is their rejoiceful sound in their thought-provoking work, which ties in very closely to the reason why U2 has such a big following amongst Christians.  Alas, they don't have Christian backgrounds like U2 — urlLink click here to read the interview that shows that they don't — but the depth of their stuff will most likely influence future Christian musicians in the way U2 has done.   urlLink Read this article from a random Christian reviewer; it illustrates my point .  But anyhow, I find that the similar thread between the two groups is the passion to enjoy creating and playing music.  They both want to impact the world with the music they create; they both keep themselves to this ideal and avoid the pitfalls of so many musicians out there.  I believe that concept is what will keep a good group alive.  Not talent or bravado alone, but the passion, ideals, and sense of adventure are the guiding lights to great bands.  And so, I predict that with each solid album release, they'll eventually work themselves up to create their own "Joshua Tree."  I see Coldplay's first two albums, "Parachutes" and "A Rush of Blood to the Head,"  as the equivalents to U2's first two albums, "Boy" and "October."  Keep churnin' 'em out, boys... at this rate, in about 4 years, you'll be playing on LA rooftops and filling up those arenas.

      "still small voice"  One of the most annoying cliches that describe God's voice is "still small voice."  I've heard countless of people say it while growing up and to this day, it has always elicited a negative reaction in my heart.  It just doesn't sound right... it makes me want to scream when I hear it, and I'm not sure why.  Whaddaya mean, small?  Maybe it's because God has never spoken to me with a "still small voice."  He's always been pretty loud and clear and persistent when He speaks to me; it's usually me that tries to downplay what I read consistently in the word and sense when I pray and listen to brothers and sisters.  Maybe it's because it seems to downplay the magnificence, the grandeur of God by saying that He has a small voice.  I recall this conversation I was having with this girl, and she didn't just say "still small voice":  "Yeah Tim, cuz you know, God always speaks with this tiny, quiet, still small voice deep down, right?  It's soooooo hard to hear!"  It made me feel really sick inside.  Is this picture all God is to us?  A nanny that doesn't shout but primarily talks by whispering sweet nothings into our ears, hoping that we'll obey?  I am still not exactly sure what it is that angers me about describing Him talking with "a still small voice."  Where in the Bible does He talk in that fashion?  He may be still and peaceful, but He sure isn't small.  Is He out there to patronize us, or are we living to exalt Him?  Would His voice really be "still small" if God was truly the center of our utmost attentions, passions, and desires?

      "The Tides of War, the Ides of March"  I recall the soothsayer's line from 'Julius Caesar' that warned him of impending doom.  It parallels the ominous cloud that school casts upon me.  I'm not keeping up.  I woke up late and missed the same 11:30 AM class for the second time this week, because I went to bed late in the twilight beforehand.  God is pointing me to the sinful tendencies that hold me pinned to the ground; I am praying for deliverance, perserverance, and strength to claim the predetermined victory.  Not to defeat them as if the outcome is not known, but to claim victory because it will come.  Christ, be my only strength, motivation, and delight.

      "Thank You, Mister Rogers"  I just found out today at the NY Times — urlLink click here for the article — that Mister Rogers died a week ago.  Mister Rogers!  Man.... can't believe it.  I loved his show when I was a kid... something about the way everything he did, he really was fun.  Sentimental feelings aside, I just want to thank God for supplying someone with integrity to influence our country's children.  Hopefully, he's left more of an impact than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, whom Fox have been recently trying to bring back with a new makeover of a cartoon.  Oh brother.

      Unsettling realization:  I am driven by competition.  Competition seems to be the only real way to make me improve; I guess I am the poster child for capitalism.  I realized this trend from seeming my change of lifestyle coming from Hopkins, an ultra-competitive atmosphere, to Rutgers, a more laidback atmosphere.  God, help me.

But, at the same time, it's the only one out there that tells about the Asian American experience in some way.

      This morning, I listened to a sermon from "Future Grace Explained," an mp3 sermon cd I bought, given by John Piper.  One of the standout points to me was that living by faith is living for the future, because faith is future-oriented.  Immediate or long term, all of us are constantly living for the future.  Everything we do such as study, work, etc. is to set conditions for the future, even when we "live for the now."  In this light, it becomes clear that the Gospel, a proof of past grace, is the foundation for all hope in future grace.  Christ's death on the cross happened, among other reasons, in order to buy for us everything that God has to give.  So, our faith in the Gospel points us to have faith in God's promise of life in the future, instead of despairing in light of negative circumstances.  Faith isn't mere intellectual assent to the tenets of Christian doctrine, it sees the real joy and life found in these wonderful truths... it sees them as wonderful, not dry and unaffecting.  There's a lot more to the message, but this part is definitely something that God's been teaching me over the past few weeks.  Holy Spirit, move to connect my heart to the joys found in Christ.  Get me right here, God.

      "Sleep"  It's official:  I can't sleep like I used to.  For the past year, I've been trying to fight my body to survive on less than eight hours of sleep on a regular basis.  During high school and the first couple of years of college, I was able to do it fine.  But come senior year until now, I just can't wake up in less time any more, unless I'm totally charged with adrenaline.   I can't afford to sleep late as often, because no matter how hard I try, no matter how many alarms I set, I just can't get up at the time I want anymore.  Aw man.....

      Last Thursday's entry from my real journal that I keep:  "God takes pleasure in putting our sins behind His back because He takes pleasure in the work of His Son... The question we must ask ourselves is, do we believe this?  Do we believe the testimony of Scripture, or do we believe our guilty feelings?   Only to the extent we believe God has indeed put our sins behind His back will we be motivated and enabled to effectively deal with those sins in our daily lives. "  -  The Gospel for Real Life , by Jerry Bridges, page 64.  I see this concept illustrated repeatedly in Jesus's ministry of healing physical ailments.  He healed/did miracles according to the faith of those that came to Him for help.  His ministry was done in those ways to highlight different aspects of what to do before, during, and after coming to Him with our greatest sickness:  our slavery to sin.  This concept helps elucidate the phrase from Romans, "the righteous live by faith."  Faith does not make people righteous.  On the contrary, the righteous  characteristically  live by faith.  The righteous are those who fully derive their righteousness from Christ alone, and nothing else.  They firmly believe that God has forgiven and freed them from their sin; this level of faith corresponds DIRECTLY to their motivation and determination to fight their sinful tendencies in their daily lives.  God, remind me, teach me more of these truths.   Let not my heart forget .  Holy Spirit, teach me this truth in my life, and in my heart, that I may  live it out .

How will ever make it through this upcoming week?  ****  "A chant of 'My president, my president!' rose from the crowd as the limousine bearing Mr. Kim and his wife, Lee Hee Ho, to their new residence in western Seoul slowly passed through the gates and onto the main street from the palace." -  urlLink Kim Dae Jung Gets Fond Farewell as He Steps Down in Seoul , NY Times  I just thought it was funny that his wife's name is Lee Hee Ho.

      I can't sleep.  ****  Remember Commodore 64?  While all my friends had  Nintendo, I had  Commodore 64.  It was a game machine mostly, but it was still a computer.  It had great games like Winter Games, Bruce Lee, Rambo First Blood Part 2, Double Dragon, etc.  We had 2 disks full of games... loads of them.  But I also liked how it was a computer.  I  loved this painting program and this music program.  At school, teachers used speed reading programs to test how fast we could read... I was always the fastest one :-).  It really was the first versatile and reasonable computer to have, in my opinion.  I wonder what happened to it.  We still have the monitor that we bought with it.

      "Great Expectations 2"  I guess it is at this point that I find how feelings and commitment are related.  Feelings expect commitment, and in some ways, commitment should expect feelings.  While commitment can't base itself on feelings, I think commitment should push you to find your joy in the other person alone, even when things about them try to convince you otherwise (unless it's an abusive relationship).  If you're commited to someone, commit yourself to finding new ways to find your joy in knowing him or her, because the strength of this commitment will render useless any temptation to stray.  I hope that my relationship with my future wife will be marked by this quality, because the direction of the hearts are more important than the current state of things.  I don't know whom you are yet, I don't know if I've met you yet, but wherever, whomever you are, I hope God teaches you similar ideals in this respect... so that our respect for each other will be the real fuel for our romance.  I'll be waiting.

      "Great Expectations 1"  What is the relationship between romantic feelings and commitment when you are in love with someone?  Which is more important?  I've come to learn that when we have romantic and/or erotic feelings for someone, they form an expectation of mutual commitment.  When reality does not meet this expectation, our hearts break in one way or the other.  We enter an extreme emotional state, be it embitterment, rage, disbelief, or obsession, because our hearts cannot take rejection.   This expectation doesn't necessarily have to be shared or in the context of a real romantic relationship; it could be a crush you've had for years.  But make no mistake:  when we fall in love with someone, we expect commitment of some sort.  It is against this backdrop where I pose the following questions.  It is very possible for us humans to have feelings for multiple people, and problems occur depending on the context in which we have these feelings.  So I ask, how do we keep these feelings at bay for multiple people?  How do we handle our feelings when we become attracted to another person whilst in the midst of a serious romantic relationship?  Once we start entertaining these feelings, we start creating expectations for whom we have feelings, but we start breaking the expectation of commitment with the current significant other.  How can we feeble, fickle humans prevent such things from happening?  To be finished.

      Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see.  If you just close your eyes, you can feel the enemy....   Now it looks like this!  And you can swallow or you can spit, You can throw it up, or choke on it... And you can dream, so dream out loud. You know that your time is coming round, So don't let the bastards grind you down.   No, nothing makes sense, nothing seems to fit.  I know you'd hit out if you only knew who to hit. And I'd join the movement If there was one I could believe in.  Yeah, I'd break bread and wine, If there was a church I could receive in.   'Cause I need it now, To take the cup, To fill it up, to drink it slow. I can't let you go.  And I must be an acrobat, To talk like this and act like that.  And you can dream, so dream out loud... And don't let the bastards grind you down.   From "Acrobat" from Achtung Baby, by You know who.   urlLink Click here for the rest of the lyrics .  ****  " urlLink Buy This Album "  Of all the albums they put out, this one had some of the most intense, scathing, and bitter lyrics.  Perfect for bitter breakups and broken hearts, it helps to listen to this album during those moments of relational frustration, during those tumultous times of spiritual yearning.  The lyrics alone personify these sentiments; however, the driving beats and the subtle yet wailing angst-ridden guitars personify restrained chaos and anger.  It definitely matches the trouble that the band had in breaking from their stamped 80s persona.  It was a product of the freshly fallen Berlin wall, their tortured desire and search for change, and a time which nearly tore them apart.  They musically preserved all of the related clamor and turmoil that we encounter in each of our personal times of transition and metamorphosis, and infused it with a deep sense of hope.  Go out and buy this album.  It was made during 1990, but its timeless sound will surprise you.  It has pop tunes, but don't expect bubble gum simulacra of music.  It's music for the soul searchers, for the strugglers, for recently graduated college students like me making the difficult transition to real life.  It helped me come to terms with so many emotions and experiences last year in a healthy, honest way.  It was nowhere near being the answer to my problems, but it sure helped me understand them.  Get it, you won't regret it.

      "I won't heed the battle call It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall" — U2, from the song  Sunday, Bloody Sunday  off of the album "War"  I've posted a new welcome picture.  Again, another picture from the U2 archives.  This picure was taken during the War tour during 1983.  Bono waved the white flag during the song "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" and claim peace to his fighting brethren.  I always found that the flag in this picture waved just in the right position to look like a horse.  In fact, I initially thought it was a horse, but realized it was flag.  Can you believe they were only the ages of about 20, when they wrote that song?

      "Revisiting Kid A"  I'm up late studying control systems stuff.  Usually when I study, I listen to more instrumental, ambient music.  Tonight, I listened to DJ Shadow for a bit, then popped in Radiohead's Kid A because I haven't listened to it in a while.  I had forgotten how complex and dense an atmosphere this album creates.  The mixing on this album is astounding, as well as the musical achievement.  They took elements of 90s electronica and DJ culture and fused it with rock, without making it sound like an obvious hybrid, unlike Linkin Park.  Their musical art is definitely not pop, but it's a reflection and a part of the pop culture of the late 90's.  I guess this has to do with Thom Yorke's involvement with DJ Shadow during the late 90's, as well as their enjoyment of Kraftwerk's music.  I am listening to it now with the ear of a developing recording engineer... I am listening to how every element is panned, processed, introduced, and taken away.  I hear the basic rock elements of vocals, guitars, bass, and drums, but they're used with synthesizers, samplers, and heavy effects processing to make it a big cohesive mix to convey the meanings of the spare lyrics.  I will have to do a lot more practicing... a whole lot more to ever get to this level.  The same goes for equipment... phew.   Thatsa lotta money.

      It's easy to hate Bush and his administration.  I for one don't, because to me it seems like a very bandwagon thing to do.  If you know me, I try not to hop onto bandwagons... I tend to be the outsider first before I make a decision.  In the case with current events, it seems to me that all the anti or pro war people develop their strongly held opinions on so little information.  I for one will not take a stand unless I know as much as the Bush administration does about what's REALLY going on in the world.  After all, they have thousands of spies and military specialists reporting, hopefully without bias, the facts of the situation.  So, I will not hop onto this "anti-war" bandwagon.  Neither will I take the other side.  I don't like war, and I know that it will cost us dearly.  I have friends in the military, and so you can't tell me that I don't understand the ramifications of war.  I've seen enough war films to show me the harrowing problems that soldiers have to face.  But, Saddam and his crew are always acting in shady ways, and as I stated beforehand, there're things that we can't possibly know about the situation.  I respect Bush, because he prayerfully tries to tackle each day.   urlLink Click to read this article , for you fellow followers of Christ that don't like Bush.  At least rest in the fact that he's trying his best and trying to acknowledge God in all his ways.  For those of you who don't know Christ, at least understand that Bush isn't trying to do anything for himself or any religious agenda.  He's trying to seek the wisest way to handle all that he's given, and it's not easy when you have to deal with a country faced with continual threats of terrorist attacks, economic woes, crazy short Korean men running communist regimes that are trying to build nuclear weapons, and obsessed dictators that have histories of killing masses of people.  Please understand that he's the one that has to bear the stress of leading and representing a whole entire country, when we can't handle the stress of our jobs.  Please understand, and pray for our leaders; then criticize all you want.  Thanks.

      It's been about a year since I started to keep this journal on a regular basis.  ****  I am trying to change the way I lead my l life.  Please pray for me.  I want to be more structured and intentional with the way I use my time.  I want to pursue my ideals in a straightforward way, instead of doing things out of my scatterbrained impulses.  I don't think this will make me more righteous, I don't want this because I think my efforts will be a better person.  I want to do this because out of what I already am: united with Christ.  My pleasure will not be measured by my efforts... it will be through my efforts, either they fail or succeed.  This new direction means:  - more purposeful ways to pursue music.  practicing technique for recording, guitar, and voice.  - more reading and studying for the pure joy of learning new skills, instead of the view that it is a duty.  - less time randomly surfing the net.  set specific time of the day to check email, talk to friends online, write blog entry, read blogs.  depend more upon phone conversations and actual real life meetings to satisfy need for socialization.  God, there are so many other things, but set my heart on truly seeking the greater joy in life.  The lifestyle I've led has only brought frustration, bad grades, missed opportunities, and shirked responsibilities.  I asked You to change me; I see that this is the realistic way in which You will.  Do not let the evil one hinder me... give me the daily bread of unbridled motivation and purpose and action that can only come from You and doing Your will.  In Christ's name, so be it.

      As I look through the stats of the people that visit my page, I find it interesting that a large number of people still use Windows 98.  I guess it takes a while for people to upgrade/get a new computer, if they even do that.  I had a praise night at my church last Friday, a lot more informal than before.  Everything went "wrong."  The drummer bailed out by the virtue that he never returned any calls.  The adult congregation had to use our sound system because they needed it more than we did that night. It wasn't a problem that that happened, it was just tiring trying to figuring out the technical details.  I became a vegetable the following Saturday.  The family went out to Chili's for lunch.  Funny to see that we're all growing up.  That night, I stayed up late watching TV.  Right now I find it striking that I am up so late again.  Am I a retard, or what?  Don't answer that question, it's rhetorical.  (Man, now I'm going to get it...)

      Been listening to DJ Shadow as I've been studying these past couple of weeks.  It has hard for me to believe that this is all done by sampling; what did he use, a sequencer?  Was it done on computer?  I wonder how one can do this with just turntables, if that's all he used.  For some reason, at different points throughout "Endtroducing,"  I kept hearing things that reminded me of  urlLink my friend Stan 's mixes.  The kind of chords and music played... new jazz, downtempo hip hop beats, nice vocals, generally stuff I never would have heard on my own, but glad that a DJ dug them up for the rest of us to discover.

      I just read two long opinions from CCFCers  urlLink Roger  and "choemomma," and laughed because they presented their different views in a similar way.  They both started off with disclaimers... however, the second one was a LOT longer.  Why do people hate Bush so much?  I think it's because they hate the image portrayed by the media of him being dim-witted and narrowminded.  However, he's a real person, like you and me.  And complain all you want, but he's established in his position, and he has so many tough issues to tackle.  We complain about all the craziness we deal with in our lives... well, take those issues, and magnify them a millionfold, and you have a sense of Bush LITERALLY having the pressure of the world on his shoulders.  Brothers and sisters in Christ, let's pray for his wisdom in dealing with everything, instead of criticizing and forming ideas that are nowhere near fully informed of the situation.   I'm not a Bush lover or hater, but just from the practical point of view, the best thing we can do is pray for the guy.  He's praying for us, let's return the favor.  Now, as for my opinion on the war, I won't say it.  Ok, good night.

      "The Gospel changes people from the inside out.  Christ gives us a radically new identity, freeing us from both self-righteousness and self-condemnation. He liberates us to accept people we once excluded, and to break the bondage of things (even good things) that once drove us. In particular, the gospel makes us welcoming and respectful toward those who do not share our beliefs."

      "What I Learned In College"  I think one of the most important things i learned in college was an almost post-modern one:  be slow to form my opinions, because I mostly likely don't know the full truth of the situation.  I guess it's an application of that old Greek (or was it Chinese) proverb that those who say they  know  usually  don't .  When you learn more about the world, you realize that there's always another angle from which you can see something.  Yeah. Nothing new here.

They've always held much more ambitious aspirations.  "It was a pretty passionate thing from the beginning," Kessler said. "I don't think any of us would do a musical project without putting some serious effort and consideration into it. It was never like, 'Oh, let's go jam.' It was always about doing something beyond goals of writing songs and playing better. Ultimately, as far as the effort put into the songwriting, it was always very serious and with a specific purpose.""  from MTV News.

      "Thoughts During My Morning Shower"  For some reason, the memory hit me of one of my biggest fears as young child:  loud noises.  The vacuum cleaner's whine induced a deep panic that led me to run to the couch and bury my head under the cushions to drown out the noise.  Rather, I remember when we had our old couches, we had these 1.5' by 1.5' seat mats that went on each individual couch cushion.  They were about an inch thick and had these ornate embroidered patterns of Asian swans and plants.  It was always my proud task to keep them neatly in place on the cushions.  It was under these things which I hid my head.  Furthermore, when my mom took me to the supermarket in Flushing, the loud forklifts similarly drove me to fear.  I nestled my head in my mom's coat to block away the noise, sometimes crying during the ordeal.  I wonder if my mom remembers me doing that.  ****  Thinking about those seat mats made me recall another memory.  Sometimes, when I was five years old, I wanted to play a joke and scare whomever walked into the living room.  I would lay on the couch and place the seat mats on top of me, so that people wouldn't notice I was there.  When they came to sit down, I figured that I would pop out and scare the living daylights out of them.  However, I didn't have the foresight to realize that when people were making the motion to sit down, there wasn't much time for me to get up and out of their way to do my deed.  As a result, on the first try, my mom came into the room and was about to sit down, but I didn't hear her.  Next thing I know, I felt a suffocating weight on my face and I squirmed and pushed out of panic.  I scared my mom all right, but it scared me more than her.  You'd think I would have learned from that, but I figured that I didn't do it right that time, and kept trying again.  No one sat on me again, only because no one happened to come in whenever I hid.  It's funny what memories come up while taking a hot shower first thing in the morning.

      "Mr. Incident"  I dreamt last night that I was at the Oscars at the Roxy in NY, and they were doing a big Broadway spectacular due to the recent success of 'Chicago.'  Incidentally, for some reason I was at the awards show because I had starred in another movie that was going to win an award, and I was to do a song with this one guy.  I walked over to the side entrance hallway, but the door banged noisily, much to the consternation of those running the show and the audience nearby.  Thinking about the impending performance made my heart pump faster, my hands quiver.  I tried to sit down and concentrate, but I couldn't.  The person with whom I was to perform was in the hallway as well.  He was a middle-aged black man with a scraggly beard and white hair.  He was tapping in time to a quiet song coming from his lips, his eyes closed in reverie.  I walked over and sat beside him, closed my eyes, and let his soft, raspy voice sooth the anxiety.

       "In 'Lieu', a Tribute"      This post is dedicated to one of my favorite brothers that I had the pleasure to know during my undergrad years at Hopkins.  Now, I normally don't like to play favorites, but when it's James Lieu, you can't go wrong.  He's a dedicated follower of Christ.  He's one of the nicest guys you can ever meet.  He's humble (relatively), caring, friendly, and dedicated to whatever cause he's involved in.  He has the biggest collection of sneakers that a guy could ever have... a collection that matches if not exceeds the many pairs that most girls have.  He's chill, and always in a good mood.  Darnit, even when he's in a bad mood, he's in a good mood.  How do you do it, man?  Girls, I don't know how you don't go crazy-go-nuts —thanks for the lingo, Strong Bad— over this hottie.  Besides admiring the quality traits thus listed so far, you must hear him sing.  He doesn't just sing, mind you... he grips the mike, he stamps his feet, he clenches his fist, he puts everything into the microphone.  He sings well, very well, and if you were his love, he'll get down on his knees and melt your heart with his buttery vocals.  James, I can't wait to hang out with you and the rest of the JHU crew again in a week and a half.  I can't believe you're graduating, bro; what will JHU do without Lieu?

      I really am a product of God's continual provision, namely because He always reminds me that He's having people pray for me and encourage me.  He's authored my life to this point, and I wonder why I forget that message so quickly, in good or bad times.  God, remind me every day about the message of the Gospel.  ****  Due to the request of a reader, I will post another song from the Vineyard UK "Holy" CD.  I hope this song will convince you to buy this cd.   urlLink Click here to download .

      Another song to download:  "I Have Been Redeemed."   urlLink Click here to download , it is the second link.  God has been ministering to me right now with this song.  It is straightforward, it has no hidden message.  It is what it is.  It is the sweetest, most imporant thing I can I ever sing about.  Oh, God!  Let me live my life, make my decisions, and find my only security in the Gospel.  God, please let me see the deep truths embedded here... I need them now more than ever.

      "Thank you, Lord, for the price you paid.  Now, broken hearts can sing of Your great love.  Friends of God, this is what we have become..."  from the song "What a Love," from the album  Holy  by Vineyard UK.  ****  I have seen the trend in which people start depending too much on the computer to communicate, me included.  I am making the effort to change that:  I try to call people more now, instead of going on the net to chat and read/comment on blogs.  Thanks to free long distance in nights and weekends, it's economically feasible.  I have no excuse.  ****  I have been struggling with habitual sins, such as lust, lack of motivation/laziness, etc.  Not for the sake of being a goody-two-shoes, but because they really are not worth giving into.  Interesting story:  last Friday, my mom dreamed that I was engaging in some pretty bad stuff, and that I was tired and worried.  So she called the next morning, and it's funny that she dreamed about what's been on my heart, when I've never even told her.  Moms seem to have that mental connection.  ****  God,  have mercy.  Let me  truly know  the depth of Your message of the cross.

      Again, the posts are not going up.  Go figure.  ****  Been studying a lot this past weekend.  It's been good, mental connections  have been forming.  I love it when I really start to learn new things, new tools to understand how the world works.  Getting to this point is really difficult for me to do, but once I'm here, it's definitely worth it.  The only problem is getting to this point.  It really takes a lot and most of the time I don't have the discipline to get to this point.  I hope I can consistently stay at this point, so that I can truly learn the subjects I'm studying.

      I've been at Hopkins for two days now.  The moment I pulled into the station, it felt like I never left...  But I've been finding a deeper conviction that while I should keep connections alive, I have been too attached to JHU.  Yet, I can never lose my love for the people led me to know here.  It is just something else, the friendships that He graced me with... thank you, Lord.  I'm finding a renewed sense of purpose in life, through so many meaningful conversations I've been having... Praise God for fellow believers.

      I have to face the facts and fight the feelings:  Face this Fact - God has placed me at school to study and to learn my subjects well Fight these Feelings - When I sit to read or study, this feeling of urgency overtakes me and says, 'I have to do something else'  Face this Fact - I need to read for research Fight these Feelings - When I sit to read, this feeling of urgency overtakes me and says, 'I have to do something else'  God, change can only happen by Your grace through persistent, active resistance against my feelings on my part.  I have to keep fighting actively, not passively trying to understand the incoming barrage.  Work within me and change me, imbibe me with a real love of and desire for You.

      I read 1 Timothy straight through this morning and found it to be a touching, emotional, and passionate letter from Paul to Timothy.  I see a desperation upon Paul's part to transmit passion for Truth in knowledge and application.  Good stuff.  Last night I had the privilege to watch Les Miserables on Broadway, just in time before the production closes May.  It's a given that the play has touching songs and story, so I move on to comment on the production itself.  The incredible amount of detail in each scene blew me away:  the set pieces were well done, the rotating floor kept things moving, and the ad-libbing done by the supporting actors really added to the feel of each scene.  For example, during the scene that introduced Cossette's foster parents, every actor in their tavern carried on audible but unintrusive conversations.  These details gave the scene a lively and bustling ambience.  The person with whom I attended the production noted that I was very quiet.  I had forgotten until hearing observation that I am quiet and pensive when I enjoy watching a movie or play.  I think if something is good and makes me think, it stimulates my thoughts to turn inward, yielding a churning vat of thoughts and observations.  However, it makes me forget to express anything on the outside... funny, eh? :-)

      "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners--of whom I am the worst. But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life. Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen." — 1 Timothy 15-17  Christ must have major patience in dealing with someone like me, then!

      People that blog and read blogs must realize:  a)  What you write is public.  That means anyone connected to the internet in the world can access your site and read it.  Case in point, someone from Brazil left a comment on my site a few months ago.  b)  What people write about themselves and what they're thinking about doesn't necessarily paint a full picture of whom they are.  I'm surprised to find that I meet people who read my blog before meeting me, and they've said, "I feel like I already know you."  This instance has happened to me a couple of times, and I find it interesting that people can conjure up images of whom they think I am by my posts.  It comes with the territory, and it doesn't scare me, but I know it scares some people.  Please be thoughtful of this fact.  c)  Blogging shouldn't be a ploy to get attention; if you need it, leave your room and actually go meet people in real life.  'Nuff said.

      From  urlLink the original Blackhawk Down website :  "It had been the biggest firefight involving American troops since the Vietnam War. Eighteen Americans dead and 73 wounded. More than 500 Somalis dead and at least a thousand injured. All for the capture of Omar Salad and Mohammed Hassan Awale, two men who were as little known after the fight as they had been before it."  Does anything ever change with our country?

      Previously, I put up a quote that Pastor Paul from Emmanuel used in a sermon: "Do you spend most of your time and energy trying to convince people that you love them, that you're a good person? Or, do you spend most of your time and energy loving them, and being good to them?"   This quote hit home, because it touched upon the concept of 'authenticity.'   Why do we spend so much of our energy and efforts in order to maintain an image, instead of being that image ?  For example, undergrads/grads galore cheat on their exams because they want to protray an image that they can get good grades.  But do they know their stuff?  Are they  the real thing ?   It's hitting me how much my life has been more a pursuit of  convincing  people that I'm something, instead of pursuing to  be  that something: a good musician, an erudite individual, a mature brother.  I've spent more time learning tricks of the trade instead of the trade itself, the equations instead of the concepts.  But alas, it's all flash in the pan, and I'm seeing how that's been idolatrous, self-glorifying, and  fake .  I've been tested again and again through so many ways, be it through exams, relationships, etc., and I'm grateful to God for showing me the truth of my situation through them.  Now, I just want to know how God's grace is greater than my failure.  I want to know how His redemption carries through  all  aspects of my reality.  I don't want to stay in this critical, paralyzed state.  I can pummel through this on my own, but it will end up in arrogant self-worship.  I want God to get all the glory for any positive change in me.  I want Christ to be proven right for the work He's done, is doing, and will always do for me.

       So, after the last post, I went back to my books, journalled in my real journal really quickly, then went to class.  After class, a cold rain had developed to my dismay.  I contemplated over what I should do, and decided to brave the conditions on my bike.  Two breaks along the way didn't keep me from getting soaked, but what could I do?  I called my brother when I get home to see what he was doing for dinner.  We went grocery shopping, and I picked up a bike pump because my tire pressure ran low over the course of winter.  I whipped up a salad, while my brother made fried chicken with crouton and bread crumb breading.  Since then I've watched some TV, played guitar, and chatted online, and have written this journal entry.  My books and whatnot are laid out around me, but I still haven't touched them.  What is this mental block that keeps me from starting my work?  Why does there have to be a struggle in the first place?  It's not a matter of subject difficulty, it's a matter of continual motivation.  I started off the semester well, but over the course of time it spiralled out of control again.  I want to do it, but I don't, and this frustrates everyone including myself... until now.   I'm not frustrated anymore, because I've come to see this as my pattern throughout college.  I don't know my stuff as an engineer as well as I should, because I never spent real time studying all of my subjects.  Most of the time, I did work and studied for exams by pulling last minute overnighters.  Only on some occasions, such as Statics and Intro to C++ during my undergrad years, did I take the time to think things through and really focus on the subjects at hand.  These courses were the only ones in which I received A's, though for some others I still didn't as well.  Yet, I found myself intellectually growing and  loving  it whenever I  truly  studied.  I made deep intellectual connections and found myself thinking in new ways; I wish I could have done this for every single course.  But, for some reason, I couldn't, and don't to this day.  I see so much potential with what God has blessed me with, but so many things block me.  To actualize that potential, I need to be more disciplined with my time and with how I lead my life; I can't afford to be impulsive anymore, as if I ever could.  To make the most of what God has blessed me with, I have to set my heart on the important things in life and intentionally arrange my time, actions, and heart to invest in them.  Since I'm caught fooling around with chat and checking my email every ten minutes, I'm a kid playing baseball with a stick when there's a bat lying beside me, a guitarist plucking a rubber band when there's a guitar right in front of me.   I want to take action to change my life, but I don't know what I can practically do to modify my behavior and habits.  I've told my roommates my predicament, but there's only so much they can do.  I've been asking God to change me, to live out my redeemed status with my union in Christ.  This can only come as a gift from Him, but this gift comes in the form of  practical  change... I need freedom from this mental block, from this laziness.  If I already have it, then why am I still in it?  How do I change?

      I've wondered for a long time why I'm too sensitive to how I feel.  This hypersensitivity leads me to come up with ideas very quickly, but I end up becoming unfocused because I try to pursue too many things at one time.  After praying and thinking about it, the only way I can combat this is by slowing my mind down and learning the discipline of patience.  I have to learn how to sit down, think out my visions and ideals, and realize that travelling the road to their actualization takes hope, perserverance, and patience.  For those of you whom are fellow brothers and sisters and Christ, please pray that God may continually train me to slow my mind down, think things through, and pursue things with a deeper sense of vision, determination and patience.  Thanks, that would be much appreciated.

      Thinking about a lot of things that I talked about, listened to, and experienced the past couple of weeks.  I don't have time to flesh anything out right now, but here's the gist.  Two weeks ago, I heard a quote during a sermon by Reverend Paul Kim from Emmanuel, whom was on Rutgers campus to give a message to a Christian gathering.  He said something to the effect of, "Do you spend most of your time and energy trying to convince people that you love them, that you're a good person?  Or, do you spend most of your time and energy loving them, and being good to them?"  I'll post my thoughts later, but there's a line waiting behind me to use this computer.

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY,  urlLink BS !!       This post is a birthday tribute to  urlLink a great brother from my college days .  I lived with him sophomore year; we had some good talks then, and he even helped organize getting me a really nice birthday present back then.  He may have a gruff exterior, but he's one of the most caring brothers you can know.  A dependable, God-loving brother in Christ, with a passion for Korean popstars:  'nuff said.  It is unfathomable to me how the ladies aren't all over him.  Go get him, before he ships off to med school!!!  Much love, grandma.

      Amidst people brightening my birthday with their wishes and whatnot, for which I am immeasurably grateful, I can't escape this cloud of anxiety about the state of our world:  1) The war in Iraq and against terrorism is really a war against an ideal.  How do you fight an ideal?  I read  urlLink this recent article from the  New York Times Magazine   about Sayyid Qutb, a 20th century Muslim philosopher whose tenets formed the extremist Islam roots of the Al Queda terrorist movement.  As I read this article, I felt a pit form in my stomach.  If a Muslim held to these extremist interpretations of the Quran, I could see how he can turn it into a cause worthy of martyrdom.  When you get people at this level, the battles they wage will be fiercer due to their removal of self-consciousness.  American soldiers come from a myriad of backgrounds, so the ideal for which they fight is the "American experiment" of democracy.  The battles will be won by whomever has a greater ownership of their respective ideals... will our soldiers have the same ferocious passion as those under the Al Queda or Hussein regimes?  2) The North Korean problem extends along the same vein as part one.  I've read and heard about how this country has been sneaking propaganda and spies into South Korea for the past decade in order to mold and influence young South Koreans to their cause.  Is it safe to say that the current anti-American sentiment in South Korea has some root in those surreptitious schemes?  This generation is the generation that won't remember the Korean War, that won't remember the sacrifice America made to protect them and their way of life from the invading Chinese and North Korean armies.  If we do end up having to fight North Korea, how will American soldiers fight against the North Korean soldiers... people that have been programmed all their lives to live and die for the idea of their government?  Then again, is the second generalization accurate?  I don't know.  All in all, I have an uneasiness that the ideals with which we're waging war have anti-US sentiments deeply embedded within them.  How can we ever fight and win against ideas?  3)  It scares me that the Qutb philosophy is directly opposed to Judaism and Christianity.  Its train of logic derives from Islamic assumption that the Christian accounts were distorted and wrong, that Muhammad's divine prophecy came to correct them: "A series of Christian religious councils adopted what Qutb thought to be irrational principles on Christianity's behalf -- principles regarding the nature of Jesus, the Eucharist, transubstantiation and other questions, all of which were, in Qutb's view, 'absolutely incomprehensible, inconceivable and incredible.'"  This calls to mind how the Gospel is foolishness to the perishing.  This man's misunderstanding and rejection of Christ and of the Gospel led to his strongly formed opinions about the separation between church and state.  His revulsion to this dichotomy seems to form much of the motivation he had to come up with his ideas.  However, he erroneously perceived that dichotomy to be a central statement of Christianity...  Yet, it does have a function.  How do we who are in Christ, we whom are regenerated, live meaningful lives in this world?  How do we view the core issues to which Qutb so strongly reacted?  The only way we can countermand Qutb's philsophy is to address the deepest roots of his assumptions made for all of his thoughts...  Jesus, for my birthday, please move me closer to Your Truth, that I may live fully motivated by the freedom from sin, a freedom found in my unity with You...

      "Spring Break"  This break was the best break I've ever had.  I saw Les Mis (and saw it with a cool person, to boot), saw old friends, and had many meaningful, thought-provoking conversations.  It was bliss to go to a place where everybody knew my name and where I didn't have to do anything to establish a deep connection.  I met many great new people as well and am excited to develop our friendships in the future.  The only bummer was that in my aging state, I can't function as well with so little sleep.  I kept falling asleep during conversations in car rides yesterday and during Pastor Iggi's sermon this morning.  Argghh!  I'm getting old!  All in all, this trip was the best birthday present I had received from God.  It refreshed me and renewed my hope and motivation to work harder at my studies.  Thanks to all who gave me their rebukes and encouragements, for the birthday wishes, for the love.  One love.

      Why were the lost were so drawn to the Son of God, the "religious" so offended by Him?  Obvoius answer:  The ones that had no problem seeing that they were messed up saw that Christ had something to offer.  Those who didn't see what was messed up about themselves had no need for Christ.  I fit in the second category.  In a weird way, I intellectually believed that I was in the first classification, and therefore found righteousness in that.  With that, I placed myself in the second, "religious" group.  Confusing?  I am a confused person.  I need Him now more than ever; I see how lost I really am.

      "Who am I to call this suffering?  I don't even do anything at all, and this is suffering?  I am simply lazy."  These thoughts come during and after I live each day.  How can I change?  Will I ever live a life that's good enough to silence these accusations?  Change is an undergoing process.  I will never live a life good enough to silence unrealistic standards.  Sigh, this journey seems to grow more difficult with every setback.  Some progress has been made, but sometimes I wonder if they ever makeup for all of the setbacks.  Must keep moving...

      At moments I think the issues clear up, and I think that I can continue to do work.  At extended periods of time, they do clear up, and I think I'm perfectly fine.  Then these times come again.  The times that start with the nagging thoughts that I'm not keeping up with my schoolwork, that I'm mishandling my time, that I'm not doing anything right.  It is true: at many times, I am lazy, and there is a whole lot of personal responsibility for my sin that's involved here.  But in my weakness, I don't truly repent and let God's grace motivate me to change healthily.  The nagging thoughts burgeon into condemning voices, saying that everything that I do with my time is a form of laziness.  Condemning voices lead to dark times of depression, times in which I can't bring myself to enjoy anything.   The voices are not literal or audible, so no, I'm not hearing things.  Simply, these are fears and thoughts of condemnation that crowd my mind to the point where I can't even function as a student.  I remind myself that these thoughts are not the authority, that Christ is the authority, that I am freed from sin, that God, out of His grace, is working to perfect me.  I remind myself of God's love.  These reminders fall to deaf ears, and any sense of will seems to weaken as I see myself starting to avoid the necessary work altogether.  It comes to the point where the thoughts in my mind roar to a fever pitch, and I'm rendered helpless.  During college, I had a great accountability system that kept me in check and forced me to keep going.  Now that I'm more on my own, this problem has escalated, and I realize that  this problem is real  and that  it has never gone away  with all these methods that people have told me to try, methods that I have told myself to do.  "Just do it" doesn't work.  "Exercise my will" doesn't seem to work.  "Remind yourself of the Gospel" doesn't work, at least when I'm on my own.  I've steeled my mind, I've written out schedules, but it seems that I've never tried hard enough.  I still avoid doing school work, and I don't follow my schedule.  All this feeds the condemnation machine that highlights that I'm trying too hard on my own and overthinking the issue.  I'm now at the point where I'm recognizing that even if I had accountability to help me get through it in the past, I never fully fixed the problem.  I addressed and dismissed the symptoms because I was able to weather through them, but the fact that this pattern of events keeps returning shows that I need help.  After much prayer, I'm finding that it's best if I seek professional accountability to help recognize and address the root(s) of the issues.  I need to know what's really going on here, and how to address the problem so that if and when this happens again, I can fight this cycle with more effective means, fully guided by the hope won for me by Christ.  I've avoided sinking into depression this time around, thanks to the prayers of trustworthy brothers and sisters in Christ, and ultimately because God in His grace has continually reminded me of His promises for my good held out for me in the Gospel.

      After much prayer and thought, I am now looking into finding professional help.  I can't do this alone.  All the advice people give me these days has been the same advice I've heard, told myself, and tried for the past four years, but I'm still at the same place.  It seems like the best next step into real life change.

      Reality hit me this past year with:  1) Emotions are real and not to be taken lightly.  Think I am in control?  Think I have mastery over what I do?  Think again.  2) I'm not strong.  3) Arrogance is the product of making ridiculously short-sighted assessments of oneself.  4) Same goes for depression at times.  Well, initially, before it spirals out of control.  5) Preaching the Gospel to the self daily and  believing  it is harder than any other task in this world.  53 weeks left in my personal new year.  God, in Christ's name, please free me and strengthen me to do what You want me to do, despite my weakness and failure.

      I've gone through this before in my past.  This time around, I don't want to try to face this alone again.  I've told people that I trust will pray for me; not to depend on others too much, but simply as a measure of accountability.  After the last post, I had gone to ask for prayer from another person.  After that was over, I turned off my computer and decided to go to bed, when it happened again.  I reeled to the floor, clutching my head, the thoughts a lightning storm in my mind, paralyzing me.  I fought as hard as I could, and it started to aabte.  I am now at a normal level, but there's still the storm closeby.  I can feel it, but it's suppressed right now.  The last time this happened was during my junior year, in February.  It happened after the time I switched churches, and contemplated going to my new church's retreat.  What triggers these atacks?  I think it starts off with a bunch of fears that escalate into something i can't even categorize.  Is this schizophrenia?

      For those of you what I'm going through, I am sad to say that it's not getting any better.  Ever since I got back from break, I go to my classes, but I find myself distanced further and further from my studies.  Studies?  What are studies?  I really try to sit here and do it, but it just doesn't happen.  My mind crackles with crowded thoughts and i almost physically feel a vice over my head.  Or, I feel the lazy bug... that state of emotion that consists of this cloudy sensation that keeps repeating, "Don't do it."  I think to myself, "Christians shouldn't fail like this.  They shouldn't be weak like this, because they have the ultimate confidence in life, their union with Christ.  They fight to the extent of how firmly they believe."  Then I see that I'm losing more battles.  I have received so much exhortation and encouragement consisting of cures and actions I should take, but here I am, unable/unwilling to take action.  What the heck is wrong with me?  Why can't I act?  Why don't I act?  I'm not even trying to figure out what is keeping me back, I just try to do it... but the same outcome.  Nothing seems to work.

      I get more reminders each day about how myopic and one-track minded I am.  At times I lose control of the volume of my voice, my emotions, and my actoins when I try to express what's on my mind.  It's humbling when someone has to tell me, "Hey, quiet down, we're in a public place."  I've heard that line all of my life, and every time I vow that I'll be more careful with my thoughts.  Then, I hear it again.  This is what I am.  But what can I do to compensate?

      I've been thinking about a lot of things recently, but the following is the process for one of them.  I will elaborate on it later.  1)  My parents, and other Korean immigrants from their generation, have voiced their disgust over the anti-American sentiments of young people in Korea these days.  They view it as hypocritical and bratty, because the young people didn't grow up in the country during and after the Korean War.  To the older generation, the younger people are hypocritical because of their desire to speak English well, to the point of cutting the webbing under their tongues to magically eliminate Korean accents.  They view this generation as bratty, because all these protests and opinions are biting the hands that fed them and created their free world for them in the first place.  2)  These sentiments made me think about us, the first American-born generation of Koreans. Well, besides Hawaii, but they're a whole different world anyhow :-).  It's been hitting me harder that I'm approaching the age of my parents when they were first thinking about emigrating to the United States.  Did issues about cultural transmission ever run through their minds?  What about us, and our kids, and our grandkids, and so on?  Will we lose our sense of cultural identity?  If you went to a different country, and raised your kids there, they will undoubtably find their identity with that country, not with YOUR country.  What would that feel like?  Would it hurt?  Would you feel pain because they don't want to identify everything that you are?  3)  I think of Korean American Christians in my age group.  I see the trends for ministries for this age group to always end up splitting from their immigrant parents' churches.  I see the trends toward 'multi-ethnic churches' as ideal because they grew up in a multi-ethnic environment, and view going to a Korean demographic ministry as narrow-minded.  I ask: what about the future?  What about your kids, about their kids?  What will they think of their Korean roots?  Summary:  this is all the background for a future post.  Just trying to organize my thoughts here. :-)

      "Love"  People say that you can't define love, but I say bunk.  You can. Love is making the good and/or the ideal of something, or someone your personal good and ideal.  In the context of relationships, things go wrong when we confuse how a person makes us feel so good with being true love.  If we simply stop there, though, it's not love of the person, it's the love of self.   This is false love .  In these sort of situations, we love how the person betters our emotional and physical states,  at the expense of the other person .  Thus, we haven't made the good or ideal of someone else our own: we are still soley focused on our personal good and ideal.  Things go right when we feel so good about acting for the sake of the other's good and ideal.  We love the feeling that we get when we serve the object of love.  We do whatever we can for its good and ideal.  For example, let's say a man saw that a woman had a problem.  If he truly loved her, he would be totally concerned with her good and ideal.  If she got better, he would find true joy in her good being met.  Another example is how God loves it when we find our utmost pleasure and sustenance in obeying him.  When "the food we eat is to do the will of the Father," we have reached our utmost capacity to glorify God.  The common elements between false love and good love are that we feel good, and we love feeling good.   There is nothing wrong and everything right with feeling good .  However, what matters is  the focus and means by which we seek to feel good .  Selfish love is more focused on the good of the self, while true love is focused on the good of the other.  Do you love the feeling of someone  making a big deal out of you , more than you love the feeling of seeing  the good and ideal of the person being met ?

      " Don't judge your insides by other peoples' outsides. "  I attended the final lecture for my Intro to College Teaching course, and left with a new perspective on my problems.  Right now, I'm trying to recollect my thoughts.  Knowing what I should do with my life, or at least having a strong desire and goal in life is so fundamentally important, and I find that a lot of my problems come from confusion and murkiness in that department.  God, why am I so lost?

      I would like to invent a machine that reinvents me  with the push of a button.    To reinvent myself in an instant instead of fighting yet seeing the same issues every day, To reinvent myself in an instant to rid myself of bad habits and personal demons that enslave me, To reinvent myself in an instant,  would be bliss.    I would like to market a machine that reinvents me  with the push of a button.    If I promise humanity with my newfound discovery, If I advertise the ability to heal psychological conundrums, If I woo companies and begin manufacture,  I could get rich.    I would like to get rich off of a machine that reinvents me  with the push of a button.    Millions of lives changed in an instant for the better, Progressive industrialism is the answer to all our problems, I present the microwave oven of psychotherapy,  The drug of the ages.

      What thing in my life shows that I am saved?  Is it my love for my brothers and sisters in the church?  Is it my love for any person that I encounter in life?  Is it my understanding of proper doctrine?  Is it the sum of my spiritual gifts?  Is it my service in the church?  Is it my struggle with sin?  Is it my prayer life?  Is it my faith?  My faith floats.  My faith melts away.  My faith is like snow in Kenya.  My faith comes in words that float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.  But, butterflies live shortly, and bees perish with the parting of their stings.  I eat, I drink, I ask for prayer, I do everything to stay alive.  But do I do anything for the glory of God?  Nothing in me exists of which I can consider with pride and say, "This element of me warrants salvation, warrants peace, warrants my life."  Christ, where are you?  Make me into a dead man walking.  Bring this dead man to life.  Bring me to life, my Lord.  Jesus, raise my dead soul to life.

      Shaking.  I read a post that made me shake because of its stark honesty.  It made me shake because it's something that the person wouldn't ever tell me in real life.  Needless to say, this episode reminds me of what my friend Jimmy always told me: "Xanga —or blogging, in general— is the ultimate truth serum."  God, we are depraved, every one of us.  I have never felt so lost as I do now.

      "Hold fast to dreams, For if dreams die, Life is a broken-winged bird, That cannot fly.  Hold fast to dreams For when dreams go Life is a barren field Frozen with snow."  — Langston Hughes  I got this poem from my friend's site.  It can be easily romanticized and evoke an "awww" from a mushy gushy person.  I guess that means I'm not mushy gushy; call me cynical, questioning, etc.  I agree with him with the idea that vision, dreams, and purposes in life are the things that drive us, and without them life becomes lifeless, a flame without heat.  But what if the dreams are too far?  What if they're too lost in themselves?  What if the harsh realities set in that we still need to eat, and take care of our kids, and pay the biils?  What if our firm grasps onto these dreams start taking their tolls on everything around us?  Will we then become like the prodigal son that "comes to his senses?"  What is the real sense to follow?  What is the best common sense?  Questions.  I have questions, Langston.

           I went to the free  urlLink Shane Barnard/Shane Everett  concert tonight at College Ave.  Two different opening acts also filled the night.  They were all pretty good, passionate, intense about what they were doing: worshipping God and divulging their ministerial intent.  The whole night lit my mind abuzz with everything I've been mulling in my head the past few weeks.  Seeing the talent there made me question the amount or lack of talent that I possess.  What do I have to offer?  What could I possibly do, if I can't even write a song, if I can't even assemble a cohesive work of art?  I racked my brain as Shane and Shane wailed out their harmonious odes to God.  I racked my brain for the truth of my situation, thinking  "God, oh my God, oh, my God, what am I doing?"  ****  "There are two colours in my head.  What was that you tried to say?" -  Everything In Its Right Place , Kid A album, Radiohead  I have been telling everyone that I'm thinking about ending my run for a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering and ruminating about entering the music industry.  "Maybe I'll go into audio engineering or production," I say.       God, I wish I wasn't so messed up.  I wish there would be one colour, one flavor, one direction in my head instead of the chaotic jumble.  I wish I could truly see the reality of the Gospel of God's love  and live a truly changed life .  Then I look into the mirror and see someone that is utterly lost.  "God loves you," I hear.  What was that you tried to say?

      "I Promise..."  A lesson that God's taught me too often is, "Don't make promises that you don't have a real heart to keep."  It only ends up in making you flaky, your word less credible, and hurting/causing inconvenience to the person with whom you made a promise.  My goodness, how inconsiderate.  God, have mercy on me, on all of us.

           It's been a good while since I've substantially stated anything.  I've been researching how to find the best career that fits me, my passion in life.  I read a buttload about how to write effective resumes and cover letters, and what's important in interviews.  I read and am reading books on how to glorify God through my passions and life.  I paid for  urlLink emode  and took about ten different tests on personality, talents, IQ, EQ, etc.  I tried to take the ones that were serious, not those cheesy "You are a ROCK STAR!" tests.  I took so many tests in order to confirm in what areas I'm particularly strong, and what jobs would fit a person with my profile.  For example, here's one statement that hit me on the button:  "Timothy, your Right Job will allow you to be Creative.  From that, we can tell your inventive personality is in tune with your emotions. You have a rich imagination that needs room to flourish in the workplace so it can be appreciated by colleagues, coworkers and clients."  That's exactly why I've been suffering in biomedical research.  It calls for creativity, but my sort of engineering creativity is more artistic than medical in nature.  Overall, I've noticed some similar themes throughout all the advice, and found that the advice to find a fitting career equates the advice to find the right spouse, right college, etc.  In my mind, I've boiled all of the advice down to:  1) Comprehend yourself  honestly , to the extent of what you've become and learned up to this point in life.  Find where you want to go, and how you would be able to get there.  I stress "honestly" because it's key that you have an honest view of what is, not what should be our could have been.  2) Understand how these traits may benefit the party at hand, be it the school, potential significant other, or workplace.  3) Learn how to clearly communicate that knowledge in written and spoken form.  4) Live with an active and teachable heart that is grounded in the essential Truth of the Gospel.  Ha!  It spells CULL.  Interesting, since I "CULL"ed those points out of all the information.  ...and I'm lame. I know.

      You haven't seen updates in a while because Blogger hasn't been too cooperative in uploading my posts.  Oh well.  Anyhow, last weekend I went to the NY Auto Show with church friends, ate dinner at this Mexican Joint called "Mi Nidito's," and went to see "Better Luck Tomorrow."  NY Auto Show - I am now convinced about how much of a waste it is to spend more than $35 K on a car.  It's so ridiculously not worth it.  For example, I sat in an Mercedes Kompressor and found it nice, but not worth $118 K to ride in.  Mi Niditito's - Pretty good Mexican place at 8th Ave. between 51st and 52nd Streets, considering it's owned by Indians (it has a sister Indian restaurant).  I was really peeved because there were more people there than I had planned, and the seating was such that it was uncomfortable for some of the people that didn't know each other.  I wanted to rearrange everyone, but didn't have the sense or boldness to get everyone to move around.  But, things turned out to be pretty ok for most that were there, and the food was pretty good.  Better Luck Tomorrow - It was made very well.  The film quality/cinematography, the pacing of the plot and humor, and the general direction were very professional.  Furthermore, it's pretty successful in avoiding Asian stereotypes by presenting the life of its Asian Americans without making a deal about their ethnicities.  It definitely is not a waste of money if you go to see it.  However, there were problematic plot points (how could anyone suddenly give up cocaine if they wanted to?), and I didn't like the nihilistic themes.  Ok.  Back to finding a life now.

      The only real dream I would say I've seen in my mind has been of me on a stage leading a vibrant stadium of people through some sort of energized song.  I would have this technical monstrosity of a setup that melded sound and light to present an intricate piece of art, but not in a way that echoes this media saturated society.  It would still be totally transparent and convey the art without distraction, without involving vegetating brains.  I don't care if they want to see me, I just want to lead everyone into a great time, singing along, vibin', jumping, letting go and gettin' down.  That would be great.  The drums come in.  A kick that you can feel in your stomach, a crackling snare, and a shimmering hi-hat.  The crowds in the right stomp their feet to the time of the kick.  The crowds in the middle clap the snare.  The crowds in the left snap their fingers like the hi-hat.  The whole stadium has become the drumset.  The guitar chimes out an arpeggio, sounding like a brass xylophone in clarity and timbre.  Bullets of sound ricochet from the ceiling, and heads turn to the sound.  The crowd sings the song, and I have the best seat in the house.  I don't even have to sing, for I've dived into an ocean of sound.  The audience members are the performers and I am the facilitator, but only God sits to enjoy as the recipient of the praise.  If that was all I had to do for a living, what more could I want?

      Has it already been a year?   urlLink Has it already been a year from studying for my last final ?  Has it already been a year since I finished college with ambitions that I'll be at the top of the game by this point in time?  However, here I am, dropping out of grad school.  Here I am, harboring a greater confusion about my role in life than I've ever had before.  How did I get here?  My visual enslavement to the CRT, the mental handcuffs to the Internet have brought my towering amibitions to my knees.  Any sense of ambition has left, and I am shot through with insecurity.  When I look in the mirror, I should see a confident child of God, but the visage of a lazy butterfly stares back at me and flits away in whimsy.  Where did ambition go?  Where did focus go?  I come to the humiliating conclusion: they never existed.

I had listened to them a little back in the day, but not too seriously, considering the only song I recognized was "Scenario."  Man, these guys were good.

      I grew up paralyzed by a fear of people and constantly defined myself by their evaluations of me.  My family moved every 2 years up until the fifth grade, from which I lived in Pennsylvania until two weeks before my senior year of high school.  We moved back to NJ into the house where my folks currently reside.  People may call me spineless, and they may call me the typical middle child.  But I was this way even before my younger brother entered the world, and I subsequently never felt like I had attention taken away from me.  I had always derived my pleasure on the smiles of other people.  I was the perpetual entertainer, the kid that loved to dance and make silly faces in the need to see people smile.  When I had moved to Pennsylvania, I instantly found myself shunned and despised.  Some of the older kids in my church made it their point to rally all the others to shun my brothers and I.  I took it pretty hard every week when the leader of the pack would lead all the others to run away when I tried to join them in their games.  From that point on, my personality became extremely insecure.  Overcompensating acts to fill my need to be liked had always backfired, and I started to breed a strange arrogance, an odd elitist view of myself.  I began to listen to music.  As time went on, I found myself adopting the stereotypical "indie rock music fan" mold in which I would shun the shallow, crappy, mainstream music for the common folk and embrace the real music for the intelligent mind: independent christian rock.  I searched high and low and found bands like Dakota Motor Company, Poor Old Lu and Sixpence None the Richer, bands of the ilk that none had ever heard.  I still had conceded, though, and listened to the good mainstream music out there:  The Fugees, Oasis, The Goo Goo Dolls, REM, PM Dawn.  At least, I began to listen to the things that I felt had the edge of artistry that crappy pop like the Spice Girls didn't have.  Over time and up until this day, I found that my hunger for good music has only grown, sometimes to the level in which I would lose countless hours of sleep listening to and making it.  Yet, here I am, unable to find my purpose, only seeing how far my insecurity controls my actions and inactions.  I grew up paralyzed by fear, and I'm still paralyzed.  God's been gracious in bringing me to this point despite myself, but now I must find my new springboard.   I am now in the position to find my true destiny, the career for which I've been made.  God, eradicate trust/distrust in myself.  Eradicate fear of man.  Eradicate trepidation and replace it with boldness, with confidence, with vision, with direction from Christ.

      I went on a personal retreat from Tuesday morning to Thursday afternoon, to explain my absence.  The retreat contained absolute silence; humorously obese and tame squirrels; convicting readings of others' testimonies and God's word; an enormous amount of sleep.  I realized that the satisfaction that I find in AIM conversations, online journal entries that touch people, and cool music overshadows, by a long shot, of the satisfaction I find in God.  I also realized how little faith I have in God to work miracles, how little faith I have in God's absolute, masterful control over existence itself.  He controls the property of matter, gravity, and time.  He authors history.  He is absolutely in control, yet I don't live a life that shows true belief in that truth.  Today, the reality of my falling out from graduate school hit me.  What am I doing with myself? Why did I have to be so weak and fall out this semester, this year?  Why did I have to become a basket case?  God, oh God, why have I always been so lost with pursuing Your purpose in my life?  Why did I have to give in to laziness?  God, my life is in Your hands, but I just don't want to become a missionary in some remote part of the world.

      "Please forgive me... every time I look at you" —  Please Forgive Me , from "White Ladder" by David Gray  It is a sad thing to see that I am motivated more by jealousy than by joy, that I am dependent on people to make it through the day, that I am influenced by people around me more than I have an influence on myself.  It is sad to see that jealousy pushes me more than cooperation, that I am dependent on music to make it through the day, that I am influenced by media more than I have an influence on myself.  It is heartbreaking to see myself in defeat, because I don't even know what defeated me, because I don't know how I have become a basketcase.  Can I forgive myself to the point that all life-crippling angst and frustation has disappeared?  Will I believe in Christ's forgiveness to the point in which I am filled alone with hope and joy?

      Before I write anything, I want to wish Paul Han a very Happy Birthday.  He is such a blessing brother to know; if you want someone with quality character, ask for Paul Han.  "Did you lose yourself somewhere out there, Did you get to be a star And don't it make you sad to know that life is more than who we are"  Man, I was such a kid of the 90s.  The Goo Goo Dolls, Oasis, the Gin Blossoms... there was this explosion of alt-rock in the mid-90s that made me realize how much I loved music.  One of my favorite CDs was "A Boy Named Goo," by the Goo Goo Dolls.  I specifically liked three songs:  Flat Top, Long Way Down,  and  Name .  It hooked me back then, and after listening to them for the first time in eight years, they've hooked me again.  Here I am, a washout with all motivation and purpose sucked out of me.  People know me to be intense, but even the brightest light bulbs burn out.  Man, I know  urlLink Romans 7  well, but  urlLink Romans 8 ?

      I still haven't gotten my resume together.  I spent most of my time this week cleaning my little brother's room —yes, it's THAT messy— in order to set up a computer network from my mom and brother.  I have been unable to apply to jobs yet, though I set out to do that a month ago.  Man, this soul-searching stuff is hard.  I have gotten leads from some past references to possible places to apply, but nothing yet.  All you readers out there, take note: if you know anyone in the greater New York metro area looking for someone to work for them, please let me know.  I would mucho appreciate it.  Man, I need a haircut.  I've been unintentionally growing it out because I haven't really had a chance to go to a barber yet.

      "If the whole [human] race instinctively understands anything, it is suffering, sin, and love; and these three spell out plainly all the message of the cross...  The appeal is felt at each stage of life.  In youth suffering numbs; in manhood it can embitter; in age it may despair.  In youth sin frightens; in manhood it enslaves; in age it takes revenge.  In youth the want of love confuses; in manhood it makes cynical; in age it crushes utterly.  But youth, manhood, age find answer in the message of the cross.  Suffering, sin and love is the ABC of the world's long story, the theme of all great literature, subject of all great painting, key to all great music.  This is the real eternal triangle, and at its apex stands the cross of Jesus.  For there He suffered as none has ever suffered, to show the suffering of God for a world astray; He bore sin as none other ever could, to bring men back to God; He loved as none has ever loved, to show the love of God."  — Reginald White, from "Beneath the Cross of Jesus"

      "but those old obsessive tendencies don't want to leave" - last entry  If you fast and don't replace the reclaimed time and energy with an ardent pursuit of God, the fast will be in vain and a mere exercise in humanistic ascetism.  Case in point, I haven't spent the free time that I've had entrenched and focused in delighting in God's Word or prayer, but in fixing my mom's computer, reading Rudyard Kipling's "The Jungle Book," reading plot summaries of the old childhood favorite Sega RPG series Phantasy Star, and cleaning my parents' house.  ****  Oh, and about this career/job search? Phht. Nada so far, but I must keep looking.  I've calculated that with my remainder checks for the school year and my current bank reserve, thanks to God's grace I'll have enough funding to support my fixed living costs of food, utilities, and rent until the end of August, with roughly $1000 left over.  What will I do with that $1000?  It may seem like a lot, but that's about $250 a month for transportation, living supplies, missions support, etc.  I have no idea exactly how I should handle it, and so I'm praying for God to give me wisdom in handling it.  I'm thinking about making a new website that will be geared towards my job search.  We'll see what pans out.  Things I must do over the next couple of days, weeks, and months:  Follow up on and research job opening leads Rewrite Resume Possibly make website for resume, self-promotion, etc :-P Restructure my parents' room arrangement to maximize usage of space Guide my little brother in his college search, and teach him how to study better Pray like I've never prayed before

      "Sin and the One Ring"  It hit me today that Tolkien's description of the One Ring's effect on everyone is exactly the effect that sin has upon people.  If people wonder how others can get so hooked on things or romantic objects to the point of lost control, they should understand the mentality of Gollum.  It starts with a tiny desire in the back of mind that whispers its usefulness to the victim. Many times it's so subtle that the desire is instantly accepted and unchallenged, and so it goes and grows unchecked.  The mind slowly warps its inclinations and energies into depending upon that internal desire for escape from the droll feelings that life induces.  Soon, the pretty little ring, the cute girl, the fancy car, the allure of money, and the hot stereo cross from the realm of neutral to "my precious."  How do we fight it from happening, and how do we defeat it when it has happened already?  Christ alone has the ability to set us free from these things, and the Holy Spirit alone can assuage those droll feelings of life with a deep and satisfaction in knowing Christ.  It is quite a difficult point to reach, but if you trust and firmly believe God loves you, He will bring you there.  I'm trying to come and know these things in my heart, but those old obsessive tendencies don't want to leave.  This journey will be long and arduous, but it must be taken.  I want to live, you know?

Come on, Tim, think of something good to say... think of something good....  ARRGGH!  I can't think of anything good to say!  Just in case if you were all wondering about my comments that matched every single entry, I had to manually insert the same comment thread for my entries, since Blogger would not publish.  Now that Blogger is successfully publishing in this rare window of time, the true comment threads match their respective entries, instead of all of the comment threads belonging to an old entry.  Dangit, that still wasn't much to say. Oh well.

            Will Work for Peanuts!   Due to the urging of a friend, I finally mustered up the nerve to resume working on my resumé.  I decided to do it through  urlLink Monster , since they made it easy.  I took my old resume and updated it, posted it, and began to submit it online.  I've also created a database in Microsoft Access to keep tabs on what is going on with each employer.  I am thinking of re-doing my site to make it my "HIRE ME" site.  Yeah, I'll make it all snazzy with a slick design, big muffler, high spoiler, window tint, and a nice new paint job.  Oh right, I'm talking about a website here.

      A year gone past.  I was thinking about the currently graduating seniors, so I decided to read  urlLink my entries from last year .   Wow, life sure has changed.  Those were some really good times, and I'm glad I blogged them for posterity.  During that time, I was strapped for cash, and I didn't have a job because I had just graduated and I had no idea where I would be or what I would do that summer.  Yet, God provided some indelible memories and a blessed last round of hanging out before leaving college, culminating in a trip to Austin to move Jimmy back home.  What a great trip, and Jimmy, I didn't realize it at the time, but that was the BEST BBQ I EVER HAD.  THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME TO "The Salt Lick."  IT WAS AWESOME.  You see, I wanted to taste Texas steak at the time, so it hampered my appreciative attitude that I should have exhibited after that fine meal.  But seriously, I have yet to eat such good BBQ.  Seriously.  If you ever happen to be in Austin, check that dig out.  You can't get more authentic than that, son!  And so now, here I am a year later.  I have dropped out of grad school, and I am searching for God's direction in life.  I am still as unsure about what I should do or be in the future, but this time around, I have a support network in place to lead me through.  Time to get truckin'.

      "The Pain of Loneliness"  I have to admit that an overwhelming loneliness has always resided within me.  I guess it doesn't show well to people that know me, but trust me, it's always been a grim travelling companion since childhood.  God has always given me the strength to deal with it well, until senior year of college.  Since graduation exactly one year ago —WHERE DID THIS YEAR GO?— it's gotten so bad to the point that my personality has changed.  I've had a shorter temper, I've had less control over what I say and do and feel, and I've been feeling lost to this degree that I haven't felt since those tumultuous adolescent years.  I wish I didn't become such a burnout this year, but I did.  I see so many of my peers that have been able to stick it through, but as for me, I was left behind in the dust.  God seems to have engineered this year to humiliate me.  He's shown me that I am very egotistical, unfocused, uncontrolled, impatient, and weak-willed.  On the flipside, He has constantly reminded me that I'm not alone, that people love me, and that He loves me.  He has constantly bombared me with the message of the Gospel, yet, it all still hasn't been enough to turn me around from the emptiness.  Why can't my heart deeply connect with these things?  Because only the Holy Spirit can do so.  Why has the Holy Spirit refrained from doing so?  I know that it's only Him that can make it happen, and that it's all in His wise timing, but in the meanwhile, it's frustrating for me and for everyone around me.

      I am a dreamer, hopelessly caught in thoughts thundering asunder. Paralyzed, I sit here while from my life sin, Frustration and weakness plunder Any sense of purpose, any desire or wonder.  God is a dreamer, hurling forth thoughts like thunder Like Zeus, but unimaginable in form and shape Creating and calling new life, that He may drape A blanket of praise over the bed of the universe.  Clinch this heart, Oh God, and drape that blanket over me Awaken me from my slumber, pull me from this clay so miry Of sin, and take the blood of Christ to purge my self-glory I fall on my knees, arms open wide, and cry, "Free me."

      "So teach us to number our days, that we may get a heart of wisdom." — Psalm 90:12  My father's 60th birthday is coming up.  My father has lived three score, and I'm at the beginning of my second score of life.   God, I am so confused and retarded concerning what I should do next.  I'm still looking for that elusive job, but something inside me tells me that I'm not looking hard enough, that I'm not seeking You with enough passion.  My father has spent two thirds of his life pursuing ministry in the context of being a pastor, but what context of ministry do You want me to join?  Pastoral?  The working world?  Missions?  Music?   I have been learning that even if I did know what God wanted to do with my life, I still would have no idea how to get there.  From looking at Joseph's life in Genesis, it seems that even if we know our calling in life, we must firmly grasp our Calling... the Call of the Father for His children to return to Him.  I know that I deeply need to respond to God's Call, but will I?

      "I will be with you again!" — "New Year's Day", from  War , by U2  This song clinched my desire to explore U2's trove of music.  I was taken in by the piano melodies in minor key, the wailing but unobtrusive guitar solos, the complex soundscape, the unforgettable bass lines, and Bono's emotional pleas.  This song encapsulates all the key elements of U2; give it a good listen or three, and you'll see what I mean.   urlLink Click Here to Download.

      "Oh no! I see... a spider web is tangled up with me!"  — "Trouble", from  Parachutes , by Coldplay  I went to  urlLink One Day 2003  expecting and thinking that I would hear God.  God did indeed speak, but He didn't do it in the same way as He did through the last One Day.  He used the last One Day to revolutionize my spiritual outlook; it led me to a path to I realize that God's passion for His glory has deep ramifications throughout every aspect of reality and every way we understand and interact with it.  Thus, I expected a similar revolution to occur, but I found that I already "knew" what the speakers talked about.  Instead, God showed me the reality of my ignorance of what I knew, of what messages the One Day organizers hoped to convey.  Although I knew everything in my mind, the emptiness and disconnection in my heart made me realize the ignorance of my spirit, my heart, and my soul.  The song lyrics used throughout worship left me hesistant in singing along, because I saw a deep rift between what they stated and my actual attitude and heart in my daily life.  Yes, worship is only true worship because of Christ alone.  However, this worship authenticates itself in our experience through our lives, and I'm realizing that I've slipped in my true heart of worship over the past couple of years.  God's already throwing many new curveballs into my life.  I am starting to endure those thoughts that tell me to shut down again, that say that I'm a failure and that I won't make it.  If there's anything I got out of this past weekend trip, it's to FINALLY START BELIEVING that God is true, God is righteous, and God will always keep His promises.  I haven't really believed it in my heart to the point that these beliefs shaped my attitudes and choices in life.  Instead, I let circumstances, bodily needs and wants, and fear shape my attitudes and choices in life.  Holy Spirit, in Jesus' name, I ask that you connect my heart to Your Promises, to Yourself.

      Isn't it funny how we so quickly surrender to our thoughts?  We are so quick to listen and to obey our personal assessments, but when it comes to hearing criticism, or simply responding to the realties of situations, we turn deaf.  I think it's not only sad, but a grim reality that many of us can't escape from this prison.  Many times, it manifests itself as depression, in which negative thoughts constantly plague a person's mind to a point of utter defeat and abject mental poverty.  Such is the case with me, in which self-critical thoughts have plagued my mind all of my life.  Of course, I didn't and currently do not have to listen to them, and herein lies my personal foil; there are definitely elements of personal responsibility.  But at the same time, it would be incomplete to ignore the crippling affect that they have on a person's life, sometimes more so than physical inhibitions.  My personal goal and prayer:  to know the Light.

      My brother and I rented three movies and watched one tonight, "Catch Me If You Can."   I was very impressed, Mr. Spielberg. This movie was incredibly good, one of your best. Kudos.   ****   These past years, I have been undergoing a process of humilation, a process that has been grinding my curious arrogance, already weak will, and weak heart into a bloody pulp on the pavement of life. I'm not just being hard on myself here; everything culminated up to this point, a point where I see that I have no sense of commitment, and where I see my extremely self-righteous independence that refuses advice. I see that subtle arrogance that creeps up whenever I see any iota of success due to my credentials. I see that i give in to my fear of this fake reality that all is lost, that all is lost. I see that false humility that comes in the form of depression over unmet expectations of self-supposed greatness. I want God to turn me away from all of this, and I want to live a life of victory.   However, why is it that the greater I desire victory, the greater I become defeated inside? Why is it that I am still undergoing a process of continual humiliation due to my ineptitudes and myopic life patterns? Why can't my stupid heart change, believe in the freedom found in Christ, and live overcome by blissful satisfaction in knowing, obeying, and ultimately giving glory to God?   What good is it a man, to gain the world but to lose his soul? Even worse, what good is it for him to fail at gaining the world, AND lose his soul?   Christ, were you crucified for me? I still can't see it, and it frustrates me. I'm at the point of freedom. I'm at the point of spiritual breakthrough; my mind is rapidly eager to comply to your sovereignty over existence, and my heart desires for your healing, forgiviness, and freedom. Yet, my soul continues to refuse, and I'm left as a slave to my lusts. Oh soul within me, let Christ free you! Oh soul within me, put your hope in God! Oh soul within me, warm yourself to the fires of Christ's freedom! Oh Spirit of God, breathe life into this dead soul, that I may see light amidst my darkness, that I may fight and perservere with a strength not my own!

      What I Did Today:  - Practiced voice - Gave my first guitar lesson to Andy Kim - Watched " urlLink The Animatrix " - Went to Flushing, NY to watch  urlLink Neah Lee  debut CD release concert - Thought about a lot of things.  What I thought about today:  - Flushing is a totally different world: it is Korea in America, and going there heightened the fact that I am not as Korean as I am an American.  It also reminded me why I don't like New York Korean teens that much; at least, it reinforced my stereotypes.  This last fact may come as a shock to you, and I know that I will get a lot of flack for saying this, but I've only been proven wrong a scant number of times.  I am repulsed by the  false sense of sophistication  instilled from living in New York, coupled with its resultant desensitized/snobby attitudes to anyone non-NY.  I'm not alone with these opinions, either.  The good part is, these negative things can be corrected; most (but not all) college/post-college New York Koreans I know are definitely more mature, humble, and sophisticated than I in so many ways.  Goodness, I feel so inadequate sometimes when I'm around these brothers and sisters.  - I encapsulated my problem:  extremely independent in mind and personality, coupled with an intense self-deprecation, fueled by a desire to be praised and worshipped.   These things lead to insecure and therefore high-tension relationships, unfinished projects and unrealistic expectations in life, perpetual frustration.  - Pursuing music as a serious career path.  In order to do this, I need to: take voice lessons and theory class, and eventually save up money to go to music technology school at JHU/Peabody, NYU, or Berklee; practice guitar, voice, and recording; acquire guitar and recording equipment, Macintosh with Max/MSP; establish a solid support system consisting of people I trust, resources, genuine faith, artistic vision; find a BAND, or a mentor.  - A friend of mine actually was glad for me upon hearing me say that I had left grad school.  I think she's the only one that really understood me all along, which is comforting to know that someone did.  - I need a real taste of Christ.

      I stayed up tonight and, on a whim, recorded U2's New Year's Day.  This song will be an ongoing project this year, and what you hear is only a demo.   urlLink Click Here  if you want to download it.  ****  "A boy tries hard to be a man, his mother takes him by his hand, if he stops to think, he starts to cry, 'Oh why?'", wailed an 18 year old Bono on his band's first hit single.  Bleary-eyed, hunched over, and empty, I live my life wondering what happened to me.  What happened to my ambition?  What happened to me in the past 2 years?  The ball of snow formed during the summer after my junior year.  I spent a summer at Hopkins hospital in a research lab run by an elderly Chinese man.  I learned some important research skills that summer, but it left me angry, bitter, and frustrated.  The ball of snow didn't melt in the summer, it only grew, and rapidly gained circumference during my senior year.  I withdrew into my apartment, and spent most of my time either studying, writing, listening to music, or making it.  I got the best grades I had ever gotten in my college career that year.  I thought it to be a smart thing to go for a Ph.D. instead of trying to find a job right out of school.  Yet a year afterwards, here I am, a 23 year old man that dropped out of his program in search of a job.  As I read that last line to myself, I angrily questioned in my mind,  Me, a man?     I am but a boy, the same little boy that didn't have the strength to stand up for himself, the same little boy that feared the opinion of every new face he saw.  I am but a boy, but an overeducated boy that can't find his place in his world, but a petulant boy unable to find his reason or rhyme.  Am I running out of time?   Oh, why?

      I went into the city today to meet up with  urlLink Koo Chung , a friend of a couple of my friends.  He's already gone through a lot that I've personally gone through, so I asked him a lot of questions.  I got many answers that helped me immensely, and to God and Koo I'm grateful for a time well spent.  Albums I Need(Donations are much welcomed! :-D)  Andrew Osenga - "Photographs" -  Upon recommendation by Koo.  I listened to samples off the net, and thought it was an interesting concept .  Interpol - "Turn On The Bright Lights" -  These guys are like the American version of Joy Division and Radiohead to me.  Gloriously depressing, cacophonic yet melodic rock that makes you feel like you got attitude just by listening to it .  Radiohead - "Hail To The Thief" -  I recorded it off of the preview release off of www.mtv.com a couple of weeks ago, to see how the new songs turned out.  I had heard bootlegs of concerts they had done in Portugal and Spain last summer, and loved some of the new work debuted there.  These guys also make you feel smart just by listening to their stuff.  This is such an intense album .

      Not many people know this, until now of course, but I have a fear of any sort of confrontation.  Sometimes it strikes in such strange ways, such as having to ask a question at a store counter, applying for a job, talking to a much elder adult, or, recently, talking to a member of the opposite sex.  If you have seen "The Shawshank Redemption,"  it's similar to the fear that Morgan Freeman's character had in facing the outside world.  He was so shaken by the release from rules and restrictions, he didn't know what to do with his freedom.  Over the past couple of years, I've been trying to face these fears.  I've been trying to see what I can do with my freedom, but many times, like Freeman's character, I let my fear of the unknown replace the possibilities of the unknown.  God, give me a desire so great to know You, that it may guide my actions to flourish in this freedom in Christ.

      A passion for God's glory to be known, tasted, and relished by others A passion for God to be praised instead of suspiciously rejected A passion to know, taste, and relish in God's glory A passion to praise and trust God, instead of suspiciously rejecting Him  These passions are those that I should have but have lost.  These passions say that they are the only ones worth pursuing.  These passions promise eternal security and fulfillment, but call for the loss of their present forms.  Three years ago, my heart burned for these passions to consume it.  Three months ago, my heart angrily questioned their worth to it.  Three days ago, my heart cried over their absence from it.  Without passion, this life has become listless, adrift and amiss.  What will it take to wake up from this slumber?  What will it take to rehydrate this life from this drought of action?  Funny that things went downhill, after I made a firm conviction to live out preaching the Gospel daily.  I guess in order to really know it, God had to show me what little I know.

      What an irony, that when we fight for all of the attention, all of the love, all of the goods in this world, we don't get any.  What a mystery, that when we give all of our attention, love, and goods to the world, we gain them.  What an oft-repeated adage, what a hackneyed idea to hear!  Yet, why do we still fight for all of the attention, all of the love, and all of the goods in this world, when we don't get them?  If we know in our minds, why don't others see in our lives?

      "Oh Snap"  I noticed that only New Yorkers say this bit of slang as an exclamation point.  Californians say "Dang," and at least my friends from Philly and I said, "Dag."  It's funny how regional dialects go unnoticed until confronted by outsiders.  We sometimes don't even realize which things we utter are regional.  Some Philadelphians pronounced water as "wooder," but when asked of it, they wouldn't know what you're talking about.  I moved a lot in the northeast while growing up, so the only thing that I've known to be regional is that I pronounce orange as "ah-rinj" vs. "oh-rinj," and Sarah with the a in "Sar" rhyming with "Sap" or "Sat," unlike the Chicago "SEHR-ah."  As for Southerners, they're in a league of their own.  It's a hot and muggy SAT-urday here in New Jersey;  I think I'll cool off with some iced tea.  Ohhhh snap.

      Yesterday, I bought the following two items at Target, on a whim:  Interpol's debut CD for $10, Platoon DVD for $15.  I just finished screening the DVD after a long day of hiking at the  urlLink green and rocky trails of Mohonk , dinner at a youth group member's house, and a night of fireworks at my little brother's high school.  The Mohonk trails were beautiful and challenging, breathtaking and physically demanding.  In the fall, I learned the foliage views are unmatched, vibrant symphonies of color.  I must go again this fall.  After dinner, I played Tekken for the first time in years, it was another rush.  The fireworks display were well worth the time spent going to watch them; they went on for a good half hour, and we had a great view.  ***  I did not expect anything out of Platoon besides it worth my being first bought DVD.  I did not expect anything but justification for the Academy Award for Best Picture.  At the movie's conclusion, I had satisfaction, for sure.  I did think that he didn't have to state some obvious points, but I am glad that Oliver Stone created this masterpiece.  ***  During authoring this blog entry, it had come to my attention that Barry White, the greatest singer of lovin', died this morning.  Goodness, we will all miss that man.   urlLink Here's the NY Times obituary .

      "Lookin' for, lookin' for to save my.... soul..."  i wake up each day hoping that the following turn of events will be different from the previous day.  i go to sleep each day disappointed that they stayed the same.  an army of ants crawl up my pants.  i push them down, but one by one, still they come.  armed with teeth, seething past my fingers to reclaim what they had lost.  once cleansed, always cleansed, but still they climb, a juggernaut of many.  the pale glow from my computer screen bathes the room in self glory.  moving pictures, static fixtures, a false electron story.  hope lies in the vision, but death in tele-vision.  "They were hungry and thirsty, and their  lives ebbed away .  Then  they cried out to the LORD  in their trouble, and  he delivered them  from their distress.  He led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle.  Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men, for  he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things ."  — Psalm 107   my mouth is open, i wait.  straightaway, i look to a city where i can settle.  pizza delivered fresh from the oven to the door.  lift me up from the floor.  rejuvenate, resonate, resuscitate.  pluck strings to vibrate freedom, repeating in wire and silicon, speakers lifting and lilting.  stand up and fight; to arms my friend, to arms my friend.  charge forth with head down, flare those nostrils.  ready the sword, the breastplate, the shield of faith.  to arms, my friend, to arms.

      "Strange Dreams"  I dreamt that I was walking to school, talking to ***** on the phone.  We were catching up on things, but much to our consternation my phone kept losing reception in the middle of the conversation.  Finally, the reception seemed to be fine, until I walked off of the dock that I didn't notice.  "I'll call you back!  I fell into the water!"  Jamming the phone into my pocket, I slackened my limbs and began to float upon my waterproof bookbag.   The current drifted me towards the dock; seizing the opportunity, I pulled myself up onto dry ground.  Everything was intact with exception of my hat, which had blown off as I had fallen in.    "My BABY!" screamed a thirty-something woman.  The toddler had just fallen into the dock as well, her last known words being a cheerful, "I love you, mommy!"  The woman had sat absorbed in her studies until she heard her baby's splashing.  I stood thinking of the person with whom I had just been talking.  I walked to my campus, found a spot with good reception and gave a call.  Ring one.  Ring two.  Ring three.   I can't believe this person would be mad at me, when I had just risked drowning.   Ring four.  Ring five, and the phone picked up.  "Hello?  Hey, I had fallen off the dock, I had to rescue myself from the water!"  No answer greeted me but the sounds of a group of friends aimlessly chatting.  "Hello? Are you there?"  I gave up after a couple more tries, and walked to my dorm.  The RA greeted me.  "Tim, you fear that you don't have any skills, that you had wasted all of your time here, but I believe in you.  We're going to hold a meeting soon to campaign for the school to abstain from knocking this dorm down next year."  Nodding, I walked to the dorm lounge and sat at the bar counter.  The residents piled in and sat in a circle.  We had our meeting, and I requested we close with our respective prayers.  The Jewish guy next to me sneered and told me to refrain from shoving my belief in Christ upon them.  Startled, I sat back, but we still had the time of prayer.

      1)  Please visit  urlLink this site for a new Fox TV show  and give me your opinions.  Is it racist?  Is it not?  If it is racist, what should be done?  Visit the "angry asian man" link in my link list to the right.  2)  urlLink Here is an article on "white privelige" in America.   I found it to be an interesting read.  3)  I'm not an Asian rights activist.  However, there are times when I see that I can't avoid these issues.  I can't forget episodes in which I was negatively singled out for being Asian in a historically non-Asian atmosphere.  I understand the people's reactions now, but as a kid it wasn't easy for me to understand.  While it took me a while to forgive, there always be cultural reminders that don't let me forget.  For example, last weekend a black kid on the subway asked me if I knew martial arts.  Was it an innocent question, or was it a question formed by her parents' and cultural training?  I'm not so sure, but either way, it reminded me of the same questions specifically rising from racist attitudes in the past experiences.  I don't think it's an issue I can ever forget in this lifetime, because there will always be reminders.

      After waking and going through morning routines, I jammed a bit on my electric, then carted myself off to New York again.  Earlier this week, I had found out about this really interesting theatre troup,  urlLink New York Classical Theatre .  They perform for free in Central Park for a couple of months in the summers.  This troupe isn't the traditional "Shakespeare in the Park" that people know about, and they don't perform in the Delacorte amphitheater.  They perform on the ACTUAL PARK grounds!  It was really a sight to see and follow, as they moved throughout the crowd and used the park landscape as their stage and props.  Some of the fun was in watching the decent acting.  It was not the best, obviously, but good for what you pay: nothing!  However, the real fun was in the guessing of where the next scene would take place, rushing to get the best view, and sometimes discovering that the actors would be moving through the crowd right by you.  And, suprisingly, they were very clear and audible, considering the impossibility of using any sort of amplification.  This production is a great way to relax and have a good, carefree time amidst the din of the city.  Sunday, June 29th is the last performance of the current production, "Much Ado About Nothing," so if you read this before 7 PM, check it out!  They're going to then put on another play during the month of August, so keep your eyes peeled if you happen to amble through northwest Central Park on a clear weekend evening. :-)  ****  The other reason I like to go to New York is the precious solitary enrichment I receive.  I get some of my best journaling and thinking done on my solitary New York sojourns, thanks to observing the plethora of material that pulses within the city, and thanks to the times of reflection as I take the train in and out of the city.  During the train rides in, I read and reflect upon what has happened to me up until that point in life.  During the time in the city I observe the people of all races, purposes, and backgrounds, the visual cacophany of urban architecture, and the cultural resources.  And, finally, as I return from the city,  I take in all that I had expected coming in, what I had received during my stay, and where I should go next in life.  I appreciate every moment; thanks, God.

      Every trip to New York reminds me of how small and banal I am, because it is my view of this world's vastness.  Not simply a geographical reminder, it presents a view of its vast sociological landscape, the myriad of talent, experience, and minds that exists in this world.  This view presents different lessons every time I go.  It challenges me to evaluate my dreams, to differentiate tangible visions from delusions of grandeur.

      Good day, readers.  I will post a stereotypical blog entry, instead of a usual snippet of my mental state.  On Wednesday, I took my younger brother Joe to New York.  For some reason, I couldn't sleep that night, so I worked on a cover letter.  My roommate dropped us off at the student center on his way to work.  I instantly dozed on the campus bus due to exhaustion.  I dozed on the train to NY due to exhaustion.  After I took a picture of Joe in front of Penn Station escalators, we walked north to Sam Ash and bought him wire drum brushes.  We crossed the street to Manny's, where I played with a $2100 and a $3000 Martin.  I didn't see the justification for the price, although they did sound good.  I noted the Martin from the 1930s going for $35,000, and headed for the electric guitars.  I laughed at the $2000+ sticker prices for the electrics, and wondered what could possibly justify these prices.  I saw a line of Fender knockoffs called " urlLink Tom Anderson Guitarworks " and picked up the  urlLink Telecaster wannabe .  Ok, so, it did sound good.  Fine, so, it sounded great, good enough to make me smile and improvise like I haven't for a while.  It left a good feeling.  But $2100?  Joe and I walked to the New York Public Library, where we took more pictures and read until 6.  At around 3, we took a lunch break at Subways, and ran back the library in pouring rain that stopped upon our arrival.  Go figure.  We explored the northwestern section of Central Park, since it was close to Columbia.  We stupidly walked into an isolated section of the park, and ran into a man in his twenties that tried to scam/threatened us.  I was pissed but couldn't do anything because I saw two people hiding in the trees; I didn't want to risk it.  I told Joe to give him a five.  I told him that I trusted everything he said, smiled politely, and he finally left.  We prayed for him as we walked off.  I wished I was bigger, so that I wouldn't look like an easy target.  I took Joe to Columbia since he had an interest in applying there.  We in front of the center lawn and read.  Afterwards, we met up with Jimmy Choi at Koronet, then watched live jazz at Cleopatra's Needle.  The quartet —more like, a trio of Japanese musicians in their late 20s that hired a black sax player— was decent;  Jimmy said that they were strictly "by the book" in their playing.  Listening to and watching the guitarist made me feel like I didn't know a thing about the guitar.  What shame, what shame.  Jimmy drove us to Penn Station.  Joe and I caught a train that was just about to leave.  An annoying couple that had just gotten out of a Pearl Jam concert at Madison Square Garden sat behind us.  I fell asleep to their profanity-laced antics, wishing that I could fall into a deep sleep to block them out.  My roommate graciously picked us up at that late hour.

      For the past couple of weeks, I've been praying about improving my voice.  However the more I pray, the harder a time I have with singing.  It feels like everything that I've worked up to (a point not that far to being with) has all gone to waste, as my throat is so tight, my focus so shot that I can't even sing normally anymore.  It's interseting that this all happened after I asked for my voice to improve.  Is this a flat out "no" from God?  Is this a challenge He's throwing at me to get even better?  Is this even something I should care about now?  Regardless, I need help with my voice, and with my music.  I need an external source of accountability, like a teacher, to help me with my voice and guitar issues.  Ah, but if I only had the funds to do so...

      What keeps me from pursuing, in doubt, and full of frustration?  Answer:  a short fuse, oversensitivity to emotion.  God, i wish i wasn't me sometimes.  I need rescuing from myself.  i need an rx-8 and a california highway out of here.  i need a metamorphosis of epic proportions.  I need this, i need that.  what did the apostle paul say in philippians?  "...I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty.   I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want .   I can do everything through him who gives me strength ."  God, I wish my heart to be of similar nature to say this with genuine belief, not frustrated ritual.

      In chemistry, in order to begin a reaction, one needs to add a certain amount of  activation energy .  This process can be lengthy or quick, depending upon the chemicals at play and the existence of a catalyst that lowers the required activation energy.  My job search process has been slow because it seems like no catalyst exists in my situation, that I have to keep exerting more effort to get to the top of the hill of energy.  It just seems to me that fuel keeps leaking, that winds keep blowing the flame out, because things are getting even harder, and time is running out.  The more time I spend in here, I become more socially passive and inept.  I just wish I could just get a good lead.  I received a call yesterday morning from a headhunter for biomedical companies in North Jersey.  Apparently, he found my resume off of my Monster posting.  That was an encouraging moment for me, to see that at least someone took notice in my resume.  However, I'm a bit flustered with how muc more I have to go.  God, it'll only be God that can place me in the right place.

      Well, I've fallen back to the old groove again.  Throughout college, I conceived and finally started this website with the purpose of  showing the Christian life in full honesty , and to show  the regenerate life enduring the flames of life's furnace .  However, I didn't realize what flames would come, or in what intensity.  What intensity, what intensity!  Flames of sadness, flames of fear Burned my confidence into fine ashes.  Can I be the phoenix that rises after death's summon?  I must get up, I must.  I must face the fear of confrontation of the unknown; will I face it with boldness, will I face it alone?  Will I face my fear with abandon, or will my bravado turn to stone?  A sign, a sign, I asked for a sign.  If I see it, will it truly make a difference?

      Today was my brother's birthday.  I didn't do anything for him.  I spent the past couple of days playing and beating "Treasure Hunter G," the last game that Square released for the Japanese Super Nintendo.  I was able to get a translated version.  What a hollow existence.

      I've been working on a new recording.  Up until this point, response to the work in progress has been positive overall, thank goodness.  ****  People have wondered why I'm so hard on myself, and I wonder about that as well.  I realize that I'm more easily dissatisfied with anything than I am satisfied.  Being so hard on myself stems from looking at myself too much, and since I tend to be dissatisfied instead of satisfied, I become so self-critical.  If I were more prone to be satisfied with things, I would be overly satisfied in myself, and therefore vain.  I therefore at times exhibit vain tendencies.  Either way, I'm still focused upon myself too much, not upon the world, God, nor others.  It is funny that we so easily grab onto things to complain about instead of things to rejoice about.  Why is that?  I think for me, when I complain, I have a sense of power because I am playing the part of the evaluator, the critic that can demand change.  If I rejoice about something, it's a response, not a critique.  When I rejoice, I admit that I have nothing to offer, for the object of my affections is complete, and I am simply overcome with marvel.  I'll summarize like thise:  I'd rather be  unhappy  in  satisfying my own greatness  than be  happy  in  finding the greatness of something else .  Isn't that odd?  The greatest object of rejoicing is Jesus, yet my heart does not see what my mind knows.  Jesus, let me rest in you, let me see You as You are, what You've done for me then, what You're doing around me now.

      Shall I wax upon my psychological/spiritual issues?  Nah.  I just want to scream.  An aimless life sure is frustrating.

      Rest.  A critical state of being for a Christian is the state in which the heart securely rests in God.  I think my issues always stem from denying God as the being real giver of peace, the real solace, the real shepherd.  I have never learned to trust the sovereign Giver to the point where I won't "be anxious about anything," but instead I'd be "praying and petitioning God with thanksgiving."  God, I keep running away from this truth.  I think this truth is what He has been teaching me this past year and a half.

      I've been hanging out with more people these days, and it helped because they forced me to share what was going on inside of me.  Increased social interaction and true honesty made me objectively look at myself.  This one's for John Kim:  I've also been in New York with higher frequency this week than usual, and will have to go again on Friday.  What a week it's been, trying to get the final details for next week's youth retreat ready.  Nugget number three:  a Buddhist Korean runs the photo development shop near my house.  It was interesting to meet a non-"Christian" immigrant generation Korean.  Quotes on "Christian," seeing that many "Christian" immigrant generation Koreans are nominal, at best.

      It's going to be a packed week.  It's the final preparation week for next week's PCA Summer Youth retreat, and I have to get major technical details figure out to make sure things work smoothly.  This means a lot of surveying, shopping, requesting, and fangling around with audio and video equipment.  God, have mercy on us all.

      The pressure has been building up inside my chest the past year again.  It's a psychosomatic reflection of the anger and frustration that I can't seem to escape.  Where's the Gospel now?  Where is Jesus?  Today, I really tried to hold it in when I was with people, because it had nothing to do with anyone I encountered.  I didn't want it to take it out on anyone.  I got home, and tried to fix my dad's vcr in the sweltering conditions of my father's den.  It got to the point where I threw it onto the ground in frustration.  All of the pent up anger started to come out; I felt like my chest was exploding.  I walked over to the garage, grabbed a bat, and started to hit the cardboard boxes.  Unsatisfied, I walked outside and hit a tree.  I was trying to take out the anger on anything that wouldn't yield disastrous repercussions if destroyed.  What god would I turn to for my help?  I glanced at my guitar.  I thought about going online.  I thought about talking to God about it.  Placing the bat in its original place in the pile of junk in my garage, I walked upstairs and started to write this entry.  Let's just say that I'm not doing well these days.  I'm listless, unmotivated, frustrated, angry, and I don't want to be near God.  I hate my life.  Out of habit, I wake up and go online because the good feelings from chatting with people and reading journal entries make me forget my anger.  Playing video games, watching movies, going online: these three bastions of entertainment suck the life out of me.  I have to find a job, I have to work on planning a retreat, I have to develop a good lesson for my tutees.  In order to do these things, I need a car.  I need passion, purpose, the will to act.  But, I don't, and as a result, without a will, there is no way, and so I am stuck in this box of crippling anger.  Fine, tell me that I'm frustrating.  Tell me that I'm impossible, tell me that I make my own prison.  Tell me that I'm too hard on myself.  Tell me whatever suggestions I should do, whatever problems I have.  But am I asking for it?  Is my heart open to hear?  All will sound grating to my ear.

      After working with more people for this retreat, God has been showing me:  1) I'm very self-centered 2) I am more in tune with my negative emotions than with my positive emotions 3) Everything that people do well in life is done with much preparation and perserverance 4) I don't have much perserverance and foresight to be well-prepared 5) Hence, I am not doing many things well these days ;-D  But it has been good to see how I need God.

       Driven By Appetite   At 11:50 PM last night, I arrived at my parents' place to drop off video cds from the PCA Retreat.   When I entered the house, I closed the front door, but not the screen door, and turned the front light on.  An hour and half later, I got ready to leave, but wanted to share some songs with my little brother.  He left to get the CD from my car, but called my name in surprise.  I ran over to see that in that time since I had arrived, an inch-diameter spider had nearly completed weaving a spider web across the entire doorway.  My little brother and I stood and watched it meticulously weave the bullseye of its pattern.  After taking a couple of pictures, I noticed an iridescent, green cricket that had hopped in.  I picked it up with a nearby envelope and tossed it into the web.  Within a second, the spider had reached its position and cocooned it with fresh webbing.  The cricket quickly lost the struggle, after which the spider sunk its fangs in and injected paralytic poison.  For the next half hour, we sat transfixed upon the predator suck the life out of the cricket.  I realized it was time to leave, so I got a bat and gently undid the web.  All along the spider wasn't fazed; it singlemindedly set its actions upon finishing that cricket off.  Even after I had swung it outside, after the cricket landed on the step railing and the spider in the grass,  it crawled back all the way up and resumed its meal.  During my drive home, I thought to myself, "What a picture of passion for appetite.  It toiled for an hour and a half and weathered a far flung separation to satisfy its need for food.  What would life be like, if we were that hungry for God?"  What would it be like?

      "In striking back two days after a Hamas suicide bomber killed 20 people, including six children, aboard a Jerusalem bus, Israel was seeking to bring what Israeli officials said was a continuing conflict with the fundamentalist Islamic group to full boil, in order, the officials said, to end it.

Every single day, I can count on hearing about strife in the Middle East.  God, what a heart wrenching time we live in, that such strife exists in Your land.

      Isn't it odd that we should critically evaluate ourselves based upon what we perceive others to be?  ****  I've been praying and thinking.  What can I actually do to get myself out of this state of life?  What must be done?  I mean, I have prayed, and know that God will answer.  However, it seems that He will answer by showing me and leading me through practical changes in my lifestyle.  What can I do differently about my life?  These days, for the past year, I would walk up, cook, eat, chat, maybe browse for jobs online, chat, maybe read, then go to sleep late.  Here and there, I'd mix it up with hanging out with a friend, or if I had to do so something in prep for last week's retreat, I'd go out and do it.   Maybe I should find my own place?  Maybe I should write a list of things I'd like, then write the list of things I'd have to do to get there, then do it.

      I'm listening to the sounds of the new Stereolab EP entitled, " urlLink instant 0 in the universe ."  Just the sounds I expected from these folk:  experimental, odd, catchy beat.  If anyone wondered why I got so into Radiohead's "Kid A" album, play them some of the Stereolab material I was into during high school.  Trust me, Radiohead will sound normal in comparison.  Who says pop has to be for everyone?  (wait a minute... then it's not pop anymore... oh, my brain... can't handle... paradox...)  ****  For the longest time, I've been starving; I haven't been digesting God's Word well.  I've been having bites here and there, but they were quickly swallowed, unmasticated, undigested.  Recently, I've been trying to get myself back into it, and it has been difficult.  But it feels so good; how could I have put off eating for so long?

       Like rolling boulders up a mountain .  Why do we have inertia in life?  Why does it fluctuate in waves?  There are those times in life where we're motivated, excited, and charged to get things done.  Then there are those where it takes marching bands, blaring sirens, and cracking whips to get our parades moving.  Yes, I've been in the second category for a long time.  The retreat helped me wake up a little, but I feel the boulder getting larger again.  It'd be nice to have a bulldozer named Jesus to help push it along...  Push it along, yeah, push it along.

      My mind has atrophied in the past couple of months, and so my posts have become increasingly thoughtless.  I apologize for those that used to come to my site expecting to read posts of more substance.  Then again, it has accurately echoed the state of my mind and heart for the past summer, so maybe it still did its job well.  ****  Time to sleep, yet time to reap The dormant flames from the depths The burning lights under nightcaps  Let the clouds roll in, let the clouds roll in, The fingers of God knife through again And the shadows flee like running men  And the shadows flee like running men.  The retreat deeply reminded me why I had to and how I could let go of my frustrations.  Since then, I've been able to handle frustration better.  What a breath of fresh air!

      We woke up and drove to the train station.  I lost my phone, but the train arrival time had just... arrived, and we had to repark.  We rode into the city in one of the newer NJ transit cars.  I sat beside a brushed aluminum metal pole, after which two elderly squeezed beside me.  We took the subway and walked to 48th and 3rd, where we met Dave at his office building.  After going out to Chinese and having some good conversation, we walked to the public library and read until 3 PM.  After we got back, Jiyoung did his laundry, and I used the phone to call my phone to no avail.  After we went out for some pizza and came back to my place, we packed and left.  I had a hunch that I had dropped the phone this morning during the rush to catch the train, so we backtracked to the train station.  True to my suspicions sat my phone, camoflauged against the gray gravel in the parking lot.  We drove up, spent some time with church people, rented movies from Blockbuster, and drove back.   One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest  had a very solid production, especially from its cast of actors.  That's all I can say right now, because I am tired, and thise post has been too long.

      Jason Lee came at 11, and I tutored him on conic sections.  Jiyoung came in around 1, and is staying until we all go up for church Friday night.  We had Tastee Subs for lunch;  they are by far some of the best subs you'll ever have, especially the #3 with added pepperoni.  We got bubble tea/smoothies afterwards.  I got all dressed up and ready, then went to the audition.  The fellow auditionees —is that a word?— were pretty cool.  I got in.  Training starts later this month.  Once I'm trained, I can work at any Kaplan center that I'd like in the country, if I happen to move.  Therefore, guaranteed source of some income, I guess.  Thanks, God.  Tomorrow, we will head into the city to have lunch with a church member that works on 48th Street and 3rd Ave.  Ok, next up:  find real job, develop musical, visual art, engineering skills, and knowledge of God above all.  Right.  We live by grace alone, for His glory alone...  oh Lord, make this true at every moment!

Help me to make this true in my life.

      Up until now, my life has consisted of ongoing struggles to be a significant artist somehow, but failing miserably at each attempt.  I found that I was and am too scatterbrained, too interested in every medium to focus and discipline and develop and complete a single work of art.  What I have wanted to do and become:  1) Be a kickin' live and recording musician that knows how to play, mix, and compose music  2) Make a defining website that states my purpose, that exhibits my works, and that more importantly points people to God through every nook and cranny of the site 3) Take compelling photos, create artistically complete visual art 4) Have a command of engineering and programming to build/fix hardware and write programs that would aid in the process of the previous three items 5) Continually grow in a deep relationship with God, grow in my knowledge of Him and His attributes  I've taken a look at these criteria, and found myself lacking in all areas for many reasons.  The first reason would be that they all equally require large amounts of dedicated time.  The second would be that I don't even know if I have the ability to do all of these things.  The third reason is that I need to work in order to survive, and that also takes time.  As a result of these reasons, I have always failed to reach any level of mastership of any of these five areas of life.  I would see someone excelling in one of these areas, judge myself based upon that conception, and wallow in self-piteous frustration.  God has been good to humble me in many ways, and He has taught me that first of all, I am a product of God's hands, not my own.  Unlike humanistic philosophies that say otherwise, God led me to every situation in life, led me to experience every pain and humiliation, every joy and triumph.  He led me to act and allowed me to form my own self-trusting methods of coping and fail each time.  Second of all, God has taught me that "He is not done yet" —a point hammered in me through a sermon I heard given by Rev. Rich Craven— and that time can only tell when I will learn to develop all of these areas of my life, if they all end up developing.  People including myself have wondered why I can't focus on just one thing, but I am irresistably drawn to all of these things.  I still wish that I was more disciplined and structured with all of these things, so that I can be more efficient in faithfully developing these talents.  I just wish to be responsibly faithful to giving God glory through the products that come out of my mastery of these five criterion.  Christ, be Lord of me, of all these things!

      I'm thinking about starting to build my own studio.  First in order is a real multitracking system, so I'm thinking about getting  urlLink this entry level Pro Tools mixer system , or  urlLink a multitracking PCI card  and using my Cubasis VST program that I already have.  I'd also like to have real musical skills.  That would be nice as well. :-)  Been learning that there's a deep reality of Christ being the Lord of  everything  .

      Can I walk upon the water if my eyes are fixed on Jesus, the Christ?  I find that I haven't had my eyes on Him for a long time now.  It figures that the more I've avoided him, the more I've plunged into obscurity and seas of depression.  Well, forgive me, I know not what I do. Cut me some slack, maybe I'll get there. Don't know why I've become the way I am, But cut me some slack, maybe I'll get there.

      This weekend:  1) Church Family Retreat  I didn't feel well, due spiritual attack, back pains, unsavory food at the center, and fatigue.  I had my first nightmares for the first time in years; overwhelming sensations of crabbiness and laziness vied for control, and I just didn't want to be there.  But, I felt better, and I got over my issues ok.  2) Celebrated  urlLink Ji Young's  birthday today.  He's a blessing to have at church.  Kindred spirit, brother at heart.  3) Watched the movie " urlLink Hero ".  I was very impressed by the cinematography, editing, artistic presentation of the story, and themes.  Check it out.

      I just noticed something today.  Drawing from the four movies I've seen within Jack Nicholson's career, I notice something similar from each movie.  Every character had a quality of isolation.  They were all placed in an environment from which no escape existed: an insane asylum from  One Flew over the Cluckoo's Nest , an isolated Rocky Mountain Hotel from  The Shining , a psychological, mental prison of insanity as the Joker in  Batman , and over-the-hill circumstances in  About Schmidt .  Jack Nicholson played a protagonist that had to come to terms with or become subdued by the prison of his environment.  It seems, the only character that gave the semblance of successful escape (if that's how the movie is to be interpreted, it can go either way) is Warren Schmidt from  About Schmidt .  I just thought it interesting that he seems to have picked all these roles to portray themes of coping with inevitability and the loss of control; he definitely acted perfectly for every one.

      Sometimes I find wisdom stated from the most unexpected places.  I was reading through my Kaplan training material, and found something that I slightly knew but never really thought about.  It stated that the teachers are not to expect students to gain mastery in the classroom, but out.  We're to lay the groundwork for mastery; our job is to present concepts and foundation, point them to sound practice tools and techniques, and watch them use all of the elements to gain their own mastery.  I think that I'm learning more and more that my frustration in life has always come from expecting instant mastery of subjects in life, instead of realizing that I first must learn the foundations that would lead to mastery.  Mastery, or the mark of excellence in a skill, comes as a product of our inherent properties.  I have been taking the step to become more patient about things, thanks to the God above that has been leading me all the way.  I have so much more to go, but the Master Teacher is laying the foundations.  God, if You desire, grant me vision, faithfulness and perserverance, for my benefit, for Your glory.  Let my progress in life never be a testament to my greatness, but a testament to Your graciousness and Your omnipotence.  Let my failures in life never be a testament to any lack of care on Your part, but to be a testament of Your loving acts of discipline.  Transform me from deep within, and let me be Yours in my spirit, in Truth.  In Jesus' name I bring these requests, with full thanksgiving for the privilege to make them.  Amen.

      "Unresolved Resolutions"  Difficult social situations occured last year, of which I perceive myself to be largely at fault.  I could be wrong about that perception, but that's what I've always figured.  I just wonder if every party involved has fully healed from the affair.  I'm still in the process, but my concern is for the others involved.  Are they also on the road to healing, or have they chose to deal by forgetting and ignoring?  What do I do?  I don't know if its in my place —"in my place, were lines that I couldn't change, I was lost..."— to reestablish contact and determine if true healing occurred on all parties.  "Where do we go?  Nobody knows.... God give me style, God give me grace."  ****  "How long must you wait for it?"  So many plans, so many directions, but none exist pursued.  Where do I go from here?  What does it mean to "give it all to God"?  What does it really mean, from the practical point of view?  What things do we give, and how do we actually give something to Someone unseen and intangible?  What actually changes in our lives to "surrender all to Jesus?"  What actions and habits change?  What do we do at 2:37 PM that is different from the pre-"give it all to God" stage of life?  What in the world does "surrender all to Jesus" mean?  And, if we find out, would be willing to do it?  Is it a daily  quiet time ?  Is it an allocation of our monetary resources to the church?  Is it going to a remote village in the Himalayas?  Is it a transmission to others of the message, "give it all to God," when we don't even know what actually is the 'it' in that statement?  What does it mean to "give it all to God"?

       Ah, so the real issues came out?   "Yeah, yeah they did."   Oh.  Uh, well then, what are they?   "Hm, well, I guess I'll start with the way my mind works.  Once it latches onto something, it has to work it, probe it, analyze it, bring it to fruition.  When I'm working on a project or something, that's great, because that makes me 'detail-oriented' and 'thorough,' as the sayings go.  But the problem is that my deep focus tunes people out of the equation.  Often times, the object of study ironically is some person in question.  There's some fault, some quirk about them that I feel must be fixed, and must be fixed by me.  This isn't necessarily bad, but it usually becomes so, because I forget that they're human, and they have feelings.  I try to make suggestions, I try to work out ways to deal with them.  I get emotionally involved, and start dismissing the person's ideas.  Hence, I become insensitive, arrogant, obnoxious."   I see, so it's good that you see this.  But how are you going to work on these things?  How will you replace them with healthier ways of thinking and patterns of conduct?   "Honestly, I have no idea.  The most obvious thing to first do is pray and ask God about these things.  I'm hopefully going to find accountability with these issues, as well.  But beyond this?  I surely do not know."   Ok, then, I'll just start praying for you.   "Thanks, I appreciate it."

      My goodness, what a weekend.  I had a great time learning to play Risk with my fellow church brothers.  It was especially good because my brother and I won, and it was our first time playing :-D.  Heh heh.  I think it was godo because I saw in what ways that I'm self absorbed, and how it manifests itself as disrespect, arrogance, and laziness.  I saw how I'm so wrapped up in my personal agenda, I ignore the welfare of those around me.  God, have mercy on me, and help me to be simply obedient, open, and loving.  What a rough lesson this weekend.

      Every time I read  urlLink the NY Times , my heart skips, and I ask myself, "What could ever be done to ameliorate the insanity in the Middle East?"  My immediate emotional response is best summarized by  urlLink Radiohead  in their most recent album,  urlLink  Hail to the Thief  .  On 9/11, I remember that I pleaded with God that Bush and the rest of our nation's leaders would treat the situation with integrity and forgiveness.  Now, all I see is preemptive wars and a McCarthy-esque hunt for terrorists; it just seems like Bush's administration has only fed the reasonings of its detractors, of all the terrorist groups.  What actions could our nation's leaders possibly take in order to prove all of these people wrong?  A deeper fear for me lies in the possibility that our current situation points to darker times ahead.  It doesn't seem like the situations in the Middle East are improving.  It's a sad thing that I can always count on reading about another bombing, another missle attack, another death in the wake of some group's mission of retribution.

      I can't believe i woke up at 12:30 PM today.  It must have been all those times I woke up shivering in the cold, or trying to reorient my aching back on the sheet rock of a mattress.  But all is well, at least I am up.  ****  It's becoming apparent to me that I'll have to seriously change my habits if I want to stay afloat this season.  The consequences for laziness aren't bad grades any longer.  If I don't live up to my tasks at hand, the repercussions will be a bad professional reputation and no money for my survival.  And neither of those shall be good.  On the higher scheme of things, I want all that I do to be of the highest quality that can come out from me.  To be honest, I've rarely worked with absolute dedication to come up with a product I feel is a true extension of whom I am.  It is this ideal that has kept me in the swamps of frustration; I never lived up to it due to my bad habits and orientation of lifestyle.  I admit it now:  I'm lazy.  I don't like to face the uncomfortability of work.  Even if it's work that I enjoy, my mind and heart would rather have the instant gratification of inactivity than the satisfaction of seeing my handiwork.  God, how can my heart and mind become more passionate for the joy resulting from obedience and work, than for the volatile deception of laziness?  Give me a deeper passion for You.

      I just got a tutoring job that will pay me handsomely to perform a very difficult task.  I don't know how I'm going to do this job.  I am called to train two middle school kids that came from Korea an year ago to pass the  urlLink SSATs  this November.  Is this possible?  Their command of English is slight, and I lack the real sense of pedagogy to bring them up to speed.  I also have to prepare for Kaplan training.  I also need to find a car.  I also need to find a good steady job, with medical and dental benefits.  I also need to continue my pursuit of music: research recording equipment, guitar practice, and song practice.  I also need to continue reading the Word and some other goodies.  I also need God.  Man, I think life is starting to pick up again.

      This past weekend, I went to Philly with Jimmy to enjoy his church's community fair, then went to Baltimore to reunite with my college church and my family of friends.  1)  Jimmy's church's community fair served me a slice of pure Americana.  Picture this classic Norman Rockwell delight:  free pretzels, hot dogs, snow cones and drinks; children running around with helium baloons and face paint; games and a rock climbing wall; and live entertainment.  What a blessing to see a model of Christ's love exhibited through the fellowship of this body of believers.  2)  Being in Baltimore filled me with so much life.  I shared a lot about myself and heard much about what everyone was going through.  Hearing their experiences, as well as sharing to so many people opened up many new perspectives of things I'm living through.  For example, although I'm so intent on changing myself for the better, I was posed a challenging thought;  how much am I intent on knowing God?  The only source of change and growth is Him, and if I'm looking to myself to change my bad habits, I'm looking at utter futility.  Furthermore, the issue of fear in life came up.  We all live in fear, and have learned to turn to different saviors to fight it.  We can turn to extreme self-confidence, to a charismatic figure in our lives, to the comfort of routine, and many other things to cope with fear.  But have we, have I turned and called for the real Savior to remove fear of man, fear of failure, fear of uncertainty, and fear of confrontation?  Jesus, save me.

      After a week and a half of dealing with endless searching and pushy car salesmen, I finally got a  urlLink car  today.  God was very gracious in leading me to this deal; in terms of financing, I'll only pay $207 a month for 4 years after the downpayment.  It's a certified 2000 Acura Integra LS.  I simply need to get the insurance and install an alarm system, and I'm set.  I'll be on the road with it starting Monday!  What a sigh of relief.  I just hope this won't get stolen or maimed over the next couple of years.  God, thank you for supplying me with a reliable mode of transportation.

      I am the product of all over which I don't have control.  I never controlled my birth, my upbringing, my admission into college, my excrutiating post-college experience, nor the rejection of every girl I've tried to pursue.  I was able to influence some of these things, but these decisions were absolutely made outside of me.  These are the things that have shaped me to become what I am, and what I will become in the future.  I can't control reality to tell me what job I can get, what favor people have or don't have of me.  I can only posture myself to influence these things.  Yet, my need for control deeply informs my actions and psyche.  Although I have tricked myself in the past to believe that I am in control, this past year has taught me otherwise.  I couldn't get myself to study and to work for my professor.  I couldn't extract myself from my state of misery.  I couldn't stop my lifestyle of late nights, late mornings, and days misspent on TV and the internet.  I couldn't figure out why I couldn't decide upon what I want to do in life; I still can't.  Essentially, looking at this past year and all of my actions since childhood, my life up until this point can be summed up with three words:  fear controlled me.  Fear of man, fear of failure, fear of death, and fear of uncertainty have all been my masters.  When have I ever truly had a fear of God?  When has this fear of God caused me to obey Him?  Can I truly learn to fear God?  Can man truly learn to fear Someone that he cannot see, hear, smell, or touch?  Can a man fear someone that speaks to Him solely through words unchanged for millenia?

      This entire downloading issue is really annoying.  Yes, file sharing has hurt the industry, but they've had three years to adjust and come up with a solution that's better than, "let's start suing our potential customers and scare them into submission."  The best one so far is Apple's iTunes; why don't they offer similar cheap, legal, reasonable, and well-administered music services to the general public?  No es bueno.  They've turned the greatest tool for music exposure into a ticket for shame and guilt.  Why do Americans in power love to "shock and awe" their adversaries to get them to do what they want?   urlLink Here's a cartoon about the issue.

      For the past couple of days, I've been searching for a car to buy.  I can't function well in New Jersey without one, and I need a financial kick in the pants to get me aggressively searching for a job.  God, please guide me during this time, give me the mental and spiritual strength to venture out into society in full stride.   Gonna dig my heels into the ground, Gonna dig my heels into the ground. Gonna dig my heels into the ground, And get myself a job in town.   What do I truly want to do in life?  I have asked myself and God that question, and I keep telling myself that I want to get into recording music, or to become an audio engineer in some company.  But is that what I really want to do?  Will that truly become my career endeavor?  Does it matter?  Do we ever truly know and will we ever truly be satisfied with what we "should be doing?"  Doesn't the true importance lie in what we should be doing now, in being faithful with today's tasks?  I'm again reminded of my conversation with my friend a week ago.  He asked me, how much have I called for the real Savior to rescue me letting my fears in life control me?  They're the fears of:  man's opinion, failure, uncertainty, confrontation, having no control, being incorrect, not having things the way I expect them to be.  Jesus, please me save me again, for the first time.

      Last night I rented Godfather I and II.  I watched Part I last night, and Part II this afternoon.  My mind really is atrophying... it's having a harder time than usual understanding anything complex.  Movies, technical explanations, and conversations have been making my head spin more each day.  Time to gird up these boots and hike up the mountain.  I can't afford to slip anymore.

      "Friday night I'm going nowhere All the lights are changing green to red Turning over TV stations Situations running through my head Well looking back through time You know it's clear that I've been blind I've been a fool To ever open up my heart To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule..."  — David Gray, first verse of "Babylon," off his album  White Ladder   Man, what a lyric.  I've been getting into David Gray's songs recently.  I don't like his album arrangements, but the songs themselves are incredibly poignant.

      God, why do I always live in a mental prison?  Why has it been so long, why do I live under this curse?  Why can't I face the world with aplomb?  Why do I have to take after my role models by having a myopic outlook in life and by listening to every self-doubt and lazy whim?  My chest simultaneously implodes and explodes as reminders of self-deficiency take over.  What do I have to answer for my gifts?  They are all underdeveloped, unfocused, crippled by laziness.  After this year of bruising and crushing, I lie staring at the ceiling and fall asleep.  My mouth is pleading for salvation.

      I have a lot of anger still pent up inside, and when it surfaces, I don't know what to do with it.  I don't want to act out on it and face undesirable consequences.  Yet, I still just want to "break stuff," as goes the sophomoric song by the sophmoric band Limp Bizkit.  Movies like Punch Drunk Love depict this feeling well:  pent up aggression due to uncontrollable circumstances.  Time to lie down on my bed, stare at the ceiling, and fall asleep as I silently mouth out all the things I need to yell.

      In relation to my last post, I wonder why I was and would be miserable if I had to work in a job that sucked the life out of me, that had me perform tasks for which I had no interest.  I mean, shouldn't my joy in serving the Lord faithfully in those contexts supercede the dreariness of these jobs?  Why can't I just be "responsible" and find a job anyway?  Gosh, am not I being immature?  Am I not shirking my responsibilties as a grown adult?  Shouldn't I force myself to, or shouldn't I just naturally enjoy whatever nine to five job comes my way?  Isn't that the  responsible  and  mature  thing to do?  Isn't this the dilemma of the rich, of the priveliged?

      1) I need a job to pay the bills.  2) I don't want a job that sucks the life out of me.  3) A job that is a culmination of my interests is a big plus.  The problem with all these is that I love music and engineering, and want a job that combines my background in both of these areas.  I haven't developed enough of a philosophy or a plausible research interest, but I'd like to.  So, the reader may ask, why is my desire for a job in these areas a problem?  First, there are few places out there;  where are they?  I don't know.  Second, I don't have much of the experience and background and the knowledge that these places want.  God, please, provide! Thank you.  There are many many opportunities for people of my background, ie in biomedical engineering (henceforth referred to as BME).  But I have no passion for it!  If I try to get a position in this field, then what?  I can't spend any time on my real passions in life.  I will be miserable again, just like I was last year.  So, here's the dilemma:  even if I got a job that utilized my BME and will further my BME background, I'd be miserable.  And I can't seem to find a job that combines music and technology, so that would make me miserable because I'd be in debt.  Then, if I find a job that pays the bills that utilized neither my background nor my passion, then, well, I'd be miserable.  God gave me this artistic/creative side that is screaming to be trained, refined, and used.  Yet, must I bypass it in order to pay the bills?  Why can't my interests shift towards science, and fully pursue it?  That would be not only a lucrative, but rewarding field if I had a true passion for it.  But, I don't.  Ah, and so, I'm still without career.  I tutor and I'll be teaching for Kaplan, but I have no career, no real platform into which I should focus my ministry and life.  And the rent, phone, car payments, and food bills are still demanding to be paid.  I mean, at least I don't have a family of my own for which I must provide.  For that, I am grateful that God's not placed me in that position yet; I would have been one frustrated man, and they would have been one unhappy family.  I guess this is what people mean by facing "the real life."

      Short post today.  I think my calling will combine music and engineering.  Man, that would be an exciting life, to just develop and cogitate and glorify God with whatever comes out.  ****  I realized that I don't have ADD, as I sometimes wondered.  Simply, I watched too much TV and played too many video games while growing up.   Seeing myself for this past year, a lot of my issues stem from mental laziness, not other things.  TV and video games trained my mind to let things entertain it.  It never truly learned what it meant to consistently study for days, weeks, months, years.  I just wanted to sleep when I wanted, wake when I wanted, and moped around instead of living life.  Now, life is picking up again, and I'm praying, wondering, pondering, trying to take the next step into my life with God in the real world.  Jesus, show me Your will, and let me follow with my all my joy.

      What drivel.  What drivel.  I've gotten through another day, another way to say He's real.  Something tickles me when I hear the music, but with God, why can't my heart feel?  My dad woke me up unexpected and early (for me) to set up the PA system at church.  I'm the only one in the church that really understands the sound system, so I bumbled for my car keys, rubbed my eyes, and took off for church.  After I got back, I went online for a bit and washed up.  I drove down to Springfield, picked up a replacement drum hoop from Guitar Center, tried out guitar pedals, came back, waited at home, called a couple people that never call me back with the hope that they'd either pick up or get the message (none picked up, and I guess none will call back, again), set up the guitar stand I bought, went back to church and put the PA system away, ate out with the pastors from the presbytery, picked up a friend that needed a ride somewhere, went online until 4 AM.  Woke up today at 1:30 PM.  What a day.  My mind is further atrophying, my thoughts progressively have become underdeveloped.  My mind and body have been lazy, and I need to exercise both.  Ok, time to prepare for today's tutoring session.  Please pray that I would also stay focused today with all my time to accomplish all the things I have to get done.

       Late Night Confessions of the Melancholy   It's Sunday twilight, Monday morn'.  I'm up trying to make a vocab test for the kids that I tutor, but after staring at the screen for a while I realize that my creativity is shot at the moment.  I have to write another entry, there's too much going on in my mind.  It's been over an year since my heart finally imploded.  It was the culmination of so many things that had happened up until that point, and it took one final event to push me over to the edge.  Needless to say, it's already been a year, and I'm still trying to heal.  How could I let everything get to me?  I gave into all the temptations to be lazy, to quit even attempting to go at it in life, but all that come out of it was burnout and dropping out of graduate school.  Here I am, a prideful, selfish, lazy young man that lost his way.  I've tried to get myself back on track, but the track's blown apart, and there's no Superman to fill in the hole and let the train run safely.  Or is there?  Most of my peers are well on their ways to becoming lawyers and doctors, entering the workforce, and fighting through grad school.  They are the culmination of their parents' dreams; all the pressure, all the expectations have begun to come into fruition as they build their personal strongholds in society.  But me?  I washed out.  I've been tutoring have trained to teach Kaplan SAT classes in order to sustain myself as I try to come to grips with myself as a person, as I search for my desire and calling in life.  Statements ring in my head:   Remember the Creator the days of your youth; the conclusion, when all has been heard, is to fear God and keep His commandments, this applies to every person;  Love the Lord Your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength.   God, I've tried to run away from these statements with my actions, but He won't let them die in my mind.  How does my calling come into place?  How do I follow these statements?  Every day I awake, and go through the daily routine of "what has to be done."  During these times, I'm conscious of God, talking to Him, thinking about Him.  But is that it?  Is that it?  Why am I still so lost, so confused, so unsatisfied with myself, and therefore finding reasons to be unsatisfied with everything around me?  Why do I have such a hard time pursuing Jesus?  I think of  urlLink John 15 .  Why still the disconnect?  I can't help escape this feeling that I'm never where I should be.  This sensation has filled me all of my life, but never has it hit so hard until the past couple of years.   Is this it?  Am I destined to constantly daydream but never dream hard and pursue accordingly?  Is that all I'll ever be?  Am I destined to be constantly enslaved by the current distraction that takes my fancy?

      Now, happybear and deliriou5?, I shall try to address your questions.  "What's got your brain all tied up, mr.tim?/So who is this girl?  No relationship or girl trouble has happened in my corner;  the past posts were in response to trying to figure out something that I talked about with a female friend.  Well more like, I was trying to figure out what she tried to explain to me, as I tried to take mental notes.  My head was tilted, my eyes looking up as the mind was working and churning to understand her perspective.  I gotta figure out SOME way to treat the women in my life/future well.  Fine fine, I admit right now, it's just me mum.  ****  Now, as for what's been bugging me these days, the same frustrating thoughts have been entering.  I'm 23 years old, and I feel like I'm going nowhere with my life.  People say, "You're young!  Lighten up!  Viva la vida loca! You're too hard on yourself!"  And I agree, I can be hard on myself.  But these days, it's a bit deeper than that.  My relationship with Christ has been rocky for the past two years, because I just didn't try to fulfill my thirst for life with knowing Him.  I guess that's where that post about the marriage analogy came in.  I've been hit in my soul with passages like John 15:5, the book of Romans, and the book of Matthew.  I recall to mind phrases like "You have forsaken your first love," "God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to His purpose,"  "Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your soul,"  "Remember the Creator in the days of your youth,"  "The conclusion, when all has been heard, is to fear God and keep His commandments,"  "trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight," and of course, "love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your mind, all your soul, all your strength."  They pummel at my "cheatin' heart"  that has fallen "out of love" with God.  Thankfully, I'll never fall out of His grace, and with that promise alone He's sustained me and proved to me that He is the author/perfector of my faith.  But, I've habitually distracted myself with so many things throughout my teen and college years that they've laid claim on my attention span, on my lack of time management ability, and on any sense of direction in life.  I've lived the same wastrel late night/late morning ritual since second semester senior year, and I have to get out.  This is beyond beyond being "hard on myself,"  because that was mere frustration without direction.  Now, I'm in the process of getting out, but it isn't as frustrating as it is confusing.  I left grad school partially because I had no assurance in my heart that biomedical engineering was my future career.  I wanted to be in music!  I wanted to be artistic!  I feel like I've duped myself over the past couple of years into thinking that I can be a musician, a real professional performer, a real multimedia artist in this multimedia age.  It's a long time coming, but I'm finally admitting —and hurting my ego in the process— that I don't have any special talent that stands out, enough to make my living off of performance and recording.  Furthermore, I figured, since I have passion for these things, I'll pursue them accordingly.  What naivete, for I still ended up browsing the web for useless information,  browsing the channel for useless stimulation, browsing the music for useless pinings to BE a similar creator of music.  But did I practice for any real goal?  And when I have musical responsibilities and goals that ARE in sight, have I truly worked hard to prepare myself?  No, and that absence of action pointed me to say that it's not simply a matter of motivation, it's also a matter of an undisciplined mind and heart that has gotten all that it's wanted and never learned how to provide for itself.  And so I face myself in this time, and I turn to the path ahead of me.  I find that it isn't a path, it's road so wide and long that it's a desert:  flat, omnidirectional, barren, unyielding of any clues to the next destination in life.  I have a guide leading the way, but sometimes the wind burns my eyes.  Sometimes the pretty ladies and videogames and, to ruin the analogy, promises of instant emotional gratification convince me to pause and ignore the guide.  To peel myself away To peel myself away My destination's telling me To peel myself away.  I don't know where I'm going I don't know where I'm going Promises of blessing, but I just Don't know where I'm going.  My guide says He'll take me there My guide says He'll take me there I'll take His word for it My guide says He'll take me there

      In the previous post, I highlighted a humorous—at least, I found it to be funny— aspect of tonight, and in this one I will try to divulge more meaningful ruminations.  I guess the main point that I took from the conversation was that women want their men to characteristically have them in their thoughts, concerns, and consciousness.  In a way, they want the men to have their hearts remain in them.  It brought me back to my current meditations on what it means to "remain in Jesus."  For those that come to initially come to know Him, there is an initial period of emotional hype; romance with Christ is easy.  But the sense of long-term commitment starts bearing itself as time wears on, and soon their feelings subside.  They start thinking about other things again; they start turning to other "cares of this world" for fulfillment, or simply get caught up in the fear of survival.  They forget the great joy in knowing Christ and distract themselves with the thrill of sex, the excitement of modern enterainment, the rush from physical sports, the comfort of  luxury .  But, if they'd truly come to know Christ, He confronts them at every turn.  "Where are you? I don't hear from you anymore.  You've lost your first love.  What am I to you now?"  Their hearts race, and they realize their mistake.  They cry, "what must we do," and Christ says, "Let go of everything and follow me."  They sulk, crestfallen, for their true desire is revealed:  the ephemeral, instant, flashy pleasure promised by their habits.  They've missed the point.  Christ seems to really mean, "Give me your heart again, give me your heart again, remain in me.  Revive the old love, bring the excitement back.  FIGHT FOR IT.  It is not immature, it is sweet, genuine, and pure.  It is simple, and it is foundational."  They learn from the experience, and a cycle develops: abide, forget, abide, forget, abide, forget.  It is a rough process, and many times they wonder if it was ever right to begin with.  But they press on, and stay focused on constantly renewing their love for Jesus.  I guess this scenario directly mirrors successful marriage relationships.  Case in point, maybe that's why God cares so much about strong marriages.  Marriages become a direct indicator of our abilitiy and our passion to maintain a committed, constantly fresh romance with a person.  Lord, Lord, I am so clueless about how to love someone or something for such a long period of time.  But you are the first, and only object of any love I've ever had for anything; establish your love in me.  Sincerely,  Tim

      From online conversations tonight:  "Female friend 1: coo... yeah, i feel for you men Female friend1: haha Me: thanks Me: thanks Me: :-P Female friend 1: women aren't the easiest creatures to deal with"  Goodness, at least one of you women understand that.  Lord, Lord, have mercy.  So, basically, that interchange was in response to the confusion I expressed over something I had talked about with a friend during dinner tonight.  She explained a certain nuance about what females tend to expect from males; at least, she tried to explain but I'm not sure if I FULLY got it.  Augh, basically, from that, I reasoned, "women expect men to think like women in the way they relate with women."  Now, I was wondering, why don't women try to think like men to understand that men think like MEN, not women?  But, I nodded and agreed, because from personal experience, I can see that to simply be the way things are.  "Me: my head is spinning Me: augh, women! Me: women... so confusing. :-P Female Friend 2: sorry, we do that a lot Me: and i THINK i understand, but it was just a very complex convo Female Friend 2: haha dont try Me: yet, it's like, women expect us to understand Me: when i have a feeling that THEY don't really understand either Me: so, i just give up :-P Female Friend 2: good choice ;-)"  Ah, another glimmer of hope.  "Female friend 1: but we're doin our best Female friend 1: haha :-)"  I hope so, I hope so.

      I just had the oddest dream last night.  It's sorta PG.  I dreamt that I was going to meet a friend for dinner at this tourist attraction cafe situated on an 19th century sailboat.  All of the visitors had to climb a ladder and squeeze through a trapdoor to get to the deck.  As we sat down at our table, I noticed another guy across the room staring at us.  Then, another college friend of mine, that happened to be eating at the same restaurant, waved to me from his table.  Next thing I know, the girl and I were liplocked.  It caught me by surprise, and I was thoroughly confused; I didn't know that we were in love with each other.  In the middle of the kiss, her cellphone rang.  "Hello?"  She cocked her head when she heard the voice, and quickly turned towards the window.  Her eyes widened in excitement, and she rapidly got up.  "Sorry!  Something really important, I have to go now!"  Before I could get a word in, she had already rushed off.  The guy staring at us glared at her when she left; he walked over to me.  We both watched her run to a sporty coupe that had pulled up, engage in a passionate, lengthy kiss with the guy through his window, and speed off with him.  My college friend, the glaring guy, and I piled into the bus to take us back to the city.  Incidentally, the girl had asked to meet with glaring guy at that restaurant at the same time she had asked to meet with me.  During the ride we shared with the rest of the bus our story, and everyone nodded in sympathy.  The end.

      I've been repeating a message cd in my car lately.  The insights inside it have churned my mind and heart around, and now I'm talking, now I'm wondering instead of brooding and fretting.  Wishful Thinking still needs work, but I still can't come up with any lyrics.  I am thinking about instilling a more disciplined daily regimen.  Because I know that God wants to teach me things, I have the understanding that it will take daily training to get there.  Yes, I'm purposefully being vague.

      Faith that God will provide in the future rests upon the proof that He has provided in the past.  And, I guess, that means that I really haven't believed what He's provided in the past, namely Christ Himself, to be as truth.  Mental familiarity and mental assent, I'm realizing, are two very different things.  It is at this point that I realize that I need to really come to grips with the truth of my standing in Christ, and with the truth of His promise that "if [I] remain in [him] and [his] words remain in [me], ask whatever [I] wish, and it will be given [me]."  God, grant this assurance of Your goodness to this feeble heart.  It is not passionate enough for a contented and satisfied life.

      I want to hurl.  I haven't been in my apartment for a while, but I heard that there's a problem with flies.  My roommates couldn't figure out where they're breeding.  I just found it.  I decided to fix my breakfast today by reheating some cold chicken and getting some rice.  I took the chicken out, cut off a thigh/leg section, and set it in the microwave, and turned to the rice cooker.  When I opened it, a fetid odor wafted into my face, and I took a step back from surprise.  Maggots and eggs lined the cooker, to the extent that it looked like someone sloppily smeared rice all over the pot.  Hurl.

      Renewed hope met an unchanged lifestyle, and now I'm picking the pieces up again.  I can't fall asleep at night and I can't wake up early, and I keep missing deadlines for resume submissions for interviews and whatnot.  I still don't have my act together, I guess.  Six months to do this and I've merely wallowed around in the muck.  I have to get out, I must.  It's just going to take more than anything I have, and I guess that's why it has been so difficult.

      Today, I had a list of things to do, but I didn't get everything done.  I got distracted by  Wallace and Gromit, Vertigo, The School of Rock , and  The French Connection .  Wallace and Gromit:  Awesome stuff, nuff said.  Vertigo:  Was a bit slow at times, but still enjoyed it.  The mature issues were kinda surprising to me.  I guess I am a bit naive in regards to how I viewed movies at the time.  The School of Rock:  sweet, hysterical movie with Jack Black.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  The French Connection:  I remembered seeing parts of this on TV while growing up, but it never caught my attention.  The film quality looked too old and in the 4:3 TV aspect ratio, it looked like a typical TV movie.  But recently I'd run into it and noticed that it won a large amount of Oscars, so I decided to check it out.  Needless to say, the DVD restoration was top notch; the film and sound quality were pristine, and the widescreen format made it more apparent that I was watching a movie.  That said, the movie itself was fast paced and exciting, and the ending was an unresolved ending, similar to many other movies of the time.  Another thing that hit me was the locale.  Deliriou5, you'll love this next bit.  It took place in New York, and I found myself recognizing much of the locale;  that actually helped me follow the geographical progression of the movie.  One image that struck me most was one of lower Manhattan, because one could see the Twin Towers in mid-construction.  What an irony to see life during that time, to only know what would happen exactly 30 years after the movie came out.  Yes, it's a bit of irony, tinged with a bit of melancholy and futility of man's dreams.  The other image that struck was of the tollbooths of the time.  Particularly, the flashing neon arrows pointing to the toll basket caught my attention.  Does anyone that grew up in the 70s or 80s remember those?  They didn't change for another 15 years, at least, because I remember seeing the exact same kinds of arrows from the backseat of the family car.  I always wanted to be the one to throw the change into the toll basket;  I never missed.  :-)  However, once when getting a ticket for the turnpike, I remember dropping it to my dad's annoyance.  He grunted, got out of the car, and fumbled around for it.  He'd give me a cross look, get back behind the wheel, and put the pedal to the metal to escape any more embarrassment from the rest of the waiting cars.  I quietly sat and looked down at the station wagon floor, and lightly kicked my feet.

      Essentially, in the face of the anxieties of life, we are faced with some options.  First, we can cower in fear and let fear consume us.  Second, we can face them with a hope in the "indomitable human spirit."  Third, we can face them with many other world philosophies.  Fourth, we can face them "with prayer and petition, with thanksgiving," presenting these issues to God.  My mind and heart have looked at all these anxieties for so long, but now, I keep hearing, "Trust in the Lord with all Your heart, and lean not on your own understanding."  I guess He's leading me to pursue option Four.  Let's see what He'll do.

      My mind is constantly bombarded with thoughts that point out my failures and deficiences.  For example, after I go out to dinner with a friend, or after I see people at church, my mind instantly remembers all the mistakes I made in the conversation.  It remembers all the times I cut people off and HAD to say something.  It remembers all the times I sensed I embarrassed someone or made an insensitive comment.  It remembers all of the times I've talked so much that the person just glazes over and starts wondering if he or she remembered to turn the iron off.  I then proceed to try to fix all of these mistakes I've made by reconciling with the offended parties, but ninety percent of the time the offense isn't even remembered.  As another example, I cite my extreme self-criticism when I make music, when I prepare for praise on Sundays.  I constantly hear in my mind, "This is crap!" or "Tim, you suck at this.  Why even bother?"  It makes it extremely difficult to focus on a certain idea to practice, on getting my preparation finished.  I can cite so many other areas of my life, but I'm sure these two examples explain well enough that in everything I do, in every person that I meet, in every thing that I say, I can count on a severely critical thought to torture me for "messing it up."  Where I will go from here, I am not sure.  These days, though, God has been reminding me, in my heart, that it's ok not to be sure where I am to go from here.  He's been saying that He just wants me to be sure that HE has ordained the right destination, and HE will bring me there.  Instantly those aforementioned critical thoughts arise, but I'm tired of listening to them.  They've brought nothing but misery and this melancholic daze I call life today.  What a temptation it is to listen to these thoughts out of habit, and what a temptation it is to turn to so many other things to deal with the anxiety of life.  But it's at this place that He's saying, "Hey, I have the most to offer.  Come to me."  God, help me to take your word for it, to  believe .

      Have you ever had to face the fact that you were absolutely wrong about something?

No, I won't be afraid, just as long as you stand by me." — Ben E. King  God, make this anthem so real in my mind that all the storms in my mind subside into light summer breezes.

      I rode another train of thought that day:  man, I really need to get out more .  I found myself blurting out more incompleted thoughts than usual, tactlessly adding my opinions into conversations, and generally thinking about myself much more than those around me.  I wasn't and I'm not necessarily down on myself; it simply served to show me that I simply haven't been spending enough time with peers.  Without such constant social feedback, it becomes easier for a person to become self-involved and inconsiderate.  Man, I really do need to get a job.  I really do need to get myself oh-wt and aboh-wt, as our friendly Canadians say.  But what do I  really  need?  It's times like these that make me wish that I could just have the cash to settle my debts and travel to Europe.

      What next, fish rights?   urlLink Click to read .  ****  The trip to Six Flags, as well as dinner that evening had my mind abuzz with thoughts.  This one thought that struck me after our last rollercoaster kept swirling around.  There seem to be three categories of people that follow rules, laws, and regulations.  We label sticklers to these laws "goody two-shoes," breakers of these laws "rebels," and ignorers of the law "anarchists."   Especially when dealing with God and His laws, we love to make them into constructs of restriction, badges of honor and righteousness.  But Christ seemed to be different; to do the will of the Lord was the very food that He ate.  Was He being a "goody two-shoe?" No, because His obedience wasn't a badge of Honor.  I think I see it as this.  He knew God to be utterly trustworthy and faithful, so He understood that the Law, the rules were designed to bring the best life possible, even if difficult to follow in the outset, even if they seemed to fly in the face of human nature.  He knew that His obedience would surely set the stage for even more glorious things to come; not due to merit, but simply due to God's promise that they would.  I am not sure if I thought this all through well, but I was thinking, then,  maybe this is what God means by delighting in His law .  Maybe it's a deep sense of trust in God, that He is as trustworthy and just and loving as He says that He is, that would drive one to say, "I trust, and will do what You say, because You're going to keep your Promise."  Maybe that's what Christ was getting at in John 15?

      "Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'" — Shawshank Redemption  I'm usually circumspect of the dangers in finding wisdom in pop culture, but this quote really did hit a chord in me today.  I've been busier dyin' than livin'.  I can't function like a normal person, it feels like I'm play acting survival.  All I really see are plates spinning in the air without my help, with most of them already falling to the ground.    What makes it this way?  I don't know how to explain this, but my mind is just overloaded with too many thoughts.  My mind is glutted with so many thoughts, worries, concerns, and I can't turn them off.  And underlying everything, since the dawn of my memories, stands a fear of life that controls the puppet strings of my actions.  I'm wondering if I really am a spineless, scared man that can't think for his own.  So, I try to fight, I try to recognize the reality of God's sovereignty.  It's at this point I realize that my problems seem to stem from an absolute lack of sight upon God.  The Gospel of Jesus doesn't do anything for my heart.  The concept of love is alien to this stone weight that resides in my chest.  I pray to Jesus, asking Him to be my fountain of life.  He said to drink, so here I am.  What does it mean to drink?   What is the action of drinking the water of Jesus?  Do I stand outside and open up my mouth?  Do I sit in a yoga position, empty my thoughts, and wait for something mystical to occur?  Do I go out and serve the poor, do I just go on with my daily routine?  Do I do nothing and watch the sparks fly?  Do I really know what it means to love, to adopt someone else' welfare as my own?  Why can't I submit resumes on time and get interviews like any normal person?  Why can't I just shut everything off?  I want to be mindless for once, but it all rushes in from all sides.  Who said life is about being simple?  Where is this simplicity, when existence is so complicated, so inexplicable?  Where is it, when things never turn out the way desired, where things progress beyond expectations good or bad?

      ARGH!  LORD, why do you have such obtuse servants? WHY?!        urlLink Click here to see the reason for my outburst .   urlLink Read this link in response .  Now, I must admit, ok, so their intentions are good, and they've invested too much of their lives into it; their careers, their jobs, their families thrive upon putting out material that educates children about the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  And at that point, I am supportive of their job, of their lives.  Pastor Soong Chan's points are good and I agree, but I find a bit too emotionally based.  What passage was it in the Bible, in which epistle did Paul write that even if the Gospel was preached for the wrong means, he is still glad that the gospel is nonetheless being preached?  Even if the material is absolutely ridiculous, if the gospel is at least in there somewhere, and some kid gets it due to the program, all is not lost.  However, something still has to be done.  I harbor the same sentiment espoused by Pastor Soong Chan in his FAQ; maybe not to the degree that he does, because his children drives the point home even deeper for him.  But due to memories growing up as a child in racist environments, the idiotic stereotypes will make any Asian American burn inside.  Every single Asian friend I've shown the site instantly found it racist, either in a funny or distressing way.  The music and the promotional videos would leave the sickest feeling in any Asian American's stomach; I wish these people can understand that, but they didn't consult a single Asian american in their research process.  They must understand that it's still wrong to present the Gospel in this manner.  These people have to understand the reality and ramifications of their error; do they want to perpetuate notions that God's children are narrowminded, insensitive, and ignorant?  Do they want to perpetuate ignorant, unintended racism in the country?  Lord, have mercy!  If these people are going to understand their wrongdoing, they have to be admonished/informed in a respectable, Christlike manner.  How can we, the scant minority of this country, get the majority to understand this?  How can they come to understand that they shouldn't use common media stereotypes to illustrate their points?  I hope that after this year (there's no way they could recall everything, this project of theirs is too big) they start focusing on some other ways to reach children.

      Dear Readers,  You know how Korean immigrants or Korean nationals love to say that they're the best, with statements like, "Koreans are numba wan! Best in world!", with their thumbs up and whatnot?  Well, my college friends and I have this constantly running inside joke about it:  you can't be a true Korean unless you have a big thumbs up and declare yourself to be the utmost pinnacle in what you do, without any proof save for your uttermost belief that it's true.  We've been finding korean businesses from all over that illustrate this point.  It's businesses like these that provided the fodder for our observation in the first place.  Check these two pictures out.  I scanned them of two ads my friend found:       MIND YOU, they are the best EVER.  None in existence in the past, nor the future, will surpass this company! :-)       This advertisement is the archetype to understand everything about this phenomenon.  For you non-Korean readers, most examples of the Korean script are direct, English sound translations.  The bold banner on top reads, "Beh-seu-teu Moh-Gee-Jee," or "Best Mortgage." The highly stretched,  earnest  thumb, as well as the thumbs-up logo itself, and the bold proclamation of "BEST" demonstrate the essence of this fine art.  Also note how they make the top part of the black bar tangent to the uppermost part of the thumb.  What else could   Gotta love our roots.  If any of you make a sighting, please scan or take a picture of the ad and send them to me.  *sticking thumb up* "BEST!"

It felt like I never left, even with the new buildings and whatnot.  ****  I'm trying to pull myself together.  I think the better way to understand it is, God is pulling me together.  What suffering is this?  How could I ever call this suffering?  This experience is sickening me, how I could call it suffering in the absolute scale of things.  But in my myopic vision, it's the pits.  Open these eyes to see the painting, not the brush stroke.

It was Friday morning, the morning I was to leave for Baltimore for my first extended trip with my new car.  After packing some things, I brought my guitar out to the front door.  Mom handed me a toasted bagel in a napkin and a can of Nestea.  Stepping into the car, I noticed that my dad had filled the tank.  I knew he didn't make note of in the logbook, so I had to drive the station and back to see how many miles he had driven that morning, in order to correctly calculate the gas mileage.  30.1 miles per gallon.  40 minutes later, I pulled into my apartment parking lot.  After taking a shower, I packed my things, burned a cd, grabbed the strat, and took off for Baltimore.

      My brothers, a friend, and I will go see the Matrix in the Loews Imax Theater at 68th and Broadway.  Ah, at $15, expensive tickets they are.  But it should be worth the show.  But wait a minute.  The hiking fee last weekend was $15.  Which would be more worth the money?  Anyhow, here are some hiking pictures:               More to come later, as I will post them on  urlLink my picture server .

      I went to a career fair today in Times Square.  I woke up in a crabby mood.  My haircut didn't look so well, and I had a sour attitude with my parents.  The hotel was said to be on Broadway in Times Square, but I couldn't find it.  After asking around, I realized I had missed it and had to go on 45th or 44th to enter it.  No wonder I couldn't find it.  It was a small job fair, but I was able to have some good conversations with some of the companies there.  Memorial Sloan-Kettering and Kaplan seemed to be the most receptive and interesting.  John, no comments about me loving NY, please.  :-D

      I screamed my anger out on Sunday, with the realization that a deep dissatisfaction drives my existence.  After the past couple of days, further events have given rise to some more startling realizations.  I'm not that pleasant a person to be around these days, especially in public.  I'm hard-nosed and serious, distrustful and fake.  Maybe that's the objective truth, maybe it isn't.  Today all the anger struck out again, even though last night I encountered a ray of hope, a tunnel of escape.  I thought I took it, but on the other end was more anger and frustration.  Due to insomnia, I stayed up channel surfing to find "The Breakfast Club" playing, the Ronco Rotisserie that tells me to "set it and forget it!", and Louis Farrakhan interviewing Ja Rule about his beef with 50 Cent.   Why am I up again during a late night, doing nothing but watch junk food for pop junkies like me?   I had so many things to do today, but when I faced them, my chest deflated with each sigh.  Anger resurfaced concerning the car issue, and now I just can't control it again.  To channel it out I smashed a wooden totem statue that my brother brought from New Mexico a couple of years ago.   There lies a strong desire to destroy whatever I see within me, and it's making me angrier.    I gave my dad a hard time about taking the car to a Korean auto body shop.  He got mad, but he responded by ironing my suit and washing my shirt for the job fair tomorrow.  What kind of son am I?  Why am I so dissatisfied with life?  Even if I find a job, honestly I'll still be dissatisfied.  What then, what next?  God, why can't I find solace and satisfaction in You?  I just want to sleep and escape.  Unfortunately, that's all I've done, and it seems like I never left.  I need air, God, I need air.

      I got into my first car accident tonight while on my way to dinner.  I braked to turn onto the highway, but instead of turning the car kept going.  The front left tire slammed into the curb.  I was still able to drive but the alignment was severely knocked out of place.  After grinding off the next exit to the nearest gas station, I called the person I was meeting for dinner to cancel.  I contacted Acura Roadside Assistance, since it was free towing.  We'll see what happens tomorrow.  The tires have been skidding all month, since I got the car.  The guy at the service station last Friday advised me to replace them before winter, and I agreed.  I KNEW that the tires weren't grabbing; earlier today I hit the accelerator to get onto a highway, but the tires skid for a couple of seconds until they grabbed the road.  How retarded I am.  I take turns quickly because I love the slide, but I always knew that I was being stupid.  I keep telling myself, "The road is not a race track!"  And so, look where it got me.  I am not saying I was driving overly recklessly.  The car wasn't going too fast, and if it was normal conditions I would have been perfectly safe.  But the rain, combined with the worn tires, decided otherwise.  I have a lot to learn from this night.

      "John Reilly"  A friend of mine gave me a CD, so I thought that I'd give my review.  Before I do, I'll talk a bit about the artist in question.  I've known  urlLink John Reilly  for three years, but I've only met and talked with him twice.  The first time I met him, I listened to an old tape demo while talking to him on the van ride home from One Day 2000.    The second time I met him took place at a CD release concert for  urlLink Neah Lee  last June.  Again I heard a snippet of his music, this time live as he gave an impromptu mini-concert for some friends and I amidst the post-concert hubbub.  As I talked with him and experienced his music, it was evident that he is a true, raw talent waiting to develop and burgeon into a prolific juggernaut of soulful, touching music.   In both instances, I found to John to harbor an abounding energy and sweet, outgoing personality.  It is this at this point that the EP succeeds in its purpose to present a raw, honest snippet of this budding talent to the listening public.  I say succeed because the energy and sweetness exudes from this 25 minute piece of musical candy.  As I began to listen to the first track introductory instrumental, I first thought,  what a nice Phil Keaggy-esque guitar medley .  The song made a sudden jump into the main part of the song, a bit too sudden a switch for me.  However, he more than made up for it as his sugary voice entered amidst a Dave Matthews-esque guitar riff.  From that moment forth I kept thinking for the rest of the EP,  man, this sounds very sweet .  I didn't mean it in the slang sense, but in the literal sense.  The arrangements, for the most part, masterfully blend virtuoso solos by guest guitarist Kyung Lee and John's dulcet strums and tunes, creating an end product simply sounding very bright.  Maybe since it's an acoustic album, the high level of treble sounds of the guitars and the pleasant harmonic overtones of John's tenor give that impression.  But the optimistic lyrics, sunny melodies and chordal progressions dash that notion, for the hope expressed within leaves a feeling akin to that of the savory first lick of an ice cream sundae on a warm sunny day.    There are times where he slightly goes off key and the arrangements seem to be a bit forced, but the pros of this album outpace the cons by a lightyear.  This album is a taste of things to come, a dessert before the main course.  If you want to have a taste of the future, get this EP.  Jack Johnson, Chris Martin, Dave Matthews, and John Mayer, move over,  Mr. Reilly is coming in.  I hope he'll stay awhile.

      I went hiking last weekend with a group of friends at  urlLink Mohonk Mountain .  The $15 admission is steep, but the rock scramble is worth it.  ****  There's a lot of aggression and anger that grew inside of me for a long time.  I let it all out last night in a fury and flutter of screams and shouts.  Maybe it was the glass of wine that fully pried off the lid of oppression.  Remind me not to drink alchohol again, I'm already an uninhibited person as is :-).  Oogle boogle.

      Yesterday, I saw Elf.  The movie previews spoiled the funniest jokes in the movie for me, but I loved it.  Even if it had the stereotypical Hollywood plot holes and saccharine turns, seeing Mr. Farrell in an elf suit was a sight gag worth watching for two hours.  This morning I got new tires for the car.  I went to get Dunlop SP 5000's but left with Star Performer tires, a small independent tire maker.  I never heard of this brand, but the guy swore them to be better during the winter than the Dunlop tires.  I was too tired to care at that point so I just decided to take a risk and trust his "33 years of experience."  I went home and submitted the name into Google, but I couldn't get many solid links besides a testing chart from the USDOT.  It got all A ratings, so i'll still try to take the man's word for it.  Afterwards, I went to Jersey City to have lunch with a friend.  That area was a maze, but I was able to get to my destination.  We hung out in Hoboken; it was an overall pleasant afternoon.  The young adult ministry folk in my church had another fellowship time tonight.  We had a wonderful dinner courtesy of my mother's preparations.  My brother and I helped, but she still deserves the credit.  Afterwards the guys and I —the ministry is devoid of any female members, oh well— had a good time of sharing our lives and having a discussion on apologetics.  Hopefully after this semester is done, we'll embark in some good studies of the word.  These experiences supplied much fodder for thought; I hope I can have the strength to pursue what I really should pursue in life.

      On a whim and out of need, I decided to research tires on  urlLink www.tirerack.com .  Oh, what a surprise I encountered.  I looked up my tires, and read these reviews from multiple Integra, Civic, and other car owners:  "These tires are absolutely dangerous when the roads get wet and if there is just an smidgen of snow on the ground you might as well park the car."  "The "All season high performance" tire description certainly does not apply here and constitutes false advertising in my opinion"  "I couldnt wait for these tires to expire."  "Ironically, their quality was good enough to last a long time, but their performance (considering the "Ultra High Performance" moniker) really was questionable - and questions Acuras persistence in having these as stock tires for so long."  "For wet conditions, these tires were downright abismal(sic)"  "As somebody else here said - theyre death donuts."  "I have to take a 35 mph turn at 25 mph to prevent my back end from sliding out and the front end from hydroplaning."  "Based on how this tire handles uneven pavement I will not buy this tire when time come for replacements."  "I didnt even bother taking corners in the rain since I would surely slide. I almost ran into a van because these tires have absolutely no wet traction (and I was driving slowly)."  "Michelin should drop the price of this tire from $135.00 to around $85.00. I dont believe it is worth much more than that."  "Whenever there is a trace of wetness after the rain my Intega is sliding all over the road..."  "Maybe they just are not as good as they used to be but with 30000 miles on them Im ready for some new tires(Not michelin XGTs) "  "However, in the wet they have almost zero cornering traction."  "These things are coming off now! Because they are absolutley horrible in the wet weather, and extremely dangerous in the snow, I have finally decided to get rid of these death trap tires."  "Believe all the other comments about this tire. These things are death-donuts. Wet traction is abysmal."  "If you purchase a car with these tires - get rid of them as soon as you possibly can."  There are many more, but you get the idea.  There were some positive and opposite reviews, but they were scant compared to the overwhelming negative response.  The statistics don't lie.  I definitely was correct about the tires being half of the cause of last week's accident.  The other half was my improper precautions: "They dont have the best traction in the rain, but this isnt a problem if you know how to drive properly."  Touche.  I should have read up on this a while ago!

      Interesting article:   urlLink Does Science Matter ?  You'll need a NY Times account.  It's free, just put in a bogus (but real) email address :-D  An interesting quote from it:  "Polls by the National Science Foundation perennially identify contradictions. Its latest numbers show that 90 percent of adult Americans say they are very or moderately interested in science discoveries. Even so, only half the survey respondents knew that the Earth takes a year to go around the Sun."

      It's Wednesday in the heart of November.  The heart of November, where the branches undress for the winter, where the crisp Winter air knocks at the door, where the spirit of the holidays begins to enter.  I love the feeling that arrives, but not the early sunsets.  I love the feeling that the holidays are near, but not the specter of unemployment.  Oh well, I must keep trudging.

      So, I made my final edits, prayed that last prayer, hit Ctrl-X, then hit Y for "Yes, I want to send the message."  And so it's off.  Even if I don't get a return on this one, even if nothing happens, God's been smacking me upside the head.  Why am I being so conditional about my joy?  Why do I only have joy when things go well for me?  Why do I have so much anger, bitterness, and resentment if they don't?  Is my utmost satisfaction and joy in life really contigent upon knowing God, or is it upon having everything that I think that I want?  I thought that I had answered that question for good, because last year I had almost everything I want.  I was beginning to pursue some potential female interests.  I was in a grad school program set to propel my career in the sciences by PAYING for my education.  I was saving and budgeting my money so that I can comfortably go out with my friends on a regular basis.  I had all that I needed and wanted, or I was on the track to getting what I wanted.  But I was incorrigibly unsatisfied from the start.  I left knowing that all these things shouldn't be the reason for life.  It seemed that my unsatisfaction deepened as a result of not having those things.  But the truth of the matter is, I've never been satisfied because I have had no real motivation, no purpose, no real satisfaction with God and everything I've heard Him promise.  It is to this point that my dissatisfaction has grown.  I ask God more; no, I plead with Him more to supply for me a real purpose that I can enjoy, to which I can set my heart to obsess and train and dream and plan over.  And overall, I plead that He give me something worth fighting my temptations to court dissatisfaction, to complain and to dwell in unhappiness.  Please.

      Concerning job applications:  Man, it's become more apparent to me by what the job advice people mean when they mention showing real interest to a company.  Faking interest is grueling, life-draining, and depressing.  I guess that's why I've been this way for so long; it'd be nice to find a place that really does promise an interesting and productive line of work, as well as a definite means to pay the bills :-D.  Sigh.  Unfortunately, reality isn't always nice.  Well, until today.  I found out that Wiley, maker of all my old textbooks from college, has open entry-level positions.  Yes, THAT Wiley.  Anyhow, us BME's had no academic life other than engineering and science... well, we did, but not THAT much.  I just did another MonsterTrak submission, but I had some things to say about it.  I thought I'd say it to them, so I did.  Well, I'm still working on the email.  I have to admit, this is the third time in the last six months in which I found something really interesting to apply for.  I actually find myself automatically doing, out of desire, all the things that job recruiters advise one to do.  I obssessed over my resume, read about their company through the website, and am writing/re-writing/re-writing my cover letter.  And it's only a half hour commute to Hoboken!  And Hoboken is right next to NY!  And oh, what's this?  There are offices in NY!    All my friends are probably saying that I'm applying for the devil right now, but oh, this seems so sweet.  Who wouldn't want to torture college students with my work, and get paid to do it in the process? :-D  I sure have a short memory for the pain endured then.  Good thing I have a good memory for all the joy.

      "Curses!"  The past month, I've been noticing my thoughts becoming very "potty mouthed."  The curse words actually slipped out many times, during particularly angry moments.  I knew that I was dissatisfied and angry, but not to this point.  Things really are boiling over, it seems.  Curses aside, what's there to do with my anger, Lord, what to do?  What's there to do with dissatisfaction and listlessness, what to do?  My dad tried to cheer me up today as I drove to the airport.  He gave me a post-it note of a verse in two translations:  "When anxiety was great within me,  your consolation brought joy to my soul." - Psalm 94:19 NIV  "When the cares of my heart are many,    your consolations cheer my soul." - Psalm 94:19 NIV  I don't see anything in sight.  I don't even have a vision, a promise of what to expect, besides general statements... sigh.  But I'll think about these, God.

      New music alert:    urlLink The Rapture    I saw the video for their single, "House of Jealous Lovers" on MTV2 Subterranean.  Two things I have to say:  one, Subterranean is the best music show out there, and two, the video was kinda weird but it caught my attention.  They're another band that sounds like they came from the '70s/'80s era of smart-rock, with a very twangy, funky, complex sound.  It sounds like the combination of post-punk bands like Blondie, The Cure, Duran Duran, U2 (War era), The Cure, The Clash, and the music of the 70's.  They layered a dance beat with cowbells, Manchesterj-punk guitars, screaming vocals that I'd hardly classify as singing, and an irresistable tagline.  This is the new music to play at the party, the new music that will annoy old people, the new music that becomes the soundtrack for a breezy Sunday drive.  Catchy!   urlLink Check 'em out at this website .

       The Matrix Revolutions  was just as I suspected.  Light years behind the first movie, it was all flash and bang.  The dialogue was horrendous, and the editing decisions were clearly done to appeal to a more general audience.  I think the focus groups got to "the brothers."  However, I went to see it in IMAX expecting a fun ride, and that's what I got.  I didn't go with the expectation of movie entertainment, I went in expecting a virtual roller coaster.  The 12,000 Watts of high, mids, and LOWS made sure I felt every rumble and every shot of gunfire, and the wraparound screen made sure that I SAW it.  Ah,  the excessiveness, the excessiveness .... (to be uttered in the same way Marlon Brando utters, "The horror... the horror..." in  Apocalypse Now )  ****  In typical fashion, I lost my roll of film last weekend.  It contained the photos from the hiking trip.  Argh.

      Woah.   urlLink Jonathan Brandis is dead .  Bummer.  ****  After years of dealing with the following problem, I fully admit it now.  I am addicted to the media and the internet.  I am addicted to computers, to email, to reading material online, to watching TV and movies.  I actually am admitting it.  It may be amusing to some, but really, it's a problem.  I can't wake up in the morning and avoid the computer; the first impulse I have is to check my email, to chat, to do whatever.  Many times I just go to the computer, turn it on, and wait until I can think of a website to visit.  It became my source of guilt, my mode of distraction that kept me from fully pursuing my studies as student.  All the way since junior year of high school, I have sunk my attention into whatever I could find on the internet; so much time has been wasted.  The frustrating thing about it is, the internet and the computers are things that I still NEED to use, even if it's on a minimal basis.  I need to use email, I need to use it for school or work, I need it to function in this society.  How in the world can I curb my addiction from something that is necessary?  As for TV and movies, I have the same problem.  I get sucked into them so easily that my life passes by in a blink of an eye.  I turned on the TV since coming home from college, and have been watching it during my downtime from my internet addiction.  Go figure.  These addictions form the main roots of all my problems.  They have become the salve for my emptiness, the quick distractions from the unscratchable itch.

      Today I wore myself out tutoring.  Tonight I sifted through all my photos to see what would be good stock photos and design elements for the site redesign.  Sigh.  Amidst my sifting, I found some old photos that brought back some vivid memories of my senior year.  They should have evoked joy and fondness for those times, but my reaction was marred by melancholic undertones.  I saw some friends that I still keep in touch with now, and think of the differences between then and now.  Most of the people in those pictures have graduated and gone on to medical school, the business world, the working professional world, and to graduate school.  Then there are a scant few like me that are unemployed.  We all have doubts about ourselves, but by comparing then and now I see that the uncertainty of life has only intensified.  My heart loves to entertain the despairing thoughts that instantly crop up.  But as I've been listening to this one Piper message repeatedly for the past two months, I've been slowly changing.  He pointed out, through many references, that we really do live by faith.  Do I have truly believe that Jesus is the wellspring of life, the only source of hope, the bread, the purpose, the reason, the truth?  It challenges me, amidst the stormy winds and lighting of unemployment and debt.  It challenges me, amidst the crashing waves and the foreboding night sky of personal imperfections.  It challenges me to look up and within, and say, "Jesus, I believe."  Oh hope, help me follow through.

      Here are some interesting quotes I got from reading an article from  Resonant Magazine .  Here is a link to the online:  urlLink Howard Zinn and Thom Yorke:  Duty of Expression .  "That's what art does-it takes something that is not quite true, it is invented, but it makes you think about reality in a way that a simple non-fiction account could not possibly match. "  "...the truth in the hands of artists, even when they are telling a fiction, even when they are inventing something, becomes a very powerful thing. Because what artists do is lend passion and emotion-they lend a kind of spiritual element to reality which enhances the truth, which gives it an intensity that a simple matter of recounting facts will not accomplish."  Both quotes are by Howard Zinn.

      I went to New York to meet up with Jacob for lunch.  His girlfriend came along, and we had a chill time.  We ate at Han Bat, then stopped at Gap so that Jacob could get a pair of jeans.  While we waited for him at the fitting area, this guy walked out of his room without pants.  Jacob stepped out at that precise moment and asked his girlfriend for some help.  It just didn't register to me until they tried to hide their bemusement.  Suddenly, the man beckoned in my direction, and I just turned to pretend like I didn't see anything.  Out of the corner of my eye, I realized that he was just motioning the fitting room attendant to come over.  Phew.  Esther and I agreed that since he was a European, it must be a cultural difference.  No shame, no shame indeed.  I was interested in also doing three things: getting a belt, a coat, and possibly presents for my little brother's birthday.  It was my first time shopping for myself, and I had no idea what to do.  They advised that I shouldn't spend more than $60 on a normal winter coat, so I commited that adage to memory.  We headed to Union Square to check out the new Guitar Center, but the grand opening was scheduled for tomorrow.  Bummer.  We hung out at the nearby Barnes & Noble.  Joe Park, of all people, was in town for an interview and joined us after it was over.  It was good to see him again, even if I didn't know him that well.  The Hopkins connection runs deep.  On the way back, I stopped by H&M upon their suggestion, bought a belt, a hat, gloves, and a coat.  I still couldn't think of what to do for my brother's birthday, but my older brother and I cleared that matter up later that evening.

One female said, "It depends on the situation.  If it's like casual, then fine.  If the chair happens to be right in front of you [it's ok, but] don't go out of your way.  For example, getting in the way of the hostess, making the girl feel mad awkward, etc. But normally a girl can pull out her own chair."  Another female said, "I mean, you can casually and jokingly ask about what she thinks, just as a topic of conversation, but I think you should develop your own conviction about things like that yourself first.  And say what you think of it too, in addition to asking what they think.  If it clearly makes someone uncomfortable, then you 'd know not to... I think it's no big deal.  But you have to use your wisdom to discern; every relationship looks different.  If you did that for me, I wouldn't misunderstand anything, but your each friendship with other girls will differ slightly."  You can read the other responses in the comment box at the previous entry.  I found the insights to be well said, and pretty much the same across the board.    Oh.  And what will I do as a result of this very professionally done bit of research?  I'll just relegate the chair thing to romance, from now on.  At least, I'll try, since it still feels like an obligation when I'm out alone with a female not necessarily for romance reasons.

      Question for my readers.  If you try to pull out a chair for a girl at a restaurant, is that considered to be a romantic gesture, or simple courtesy?  In my mind, it's courtesy, but I don't know the typical cultural perception about this sort of thing anymore.  edit: Not to say that I ever knew the typical cultural perception about this sort of thing.

      I just "discovered" The Cure.  I wonder why I never really got into these guys before.  I don't think I can really get into the other New Wave bands.  New Order never really kept my attention, Depeche Mode had only one song I liked, and Erasure lasted for 8th grade.  But I never explored The Cure, and thinking about my personality, it's a surprise.  Ok, so, basically, I like the arrangement of "Boys Don't Cry" and "Friday I'm In Love."  Some other clips sounded cheesy to me, but these two definitely have pull.  Shall I dive deeper, or stay on these two?  Opinions?

      It's funny that we sometimes confuse knowing God as a means to our ends with knowing God to be our end, in itself.  If it's the first option, our religions becomes the "crutch" that naysayers like to relegate our religion to be.  But when it's the second option, it just flips everything upside down.  We say, "we will never forsake you, Jesus."  But when it seems like life isn't going well, when it seems like the rent money will never come, when it feels like we have no direction in life, we question His validity.  It seems that the real desire, then, is self-centered.  What does it really mean to have God as the ultimate goal in life?  Not just in the intellectual and theoretical sense, but in the emotional and physical sense?  Then again, should there really a distinction between the two categories?  I don't know.  I think too hard.  I'm going to get myself a gyro or sub for lunch, then go tutor.  Adios.

      My, my, my, so many thoughts and so little time to explicate their contents.  Here's one thread of mental yarn.  Someone asked me today if I was growing in my church.  I gave a noncomittal answer, which probably was construed as a negative one.  But as I rode home on the bus, I gave the question some deeper consideration.  Am I "growing" in my church?  I've asked that question of so many other people, and never actually thought of its implications and assumptions.  If we are truly children of God, is there ever a time in which we're not growing?  If it feels like we're thinking "spiritual" thoughts and experiencing strong "spiritual" emotions, are we growing?  If it feels like we're going dry or "backsliding" in some negative environment, does that necessarily mean that we're not growing?  Honestly, I've had a very rough year.  I've repeatedly shirked much of my responsibilities and lived a very lazy and aimless lifestyle.  I've watched more movies and TV in this past year and half alone than I have in the past six years.  I've gone to church and haphazardly served this past year;  I started out with a bang, but petered out in conjunction with my grad school stint.  I'm still jobless, aimless, and living in a fog of uncertainty.  But, after some contemplation, my mind has started to see some good things.  I've been watching the kids I taught in Sunday School five years ago grow up.  I'm seeing what it means to raise a child, and have begun to correllate parenting style with a person's temperament.  As we try to build a new ministry it feels like I've gotten the life sucked out of me, but at the same time God's always speaking to me through my time here.  He seems to be testing what credos and beliefs and passions I had during college; do I really want to find my satisfaction in God?  Do I really desire to serve and love and care for someone else?  He seems to be honing me, bringing me through self-concious times to become healthily self aware.  He brought out the ugly sides of me, the sides I refused to acknowledge, and showed me why I need to be saved.  He placed me where I didn't want to be to show me that I didn't and still don't know what I want.  All in all, after the molding process of college, He's been hammering me on the anvil.  Maybe there's more heat to come, to help determine my shape.  We'll see.  Will I be a curved machete, or an elegent sabre?  Will I be a musician, or a teacher?  Will I be a broadsword, or a rapier?  Will I be an engineer, or artist?  Back to the anvil.

      "Controversial Post of the Day"  "A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing--if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety."  1 Timothy 2:11-15 NIV  As I read this passage last night, the frankness of these statements shocked me.  To truly understand the meaning of this quote, one must realize that in context, Paul had been discussing maturity and beauty.  I do understand, thanks to verse 10, that by asking women to properly clothing themselves with good works, he is calling them to focus on beauty of character, not beauty of the external.  I.e., not to seek the praise of others' opinions—or for more narcissistic women, their own.  But I still have no idea how to interpret the last verse; how will women be saved through childbearing?  What does Paul mean by the word "saved?"  Why does he bring up the point that woman was the first to be deceived into sin?  Is he just addressing a certain issue for women in the Ephesian church, or is he arguing for a greater scope?  I tried to think of the logical assumptions and implications, but I'm stumped.  Oh, and now I must go.  Do any of you out there have opinions?

      With thanksgiving gone, I reflect upon the past 11 months of my life.  It hits me that I am doing exactly the same thing I was doing an year ago, sans the pressure of school.  Now, even greater than ever, I feel the pressure of life.  Criticisms and nudges surround me from all sides.  "You lazy, selfish person."  "Why don't you do this?"  I dart through this maze but return back to the creature comforts that only further the problems.  It's time to get up and move.  ****  Our family watched Terminator 3 on DVD tonight.  Besides some impressive action scenes, it was awful.

      I surmise that those people that commit suicide lose hope because they trust the despair over what they don't know:  the future.  I guess we all have this fear of the future; maybe some have it more than others.  As for me, I guess I fall in the first category.    Maybe it's not just fear of the future, but simply lack of discipline.  When have I ever trained myself to not let negative feelings supercede positive ones?  Rather, when have I ever pursued the positive in the face of so much negative?  I surmise that I never followed that old adage, "no pain, no gain" because of my intense aversion to pain.  Man, I'm a wuss, and I know it.  I can think of countless a memory of me running from challenges, because the fear and dislike for pain overtook the hope that I'd make it through:  wimping out at the tramboline from that 4th grade tramboline party; trying to do whatever I can to make people notice me, during 6th and 7th grade; asking girls I liked out; working out past the point of pain, for a long period of time; the list goes on.  How in the world can my hope supercede my despair?  I know well that my strength for the future must come from my full acknowledgement of the past.  I must know and be affirmed by my personal and God's historical pasts.  Why is it so hard for my heart to believe and  rejoice  in the freedom I have in Christ?  At any rate, I have to sleep.  Good night, and Happy Thanksgiving.

      "The Triplets of Belleville"  I've been reading about this movie for a while now.  The favorable critical buzz makes me want to see it, but I'm not sure if any of my friends is into the arts-fartsy sort of thing enough to go see it with me.  Anyone game?  It's only playing in New York.  Here's the review from  urlLink New York Times .  I've been starting to become a "fan" of A. O. Scott's reviews.  Reading them makes me feel smarter; the vocabulary alone is a primer for SAT crammers.  I guess that shows that I'm merely a faux-intelligent person.  :-P

      I just got back from helping out at a dinner for the homeless in Paterson, NJ.  Reluctantly, I sang and played some guitar.  I really wasn't in the mood and didn't have the emotional strength to do it, but no one else had the resources.  I rather would have just served the food, but oh well.  Lots of thoughts milled in my mind that evening.  I have to go now.

      "Your account has been CLOSED."  That message scrolled up as I attempted to sign in at eden.rutgers.edu for the last time.  So ends my connection to Rutgers;  I technically still have a month left to decide to go back without having to reapply, but why would I want to?  It was a miserable educational experience.  The fellow graduate students were cool, but in the end, they weren't the reason for my studies.  With the symbolic closing of my Rutgers chapter, I sit and observe the challenges before me.  I failed at answering these questions beforehand, and they are the same ones that brought me down.  Who am I?  In what shall I place my hope?  How do I keep my hope alive?   How could I amplify the pursuit of my desires, so that they'll overshadow the obstacles of self-condemnation and depression ?  Am I this weak because of my diminutive size growing up?  Did that factor make peers look down upon me?  Did that factor induce a Napolean complex, as I tried overcompensate my weakness by asserting my mental superiority over my peers?  Maybe these things form the roots of my crippling self-criticism.  I'm trying to find solutions.

      The final week of November is here.  Turkey day in three days brings back memories.  During childhood, Thanksgiving comprised of watching the myriad of TV specials throughout the day.  It comprised of the warm, comforting aromas of food wafting from the kitchen.  We had good times back then, we sure did.  I will be continuously changing the format of this website.  The blog will not be the main page any longer.

      The following issues plague me everyday, during every activity:  I am lazy. I am rebellious. I am perfectionistic. I am too hard on myself. I have no joy in anything I do. I seriously doubt everything I do. I constantly self evaluate everything I do by saying, "I stink." I have no internal,  agreeable  motivation to do anything. I have a very difficult time connecting the ideas of God's reality and truth with my REAL worldview and emotions.  I should be solaced and remedied by counting my blessings from God:  I have talents, to a certain degree. I am relatively intelligent. I have a loving family. I am a child of God. I have shelter. I have friends. I am healthy.  Then why does it not work?  Why am I so fixated on myself, either for good or bad?  Why am I so spoiled as to be unsatisfied with what I have?  Why is it so hard for me to see God?  Why am I not appreciative?  They say that you only can appreciate things when you don't have them.  Does that mean I'll have to lose these things?  I don't want to be one of those people that regret not being appreciative and loving.  These are crucial years; why must I allow my unhappy thoughts to rule me?  Why must I be so lazy?  Maybe God has been allowing my imperfections to rule me to show my need for help.  I pray that He will change my mind and heart and soul for the better, soon.

      "Sunday was a bright day yesterday Dark cloud has come into the way"  — Sylvia Robinson, singing in "Sunday (The Day Before Yesterday)" by Moby  Frequently there are times where my mind and heart become overwhelmed by thoughts and emotions of depression.  It's during these times that I turn to many avenues including social company, music, and the many other forms of media for solace.  But they don't do the trick.  I talk to God throughout these episodes.  Maybe it's the disproportionate amount of trust we put upon modern society's promises and the demands of our basic instincts that  tricks  us into eschewing our fundemental need for God.  How could we find our utmost satisfaction in Someone unseen?  It seems that the Bible answers by saying, "fear God, and keep His commandments," as well as, "to do the will of my Father is the bread I eat."  What keeps me from that lifestyle?  How does one break free?

      Snow, snow, snow.  It cancelled tonight's praise night.  I watched Ben Hur last night, after coming home from a day of tutoring and visiting a small group.  That movie is a classic, I loved it.  It was from a different time, obviously, so I tried to take the slower pacing and acting style into account.  But man, it was great.  The picture quality was top notch, and that chariot scene was awesome.  The Star Wars Phantom Menace pod race was SUCH a bad ripoff.  This was the real thing, real horses, real people driving the teams, no computers, no special effects.  Such a great sequence.  I love old movies.  I love good company too; it was good to see people my age again.  At least, in my age range.

      I rented Solaris tonight and liked it.  It struck a Twilight Zone chord without the direct morality-driven notes.  I guess this results from being a remake of an older movie.  I also loved the cinematography and dreamlike quality; it was very Stanley Kubrick.  Add in top-notch acting and spacey sound design, and you have all the elements for a great movie.  However, like Kubrick's 2001, it moves with a snail's pace.  Make this a private or dual viewing.  Basically, it's almost a Hollywood art movie, if that's possible.  It's to this tune that I sigh from relief that Hollywood totally hasn't gone to the marketing meetings.  This movie is very challenging, a financial risk to its investors.  Yet, the powers that be put out the movie, and for that I am grateful.    Here's one quote from the movie that I found to be interesting:  "There are no answers, only choices."  This echoes, to me, the importance of the concept of "choice" in the Matrix Revolutions.  I have more thoughts about this, but none complete enough to write yet.

      A question to my readers that know the law.  The thirteenth amendment abolished slavery, but I noticed in the bottom of the article it says, "The amendment was rejected (and not subsequently ratified) by Mississippi, December 4, 1865."  Since Mississippi still hasn't ratified this law, does that mean that slavery is still technically allowed in Mississippi?  Or, since the rest of the country ratified it, is it outlawed overall, including Mississippi?

      Many of you may have known this about me, or maybe not:  I am a major fan of the Twilight Zone.  I am drawn not to the incarnations of recent decade past, but to the original 1950s-60s series by Rod Serling.  I first saw an episode in school during 7th grade, then once my sophomore year in college.  Since then I always catch it whenever I see it on, especially during those Sci-Fi Channel Marathons.  For that reason alone, thank goodness for the Sci-Fi Channel.  Today I flipped through the channels while folding my laundry, when I happened upon a young Robert Duvall in black and white.  Instantly I knew this was the Twilight Zone, due to the style of the grain and ood of the shot.  This particular episode seemed to touch upon what I was going through recently because it centered upon a lone bachelor unable to cope with normal society that lives under the shadow of his overly worried and domineering family.  In order to deal with his troubles, the protagonist stumbles upon a dollhouse in a museum one day and discovers the doll inside to be alive.  His subsequent actions eventually land him in a mental hospital. He fakes recovery to escape and head back to the dollhouse.  In order to avoid capture, he enters the dollhouse to be with his doll.  The themes explored within resonated with me, and it seemed like they resonate still today.  Similar themes were explored in the movie "Punch Drunk Love," in which the protagonist endured the same complex, unresolvable tension caused by familial oppression.  In both cases, they found escape through love.  Can I find a similar escape?  A better escape?

      I attended a small group recently, in which we discussed what it means to have hope.  Later this evening, I ran across this article that seemed to address well the value system and expectations of this world we live in. The title is "The Habits of Millionaires."   urlLink Click here to read it .  According to the article, the happiest people are educated women that have a worth of about one million dollars.  The values espoused were wise decision making, extreme focus, risk taking, and a having "save and invest" mentality towards the acquisition of money, not "earn and buy" mentality.  It is interesting that the author highlights having a "save and invest" mentality, as well as having a tenacious personality.  It reminds me of the VH1 "Driven" and "Behind the Music" documentary series, because they try to convince viewers that music pop stars are where they are because they matched those exact qualities with their talents.  Examples like these and others show that according to the world, it's the strength of determination and will that gets people to those heights.  Those values remind me of the talents parable, found in  urlLink Matthew 25:14-30 .  It also makes me think, maybe we Christians have too much of a "earn and buy" mentality, instead of a "save and invest" mentality when we deal with those that don't know God.  The 20th century gave rise to the term "soul-winning" in order to describe the evangelism process.  I've never been comfortable with that terminology, for it sounds so heartless and loveless.  Are we "winning souls for God?"  I would rather think that the kingdom of God stems from an investment process, a desparate search for pearls, a working of our gifts and talents, an devoting of our time to find those long lost sheep.  Those values also make me think of Ecclesiastes and Proverbs.  Where is the acknowledgement of God, in all of this undaunted and iron willed effort?  I think about myself, how I have no purpose, no goal, no reason.  God, I want a reason to live.  I want a mission statement to match the vision statement, a mission statement that flows from the vision of faith.  Oh, I need a mission, a goal to reach, a height to climb, a bridge to build, a symphony to compose, a community to build.  I need a mission.

      My friend posted this quote on his  urlLink site .  I am familiar with it, but I had forgotten about it.  Here it is.  "The excellency of Christ is an object adequate to the natural cravings of the soul, and is sufficient to fill the capacity. It is an infinite excellency, such an one as the mind desires, in which it can find no bounds; and the more the mind is used to it, the more excellent it appears. Every new discovery makes this beauty more ravishing, and the mind sees no end; here is room enough for the mind to go deeper and deeper, and never come to the bottom."  - Jonathan Edwards, On Knowing Christ, 170.

      Four hours ago, I promised myself that I'd clean the room I'm using and set up the mini studio that will last for now two days.  I hoped that I'd have it up last friday, so that I could play around with it for a week.  But, how typical, I chose the cheaper, lesser, but more comfortable and automatic pleasure of going online.  Is this really pleasure, or enslavement?  I literally feel like I MUST go online if I am near the computer.  It's not just a thought, it's a real need.

      A friend of my suggested me to look into performing an engine rebuild of my car, turning it from an Integra LS to an Integra "LS/VTEC."  The prospect seemed intriguing, because it would combine my car the engine power of the higher-powered Integra GSR model with my LS car's extra torque at lower engine revs.  However, I came across this article:  urlLink click here to read .  It suggested that it's not necessarily a good thing due to my LS engine's different rod/stroke ratio.  Is that a strong argument against the practice?  I could always get better cams.  But in the end, either route will cost much money, and for what gain... 30 to 40 extra horses under the hood.  But that's still only going to net me roughly 180 horses.  I currently have 142 horsepower at 2685 lbs, giving me a ratio of 0.053.  Considering that the Ford Escort had a ratio of 0.045, that's pretty weak, pretty sad.  If I tried to get that extra 40 horsepower, I'd still only get a ratio of 0.067.  Would it be worth the extra thousands to perform the VTEC conversion, thereby losing my warranty and shortening my car's engine life?  Considering that I would have had to only pay 2000 more for a GSR to begin with, I should say not.  All in all, I've looked into turbocharging, supercharging, rebuilding VTEC, and replacing cams.  All would give me significant gains in the relative sense, but in the absolute sense, I still wouldn't gain much in relations to the costs.  I think I'll forgo any more thoughts about investing in my car beyond some simple modifications.  Maybe a Type-R spoiler for looks, maybe better headlights, maybe even an intake and a Venturi valve for the intake manifold.  But all in all, I'm satisfied with the car itself.  I do hope that once I have a real career and job, I'd get a car with a better power to weight ratio, but hey, that's thinking way too ahead of myself. ;)

      Last night I watched the Two Towers, extended version.  It was a SIGNIFICANT improvement over the theater version, I must say.  I love the extra dramatic elements and character development; it made the movie just as good as the first, in my opinion.  Now, I am a bit more inclined to see the finale.  One more week, my precious.

      cool.  my last post took place at exactly 2:00:00 AM.  where to go, where to go from here?  the question haunts me, quietly.  it taunts me while i ignore it by staying up late nights, and wake up late mornings.  I notice that my mind/heart is melancholic.  For some reason, it considers the down, the hard, the depressing things in life to be more real than the lively, the joyful, the pleasing things in life.  There's an embarrasment that comes when I do things out of joy.  Isn't that funny?  It's considered foolish more so when we do things out of joy, than when we do things out of sadness.  I think, at least, from the culture and environment I grew up within, such was the case.  Or, maybe it was always just me.  God how do I find my satisfaction in you, and yet fully pursue my calling, with all the steps that I need to take and do it?  unless they are one in the same.

      "my precious."  Due to the 22 inches of snow (so reported in the Bronx, at least) I stayed in and watched the Fellowship of the Rings extended DVD.  The three and half hours consisted of my mom talking on the phone and asking inane questions; of my dad walking in front of the TV unannounced to stoke the fire; and of myself asking my little brother if the current scene was an addition or a movie original.  The saddest thing I realized about yesterday and today was that what most people did yesterday and today was what I've been doing for a long time.  Inertia, Inertia.

      Thanks to Sunny, I found this awesome site.   urlLink The Lego-Illustrated Bible.   AWESOME!  12/20/2003 2:17 AM EDIT:  I take that "AWESOME!" back.  I think some of the imagery can be helpful in Biblical education, but after going through most of the site, something wasn't right.  There's nothing wrong with depicting nudity and sex, but he seemed to gravitate towards specific stories that dealt with the issues.  Furthermore, he depicted them in a pretty graphic (albeit, it's LEGO, but the implications are there) manner.   I found this a bit odd, so I decided to do some research.  Here's a  urlLink Philadelphia Inquirer article  about him.  Even at this point, I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.  But then I came across two stories that seemed to espouse his intention for the site.  He took two instances from Leviticus concerning false prophets and related them to Jesus.  Here's the  urlLink first instance , and here's the  urlLink second instance .    Now, one might say that it explains why the Jews and Saul felt and thought the ways that they did, concerning Christ and His disciples.  But if you look at  the way  he depicts most of the stories concerning nudity and violence, there's an irreverent tone to them.   When the Bible says, "they had sex," or when it talks about God killing a man, he depicts them with considerable artistic license, to say the least.   It's apparent that his atheism has a bias in what he's doing.  With this sentiment in mind, it seems to me that these two Leviticus examples are presented in a mocking, not thought-provoking manner.  Anyhow, I just wanted to put up this disclaimer.  I think it's great that someone put the time and energy into this whimsical and creative idea, but be warned, it's made by a skeptic.  Oh well.  ****   urlLink Final WTC "Freedom Tower" design .

      Hey everyone.  New pictures are now officially up.  Pictures of tonight's cell group Christmas party, as well as many others.  Go to  urlLink www.pbase.com/timkang  to check them out!  I saw Return of the King on Wednesday night.  It was all I expected, and I was thoroughly satisfied.

      I've been compiling a Christmas Wishlist.  Heh heh.  Well, I don't think anyone that reads this site will go out of their way to get me a gift, but I am doing this to motivate people to make their own lists, so that I can wisely shop for their presents ;-).  It is not necessary for people to get it on Amazon, and by no way is this list all inclusive.  HAHA.   urlLink Click Here to see my wish list . ;-)  ****  The praise night is over.  Let's just hope the kids really got the idea about the serious nature of the affair.  Even when it is light and to be filled with joy, it is still a serious task to approach our God in praise and worship.  The thing that gets me is that I know many of the "right" answers and things to say.  But what do I know?

      "'The Birth of a Nation' is no more or less enlightened than the America which produced it. As a social document, it represents how racist a white American could be in 1915 without realizing he was racist at all."  — Roger Ebert, from  urlLink his review  of the 1915 watershed film "Birth of a Nation."  Upon revisiting the issue of " urlLink Rickshaw Rally ," this movie came to mind.  In no way can there be an equitable comparison made between this VBS material and that movie, but some similarities made me pause to think.  Back then the white audiences didn't even think, couldn't possibly think that this movie was offensive.  As Ebert points out, the views expressed weren't necessarily shunned upon then: "It is a stark history lesson to realize that this film, for many years the most popular ever made, expressed widely held and generally acceptable mainstream white views."  It is upon this point that I find a parallel with the Rickshaw Rally curriculum.  I don't think the creators of the material had any idea that their material was offensive.  I gather that they hail from the deep South, a region not particularly known for any significant Asian American communities.  How could they think that what they were doing was a typical example of Asian stereotyping, when they had no real understanding of that idea in the first place?  Another parallel I find is that when the "Birth of the Nation" supporters defended the movie, their words went as such:  "To say that [the filmmaker is anti-Negro] is like saying I am against children, as they were our children, whom we loved and cared for all of our lives."  There is an innocent, unknowing, ignorant racism at play here, and I see the same issue played out with the Rickshaw Rally creators.  In  urlLink this editorial response , Lifeway Publishers president James Draper seemed to exhibit a similar naivete.   Maybe I'm not giving enough credit to his intelligence, but it just seems to indicate a deep misunderstanding wrought clearly by total ignorance when he says, "During the 15-month process, we consulted experts in Japanese culture and language, and we traveled to Japan to research and film the curriculum," then says, "It’s true that 'Racing to the Son,' which is set in Japan, does incorporate Americanized elements like takeout boxes and fortune cookies, but these merely provide American kids with a recognizable bridge to a new and wonderful culture."  Am I missing something here?  Why does he say "Americanized," not "common American stereotypical?"  They did what was 'right' in their eyes by consulting  their  experts on Japan, and decided to augment their push for multi-cultural education by implementing "recognizable," "Americanized" symbols.  It is clear that he still doesn't understand how that assumption, in itself, is the root of all of these troubles.  To say that those supposedly common ideas of Asian culture, made by American adults, would be commonly recognizable to unexperienced children is either insanely obtuse, utter defiance, or innocent ignorance.  I opt for the latter.  He would only consider the children to perceive those "Americanized" elements to be normal because he himself didn't live in a multi-cultured environment to constantly challenge his assumptions.  Honestly, I don't agree with all of the views and reasonings made by the  urlLink Reconsidering Rickshaw Rally  website.  I think it's a bit too extreme due to the intensely emotional impetus behind the movement.  I think the only way that things can truly change is for them two to meet and have a long chat, then switch jobs for a month.  If only this were an ideal world, no?  However, I do support the petition, because it is a non-violent, method to make a statistically-backed statement to Lifeway.  What really is the biblical manner to address this issue, though?  Matthew 18:15-35 and Ephesians 4 seem to contain some insight into the matter.  Underlying these passages lies the thought that we should be "imitators of God... as dearly loved children" and to "live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God."  What is the next step to take to ensure this, instead of "letting the sun go down on our anger?"  Anyhow, here is the counterpoint essay to Draper's editorial.   urlLink Click here to read it .

      Merry Christmas everyone.  On Christmas Eve, I woke up late, draining any time from getting presents in time for everyone on my list.  I did have time to get at least some of my shopping done over this past week, but not enough.  I gave my older brother a Playstation 2, my younger brother a Switchfoot CD.  My older brother and I gave my dad a 2-year Time subscription, which he sorely missed this past year.  We'll also get my mom pearl earrings, and I promised to clean the stove for her.  I gave my students a Tangram set, paper airplane instruction book, an anime cartoon instruction book, a brain teaser book, a Calvin and Hobbes book, and a Jewel CD.  For the first 3 years of college, I had newfound confidence in life.  I have now lost it all.  For Christmas, what I really want is to be free, healed, and alive.

      "Come, come let us return to the Lord."  I had a disturbing dream.  It started out with an overwhelming sense of panic.  I had avoided or forgotten to attend half of my classes, and it was the end of my last semester of senior year.   What the hell is wrong with me?  How could I avoid all that work?  How did I get myself into this mess?   Distraught and desparate, I set out to reason with the registrar's office.  It was at this moment that I remembered that a certain lady was in my classes, one of formidable presence that distracted the class with her vitriolic outbursts.  She resembled Ina Garten of the Food network show " urlLink Barefoot Contessa ," without the smile and polite disposition.  It turned out that she was a dangerous cult leader, ruthless with violence and absolute in her power.  I decided to tip the government agency out to get her, with the hope that I can use the excuse of emotional damages to drop the classes with no charge.  Unfortunately, they decided to involve me in her capture and placed me in the sting operation to capture her.  It was an exciting affair at first, stormng into her house with guns ablazin'.  She put up a deadly fight, killing most of the people with me.  She shot the gun out of my hand, and pointed it at my head.  At that moment, a partner burst in and threw me live electrical wire.  I thrust it onto her body with such a conviction that could only be borne from desparation for survival.  Her eyes rolled upward, and she vigorously shook in place.  Torrents of sweat developed on her skin, and I kept it going until I knew she was subdued.  The dream until this point seemed a bit ludicrous, but now it took on a whole different air.  Beginning from panic, I had progressed to excitement and bravery.  But now, a horrid savagery filled my veins, and I dropped the wire.  There was glee in my defense, not fear.  There was a morbid enjoyment in my violence.  Still shaken from this incident, the dream shifted to the aftermath.  I found an attorney and asked with urgency that he vouch for me as I tried to drop my classes without penalty.  He asked me to recount my experiences with the woman and her deadly followers.  The dream shifted again to explain my flashback.  I was with some of my church members, and we had pulled into a retreat center.  The overcast sky had a strange blue and gray pallor, and I was now overcome by a sensation of fear.  I entered one of the buildings, and climbed the staircase.   There's nothing to fear , I thought, and walked down the hallway.  I heard a shout from behind me, and saw one of the woman's men.  A fearful chase ensued, the details of which I forget now.  All I can remember is the fear that gripped me during pursuit.  I reunited with my church members, and we sped out of there in a hurry.  After all of this, an intense sensation guilt arose.  How could I have enjoyed torturing someone?  Furthermore, how could I use my negative experiences as an excuse to escape the consequences that resulted from my laziness that semester?  I awoke from this dream awash with all of the emotions I've mentioned:  panic, excitement, savage satisfaction, fear, guilt.  How could I be so ungrateful for what I have?  How could I complain?  How could I NOT be satisfied with where I am?  Why am I not satisfied with my God?  I'm listening to a song from this year's One Day.  Has it already been seven months since I heard it?  "Come, let us return to the Lord," pleads Mr. Redman.  "With brokenness of heart, we consecrate our lives singing come, come let us return to Lord."  What now?

      I meet people that remind me how fallen and lost I am.  There's something about the way they didn't crumble, the way that they keep going when things were rough.  It angers me further that I couldn't take it anymore, that I crumbled, that I didn't keep going when things were rough.  But to what end does my anger serve?  I'm still lazy, I'm still uncontrolled, I'm still living in automatic pilot.  Maybe this time in life is a big lesson from God, to show that I am weak, uninspired, apathetic, lackadaisical, unresponsible, the chaff in the wind, the sluggard that craves and gets nothing.  Maybe it's those echoes of homeroom taunts in 7th grade, the fear of being unaccepted in my new church in PA during 4th and 5th.  Maybe it's those tumultuous times during childhood when my mother, unable to deal with the tumultuous times, took out her emotions on those closest to her.  Whatever it is, self-debasement constantly rack my mind and heart: "You @$$hole, why did you do that?"  "Did you really think you'd do a good job? What were you thinking?"  "You'll never get anywhere."  "You're horrible at everything that you do."  "You're good enough to learn, but you'll never be good enough."  I've never believed in myself nor in what I can do, because in my mind, I'm always a failure.    On top of all this, but this "sleep late/wake late" lifestyle is killing me.  This sedentary, hopeless cycle leaves me proclaiming every morning, "God, free me from this!"  Why can't I just be satisfied with myself?  Why can't I be confident in myself; not in a narcisstic way, but in a simple, healthy way?  How many of us "Christians" truly want God?  How many of us treat our relationship with God as a means to our own ends, instead of an end for our means?  And for me, why do I still run away every evening and morning?  Please, take this weight from my chest, the clouds from my mind, the anger from my heart.

      "We ate the food, we drank the wine Everybody having a good time except you. You were talking about the end of the world."*   Last night I went to a birthday bash at the "Lush Lounge" in TriBeCa.  Everybody had a good time dancing the night away under the influence of various forms of alcohol.  I am glad that many had come to celebrate the birthday person's personal new year, and she seemed to have a great time.  I myself had two drinks, but steeled my will to keep my composure.  It was by my own volition, not by the ethyl alcohol influence that I danced for the last half of the evening.  I danced to break down my overwhelming sense of lonliness and isolation that the evening's atmosphere heightened.  People with whom I thought I had a good connection found their interests with more familiar haunts, and I moped around wondering how I came to be so passive and introverted.  I took pictures that conveyed how I felt, one of which you see above.  I prayed for God to turn the thoughts and feelings off, but they grew worse until I began to have some conversations with people that I didn't know.  That made me feel much better.  After eating out and waiting with Willy for Tina to bring back his keys, I drove back and got back in around 7 in the morning.  I crawled into bed and awoke 8 hours later.  "In my dream, I was drowning my sorrows But my sorrows they'd learned to swim Surrounding me, going down on me Spilling over the brim"*  And so sums up the past two years' pattern.  I tried this past month to place myself in more socially engaging situations, because I knew that I needed it.  I'm an extrovert that loves connecting with people, but has lived the life of an introvert due to my misery.  The cell group I've been visiting has been very gracious in welcoming me and including me in their community.  But to my consternation, I still find myself drowning in my inexplicable sorrows that creep up and immerse me like the clandestine tide over ocean shores.  They come and go at a pace imperceptible but with effects visible.  God, why do I have to be such a drag?  Why am I the pin that deflates the positive atmospheres around me?   To make matters worse, I kept thinking about someone in whom I had interest, but found the realities to point the other way.  Once again I found myself staring down the hypnotic barrel of a gun without one of my own to defend myself.  Must I continue on being me?  Can I now transform into something new?  Can I take up the guitar and pen, my computer and bible, my pencil and calculator, and boldly march into a new era?  The sorrows entice my heart to look down into their nefarious depths, while the glorious lights of promise shine overhead.  God, help me to desire the elusive joys that hover above me, instead of the deceptive self-importance found in the sufferings below.  * all lyrics taken from  Until the End of the World , by U2

      I rented Tron tonight.  I hadn't seen this movie since 1987, so I enjoyed a healthy dose of nostalgia.  It's funny how different a movie appears to you with age.  The graphics and whatnot are pretty outdated, the acting is cheesy, and the plot is a bit contrived.  However, the sense of design and feel make up for all of these minuses.  The backlit, stylistic glow  feels  so futuristic, even if the vision clearly hails from the early 80s, and I'll always love those light cycles.  A futurist named Syd Mead designed most of this movie, as well as Blade Runner and Alien.  I love his style, this movie has definitely solidified my interest.     urlLink Here's his site. .

      I went to a New Year's party hosted by a member of the small group I've been attending this past month.  Over 50 people packed into his house and partied the night away.  I had a good number of conversations, although the sangria slowed my mind a bit.  I'm not too into alcohol because alchohol reduces my conversational skills.  Boo.  The host had a well-groomed and well-behaved dog.  It definitely enjoyed the attention showered upon it by so many guests.  Everyone beckoned me to dance, but I chickened out.  I'm way too rusty, although I'd move in time to the beat when no one was looking.  I enjoy music too much not to get into the act, although I'm not too into recent pop dance and party hip hop music.  Play a James Brown track, though, and it's game over.  Happy new year everyone.

      I stayed up to put together a mix for one of my students, as well as chat with some of my old friends from college.  Again, I was told that I put too much pressure upon myself.  That is true.  I unconsciously placed my confidence and hopes in such silly things while growing up.  I remember stressing out over which of my ragtag, hand-me-downs I'd wear to school.  I placed my hope in my self-perceived and constructed image; this of course led to mockery and a further stripping down of my confidence.  In college, I placed my confidence in my intelligence; my ideas, my visions, my strong desires were "great" and worthy of praise in my eyes.  But what became of those?  Despair and humilation over my inability to focus upon and pursue these visions.  Underlying these and all other spurious confidences laid a measuring stick for success:  respect from peers.  Praise, awe, and adoration told me that what I did was right, or in most cases, that I sucked.  Soon, the loudest voice of criticism became myself.  Maybe it's always been this way, to be honest.  I know that I should desire God's praise, that I should place my confidence in Christ.  But these things are so abstract to me, they've always been.  I've felt intensly positive emotions in corporate times of worship or even sometimes by myself, but a quiet dissatisfaction nagged and continues to nag at me.  How can I bask in the favor and delight of Someone imperceptible?  I can bask in the shared positive emotions of people around me at church, but what about God Himself?  What is that favor and delight?  How can I see the reality of heaven, of what it'll be like to be in unimaginable, uncontainable bliss in God's presence?  What could this God be like, that the simple presence of a being would have such an effect?  When I read Edwards, Lewis, or Piper, I see that these men have a real vision of these things.  Maybe because I'm so content with modern entertainment, I can't possibly fathom or connect with God, and hence the prior myriad of questions.  And maybe it's to this situation that Jesus referred when He said, "It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God."  Maybe it's time for a fast.

      It's the end of the year, and in many ways nothing has changed from last year while in others, everything has changed.  My overall feelings in life and my outlook sadly haven't changed.  I started out the year hoping that I'd have a firmer grasp on my future direction in life, but I'm still in this purgatory.  I started out with this non-productive lifestyle, and still have it now.  Due to this "sleep late/wake late/live online" pattern, the whole year didn't feel like a year, but like a month.  But, things have changed.  I'm no longer in the BME Ph.D. path, no longer enslaved to an uncaring academic conglomerate.  Ok, that last part about Rutgers being uncaring wasn't true.  The department secretary was very helpful, and they DID pay me.  Ok, I'm thankful.  But what else has changed?  I tutor students, I drive my own car, my church has more members, and I've met more people this year.  What have I learned?  I'm not so sure, to tell you the truth.  I guess I've learned that I am weak at heart and will, and have gallons of repressed anger and hate and issues that I haven't fully dealt with in the past.  Either that, or I've simply become a temperamental individual.  Maybe it's both.  Oh, and I've learned that in relatoinships, emotion and commitment must go hand in hand, but don't naturally coexist.  One must fight to have commitment bolstered by positive emotion.

      "Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage"  — Billy Corgan  There exist times in which I'm so angry that I want to take a bat and smash everything in sight.  This weekend was one of those times.  Adam Sandler's character in the movie "Punch Drunk Love" best summarizes my experience; simply replace the sisters with my mother, and take out the love interest.  I tried to go to sleep at 8 pm today, to cool off.  But my dad, with his perpetually perfect timing, woke me up and asked me to eat dinner.  After eating, we filtered downstairs to have family time for my mother's birthday.  My dad requested that each member utter a reason of thanks for the auspicious occasion.  I didn't have much to say because I was so angry, and any thought process had shorted out.  The conversation turned to my brother's flat tire problem, and to the general issue about car tires.  Obviously, my dad's tirade miffed my mother, and by the end of the night she uttered to herself, "What else should I expect from four men?  I will always be lonely.  I need to teach these people how to understand women.  A flower will sometimes hold as much worth as a pearl to a woman."  I couldn't believe what had transpired in that hour, and my anger grew.  Afterwards, I had to get out of the house.  I had enough of the vicious cycle of anger, the narrow atmosphere of thought.  Some friends had a movie night, so I went to escape and to enjoy the company of the people there.  Interaction with people outside immensely helped me gather myself.  I drove back with the day's events fomenting inside of my head.  Where do I go from here?  What next?  When I arrived, I washed the dishes and cleaned the stove.  My anger rose again as I kept thinking of writing an essay describing my day, but I couldn't think clearly amidst the storm.  Just as the winds of change came, so they have gone.  I am left all the more bitter.  God, please don't let the anger linger before the sun goes down.  Please let the bright futures of every individual overshadow the current storms of discord.

      I must break free and embark on a new path.  I have to do something, but it seems that I must first find my spiritual footing.  I'm this way now because I've fallen apart inside, and I remedy my shattered state with glue instead of starting anew.  When my emptiness and need of pleasure arise, I turn to modern media and my body's cravings for easement.  In my heart, I know and feel I'm starving from my reduced intake of Biblical food.  I feel my body sapped from energy and meaning and purpose, turning every which way for sustenance but finding none permanent.  Yes, I need to renew my foundations, to slake my deepest thirst, my only true thirst.  But why do I still avoid it?  Because it's like eating after recovering from sickness.  The body knows it needs it, but the stomach doesn't agree.  The tastes know that they'd normally like it, but at the moment it feels extremely uncomfortable.  I need rehabilitation for the very depths of my soul.

      Q: Why is it harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God, than for a camel to pass through an eye of a needle?  A:  His heart is divided among his many possessions and distractions.  True heaven would be to love the Lord our God with all of our hearts, souls, and minds beyond all time.  But how could this promise be attractive to a person who has everything he or she wants here?  Christ's camel/needle illustration seems to be more profound than I realized; the needle eye has room for one single desire, while trying to fit a camel matches trying to fit exponentially larger amounts of desire for so many things.  Can we strip our periphery desires to say that God is truly our only one?  Can we have the strength to fast from God's blessings to be satisfied by knowing God alone?  If it hypothetically came down to it, would we rather pleasure in gourmet food, TV, movies, music, sex, alcohol, cars, romance, relationships and games than pleasuring in communion with God?  Do we really love God?  It's genius, it really is, that God made Himself imperceptible save for the written memories transmitted through the Bible.  Man would fall in love with the unthinkably glorious image transmitted through our eyes and ears and confuse it for truly loving God Himself.  It's like trying to get a dog to love you by giving him food; does he really love you as its master, or simply because your image means food delight for him?  Because God can't be perceived by our five senses, to obey and emotionally connect with Him Unseen, to trust the words of Someone imperceptible would mean there's a true love for God Himself.  It's a test of real love, isn't it?

      I need something, or someone, to wake me up by grabbing me from the seat of my heart.  I want to  live , to live. TO LIVE.  Yet I wake late, and when I do, the day oozes by.  No real intelligent thought occurs until it's later at night and I realize what stupidness I've done, again.  Funny, how the fires of sober thought are stoked by the poker of regret.  ****  "Hmm... looking at your transcript, I don't think you should shoot so high when applying to grad schools.  Honestly, well, your grades suck."  *uncomfortable silence, then a nervous laugh from me.*  "Oh, by the way, don't forget that I can always write a recommendation for you."  *I smiled in disbelief.*  And so, during my senior year, went my final advising session with my horrible undergrad advisor.  For four years I had seen him once a semester, seven times in total.  Each time, the arrogance oozed out of his pores as he dismissed every question with the most deflating answers.  I remember the first session, I told him that I considered the field of prosthetics.  "Oh, well, that's not a very respectable field.  You shouldn't even bother thinking about it.  It's antiquated, and not very academic."  Every semester, during our advising sessions, he'd look at my transcript, ask me what my activities were, flash his unctuous smile, and say, "well, you'll just have to get those grades up."  Right, right, and please tell me something I didn't know already.   Finally, I did, I made Dean's List first semester senior year.  On top of that, I was one of the few students to get an A in his class that semester.  And what did I hear?  "Your grades suck."  HAHA. Oh, how rich.  The irony, the irony.  I'm smart, but I'm lazy.  It's caught up to me now.

      I got sick today for the first time in a while.  I had chills, was overcome by dizziness, felt really weak and painful throughout my body, and threw up after, among all things, stepping out of the shower.  I think it was some sort of temporary flu, because after sleeping for 8 hours in my parents' electrically heated bed, the chills disappeared.  This felt just like the summer flu I got when I moved back from college in 2002, and when I went to Houston in 1999.  What misery; I had to miss tutoring, as well as spending time with friends.

      "Cat and Mouse"  For the past couple of years, the number of mouse sightings in my parents' house has grown.  During some late nights, one would hear scratching in the walls or see a brown object flash across the floor.  We'd also find mice droppings randomly throughout the house.  Finally, last week my older brother had enough forbearance.  He went out and bought every form of mice removal paraphernalia: different kinds of poison, wooden traps, plastic traps, and sticky traps.  I'm having much more sympathy for Tom.  Jerry, you're a pest that leaves poop everywhere.  Stupid cartoon.

      Here's a very fun and addicting game, one of the best online games I've played.  The controls are confusing at first, but you can change them to match your comfort.  Great game.   urlLink Heli Attack 2   ****  In a sense, scales are coming off my eyes as I admit to things that I haven't faced over the years.  I think I found a major source of my problems.  Maybe I really need to undergo a fast.  I've been constantly satisfying my shallow desires instead of satisfying my deeper desires.  Since the deeper desires haven't been met, I've given myself to frustration and unhappiness.  I wish God can reach into my mind and instantly "reboot" me.

      Ok, I admit it.  I'm filled with laziness, impatience, and short-sightedness, and they've undermind every goal I've tried to accomplish.  These three intwined attributes feed upon each other; I'm lazy because I get impatient from my short-sightedness.  I get frustrated from the negative consequences of laziness, and short-circuit any attempts to fight it with my impatience in putting up with those negative feelings.  This pattern applies to worsking out, improving my music, doing well in school, making wise purchases, pursuing my career goals, and developing relationships with people.  God, I wish I had a stronger mind.  Or, maybe even deeper, a stronger emotional belief in hope.

      When one finds out that a person of interest already has someone, a pang of rejection also meets a sigh of relief.  No more wondering, plotting, hoping, nor guesswork exists.  Just the all too familiar feeling of rejection remains; the feeling of pain almost comforts in its familiarity.  It says, "you really are too passive to face your challenges, too weak to fight for your strength, and too pessimistic to have any hope."  I had almost fallen into the same trap in which I had fallen beforehand.  But, I'll try not to dwell upon these matters for too long.  I have a new year to hope, a new year to revitalize my dying life.  I just need a couple of days to sit and regroup, count my blessings and resources, dream it all up again, and set out into new territory.  What talent shall I hone and market?  What field shall I enter?  What steps shall I take to do both of these things?  And how can I fight for the patience that I need to follow them?

      In the face of all my internal detractors, within my heart echoes the seminal question that will define my personal future, "Do you really believe in the future promised by God?"  By dwelling in the lull of modern entertainment and lust's seductive promises, my heart and mind stray from the path to ultimate joy.  Do I really believe that unsurpassable joy shall come?  Do I really believe that there will be a place of unexplicable pleasures that would overshadow anything that man could ever conceive?  In the face of my despair and self-absorbed melancholy, shall I have the strength to look from my dark cell into the bright freedom that lies outside?  Maybe I should turn first to the idea of this unsurpassing joy.  Can it exist, and is it worth it?  Is it foolish to place a belief in something unknown and scientifically unverifiable?  Will the testimony of biblical authors and Christian writers from the past 2000 years hold emperical weight to support solid, inferential reasoning that God exists, and that He "rewards those whom earnestly seek Him?"  Shall I obsess over this pearl, this eternal prize?  Can I?

      "Cutting the  urlLink Moebius Strip "  I've lived in this cycle for too long.  Each day this week has resonated with this conviction; I can see the tides of life changing now.  I must sit down and rigoursly map out my desires and wants, my dreams and hopes.  I must decide how I must reach these places and what I must to do get there.  I must be brutally honest in my evaluations cut them out or not.  I must be careful not to cut along the same lines and erect a similar lifestyle and psyche as before.  Lest, I would end up never escaping; cut a mobius strip along the middle and one would get two linked strips.  Instead, one must cut it transverse, across the grain, for the loop to be undone.  I have to cut this pattern in half and start anew.  I have to make a stand and fight for whatever seem to be the path God has chosen.  God, I need a real vision for what Your heart is in.

      I attended cell group again tonight, and it was something I needed.  It's a healing thing to see and interact with others in the same boat;  it's not a healing thing to be home with my parents for too long.  Complacency sets in and overrides any progression in life.  I also tutored today.  I'm in a bit of a dilemma with the first student; he's a bit slow and has trouble in school.  I'm still trying to figure out how to help the kid.  God, please work a miracle in this boy.  Just like the one that I need, too.  I have to decide to go forth into a direction unknown.  Maybe I shall go back to science.  Maybe I shall go get a job.  Maybe I'll go into music.  The same old maybe's still linger; I wish I can get a more cohesive, comprehensive goal to pursue.

      "Don't let the bastards grind you down"  - Bono, from the song "Acrobat"  I must have written six posts about this song, but here I am again, recalling the lyrics:  "I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that"  as well as:  "Yeah, I'd take bread and wine If there was a church that I could receive in  'Cause I need it now To take the cup To fill it up, to drink it slow I can't let you go"  So I've been like this song, wavering in life, talking one way but acting another, hoping one thing, but finding another.  My first goal is to find a goal to pursue, a vision to hold.  What steps do I take to find these things?  To my consternation, I don't know.  All I can do is pray and hope that God will lead me there through my hobbies or feelings or whatever.  My other goals are a bit vague, and I hope to hammer them out.  I want to develop as an artist: in musical, visual and digital technique; in emotional maturity; and in deep, rigorous philosophy.  But what do these entail?  When will I ever be satisfied with my development?  I also want to know God in the deepest and most satisfying way, so that I can be deeply satisified in life.  However, It feels like I'm just drifting away from that.  I wish I can express it through commercially viable and accessible means.  But is that too hard to do?  Is that an inherently flawed idea?  Should I just go back into science and leave all of my art interests to slowly develop over the years as a hobby, instead of their rapid development that would come from a career in the arts?  How can I combine the two:  interdisciplinary fields like architecture?  writing?  music? installation art?  People wonder why I have a hard time finding a job, why I left grad school.  The past confusing paragraphs should answer their inquiries.

      My goodness, I had forgetten how much I love the song "New Year's Day," by U2.  Today, I went to NYC and hung out with an old college friend.  I caught "The Triplets of Belleville," and loved it.  I also tried to get stuff for my guitar and a new bag, but ended up getting an MD player that stores mp3s.  Ate at Lombardi's, again.  During the evening, I went to Kim (last name, Situ?)'s birthday, and met some new people from Remnant.  Fun stuff.  Funniest sight:  I saw a guy carrying a live DUCK wearing a mini Green Bay packers helmet.  The guy looked really angry and stern in his Green Bay jacket, while the duck confusedly looked around the subway terminal.  Weird.  It took me a while to get home.  I tried out the NetMD player, and found this product to be extremely problematic.  Once again, Sony hasn't surprised me in showing how ridiculous they are.  It says on the box that it can play mp3s and wmas, but I realized now that it simply converts it to ATRAC, the proprietary MD sound format.  It makes it extremely difficult to transfer mp3s to the MD player, it slows down the transfer process due to the conversion time, you CAN'T UPLOAD your own recordings using this faster interface, and you MUST use their proprietary software to transfer music.    Boo on all counts, Sony.  What would have been good?  Well, it would have been good to simply enable your MD player to decode mp3s, wav's, and wma's directly, like most MP3 players on the market.  It would have been good to simply make the MD player like a portable drive, so that it can have more uses than music, just like most mp3 players on the market.  It would have been good to not require the use of the proprietary software, but no, I guess you have to protect the best interests of your music industry division.  I have fully legal mp3s, backed up from my CD collection, and you make it very hard to get it onto the discs.  Boo.  Didn't Sony learn from the Beta disaster?  Why are they so overprotective and conservative?  Why not adapt the MD disc to hold normal data?  It's killing them because their products aren't so great anymore.  I still need this, but they sure screwed up this time.  I sure screwed up this time, with this purchase.  I got too excited with the prospects of a cheaper alternative to iPod and etc, and of using my old MD player materials and discs.  Greedy, is more like it, and I really got ahead of myself with this impulsive, unwise, and bad buy.  Shame, I have a lot of lessons to learn from this day.

I am the grasshopper that couldn't sit down and focus, that couldn't resist the temptations of instant gratification.  I have paid the price for the past years, but then again, it's time to move on.  I've been so caught up with wanting to be a great musician and performer, but to be honest, I haven't done any of the hard work that it takes to be such things.  Wake up call, yet again.

      Here are two articles that I read this past weekend that deeply moved me.  It's been a pretty harsh week of facing the reality of myself and it's not been pretty.   urlLink This first article  is short and deep.  God, please let me live this out.  I read it while waiting for my car oil change last Thursday.   urlLink This second artlicle  is quite a bit longer, but much more hard-hitting.  It really spoke to me, and I hope it does to you as well.  Both articles are taken from  urlLink www.desiringgod.org .  ****  What a hard-hitting week.  God kept telling me that I am arrogant, and it's time to let go:  1) My mother had a four hour talk with me about it, because it's pretty much at the core of many of my issues.  I'm too depressed and frustrated in my heart partially because "I think I am so much above than what I'm doing right now, and I'm unhappy as a result."  2) My tutoring didn't go as well as it should have due to overconfidence in myself.  I got lazy.  3) I spoke off my mouth at a small group I attended last Thursday.  I had this uncontrollable urge to say what I had to say because I felt it would be deep.  But really, I didn't place much thought into my words as I should have.  Regardless, I appreciated my time there, and I received a list of God's promises in the Bible.  My soul craves for these verses, and I don't even know it.  4) A speaker at  urlLink my friend's church  happened to speak on humility, and focused on pride.  Ouch.  The worship leader briefly mentioned that we should put of boasting in anything but Jesus.  Double ouch.  I asked God to help me with this.  5) During my teacher's meeting today, I spoke out of strong emotion over something I felt my pastor was doing wrong.  But it didn't come out correctly and I lost my train of thought.  It ultimately stemmed from a sanctimonious attitude.  To think, I had just heard a message the day before about humility, and here I was, shooting my mouth off.  There's much more subtext going on that won't fit in this entry, but let's just say I have a very bad attitude towards the church I go to every Sunday.  I think I have to apologize to the pastor.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do next.  It's time to go back to the start, I suppose.

      "The  horror , the  horror "  I taught my first Kaplan class today, and it felt horrible.  The students were cool, but during the middle my mind blanked on a question, and I stood there confused.  The enusing silence felt like a blowtorch heating my face; it felt as Brando uttered at the end of Apocalypse Now: "the  horror , the  horror ."  By the end of the class, I could tell by their faces and fidgeting that I had lost them.  In due fashion, I castigated myself for it.  But something strange happened; unlike before, something inside reminded me that self-critique should never become self-criticism.  Why do I keep killing myself for my mistakes, instead of learning from them?  Why do I let the stupidest mistakes/cracks cascade into huge, debilitating earthquakes?  Many different reasons come to mind, but I think what matters is that this pattern changes.  Something strong has to take root into the core of my heart, so that the slightest gust of wind won't crush me.  Something strong must take root so that I may stop:  1) Killing myself for mistakes instead of learning from them,  and start:  2) Learning and living life by doing and practicing, not by theorizing and postulating.   Jesus, be that rock.  I don't know how in the world you can be the foundation of my heart, I don't know what such highly abstract things mean.  But I do know that You promise it, that somehow You'll bring it to pass.  Please, then, by all means, then, become my foundation.

      "Weak Will"  Will, discipline perserverance, the strength to work hard in face of dislike or pain.  These are things of which I have very little reserve.  When placed in an environment where everyone around me has those things, I actually develop some sense of those things.  But even in those times, I would be lazy and unfocused, not willing to go the extra mile to keep my focus.  It's when I'm not in such environment where my true colors show.  I don't have the self-motivation to pursue things that require long term faithfulness to seemingly doldrum activities: working out, a rigorous guitar/singing practice regimen, studying to truly learn a subject, drawing, building a career.  It's a life-long history of walking away from challenges instead of facing them;  I just can't seem to do what I "ought" to live up to my potential.  Man loves to construe that doing what we "ought" in the face of what we don't want as a badge of morality.  Some even say that if we force ourselves to  want  to do what we ought, we come through even cleaner.  But I can't seem to do either.  Dagnammit, I just don't have the will!  I posted an article earlier that explores these options, then posits asking Jesus to supply it.  And since then, I've been asking Him, and have continually encountered parts of the Bible exhorting me to rejoice in God, in my salvation, in Jesus.  After all of this, the familiar, critical thoughts still keep coming.  Do I really have as much potential as I think?  If I really applied myself, and worked hard, would I match it?  Why can't I have the will?  Doesn't my lack of will indicate that I don't really have potential?  The feelings come in:  frustration, jealousy of others, annoyance.  But with the encouragement of that article, I'm faced with a new thought that says,   So what? Put Your hope in God.  If you really believe that Jesus was/is real, that the salvation happened exactly as the Bible says, that reality is explained by this text, then you have the leverage to trust in God .  "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding.  In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight."  So, I see my failings, and I try to understand them, but it's time now to trust in what God's doing and stick it out.  I have no idea what it means to trust in the Lord, but I guess I'll continue ask Jesus to supply that idea.

       urlLink An interesting site on racism .  Isn't it funny that we dismiss others when we think we know them or see their faults?  Why do we try to gain a sense of superiority and confidence by highlighting others' imperfections and differences?  Ther's a weird smugness inside when I find myself doing it.  I have to let go, I have to try to find my righteousness in God, in Christ.  Oh, I wish this could be a real habit, not an incomprehensible ideal.

       I installed  urlLink this device  a friend gave me a couple of weeks ago into my car.  I find, in the  urlLink page's technical explanation  of the device, that the term "turbulence" is slightly off.  It works off the supposedly well-tested theory that rotationally spinning air combusts better within engines.  I'm not sure if it really works though; I do notice that car has a lower idle and is slightly punchier with acceleration.  It hasn't hurt much, although fuel economy seems lower.  It seems to me that it'd work better in non-fuel injected cars.  I took it out today to see what would happen after a couple of tanks in this cold weather without it, compared to the past couple of tanks with it.  I'll get back with the results later.  But after reading  urlLink this close analysis , I'm suspect.   urlLink Here is the link  to the patent for it online.  As for  urlLink this device, the Tornado Fuel Saver  or any similar product (like " urlLink the Turbonator "; or " urlLink SpiralMax ", which doesn't even have professional schematics... they're all hand drawn sketches!!!),  urlLink this forum thread  shows it to be a poorer implementation of the theory.  This forum thread also contains some pretty interesting ideas about the whole swirling air theory.  I found  urlLink this fuel saver  device to be hysterical.  "The magnetic field breaks of clusters of hydrocarbon[s in the gas] for more complete burning."  What a load of CRAP!  Carbon chains won't be affected by such a weak magnet.  Who thought of this idea?!  Finally, here is  urlLink a skeptical article  debunking most of these devices, and  urlLink the Federal Trade Commission site  on the subject.  They're very thorough and I hope this convinces you not to spend money on these things; good thing I got mine for free.

      As you can tell, I'm starting to teach myself more about web development.  More changes will keep coming from now on.  I might start posting a mini art gallery.
