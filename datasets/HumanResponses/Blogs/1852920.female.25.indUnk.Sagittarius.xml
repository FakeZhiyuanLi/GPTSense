      my good pal sara and i met at beaner's today to do some studying, but we spent an inordinate amount of time planning how we would pay for things until we get our next financial aid disbursement. in true chubby-kid style, i was most concerned about food. apparently i'm not very pleasant when i'm hungry...  but the point here is not that i am ornery when i haven't been fed, it's that i am in med school and have quite enough to worry about without having to obsess about whether or not i'll have to eat ramen noodles for the next four weeks. um, excuse me, but are my classes too easy? do i have too much free time? is there some reason that the financial aid office believes that this is what i actually WANT to do with my life?! last time i checked, i was married, living on my own, and doing just fine. i'd like the money that the federal government has seen fit to award me, because it's MINE. in the meantime, it's going to be an interesting juggling act to pay the bills that have the lowest late fees and pray that we still have electricity and a telephone.   can i also just point out that people complain a great deal about how much doctors get paid? i will have monthly loan payments in excess of $1000 for at least 15 years. and i'll be making an astounding $35,000 per year as a resident, half of which will be immediately returned for taxes. so that leaves me maybe $6000 per year to live on. that's almost low enough to qualify for food stamps. i'll be the first doctor to get welfare. and for this, i am suffering through four more years of school torture and emotional distress and physical self-abuse.   time to go empty out the piggy bank so i can buy some milk.

      i just got off the phone with an old friend from the college years. we decided that our friendship has lasted and we've remained close because we aren't clingy. we don't get pissed off at each other if i don't call her back right away, i don't get mad if she takes a few days to return my emails. also, we can see each other once or twice a year and it's like no time has passed. we come together as the people we are today--not the people we were when we stopped going to college together. ALL of the friends i've kept from college and earlier share this same quality. already this year, i've run across people who weren't happy with what i was willing to offer in a friendship--the "give an inch, they'll take a mile" types. particularly one person, who violated nearly every boundary that i've always taken care to respect in my friendships. and it's not like i'm a lazy friend in general. i think i'm pretty fiercely loyal; i.e. would take the bullet (or pop a couple of caps in some asses) to care for my friends.   so this old friend and i decided that the key is to drop the crazy people like a hot potato. you can't reason with them, they're not living in the same reality as the rest of us, and they're usually manipulative, passive-aggressive, or both. i came to that same conclusion with a small congress of my med school friends, so it must be true. heh.

      i've been on the clock for exactly fifty-one minutes, and have managed to eat my lunch as well as raid the fridge in the neurology office, check my email, and contribute another entry to my blog. it's raining outside, and it's a damn good day for a nap, but i think i'll stick it out for another hour so's i can get paid. it's not that there's nothing to do, on the contrary there are several chunky mountains for me to scale. i lack motivation, is the problem. that's pretty much the root of a majority of my problems. and then there's my brief attention span. i think i might be suffering from adult-onset attention deficit disorder. forty-five minutes seems to be the upper limit of what i can actively pay attention to without having a break. and some fucking einstein on the curriculum planning committee (perhaps  several  fucking einsteins!) thought that nine hours of sitting on my ass next tuesday (and every day for several weeks following) was going to be an effective way to convey large amounts of complicated material. tune-out will probably officially occur at 9:30 am on tuesday, leading to quite a lot of wasted class time for me. sometimes i feel like coffee helps me pay attention, but i think it might only make me pay more attention to the coffee and nothing else.

      all the cool kids are doing it.   but, as the parents say, if sara jumped off a bridge, would you jump too?   now, the thought of drowning is unpleasant, but the thought of studying alone and paying off all my school debt besides is frightful and certainly cause for considering a "group jump" of sorts.  the delightful thing is that i am currently raking in the cash (probably around the amount of $2) in the time it takes me to write.   ok. it's cold as dante's hell in this office, and sara and i are seeking warmer climes.

      oh, man. just took a horrifying quiz, which i'm sure is one of my choicest performances to date. i will be pleased--PLEASED--to pull a 60%. dr. lehman has an unhealthy love of fungi, and i have a healthy hatred for both dr. lehman  and  the fungi.

      okay, okay. it's been a long time since my last post. it's not that nothing interesting has happened, it's just that i'm lazy and tired and lazy. right now i'm trying to post a message and arguing with dave about how he believes that he satisfies koch's postulates as the causative agent for bad relationships. i believe that he is just cosmically unlucky, but he claims that he would have better odds of winning the lottery. abundantly untrue, if you ask me. do you know how  unlikely  you are to win the lottery?! so dave has decided that since he satisfies koch's postulates, he must be a  true  pathogen. wonder if that's anything like a  true  friend...   i have also decided that mycology is not interesting enough to actively incorporate into my future practice, other than the occasional jock itch and candidiasis. and i am a bit leery about eating mushrooms for a while, which is tragic, since mushrooms are so lovely.  okay, that's enough for now. yo tengo hambre (that's "i'm hungry" for all you gringos) and i think i am going to eat.

      today i bought a whole lot of squash. it was so cheap, and so tantalizing. how, you may ask, can one be tantalized by squash? i believe that it is because of the sheer possibility that the squash represents. there are  thousands  of ways to cook squashes--many of them are cheap, and all are full of regularity-producing fiber. so right now my stomach is growling, the spaghetti squash is cooking in the oven, and i'm already thinking of ways to cook the butternut squash i also purchased. and another thing is that squash are representative of my favorite time of year. i truly relish autumn.  not a bad day, all in all. classes were long and only marginally interesting, but i definitely had jesus sitting next to me for the quiz yesterday, since i managed to extract a passing grade from a truly dismal set of circumstances. i wonder how jody did, if jesus was sitting next to  me ? was he simultaneously next to her? did he give her more right answers than he gave me? maybe he likes her better because she didn't work in an abortion clinic this summer. i guess i'll never know.

      you all need to go see the movie "once upon a time in mexico". it's the new robert rodriguez film, the third installment of the "el mariachi", "desperado" trilogy. it was fucking excellent, and extremely funny. don't go if you have a problem with lots of people getting shot and/or blown up, though. the body count was impressive.   i felt kinda normal tonight. james and i went out to dinner for his birthday, then to a movie. it was so... suburban. it's like we  have  the money to go to dinner and a movie. made me nostalgic about college life a little.   had dinner at fred's house last night. salvaged a tomato sauce that was nearly sabotaged by charred garlic. drank a great deal of wine in the process. enjoyed the time with my friends, and got a chance to talk with a classmate that i had never really spent time with before. turns out he's way cool. much of the time was spent in our favorite pursuit as of late--bitching about financial aid. you'd think we'd get tired of it, but we never seem to derive anything but unabashed joy from discussing the intrigues of kathryn coy and company. makes me temporarily forget that i have to spend every spare minute studying.  off to bed. i just realized that my mouth is lolling open as i type. probably that means that i am exceedingly tired.

      isn't it enough that i have to pay bills that i get in the mail? now i'm expected to read minds and pay bills that i never received. i got a nasty email today from one of the student accounts stooges about how i'm going to have late charged posted to my account for a $108.00 charge that i never paid. i must pay this amount because i am not willing to settle for substandard health care, in light of my propensity for accidents. a few of my classmates who also elected to purchase the "enhanced plan" had received bills via mail, while i had not. i figured that they were still processing the paperwork, in true MCO fashion. apparently i was supposed to use my clairvoyant powers to know that they had, in fact, processed my forms and that i owed them $108.00. and so that brings us to the snippy email from sue kiel of the student accounts department.   my list of grievances:  1. i don't have any money. 2. no one will give me the money that the government said i could have. 3. no one will listen to why i need said money in a timely fashion.  4. they think i'm psychic. 5. they think that i should pursue THEM in order to hand over money that i don't have. 6. they act like it's MY fault that i don't have money, can't read minds, and won't take the initiative to give away my money.  student accounts has officially been added to my list of Offices that can Suck My Dick. (also included: financial aid, bollinger insurance's claims office, and the DMV, to name a few.)  that was rather therapeutic.

      what can i say except thank god for friends? (and i don't mean the situation comedy, though that's good too.) today was a long day and not the most pleasant that i can remember. things that should have made me thoroughly happy (blowing money at sam's club, eating good food, wandering around meijer) kind of just took the edge off of a lingering depression/agitation that i've had for two weeks now. i know that it takes me a while to adapt to stresses such as the resumption of classes, but i feel like i'm running at the stress level that i was at the end of the school year last may. maybe i'm starting to settle in, but it's for damn sure taking long enough. my temper is shorter than usual, and i've never been known for my patience. also, i feel like everyone's always out to get me, which may or may not be god's honest truth, depending upon whom you ask.   so anyway, i was sitting at dinner with dave, sara, ryan and james, and then it hit me: i could be doing this  alone . i could be looking at a whole week, month, year of classes and drudgery and not have anyone to listen to me complain. my emotional breakdowns could be by myself, as could my little victories. i  could  have no one to count on but me.  but this is where i am so goddamn lucky. my friends (my wonderful husband included) will absolutely not permit me to go it alone. even when i need to be by myself, they know when to check up and make sure that i'm okay. and perhaps we piss each other off after extended periods of sleep-deprived time together, but i always go to bed knowing that we have more than can be destroyed by "PMS week" or "testosterone poisoning".   so the moral of the story is that i have to take care of my friendships, since i count on my posse for more than just a good time. so here's a shout out to my kids--y'all are the reason that i'm not in the psych ward by now.

      school is sucking the life out of me. hitherto, my blog posts will be shorter.   just want to shout out to ryan, for putting me in his blog. and to sara, for being my most favorite wise-ass friend and all around amazing and fun person. and also to dave, for (among other things) lending me $3 to fund my drug habit. oh yeah, and he's a wonderful listener as well.  :)  back to class. poo.

      so it's been a while, but things are better lately. i still harbor a burning desire to throttle dr. lehman and his spores (did i mention that he managed to work THREE photos of butts into his lecture today?), but i feel generally more placid and happy with my life. i'm taking a bit of a break this evening to write in the ol' blog and maybe dye my hair. i never thought i would be the kind of person that dyes their hair once a month. never did i imagine that it would bring me so much joy to have hair of an unholy, unnatural hue that oscillates on a quarterly basis. this is my second month of Hydrience "Tropic", which is a lovely shade of burgundy. i have to keep it for now, since i am in a wedding on november 1. dave tried to convince me to go with black, but i'm not sure how i will pull off the goth look. i said that i would dye  my  hair black if  he  bleaches his pale blonde. he chickened out.  :)  james and i have been able to spend more quality time together lately, even if it's an hour before i fall asleep on top of my books and notes. this whole marriage thing is wonderful, but it takes a lot of work to make a good marriage. not that i expected it to be easy. it seems to be one of those things that it would have been difficult to understand without experiencing it--like having kids or being in med school. it's one of the best decisions i've ever made, though. my husband is my lighthouse in the middle of this whole med school hurricane.

      just a shout out to my thugs, sara and dave. you guys rock, and i don't know if i tell you both enough that i wouldn't be able to do this whole "med school" thing without all y'all.   i will totally agree to the gold chains and gold teeth thing, by the way. if i don't get to the dentist soon, i might need to get all gold teeth anyway. then we can be the MCO thugs, for real.  i love you two, from the koechels of my heart.

      i'm taking a break from trying to get the free drugs for the neuro patients. it feels good to work, since i know that there's going to be a finished product at the end of the day; i.e. the patients will get the medications they need. also, the work isn't exactly mindbending, so i am rather free to consider other topics while i work. i'm listening to a CD with some james taylor, some U2, some barenaked ladies. relaxing but not the most energizing music. kristen just told me to close the door and take a nap, but i think i would rather try to muscle through the work and then nap at home. i don't think the carpet in here EVER gets vacuumed, and my carpet at home gets vacuumed at least once a month. maybe.  i feel like nothing interesting has happened lately, except that i scheduled my board exam (june 10--and in spite of bitch-ass! [see www.tigerlily46.blogspot.com for more on bitch-ass]) and am already formulating a Plan. By the time it actually comes time to study for the boards, i am going to have the whole thing down to a nazi precision of which the fuhrer would be proud. and since my two best friends are also anal retentive in their own delightful and special ways, i think we will run like a well-oiled machine. stay out of the way of nervous medical students with a Plan.  back to the drugs. if i had to wait extra time for my aricept or neurontin because some smart-ass medical student was being paid to write in her blog, i'd be  pissed . off i go to push the papers.

      i think that being a good friend sometimes means taking on the pain of your friends, knowing that you'll probably be around to share their eventual happiness as well. i also think that to be a good physician, you have to be one of those people who willingly accepts some of the suffering of others in order to feel truly invested in life and the process of living. there are times when i feel so helpless, though. i want to believe that there is always  something  i can do, and it's especially devastating when i know that there is little to nothing that can be done and that i have to leave someone exactly as i found them.  i don't know what i'm saying, really. it's late and i'm tired and it's been a long day.   i will say, as a final thought, that i am blessed to have the friends that i have. a more dynamic, talented, and compassionate group of people would be difficult to find.

      what a weekend. ran interference between my dear friend amanda and her nutsy mom (why, WHY, can't people just be happy that their kid finds a great spouse and wants to make a commitment?! why the drama all the time?), tried to keep a slippery satin wrap around my shoulders while carrying two weighty bouquets of flowers and a large tote bag, and ate as much food as would fit into my stomach, which was compressed by my "belly-sucker-inner" Magic Underwear. what could be more fun than a wedding, i ask? really, it was beautiful, and amanda and jon are in love and it's a marvelous thing to behold. her family's a little much, is all.  james and i got to spend some quality time together, amid all the confusion. there's just something about getting dressed up--no matter how tired i was after a full day of dealing with Bride + Momzilla, it made me happy and thrilled that i was next to my sexy husband, and that we were both looking good and feeling great.   so now, back to reality. being a princess gets old after a few days, anyway.

       resolutions   sara and i have decided on two exciting and beneficial new year's resolutions, in the time-honored tradition of trying to improve oneself at the start of the new calendar year. besides the usual "going to the gym, eating better, don't want to be a fat bride/bridesmaid, la la la..." we are pursuing the following two plans:   1. the Floss-Off  we decided in a discussion on the way home from detroit that while our hygeine is nearly impeccable, we both need to floss more than the sporadic treatment we give our interdental spaces at the present time. and so the Floss-Off! (idea courtesy of maya and steve, the original Floss-Offers.) sara and i have vowed to floss daily, and the loser (the one who misses a day first) will buy a brand new lipstick for the winner, to help her show off her shiny white teeth and healthy gums. we feel that this improvement in oral care will mitigate the fact that we cannot afford regular dental care. prevention, man.   2. Word of the Day  we also feel that our vocabularies are stagnant, excepting those medically-related words that we cannot use in polite conversation. hence the  Word of the Day , a schedule that we determine ahead of time, consisting of one new (or rarely utilized) vocabulary word each day. we will practice the word in context at least three times per day, hoping to integrate the word into our working vocabularies. additionally, we are organizing the words by theme, so as to increase the likelihood that we will be able to use them when appropriate situations arise.  Por ejemplo , one day out of the week will be dedicated to words that describe people we don't like. we should be able to get some really good use out of those words. keep those fifty cent words coming, i say.  and yes, we are giant nerds. yes, we got totally excited about picking out a bunch of words to learn. yes, i bought two new kinds of dental floss and already tried out one of them today. and yes, we will be the women with the cleanest mouths and the best vocabularies in all of toledo. maybe all of ohio.   happy new year!

       "because she was MEAN as SHIT!"   i had the most f-ing cool time today. sara and i bummed around southeast michigan for most of the afternoon and evening. i met her totally delightful family (including her dad, who was on his best behavior) and got to have some drinks at the bowling alley with her grandmother, great aunt, and mom. i was also delighted to learn that her little brother's smile is as fetching in real life as it is in photos.   in case you might be wondering, the title of the blog entry comes from a story about sara's granny, who locked her own grandmother (sara's great-great grandmother) in the outhouse at the family farm. when asked why granny would do such a thing, she issued the above proclamation. granny is one sassy lady. i liked her  immediately .   another fun thing i did today (much to sara's dismay) was to purchase another piece of orange clothing--a shirt from the gap outlet that is a stunning shade of orange. not even close to the innocuous pumpkin orange that i had the guts to buy a few weeks ago. construction-barrel orange. hoo ha.  we didn't end up seeing dave today because he was not receiving visitors for whatever reason. fine. i think it stinks that we haven't been able to hang out AT ALL over break, and i am sad that we will all start school and not have any free time to spend for a while. especially when the you-know-what hits the fan for board exams. i miss him and i get the distinct feeling that he doesn't want to see either me or sara and it's not just because he's sick. so i don't know. dude, if it's something i/we did, tell me/us, okay?   boys.  *sigh*  wish i didn't like them so much.

       legolas and aragorn are  foxy    saw "the lord of the rings: return of the king" last night. it was excellent. i am a certifiable A-1 nerd, because all i could think about when it ended was when i would get to go see it again. three and a half hours flew by and i didn't even notice. if only three and a half hours of classes could be so wonderful.   sara and i are going up to detroit today, although the detroit institute of arts is closed on mondays  and  tuesdays. how does a museum stay in business if it's closed on two weekdays?! in lieu of culture, we'll take capitalism. i think we'll stop at the gap outlet, drive around sara's old hood, and stop to see dave. that is, of course, unless he's too busy moping to want to see us. *sigh* i think it might be a man thing to disappear for a few weeks and then wonder why the women are worried. and also think it is funny that the women are worried. perhaps i'll have to start thinking like a man before i start to worry. i had all these apocalyptic visions of dave being sucked in by the vortex. and then last night, both of sara's phones were disconnected. i totally thought that the vortex had gotten my two best friends and that i was going to be stuck in school with the Bitch and the Beast. the thought sends cold fear up my spine.  good thing everyone is okay.  :)

       post-holiday blahs   i'm going back to toledo tomorrow. part of me can't wait to get out of my parents' house, and part of me knows that my destination is, in many ways, far less appealing than my current location. i am pleased that i have not only added links to my blog, but i also figured out how to replace the "comments" feature that i blasted off my blog when i reformatted. i am anxiously awaiting conversation with my long-lost pals, dave and sara. where the heck are ya', kids?  james and i bought a digital camera, and i can't wait to figure out how to use the damn thing. hopefully we'll be able to afford a new printer sometime in the near future, so we can actually make prints of the pictures we take. we got enough best buy certificates to pay for almost the entire thing--the only thing we bought was an extra memory card so we can take like, a million pictures or something.   i am also pleased that i was able to see so many of my friends. amy, you are SO not a jackass, don't worry about splitting the chicken finger cost. you can buy me a beer next time i'm in cleveland. also went to lunch with amanda, to the "quaker steak and lube". we got to sit underneath a corvette chassis and eat our chicken wings. it was very cool. neil is visiting tonight--he and james are playing with the new camera and talking about artsy things, like NPR and bjork.  i feel a great deal better than i did a few days ago. i am even looking forward to cleaning up the apartment, in a post-holiday blah sort of way.

       family unity and the curse of the board game   i'm biding my time, trying to see how long i can go without being forced to participate in the frenzy of the board games going on downstairs in my parents' house. i am tired, feeling a little antisocial, and i just really want to watch TV and maybe take a little nap. instead, my grandfather is watching john wayne movies at a volume comparable only to the 311 blaring out of my brother damien's room. perhaps i have used up all my pleasantry for the day. my mother insinuated that my participation was mandatory, should i wish to see any complementary items in our review of the post-christmas sales. she's already cursing at my father because he isn't giving good enough clues in "catch phrase". it is MY damned vacation, and if i want to lay on the sofa like the depressed sack of crap that i am, i'm going to do it, dammit! i want everyone to leave and i don't want to talk with anyone. i am  tired . i want to read a book in front of the fire. and i can't, for any number of reasons.   i hope your christmases are merrier than mine.

       free time + internet connection = regular, asinine blog postings   attention all women: go see "mona lisa smile". not only was it an excellent, thought provoking film with a great female cast, it also allowed for some cathartic get-out-the-holiday-stress weeping. sara and i saw it with tori, her husband todd, and tori's mom. highly recommended. sara and i went for a beer and some cigarettes afterwards, but we first had to make a detour to the coinstar machine at kroger. for those of you who have never been destitute enough to make the acquaintance of a coinstar machine, here's a short tutorial: you take all the change in your apartment, wherever it might be, you put it in a plastic bag and take it to the machine, and then pour it in this tray that allows the coins to feed through the machine. the magic money machine counts your coins, then prints you a voucher for the money after taking a hefty 8.9 cents on every dollar. it sure beats the pants off of counting it yourself. you take the voucher to the customer service desk, and voila! you get the money. it's pretty neat, if you're poor.   so the point of the story is that there was a  bullet  in the coinstar machine. not a shell, but a live bullet intended for a 9mm luger (and i knew that because dangerous diane has utilized a 9mm handgun...  thanks to dave for being my shooting range pal). so basically this means that someone with a pocketful of change for the coinstar machine also had a pocketful of live ammunition. i will be very nice to people at that kroger from now on. there are some crazy motherfuckers out there.

       Register This!   ladies and gentlemen, you are reading the blog of a criminal. apparently i've been driving on illegal license plates for a year and a half, and i spent three days last week driving on an expired license. i guess when you transfer a car title, you also have to get the plates transferred, and you can't do it all in one place. of course, you can't do it  at all  if no one tells you that you need to. so i was supposed to read the mind of the clerk at the title bureau and just  know  that i needed to take the new title to the  license  bureau and have the plates transferred. ah, the joys of bureaucracy. so anyway, no one told me then, and no one told me the last time i had the registration renewed. AND, i was pulled over for speeding last may and had my plates run by the highway patrolman, and  he  didn't say anything. so just when was someone going to inform me of my infraction?!  i feel...dangerous. like a criminal. who knows how long i could have continued my spree? i'll always wonder.

      aargh! i feel as though i have crashed into a brick wall. previously, i was driving my hot sports car dangerously at 150 MPH, winding around the mountain roads, noticing how the cool headlights turned as i went around the corners, then BAM! here i am, plastered to a wall, my hot sexy little fast car in ruins.   perhaps that's a poor analogy. the speed is accurate--school keeps me moving almost every minute of every day. this happens every break. all i can think about during the last week of classes is how great it's going to be to be able to sit around on my ass. and then, when i actually have time to sit on my ass, i am so goddamn bored that i can hardly see straight. it doesn't help that we don't have cable (it's pretty easy to exhaust six channels worth of TV) and it also doesn't help that this is the MOST time i've spent alone in months. i literally have not been alone for more than a few hours at a time. i wish i could say that i relish the alone time, but it was only fun for about an afternoon. and now i am bored, i miss my friends, and i wish i had some money to do something cool or buy something fun for myself. also, i have noticed that cleaning the apartment sounds a great deal more appealing when there is studying to be done. now, when i have time, i don't fucking care. piles of clothes? fuck 'em. mountains of papers? fuck 'em. leaning towers of books? fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em. heh.  my consolation is that i finally get to spend some time with james, but he works full time and so i have at least 8 waking hours in which to be bored every single day. for two weeks. sara is coming back to toledo tomorrow, thank god. neither one of us have any money, but at least we can window shop together. and maybe cook things. and then we'll go feed dave's fish, so they don't die while he is back in the greater detroit area. i think i will brainwash the fish while he is gone. i'll have them doing my bidding in no time, really. hee hee ha ha.

       A Christmas Story   imagine a christmas scene: diane, sitting in a booth at panera, in the midst of a nervous breakdown about the impending organ systems exam. in her despair she's crying, and wonderful dave, tori and nikki are offering their comfort and care. the moment passes, diane resolves to continue studying and not drive off a bridge (as previously threatened), and she opens her binder to continue the joy of autonomic pharmacology. then, out of nowhere, a woman appears, with red rhinestoned glasses. she leans over the table and says that she notices that i appear to be having a difficult day. she hands diane a panera gift card and says to enjoy the next lunch, and that she hopes things improve. then, as quickly as she appeared, the woman with the rhinestone glasses is gone.  my friends, sometime this week (when things are hectic and stressful and maybe not what this time of year is all about) stop to consider the angels that walk among us.

      i have the best friends  ever . dave and sara know just when i need socks with monkeys on them, and bath products, and sushi. a crappy day of studying could have been a whole lot crappier if i were alone for the long haul. sara and dave, my friends and partners in crime. wholeheartedly, i love you both.  thanks for today.

      something is wrong with me this week, and i don't know if it's just hormones, or if it has to do with stress and fatigue and residual illness in addition to the hormones. my 25th birthday is this sunday and, while i understand that i am not actually  old , i  feel  old. my father told me (jokingly, of course) that one-third of my life could be over. probably i'd like more than 50 more years. it's silly to be sad about being 25 and it's ludicrous to think about my life as 1/3 over (glass half empty, anyone?) but every time i have a spare 5 minutes to myself, i feel like i want to cry. i think it's everything taken together, and it's just more than i want on my plate right now. what i'd like is some gingerbread, and maybe some whipped cream on top of it. that's what i would appreciate on my plate.

      sara wisely made the observation that the ads at the top of the blog page relate to the content of the latest post. so mine are for vicodin and neurontin, the last time i checked. i talked about a respiratory infection in my last post, so whomever is reading the blogs and deciding on the ads must think that these are appropriate treatments for your average cough/cold illness.  news flash , blog ad people: unless you have respiratory-infection-induced seizures and a need for opiates, there is really no reason to take either vicodin or neurontin for a cold. so please, if you use my blog for ad space, be as accurate as possible. take tylenol cold and feel like you're stoned without all the fun of being stoned.

      so last night was the med school prom--the "medicine ball". i had a great time, despite the untimely development of a nasty respiratory infection by the end of the night. i looked good, james looked good, all my friends were totally hot, and i got to do some dancin'. i like when everyone gets dressed up, not just because i enjoy looking cute, but also for the completely bitchy fact that some people are giant fashion "don'ts" and i like to admire the perfectly horrendous attire of others. back fat + stringy-backed dress = fashion don't. chunky legs + obscenely short skirt = fashion no-no. dark nipples + see-through shirt - bra = not so much. this is the poor attire mathematics lesson for today, kids.  meow.

       Heaven for Pets   my hedgehog appears to be dying. he won't move, he hasn't eaten much, and his beautiful little beady eyes are all sunken into his head. i gave him his favorite--canned cat food--but he eats a bite or two then puts his precious face down into the food and sighs, as if he were too exhausted to move. he looks very tiny and weak.   he looks like he hurts. i have been crying off and on for the last hour, thinking about him and hoping that he's not in pain. i told james, cried about it to him, then called my mom and did the same thing. i almost wish he would just die, so he doesn't have to feel pain or starve to death or suffocate or something. and there are no vets that see hedgehogs, so he and i are on our own until the bitter end.  i know that rodents don't live very long, and this is likely just his time to go. it doesn't make it any easier, though. (and now i am crying again as i type!) i loved to hold him and let him poke his little snout between my fingers to see what was going on outside the safe cradle of my hands. he used to sneeze and scare himself. he liked to make tunnels under the newspaper that lined his cage.  someone told me once that there is no heaven for pets. i think that's bullshit. i think pet spirits get to pass along to a plane of existence where they get to spend all their time doing the things they loved to do on earth. my hedgehog will eat all the cat food he can manage, tunnel in vast piles of newspaper, and recline in a giant warm nest of pine shavings for all eternity.

       Long Time No Blog   okay, okay. i have been lax about my blogging. things just haven't been very interesting lately, and i have felt busier than usual. unfortunately, i have always seemed to find enough time to stuff my face, so florine and i are going to have words this saturday morning when i go back to Fat Club. i will tell her that i am a stress eater and i've just been so damned hungry, but i have also taken up a new sport so she should get off my ass.   yes, folks. racquetball is the new activity o' the moment. i play with dave. heh heh. i play with dave. (i think i have regressed to pre-adolescence.) anyway, out of several games, i have won ONCE. whatever. he lives in constant fear of my prowess.  my mom, ever supportive, said that it doesn't surprise her that i don't win more often because i'm "not the fastest person". gosh, mom. thanks for reminding me that i run like a mack truck.   we have an exam on tuesday that i am NOT ready for. so what else is new. this weekend is going to be a giant suck-fest, and not the good kind. and i am so damned hungry. i walked past the leftovers from a grand rounds presentation and almost drooled in the boston market gravy.  gravy, people. i'm sick.

       A Man Holds Up A Kroger Wearing A Chicken Suit   that was the headline i just heard while checking my email. ain't toledo a fun place, y'all?   i am sick again, and debating whether or not to get a throat culture. we had a lecture about rheumatic fever today (a complication of strep throat) and it sufficiently freaked me out enough to consider braving the insurance nightmare to get a strep test. i'm a little apprehensive about utilizing my MCO health plan, since three different groups spent nine months trying to collect money from me for my broken finger. don't break a finger without health insurance--apparently your right pinky is worth over $1000 in cold hard cash.   speaking of cold hard cash, i finally got the financial aid money. most of it is gone or promised away, but maybe i'll have enough to buy some new workout pants at deb. with something saucy written across the butt.   time for a relaxing bath, and then an early bedtime. to hell with physiology books!

       fuck winter   i just spent a harrowing three and a half hours driving back from columbus through the Blizzard Of The Century or whatever the hell the alarmist weather forecasters called it. it sucked, people are fucking maniacs, i was tired, and everything was just goddamned white. this is some bullshit, and we have to go back to school tomorrow. AND the very same thing happened on the first day of school a few years ago. i hauled my happy ass back from cleveland to columbus, trudged my way through several feel of snow in subzero temperatures, and got to my classes only to find that half of my professors didn't show up. and fucking ohio state didn't cancel classes. bullshit.  on a happier note, i had a wonderful weekend with old friends. i got a chance to be extra social--i saw people i hadn't seen in over two years. tyler, sarah crabtree, patty, mel, rachel, adina, nate, shelley and vanessa all showed up to party with me. there were copious margaritas involved, as you might imagine. i am lucky to have such amazing and fascinating people in my life, who will take time to see me even after two years of absence.   i'm going to enjoy my last night of freedom until june 10 at 5:00 pm. perhaps i will watch a movie and paint my toenails.   sounds like a plan.

       Quitter   i hate when i have to quit things. i just wrote an email to the members of my acappella group, letting them know that i would be resigning the rest of the year. on the one hand i'm relieved--i'm not in med school to be a singer, it takes up a good deal of my time, and it's frustrating a lot of that time. on the other hand, i love to sing, i'm good at it, and i will miss some of the group members. i feel uneasy about what people will say tomorrow. i can't imagine that it won't ruffle some feathers. ah, well. since when have i been worried about ruffling feathers?  i still feel like a little part of my life is gone.

       The Need for Speed   i am astonishingly unmotivated. i am behind by at least eight lectures, my house looks like a toxic waste dump, i haven't paid any bills for too long a time, and i have a virtual Everest of laundry to do. all i want to do is sit on my lazy ass and watch television. so that's what i'm doing. and i ate some ice cream, to seal the deal.   i need a maid, a massage, a wealthy benefactor, and another bowl of ice cream. and sprinkle some methamphetamine on top.

       The School of Rock and Physical Diagnosis   i am listening to some led zeppelin as dave is trimming the chicken that we are putting in the stir-fry. he likes to try out his surgical skills on meats that are already dead. we practiced our physical diagnosis stuff today. it was quite a sight--tori, dave, sara and i, trying to transform dave's living room into an exam room. we had all our expensive medical equipment on the floor all around us, and we used the coffee table and the overstuffed chair to conduct the exams. let's just say that i love and trust my friends, and it was still kind of weird. i'm sure it will be even weirder to do the real thing on a stranger, so i should probably get used to moving breasts out of the way and feeling femoral pulses (in the groin area, for all you non-medical people who read my blog) in people that i know and love.  nothing much new here. passed the last exam, which was a gift. there were drugs on the test that i swear i've never heard of. this time will be better. yes. went to see "Lost in Translation" last night and LOVED it. what a bittersweet and beautiful film. i would highly recommend it, especially while it's back in the theaters.  you should check out this website, if you loathe dubya as much as i do: (thanks to amy!)  http://www.seeyageorge.com/

       Irish Cuisine Ain't Nothin' But Meat And Potatoes   to celebrate a holiday in which i have no personal involvement whatsoever, james and i hosted a st. patty's day get-together at our apartment. it was a blast--i bought two giant hunks of meat and cooked them corned-a-la-crock pot, accompanied by the usual potatoes, cabbage, soda bread, and guinness. we jammed ten people around our table, and took a little break from our generally sucky lives to enjoy the company of friends and beer. i didn't end up going out and getting smashed as i had originally thought i might, and that's most likely a good thing. today in class, it was easy to tell who had  really  celebrated the holiday. they either weren't there, or were looking a little green. ha ha. green. like for st. patrick's day. ha ha.  it's also easy to see that this is the first week back from break. instead of worrying about what i will study tonight, i am concerned about what is on television. i feel personally slighted by the fact that "jeopardy" was pre-empted by the crappy college basketball bull-shite. i'm not sure that there is another topic on the planet that i care less about. give me jeopardy, or give me death. i relish the opportunity to flex my "trivia muscles". the good thing is that "the apprentice" is on tonight. i hope they get rid of that jive turkey redheaded guy. what a punk.   Smile, Your Mom Was Pro-Life   amy, just read your blog. i fucking hate that bumper sticker, but i would advise against spray paint. instead, go for the articulate means of resistance. i saw a particularly witty defacement once-- it was a small sticker, carefully placed over the words "pro-life", so the whole bumper sticker read "smile, your mom was delicious".   save the spray paint for the people standing outside the clinics with the plastic fetuses and photoshop-enhanced images of 8 week old embryos with toothy grins on their millimeter-wide faces.   March For Women's Lives   if these anti-choice people really get your goat, consider coming to washington DC on april 25 to participate in the biggest pro-choice event  ever --the march for women's lives. me, a group of my med school friends, and thousands of other people who care about women's health and women's right to determine what happens to their bodies will be assembling on the national mall to send a message to our nation's leaders and to our fellow citizens. we will not be drawn back into a time when women were forced to visit illegal, often unsafe "clinics" to access the MOST COMMON surgical procedure in the united states. women have ALWAYS had abortions, but we haven't always had  safe  abortions. many of the people whom i love and respect have had abortions, and i probably only know about a fraction of them. you, too, know women who have had abortions, whether you acknowledge it or not. the question is: will you stand with these women to protect our access to a basic medical procedure? do you care enough about the grave consequences of criminalizing a relatively minor surgery, that you would become involved in an effort to maintain its legality? how long before your best friend, your sister, your girlfriend, your wife, or you need access to abortion?   how important will it be  then ?  http://www.marchforwomen.org

       American Idolatry   i love my friends. we are sitting in dave's apartment, waiting for our 10:00 pm pizza binge to come out of the oven, just finished watching "american idol". we were flipping through the channels at 8:00 and "american idol" came up on that scrolling preview channel. i said "ooh. american idol", and dave asked if i wanted to watch it. i tried not to act too excited (even though i have been an avid american idol watcher since the beginning). so we watched the show, and critiqued all the contestants. for all you watchers out there, my votes go to fantasia and diana.   now we're watching "the chappelle show". if you have a sense of humor AT ALL, watch this show. what an f-ing hoot.  aah, the sweet smell of frozen pizza. and the pleasing softness of my big ass. have to get back together with florine, but not tonight.

       I Vote For More Vacation in '04   i am loving this f-ing vacation. watching dr. phil, maury and judge hatchett, eating leftover pizza for breakfast, doing crossword puzzles online... it just doesn't get any better than this. really. i think this might get old after a few weeks, but for now it's more fun than i've had in months. last night james and i went out to carrabba's and had a great time and a fabulous dinner. the night before that, tori, dave and i went for sushi and ice cream (not at the same time) and then hung out with sara and just sat around and shot the shit for hours. and the night before that, brigid and dave and james and i had "family game night" and sat around for hours playing scattergories, trivial pursuit, and catchphrase. in the words of brigid: we were a bunch of winners. i've managed to do as little work as humanly possible--minimal amounts of laundry, some baking, and a tiny bit of cleaning. dave and i gave the gym a nod yesterday and played some racquetball and then lifted weights. other than that, i have been incorrigibly lazy. i haven't even  read  anything, since i don't want to have to think hard enough to read. television only, please. the sleazier, the better. ooh, ricki lake is on next.    Real Life ER    james and i are going out to cleveland tonight to hang with our families. on friday, i'm going into the VA hospital in cleveland to check out my dad's new place of work. now that i'm a med student, i get to hang out in the emergency department all day and watch the steady influx of heroin addicts and alcoholics. my dad is totally psyched to show me around, and i am excited and nervous to be able to share some "professional time" with my dad. this is the first time he'll see me in action, although i'm really not allowed to do anything yet. i'm bringing my white coat and my stethoscope so i'll at least  look  official. it's amazing how easily people are faked out when you walk in wearing that coat, with a stethoscope perched authoritatively around your neck.  ricki has a show about messy men today. this is going to be  great . maybe i'll recline on the sofa, watch television, and read oprah's magazine during the commercials. maybe the mail came already. maybe some catalogs.  yes .

       Trailer Trash   refrain from using any bleaching products on your hair, unless it's mustache hair that you want to bleach. i tried out that fancy-schmancy hair dye that's got the "all over" color and then the highlights, since it was on sale and i had a coupon. okay, so just because you  watch  your hairstylist do highlights does  NOT  mean that you yourself will be able to reproduce the desired effect. that highlighting cream is  BLEACH --you might as well streak clorox through your hair. so i'm a bit brassy... it's toning down a bit, so i may not have to dye it again immediately. i feel like i'm just a pair of white hightops and a hornets jacket away from the trailer park, though.    Self-Love   i'm not talking about the kind that you do with the vibrating sea lion and the dirty books...  i'm talking about good old go-to-the-mall-and-buy-yourself-some-presents love. i am pleased, as i found some good sales and i also bought some bath products from the body shop (really the only thing that toledo has going for it is that we have a body shop) and two new CDs. i feel exceedingly good about life right now.

       Can I Borrow Your Baby?   so this morning, maury had these 14-year old girls on his show who want babies. they were talking about how they have sex, like 8 times a day to try to get pregnant so they could have someone to love them. one girl said that she was a good babysitter so she would definitely make a good mom. so anyway, they gave the girls a bunch of "loaner babies" for 24 hours and every single girl said afterward that she didn't want babies for at least 10 more years. i was thinking about my dearest cousin dayna and her daughter kaya, and of amy and her son jack. both of these amazing women had babies in their early twenties, and both are great moms. watching both of them and observing the responsibility involved in parenting has scared me off of kids for a long time. talk about sacrifice--they do it because they love their kids enough to take a bullet for them--but i know they've had to give up many of the activities they loved in the time pre-baby. props to the baby mommas; hope my birth control pills don't fail anytime soon.  thank the dear lord that i am on spring break. i was going to go into the gym this morning (i'm even decked out in my workout clothes) but then i remembered that i don't have to do a damn thing that i don't want to do. and i just don't  feel  like going to the gym. as a compromise, i think i'll do a pilates DVD in the comfort of my living room.  and then i will dye my hair (i'm thinking of trying some of that expensive stuff that has one color and then highlights you put over it), and give myself a pedicure. yes.  also, i have to reformat this damned blog. i'm tired of looking at the defunct "comments" section.

       The Fabulous Life Of   it's been a long time since the last post. probably i should just write about something, because what's banal and everyday to me might be interesting to someone who doesn't see it everyday. so here are some of the "interesting" things i've been up to:  1. noticed that someone peanut-buttered the tree outside the apartment building. yes, that's right. someone spread a large quantity of what appears to be creamy peanut butter circumferentially around a sizeable oak tree outside the front door. luckily, it's been rainy, so much of the butter has washed off. it has not yet occurred to me why an unnamed assailant decided to wreak havoc on an innocent tree.  2. went out to sing karaoke last night, with all the vocal remedy (MCO's female a cappella group) dropouts, and james. we went to diane's roadhouse, which was a townie bar in the best and worst senses. it was a good time, and just about right for a school night. we stayed about an hour and a half, had a beer, sang some songs, took in the country atmosphere, and then went home. the single most stunning event of the evening was that  james actually sang a song . i have been married/engaged to/dating this man since 1996, and i have NEVER heard him sing more than a few lines. when he got up there and sang the beatles' "blackbird", i was incredulous. and he didn't sound half bad.   3. still planning the trip to DC. i can't wait--we've decided to make a little road trip vacation out of the whole thing, and we managed to find a few hotels in the outlying areas that are cheap and on the metro line. i think it will be a blast. i love road trips.   4. my dad is probably going into the army. he's been trying to get back into the navy medical corps, but they've been giving him a hard time because he's 57. the army said they'd take him, so that's what i think he'll probably do. they will send him to iraq or afghanistan for three months. he has to go through the equivalent of basic training in houston in  august . i think he might be insane.

       Psycho Beach Party   as i write this, i am busy digesting my delicious lunchbreak of wheat saltines, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter, and 1 slice of reduced-fat kroger brand process "cheese". i finished off the feast with an apple, but what i really wanted was a giant handful of something chocolatey.   the studying is coming along well. i finally made it through cardiac and renal physiology, which were without a doubt my least favorite topics this year. i think when i was learning them for class, i was "missing the forest for the trees", since it all seems to make a great deal more sense now that i've selectively dropped out the laborious details. the big picture isn't quite as terrifying as i had once imagined. the main problem now is burnout--i can barely concentrate sometimes, as i am thinking of the three glorious weeks i will have all to myself after june 10.   speaking of the free time, i have ambitious plans to visit my cousin, her fiance, and their baby on the weekend of june 17-18. after that, i hope to make a pilgrimage to columbus for my absolute favorite weekend of the year-- Comfest . i looked at the website online and i am SO excited. i don't even know any of the bands that are playing, but i do not care. i'm going to bring some beer, put on some skimpy clothes, and lay around in the park for a few days. and eat. lots of eating will be involved.   on a semi-related note, i have been in search of a bathing suit. i am limited by two factors: size and money, although lately more money than size. i went to meijer and tried on a few there. they were cute, but my girls are a little too big for the suits that don't have some kind of support system built in. so i tried some stores online-- land's end, j crew, banana republic, the gap... it seems as though you can't get a swimsuit for under $70 these days. unless you want to look like ursula the sea witch. so then i checked out old navy, which doesn't have a one-piece suit in the whole store. so i bit the bullet and ordered two two-piece suits. one is a tankini, which seems fairly modest. the other has boyshort bottoms, which are so darn cute, and a  string  bikini top. i made sure to check the return policy, in case i feel like a beached whale or it just doesn't hold up the girls. i have decided not to give a holy shit about the other people at the apartment pool. my happy ass is marching down there in a bikini, in a summertime act of defiance. i feel pretty confident right now, but we'll see if things change when the suits get to my apartment. at least it's a reasonable incentive to watch what i put in my big mouth.  back to the endocrine system...

       My Computer Wants Me to Repress My Feelings   so i poured my heart out yesterday in a sensitive, eloquent blog entry, and the m-f-ing computer deleted it, never to be retrieved. so here's the gist of it:   i eat too much, cannot afford to go back to weight watchers, and so am going to do this damn thing myself. i've lost almost 70 lbs, and don't want to screw it all up because i love food too much and can't seem to control what i put in my big mouth. i really like the whole group support thing, and it would be worth it if i had the $10/week that it costs, but it's either that or get thrown out of my apartment. and then my skinny ass would be living on the streets, which is clearly not the best course of action. it would also help if i weren't frigging SICK all the time, so i could go back to my fairly rigorous workout schedule. it's tough to run with airway obstruction. let's hear it for choking to death in the park! woo hoo!  i wonder if there is a patron saint for cute yet chubby girls who might like to be about 2 sizes smaller... i will certainly let the loyal blog readers know if i find one.

       Sandwiches, Squirrels, Cheapskates and Cheech & Chong   hi kids! since i have no interesting news (i study every day, all day long), i will share a few of the less notable and undoubtedly less interesting happenings in my world:  1. remember the peanut-buttered tree? i left my apartment yesterday and noticed that someone had left little tiny peanut butter and grape jelly sandwiches under that very same tree. there was a squirrel sitting under the tree, eating one of the sandwiches. i don't think i have ever seen a squirrel hold a sandwich, but i suppose no one ever cuts them small enough for the squirrels. and they even cut off the crusts.   2. i have no money, which is definitely not news. i also study at panera quite a bit, and i figured that dave and i were spending $2.47 per day to get small drinks and refill them all day long. the cups are styrofoam, so they don't disintegrate. this past week we took the very ghetto step of bringing our cups back to our apartments, washing them, and reusing them. right now we have two sets of cups, and i'm hoping we can make them last two weeks or so. hey, $2.47 adds up pretty quickly. i could buy  beer  with that money.  3. someone in dave's building smoked a LOT of pot today. when dave and i got back after our daily pilgrimage to panera (with our reused cups in tow) it smelled as if someone had broken into dave's apartment and smoked up for several hours. they then sprayed cheap air freshener to try to cover up the smell. the whole thing gave us both kind of a contact buzz, which would be nice if we didn't have to study some more tonight. wow, my life is boring.  4. speaking of drunken debauchery, i will be making a work-related pilgrimage to columbus next weekend. i am looking forward to hanging out with all the kids... if you are free, loyal blog readers, drop me a line and let me know the plans.

       The Perils of Reformatting   so i am trying to give my blog a swanky new look, but in the process i have lost all my links and such. there will be some changes, as i look for a delightful new skin that allows me to have the stuff i want on the side panel. i'm not so literate with the magical language of HTML, so i have to find something that pretty much lays it out for me. i'm also diggin' the chatterboxes of my friends...got to get me one of those.  currently i am in the midst of studying for the board exam. my days are as follows: get up, go to the park or the gym to move my chubby butt for an hour or two, then shower, eat, study, eat lunch, study, eat dinner, and study. sometimes there's enough time at the end of the night to watch some TV or have some sex. both of which are delightful, stress-relieving pursuits. repeat every day for the next month. post june 10, i re-enter the land of the living for three short weeks, which i hope to cram full of social time and pool time. oh, and i'll be broke, since i don't get the next financial aid welfare check until july. so i'm thinking cheap beer, food from someone else's kitchen, and $2 movies at the cheap theatre. the pool is free, thank goodness. and i already have a thermos to put my margaritas in, so i can prime myself for heat stroke.  ah, summer. just a few short weeks and i'll actually get to enjoy it.

       School's Out Forever   forgive me, father, for i have sinned. it's been more than a month since my last blog entry.  to be fair, it's been a busy month. school is O-V-E-R. i managed to finish out the year very respectably, with passing grades and quite a bit of cinco de mayo tequila. unfortunately, the party has to end until june 10, which is the day of the Big Test--Step One of the US medical licensing exam. we had 7 hours of review class today, and we have 8 more tomorrow, and 4 each on monday and tuesday. i'm giving myself saturday off, so the serious studying must begin on sunday. and i do mean serious--all day, every day, for one month. there are several bright sides, however: i've seen 98% of the material before, i can set my own schedule, i got a free online review course from the princeton review (one of the perks of teaching MCAT prep), i'm studying with dave (always a good time), and we both live in the same apartment complex which has a pool. so i plan to work on my tan and learn about mold, parasites, heart failure, childbirth, and all the other wonderful topics covered in two years of medical school. i KNOW you all wish you could be me, and what can i say? at least this is supposed to be review.  i am very excited about my saturday plans. i'm driving up to detroit to watch my brother andrew's crew regatta. james is working, so dave and i are driving up. dave's 'rents live north of detroit, so we'll stop by there. also (and best of all) there is a krispy kreme store which has attained legendary proportions in my mind. apparently they hand you a free doughnut  fresh from the fryer when you walk in . sounds suspiciously like a drug dealer giving you the first hit for free, doesn't it? i look forward to following up the free one with several of its friends.

       Celebrate We Will, For Life Is Short But Sweet For Certain   ah, comfest. what a wonderful day. i got to spend time with james, but also dave, nikki, her sister marin and boyfriend gavin, plus amy, rachel, anne, tyler and patty. all in all, the day was packed. decided that i WOULD spend the money on beer, since this is the last little vacation that any of us gets before school starts. james agreed to drive home, so dave also partook in the drinking o' the beer. at one point in the afternoon, a couple a few yards away from us asked us to watch their stuff. they disappeared for about an hour, but then came back and gave us all their leftover beer tokens--probably about $25 total. the karmic wheel spun in my direction! so we all some more beer and staggered around comfest until the evening. james and i and dave went to grab dinner at hound dog's, and snaps to dave for sharing my FAVORITE pizza of all time: pepperoni, feta, and fresh garlic, smokin' joe's style (that's garlic butter on the crust, FYI). adrienne kind of disappeared from the radar, so we didn't get to see her, but we did stop by at patty's house. always the entertainer, she kept us laughing well into the late evening, and poor james had to get up for work at 8:00 today. we got home at 2:00...    there was a point when i was sitting on the grass, enjoying the warmth of the sun and the funky latin music coming from the main stage, when it struck me that i am so damn lucky. i had a circle of people around me that love me enough to come hang with me even though some of them had already been to comfest the other two days that weekend. james and dave drove down so i could be with my friends from college, and i was extremely pleased that my friends from college, friends from work, and friends from med school all got along so well. it just made me feel loved, and special, and lucky to know people such as these.   patty, good luck writing your curriculum. teach those white boys about masculine leadership! amy, enjoy your va-ca--you have earned it more than anyone else i know. see if you can get a chuck-e-cheese visit in there somewhere.

       Keep On Rockin' In The Free World   tired, must go to sleep as i am going fishing with the 'rents tomorrow, but i must say this: if there is one film you see this summer, you absolutely MUST see "fahrenheit 9/11". will blog more later, but i have to put in my two cents right now. michael moore is a genius, and this is his best one yet. it's really tough to argue against the evidence, especially when the words come right from the administration's own big mouths.   this week, i am reading up on john kerry, and i think i am going to volunteer for his campaign.  it's time to get this criminal out of office.

       The Power Of Plants (And I Don't Mean Pot, Necessarily)   i'm in one of those blah moods. i really have no reason to be, since i have loads of free time and tons of stuff to do, but i feel kind of bitchy and bratty for no reason. actually, i think it has to do with the realization that the fun and games ends in a week and a half. i wanted to learn to knit! to go to cedar point! to save the trees! to bring about equal rights! oh well. guess i'll have to wait until winter break.  also, every new piece of information i get regarding my clinical rotations makes them sound more ominous. i will be in sandusky for the entire month of august, and i still don't know what the housing situation will be. i will live there, since it is about an hour away from toledo. the question is: will i be in an apartment with one bathroom and four other students? or will it be in someone's spare bedroom, with screaming children and stinky pets? or will the best option be living on the boat, like one of the vietnamese boat people? who knows? apparently it's not important to let us know until the last possible second, like the week before we have to leave. *sigh*  dave just finished re-potting my african violet, laquisha. she has a swanky new ceramic pot that allows her to take up just as much water as she needs--kind of a double pot thingy. some people get depresed and buy clothes. do NOT take me to a garden center when i am having a bad day. i picked up two new friends--a chubby little succulent (looks like a jade plant, of sorts), and a hanging pot with a very slick leafy tropical plant. the tropical plant's name is clyde, which i thought of. the succulent told me that her name is lucille, which i thought was a very nice name for a pleasantly plump little plant. so lucille gets laquisha's old pot. it's all very complicated, this plant shuffling. and all the damned things need a special kind of dirt. who would have ever thought that there were so many types of dirt? (or that dave and i would have approximately five varieties between the two of us?) it also seems like dirt should be nearly free, but this is also not the case. sadly, dirt costs money (even though you can get it for free in the parking lot).   so complex, these plants. gives me something to think about, other than rotations and poor living arrangements and what's for dinner.

       Send His Love To Me (Or Send Another Can Of The Scrubbing Bubbles)  listenin' to some PJ harvey, taking a break from cleaning. i've been at it pretty much all day, and i have to say that it feels good to see surfaces i haven't visualized in many months. like the top of my dresser, for example. tomorrow i hope to finish the bedroom, and move into the living room. this includes my desk, unfortunately. i have to do all this stuff when i'm feeling ruthless, or else i never get rid of anything. i just shuffle it around to different piles. nice, organized piles, but they eventually become evil, chaotic piles. so i'm feeling merciless, and the piles must go. they must, even if it pains me to throw things out. on the bright side, i am getting rid of 5+ bags of clothes that are too big. it crossed my mind that i should try to resell some of them, but i just don't feel like it. also, i think goodwill should get an influx of quality apparel to balance out all the people who donate their old NASCAR shirts and polyester bellbottoms. someone will be thrilled to come across a pink jackie-o-esque jones new york suit. i know  i  would feel like it was my lucky day.   What's Long And Hard And Full Of Seamen?  on a totally unrelated note, props to my little bro andrew for scoring the navy ROTC scholarship. he'll be at marquette in the fall, getting his lil' white ass kicked every morning with the other ROTC kids. it's a good thing, especially since my parents were tossing around the idea of moving to a smaller house due to not being able to afford the one they're in. with andrew's college essentially paid for, they won't have to worry about shelling out any cash for him. also, i see definite possibilities for a milwaukee residency, and now i have an excuse to jaunt up there for a long weekend to check the place out.

       Adult Swim Time   it's just after midnight, early monday morning, and poor kaya is up with a terrible cough. part of me was annoyed, as i was just settling into bed at my cousin's house, the night before i have to drive back to toledo. a good night's sleep would be good. but then i popped my head into dayna's room to see if everything was okay, and my heart just broke--exhausted little girl, coughing and choking and crying, with little tear-filled eyes and a runny nose. i thought that sometimes when i'm sick and can't sleep, i want to do that very thing. i want to sit up, cry, have someone take care of me and try to make me feel better, because trying to get to sleep certainly isn't working. maybe babies have this stuff just right.  the cat is eyeing the chair that i am sitting in. time to go to bed, i guess. james is watching late-night cartoon network, hence the title of the post.

       Somethin' Tells Me It's All Happening At The Zoo   still chillin' in madison. the weather has been perfect, and i'm really just happy to spend time with james and my family, in a city that's not toledo. not only is it  not  toledo, it's a city that has feminist bookstores, restaurants that aren't just the olive garden and friday's, and a giant farmers' market on saturday mornings. excellent foods, political tables, funny-looking people, and this week only, cows. the dairy farmers' council has an annual event called "cows on the concourse", in which they bring out about 10 cows, some live bands and really good ice cream, and everyone gets to pet the cows and eat good ice cream for cheap. we wash our hands in between, FYI.  james and i are renting bikes to ride around the lakes today. the city of madison is on an isthmus, and is almost completely surrounded by four lakes. there are bike paths everywhere, so we are going to take advantage of the gorgeous day and get some exercise in the process (saw "super size me" last night--that's a whole other blog post for the future...).  ugh. back to toledo tomorrow. reality calls.

       The Wheels On The Bus Go Round And Round   right now i'm hanging out in madison in the excellent company of james, my cousin dayna, her fiance brandon, and their daughter kaya. kaya is a constant source of amusement--she is like having a myna bird or a parrot that repeats everything you say. she knows a bunch of animal sounds and names, she knows all kinds of food words and other useful vocabulary, and she loves to say hi and wave at people. we went to the pool at the hotel last night, and kaya waved to the other people in the pool and said "hi, kids!" oh yeah, and she's one and a half. we went to a little italian place for dinner this evening, and she decided that the butter was for putting in hair, and on face, and on hands. the great part was that she knew it was bad, because she would look to make sure someone was watching so she could giggle and then smear butter everywhere.   there are many, many more stories. will write about them when i get home. time to enjoy the last night of hotel time, and get some sleep so we can descend like locusts upon the farmers' market tomorrow. cheese curds, here we come!

       Please Keep Hands and Arms Inside The Car At All Times   i am so f-ing HUNGRY. the past few days i've felt like every meal is my last. i think it has something to do with PMS, but it also definitely has some kind of relationship to the fact that i'm not in class, i don't have to study, and i really just get to sit around and think about eating. so i figure that i'm not going to get stressed out about it, since starting july 6, life as we know it essentially ends. it will be a great deal easier to monitor what i eat, if i never eat. heh.  the weekend home was good, although it reminded me why i love and appreciate my family in smaller doses. i think they like me a whole lot better now, since they only see me every few months. by the end of the time, i was itchy to leave. which was dumb, because i got depressed as soon as i got off the turnpike at exit 59. the south toledo/maumee area isn't exactly scenic. "look kids, it's the budget inn! some guy got shot there last week!" "ooh, honey! a waffle house! how quaint!" yeah, no.  hanging out with amy was a blast. jack is  huge . at this rate, he'll need a special house with high ceilings. it didn't make sense until i saw amy's brother andrew. now i know where those genes came from. too bad they skipped you, amy! heh heh. just kidding. i like my hot lesbos short and sweet.    i looked at residency programs today, for shits and giggles and because i finally have two minutes to play online. hmm. there aren't too many options out there for OB/GYN. i think i will have to consider some programs in states i hadn't thought about before. charleston, SC is the latest place i've fallen in love with, based on their website. mmm... beaches. mmm... warm weather. mmm... decent salary. all the important things. it was weird to look at places and mentally rank them based on whether or not they had on-site daycare or paid maternity leave. hadn't really thought about those things before, but residency seems like prime time for havin' the babies. (biological clock: tick, tick, tick...)

       If I Can't Do It Homie, It Can't Be Done  (holla to damien)  so andrew's graduation party came and went without incident. by "without incident" i mean that no one was arrested, nothing major was broken or stolen, and no one threw up or passed out. i smoked a most fabulous cigar with james, my parents, and our friend brigid ( see new blog link!  i found out that brigid is a closet blogger and she gave me the thumbs up on linking her blog up to mine.). james actually smoked the entire cigar, which is fairly amazing as i have never known him to be one for substances. he hasn't ever finished a whole beer, he's never been drunk, never smoked an entire cigarette, and never smoked the wacky weed. who knows, maybe cigars will be the "gateway drug". heh.  amy b. and i are going out to dinner tonight, with the little one. i can't wait to see them both, though i'm sure amy's conversation will be more stimulating than jack's. :) buca di beppo is total sensory overload, so what better place to take a squirrely kid, right? at this moment i'm waiting for a call from amy f., with whom i am supposed to take a trip to the west side market. for the uninitiated, the west side market is a GIANT indoor/outdoor market on the near west side of cleveland that has all manner of meats, breads, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, pastries and spices, just to name a limited list. there are little family owned stands, with many ethnic goodies, that have been in operation since the market opened over 100 years ago. james has sent me with orders to find some polish kielbasa, so i have a mission. i'm hoping to find some fresh fruit to nibble on, plus maybe some fresh cheese and homemade bread. always thinking of the belly, i am.  tomorrow it's back to the Armpit Of Ohio, to clean the apartment and get ready to head out to madison to see cousin dayna, fiance brandon, and baby kaya. i am thrilled to be able to go, and james is thrilled that we are getting the hell out of toledo for a few days. we also found a hotel room for two nights on priceline (i am just so darn thrifty!) so we'll get to have some quality time, if you're pickin' up what i'm throwin' down.

       I Heart Suburbia   so i am finally home, even though i don't really live here anymore. i just have to say, for the record, that my parents rock. my mom ordered a dress for me, just as a little surprise, because she thought it would look nice with my white coat. (and it will! it's very cute and pink, which i adore.) then we went shopping to costco, which is a great deal like sam's club but with better stuff most of the time. i spent about a million dollars getting enough food to make it through the Siege of '04, should that day ever come. really i just buy spaghetti sauce in large enough quantities so as to be able to cover my entire body, if i so desire. then, as if that were not enough, my dad decided that he needed cigars to properly celebrate my brother andrew's high school graduation and my completion of the board exam. so, 117 dollars later, i have a $15 piece of heaven davidoff dominican cigar to smoke with my bourbon tomorrow. my mom has gone wild, as she often does when hosting parties, so i am looking forward to a veritable feast tomorrow, replete with all the beer, wine and whiskey that i care to drink with my parents. i even got to watch the first ten minutes of "patton" as i assembled some of the salads for tomorrow. my dad, bless his heart, never remembers that i've already seen it and feels that it's part of my education as the daughter of an army man.  as per dave's blog, i would also like to comment on the fine time i had yesterday evening at nikki's house. hal and shirley are the finest in "parents away from parents". it was a strange feeling at one point-- there we were, hanging out with people who were either our parents or the same age as our parents, and i didn't feel like a kid. i felt strangely adult--we shot the shit like a bunch of friends, not friends + parents. it made me feel older, but not in a grey-haired, arthritic knee, have-to-start-wearing-the-depends way. i felt the same way today when i went out with my dad. maybe, despite my best efforts to the contrary, i am growing up.

       Thank You Baby Jesus For Helping Me Through The Test   i came, i saw, i finished. whether or not i conquered will become known in approximately six weeks. refer to dave's blog for further discussion of that topic... i will say that the testing center was pretty relaxing, two of the three employees were pleasant (that counts you OUT, Bitch Ass!), and it could have been much, much worse. also, i didn't get that "inmate" feeling that i had when i took the MCAT. no one fingerprinted me, for example.  so now that that's over, i can enjoy myself for almost four weeks before i have to start this shit up again. well, not this shit specifically. as my father said, "welcome to the world of clinical medicine". he sounded both foreboding and welcoming. i think it will be a nice change to not have to sit in a classroom for six hours a day and listen to some PhD jack off about his research, and all the cool science people he knows.   dave and i went out to dinner last night to celebrate, and of course i got smashed before dinner even started. who knew that a giant martini on an empty stomach was all it took? and the olives were stuffed with gorgonzola cheese. you all know how i feel about cheese.  so i had a huge hunk of salmon, garlic mashed potatoes, a caesar salad, and about two baskets full of warm bread with herb dipping sauce. and a half a bottle of wine in addition to the decadent martini. dave enjoyed the pasta trio, the other half of the bottle of wine, and about two baskets of bread. he had a heineken while i was swilling the martini, so he got to drive home. james couldn't join us due to work, so i brought him home some lasagna. i felt like i should have brought him lasagna for a year, since he's put up with me for the last two years of hell, AND there were roses all over the CLEAN house when i got home yesterday. a good man.  tonight is the party with the other kids who took the test today. beer will flow like water.   so that's what's up. going in to financial aid today to see about gittin' my money. dave and i are going to tackle that together--it helps to know that i've got him there, in case i have to pop a cap in someone's ass. he'll get my back, 'cause that's what best friends do.    can't wait to see you all, my loyal blog readers. amy, i will call your celly to make plans for monday or tuesday.    peace out.

       Money Stinks, Unless You Have Lots Of It   the financial aid budget for this year was just released onto the drab and barely functional MCO financial aid website. a few observations need be made:  1.  apparently the cost of living has actually NOT increased , even though i'm paying twice as much for gas and my rent has gone up. at least that's what kathryn coy will have you believe. we have the EXACT same budget numbers as we did when we started this whole game, almost three years ago. i'd like to see her personal fucking budget to see if it went up. well, she  has  lost more hair, so she probably spends a lot more money on hairpieces.   2.  they have so graciously budgeted $975  to pay for another step in the licensing exam series that will start when we are fourth year students. here's the deal: it's a clinical skills exam, it's all day, there are only around three testing centers nationally, and no one knows where they are. oh yeah, and there is predictably NO money in the budget for travel expenses or hotel rooms for the night before the test. so i'll be thinking of them when i eat my motherfucking ramen noodles, since i will have no money left for nutritive foods. only salt licks.   3.  does this make sense to you?  Summer Semester ( 2 months )=$5990 tuition Fall Semester ( 4 months )=$8900 tuition Spring Semester (  6 months  )=$8900 tuition  so let me get this shit straight: i'm paying $2995 per month for summer tuition, $2225 per month for fall, and $1483 per month for spring?  come again?  do i get higher quality teaching in the summer? do the school's president and all the members of the board of trustees have to pay their greens fees with my summer tuition? here's an offer they won't be able to refuse: how about i just pay TWICE for spring, and then they can let me go to school in the summer and fall! eureka!   4.  every year we get charged $55 for a yearbook fee . the "funny" thing is that they are something like 6 years behind in publishing this "yearbook", so i'll probably never see it. the money must be going to something more worthwhile, like buying cheap hookers so the Ph.D.s can get laid once in a while.   5.  the icing on the shitcake : MCO rents us out as slave labor to rural health facilities, because it doesn't have a big enough hospital system to take us all for clinical rotations. we have to live in the little rat hole places we're working (for weeks at a time--sometimes as long as six weeks for one rotation), and hope that we have a spouse/friend/partner/classmate who can check our mail and bring in the paper so our house doesn't get robbed. we are REQUIRED to do at least 8 weeks away. the devious part is that this program is funded by state grants and private donations (i.e. NOT my tuition money). so basically MCO gets my tuition money whether i study there or whether i study in Butt Fucking Egypt, Ohio. once again, i hope they are using it to buy heroin or whores or something good.   excuse the unladylike language, kids. i'm about to enjoy a dinner of leftovers, and not leftover lobster, if you were wondering.

       Into The Great Wide Open   so my month in pulmonary at MCO is finally over. our attending actually let us out BEFORE our conferences today, so we didn't have to come back at 3:30. i think he might have felt just a little remorseful about keeping us until 7:30 last night. plus, i think he was hoping to be done and sneaking out by 3:30 too. so it was a mutually convenient arrangement.  i can't believe the month went by so quickly. a testament to being busy enough to not realize exactly how many hours i spent at the hospital. i had started to keep track of my work hours, but after the first 80 hour week, it got too depressing. and i'm not being paid, so i guess it really doesn't matter. i will miss my patients, though. i could probably tell you every single case history i saw this month. probably a quarter of the people will be dead in three months or less, and half will be dead within the year. what a relief it will be to get to pediatrics or OB/GYN, where there is a great deal less in the realm of terminal illness. i don't know how my dad did internal medicine. you have to be a special type of person to be able to deal with all the sadness.   Sittin' On The Dock Of The Bay   ...is what i hope to be doing when i'm not at the hospital in sandusky. reporting for duty at 08:00, monday morning, sir. which means that i will leave my house at 06:15 to be able to drive the hour to sandusky and still have time to get lost several times. apparently there are three buildings that i will navigate on monday, and i can't figure out the map scale enough to see if the distance is walkable. my guess is that it's not. hopefully rosie won't die on me, or else it'll be diane and The Bicycle for four weeks. at least it's summer--there should be lots to do in the sandusky/port clinton/cedar point area, and the weather will hopefully cooperate. and we are  supposed  to have our weekends off, but that probably depends upon your attending. seriously, i might bust up some shit if i have to. i am NOT working weekends on this rotation, especially if no one else has to. (insert attitudinous head movements here) i am trying to make the best of the whole "dorm life" thing. hell, maybe it'll be fun. and maybe i'll gain thirty pounds like i did during freshman year of college.  riiight .   She Works Hard For The Money   i tried out the "job predictor" link from matthew's blog. must have missed my calling:  Diane, Your ideal job is a Movie star.  Diane Hxxxxxx-Cxxxxx, Your ideal job is a Dentist. Diane Joy Hxxxxxx-Cxxxxx, Your ideal job is a Stripper.  that's okay, i guess. at least i didn't drop over $100K to land  this  job:  Dave Yxxxxx, Your ideal job is a Prostitute.   heh.

        Talking About A Revolution    thanks to anne, i now have&nbsp;a counter embedded in my blog that tallies up the cost of the war in iraq. if you click on the website link, you'll find how much the war is costing you as an individual taxpayer, what it costs your household, and exactly what we could be doing with that money were it not being spent on weapons, etc. i don't care if you believe the war was justified, unjustified, moral or immoral. the fact is that it is exorbitantly expensive. i personally think the utility of fighting this particular fight is questionable, so the fact that we could  immunize all the world's children  for    41 years    or  fully fund world hunger relief  for    5 years    makes this war look more and more like a wasteful, hurtful, and vastly immoral endeavor. i fully understand that the money would not likely be diverted to these worthwhile programs should the war end tomorrow, but that doesn't dampen the moral and ethical weight of the argument. it's not like we have any choice in the matter, since refraining from paying taxes&nbsp;is just not an option. but wait--there&nbsp;happens to be an election coming up in november. while i am&nbsp;not naive enough to believe that this will all change for the better under a kerry/edwards administration, it certainly&nbsp;is bad enough now to think about&nbsp;disturbing the status quo.    Yeah...I'm Gonna Need You To Come In On Saturday...    &nbsp; so right now i'm officially supposed to be studying, while i wait for my resident to fill out a bunch of paperwork. i'm not entirely sure why i don't get to just go home, but i have to page my resident at around 4:00 to see if there's anything to do. my thoughts on this: 1) if i have to page you to ask for things to do, there must not be anything really important for me to do. 2) given that there is nothing important for me to do, there must not be any good learning experiences at this time. 3) i have to read a giant shitload of articles, reference materials, and textbooks, just to feel like i'll be able to keep my head above water for the next 8 weeks then pass my shelf exam. 4) for god's sake, let me leave so i can take a frigging nap and then read before i pass out for the night. that is all.    Yeah...I'm Gonna Need You To Come In On Sunday...    &nbsp; so this weekend i get to pack up all my shizit and move to sandusky for a month o' medicine and a revisitation of the joys of dorm life. apparently we get our own rooms, have to share bathrooms, and there is a fridge and a microwave. that is all. oh, but wait! i get all my meals in the hospital cafeteria! free of charge, up to $10 a day! which should buy me the filet o' bottom feeder special, just about every day. maybe i'll have enough money left for a cup of coffee. maybe. the consolation prize is that i'm only 45 minutes from my parents' house, so hopefully i'll be able to arrange a few Mom Specials in lieu of the Breaded Dog Special or the Mystery Meat n' Sauce. hopefully, HOPEFULLY my weekends will be free. who do i have to kill to get two days off in a row? although i suppose if i killed someone, i could get all kinds of days off, but in jail. so maybe i should think of other ways to lighten my work burden. like becoming sick more often. yeah. that's a great idea.  well, i probably should be productive, or something like that. spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, here i come!

        I Can't Get No Satisfaction    i am  sick . this is the second day that i've stayed home from work, and i can only imagine what i've missed. my throat is threatening to swell  up  and close off, i have&nbsp;a headache that only goes away when i'm sleeping, and i have lymph nodes on my neck that look like&nbsp; golf balls. it would be great if i could concentrate long enough to get some reading done, but the sore neck and the headache make it difficult to do anything but sit in front of the TV. and let me tell you how exciting my&nbsp;6 channels are. james, the wonderful man that he is, rented me some movies, so i think i will watch "the wilds of madagascar", which is a national geographic documentary with monkeys and stuff. okay, so being sick doesn't make me any less of a nerd.  i really do miss work, as strange as that seems. i want to know what is going on with my patients, which ones have&nbsp;been discharged, what new people were admitted, etc. i get to take call tomorrow night, so i guess i'll make up for the hours that i've been sitting in front of the TV. than again, it's not like anyone will page me to do anything. but whatever. i'll feel better, i guess.    Ken Jennings  For  President       &nbsp; ken jennings won jeopardy again last night. although he didn't get the final jeopardy question (which is rare),&nbsp; there was a point in the game where he had $40,000 and the other two contestants had $6000 and $2000. the man is a frigging genius, or he's just  full  of trivial knowledge. plus he looks like the unibomber. put that man in a hooded sweatshirt, and he could be a criminal mastermind. which qualifies him perfectly for politics, as far as i'm concerned. normally i'm not a regular TV watcher, since my schedule doesn't permit regular  anything . but damned if i don't manage to watch jeopardy nearly every night. and the best (and nerdiest) part is that ken writes his name differently every time. one night he wrote it out in scrabble blocks, one night it was spelled phonetically, another night he drew in his name's reflection, as if it were standing in a puddle. right up my alley.  that's really all i've been up to. my mom, bless her heart, sent me a dress that we had seen a few weeks ago when i was home for a visit. she found it on sale, bought it, and mailed it to me. it stinks to be sick, but presents make just about everything better. james is working late tonight, and dave is on call, so there's no one to accompany me in my misery. which is&nbsp;probably good, since i haven't showered and i feel particularly stinky. probably should go take care of that.

       You Load 15 Tons And Whadya Get? Another Day Older And Deeper In Debt.   i am on call. as much as it's a pain in the ass to sit around until 10pm and wait for: 1) someone to get sick and 2) the resident to remember to page me, i still feel kinda cool in a nerdy way. i am  on call , and i have a  pager  via the admitting resident  may  contact me, and i  may  get to see a patient. okay, i'm a dork, and peculiar things excite me. i'll take whatever i can get these days. right now i'm going on my 14th hour of work today. that's right, kids! 14 hours! the thought of how much money i could be making if i were teaching for the princeton review sickens me. hell, if i worked 14 hours a day at minimum wage, i'd be rolling in money. then again,  any  money is more than i'm making now. so i'll work my 15 hour day, go home, and do it again tomorrow. and again the next day. until i die of exhaustion.   i watched a bronchoscopy today (tube down nose that looks at the lungs) on an HIV-positive patient who was suspected of having tuberculosis. since TB can be transmitted via airborne droplets, we had to wear all kinds of protective gear, including scary masks. actually, the masks weren't that frightening in and of themselves, it was more the idea that we HAD to wear them. that we could get TB at any time. HIV becomes a hell of a lot less scary when you consider that it's pretty tough to get. just being in the same room with someone with TB can cause infection. luckily, his lung biopsies were negative, so i guess i won't have any justification for my paranoia. this time.   Take My Hand, Take My Whole Life Too   on a much happier note, today is my 2nd anniversary. in true medical-student-and-neglected-husband fashion, i am working and james is playing dungeons and dragons with the guys. we elected to celebrate on friday, when i had the evening off and didn't have to be at the hospital until 9:00 on saturday. (i know what you're thinking: generous of them!) we went and stuffed ourselves stupid at outback, then went shopping for work clothes for me and just hung out for the evening. james got me a beautiful red lacquered bowl from vietnam that i spotted when we were in madison. he waited until i wasn't paying attention (dave's comment: "so how long did that take? maybe thirty seconds?"), then went back and bought it. it's shiny, and many of you know how i feel about shiny objects. i had peaches in it for the last few days, and the bowl is so brilliant that it makes the fuzzy peaches look pixellated. i surprised james (and for those of you who know james, you understand what a feat this is) and bought him a propane grill for the balcony. now we will be able to enjoy all the things james likes: meat, meat, and steak. i'm all  'bout  the grill accessories--the smoker basket, the stir-fry pan, the chef's hat. i would be a grillin' fool if people in toledo would stop getting sick and i could go home.   still haven't received a page. whatever. i should read something, but i'm so fried that i think i probably won't. morning report is at 8:00 tomorrow, but i'll probably get here at 7:00 to update the patient list so i can kiss some attending physician ass. hopefully tomorrow will be a "short" day--maybe i'll only work 10 hours instead of 12 or 15.  i know i bitch quite a bit about all this, but i love it. i really do. and i can't imagine doing anything else.

       The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Scared)   so tomorrow is the really big first day, the first time i will walk into a clinic full of patients and actually be expected to  do  something. before it was just show up and not get in the way, but now i have to see and examine patients, make notes, order tests, recommend prescriptions and all sorts of crazy grown up shit. i feel like telling them that they really shouldn't trust me, that i don't know a goddamned thing, and that they should promptly exit the hospital or request to be treated by someone who knows their ass from their elbow. because i surely don't, most of the time.   today was a full day of lecture that could have been taken care of in three or four hours. but whatever. welcome to the world of bureaucracy, as my dad likes to say. afterward dave and i drove out to st. vincent mercy hospital to clock the time it would take to drive there. (okay, okay. dorky. but i was a girl scout for 12 years. we're just  prepared  that way.) then dave, nikki, tori, mairin and i went to max & erma's for dinner. might i recommend the tomato, mozzarella & chicken sandwich? it was divine.   got to get my stuff ready for tomorrow (find the stethoscope!) and enjoy a few hours of R & R before the shee-it hits the fan. for real.

       Summer Breeze, Makes Me Feel Fine   i am totally communing with amy, even across the miles to cleveland. i could get used to this vacation stuff. alas, the freedom ends abruptly on tuesday, july 6. i have to show up dressed professionally, and then sit all day in my freakin' classroom and listen to people tell me how to use computers and other pithy advice like "don't be mean to patients". duh. at least i won't be in that very classroom for the next year, as they are tossing me into the shark pit the next day--a month in the pulmonary unit. now, the thought of a month of lungs doesn't exactly make me hot, but it's decidedly better than a month of rectums or gallbladders. also, i managed to avoid placement with any of the several people i hate who are also on medicine clerkship first. so things are looking up, in general.  i baked for a few hours at the pool yesterday, and think i might do the same today, but for a shorter time. i probably shouldn't, as i am a bit pink from yesterday's session, but this might be the only baking day i have left before it's back to reality. so bake i will.   Hey Kids! Do You Know What  Today  Is?   other than the beginning of the fiscal year in 46 states? that's right! it's field marshal dave's birthday. the Big Guy is 25--a formidable quarter century. still young in terms of tortoises and redwoods, but approaching quality in terms of wines. definitely a fine cheese. dave, if you're reading this (which you probably aren't, since you drop off the face of the planet when you cross the michigan state line), i hope you have the best of birthdays with lots of nice presents and maybe a dinner out at one of your favorite places. at the very least, a steak on the grill at home. sorry i can't afford to buy you a fancy car or a really expensive hooker or some good drugs... i  do  have some leftover percocet, if you want to feel really stupid for a few hours. anyway, you're a wonderful friend and i love you and all that mushy stuff.    Bake-Off Death Match   so the last weekend of freedom begins tomorrow. fitting, then, that it should include independence day. we're all getting together at sarah gerken's house tomorrow night for some cookout fun & beer. i'm making two pies-- i finally got my great-grandmother's rhubarb pie recipe from my mom, so i'm making that. also, because i'm a dork, i've been watching the news and this lady from findlay won the pillsbury bake-off competition with this fabulous sounding granola pie. so i'm making that too. might as well flex my culinary muscles before it's back to weight watchers and frozen dinners.

        They're Coming To Take Me Away, Ha Ha, They're Coming To Take Me Away    check out this shit. as you read, keep in mind the following:  1. i applied to medical school during the  summer of 2001 .  2. wright state, which is not exactly in the top tier of medical school, rejected me outright, without asking for a secondary application, without any explanation. however, i was granted interviews at several other schools, all with better reputations and rankings than wright state.  3. whenever i called wright state to inquire about the status of my application (as in "have you received it yet?"), they refused to answer any of my questions except on thursdays and fridays between noon and 2:00.  4. i was fortunate enough to be accepted into MCO, where i have already completed  over half  of my medical training.  i received the following email   today:     Dear Applicant,  The Office of Admissions has received your application from AMCAS. Thank you for your interest in Wright State University School of Medicine.  For your convenience , our secondary application is on-line. To complete the application and  pay the fee of $40 , please go to the following site:  www.med.wright.edu  select Students tab, then click on Admissions, and then Secondary Application  The Admissions Committee will review applications and invite applicants to interviews through early May.  If your application is complete and you have not heard from the committee , then you are being considered for an interview. Applicants are scheduled for interviews through e-mail and telephone calls. The class is not filled until after interviewing is completed in early May. The final acceptances are usually offered through late July to applicants on the alternate list.  During the admissions process you can access your status on-line at the above website.Any questions not related to status can be answered by calling the Admissions Office at 937-775-2936 or 937-775-3762. Mondays 1-4 pm and Thursdays 9 am-12 noon.   Wright State University School of Medicine Office of Admissions      (italics are mine)   heh heh heh. i'm still considering possible courses of action, trying to decide exactly how ornery i feel about the whole thing. on some level, it's beyond hilarious. yet had i not been accepted into another medical school, far from funny would it be. also, who else got this email, and are they flipping burgers because they didn't get in anywhere else? i would love to know who else is on this mailing list. i'm accepting suggestions for a way to embarass that office a bit, since they were  so damned courteous  when i was on pins and needles, waiting to find out what my future would be.   i have a feeling that this is the beginning of a long career in dealing with the absurd.

        They Have Pre-Wrapped Sausages, But They Don't Have Pre-Wrapped Bacon    so the day-long vigil begins... i am enjoying my "day off" and praying that no one in the greater sandusky area who is a patient of Dr. Hill's gets sick enough to be admitted today. if everyone just stays their happy asses at home, i get to have a leisurely day of reading, enjoying the quiet, and maybe a nap. but if someone keels over, it's my butt that gets called in to the hospital to take an excrutiating history and physical. so here's hoping.  my weekend was wonderful. our stinky friday conference got cancelled, so i got to chill for the afternoon with dave and then enjoy a quiet evening at home with james. we grilled up some chicken and burgers and potatoes, and just generally enjoyed not working. actually, james is working diligently on his portfolio for a convention next week. i did a paltry amount of laundry, cleaned the bathroom, and then decided that was enough. saturday i managed to get about 2 hours of actual reading done at panera. mostly i talked myself into it so i could have one of their low-carb bagels with some cream cheese, and all the coffee i could stomach. i just don't have the endurance for studying like i used to. gone are the 12-hour days of reading, gone are the 8-hour shifts at panera. if i can get two hours of uninterrupted time in before i resort to checking my email or surfing the web on my palm pilot, then i'm lucky. perhaps i really do have adult-onset ADD. or maybe the temptation of free wi-fi at panera is just too great. perhaps i'll have to study somewhere more low-tech. heh.  sunday was a blast. james spent the day working on his portfolio, so dave and i met my parents and my brother andrew at the boat. i have a deathly fear of motion sickness, but i managed to medicate properly this time (and the lake was about as calm as it ever is) so i avoided the pukes. the weather was  perfect --blue sky, mostly sunny, nice breeze, not too hot. we fished for perch, but didn't do so well. i think we caught about 13 that we kept, but we had to lower our standards so that we would actually have fish to take home. much of what we caught was probably small enough to be bait for the fish we would have liked to catch. my parents look great, my dad turned 58 yesterday, my mom is tanned and beautiful and enjoying her last few days of summer before it's back to the surly teenagers. andrew just got back from thailand, where he was living in a little village, sightseeing, working the rice paddies, and seeing girly boy shows. he brought me a gorgeous sarong skirt--it's cranberry colored and has little jingly bells and metal elephants on the front. very cool. he looks great too; he shaved his head before he went to thailand and was sporting a little beard. i can't believe he's 18. he looks much older than he did a few weeks ago.  after the boat trip, dave and i headed back to sandusky and killed some time driving around and enjoying the day. we found one of the many local wineries (which shouldn't surprise anyone) and tasted all the featured wines. and since it's not possible to stop at a winery without purchasing some of the wares, we left with three bottles of our favorites: a lovely pinot grigio, a delightful merlot, and a cabernet blanc, which i had never tried before and was delicious. i think i'll bring a bottle or two over to my parents' house tomorrow night, which should just about make up for the fact that i will leech dinner off of them. and maybe a little cash.  questions to ponder: why is the four-lane highway that comes out of toledo (route 2) only 50 MPH, while the speed limit goes up to 55 MPH when the road narrows into two lanes? no wonder there are so many damned accidents. second question: why is there a wildlife preserve within spitting distance of the davis-besse nuclear power plant? shouldn't that be the last place we should be putting the wildlife preserves? dave feels that it's along the lines of the canaries the miners used to take into the mine shafts (as in "if the animals start to drop dead then we're in deep shit"), but i don't know if i buy that.  dave and i thought of these things along route 2, on the way to port clinton. we discussed them and have come to no great conclusions.  11:30. hospital cafeteria starts serving lunch. hope it's Pig Parts or Dog Burger.

        Blue Skies, Smiling At Me    i have decided that, despite the fact that i am in sandusky, living in a dorm, away from james and all my fun toys, i am enjoying myself. part of the "feel good" day is that dave and i drove to my parents' house last evening for some family lovin'. incidentally, it's only a 45 minute drive. compare that to the full hour it takes to get to toledo. in any case, my wonderful mother (who also happens to be a loyal blog reader) made a delicious dinner of barbeque chicken, corn on the cob, salad, and these totally satanic little cookies. somehow, approximately six of them managed to make their way into my mouth. might have had something to do with the excessive wine consumption that preceded dessert. so i counted up the points this morning (as best as i could remember) and it wasn't pretty. but whatever. hospital cafeteria is getting old already, and who can  possibly  turn down home cooking when one gets it so infrequently? and  sheesh,  i've managed to lose 7 lbs in 2 weeks, so perhaps the stress burns the fat right off. hah.  another reason that i am content is that i'm only on my second real day of work this week. i've been rounding the patients every morning at the hospital, but the past two days have been free. i had an admit on tuesday, but yesterday was quiet and i managed to scare up the energy to get a very small amount of reading done. and right now i'm back at the dorm, since we finished hospital rounds at 9:00 and i don't have to be at the office until 10:00. so i am enjoying a cup of hospital coffee, and some fresh berries which are surprisingly delicious. most importantly, someone else washed them and cut them up and put them in a little cup, and i didn't have to pay for them. life is good, right at this very moment.  and the kicker is that i don't have a full day tomorrow, either. i have to be back for Totally Useless Conference at MCO at 1:30, which means i would have to leave sandusky by 12:15 or so, to be able to get to MCO in time. but as i am extraordinarily lucky, my doctor told me that he'd just dismiss me after hospital rounds, around 9:00 again. it's a tough f-ing life, and i damn well deserve this break after last month. i really took it for granted that i was eating, sleeping, pissing, and studying on someone else's time. i feel like i get to own just a little of my time here, and it's nice. serious amounts of reading need be done, and i'm starting to have visions of not knowing what i need to know for the shelf exam at the end of september. this month should provide some opportunities for hitting the books.  probably there will be some boating this weekend, which means there will be some barfing unless diane does some drugging first. i have to decide which side effects i would prefer: dry eyes and mouth, dilated pupils, or drowsiness. i'm hoping to pursuade dave to come with, so maybe he can drive, thus taking care of the drowsiness issue. andrew will be home from thailand, so i can't wait to hear about the rice paddies and the girly boy show. that's right, folks, andrew checked out a drag show in bangkok. i hear it was pretty good.  well, back to "work". heh.

        Summertime, And The Livin' Is Easy    ah, the joys of dorm life! i am sitting in the "lounge area" of my old-school nursing dorm, on the south campus of the firelands regional medical center in sandusky, ohio. keith is telling a story about how he didn't get along with another dorm resident from ohio state. right at this moment he is talking about how he counseled this unfortunate young lad about how to pick up women. riiiiight.  i have my own room, which is far larger than my cave from freshman year at OSU. we share bathrooms, which i can handle for a month. there's a little kitchen in the "lounge area", but there are zero utensils, pots, pans, plates, etc. luckily, i am a girl scout at heart, and i brought enough stuff to moderately stock the kitchen and make it ready for business. i was off of work at 3:45 today, so i managed to find the mall, some restaurants, and a very well stocked kroger. i think i'm set. dave came up from fremont, and we got some pizza and discussed our respective places of work. this week i luck out, since i have the usual day off (tuesday) and also another day (wednesday). i still have to round the hospital admits before 8:00 am, but i can handle getting up early if i can come back for a nap at 10:30. heh. and dave is off early on wednesdays, so he and i are going to drive out to visit my 'rents and maybe get some free eats.  and no weekends, as far as i can tell. this is much, much better than last month.  also, my preceptor is a nice guy, very laid back with pretty low expectations, i think. this might be the time to look really good, and get some stellar evals. so off i go to bed, to get up at the ass crack and be ready to impress at 8:00 sharp.
