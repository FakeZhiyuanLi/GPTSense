      (I made this up after my last day of school.)  Today is the last day No more test of any kind No more boring history movies, That makes you wish you were blind. How happy I will be until week three. Time goes by so slow when you aren't learning.

      (I wrote this for my best friend Ciara West)  Today someone asked me...What is a friend to you? A friend is someone that loves and cares about you. A friend is someone you can trust. A friend can always dust away your fears. A friend never says never. And friends always stay friends forever.

       Writing for Him is what I do  When I write for Him I am never blue. His name is Jesus what can I say My heart is with Him through out the day And that is how it will stay.

      (I made this up when I was signing me niece's year book. She is going into second grade.)   Second grade will be fun  Running at recess is so much fun! Never turn away from God Keep him close to your heart And you and God will never part!

      Tonight I Looked up into the sky And to my surprise Was the big,white moon. I felt like taking a bite. But at my height. No way, That wouldn't happen anyday. Maybe I could fly- Fly up so high I could touch the sky How will I get wings to fly so high to touch the sky? Just think happy thoughts and I'll give you pixie dust. No way that will be a bust. But lets try anyway. Lets go up,up, and away!

      (this isn't really a poem but still read it)  Life can be hard but it is also sweet. When you think of life it seems so far away, And you feel your on delay. Don't even think your life is right for you? Well your wrong. God gave us our lives for a purpose. No doubt about that. Maybe you can't find love. God knows why you wonder. Maybe you can't have a child. God must want you to adopt. That will be whats best. Maybe your struggling with buying a car or a house.  God has a different plan you, and you have to stick to what he wants you. Well Life is what Life is. And you you can't turn away. If you turn away from life you will never get anything acompished.

      (I wrote this poem for my sister Tami)    She works hard all the time, But she get through the day without any pain, Washing her clothes with her gain.  Everynight she pours out poems as she goes along. When she writes her poems thats were she belongs. Do not disturb her, do not talk.  When she is done and you read you'll be in shock; For what she writes is so great and true. Every single one she writes is knew.   After writing poems she goes to bed, and falls a sleep, and counts many sheep.  She dreams of a place were only she can go. Goodnight and don't wake her til' morning.
