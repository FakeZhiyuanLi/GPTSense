      Isaac - April 2004 Update Email Hello family and friends.   Let me begin by thanking you all for your prayers and support for our family during these uncertain and difficult times. We can't express enough just how much your messages and calls of concern have meant to us.   These past few weeks have probably been the toughest we have yet to endure. As you know, for the past 22 months, Isaac's puzzling physical and mental issues have left us with far more questions than answers.   After months of little or no insight from the established medical community, our own research led us to some other potential possibilities regarding Isaac's condition. Then, just last month, our suspicions were confirmed by Dr. Mary Megson, a Developmental Pediatrician, from Richmond - Isaac is Autistic.   As mentioned, this has been a particularly tough time for our family. We are, however, very optimistic for Isaac's future and recovery. Why? Two reasons, really. First, we serve The Creator and He knows Isaac inside and out. He can heal Isaac and He will in His time. Secondly, in the pursuit of researching Autism and Isaac's particular symptoms we have been directed to a course of action which we pray will combat this disorder in a highly effective fashion.   In the process of implementing a new regimen, dietary and nutritional, we have unfortunately observed a regression in Isaac. He has lost a significant amount of weight and now, once again, exhibits more prominent and typical autistic tendencies - most of which of a terrifying nature, like walking in circles, periods of mindless staring and an indifference to pain.   The progress we witnessed just a few months ago now appears to be slipping away. At the end of January, you may recall, we began to know a boy who started to express some affection. I will never forget the times in his life, not long ago, when Isaac would wake at night around 2 or 3 AM in a crying fit. Sarah and I would almost instantly leap from bed and debate whose turn it was to gather up our little boy. And, on my nights, I remember racing up the stairs to embrace my son. Once rescued he would then melt his little body in my arms and gently rest his head on my shoulder while clutching to his papa. It was so incredible and I could care less how much sleep I lost. Each time, at that moment, nothing could compare. This was a treasure for me as I received an opportunity to feel some sense of love from my son. It is now rare that Isaac will reciprocate any affection we shower upon him.   While this road seems so difficult, we are confident in our Lord. Our faith in the Almighty sustains us and we can't even fathom how anyone could carry on through such a trial of this nature without the Author of life and hope. Further, I can't tell you how proud I am of Isaac's mom. Sarah's dedication to Isaac is awesome and her investment in obtaining the knowledge needed to assist our son has been an nothing short of inspirational.   Just last weekend we both attended a semi-annual conference, Defeat Autism Now (DAN!) in DC. I attended Saturday while Sarah immersed herself in the current research and effective treatment options for 3 full days. It was truly an amazing conference that brought together leading researchers, physicians of all types and parents, all sharing a common commitment to seek plausible reasons for the disorder and remedies. If you are interested in learning more about Autism and the approach we are following, we recommend you check out http://www.autism.org/ and/or Karyn Seroussi's article in Parents Magazine from February 2000 at http://www.autismndi.com/PMarticl.htm .   In the coming weeks, we are praying to see significant progress in our Champ. The deterioration we are yet again witnessing, we hope, will just equate to a "die-off" of bad bacteria and invasive allergic agents. We hope and pray that the new intervention we have embarked on will yield the positive results we have seen and heard evidenced in many other improved and even RECOVERED Autistic children.   I am asking for your continued prayers as well. Please join us in prayer for Isaac's improved appetite and gastrointestinal issues, which we hope will lead to his growth and development. In addition, please pray for wisdom as we navigate through the weeks and months ahead.   We would also be so thrilled to see our little boy simply look us in the eye. Oh what a joy we would experience if just his one good eye, his right, would tenderly speak to us for him. Sadly, the only sustained eye contact I have seen him keep with either of us was just this past Monday. Once again as he endured the anguish of having his blood drawn, through tears, he longingly looked at Sarah.   Also, Isaac currently has just one word in his vocabulary - "papa." Oh how I hope and earnestly pray that by Mother's Day Isaac would simply call out "mama!" I can't express in words here just how much this would mean to Sarah and how much joy this would truly bring to our home.   In closing, let me just say, once again, that God is good and that life here on earth is so short and precious. Each of our lives represents barely a fraction of a grain of sand in the hourglass of eternity. We are therefore so grateful to have the assurance, through Jesus Christ, of life everlasting in heaven with our Lord. There, in paradise, we look forward to praising our God alongside our perfected boy.   Thank you again for all of your prayers and tender care.   Sincerely,   V   Victor, Sarah, Abi and Isaac (Champ)
