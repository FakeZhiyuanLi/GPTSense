      ok well no one reads this and i know it (exept MAYBE sam) so im just guna put a whole buncha love quotes in here. yah im not a very big fan of them but im bored and alot of them actually do express my feelings. so here it goes  "some say love is a razour that leaves the soul bleeding."   "There are so many things I wish I could tell you, but I can't. I'm not sure if you would ever understand because I don't understand half of it. I want to be with you so bad, but I'm so afraid of getting hurt and because of that, I end up getting hurt more. I can sit here and say that I don't care about you and that I'm not going to let you hurt me, and just by saying that I know that you can and have. Itâ€™s not your fault, it never is. Its me."  "i cant cry hard enough for u to hear me"  "I know i made a lot of stupid mistakes in my life but the worst one was thinking the person who hurt me the most wouldent hurt me again"  "The worst feeling in the world is loving someone when they dont love you back . Your heart aches  , everytime you see him knowing that no matter how deep you look into his eyes trying to reach there heart you never will"  "I could fill a thousand pages telling you how i felt, but still you'd never understand. so now i leave without a sound exept that of my heart shattering as it hits the ground"  "When i see you smile and know its not for me, that is when i will miss you the most."  "I know i have a heart, cuz i can feel it breaking".-Wizard Of Oz  "If this is just a crush i dont think i could handle the real thing."  "love can be deep inside, or it can be suicide"  "love me or hate me but spare me your indifferance"   "love is very real, you will find it some day. but it has one enemy. and thats life."  "The person who tries to live alone will not succeed as a human being. His heart withers if it does not answer another heart. His mind shrinks away if he hears only the echoes of his own thoughts and finds no other inspiration."  "Love is a perky elf dancing a merry little jig and then suddenly he turns on you with a miniature machine gun. " (love that 1)  "she loved him, pride be damned, for it was lost, cast along with dignity upon the shores of emotion. for come what may in truth she could not deny him, nor herself"   alrite im done with them. well nothings really happened lately. i stayed in the sun till i about got skin cancer, but i still dontt gota tan! oh well. i think im gina go now.   ~Cya at the show ~LeVi

      hey all. well yah i skipped a day. But I was having fun! (surprise surprise)Cailyn stayed the night last night and my brother was home (he was stoned) and he was throwing our dog in the air, chanting 'WEEEEE!!!" it was hilarious. Me and Cailyn just sorta hung out for a while, (all night really) and yah...It was great. I didn't wanna go skating. u know why i didn't wana go skating? cuz IM tired of these little low life assholes who go there to fuckin slob down there boy friend or girlfriend!!! I mean really, who really wants to be skating, look over and see you basically humping someone. i dont. you people really need to get a fuckin room, IM tired of being afraid to go in the god damn bathroom because threes probably some fuckin orgy going on. u wana fuck in the bathroom? GO IN UR OWN GOD DAMN BATHROOM!!thats just my opinion. if u wana hump, hump in the privacy of ur own home. stay the fuck away from me.>:-O after Cailyn left i pretty much played the Sims (delux edition) ALL day. well after like 12 hours of Sims, ive decided to give up for the night and write in my blog.  The title of my Blog today, is "all the summer nights, spent wondering" (quote from Mest/Jaded, featuring Benji madden) I named it that beacuse...well...its a summer night...and im wondering. lol (obvious) yah im about to tell u what i was wondering, so if u dont wana hear this shit, X outa this journal now.  Alrite, here it goes.. I was pretty much wondering if things r ever guna change, things here have been shit for pretty much everyone around me all fuckin year. things need to take a change, but they eather get worse or stay the same. its bullshit. ive been living a slow hell for almost a fucking year, and im about tierd of it.  (sick and tierd, of being sick and tierd. quote from Mrs.Stover.lol) Alrite well now i think i oughta go, im sure your all tierd of me and my bullshit (if uve eaven red this far) but before i go, i know this journal isint the most exiting thing in the world, but hey im not writing my fuckin inner most thoughts in this. if i did you all would no whole lota shit u dont need to so yah...i had to tell ya. well then  ~Cya at the show ~LeVi

      Well yah like I told you I would write in my blog later on, and I did! Wow. Well after my last blog I went outside (in the rain) and rode my bike. I accidentally ran over a piece of glass and now I got a flat (dads pissed at me now) I wish it would stop raining. Its been raining ALL day and IM about tired of it. it makes everything so boring, and blah. Now if it was a thunderstorm, that would be the shit. LOL but NoOoOoOo!!!! >:-o its just been drizzling all day. This is BULLSHIT. I went online later on and checked my Yahoo mail. It was all mostly fan mail from a GC site. Good Charlotte is getting Punk'd on MTV on June 13th!  (woo-woo!!) and I found out GC's next album (due in September of '04') is guna be called 'The Chronicles Of Life And Death'. The title isn't very "Good Charlittey" but oh well, as long as its good music and there still as sexy as ever. lol. i don't really like the title though. It reminds u to much of that new movie that's comin out (The Chronicles Of Riddick) but w/e floats there Boat. CHELSEA MITE BE MOVING!!!!!!!!! NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my little Crack Baby cant move!!!! dude u just DONT do that. well if she moves, she says her parents r still guna drive her to South to go to skool, so thats cool. at least ill see her at skool. Lizzy called, i  talked with er a while and then i went to the book store. mom got a book called 'Merrick' by Anne Rice. its about Witches and Vampires. (freaky, but i cant talk beacuse im reading an Anne Rice Book now about Vampires) I got Gone With The Wind. (fav movie) im guna read it buts its f(#&% huge, and its guna take me a while but its alota ROAR points and if its as good as the movie, it will be a good read. Travis called. we talked a while. most the wime, Garrett just kinda screamed in the background or said weird things, but hes funny so i didnt care. Ryann called to and she was playing Vice city and running ppl over, and killing them and she couldent stop saying "Dawg" lol. Ryann's my buddy though, u gota love her. well like my Blog title says, its 1 AM (1:15 now, after writing :-D) and yah i gotsta go.  ~cya at the show ~LeVi

(what fun) I talked on the phone with FrEd for like an hour and a half. we talked about the usual things. AND I KNOW SHES HIDING SOMETHING BUT SHE WONT TELL ME!!!!!! >:-o Shelbo told me that Mrs.S mite move up to 8th grade teacher. (hope so) shes a sweet teacher. but its not official or anything yet.
