      So oddest thing. After we got back from food shopping and finished dinner, I went to the bathroom. I know what you're thinking, not so odd. Well it's what happened to the shower while I was in the bathroom that was odd. It was dripping. Now we hadn't seen one drop come out of that faucet since Friday around 10:00. So I grabbed Jared's tools (mine were at the bottom of my closet and I'm lazy) and with the pliers turned the control that would normally be hooked up to the knob. Well when I turned it the water started flowing a little heavier (now we're talking a trickle here). So I called Jared and he was like, "well hey." That's pretty much how I felt too.   The plumber is coming in the morning and we now have a trickling faucet instead of a non-running faucet. So interestingly enough the trickle was warm and I came up with the brilliant (thank you) idea to leave it running, seeing as my dad's diagnosis of the situation was a frozen pipe. Left it on and went to watch some football.   About a half hour to an hour later we head to the bathroom for another reason, forgetting the tub was trickling, and we hear running water. The faucet had a full stream of running water. So it appears as though Dad gets a bonus point for knowing what was wrong (we think). Tried it out, shower was full and warm and wonderful. From Friday night at 10:00 to Sunday night at 10:00 we were without our shower, you don't realize how much you depend on things until they stop working.  It's snowing. Yeah, it's finally warm enough (ironic ain't it) to snow. Well this tropical weather won't last long, Wednesday is going to be as cold as Fri and Sat were. That basically means that it'll be "2 degrees" but feel like "-30 degrees with the wind chill." Can't we just say, "it'll be -30 today," why do we have to say what it really is, but then how it will feel to the human body? I ask you.  In other news, the future in-laws are going to come up this weekend. This will be the first time they've seen us since we've become engaged, so it should be interesting. Another little interesting tidbit, his next door neighbor, Barbara, will also be joining his parents for a night because she needs to drop off her daughter Allison at school in RI.   As you could guess, I have a lot of time this morning. I'm working in the lab at school. Now normally I have 2 shifts at least. This semester I only have one and it's only 3 hours long. This is it. I'm working here from 8:30-11:30. The only reason I'm even considering staying is because I have time to work 3 hours here and then go to class followed by Children's. If I didn't work here, I'd be leaving for Children's right now, leaving at 11:15 to get to class that's across from the building I'm working in right now, and then going BACK to Children's for work again from 1:45 to 5. That's what I do on Thursdays, and I think one day a week is quite enough for that. I'm going to see how much I get in my first paycheck, I should have gotten another raise since it's a new semester, we'll see. If it's more than I'd be making at children's in 2.5 hrs, then I'll stay. If it's less, then I'll tell Cyndi that I can't work this shift anymore and I'll do the commute back and forth for the rest of the semester.  That reminds me, I'm so tired of school. I need to start sending out resumes asap seeing as I'm graduating May 1st and I'll need a full-time job the week after.   Hmm, it's stopped snowing and the sun seems to be breaking through. You know what they say about New England, "don't like the weather? Wait a minute and it'll change."

      Well I just showered in the sink. Yup that's right. How you may ask? Well I didn't literally sit in the sink and shower myself. I washed my hair in the kitchen sink and then while standing in my not so functioning shower, I took bowls full of water and washed up. Yeah, not too wonderful.   The maintenance guy showed up early this morning at 10:30, but needed a new handle (we have one of those turn the knob to the left and keep turning and turn to the right to shut off) cause there was apparently something wrong with it. Comes back an hour later after a "quick" trip to Home Depot. Installed the new knob, shower won't turn on. That was the problem to begin with. It's happened a couple of times before but we've been able to fix it. This time we couldn't and neither could the maintenance guy. So he called the plumber. Waited on him for awhile. Decided at 1:30 to call the realty place and find out when exactly the plumber was coming. Yeah, "first thing tomorrow morning." Just ducky.   So I took my shower in the sink and it's now Jared's turn. After that we're going food shopping which we've needed to do very badly, but because of the intensely fridgid temps, couldn't. Slightly annoyed still that the plumber won't be here till tomorrow. Wondering if 2 playoff football games on TV have anything to do with it, hmmm.....

      Well two of my friends, Alice and Mark decided to get blogs and I was curious as to what they were. It seems to be pretty nifty. Seems more "designed" than LiveJournal and sounds cooler too. I'll still keep the LJ one, but we'll see, maybe this will take over.   In my last semester at school - feels awesome. Got engaged - even more awesome. Attempting to work on my resume/portfolio so I can get a cool job - feels overwhelming.  More to come at some point...

      Hmm, quite the long time since I've written.   So I've decided to switch over completely from livejournal to this. Why? Well first off, no 12 yr olds posting random crap to your entry and no one plopping an add in the comments section. AdWhores.   Annnnnnywho.   So today was an ok day. It's been a few weeks since I've felt decently normal. The bright happy Sarah isn't back 100% but she's made a couple of guest appearances. Today seems to be one of those days. And why? Well, no reason really. I guess because nothing bad or annoying happened today. The boss was in a good mood which means the employees are in a good mood. That's the main reason my ears aren't smoking per usual. Reason #2, I've come to the conclusion that since graduation is so soon, I'm gonna de-stress. Why am I getting myself in such a "tizzy" (yes I just used that word) over a class. Not even that, Capstone. It's Capstone, not "life."  Rules for next month: * Don't let Capstone ruin your day * Ignore boss when he's on rampage cause it's his fault not mine * Cherish every moment by working on Resume (yup, cherish) * Get lookin' for a new job so you can avoid aforementioned boss rampage  That's it for now, cause I've got class and a pizza that's calling me.

      AHH!!!!  TODAY IS A GOOD DAY! It started out as a somewhat icky day - but it's awesome now!  Reason #1: Dixon is gone for TWO WEEKS!!! Reason #2: in two weeks I will have GRADUATED!!! Reason #3: being that Dixon won't be around for the two weeks before my graduation I will have a very RELAXED two weeks!!! Reason #4: in exactly ONE WEEK the hell known as Capstone will be OVER at this time on Friday Apr. 23, I will be drinking to the end of Capstone and being done with college!!! Reason #5: One week from the end of Capstone is  GRADUATION!!!!!!!!   Today is a good day simply because of those reasons..... ahhhh.... will write more later :)

      ::yawn::  What? Surprised that I open an entry with a yawn. You shouldn't be. I'm pretty tired lately. At least it's more in that tired-exhausted way and not so much that tired-fedup way. Well, I'm still fed up with certain things, but I'm more sleepy than annoyed.   Why, you ask, is the sandman beating down my door? Simple, one word answer, FINALS. That's right ladies and gents. I had one final presentation last Wednesday, I had a final exam in History of Graphic Design (GD) today. Soon to be followed by mounds upon rotting mounds of Capstone with a  tiny  History of GD paper (due Monday, 5 page literary sourced and quoted) thrown in the mix. EEP.  But I can say that at least it feels like it's winding down. Work is still nuts, but on a semi-good note my review was approved meaning that I'm now a "full-time" employee working (only) 30 hrs a week making a (less than) satisfactory wage, but I get benefits (in a few weeks). So sufficed to say, I'm neutral on this topic. I'm still better than my boss and that raises my self-esteem level thru the roof.  Ok, well I think I've spent enough time working on this entry and putting off capstone, so I should probably get to that (at some point).

      BLOG - such an interesting word.  Sounds like "blot" as in "I'm gonna blot the hell out of this stain if it kills me" then again it sounds like "log" as in a tree or perhaps to "log on" to the internet (or Blogger in this case) then yet again, blog rhymes with "frog" Blogg er  is like "logger"  So do you think that Blogger is based on a logger who was cutting down a log with a frog sitting on it and leaving stains needing to be blotted out?   This is my mind ladies and gents.   I am currently at work. It's just after 2:00 and I just finished my lunch. I read all my friends livejournals, realized I hadn't written anything in a few days and decided to go for it. I didn't know what to write about then I realized "blog" is an actual real word now. Hmm, it'll join the likes of "spam" as in junk email, not the food - "d'oh" thank you Mr. Simpson - and "McJob" which we all know is completely politically incorrect (yeah).   So in 29 days I'll be a college graduate. Is it scary? No. Why? Cause contrary to popular belief, Northeastern really did prepare me for this. I worked a total of 24 months - that's 2 years of work and 3 years of college. I'm currently working 32 hrs a week in addition to my classes. So yeah, I'm ready to be done with school. Will I be sad? Yeah, but only about certain things. People that I've seen almost everyday I'll now probably never see again. I have people's IM names, but if I don't talk to them now, what are the chances of after school? Not much. Not to mention more people than I would have thought are going back home.   The job situation? Well, I have one. I think I'll leave it at that. Nah, on second thought.... I have a job. I have a job for after graduation too. It pays low and has crappy hours, but has benefits. That's the main reason I'm still working here now. I don't have the benefits yet, but as soon as my review goes thru it'll take effect. Well, it's good work. My boss isn't the best and my co-workers aren't all that fun, but they at least keep my boredom level down. So, I'm satisfied with the job, but as soon as I have a few free moments, I'll be getting my portfolio assembled and online/printed out. Also the job hunt will be on.  Time to create a screenshot of something we haven't even done yet just so my boss can "show" that it's done. Yeah...

      Post graduation...(as my friend Mark's cap stated) Bring it!  I'm ready to go, I can't wait to get where I want to be. I'm still working at Children's and I'm hoping by the week's end I'll be giving my @ss of a boss my notice. The interview today, oh excuse me, my emergency dental work, went really really well. It was odd, but really cool. I want, no I NEED this job. The company is fun and the pay and benefits are even funner. Yes that's right FUNNER. I make up words to suit my needs, so there.   Graduation was great. Nothing better than going into the Fleet Center where the players show up and be corralled with the rest of the cattle, I mean graduates. We were rowdy and cluttered backstage, but stepping out into the Fleet Center and seeing the thousands of people there, AMAZING feeling. I wanted to cry. Got to my seat where, leave it to Northeastern, I had one last form to fill out that we needed to hand to the person giving us our diplomas. By the way - GPA of 3.509, AWE YEAH. And of course I didn't get that without fighting for it. My GPA was a 3.499 and I was one/thousandth of a point away from Magna Cum Laude. Now I KNOW that I deserved at least a B+ in last semester's Capstone 1 so I emailed the powers that be, otherwise known as my professors and asked (begged whatever) to give me a B+ and get rid of the B. They were gracious and kind (and I accepted their bribe to help with the Trace project thru the summer) and changed it. They ended up with nice parting gifts - Dunkin's Coupons and a cute plant.   The family and future in-laws were beaming from ear to ear and it was a swell weekend all around. On a side note, the "thank God Sarah's done college, let's give her money fund" raised enough to get me out of credit card debt. Thank you family members for all contributions, you will be receiving your complimentary and redundant thank you card in the mail shortly.   Now what? Well I have a job. I will hopefully be getting a newer, better job and then I can start planning a move and a wedding. Yay fun :)

      Oi. That's all I really have to say about the past couple of weeks. I haven't written in awhile and I know that I've wanted to but I didn't. That's that, I just didn't.  So what induced my less than Jewish mouth spit out the most wonderful of Yiddish words? No idea.  I'm not stressed, that's for sure. I've left the stress behind when I grabbed my diploma. I took a week off after leaving Children's which I needed. It went by too quickly, like all vacations do. So then I started my new job.   I'm loving it. It's exactly what I wished for and you know what they say about being careful what you wish for. Well, I wanted a fast paced job and sufficed to say, I got it.   They started me on a project my first day that was supposed to end on Friday. Well both ends had mishaps and well, it's Monday now. So I'm still working on it. It's SO close to being finished. The second it's done I really don't know what I'll be doing with myself cause I don't have any new side projects yet. I'll have to see.   So it's been so chaotic that I just haven't been able to do anything I wanted to. Basically set up my section how I want it to be. My co-workers LOVE to work in the dark, in fact, Jason has built somewhat of a cave around his 3 monitors (football replay monitor style) to keep all light out. So basically we have 3 florescent lights on and that's definately NOT enough light for this whole room. I need to order lamps and haven't been able to order ANYTHING because of how busy I've been. I'm hoping this breathing period will continue a little longer so I can do that.  Oi  But after that fact things have been going really well. The best news...  We set a date for the wedding and not only that but we have a ceremony/reception site booked. WOO HOO. So far so good. Now to find an officiant to marry us outside a church, Oi again.

       Ok, so this past weekend was the engagement party. WOW is all I have to say. Jared's entire family and my Mom, Dad, and lil sis were there. Unfortunately Amie, Debbie, Carree, and Mike all couldn't make it. But they'll make it up to me (evil laughter here). But between our Families getting along AMAZINGLY well and the fun car rides and the amazing gifts and all the wonderful setiments and especially our Fathers' toasts that made everyone cry, I couldn't imagine a better time. It really was amazing.    &nbsp;  Next step: MOVING. This is going to be interesting, not only cause it's happening the weekend after the DNC (I'm hoping that week will go fine and nothing terrible will happen, I don't think I could handle it) or cause we couldn't get a truck in Boston, but because we have sooo much stuff. We finally worked out our move in date. Now if we can figure out the whole parking debacle it'll be 10 thousand times better.    &nbsp;  As for the wedding situation, Jared's mom is fine. She may not like it, but she's an awesome person (sorry about the previous post) and will not say anything else about it. Mom is also not saying anything else so I think the hard stuff is over believe it or not.     &nbsp;  So in 9 days we'll be Brooklians. I think that's what we'll be...

      This month has been CRAZY!  It's like, you get one thing done and you think that's it, when something else creaps up behind you like you're in a really bad horror movie (insert ::Dun Dun DUN:: here) and pounces on top of you almost knocking you down.   I shall 'splain.   1. Go to Brendan and Kim's wedding  *check* (1st weekend in July - gorgeous)      * pack      * get car      * drive      * go      * come back to Hampton NH for 4th festivities with the family      * back to Lawrence      * back to Boston   2. Spend 2nd weekend in July packing for move  *check-ish*  well that definately didn't go as planned. Got a lot done on Saturday, but Sunday - ugh. We started out by going to the movies which was fine, but then we had issues (still) with our move date (between Realtors being incompitent and landlords not calling, we have no clue when we'll be able to move, July 31 or Aug 1 - or where we'll stay in that 12 hr period between).   Then there's the whole parking space debacle, basically we were promised a parking space with the apt. Come to find out it's thru a private renter. Come to find out find out, he doesn't know if we can have it because, ironically enough (REALLLLLL funny - note sarcasm) he TOO rents apts and says HIS tenant might need it. WOOOOO HOOOO. So yeah, this moving thing is sooo fun so far (read #6 below)   3. Meet with Priest.  This was actually a surprise (see horror movie note above). I finally got in touch with a priest that understands common sense and will marry Jared (non-Catholic) and me outside of a Church. He believes someone who isn't Catholic shouldn't be forced to marry in a Church - gee, sounds reasonable doesn't it. SOOOOO, we've been emailing back and forth and decided to meet after his retreat in the middle of August. Well for whatever reason a co-worker of his sent my first email to him again. Now he wants to meet sooner. That's good cause I really want to know if he'll definately marry us or not and I didn't like the idea of waiting a month to begin with, but it's just insane that we'll be meeting with him Wed at 5:30 - more than a month earlier than planned. So we have to take off work early and rent a car, etc. I'm nervous. BLAH.   4. Engagement party July 17th.    Well see, that is Carree's birthday, so she can't be there (that's bridesmaid 1). Mike and Amie can't make it (bridesmaid 2 and usher 1). Debbie can come (yay!) and most of Jared's ushers will be there because they're from L.I. - that's where it is btw). My Mom, Dad and sister will be there, but no one else from my family. I understand that most of them are too old to travel and the ones that aren't have kids, but it's still kinda depressing - oh well. There will be a shower at some point, my family will go to that. So yeah, engagement party is Saturday, which means Dad, Jared, and I will all be taking the day off and with the addition of Mom we'll be driving down (4 hrs - ugh) nice and early Friday morning. We'll also be driving back nice and early Sunday morning - blah.    5. Finish packing  the 2nd to last weekend in July seeing as the following one is the projected move date. Yeah, we'll see how that goes.   6. Move into new Apt. Aug 1  (hopefully July 31)      * pack      * find movers (by "movers" I mean friends and family I won't pay)      * hire truck  I discussed the moving issues above and I'm not going to do it again - I'm just going to sum up. We need to get all our crap together with all the other stuff going on and find time to move in between work, traveling, and planning the wedding. I want to move, but I almost feel as though I won't have enough time to have closure. I know that sounds dumb, but I want to have closure with this apt. It's small, the hallway usually smells like trash, it's always hot, and there's roaches. BUT it was the first "real" apartment I had, the first time I had my own room and the first apartment I shared with Jared. I painted my room and have a mural above the door on a glass pane. If I can't get that out then I hope someone will enjoy it and not paint over it, I still want to try to get it out. We'll see.   So while I don't want to push the moving back any later than the 1st, things are just going so quickly that I don't think I'll ever "feel" as though I moved. It'll just be like some place I can go back to, even though I can't. It'll be exciting and really sad at the same time.   In between all those big things we have the little things too. Today after work I'm getting my haircut which for everyone else on the planet isn't a big deal - but I don't like it. It scares me. I have issues with hairdressers because when I was a kid either Mom told them to do something I absolutely did NOT want to my hair OR they totally butchered what I asked for. I have REALLY long hair for a reason. It's because if for whatever reason they f***up I still have a few extra inches to fix it.   But this time I'm finally getting an actual real cut. I'm not just chopping a few inches off straight or getting a trim, this will be an actual designed cut. I'm scared half to death, but I know that's irrational because I'm not asking for anything drastic and I'm going to Newbury St cause I'd rather pay a little more for a good designer than save $ by going to Supercuts and have them ruin my hair (they ripped my ends apart last visit and cut it uneven the time before). I'm not paying $100+ for a hair cut, but it'll be more than $20, I'm fine with that. Besides the amount of times I get my hair cut a year (2 at the most) I think I can pay more. I'm not getting it dyed or anything, I like my real color too much. It's brown, yeah, but I have awesome red highlights that I would hate to cover.   Then there's the laundry that needs to be done, the cleaning before we leave, the working from 9-5 (oh yeah) and all the other little things that are so important but yet we some how forget that.  Until next time...

       Wow, I can't believe we moved already. I waited forever for this move (forever of course being under a month - so impatient). Then Saturday came and went. It's now Monday, I'm at work thinking about how much needs to be done to our new place to make it ours. I feel like a just went on a trip, not that I actually moved.       Annika (my boss) is out today. Her boyfriend got into a motorcycle accident and he broke his collarbone. It could have been much worse, but still, ouch! So she's staying there to wait for what's left of the bike to be delivered and to get his meds in order. Kathy is also out today, not sure why. Maybe cause Jason and I took Friday off she wanted to take today off too. I dunno. I didn't even know Jason took Friday off. But he did and went to Nantucket and got burned to a crisp. He took me to Somerville today to Anna's Tanquiera to get burritos. Very very good and really nice to get out of the office on a nice day like today. You don't seem to mind the heat when you're going 80mph down 93 in a Mini with the roof open and the windows down :)      But back to the move. Oi. This is really a huge step for us and we have a bunch of huge things to do. When I go to sleep at night I don't know what to think. I wake up in the morning knowing where I am, but still not getting it. I know I moved, it's done and over with, but the room is soooo huge, not to mention the rest of the apt. that I don't know how to take it. I've never occupied a room this size. I feel as though it's almost too big, then Jared reminds me a room can "never be too big." I don't necessarily agree with that, oh well.    Saturday was the move day. Friday, Jared and I took off work expecting to have a ton of work to do. We didn't. Apparently we were better prepared for this move than originally thought. We we finished the majority of packing Friday morning around 11. The cable guy was supposed to come between 9 and 11 to pick up the boxes, but in sterotypical "cable guy" style, he didn't show up till 2:30. That's 5 and a half hours from the beginning of our window. We get $20 credit, but somehow I don't think that's an appropriate award.       Anywho, after he came we found out that we were really really bored and had NOTHING to do. We had no tv, nothing to do online, and all the packing was finished. We went to the MFA because we can get in free (woo student IDs that don't expire)  and we probably wouldn't be back in the NU area for awhile. Afterwards we walked the roads that our moving truck would be traveling. We knew how to get to Brookline by walking, driving on the other hand...well, at least we figured it out. When we got to Landmark Center, we saw Mr. Penance, Mark Wooding himself, with a newbie lab rat. He seems to be doing well, starting a business with Amie (bridesmaid) and James (of the Jimi variety), Amie's sig. other. I hope they'll do well.       So then after going to Connor Larkin's for the last time (as neighbors anyway) we went upstairs to play a game of scrabble and go to bed. Woke up Saturday morning nice and early (7:30 :P) to begin the move. Mom, Dad, Aunt Patti, and Kevin were coming in for 9:00-9:30, they showed up at 8:30 (yay :D) and we started. Jared and Kev went to get the truck while the rest of us started packing up what was left. We took the ACs out of the windows, took the desks apart, packed up the curtains, transfered the food to a cooler, grabbed the TP :P. Jared and Kev got back with the truck. Amazingly enough we got a parking space, but no keys because the cleaning people came to get them and didn't return them.       We loaded everything we could fit into the truck and the already packed (with engagement gifts and clothes stored at my parent's house) minivan and drove to Brookline, that took all of FIVE minutes to get to - so close to the city, yet far enough away. We pulled up to the apt. (again, got parking, very very lucky) and started unloading. Both the loading and unloading of the truck, including waiting for the keys to show up (20 mins) and also the driving time, we took about 4 hours. NOT shabby. The relatives (who were now joined by Russ - best man) really like our new apartment. Upon inspection, we discovered lots of little problems that need to be fixed, but nothing drastic that we need to live there. Mom (OCD cleaning queen) decided that she and Dad (under his own free will?) would stay in Brookline while Russ, Aunt Patti, Kevin, Jared and I would go back to Boston and close up shop on Huntington Avenue.       We got there, threw the 3 or 4 things into the trunk that we still had left to take and cleaned the sand off the floor from our deteriorating carpets (don't buy them at Home Depot). Russ, Aunt Patti and Kev headed back to the van while Jared and I had a private moment in our 1st home.       That's really what it was. When I moved in, it became much more than an apt across the street from school. It was a huge step. Jared and I moved in together, that's huge. This was also the 1st time in my entire life that I had my own room. The third and most important memory I have of our old place is that Jared proposed to me there, in his room. That was the room where we hugged and I cried as we left. It's the end of an era. The apartment was a small crappy and loud place, but the memories made inside there were so important. By leaving the apartment, we left not only physical momentos behind (my starry night painting and the purple walls), but some of the best and important events of our lives. We moved in together there, graduated there (not actually there, but ya know...), and became fiances there. It's so sad to leave that behind knowing it's over and I'll never be able to go back and visit, but at the same time, I'm excited for what's ahead at our new place.       And the post keeps going...      So after we moved in and everyone left, we looked at the damage. Living room looks great. My bedroom had a broken jack that dad fixed (yay for super technically savvy dad!) and a window that won't close. Jared has a window that won't stay open and the window in the kitchen is cracked. Our windows are horrible (in case you didn't get that). I want them replaced, we'll see if that happens :P. There's an AC in my room, it's old and we had to clean the entire thing out by ripping it apart, it's still not very clean, but a hell of a lot better than what was there originally. It works well, it's just that it's in a huge window, the top part, inside a piece of plywood. It's probably going to get very drafty come winter, I'd really like to put it (or mine) in the lower window and get rid of the plywood. Then in the 2 hall closets there's 2 light switches in each closet. In both closets only 1 switch works and we don't know what the other 1 does.       The kitchen (aside from the broken window) had a disgusting oven (appently the cleaning people don't know how to clean and just wiped stuff over, not really cleaning anything) that was sprayed, but the gook wasn't removed, Mom did that. The left front burner also smokes. The garbage disposal is broken and rusted shut. The faucet drips and apparently goes with the disposal and caused the wood underneath the sink to become stained and rotted. That'll need to be replaced. The sprayer also doesn't work. There's 3 smoke detectors, 2 work.       The bathroom was DISGUSTING.   This Melissa girl that moved out is a dirty, immature person that should never be allowed to buy a house.       The bathroom tub, we'll start with that. Well the drain works fine, that's good. But the layer of soap scum that was on everything was so thick and hard and nasty, Dad took it upon himself to scrub the hell out of it, I don't know if I would have done that, I think I would have shown the landlord and been like, "do something about this..." But dad wanted to clean it. It looks great now. We had to scrub off 2 stickers, one that was worn out and another WBCN "Go Pats!" sticker. What the hell kind of an adult puts BUMPER STICKERS in the TUB!? Oh that's right, the same IDIOT THAT PUTS ON ON THE MIDDLE OF THE TOILET! So we had to remove 3 gross worn out stickers from our bathroom appliances. Each of the corners of the room (way more than 4) had a nice thick layer of CRUD that I needed to Fantastik away. The drain in the sink of course makes up for the shower in that it doesn't drain at all. It takes like 5 mins to drain after the faucet is on for all of 30 secs. The sink is still gross, I haven't had a chance to clean that yet. The floors in the whole apartment are disgusting, we walk from one end to the other in our bare feet and they're black. The toilet got stuck once, I'm hoping that's it. The vent is pretty gross, haven't had a chance to clean that yet. Once the sink is cleaned and the vent is vacummed and the floor is scrubbed to death, I can paint (the walls are also stained, gross gross woman) and the bathroom will be done. WOO!      This is really it...we LOVE the new place. It's big and lovely and the location is wonderful. There's stuff wrong with it, yes, but it's little things that we can tackle. The move was good, no one got hurt in the heat and we made decent time. Everything will work out. Things will be fixed that need to be and that's that. It just takes time. I'm sad that the old place SO fresh in my memory is just that, a memory, but this new place should be better and I can't wait to create some new memories...
