						   I am often asked why I am a vegetarian. I always find it a hard one to answer as the reasons have evolved over time and now cover a large range of factors. I think it is a subject where the more you learn the more amo you accumulate to "justify" (as if you need to) the stance and the inconvenience that it causes within a omnivirous society.  1. Economic reasons: Meat is expensive - even when I did eat meat it was mainly cheaper cuts. I think the economic reason was why I initially cut down on my meat intake as it was hell of a lot cheaper to not buy meat. That was back when I was first flatting. I could buy a lot more food with a fixed amount than if I included meat. I could concentrate on getting good food with the budget I had. Beans, rice, seasonal veges etc are comparitively cheap. Latterly my family primarily buys organic food.  I feel that the savings through not having meat on the food bill goes some way to help cover the premium prices of organic food (In NZ there is a big difference between organic and non-organic prices)  2. Health Benefits: I have read many studies that link health benefits to excluding meat from your diet. I don't see too much dispute within the research that it halves (or more) the incidents of heart disease and cancers. This was fairly compelling stuff. (I'l try and find some links) I also knew from my own experience that my body did not react well to eating meat. I would get at stress reaction where my muscles would go tense and I would get insomnia after eating meat. This was indicating to me that It may not be so good for me.  3. Conscience: It makes me feel good to know that animals are not being killed unnecesarily to feed me. I have heard a comment that goes something like: "In some situations eating animal flesh is a necessary evil, when there are other alternative it is not necessary so is just an evil".  4. Environmental: The huge numbers of domesticated animals is a distortion of the animal distributiions.  Natural wild animal habitats are removed to make way for a very limited diversity of domesticated animals along with the effluent, wormers, drenches, carcases, etc that are added to the environment.  This is a distortion of the range of animals that would otherwise occupy the countryside. There is also all of the land that has been cleared to make way for these pastures.  4. Meat is inefficient food. I have seen figures that show that if we only produced vegetarian food we could produce the same quantities as we currently do with a quarter less cultivated land than we currently use. Dispite what the Green revolution people claim - the world is not short of food even now the surplus's are in the wrong place. In the US cattle are used as a "protein sink" to dispose of the excess of grain and soybean that is being produced due to the distortions caused by farmer protections and subsidies.  5. I feel to be part of a 'movement'. My individual actions do make a difference. Friends and colleagues are aware that I am vegetarian so I believe that they will see that it can be done and each time they question me either openly or to themselves they will also have a spark of a question to themselves. "why do I eat meat?". I believe that most meat eating is due to upbringing, habit and social perseverence. We would never normally question the wisdom of it unless there is some prompt.   6. Following on from the above, another reason is logic. I am an analyst who has looked at meat eating and decided that there is no logic behind it. Essentially it is un-necessary and bad for our wellbeing and health. I do not like to do something I can not honestly justify so I can more easily justify being vegetarian than eating meat. I have read an argument that compares the logic of meat eating to that of smoking - it is bad for you, it is a habit, it gives a percieved sense of pleasure, it causes harm to others (in this case animals).  It would be an interesting debate to hear the other side - someone justifying why they eat meat.  Do people who eat meat research it to convince themselves of the merits (I certainly did not when I ate meat). I would expect that the only lines delivered to justify it would be based upon meat industry marketing babble regarding the iron and protien benefits of meat rather than researched verification.

						                  We do not have a television at our house. We do  have a TV but no reception to the house so we watch videos and DVDs once or  twice a week. It is many years since I have spent any time watching television  and can truly say I do not miss it.&nbsp; In the past I have been a TV addict  until I stopped and thought about the amount of time it wastes ang the crap that  is on.&nbsp; Here in NZ the level of advertising time crammed into the  programming is extreme. I believe that with Video/DVD it allows me to choose  what to watch and when and there are no adds.&nbsp; I also get out to the movie  theatre occasionally - often just going out on my own because I am too  disorganised to plan in advance -&nbsp;if our children are settled into bed at a  reasonable hour (8pmish) and my Wife is available to stay with the  them&nbsp;then&nbsp;I might&nbsp;decide to go out to catch a movie.      &nbsp;    I have really been enjoying SiFis lately - Vanilla  Sky, Minority Report, Truman Show, S1mone, Gattaca, Blade Runner - directors  cut, Being John Malcovich.

						   The greatest site around for movie facts and reviews is www.imdb.com.   Roger Ebert is usually right on the money as an external reviewer.  I had pegged this site many years ago before it went commercial and Roger was way down the list but over time I learned that his reviews were very close to my own tastes.  He is appears to rate based on Film quality (in relation to the whole package like acting, sound, editing, etc) and originality of ideas so he will rate a whole range of genre on this basis rather than his preference of subject or audience.  I think my tastes are similarly classed - normally I will prefer a movie that makes me think and has some original ideas. I would also prefer that it is well filmed and produced although in some cases this is not mandatory e.g. Blair Witch is a good example where the amature nature of the productiton added to the effect realism. Blair Witch's appeal was it's originality and it broke established film making rules or invented new ones.

						   I went to see Lost in Translation the other day with my wife.  I loved it - my wife hated it.  She thought that they should have hit the sack together. (they did but they didn't "hit" the sack together).  I think that the whole point of the movie is that they didn't, that thier relaltionship was at a different level i.e. they were two lost souls in this alien environment who connected. Gender and sex had little to do with it. I have great respect for Sofia Capolla as a director. So much goes unsaid in Her movies they always leave you with questions. The content is as much in what is not said or shown as in what is shown. The movie was about emotion and relationships - from that aspect the acting was supreme.  I have heard that some Japanese who have seen the movie have been offended about the aspects of the culture that were shown. I can appreciate that, but it was used for effect to highlight that they were in a culture alien to thier own - they were outside their own cultural safety zones with only each other for comfort and solice. Even the some of the Europeans they encountered were outside what they could relate to. So.. a top movie to be added to my list of Fav's

						   I have been searching for writings of Michael Pollan after reading  urlLink Playing God In the  Garden a number of years ago.  Although an old article it is still very relevant and I don't think much has changed since when it was written (Oct 1998).   I find his writings to be well researched and enlightening.  His perspectives are easy to relate to. He often phrases his statements as questions so although he makes his bias clear he leaves you room to make your own conclusions.  I recommend anyone with interests in agriculture or the environment to read this article as it is easy to read and entertaining.
