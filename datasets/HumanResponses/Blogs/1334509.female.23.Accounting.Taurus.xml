      03.24.03          Just this morning I was at work and fidgeting.  I worry about every day as though it’s my last I tend to over do everything.  I still look at the pictures from my trip Asheville like a tiger looking at national geographic from its cage.  I run my fingers over the photos wondering if this place was all just a dream.  Sanity is the word of the day I tend to spend the rest of this week taking back my sanity from those people who are intent on taking it. My whole life is one big count down if it’s not one thing it’s another every day the clock starts anew and there I am back at square one. I have never shared what I do in my free time with anyone I like for people to assume it gives me a glimpse of who they are on the inside.  Today the war finally hit me I finally face what I have been putting off for so long.  My best friend I mean come on every body has friends but there are very few that your willing to show your butt to and say hay dude is that a rash.   Anyway, she works on the water crew thingy so I know she’s out there like right in the middle of everything and I guess on the bus ride home I finally face the fact she might not come back. I mean we planned to do all this cool stuff together and now I just don’t know.

       CARPE DIEM‘  : (grab the chance, take the opportunity, make the most of it)     I read a quote that said, “Life is what you make of it”. I also read one that said, “Life is made up of the little unexpected things that you experience”. Someone along the way also mention that you can always remember the bad times even if it’s out numbered by the good. It’s true though I’d like to think that the reason you remember the bad times is because it’s so traumatic. To laugh or to fall in love is not traumatic however, breaking up or crying is.   With that said my birthday is Saturday I have decided not to say a word about it every year before this one I’d always get excited and all giddy. I’d run around and tell my parents what I wanted, get all my friends calendars clear so we could hang out and just get down right excited. This year I turn 22 so I’m past the sweet 16’s and the great 18 and the terrific 21. Those memories are what I like to call traumatic. I spent all those birthdays alone except for one lucky 21.I met a girl 2 months prior she was cute, talented, sweet and taken. She only hung out with me for an hour or so but she really made my night even though I spent the rest of it roaming around till 4 am. I am no longer so naive and have come to enjoy my birthday alone.   Randy Teag

      Well can’t say I didn’t give it the old college try. I started my job in the seventh circle of hell today and I quit today. I’d rather have bill collectors threaten my life than go there for 7 hours a day.  You ever have the feeling that god is giving you the finger. I think I will explore my life’s work an e-mail jockey. That’s where you sit at home all day checking e-mail. With my birthday coming up i start to do my life inventory it’s where I look back at what I have accomplished or in some cases accumulated. This process takes about 7 hours and ends with me on my bike at a coffee shop where I take along my friends jack (Daniels) and Jim (bean) such nice guys they are. They don't talk back, thier always around and you can throw them away when your done with them. :)   Three ways to know you’re insane:   #3  when you can justify murder. (And people agree with you)  #2  when you think of strangulation and profanity as a way to communicate.  #1 when foil hats become apart of your everyday clothing.  …. And here’s an extra way to know you’re insane: when the voices in your head leave.   Three things that suck  Unemployment public transportation Me

        Problems Problems Problems    Problem #1  My life is a mess while every thing is going the way I predicted it’s just too much. I got a crappy job today as a dishwasher and I’m already trying to worm my way out of it. I got the money I needed for school so I get to put things in order to attend school in Durham. The honest question is why is everything going this way. All my life I dug and searched for a reason to stay in New Orleans now I got every reason to move away. This really sucks     And #2  I feel like I’m walking around with a sign on my back that says free sex here. Every time I go out, I am reaffirmed that I’m some dykes plaything. It’s the story of my life good enough for sex but nothing else. It still amazes me that the women in this city can commit to a serial killer or a pathological liar but not me. One of my ex girlfriends use to say when she looked in my eyes she saw “forever” and it scared her. She also said I was far too young to be so settled. I don’t think of my self as settled. It’s just that I like to know where my home is even if it does travel a lot. (By the way, “she” was 37). Well I guess I’ll be alone a little bit longer than I suspected and that’s fine but can't a boi dream sometimes.

       some folks ask why i never talk about music here it is.    Making The Band    I  got a call saturday from an old friend I did shows with in Atlanta. She was looking for the name of band we roadied and opened for. Unfortunately, I could not remember the name but it made me think back to how I got started doing the band thing. I met a woman in the apartment building I was staying at when I lived in Atlanta. She saw me reading the paper and being a dork as usual. We stopped and talked come to find out she’s in a band so I begged to hang out with her. She let me and I started hanging out at practice and doing roadie things. To cut a long story short: me and the lead singer's roommate roadie, we learn a couple of things, me and another roadie decide to put on a show after opening band cancels, we are well received, we start a little act with a bass ,drums, a harmonica and an acoustic guitar. Okay four or five shows, a bar fight , far too many practices later. The drummer decided that alcohol and drugs do mix well and to do it before a show was a better time than any That night I got a chance to sweat more than I have ever sweated in my life sitting perfectly still. I was surprised the sticks didn’t fly out of my hand. Everybody kept nodding at me to go, so I took a deep breath and went nuts. Let’s just say by the end of the night you couldn’t knock the smile off my face with a bag of nickels. Now actually playing in the band, i got all my drinks free, got drunk, fell off a stool and dropped the bass drum. To shorten the story Even more the band wanted me to stay ,  it was the drummers drums, the band argued, they broke up, two months later, I was back In new Orleans. Ever since then, I knew I had to play.   Rock On  Angry Dyke

       Adult –fiction  or is it    The Story of Angry Dyke    This is the story of how angry dyke came to be…    R andy was a quiet child who would cry when anyone came near her and stayed to her self. She was a mama’s girl and did what she was told. When randy was about six she died in her sleep how long nobody knows. She flew over the city and over the clouds. She saw something in the distance before she could make out what it was she was pulled back into her body slamming to the earth with such force it left a bruise. The next morning she awoke realizing that what she had experience was not a dream and she had not returned to earth alone. Living under her bed was an angry spirit. The spirit was of evil intent full of hate and seeking revenge for all things wrong that had been done to it. Randy avoided it for the most part the older she got the harder it was to ignore. By the age of ten the spirit had a name Angry dyke, angry for the aggression factor and dyke because it seem to always take a liking to women as well as appear to randy in the form of a woman dressed as a man. Angry would sneak out at night and cause a complete riot. You see angry didn’t like anything that wasn’t animal or female and lived within the belief that extinction would come to anything that wasn’t. At 15, Randy became tired of anger’s ways one night she saw angry grabbed her and devoured her. Angry decided she could not live inside some one else so she fused herself within randy in hopes to gain some control. Randy of course was too smart for this; she absorbed angry dyke inside of her and slowly extinguished the hate. Every now and then, if you catch randy at a rare moment angry will manifest her self for all to see.  Randy Teag  ANGRY DYKE   In Some communities it is believed that queer folks actually have two souls.

         Well well well time for another edition of ……………………..                  A s the angry turns I feeling the bite of the Erotic writing bug again and I think it’s time to come out of retirement as anyone who knows me knows that I’m all about retirement.  I’v written erotica here and there mostly my freshman year of college. I was always told I had weird sexual taste but I’v found that it was just weird enough that everybody would read it and request more be done. So I’v been back in the artsy dyke game using the old imagination writing down my sexual wishes and taking pictures of nothing in particular. I’m actually getting excited I might be submitting my writing soon and some photos much later. I had this weird event happen to me I never know if someone is flirting with me or not but I think we were playing eye footsie but I’m not sure. You know’ it sucks being a dork.         I’m scared as hell about my BIG move I feel as thought my mind is in a blinder. I feel like a little kid at the edge of a giant pool I have on my floaters, my goggles, the little ear and nose thingies and I know I’m all alone in this and I have to be brave and just jump in. This by far is the scariest moment of my life because I have to make this decision now and quit stalling. I’v set a date by next year this time I should be on my way or living in north Carolina and damit I’v already made my mix cd’s. :(     Afraid     S o afraid I bite my lip in my sleep  O n the next day they bleed  S o afraid I can’t eat or think  O n other days so afraid things that I would normally do just does not get done  S o afraid I spend my nights inebriated and emotionally unstable  O n another note   S o afraid I don’t fear fear or myself, or anything just it  ( I don’t think of anything I write as poetry I just call them spots this spot also goes by the name “S.O.S” )   R andy  T eag

        LIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT          This is a update not to be confused with late breaking news, well the wonderful job I was so happy to get is wearing me out and as of today I am once again unemployed. The meds I was put on are helping cost wise but emotionally and physically, I’m a 48 year-old woman going through menopause. For my friends on the way there it is no ride through the park. Look on the bright side though you have to live your life up to that point and for you it will end for me I don't know. All I know is I’m looking for the nearest wheel chair and nursing home where's my SSI damit. Dame kids need to stay off my lawn (shaking my cane at them). Maria, my friend. My pal, who I would usually talk to everyday, has disappeared off the face of the earth, wait she did leave me a message that time way back when. It's cool though she has a new best bud. The only thing that bothers me is if I told her about my revolving door effect, hm well I guess she'll find out the hard way. For those who don't know I don't have a revolving door one way in one way out if you piss me off one time too many you find yourself on the outside not able to get in. Right now Maria’s door is shut but the only thing holding it close is that little door chain thingy and you know when somebody doesn't want you around when they won't even unhook the chain for you. I'm stating to think moving away won't be as hard as I thought everybody's preoccupied and anybody that would have normally held on to my leg for dear life is doing there own thing. (Tee hee hee).         Good News:   My guitar skills are getting better   Good News for Others:   You're still not me  ( ride your bikes today)   Signs that would benefit from the revolving door formula:   Cancer (sun, ascending), Leo (sun), most Virgos, Any Taurus with their moon in Cancer or Aries.    Today my favorite quote is:     Fire burns every time you touch it.    (ANGRY DYKE)     All too often, I set my life aside. All Too often my dreams went sailing by. A chance of freedom, a chance of fate, a chance I'll take.  I'll leave it all to disappear. I'm heading anywhere but here. Because I want a life, a souvenir. I'll find it anywhere but here.  (K.D. LANG)   ANGRY DYKE

        FOCUS PT.2       Hay looka me I woke up different this morning. I think a large part of me depended on my need to be needed. My problem now is I need me to be me and be as creative as I can be. (This is also today's tongue-tier) I once again have pulled out my  "Ax of Truth"  this is the weapon I use to free myself of things that I have relied on for far too long. First item on the block is the cathouse mailing list I have used this list as a nice chunk of my social life by the time you read this it's gone. Next on the chopping block is dyke march while I’m really kinda fond of it I do depend on it like a crutch social or otherwise. While I will for fill my promise of facilitating the meeting after next it might actually be my last. (Talking in a karate film type nature, you know when their lips move different from what they are actually saying) Ha! Ha! I feel my shoulders getting lighter, so much stronger yet feminine Ha! Ha! (And done). Hay that's how I feel give me break it's the estrogen. There is however, one very large crutch I was suppose to be rid of many years ago but I was always afraid to leave because every time I wanted to leave they needed me even more.  Anyhoo hasta lavista youth group after tomorrow 7 more Saturdays and I’m outa there. (Handing over the number 911 and a prescription for percadan to the next facilitator), You know that’s gonna be the hardest one 4 and 1/2 years in July it will be a solid 5 altogether I got 5 thank you's and 80 dollars. You know if you divide that by 4 years for every Saturday I worked I got 0.416 cent a day with a free condom bonus. Any hoo I’m free once again I have realized from all this experience that if you stand up to help people watch where you sit cause you might get fucked.     Good News:   My room is getting cleaner    Good News for Others:   If you need computer advice, a bass player, drummer or a drinking (smoking) buddy hit me up   Signs that would benefit most from having me around:  Taurus (anything), Leo (moon), Pisces (sun, ascending), Virgo (sun, rising), most Sagittarius, some cancers (that don't want to be alone). 2% of Leos (if Leo is not their sun sign because those people hate me)   Today my favorite quote is:     " And it's over now you've gone from being some one to no one"  (Kaia Wilson, The Butchies; it's over now)    XO's Angry Dyke

        FOCUS     I want everyone to just focus name ten things that mean the most to you, cross out five of them you can live with out. You can put three of them on an island where they would stay comfortably but you would not see them again for 20 years and you can keep the last two with you. Can I burst your bubble and tell you that no matter what order you put it in or what you keep or cross off you will never stop thinking about all the stuff you left behind. This my friend is called baggage. I'm actually baggage proof what happen yesterday stays in yesterday what happens tomorrow nobody knows. The ability to let things go and move on with your life is a natural ability.   Use it.    Signs that have no problem using this ability:  Taurus (sun, moon) cancer (sun, ascending), Leo (moon) most Scorpios, some Pisces, and 3% of Sagittarius   (If you don't know your moon, sun or ascending drop me a line and I’ll send you a link) angry_dyke@hotmail.com     Good News:     Taurus (sun) Leo (ascending)    Good News for others:   You get another blissful day of not being me.    Today my favorite quote is:     "Only you can live for you, Cause don't nobody else give a fuck"   (That guy that spray paints ohno everywhere I forgot his name)   BY ANGRY DYKE HA!

        DYKE DRAMA     You know I have always pride myself on the fact that I was drama free now people are bringing their drama to me, which really sucks ass of course. For the first time in my life, I have no idea of whats going on because I kinda stay to myself for the most part. I can't believe this though because it's gay boy drama. I kinda sorta can't wait because nobody has a leg to stand on and it gives me a chance push up my date of retirement (yippy Skippy). I honestly cannot hide how upset I am about this whole situation but that’s what I get for pushing the friendship circle a little out too far. I called my friend Maria to ask for direction to her planet exile cause my bags are packed and I’m ready to go.     Good News:     I once again have my health    Good News for Others:   You’re not me    Today my favorite quote is:     "Don't poke the bears unless you’re ready to be eaten alive"  (Angry Dyke)   "Fuck the masses and their Asses"  (L7).

        HEALING        Wow, I’m feeling a little better not so much like I’m going to pass out any more. I'm getting a little inner bitterness about this jamming thing ,here's the scope : my friend Sarah spent about a month trying to get me to play drums and I spent the month rejecting her. I was feeling a bit insecure about my skills four months later some one we will just call female bill came alone forcing us to play together now we can't all seem to be together at the same time so I’m feeling a p.o.'d. once again angry's kindness is being mistaken for patience the one thing I truly lack next to anger control.     Nevertheless, it's cool I’m dealing with it. That wonderful date I got all jazzed up about got cancelled ( running to my room sobbing) I’ll never date a musician again. I'm so over it. So now, I have to play this game where if she wants me she'll call because I’ve done my part damit.   What is up with everybody smile damit. :)      Good News:    Feeling better these days      Good news for others:    I will eventually make it to someone's stage (wink wink)      Today my favorite quote is:    "My own festering brain, After years of ignorance and denial,  had finally Erupted".

        CONSTANT CRAVINGS ? ? ?             As tired as I have been lately, I have found the energy to have a date.   :)  I'm so excited I haven't had a date in a long time.   I mostly get women kinda falling on top of me, not really taking the time to get to know me. Some how I have gathered strength for what ever this date might lead to.  At this point, I have the stamina of a 75 year-old man on a half a tab of Viagra. So taking it slow is the theme for the night. I like it slow anyway, finally i have no choice. I like her a lot, she is my total opposite and I love it.         Good News:  I got a date (yippy skippies)      Good news for others:   #1)   I have to quiet smoking due to a change in medication, so, ex-smokers rejoice in your newest recruit. as of Sunday i can not smoke at all, of course it said no cigarettes, so I’m open for everything else. (Wink wink).  #2)   No matter how the deck has been shuffled, you’re bound to pull an ace eventually.      Today my favorite quote is:     "Pussy is yummy"  (Val)   "I went down like a brick but I rose like a fireball".  (Angry Dyke)

        DAY 2 DAY     I would like it to be known that (And this might be the estrogen talking) with all the disagreements  All the "catfights" all the crap we put each other through.      Peeking both ways    I do love all my friends and would give my best toe if it meant making there lives a little bit easier. With that said lets move on.  (Sniff)      Good News:   I'm still alive      Good News for Others:  You got your health     You know when people say that you always give them an eye roll like what ever Until you lose it.  Because you see you'll find a job , you will find love and you will eventually (I hope) find yourself. When it comes to something you can't control and your future looks far too foggy to see the path ahead of you it can be a dangerous and lonely walk       Today my favorite quote is:  (2 today too must be your lucky week)  "Here's to having a cool drink of heaven to wash down your hell"  (angry dyke original)  "Help! I'v fallen and I can't get up"  (Me and a friend are still trying to figure out why this was funny)     X's O's   Angry Dyke

So far i have made myself feel a lot better knowing that "i'm so butch i actually have to take female hormones".

        WHAT    Imagine you had a magical 100-dollar bill that would just appear out of nowhere and bought you nothing but happiness,  however  it would disappear when you needed it most. Do you honestly believe it would be worth keeping around?  What if this dollar bill was a person would you be so quick to toss it to the side?    today my favorite quote is:   "with friends like you who needs enemy’s"   Today I spent the day starring at my phone book all I needed to hear was someone say your going to be okay. Because not even I believe that right now.    xoxox sick puppy

      :::: DAMAGE CONTROL ::::    I got my PhD in sociology from Harvard and my masters in psychology from Yale while doing my thesis on human behaviors in a anti-social environment. Okay I took one psychology class, which I got a D in but I seem to have a severe likeness to Dr, Phil. I should really charge for my services I can't help but think who should i send the bill to the people that seek out the help or the people who caused their need for it.  The things people say, oh the things people do, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. It's so simple to live by why can't anybody do it.

        ::::  POOF  ::::       Recently I've had to rearrange a bit of emotional space that sucks.  Tonight was a test to see if that space was filled properly. I can't help but fight the feeling to take two cups of sugar, my friend Mr. key and 6oz of paint remover on my outing but I didn’t. I've always been an advocate for not showing the inner pains out people are locked up in mental institutions for that. When you were a kid yea you would get mad when someone took your toy but you didn't grab it and shove it up their butt. (I hope) It’s supposed to mean your better then the person who hurt you if you don't get them back   I would like to think I haven't been in a relationship in about 3 years but I was It lasted a year with the lesbian bed death included it was full of fights, tears, laying in front of the TV and the occasional dining out.  Therefore, I shouldn’t be surprised that I feel like a scorn lover.     Crappers

      Q&A AS OPPOSE TO T&A    Here's an answer to some questions :)   Q: Why do you have two journals (someone on live journal asked last night)  A: Some times I post things just to vent but everybody needs there place to vent. Lately I have taken a vou not to drive all my friends crazy with a weird question everyday about what I should do with my life. A place mostly reserved for that one close friend who's seen your dirty underwear. (Which I lack right now) So I look to a large number of people some who I've seen naked to share thier opinions.(I don't always take the advice of the naked people)

        INSIDE GIRL     Well I've been pondering things while inside #1) I have reached my all time low of poorness. (If that is a word) While I'm not actually broke I don't have any money right now either. #2) Dix is right if wal-mart is lowering prices every day why isn't anything free. ( I was up a whole hour thinking about that) Anyhoo I haven't seen people in about 3 days so I'm still trying to figure out whats happening with me tonight  my chocies are    A)  Go diving   cost : free  (unless I get arrested)   B)  Go tagging  cost :  free  (unless I get arrested)  C)  Go hang out at 80's night  cost:  3 dollers (If I drink bottles water all night)  Sigh' the life of a loner so busy ,so wild.  So to stay within the theme here's a cute kitty. :)     I am a chubby little kitten blob    urlLink   Which cute or possibly strange kitten are you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Now if i can just get someone to rub my belly.

        MSN JERK         That’s right I'm the msn jerk on AOL Well at least until I get back on msn. Anyhoo I'm soo stoked I remembered the dyke march meeting it was great. I actually forgot all about it then I saw something about it online so I jumped on my bike and took off. After the meeting, I hung out with Deuce and Mags which was great because I don't get out of the house much these days or get a decent convo. We went to a Mexican restaurant which was kewl because I haven't had Mexican in god knows how long. Even though when I saw the plate of food, the first thought that popped in my mind was heart attack on a plate. It was super crazy good though and like a dork, I actually had a dream about it. (oh cheese enchilada I love you drool drool drool) I got weak my search for divers has left me empty and my friends all over the US post all their great finds on my live journal so you might catch me in a dumpster near you soon. My guitar skills are awesome I've been rocking out a lot lately and I've even knock the dust off my keyboard oh the life of the unemployed.  I've been on the look out for jamming buddies one of them now creeps me out a bit because of this constant need to put out an album.

        FUNG SHUEIEIEI-O      So today I started doing yoga let's just say I'm not as young as I use to be. That's right I have accepted my premature old age and I know I need to take better care of myself so no more 10 cheese burger Thursdays. No more "how many whoppers can you eat in a week" or the infamous smoking while riding my bike.  Oh yea I don't Smoke anymore Saturday of course is like the final exam of ex- smokers though; If I can make it through youth group with out a cigarette I’m cured.  I have finally mastered a song that I was teaching myself on guitar (Delilah -Kaia) I rock.  I admit I have been dumpster diving a bit just cruising around on my bike checking out some places no where good though not actually getting in the dumpsters just checking out the scene. Even though everybody thinks I'm sad, I’m not even though I don't know why I’m not sad. (Make sense). I have been extraordinarily bored lately though so Durham is looking so yummy to me right now.       Fun Fun (jazz hands)yea      You are not exactly original, but you sure do rock hard-core!

        WHOA WILLY        I can't seem to focus cause me so horny (dancing around the room). I was at Audubon Park yesterday and saw the sexiest biker cop girl ever. She looked so sexy riding her little police bike with her Hugh veiny muscle arms (oh my). Okay um anyhoo I got a chance to see Sarah’s new apartment yesterday it rocked. I can't wait for the party it's going to be stupid go crazy fun.  Maria hung out to yesterday she didn't have much to say but she was there. It was weird it was like being on some kinda weird first date only you expect it to go bad and it does. Anyhoo I'm trying to find other things to get into the band thing is just not happening in new Orleans so I’ve just stop looking, Being on live journal has boosted my need to dive (dumpster dive) I just can't find a buddy. So, I’m on the hunt for suspiciously clean and or well-dressed bums between 17-35.

        LIFE SUCKS                      This week has been trying Saturday was just the beginning on a whole world of sick even though I was medically stable enough to go to the pool party which rocked all the way even though I couldn't swim. To recap I’ve spent the last two days in bed rolling around wondering why god hates me so much. (Maybe it was that dollar I stole when I was in elementary school) If you have insurance or a lot-o-cash run to your doctor and give them a big hug and hope you never have to go to  urlLink Charity hospital .  Charity is where I spent most of Tuesday in pain in the waiting room to not get meds. My mom has been very supportive coaching me through the pain and getting me all my meds in the morning. I learned today that everybody in my family is an idiot savant. This morning I told my mom I needed to go to a hospital now my sister slinked out her room and knew the whole procedure for getting free medical care as well as Medicaid, food stamps, WIC and other government funded programs. (I felt a little proud) I feel really bad that I can't be where I need to be I feel almost useless.  It's weird I’ve been spending a lot of time alone and yet I can't seem to focus on anything. (Maybe I shouldn't spend that time with  urlLink Jack ) anyhoo time for bed here's some fun fun to think about..........     SUCCESS:  At age 4 success is . . . ..not peeing in your pants.  At age 12 success is . . . having friends.  At age 16 success is . . . having a drivers license.  At age 20 success is . . . having sex.  At age 35 success is . . . having money.  At age 50 success is . . . having money.  At age 60 success is . . . having sex.  At age 70 success is . . . having a drivers license.  At age 75 success is . . . having friends.(alive)  At age 80 success is . . . not peeing in your pants.

        CHEER UP LITTLE EMO KIDS            I think I’ve been inside too long when your space starts getting smaller and smaller like it’s closing in on you. It's time to party; Saturday is the wet and wild party I'm going to try to go (lack of moolah) and have a good time of course. I try not to be one of those prudish people who hold stupid grudges over b.s. I've been getting in the mix with Dix about my "problem" and I'm feeling a bit more confident about what I should do the only problem is the where and the when and the how. (Definantly not over alcohol, the more I drink the more I feel sorry for myself). I'm just hoping I can work something out it honestly feels like I’m going through a divorce. Only I hope we can stay together for the kids. I've been on the net all week and have started my search for employment. The only thing I have come up with is an offer to be a website editor for a nonprofit I wanna take the job but I need to have income to keep my internet service going so I can take it. Therefore, I’ve decided to e-mail a couple of computer companies and offer my self as a low wage intern. I hope that I’ll get some responses if I kiss enough butt. Anyhow, I got a serious hankering for a cheese sandwich :)   so here's the fun fun :)   Note: I'm not a star fucker and I make a terrible fan but i have had the luck of running in to miss Difranco a lot lately and even had time to have coffee over convo with her. ( so thats what this is all about)   Bitch and Animal    urlLink Croquet   Melissa from The Butchies is playing "DJ Wickett" in the song. She also does the drums for it.

        GETTING LIVE     I've been on live journal working it out lately and it rocks. I’ve been meeting a lot of kewl people who rock some of them live around me so it's really kewl because when I talk about some things they know exactly what I mean and that rocks. I've come to terms with the fact I am a sexual deviant with morals.  My main reason for going to Michigan is to get laid. Why do I want a big tent you ask because I want to fit more than one person in there at any given time. Why do I want to bring my mysterious black bag that’s almost as big as a small suitcase you ask? To hide my extensive collection of  "naughty gear" (whiskey, various toy's, disposable cameras and other unmentionables). When I was younger (18) I had a reputation of sorts and I got away from that. Now I' m all pro-monogamy so I’ve set aside my time at Michigan to do what I do best (historically speaking).  So really, my rules aren't written in stone just ink.    Now time for the fun fun.         Gay/Lesbian movie! You love fooling around with the same sex, so it's no surprise you'll be starring in a gay porn flick.

        ATTACK OF THE RECEDING FRIENDSHIP       You know through out my whole life I’ve only had like two close friends. Shonta was my best friend for 3 years until one day she woke up and decided that she wanted to join the navy. Now she resides in Italy, which is kewl. Cheryl was my buddy for 2 and a half years she was in the army and I haven't talk to her since like before the war. So I'm just feeling a little weird about the folks I choose to hang with however, against my better judgment I befriended Maria. I have learned my lesson and have decided to take my own advise fire does burn every time you touch it and it hurts just the same. There is a big part of me that’s upset at me for even trying to work out.      Well moving on, I am now hard up for companionship of the friendly nature. So, if you got a sympathetic ear or you need one hit me back.    Good News:   I got to hang out with myself last night and I got to know me. :)    Good News for Others:   If you have a close friend give them a hug for me. :) (Share a Popsicle damit)    Today my favorite quote is:   To many quotes to fit in one blog  I've always followed some of these quotes  Check it out   urlLink Friendship        X's O's   A ngry  D yke

        HAY HAY HAY    I'm chilling in the h.o.u.s.e hanging back. My doctor hinted toward stress being a factor in my illness so I’ve been taking it easy and loving it. Even though I’m not making any money, I’m still happy as hell being unemployed (clicking cyber glasses with Mags). So all the people causing all the B.S. in my life have just bought themselves a get out of jail free card. I'm usually not that flexible on anything, so forgiveness was never on the horizon. I'm a professional grudge holder if grudge holding was an Olympic sport I would hold the world record.  I'm thinking about joining the cathouse again just for the comical appeal, such silly girls. Anyhoo here's the fun fun !!!    Pin Head.. you come straight from hell with a thirst for blood! You weren't very popular but your deaths were always something to remember.

        ::: Problem Solved :::      After days of help from close friends and a lot of self-therapy, I had a mid-night pms-ing epiphany. I know the answer to the one thing that’s had me emotionally stumped for most of the summer. The answer is loyalty that’s all it was I didn't get it and I was upset. I will take a good part of the blame for my own sadness because I did give too much of myself. (which I tend to do sometimes) I gave things I didn't know I had the power to give and I was punished. I've learned  a person is not property to be pushed around changed hands at someone's whim for that I am truly sorry.  It's really fucked up to know the answer now because I can't help but to think of the what if's.  I can't help but to wonder had I just dealt with it like a person with some emotion it might have turned out better.  I also wonder maybe if it's the path we were meant to take only something this crazy could break the bond we had.  I think about now how stupid all this crap is was and ever will be. I'll chalk this one up as an act of god and move on.   That took far too long to figure out but for the first time in all my rants I actually feel better. It feels good to know.

      I think I'm getting high on being lazy man I get up everyday with no plan just doing what ever.  Playing and tuning my guitars waiting for the mailman like an old lady waiting on an S.S.I check. In an odd twist of fate I've gotten nothing but good news lately which freaks me out to no ends and of course like any other inside dweller I can't help but to think If I talk about it too much I might jinx myself. I've killed two spiders in a month; the second one was so small I don't know why I'm so paranoid. It's taking everything brave inside me not to take a can of raid to Michigan. (I've also locked up the pepper spray) I will however have a spider-bashing rod of sorts.

       ::: A VISIT TO CANCERVILLE :::    My horoscope was right  today (I spazed out for 48 hours)  This kind of strange day doesn't come around very often, dear Taurus. You no longer seem to know what you want. Do you want to work or take time off? Do you want to redecorate your house or live in a shack by the beach? It's hard to communicate with people, because you feel that trying to explain your point of view is pointless, especially when you don't know what it is yourself. The best thing to do may be to unplug yourself from your usual activities and go for a walk. This confusion shall pass, dear Taurus.   Every time I do something mean I suffer just a little I got a rude awakening this morning. Some femme that I dated when I was like 18 called me up wanting to come over to my house at 9am in the morning. She spent 30min on the phone talking about makeup (god help me) and her 120 pound weight gain.  Lucky for me I had some where to go like I would not have lied anyway. It was so early all I could do was mumble.   Anyhoo (putting on puppy eyes) I'm so sorry I'm such a snotty blogger brat. I'll never blog in negativity again. I'm so sorry just make it go away(pout)   "She won't let me"   (Angry Dyke)  for some strange reason it's the only thing I could think of    A  ngry

      I don't know whats going on or whats being said but I had another musician call me up this morning seeking help I really don't know what to think. I really don't think I have what it takes to groom someone into a star.  when I really thought about it there really is no real person or agent that stands out as a go to perosn to get gigs. Since I have no job and I was offered a precentage of sorts I'm really considering maybe being the middle man in all this. I feel like a puff daddy of sorts maybe a morris day oohh la la    It's something to consider anyway

       ::: A NIGHT AT THE OPERA  :::      I went to star 80's night it was okay for the most part I had to venture into a bad place for about 10 minutes but I was okay.  Maria who for the most part I kinda thought I was rid of (wishful thinking) showed up.  When she touched me I felt violated a little okay a lot I think I just was not in a place of acceptance yet and she crossed some we are not that close boundaries.  She entered personal space without permission (when leaving randyville all privileges are revoked).  Everybody wants us to work it out but it's hard because we would be starting not from zero but like negative ten. I already know there's no trust and I can’t depend on the support to be there when I need it. (Just incase you don't know, those things are important when building any relationship whatsoever).  Therefore, the Randy- Maria reunion has been cancelled until further notice.  (Sorry Sarah)   My days and nights are always full of weirdness how I manage is beyond me. When can I stop waking up in the morning with a game plan? (Crap)   Angry Dyke

      :::   Questions  Questions :::       A good question came across my journal plate someone asked about the elusive lesbian orgasm. She said she felt bad about faking it. I felt compelled to share my sexual history of faking it. I've never had an orgasm with anyone and I was always prone to the lesbian bed death before the relationship even started. Ever since my last sexual fling, I've been an advocate for love now sex later, which I've only decided recently to waive for michfest. A woman cannot live on bread alone damit.

        ::: WOW :::      What a weird and depressing summer this has been for a lot of people. I think me and my friends should get together and toast to one crappy ass summer. I think the whole gang is looking foward to michigan. I haven't had a summer this bad since um you know I've never had a summer this bad.  I spent nearly half the summer rolling around in my bed sick. (crappers) Oh well what can you do it's all destine to be  I know i'm not the only one who wishes god could just kinda pull you in an ally and give you a note telling you what to do next.  I have this odd odd feeling that there's something I'm suppose to be seeing but I'm not.  It feels like I'm staring at a big blurry puzzle and all the peices are there and there is just this one peice that I can't figure out where it fits in.       A  ngry

Life is totally boring over here and a lot of people have been trying to get me out of the house. I don't know if I really want to go "out" I've been squeezing in jam sessions here and there that’s about it.  I need to find a way to make some quick funds. (Showing a little thigh) any ideas???

       SCENT      I had gotten a cd from a friend at the delta dart show. I was riding away when she called me back because I almost forgot it she dropped it in my bag and I was off.  The next day I went into my bag because I wanted to listen to the cd when I pulled it out of it's case out with it came and oder.  It was perfume I had never smelled anything like it before it reminded me of an older woman definantly not a girl. I played the cd and thought nothing of it a week pass the cd got put away with all the others in rotation.  I was going to bed one night laying in total darkness except for the light from my computer and the buzzing from the central air when I layed my head on the pillow there it was just as loud as if I held that cd case under my nose.  The scent, I pulled my head from up from the pillow and looked around the room, I sniffed the pillow my bed my teddy bear and nothing.  I knew exactly where the cd and the case was but ever time I layed my head down there it was I sat for about 15 minutes trying to figure it all out. I layed down again and it was gone.

      YIPES!!!!!    It's getting closer to michfest time I'm getting a little nervous as i pick and choose what to pack mentally.  I don't really know what to expect I've been on retreats to the middle of nowhere before but it wasn't so far i could not take a greyhound bus back home. I have never known a lot of people at a retreat either so I always kept to myself. I've never been one to experince anything I just kinda survive it. I'm trying to put myself in vacation mode not thinking about home not thinking about work or money just being.  Its a weird thing.

        A NIGHT OF GAY METAIRIE FUN THE MOVIE      It was a dark and rainy night I had been riding around for an hour looking for a bar which I found just short of an hour pass 9 I walked in took a swig of JD and put down a pbr.  I finally got Sarah and Dana to tell the delta dart story. The odd thing is, I think the both of them would have never told anybody had I not dug it out of them. Another case of dyke drama solved by live journal.  urlLink Last words of Delta Dart.   Anyhoo the party train left the tiny bar, we packed into a van and took off to the other side of the tracks. Our first stop was a little bar full of everything lesbian but any one under 35 and any minorities what so ever so of course my friends had to be my human shields. Val rung in her birthday at midnight with a lot-o- hugs and a little groping with that done we were off to our next destination Rainbows. (Okay side note I'm 22 just in case you might get confused) I walked in human shields in place I can only describe it as hmm Imagine the gap exploding with loud rap music playing in the back ground.  It wasn't my cup of tea or coffee I tried to find my happy place (you know when your uncomfortable you try to find something good to latch on to i.e. happy place) I Imagine myself sitting on a big comfy couch with the central air on 65 my comforter on my lap a big furry cat on top while putting together a puzzle high. oh what fun that would be if I could get high in my house or had a cat.  I felt like a professor doing a study on lesbians it was interesting for the most part I took mental notes and mostly stayed to myself usually not too far from a friend. I’m not ageing from the inside out I’m a Taurus and just as a main rule I’m a homebody by nature with the possibility of being a cheerful alcoholic at least that’s what most horoscopes say.  All in all we did it for Val I’m hoping she had a drunken good time. I’m one of those twisted people that like to see my friends happy as long as I don’t have to get naked.     Good News:  Porn party next weekend     Good News For Others:  Hello I said PORN    Today My Favorite Quote Is:    "O Canada! Our home and native land! True patriot love in all thy sons command. With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and free! From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee. God keep our land glorious and free! O Canada, we stand on guard for thee. O Canada, we stand on guard for thee."   Where women get wed and pot is not a crime.   A ngry  D yke  Eh?

        ::: CONFRONTATION :::      I did not sleep well last night I woke up at about 3:30 to confront my sadness over Murry yea he wasn’t my dog and I didn’t really know him that long maybe a year and a half tops.  I use to house sit for months at a time with him. I just never thought about it I guess. The weather today has coincided with my feelings somewhat with a little sunshine of revelation this morning and a very somber evening drizzle to cool things off. I woke up this morning did a little yoga and said my goodbyes by afternoon I could talk about him and not get a big lump in my throat.  I think it hurts so bad cause I’ve lost so much lately and the loyalty he had I know I could never find it in any human on earth.    Anyhoo will somebody buy a fucking lotto ticket.

       ::: BIKE :::    I was bored so I jumped on my bike for an evening ride. I stopped over at Ethan’s house to visit (BTW Ethan is only 3) he wasn’t home but one of his mom’s was and we talked for a bit. I found out that my favorite doggy in the whole world Murry died a couple of months ago. I couldn’t help but to remember the good times of sharing peanut butter on the couch, watching cable while I was house sitting with him and playing in the yard. He had cancer and he died in the house with no pain. It’s still hard to believe he’s gone I’m getting all my stuff together to paint something for him I just need a cool place to put it.  (Sending all the empathy in the world to Dix)  [crap something got in my eye again damn PMS] Anyhoo after I left there I went over to floras to check out cute bearded girl.  I’ve only inquired to Maria about her way back when and she said she mostly dates the more feminine kind doesn’t hurt to look though.      Today My Favorite Quote Is:    “I’ve got a bike you can ride it if you like It’s got a basket a bell that rings And things to make it look good I’d give it to you if I could But I borrowed it you’re the Kind of girl that fit’s in with my world I’d give you everything anything If you want it”   ( Pink Floyd –bike)    A  ngry   D  yke

        ::: THE DYKES WAY :::     Checking out the michigan site hanging out in the forum. I had a though my patch comes off this week I sometimes forget I'm the only person who knows.  I sometimes use my sick folks slang around able body folks and i forget they don't know. I feel very weird explaining to folks that between this date and that date I might be unavailable. I'ts even a little bit tougher when you don't know whats wrong and there's nothing anybody can do to help. I just kinda have to expect them to under stand. Even from my point of view that sucks. Well anyhoo the patch comes off I don't know what to expect I pray to have some normal woman cramps. I had those sometimes way back when, I don't see why some women complain so much atleast they could walk. The next couple of days are scary I really don't know what to expect I'm hoping for the best though.  Think I'll call it a night I seem to have something in my eye.    R  andy

       ::: WOOT :::    Well I told them dec.27th is my last saturday at the center. I would like to say some took it well if well means not saying anything at all. A lot just rejected it as far as they are  concerned I live at the center and with out me it's just bricks. I marked it on the calender so wether they come to terms with it or not it's going to happen. I'll still be there in spirit and as an all around emergency contact. I just need an activism break :/  Ssooo I was out in the masses tonight got felt up by a couple of guys and then I went to the Phoenix got in a little free gay male porn then I went home.   Randy's thought of the day:   (I must work to not look angry all the time even though it's a well known fact that I really don't care what other people think.

       ::: THE CENTER OR THE PLACE FORMALY KNOW AS THE GAY AND LESBIAN COMMUNITY CENTER :::     I've learned two things today I actually get tired of complaining about the center and I'm so ready to leave it. Today I'm breaking the news to the youth group that before this place actually hires another overly educated and under skilled white man I'm going to be leaving at the end of the year. I've put it off long enough I'm tired of working for this queer government, it's far worse than the actual government every couple of months they bring in a new one who does even less than the last one inventing more positions to do the work of the original person they hired. (Confusing? it should be it makes no sense) The center likes to throw away money it's thier favorite thing to do. For them to actually spend the money the way it was intended is like a crime it just can't be done.  This truly is a gay man's information center, I think to myself as I look the place over trying to find a room with fewer penises on the walls than the last one to hold the youth group meeting in. They don't care they can't possibly care because caring would mean doing the right thing which is totally beyond there reach.   The emperor has no clothes on and everybody knows it, now will someone please at least cover his penis.   I hate this fucking place do you know that before I could even hit enter on my fucking blogger.  Some kid called and needed to see me right away for a lock the center up and leave emergency and you people wonder why I’m so angry.   I’m sure everything will be fine but I don’t know if I will be okay with myself after I’m gone. I don’t want to be at my own retirement party.

Is it fair to the women who lug their stuff up there year after year chasing after that never-ending circle of love, lust and the occasional quickie?

       ::: Michigan part 2 :::    (Not exerts from the journal)    I don't want to paint this grim picture of my trip it wasn't all that bad I had some little adventures here and there that I never mentioned to friends well because they didn't really ask. I spent more time in the zone than I let on I found a very small butch on butch group which kept me busy in the wee hours of the night. I liked it very much it was one of those very few places I mentioned that I could go out to and say what ever because unlike a lot of folk they were not as sensitive to offensive language (if that’s what you want to call it).  Michigan is full of odd sorts they don't mind you smoking pot where ever you please but to smoke a cigarette was surly going to be the death of you. I think I felt so trapped because unlike a lot of people I was actually physically stuck on the land the farthest I could go is out the front gate and then what. Maybe if I had a car I would have not had this extreme case of cabin fever. The zone was so far away it was not an every night option so I had to pack enough stuff in my bag to make it to the next day because well you never know.  I had many nightmares of being lost in the woods or being over come by spiders both of which scare the shits out of me so I would wake up in the angriest of moods. I did find a lot of people to talk to about sexual behaviors with in the zone and one woman I sat with in the smoking tent joined me while I was psychoanalyzing everyone, then we talked politics for about a minute and then we talked about the mental state of lesbians in an environment without boundaries and the effect that it would have on people in long term relationships and or singles. I never find people at home who are willing to share their opinions on my long subject matters.  I think Michigan is one of those things you have to experience on your own and find out for yourself if that’s where you fit in. I personally felt like a navy seal in my constant state of readiness and only eating enough to stay alive but that’s just how I get when I’m in a different environment.

       ::: Michigan :::    (Exerts from my journal)  In Michigan I found a lot of things a couple of pens, a pocket knife, a lot of change but the thing I found out about myself is that I have the ability to detach myself from reality. In Mich. I put my brain on auto answer everything was either fine or okay.  My friends could barely tell the difference to them I looked so happy and comfortable. I hid from the world in my tent counting minutes, seconds and days until I would be free again. I sometimes wished that Sarah had come but I felt bad for wishing this fate upon anyone. "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder", I only wish every body could understand that. In my own mind the only quote that repeated itself was "misery loves company” I never understood what it meant I know now. When I got back I though everything would be fine but I was wrong all the smiles and good mornings and false happiness took its toll. I went to school to work something’s out anyone who got in my way got cut down to the size of a bean every other word I said would shame a sailor I had no patience and I lost control I was angry I wanted to vent. I just wanted to be depressed, sad, angry, lonely, tired and upset all the emotions I was denied at Michigan I found very few places on the "land” I could just vent or be sad or just talk to somebody. I tried my best to hide my feelings I'd like to think I did pretty well. Every time I think about it, I know I survived the Michigan womyns music festival and lived to tell the tale.  I feel as though I fought the good fight and won.   (My behavior at school was uncalled for and after much smoking apologizes were issued at the discretion of angry and nobody was hurt in the making of my schedule)  "Without negative there is no positive without night there is no day it's life's natural balence."

      *Well went to Michigan it was okay and now I'm back to my much too busy life. I spent most of my trip thinking about my special someone who I called almost everyday. What can I say I worry I know she worries and I missed her like crazy. We've always avoided anything close to a relationship opting for a little emotional freedom instead. Always avoiding the physical stuff as to not to get too involved with each other. I miss her soo much when we talked on the phone she sounded so excited I can't wait to see her. Michigan was interesting for the most part will add more later as memory permits.......

      ::: THAT CRAPPY FEELING I GET IN THE MORNING IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU:::   I had a dream of a rather disturbing nature I can't believe it, me the "don" has a crush.  I have never eyed something I could not have I've also never had such realistic non-sexual dreams. In my dream it's just everything as usual we walk we talk were just friends but I know she saw the longing in my eyes. She knows she shouldn't but I can hear the loneliness in her voice, even if it's just a need to try something new in her voice I'm willing.  I have never considered holding a secret or being a mistress to any woman (again) but for her I would. I already know why I want a taste so badly with brains like hers who needs a fucking book. I have never been one for vanity but I can only imagine the many ways I would serve her, I wonder in my mind,'Does daddy need a boi?'. I'm so on edge in my dreams it never goes farther than a kiss. Tonight I worked out a serious fetish with her she walked in the bar and asked me if I wanted to talk, I said "sure of course" we drove around while she talked about her relationship and I listened so closely when she started to cry a bit we went to her place. When we pulled up to her door she asked me about keeping secrets like any willing boi I would most definitely comply. We went in, I put my bag down, sat on the couch she scooted next to me we talked for a second just about some random thing, and then she kissed me. (I can't continue it just wouldn't  be right and so unfair to me) Anyhoo It's just a dream.   Not So Favorite Quote of the Day:    Mr. Burns: Smithers you know that dream when they fly through the window. Smithers: yes Mr. burns Mr. burns: I 'm in love smithers  (The Simpson’s, Episode called "The wedding")  (I've always wondered why Smithers didn't find another "daddy" type person but I guess you know when you've hit perfection.)

Wanting something you can't have "   (Rupaul - But I'm a cheerleader)     R  andy   (who's not into S&M and by daddy in no way means I'm looking for someone draped in leather with hitting devices)

(damn these sleepy eyes and 80-year-old woman feet) ZZZZzzz......  Hay I tried to go out with Ms. thang but I think maybe she has too much baggage for me but how in the hell can I say that, without my cellphone nobody can find me ever but damit I am calling her cellphone you non-cellphone answering freak. :( blah    damn femmes  Randy  SHA.SHO.

      ::: UPLOAD,DOWNLOAD :::   I cancelled the date with miss thang I had to work but I was going to do it any way. I don't know it's like having a puppy that expects you to have sex with it at the end of the day. She's a very sweet and sexy and smart woman but she's not my "kind" . I don't know I just feel like I'm not getting her. I mean when I date butches you can't see there bodies to make a judgment based on looks which I am incapable of doing. I just get this hay look at my body kinda vibe from her when I really don't care about her body. I feel as though the conversation always changes to sex and here we are back at observing her body.  I like her friends a lot :) I wish they were girls:(  they are so cool :).    ahh well   I'll set up another date, I just need pay attention to make sure I'm not doing anything out of pity. (again)  Do all femme like to show off there bodies is this the norm ??? (I don't know what to think of it)  A---3--8--9--13--9 Randy

(Jeopardy theme song playing in my head) I guess I'll try to go into the quarter tomorrow and find a shucking job.   Announcements ::   Deuce burned her first CD (yippy Skippy) she rawks fawking hard, Super go crazy cyber hugs for Deuce oh we love her so much.  urlLink Mags's blog  is going to set the net on fire or at least paint it red which is kinda like fire but with a better affect.

I would like to think a lot of things are just coincidences but you never know. (I gotta stay on my toes because as any crazy person will tell you when your not on your toes is when they get ya) I'm not sure who "they" are but I sure as hell don't want "them" to get me.   I feel like, I'm feeling , I'm blah   I have to go out with my friend shonta tonight ,we are going to the vibe (help me)  I think someone is upset at me, I'm not sure so I should just get over it.  It took everything inside me not to cut my hours back at the center to every other weekend or send a letter of mass destruction to the boy's. (I have to do eventually I'm turning into a man hater again hours of self therapy down the drain)    With the boy's she had the nerve to give the girls what they deserve ggooo   Randy

I went out to kims at 12 mid-night said my hello's and good bye's got a peak at the hot tottie before dix and val left (hubba hubba) Oh how I hate when she stretches and show off her boxers (drool drool drool). Yea and I had about 2 hours of the "why don't you have a girlfriend" torture and then I was accused of being picky. I've been dating, I'm trying, I'm just really gay. : / Okay   I had a thought, on my first date with ms. thang she did try on my ring. I have rather large hands that can be a bit scary when you think about it.  hm  Oh well, my hands are mine and scary to some.  Is it me or is everybody transitioning into something.  Maybe I should change my name :) I wanna be a vegetable call me ham    (tee hee)   I'm obviously very tired and out of it    The very odd and creepy   Randy

Thank you to all who participated in the polls  The stock markets in randy world are down due to not enough hours at work and it's pissing randy off.  To make up for the down fall Randy is seeking new employment behind a desk.  In health, the center as well as a bunch of other things are still a pain in Randy's ass with no cure is sight the pain will continue  On the love front Ms. Thang is playing phone tag randy is not good at that game and has opted to play dead man.(Dead man- The person not able to make a phone call because well a dead man can't make calls)  (using binoculars to check out the hot tottie from a far "  I'd like to see those boxers on my floor ")    The very obscure and horny   Randy

       ::: A QUESTION OF ETHICS :::     I have a problem okay um I work at a community center with a friend. My problem is a lot of changes have been made so the staff is completely um male and recently they hired my friend who is male to be the youth coordinator currently my job only they pay him for it and I never got paid at all I barely got a thank you. All my male friend has done so far is make them fill out a survey with misleading questions and try to make them eat expired snacks. (This to me is just shitty because if I won’t eat it I won’t let them eat it) This is one of the reasons I'm leaving as well as an overall lack of communication between me and well the men. I love the kids but I get so pissed off when I think that I can't get the things they need and they are paying someone else to not get the things they need.  I really want to leave but I feel bad about deserting my friend but hell he gets paid for it I think he should earn it might make him feel better about it.  Well I'm probably just going to meet with "The group" and see if there is anything, I can seriously do for them to make the transition better for them. The center is staring to become a distraction in my daily life, which is not good.   Side story: I left the center and the group in the hands of the new coordinator one of the kids got hurt and a glass got broken. (My stomach feels like shit I can't help but to feel at fault 4 years and besides the occasional emotional trip, nobody has ever been hurt.)   I feel like crap,       Should Randy leave the boy's club or tough it out?

Damit, I think though I could hold out and meet a nice girl but who's to say that um lets call her Angela might be the best I can do "sigh". Cody says I don't need another ornament  because when I talk about her I never mention anything sexual and or pertaining to sexuality. I think maybe I don't see her as a sexual being as much as a friend. I need help yea that's right  you  get to pick out what I am going to do next. ( A kind of what would you do type of game) :)         Randys having girl trouble help her out :( by sharing your thoughts.        Tell her now how I really feel.

Her girlfriend was so excited she asked her  " Should I pack for the mountains or the islands”? Her girlfriend said, "I don't give a shit just get the fuck out"  I got another one  Three gay man were in a bar talking about ways to honor their dead lovers the first man said I want to sprinkle his ashes all over the forest so when I go hiking he can always be with me. The second man said he wanted to sprinkle his husbands ashes into the sea so when he went surfing his lover would be with him. The third man said I'm going to put my lover in a bowl of chili so he can tear my asshole up one last time.  I got another one (From Michigan)  A little girl was walking in the hall in the middle of the night when she heard noises coming from her mothers room. When she peeked in the door her mother was standing in front of the mirror naked rubbing her body saying my body needs a woman, my body needs a woman again and again. The little girl shrugged her shoulders and went to bed. The next night the little girl passed her mothers room again and she was doing the same thing standing in the mirror rubbing her body. The little girl shrugged her shoulders and moved on. The next night the little girl peaked in her mothers room and she was in bed with a woman. The little girl ran to her room snatched off all her clothes and stood in front the mirror rubbing her self saying my body need a train set my body needs a train set.

       ::: FIGHT :::    I had a dream last night I was in some obscure place in the world like a library or sanctuary of some sort. I was talking to some people I didn’t quite know. I was feeling a little weird about this place. When someone knocked on the door, everyone signed for me to open it. When I did, I noticed it was dusk and a line had formed.  All kinds of different people were pile ling into the door they knew exactly where they were going I didn’t stop them. All of a sudden the crowed moved faster as though they were running away from something. The fear in their eye’s was too much I went outside. As people whizzed by me I dove into the darkness I could not see who or what I was fighting but I fought hard. From dusk, till dawn I fought when I was through I went inside a small man asked me “ why? Why do you fight?” I just looked at him before I could hear my own answer I woke up. (yea but I was also built like Vin desial in my dream too)  Crappers    This is worst than the time I dreamt my friends won the lottery and I woke up wanting to party. I was so excited all day and I couldn’t calm down for shit.    Xoxo  Randy

I haven't written in a good bit because well I don't know, I'm having trouble figuring me out. I sit and argue with Cody about my ability to be superficial.  I can be superficial too damit ooh look boobies. See I care about those things too. (I didn't say I was good at it)  I don't know, I want to get laid but I want more than sex, more than that woman who thought all she wanted was sex following me around wanting more. (Especially not that I can never seem to get it with the strings)I was hanging out at Justin's party trading some info with a fellow lezbo and some str8t boy's. The first guy of course can't get laid to save his life the lezbo prefers to have one night stands with str8t girls because lesbians are to clingy (Her words not mine)I mention how I can't get either and that I find str8t girls far more clingy than lesbians especially after they decide their gay now....  An odd silence hit's the group Jaws drop and the lezbo blinks twice and says "You turn them gay" The str8t boy looks at me and says "Wow you must be really good in bed"  I got that same feeling when I was 18 and found out all lesbians don't "do" what I "do" in bed.   The other girl became intrigued by me as I ran off inside to use the bathroom.  (I got over that quick though as I have learned to downgrade my "bedroom antics" to vanilla sex)  Oh I have a test to take best be on my way.  Oh and I like strawberry short cake :) ( just some random info)   You can't see it,it's electric boogie woogie   Randy

Why won't someone call me damit. I'm going to internally combust if I stay there. I would whore myself out on a corner before I would work 8 hour shifts at hollywood video, at least whore's get a break at some point in their day. No breaks and 8 hours on your feet all day and your still expected to be nice at the end of it all. That my dear is too much to ask of an angry dyke.

I'm sorry but you don't meet the criteria for the positions but thank you for applying and wanting to have casual sex with me)  Tee hee   I'm a tired a girl and an over worked dyke.    exhausted   Randy

       ::: WHY BECAUSE I SAID SO :::     No I'm not at the youth group fundraiser. Why are so many people surprised by that? Was it not a well-known fact I didn't like the center or it's new found staff. Well surprise I'd rather have a hot coffee enema than deal with that again.   Okay there's a point: Love, appreciates, misses the kids Disdain, loath, disgust (Now that’s a big word I don’t even know what it means but I know it’s something bad) The center   (Didn’t use the word hate because hate is such a strong word I don’t hate anything)  That should make things a little clearer. I have also plucked from my brain anything having to do with the center because honestly I don’t want to talk about it. My standard non-thinking answer to any question is I don’t know even though I probably do know the fact of the matter is I just don’t care. I’d like to pretend it never happened even though I know that’s not possible.   I’m liberated I don’t have to be nice to people I don’t like or conform to fit the centers image.(That’s right I blocked Christopher Daigle) So much drama, so many times, so much trust lost.    The world isn’t made to suit you it’s made to suit the idiots who control it and their friends.    Crazy geeky cool    Randy

       ::: THOUGHTS:::   The Simpson’s last night gave me some stirring thoughts into my very strange and sorted love life. I actually met a woman I thought I was star struck by so I did exactly what one is suppose to do. I thought maybe I was a star Fucker, a slut if you will. So I actually did talk to her on the internet and in person I just new she was going to be an uneducated clod well I had hoped anyway. Because now I come off as this total groupie when it's not even really like that I just have this serious crush on her.  I put my guitar strap on same is her but why in hell can't I bring my self to talk to her. (In a romantic way) All we ever talk about is music, moving and the occasional book of the month.

       ::: FRIENDS FROM A FAR :::    Well I got a call from one of my Atlanta buddies. Her str8t girlfriend left her for a man. Of course I had already talk to two other people about her situation and I wanted to stay out of it totally. Because before they even called they knew what I was going to say. Play with fire you will get burned, poke the bears you will get eaten all of which is fun at first but you will get hurt. Even though I would have normally let her go. I comforted her and told her "hay to date a str8t girl took some balls. I would never do it because I know better but you can't control who you fall in love with or who lies to you blobity blobity blobity comfort comfort comfort". Anywhoo I made her feel better, I hope anyway.   It's tuff  though to hear about my friends being sad I mean honestly we can put the fire out and we can beat down the bear to get it off you but I can't make your heart stop hurting.    Damit don't play with the str8t girls. (ooohh jt when will you learn)  It's not hard to set standards know what you want, know what you can stand and don't take any less than what you know you deserve. I'm single, I'm horny,I'm playing checkers with a teddy bear but I'm not sad. (your turn walimeter, damn bear always beats me)  anywhoo I made my calling rounds to my lady friends. All I did was leave a bunch of messages but in the phone tag game I'm one up on them. ha  Well before I could finish blogging for the night my love at first sight companion called me back and we are getting together tomorrow night to "hang out" I guess I'm going to tell her about the dream. I don't know I guess it might lead to something more. I want to but I shouldn't because I know she has a girlfriend and I wouldn't feel right about it. I know I say that now but in a half drunk in the bathroom situation I'll probably forget everything I just said. I really shouldn't though because she can't keep a  secret to save her life. When I first met her she told her girlfriend about the feeling she had for me and her girlfriend could not stand me and would ignore my very presence.  (what to do)   To rock around the clock all night it's tricky tricky tricky   Randy

       ::: NEEDFUL THINGS :::    This is some of my e-mail today I got from some woman in dc. not really my type though:  30 something but under 35, 5'11", 155 of pure muscle (I work out quite a bit not as much as I used to but still good - all natural but very defined), Washington DC metropolitian area - moved here to do the grad school thing and never left; interesting fact: other than being butch and only wanting hardcore butch even though femmes are attracted to me like flies on shit, I guess I would have to say my other obsession is cars - love them!  I drive a black on black Z06 Corvette, 405 horsepower, 6 spped, max over 200 mph.  I also work a lot but not hard, smart!    Question:   Why does this person have to be an asshole. Now if I can just find the exact same thing minus someone with out the tude.    I asked why she was single.   Several reasons - because I'm picky as shit and I know that; I don't like recycled bois meaning it is cool to have been with a few but loads is not cool and that is how dykes are these days - from one girl to the next; this may not be politically correct but........ I don't like fat dykes - I work hard to be in shape and respect my body and I expect the same from a lover; I want another dyke with a life and not trying to ride mine; i.e., most dykes work construction, retail or some minimum wage job.  As for what I do for a living, I'm a director for a law enforcement division of government in suburban DC.  How and the hell can some one be so superficial. In this case she wouldn't be in love with the person but rather with what the persons has.  It's weird though because I have always wanted to have a slacker/worker relationship with someone. You know a house wife kinda thing that's probably why I'm drawn to band girls yes baby that's right I'll feed you forever. I of course would not mind being the slacker under the shadow of my overworked lover I'd write songs just for her and dedicate entire albums to her. Yea baby I rock out for you. I'm not that picky and I don't ask for a lot I really don't care what you have or what you don't have long as you care about something.   Oh my I wonder how long a relationship with someone twice my age will last. We'll proabably just have a little "fun" together and call it a life.   yea this is putting 'me' out there, well congrats you got to read some of my email.

So that went well the feast of love also went well.  I got to spend some alone time with miss thang. See I just can't get on her level of giving a damn about what people think.   (sigh)   I have to find her a temporary place in the world of randy.  I hate my job sooo much I need another job.  :( I spent most of the day at work cursing my fate and the other half high watching the matrix trying to figure out what the hell am I going to do.  Omg I got a test Tuesday and Tomorrow is the resume parade I'll be riding my bike around the CBD throwing around resumes and calling in favors.  My feet hurt so bad where are my fuzzy slippers. I don't wanna study it's hard and it's work. (nnoooooo)   Hay baby I'm   Randy   the magician come over here and I'll make an orgasm appear.

I don't get off till 3 so I'm taking my bike so I can ride to the center and be there about 3:15 for the party damit.  I have to be somebody's date for the feast of love Saturday night that’s fine. I just have to leave the center early to shower and shave and I should be fine. I know I'm overreacting but that’s just me.  I have had way more hectic days than that so I know I will survive and by night fall I will be a picture of perfection I think.

(Sigh) –48 hours and counting.  Well it was quite a ride and I did help a lot of kids. (Yeaa me) I provided shelter, food and most importantly love.   Sure, I could say the center was, or this could have been, or that would have, but alas that is the past and I, only interested in the future must move on.   Anyhoo that not being important anymore I have a test. I should really study instead of hanging out but damit working and going to school is tiresome and such a chore. (gggrrr) I hate my job and I think my boss likes me she keeps insisting on taking me home and I’m all like hello it’s 5 in the afternoon I think I can make it home by myself. I have work and school tomorrow. (Somebody save me) Saturday is so busy I don’t even want to think about it. Sunday is more work  (bleh) and Monday I get to ride my bike downtown and yell at people about my hospital bill and mail off a ridiculous amount of résumé’s while at the same time being on call at my job.

      ::: FREE FALLING :::   Well Saturday is my last day at the center. :) (yippy skippy)  I will no longer be working for the boys.  I have been getting offers from other non-profits but I really don't wanna do anything right now. One of the jobs actually pays something so I'm looking into that one but that's it. There's just so much going on I wanna keep my life simple the way it use to be. I didn't do a damn thing all day and my day off was actually my day off. I can have dates on Saturdays again(when I get one of course) and I can take road trips and sleep in and take classes and well not have to take crap anymore. Now they don't have to whisper or have secret meetings because there's no one around to try to figure out what they are doing anymore.   This Saturday is all about the party (that's right fools party at the center @4pm)  I'll blog more after I come home from drinking at kims.   sipping   Randy

       ::: LEAPING AND JUMPING TO HAPPINESS :::    That’s right I'm happy I got a couple epiphanies today and I'm getting things done. I remembered why I started dating, it was because I wanted to have an experience instead of taking the easy way out and claiming insanity. I didn't do it because I was looking for love or some perfect life partner that I know just does not exist. I did it so um I could have a little spark in my love life so I would not have to go to the movies alone or go out and have a fancy dinner by myself anymore. I’m turning into a complete computer nerd flirting online included. I did a little self-therapy and I realized that while my fantasies are normal and natural they do tend to reflect women so far out of my reach it’s almost ridiculous. I don’t think a girl of  “androgyny” is too much to ask for.   Pulling out the high powered telescope going on the prowl  (I feel like such a dork) I have to learn how to focus (Don’t look at the butches, Don’t look at the butches) move on you can do this women with boxers are sexy but little lacey undies are cute too :( (dry heave) and damit what is up with lace how can you call that reliable it’s a fabric with holes in it. (Deep breath there’s nothing wrong with matching undies), I figure if I can make it through an entire date and not frown up once I’ll be okay.    {I think I need more self therapy ( aggh the voices from my pants speak to me )}  Well anyhoo the bus was late picking me up but I don’t care because I doubled my road sign collection. (I have two now) I have an RTA sign, that’s right the bus stops here now fool. I haven’t had a chance to dumpster in a while but I’m going to get back into that soon.   The Saturday blogger will actually be coming back it won’t be a bitch session any more because I won’t have anything to bitch about in a little while.   :) yeeaaa me for putting myself in a place to be happy again.

       ::: THERE'S A TIME TO TALK AND A TIME FOR ACTION  (in movie guy voice)  :::    Okay lot-o-changes happening here in blogger land:   1. Saturday is no longer bitch day and will be changed to a day of calm. (Saturday is a day that will exsist just not in blogger land between the hours of 12-5 all the rest of the day will be reported as it happens)   2. More polls :) lets get interactive :) 3. More on the history of Randy  And with that said lets get started   Okay well today was a sucky day I got up to a strange white man in my house cleaning my vents. (great) Then I was suppose to go to city hall in apply for jobs but my mom hid my high school diploma from her self. (again) When I finally did make it to canal street to put something in my bank account I got a most wonderful show of three teenagers in a car cooking and shooting heroin at the bus stop. (What a wonderful day for a youth advocate)I went to the interview which was scheduled at the wrong time so I have to go back tomorrow at 10am.(yeeaaa)I needed to break a five to catch the bus so I went to walgreens and bought cigarettes all they had was 100s (if you don't know what that it is it's the same thing as a regular ciggy only very very long or maw maw ciggy's as I like to call them){I do not take that as a sign to quit smoking so don't even point that out}  Normally I would be so very very pissed I could hurt people but I actually feel I'm over due for a bad day so I'm taking it in stride but if tomorrow is anything like today.  I'm going to buy a bunch of cheese burgers and sleep all day. (ha take that world)  On another note I was riding the bus today thinking how much I miss the masturbating guy. He was just a guy on the bus that enjoyed masturbation which I thought was fine. He bought an odd kind of joy to my day after a hard day at work. There was nothing like watching some guy get happy. He never says hi or goodbye, never ask your name or even acknowledge your presence all he ever did was jerk off.

      ::: I'M GAY, I'M SERIOUS NO REALLY I AM :::   Sometimes I actually do forget and start to wonder what so many people are staring at. I forget how confusing I can be sometimes. My parents are going out of town soon and I will be out parting. (I worry about my parents when I stay out of the house too much) I think it's about time I had a "stay out all night date" (you know the ones I hate that make me feel all dirty). Yes I think It's about time to have a loveless sexual romp it's been about a year I think it's over due.   The question of the week is who?  If you have any recommendation please forward them to my e-mail.   I have successfully avoided one of my friends all weekend which means I don't have to go to the vibe (scary club). I went with her once and I feel as though I paid my dues damit that bar is scary.   I already live my life day to day feeling like an observer of the human species. Which is fine because I am infact the eyes in the wall and I'm truly comfortable with that. I know all, see all, and I have nothing to say about it. blah  I have an interview tomorrow with some person for something I hope it amounts to something.  I do miss having someone to talk to and someone to hang out with.  Having coffee just isn't the same.    Beans Beans The magical fruit the more you eat the more you   Randy

       ::: WHATEVER :::     Since it is in fact still saturday I should be bitching but I'm all out.   Not too far out there-    My mind has not completely turned to mush. I have been cranking out songs like crazy lately and if it keeps up I see a completely self-made album in my future. I've never done anything like that before so it should be interesting. I was suppose to be in so many bands in new orleans but nothing has ever worked out. I'm so focused on getting money right now I'm about to be knee deep in work. I will probably have two jobs by next week and end up tired as hell by the end of it all. :(    Wish list:  1. To meet some really nice north carolina folk 2. To find nice quiet place to live near my school  3. A van  4. A puppy 5. A kitten 6. To write music for these damn songs ggrrr      Randy   keeping my eye on the prize

       ::: DOES EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS :::    (Oh um it's time for my Saturday bitch)   Well I'm at the center all alone the "boy's" did something with the youth group and neglected to tell me again goody for them. I can't that’s all I can think of to say. I just can't.  I can't be taken advantage of anymore I'm not an inanimate object at the center for use anytime you want to.  I'm a person who has things to do and a Life out side of "the box".   I would put in some kind of notice but people on staff do things like that and since I was demoted with out knowledge I feel as though I'm not obligated to. (to my kids I owe them more that , to the center it owe's me and I should send them a bill)   By hiring a youth coordinator it doesn't help me it helps them. They never intended to help me even though we talked about it and I asked several times for the help because the group was getting so big. (Enough about what could have been done)   This has gotten so out of control I don't know anything any more. I'm just tired of not knowing. I hope all the boy's have fun with there new found power.   Oh and before I leave the center I wonder if the can the board vote in favor of me changing my title to executive director of youth affairs I know how much the boy's at the center enjoy title changes.   (It hurts)  I can't say everything that has happen doesn't hurt because it does. This place use to hold so much potential, so much love it was empowering to just be a volunteer here. I enjoyed doing it for free and I never expected anything in return but the natural support that this place use to give off. Now it's cold bitter bitch, here to drain me of my sanity. I feel like such the horrible mother giving up my children into the abyss just to save myself. That's honestly what it feels like. I wonder how many times I can tell them I'm sorry before the first tear falls.

       ::: WHY TITLE SOMETHING THIS RANDOM :::    Black – White Butch – Femme  {What do these words have in common? Same amount of letters, they all fit into a defined group of people, they are easy to spell (for some people).}     “To me they are the boxes on the application of life I skim pass looking for my box to check. Only there is none (scribble scribble scribble) There I made my box it doesn’t just say His-panic, black, white, catholic, or Baptist or the dreaded  other . Ha ha because it isn’t a box at all. I’ve bleached the paper white and given it purple polka dots with all the boxes filled in and you just go down and cross out things your not. Ha”                                           ------- A ngry  D yke 2002  Okay I was totally fine with myself and then someone commented on the way I choose a partner. They thought it was great how I knew what I wanted and was so sure of it blahbidity blah.  I really blew them off thinking they just needed some attention so I listened. A little while later it finally sank in a bit and it really bought me down. I did put myself out there to deviate from my standards and boundaries and all the other hoops I put up to protect myself.  I guess it made me think and that gave me a headache. (ouchy such a headache)  The results of a month of systematic scientific research:   Subject #1  The Tottie – has every thing I need on the inside and out and yet in repeated test has always come out to be a hetero-dyke (see def.1) I’ve had many many Totties (see def.2)   Subject #2  The Femme – The “Femme” usually has nothing I desire in particular but can sometimes be both smart and sane. Which is a stretch in that realm since I usually meet the one or the other or the drug addict, which we all know is not good.  I try to seek refuge in the fact that “femme” are plentiful and willing to go out with me on short notice. Months of study have reveled that no matter how much butch therapy I go through I still give femme’s butch makeovers in my head in order to fulfill my sick and twisted fantasies. (oh I’m such a creep). One person in particular when I look at her (and I’m so serious) I don’t really see her, I see her in her Halloween Costume. I see her in a little Cub Scout outfit with her painted on mustache and her short hair. (I don’t know if I’m objectifying her though can you objectify some one if your imagining them with more clothes on?)  Oh well I know I bug myself to death with this crap but flowers need shit on them sometimes to help them grow.  Oh okay um Ms. thang showed up to the dervish with someone new on her arm looking more than friends. I don’t know how to play this game I quit.     Packing up the old high power telescope, I’m through with the tottie. The view was better from my shell anyway (walking over to mags blog and getting cozy in my lazyboi ‘hay what I got to do to get a web cam on over there’)  Damit almost forgot  Def.01-Hetero-Dyke= just a different name for the butch-femme dynamic strict girls.  Def.02-Tottie= cute butch girls, hello   Melancholy Dyke tyke   Angry Dyke

       ::: WEIRD WEIRD STUFF :::    Am I the only person who likes to see old pictures of my friends?  I don't know what's wrong with me but I'm just tickled pink by it. It's not so much funny as really cute. They just show this moment of innocence we can never get back and some of them are funny as hell.   ::: ORDER OF OPERATION :::   So okay here's the plan, I like somebody now I'll never say anything because well I just don't. I'll look and long for them but I can't say anything or show interest. (peeking around) See that's the plan it never works but that's not the point. The point of the plan is so that I don't get hurt so it in fact works. You see,  Okay (peeking around) now okay normally during Dyke march I put the fire wall out and turn the security setting to low. Last year at the march I got a little snuckerd spent time with some nice ladies mostly helping Sarah puke but I got around all the same.   Many women + alcohol+darkness+the sale of kisses = well pure weirdness and sometimes puking   (Sitting in the window looking out my super high powered telescope peeking to mid city it's okay to long right just not to stare )   The longing not staring   Randy     Sigh

       ::: MY TUMMY HURTS :::    Well................     Well it's one of those days an amusement park kind of day. I'm up and down and all around. I had a fight with my mom this morning I'm not really sure what about anymore but I know I'll be riding my bike where I need to go until I get paid Thursday. I really don't know what to think about that but I am not one to argue so I left of course. I have one of those families that can argue one minute and pretend everything?¦s okay the next. I lost that ability a long time ago. I guess I am also not that negotiable right now I had to do my financial aid papers for next semester. I peaked at my parent?¦s casino winnings which totaled more than enough for a years worth of my education and the nice used car that they keep bothering me to buy. So yea I think I?¦ll put a down payment on a motorcycle next year, cars are far too expensive I think or maybe a nice little scooter.   Well my parents are going to my brothers again this year for thanksgiving. I know I can?¦t win with them I made plans a long time ago to spend it with my friends. Someone else quit from my job this week and some more hours were added on my schedule and well if they schedule me for thanksgiving I?¦ll quit this job too ha I think we remember last year. ( Some may not)   I have to fix my credit soon.( ƒ¼ that is really kewl)ƒ¼= :(  Next week friends and booze nothing corrects a bad week better than friends and booze. (And sometimes food)  I?¦m working full-time now even though I wish not to and have asked repeatedly not to be scheduled that way.  I?¦m still waiting for another job to come through because I want to get fired like I have never been fired before. As an adult (sometimes I can be) I?¦m entitled to a little fun.(I?¦ll keep you updated)  Every female boss I have ever had was in abusive relationship. Why is this always consistent? I shouldn?¦t have to fear for my life at work. ( I don?¦t but let?¦s assume I?¦m easily scared) I think she schedules my shifts so that I work with her all the time because well I am in fact kind of scary looking and never happy to be at work.   Angry + forced work- a break = one very angry person with aggression issues.   Unless her ex shows up at the store in which I have already decided I would just leave and then claim that I was traumatized in the work place and can no longer work do to mental defect.  I am a lazy bones today. :)   lots -o-luv   Randy

       ::: EBAY P.I.M.P :::     I'm on ebay trying to win something it's a pain.  you bastards grrrr I keep getting outbidded I'm so losing my edge. Must get angry. aaahhh   It's crazy though I realize if I stay on e-bay and keep renting movies I'm going to turn into a shut in. I only have contact in class to which I keep to myself and constantly look suspicious.   I'm having bad thoughts not for me ofcourse but for other people. I mean the idle hands are the devils playground right. It's too easy it's all too easy but I will say if you see me walking away from my school with a large bag Let's just assume I stole an entire drumset from the music department and stare in awe of how small a package I made it into. I don't know any better okay. My job, My boss he toys with me "I'll look at the surveillance tapes" he says "I'll catch the thieves no one can steal from hollywood video". I know what he's really saying with his lard filled stomach, he's just thinking you can't beat me. I haven't stole anything from my job or my school or anywhere. I think it's just too easy, these people they want to lose. I would actually feel better if I told them how I could steal rather than do it for personal gain. I don't really need anything else. I will not dispute the fact that I do want a drum set. I also realize that I will not pass out in the street tomorrow if I don't play drums.   I'm troubled. To steal or not to steal that is the question even though I already know the answer. Stealing is repetitive and compulsive behaviors that lead to no where. When your brain scrambles to justify it is when you have lost........... .............................................................. ..............................................................  Okay I see now, I need to get laid. :/   Well le'tigre was on carson daly last night I don't know why I was expecting more from them. I have never seen them before I guess I was miss lead by the price of the concert tickets.   Man I have been really into Stevie wonder lately  (Rock on)     WOW that was quite a trip...

(I don't know what to think of that)  I know I should be making music and working on music I already have but damit I work at a video store and I'm distracted.   Come on cut me some slack I've been looking at movies everyday since I got the job. I'm eventually going to stop renting for myself and start just doing it for random people.(mostly my mom)  I know I need to focus. :(  (quietly sobbing about my lack of interest in my own music or maybe not. I'm doing it on the inside I tell ye)  I got more time off from work because well I don't like it. Well I do like it because My boss is a complete push over and I'm the only one that knows how to fix things so they keep me around.   I do have a problem and yes I'm looking at ebay right now.  I've evened it out though I printed off some cords I've been looking for.  I have math class tonight :( x+2x+1 ha! okay that was easy but bah humbug  Favorite quote for the day: Me fail english thats unpossible.

I have submerged myself in guitars and I have fallen victim to my #1 addiction (peeking around)  Hello my name is randy and I'm an e-bayaholic.  I was looking for a new job but not so much now. I think I just wanna kinda sit back collect my little checks and toke a whole lot. If a good job falls in my lap I'll take it but right now I have too much to do to worry about that.

       ::: BLEH  :::      Well I had an emo kind of day I worked at my crappy job and then had to wait four hours after that for my check to come cause the damn airborne man was late (damn men) and then I cashed it and rode around on my bike looking for a party with a dirty shirt on. I wanted to fuck shit up tonight (do bad stuff) but I left all my markers and spray paint at home. (damn me) I have to do a train real soon. (tag a train not that other thing your thinking of)Instead I settled for almost getting arrested at burger kind for stealing ketchup. (thats a whole another story)  I need some more friends I get bored to easy. I need some people to get drunk with because getting drunk alone makes you an alcoholic or at most that weird person in the bar talking to the salt shakers.  With most folks being in relationships of the unsavory kind their either sucking face or arguing either way it goes I don't want to see it. It's hard to bond with this person I don't know sitting in between. Maybe I should date more (bleh) again it's not the same though.    Well I need to be upbeat for those who like that kind of stuff. :) :) :) :) :) :) What a lovely day it was la la la la la :) :) :) :)  One thing I will miss about new orleans is all night check cashing places and I think thats just awesome. :)  kitty cat tails and puppy dog kisses la la la la F%$*ing la :)     Hay   Angry   pass the peas like we use to do .

       ::: WELL THATS IT :::     Well I guess this is the end of a very odd year. Lets recap what I learned this year. People want me to feel, I don't feel. I'm not a fuzzy lady, I very rarely get fuzzy feelings and I lack the ability to communicate my fuzzy feelings. Maybe next year I'll have the ability to share a fuzzy feeling with friends. I did not know women could have morning wood why did it have to happen 48 hours into a porn free life. I'll just have to deal.  I know why I don't like rap music it's a nurture thing. I'll try and get over that next year.  I'm now surrounded by pandas and yet I'm the only one with a pink umbrella.  Wallimeter (teddy bear), velvety bear, and banana poking monkey said happy new year.   I have no idea what I should do next year if anyone has any ideas please pass them on. (i.e. hobbies, books I should read, places to travel, walls I could spray paint on, just cool things all around)   I've gone back to worrying about where cheryl(5'3" blond hair looks like a little boy) is. :(   My old friends have all but disappeared I have no one left from the original cast and crew. ick  I'm always open to advice so feel free to give.   It was a good year all and all I got to travel with friends and go to places I have never been before I love it so much. Even though I got really sick for like 2 and a half months I got better and I feel good I got back in school and my brother offered to help me with my money problems.  So I guess that's it for 2003.    Love and happiness  Peace and blessings   Randy (Angry dyke)

Anyhoo lets see I'm probably going to travel more next year. Don't know if I'll be at michigan yet but I'm going to be in durham early next year. I'm going to get a car in 2004 I know it and I'm forcing myself to do what it takes to get a car. (peeking at all the ladies on the other side of the computer screen "what ever it takes" {wink wink})I'm totally asexual now me and wallaimeter(teddy) and velvety bear are the only occupants of my bed. I've kinda forgotten what a relationship is all about anyway love is black Satanist Christian with bad hair only on hitlers birthday kinda thing to me. I don't know what it is anymore and I refuse to waste another brain cell forcing the definitions to exist. I need a stage amp and a cheap one.  okay I think I'm done for the day.

It's one thing to hear a persons story but when you have to hear it from the source it's totally different I don't know about anybody else but I'm a crier another reason I don't like lady movies. I still can't look at a league of her own with out yelling "just let them play ball damit".   Anywhoo   I'm still dealing with the fact the part of me that loves is closed for remodeling.  I just don't know I need outside input on the selection process how do you know. I know no one has the answer so bleh   Well I still have to make my schedule for school next semester I'm Really behind on my daily life stuff for some strange reason around the holidays it feels like time freezes for me.   :( :( :(  I miss my friends : (    (whats everybody doing say something)     when the sky had been falling and I heard your voice calling   Randy

I'm still thinking about bringing a date to dix's party but who could I possible bring that wouldn't expect sex at the end. ugh I don't know, I still haven't decided what I'm going to wear yet oohh too much I tell ya. I did pass by a sidewalk sale Saturday and picked up two new wigs gotta love that.   My life is all over the place, I do have some what breaking news I'm waiting to hear if I get some student aid this year. I made the grades now it's the waiting game to see how much it will be . Maybe enough left over the get a drum set maybe enough to put a down payment on a car we will see. How can everything be so all over the place and yet feel so right.   I'm practicing like everyday now trying to play catch up on the musical end. I have yet to call Sarah and get ada's number.

       I've lost it     Well wasn't going to blog for today or this morning but I just woke up from my recurring dream. I don't know why lenny kravits keeps showing up in my dream but in the dream he shows up when I'm usually in the middle of a crisis and then we get in his car I start to turn femminie some what. Then we start to talk about random crap and then (um see I do this thing with hand mostly to okay only to women when I want to you know.)I do the little hand thing and then we spend the rest of the dream looking for a place to have sex. I actually woke up mad this morning because we were right there at the motel and then my alarm went off. What does it all mean I haven't even seen a picture of lenny in like a year and I only do the hand thingy to girls I like I haven't done that in about 4 years. I don't know this is all too weird. In my dream he has a hugh penis but in my dreams I have a hugh penis. So I think it's a universal dream theme. Why can't I have a dream about {BOB} mmm sexy sexy {BOB}. Hibrenia bank e-mailed me about a job so I have to do a phone interview from work today. (I'm not really getting too excited about that because I never get what I want so I never worry about it.)  I like blogger people can search it from the internet but are more likely to end up at my live journal than my blogger.

There's nothing to do around here the lesbians are getting restless. Soon mass orgy's are going to break out. Night will be day , up will be down the whole world is going to go crazy. Okay maybe I'm over reacting just  a tad. I'm thinking maybe I'll try to hang out in mid-city Thursday after work than head over to Wit's inn. Yes I have made it to that point I need a beer and some pool and anything that looks like a woman.     that's right kids that's right you too could end up living in a van down by the river like  Randy

       :::  HAY HAY HAY :::     My new bike is okay not as good as my old one but I suppose I'll get use to it. I went into to quarter last night just as a last minute thing and I stopped at a garage sale and picked up two clocks that I thought were cool and then I went to put in an application at a store and the clerk put a happy face and two stars on my application. I really want this job it's a smaller store and it pays way more 2.00$ exactly more an hour than I make now. I have to call the manager today and check it out though so we will see. I'm thinking about asking someone out soon I always have somebody in mind but I'm never shore if they like me or if it's something more. I wish there was some way of sending an anonymous note over the internet so I could find out. This really sucks why do I have to ask girls out I don't look that intimidating I'm safe ask me out damit. I kinda like this girl though I like to hear about her job and school and stuff. I don't know this is all too much... aaaaaahhhhhhh  I think she's nice and great and all that I just don't know. I need a mic and a stand I'll probably be on e-bay untill the weee hours of the morning looking for a deal.  What should I doooo because I don't knoowoowowowww.....oooo..oooo.    Wake me up before you  Randy

       ::: WELL :::     Well my parents woke me up way to early this morning to get my bike. I went to k-mart to get the bike I wanted but it was not there I asked the clerk "where's the bike I called yesterday and they said it was here" He said " yea It was here yesterday" I could have gotten mad or cursed or been totally rude and cut him down to nothing but I new in my heart that I have done the same thing to the customers I serve and it was just my bad ora coming back to haunt me. All I could say was touche. (Damn you little ying yangy thingy) I'm back on the net baby, I'm back but I think msn is on to me so I'm behaving.   I went to the salvation army and got a cheep little bike which is getting fixed a michaels bike shop as we speak. I'm stuck with these little racing wheels which is fine. I haven't been dating at all but now that I have another bike that might change.    Man I'm hungry. I'm going by the youth group today and then I'm going hang out with mags. :)   Oh mickey your so fine your so fine you blow my mind   Randy

       ::: HELLO :::   My communication is limited this week because it is the week of finals and well I need to focus so I cut off my internet service this week only. It’s just a strange coincidence my aol got cancelled because well I didn’t pay the bill and I never do. This is the second time I have taken aol for a ride. I pay them though when I’m ready and they still give me free service same time every year. I am in fact the msn jerk. :)   Can’t wait to turn my msn back on though,  Friday night I’ll be on the web like crazy. oh yea  Well I guess I should type life stuff now......  Okay I’ve been talking to my ex-girlfriend Natasha we had a very weird arrangement  of me telling her how much I love her and her just wanting to smoke pot and sleep all day. Well she left me for a girl with a big butt who in turn made her miserable.:) I know she’s back for sex but I don’t know. I have been feeling rather butch lately I’m thinking I should but I really don’t want to be attached to anyone right now those girl get possessive with me especially when they think someone else is getting what they are not. I don’t know if she’s hunting for a relationship though I mean she’s a sweet girl and her hearts in the right place but damit she’s hugging 30 and if she hasn’t gotten her shit together by now it’s not going to happen. She just lacks drive or ambition she can tell you what she wants but she’s not doing a damn thing to get it. I don’t know my brain’s all over the place on this one considering horny hit’s me like a hot flash and  I lack the ability to stay focused. She’s an April Taurus that puts her high on the stubborn meter. I don’t know see because I get needy she gets needy and we both end up in that weird place of what she wants and what I want and the two never meeting.  Mind drifting off..........  I have been being really butch lately I’m so proud of me. :) I took and ax to a tree root that was growing under our house and I got really muddy.:)   Mumbling some stuff ....,,, >,,,....  I’m not going long crew so don’t even think about it. I don’t have to sit here and listen to these wild allegations.  I need to clean my room even though I have this elaborate set up of my guitars, drums and recording devices. I demand nothing less than perfection from myself. So I tend to play the same thing over and over again and then tape myself and listen for errors. It’s just the inner artists coming out of me.   My sight has been very blurry lately it’s either  1  .  I need to get some glasses or  2.  I need to smoke more pot......   I think I’ll get some glasses.  I think I have blogged enough to keep folks busy for a while. No wait saturday I’m going to get a new bike I decided to go new because I had a lot of problems with my old bike:(  and I think I deserve it damit . :)  Aaaanndddd I’m getting new shoes. :)  Aaannnnnddd  I had a dream about new Orleans in which I did find a good job and a good apartment in mid-city and I actually said the words Living in new Orleans isn’t so bad and then I woke up. At that point I knew it was a dream    Livin la vida   Randy

       ::: LITTLE WOBBLY BUT I'M DOING IT :::   See I'm doing it keeping them both up to date a bit. I might do and every other day thing you know livejournal one day blogger the other seems fair gotta put myself back to #1 in the google search I mean my more random stuff shows up the post I made on a butchies message board stuff like that. I know I suck   Well here I am nothing much going on here I'm just being me living my less than profitable existence. I saw the kid I'm suppose to be talking to pass through the computer lab just now. Every time I think about it I feel like a horrible parent of some sort.   I've been writing songs not many but some..  I got my period it spanned 3 days and lasted all together 20 minutes. I need some insurance I'm sure there's nothing healthy about a 20 minute period. I need to buy some meds I would ask my brother but I probably wouldn't get the money till next year some time.  I know it's stupid but there's a big part of me that just wants to shell out the 60 bucks for it instead of having to go through pain. I need to focus on a job with benefits. I think about finally girling it up every day.-- Wanted someone with 2+ years clerical experience that's computer literate must be professional--. I don't even try for the job because I know the whole thing is just a big cover up to put me in a dress. (Eck)  Yes I worry, I worry like a Virgo on payday and cancer standing alone at the altar. It's not frustrating it's life and all the worry is sitting in the hair on my knuckles. Can't change who I am so I  guess I have to get in where I fit it with benefits.   You other brothers can't deny when a girl walks up with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face you get   Randy

       ::: I'M SO SORRRYYY BLOOGGGGGERRRRR :::    I have neglected thee   I know I was suppose to be dividing but I never got around to it I suck.   MY job it sucks I hate it sooooooo much yes I'm looking for a new one and no I have not been successful. The closest I came was to setting up an interview at the YWCA with a woman who just can't seem to stay at her desk. I have been e-mailling Pitney Bowes back and forth for the last couple of days but I'm not trying to get to excited about that.  If your reading the live journal forget everything I ever said about the possibility of dating it doesn't exist for me I know it. I'm going to be one of those mommy lesbians. You know the ones with like 50 college degrees and 20 cats and possibly two dogs. She's the only person with clean urine, good credit and a fuel efficient /eco friendly car.   Yes that's my job, my lifes work: Queer mommy, mother Dyke, gay lady mom  Over seer of the entire lesbian population. Don't worry girls I'll save you.   I matured too fast I wanna be 13 again. I was so young and promiscuous I didn't care about love I just wanted a nice girl to (you know) with.  When did monogamy become the most important thing to me.  I think it's mostly because if I want sex it's there which defeats the goal of the pursuit. Love however is a different story I can't seem to get women to commit to me. aaaggggggggggghhhhhhh  Me don't like :(  I need to focus on some more stuff okay I started reading three different books. (That Michael Moore he's something else.)  I have 5 different family's on the Sims.( They finally went gay two of them anyway)  I ride my bike, I play all five of my instruments on a regularly set schedule.   I wonder what else I could fit in ?   That is all_______----...--..."""-""""....__..--...."""____"--""__""""".__.-.-..-....""""___""""""...........''''''''''''.....     you try and sway....but I'll be coming for you anyway.... take on me .....take me   Randy

       ::: EVERY THING AFTER JAN 12, 09:16:01 PM :::   For non-live journal folks     Anyhoo I will probably pick one of my journals to be more personal than the other. Go ahead and say it what can be anymore personal well there's more so deal with it. I of course will never post :  1. Body functions :( 2. Super duper secret crushes. You see there are people in this world that rock my world to the point of no return and it's for that reason I have never mention those people. My heart would melt six ways till Sunday for them and that basically makes me an easy lay. You can't let people know they have a hold on you without doing anything. SO there 3. Weird habits it can get scary. (not scary call the cops and commit her weird but just enough to make me not want  to share) 4. Other folks secrets it's there's ask them (unless it's life threatening than all bets off) 5. How much I weight :)  (too many people are surprised by it so I'm not telling) 6.Any personal tid bit's I've picked up along the way. (I am and will always be the vault stuff goes and nothing escapes) yea me :)  That is all   So I was on my way out the door to go hang out with mesha and be all sad and alone. Well the intern called and she wants to hang out thats lesbian for date oh no I'm so unprepared what to do.   Okay I'll survive I'll make it through. (OMG) what am I doing she's 18 and you wouldn't mistake her for older than that oh crappers I'm so sorry age system I was so stupid for over analyzing you please send me some 30-year-old with her life in disarray I can manage so much better.   aaaaaaggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh  Okay I'm calm..... :( but she's so girly (OMG) I'm going to need an EMT dyke to resuscitate me after this.  (falling out of chair)  Okay I have to go now I have to meet someone uh okay.    current mood:  creative     Thursday, January 15th, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   6:46 pm - SWeeettttttttttttt   Okay well lets see I have been worrying,reading and shopping on e-bay. I have been thinking about why gay boys so mean, these two gay guys that pass by the center act like they don't even know me when they come into my job. (icky boys I should give them late fees)   Okay felisha came into the store today. Um this is the thing some of my sweet sweet friends believe I need to date. So I said that I can't because every time I even remotely think I could like someone they end up dating one of my friends so I basically refuse to pursue or allow myself to be attracted to anyone in anyway. (tough? yes but it's even harder when people start to point out possible people I should date.) Okay back to today well she came into the store and I was wondering about lesbian flirting, what is it? Because I have no idea, she came to the store twice in a 2 hour period, was the flirting the chitchat at the counter or the walk to let her into the bathroom. This is all too much it's crazy I tell what.  My poor bass guitar looks so sad over there I should play with it.  Blog u l8ter .   current mood:  bouncy current music: Me playing my bass. raawwkkkk        Tuesday, January 13th, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   11:58 pm - Sooo   What a stressful day this has been. The oh so slow mailman bought to my house an empty tube. (where my pink floyd poster was suppose to be) It got lost in the mail but the fact that the mail man actually bought the empty tube to my house is the most stressing part.  I just had a flash, I have to go to work in the morning and I have no product for my hair. :(   I have to register for classes in the am and I'm still waiting to get the money from my brother thursday is the last day to pay.   what am I going to do I feel so stressed. :(  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh (running around live journal) aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggghhhhhh  Save me allah   aaaaaaaaggggggghhhhhhhhhhh  And scene.  xo randy

       ::: ME SO CRAZY :::    Well I have been a busy bee today I was out looking for a new job and other. I went to fax off resume's first thing this morning than I ran into val on the way to tulane. :) I went to the new tulane human resources office and I got overwhelmed by the new building, so confusing, so scary. I got on the broadway bus, I have never been on the broadway bus so it was very educational, scary but educational. I had a lot of time to think in between trips here and there nothing of interest just theories.  Deuce was right those young girls think they know everything. I'm getting old at what point did 18 become too young for me. well I don't think it's so much age as it is maturity. So many 30-year-olds have let me down. :(  Well I obviously have too much time on my hands if anybody needs a michigan application I have it in my puter.:) (peeking through screen shanga, emily, sarah helloooo) Speaking of which mine is the mail yeay me. :)   I need to confront because I'm avoiding, life and death is just not my thing right now. I feel bad though I'm putting off the inevitable.   O's ,X's and f's   Randy

       ::: THE RAGE :::     I don't know what to do for me the lines between good and evil are very defined. Things have gotten worst at the center it's all the things you can't see though. The worst possible scenarios defined, I would say I never thought a gay white male could cause so much confusion but then I would have had to be living in a cave for the last couple of years to not know it for sure. I know I have expressed dislike in the pass but I'm to the point where I would push jack into the grand canyon even on my best day. ("But I like jack") Good for you I already know ignorance is bliss can't school me on that. He is defiantly one person I regret ever crossing my path. I don't blame him directly for the current stuff happening but hello cause and effect. My hands feel so tied how lucky are the folks with rose colored glasses on. Some people believe in the end he will get what he deserves I guess only time will tell.  It's amazing though to see all the things you warned people about that have come to pass. Now you see I wasn't making it all up it's true everything I said. Now I just sit in a chair in the corner and nod as they go babbling on about everything and yet nothing at all. I mean it's already been said it now holds no value saying things repeatedly doesn't give them weight. I try to cushion their fall even though no one was around to cushion mine. (It's okay, I understand, he sucks, you rule, I know it's hard, It's tough, It hurts, you worry I know, It's okay, Just believe.)  Last post about it I promise.  xo' Randy

       ::: HAY YOU :::     Well today was suppose to be my get out of the house and play day but I went to floras and started to think about my bills. I got depressed and started towards molly's to hang out with mesha and drink myself into a opal hole and be depressed. I noticed that the gate to the center was open so I stopped by. If you don't know it's really a depressing place for me. I feel for alestor but what can you do. I got some horrible news and I have to go do the parenting thing leaving the center did not relieve me of my secondary support obligations I have to be there and I will. I think I might need help with somethings though, I feel flustered and I really don't know what to do now.(Made me really sad) I should have asked for a secretary for christmas. I can honestly say 185 saturdays at the center most of them good and I sit here now thinking back to all the kids I couldn't help.   Okay Okay far too depressing.I could go on for hours so before I start to sell you my point of view.  Anyhoo  It's official I need to write a book because I'm an expert on lesbian relationships. I was right about ms.thang I was a stepping stone from one abusive relationship to the other. I am so smart ,s m r t. :) I wish I could say I hope she's happy but I know she won't be so bleah. I hope she doesn't call me but checking page 18 of my book I see she will. Oh well   Soooo I went out with alestor,BJ and yet another intern from the center after youth group today. I don't know why but for some strange reason me and center interns equal trouble. Even though it's that good kinda trouble I haven't been into in a while. Anywhoo we went to the matrix it was nice for the most part (got cozy with the intern) then we went to the pub (yuck) it was packed and full of groping. We walk over to 735 it was empty but it looked really nice, too much techno for me though.(got a little cozier) Finally we went ot the corner pocket where we drank sprites and watch men shake there money makers.(She was femme I have limits)  Okay so It's like 5am and I'm really sleepy more in the am.

       ::: SNUGGLE PEOPLE :::       Okay today I got up and took off on my bike to look for a new job cause well I want one. The Farthest I got was to the animal shelter then jack frost took a bite out of me. I was on my way home when I noticed the hardware store was open so I stopped in to get some spray paint and masks. (Yes it's almost spraying time) I need some ideas for designs most of the time I just stand there and pop the tops off my cans and it just comes to me. I want something I can atleast remember I painted this time I also need a digital camera so I can take pics after. (So much busy work yeay for me)   I have to focus on something or anything to get me away from the bar(s). My brother has been in and out of town I just hopes he remembers to give me my money for school I'm really trying to get out soon.   xo Randy  Oh my it's a good night for snuggling. (oh wallimeter {teddy bear} your my favorite snuggle buddy) :)  My virtual life on the sims is not that much different from real life. I live with a lesbian roommate that refuses to share a bed with me that also has started dating another sim thats suppose to be a "friend" of the family.

       ::: YIPPY SKIPPY NEW YEAR YA'LL :::     Well I went to the party of the year it was nice for the most part I strutted my asexuality which was new for me. Then came the dropping of jaws when they pointed out the cheerleader outfit and I only said it looked nice. (well it did) So by trying something new I was subject to the "are you alright"? most of the night. I'm fine I'm okay, I just lost the part of me that was open to any sexual possibility. It's just having the self control to make your body almost cringe at the though of having a relationship (sexual) with any woman in new orleans. (eeeww) I mean I have issues with other cities too so it's just a preference thing when it comes to my type. yes I know crazy dykes are everywhere what can you do. I think (I know) I need to be alone another couple of years to figure everything out.  Anyhoo (I need to stay on subject) New years for me is off to a great start got money, support and I got to spend it with my friends. yippy skippy for me :) I had to sleep over with some friends new years day it was great. In the afternoon some other folks came over and we just talk and ate. :) what an awesome day :)  I'm feeling damn good about the new year I'm just hoping everything works out for me. (Or anything for that matter)  I have to go get my med's.(expensive as they are) I want to take good care of myself being sick sucks.

       ::: I'M SO SLACKING ON BLOGGER SO UM HERE'S WHAT HAPPEN :::     8:36 pm - Whoa   Super whoa I totally had a dream about babies last night but I woke a up angry. I was in the middle of fixing my resume when the lights went out and didn't come back on till 4am. So I did in fact go to bed angry. grrr   Anyhoo in my dream there was a baby and it was in a blue jumper and some one handed the baby to me and I said what am I suppose to to do with this. I woke up thinking about what my grammy said about dreaming about babies it either means some one is going to have a baby or someone is going to die or is that fish.(???)  Lately in my dreams I've had this mustache kinda like senior on the motorcycle show I think it's called choppers, that guy rocks.  sorry for the unusual outburst but one of my friends had a dream about babies too. So I just thought it was kinda weird.   Go babies  Xo' Randy   current mood:  weird   (comment on this)     Thursday, February 26th, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   2:32 pm - Sue me cake eater   I'm feeling a little better my meds totally take me off focus and really brings me down.  Um I still don't know what to say about mari graw. I will say it was a learning experience as with most events I attend. It definitely takes the party out of you for a little while. I feel more in the mood for quiet reading group than anything else.  Anywhoo it's time for Angry Dyke's big big party review. :) :) :)   I arrived late making my usual entrance because come on I'm a diva. I got to share huggies and kissies with the folks I love most. The room was fab-u-lous thank you's go out to rooms by deuce. All My friends were looking so wild in their costumes ranging from last years wear(which was to die for) to some things of a newer fashion consisting of but limited to:  A school girl A red headed sailor A Catholic school boy The "fist" (One of my favs) Graffiti girl Two puppets (strings included) Someone who said they were suppose to be someone else.(???) and last but not least val with a soul patch.  I didn't dress up this year which I semi regret but dildos get heavy. Anyhoo The party went on, beer and food disappeared in recored time. Then on to the hot tub where I soaked my tired feet for a bit, after 10 minutes or so I went back to the party. where I watched tv and discussed going over to the mother in law lounge. Can I just tell that place creeps me out, there is a life size model of ernie K-doe of which I heard the outfit is changed daily and yes the eyes follow you around the room. We stayed there about 30 minutes and took some pictures. We got back to the hotel just in time to meet and great with the new comers to the party. There was a spanking contest which concluded the s&m part of the evening. Somewhere in there I waited hand and foot on sandy getting her beers and serving them to her on one knee while calling her martha (Martha stewart)I know I'm weird I get off on the weirdest things.   (Oh martha I've been bad please use your colorful taupe and lime hand knitted tv cozy to teach me a lesson. Oh to share a cell with her)  The night pretty much concluded on the outside porch. where the jew came out of all of us and we argued for a good twenty minutes about who was more jewish, Even thought the truth came out in the end with an agreement of our half breed statues and the fact that I would have kicked ass in the hebrew portion of the contest. I had been drinking though and I still refuse to come out of the closet (oy the goy).   All in All everybody had a good time I suspect, because you never know.   Well until next year put the bottle down.  ........ and I am through  xo' Randy   current mood:  horny current music:  (comment on this)      Tuesday, February 24th, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   11:22 pm - Happy mardi graw   Well, What a day I caught some beads and hung out with friends.  I'm really not ready to give complete thoughts so I will summarize with half ass statements.   Kiki your sixth sense was right on the money.(Wow)  "Sandy sure knows how to give a spanking." :)  "That mags. yea"  I think the twin baby stroller was a good idea.  "Dyke + alcohol = processing (and don't tell me it doesn't)"  "mmm How much $ would dix need to get me a butchies sock or possible undies." (jumping out of my chair on one knee with hands in the air' "super fan") :)  "mmmm kisses for me" :)  "Lets go pick up chicks"  "meet you in the hot tub"  The end. :)    I know I'm suppose to be all "horny" and stuff but the window of opportunity has closed I know I suck. Rules suck and I'm full of them. Back to monogamous little me.(so sorry)  I'm counting the days and hours till I can take a road trip, that desperate for a date? yes I am. :)  I'm thinking maybe it's time I learned the family business. I would only leave town for two months at the most. I need to talk it over with some folks first but I think I'm ready. :/  well time for sleep. :) mmmmm sleep__ZZZzzzz......   xo' Randy

       ::: Dyke school  :::       I need to go back to dyke school to learn the art of courtship. I have no idea What the hell everybody is doing. Everybody's on venus and I'm on pluto. Yes I like random sexual encounters and no I don't want to get to know you or tell you where I live. I don't get it, I'm still trying to figure out sex first dating second relationship continuum. If that did occur than what about all the women you slept with before me that weren't good enough for a relationship. (ewww)    If it's randomness that you want, its random you get. If I thought you wouldn't try to befriend me are call after, I would have gladly complied. I don't find anything sexy about fucking your way to the perfect relationship. Sex first leads to a gray area of love called infatuation. when the two L-words (love and lust)get confused in the brain than you have successfully reach infatuation, even though in some folks case it's just being in love with the idea of being in love. Unlike most of the un-luckies as I like to call them I'm incapable of infatuation. Usually when I think someone is as cute as a bunny next to a puppy it's purely sexual unless a person proves them self to be more than a set a of clothes on my floor. (personality, smarts, ambition or other wise.)  So I guess What I'm saying is.......um...  ... I'm horny. :)  welcome to dyke school  Time to make some calls.

       ::: SICKLY DYKE :::     Well  I've been on a emotional roller coaster lately if you haven't noticed. I started back on my meds Saturday I feel a little bit better but not much I gotta couple of aches and pains but I'm not in crippling pain so yea. I gotta work tomorrow but it's a short shift so I'll be at school most of the day on the net.  I guess being sick just really brings me down even though I'm managing it well enough to function day to day. I mean last time I got sick my mother was out of town and missed my birthday and I lost my best friend all in the same month. How lovely was that.   The truth was I was too unstable to take control of anything.  So last years birthday proved to be a sucky one. I Want to have fun this year my mother is keeping serious tabs on me though because my meds carry a risk of blood clots which in randy terms means heart attack.   I mean yea I'm afraid my meds might mess me up bad and thats why I don't all ways take them.  I hate medication it's just another system to control me. (ick)   Sickly little me.  I feel good though I took my geritol and I feel fine. :)   Well I have work and studying in the am so off  to bed I go    you love me, especially, different   Randy

       ::: WHO WANTS IT :::    Sorry for the title it has nothing to do with the post. tee hee  I might be repeating what happen to me last year it's been about 8 or 9 days since it started with no end in sight. I don't feel different or anything. The last time I started getting tired,  I didn't eat much and my body just kinda ached a little. I don't know what to do next I'm probably going to have my mom call my brother so he can send me money for meds.  When I start my meds I'm going to be out of the loop for at least 2 weeks and I mean come on it's mardi gras. I can't  do it , no work ,no parting, no playing for 2 weeks come on. So the tampon industry is going to see a boost in sales for the next two months and well yea I won't be a good candidate for a sexual partner but whatever.  I called one of my temp services about getting some benefits through them because well I wanna get better. If someone would have told me at 18 years old that I would be hunting for medical insurance I would have said "insurance who in the hells needs insurance that's not a benefit". I see said the blind man who just wanted to go to the dentist. I had a thought not too long ago that I could marry my friend Edward and get put on his insurance but I see the both of us getting caught in our lie. (he's really gay)  Soo who wants to be my domestic partner or claim me rather as their 16 year old step daughter.  I would kill for a job with health benefits or at most push some one down in the HR office.   Yes, I'm searching for the crappiest job I can find with benefits and I'm going to take it and just be sad.   Okay yes, when the cards of life were dealt I got a joker even though I though those were not suppose to be in the deck. It's too late to go back I just have to play it out and hope nobody calls my bluff.  I knew my love life hit an all time low when I found myself singing muskrat love to a plate of Chinese food.  That china town has the best music.  :)  It's the little joys that keep me going.   Favorite song lyrics to live by of the month:    K.D. LANG   Anywhere But Here From Anywhere But Here soundtrack   All too often I set my life aside.  All Too often my dreams went sailing by. A chance of freedom, a chance of fate, a chance I'll take.  Oh leave it all to disappear. I'm heading anywhere but here.  All too often the dreams I've dreamed have died. And all too often I'm never satisfied. A chance of freedom, a chance of fate, a chance I'll take.  * Oh leave it all to disappear. I'm heading anywhere but here. Because I want a life, a souvenir. I'll find it anywhere but here. * I'll find it anywhere but here. I'm heading anywhere but here  I had that dream about north Carolina again I could feel the air and touch the love, it my not even exist there but I'd love to find out.   If you don't eat your meat how can you have any pudding   Randy

       ::: SEXY LITTLE ME :::      Valentines day is coming up and I got a date with sexy little me. :)    After I left from misha's place I took myself out to dinner @ the clover grill I'm so sweet. I had one of those big waffles and blew kisses at myself. Then on the way out I took some of the free flavored condoms for later with myself.  Yes valentines day is coming  up and I am going to take me out on a date I'm so excited I'm so cute.  I'm still in the planning phase of the date maybe a nice dinner and a nice bike ride through the quarter I might buy me some flowers because I'm just so sexy to me. Then if I'm lucky I might get a little action from me later but even if I don't I will still be so in love with me. :)   Well I can barely keep my eyes open and I look like I would like to cuddle so off to bed I go.  Hay give me a break it's the one time of year I can be vain and not have anyone notice. I can't lie though reading this over makes me feel so loved. :)    You so vain you probably think this   Randy  's about you

       ::: LITTLE INSANE ME :::     I've been writing a lot of music lately, I'm actually kinda tired from my fast paced e-bay life style. I got a little ill and had to go back to the geritol, I don't like it at all it smells really bad and it makes me wanna clean. (It's more energy than I'd like to have)  What else can I say I'm a little hard up for a social life I'm starting to wonder what all the buzz is about over this sex in/and the city thingy. I have to know,  I have no life of my own.    I guess I'll write more tomorrow,  I'm falling under my computer desk.  (damn I'm tired)   Never wanna give you up, never want let you down,  never want to   Randy

       ::: How sucky am I :::    Sunday, March 28th, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   8:10 pm - Ha WHAT ?   Well I did learn something this week at work. I have a "song" you know one of those songs when you hear it you have to listen to it all the way through no matter where you are. I know it's weird but I love "sara smile" by hall&oats yes I'm a dork. I went to the center yesterday to check out michelle tea that was nice, she was nice and she didn't smell or anything. :)  We than went to suno to hear poetry. (I'll have more later about that my mind is kinda scattered now)  I guess I'm thinking about a lot of things like, when would be a good time to visit north carolina, paying my bills and this drum set I'm trying to get.  The money part has more of my attention than anything else because I promised myself that I was going to have a drum set this year and I'm going through with. I'm going to be out of debt and I think it's just so weird that things are working out that I'm a little paranoid.  My dad offered to let me drive his car but I guess after so many years of being denied access to it at all. I just kinda brain washed myself into believing it was never an option. I still feel as though it's not an option if I can't get there on my bike it's probably not worth seeing. After my sister took me to get my license my dad somehow found out about it and put me on his insurance yet still wouldn't let me drive his car for over three years. His only response for it was the fact we only had one car so I guess that just meant he has two daughters so fuck it. I have since moved on, now I just really don't feel comfortable driving the car it just has to many bad memories. It did make me think about my own future I do need a car and I'll probably look into it within the next couple of months.    x'o' Randy (yes I'm still horny but mostly for a hug :(   current mood:  contemplative        Saturday, March 27th, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   11:51 am - SSSooooo   Well okay so  Yesterday I worked hard as hell um I went to turn in my pay stub and on the way back I saw my friend val and we talked for a bit about shows and traveling made for a pretty good lunch break. I also saw my friend eddie on the way back to the office and made a lunch date for burger king on monday.(yea I rule)   I had no plans for today but I heard something was happening at the center that will have women there so I'm going over and being nosy. I wish I had more fun things to do I'm so bored and dateless. I do feel like a big dork a big lonely dork.I think I'm just going to ask some folks out randomly then maybe by the like 50th person I'll get a yes. (I'll probably pass out but I'll have a date)  (sigh)  Tis better to have loved and lost then to not have ever loved at all.   "sex whats sex is it a type of seasoning? can I have some sex on my fries"  It's really sad, I so look forward to getting to know the unattainable girls better which for me is everyone in the united states and most european countries.   I'm going to sleep now.   current mood:  blah

       :::  6:12 pm - humf  :::   Um Hi I haven't really been doing much my brain is kinda on auto-pilot. I'm just doing "things" but really I had to lock up all the crazy folks inside of me for a while so basically angry dyke is on a vacation of sorts, so is disgruntled goat, Anti-depressant cat and mouse, Willie the twister playing crack head, Over aggressive activist, handy mc randy the fighting Scottish pirate and Rick James when I'm drunk. You know your basic personality traits. I mean I'm just kinda letting things take there course. I've lost a little weight because I've been sleeping a lot more and riding my bike (peeking around) for exercise you know the thing people do when they want to stay healthy. Really I did that and not because I was going somewhere like I totally had no where to go I was just totally speed riding. My songs are still depressing well some of them. I haven't smoked since I ran out of cigarettes last week can't say I haven't been thinking about it. I haven't had one of those hallucinations yet where I make out with a pack of cigarettes, light one and then fall into a pool back-wards. mmmm ciggaretty pool. I obviously have a problem bare with me.   I need to get out to guitar center so I can even get an idea of what I want drum wise. Mmmmm drumszszzseeesssesss  I actually made an effort to ask someone out on a date but I can't seem to find them now. So (shrug)  I don't know if I'll be at the show tonight but I'm really going to try and make it.  (Taking my shirt off and gliding across the floor) Rock out   Xo' Randy   current mood:  calm

      7:17 pm -  uber fun people       Well yesterday I woke up most excited about the show. I hurried through my work day so I could enjoy the afternoon. :)   okay first I went to molly's and had a shot of jack daniels and one rolling rock I didn't really pace myself and later found myself yelling "move out the way I'm rick james bitch" to passing tourist that were crossing the street a little bit too slow.(Yes I was wrong) Around Poydras street I realized I had a problem and quiet down a bit. I passed the club and didn't really stop on my way to have mexican food.(And lots a water to tame the ol' angry dyke) I had the cheese enchilada with a side of beans it was damn yummy I ate it so fast I still had time to waste before the show (that's what being drunk means, food gone in sixty seconds and then I started entertaining the thought that maybe I didn't get the food at all and what I just ate wasn't really there.) Needless to say I paid the bill and was on my way. I smoked like two cigarettes outside while I wrote in my journal. I then decided fuck it I wanna have fun so I went to Harrahs (casino) to waste more time. I went in with 6 bucks to lose and walked out with 27. (woot woot) So some what sober and with a pocket full of dough I headed toward the club to hang out in front and cause a riot. I met some cool metrey folks and exchanged numbers and e-mails with a lot of them, I networked my ass off. The show was great tragic girls rocked the house hard and those Butchie girls (sigh~) are so kewl. Just when you think they can't get any cooler. what can I say it's tradition.  I actually discussed old Butchies crushes with mesha for a bit .  My old Butchie crush was  Alison .  What ended the crush?  I thought there was sexual incompatibility  but I think that about everyone.   I found out only a few years back that I tend to um(ahem) hurt as well as leave my mark(s) all over my sexual partners which in turn would make me one hell of a groupie. (I can't help it people taste so good)I don't wanna hurt anybody but next time I get any (cough) "loving" I really wanna be in love with that person so when they have to call in to work tomorrow because they are stuck on the couch smiling with an ice pack on they're crotch, I'll know that they're stuck with me.(I just need a little break in time thats all)  tee hee I'm bad...  okay I've been stalling I have good news,bad news and indecisive news.   first the good news I'm actually seriously going to apply to Unc-central this year for the fall/spring semester I think this is finally the year I'm going to make my great escape or atleast the year leading up to the months.  The bad news is I got a sexy little letter from michigan and I was rejected, no michfest for me so my time has been freed up. So if your still trying to get your application going fuck it.  The indecisive news is should I go with a cheap ass drum set or should I go with something I'm more use to like a Mapex or Ludwig?????? hmmmm  okay well xo' Randy   current mood:  horny current music: my toe sqeak and some light air drumming.

       Okay (I'm Back)      I haven't written in a while because I was off being under the weather (understatement- feeling like crap). I spent the whole weekend inside and if you live in new Orleans you know how beautiful outside was this weekend. Anyhoo I'm feeling better I've found my comfort zone at work.:)   I don't really know why I'm not happy yet though.   I know some things are missing from my life but I mean come on I got a good job. I'm getting outta debt I'm probably finally going to eligible for a grant this year instead of a student loan. I get my drum set, the thing I have longed for since I was 6 next month that's right April. I get to go to Durham just like I wanted and party. I'll be available for Michigan with no strings attached and I feel like a hundred bucks.   yet I feel very empty and I really want a puppy.............. a bulldog.........with a big belly for petting..............and a kitty..........that drools.  I don't know, well I guess I do know there's not many thing that I can't have in this world right now. I just can't have what I really want.(You know the thing, even a false sense of it.) I must over compensate I can either look into getting something really expensive for myself or put something in layaway that's very expensive for myself or having the meal of the century which includes but not limited to pizza, fries, cheeseburgers, ice cream, chocolate pudding (skin on) and one strawberry short cake OOooorrr I can just be a grown up about it. Ick  Damn you age and responsibility you restrict my spending habits to a reasonable amount while controlling my diet so I do not become obese. Damn you adulthood damn you to hell. aahhhhh  Okay crisis averted (depression is a deep hole that's hard to miss if you know what I mean and If you don't just nod your head like you do)  Anyhoo the butchies show is Thursday and I will most certainly be there after I go and drink myself hungry at molly's and after I go and have Mexican food just two blocks away. I never have time to make it out to that restaurant so yeeaaa burritos and cheese enchiladas for me.(more beans please :) ) -     Lovely days ahead   xo' Randy

       ::: DOWNTOWN :::      When you're alone and life is making you lonely You can always go -  downtown. When you've got worries all the noise and the hurry Seems to help I know -  downtown. Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty How can you lose? The lights are much brighter there you can forget all your troubles Forget all your cares so go - downtown Things will be great when you're - downtown No finer place for sure - downtown Everything's waiting for you - downtown.   yes Downtown thats where I will be for the next 5 months. I'll be working with the state again I loved that job so much I went today to pick up my badge. I realized also that the cloud of sadness that loomed over my head was very much real as the air smelled better and the sky looked brighter today. I must admit I have been feeling the hurt of that shitty job. I couldn't sleep at night,I had really bad headaches and my muscles in my back were getting tighter. I could barely function an entire day without slipping into deep depression. So yea I've put on a little depression weight. Then I went into this little I don't wanna eat any more phase (That might have contributed to the headaches). I started feeling weak and tired my body started having it's own little temper tantrums (I'll spare you the details of that). I feel a little tired but emotionally I feel better now. :)  I guess with all things going the way they are if I get a my conformation from michigan I can go with no excuses. (How grand)   I think in a few days I will be back to my old self. Power is an illusion unless your heman than you have the power of gray skull or your wonder woman than you'll have that lasso of truth which whoa is lot of power.   um okay yea I'm quiting, I'm bringing my shirt back tomorrow.   I will not.... Pee on it set it on fire in the parking lot. wrap it around my bosses head and say "can you smell what angry dyke is cooking". throw it at the front door from the bus. take all the buttons off it.   Out with the negative in with the positive. I will hand the shirt over without a comment of any kind in reference to any ones intelligence, looks, rectal cavities or sexual origination or lack there of.(That should hold me off for a couple of minutes.)  It's a new day it is a nice day. I think I'll go outside and play.   xo' Randy    current mood:  happy- thats right I used this emotion current music: B52's -Rock Lobster

       ::: Whats your point :::     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Tuesday, March 9th, 2004 11:36 am -    Everybody has goals in life but most people have that one supreme goal that one thing you really want. I can easily admit my over all goal is power over my own life and some other folks too. So I usually pick jobs and/or majors that lead to careers where I would have control even over the boss.(i.e. computer technology, accounting) The kinda job where you can walk up to you boss and say kiss my ass,get me a pizza I got work to do. yea 4 months later he might try to fire me but without knowledge of my filing system or my source code he doesn't stand a chance. Then even if he does fire me there's some poor joe schmo sitting outside his business with his books in one hand and the peachtree program on disk in the other mumbling something about a tax break he just has to get. Yea I'd make a lot of money or have a nice office but the bottom line is that I would have some power. I want to be a legend. I want people to still talk about me after I retire.   (I hate the 12th floor so much thats where the dragon lady lives, I took the last chocolate covered donut and that bitch audited my department 3 times in one year. (omg here she comes avert your eyes.)  I want to send over paid men home late and force them to work weekends just so I can know where that 84 cents went. I love the smell of paper work in the morning and the sound of computer buzz. It's great.  I want to have a private bathroom near my office and just for kicks grab a shit load of paper work and run through some department str8t to their boss's office close the door and slam the paper work on the desk and say "hay, do you have some gum". Then take there boss out to lunch to make it look we're up to something.   (sigh) My demands are simple.  My music has some priority some where in there. Love will fall some where around there. I don't have control over who I band-up with or when I will find ms.right so they are just kinda swirling around the orb which is my career.  I guess the whole point of this is shit will happen when it'll happen. Don't make demands or set up false goals, life is whats happening while your trying to change yourself in the waiting room.   Does that make sense.......    xo' Randy (The observer)   current mood:  hopeful

       ::: WHO LOVES KNOWING THINGS :::     10:18 pm - huh   I don't know what to say I'm uncomfortably numb. I haven't hated a person in so long but I despise my boss.   God is a comedian I can tell.  Out of the flame into the fire am I cursed to forever have gay white males control my fate. I'm trying to keep this job with the hope I learn the horrible life lesson that I can't just quit a job just because I don't like it. Thats right I've been mothered most of my life you hate your job than just quit. The morbid thoughts that swirl around my brain, dreaming what I thought I was never capable of even thinking and enjoying the unattainable violence of it all. My boss, he's clueless I wonder what it feels like to be handed everything. He's so naive he thinks the world is a wonderful place where anybody can do anything they want and jobs are readily available for the picking. I realize this is a flavor that does not mix well with angry dyke a strong bitter drink best served cold.    I need to find another job fast. My patience is wearing thin and When I get stressed out I get sick.  My hormones are seriously out of wack but my beard is growing in nicely.  No, I don't have a rant mostly because my brain is scrambled. I'm burnt out and miserable.  I'm still waiting on that income tax check and with my current emotional state I wouldn't be surprised if I bought a one way ticket out of here.

Okay really I have been trying to find a better job. Between trying to find something for myself and dealing with this overflow of "gay" at my job I'm exhausted and broke too.   I neglected to mention I ran into ms.thang over mardi graw. Since my hormones have been outa whack anyway I see no reason not to keep somebody around. (you never know)    I think I might try to get out of the house tomorrow and hang out a bit.  Yes that’s right I haven't done a damn thing in two weeks.

       6:09 pm - What       I've been laying around for the last couple of days feeling sorry for my self because that’s what I do best. Okay really I have been trying to find a better job. Between trying to find something for myself and dealing with this overflow of "gay" at my job I'm exhausted and broke too.   I neglected to mention I ran into ms.thang over mardi graw. Since my hormones have been outa whack anyway I see no reason not to keep somebody around. (you never know)  I think I might try to get out of the house tomorrow and hang out a bit.   Yes that’s right I haven't done a damn thing in two weeks. I think these tax return checks got me feeling a little lazy. I'm just so excited about the butchies show even though I know I'm a sucky fan. You know The kind that will forget to buy tickets to a concert just so I can have a cheeseburger instead.

      ::: Where have I been What :::  7:57 pm - Paranoid    I need to get out of the house I'm becoming a little paranoid. Well this weekend and due to poor planning on my part I'll be spending saturday at jazz fest with my parents. I'm thinking of not going with them and just staying at home though. :(   My big birthday weekend is not looking so great I don't really have a plan. I have no idea what I'm going to do.   If any one has any ideas about what I should do please respond. I want to do something thats fun and or totally immature and ridiculous.    I must take hold of my youth and leave the daily grind if only for a day to have fun damit.   "If at all you believe in the aging of the soul than you will see my wisdom despite my face." - Randee    It's a time for reflection so I have to choose, give up smoking or go on a diet. I have to smoke again do to the demands of my job and my finals. I got out of bed feeling more like my dad than myself this morning just a little sore all over. I'm dealing though.    I've been tagging again I need more paint I never seem to have enough. If I carried anymore with me I'd sound like one giant can of spray paint. I haven't had a chance to break out my skate board yet but I think about it everyday when I'm downtown and I see all those rails and inclines and mmmmm rails. (Drools)    I need to make more friends. :(    There's a job that I want and I'm crossing my fingers on it come on IRS.   x'o's Randy Mclonely   current mood:  anxious current music: The butchies - trouble   (2 comments | comment on this)     Monday, April 26th, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   6:21 pm - So riot   Oh that sadmaddog, she's so riot. It was such a delight to read what she had to say in the paper this morning at work. Rock on  Well I've been kinda jittery lately 7 days in counting till my birthday and I have no idea what I'm going to do. The day after my birthday my parents will be out of town so I'm going to need to chain myself to a doorknob far away from the phone so that I don't call my ex for well you know.   I need to find an inexpensive practice space for my drums that are soon to be.  This weekend I decided to do my I'm soo bord and lonely routine. I got up saturday and finally dragged myself out of the house to ride my bike for a couple of hours. I went to mid-city to argue with some folks over at my old job over a tape that they said I didn't turn in. I didn't argue with the little smartass manager I decided to take the high road and call in a favor from my old fellow co-workers who hate hollywood video just as much as I do. So I took a deep breath and peddled off to fairgrinds where I had some um water because I don't drink coffee. Than I just kind of peddled around. After that I went to cowpokes, I love it, I can go there and listen to sad country, drink budlight, and dance the night away with some nice uh cowpokes. I left there and met Alestor for some moon wok mmm so yummy as always but it gave some of my friends gas so we have to find a new place for saturday night dinners. After that I tagged along to the gay boy bars where we stayed for what seemed like forever. I (peeking around) sometime like gay boy bars because they make me feel so sexy. I got my chub rubbed. :) Some guy felt the need to stroke my belly. While another man rubbed my back and said "I wish were a man".   Yea I'm just so damn sexy I don't know what to do. :P J/kidding  I miss my friends :(  Cody came through I got the new butchies cd and dvd.   Thanks anyway to anyone who might have offered help on some matters. :)winking~   Anyhoo test this week and next week and thats it.  I guess all thats left to say is where's the party?   Xo's Randy   current mood:  accomplished current music: patty griffin -- :) mmmmm   (comment on this)     Saturday, April 24th, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   3:13 am - meh   Well you see what time it is (peeking at the clock) I've been on the phone with my ex-Natasha. Sigh~ I think my wednesday horoscope was right. I have to choose, I wanted sex sooo bad I was almost happy she called because I knew she was an easy lay and yes, I've broke down it's been too long. I'm sooo horny (running off and hiding in a closet)  anyhoo the point is we were on the phone most of the night. She spent a majority of that time masturbating and declaring her love for me. I actually fell asleep alot through out the conversation. It's definitely a case of too little waaayyyy too late. I was 19 when we were together I'll be 23 in a week. I can't take a step back, I declared my love for her 5 years ago it's so pass over.  On the one hand if I sleep with her I get what I want but then I gotta deal with the love thing in the morning.  If I date her I'd only be doing it for sex because she really doesn't have anything to offer in a relationship.  Sigh~x2  You can't have it all. I'm going to take the high road on this and be totally honest about how I feel. I suck so much why can't I be mean like everyone else.  If anyone else would like to declare there love for me speak now or forever hold your peace.     Xo's Randy   current mood:  aggravated current music: meh

      ::: Okay were caught up:::  Oh blogger I love you    Sunday, April 18th, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   2:44 am - yea   Well I'm home from my night on the town. It was a learning experience I can say that much about it. First I went to sweet waters which is around my house for the initial birthday party. Then we went on to this new gay bar near uh st bernard and galvas.  Sweet waters was not my cup of tea. Okay I hated it and I'd never go near that place again it's one of those poorly run neighborhood bars. I didn't really like the crowd that it drew and I felt very uncomfortable. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. After that we all decided to go to the gay bar I think it's called fusions ???. Anywhoo it was there that I discovered that not only am I out of the loop but I'm old too. They were playing these songs that I never heard before and the whole crowd was just different. The femme's were out in full force as it seem no matter where I moved it got a little crowded. I don't think I went more then 2 minutes with out having a conversation of some sort but alas it was lost on me. No really hot butches either they were all a wee bit short, like 10-year-old boy short. There was tiny part of me that wanted to make a date with anyone but those women are a little shady, might have a couple of kids at home or a boyfriend or are bi-sexual but leaning more towards women.(I don't know what that means but it doesn't sound promising)I mean they were very sexy ladies there and if I weren't so damn gay I would have gotten an eyeful.   yawn' oy time for bed.  xo's Randy   current mood:  sleepy current music: huh   (comment on this)     Thursday, April 15th, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   10:35 pm - Damit   Well I had a stressfully day today I worked way too hard this week. I'm not sure what I'm going to do this weekend or friday evening. I'm open to suggestions so please feel free to share. Somebody needs to throw a party like now.  Yea I got this little thing on saturday but it's not going to be fun or anything, I'm not quite sure of what to expect. I'm wondering if this is going to be the corporate kinda crowd like me and eddie or are they gonna be like club hoppers. I mean our little black queer community has some pretty big walls and we are all so different that there are the beginnings of language barriers. I'm kinda hoping the crowd will be more on my end or atleast have some cute college girls there. (Fingers crossed if not I'll be home by 9 to post about it)   Well on the dream front I guess the girlfriend in my dream and me broke up. She's in the dreams but we are not together. I miss her a little, I miss those long dreams where we just held hands and talked under trees. The weird thing is the dream girlfriend is a real person yet I know I could never ask the real person out(too afraid of rejection) and I'm actually more interested in the dream version anyway even though neither of them will sleep with me.  xo's Randy   From Carlybobarly:  optional: I would like if everyone who reads this asks me 3 questions, no more no less (unless of course you are compelled to thrash these rules, then by all means do so).  Ask me anything you want.  Then, if you'd enjoy, go to your journal and copy & paste this allowing your friends (including myself) to ask you anything.   current mood:  contemplative current music: -as we lay, :) I for got who sings it

       ::: TWO MORE YEA :::    8:27 pm - Yep   Well the week is just flying by. I had an accounting test yesterday that I'm not too happy about.   I need A's it's all I have in the world.  Anyhoo half off day at thrift city and now they take credit cards so after work thats where I'll be. I actually entertained the idea of going at 7am but I guess I can wait till after work.  There's a party this weekend it's kinda complicated to discuss right now but my friend invited me and it's his party.   I can't really get into what the party consist of because I'd have to get into black culture and stuff and I really don't have that much time. I'd like to get some sleep.  Tomorrow though I'm all about it.   xo' Randy   current mood:  horny current music: cheese   (comment on this)     Tuesday, April 13th, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   10:17 pm - tee hee :)   I have been having this reoccurring dream of this person(not on of my friends or anything) that I think I could possibly be attracted to but if I admit it I'd just be torturing myself. The point is I want the dreams to stop I mean they are not sexual or anything we are just kinda in a relationship and we sit around and talk the whole dream. The first two times it was okay but almost every night for 2 weeks and she's dominating my fantasies. I thought about this the majority of the day and I think that the dream may be some kind of punishment for an earlier post I made, if so it fits well.   (Sigh)  I'm sorry, skinny girls are hot. so what if they lack love handles dosen't mean the ride won't be as good.  Go skinny girls.

March 29, 2004 - 07:23 AM  late input   hey, i realize you've been off this thread for a bit but i just joined...   anyhow. when i was younger, i had a good list of what i wanted from a partner. (still have it, tho much updated.) i was told that i was shooting too high and all that. hm. i tried settling. doesn't work. i think knowing what you want and trying to be real about seeing it when it comes will work. you also have to be willing to work for it. expecting the perfect mate to not only walk into yr life but to seize the opportunity and stroll over and tell you they're the one is a bit unrealistic.   within the queer community, we don't have nearly the same concepts of age and relationships. there's not a certain point after which you'll be ineligible or too old to find a mate. don't lose heart. fill it with the love that you will give when you find the one.   as for the smart but not yet successful... hmmm. one of our taurean shortfalls is the reluctance to take risks. maybe that's why the difficulty in both love and career. they do require risks.  mlove   I Think someone asked a question about taurus dating. I think it helps some what.  I realize that it should make perfect sense to me since I have never choose my partners. My partners have always chosen me. I can't say that I haven't tried, I've asked like one girl a year on a date so that brings me to like 3 thats a lot for me. I'm just really shy and come on rejection hurts. I spend weeks building up nerve just to flirt (  Someone told me that saturn has pushed a taurus moon or didn't come into our system or something like that but anyway life is suppose to be easier for the taurus. Things have been going great I guess I mean I have more money and I'm less stressed.   I mean I haven't made any advances this year so maybe it's time I should physically ask someone out. :/   okay I'm sleepy time for the final wrap-up of last week which felt like the longest week ever.  monday- I was torn between sitting on my ass or going to seder. tuesday- I spent the time polishing up on my hebrew instead wednesday- I pouted at the many books I lost on ebay.(damit people it's passover) thursday- I spent most of the day working and packing (how exciting) friday left- sunday came back, Today I worked too damn hard I'm dog tired  till tomorrow  Xo' Randy   current mood:  artistic current music: team dresch   (1 comment | comment on this)     Saturday, April 10th, 2004

       ::: Almost There :::    yea  10:35 pm - *Superstar*   Well tomorrow I leave for new orleans I have enjoyed my trip for the most part. I had some time to think and my brother decided I needed new shoes so I got new shoes yeay me. It's the first pair of new tennis I have had since I was in high school class o' 99.   I will miss the georgia sky at night, it reminded me of michigan how you could see every star. You can not hear trains or traffic even though you know it's there.   I remember  I remembered why it was so important to me to move away. These big cities bring me down, Too much going on too fast. I like the idea of going home and hearing nothing but crickets outside of my window. My brother lives in one of those fancy upscale neighborhoods where you can't have your flag turned 4 degrees pass you window or something like that. I don't like that, if it's my house I want to do what I want with it.(within state law) Parties every weekend or just getting drunk and running around my back yard naked it's my house damit.   I hung out with cody and we just talked about the transition and life. I don't know what to think I know cody isn't sarah and I know cody isn't the girl with the beard that I left in atlanta but the back of my mind kept pushing the question forward of who is this white man I'm talking to and why would he care if I'm crampy. I don't know I guess with all the phone calls and the e-mails I never changed the picture in my mind to accommodate what was happening. It's weird your just staring at a face looking for something familiar and come up empty handed.   (sigh)  anyhoo I loveeee road road trips. woot woot   Can't wait to get back to new orleans though I need a beer. Rollimg rock and a shot of jack with a friend.  I have a lot of thoughts I've been jotting down in my journal but I could not possibly stay up for the rest of the night posting them.   SSSooooooo  C.U.l8ter Randy   current mood:  thankful current music: led zep- I'm going through a phase I'm sure it'll pass :)       1:51 pm - Huh ???   from Jonathan Cainer Friday, 9th April 2004    TAURUS  (Apr 21 - May 21)  Why do you want a happy-ever-after? Do you have no thirst for adventure? Do you want to spend the rest of your life wallowing in quiet complacency, leading a flat, dull existence in a world devoid of depth and drama? Bland contentment is monochrome. If you want to sample the rich Technicolor of true fulfilment, you must be prepared to mix the light with the dark, the difficult with the easy, the stressful with the wonderful. Stand back from the canvas this Easter. Life may be intense but you are looking at a masterpiece.   Screw this, jonathan cainer dosen't know taurus. (pouting)...... ......  Nooooo it's true, he's right. I drew a happy face on the mona lisa because I thought she shouldn't be sad. I don't ride my bike fast because I don't want to fall off and I don't want to date just anybody because I don't want to get hurt.   Is it so wrong to wanna wear my life's helmet all the time.(with elbow pads and shin guards included and that stupid little chin strap)  Anyhoo  It's almost cody time :)  whoot whoot  x'o's Randy "If it don't fit, don't force it, get some lube for it" (Some how got thrown in the mix of me trying to put batteries in my camera)   current mood:  curious

       ::: yeeaa we're doing good :::   (part 3 of catching up)   8:03 pm - hello   Hi.   tee hee  Even though I'm all crampy I still "feel" better. When the trip first started I wondered why I liked road trips anyway and then when I saw this clean new place that didn't smell like piss and beer. I remembered why it was so important for me to move in the first place. (That and the fact that my nephew is making 10$ an hour working at jiffy lube.) The air is clean the roads are nice (sigh) yea I mean it's country as all hell but I like it. (oh wait for the folks who don't know I'm in georgia, peachtree city to be exact.) Because of the crampiness of my situation I have not contacted my ex and I probably won't. The only thing that's cramping my style besides the cramps is the fact that I only have 2 cigarettes left. I only bought three I should have known better when the first cramp hit but damit I'm suppose to be quitting.   Anywhoo I made it. I have computer access and I have my parents spending money on me. :)  I still kinda feel the pressure of the real world but it's not so heavy out here. :)  Tomorrow I'm going out into the city with my family and I'm going to try to hook up with my newly transitioned friend cody in the afternoon. Go cody tee hee :)  xo's Randy   current mood:  happy

      Thursday, April 8th, 2004 7:00 pm   (part 2 of catching up)   Well yea   -Yo Taurus  Today's planetary energies   Responsibilities towards family, partners, and your career might be grating on you today, and you might be thinking in terms of throwing in the towel and running away. This might actually be a good idea - for a day. Be a little adventurous; go somewhere you've never been before, or do something out of the ordinary. Tomorrow you'll be back in the swing of things and ready to face the real world again. Enjoy your day.-    Well yea  I'm heading out to atlanta in a couple of hours for the weekend. I guess I need this (shrugs) Today I'm a little more spaced out than anything.   I'm sleepy as all hell but I think I left some things out of the last post.   Okay  On tuesday I went to tower records to get the butchies new album mostly because there was suppose to be a dvd that came with it 20 dollars and 5 minutes later I had it with no dvd inside. 10 minutes and an insult later I was 20 dollars richer with no butchies cd.  Yea so I guess I'm going to have to take things into my own hands and either e-bay it or burn it through kazaa. My other hook ups didn't quite work out. {sigh}  :( I want a puppy that farts and a rabbit that thinks he's people.:) (teehee)   I feel a little acky I think I'm going to nap for a bit.

       11:48 pm - FReakinG out   wednesday, april 7th    (Time to play catch up)  YEs I am freaking out, I'm staying up late, I'm sweating like crazy and I have the most horrible case of the jitters ever. My life for the past couple weeks has been crazy. I have been all over the emotional rainbow every where but happy. I don't know how to describe it.   I'm a little perplexed I'll be 23 in a few weeks and the sky is falling. All the trains are headed at me, all far too fast.  I'm dealing with a barrage of dilemmas including but not limited to finally figuring out my life's calling as a CPA and finally getting out of a debt and college. Only to recently be capped off by Idea that I might be a parent by the end of the year. Most people would see all these things as good things but I have to set up all the payment arrangements, I have to hold down a job, I have to make good grades, I have to go to court. My schedule is so tight that yes the jack Danial's is looking really good about now.    I'm trying to avoid the after work before school drink.  I haven't quit smoking entirely but considering I'm still working on the pack I bought last month I'm doing very good. I have about a 5 cigarette a week habit. (I've been swamped at work.)   I'm going to atlanta for the weekend with my family (I think) for a much needed break.   I might(keyword) hook up with my ex while there yea she's a little girly but whatever will do right now. I'm hard up for some affection I want the feeling of before and the snuggling after, thats so hard to find. :(   I've just been feeling a little okay a lot down lately.    If anyone has any suggestions please do share.   {a happier time} {I know this july will be the 3rd (maybe more because I stopped counting} year I haven't had any type of you know or relationship of sorts, yea so you know lots of lonely walks and dinners alone and third wheeling it around the city. I just don't know where I fit in sometimes. I wonder how long I'm going to wait for love. Not my friends ex-girlfriend, Not the bi-sexual from up the street and not with sex before I know your last name. I will get it on my terms, I just wonder how long sometimes. I think about what it would be like to just have this person that just thinks about you all day and gets all blushy when they talk about you. I think about how if they were ever late how I would just stand around and wait for them because I know that when they finally do show up I would get showered with hugs and kisses and a million apologies and I'll just grin like it was nothing. Then I started to wonder how long would I wait? 5 minutes 10 maybe a couple of hours, maybe even a couple of years. Then I think in all honesty that for the woman I loved I'd wait forever.}   {Taking a chill pill and increasing the porn collection}   I think I'll wait over here some where with my Rubik's cube and my lego blocks.     as you were.    xo' Randy   current mood:  determined current music: siiiiiippp ahh love that mugs

      Sunday, May 16th, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   9:05 pm - Thinking   I love office work (dancing around the room) I know a lot of people think I'm immature. For me thats a good thing because I'm a workaholic, one of those super anal tight wads that likes to get all the work done in a prompt manner. Yea I know I suck.   I need to find a balance of some sort I guess. blah  The drumset of my dreams is within my reach I need to find a practice space before I get it because the first thing I'm going to want to do is play it like crazy.  oh I'm such a lonely little nerd.  I've been thinking alot about the whole michigan thing and I don't think I will be reapplying this year. I get enough rejection in my everyday life. I know I'll probably regret it 3 months from now but What can you do.(shrugs)  3 more hours and people will be getting married. Wow   X'o' Randy   current mood:  restless current music: Don't fear the reaper        2:36 am - A night at the opera   Well I don't know how everybody else's saturday night went but I had a pretty good time. tee hee  Ssooo I left my house about 7pm or so and I headed down towards flora for a smoke and to decide what I was going to do next. I decided to go by the ark, nothing was there so I went to the center. On the way to the center I met two girls on bike and they told me about this free concert at the country club @9. So they took off and I hung out at the center watching superstar for like 2 hours. At about uh 10:30 I took off to go to the hi-ho where this band was suppose to be.(Shrugs) Anyhoo I got there and there was like 5 people inside and the girl at the door was like 5 bucks and I'm thinking like 5$ bucks for what. The price I heard was 4 dollars so in the face of the crappy crowd and that one dollar. I decided to go to the country club instead.   Duuuuddddeee there is like a bike riders convention in town and all the cute riot kids where out there swimming and drinking and parting it up. I grabbed me a rolling rock and a plate of food and I was on my way. As I was about to dance with the pink elephant justin walked in and we mingled with all the ladies for a bit. Than Justin left and I sobered up just enough to go swimming. There is nothing like riding your bike all day than jumping into a nice warm pool.   Anyhoo I had a great saturday night and I'm soo tired.   Rolling rock-$2 Towel-$1 party @ the country club-free watching two naked girls dance to salt and pepper- priceless  yep yep yep yep yep I'm sleepy til tomorrow  X'o' Randy   current mood:  tired current music: Queen

      12:49 am - Weeeeee   Sometimes it's good to be randy.......................  I guess I should complete some sentence I started way back when. Thanks for all the help to all the folks that like to make an angry dyke smile. (i.e. I have two copies of the butchies dvd and 145 butchies stickers)I've been trying to figure out the best way to relieve myself of all the stickers. I mean I could give them away at the show but how do I know for sure their not going to be selling them for a dollar inside and there I am on the outside yelling stickers 50 cents. yea I'll figure it out. I was thinking about posting the other dvd on ebay after I get it autographed but that would be a lot of work on my part. :)  I'm buying (peeking around) a playstation I feel like a lonely loser I need to have a set up like one.   I got my computer, video games, some porn, my pc magazine subscription. Oh yea ladies, here I come. I just so damn sexy. (rubbing oil on tummy)  Yea I can't say my diet was a complete failure because well I spent last weekend sitting on my ass eating and taking meds. So this week we start anew. I'm still trying to figure out how I'm going to go about this low carb or vegetarian.   Open to suggestions__________  Sometimes it's not so good  Perception is a horrible thing. If I had to draw myself as a cartoon I would be a very pale, short, stocky, balding man with a big ass and no eyebrows. I truly believe my character would get a date before me. yes it's true my self esteem is a little low. just a tad    Today my weirdo meter is about 48% (Today on cnn we will discuss the capture of george w.bush and the reluctance of the american people to bargain to get him back "I got one jaw breaker and a shoelace is that enough, no thats if you keep him")    Xo's Randy   current mood:  calm current music: flipping trough pc mag, 80GB HD beat that fool

      10:09 pm - mishi little me   I'm feeling sooo mucha better :) my parents took my to dinner tonight and then to bally's casino I had a great time. It's weird because I still don't think my parents get it. All these years and all the birthdays and christmas gifts. (sometimes nothing and mostly socks) I had fun just being with them it was the best gift I ever got and I won ten dollars. We just sat and talked and ate and gambled and then we found like 3$ in quarters in a machine just sitting there so I split it with my parents and we all played side by side for like a couple of minute it was great. We were home by 7pm and it was a surprise I had no idea I was going out tonight.   What is up with people over 50 and those nickle machines man they get crazy walkers and all.   Anyhoo good times had by all. I really needed the pick up though one of my favorite co-workers is being transfered to meterie. :(  So now it's just me, my co-worker derrick, the lazy temp and the lazy co-worker. The woman who is leaving is one of those people that's just nice to everyone. She never curses or gets mad or tries to make you convert to whatever she is. I just think it really sucks that she's leaving why can't they take the lazy girl she hates to work and she loves to shop she'ed be perfect for meterie.   Sigh~  I just don't like things to change especially when I have to lose something in the transfer. :( damn my constant state of menopause. I watched hairspray twice just to get my cry out. I was going a long time I almost had to rent a league of their own.(again) I just didn't want to get caught awake at like 4 in the morning looking at a united negro college fund commercial. Those usually set me off pretty bad too.  Will somebody please help Keisha make it to college. Can't you see she wants to be with her friend. Damit  sigh~  Today I think the weirdo meter has to be about 98% (I wanna walk out in the rain with my socks on and slap you on the shoulder with them)  Sometimes I think I share too much info but it turns out I'm just one of those poor saps with nothing to hide.

       ::: whoa blogger :::   I'ma have to blog here more often how nice oohhh la la so plush and perfect.     Monday, May 10th, 2004  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   6:41 pm - Ahem   I'm feeling a lot better today it really sucks that I couldn't get out of the house all weekend I really wanted to hang out. All I could do was sit and think.   I thought about women, moving, work, cheese, my diet, being sick, porn, motorcycles, bicycles, vans, my friends, old friends, dead people famous and not so famous, people who are just missing in action, smoking, skating and love.   My life is so strange.  I feel like a complete weirdo 75 percent of the time.   I think about soo many things all day at work all I can think about is journaling but than I get in front the puter and nothing.   I don't really know what to say......  Okay I got something so um I was at the phoenix last saturday up stairs in that dark area. (Alester snuck me up there) I was suppose to go to the matrix than I saw it was a str8t bar so I left. I guess their metro-sexual or something. ick  So yea I know no women allowed right. Well I was up there checking out the hardware trying not to get felt up and I thought why don't lesbians have a bar like this. I thought of 50 million reasons why not, before I even finished the first thought.   I guess I'm just bored for the most part there's not really anything to do in this city and a whole lot of stuff I'd rather not do alone. I know I keep putting off the big move but thats mostly because of my job(s) and school. If it was up to me I would have been gone like yesterday last year sometime. I'm glad I'm waiting as long as I am because I've learned so much about north carolina. :)  I miss my friends their so far away (midcity is just a dream 8 miles too far)  sigh~  Atleast I have my health again.. . . . . . . . .  I really need a date :( or a random sexual encounter or cuddles I need cuddles damit. {running away from the computer} aaaggggggghhhhhhhhh  xo's Randy  uugghhhhh I just got off the phone with my guy pal eddie he had to update me on who is gay now from the folks we went to high school with. I'm starting to think maybe just maybe that school really was on top of toxic waste.   current mood:  bored current music: The tv and my mouth harp :) thwanggggg

      ::: yes thats right your up todate ::: Tada   Well I'm sick, I don't know what wrong but I wheeze at night and have coughing fits. My parents are gone so at least the house has been quiet for me to study for my exams this week. I feel like crap I might not go to work in the am or I might just leave early. I haven't been doing much just some yoga, a little song writing, learning some foreign languages mostly Hebrew now and a little Portuguese later. Yea sounds a little weird but I was just kinda messing around on eBay and decided the next language that pops up that’s the one I will learn just happen to be Portuguese.  I don't even know where Portuguese is (jk) okay maybe not Portuguese but I need something cool to learn.I'm sooo bored. I just want a cuddle is that too much to ask?  I got rid of the ex I just told the truth and she's gone. I should have tried to get cuddles first but what can you do.  I think I have a fever; I can't wait to get this test over with. I'm at school right now trying to waste time before the test. Yes I should be studying or trying to cram but my head feels kind of heavy, my lung is trying to escape and I swear I have phlem for days.   I had a good time Sunday with my friends at jazz fest. :) It was the high point of my big birthday weekend. Well that and the birthday card with cash in it I got from my co-workers. cha-ching. I'm loved. :)   I saw wyclef and he touched me (jumping up and down in my head) how exciting was that. His music is very good I never really heard much of it. He is a very good entertainer best show I've seen in the city I guess since the butchies. (tee hee) I love people who get in the crowd. You get just close enough to get the masturbation touch. You know the shoulder rub the arm touch or basically any kind of contact that can get you um ah going.    I haven't been eating fast food and I have been exercising. See what happens when we try children. (Pausing to hack up a lung)Oh cheeseburger I'm so sorry I'm going back to my mc life next week. Yes I'm addicted and yea that was a weak excuse to get a cheeseburger but damit look at me look at me well um imagine me. (Cough)   Well that’s the second weird look from the fake computer tech on duty so I’d best be off.   I gotta test to take, a lozenge to suck on, some tussin to down, some jack danials to help it along and a couple slices of cold pizza in the fridge waiting on me.   Till next time  Bye ya'll (doing that little Beverly hillbillies wave in my head you to fill in the banjo yourself) xo's Randy   current mood:  sick current music: cough, hack, wheeze

      Sunday, May 2nd, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   3:26 am - ~Super Sigh   I think I need a journal break. I'm in a place where I don't really have much else to say about anything.   xo's Randy   current mood:  depressed current music: Soundgarden- Black hole sun   (comment on this)     Saturday, May 1st, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   6:34 pm - Open window   Well my big birthday weekend is off to a very shitty start I woke up to a note from my parents saying that they didn't want to go to jazz fest today because it might be rainy. I go outside I look around it looks like nice day so I wait a bit from 9am-1pm hoping maybe they would come home and we could still go. I guess they just had more important things to do. So I decided to call some folks and see if anyone wanted to hang out at all, the only person I got a hold of was Jeff so I jumped on my bike and was off to go with Jeff to the bank. I finally made it over after I stopped for some bike air. We decided instead to walk to an atm and then went to have root beer and burritos with Justin. Jeff kept talking to someone on the phone giving them directions to where we were so we inquired about who it was he was talking too. He didn't want to tell us so five minutes or so passed and he ran out of floras and jumped into a car, so me and Justin went out side to see who it was. It was Emily and she was going to the jazz fest. He barely said goodbye and he actually told us he was going to sleep the rest of the day. Keeping in mind that I offered to go to the jazz fest with Jeff just hours earlier. ~sigh  It actually upset Justin more than me, I just did not want to have to get mad or feel sad today. I'm pretty much over that, not so much that I won't harbor some kind of sub-conscious grudge that will play itself out in some supreme act of desertion. I'm a Taurus it's what Taurus do. You have to literally grovel and beg for a Taurus’s forgiveness a simple sorry will never do even if we do except it. We never forget, but revenge is not really my thing. Well I'm in the center hanging out with Alestor trying to salvage my day. It's raining I feel a little down I won't be able to go to jazz fest tomorrow because I have to do my take home test and study for my exams next week maybe I can take a 2 hour break (correction) I'm not depending on anyone else for my fun or to celebrate my birthday with me. I'm going to take two hours out of my day tomorrow and I'm going to jazz fest I'm going to eat a Cuban sandwich, say hi to my friends and call it a day. My birthdays are always depressing and sad and amazingly people tend to forget it more often than anyone else I have ever known. (correction) No one has ever remembered my birthday even my parents forgot last year and I spent most of the week dodging their phone calls after the fact.   Well it's almost time to go have dinner with me and then I'll be meeting Alestor at the matrixxx and we all know how much I love that place. :(   I mean I have two days to go until I can get this crap over with. Monday I'm going to work then I'm going to dinner at my favorite Mexican restaurant than off to harrahs to put my age into a slot machine.

Well this weekend and due to poor planning on my part I'll be spending saturday at jazz fest with my parents. I'm thinking of not going with them and just staying at home though. :(   My big birthday weekend is not looking so great I don't really have a plan. I have no idea what I'm going to do.   If any one has any ideas about what I should do please respond. I want to do something thats fun and or totally immature and ridiculous.    I must take hold of my youth and leave the daily grind if only for a day to have fun damit.   "If at all you believe in the aging of the soul than you will see my wisdom despite my face." - Randee    It's a time for reflection so I have to choose, give up smoking or go on a diet. I have to smoke again do to the demands of my job and my finals. I got out of bed feeling more like my dad than myself this morning just a little sore all over. I'm dealing though.    I've been tagging again I need more paint I never seem to have enough. If I carried anymore with me I'd sound like one giant can of spray paint. I haven't had a chance to break out my skate board yet but I think about it everyday when I'm downtown and I see all those rails and inclines and mmmmm rails. (Drools)    I need to make more friends. :(    There's a job that I want and I'm crossing my fingers on it come on IRS.   x'o's Randy Mclonely   current mood:  anxious current music: The butchies - trouble

      Tuesday, June 29th, 2004   9:24 pm - My song     Well I'm alive see (spinning around).   I've been busy looking for my next job I have one interview set up  this friday at suno I'd really like to have this job. I'm trying not to think about it and jinx myself. So I played my violin today for a while to get my mind off my troubles.   Yea I got My drum set but I'm still looking for a place to practice and my parents aren't going out of town anytime soon.  I long for change.   I need a vacation badly I don't even feel much like myself anymore you know how it just feels like your life is just going on auto pilot.  I'm infatuated with a woman and I'm so vulnerable I can never tell who it is I don't see her often but when we do get to talk to her I just melt she's just so. (sigh~) I'm thinking of writing her a letter I don't think I could ever talk to her face to face and the e-mailing thing is getting me nowhere the conversations are mostly on a friendly front when she does get a chance to respond. I'm not even sure she's available :( I kinda just want to get turned down so I can move on, write a couple of depressing songs and live quietly out in the middle of nowhere knowing that I tried.  I tried to love. (Sigh)  yes I'm setting myself up for failure I just don't know any better.  I don't see much of anybody these days I'm feeling alone and it's not just a feeling it's my reality.  I'm still looking for a new puter but my job situation has put that on hold.  I saw Fahrenheit /911 it was good and I'm going to see Napoleon dynamite on friday after my interview than off to drink a bit.  Well I have work in the am and I've run out of thing to talk about.  I'm horny  xo's Randy   current mood:  curious current music: isley brothers

       Moo moo moo (therapy)    I don't know my brain is pushing the topic of race relations but I've been suppressing it. Why? I don't know it's just too complicated.   I've been working and shopping for this damn drum set. uuugghhh   I've finally made some hard core decision on it. I have to call guitar center in the morning. My mind is soooooooooooooo  scattered   yes this drum set is a big deal after this comes the car after this car comes "the move". I don't want or need anything else, well I want the van but thats a car all the same.   I'm just so close. I've plan things my whole life and nothing has ever worked out but with every thing running so smoothly you can just knock me over with a feather or possibly a brick with a feather drawn on it.  I feel like a rocket I just took off so fast I broke through the ozone and I feel like I'm just floating in space,it's dark,it's lonely and it's quiet.

      Wednesday, June 9th, 2004 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   10:29 pm - eeepp   I know it's been a while but I've been busy dieting and cramping and just feeling like crap. I'm all better now off the diet for the rest of the week and I'm not all crampy anymore.    I too miss the dyke march meeting. :( I feel so sad  oh yea So saturday I went to bywater barbecue to have dinner. Two out of three is bad and I've learned my lesson about eating there and I'll never do it again. The calzone is not there specialty and should be taken off thier menu. (I just want to point out that raw meat is not one of the ingredients) I work so hard to find a good meal ~sigh.  After that I rode to the country club to have a drink and it was having a private party so I went to the friendly bar instead where I played mega touch and drank rolling rock untill the weeee hours. bleh  I'm learning so much about drums I'm still undecided about what I want. I'm really into my music I swear. Serious this time, I think about it all day I come home with the most righteous rips on my brain. I'm thinking about rigging my room up sunday so I can recored something even if it's only instrumental I mean come on there's something to be said about a person playing all there own instruments. It's going to be a pain in a half but whatever.  I haven't talking to sarah b in a long time. :( what the hell.  My co-workers were talking about love again. I have the ability to mentally block it out as I have nothing to say on the issue. Taking myself off the new orleans market is the best thing for the world. (Hey north carolina ladies angry's on the loose. rreeooww) I keep trying to convince myself that I'm not moving to north carolina to retire. Cody thinks I'm going to get arrested soon as I get there and possibly for something stupid on my part. I don't know but I don't wanna go to jail so I won't be doing anything fun for atleast a month,( yea I know I suck.)  ~sigh  I'm fighting off the urge to make out with my ex-girlfriend. I'll never understand that one thing about some women why do they think sex=love. I don't get it I mean I'll ask a woman out, I want to take it slow get to know her maybe even fall in love just that little bit. All they ever want is sex, "you know it's just sex right"(thats what they say). A couple of weeks into it I have to deal with the "talk" because they now feel close enough to me that they believe we should date.(ick) I've been made to feel like I'm weird for my backwards thinking as many women have squinted and shook their heads at the very idea of waiting for sex. How could I dare try to treat them better than a common sexual object. I'm obviously not up with the times, I guess maybe it is time I retired into my little farm house in the middle of nowhere.

      Wednesday, July 14th, 2004      Life is but a dream unless you have sleep apnea        I um ate a banana split at 8pm last night so I was up all night I read the color purple and ruby fruit jungle I finally went to bed at 4am after I wash all my underwear. :)Tee heeI had a dream it’s a reoccurring dream ….I’m walking through the quarters with my friends and it appears to be Halloween. We were walking down this street and there’s this house party going on and we go in. Only there’s a problem the house is sinking into a hole. We have to get everyone out of the house quickly because the second floor is also falling in on top of us. Most of the people are drunk and are unaware of what’s going on. So I’m rushing around physically putting them out while my friends help. Only someone always gets left behind and I always go back in. Last night it had a different feel to it, I felt like I had more support than normal from my friends as the house collapsed. I still went back in and I woke up feeling just as tired as before. I just woke up with a lot to think about and feeling a bit more sure of my responsibilities. I mean it’s just a meeting I think I can survive it. I’d rather run into sinking house but what can you do.And the woman I adore was also in the dream sitting on a couch drinking and watching me. What a tease……See what my life has come to. bleh &nbsp; Xo’s Randy  &nbsp; current mood: contemplative

      Monday, July 12th, 2004      huh~what~where am I        I became disoriented tonight I don't really know what to say about it. I know I was defeated I know I caved in and I said things I didn't want to say but I live with no regrets ever. I think things are falling apart inside and out. I want to stand firm and I need to stand firm. I need to put on my poker face and call in the cards. I don't know what I’m going to say or do but it's going to be classic ANGRY DYKE I use to piss people off for a living I can do this, I could read people like books. I guess I do have to summon the dark clouds again, light the fire in my belly and spit it right through the hearts of my enemy's. Shrug~ I don't know, I do know I have to get more cigarette’s. &nbsp; &nbsp;I can feel inside and out that I'm slowly transitioning into a different place in my life I'm slowly trying to ease out of autopilot and into something more solid. I didn't like to spend a lot of time alone but now I'm getting use to it even though it makes me all weird.I've been playing my acoustic guitar and my violin.

      Thursday, July 8th, 2004  8:33 pm -   This has taken a toll on me.    I'm a little overwhelmed I've quit smoking a little. I have another interview on tuesday and My last day at work is monday.  I um just don't know sometimes I have to prepare for the dyke march meeting on monday ~sigh I put angry dyke away and it was so hard. I know I should just sit back and say I told you so to all the folks that didn't like the um well angry. I just feel like I can't get up there any more I've tried to set it off and it works for the most part but I have like anger erectile dysfunction I just can't keep that level up. You know where you can feel horns actually spouting from your head sometimes it pays to be mean. Nobody bugs you people think twice before picking fights with you no one ever ask you for anything it's comfortable living.   I guess I'm just not in an angry place right now. :)  (shaking my butt) do do do do   I have a friend who needs help. I have to help and I'm so limited in what I can do. you can only make people do so much and then It's up to them.   you can't save the world but it doesn't me you shouldn't still try.  damn fraggles the doozers just wanna built.  xo's Randy   current mood:  curious

      Tuesday, July 6th, 2004 8:24 pm -   So um yea    Wow so um my sister, my niece and my nephew are staying with us now again.  The house is a little cluttered and I have been feeling the need to move out more and more lately. I always knew moving out meant out of town so my mom is holding on with all her might. The truth is because I get sick alot, I am somewhat dependent on them for my meds. I just don't have the income to cover the trip and the meds.  I must deal with the fact that I have to play a little catch up when it comes to life. It sucks a lot I wish could just go sometimes just take like a couple hundred dollars and hop a train and have fun.   NNNoooo I gotta run to the next job scrape together nickles and dimes to see if I can find a car,van,truck uh moped that I can afford.  sigh~  I don't know why I dwell on this but it's hard not to. I don't know I just don't feel very free.  I've been thinking about my movie project I've always wanted to make one I thought I would be doing it about my move from new orleans to durham but now I just feel like it should be more. I thought about doing it on the black churches in new orleans but I thought about how much money changes hands in those churches and the murder rate and I had a change of heart and to be honest this is not a very activisty town. (is that a word I'm not sure)   I haven't heard a word from cheryl since before the war on "terror". ~shrug~ I'm running out of ways to deal with it.  My temp job ends in 3 days, I'll be unemployed again.~shrug~ What can I say I need a break.  I can't wait to be able to take a mid week bike ride at 7am for coffee,McDonald's breakfast,playing my guitar at the river and early afternoon beer with misha. damn I actually have pretty cool things to look forward to.  yyeeeeeeeeaaaaaaa for me. I lost five pounds this week thank you frosted mini wheats and burger king. I know what the fuck right I actually went on a diet and I lost 2 pounds. I get all depressed sleep all day and eat burger king I lose five pounds.   I'm weird tee hee................  I wanna go to coney island too. :( damn right I'm j  xo's Randy   current mood:  confused current music: my super loud family

      Sunday, July 4th, 2004   6:17 pm -   My weekend    I'm A 1990s Geek  Cool, confident, and very powerful, you're the sexiest geek ever! Buckle in, your decade is one hell of a ride.  find your geek decade at spacefem.com     Well friday was a rough day I left work early to go to an interview with a very crappy man.   Then I went into the quarter to deposit my pay check that arrived three days late I get to the atm just before my movie was suppose to start only with my luck I didn't have a pen to fill out my deposit envelope. :)  So I head over to the movie (Napoleon dynamite) it was pretty good started off kinda slow but it was a good movie all around.   After the movie I was stuck in the most awful essence traffic that resulted in me flying off my bike. I did learn something about myself though I have cat like reflexes as I flew off face first and ended up on my back sitting upright. My bike didn't quiet make it out as good as I did my bars are broken I just need new bike all around. I barely made it to the matrixxx for the drag show I almost didn't go but I was pretty bruised up and I needed cigarettes and beer. mmmmm   I got there super early after two beers my friends showed up and the show began. The night ended as quickly as it began and I was past ready for the day to end.  Saturday I got up early with my parents for the first time in a long time to go garage sale hunting I did score a copy of the complete works of William Shakespeare for 2$ it's about a thousand or so pages and looks brand new. I spent the rest of the day sleeping and playing my violin. I've been spending more time playing my violin than anything else lately.  Today I cramp there for I am so I've been in bed all day reading. I don't know what I'll do tomorrow but it has to be fun...   xo's Randy   current mood:  nerdy

      Wednesday, August 4th, 2004  8:23 pm - Team Dresch-N- stuff  Hi! I was wondering if anyone is going to the Team Dresch Reunion show in Olympia? If so, and you have a camcorder, I need to talk to you...badly.  I am also waging a war there is no way in hell I can get to Olympia I would be willing to pay a nice price not too high for a tape of this show.  ::Remember:: Don't be hoe get me a tape of the show.  Thank you  Okay well I guess have to update, I did in fact open this window. I got a job at LSU as a supply clerk I don't know the specifics yet so I'll have to get back to you guys on that but I am employed. :) tee hee  I ate too much today, sushi is good too much is bad. yeay sushi (insert sick face here)  I'm trying to enjoy my last couple of days of daytime freedom before I commit myself to the working world. yeay me :)  I plan to eventually patch things up with Maria I'm always so emotional because of my whoremones (I spelled it right) it basically got me into this in the first place and I do feel bad about what happen sick people can be such bitches I know because I'm one of them.  I saw dylan on his scooter today he looks so cool. I still want a car. :)  I'm half way through the exorcist and I'm totally into my hebrew. I've been having dreams with a lot of kewl jewish tattoos and some of my friends in them and it all takes place in a kosher bar but I don't know that at first so I'm just saying it's weird and I still don't like margaritas.  whoa did that make sense.  Anyhoo I'm waiting on a letter from school about my financial aid so I can um spend it and go to school too.  Well um night  Xo's Randy  current mood: exhaustedcurrent  music: I wanna read !!!

      Sunday, August 1st, 2004  9:18 pm - I ate it :)  Well um I've been busy lately I had like two job interviews and I've been a little under the weather. I have to make another doctors appointment with any luck I won't keep it because I hope to have insurance by then. ~sigh I should be feeling better tomorrow...Bah this woman I have been trying to dodge "found" my phone number again. Okay I have a valid question how do you tell someone you are not interested? In a nice way I mean she's been after me for over four years can you imagine trying to go out with someone for four years hell I forgot I had a crush on bob from Michigan last year. Now that I remember damn I want a piece of bob...mmm sweet sweet bob drool oh um okay anyhoo I'm going to spend most of next week inside waiting for my brother to show up so I can beg him for money and I will also be waiting for the gateway cd I sharked off of Ebay to come. Tee hee it felt good I tell you what.If I can fix my puter it will defiantly be a boost I've been totally into my hardware lately (too much American choppers) I've always wanted a motorcycle and that show inspired me to build it once I get settled in my age maybe in my late 30's.I'm in an odd place I don't know what to do with my spare time. I've been garage selling with my parents again I got my first piece of luggage, the exorcist(the book)and some glasses so thick no one could see out of them how fun. :)  So I guess I'm going to read my new book ah if you love me send me a book.  Thinking..... .... ..... .....  I wonder if bob's single....... ???  sigh~Xo's Randy  current mood: busy  current music: My heart being horny for love
