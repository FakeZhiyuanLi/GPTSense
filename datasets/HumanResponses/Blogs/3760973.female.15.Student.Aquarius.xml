      Yeah. Listening to NoFX. XD Love it man, love it.  Leave It Alone, is the name of the song.   The Bell Song from Lakm√© was on before that. XD I have such a fucking strange playlist. Opera and then punky-rock. And up after this and Perfect Government (another NoFX song) is Barbossa is Hungry (Klaus Badelt, from PoTC). And then He's A Pirate and Fog Bound, two more Klaus Badelt. And then Vesti La Guibba. From Pagliacci.  Yeah, I have a lot of different tastes. Fun stuff, it is.  I figured I should update my blog. I did a lot of template editing yesterday, and then gave up and put it back to the way it originally was, man. Cause I'm weird.   But anyway.   Just been thinking a lot about life and stuff lately.   Like, what's the purpose?   I'm sure every teen goes through this at one point.  But also, I think I'm going fucking insane. Like, I think too deeply about some things. I've been finding myself spelling words correctly and then looking at them and thinking they're incorrect, even ones that I've known since, like, first grade. I've always been a good speller. And now, it takes me two minutes to spell purpose. I was like... purpous *backspace backspace* purpus? No... *backspace backspace* And eventually I got purpose. Yay.  And musical pitches. I think I'm going nuts and having trouble, like, distinguishing between them.  Anyway.   I'm so fucking SICK of Michael Moore. Everybody's been praising him how good his movie is. I've only seen the previews and I can tell you this:  It's fucking edited and clipped to -only- show what he wants people to see. That's why I'm not going to see it. Or maybe I should, just to see how much bullshit it really is.  Grah. He pisses me off. I watch things like the Oscars to get away from stuff like politics. And he has to bring it up. If I wanted something fucking political, I'd go turn on CNN or something.   Damn you, Michael Moore. People wonder why I'm freaking nuts around political stuff.   NEWSFLASH: IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU, YOU DUMBASS, MOORE.  GOING//FUCKING CRAZY  Alias: Elle//fin.

      Ahah. Yes. Opera camp todayyyy. Blergh, I was sick this morning cause Mom gave me a perscription antacid. But I had really bad heartburn and the doctor said it was okay when we called her. But now I find I am allergic to Zantac, which is good to know.   Anyway.   Yeah, we have solo auditions for the Showcase at the end of the summer tomorrow. At least, for the Giovenette peice, the Peasant Song. I'm trying out for Zerlina's solo. Cause it's fun. But I won't be picked. Cause my voice sucks.   It does, too.  You know, I look at all these teenagers that have extraordinairy shit happen to them. Like Charlie. Charlie was blessed with a good voice.   I wasn't, damnit.   And even if I was, my stupid choir teacher refuses to give solos because they're 'unfair'.   Anyway. And then there's people who get famous just for their looks, no talent.   Britney Spears, being an example.  Yeah. My mum isn't helping, either. I keep trying to get realized or something, see if I do have any talent. But she's like 'lose fifty pounds and I'll get you an agent' and I'm like 'WTF!?! You don't even want to get me a gym membership and now you want me to lose fifty pounds?'  My mother is stuuuupid.   So yeah.  I see all these extraordinairy things happen to people. Like Hillary Duff, like Charlotte Church, like JoJo, people like that.  And I'm like, WTF?! I'm not supposed to be stuck in a fucking small town that's not even on the map! I'm supposed to be out there, with the world!  I'm supposed to be extraordinairy! Idolized!  -Special-!  But no, damnit. The world looks at me and tells me I'm not good enough.  Never have been. Always have been at the very most second best at everything.   -Everything-.  Damnit.  Anyway.   Whee, conversation.   Puck Eats You: *prod* Faerieblue Satu: ::is prodded:: Puck Eats You: Hio Faerieblue Satu: hoi. Faerieblue Satu: . . . no. Faerieblue Satu: hi. xD Puck Eats You: How are oyu? Puck Eats You: 00; You* Faerieblue Satu: I is okay. Faerieblue Satu: xD Faerieblue Satu: ::works her powers of confusion on Elle:: Puck Eats You: Typos galore. XD *uses magical art of hormones on Eri* Faerieblue Satu: Eri. . . that seems so weird to me. xD Faerieblue Satu: and what the fuck are you doing to my hormones!? Puck Eats You: XD You'll never know! BWAHAHHA! Puck Eats You: I might just blog this. XD Faerieblue Satu: xD Puck Eats You: Who is Sparkle, out of curiosity? Faerieblue Satu: my fish. Puck Eats You: Dude- I need you and your skills to make my blog look cool. Because it's boring and default and I have NO HTML skizzles. Aww, I'm sorry. Faerieblue Satu: xD mine is actually just an ancient blogger template. Puck Eats You: ... I need to smack you. Faerieblue Satu: ^.^ Puck Eats You: Do you know anyone with HTML skills? Faerieblue Satu: um, not really. Puck Eats You: ..DAMN YOU! *shakes fist*  PISSED//RAGING  Alias: Elle//fin.

      Okay, so I'm not listening to any music, technically. But I keep humming/singing/hearing in my head He's a Pirate from Klaus Badelt.  Good stuff, it is. XD   I took a quiz once about Jack Sparrow. It was, like, which one of his speeches are you?   I got 'You have got to get yourself a girl, mate. ...Your not an eunuch, are you?' Much to my amusement. Appearently I'm horny and I think everyone else is that way, or should be.  Go figure, eh? XD  Anyway, much love for Erin's new RP character. Yay Nariko! He's staticky. Like Ellen.   Oh, and a random quote from Raphie:  "Let me go, and give me back my damn testosterone!"  Ahah. I also love Puck's control over hormones, damnit.     ... if you're not me or haven't RPed with me, ignore that entire last section.  Charlie, I love your haiku. And you're right, all haikus must involve cherry blossoms. XD    Much to my own amusement, I actually logged onto Blogger for the sake of just Blogging... something. I didn't care what, really. I felt like updating you all on my life. My boring life, but my life nonetheless.   Got into an argument with mum this morning, over the computer.   Hmph. No chocolate covered strawberries for her today. I was going to make them, too.  Ha.   So there.  I have discovered something about myself recently, actually.  I tend to be irritating when I angst. Like, I'll snap at people. Or just wallow in self pity. Anway.      Alias: Elle//fin.

      Ahah. Okay. I got pissed at Livejournal for going down the other day at the most mother-trucking inconvenient time- I was angsting, damnit. And I needed to rave about angsty stuffs. But LJ decides not to freaking work.   So, later, after my angsting was done, I was reading my friend Erin's blog. 'cause, you know, I love her.   Anyway.  I was like, WTF? That's so cool, it's not all, like... standardized like Livejournal.   But maybe it is and I've just been around Livejournal and Deadjournal too damn long.   So anyway, here I am. With a blog. Whoo.   Enough with the shameless plugging of Blogspot.   On to the strangeness of what I'm listening to.   Okay, so I'm on the Hal Leonard website, listening to stuff so I can arrange it for our corps. And I click on one thing that has something from Drumline, intrigued.  As I listen, I am fucking floored. In a bad way.  How stupid can Hal Leonard (and whoever wrote/arranged this damn peice) to put singing in for band members?  Not just regular singing, either. Singing in parts. On pitches.  It's what makes the whole song.   ... Hal Leonard's stupid, damnit.   Band people can't sing.   But can singing people band?  Yeah. Also- the name of this blog emerges from a conversation I had with my now-friend Charles and friend Megan yesterday.   We were in Graphic Design, aka Set design, and we were supposed to have specific measurements for the stage dimensions on our drawing, all on quarter-inch scale.   My lines wouldn't come out straight.  So Megan pipes up randomly, watching me fumble with the lack of straightness of my lines. "Are you gay?"   And I was like... "I don't think so."   Charles (No relation to you, sorry Charlie. But I still love you, damnit!) spoke up next.   "...I'm sorry. You must be in the wrong place. We're theater people- gay is in the job description."  Quite a funny conversation, considering Charles is straight as anything.   And then we started talking about "Harry Potter- the Opera" and what we would make up for operas if we could.

      Ever had one of those things where you feel like you can do nothing right and you have no idea why you feel that way?  Yeah. Today was sorta one of those days.  I mean it wasn't 'til a little while ago.  I just... feel like crapsticks right now, man. Like I can't do anything right, that I'm never going to be anything important.  Sort of like the opposite of those 'fuck you, god/diety' moments. Sorta.   I'm still like 'fuck you', but in more of a 'fuck off and leave me the hell alone' kinda way.  Maybe it's because I was the only person who cried at the end of Traviatta today. >   WHAAAT THE FUCKKKKK!  And now I'm listening to the Grand Gate of Kiev, which -always- makes me feel better.   And it's not working.   I'm still fucking -crying- my eyes out, damn it to all hell.  AGHRHGHSJKLHSDFK!    WHY do I feel like I can do nothing right lately?    I'm: DEPRESED//andconfused.  Alias: ELLE//fin.

      ^ Title is an excerpt from last weeks Gibberish Day in acting class. XD Highly amusing.  Anyway. I should archive what we do in acting class because some if it's just freakin' funny.   Okay. Lemme see if I can get this crap straight:   Week One:  First day, we just did some acting theory, like acting from the inside out and expressing ourselves without words. Then we did Space Stuff, which was basically imaginary objects- with details. Like: It's not just a balloon. It's a bright red balloon filled with helium, etc. etc. Because generality is the enemy of acting, pretty much. And we came up with the idea (since everyone was always saying it) to do an improv on Shut up, Charles. The third day we did an exercise with adding people to scenes without  speaking. We did one major scene. Okay, so here's how it went.    Natalie: *at an ice cream place, scooping ice cream* Me: *comes up as a little child and buys some ice cream, slurping loudly* Karrah: *joins me as a child*  Daniel: *a cop, sits reading a newspaper, before getting up and getting some ice cream* Karrah and I: *switch ice cream cones to taste the other's before going and bothering Cop!Dan*  Dan: *refuses to taste our ice cream cone and shoves Karrah*  Cassie and Sam: *get some ice cream as a couple* Karrah: *gets ice cream on her shirt, needs a napkin* Charles: *comes in as a mailman with a package, knocks me over and I lose my ice cream cone so Karrah gives me hers* Meghan: *bursts in and starts robbing the ice cream store*  Charles: *flings a box at Meg and gets shot*  Me: *tackles Meg and gets shot* Cassie, Sam, Karrah, Kira: *hide in the back, call the cops* Dan: *tries to stop the robbery, gets shot*  Natalie: *gives the Meg some ice cream* Me and Charles: *come back as Zombies and chase the robber around*   And scene. XDDD   Week 2:  Oh, wow. Uh. Yeah! I remember now. That Monday we did expressing ourselves with our backs and Hands and Feet.  Wednesday: Gibberish day! We all spoke in Gibberish, translating only by body and inflection. We had several scenes.   GROUP 1 Rachel: Madama Zlowskyie, a national dance team leader. Kira: Her translator  GROUP 2 Daniel: A famous chef from Lintoneania, showing us how to make 'Special Hot Ice Cream Baked Mixture' ((Ingredients: Ice cream, apples, milk, strawberries, whipped cream, chili peppers)) Karrah: His translator ((A classic line from that scene: Q: "You chopped up the apples, but you didn't add them. Do you add them after it's baked?" A: *translated from Lintoneanese* I did add the apples! I'm just too fast for you to see!"))  GROUP 3 Lily: Leader of the Mirkionian Desert Bobsled Team (with Jack, her imaginairy friend) Meghan: Her translator ((Another classic quote. *translated* "We're a desert bobsled team, yes. But we're not worried about those stupid Jamaicans. All that pot, you know, just goes to their heads. Our team smokes opium. It's much better.))  GROUP 4/5 A scene from a Tonienitik Film, winner of the Rochinki Award, Dubbed. Just before the famous steamy sex scene. This scene is where the main characters realize they are meant for each other. XD Me: Lorena, a cellist who is engaged to... not Kikiu. Sam: My translator Charles: Kikiu, falls in love with Lorena.  Julianne: His translator.  ((AHAH! This is where the 'Fwaht!?' Comes from. Charles's gibberish for 'What'?))  And then Friday, we did: Who, what, where. We had several partners, all with the same what and where, just different who's.   Group 1: in a shoe Karrah: Adolescent boy, climbing a tree Sam: Jackie Chan  Group 2: At a football game Natalie: A shoelace, popping pills Kira: A peach ((A few well placed puns with her!   Group 3: On a subway Lily: A pirate, trying to sleep. (("Argggh. My cousin Hook would know what to do, eh Polly?")) Dan: A frenchman. ((All he got out before the scene ended was "Bonjour, madame.")) ((This also spawned Lily's final line: "Arrrgh. I hate frenchmen."))  Group 4: In a swimming pool Cassie: A loaf of bread, choking. Meghan: Don Giovanni! (the greatest womanizer/lover of all time) ((XD This spawned "What are you doing -here-, you sweet, soggy peice of toast, you?"   Group 5: At a strip club Me: A sock, being executed Julianne: Santa Claus (("OH-ho-ho! That ain't no Missus Claus!" and then my "Oooh! No! Don't take the stockings OFF!"))   WEEK 3:   Monday was a hard lesson, doing text and subtext. I made someone cry in a scene by saying 'I hate you'. O.O It was really freaky, when it's done right, it's like someone's punched you in the stomach.  Anyway. TODAY! Today was Objective Day. XD We all had to get our objectives across without directly saying it. My objective was to get my toes sucked on. XD   Anyway, the only one I really remember was mine with Rachel's. ((Rachel was trying to get me to recite poetry.))   Me: So how was your day? Rachel: Good, good. I walked around the park, hearing the lovers say beautiful things to each other, with my coffee...  Me: Ah, coffee. That would explain why your teeth are yellow. Rachel: Oh dear. They are? I need to go brush my teeth... Me: Well, you know, my toes have built in toothbrushes...  That was just an excerpt. But yeah. XDDDDD  I love acting class. There are so many other amusing things that happen, just ask me about them sometime.  I'm:FREAKIN//amused.  Alias:ELLE//fin.

      EDIT: Okay. I say this once, and only once.  I confronted Maestro. He said he was sorry for the misundertanding, but he was talking about the adult opera company, of which my two voice teachers are members.  I listened to her yesterday, and Dolores has a -really- good voice. Most likely, they knew that and weren't judging just on the audition day.   I was wrong.   And I did get a solo, in a different song.   So I'm sorry, but I made a mistake.   I'm keeping the rest of this below just to state my ambition.  EDIT 2: PUBLISH, DAMN YOU! _________________________________________________  Maybe this is the fate's way of telling me I'm meant to be something like an accountant or a banker or work at McDonalds. That my love of music is nothing but that:  An untalented love.  Someday, I want to be famous. I want to be a face that people know, that people recognize. I don't want what happened to my mother to happen to me.  My mother was a prima ballerina in her teenage dance company and a Rockette, who went to the school in NY for professional children through all of high school, and then she kept getting turned down from dance companies because of racial quotas (this was at the height of affirmative action time, in the seventies).   So my mom, being put down every time, pushed herself as hard as she could, trying to become so good that the dance companies -couldn't- refuse her.  And then she got hurt during a fucking audition- busted her knee. The dance company thought she was amazing and was going to put her in a lead role, but she had to get surgery on her knee, thus ending her dance career.  I think God or whatever diety is trying to tell us that the O'Connells are not meant for fame.  You know what, God/Diety?  FUCK YOU.  I'm gonna be famous. I don't care what you do- I'm gonna go on to do something with music and you're not going to fucking stop me. I'm going to be adored. I'm going to be extraordinairy. I'm going to be amazing somehow.   How's that for you?  You want to stop me? Smote me. I'm not going to give up until I mother-fucking get to the top of the ladder.  And then I'm going to pay all my mom's medical bills. And buy my daddy a boat like he's always wanted. And give mom the money to start up her own dance studio.  And start my own school-  My own school for students that were like me.   That are outcasts from the 'popular' crowd. That are artists, that express themselves.   The ones that feel like they have nowhere to turn, that they're always going to be second-best.  No. They won't be second best. They won't fucking go through what I go through now.   I won't let them.  DEPRESSED//FUCKINGPISSED  Alias: Elle//fin.
