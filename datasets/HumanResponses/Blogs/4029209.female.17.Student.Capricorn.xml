      As results day fast approaches, i thought it would be a good idea we tried to work how we're gonna celebrate. I mean obviously we're gonna, do the usual, get drunk and thank god for resits, but where we gonna&nbsp;drink? what time? how much? lol. Any suggestions, feel free to post. It'd be good to do something different this year, since next year we'll all be leaving each other :(. So, all suggestions welcome.  On a different note, anyone know how we're supposed to enrole again? i forgot to listen to that bit, damn those 3 hour history lessons, thanks Gem for keep me awake ;).  Well, thats all for now. Least theres something to think about :).

      For those of you who don't know, i'm taking my driving test soon. August the 31st. It was earlier but i had to move it back because i wasn't as good i thought i was (i know - i'm shocked too :P).   If i pass, i hope to buy a car soon afterwards. Buying the car, isnt the problem, it's the insurance. Have you seen how much it costs for a 17 year old girl?? its outrageous! i've had quotes starting from £1,000 all the way up to £2,500!!. I mean whos gonna pay that much?.  Apparently the reason its so high is because of out 'age group' when really its cos male charvs drive their cars so fast, they crash making insurance companies but the premiums sky-high. This is really unfair, cos i know loads of women drives (most of my mates) who are brilliant drivers and are never likely to crash.  But i guess till we grow older theres nothing we can do except pay out, i guess if we ever crash we'll be glad of it lol.&nbsp;Anyway, thats my rant for today. Thought i'd write it down since i've spent most of the morning being told i'm an 'undesirable candidate for insurance' lol.  Write soon :)

      Hey everyone :). This is my first attempt at ever writing publically lol. So if it's a disaster, we'll blame that.   I've decided to create a blog, partly cos of the fact everyone else in, (yeah i'm a sheep :( - so sue me) but also&nbsp;because i like the idea of writing down what's going on. With things changing so quickly right now, it seems a good idea.   So, here i go :P. I hope everyone enjoys reading this, if only just to laugh at my life lol.   Bye for now :)

      I thought i'd dedicate a blog to my crazy mate Gemma, who seems to have lost the plot, bless her. But as her friend, i am fully supporting to her decision to become a pirate.  So, i have made an effort to ensure i greet her properly, when talking to her 'oo argh!' and call her random things like 'matey'. I think it's important to support our friends, whenever they turn slightly insane, or just decide to have a change, so that we let them know they're not alone. Oo arghh!.  Oo arrgh! one day left :/...

      Hehe, as you can guess i'm trying to be witty...and failing lol. Had my hair all chopped off today, its not as bad as it sounds. It looks gorgeous and it's straight! for once. It'll last about 3 days looking nice, till i decide it's too high maintance and give up :P.  Am still off work, and tis no fun. I miss it, which is why i know i'm ill lol, AHHHHHHHH!! 2 days till results :/.  Not much to write about, My best mate has gone and left again to go on holiday, but she's back in a week so thats not so bad :P.  Oh and by the time i write my next blog, i'll have whooped gemma's ass at yahoo pool! haha go me :).

      I thought i'd write, since i'm off work due to being ill :( nothing major, just feeling sick blah blah etc. Least it'll mean i get to rest for a bit.  Works ok at the moment actually. My manager left, and i thought i'd have to be split up into a different team, but they've brought some else in to sit in while they look for a replacement. Not sure how long i'll be there for, but i know i'll be sad to leave.  Hmm chicken noodle soup...forced myself to have some, cos apparently 'it cures everything', tho i need convincing :/ it just tastes yucky and i'm not a huge fan of noodles anyway, they remind me of thin long worms :P.  1 week till results day :/ seems to be getting closer so fast. Good luck to everyone :) no matter what happens, we'll have a good time anyway :P.  Think i'm gonna be boring and lie down for a bit, but that'll last 5 minutes and i'll prolly end up going out and making myself feel worse lol.  Happy Thursday :P. Yes, i am crazy...

      Whats the deal with Sundays? they always seem to be crap, no matter what you're doing. It's like why do i even bother getting out of bed, because i know how the day is going to turn out.  I reckon they should replace Sunday with another Friday, then at least i'd get some enjoyment out of the day, instead of being stuck doing boring things. Then to top it off, its not like you can even watch decent T.V. on sunday! our cable is broke so i'm stuck with 5 channels, and i'd forgotten how bad telly is on sundays.  Anyway, its nearly monday, which means 5 days of work and no breaks. I'm trying to think of sometime happy to end with, cos don't wanna just moan (yes thats right, i have matured...a bit). So.....yeah i've found one good thing that we'd be lost without on a sunday, sunday dinner! the only time in the week i get to eat a meal which isn't at 10pm (cos thats when i get in from work). So there you go.  I know i didn't make sense today, but it's a sunday :/ gonna stop saying that word...  Love Laura xx
