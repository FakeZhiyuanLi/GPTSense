      This poem is dedicated to Victoria Rose Anderson You will be missed! Also this poem is dedicated for Troy Daniel Anderson She'll never leave you.  Guardian Angel Looking down from her post Sees a young child Forgotten by most This child lies lonley In his cool,dark bed Crying his tears And hanging his head. This child is hated and beaten at night by his drunken father, In his rage,and might An angel watches  Over this child in need. For him she sees  a sparkling seed so when this child is hurting there This guardian angel watches over with care.

      a girl sheds silent tears  crying so soft that nobody can hear this pain is eating away at her heart on the outside she looks strong and bold but inside its a nerves mixed up train wreck. screamin for somebody to come to her rescue  patiently waiting but then she realizes that she is alone wanting a easy way out of all this pain and misery to feel as she once did. to see the warm familar faces. but inside this girl knows that nobody will come and that this long battle is yet to be won.         diana

      im stuck standing still doing nothang  but watching all the things i loved revolve around me starting to spin slowly then without a warning i spin faster then ever then i fall  head first into a concrete wall left unconcious all alone without a care in the world open my cold and swollen eyes finding that my body is torn in pieces and here i was alone nobody to break my fall nobody that cares at all finding the strength to get up like a wounded soldier with determination to finsh the task at hand slowly putting the pieces of my heart where they belonged  diana
