      Dearest,  Today, I did it! I’m glad I did it. Though I feel a lil sad, I know its not good. Thank you for nudging me, I felt it. And really thanks for that, my dearest. It’s all gone now. I wont go back to them. I can’t anyway. Now my objective is to warn my friends it ain’t good either.  I’m sorry though, I held back at first, hesitating a lot, but I finally got the guts to do it and its done! Sorry I even kept some of it first, not wanting to get rid of sin. They say sin is pleasurable. In an earthly kinda pleasure I would guess, yeah I do agree. But Dearenst, I do not want anymore of these pleasures. I want the true thing. Like you once said, if I cant be trusted with unreal stuff, what more real stuff rite?  Dearest, help me become a better person. I have one more week to rally. I know you can work miracles.  I feel I’m not humble enough. How do I humble down my heart? Its too arrogant and cocky now. Lord, help me. Ok, maybe for starters, I shall call you Lord instead of Dearest, but then, its different aspects of you anyway, not disrespecting or anything.  Lord, thank you for making me the person I am today. I’m not sure that what you wanted to become of me has become, cos of me myself mainly, but Lord please try. Spank me, whip me, lecture me when I’m naughty. Whisper Your sweet words so that I’ll have to quieten down and listen. I wanna hear You everyday. Haven’t been hearing lately. They say You’re not silent, just we’re not listening. Help me to listen.  Do nudge me more often, when You know I need it. Thanks for everything though, Resurrection Sunday just a week ago, I seem to have forgotten it already.  Well Father, today I wanna ask You that You’ll one day save my friends Fiona, Esther and Trishal. Lord, Freedom Rally is this Saturday and today is Sunday and they all 3 don’t want to come. Lord, change their hearts Lord, put something in their hearts, help em realize that coming for this Rally could change their lives. Lord, I would not know their motives in their hearts if they agree to come, but I trust You’ll do the work in their hearts. Work their hearts. Lord, these 3 people are people I have come to know very well this past few years and I love them very much Lord. I want them to go where they’re MEANT to go Lord.  I remember gorgor once said that if we prayed the same thing too much, being chiong hey and all, You might get irritated. He said we gotta have some extend of faith where we can leave the matter and trust You’ll grant us our prayer. But remember the parable in Luke, you spoke of this widow who kept pestering this judge for justice everyday that he got so fed up of her he granted her justice just because she kept pestering him? Well, I wouldn’t want you to answer my prayer because I’m irritating but because I know You love them just as much as You love me and everyone else. Well, I’ll pray fervently, not pesteringly. Thank you Lord.  Love, M-R 18Apr2004 2207 hours

      the past few days have been havoc. HAVOC. ok let me see, Monday morning- i woke up late, barely had time to bathe and dress. then all the projects have been piling up and more homework is on the way. Tuesday- i missed the van altogether. i came down, waited for 10 mins and was wondering why my neighbours who took the same van werent outside waiting. doh'. then i realized i had missed it. doh' doh' doh'. the reason why i was late and didnt realize was becos i usually set my bedroom clock a lil faster. but that day, my mom set it back to normal time, she didnt know. and so tada, the van driver left without me, thinking i wasnt going to school. Today, was Wednesday, i did the probably dumbest thing of my life ever.  You see, since i missed the van yesterday, decided not to take any chances and so i set the clock early. when i woke up, realized i was nearly late AGAIN, rushed to washup and bathe.. rushed down the stairs and waited for the bus. this time i was very sure i didnt miss it.. but after waiting 20 mins, the van still had not arrived! and my neighbours were still not in sight. Doh'. i had missed it AGAIN??   so we got into the car and my mom started the engine, and LO AND BEHOLD, the car clock said 5.50 AM! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I had gotten up 1 hour early and i didnt even realize it. ohmygoodness, i feel so stupid and dumb and daft and blunt and idiotic.   well, thats the mornings of mary-ruth, recounted for you.  i bet you dont want to know what goes on in the afternoons and evenings. so, later.  cheers, m-r 21.47 hours, 14 April 2004

      Beautiful, Scandalous Night   Easter is this Sunday. This Sunday, that’s less than a week’s time. Doh’.  I don’t feel prepared for it yet. Not enough time to pray, reflect dadada… Yeah that’s my problem - procrastination.  I watched The Passion of Christ last Friday. Yeah it was probably then that it dawned on me that Easter is just around the corner. Man, that show was………..phew. I don’t know how to put it, but it was hard watching it. The PASSION of Christ I guess, that’s why its called. I’ve been learning the stories behind a few words lately. You know ‘passion’, when you say it, usually the first thing that comes to mind (for me lah) like some romantic passionate relationship kinda soppy yada yada. Hey, don’t get me wrong, I’m not some pervert. But really that used to be the first thought that entered my mind when I heard ‘passion’. I looked up my dictionary and The Passion is ‘the sufferings of Christ Jesus in His last days. Even passion-flower is ‘plant with flower supposed to suggest instruments of Crucifixion. PASSION man.  I cried a lot throughout the movie. I’m not someone who usually sheds tears while watching movies, but this was different though. I guess cos’ I never thought very deeply about what kinda pain, how much pain, emotional and physical Jesus went through. Yes, we do read that the Romans flogged Him and pressed a crown of thorns on His head, nailed his hands and feet dadada..  But I never really thought about it, you know. Like pictured it in my head that sorta thing. I guess the pain was so intense I could never picture something as gruesome as that anyway. But the movie did it.  Anyways, yeah that got me thinking. Easter is coming. What am I gonna do on that day? Will my heart be the same? Or should it be more grateful than other days? … Well, No. If I should be MORE grateful on Easter than on other days, I am in very very deep trouble. Cos’ it means that on other days I am less grateful of Jesus dying on the cross. But of course, Easter serves as a day we set aside for remembrance of His resurrection. That we can SHOUT and say YAHOO, He did it!  Let me remind myself though, Good Friday comes before Easter. You gonna shout and dance on Good Friday? Well, I don’t usually dance, not a dancer but anyways I think I’ll be reflecting on everything. What Christ went thru, why He went thru it, and what I should yadayada do.  Here’s a song by SmallTown Poets bout Good Friday and Easter. Written by Steve Hindalong.   Go on up to the mountain of mercy To the crimson perpetual tide Kneel down on the shore Be thirsty no more Go under and be purified  Follow Christ to the holy mountain Sinner sorry and wrecked by the fall Cleanse your heart and your soul In the fountain that flowed For you and for me and for all At the wonderful, tragic, mysterious tree On that beautiful scandalous night you and me Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white’ On that beautiful scandalous night  On the hillside, you will be delivered At the foot of the cross justified And your spirit restored By the river that poured From our blessed Saviour’s side

      These few days I have been in emotional shock. Mainly from what my friends have been going through and how it effects me. And my dad hasn't been feeling very well lately. I mean, yeah sure, his sickness maybe be chronic but it does have its ups and downs. And when it gets down too long, I am very sure he has trouble just keeping his patience. It gets sad and gloomy around the house when his giddy spells are real bad. He does try to keep a cheerful face so that we won't worry so much. So when he complains about being stuck up in the house and not being able to do work, you know its really really really bad. To tell you the truth, I can't help but admire how he manages to keep his sanity when the going gets tough. And I am very sure how he does it is by keeping in touch with the master. Sometimes I wonder what if I were to be put in his shoes, man, I probably would have given up halfway. Or quarter way for that fact. But also I suppose he has my mom for support. They'd been pledged together in Holy Matrimony for 25 years this year. And I have come to observe that the giddy spells have been taking its toll on mom too. Not that she gets them, but because dad gets them and thus lots of dissapointments arise. I suppose after a while, life becomes so stale and when they are so many dissapointments, even if they are like small things? I don't know. I don't think its good either, allowing life to become stale with the little hills of dissapointments around you. Sometimes though, when the spells stop coming for a while, everyone will be happy and cheerful and bright. And then the house plunges again, into semi-darkness. I for one thing, am grateful because I have my computer, handphone, housephone to keep in contact with friends and all, to sorta avoid the gloom which has set in. That sounds so selfish, and it is. Ok, I must quit that mindset. But yeah, I do TRY to get mom out of the house for some fellowship with church members once in a while. It seems they spend too much time with themselves. I'm glad my bro will be coming back next week. It'll cheer up the place a lil bit. :) And then another thing on my mind, one of my close friend, she got sick becos of too much stress and pressure. And GOODNESS me, its only the midterms... imagine the real PMR, she'll probably dunno do what....  :S  Right now prayers are focused on Dad, Esther, Jon's Steph, Jon, Grace and Ivan, Gladys, Gorgor, Mom, Su Li, and exams.

      Does it always just vanish in smoke?  A loud poof, and all is gone The most desperate hand grip Can only hold for so long Sooner or later the only you can do Is watch yourself failing, falling Down and down and down to the stage below You see your lifeless body sprawled on the ground While all the world gushes shock and oozes sympathy You had the world counting on you With the ability of Clark Kent Your chest puffed up with the fearlessness of evil Is now deflated, representing surrender Your two feet once clinged firmly to the earth But now they lie cold and numc Why? How? You'd never imagine Inviscibility crumbled over the months Strange as it seems, it might indeed just be gone But beyond hope perhaps not I do not know, for these things are beyond anyone's knowledge But one thing possible: A fallen superman can shape a better one

      Hmm.. i can just tell this is gonna be a very troubled and weird and puzzling post which will evoke some thinking. so dont say i didnt warn you.    Dearest Dearest,  I'm listening to the Heart of Worship by Matt Redman now.  "WHen the music fades, all is stripped away and i simply come longing just to bring something thats of worth.."  Thats what we, or i, always sing, or sometimes even plead, perhaps?..when i sing it. BUt really, do i really simple come when the music fades?  DUring youth today, the keyboards, guitars and drums were wonderful. You know, it FELT so good just standing there, listening to the song, singing it and praising God. or so i think, or thought. Everybody around me was so in to it, you could see from their body language, the frown of concerntration on their faces ever so intense as they sang 'mould me, shape me, Lord.' I have to confess, yeah i was looking around, cos somehow i felt i had not been a really well-behaved child the past week and so there fore unworthy to sing mould me, shape me songs. mmhmm, i only sing and promise mould me shape me songs when i've been good. eh, i dunno la. Anyways, i observed the song leader, the OHP fella, friend next to me, the hands a few persons away and so on... the music was wonderful, trust me, the intense sincerity on ppls faces were encouraging indeed. but through out the whole thing i wondered, or probably more like doubted.. what really happens when the music fades.  if music wasnt there, would we, you know, FEEL God's presense with the goosebumps and dadada...  Gosh, i've been having this puzzling thing in my mind ever since goodness knows when... anyways what i'm getting at is, would everyone have that look of concentration on their faces if there wasnt any relaxing keyboards and background beats? i wondered this too at camp last yr.. the phew, traumatic experience, some what. you see, everytime the pastor had one of his session, he always insisted on having someone just sustaining some chords in the back ground.. ALWAYS, you know. and he'd then have everyone to close their eyes and focus on God while the pastor err, ministered. my dad says that it is possible that when a group of ppl get together, with a leader to lead them, eyes closed, with semi-dark lighting and background music, the leader can actually lead you into a trance.. not an occult or hypotizing thing, infact you're very aware of whatever is happening, jsut that you're erm concentrating on trying to imagine whatever the speaker is saying maybe? i dunno..  sigh, i dunno what i'm trying to get at anymore. my thoughts are scattered and i dunno which piece to pick up. goonditey.

      Ah, its finally Friday. Been waiting for tonight since Monday morning. I suppose that has always been the case.  I’m feeling anxious tonight. Know why? Cos Monday is coming. Lol that sounds stupid but its true. Sigh, its because I got in some trouble with a teacher…its pretty complicated actually. But its my blog and I’m gonna write!!  I had given my class teac the class photograph order list to give to the teacher in charge. Blahblah, that was 1 month ago!?! 2 days ago, the teacher in charge of the photos came up to me and told me hand up the form and pay the money by that very day. I told her that I had already given the form to my class teach a loooong time ago, she told me to settle. Fine, i went to my class teac and told her, she said she’d looked for the form cos apparently she had lost it. By the end of the day, it was still lost, i got fed up and handed her the money to give to the teacher in charge when she had found it. Today, class teac asked me to ask the class again who wanted photos, and mind you they had all paid and 3k students aren’t famous for the memory skills. And dadadadada, after I had done everything, I went to her table and guess what? The original form was there… urgh.. so much for hard work and forcing my classmates brains to squeeze out their faint memory of who ordered photos. And the money is with the class teac btw, so I couldn’t take the form and give it to teac in charge. And during recess, the teac in charge was pretty upset, asked me to settle. I was busy, couldn’t find class teac OR teac in charge. I’m gonna die.   You see, the teacher in charge of the pics, she’s pretty infamous for her sarcasm skills. And I mean it man, she can blow the top of you with her sarcasm. Its amazing to see her in action, when the mangsa is somebody else la………………………….   Besides that, exam is next Friday and I’m scared, trust me. 3 years worth of studies for 10 subjects.. Mari kita bunuh diri? Lol.   MaryLamb gonna be eaten by the Wolf.

      I stare at the notes on the upper stave on the paper, wondering what they sound like.  Auntie Lay Suan says: "1, 2, 3, 4" and plays the harmony I'm still starring wondering what on earth to sing out.   I seriously nearly cried during piano lesson just now. Out of fustration, of course.. (my teacher is a very nice lady) Sightsinging is so tough. I have no idea what the notes sound like. I try to connect but by the time i start singing in my head, the song has ended.  I am doomed.  My pieces & scales, SAVE ME!   Btw, I've been wondering, is it possible to learn piano up to my level WITHOUT being musical?  Can it like suddenly *DAWN* on you that you're not musical? Cos it feels like it now.

      Today is Father's Day.  Fake. Is it fake? I'm guessing not. I feel awkard on these Father Mother Days. Yeah sure, its a day where you get to do sumth special for your parents. Nice. Just not my thing.   Everything's not my thing. LOL. I'm such an idiot. Why can't I just go with the flow of everything? Anyways, back to the Father's Day topic, my dad- typical him, he gets paiseh when you offer to buy anything for him.   1. I don't know what books he likes. The books I know he likes cost like RM400 and can't be found in Msia.  2. He wants a set of weights, but when we take him out to choose em, he'll divert and we'll end up buying him a drink :| 3. I could write him a poem on how much he means to me and those soppy stuff but my mom wouldn't agree - tak cukup 'class'... tau?   Ah well, I bought him this porcelein frog which looks like the stray frog he found in our garden and got attached to it, even named it Froggie but it ran away somewhere. So porcelein to replace it.   Oh, and my mom asked me to put in a reincheck sorta voucher thingy for a set of weights. We'll see whether ia jadi atau tak.   Goodnight, gotta finish up me KH project. Yeah and my first piece Allegro by CPE Bach is getting worser every time i practice. I'm doomed. DOOMED.   -Mary-RuthLowErn-Lyn (3 hyphens in a row hehe)

      Went for prayer meeting today. One thing I observed during worship. We sang 'Beautiful Lord and Saviour, loving us like no other.' The bridge part goes like this: Release us from our past As we seek Your face   Before we started singing the song, the worship leader prayed that God would heal the church's pain and past of all their 3 pastors leaving the church.   Was pretty surprised when me heard that since you know, it has been 2-3 years? And numerous preachers have preached bout that issue and I had the impression that the healing process and already been completed, that there were gonna focus on the growing process now.   Shows that some ppl in the congregation are still hurting.. No one brings up that topic already and the worship leader who prayer that 'God would release us from the past' sounded like there was still something holding the person back.  Reminds me of my past week, that I kept my spirits down because of my lousy results. When many many people told me to move on, try harder next time, work harder from now on. I still dwelled over it for a day. Thats 24 hours. But nah, I'm fine now, moving on. Speaking of which 'Keep On Moving' by 5ive is play now. Hehehehe.   Oh well, yeah that prayer just struck on a thought on how keeping the past with you can hinder you from moving on. Not saying that the worship leader had hindrances, just that it can happen. Whether that person still has problems with it or not, I do wonder whether the rest of the church members still struggle with that though.   Mmmm, shouldn't wonder. Mind your own business, M-R.  Goodnight everyborrddiiee..

      Piano exam is in 2 weeks. 15 days to be exact.  I feel my knees go weak, my lower lip trembles. Haha joke. But seriously I am worried. Not as worried as my piano teacher though.   I'm the one who gets worried when I see the expression on her face when I play my exam pieces. I know what she means when she says "theres not feeling la, the magic hasn't happene" But HOW? The feeling doesn't seem to want to come out, if that is possible. I guess its the 'mood' thing again. I've been bad, mood-wise. But hey, I've been practicing this piece for months, surely I can at least play with some feel for it.   To tell you the truth, I actually LIKE my pieces this time 'round. They're sad, wallowing-in-depression kinda pieces. Lyadov's Mazurka in F minor has a tragic sound to it, which makes it lovely and this delicate nimble middle sect. I love the piece. Needs more "feeling" too, though.   Oh, and the 3rd piece. Its the best in the world. Makes you wanna move your body to da groove while playing it. Heh heh heh. Its a blues piece. And a very bluesy piece it is. By Christopher Lambert. 4 pages though, but I love every note of it. Thought it doesn't sound too well when I play, but I still like it very much (not my playing but the piece)   I'm bored, gotta do my maths homework. My face is FULL of pimples. Nasty ones. It hurts la. Sigh.   I think I talk too much.   I shocked that my friend uses such profane language in her blog entries.   -M-R

      I'm back from Port Dickson. No more beach and err..lousy, expensive food. haha oops. I hope no one from KBC read that.   The retreat was good, the condo was great and cold and the beach was marvellous. My thighs ache much from the morning jog yesterday at the beach. And I'm not exactly a morning person.   School starts tomorrow and that sucks. I'm online now, at 8.30 pm simply because I know my classmates will start calling and I don't want to be reminded of them yet. Not yet. Am I mean? I have a whole pile of undone homework waiting for me and I don't feel up to it. I feel up to it sometimes you know, rarely la, not now though. Sighhhhhh   Piano exam is roughly 3 weeks away. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I am not prepared at all. I hope I don't feel. My oral is gone. So is the sightreading. Mazurka, my Elegiac Blues piece, CPE Bach, SAVE MARY-RUTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hahahaa. scales also on the edge, gonna drop off and die liao. Gotta buck it up, M-R. Buck it up. Get more than a merit, get a distinction!   Whoa, did I just say that?   Goodnight, I'm off to prepare myself psychologically for school tomorrow. Argh, back to face the teachers again tomorrow. Yay, no English no Monday. Teacher is h o p e l e s s.   -showers of grace

      Auntie Soon Yin is staying the night at my house today, because it’s the second Thursday of the month. She’ll be staying every second Thursday of the month because she has a meeting at Grace Assembly in Klang.   Auntie Soon Yin isn’t my auntie. She’s a friend of my parents, and I call em all ‘aunties’. And though I’ve only come to know her a lil since we moved back up to Klang five years ago, she is someone who will always leave a last influence on me. You could say, in a sense, I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for auntie Soon Yin.   My brother was six years old then, my parents were still relatively young then (in their thirties… oops.) and they were on the Doulos. They were on the ship for only three months, my dad’s sabbatical, I think. That was where they met auntie Soon Yin.   My parents tell me this is how it went:  On a dark on stormy night, my parents and brother were in their tiny (it is tiny) and my brother said he wanted a younger brother. Then my parents said okay, why don’t you pray to God bout it? And he knelt down there and then in that little tiny cabin on a boat in Sri Lanka and prayed for a brother. When he finished praying, my parents asked him what he would do if God gave him a sister instead of a brother. He said no problem. (awww… hehehe)  Oh and a lil while after my brother prayed, auntie Soon Yin came to see my mom to pray for my mom. (she didn’t know bout my brother’s prayer) And she told my mom that God was gonna give her a child. Whoa.   Mmm and roughly a year later, Mary-Ruth, Martyn’s younger sister was born.  Oh I still haven’t explained why brother had to pray for a younger sibling, and you know, that IT couldn’t just happen like that. That’s because my mom has some hormonal problem so she can’t give birth naturally. In fact, the doctor didn’t believe that mom was pregnant with my brother when the results came out. So we both are miracle babies, you could say…. No no, not you could say, you have to say, because we are. =)  Well, there. Touching huh. Today you know a lil history on Mary-Ruth’s family….    Dad’s still sick. Very bad. He struggles to keep his food down. At least there’s improvement- the food stays in.   Please pray for him. He can’t walk properly, let alone work. And he has a Bible teaching lesson on Saturday and preaching at FGA on Sunday.   I’m going camp tomorrow, won’t be back till Sunday. Hope I learn something. They asked me to bring my jogging shoes. Cool, we’re going jogging… in Port Dickson. *grin*   Love you, Mary-RuthLowErn-Lyn   (I feel like typing my full name tonight. Oh did you know my Chinese name means ‘showers of grace’?)

      After The Edge Conference, I checked out New Life Church’s site. Looked around and saw a link to Jared Anderson’s (the keyboard/piano man) personal web. There’s this section ‘Notes’ where he apparently writes a daily journal for the 21 days before his 21st birthday. There are four years in there, 1999-2002. I’ve read 1999 and 2000 so far.   I’m taking it slow cos I want to savour it. Hehe. Neh, its just his thoughts in general and all that. It’s just interesting to read. Really interesting. Typically American, you could say. I wouldn’t go through the same things as he would. But its just so interesting looking from another person’s window out to the world of life.   In other words, I’m nosy. Hah.   I like reading people’s thoughts. What really goes on inside their heads. That’s why I like to read people’s blogs I guess. Even I don’t really know that person well, I like to read what they are thinking. Totally first person point of view. Me, me, me..   It’s something you wouldn’t normally hear if you were spending time with the person. It’s stuff that don’t come out verbally. But only moves silently in the vicinities of the mind. They only come out when you’re alone. Not physically alone but your mind isn’t distracted with something else.   Blah, I don’t know what I’m trying to say already.   Oh yeah, one more person who’s online journals are nice- Jason Mraz. I don’t know. Maybe I just like his style. They seem more personal and not just something he’d like to say to his fans. Spilling it all out spontaneously is just so wonderful and shnogzzling, as Roald Dahl would say.   Full of shnogzzles, Mary-Ruth  Ps-   wow I’m on such a blogging-spree today. But I won’t have much time once school starts. I can feel the busy vibes already. They are coming, oh, rushing towards me!

      I do not know if I did the right thing today. Just now actually, like 20 minutes ago, was talking on the phone with a close friend. A close non-Christian friend.   I’ve tried sharing with her, the God I know, my best friend. I do not know, she seems uncertain. She needs someone to guide her to Him, and I’m pretty sure that someone is me. At least she listens. She doesn’t mind me preaching. =)  She asked me bout love tonight. She has this constant worry on her future partner problems. Tsk tsk, the things 15 year old kids think of, huh?  She’s afraid she won’t know how to love him, whether her love will be genuine or not, whether he will love her back with the same genuine love.   Come to think of it, I think I went too deep. Oops. This is roughly what I told her:  Human beings can love. But it is not an eternal love. Only God can love eternally, since He Himself is love. So even if a pair of us humans love each other, it is like petrol and arang batu- tidak boleh dibaharui. Sooner or later, it will run out. So for it to last, you gotta get your source from God. Why God? Simply because He is love.   Hmm I hope that’s correct, cos I told her that. And I don’t want to be found telling people the wrong things about God. It would be oh so bad if I were unconsciously going around telling my friends the wrong things bout God.   -Mary-Ruth

      Dad’s been sick. Vomiting after every meal. He says he’s pregnant. Hah, I wish. He looks so miserable, I know he feels miserable too.   It might be bulimia. He has been talking bout losing weight recently. Hehehe.   For all the 15 years I’ve known him, I still wonder how he copes with his giddy spells and frequent colds and sickness.   This year, 2004 is his 13th borrowed year. Imagine, he was supposed to die 13 years ago. Oops, not supposed to die la, but you know, might have died, if not for God.   Oh dad has been working on a commentary on Deuteronomy. Its been three years since he started, now middle of the fourth chapter. He always says that he will allow God to take him when his work with Deuteronomy is done. Haha, that’s not too long away. But it’s fine. 13 borrowed years of having a dad makes me owe lotsa gratitude already. What else can I ask for?   Meanwhile, I can see dad being sick with the vomiting and stomach discomfort is taking its toil on mom. She doesn’t know what to cook for him- Plain porridge still goes into the toilet bowl. She struggles to drive alone at night to pick me from tuition. She doesn’t drive well at night. I can hear the slight panic in her voice when I call her sometimes.   Pray for dad and mom, please.    -Mary-Ruth

      My mom found a cheap deal of Roald Dahl’s books in Popular at Jaya Jusco the other day. SCREAM OH MY GOODNESS! Each book was only going for RM 9.90. Now that is something to shout about. It is.  I now have every published children’s book by Roald Dahl. Its pretty amazing how he got away with everything you know- all the gruesomeness, goriness, and disgusting characters he came up with- considering you’re writing for children here, mind you. Simply amazing. Like take BFG for example, the details bout the other wicked giants guzzling up kids from around the world. Hmmm..  But seriously, if you take it the wrong way, you could just point and accuse him of polluting innocent lil kids minds. You should read his revolting rhymes.. Cinderella cut of her step-sister’s head!  The thing is, to tell you the truth, the most part of my imagination sorta derived from reading his books. All the twists, plots, witty and yes I have to mention the gruesomeness and crudeness of his characters, they all play a big part of my imagination.   Haha, it’s wonderful.   I wonder if its theologically alright. But I’ve been wondering too much, give my mind a break.  See you, Mary-Ruth

      Yesterday we had the chance of saying Venus block the sun. I don’t know the exact term for it. But yeah its like the earth, Venus and the sun are in one line. It happens once in a hundred and twenty years.  I didn’t catch it though, you need a good telescope and a good filter. And we don’t have that so too bad.  But its cool, yeh? I mean, hey, something like this only happens twice (the other is in 2012, 8 years from now) in 120 years. And you’ve living now. Hehehehe.  God is just so cool. I wonder if He saw it. I bet He wouldn’t have needed a telescope.   -Mary-Ruth

      This past week has been enriching. I’ve been learning so much. I’ve been discussing so much. I’ve been thinking too much.   You know, the mind is a good thing. The mind produces happiness thoughts, excitement and encouragement. But it is also a dangerous thing. It’s the place where sinful desires are thought up, coaxed to come in.   Anyway, I had better jot down and think through what I’ve learned last week at conference before I lose it all and it’ll just be another conference which I went to during the holidays.  It was Ps Ross Parsley who spoke on Thursday’s morning session. He spoke on worship, naturally, since he’s the worship pastor of his church. I even went up to the pastor after the session and said thank you, which is so totally not my self to do that. Strange, God is changing me. Serious, although I see it all the time- people going up to my dad after the service to ask him stuff or just thank him for the sermon, I have never in my life thought of going up to thank the preacher who had just given a good sermon.  Just the night before, I was talking to Rachel bout worship and how I struggle, in a sense. Mainly because I’ve too much influence from everyone- family, friends, preachers. My family especially, they warn me that I should never just absorb anything like that. I should always think and check through whether its from God or not.   And yes, I must say that its totally my fault, but lately over the months and years, I’ve let that awareness become a hindrance. Hindrance in the way like I cannot worship God whole heartedly because my mind is distracted on whether the lyrics and everything happening around me… whether its from God or not. Yes. For the past few years, that’s been what its been. Ask my close friends, they know. I have not been able to settle this issue of mine until last Thursday.   Hmm. Its 3.30 am. I think I’ll continue later on today cos’ if my dad or mom walks thru the door now, I am officially a dead person. Night.  Back. It’s 2.30 pm now. I woke up at a quarter to noon after sleeping at 4 early this morn. Weird.   Yes, back to where we originally came from: worship, doubts, hindrances, and God.  Mmm yeah the pastor used the passage of Luke 7, Jesus anointed by the sinful woman. The one with the alabaster jar.    And then he read out verse 47, “herefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven-for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little” What immediately flashed through my head was me. That you know, I was brought up in a Christian family, dad as pastor and all. And yeah I had been thinking of that thing that week. I remember a friend telling me ‘those who were brought up in a Christian family aren’t true Christians because they don’t know what it really feels like to be without God since they have known God ever since they were born.’ I was pretty hurt by that, considering I looked up to him as a leader and wah, he is so obviously talking bout me, bout my friends.  Anyways, after Ps Ross had read that passage out, and after all those things in the paragraph above had flashed through my mind, which probably took like 3 secs, Ps Ross said something that totally tallied with what I was thinking.   It doesn’t mean that we have to have a real horrible life and then repent to mean you have been forgiven much and therefore love much.  -Whoa, really? It’s about your judgment towards forgiveness/repentance. It’s about whether you’re willing to repent and not judge others being more sinful than yourself.  -Woohoo.  We can’t prove by our actions that we’re more godly than others. Its not about our own actions/deeds. Like Simon (the Pharisee Jesus was having dinner with), he trusted his actions to save him. But no, you gotta come and be yourself before God.  Simon needed Jesus as much as the woman did.   Another thing, sometimes we seem to spend the first few songs repenting and confessing to God because we feel like we need to feel worthy before God before we start worshipping Him. But instead of doing that, we should face the facts that no matter what, we are still memangpun unworthy to worship God. We should never God that we are never worthy. But it’s because Jesus has died on the cross for us that we are able (able, not worthy) to come to God and worship Him.  So we should come prepared to worship God. Not saying that you aren’t supposed to repent. You are, you should.   That was like yeah, cos I usually spend my time thinking on blah ah I don’t feel worthy to worship God today. Fact is I never will be. But since I’m given the chance, seize and worship la. Adoi. Never dawned on me till that day.   Back to Simon not realizing he need Jesus as much as the woman did, sometimes we tend to feel that way too. Like we have everything at our feet, how do I feel like I need God desperately? (Note- the band is called Desperation so through out all the workshops, the word ‘desperate’ was used a lot.) Well, once again, God works through brokenness. So we gotta be desperate all the time as if we have a crisis. That’s what the pastor said.   Here’s what I make of it, we shouldn’t take things for granted when everything is fine, when the storm has passed. We should be thankful that we’re alive but always live as though the storm will come tomorrow. And therefore, always be grateful. And in a sense, we can function out of that gratitude and be erm, desperate for God.   Of course, of course, we worship God because He deserves it and we wanna glorify God. Hehe, just a clarification there.  And sometimes you know you get the feeling (hah, its all about feelings, ain’t it?) where you don’t feel like worshipping? But you know you should be so you open your mouth and sing but inside you’re feeling all depressed and all that.  Is that hypocrisy? I always thought so you know.  But the pastor said that many a time people misinterpret that is being a hypocrite- when your actions aren’t lining up with what you’re feeling inside.  He said that hypocrisy is when your actions don’t line up with your convictions, what you believe is true and right.  That totally makes sense to me. Gotta go read up some more though.   Oh you want a gist of my notes on how you should worship? I know you don’t. But read on, please.  1.	be purposeful- if you draw near to Him, He will draw near to you.  2.	personal- make it intimate and personal, not general stuff 3.	passionate- we should engage our feelings/emotions when we worship 4.	priceless- the woman gave all she had, her perfume, her maruah diri.   Are you willing to risk it all?  Are you, Mary-Ruth?

      Ah Sher called me today while I was eating breakfast. She asked whether I could help out during the ISCF Rally in July, either ushering or acting in the sketch. I hesitated for a while. Both of em aren’t exactly my thing. Yeah that’s just an excuse, you’ll say. But really leh, come to think of it. Anyways, I chose ushering because acting is a definite no-no. But I still sorta hesitated. Yeah cos I don’t like meeting new people what more welcoming em? And I believe superficiality and first impressions plays an important part in this. But its okay, Mary-Ruth will take heart and face em! *grins*   Speaking of superficiality, I’m getting kinda fed-up with a few of my friends. They’re so self-conscious it makes me sick. There should be some limit to this nonsense.  -Oh my gosh, that guy is cute I could die.  -Do I look pretty today? Eeyer, there’s this huge pimple on my forehead.  -I hate my face, I hate my body. Duh. I feel so sick and disgusted typing this out. And it does go on and on. Down there, deep inside there’s a voice encouraging me to go on, being their friend, because they need me and they do not know Christ. And I’m to help them get to know Him. Oh, if only they could see, that there is so much more beyond boyfriends and pimples and branded clothes.   Father, help them see! I feel so limited in my friendship, you could say. I have so much things to say about Jesus but they either don’t wanna listen or its just some awkward situation we got there. During one of the workshops last week, they said you gotta help em find Jesus while on their wavelength. I guess that’s my fault. Cos sometimes I’m not on their wavelength. Yeah I’m their friend and all, but I’m live a waaay sheltered life then they do. Or rather They’re not contented with the sheltered life they have now. SO they look for an exposed one, if you get one I mean. They want the things in life: popularity, guys, money, branded stuff, look cool.. those stuff la.   They say I’m too deep. I use to ‘cheem’ words. Bombastic English. Sigh. So I should start sharing the gospel in Ah Lian talk… Woohooo. *grins* ‘So ah, that fella mati lor on the wooden thing. Look like ‘T’ wan… but then inside our black black heart no more. Become white adee. Then we can get to meet Daddy.’  Urgh, yuck, no. Anyways I’m exaggerating. My friends aren’t Ah Lian extremists. I don’t think I could bear them. Yeah I’m prejudiced towards ah lians. In fact, I think I should stop calling them, whoever, ‘ah lians’ cos it is criticism. I’m criticizing them when all they want acceptance and a sense of belonging. I think. I don’t know, I don’t understand them well. I don’t try to understand em well. My fault.   Ok, everyone hear, tonight, Mary-Ruth solemnly vows never again to call anyone or any group of people ‘ah lians’. Why? Because it is wrong and hurtful to do so.   Back to my friends, I guess all I need is a lil more patience on my side. They need help. Imagine, I know Jesus and I struggle so much. Imagine my friends, how much MORE they would struggle.  Hmm, I hope none of my friends will visit this blog. I only gave a few of them my url and I doubt they check it often. I once heard someone say, don’t ever ever share your spiritual problems or matters with a non-Christian. ‘Cause it might chase them away from Christ, knowing there’s so much struggles and difficulties while walking with the Lord. I wonder if that’s true. In a sense I suppose its true but then there’s like so much more to walking with the Lord then just struggles and difficulties. There’s rejoicing, comfort, happiness, belonging, acceptance.. L O V E is what there is.   I’m reading C.S. Lewis’ Mere Christianity now. His biography said that when he finally accepted Christ as his Saviour, he was probably the most reluctant person to become a Christian. “In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God…perhaps the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England.” He lost the argument, the debate. And I’m reading his debate now.  People like him got to find God because they didn’t believe in God. They got all their arguments down and argued, and lost, surrendered and gave in.   But what about those people who don’t argue? Who don’t bother? Or rather, they say they’re not bothered.   Oh, *ting, light bulb comes on* I know. God works through brokenness. So it would take their brokenness to find out they really need God in order to get through their brokenness.  Interesting, huh? That’s what makes Theology just lovely. God suddenly just comes down and surprises you ever so unexpectedly. And it’s nice to know that you know a little bit more about God today. =)  I feel drained for this post. Might write another one later. While I still have the holidays to give me the allowance to do so.   Goodnight,  Mary-Ruth

      I think I have a real huge problem. I don't like people to understand my self.   I don't think its bad or sinful or anything, its just I feel uneasy or rather like I've no control over how I feel or act because you: the person who understand me- knows what I feel, what I'm going to say and how I will act.  For me especially, I don't like to mix with people who are you could say the same type/kind of person I am. I need to be with someone of the opposite side. Well, that sounds so extreme, yeah maybe that's an exaggeration but it's sorta something like that.   There is one person who I entirely surrender to, though. His name is Jesus...like the fragrance after the rain. Yeap, He knows me totally. Even if I don't like it, He does. And don't worry, I don't mind one bit. He's the only one I that I let Him know me and I talk to Him knowing He knows me inside out. He's part of me anyway, so how can He not know me if He's a part of me?   But once in a while, when a friend surprises me with something I never thought she knew, its nice to know that friends understand you, that they're concern and they would like to know you more.   The other night, at a sleepover, my friends were saying that what I am isn't how I portray myself to be (??). As in, you could not guess what kinda person I really am by just looking at me. Not that I'm a wearing a mask or anything, its just there's this deeper side to me. Hmm, does that mean I usually portray myself to be shallow? Whoa, nah I'm kidding. Btw, yeah I think I'm like that too, that you wouldn't know me unless you know me, you know?   That's spooky, eh?.. Your best friends saying that there's more to me than what they already know.   Oh I don't know. I've many different kinda friends. A lot of em close, but I don't know what goes on in their minds. I seem to have underestimated the surprises my friends can give me by sharing a lil bit more of their deeper side, perhaps? It's wonderful you know, discovering people. I love it. Though it does get shocking sometimes, it gives you a sense of warmness, that 'hey! I know that fella better.'  Man, this whole thing is so self-centered. Everything's about me. That's not good you know. Everything I think about shouldn't be me. But I still am thinking about me. That's a sin you know.. Knowing something is wrong but still continues doing it. Sigh, I'm sinning just thinking all these stuff bout ME.   I read last night on Jared Anderson's (the keyboardist from New Life Church) website: "Question. How was teenage life?  -An adventure. A blast. The real answers are illusive. A process. That's pretty accurate. Adolescence is where you figure out who you are, what you like, and what you dislike. It's a game. And you never find out what you've won until you've lost."  Yeah discovering your identity.. Sorting out your personal issues. That sounds so like me. I always thought I wasn't a typical teenager.. rebel against parents, peer pressure, do drugs, go with the fashion trends, like hot guys blah blah. It that sense of typical teenager, yeah, I'm not one. But in the emotional sense, yes. No no, not struggling with anger or violence or thoughts of suicide  I just think a lot, bout life, bout God, bout me. Yeah, about ME. Woohoo. Hehe. I live with a OT teacher/pastor and I came from a Presbyterian church, not much room for that kinda stuff, don't  you think? Goodness, I seriously think so much that sometimes my mind could just explode and all the tissues and blood will just fly all over the walls and stain the ceiling. Eh, but the mind isn't an organ woh. Only the brain is. Hehe  Anyways, sometimes I wonder whether when you're older, settled down with a job, married and a few kids.. Whether at that age, you'll still wonder bout your identity issues, problems with best friends and all. I guess not since you won't be having sleepovers and wondering about how the future is going to be (hey, I said wondering not worrying).  Hah, so for now, I will have to accept that I am a typical teenager (urgh I can't bear that word, so overused) and that I have issues with my thinking and attitude. And I have lotsa to tell but I will do that later cos I need a break from this selfish sinful thinking of my self.   Goodnight. Love,  Mary-Ruth

      Wow its been such a absolutely long time since I've roamed the place of freedom, dangers and enlightenment by starring at a screen. Serious, must have been Wednesday night... which is 5 days ago. Well, absolutely long for me la.   Haih…its all I can see. Now now, don't misunderstand, that sigh is not a sigh of depression or whatever but of relief, reflection and amazement. Seriously this past week has been like w h o a.  Went for The Edge conference in FGA KL, a creative arts conference and then I left for church camp on Friday and came back roughly 4 hours ago. So killer. Mainly the conference was the highlight since the camp was kinda like a hangover from conference sorta thing. Haha I didn't even give my full attention to Ps John Kwan, the speaker at camp. It was sorta based on Rick Warren's book the Purpose Driven Church.. like telling how to grow your church and bring the community to your group of core ministers. Hmm.. suitable for youth anot, you tell me. I told my dad and he told me to write to Ps John Kwan, tell him that it was supposed to be a family camp and that he should have prepared his sessions and include the youth. Hmmmm..  nah, its okay. I don't really err like giving pastors my opinions or anything cos MOST (most only, there’s still a small portion left) of em probly like alamak this fella thinks she is who.... But I dunno I believe in letting those below you (so to speak) to correct you. But hmm, I didn't plan to preach here and I will not preach here.  Its 12.30 now and the rain drops are beating against the awning outside.. Ahh, so peaceful. Oh, and Hoobastank's The Reason has been playing since I turned on the comp. On repeat. Very lovely song there, I always seem to like a song then listen to it till I'm sick of it and move on. Hmm.   The people online are boring. Strange I used to be so excited seeing them online. They just seem so boring. Or maybe its me. Yeah its me. I know its me cos I can feel the vibes. Oh don't ask me how, you do not wanna know. Well maybe they're not boring, its just I dunno what to say, tiredness of the brain, most probably. But hey, they're keeping silent too, not exactly fair for me ritey-o?  Hey, M-R! get on with life la.   Ok ok, getting on. Yeah anyway, back to the conference. It was just eye-opening. I figure you're visiting this blog cos you wanna know bout my progress, degress, emotions and you’re just bored. Whatever it is, get ready for confessions. *gasps*   Yes, ok, before the conference started, I never prepared myself. No, didn't even talk to God the night before, in fact, I slept with the light on trying to do dunno what la. Then came the morning session they had worship. Goodness I felt out of place *guilty*. Was like, oh no, so long have not talked to Him and suddenly you come in here in praise Him? Yes, Tuesday morning. Oh btw, Ps Dennis Balan preached a great message. Too bad I've heard before. Conference that day was great. My first 2 workshops were 'Reaching the fringe music culture'. No one from my group were there. Everybody else was in the worship leading workshop. Even those who don't worship lead. Hmm.. Anyways, I had to go alone, it was fine. Just I felt a lil out of place with all the youth leaders and there were so many ppl. I dunno bout you, but when I do not know anybody and everyone is grabbing chair sitting down in a place where the space is getting filled up quickly, I honestly feel insecure. God may be good to me, but its just a feeling when everyone is has a seat and Oh no! I don’t have a chair. *scratches head* Weird, eh? Anyways, the workshop was good, I learned a lot. Ps Glenn Lim was taking the workshops. And although, the things he taught weren't directly applicable to me cos I wasn’t like doing any ministry in the fringe area, but I learned much which yeah I can use in the future. And now I know how to reach out to them.   Then during lunch everyone asked how my workshop was, I told em 'good' and wah suddenly everyone follows me to the part 2. (actually 3 others only la) hehe. But I kinda learned more during part 1 I gotta say. Before class ended, Ps Glenn arranged another session for Q & A since he didn't have enough time. Alrightey! More =) The next day, Ps Glenn took the morning session. It was very very relevant to me. Well, yeahla, some of it he had told the class the day before, but still it got to me again. Oh yeah, Ps Glenn reminds me of dad. I absolutely do not know why you know!! Its like they're not of the same age, diff generation altogether, they work with the diff ppl, diff nationalities, dad isn't a changed ex-druggie, and I dunno.. very far apart. But somehow I dunno leh, maybe it's the way Ps Glenn preaches and prays that reminds me of dad. Strange though, cos no one has ever reminded me of dad, the way he thinks, they way he presents his sermons and the way he relates. But whoa, of all ppl, a young Singaporean pastor barely across his mid thirties (I think).. Hmm.. Very strange. I still can believe it myself.   LOL. Call me perasan, proud, arrogant, snobbish, prejudice whatever… but I admire my dad very very much, as a preacher/teacher. And woohoo, Ps Glenn reminds me of my dad. Hah. I think dad's jealous. I told him on Wednesday night. ;) Nah, I'm joking. But really lor, I find it sooo amusing. But its good, shows I'm not prejudice, cos if I was, no one would remind of dad.   Lalalalalaa, getting sleepy. I got a lot more to tell but the screen itself looks like funny now and I hear the stars calling me (or rather its only Jars of Clay hehe) to slumberland. Goodnightey everybody, anybody, nobody who is reading this.   -Mary-RuthLowErn-Lyn

       WARNING:   The following was taken  out  of a journal entry of mine. So it might seem weird but  voila,  now you know what stuff I write in my journals. Heh heh heh.&nbsp;    &nbsp; You know, a lot of my un-peered friends are attached. Oops, explanation of un-peered friends: friends who are not my peers. These friends of mine seem to have found their love (Ah, that sweet word) and they are pretty sure their attachment will be their future spouse. I am particularly close to one, who has been in a relationship for a year. She tells me a lot about her relationship, the bliss, the sadness, the loud absence when her lover isn’t around, the challenges, the difficulties and most of all, the love.   How does it feel to be in love, I wonder. I find a lot of people have a contaminated idea of love. That it is just a feeling, a sensation (ie. The Darkness’ song Love is Only a Feeling)&nbsp; that will eventually fade away. Or it is the pleasure of making love (ie. Sex is referred as making love) Bah! What shallow expressions of love. I mean, of course, love can mean those things. But it does include a hundred billion other things as well, that I am sure. What those hundred billion other things are, I cannot tell. I have experienced my parents love, my brother’s love, my friends’ love and most ultimately God’s love.  I have yet to experience the love of my boyfriend, my husband. In fact, I may never get to experience it. (Just um, reminding myself that it is possible, though with all my heart I want a husband! Hah.) Yes, I said it: with all my heart I want a husband, in the future of course. Now I’m thinking what if God replies: You should be satisfied with the love you are experiencing because I am Love and My love is the ultimate Love. OOoooooh.. *Mary-Ruth gets wide-eyed*  But, but… I’m holding on that God will grant me my desire (its not unhealthy at all, kay..) one day.  Hmm now I’m afraid to say that what if God thinks it best for me to remain single. You know, I’ve heard people pray like this:  “God, please heal so and so. But if its not Your will, we will kindly accept Your decision.”  So, am I supposed to pray like this as well?  “God, please grant me a husband, but if its not Your will for me to get married, I will be fine with it.”  Awww man.. Sigh. I always joke with my parents that I won’t get married and I’ll just spend my life as a missionary in an African jungle being a missionary and researching snakes. But of course I don’t want to do that!!! YEEEEE so lonely.  Am I too young to be thinking about all this?  I ask too many questions

        I know I have never mentioned this to anyone, but I really miss Bario.    I miss waking up surrounded my mist-filled mountains  I miss the people there, how warm and sincere and friendly  I miss hearing their language, the puk ayam which means ‘my beloved’   I miss sitting by the fire at night to keep warm, while roasting Bario jagungs and sweet potatoes on it.  I miss fishing in the pond which penghulu had, where even a 3 year old kid could fish since the minute the bread touched the water the fish would bite.  I miss the freezing showers in which we could only last 2 minutes.   I miss trekking up the mountains and standing on the lil hill of grass which had grown over what was originally bull-poop.  I miss riding at the back of penghulu pick-up, my butt getting bumped about due to the rough roads.  I miss the Bario church service where I didn’t understand a thing during worship but I thoroughly enjoyed it. (or rather the word should be ‘blessed by it’.. it sounds holier)   I miss the lovely lovely food.   I miss the wonderful wind blowing at your face the whole day through while you sit by the window reading Amy Tan or John Grisham.   I miss walking through the square padi patches.   I miss watching the beeeeooooooteefool sun setting behind the mountains.   I miss the tiny airport, where everybody in town could be found there during mid-day discussing bout the latest events.   I miss auntie Freda, auntie Midang, uncle Roland, penghulu.   My heart sighs.

       Being dragged along by a friend to see her boyfriend a hundred times an hour, for a hew hours, really isn’t my idea of fun. Uh uh. Today was my school, SMK Convent Klang’s canteen day. Dead tiring and super boring. And we had to be there for 8 full hours.   There seemed to be an influx of ah bengs, spikey haired guys in black clothes and every guy in Klang lah, was there. Crazy man. Convent is such a guy magnet. Hah hah. Anyway, I am just so so so glad its o v e r.   Planning and organizing isn’t my expertise and I really did it bad for my class. Poor girls. All our bones were aching by 11am (it ended at 3pm), at least the weather was hot and sunny. Now I’ll probly switch to full-blast study mode. Haha, very funny Mary-Ruth. That would never happen in a thousand years.   A lot of things have been happening lately you know. I’ve a few things on my mind now:  1. My brother came back for a whole week and then he left 3 days ago. I really miss him around. He’ll only be back in 2 months time.   2. PMR trials are around the corner. Enough said.   3. Playing keyboards for youth. I don’t feel like its my gift. Serious. But I can’t stop now cause I know that my youth leader will say ‘I don’t think it’s my gift’ is nonsense. Sigh, I can just imagine his response. Ah yes, and they are lacking keyboardists and are currently training me up for Sunday service. I know it. AHHHHHH how now how now?  -more on that later, not now, brain bursting-   4. The MPH Young Writers competition. Deadline is next Saturday I haven’t written anything. I don’t think can make it liao. Sigh. Eh, actually I did write a paragraph but I don’t like it. My mom accidentally read it and said it was good but I don’t think so. Sigh sigh sigh. Will I ever make it as a writer?

       I promised myself&nbsp; I'd make it a point to blog today.&nbsp; I've got a hundred million other things to do but Mary-Ruth, you have to blog today. And I'll gladly do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; (sorry, need some monolog dalam counselling)    &nbsp;  Recently my friend's dad got 'promoted' to be Elder in the church. I teased her by calling her 'Elder's daughter', she then backfired "at least I'm not a preacher's daughter". It seems people have problems with that. The preacher's daughter title thing.    Is it true that preacher's daughters are expected or required to behave kinder, gentler, holier and better than everyone else? I suppose in a sense that would make sense since pastors are required to do what preach and therefore encourage their children to be more Christ-like.   However those children whose parents are Christians shouldn't be any more different from pastor's kids.     &nbsp;  Anyway since the time my friend hinted bout the preacher's kids' requirement to be holier, I've been sorta observing pastor's kids around. No not a research just take more notice- how they behave and stuff. Most of them, they either turn out very well: youth leaders, wonderful results, lotsa talents.    A few though, perhaps because of the pressure become rebellious. I think its stressful sometimes, imagine your parent this holy holy fella then you gotta like keep up the reputation then you become rebellious and want to have nothing to do with your strict family. Bah I don't know what I'm getting at already. I got too distracted chatting.     &nbsp;  Quite a few songs on the radio have lines that go 'I was a preacher's daughter blahblahblah', perhaps implying that they got fed-up of being one they decided to become what they are now? I have a friend who dropped out of school because he just didn't want to continue anymore. He was this close to finishing school,  this close . Yes, he father is a pastor. Sad, no? I don't really know the details. He could have become rebellious because of the lack of encouragement from his parents. Or perhaps he couldn't keep up with reputation nonsense and then just rebelled.     &nbsp;  Sure, I gotta admit sometimes you can feel people keep their eyes on you because your dad is a pastor. And it doesn't feel comfortable at all. They assume you do well in school, you at least play one music instrument, you read the Bible pray everyday and you're&nbsp;a leader in your CF or youth group. I don't think its on purpose, that they keep their eyes on you and pinpoint when you do make a mistake. Its human behaviour. Haha, yes human behaviour. I seem to blame the human behaviour for everything. :p&nbsp;    *'They' refers to the congregation, people who know your parent is a pastor    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  MPH is having a Young Writers Competition. You've to write a story about yourself. I'm thinking of entering. Not more than 800 words for my age group. I have an advantage, since I'm the oldest of my age group (age 13-15), and  perhaps, only perhaps  my maturity and two more years of experinece with my life  may  help. The thing is, its due next week, end of July. Today is the 24th of July. Hah all the best, Mary-Ruth!    Since you've to write about yourself, I'm thinking of telling the truth and writing my experience as a pastor's daughter, as the daughter of an eccentric writer and the sister of a seven year older psycho hyper genius.    Tell me, whoever reads this.. Do I have a chance? I need your feedback quick. Now I'm wondering who will read this my this weekend. Probably nobody. Haha oops. I mean, I doubt anyone comes here regularly. I just write because my fingers itch to fart out the blahblah in my head.     &nbsp;  *waves*    &nbsp;  Blahblah,   Mary-Root    &nbsp;

      Alright, I've calmed down and my mind seems more oblidged to let out its poop. Maybe just now was just a bout of painful constipation? Hmmm, not enough vegetables.   Manyak manyak hal telah berlaku dalam minggu ini. I feel pressured because a particular friend demands extreme attention from me. Sorry, I didn't mean to make her sound like baby whining for milk every two hours.. I think she just needs someone to talk and whine to, for entertainment, comfort, that sorta thing.  I got sick of it sometime last week. And I complained to SQ by smsing her. Haha SQ's response was funny you know. She didn't dare be direct to me. This was how it went: SQ: 'well, erm maybe you should tell her to give you your own space..'  and I said  M-R: "No, can't do that cos' I know she'd feel hurt" SQ: 'oh just tell her subtly la. should be fine wan' ....then I didn't reply till a few hours saying: M-R: "Hey, sorry I complained just now. I shouldn't. I should just bear with her, since thats what friends are for, to be there for each other." SQ: 'Haih, you know the answer adee wat. Nolar, you sounded so annoyed mah. So you should learn now..'  I've been puzzled why she didn't tell it straight to my face. She's pretty close, my spiritual accountability partner/friend actually, and she knew I wouldn't get hurt. And YET she just wouldn't say it. Why?   Talking bout indirectness, AL asked me a REAL direct question. You see, for quite some time AL had changed. I mean, like character change? Both AL and I are part of a group of friends- not exactly a clique but sorta, we do stuff together. And when AL changed, everyone in that 'group' noticed it and began talking about it. Nobody questioned her bout it, of course.. Nobody does. Come to think of it now, WHY? Why didn't we, as a group of AL's close friends, go up to her and ask why she was behaving differently... Anyway, back to topic.. That change thing was some months ago, she seems back to normal (?) if I may use the word.  And yesterday, AL and PK were talking in a corner, I joined them and listened. Suddenly AL asked me "Have you ever thought, at one time, that you didn't know me? Like I behaved differently, wasn't the AL you knew?" Wow, talk about hitting it right on the spot. Well, of course the answer is yes. PK was there as well, I knew her answer is yes. Strangely, she answered 'Not really', while I said 'Yes'. We kinda answered answered at the same time, and when PK heard my answer she looked at me but to be honest, I ignored her.  And then, it was time to go home, AL said we'd talk another time.   What puzzled me was that PK was one of those who  strongly  agreed that AL had changed just a few months back. And here she was saying 'Not really.' ?!?  Was she trying not to hurt AL's feelings when she said 'not really'? Or had she forgotten what had happened or.. life is full of stupid questions like this. And why am I the one who is asking?   Haha, that reminds me of what Alicia calls "Children's Politics". Not exactly politics, but what perhaps what politicians do? No, I wasn't referring to my case, it just you know, REMINDED me of it.  You know, I got lift back from Alicia after Church because the others had Worship Ministry meeting. Jonathan and Elaina were in the car as well. Duh. It's so interesting to see Jonathan and Alicia talk. Haha this sounds so absurd but I'm serious. They're so brotherly/sisterly in love, if I may. Ok ok, maybe  best friends  is a better word. Whatever, it's wonderful. =)  Nice to have your sibling as a best friend. Mine's great, just not my best friend. Probably cos' he's 7 years older than me. We can joke and fool around, no doubt, but nay, we can't talk talk. We do not go through the same stuff, he's so much more mature and I could never understand him. And me? I have so much nonsense on the surface he'd die of the stench before he got deeper. Is that how life is?  Speaking of my brother and our level of closeness, he's coming back this Wednesday. YAy!! M-R, say hello to lovely food, stupid jokes, and some dvds?  =D   *waves!!!!*

       The 4G House   Of all the four houses I lived in, 4G was without a doubt, my favouritest. It was the darling of darlings. It was located right in the middle of the old Johor Bahru town, on a slope. It was a typical old colonial bungalow you find around Malaysia, with the old window designs and that old smell you can never get rid of, not that you’d want to anyway.  The house was owned by the church we attended, Holy Light Presbyterian. And so when my dad joined the pastoral team, we were given an offer to stay to at 4G since it pretty near church. The senior pastor was the former resident and soon after he moved into his own house, we moved into 4G.  It wasn’t a pretty looking house when we first moved in. Sure, it had its old, cozy English look, but the huge rambutan tree was unkempt and the orchids planted around the compound looked horrendous with charcoal around the plant. There were 2 mongrels left behind by the pastor and his missus, Brown and Tiger, both female and extremely lovable. It was quite some months before we got the house up. Dad did some thorough work in the garden and soon he had some vegetable plants at the back, and loads of flowers up in front. The dogs used to dig up the plants and every morning, I would cringe at the sound of Brown howling when dad caned her. Haha, oh gosh, we caned our dogs.  We had a cat named Oscar, which we brought over from our Taman Suria house over to 4G. I doubt Oscar was used to living with two boisterous female dogs, but the dogs sure enjoyed him! When we moved, we drugged Oscar for a few hours, and when he woke up, we decided to let him out of the mobile cat kennel thing. Drowsily, he fumbled out and walked onto the grass, smelling cautiously around. When suddenly two huge brown furry things which smelt real bad came sniffing him, spraying saliva all over. THEY WERE DOGS!!!! Goodness you should have seen Oscar run. Never have I seen a cat run that fast. And he ran up the rambutan tree, not knowing whether they were anymore of these brown furry wet things around. That, I bet was the first time too that Oscar had ran up a tree. Me, being the lover and fusser of Oscar, checking on him every half an hour, and he refused to come down. I remember very clearly, he stayed up in that tree for 8 hours. Nah, we didn’t call the firemen.  That time, when we had moved to 4G, my bro had grown up and wasn’t so keen on playing guns and shooting stray cats with me anymore. He was in form 4 and had begun hanging out with the young adults from church. So I was left to look for companions to share my childhood curiousity with. My two neighbours Nina and Melissa were the ones. Strange though, what we used to do.. You’d never believe it. We used to make pancakes together and figure out weird recipes for our poor parents to try, or if it turned out horrible, we’d take it over to the Istana Gardens nearby and feed it to the ducks in the pond. Hehehehee.. Sigh, memories.. We would often go down to the Malay warung for breakfast too, the pak cik knew us well. His lontong was superb man. ;)  Besides that, we would just play our normal stuff, talk our girlie stuff and go to the old library up the hill every once in a while. They didn’t dare go too often because their photos were pinned up on the ‘Didn’t return library books’ section. Haha, killer times lah.  Back then, my parents let me out by myself more often. Nowadays, and I’m 15+ mind you, and I can’t even cycle round the next street. Sad betul… When my bro was in a happier mood, he’d take me for walks thru the nearby Malay kampung at the back of my house, then we’d go see the cemetery and the guy who carved the tombstones. Before going back, we would of course, buy some kuih kadok (toad kuih) before going back home. Hahaha. Most of the time, my brother would be out cycling by himself. Once, on Easter Day, he fell off his bike on a slope and broke two of his teeth. He breaks a lot of bones, don’t worry.  The house at the top of the hill had been doing renovations and leaving piles of sand by the roadside. So during the rainy season, it would wash the sand down to our road and since it blocked the drains, our whole house would get flooded. We used to curse that house a lot because after the flood cleared, wah, our house compound was one muddy swamp. And it happened quite a few times.  More on 4G later, have to study.

       Reminiscences – When we were young Part I   Man, I laughed so much during dinner last night, it felt good to laugh at stupid funny things again. Sam dared Philip to eat 3 green chili padis which he found in his maggi mee goreng. If Philip ate: One chili, Sam would belanja him a normal lunch Two chilies, Sam would belanja him buffet at Sunway Lagoon All three chilies, Sam would belanja him buffet at a KL hotel. Too bad tho, in the end the chilies weren’t hot hot hot.  I used to use scissors to cut of the rear end of flying ants. Sam used to experiment pressing fresh lizard poop and also watching lizards tails hopping about. Stephen used to eat cockroach eggs.  I enjoy talking about what I did when I was young. I am extremely proud of my childhood. Though still a city kid, I had more adventures than most.    The Suria House  We stayed in the Taman Suria house when I was 3 to 7 years old, it was small tiny terrace house. (you could see to the back once you stepped in) In front of our house, we had this huge, huge patch of tall lalang, it ran all along the side of a monsoon drain. My brother and I, we would often roam this tall patch of grass, looking for snakes, lizards, stray cats and nice birds. We even spotted a hornbill on the other side of the drain once! I remembered we would find a spot where we could walk to into the monsoon drain (there wasn’t much water, it was walkable) and look for slimy disgusting stuff that any boisterous 12 year old boy and 5 year old tomboyish girl would love. I still remember once, we found an eel in the drain and we took it back home. Oh, mind you, this monsoon drain we’re talking about is huge. 10 feet deep, perhaps? Or not, since it might have seemed bigger since I was smaller. During the very dry season, the huge patch of lalang would always catch fire, and the fire engine would come in the mid of the night and selamba-ly put it out. Then the next morning, my brother and I (you will be seeing this phrase a lot here) would go out and look for roasted carcasses. Heh heh. Chun la. Cat skeleton. Come on, which of you can boast that you’ve found a cat skeleton when you were 5? =) I guess all these experiences have made deep impacts on my life and what I want to do later on. Wednesday was pasar malam day in our area. Most of the stalls were Malay and my bro and me would go around making friends with the stall owners. Hehe. There was this stall which fried chicken, fried cow lungs and our favourite fried chicken backside! They sold them for like 10 for a buck. It was super worth-it. My bro and I would split 20 between us and then we would take the bag to the padang behind our house and sit at the lil atap hut and eat our chicken backsides. Then we’d get rid of the plastic bag and walk innocently home. I don’t know why we hid it but we did. It sounds so funny now though. Oh, don’t worry, we confessed to our parents a few years ago. Hahaha.
