         ok so its official that NO ONE visits my blog ... which is very depressing people. my life must be just as dull to other people as it is to me. meh. so i didnt make cheerleading. no surprise there. just my luck to be able to do a lib just fine in the practise room but when i get in front of judges i can barely remember how to stand let alone balance one one leg. wutever i'll just have no life !!! i have no talents ... and practically all my friends made cheerleading. how depressing is that? i guess im just NOT a cheerleader. maybe i'll try out next year. i might as well. i have nothing to lose now haha. i'll just roam around the halls next year ... sigh. gota go now. im gonna rot away listening to fall out boy and yellowcard. chow

      heyyyy .... its me .... ofcourse. so last night i ended up going to nat's house to watch the movie 13. i reccommend it ppl its real good! scary, creepy, very realistic, but good! so neway me and bri felt real cool last night cuz nat wanted us at her house, nate (my boyfriend) wanted us to go the movies with his "guys" lol,and then nile called bri and was like "hey wanna come to our party?" haha so we wanted to go but we already has promised nat we'd go to her house so thats wut we did. but when we were there we were going for a walk (we always do ;)) and we like ran into all the freshman which was cool cuz yea.. HOTT! so we all walk back to nats and she locks them out and me and bri too so we start walking back when nat calls and says bernie is home and like me and bri freak out and have to like run as fast as we can back to her house .... lol and leave the guys. which sucked. hopefully they're not mad. so todays sunday. sundays are boring. real boring. i already went to church and did nursery duty. and now im home. and my mom just yelled at me cuz im supposed to be doing my homework . UGH i have that HUGE constitution test real soon and i DO NOT wanna take it and im so NOT ready! but i better go. bbl kisses

      cough cough  so this pretty much only applies to girls ... or ... i guess it applies to the guy region aswell. cuz u guys like use cologne and stuff. ugh just for the record guys, those axe commercials are so totally right! i dno about other girls but the smell of axe on a guy totally makes me want them!! lol i dno why its like an initial reaction. so ANYWAYS im sittin here trying desperately to figure out a way to make myself smell wonderful. i mean its way easy to smell good for like 10 minutes after u shower and spray on some "after shower" stuff. but im talkin like smelling good for hours and hours and hours. not only good like clean ... i mean good like girly. like the way guys think girls should smell. so i figured out a combination that i believe will work. it better neways cuz it took alot of planning on my part. but neways, so i used some yummy smelling body wash in the shower. just for the fun of it cuz everyone knows that body wash washes off ... the yummy smell does too! so neways i get out of the shower and lotion my legs (a must for after shaving) but i also lotiond like my shoulders and things ... i dno why i just did! so i get into my room and apply some of my smelly dust for vici sercret. to top it off i spray my CLOTHES not my body w/ some yummy mist cuz it stays on the fabric better then it stays on skin. i am also not blowdrying my hair in hopes that i'll still smell like shampoo. now just for one last note on the topic ppl ... i used everything VERY SPARINGLY !! no joke like u dont even know how sparingly. so dont think im like a grandma who smells to strong. nu-uh i was muy careful. but im gona go now put clothes on! tata and God Bless

(minus lisa which sucked) and it was grand. right now im grandma sitting (like baby sittin but w / my grandma instead) and im listening to her tell my dogs this story about a young man that asked her to "twist" with him and how happy she was because she "Loves to dance" and then she does her creepy jiggly cleavage laugh. mmmm .... i've heard this story wut like 5000000 times. nasty. but i must run now. i'll prolly blog again in what like 10 minutes! lol kisses

         hey there eeer'one. sooo yea i still have to like totally describe every little thing i did on my missions trip. (To be like lisa... muah haha) okay brb lemme get my journal (where i wrote it all down) and then i'll tell bout all my days! aren't you excited?? of course you are! brb  phew that was fast!! okay im back ... so here it goes!  Sunday: we all gathered at the church and got in our lil vans w / our groups and drove and drove and drove to the church (new hope) in humboldt park. i have NO IDEA wut time we got there ... but all we did was worshipped and like bed-stuff. fun fun  Monday: On Monday my group (Beijing) went to Cabriny Green. We just like cleaned some major nasty bathrooms (we're talkin like poo water up the wazoo here ppl)and then we used these big scrapers to scrape all the tile off of the floor and this girl in my group named jessica like totally got her finger all cut up and had to get 6 stitches. muah haha. then frida gave us this tour of like the projects where they live and man ... wow ppl ... just wow!!   Tuesday: Okay well  on tuesday we went to HOME which was like this old folks home for old people who like can't afford homes. ya know? but ugh we washed ALL the floorboards and walls, baseboards, doors, doorframes, etc etc etc. i mean common who really cares if their DOOR is dusty. but hey working for the Lord here ppl! hehe but neways me and michelle had to wash the deck and we kinda got in trouble for sprayin dan and juice w / the hose ... shh!! We got done early so we all went to the zoo and then to Ben and Jerry's for icecream (chubby hubby all the way baby)  Wednesday: YAY! today we actually got to be with kids!! whooo hoo! we went to Leif Ericson elementary school and got to be w / the kids there! omg cayon my lil boyfriend was so cute and i was totally in love w / him!! aww and they all thought (cuz we told them) that me and dan were gettin married and dan was 20 and i was 15 and they were all like "omg ur way to young" and it was so cute! one lil girl gave me her address so i could mail her an invitation! so yeah wednesday was def the funnest but it was really sad too. cuz like we were working w / like 3rd graders and they're teacher was like yelling and screaming at them and totally cutting them down ... 3rd graders fail 3rd grade at this school. how sad is that?   Thursday: Thursday we went to Independance Park to clean and stuff and we divided into groups within Beijein and first Jessica and I cleaned these totally nasty bathrooms (yea me on bathroom duty AGAIN) and to everyone out there whos afraid of spiders (michelle scandora lol) you woulda DIED! i mean i died and there was this one spider and im not kidding he was HUGE but he was like perched on the toilet seat and i was supposed to clean it and i was just like "okay i'll just leave you there cuz im afraid of you" real scary. but then after our dumb blond joke break brad pitt and i went into this basement of the old park district building to move stuff around and such and the guy said we could take wutever we wanted cuz there were these totallly vintage (like 1980's) sports uniforms and i tried on this hat but when i took it off this GIGANTIC spider crawled down my face ... so i didnt take nething . no siree bob. eew. lol but that day was fun cuz we got done early and played at the park.   Friday: on friday (our last "work" day) we went this like HUGE chicago food pantry thing and were on this assembly line w/ a conveyor belt and we boxed over like 500 boxes of food in 2 hours! oh yeah baby. we got done early (we're fast workers) so we ate lunch at Grant Park and all made wishes in the fountain. Awww  Saturday: the last day ... sniff... sniff ... sniff. we all got in the vans said good bye to our home (the church) and went to the zoo or the beach (your preferance) fun times lol~~ (shoulder sit)  and then we came home. ugh  THERE PEOPLE HOW WAS THAT?? i just have to say 2 things before i end my lil adode to the missions trip... BeBiz .. and double-saulting. oooh yeah   so last night i went to lisas after natalie came over. julie was there too and we all went to dtw. then j.t. called my cell so we hooked up w / him and some of his friends . lol mm hmm! i talked to **** last night :-D i gota go now. kisses to all~

      im so so so so so SORRY! i haven't blogged in so long! i mean ... i know that to some people my blog is their life ... and to those people ... well they haven't been living ... and im SORRY! but im back and i wont forget again! (thanks twiggy for reminding me) so at the moment im listening to my favorite song of the moment. i dont know wut its called but it goes a lil something like this :  "i'm tryin to keep my feet on the ground .im gettin to like this feeling i've found. i'm gettin to love the thought of having you around . and i will never let you down." do any of you know that song? see i kind of love it to death . and it stops like half way through cuz bri SUCKS at burning cd's so i have to keep pressing repeat and listening to the same 2 minutes and 25 seconds of it over and over and over. not that i mind at all though! so did you all know that i got dumped? im not sure if i've told you yet. well yeah nathan dumped me so i better change my profile . [sigh] he claims it was because im a homo. but what i find quite ironic (and im sure you all will too) is that he dumped ME for being a homo ... but the girl he has a fancy for now (lauren) is know for making out with her girlfriends ... hmmm ... now humor me people ... WHOS THE GOSH DAMN HOMO ?????????? sigh ... sorry had to vent a bit there. whooo. lalala. its amazing how good that made me feel. stupid boys. wutever. i dont neeeeeed a boy. although some of my close gallies know that im already looking at someone. however i would like to stress the fact that i am in fact JUST LOOKING! like a rich woman window shopping for her children at khols .. shes just looking ... shed NEVER buy it. see wut i mean? lol i know im great at analogys. i must go now im afraid of my life. wait ... is it supposed to be afraid FOR my life. wutever kisses ~D~

      so last night. was the best night. of my life. im not even joking i had so much fun and i cried so hard and then i has so much fun again! lol. let me explain. so last night our school had the 8th grade dinner/dance. it was a beach theme so of course i bought leis and a grass skirt (a pretty pink one w/ yellow flowers) and all my friends wore real skirts (all mine are too short) and we went to this thing. our commons area was all decorated w/ like palm trees and beach balls and all our teachers dressed up like cruise people and boat captains and stuff and it was really cute! so we ate and then the DJ put on the cha cha slide! lol great fun great fun. so that got everyone out of their seats (well almost everyone. certain people like nate and the bball boys dont enjoy dancing!) and everyone was dancing. then they turned on like hot in herr and all those kind of songs and boy was it fun! everyone was like grinding and wow i cant even explain how fun it was. people were throwing ice cream and cake all around so everyone was all slimy and hot and sweaty and messy and happy and dancing. muah haha how much fun is that?!?! so after we danced for like 2 hours they brought us into the gym for a 1/2 hour movie of like pictures of all of us from now to 6th grade. it was so sad and everyone was like cheering for peoples pictures and then the graduation song came on (vitamin c) and it was so sad thinking about how we're leaving and goin to highschool and everything and i started crying lol! alot of other people did too and by the time we were back in the commons (leaving) everyone was crying and hugging and it was really cute cuz people from like different "groups" were crying and hugging eachother and all the guys were comforting us and wow. it was real fun. so afterwards we all went to caileys and partied till like 12 there! haha thats always fun. we just like dance and wrestled and acted crazy alot. but yeah that was my night. im gonna miss everyone. and i swear to god monroe people that im not gonna leave you all !!!! i cant wait till school next year and i hope i see everyone all summer cuz im so sad. derrick harris is moving so everyone was crying becuase of that too. hes so cool . ugh. but the night was fun and special. and i have to go take a shower now. peace  Graduation (Friends Forever)"  And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives Where we're gonna be when we turn 25 I keep thinking times will never change Keep on thinking things will always be the same But when we leave this year we won't be coming back No more hanging out cause we're on a different track And if you got something that you need to say You better say it right now cause you don't have another day Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down These memories are playing like a film without sound And I keep thinking of that night in June  I didn't know much of love But it came too soon And there was me and you And then we got real cool Stay at home talking on the telephone with me We'd get so excited, we'd get so scared Laughing at our selves thinking life's not fair And this is how it feels  {1} - As we go on We remember All the times we Had together And as our lives change Come whatever We will still be Friends Forever  So if we get the big jobs And we make the big money When we look back now Will our jokes still be funny? Will we still remember everything we learned in school? Still be trying to break every single rule Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man? Can we ever find a job that won't interfere with a tan? I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye Keep on thinking it's a time to fly And this is how it feels  {Repeat 1}  La, la, la, la: Yeah, yeah, yeah La, la, la, la: We will still be friends forever  Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now? Can we survive it out there? Can we make it somehow? I guess I thought that this would never end And suddenly it's like we're women and men Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round? Will these memories fade when I leave this town I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye Keep on thinking it's a time to fly  {Repeat 1 (3x)}  ~dee~

        hello and welcom to sunday's blog. ho-hum. i'm trying so desperately hard to think of wtf i did the rest of saturday ... lemme think lemme think ... okkay well i think this is what happend ... shortly after that post (1ish i believe) julie came over and blessed me with her presence ... mwa haha  and we like pretty much did absolutely nothing till around 5 when we decided that it was prolly time to shower and so (we) did and afterwards when we were chillaxin in our robes drinkin some ice-java we did notice   rob,matt, and justin walking back and forth in front of my house wearin clothes that definetly weren't normal and carrying tree branches ... big ones ... i dno ppls maybe we were halucinating and then natalie and mannie called wonderin wtf was taking us so long so they came over while we dressed and did hair   and then the 4 of us mozied down to DTW to hang out with david and marc / erik and zach ... lol DTW where the pay phone mysteriously rang and i ended up havin an extremely long conversation with a mystery man that creepily knew WAY too much about me (today i figured out it was trevor adesko or however the f*** you spell that)   after DTW we came home and ju and nat slept over (arm couldnt boo hooo) and umm ... lets just say the tent sleepover was extremely fun ... i can't post why ... it just wouldnt be politically correct. so today was sunday and therefore we had to go to church so we all woke up around 7:30ish and&nbsp;showerd (me and ju ... natalie), made cimmamin rolls, and went to church.   it was our first like STUDENT BODY thingy so it was scary at first but ended up being really fun. i'd like to mention so that i dont forget that LISA WE SANG "YOU SAID" AND I WAS FREAKIN ... THEY MADE FUN OF HOW HAPPY I WAS ... PPL WHO DIDNT GO ON FULL SERVICE JUST DONT UNDERSTAND !!! okay and after church ryan and marc came over for a bit,   lol they left and we went to Target ... bought an 80 pack of tampons and a 20 pack for the gentler conception ... is conception the right word?? i dno lol lets just hope ... then natalie had to leave and ju and i&nbsp;went on a bicycle ride down to the skate park to check out the skaters which ended up bein real fun cuz like nico, seth, kevin, and brian were there (along with jake and many others)   so we hung there for a bit till we finally came home (really hot) and went over to natalies where timmy (my architect italian husband) and erik (julie's whore) came over to watch little mermaid with us ... we tried teachin natalie how to dance at least the tiniest bit normal ... key word tried. and   now ... well now im home !!! and i'm goin to sleep cuz we have an early mornin at the skate park tomorrow! ;) haha fun times fun times. oh and if the person who pranked my cell today is readin this it didn't phase me and it never will okay?&nbsp; xoxo ~meri~

      well it has come to my attention that all these quizzes and meme's that i take have an odd tendancy to come up quite similiar. they all believe that i'm heartsick ... that i need love ... one says im the perfect girlfriend :-D ... and ofcourse theres the one that says im a slut. hehehe so why do i do them? you could say that i'm finding myself. or you could just say that i'm bored and friendless with nothing better to do. or you could say that its so much fricken fun and u'd do it too if you had any common sense what-so-ever. sometime i worry about strangers coming to my blog and wut they would think of it. or even not strangers but hot older guys ... i wonder wut they would think of how extremely odd i am. hehehe ... hahahaha ... muah hahaha. kisses

      i hate this ... its so effing gay. im not gonna publish my frickin life on this frikin lil blog thing so don't expect me to. all i can say is that so many ppl think im this horrible person for "ditching" my friends again. they dont know wut happend. hell i dont even know wut happend. wut i do know is that i wasnt trying to ditch neone but im sure as hell not gonna bust my butt gettin something back that they felt was so easy to lose. how would you feel if ur best friend told you that since she "knew" your friendship wasn't gonna last she's decided it'd be easier to let go first before SHE got hurt. wtf is that. who got hurt? who got hurt? eff you all i dont need this. p.s. milan kicks ass and i love it here . bye

       hello everyone. i am sooooooooooooooooooooo TIRED. see we have this rule in my house where you can't have more then one sleep over in a row - last night i broke that rule cuz julie slept over again ... now i see why. i am sooo tired.   julie being the lil booger she is is still asleep in the bungalow. i will wake her when i feel its worth while. so last night we made dinner (breaded chicken , mashed potatoes, salad, and bread) and   then we headed over to ryan javechs where i got to see ANITA AND GIOVANNA again finally and we watched armagedon ... im sure it woulda been good if we had been watching it lol.   lol then my daddy picked us up ... and had quite a few HILARIOUS comments for example: "wuts up with ****" me: "wut do u mean" dad: "hes short and his hair is sticky-0uty" me: "hes taller then me dad - and i like his hair" dad: "well your a girl you have an excuse to be short" me:"why dont u like short boys dad?" dad:"they make me nervous ... (he twiddles his thumbs) ... i dont like munchkins"   HAHA i dno why but that really made me giggle. my brother called yesterday from jail ... that was interesting - he was in jail for pullin an "the outsiders" and hopin on one of those cargo train thingys ... haha sucker.   it makes me really sad that people hate me so much. i can completely honestly say that i dont HATE anyone. i sure as hell dislike some people - but non without due cause. and here i am on other ppls tag boards and my own and everyones liek "i hate meri i hate meri" and im like "wow that makes me feel so warm and fuzzy inside"   cuz honestly i KNOW i haven't personally done something to all those people - and if i've forgiven everyone i had issues with ... why cant they?  i dno i guess it just bugs me ...  alot ... makes it hard ... to sleep at night ... ;-)   but im gona run cuz i think julies gona be wakin up pretty soon like and  i dno .. i have no more to day. bye bye ~meri~

        the closet. hmm ... ?? if you know me and you know my house/room you know the closet.  aaaah the closet. everyone who loves me LOVES the closet. its big ... yellow ... and you write on the walls.   at first when my mommy told me to clean and vaccuum my closet i didn't think twice about it and then i realized : to prove to mommy   that i cleaned the closet ... she was going to have to look in it AAAAH!! DOOM !!! the closet says naughty things lol ... it says wut me and my friends truly think about people.   and ofcourse since i am infact meri anderson and i do have the worst luck of anyone i know - my mom is going to look at the closet.   when she gets home. in 2 hours. to me - the closet is a work of art - the thoughts, drawings, and love portrayed through the closet are   truly moving. to mommy - she'll freak. so i guess you could say i'm a bit worried. but i LOVE the closet i love love love it.   and i'm quite positive that if you asked any of my friends they in turn would say they love the closet. so maybe i'm wrong - maybe mommy will see the closet as a work of art as i do -   or maybe she'll freak out the butt. we'll just have to see. lololol. cleaning the closet is actually fun. i'm just clearin out the crap and vaccuuming it ... i'm also   re-setting up the candles and making a "signing station" so that we will never be without a writin utensil while in the closet.   sigh. i am going to go now though ... to clean the closet ... o beloved closet. please everyone pray for the closet ... or that mommy has dust in her eyes and doesnt read the walls.   amen.        ~Dee~      *****       :-D
