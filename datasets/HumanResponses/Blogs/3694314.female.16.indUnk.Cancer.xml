      I'm not an extreemly religious person. Call me curious. But i have to thank Juilian for recomending this "forgotten Gospel" to me. These are the secret sayings that the living Jesus spoke and Didymos Judas Thomas recorded.  1 And he said, "Whoever discovers the interpretation of these sayings will not taste death."  2 Jesus said, "Those who seek should not stop seeking until they find. When they find, they will be disturbed. When they are disturbed, they will marvel, and will reign over all. [And after they have reigned they will rest.]"  3 Jesus said, "If your leaders say to you, 'Look, the (Father's) kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the kingdom is within you and it is outside you.  When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will understand that you are children of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and you are the poverty."  4 Jesus said, "The person old in days won't hesitate to ask a little child seven days old about the place of life, and that person will live.  For many of the first will be last, and will become a single one."  5 Jesus said, "Know what is in front of your face, and what is hidden from you will be disclosed to you.  For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed. [And there is nothing buried that will not be raised."]  6 His disciples asked him and said to him, "Do you want us to fast? How should we pray? Should we give to charity? What diet should we observe?"  Jesus said, "Don't lie, and don't do what you hate, because all things are disclosed before heaven. After all, there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and there is nothing covered up that will remain undisclosed."  7 Jesus said, "Lucky is the lion that the human will eat, so that the lion becomes human. And foul is the human that the lion will eat, and the lion still will become human."  8 And he said, The person is like a wise fisherman who cast his net into the sea and drew it up from the sea full of little fish. Among them the wise fisherman discovered a fine large fish. He threw all the little fish back into the sea, and easily chose the large fish. Anyone here with two good ears had better listen!  9 Jesus said, Look, the sower went out, took a handful (of seeds), and scattered (them). Some fell on the road, and the birds came and gathered them. Others fell on rock, and they didn't take root in the soil and didn't produce heads of grain. Others fell on thorns, and they choked the seeds and worms ate them. And others fell on good soil, and it produced a good crop: it yielded sixty per measure and one hundred twenty per measure.  10 Jesus said, "I have cast fire upon the world, and look, I'm guarding it until it blazes."  11 Jesus said, "This heaven will pass away, and the one above it will pass away.  The dead are not alive, and the living will not die. During the days when you ate what is dead, you made it come alive. When you are in the light, what will you do? On the day when you were one, you became two. But when you become two, what will you do?"  12 The disciples said to Jesus, "We know that you are going to leave us. Who will be our leader?"  Jesus said to them, "No matter where you are you are to go to James the Just, for whose sake heaven and earth came into being."  13 Jesus said to his disciples, "Compare me to something and tell me what I am like."  Simon Peter said to him, "You are like a just messenger."  Matthew said to him, "You are like a wise philosopher."  Thomas said to him, "Teacher, my mouth is utterly unable to say what you are like."  Jesus said, "I am not your teacher. Because you have drunk, you have become intoxicated from the bubbling spring that I have tended."  And he took him, and withdrew, and spoke three sayings to him. When Thomas came back to his friends they asked him, "What did Jesus say to you?"  Thomas said to them, "If I tell you one of the sayings he spoke to me, you will pick up rocks and stone me, and fire will come from the rocks and devour you."  14 Jesus said to them, "If you fast, you will bring sin upon yourselves, and if you pray, you will be condemned, and if you give to charity, you will harm your spirits.  When you go into any region and walk about in the countryside, when people take you in, eat what they serve you and heal the sick among them.  After all, what goes into your mouth will not defile you; rather, it's what comes out of your mouth that will defile you."  15 Jesus said, "When you see one who was not born of woman, fall on your faces and worship. That one is your Father."  16 Jesus said, "Perhaps people think that I have come to casy peace upon the world. They do not know that I have come to cast conflicts upon the earth: fire, sword, war.  For there will be five in a house: there'll be three against two and two against three, father against son and son against father, and they will stand alone.  17 Jesus said, "I will give you what no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, what no hand has touched, what has not arisen in the human heart."  18 The disciples said to Jesus, "Tell us, how will our end come?"  Jesus said, "Have you found the beginning, then, that you are looking for the end? You see, the end will be where the beginning is.  Congratulations to the one who stands at the beginning: that one will know the end and will not taste death."  19 Jesus said, "Congratulations to the one who came into being before coming into being.  If you become my disciples and pay attention to my sayings, these stones will serve you.  For there are five trees in Paradise for you; they do not change, summer or winter, and their leaves do not fall. Whoever knows them will not taste death."  20 The disciples said to Jesus, "Tell us what Heaven's kingdom is like."  He said to them, It's like a mustard seed, the smallest of all seeds, but when it falls on prepared soil, it produces a large plant and becomes a shelter for birds of the sky.  21 Mary said to Jesus, "What are your disciples like?"  He said, They are like little children living in a field that is not theirs. when the owners of the field come, they will say, "Give us back our field." They take off their clothes in front of them in order to give it back to them, and they return their field to them.  For this reason I say, if the owners of a house know that a thief is coming, they will be on guard before the thief arrives and will not let the thief break into their house (their domain) and steal their possessions.  As for you, then, be on guard against the world. Prepare yourselves with great strength, so the robbers can't find a way to get to you, for the trouble you expect will come.  Let there be among you a person who understands.  When the crop ripened, he came quickly carrying a sickle and harvested it. Anyone here with two good ears had better listen!  22 Jesus saw some babies nursing. He said to his disciples, "These nursing babies are like those who enter the kingdom."  They said to him, "Then shall we enter the kingdom as babies?"  Jesus said to them, "When you make the two into one, and when you make the inner like the outer and the outer like the inner, and the upper like the lower, and when you make male and female into a single one, so that the male will not be male nor the female be female, when you make eyes in place of an eye, a hand in place of a hand, a foot in place of a foot, an image in place of an image, then you will enter [the kingdom]."  "It will not come by watching for it. It will not be said, 'Look, here!' or 'Look, there!' Rather, the Father's kingdom is spread out upon the earth, and people don't see it."   I know thats long and theirs more if you want to read it fully just type in the gospel of thomas in yahoo,ask.com,goggle,or which ever you prefer. Once again thanx Juilian even though your probably not reading this. Later Dayz  Be Safe DarkPoet Danielle Martin DM Peace

      My mercy has limits  You're still my enemy tonight, but even enemies can show respect  Honor the gods, love your woman and defend your country. Before my time is done I will look down on your corpse and smile    *My Three Favorites     Before you came to Sparta, I was a ghost. I walked and I ate and I swam in the sea... I was just a ghost.    Men will hunt us, the gods will curse us, but I'll love you. Until the day they burn my body, I'll love you.    If killing is your only talent, that's your curse. I don't want anyone dying for me.   May the Gods keep the wolves in the hills and the women in our beds  Men are haunted by the vastness of eternity. and so we ask ourselves: will our actions echo across centuries?  I can't imagine life without you

        ~Imaginary~ You're creative and often daydream. You build your own little world whether it's a bad or a good day, you can always escape to. You believe dreams are the best thing reality has to offer. You prefer the art of illusion over what drones have made the real world out to be. Life can be tough and you know this. Somedays you hate the world and somedays you can tolerate it. You love imagination and the mind, for this is where you can mold your idea of how things should be.

'Love isn't finding the perfect person, it's finding the imperfect person perfect' 'People are like stained glass windows: they sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light within' 'The rain of my soul are the thoughts that drown within me, tears are the raindrops to let the world see.' ' Sticks and Stones are hard on bones, aimed with angry art. Words can sting like anything, but silence breaks the heart.' 'A brighter light casts a darker shadow' 'A girl and a guy can be just friends, but at one point or another they will fall for each other.

       Cancer is symbolized by the Crab. You're deeply emotional and intuitive, and your top concern is family. Something of a homebody, you prefer to stay in rather than go out on the town. You can be moody, drawing into your protective shell if things get too intense around you.   Element: Water      The Element of Water is associated with the Signs   urlLink  Cancer   ,   urlLink  Scorpio    and   urlLink  Pisces   , and it also rules the   urlLink  Fourth   ,   urlLink  Eighth    and   urlLink  Twelfth    Houses. The watery words flow with this Element: fluid, flowing, wavering. These terms can easily apply to an individual's emotions, which are exactly the realm in which Water exerts its influence. Water Signs are intuitive, sensitive and feel more intensely than the rest. They are emotional and nurturing and, like a river, run deep. How things feel is what matters to these folks, and they base their actions on sense, rather than on logic or intellect. Water is also about compassion and understanding, since the receptive talents of these individuals are remarkably high. Water Sign people can take in the feelings of others, process them, and put forth a plan or solution that will be conscientious to all. Those graced by Water love to take their sense of the world and translate it into the artistic. They desire aesthetic beauty -- and for everyone to be happy as a result of that beauty. Much like still water can become stagnant, however, an inactive Water Sign person is not a Water Sign person at their best. Water Signs feel most fulfilled when they are helping others, and they do so in an enchanting, considerate and even romantic way. The flip side of this dreamy Water world is the tendency of these individuals to brood. Water Signs are susceptible to mood swings, and, at their worst, they could become self-indulgent, controlling and hostage to a fantasy world. This also brings up the ability of these folks to see things more clearly than others. Call it psychic, if you will. Water Signs are emotional, empathetic, receptive and feel things deeply. Alternately calm like the sea or possessing the force of a torrential rain, the emotions brought forth by this Element are plentiful, indeed.    Quality: Cardinal      A Cardinal Quality is attached to the Signs   urlLink  Aries   ,   urlLink  Cancer   ,   urlLink  Libra    and   urlLink  Capricorn   . The Cardinal Houses are the   urlLink  First   ,   urlLink  Fourth   ,   urlLink  Seventh    and   urlLink  Tenth   ; if an astrological chart shows a preponderance of Planets in these Houses, its energy is weighted toward cardinality. Cardinal Signs are the initiators of the Zodiac. They are also found at key jumping-off points on the chart wheel, specifically the   urlLink  Ascendant   , Medium Coeli (M.C. or Midheaven), Descendant and Imum Coeli (I.C.). Individuals possessing a Cardinal Quality like to get things going. They are active, quick and ambitious. Many projects get started, thanks to Cardinal initiative, although a good deal of them are never finished. That's because Cardinal folks are much fonder of starting things than finishing them. You won't find a Cardinal person slacking off. These people are full of vim and vigor and possess a drive and ambition that is unmistakable. Enthusiasm and a zest for life fill the Cardinal individual. Some might perceive this rampant energy as domineering, and, at times, it can be. Cardinal people can easily forget about the rest of the pack when they are busily focusing on their own endeavors. Even so, their energetic spirit often wins the day. Cardinal folks are clever and want to win. They love to start things, and whether they finish them or not, there's always a lot going on. Nay sayers who find them to be too self-centered will simply have to watch (and marvel) as they speed by!   Ruling House:Fourth      House of Family and HomeThe Fourth House is commonly referred to as the House of Home. When we think of home, we think of that place where we put down our roots. We lay our foundation and plant ourselves firmly into the Earth, as it were. One day, we will return to that very same Earth. The Fourth House brings things full circle by also addressing old age, endings and our final resting place. Much of the emphasis of the Fourth House, however, is on the concept of home. By laying down roots, we make a home for ourselves, or more specifically, the self. It's worth noting that in addition to the external home (all the bricks and mortar around us), we have really brought the essential self home. 'I'm home.' The words themselves have a peaceful ring to them. The self is now centered, grounded, one and at peace with the Earth. We seek to come home both physically and psychically, for ourselves and for those we love. By creating home, we create a meeting place, a sanctuary, a sacred place for ourselves and for others. In our home, we integrate the self with all that has come before us and helped to shape what we are today. We create a domestic space which comforts and nurtures us and serves to keep safe those we love. Also important here are family history, cultural and societal norms, and ways of being. All of these are ruled by the Fourth House, as are our ancestry, roots and heritage. These qualities are brought 'home' through us and integrated into the place we call home. Helping to create the home we make are our parents, for it is they who greatly nurture and shape our being. Therefore, the Fourth House can also be thought of as the House of the Mother, the Parent or the Nurturer. Looking at things from a strictly tangible point of view, we can see that the Fourth House also encompasses physical structures (houses) and real estate. The Fourth House represents family, history and traditions. All of these contribute to the process of becoming a true, actualized and individualized self. This is how we come home. The Fourth House is ruled by the Sign Cancer and the Moon.   Ruling Planets: The Moon     The Moon: Ruler of the Emotions Since the Moon is the closest 'Planet' to Earth, this satellite literally zips around the Zodiac, completing its circuit in less than a month. It also touches us more deeply than most Planets. As the ruler of the tides, it is fitting that the Moon should be the ruler of our emotions. Still waters run deep? Making waves? A wellspring of emotion? Yes, our emotions have long been portrayed in terms of the sea: fluid, momentous, churning from within. Mood swings, instinct, how we feel about things and how our feelings affect others are all influenced by the Moon. Whereas the Sun gives us our spirit, it's the Moon which gives us our soul. The Moon is goddess-like in that it symbolizes mother and the relationship between woman and child. This Planet (also known as a luminary) speaks to the women in one's life and their role as nurturer. Fertility, pregnancy and childbirth are also governed by the Moon. We see the Moon casting its silvery glow from our earliest moments, when we were stroked and caressed by our mother and felt her tender touch. Our emotions manifest themselves through our being and set the tone for our daily lives. The Moon is party to this continuum, rendering us vital one moment and fragile the next. We're up and down, naughty or nice, and may laugh wildly or cry at will. Through the Moon's energy, we endeavor to reconcile these varied emotions in order to make ourselves complete and one with the world. The Moon also helps us see that which we want, and to use memory and the past as part of this process. The Moon spends roughly 2 1/2 days in each sign and takes 28 days to circumnavigate the Zodiac. It is feminine energy and rules   urlLink  Cancer    and the   urlLink  Fourth House   .

        You have an angry soul! Angry Souls arent always angry, but they cannot easily forgive and hold grudges. You probably often get in fights with your friends and family, and its difficult for you to understand. When someone makes a mistake, you dont let go easily and hold on to those memories. Your very stubborn and your rage is known to everyone. Though you never actually mean it, you can say mean things in a fight and go over board. Many people are sometimes intimidated by your anger. But you have many redeeming qualities and those are that you are quite intelligent and smart. You would make a good businesswoman or lawyer because you know how to prove your point. You cherish the ones around you, and appreciate life, even though you can complain or throw a tantrum now and then. The good things is, you keep your emotions very outspoken, and are normally a very happy person because all your rage is let on the outside. Anger is simply a state, but you, yourself as a person, are great.   urlLink  What Kind of SOUL do you posses? (For Girls only) Incredible Anime Pictures!    brought to you by

        Lonliness dominates you. You can hide it well, but its there, and your friends can see it. You constantly feel alone, and need to do things to fill your time. Your afraid to tell people this, but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way, and you think you screwed up everything. And when you are in love is when you are sad the most.

      I hate&nbsp;school with a major passion. it is an unrealistic attempt at making humans out of idiotic baffoons. (not u goys of course).  This asswipe at my school called me a rasist. i'm like yeah i'm black and i'm racist. people ar constantly treating me like shit and the teacher doesn't even bother to correct them, but i guess i should be used to it. its been going on for more than half my life. i mean last year this motherfucking asswhole drug dealin little imbicile called me a nigger and all my principle did was tell his parents. God i just wish that i could move to london where nobody knows me and write music and poetry music in some obscure little coffe shop.   i never knew how dramatic i was until read over that paragraph. but seriously somtimes i can't take my life i get treated like insignifigant&nbsp;little pion&nbsp;at school and like i'm shit at home. 2 more years then i'm free from all this drama and hurt and pain and blah.   its exaughsting being so gosh darn depressed. i wish i were happy,   &nbsp;  any way my quote for the day is  Life is like a box a chocolates you never no which one your gonna get(forrest gump, which i have not seen)  no seriously its:   Overcome all boundries to become the person you know you can be. Its all up to u don't let jealousy, pain, or lazyness bring you down. In the end its all worth it. (Meeeeee!)   Later dAYS&nbsp;  darkpoet  dm  danielle

      love is something that everyone needs.  Family supposedly has an obligation to love one another, and one might argue a wife must love her husband.   “You love your family in a different way than you do your husband, because there are more layers to romantic love,”.  “Loyalty, protectiveness, and affection are all present amongst family.  But with a husband, there can be stirring amounts of possessiveness, lust, and even hate.”  Hate is a strong emotion, and though it might be considered the opposite of love, it is one of the strongest feelings a person has.  Romantic love is not always happiness.  Love can cause you to end your own life.  Love can tear friends, family, and even countries apart.  Love can bring out the absolute worst in people.”   Even though love is fear, anxiety, jealousy, confusion, frustration, and confusion, it is strong enough to tie up every other emotion in its path,".  “Love is complete and utter chaos.  It means a thousand different things to a thousand different people, but when you love someone you invest yourself emotionally in their feelings and that never changes.”

      Don't label me! Don't look at me and blankly place me into a category like I'm an inanimate, insignificant item on a store shelf. I am not a Goth or Punk, a Raver or Freak. I'm just a unique human being with enough mental toughness and ambition to feel no inhibition in being myself to the fullest. Don't judge me on my choice and style of clothing. I am not your verbal pincushion for you to vent your frustrations on. You look and see weakness in profound individuality and it eats at you. Look away if it scares you. Look away if you see someone that's broken the mold to normality and you feel distress concerning where you would like to categorically place me.   Most of the time the people labeling are those who openly call themselves, "Preps." Maybe it goes with the territory? "Look at me in my Abercrombie and Fitch, check out my new Tommy Hilfiger gear. I am like, so Prep now, tee-hee!" And to each their own. The corporate machine is what decides the in-fashion and most desirable name brand clothing to own. All the beauty and glamour magazines that are aimed at teens to 20 and 30-somethings are guilty as well. Making it seem as if it's a sin not to be a size 1 or less, making people feel socially unacceptable if they don't buy and use the newest trendy makeup brand. Followers feed it, it will only grow bigger and bigger. The demand for new, more expensive brands because there is always someone that'll pay 100 dollars for a T-shirt. Stop being sheep, stop letting the wolves in Giorgio Armani clothing push their styles on you.  To those who have ever look at another human being and judged them, there's always hope. There's always hope for you to change your ways of thinking. There's always tomorrow and with every new day is a chance to be more open-minded about others. It's no ones problem but yours and it's up to you to find a way to deal with it. People aren't going to change, it's human nature to want to be happy. Next time you look and feel the need to cast judgment upon another, take a look at yourself first. We're all pretty much the same deep down inside. We're all made up of flesh, blood and bone. It's a personal decision to be optimistic or pessimistic, letting something negative influence who and what you are is just a waste of time. We only get one life, I intend to live mine to the fullest. I don't know if the glass is half full or half empty because I'm not stopping to look  NOT MY WORDS...but they describe how i feel so well

       I dont believe in labels. They're just false names and identity's created by the masses to classify some one as diffferent.      Who are you to judge.    To Thyne own self be true                                           dark88poet

      My music is the most important thing to me in the world. If u ever wanted to know who i was all you had to do was listen to my words. they're me in a nutshell. but sometimes i get worried that i'll never make it. do what i've wanted to do since i was four, and that scares me cause then what will i be. i have nothing else, at least nothing that i enjoy and expresses me to the fullest.

         "If they ever tell my story let them say that I walked with giants.Men rise and fall like the winter wheat, but these names will neverdie. Let them say I lived in the time of Hector. Let them say I livedin the time of Achilles."-- Odysseus (as played by Sean Bean in the movie "Troy")

      For all you wanna-be female and or male musicians, like myself who want to write songs about what you know and jam with your friends a must read is Guitar Girl by Sarra Manning. I know it may seem childish to all you to cool school kids but its quite deep in a sarcasticely nuerotic way if you ignore most of the main character's whining. it tackless subjects like betrayel, parental dissaprovment, interband relationships, managment misshaps, and so much more. I Just read it today and i learned alot even though its meant as a fiction read. One might wonder if the auther herself might have been writing from personal experiences, but what ever its all good and so is the book. so READ IT.

      If yall are wonderin why i'm all of a sudden putting my poetry up its cause i'm tryin to learn to write off the top of my head. usually i write in in 1 of my three poetry/music books and they turn out pretty good. Sorry that they're a little ruff around the edges, i promise you that they are not ussually like this. its just that i'm just getting back into the swing of things seeing as how for this entire year with the acception of a few poems here and there i have been mostly concentrating on my music. so hopefully you'll bear with me  Much love Dark88Poet DM Danielle

      i walk a fine line between the shadows and death stray but a little and i'll be gone in the vastness those who are hungry wait for me to stop so that they may pray on my weaknesses it is but a game to them But For me it is a fight for control control over others power over my emotions  I will not stop until i win this game Tho childish it may seem I shall look upon it as my  first test my true test To see if I have what it takes And Then we shall see

      Dark Poets Society  Tracy Ivy Star  Okay, so here you have it: metal with yet another twist. This band reminded me of Coal Chamber but without the budget (or makeup artist). Funked-up bass from the wonderful Tracy; nu metal stylings on guitar from Star; and a decidedly sinister backbeat from Ivy. Tonight at the show, be sure to listen for "Teenage Angst," my favorite cut on the trio's debut album "Dark Poet's Society." It's a classic in the making.And prepare yourself for the larger-than-life voice that singer Star never even knew she had. --reba rock   Dark Poets Society  Tracy   Ivy  Star   Dark Poets Society become known in the underground metal scene as that band with "wicked mosh parts"--the heavy instrumental segments of their Teenage Angsts. When Marilyn Manson hears "Teenage Angst" and wants to use it for his soundtrack to the Sara Michelle Gellar vehicle "Buffy, Destroyer of Worlds," the band refuses on principle. They go on to rock the underground, becoming virtual royalty at Swedish Death Metal fests. fun fact:Dark Poets Society inspired a new genre of rock music called neopseudo-.

      We live in an abominable world where hate is accepted and baisically encouraged we all Turn a blind i to what we wish not to see face it its real as real as you or me  Keep an i on your children lest they be corrupted by someone else why give them the satisfaction when we can do it ourselves what i say may seem harsh but to quote Oscar Wilde " The Truth is rarelly Pure and Never Simple" And it does not help that silence rules our tounges at least when it benefits ourselfes or on the off chance someone we actually give a damn about  We are selfish creatures, human beings mostly thinking of ways to get away with things we ought not have done in the first place ah but now i'm rambling or am i just saying what needs to be said who really knows anymore  I feel so tainted and insecure so corrupted and vain i long to rid myself all my sins and petty greivances  Maybe that is what heaven is a cleansing of all that is wrong in our bodies the same bodies used to kill and rape But now i have gone off the topic If ever i really was on it  I want so much more than predjudice and greed Starvation children dying on the streets wars being faught out bordom and pride And of Course Jealousy The root of all evil  I've had enough of rambling although i have not said all that i wanted to say i guess That I shall save it for another time Another Day  Dark Poet Danielle DM Later Dayz Be Safe
