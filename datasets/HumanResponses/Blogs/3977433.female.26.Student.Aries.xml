      Hi. Today was a good day at work for me, got a lot done, it's just a lot of lifting. At least I know I'll be totally buff in a few weeks. Yay! It's already showing in my stomach. Maybe all this work will get rid of my fat ass.   I have to go back in at 3pm today cause I guess they're super busy. I honestly don't mind. It's more hours, and at 10$ /hr it's not like I can complain. All I do is play with bread all day. *squishy*  Um, not sure what I'm doing tonight, as that is still pretty much up in the air. I just know that for now, I'm going to read a few chapters and then swim before work again...I'm so damned hot.   I hope everyone is having a good day.   &nbsp;

       wow that was the worst thing I could have heard today. It almost made me sick. I wanted a friend, instead I got this. It sucks, and I think I give up. no one is givng me reason to stick around. and it kinda hurts.  A lot.         at least i can say i made the effort one more time. but having it thrown in my face(again) this way is just too much for me to bear.     i had hoped things would be different.         Feeling: grossed out. Listening to: my fan.

        Today was great! I got to sleep in, then Laura and I went for brunch. That was so nice. She listens so well, and she has turned into such a wonderful friend. We hung out after until I had to go to work, and played with Wish and Gus. Laura likes to giggle. A lot.       I went to work for an hour, and I talked with the deli ladies. There is this one very pretty small girl named "katie"? I'm not sure of her last name, but she's sooooo quiet. I always say hi to her, and she is just so mousy. It's sweet. If she was older, she'd be mine.       Anywho, I'm off to find things to do. I bought some more shirts, one that says 'playgirl' on it. And a movie called "If these walls could talk". I hear the series of movies is quite good so I'm looking forward to watching it later.        I am still not sure what I'm doing this weekend, so if anyone is interested in hanging out, please let me know. I'll probably know by Friday... and I think there are a few things that I'd like to do like shopping or going out. It all depends on what kind of mood I'm in... and how people decide to treat me.           Feeling: Happy Watching: Y&amp;R

       Laura just called, and I had better get my ass in gear to go to eat.       I had a good solid sleep, finally. I can't remember what I dreampt about, and that is really weird for me.       Gus and Wish are up and moving around, I wish it wasn't raining out so I could let them play in the grass.       This whole thing with Ashley is getting really frustrating. I don't know how many times I have to stay that I'll be someone's friend, and for them to not listen. I have done what I could to be there for her, I guess it's just up to her how she wants to treat me.      Anywho, still no smoking today, and my chest feels somewhat better. I can't smoke, there was a reason I quit, and I'm going to do it again.  Yay for me. *pats myself on the back.*      Shower time. I hope everyone has a good day.    Feeling: Listening to:

       Feeling a little low tonight, but I'm realizing a lot of things about a few people. It feels good to know that I'm thinking with a clear head, and can see what people are for real. Even though most of the time, it isn't comforting.      Brunch with Laura tomorrow, along with food fights in the rabbit with sex and eggs? yikes,   should get interesting. just like jerry... Speaking of, someone get me tickets to Jerry Springer.   Oh, and a damned hot date. ;)      Sleep tight.     Feeling: Lonely Watching: Angel

       I'm looking for  passion . I'm looking to feel like I am the  whole world  to someone, in every way. I want  ROMANCE  and kindness, sweetness and thoughtfulness...I want to feel deep down inside something, a spark, a light of some kind. I want to have fun, and smile. I need someone to do little things for me,  ALL THE TIME . I don't want to have to remind people to do nice things for me...Because really that makes me feel horrible that I have to remind someone to do something so simple yet so meaningful to  ME . I want surprise ecards/cards and flowers, letters in the mail. I want to be able to talk and hold an interesting conversation about things that I like. I want to play chess again with someone. I want people in my life that are at the same maturity level, and filter out gossip, name calling, backstabbing, lying, all those horrible things that I just don't want around me. I want to have creativity back into my life by someone or by my own accord...But I need someone to be able to do things that interest me and get my brain working on overtime (for good reasons).  I need to feel that I'm living every day to the fullest, alone or with someone. I want to be wanted. And I want all these things all the time...Not just for a little while..Or until the  'effect'  has worn off. So far I haven't been able to find these things.  Now, for these things my search begins.     Feeling: Sore Watching: Beetlejuice

       It feels wonderful to know that I'm so worthless to someone that they're willing to put me aside because they're 'busy' with others.  "Out of sight, out of mind" works for this situation quite well I believe.       I can't wait around for someone to find worth in me. I know I'm worth something, maybe just not to you.  One day I'll find that girl that wants to make me happy too. That doesn't do things to make me feel this way. ..... one day.      If you can't understand even remotely where I'm coming from, then it wasn't meant to be.       Reading now for the night.

      "You're no good for me,But you're the only one I see ..."   what a kick in the pants that was, when it wasn't my picture there. I officially give up. I'm not playing these games. Good luck but you obviously don't need it,.... 2 on the go wow, good for you.   Good night.   P.S - And  Will , if you would like to see me this weekend, feel free to call me when you get into town. I'll be around and I wouldn't mind hearing from you.

       Today went well at work, except for the fact that Bruce (my boss) was there. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy, but he took 1. 5hrs away from me cause he helped me get things done. I wouldn't mind the extra hours, and I know he doesn't come in often so I won't bitch too much about it. Hah.      I guess posting things about my weekends and nice things people say about me, are going to be used against me in some twisted way, so no more of that. It's illegal. I'll stick to the more mundane stuff. Maybe I will start posting how many times I pee. There is a difference between posting things that you MIGHT be doing for the weekend vs. trying to make someone jealous. I see it, why can't you?       It's raining here and I'm soooo tired. I am hoping to find someone to go to breakfast with, and then nap after. Yay, most of my day tomorrow is off. Aaaaand it's HUMP day. Double yay.      Have a good day!

       Yeah, what a great conversation. I say what I feel and I am made to feel that I'm doing all these things wrong, and I'm making this weird deal out of things, when only I was just wishing the best. Some people just really know how to blow things out of proportion. Bleh, not what I need to deal with. I understand my intentions, that's all that matters.         Sleep well.

       Well, today I didn't do much after work, except hang out with Laura. We went to the beach and sat in the sun for a while. I laughed at her driving skills as we ran up on the curb to park, and I even got myself a slushie. I guess I'm getting back into my routine...which is a good thing.      This weekend I'm making plans to go out in Sudbury, and I'm sure it won't be anything but drama. Melissa and I are prepared for it, and are looking forward to enjoy the stupidity of others while we drink our faces off.       I guess I'm not about to wait for others to make up their minds as to where/when/how I fit into their lives. I'd rather not dangle in the air. So, I'm going to do what I do best, and that's getting on with my life, and not worrying about games that others play.      I hope everyone enjoys their day/evening.

            "When life brings you difficult problems to face   and when nothing goes smoothly along,        Remember - until it must leap through the rocks,    a stream has no sparkle or song.        At time when you're shadowed by trouble and care   like a storm cloud that won't go away,        Remember - one sunbeam can banish the dark   with a single dependable ray.        When you must be patent in loss or defeat   or the sorrow that life sometimes brings,        Remember - in time, from a plain cocoon   comes the beauty of butterfly wings.           You have shown many times before,    how beautiful you are on the inside        And that's how I know your heart   will find its wings again soon."      Thank you Melissa.

       Who knew that cleaning could be so therapeutic?  Beau likes his new light. I think he might be developing quite a crush on it. How sweet.  Laura is stopping by this afternoon, and I'm thinking we might go for a walk, or a drive to the beach. That would be charming.  For now, I'm going to give Wish and Gus their baths. Then maybe, just maybe take a shower myself. Fuck I'm a pig.  ...But a beautiful pig.     just when everything was making sense. you took away all my self-confidence. now all that I've been hearing must be true. I guess I'm not the only girl for you.  but that's what I get.  why does it come as a surprise. to think that I was so naive.

       Well, today was alright, I feel alright. Work went well, and there wasn't too much to do other then the usual stuff. I was in a good mood all morning so far, and I hope that my thoughts can figure out themselves without bringing me down again. We will see...      For today, I am taking Wish and Gus outside, letting them play in the grass and sun. Then I'm going to shower and read. I have been trying to find somewhere that supplies hairless guinea pigs " Skinny Pigs " and they do have them in Espanola. Yay. There's just one downfall,...they're very expensive. But I did talk to the owner of the store and she's ok with me paying 2 payments for one. That's nice of her.      Anywho, not many read this or comment in this, so I will wish whomever actually takes the time to come to my blog, a nice day. It's monday, one less day until the weekend.       Ciao.

       Sitting here wondering exactly where it's all going... Hoping that the madness inside my head will stop. I'm on the way of mending but I think it's going take a little while.  I thought I could look to people for support, but it seems like I have go with this all alone... Wow, I feel really unnecessary right now, to everyone.  I'm going to finish watching a movie then head to bed. Gus and Wish are already sleeping. I work in the morning and I'm hoping that I will fall asleep sooner than later.  Have a good night, whoever reads this.    If anyone is bored, I wouldn't mind an email to read in the morning. Thanks.

      What I got instead:    more tears.  I guess I can't expect people to put their plans off because of me, but I was hoping maybe I wouldn't feel so much like an afterthought. I had a really rough day, .... And I guess rather then having someone's company maybe to help stop the tears, I will be spending the night waiting by the phone, and trying to sleep so I won't cry.  Good night.

       Um, where is everyone today? I went to the chat room on irc and no one is there, and no one is posting in their blogs! I'm so distraught! I don't think I can go on another minute.      Heh, um, rrrrrright.      No, but seriously, where did everyone go?      My back hurts today, and it's from all the lifting I'm doing at work. I even do it the right way. Probably the 13 yrs of snowboarding that did my back in. Oh well, it was worth every season.       I am going to make an egg with cheese and butter on a toasted bagel. YUM! I'm so hungry. OH YEAH!! Fuckers at Tim Hortons raised the price of tea to a retarded $1.50!!! I'm not buying it from there anymore. That's even more then coffee. I guess they thought that they weren't making enough money..... ?      I will post a picture again,   through the title of this blog  , and YOU BETTER LEAVE A COMMENT about what you think about it. Good or bad.       Talk to you soon!         -Anna, Wish and Gus.

      I think today is one of the lonliest days I've had in a while. Certain people just don't see how they hurt me, or how they shove me aside so easily even though I only want....    nothing anymore  .  Maybe I should stop.   You've been gone so long all that you know   has been shuffled aside as you bask in the glow   of   the beautiful strangers who whisper your name   do they fill up the emptiness?    Larger than life is your fiction   In a universe made up of one   You have been drifting for so long   I know you don't want to come down

        I guess I wished it would never happen again.    I was crossing my fingers that I wouldn't have reality shoved in my face so soon.       But in Wish's case,  I don't have a choice . At the moment he's starting to show signs of yet another seizure. It's taking everything in me not to cry or think about what is behind them .    If   I lost him I would be empty  .  Trust me, you have no idea what empty is until you lose someone so close to you that you'd truely give    anything    for them. Some think they find it through life, but it was just false hopes that you could care for someone that greatly for   real  . I think after Onion died, I purposely   forgot how to open   myself to anything. And now, even if I try very hard,  I just can't seem to remember .             It's gloomy and very cold out today. Which is not so nice, it's my day off. This trail mix stuff is yummy though.         -  I have so much to lose, and nothing to give .

         the heat is so great it plays tricks with the eye it turns the road into water and then from water to sky and there's a crack in the concrete floor    that starts at the sink there's a bathroom in the gas station     and i've locked myself in it to think    and back in the city the sun bakes the trash on the curb the men are pissing in doorways and the rats are running in herds  i've got a dream with your face in it  that scares me awake      i put too much on my table       and now i got too much at stake     and i might let you off easy yeah i might lead you on    i might wait for you to look for me   and then i might be gone     where i come from and where i'm going and i'm lost in between i might go up to that phone booth and leave a veiled invitation on you machine   and you'll stop me, won't you  if you've heard this one before the one where i surprise you by showing up at your front door saying 'let's not ask what's next,or how, or why'     i am leaving in the morning so let's not be shy    the door opens, the room winces the housekeeper comes in without a warning and i squint at the muscular motel lady says 'hey good morning' and she jumps, her keys jingle and she leaves as quick as she came in and i roll over and  taste the pillow with my grin   well, the sheets are twisted and tangled and the heat is so great    and i swear i can feel the mattress   sinking underneath your weight    oh sleep is like a fever and I'm glad when it ends and the road flows like a river and pulls me around every bend       and you'll stop me, won't you...

I'm happy that I'm not there with her right now cause I'd be snapping out and forcing answers out of people. Fuck this 'I'm too busy right now for you' attitude they've been carrying around. GRRRRRRRR.  Gus is out and hiding my socks. I feel like I want to die. Hopefully someone will go for coffee with me, I feel like a hermit. My legs hurt so bad I want to cut them off. At least my fish and ferrets are still alive.   I'm going to read now.

Someone should come visit me, doubtful that will happen,...everything is doing stuff and I'm too far.      Have you seen that Asprin commerical? Fuck I want to shoot the tv.      I'll probably end up posting later. First I think I'm going to use Wish and Gus as my shoulders so I can get this stuff off my chest.      Oh yeah, Y&amp;R is on soon too.

       Well, last night was lots of fun. A few people ended up coming over. I was sad that laura didn't drink...  I made it home after the bar, fell asleep around 6am..and woke up around 1pm. My parents asked me if I wanted breakfast..but I couldn't get out of bed. Too much damned wine. Today will mostly be spent trying to remember what it was that went on. haha.  Um, I'm going to clean, play with Gus outside, give the two baths, and then watch Dragonfly. I haven't seen it yet, but apparently it's pretty good.  I'm also looking into taking a trip soon. I"m kind of excited.  I hope that everyone had a great weekend.

       Oh holy shit. I need some sleep. I've been working for the majority of the day, inside and out. I just had the joy of pushing my POS lawnmower around the front.       I'm getting drunk tonight. Some people are coming over. We're going to swim and listen to music. (can i make it sound any more exciting? (sarcasm)) I'm sure it will be fun. But I'm very worried about 2 people right now. It's weighing heavily on my mind.       I'm going to nap so I acutally have some energy before anyone shows up.       I smell like bread and grass. Anyone wanna hump?      Have a good day.

       Tonight I was so busy! I did so much of nothing really. I bought a new fish, another betta, his name is "Beau". He looks like cotton candy, pink, green blue and pearl cotton candy. Yumm. But I promise I won't eat him. The bugger jumped out of his bowl tonight, and I thought for sure he'd be dead. I started looking for him because I really didn't want him to start rotting in my room,...when I found him behind my TV, he was still flipping around when I picked him up! Wow, he's strong! He's back in his bowl, and I have a movie on top of it so he won't get out again. I did leave some room for air though. I hope he can't sneak through.  I went to GT with Ashley and bought a pair of pants, and almost a set of pj's that were on the sale rack for 3 dollars, they said "Hello, my name is Superstar". But the undies looked like they were something out of a porno, so I passed them up. Plus, they were neon green, not quite my colour.  I hope everyone has a great weekend. My favourite uncle is coming here Saturday so I'm very excited. I'll be spending as much time with him as possible. I miss him so much.  Gus is stealing my socks, and I need to get to bed. Going into work again at 8am.  Sleep tight.  -"i'd say you were perfect, but you wouldn't believe me."     -"if in your eyes i am, then i will take it and keep that thought in my pocket."

       Wow, I have no damned clue why I'm still up. But this ice cream is good.       Wish just came for a visit, and I have to let Gus out soon. He smells sooooo good! He got a bath today, after rolling around in some mud. He must have had fun.      I think I'm going to stick in a movie and hope that someone msg's me to take me away from this boredom. Tomorrow I doubt I'll be around much, I have some things to do, and that includes finishing my course.      Yesterday I ordered a bed set, but then today figured that I might not like it and cancelled it.. I then thought that maybe I'd like a quilt. But no...I went back to my first choice and re-ordered it. So it should be here on Friday or Saturday. Knowing my luck Monday they'll call.       Um, so yeah. SLeep tight everyone.

       Today was fun. Melissa left around 1pm and since then I've been sitting and relaxing. Took some pictures of Gus and others of my backyard. I smoked a few smokes, watched tv. I guess mostly just enjoyed my own company.      Not sure what I'm doing tonight. Probably a lot of thinking. ...of what other people are doing at this moment. I know one thing. I won't get caught up in any drama. I'll keep my distance until I know for sure I won't get hurt again.       I should take a nap with my boys. I have many thoughts, but probably nothing I'd share in this blog.      I hope everyone has a great night.

      Nothing but enjoying the sun today with Melissa. It's too hot for Wish and Gus to go outside, so it's just us by the pool. I hope I don't get called in to work this afternoon, if I do, I'll pretend I'm dead.  I hope my friendship doesn't get thrown back in my face, but by now I should be used to it.   I hope everyone has a good day.

       Well, so far it's been great. Nothing but pure relaxing. I did have to work on Saturday, but that's alright. After that, hung out, cuddled, watched movies, and other stuff...      I have to work tomorrow, buuut, it's only for a few hours, then back home to (hopefully) enjoy the sun and pool. I think it's supposed to rain which sucks. I'll keep my fingers crossed that it doesn't. I want you to do that too.       Hope everyone is having a good weekend, even if you're ignoring me for whatever reason.          See you later.
