      Here are the topics of the day….   Voynich Manuscript - dubbed the most mysterious manuscript in the world is was discovered in 1912, by Wilfrid M Voynich, an American book dealer and collector, amongst a collection of ancient manuscripts kept in the villa Mondragone in Frascali, Italy.  The origin and language of the manuscript is unknown and there are no other examples of the text in existence, no one to date has been able to decipher the text, and it has been recently theorized that the text itself is just gibberish.  The text is small about 7 by 10 inches and consists of approximately 235 pages, and contains both hand written text and various illustrations depicting plants, astrological diagrams, and naked women.  A letter found in with the text from Joahannes Marcus Marci and addressed to Athanasius Kircher dated 1666 stated that the manuscript was bought by Emperor Rudolph ii for a sum of 600 ducats (approx. $50,000).  It has been thought that the author of the text is possibly Roger Bacon.   Roger Bacon -born in Ilchester, England in 1214 and dies in Oxford, England 1294, was a Franciscan friar and early advocate of the experimental method.  He worked on optics as well as alchemy, and was commissioned by Pope Clement IV, to write a series of books which amounted to an encyclopedia of science.  He taught at Oxford until 1241, where he received a masters degree and also lectured at the University of Paris. Most of his work he kept secret from his fellow brothers, but in 1278 he was imprisoned on the charge of “suspected novelties” in his teachings.     Polygraphiae Libri Sex -written by Johannes Trithemius, the leading intellectual of his day.  The first printed book on cryptology, the title translates to “ Six Books on Polygraphy ”.  It was published in 1518 after Trithemius’s death. The books include information on cryptographic schemes etc…   Johannes Trithemius - born Feb 1, 1462 died Dec 13, 1516…studied at the University of Heidelberg.  In 1482 upon traveling home from the university, was surprised by a snowstorm and took refuge in the Benedictine Abbey of Sponheim near Bad Kreuznach.  He decided to remain at the abbey and in 1483 at the age of 21, was elected abbot.  His goal was to turn the monastery into a center of learning and had transformed their library which contained about 50 titles when he arrived to containing over 2,000 titles.  In 1506 he resigned from the convent due to increasing differences and took the position of Abbot of the Schotlenkloster in Wurxberg, a position offered to him by Bishop Lorenz von Bibra, which is where Trithemius remained for the rest of his life.  His most famous work is Steganographia, written in 1499 and published in 1606, which was originally thought o contain text on black magic, however after publication in 1606 of the decryption key to the volumes revealed that it was a text concerning stenography and cryptology.  Other works of his included  De Septum Secundeis (1508),  Annales Hisaugiensis (1514) and  Polygraphia (1518).

      Here are the topics of the day…   Hypnerotomachia Poliphili - one of the world most curious books, whose author is unknown, was published in 1499 and printed by Aldus Manutius.  The title is a fictional word derived from Greek and is roughly translated to mean  Poliphilo’s Love-Strife in a Dream .  The text is written in Latinate Italian and is an acrostic, the first letter of each chapter is a decorated letter, when all the letters are complied they read POLIAM FRATER FRANCISVS COLVMNA PERAMAVIT-“ Brother Francisco Colonna dearly loved Polia ”.  The work has been attributed to Leon Battista Alberti and even earlier to Lorenzo de Medici.  The story consists of elaborate descriptions of scenes involving the title character Polophili (meaning the lover of Many Things) as he wanders in a dreamland in search of his love Polia (Many Things).  The book is long sought after as on of the most beautiful incunabulum ever printed.  The typography is famous for its clarity and quality and the wood cut illustrations are noted as being the best part of the tome and depict scenery, architecture and characters.  The book itself is interesting as it sheds light on what people in the Renaissance fancied about the aesthetic qualities of the Greek/Roman antiquities.   Aldus Manutis - b. 1449/50-d. Feb.6, 1515.  Founder of the Aldine Press in 1494 in Venice.  Received a scholars training and studied Latin in Rome under Gasparino de Verona and Greek in Ferrar under Guarino de Verona.  In 1490 he settled in Venice.  He published the  Hypnerotomachia Poliphili , though his earliest tracts issued from his press have no date but include  Hero and Leander of Musaeus , the  Galeomyomachia  and the  Greek Psalter  which he stated were the “Precursors of the Greek Library”.  He was a fanatic of anything Greek and kept Greek scholars around him, spoke Greek at home and at his press and wrote edition prefaces in Greek.  In 1499 he married Maria the daughter of Andrea Torresano of Asola, who had purchased the press of Nicholas Jenson in Venice.  The marriage united the two presses and the names Aldus and Asolanus were associated on Aldine publications.  He is accredited for inventing the octavo book as well as the italic typeface.   Incunabula/Incunabulum -a book, single sheet or image that was printed before 1500 in Europe.  These are very rare and fragile and need to be verified by scholars in order to authenticate.  The origin of the word stems from the Latin “in cuna” meaning “in the cradle”.  There are 2 types of incunabulum:  xylographic -made from a single carved/sculpted block for each page and  typographic - made with moveable type on a printing press (this style was attributed to Johann Gutenberg).  Famous examples of incunabula include the  Gutenberg Bible  (1455) and  Schedelsche Weltchronik  (Anton Koberger, 1493).  The tally of the editions and titles printed before 1500 runs in the thousands and the most authorative listing is in the German catalog titled Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke which is still being compiled.   Francesco Colonna -b.1433(?)-d. 1527.  An Italian Dominican monk and priest who is credited by an acrostic in the text with the authorship of  Hypnerotomachia Poliphili .  Very little is known about the life of Colonna, he did live in Venice and preached at St. Mark’s Cathedral.  He is known to be the definite author of the Italian epic poem  Delfili Somium .   Leon Battista Alberti -b.1404-d.1472 born in Genoa. He was an Italian painter, poet, architect, linguist, philosopher, musician, cryptographer and general renaissance polymath.  He is best known for his treatise  De picture  (On painting) dated to 1453 which contained the 1st scientific study of perspective.  He was so skilled in Latin verse that he wrote the comedy  Philodoxius , at the age of 20, and deceived Aldus who published it as the genuine work of Lepidus.  It has been theorized that he may have been the author of  Hypnerotomachia Poliphili .

      Here are today’s topics…( ended up back on the Sufi trail…)   Alchemy - word is derived from the Arabic language “al Kimiya” meaning cast together.  Alchemy was a serious primitive science that attempted to explore and investigate nature before the means of modern scientific tools and techniques. Alchemists believed that there was a way to turn lead into gold and that all matter is composed of the four elements; earth, air, fire and water.  Alchemists also dabbled in mysticism and magic.  Prominent alchemists included such figures as Issac Newton, Roger Bacon, Thomas Aquinas and Thomas Brown.  Alchemy was considered a serious science in Europe until the birth of modern chemistry in the 18th century.   Mysticism - the belief that knowledge if God or Ultimate Reality can only be gained through direct personal experience.  Understood as an individual experience with God or the Goddess.  Such experiences are related to others as visions, dreams or prophecies.  Mystics argue that the true unity of religion and philosophy can by found in the mystical experience.  The West saw a huge gain in popularity in the 19th century.  Mysticism examples can be seen in the traditions of Vedantic Hinduism, Tibetan and Zen Buddhism, Taoism, Christian Gnostic sects Sufism and Judaic Kabbalah.     Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi - Also known as Rumi and Mevlana (our guide).  Born in Balkh (present Afghanistan) on September 30, 1273, he was a Persian poet and Sufi mystic.  His major work is the Masnavi-ye-Manavi (Spiritual Couplets) a six volume poem which has been regarded by many Sufi’s as second in importance with the Koran. His doctrine advocated unlimited tolerance, positive reasoning, goodness, charity and awareness through love.  He died on December 17, 1273 in Konya (present Turkey) where he was brought by his father and spend his last forty years.  It is said that he was murdered by one of his disciples who was jealous of his relationship with Shams.  After his death, his son Sultan Veled Celebi and his other disciples established the Mevlevi the most well know Sufi order.  The Mevlevi’s are also known as the Whirling Dervishes and belive that union through God can be attained through dance and music known as sema.   Ibrahim el-Salahi - Sudanese painter born in 1930, who opened the doors of modernism in Sudan and the Arab world.  He was a member of the Khortoum School, founded by Osman Wagilla, who’s aim was to create modern authentically Sudanese art.  In 1954-57, he studied at the Slade School of Fine Art and the Royal College of Art in London.  In 1962 he was a fellow with UNESCO.  In 1964-65, he was a fellow with the Rockefeller Foundation.  In 1966 he led the Sudanese delegation to the 1st Black Art Festival in Dakar.  In 1975, he was accused of conspiracy again the government and was imprisoned for 6 months.  Shortly after his release he moved to Oxford, England in exile.  His work can be seen in both public and private collection and at such museums as The Met in New York, Neue Gallery in Berlin and  National Gallery of Victoria in Australia.        “Mum” - as in “mum’s the word…”  the origin of this saying is derived from “mmmm” the humming sound made with a closed mouth.  It was used by Shakespeare in Henry Vi…”seal your lips and give no words but mum.”

      The topics for today:  Relics- word is derived from the Latin word "reliquaie" meaning remains.  A relic is an object of a departed saint.  According to Catholics there are three classes of relics, the first being an actual piece of a saints body (limb, hair, boneÂ) the second class is an actual piece of clothing from a departed saint and the third is a object that was either touched by a saint or one that was brought on a visit to a saint.  It is prohibited by the Catholic church that any relics falling into the first and second classes be put up for sale.  Relics were also an important aspect of Buddhism and Hinduism.  The veneration and preservation of relics is a primitive instinct which was often associated with shamanism.  The relics trade was very popular during the Middle Ages.  Relic can also mean something that has surpassed the passage of time.  The most sought after relic is a piece of the true cross.  http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com  Dagda-is the Celtic god of the earth and ruler over life and death.  Dagda or The Dagda means "The Good God".  Is the leader of the Tuatha De Danaruledrulesed over the Uisnech in Co. Meath.  He is a master warrior, artisan and master of magic.  Dagda is the son of the goddess Danu, father of the goddess Brigid and the god Aengus mac Oc.  He mates with his wife, The Morrigan on New Years Day. His attributes are a cauldron with an inexhaustible supply of food,enormousourmous club-of which one end he could kill nine men and with the other end restore them to life.  He is also known under the title Ruadh Rofhessa-The Mighty Red One of Great Knowledge.  http://www.shee-erie.com http://pantheon.org  Football-(I was curious as to why American Football, is called football as there is very little contact between the foot and the ball)  American Football is indeed named as such, as it owes its heritage to soccer.  Rugby evolved from soccer when players began carrying the ball and American football has things in common with rugby, especially the rugby league.  Hence, the sport is a direct  decendant of rugby union football, which in turn derived from soccer.  American football retained the same name for which soccer is called in the rest of the world.  http://wordiq.com  Phi-is the basis for the Golden Section, Golden Ration and Golden Mean.  It was known to the Greek s as the Golden Section and to Renaissance artists as the Divine Proportion.  The decimal equivalent of "Phi" is 1.6180339887 and "phi" is 0.6180339887.  Phi can be derived in many ways and can show up anywhere in the universe from Fibunacci's numerical series, geometry, proportions of the human body, plants, animals, DNA, music and art, the solar system and even in the bible and theology.  Like Pi, it is a ratio that is determined by a geometric construction.  The ratio of the line segments when a line is divided in one very special and unique way...divide a line so the ratio of the length of the entire line to the length of the larger line segment is the same as the ratio of the length of he smaller line segment     A is 1.618...times B and B is 1.618... times C.  Alternativly, C is 0.618 of B and B is 0.618 of A.  http://goldennumber.net/neophite.htm

      Here are today’s topics of interest…  •The Esker Riada-is a natural system of raised mounds that consist of gravel and rocks which are believed to have been deposited 10,000 years ago due to a glacier melting over Western Europe as a result of climactic warming.  The Celts knew the Esker Riada as “An Sli Mor” meaning The Great Highway.  The Esker Riada runs across Ireland East to West and is flanked by bogland.  The monastic settlement of Clonmacnoise was settled at the crossing of the Esker Riada and the Shannon River, and it is said that 2 Celtic high kings are buried there.  The ancients would have used the Esker Riada for trips to Newgrange, the Turoe Stone at Rath of Feerwore and the Cairn at Alloon.  In the 1950’a a 1.5 mi. stretch of the Esker Riada was removed in New Inn for road building materials. •Clonmacnoise-is a monastic settlement at the crossroads in County Offaly that dates back to 545 A.D.  The site was chosen and built by St. Ciaran the son of Ulsterman who settled in Connaught.  The settlement is on the east side of the River Shannon in what was known as the Kingdom of Meath.  From the 8th-10th centuries the settlement was used as a Scriptorium by scribes and metalworkers.  There is no one big church on the settlement there are however several simple churches that were build of wood construction.  Clonmacnoise endured a violent life before it was finally conquered in 1552 by the English garrison in Athone, it was destroyed by fire 13 times, and was attacked 40 times between the 8th and 12th century by the Vikings, Anglo Normans and Irish and each time the monks rebuilt.  After it’s fall in 1552, there were no other monasteries erected in Ireland for 300 years. •The Turoe Stone-is said to be the best example of Celtic La Tene art and was said to be found near Rath of Feerwore near Kiltullagh.  It can currently be found in the lawn of the Turoe House in Loughrea, Galaway.  It is made of granite and stands 90cm high.  The top half of the stone is covered with a continuous abstract currilinear design in relief, the middle line displays a Greek key pattern.  The phallic shape of the stone had led some to believe that it is attributed to a fertility cult.   I have started to read Sun Dancing which is about Skellig Michael, it seems like it will be an interesting read once I find the time to actually break into it!

      These are topics that were included on a previous post on my other blog...  •EcoPoetics/EcoPoetry- poems dealing with ecological and environmental issues. Some of the more famous ecopoets include Gary Snyder, Mary Oliver, W.S.Mewin and Wendell Berry.  Ecopoetry is a subset of nature poetry and “recognizes interdependence of all creatures, views humbly the relation between human and non-human life, cultivates skepticism towards the hyper rational, overtechnologized  mindset that dominates present-day culture (2002 Cathers Business Information Inc.) Nature in poetry peaked in the centuries between Beowulf and Blake and then took a dive in the age of Darwin.   It was then revived again thanks to the Beats and Gary Snyder. •Dharma-means “protection”, practicing Buddhist teachings protects us from suffering and problems.  Teaches that problems that exist in daily life can stem from ignorance and the method for eliminating that ignorance is Dharma.  Dharma is the supreme method of improving human life and it focuses on the inner development and happiness as opposed to external. Buddhadharma is another name for Buddhism.   •Definition:Waxing Poetic-to become more poetic, lyrical •CuChulainn-an ancient Gaelic hero with superhuman qualities.  His name means “The Hound of Culainn” of which he slain, however he was first called Setanta.  At the age of 5 he left home to join the Red Branch Knights-Ulster Army (Ireland).  He was a great warrior, great at hurling and eventually became the leader of the Red Branch Knights.  He was defeated in an epic battle by Queen Mebd.

      These topics were included on a previous post on my other blog Ramblings of an Inquisitive Mind...  •Buddhism in Afghanistan-I was amazed to discover that a place that some now associate with war and hostility was once a center of peace and reflection….Yesterday, I found out that Afghanistan, especially the city of Bamyan was considered once one of the most sacred and holy places for Buddhists.  The Buddhist religion was the main religion there until the 9th century when the Hazaras, people of the region converted to Shiite Islam. In the town of Bamyan the worlds largest standing Buddha structure was built, carved into a mountain side.  The statue was 175 ft tall and named Solsol, meaning “year after year”, he was built between the 3rd and 5th centuries.  Sadly, the Taliban who have been enemies of the Hazara people destroyed the statues in May of 2001.  •Definition: Cairn-pronounced ‘kern’, a heap of stones piled up as a memorial or as a landmark  •Urumchi Mummies-Another fascinating topic I have stumbled upon is the Urumchi Mummies of the Tarim Basin in China.  They were found in the Tarim Basin which is the saltiest place in Central Asia and are dated to be as old as 4,000 years.  They are known for their amazing preservation and were actually made by accident.  They have been found between the towns of Loulan and Cherchen.  The reason why these mummies are so interesting is that their features are Caucasian and based upon their physical features as well as the intricately woven clothing they wear (one man was even found wearing ten hats!) they have been said to originate from Celtic tribes of Central Europe.

       Today is Tuesday, a rather bland day of the week.  There really is nothing new to write about so I will give a brief synopsis of some of the recent topics of interest that have some across my path.   •Mystery Hill-America’s Stonehenge- This site is located in North Salem New Hampshire and consists of 30 acres of low walls and cave-life primitive buildings/tunnels along a hillside, as well as a “Sacrificial Stone” table that is believed to be used in the obvious.  It has been found that this site has astrological alignments to the summer solstice. In 1823 the land and site was owned by Jonathan Patee.  Some believe that some of the stones contain markings that resemble ancient Ogam writing.    •John Moschos-6th century monk who wrote the  Spiritual Meadow  about his travels from Mt. Athose to Byzantine.  He name is also spelled Ioannes Moschos meaning John the Calf.  He was a good friend of Sophronios a patriarch of Jerusalem and was a sworn enemy of the monophysites.  He began his journey in 587 A.D. and it lasted 30 years where he crossed Egypt, Palestine, the Levant and Anatolia.  His book is an account of the disappearance of Christianity across the Middle East.  •Skellig Michael-   Located 12 km off of Ireland’s west coast houses a 7th cent. Monastic complex of the first Irish Christians.  The site is very well preserved due to the remoteness of the land and the treacherous journey to get to the island. The Clochans or beehive huts can be seen 2/3 up the face of the rock The monastery is now designated as a World Heritage Site.  Irish monks in habited the site from 588-1222 AD.  Skellig is a Gaelic word used to describe a rock island in the ocean.  The island is named after the Archangel Michael.  The monastery was founded by Fionan-one of the original monks who was a member of the community of St Brendan the Navigator. (I will be reading Sundance soon which is about Skellig Michael)  •Sufi/Sufism-in Arabic called “tasawwuf”, understood to be the inner, mystical or psycho-spiritual dimension of Islam.  The practice involves the Sufi surrendering to God in love and embracing with each moment the content of one’s consciousness-thoughts, emotions and sense of self as gifts or manifestations of God.  Also stated to be the name that Islamic mysticism was know as in the 8th-9th cent.  •Caucasus- Region in Eastern Europe and Western Asia between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, includes the Caucasus Mountains and surrounding lowlands. It is one of the most linguistically and culturally diverse places on earth.  Some historical events that have taken place include the Arab-Khazar wars, conquest of the Caucasus by Russia.    I would continue but I’ll put the other topics in my next installment so as not to further bore anybody. (Next installment will include the Esker Riada, The Turoe Stone, and Clonmacnoise among other topics). Michael thinks that I am strange for researching things that are interesting to me.  I think he was comparing me to Cliff Claven from Cheers…oh well, I would rather be learned about a wide range of things than be walking the face of the world ignorant (I can’t help think of Michael Jackson when I hear/use that word, how sad) to our history and accomplishments as humans.

      Today mike and I went to the cabin, which is a rarity on a Sunday, but being a long weekend was okay. We have not been there since November, so it was nice to visit again.   Michael went golfing with his dad (and played his best game so far) and I went shopping with my mother-in law...we had a great time and I ended up buying another book.  There is a great book outlet in Glens Falls and their fiction books are all reduced about 80% of list price and on top of that they run a sale where you buy 3 get one free.  However, I only purchased one today but it was on my Amazon.com wishlist, so I was pleased.  Titled  Fruitflesh by Gayle Brandeis, Fruitflesh: Seeds of Inspiration for Women Who Write, Brandeis uses fruit as a metaphor for sensual and creative exploration and women's bodies, too to meld writing advice and exercises with meditations that use produce to illuminate prose. ("Let your writing be like this feast [of a mango] bold, sensual, unapologetic.") Cynics and skeptics beware: with its garden-lush prose and fervent guilelessness, this is a book for the open-hearted believer.   Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.  It sounded interesting enough, and with my recent bought or writing sounded like a good book to invest in.  Hopefully i will be able to incorporate reading that book along with the other book that I purchased yesterday.  But that is really all for today.  Unfortunately, I don't have much to reflect about, though visiting the Adirondacks should have given me further inspiration.  But, it was a whirlwind trip which did not provide enough time to relax.  Dustan is on his way over and we are going to end the day by playing guitar, so I leave you with some pictures of the cabin in Summer.  I am on a new quest to find interesting topics to learn about so hopefully tomorrow my entry will be more insightful.

      Today Mike and I went to Woodstock, NY.  I love the artistic nature of that town.  There are galleries everywhere, containing some of the most beautiful artwork one has ever seen.  As an artist seeing such work draws both feelings of inspiration and a jolt of anticipation to go home and just start creating for the sake of art, but it also brings about some feelings of inadequacy towards one's own work.  To see such beautiful examples of art, so professionally done, can tend to make you question your own talents.  Nonetheless, it was a wonderful day.  While we were there, I purchased a new book... The Red-Haired Girl From the Bog: The Landscape of Celtic Myth and Spirit  by Patricia Monaghan.  It seems like it will be an interesting read as the subject area is right up my alley.  I have had a strong penchant for learning new things lately...so many things seem interesting that I have yet to learn about.  Lately, several topics have peaked my interest....the mummies from the Tarim Basin in Urumchi, China (they are fascinating because they seem to be from Celtic decent based on the intricate woven clothing they wear), EcoPoetics, Buddhism, Tibet, and Capitan Shackleton and The Endurance voyage.  I hope to use this blog as a place where I post some of the more interesting findings on subjects that peak my interest.  I just hope that it does not end up a chronicle of my useless ramblings :)   Well, the day is done, and I am going to retire to begin my new book.  I hope to post some pictures tomorrow, as we are visiting our cabin in the Adirondack Mountains....i just hope I don't forget the digital camera like I did today. So for now, I leave you with the quote of the day...  " Do not follow where the path may lead.  Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.  Namaste." Anon.

      Wow!  This is my first online BLOG entry and I must say it is rather exciting.  I usually handwrite my journal entries, now I will be cutting and pasting, literally! It has been a while since I have written anything....let alone a journal entry.  I felt that now was an appropriate time in my life to re-introduce myself to this art.  Lately my mind has been conjuring up emotions and thoughts, some of which may be worthy of the pen (keyboard?), while others are better left to be swept away by consciousness.  I often wonder if a journal is a suitable forum for a collection of thoughts as it provides an open door into the psyche of the author, for others who may trespass upon it's pages.  Do I write selectively?  Choosing carefully the emotions and thoughts that I wish to unveil-or, do I write without inhibition...Allowing my words to flow freely as a bottle of spilled ink?  It is with this thought, that I begin this journey again...To fill the empty page with  MY  unworthy words, to muddle them with thoughts and phrases that can not be left unsaid.  One day, as I have always done, I will reflect on these words and laugh as how I have changed and possibly shed a tear for times and feelings past.          For who I am today, I may not be tomorrow.                                               S.E.S.

      This weekend was so hectic…and I realize that I have been neglecting my blog.  Saturday was Michael’s 28th birthday and he had a great day.  We went up to the cabin for a Father’s Day/Birthday celebration.  His parents devised a scavenger hunt to reach his present, which was a riding mower for the massive lawn that we have…..they went overboard but he loved it….the face he made as he was riding around was great…stupid me again forgot to bring the camera.  Again, Mike went golfing with his father and his mom and I went shopping.  She bought me an interesting book called  Soul Catcher   by Kathy & Amy Eldon, which is an interactive journal to help you discover who you are or help one to reclaim pieces that may be missing….hmmm sounds familiar.  So hopefully it may help guide me down the road to the land of lost poetry…HA!  I have been writing a lot lately, but no poetry.  Sunday, we went over to my parents house and had a great filet mignon lunch with my rents and in-laws.  We gave my father a remote controlled submarine for fathers day…it took a while to figure out how it worked but he loved it.  Baba is doing about the same and I am going to try to visit her this afternoon.  Other than that there is nothing else that is really new.  Oh…I have  joined a blank journal exchange program and have to start working on a journal to submit….the idea is, is that you create a blank journal submit it to Volcano Book Arts and then you receive a different one back. I think that it is going to be a lot of fun as well as a way to get new ideas and techniques.  Other than that there is nothing else that is really new , I have also been neglecting the Chronicles so hopefully I’ll have some topics today to write about…until then!

      I was told this is how one would make a Woods Woman...I am a little scared!  How to make a Woods Woman  Ingredients: 5 parts friendliness 3 parts self-sufficiency 5 parts beauty  Method: Add to a cocktail shaker and mix vigorously. Top it off with a sprinkle of curiosity and enjoy!   I like the enjoy part though :)

      I am even more tired today, last night I didn’t fall asleep until 3:00 because my mind was on hyper drive.  Yesterday I went to see Baba at St. Mary’s hospital, she is still in good spirits and does not look like she is in any pain, but she can no longer communicate (all she can really muster up are ‘yes’ ‘no’ answers) and I think she also lost some of her vision due to her minor stroke.  Yesterday was the first time she really looked ‘old’ to me.  I don’t handle things like this very well, my emotions always have the tendency to get the best of me.  I found it interesting, when I looked at her yesterday, with a smile on her face and her eyes wandering about the room…that some of us leave this world the same way we entered it…..not in the physical form of giving birth, but in regards to the human form-mentally and physically.  It is if as everything we learn, everything we go through in life is tucked away in some far corner, and the simplicity that we began our life with returns to lead us into the unknown.  I sat there and saw my Baba, not as I always remember her, but simple, innocent, vulnerable.  Like a child she sat there with a smile on her face like she was utterly amazed at the sound of her family’s voices around her and what little she could see.  She got frustrated with not being able to communicate and she no longer has the strength to move on her own.  I don’t know how much longer she has left with us, but her time has been longer than the doctors expected when she was first diagnosed, and I have been grateful of every extra day that she has been with us.  I just want her to be able to pass from this world peacefully and painlessly.  I am going to try to see her again today, if not today, then tomorrow morning, it sounds horribly selfish, but my emotions still today are in no way, shape, or form to see her now, I don’t want to be a sobbing mess over her bedside, I know that would not help her.  I just hope that while she lays there with her wandering eyes and her cute smile that she is thinking of something happy.  I just hope that she can go home soon, so maybe we can fit one last Old Lady’s Sewing Circle in before she goes…

       Mood:  Melancholy  Music:   Deb Talan- “You Are Forgiven”                          Peter Gabrien-"Here Comes the Flood"  Word of the Day:    incipient   \in-SIP-ee-unt\ adjective : beginning to come into being or to become apparent   I am so tired today.  Nothing again is really new as I have no time to myself lately.  Work has been busy and arduous, and Mike’s dad has been at the house helping us remodel our kitchen and bathroom.  He has been such a great help to us.  Baba is back in the hospital again as she suffered a minor stroke…she can understand commands but sadly, she can no longer speak in full sentences and does not remember names.  It is a very stressful time for the family.  She is a good woman and does not deserve to suffer from this.  My mom may have bronchitis, so everyone is either sick, stressed or both! As of late, I have not been able to find any topics of interest lately to add to The Chronicles, if anyone reads this….throw out some ideas.   Other than that nothing is really new on this rainy, cloudy day.  I am too tired to be profound today so I’ll leave you with some poetry to ponder…I need a nice warm gourd of Yerba Mate. Hopefully, I’ll have more to say later…

      It is Wednesday, the week is almost half over.  Time has actually gone by quickly this week, but it seems as if the second half of the week begins to slow down.  I have been so tired lately. It has been so hard to find time to write and even read lately.  There is so much that needs to get done around the house and now that we are remodeling the kitchen and bathroom, with things being in shambles right now, it is promoting more mess around the rest of the house. Between that, my regular work around the house and keeping up with Michael’s demands and constant whining- my garden and any outside work has been neglected and I have found no time for myself.  Lately, with my inability to find poetry, I worry that I have lost important pieces of myself.  Emotions, talents and personal characteristics that I used to cherish and were proud to call my own are no longer part of who I am and it scares me.  I don’t feel that it is part of maturing, or growing older, nor were they steps in my life that have been conquered. These pieces of self that seem to have gone astray were vital parts of my being, my happiness both internal and external.  They can’t be bought, but I am hoping that they can be restored.  I just need some quite time for myself to reflect on what I need to do to bring these pieces back to life. Other than shedding light on a darker topic today, nothing else is really worthy of writing down for now.    "There is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge."  -Bertrand Russell  Today’s topics on Chronicles of A Life Long Learner include The Esker Riada, Clonmacnoise, The Turoe Stone and other topics of interest.

       There are those who love to get dirty      and fix things. They drink coffee at dawn,      beer after work,  And those who stay clean,      just appreciate things, At breakfast they have milk      and juice at night.  There are those who do both,      they drink tea.  `Gary Snyder

      Yesterday, out of sheer curiosity, I went on Google to see if my blog had been listed in their search engine yet and typed in "Ramblings Mind" and I was surprised to see how may people were on the same thread of thought that I was on when naming my blog.  I never realized how many different types of minds there are out there.  Here is a list of all of the different minds I stumbled upon that day...  Disoriented, Demented, Random, Spaded, Disordered, Wandering, Unstable, Restless, Cluttered, Tired, Confused, Busy, Crazed, Bizarre, Spinney, Sick, Scrambled, Insane, Slightly Deranged, Spotless, Dangerous, Impeded, Over Active, Retired, Unhinged, Idle, Disturbed, Ever Wandering, Hormonal, Semi-Sane, Hopeless, Frazzled, Infected, Diseased, Unteathered,Distracted...  I think I may change the name of my blog....I am so indecisive!

      I have decided that my posts about my topics of interest have gotten a little carried away and lenghtly for this blog, so i created a new blog titled Chronicles of A Life Long Learner at http://life-long-learner.blogspot.com.  I'll attach a link from this blog if anyone is interested, besides myself in reading my tidbits of research.  I'll also give a shor synopsis on this blog regarding the topics I have written about on my supplemental blog.  Today's topics include: Mystery Hill(America's Stonehenge), John Moschos, Skellig Michael, Sufi/Sufism, Caucasus.  Tuesday is such a bland day!

      Well, as you can see this weekend didn’t allow for time to write, let alone relax.  The weekend flew by as usual, and now it is Monday, and we have to begin this arduous cycle all over again. Friday night Mike, Dustan and I went up to Saratoga for a bit then came back to the house and played videogames.  Dustan is now in Kentucky with a  group of friends, as they rented a house boat for the week.  Getting inebriated and wakeboarding sounds wonderful right now!  Saturday, I went garage sale-ing with my mom, and then helped my sister paint her room and then we relaxed the rest of the night….we were supposed to see Harry Potter but Michael opted to watch the hockey game instead.  Sunday I worked on cleaning the house and then we went to my parents for my sister’s 21st birthday party. Tonight, after work, we are going with her to Jillian’s in Albany.Baba got out the hospital Sunday as well from a short bought with pneumonia, she is doing well considering what she is going through.   Other than that nothing really exciting happened this weekend.  I didn’t get the chance to work outside at all, and I was only able to get the bedroom spotless…I still have the rest of the house to take care of. I am having a hard time finding time to break into Fruitflesh.  I’ve skimmed over a couple of pages and have read the introduction, but I need ample time to actually start some of the writing exercises.  Hopefully this week(end) will warrant some time.  I was listing to my Il Postino soundtrack this weekend…how it brought back memories of days filled with poetry. I sat there on my bed and took in every word, every syllable and longed for my writing, my passion to return to me.(Ha! I sound like Sméagol…my precious!) It felt so good listing to that poetry again. Right now, I think my main problem is finding the actual time to concentrate and prepare myself to write….Michael, I hate to say it, is my biggest distraction at home…he is always calling from the other room for something, I just can’t find the solitude I need unless he is asleep, and by that time, so am I.  For now I leave you with this quote…  “A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving.” 		Lau Tsu

      Nothing really new today.  Found interesting info on America’s Stonehenge in Salem, NH…I’ll post info on it later.  I am hoping to find some quiet time in a quiet place (hopefully my Poet-tree) this weekend to re-acquaint myself with the art of writing once again.  Hopefully, I’ll have a poem to post by the end of the weekend.  Don’t know if we are going out to Saratoga tonight…if so, I’ll be back tomorrow!

      An interesting thought (at least to me it seemed interesting) popped into my tired head this morning.  I had a weird dream last night which prompted this whole train of thought…how often do dreams dictate our reality; intentionally/unintentionally, consciously/or unconsciously?  I know that I have had dreams that seemed more like premonitions of something about to happen, so I take special care to avoid or encounter people, places, things etc…to possibly create a paved path for such things to occur or dig up a dirt road for such events to be hindered.  I have had dreams about my husband that either make me crave him or hate him when I wake up.  I recently had a dream about a girlfriend of mine, in the dream I kicked her ass after she pissed me off royally, and for some reason whenever someone mentions her name, a tinge of anger sets of a spark from some unknown, unconscious area of my head…for no good reason at all.  I shrug it off, but it just seems weird to me.  I have had many other dreams that I can use as examples for this question, but I am going to refrain from divulging them as those are just for me  It just seems that, at least for me, dreams have the tendency to have an effect on reality, whether one truly realizes it or not.  Here are some new things that I learned today…god, I am such a geek   •EcoPoetics/EcoPoetry- poems dealing with ecological and environmental issues. Some of the more famous ecopoets include Gary Snyder, Mary Oliver, W.S.Mewin and Wendell Berry.  Ecopoetry is a subset of nature poetry and “recognizes interdependence of all creatures, views humbly the relation between human and non-human life, cultivates skepticism towards the hyper rational, overtechnologized  mindset that dominates present-day culture (2002 Cathers Business Information Inc.) Nature in poetry peaked in the centuries between Beowulf and Blake and then took a dive in the age of Darwin.   It was then revived again thanks to the Beats and Gary Snyder. •Dharma-means “protection”, practicing Buddhist teachings protects us from suffering and problems.  Teaches that problems that exist in daily life can stem from ignorance and the method for eliminating that ignorance is Dharma.  Dharma is the supreme method of improving human life and it focuses on the inner development and happiness as opposed to external. Buddhadharma is another name for Buddhism.   •Definition:Waxing Poetic-to become more poetic, lyrical •CuChulainn-an ancient Gaelic hero with superhuman qualities.  His name means “The Hound of Culainn” of which he slain, however he was first called Setanta.  At the age of 5 he left home to join the Red Branch Knights-Ulster Army (Ireland).  He was a great warrior, great at hurling and eventually became the leader of the Red Branch Knights.  He was defeated in an epic battle by Queen Mebd.  Hopefully this didn’t bore the pants off of you! Ha! I was a little long winded today. Until tomorrow…

      Naked  Naked, you are simple as a hand, smooth, earthy, small...transparent, round. You have moon lines and apple paths; Naked, you are slender as the wheat.  Naked, Cuban blue midnight is your color, Naked, I trace the stars and vines in your hair; Naked, you are spacious and yellow As a summer's wholeness in a golden church.  Naked, you are tiny as your fingernail; Subtle and curved in the rose-colored dawn  And you withdraw to the underground world  As if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores: your clear light dims, gets dressed, drops its leaves,  And becomes a naked hand again.   ~by Pablo Neruda

      I just can't find poetry lately so I have been working with some computer graphic programs to find a new outlet for creativity, so my blog may end up as a posting of experiments if I deem them worthy enough to publish….i also hope to learn more about the “old fashion” way of developing pictures as I would love to open a darkroom in my basement this year.  I am about ¾ of the way done with Red Haired Girl from the Bog…and it is interesting, I just don’t like the way it is written….it’s all over the place.  However, it has opened my mind into researching some topics of interest…here is what I have found…  •I was amazed to discover that a place that some now associate with war and hostility was once a center of peace and reflection….Yesterday, I found out that Afghanistan, especially the city of Bamyan was considered once one of the most sacred and holy places for Buddhists.  The Buddhist religion was the main religion there until the 9th century when the Hazaras, people of the region converted to Shiite Islam. In the town of Bamyan the worlds largest standing Buddha structure was built, carved into a mountain side.  The statue was 175 ft tall and named Solsol, meaning “year after year”, he was built between the 3rd and 5th centuries.  Sadly, the Taliban who have been enemies of the Hazara people destroyed the statues in May of 2001.  •Definition: Cairn-pronounced ‘kern’, a heap of stones piled up as a memorial or as a landmark  •Another fascinating topic I have stumbled upon is the Urumchi Mummies of the Tarim Basin in China.  They were found in the Tarim Basin which is the saltiest place in Central Asia and are dated to be as old as 4,000 years.  They are known for their amazing preservation and were actually made by accident.  They have been found between the towns of Loulan and Cherchen.  The reason why these mummies are so interesting is that their features are Caucasian and based upon their physical features as well as the intricately woven clothing they wear (one man was even found wearing ten hats!) they have been said to originate from Celtic tribes of Central Europe.    Those are the only topics as of late that I have found interesting enough to research further.  I hope to find more stories or artifacts or historical information worth delving into.  If anyone happens to stumble upon my blog, please feel free to comment with interesting topics…and ever hungry mind should not be allowed to starve.

      Good lord I really have been slacking off with my blog(s)lately.  The poor Chronicles have yet to be updated in what seems like ages, and here I am taking the easy way out of posting by adding pictures without any insightfulness (is that a real word?(spellcheck told me that it was not, but it sounds good for now:)).  I received the awesome Chai shipment Chrissy sent me, I can't wait to try it!!! MythicalDude was kind enough to link my blogs to his new blog, so those who choose to read mine, whomever ye may be, check his out as well!  I am trying to convince my husband to go to the Sterling Renaissance Festival this weekend, but I fear that my pleas fall on deaf ears.  We were supposed to go to the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival but some friends backed out and tix prices were way too much to justify going, so again, i am stuck trying to figure out what to do with the weekend.  I feels good to sit down and find a moment to write again... hopefully this will be the start of an ongoing trend to maintain consistency on this thing....I have been researching some interesting topics, so hopefully tomorrow the Chronicles will be updated...if not, it will definitely be Saturday.  Adieu, to those who are nice enough to take time out of their day to read this! Until tomorrow...
