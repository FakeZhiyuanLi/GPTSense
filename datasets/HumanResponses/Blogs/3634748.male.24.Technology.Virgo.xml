      I've never much cared for billboards.  Both rural and urban scenery can be very beautiful, and when a person is spending time on the road, with a tank-like SUV breathing down the back of their neck while still speeding, it's a nice break to be able to look out and see things that aren't inherently stressful.  Rolling hills, the sun hitting a cityscape just so, whatever.  Nowhere amongst these pretty things is a giant rude advertisement.  And certainly not one flashing Dubbya's evil smirk, like the one just put up in the small area between where I live and where I work.     "God Bless America", it says in enormous type, as if to flaunt and celebrate the idea that the barrier that is supposed to exist between church and state has been eroded more quickly under this administration than a sugar cube dropped into boiling acid.  "November 2 Reelect Our President", it urges.  Couple of things wrong with that.  He wasn't elected in the first place, so re-election is sort of out of the question just by definition.  And even if he had been elected, there's no way in hell any sane person would want it to happen again.  Let's recap.   urlLink Tax   urlLink breaks  and  urlLink loopholes  that affect the wealthiest echelons of our country almost exclusively.  A  urlLink joke of an education policy  (that leaves plenty of children behind, thanks very much) complete with a  urlLink gutting of educational funding .  A four-year  urlLink transformation   from the economy's  urlLink ample surplus to its largest defecit in history .  Great surges in IT, manufacturing, and many other industries...  urlLink in India and China .  Unprovoked war driven by  urlLink greed for power  and  urlLink wealth .  So no, actually, I don't consider this continent (or country) "blessed" by anything, man, deity or otherwise, and I'm sure as hell not going to do anything that would help sustain the ridiculous mess we're in.  And I'll say that twice a day for as long as I have to.  ...added later...  These things must be springing up all over!

      Great, "enjoy Coca-Cola" banners in orbit...  Seriously, I've got mixed feelings about  urlLink non-government space travel .  It's the next logical step, I suppose.  Competition is something space travel has been virtually without since the US/Russian race to the moon; it will be healthy to reintroduce some of that spirit.  My question is what will commercial interests be competing  for ?  Maybe the Royal Carribeans and Carnivals of the world will start developing luxury space cruises.  I for one would love that.  We're pretty far away from a week-long cruise going anywhere terribly exotic in galactical terms ("off the port side you can see Titan...") but that's one of the things competition could help bring about - speed improvements.  I would wager competing luxury lines would be quicker to approach light speed than single government outfits.  But luxury lines visiting Jupiter aren't going to happen right now.  First we'll be sending mining operations to the moon, and maybe film crews into orbit.  It will be a while before you can sign up for zero-gravity painting at the local college.  With a bit of a leap of consciousness that leads me to another point:  Well down the line, when everybody can afford space travel, what will that mean?  The internet used to be a very different place.  The hurdles were partially cost but mostly technological.  By its nature it excluded most of the population.  Once those barriers were removed, the internet became much like highly-populated places on earth: dumped on.  Naive IE users get mugged by spyware, even long-time internet readers suddenly get bombarded with advertising at every turn  Cybersquatters grab domains to extort money from those who would actually make good use of them.  As someone who's always loved astronomy I just don't want to see the space we bring within reach become a commercialized dump.  I'm tellin' ya, billboards in space.  It will happen.  Even the heavens aren't sacred to those who spend their lives chasing dollars.

      I'll probably wind up doing a fair amount of political yammering here, but at the moment I've got something less serious on the brain.  Nintendo has a new device coming out this year, temporarily named the  urlLink Nintendo DS .  Think of a game boy on steroids, with two screens, touch-sensitivity (stylus, finger, whatever) built-in mic, wireless and internet communications, and better-than-n64 graphics.  It's not even the fancy technical stuff that's got me excited about it, but the new possibilities a touch-screen, a mic and wireless connections mean for gaming.  One of the tech demos shown at this year's E3 had the player draw Pac-Man, big, small, with fangs, whatever, which would then spring to life exactly as drawn and go about its ghost-munching business.  The player then has to draw in walls to turn and guide it around.  If there's a Zelda title that involves some clever use of the touch-screen, or a portable, modern Mario Paint that takes advantage of all this funky new input (and why not upload animations wirelessly to the web, while we're at it?) I'll be just as hooked on this damn thing as I have been by Nintendo's other gadgets over the years.  Backwards-compatible with all past Game Boy stuff too, can't beat that!  To be fair I should mention that Sony's introducing the  urlLink PSP  sometime too, this year or next.  Not surprisingly, it's more of a straight evolution of the Game Boy concept without any funky new ideas.  Think SNES->PlayStation, GBA->PSP.  Dreamcast-ish graphics on a big, pretty screen, battery-sucking new minidisc format, Sony shape-buttons.  Not that carrying a self-contained PS2 around in one's pocket doesn't have a certain appeal, I just get more giddy about new ideas than I do about "now with bigger numbers!" type stuff.  Drifting a bit... It used to be a person didn't learn about the next big thing in video games practically until it happened.  We'd rent/buy stuff after looking at the screenshots on the back of the box.  I like that the internet makes any information a person's interested in so immediate, but there was something kind of nice living in the present instead of the future, too.  Eh.  *shrug*

      I haven't had a "Swerk's Schtuff" site up in a good long time, and I've not updated my own news section of my homepage in some time either.  If there's even the tiniest chance I can get an early gmail account out of this, I figure sign me up!  Yahoo might have done some good stuff as far as linking back in the day, but it's horrific now and I can't wait to abandon its pathetic mail service.  So, actual news and my spin on it and stuff.  Well I'll get the mundane bits out of the way right now.  I consider myself neither liberal nor conservative, which is fine since neither party acts according to its own supposed philosophies anyway.  I think nearly everything Dubbya and his puppeteers have done to this country has been backwards, for reasons I'm sure will crop up as I discuss specific issues-du-jour.  I'm engaged to an absolutely wonderful woman, and I wish the same happiness to everyone else on the planet, be they the same age / race / orientation / faith as myself or completely different.  I think God and religion can do wonderful things, but can be gravely dangerous as well.  I can be quite opinionated and argumentative but I try to be mindful that I certainly don't know all there is to know, so it wouldn't be very wise to have any philosophies or thoughts set in stone.

      Wow.  First let me say I think it was very entertaining.  Bouncing between gut-wrenching stuff and hilarity, with plenty of snideness thrown in, Moore's message came through loud and clear, in a well-produced package.  Secondly, love it or hate it, I think this country needs to thank Michael for having the guts to do this.  Some links:  urlLink Fahrenheit/911  [imdb.com]  urlLink Michael Moore's homepage   urlLink Christopher Hitchens attacks the film   urlLink Jason Godesky debates Hitchen's criticism point-for-point   Is it biased?  Obviously.  Does it leave important things out?  Yeah.  Is it misleading?  Partially.  Does it lie?  Actually, no.  There's a fair share of out-of-context cut-and-paste type stuff going on.  Some facts are very carefully worded.  But the truth is, Dubbya and his administration went well beyond fact-spinning and selective memory.  They, the government supposedly of, for, and by the people, lied to us.  Told us in plain language things they knew not to be true.  And take into account the amount of fact-checking that went into this film.  Selective facts yes, and you might disagree with Moore's commentary and opinions, but the questions he asks are apt and deserve to be asked.  Actually, I think Fahrenheit 9/11 should be one part in a series.  We've got our election theft / corruption / unjustified war film; we should also have one on the two-faced gutting of education, the disgraceful mess that's been made of the economy and the job market.  There could  be a trilogy of scathing documentaries dealing with the rotten things Dubbya has done to our country.  But I digress.  The film's been called propaganda, which I suppose it is.  Let's not fool ourselves, though.  Propaganda in favor of Bush and his war is everywhere.  Anyone who thinks the media in this country is "liberal" or even unbiased is living in either isolation or denial.  We've been hearing Dubbya's side of things for years, almost exclusively.  I am not a terrorist for questioning authority.  Folks in the 1950's were not communists for questioning authority.  Where there are hidden agendas, no matter how well-hidden, there will be people who smell a rat.  It's a sad day in the "free world" when so many people (good people, honest people!  But misled people) won't admit that there's a rat even when someone follows their nose, catches it, and displays it for all to see.  It's an effect of having it washed over us again and again and again.  Bouncing terror alert levels, duct tape and plastic mixed with messages to go out and fly to Disneyland and live freely.  "We're invading because of weapons of mass... erm... we found Hussein, which was our goal!"  Mixed messages scare and confuse people.  Who has brought more fear and mistrust to this country, the Taliban or our own government?  Obviously, attacking innocent Americans was a travesty.  Obviously terrorists are dangerous.  But leveraging that into social control and stripping away civil rights, that should be every bit as obviously evil.  Sending our young into harm's way so that the rich can get richer is not acceptable.  Whether you're a die-hard republican, bleeding-heart democrat, or someone with no special party affiliation, you owe it to yourself as a conscientious citizen of the United States of America to watch Fahrenheit 9/11.  See it in a theatre, wait for the DVD, copy it over the internet, it doesn't matter.  Just see it.  Preferably before you vote this November.  ;^)  You don't need to change your mind about anything if you don't want to.  If there's even a hint of openness in your mind, the film will get you thinking.  Even if your thoughts are mostly along the lines of "that can't be true, I'm going to research that", the film has still done its job.  You've got to think about this stuff, even if it's angering or depressing.  It's important.  This is our country too; it doesn't just belong to the rich and powerful.
