        Okay, so yeah I'm new to "blogging" but I get the general concept of it all. A lot of bitchin' and complain' then some funny jokes and moment to remember for life.     So, this entry is about my new job at The Home Depot. It is a major pain in the ass. The paint department was alright, just learning where things were and what kind of finish the customer wanted was the hardest part. But, the powers that be decided there wasn't enough labor $ in paint so they sent me to the Hardware department. The only thing I know about hardware is a gay boy shouldn't be working in it.    I spend roughly 3 hours a day just trying to find someone else to answer a customer question about something. I do enjoy when I actually know about what they want, and then where I can find what they are looking for. However, it never fails an older man will walk up to me asking what kind of lag screw will fit in his storm window, and then do we have stainless steal or galvanised.... UGH!

      This is my second 4th here in Buffalo. I really miss home on this day. In recent years I had gotten use to going up to knob hill right behind vanderbilt university, where you could see all of downtown Nashville. It was really cool up there, because you could see down to the Cumberland river and the fireworks the city but on. And it never failed that someone would bring along a radio, because one of the stations would have the fireworks set to music.  Yesterday, I got to thinking back about when I was a kid. How much I loved to watch the fireworks, but hated the heat and humidity of a Kentucky summer.

      Let me just say this... I'm pretty ticked off.  I'll tell you why. People are stupid.  Why in the hell do people need to open packages of merchandise, that are either (1)Clear and you can see through it. (2)It has a picture and description of it on the package.  I spend 2 hours a day putting back stuff that has been opened, torn, or broken into and then laid back on a shelf two isles away from where it goes.

      Okay... crappy title and an even worse subject to write about.  But really, what is the deal with the temperatures in WNY?  For the last few weeks it hasn't rose above 75 at best. I mean its the middle of the freakin summer. I'm used to temps in the 90s with indexs near 105. Lord knows why I miss Tennessee sometimes, cuz this is some nice a$$ weather we're having around here.
