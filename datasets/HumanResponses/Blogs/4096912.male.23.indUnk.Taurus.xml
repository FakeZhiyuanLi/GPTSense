      Your sincere smile touched my lurking heart. I see from your lips the intention to please everyone--even the kids. I don't know if that's just a feigned gesture to complement your nice looks, or just an ordinary reaction. Your eyes glisten as you try to help, they welcome the curious eyes against you.   urlLink     I wanted to see you, face to face. To journey my sight along the contours of your face. To reckon the perfect qualities of your nose, lips, and cheeks. With your kindness, a new love blossomed within me. A love that lingers only on the spur of the moment. A love that inspired me to share my smile with others.  It has been hours since we parted, and yet my thoughts haven't left that special moment... when you smiled and I smiled back ... and blinked away .

       Anyway , since I am not doing anything important right now...just viewing and contemplating on the vastness of the internet...I'll start my story-telling. I came in Singapore last February 17....I am going to add a new page for my hilarious experiences here in Singapore...but they are written in Filipino...Taglish...sorry, it's meant for my friends in the Phil...nways...Right now, March 7, I am here in Kalvin's house (Kalvin is an officemate--the jester in the room and the nicest foreigner I've met...whew! he's my immediate supervisor in the office...;)...so I'd better say everything good about him) Oh and probably, I'll reserve a page specifically for my friendly officemates here in Touchmedia...  but lemme give you a prologue..some short descriptions of them...an appetizer that would make you drool over them...hehehe... of course, let's start with my immediate boss...   urlLink      Kalvin...this humongous guy is the head of the department. I had his calling card and it was indicated there that he's the "Senior Project Manager"...well, if you'd get a chance to meet him, u'd probably wonder whether he's really a "senior"...hehe...in Filipino I might call him "ang joke na tinubuan ng mukha"...a convivial (just got that word fresh from thesaurus.com) extrovert with a comical face...oh yes, he can be an actor in any film...Kalvin:   the uncondescending jester boss    next stop, boonyong....the "senior programmer" in the dept...yeah, I got a chance to glimpse at his calling card displayed in the room--he hasn't given me one...oh, this one looked really senior, has a serious face and undoubtedly first-impression snobbish guy....but wait till you work with him...i learned from him this habit of greeting my co-workers "good morning"...i'm just wondering if all his mornings are really good..hehehe...but, this serious guy is a combat engineer--whatever that is...oh according to him, he used to diffuse bombs...that's a bit scary, knowing that Singapore is the safest place I've been to...boonyong:   the combat-engineer serious Senior programmer     the last person in the dept is julian...the first time i met this guy, i thought he was of the timid-type...but really, he was the last person in the dept that I was able to mingle with...it was I who had to approach him first...suddenly, somebody was more shy than me...at least in my own point of view...oh and the first time i saw him, i really believed that our office doesn't have any dress codes...hehehe....he wears anything he wants, slippers, shorts...all the unconventional clothes in the office...oh by the way, i am not sure if he's a "senior" programmer also, I tried looking at his calling cards but I can't find it...julian:   a timid who-cares-about-my-dress programmer    eventhough this guy is not in our dept, I really would include him in this list...michael....this aussie guy taught me the "Singapore for dummies" thing...haha...he fetch me from the airport..showed me the house where I moved in...picked me up from the house to the office on the second day, despite of his heavy work loads...and i never heard any complaints from him...hmmm...yeah I never heard any, i just ain't sure whether others hear something from him frequently...hehe...well, he's an ECE guy...same course...but he wanted to delve into hardware and stuffs...he used to be the youngest in the office...until I came...hehehe...but I think he's also the tallest...michael:   the tall aussie deep-voiced project manager  ...see, his title doesn't have the "senior" thing...so you can now guess how old the "senior" guys I described awhile ago...  I was also able to meet other people in the office, there's Mahen, Jake, Amman, Auntie Adeline, Janice, krryyn?? just listen to the sound..never mind the spelling..hehe..

       My body is weak and is about to fell ill. My soul withers and writhes in sadness, my mind fades away from the ideal--euphoria. I can't feign my troubles anymore, my body is reacting the same way as my heart. I am seeing no more happines...   Nevertheless, I cling to this world, to this wasteland--to prove myself, to keep my word--all for my pride and principle. I have disguised myself into someone I no longer recognize. I've tricked myself up to the point of mockery and stupidity. But I'll stand, I'll stay, and I'll go astray...The right path can be realized only when you are mislead. Only then do I learn, and only through that will I succeed...  -Aug 7, 2004

       urlLink     urlLink    Jumanji in the making--the real show after the fireworks display...Pictures through the courtesy of Julian, my Touchmedia friend...oops, I haven't told him that I stole his works    After traveling for almost one hour, waiting and standing in the midst of a sardine-like place for more than 30 minutes, tip-toe-ing every 5 minutes, and perspiring every second...the fireworks display showed me one thing--the sound of an explosion takes two seconds to travel into my ears.  It never thrilled me and never met my expectation. Maybe because I've been focusing too much on the inconviniences I faced just to see the popular "fireworks display". Imagine walking from places to places just to get a better view of the sky and pushing my thin body to narrow spaces. So it was a dismay when the fireworks lasted for only 10 minutes. It would really drop my jaw if the fireworks formed the Singaporean flag...waving ;P   urlLink     urlLink    One of the few fireworks I truly appreciated     Although the real sight in the event is the reaction of the people in front of me...How they keep their posture, how to grasp comfort in a fresh-air deprived atmosphere, and how they entertained themselves while waiting for the event...That is the REAL show I managed to appreciate! :D  In fairness, the fireworks were a bit entertaining...just a bit. ^-^   urlLink     urlLink    To count...only three of the not-so-numerous fireworks are worth looking at...>:)..I'm evil

      i  stand ...i  stay ...i  keep  my unfaltering pride from beaten up. Too bad I'm defending it for nothing.   Keep  me distracted throughout the year so that the longingness of home won't linger around my room. And I won't hear the wailings behind each wall.   Make  me feel the goodness of freedom, independence and responsibility.   blip..blip..

      I am tired spending the whole day doing a routinary task..hehehe...But then, do best in everything so that you can carry this attitude to your next job.  Few thoughts I managed to tinker with during the day:   The truth will set you free ...  but if you don't feel free, then maybe it's not the truth .   Laughter is the best medicine ...  but you take medicine only when you're sick, so don't laugh if you're not sick!    Love others as you love yourself ...  but if you haven't learned loving yourself, don't try to pretend that you love others.

        It's so unbearable.   Moments of a day, I spend thinking of  you ,  you , and   you  , and you and every you in my life. It wastes my time dwindling on these thoughts, yet it satisfies my heart. It does not pacify my mind, but it leaves a coveted hostility. A place where reality strikes me back and revery consoles me in. It has always been this way until both forces gets tired and put themselves in slumber... I sleep .

      We  blame  somebody because we are incapable of accepting the fact that men are not infallible with his actions, promises, decisions, and work--either because we feel too great of ourselves or we stoop down at these earthlings we're forced to mingle with. Nobody's exempted from committing this unkind attitude but somebody can stand differently when confronting this air of pride.  But just like war, there's the art of blaming. We can blame somebody by shouting straight to his face, "F**k man, what do you think you're doing?". Or we can be blame somebody in a more naive and superficial manner like, "I thought you said everything's ok?" then a grimaced smiled after that. But there are others who are in control of themselves better, they approach you and say, "I think we have a problem with your performance, can i do something to help?"   urlLink     Whichever is your style, whichever you prefer is better, be sure to face the consequences, that is, make sure that you can endure a dose of your own medicine ;) ... or better, never ever commit any mistake in your life.  ********* The worst thing that could happen when we blame somebody is when we don't know what the real story is--he might not be involved with the problem, but was just a good samaritan who tried to help. Too bad when he lend a hand, he gets the whole responsibility of the problem. So the moral lesson of the story is....always lend a hand to those who need help,  then use this hand to slap the person who's blaming you ?? *********  Q&amp;A: Promises are meant to be? a) deformed b) broken c) fulfilled d) who cares?

      I call this hide and seek. This picture had been in my folder for quite some time, so when I looked at the picture, I noticed someone standing beside the MerLion statue...sabi ko...looks family ha!...and he was wearing the same shirt I wear today...then I realized, "Of course! That's me!!"...what a coincidence...  urlLink    Singapura&nbsp; urlLink    but the truth is, the reason why I didn't get a bigger shot is because the photographer paid me a minimum amount for my talent fee, otherwise you would see my face over the merlion's body...CHEERS! PEPSI! COKE! SARSI! POP-COLA! RTO-Royal True Orange, Pinoy na pinoy!!

      I am an ordinary stripper with no other desire but to entertain the on-lookers... Ooopppss!    urlLink     One thing I noticed about Aldrin is his indelible love for his family-- no, not his wife and children coz he still has none . It makes him happy when he's able to help them in his own little means-- monetary?-- No, more than that! He believes that they are the building blocks of his life-- yeah like cells form a tissue, and tissues make up an organ?  His feeling is more of a reciprocated love, for where else can he learn and experience love for the first time but from them. A reciprocated love that has conditions and awaits gifts and rewards-- knock it off! tell the truth!!  This family he has been so ardent of does not pertain only to the immediate family he has, but it includes his uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, grammys-- oh you mean grandma? . Although sometimes he seems to be aloof with them-- that's his personality, aloof and shy to everyone.  Nevertheless, he gives high regards to these people --hmm...like a supernatural being? --No, like an extraterrestial superhero! So, you shouldn't wonder if he works arduously to earn a bigger income-- half for himself and the other half for his family, in an installment payment . That explains why he had to leave his first job so early-- hey, a year ain't that short!-- to find some greener pastures with water, butterflies, flowers, bees and trees and other extra benefits... to repeat! B-E-N-E-F-I-T-S!  And since we're already talking about his work, let's scrutinize the work habits of this guy-- just make sure they are the good habits, huh!     The most important package he desires from a job is... sleep!  This lad would shout out loud if he doesn't get at least one 8-hour sleep over a week. He loves sleep so much that he counts it everyday and sums them over a week, including the one-hour nap he does when riding a bus-- he really is a mathematician at heart!  Oh and the irony of it is that he likes to stay late in the evening-- pretty beffudling huh?!  Then, of course, wake up late in the morning, but because he has his mom as his alarm clock, he unconsciously gets up, eats, takes a bath, rides a bus... and sleep!
