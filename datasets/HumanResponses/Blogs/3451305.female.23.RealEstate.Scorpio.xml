      People say you can never be too rich, tan or thin. I always thought this was true and also thought you could never have your ducks too much in a row. Recently, my faith has been tested. I think I have (gasp!) my ducks too much in a row. Everything in my life is too organized, with little room for flexibility. Everything is in order. Maybe too much order. Sometimes I feel like I get more benefit by actually cleaning the house than I do by having it clean. Along the same lines, I think I get more benefit by arranging my ducks than by just having them all lined up. (If you are not familiar with the whole ducks in a row saying, it basically means having your shit together.)I need more ducks. I think I need more challenges. My life is too beautifully simplistic right. Now, for the most part I prefer simplicity. I like meditation time and a clear head, but I guess sometimes you can have too clear of a head. Then you start to invent problems for yourself. You give yourself a mess to figure out. I think I just need more things to organize. More ways to invest my passions in life. More outlets for my creativity. A busier schedule. Sometimes, when I have too little going on, its hard for me to do anything. But when I have a lot going on, I am forced to keep it all together and really get everything done. Like exam mode in college. Its go time. I need go time. I am in just ho hum time. I need to find something productive and fulfilling to spend my time doing. Now, I have plenty of hobbies and lots of stuff I like to do in my free time (none of which involves going out drinking, or watching pointless mind numbing TV). I want to do something that helps people. Something that leaves my mark in the world. Something that puts all my talents to good use (whatever they may be because I haven't really found all of them yet). I just want to go to bed at night fully satisfied and fulfilled with my existence in the world. Ahhh, continually on the quest for self-actualization.

      I really really love humanity...So many time during the day I am moved to tears by something beautifully human - An old couple holding hands, a child giggling, the cleaning man in my office working three jobs for little pay and still smiling. I am touched by humanity, by the good inherent in people. I know a lot of people would argue that humans are not inherently good, as there is a lot of evidence to support this. War, homicide, and abuse have been around long before civilization was developed. But at the same time, I would think that humans are innately good because the majority of people are nice, good hearted people out in the world just trying to make it, and trying to feed their family and make their mark in the world. I believe some people are inherently bad, but most people, hence, humanity is good. That said, I don't like people. When I get to know someone, when I see their little annoying habits or their toenails or the way they talk with saliva all over their mouth, I don't like them. On a large scale, people are wonderful, mysterious beings, full of life and love. But on a small scale, people are annoying, boring, and lack luster. Now that's not to say I hate everyone. Not true. For example, my boyfriend (of 4 years) is the most amazing person I ever met. And there are a few select other that I have the utmost respect for and could never my admiration. This is why I always have issues volunteering. I always feel the need, the desire to volunteer, to help people, but when I get there and I am helping people who usually don't want the help, I cant help but feel this is wasted time. I want to donate my time to someone who really needs me. Who is better off in this world because of my help. And blind people really pull my heart strings. I just cant imagine what that must be like. Not to see all the beautiful things in this world, and making through a world that relays on your sight to get by. Those people are working harder than anyone just to get around the city. But this all makes me wonder...How can I really love humanity, but not like people? Is this possible? How do I get over people's annoying habits and see in them the human element I find so fascinating?

      So I am sitting here at working trying not to work but to instead think about my life...how I want to live it, what I need to change, what I need to do better, what I am doing fabulously and just how great and shiny my hair looks today. I try very hard to keep my life neat and orderly, you know...like always having my ducks in a row. And for the most part, I do have my ducks in a row, but there are always nagging little things that just don't fit in my life the way I want them to. For intense, my job. Its just some job. Some entry level, the boss always needs to know where you are, please fax this, 9-5 monotony job in a building with hideous green carpet and disorganized boxes everywhere. So, aside from being totally meaningless and unfufilling, I can atleast wear whatever I want to the office everyday. Which brings me to my obsession. Clothes. Not just clothes, I love shoes and handbags, and jewelry and make-up and scarves and belts, and beach blonde hair. But, clothes will always be my first love. I will always pour over Vogue or Bazaar. I will always know when I first feel in love with Manolos or when I first discovered the sexiness of Gucci or how much I loved Carolina Herrera's Fall 2003 collection. But, I am just some working girl with no money for such things. Unfortunately, my clothing trips are basically limited to H&M, Old Navy and Forever 21. But I don't just wear cheap clothes, I basically buy cheap shirts and accessories and buy Citizen or Seven jeans and always a pair of stilettos. But, I have already spent myself into a oblivilon and won't have any money for Fall shopping if I continue on my path.

      I don't know about your childhood, but mine seemed to set a very clear picture of my future. I thought I had no choice in my path in life. It was all laid out for me. There wasnt much room to grow out of my social class or my parents way of life. It seemed, I was doomed to middle-class, rural life forever. But somewhere along the way, I realized I wasnt trapped at all. I was totally free to change the course of my life at any given moment. I have the ability to design my own life. It is my mind's eye that creates my experiences.   I am the only one who can design my life. I am not pinned down to any particular path or way of life or thought process. That means, I can come from a little town in the middle of Wisconsin, and end up living a fabously cosmopolition life if I so choose. It is my life. Not my parents, not my peers. I design my life based on my personality and interests. I can do anything! Maybe I want to move to Maine and live in a beautiful white washed house on a private island and wear Ralph Lauren cable knit sweaters at night and have a little red and white sail boat. Totally immerse myself in New England culture. Then maybe I want to move to the south of France and live in a little villa there and buy fresh bread every morning.I can live as many lives as I want, never having to stay the same person or stay in the same place. I can choose any life that is totally different from my little life growing up in middle-class Wisconsin. Thats the beauty of living in this county in this day in age - you create your own life and future totally independently of your past.  Maybe I would like to immerse myself in the California culture (that is really where my heart lies. Somehow at birth I was misplaced in Wisconsin, when I have a true California heart). Its amazing to me that I have the ability to choose my destiny. Its just all very exciting.   Most people don't end up tapping into this amazing ability. So many of my friends from high school ended up with out jobs, no college degree, still drinking and doing drugs and wasting away in the same little town they vowed to leave as soon as high school was over. But my life is totally different now then when I was 15. I would never have been able to see how my life would change and how I would change as well. I am a totally different person and have a totally different life to go with it.

      I am suddenly hit by an overpowering desire to find meaning in my life. To escape the boredom of the so-called daily grind. How did I get here? To this point where I am just living for weekends. I am so entirely unfulfilled with my job, it makes me depressed. I need more. I need adventure. Excitement. I need to feel fulfilled. I want to be excited in the mornings when I wake up. I want to feel like what I do matters to people. I want to be needed. I want to feel I have a sense of greater purpose. I know a lot of people get to this point and turn to God. I have already been down that road and just cannot put faith in something that to my reasonable mind does not exist (or at least does not have proof of existing). But that is why there is always a god in every culture. People need meaning. People need to feel that they 'toil under the sun' for a greater purpose. All their actions revolve around pleasing a god. Like I have said, I have already been down that road. I want to find meaning in self-actualization, in expressing myself. I want to find my place in the world.

      I always get Sunday night free floating anxiety.  I don't know what it is but knowing that I have to go to work on Monday morning always freaks me out. I remember the good old college days where I could sleep right through my Monday morning class. Not so anymore. I think the most stressful part of work is the politics. The social games. The always having your work face on. I don't want to live to work, I want to work to live. I want to only work part time, then use the rest of my time for self development. Reading, learning, watching documentaries, going to museums, learning to paint, volunteering, working out, journaling, traveling, practicing yoga, getting peticures. How wonderful would that be. And why not do that? Why stay trapped in the 9-5 mentality. I will not be chained to a mentality or way of life just because everyone else does it or my parents did it. At the end of the day, its my life. And how short and sweet it is for certain. This is my time on the planet. I will live it my way. I will not be trapped. I am free.
