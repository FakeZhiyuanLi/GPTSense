       i think it's interesting warm weather brings out all types of pple and makes pple act out in ways they wouldn't if the weather was a little less perfect. i think it's pretty hilarious. ... the other day, one of my best friends and i went out to eat at Bennigan's. from the moment we walked in the door, at least 6 pple had questions or comments to make. a waiter, not ours, was walking by while we were looking at the menu and in passing made a suggestion about what to order - how often does  that  happen? in the span of about 6 hrs, 4 guys tried to hit on me.... in random places, at random times (of course not caring that i'm in a relationship or anything.....)    that brings me to another point... do guys realize how stupid they sound when they use the line - "u gotta man? so we can't be friends?" - nah ni**a... i don't want to be ur friend... damn.

       everyday i learn something new. i am surrounded by people of all different backgrounds and a wealth of knowledge. i feel like a sponge, always absorbing, always expanding, always learning.   i love it!   i am so happy to be blessed with the opportunities that have been given to me... the business relationships that i am forging with my colleagues... the friendships that i am developing......... big things are on the way. big things.....

         so tomorrow's my birthday... and i'm turning  23 . it shouldn't be such a big deal but when i say it, that number seems so much bigger than 22. nothing really changes as far as new priveledges or anything, but there's just something about that number that makes me feel like....  damn. i'm grown as hell.

      it's a monday... and a lovely one at that. when the new year started, my life was turned upside down and inside out.... so much was going on that i didn't know what to think or what to do with myself, with my life, with anything.......... but, now, i am so happy. the Lord gave me what He knew i could handle and everything's getting back on track. not only is the weather great right now, but my job is great. my apartment is great. my family is good (lol)... the luv of my life is back in my life... i could go on, but i am glad that i am finding my way again. i try to stay positive and patient (a part of my resolution for the new year)

      it's already  may 17th . i can't believe it. last weekend, i went to duke to see one of my best friends graduate (sniff... sniff). sitting in the bleachers of wallace wade stadium, it really hit me that i've been 'grown' for a whole YEAR now. it felt like just yesterday that i was sitting down in the same spot, anticipating the moment when it would all be over. officially.   it feels like yesterday when i came back to this area. when i started this great job at this great consulting firm. when i moved into my apartment. and now... i'm being requested by name to travel across the country with different projects. doing web development on the side for a couple of independent entrepenuers (? lol)... and everyday, my schedule grows and grows. putting in a lot of hours, but i'm loving every minute of it. learning the business. learning new skills. networking. no one told me life was gonna be like this after college.

       i know i know.... it's been a minute since i've updated this blog-thing. but my schedule's been pretty hectic (and will be for a little while longer...). let me give u an example of what's been going on.... today at work, someone from another project comes to me to ask if i'd be interested in helping their team do security testing on their current project.   sure. i have some experience and a extra time... and since i'm being requested and all......    he explains some of the details of the project and what kind of testing they need.    ok... no problem    so where is the testing? in new jersey... when? tomorrow...    tomorrow?!    so that's what i'm doing. going to new jersey.  tomorrow.

         so last week, i finally made it to the  west coast . (LA to be exact) even though it was for work, i had a  blast . the coworkers who went, also made a difference. one thing that blew my mind is how friendly everyone was!... imagine this: tuesday evening. happy hr. 2 for 1 special. small place, with about 50 monitors of all sizes - no matter what direction u face, u will c a screen or 2 or 5. lakers game comes on and the place is getting more and more crowded. but... it's not hot in there. it's right on the beach and the front windows are open, letting in the cool ocean air. no one's smoking - (?!?!). everyone's chillin. the game pauses, commercials come on music plays instead. my 2 coworkers and i have 3 stools at the bar, half way between the front door and the bathroom. no matter how crowded it gets, there is always a cleared path to walk. pple didn't just stop and stand in the middle of the floor (i couldn't believe it... u could tell that pple weren't just wrapped up in themselves like the wide majority of pple u will find in northern VA.) try to walk easily through a crowded sports bar in VA... good luck. anyway... throughout the game, music gets louder, game gets louder, pple get drunker (? lol) the energy in the room is increasing. the lakers win. happy hr's over. 15 minutes later, the party begins. the beat drops and chaos ensues (still with the path for pple to walk between the front door and the bathroom). everyone's dancing. old. young. men. women. tall. short. white. black. everyone. LOL. the bench cushions are gone, and females are standing on the platforms with colored lights flashing everywhere.... we'd only expected to stay for happy hr and didn't leave til 6 hrs later :)  ok. so the next half of the week, i spent in montreal! i was so excited to go for a lot of reasons - the major one being that one of my best friends was getting  married sniff sniff  and i was in the wedding :) i also got to hang out with my girls i hardly  ever  get to see, even though we all live within 30 minutes of each other. montreal was beautiful. clean city... clean air... the land is really flat so if u stand in the right place, u can see country land, the city skyline, mountains, and endless miles of sky all at the same time.   to be continued..... (i have a meeting :) )

      the male species is probably one of the most frustrating phenomenons in the world... i've always wondered if they think before they say something. as time goes on, i'm being more and more convinced that they don't.

         on the last leg of my final trip back to the east coast last week, i was watching out of the window of the plane as we flew over the clouds. it was like i was in a different world. it was beautiful. it made me feel at peace... i realized that i am at the point in my life where everything is falling into place. i luv what i do, my family is happy and healthy, i am surrounded by positive and supportive people, and i'm learning and growing everyday. i wouldn't say i'm stress free, but i feel like i have the support i need to make it through anything that comes my way  p.s. 'nube nueve' means 'cloud nine' en espanol ;)

      i'm giving my apartment a facelift. granted... i've only been there for 6 months, but it was time for a change. so i started doing some online shopping. now that all of my deliveries are coming in, it feels like christmas in august. i luv to change things around every once in awhile... keeps it interesting. a fresh, new look. new colors. new style. rearrange the furniture... something. i c how online shopping can become addictive... all of the stores offering deals and giving u coupons. then after it's all done, it's brought right to ur door. it's great lol.....
