      Not much to talk about anymore.  Stepped into a new echelon of the human condition.  I think I may get horns installed into my forehead. They seem more fitting.

      I see the ugliness in everything.  I see the smog that has tainted our skies.  I see the horror that blackens the rays of sun.  I see the poison that darkens the clouds.  I see the pestilence that strangles the trees.  I see the sludge that pollutes the vast ocean.  Call me whatever you will, I see it.  I see that we have made this earth hideous, and that there is not a single thing that has been spared our vile touch.  But I also see the beauty in everything.  In the flowers, in the faces of humans, in everything. Everything has its own beauty. The only problem with me is that I can see everything that has corrupted it. I, alone, can see the truth.   Robert Zend wrote an interesting little poem, called "World's Shortest Pessimistic Poem" and it reads:    Hope?

      Just now I realized I've spelt irrevocable wrong for the last little while. O well, it's not like I can go back and CHANGE it. God forbid anything should ever change.   My Guardian Angel status has been revoked. The woman I tried to care for, the woman I tried to help, has fled from me. I knew I would not be able to help her if I could not help myself.   I remember back to a day, it must've been in february or so, although I'm not entirely sure. Her, her boyfriend and I were all in my room, him and I were watching TV. After a little bit of talking, I realized just how much him and I are alike. I remember us finishing each others sentences, saying the exact same things at the exact same times. But it was deeper than that. I knew, that inside him and I were just the same. We were all the same. That is why she chose us. I remember him leaving the room, and me saying to her, that "our destinies had become intertwined." What that meant was that everything that happened to him or to I would affect the other, in much the same way as it did with her. My desinty had now been spun in three directions. One with her. One with her boyfriend. One with me. They must've thought I was full of shit at the time, but now I realize that my prediction was (as always, haha) correct.   She should be back in town very soon. I have not heard from her in a while. I fear I will not recognize her when she returns. Although I know I will.  My little island is drifting farther and farther off the coastline, although, the entire time I knew it would.

      Well, I'm at my dad's house right now, he's out of town for 5 days, he told me he didn't quite know where, himself, but he figured he would just go wherever the wind would take him.  He has hired me to babysit the house/dog/cats while they are gone. I'm sure the next five days will be filled with fun and exitement.  Yah. Damn near all of my friends are more allergic to cats than I am, and my dad has TWO. So that's the end of that plan.  I think I may get a job in the month of august, mostly because I may NEED it to help pay for my braces. My family is in dire straits right now, what with the breakup and all, and money will be very tight. Very.  Any hopes of leaving town this summer for a vacation have been shattered.  On the plus side, I just had a soothing bubble bath, I'm about to read the IKEA catelogue, then I'm going to watch White Oleander, and there's nothing you homophobes can do about it!!!   Lets talk a little bit about my father and I.  Since around age fifteen, my father has had a drinking problem. Alcohol ran his life. It was only after his wife (my mother) left him, and when he had the gun literally pointed at his head was he saved.  He had lost everything and was about to end it all, when my grandmother called him on the phone, and told him he should go to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. From that day on he has never once picked up a drink. He was saved.  I thank him for being who he is. Although I only get to see him every other weekend, I thank him for making me who I am. If HE hadn't started going to meetings, I wouldn't have been able to go with him. I've been in the program for sixteen years, I've seen the mistakes he has made, and I have seen the mistakes countless others have made, and as a result, I will not make those same mistakes. Because of my father, I will never drink, I will never do drugs, I will never get myself into any of the awful things he was in.  He made every mistake in life so that I don't have to. He couldn't be a better father than he is right now.  Ciao for now.

      We went on our first bona-fide adventure last nite/this morning.  We wanted to go see "Some Kind of Monster" and it was showing at 10 o clock at some downtown theatre and at Westhills. For some reason I decided on westhills, perhaps because I knew how to get there.  So we hop on the c-train, then catch a bus up to the richmond area, where we enter a place that the bus does its turnaround, so we get off. Then the bus drives off to the theatre. It didn't turn around. OK, first minor setback. We had been wondering about what time it was, so we go up to a gas station to see if we can find out. It's closed. The closing time was 10. So we ran all the way to the theatre, only to have some guy tell us that it's 9:50. We had asthma attacks for nothing! We get up to the till, and overhear a patron talking with the clerk, and the clerk said that this would be the last nite the film would be shown in Calgary. Thank God we didn't miss it! He would've killed me where I stood! After some chitchat with some fellow fans (which happened to include the clerk) we went and did the deed. Yes, I mean the movie.  The documentary was good, and revealed a lot of things. St. Anger makes a lot more sense now. I don't want to say that it was just a bunch of crap they threw together while sitting there...But...Well, before St. Anger, what would happen was Lars and James would get together, write a bunch of songs, then show up and tell all the band members what to play. That didn't work, and caused a bunch of tumult within the band, so they decided on a more open approach, where all of the members input their thoughts. I liked it better the other way. Anyways, I got to see a different side of the band, which was good. I found out Jason Newstead is a prick anyways, and that they almost hired Twiggy Ramirez of Marilyn Manson to replace him. Thank God for Robert Truijilo. (I THINK I spelled that right, but try saying THAT name 10 times really fast!)  So the movie ends, and we look at the clock, and it's 12:30! The buses don't run anymore! Well, since I knew where we were and how to get where we were going (which was home) we started to walk, in the dark, at 11:30 to the other freaking end of the city. We stopped at Mac's for coffee, but both ended up getting sick off of it. Yay. After about an hour and a half of walking, we hadn't even made it downtown yet! We were down on 17th ave, and actually had been searching for a phone booth so we could call a cab, as it had been raining for the duration of our journey. All the phone booths we had found didn't have phone books in them, but we lucked out and this one did. So we called a cab, and after a few more minutes of waiting, finally hopped in a cab, and arrived home a little after 2 am. Oh well, mom, at least I showed up alive!  I think we experienced something that every teenager should go through at least once, and I kinda enjoyed it up until the part where it started raining. Oh well, I'm here now, and I don't have pneumonia, so I'm happy.

      With the advent of such shows as "Queer Eye For The Straight Guy" and "What Not To Wear," a recent trend among westernized societies has occured: Metrosexuality. This ridiculous and perplexing fad is characterized by looking and acting gay, but not actually being gay. The fringe benefits of homosexuality, but without the anal-sex. What fringe benefits, you ask? Well, for starters, women LOVE gay men, they are polite, fashionable, well-groomed, well-mannered, in touch with their emotions and overall, just good company for women. A gay guy is the bestest best girlfriend you never had, ladies.  My only beef about this current fad is that I invented it three years ago!!!  All of grade nine I got teased for being&nbsp;a "fag" and I wasn't even gay! Now that I think back, I sure as hell dressed like it, and sure as hell acted like it, but I never once dated a guy! Here the networks are, making millions of all them guy-makeover shows....Dammit.  I really truly invented it though! Ask any of my female friends, they all refer to me as their girldriend! In fact, more than half of my friends are girls. They say I'm different than any of their other guy friends, I can talk about my feelings, I can go shopping with them, I can go into the lingerie store and pick out bras with them if the need should arise! Some of them regard me as one of their closest friends simply because of the special metro-guy-to-female bond that we share.  Those millions are mine! MINE I SAY!&nbsp;  But then again, what if 10 years down the road, I turn out the be actually gay? Ugh, no way, men are god damned pigs. Hahah.  &nbsp; Does anybody watch that "Queer as Folk" show? No, it's not another make over show, it's a Showcase series about gay dudes. Now I know for sure I've been watching too much Showcase. I think it's an incredibly good take on the lives of gay men in this day and age. Unlike Will and fucking Grace. That has to be the worst portrayal of gay men I have ever seen. This one is more realistic and more down to earth. Why just last nite, this trans-sexual got beaten to&nbsp;a bloody pulp by some other guys. The odds of something like happen, I think, are quite real enough to be scary.  I know that if I were gay, I would be afraid to be open about it. Even in our free nation, homosexuals are antagonized all of the time. By the government, by their friends, by even just random people. Some people are so against the subject of homosexuality that to even mention it upsets them. The church views it as a sin.  There was this girl in my Career And Life Management class who was openly gay. We were having a class discussion about homosexuality, and the subject of violence towars gays was brought up. Most of the class had the idea in their head that our school was quite an open and tolerant environment, and that such opression did not occur. So then she pipes up and says "Are you fucking kidding me!? I have permanent bruises on my hips and shoulders from being punched and shoved into lockers!!!" That sure shut the class the hell up.  I bet you if I told my family, even jokingly, that I was gay, that they would disown me right that very instant.  Society itself would shun me, and I would be pushed into somewhat of an underground community with the rest of the homosexuals of this proud, proud nation. If I were to go into a regular bar with my boyfriend, hold hands, neck, or&nbsp;do whatever, do you think the owner, let alone the patrons, wouldn't kick our asses or kick us out? I think we would end up at a gay bar. And there we would have to stay, in the shadows of society. Jesus, Ralph Klein opposes gay marriages. We would be even less like everyone else in that, even if we loved each other, we wouldn't be able to get married. Some land of the free this is.  I however, admire the gay community of this nation for their courage. They brave opression from damn near everyone, and remain adamant in their quest for utmost freedom. But wait, I thought they were already free? NOT. There are a lot more than laws to change before they can be truly set free. There are people. Millions and millions of people. Millions of homophobes. Millions uneducated on the subject.  Oh, and for the record,&nbsp;even though HIV&nbsp;first surfaced among gay males in America, that doesn't mean every homo is HIV positive, ya dumb bastards.  &nbsp;  I'm metrosexual and damn proud of it!  *waves around slightly altered pride-flag*  &nbsp; Oh, and one more thing about that Queer as Folk show, ladies, there is plenty of guy-on-guy action...More than I care to see in any given day...But still.  Actually, I haven't really heard of a lot of women that get turned on by guy-on-guy action, whereas it's "every man's dream" to see two women goin at it.  Something I never quite understood....  &nbsp;   "Life is not a lie if you believe it."    &nbsp; Apparently, that quote has something to with rationalization or something or other. Is life only what you make of it? What if you make it into something that it really, truly isn't? What if you're just assuming that it's one thing in order to rationalize your horrible actions. Is tofu really made out of Soy? Or is it just Play-Do?  I think a lie is a lie, believing it doesn't make it any more true (or not true)&nbsp;than it already is, and vise versa. Take, for example, Mr. Bush and his war on terrorism. Suppose his allegations that there were weapons of mass destruction, and that Iraq had ties to Al Queda were true, and not out-and-out lies. Then his war would indeed be justified either way, wouldn't it? Well, how about the fact that there are more dead Iraqi&nbsp;women and children because of the war than every single person that was killed in the world trade centre attack. I think he's crossed the line of justification, vindication, or revenge, or whatever you call it, and stepped into crusade territory.  Did you even see what they did to the city of Baghdad? They hammered that place with explosives until it was in shambles. What they did adds up to about 6 or 7 world trade centre attacks.  And ties to Al Queda!? So what!? All of America, and more notably, the Bush family has had ties to Al Queda for years. Military funding to Afghanistan...Transporting Al Queda officials out of the country....Harboring countless terrorists. America is as much to blame for the terrorist attacks as Iraq is. In fact, let's face it, America IS the terrorist. In every sense of the word. They have brought terror to this world.  Even if any of that bullshit was true or otherwise, a war is a war, and war is wrong. There&nbsp;was never any need to kill thousands of people.  &nbsp;  "We criticize in others what we fear within ourselves."   However true or untrue this is, I think it applies rather well to me. I know that I'm always criticizing my friends for doing things wrong, like eating unhealthy or not excercising regularly, or not caring so much about the environment, etc. Perhaps it is because they still have a chance to save themselves from their flaws.  &nbsp; You know what I can't quite get over, even to this day? How the fuck did the Liberals win the 2004 election!? HOW!? I just don't get it! Who in their right mind would vote for fucking Paul Martin!? Bah.  Oh well, by the time the 2012 election rolls around, I will be&nbsp;a more-than-eligible cantidate.  But I'm not going to win the 2012 federal election with just sardonic wit and empty promises.  Oh, wait, YES I AM!!!  MUHAHAHAHAHAHAH!

      &nbsp;  Whos bright idea was it to call this thing a "Blog"? Seriously, that has to be the one of the dumbest things I have ever heard. Then again, I don't think they would have appealed to a male demographic larger than 10% if they called it an "Online Diary Thingy."  &nbsp;  Let's see, I got some Chinese food, and theres a fortune cookie. Before I go on to tell you my illustrious fortune, let me tell you about Chinese food. Chinese food that we eat here is nothing like it actually is in China,&nbsp;including the&nbsp;insanely high MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) content that clogs your blood vessels. Do you honestly thing that Chinese people eat ginger beef, chicken balls and fried rice every damned day? The answer is no. Pretty much the only thing you'll find on the menu in an ACTUAL Chinese restaurant that resembles ANY of the crap they serve here is the rice. They eat things there that you can't even imagine. And it's damn good, too.  The whole Chinese food deal they've got going on here in North America is awful. It gives everyone on this bloody continent a skewed concept of asian lifestyle, pushing bias on us in a suttle, but still existant manner.  Here's an example, and here's what my fortune cookie says:  "Confucius say: Show-off always shown up in showdown."  First off, most Chinese people don't even know what a fortune cookie is. This is mostly because it was yet another dumb idea developed by the western culture.  Second, that has to be the single most racist thing I have ever seen towards the Chinese culture. What? Does every Chinese person talk in some ridiculous accent missing bits and pieces of sentences? NO.  Third, that isn't even a fortune! A fortune is: "You will be struck by a bus at 11:35 pm next teusday."  But hey, there are lotto numbers, or at least, what I presume to be lotto numbers on the back. If only I were old enough to buy lottery tickets....  &nbsp; Six days until I get braces. Six days until I'll be not only unable to smile, but afraid to do so when I actually am happy, in fear of showing of my ridiculous metal aperture to everybody. And it's all for beauty! What I hypocrit I am! Well no, that's not entirely true, the orthodontist says that further complications could arise down the road...And I didn't even think my teeth were that bad...*sniffle*  Six days. When the new school year comes, I probably won't even smile on photo day. I will have my braces soon before then. I will be "The Boy Who Never Smiled."  &nbsp; On a much lighter note, I have coined a new "suprised" phrase. Some people say "Holy crap!" or "WTF!?" Me, I used to say "Jesus Tapdancing-Christ!" Well now, I have a new phrase:  "SWEET ZOMBIE-JESUS!!!"  Just to be clear, I don't hate God, I hate religion. Remember, go God, booo religion.  *gets struck by lightning out of nowhere*

      Christina Aguilera. Biggest. Slut. Evar. And yet people all over the world drool over her. She's beautiful? If I had to choose between sleeping with her and a certain someone, I've already made my decision, and I'll give you a hint; it isn't the ugly blonde "pop princess."  You know, I was watching this show on TLC today, I forget the name, but it's about cosmetic surgeons and whatnot. Two of the women in the show, in particular, stand out.   &nbsp; The first&nbsp;was a woman of around age 45, and she was damn hot for her age! She still had a pretty face, and deep set eyes with big upper eyelids. She didn't have the largest breats in the world, and the&nbsp;right one was gone due to cancer. So she goes in for breast implants, which is understandable because of the lost one, and she gets brought up to a small B size. Ok. She didn't get 38DD's, thats a good thing. But then she also gets some facial surgery. She gets the doctors to remove some of her upper eyelids so that her brow doesn't cover so much of her eye. I thought the way her eyes were fit her face PERFECTLY. She was already hot! She worked out, she ran every day! That's what I call sexy! But here the doctors are all like "Oh, she's disfigured. She needs the surgery if she ever wants to feel good about herself again..." crap blah bullcrap blah blah.  Then there's the second one, she was young, pretty, nice body, not anorexically skinny, etc. Her only quip is that she has somewhat of a large nose, with an arch at the top of it. Her brothers teased her and said that she looked like the parrot she kept in her room. What the fuck kind of shit is that? And her best friend got SOOO mad at her. Her best friend (as well as her boyfriend, but it was a suprise for the boyfriend)&nbsp;already thought that she was gorgeous, and thought that she shouldn't need to get surgery to feel good about herself. The girl getting the surgery kinda pisses me off. I, too, thought her nose fit her face just fine the way it was. She's already got a boyfriend, who's she trying to impress!?  This is how shallow the oceans of the world are.  People these days are so conerned about beauty and fashion and looking good and blah blah fucking blah.  Everyone is beautiful. Everyone is beautiful in their own special way. Somewhere out there, there is somebody that thinks you are the most beautiful person alive.  Everyone is beautiful, but society has this (rather skewed) concept of what beauty is. Beauty today is weighing one hundred pounds, while maintaining large breasts and a thin waist. Beauty is throwing up every day to keep skinny. Beauty is injecting poison into your face&nbsp;so it doesn't get lines.  Our society's beauty is terrible. It makes people all over the world feel like shit. Why, because they don't look like the current fad?  Beauty is what you make of it.  To some, beauty is a big brain. To others, beauty is big biceps. Beauty is different from eye to eye among human beings. Why does our society try and make it into one thing, one identical thing, for everybody to see?  You are beautiful.

      Well, I'm about to do the unthinkable. Yes. That's right.   &nbsp;  I've been working out for two months now, and have not seen any results, so I'm doing the unthinkable. I wanted to do things naturally, to just go to the gym. Now I'm going to start taking....Protein supplements! Yes, at first you though steroids. But no, no steroids for I. I like my testicles the way they are: existant. Hopefully the extra protein will help me put on some muscle, I just hope I don't get really fat. Perhaps a low intensity supplement would be best, since I'll lose most of it in my urine anyways, and I don't want to change my diet too drastically all at once.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Enough of that boring jazz. Lets get some ranting off our minds.   Lets rant about....HIM.   Here He is, complaining about how he gets bad grades in school and that he can't learn. Let's take English, for example.   Maybe He would learn things a little better if he didn't sit there talking and reading magazines all day! Maybe if he actually put his mind to it, he would do good. What does it matter how much concentration he puts into it anyways, it's English! He SPEAKS English! My best guess would be that he is doing this as an excuse to get closer to her. You know, late night study sessions, dependance, nurturing. It makes better sense.   He puts more god damned effort into that band of his than he does into his schoolwork. His band...He's got the whole punk rock thing going on, and yet still he insists on listening to rap music! He's in a punk band! Gahh...   &nbsp;  Ok, so hes got this thing where, if emotionally overstimulated or really scared or whatever, he goes into this like drug induced state. I was skeptical at first when he told me this. In fact, I (obviously) still am. Sometimes I think he's just full of shit. I won't believe him until I see some medical records. But that's just the way I am. He couldn't even name the malfunctioning part of his brain that was causing the problem! It's the amygdala! Everyone knows that!!!   Now, we'd known each other for quite some time, but it was only in recent months when he told me of this. When I think back (often to before he told me), I can think of a number of occurances which would have triggered one of his episodes, but didn't.   We are all in the drama room, and this big guy storms in and starts yelling at Him, telling him he's gonna beat the shit out of him. For starters, getting threats like those would have been enough, but there's more to my suspision than that. Before He came here, he would get beat up an awful lot, which is apparently the cause of his condition. Having people threaten you would surely bring brack the trauma of such events, further stimulating the episode. No reaction.   Then, there's the subject of his mother. Now, here she is, yelling at him and treating him like garbage, when she knows full well that she could trigger an episode, or possibly even kill him. KILL. Yes, it HAS come close. Doesn't she know? Doesn't she?   Plus, why isn't he taking any sort of preventative medication? Some depressants or something. He has MORE than enough money to pay for medical treatment of any sort. The docs say that another good blow to the head could indeed kill him. One of my friends bashed his head against the wall pretty darn good one time. He ain't&nbsp;lookin any worse to me.   Then there's this one time he trips on a skateboard in his hallway in the dark (I know, I know), and whacks his head on the wall. No bleeding, no concussions, just a good bump on the 'noggin. Yet, he goes into one of his episodes, craziness and all. My guess would be to garner attention. "Help me, love me, I'm a wounded dove..." HA! Do you have any idea just how thick and how strong a human skull IS. You have to hit that thing pretty fuckin hard to do any damage, not to mention that the most you will do without killing yourself is a concussion. And he was just fine the next day, so that rules THAT option out.   &nbsp;   ...She may have wanted it, you bastard, but you could have stopped it at any time. Ya know. Use some JUDGEMENT. YOU. YOU. YOU. YOU. YOU.   &nbsp;   Here I am, dispensing more and more hate, yet again. It appears I, myself, am no better.

      You know what? Humans are horny little fuckers. It's all sex-sex-sex, everywhere you go. Companies thrive off of it, corporations sell their products with it. People try every day to get. Some people make a living out of it.  &nbsp;  It's weird, it's 11:30, but it feels like 3 am. I guess it's because my entire sleep/wake cycle is out of whack. I din't sleep at all the night before, and I doubt I will tonight. What&nbsp;the hell is keeping me awake!? I love sleep! AAAAAAAGH!  Whatever.  That quiz that's in the very first bit of my blog, I lied on it. I DO daydream. I dream every day. What do I dream of, you ask? Why, I dream of that which I seek. My mind paints me pictures of a future that does not exist, and I gawk at it like&nbsp;an American tourist looking at The Mona Lisa.  I dream of nights, when her and I are living together, and we have just finished dinner, but I am rather dissatisfied with the mundane meal, so I yell "You call this dinner, bitch!?" and she yells back "YOU MADE IT!!!" And yes, I did, indeed cook dinner. Then we both smile and laugh together. It's ok.  I dream of us driving down the raod together. To where, we do not know, but that does not matter, all that matters is the&nbsp;journey and the people involved; her and I. We both know this. It's ok.  The way things are looking, I don't suppose I'll ever sleep again. Rather, sleep will change into drifting off during the day into the world that I seek most. Until, one day, either by tans-substantiation, or reality itself, I am for once placed in those dreams in the stead of my imagination.  It's eleven thirty, I'm sitting here in my underwear, as per usual, writing this very post.  &nbsp; You know, we've all changed. I'm an even bigger bitterer, more cynical killjoy than I was before. With an&nbsp;ego the size of Louise Brooks' neglige taped to my already proposterously sized head.  She has become belligerent, belligerent like HIM. She has become, oh, I don't quite have the word for it, all head-in-the-clouds-believing-nonsense-resenting-the-harsh-truth-like (I'm sorry, my IQ is down a few points, and I am at a loss for words), just like HIM!  I shouldn't even be mad at a thing like this. But I am. The fact that she is becomming more and more like him, relating and liking him&nbsp;more and more, shocks me to the very core. I know it shouldn't but it fucking does. And damn me straight to hell for it.  That night, when she got me to list off things about him that would make her hate him, I knew I had failed. I knew that, no matter how long that list got,&nbsp;her feelings were irevocable. That sort of thing is only a last-ditch eforrt. I knew I would soon be walking down that same path again. Lo and behold, here I am! The path is a little different, perhaps the seasons have changed or something, but it sure as hell is the same path. I shouldn't be ranting about this. I shouldn't be saying a lot of the shit I say. Why? Because it is going to cost me everything, that's why.  Him. Him. HIM. HIM! It beguiles me. It pains me.  &nbsp; Which feels worse: killing or being killed?  The answer to that one is obvious for someone in my vantage point. Killing is worse. Killing is horrible.&nbsp;I am killing. It makes me feel horrible. You are what you do, I say.  &nbsp;  Some how, "I told you so" just doesn't cut it.

      I can't stay awake for very much longer.  Did you know that the light from the sun takes approximately seven minutes to reach earth. If the sun were to explode, it would take seven minutes before us earthlings realized it. I have seven minutes.  7  The superhero fell down today. I scraped my knee. Is that my one weakness? My "krypton?" I'm doubtful about that one.  I'm also doubting whether or not I'm a hero after all. Maybe I'm a superVILLIAN! Yes, that certainly would make sense, what with all the maiming, the hurting and the harm-causing.  No, I'm neither hero nor supervillian. Just your typical human jackass.&nbsp;Same weaknesses as everyone else. Same inhibitons, same ambitions, same everything.  6  My faults, my shortcommings, multiply like the blemishes on my face. Pockmarked with multi-faceted fault, I can see the error in my ways.  5  I can't even be happy. In fact, I've reached the point, that "if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me!" mode. I can't even let anybody else be happy. I drag them down to my level.  Perhaps I do not wish to be alone.  No, no I'm just a selfish prick.  Oh, another fault. What great fun this is.  I think I have room for improvement now.  People change, and so must I.  4  That was longer than seven minutes.  Falling down a well I've already fallen into.  Like every alcoholic, over and over again, expecting different results.  Slipping.  Adieu.

      The Damned; that will be my superhero name. The hero himself is damned, but he is still a hero nonetheless. The Damned. What's my special power? Tune in next week to find out!  &nbsp; I've been thinking. I've been thinking about abortions and gay marriages (both of which Bush opposes, I might add).  I'm not 100% for abortions. We are thus far uncertain as to whether or not the fetus can be considered alive at any given point and time, and, even though it probably isn't conscious, I'm still against killing in general. Now let me get to my point, even though I'm not an avid supporter, I don't think it's up to me to decide whether or not a woman can get an abortion. I don't think it is anybody's choice but the woman's. Not the president, not the fucking Pope himself. I say let women at least have the option. Whether it was rape, accidental, or they just flat out don't want to have the kid, then at least let the option be there for those who want and/or need it.   This is North America for fuck's sake. I thought this was the land of freedom and liberty. Operative term: THOUGHT.  Now on to gay marriages. When a man and a man, or a woman and a woman love each other, how is it any different from when two members of the opposite sex love each other? The love I have for my father is that same as the love I have for my mother, is it not? Marriage is not about what is right or what is wrong, it is not about what is sin and what is not.   God doesn't care if two homos love each other. There's nothing he can do to stop them. Why should the church care if God doesn't? All love is universal. And that is what marriage is. It is the sacred, undying bond between two people who love each other very much. In God's eyes, we are all equal, are we not? Why should hetero couples be considered more equal than others?  People just can't fucking handle anything that doesn't fit into their definition of normal.  Humans are naturally inept to change.  Oh, and the church is fucking full of shit. Doing everything in the name of God to change the world into what they want it to be. I'm sure God was just overjoyed with the religious crusades in the middle east (that last to this very day, I might add). Or how about the slaughter of both the native americans and their beliefs. They did all that in God's name, too. Oh, then there's all those "witches" they burned back in the day, during the Salem witch trials. Oh yes, they most certainly were heretics. All 500 of them innocent villiagers. And I certainly am not sarcastic in the least.  If I were God, I'd be fucking pissed of at the Catholic church.  Marrying the one you love is a sin?  Not going to pile of bricks every sunday is a sin?  Having sex with a condom is a sin!?  God doesn't care who you marry.  God doesn't care if you worship him every damned day. He doesn't need us to worship him.  Using protection to stop the sperm from entering the woman's body is not murder, ya catholic dumbfucks.  And have you even READ ANY of the bible!? The New Testament is like the polar opposite of the Old Testament, not to mention the bible, catholics everywhere, and the church contradict themselves and their religion all the time.  And the stuff in the bible! Hooee! It's like a friggin fairy tale. Get this, in the beginning of time, God creates this dude, Adam. Adam gets lonely, so god takes a few of his ribs and makes an enitre new person out of them, a woman, called Eve. What. The. Fuck? Not to mention, the entire time Adam hangs around with a talking pig!? And then a talking snake tricks Eve into eating some crazy magic apple, in much the same fashion as Snow White, I might add. Oh, and in Revelations, there's all this jazz about giant sea beast and land beast thingies from hell that are supposed to destroy earth when the apocalypse comes.  First off, are they just making crap up!? It's like&nbsp;a fairy-tale!  Second, the only apocalypse that is EVER going to come EVER will be of our own doing. And the only beast I can think of that will destroy this world happens to be from Texas. The number of the beast, you ask? It is not 666, it is W. Or, rather, "dub-ya."  And did you ever read about the rapture? Apparently, the rapture is some crazy thing where God takes all of the pure people up to heaven, then destroys earth or something like that. The pure people include young children (they are born innocent), and devoted church-goers. Certainly God would not spare the Buddhists, whom devoted their lives to selflessness and helping others. You can be a gay-bashing son of a bitch, but still make it into heaven if you praise God. Yes, the don't even care that you make gays everywhere feel like shit and kill themselves every day. Oh, and lets not forget that killing yourself is a sin, and that you go straight to hell for that. What a load of crap.  Ahem, ok, enough religion-bashing for now.  &nbsp; I've been wondering, what would be worse; being born without an arm, or having one ripped off?  Either way, you end up without and arm. So really, it is up to preference.  Scenario one, you are born without an arm, either through some birth control defect, or perinatal complications. Say, for the time being you are right handed, and happened to be born without your left arm. So, this way you can at least go to school. You go to school, and the first day, all the little kids see your lack of an arm, and, being as harsh as children are, taunt you for it. They call you "flipper boy" and laugh and beat you up.  Scenario two, your arm is ripped off in a horrible car accident. Every other part of you is fine, save only your left arm. Again, you are right handed, so you go to school with the other boys and girls. You get, there, they notice your lack of your lack of an arm and your wicked nasty scar. You are both feared and reveared with an aura of mystery. Was it ripped of by a psycho? Did he cut it off? Lose it in an awesome BMXing accident? None of them want to say anything because, since you once had it and knew the joy of it, it is a tragedy. Nobody teases you.  Is loss characterized only by having something and then losing it? It would seem so. Ha!  &nbsp; You know what I don't get? I get less respect than a piece of steel or a tiny insect.  A piece of steel. If I walk into a room and demand the respect and obedience of everybody in that room, there is a very good chance that it will not happen. Walk into a room with a little piece of steel that has a trigger and little lead things inside of it, and they will fear and repect you.  A tiny insect. With the whole west nile "epidemic" floating around, people are more afraid of mosquitoes than they are of getting in a car accident with a drunk driver. Some people see mosquitoes and run. Others do not leave their houses at certains times of day. Others smother their bodies with harsh chemicals to ward of the winged little demons. It is a fraction of my size, and it get's more attention than I do.  What-evar.  I didn't sleep a&nbsp;fucking wink last nite.  Summer sucks shit. It's half over and I haven't done fuck all.  I've been going to the gym for the past 2 months and I have no fucking&nbsp;results.  Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

      I'm one questionable youth, but hey, the only way to get answers is to ask questions, is it not? "Perhaps," he would say.  I'm a real guardian angel now. For real. Real. I thought somebody was supposed to fall out of the sky to meeee! Now it looks like the other way around. She's 23 years older than I am, and a 1000 miles away, so don't even consider THAT. It doesn't matter though. It's kind of like my duty. I feel like a superhero again. Another reason not to shoot myself, which happens to be a good thing.   But the tears still flow like a river. What I don't understand, is why this river hasn't run dry yet! I wanted her forever. I will love her forever. My tears will flow forever. I will be a hero forever. How long will forever last?   As long as I MAKE it last.   The chains I am bound to have transformed into teeth. Now a thousand little teeth rending and tearing my flesh. No. Now I am on a train. The train crashes. All 123 of the passengers are dead, except for one, and that one is me. I am the only survivor. Now I feel an unfelt kind of lonliness. The kind that you only feel in dreams, when you're in front of the board of directors, giving your presentation naked.   It is because I am invincible. It is because I am a superhero. I can never die, that is because there are still people to help. I will never die as long as there are people to help. THAT'S why I'm still here. No matter how bad it gets, I do not have the privelage of death. Never.   Before I was a walking corpse, and that is why I would not die. You cannot kill what is already dead. My heart has started beating again. Blood no longer sits, distended in my arms. I am no longer so pale. And my eyes, which had previously rotted out of their sockets, they are back now. And I can see again. I cannot see the sun, because it is still dark, but I can see the moon. The moon reflects the light of the sun. Not quite the same, a shadow, moreover, a shadow of it's former self, just like me. It's a full moon, and I always liked the moon, just like I like the dark. It will always be dark, though.   So I am still me, only changed. Changed.   I am not here for me, I am here for them. I always have been. ME never once mattered.  I understand now. My love, she did not fall from the sky to me. I was simply there to catch her. If I had not caught her, she would have died. Nobody could have survived that. She wasn't brought to me to make my life better, I was brought to her to make her life better.   I know now, that there will be no salvation for me, only that I can save others.   That is why I want to be a psychologist, don't you see? I wanted to help people. I always did. It makes perfect sense now.   What happens to me does not matter. Only them. If I die, they die. I cannot let them die.   There is no retribution for me. This my purpose. There is no escaping purpose. No denying reason. It is purpose that binds us; purpose that drives us; that guides us.   I am tortured, but it does not matter.   I am alive. I can hear my heart again.  Hello, my name is Matt. I am forever now.

      &nbsp; Three days of blogging, and over 9,000 words so far. Wowee I have no life.  Right now it feels as though there is a chain tied to every inch of me. Each chain is pulling me in a different direction.  What-evar! Ha...  &nbsp; At times I ponder why it is I'm still here. I mean, if I've been so lonely and depressed for so long, why haven't I just shot myself in the freakin head?  It looks like I haven't entirely given up hope. My optimism was stricken of me, but still I retained hope. It would seem that there is a shred of hope that never dies in man, one that keeps us fighting, even on the throes of death. Is it this shred, this tiny bit of hope that has kept me alive all this time?  I suppose there is a shred of hope in me that has not yet died. Yes. At the core, at my very core, in the blackest black, in the deepest depths of me, there resides the hope that one day her and I will be together, and that I will one day live again.  &nbsp;  Fuck! Is anyone else watching "The Fast and The Famous" on MuchMusic? These fucking rap stars each have like a dozen cars, every one of which is worth twice as much as my fucking house!  Wow. That's not the most retarded thing I have ever seen.  These rap "stars" have no talent. They don't sing, they only talk in rhyme about cops and drugs and bitches, or whatever the hell else being a "gangsta" involves. What, because Ludacris can prance around like a moron on stage, demeaning women and putting a bad name on his culture, he gets to make fifty million dollars a year, when my family (family being my mother and I) can barely afford to live? My mother gets to drive around in a used Pontiac Sunfire, and Ludacris gets to drive around, guzzling as much gasoline as beer in his fucking Escalade!? Ludacris gets to live in a fucking mansion, and we get to live in FOREST LAWN!? HE CAN'T EVEN SPELL HIS OWN NAME RIGHT!  LUDICROUS! IT'S LUDICROUS!  Fuck...excuse me while I go eviscerate some innocent bystanders.

      &nbsp; Everyone thinks that they are, at most, half as good as they really are. Quite the contrary, you are actually, at the very&nbsp;most, half as bad as you really are.  But really, how does one define "good" or "bad"  What is bad? Something that is not good.  What is good? Something that is not bad.  Are these types of things defined solely by their polar opposites, or is it, in fact, we who decide which is which.  At some point and time, an individual decided that murder of your fellow man was against the law. Now, all of the people who murdered people very frequently were probably pretty pissed off. But that was the way it was. And murder was deemed "Bad."  At some point and time, and individual decided that marriage was a holy, and that if you were in love, you should get married, lest you live your life in sin. Now the sinners were probably pretty mad, but couples everywhere liked the idea, and such things were deemed "Good."  To Adolf Hitler, "good" or things that were "right" was his genocidal crusade. Is it all in how you look at it? Hitler thought it was a good thing, but most everybody else opposed him. Who is right and who is wrong, well, in our predominately democratic society, we would assume that the majority is, indeed, right, and Hitler was wrong. Done and done.  All in how you look at it. All in how you perceive it.  Take for example, my perception. My perception, my observation, is&nbsp;that there is a woman lying in my bed as I write this. I can see her, I can hear her. Is she really there?  If someone else were to walk in the room at this very instant, they would not see her. Therefore, what I see is, one way or the other, imaginary. Isn't it? Is that how we define what is real and what is not real? What if what everyone else sees is imaginary, and I, one man out of billions, see things for what they real+ly are?  Alright, so, we have to redifine our concept of reality. I think I could safely say that reality, of all things is very much NOT NOT NOT a yes or no concept. Who's to say there are simply two sides to reality: there and not there? Well, not me!  I have come to believe that reality is a ladder. On this ladder is one hundred steps; the one hundred steps of conciousness. When you see an "aparition" or hear something that nobody else hears, you may have taken a step up or down on this ladder (perhaps even sideways!).  Indeed, when I see this woman sitting on my bed, perhaps she IS actually there, only nobody notices her but me.  In a Where's Waldo puzzle, you can never find him simply by taking a quick look. Very close inspection would reveal that he is, indeed, in the picture, but it would not appear so to the untrained eye.  Maybe she really is there, and nobody has taken the time to look.  Or maybe I'm just a frickin nut-job trying to make himself look not so nuts.  &nbsp; Am I a step higher on the ladder than everyone else? Is this why I can know a thing before it happens? Do I see things that nobody sees simply because they are unable?  Twenty minutes before game 7 of the Stanley cup finals, I looked at the newspaper, and I said "The Flames will lose, 2-1." I did not cheer like my friends did. They were sickened by my pessimism. It's not pessismistic if you&nbsp;KNOW it's going to end badly.  &nbsp; I'm a melting convoluted, corpuscular mess.  &nbsp; Can't you hear my soul, calling out, across time and space, to yours?  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Despite my current thoughts on reality, I can't help but feel that everyone else is living in a dream world. They don't know what really goes on. Their heads are buried in the clouds, and they pay no attention to anything else.

       "Fathers and teachers, I ponder 'What is hell?'&nbsp; I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love."   -Dostoevski  Ah, Dostoevski, the mad Russian.  &nbsp; It's been recently brought to my attention, that I'm&nbsp;a miserable fucker. Here I am running around trying to save the world, trying to make people happy, when I myself, am the epitome of sadness.  I cannot help myself. I am thus far incapable. The best I can hope to is help others and pray that my own inner darkness does not blow me apart in a supernova of eclectic horror.  Didja know, a supernova is the single most violent, cataclysmic event in the entire cosmos. A single supernova will give off more energy in an hour than an entire&nbsp;galaxy does in a month. Scaaaary.  &nbsp; So now, here I am, pondering my existence, and left thinking, how am I going to save myself? I suppose I could save the world, I've been at that for a while now, I'm rather proficient at it. But how do I help  me ?  Well, lets think about what made me happy the last time around. The answer to that is simple, it was uncanny amounts of love. Not necessarily from anyone else, it was love from within. It was love that I felt, that I was giving.  So, the answer is: Keep on lovin, keep on keepin on!  I was hoping for something that would involve a little more...Oomph, ya know? Like a quick fix. Like ecstasy or something, except without the addiction or the dying.  You would think that, living alone in the dark all this time, I would be accustomed to the badness. But now I want out...I can't get out though. I'm just supposed to continue on like this. Continue loving. But that keeps me sitting here. Rotting.  MAKE IT STOP!  MAKE IT STOP!  MAKE IT STOP!  Last time, last time I didn't make it stop, it wasn't my doing. An angel just happened to fall right out of the sky and into my arms, and I fell in love, and I FELT BETTER. Just some random occurance, just some luck of the draw, and I get saved. Now, now what am I to do? Just walk back out into the open and hope another beautiful, intelligent, artistic, caring angel will fall into my arms again. I hear lightning never strikes the same place twice. I don't think this will be much different.  This kind of love, this doesn't even happen ONCE to most people. Am I to hope that it will happen again?  Was I wrong all along?  Do I have another chance?  Or is this one simply gone?  Gone. Gone. My chance with her is gone. We will never be together.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; I was in the Sistine Chapel. At my feet lay Michaelangelo's&nbsp;corpse. God reached down from the Creation of Man. In one hand, he held a great sword. In the other, he held the heart of my love. I looked up into his being, and I said nothing. I turned and walked away. I knew I could recieve neither.  I once told her...  My fists have shattered men's dreams, Destroyed families And crushed hopes. But when I open these hands, I can hold my wife, Make my child laugh, And even help those who may need it. The path we take is not right, It is not wrong, It is simply the path that we choose.  At what point does&nbsp;sarcasm become cynicysm? At what point does cynicysm become madness?  &nbsp;  RIGHT FRIGGIN NOW!

      11 Hours of sleep. 11 hours I got last night, and still I can barely open my eyes. Yet, I still manage to write in this thing, grammatically&nbsp;correct, I might add!   I don't really know what it is, but I feel almost kinda sorta maybe a little bit better. Like some weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. I suppose it  is  better not keeping everything inside.   &nbsp;  You know what I found out? I hug is scientifically proven to make you feel better. When your boyfriend or girlfriend hugs you, the resulting emotions (yes, I hear it's that warm, fuzzy feeling inside) trigger the release of endorphins, which are your body's natural painkilllers. Now, this tried and true technique not only works to help emotional pain, but physical as well! Yay....   &nbsp;  When I was born, I was 8 pounds, 7 ounces. The correlation of those two numbers seems to follow me everywhere I go. The first girl to ever break my heart, her email is  urlLink ****87@hotmail.com , and the love of my life, her email is  urlLink ******78@hotmail.com . Creey coincidence, yah?  Oh, oh, speaking of coincidences/proof of my premonition, here's a neat little story:  Ok, so me and two friends are walking down the alley after returning from (what we thought wsas) the improv competition.  Out of the corner of my eye, I spot friend #2's mom driving by in her car, and I say, almost out of nowhere and without thinking (perhaps not even me talking at all), "I wonder why she's going to get Sheri at this hour." Both friends look at me in sheer perplexion.   Then, as we are walking down the alley, we see friend #2's brother, Robbie, and he says to us "Hey, have you guys seen Sheri? She ran away." We put the complex puzzle together to find out that her mom was out searching for her.  Now both friends were quite scared. The look they were giving me said it all. We continued to walk farther down the allay, and I said, "Don't worry, we'll find her in a trash can sooner or later." Sure enough, not 10 seconds afterwards, little Sheri pops up out of a trashcan a few feet away from us.  On a scale of one to ten, the creeped-the-fuck-out factor was around 11.  &nbsp; You know, there's a one hundred and fifty dollar cheque that's been sitting on my desk for the last few days. I'm not even in that big of a hurry to spend the money, let alone cash it. You know, the same applies to my drivers liscence. I don't even have my learner's permit yet. I figure I'll just take the bus to and from university every day anyways.  Am I more apathetic than I think? Oh God, lets hope not.....

      You guessed wrong, sucka! Buahaha. Ahem. Well, whoever you are...If you're even there. Are you there?  &nbsp; "Arielle," I said, "I'm lost," although I knew she was already asleep.  I FUCKING WISH!!!!  &nbsp; Eatin penuts. It's 3 am. I can't stop pacing. I reverted to coloquial speech for a second, back there. What is happening to me!? AAAAH! Well, actually it's party mix. Ha! I wish there was a party...  Do you ever feel out of place? Like you shouldn't be where you are? I feel like I shouldn't be here right now. Getting close to feeling like I shouldn't even be breathing. It's like my life is out of place.  Maybe I should be dead. Maybe I should be touring the French countryside with my band of scallywags, looting the bourgoise.  Just more weird things I cannot explain.  You know, the sun does not seem as bright as it once was. The clouds not as white. The day hath become night. Hey, that was a rhyme! I wish I could do that all the time! *gasp*  Halucinations aside, I've been out of place pretty much my entire life. I was never a skater. I dressed it, but I couldn't skate to save my life. I was never a punk. I dressed it, but would instead listen to heavy metal. I'm sorry, punk just blows. Shallow examples, I know, but they prove my point, don't they? OK OK fine. So me and my friends are hangin out in the drama room during lunch. I don' take drama, but they all do, so they hang out there a lot. Mr. Jack walks in, and basically tells me that I'm not allowed to be in there because I don't take drama! HAAAAAAAA! My friends are always trying to get me to join drama. Apparently I'm a fairly good actor. I act like I'm happy a lot. Fuck drama class, I've got better ways to waste my time. Either way, I just don't fit in. I don't fit in with her friends. I don't fit in with the people around me. I don't fit in to this planet.  A random product of an unequivocal, irevocable chain of events, ultimately amounting to an inbalance in the equation.  The oceans aren't as blue. Blue. My eyes are blue, too. At least, they  were .    &nbsp; I think I am the sum of a random chain of events. Think about it.  In a one in a million chance, I meet the girl of my dreams, the one girl who saves my life. Literally, one in a fucking million.  First, I wanted to go to Western, but they denied my application. So then I had to go to forest lawn. At forest lawn I made a friend after quite an extended period of lonliness. That friend breaks up with his girlfriend. He leaves. I stay. I become friends with that girlfriend, whom I just so happened to have a crush on. She saves my life. She rescues me. What are the odds? Seriously.  Why was I&nbsp;so drawn to her? This, this I know why. She was always so alive. She was always so vivacious, so full of life. Always dancing around, singing, and just plain frolicing in general. She was so happy.  Me, I was a fuckin walking corpse. Depressed, bitter and cynical. Seeing her so happy. So alive.   Seeing her like that showed me that it was okay to live again. I wanted her. I wanted that happiness. I wanted life again.  Hey. She was the Lupita Ramos to my John Creasy. That brings a tear.  Can anyone say "dilemma"? Dill-em-ma.  &nbsp; Here I am saying how unhappy I've been for the last three years, but I left out one small bit. For one moment, one moment I was happy. It was her birthday. Her 16th birthday. I think it might have been on the&nbsp;30th (although she was born on the 29th) of March. I remember...We were all watching movies there in the dark. It must've been 1 am or so. We sat there, next to each other, staring into the TV. I don't quite know, or remember, moreso, how or why we touched hands, but we did. I held her hand. I held it in mine, and it was like nothing I had ever felt before. No feeling was stronger than that. Electricity flowed through me. Not the high-voltage, low-amp crap you get from a taser, it was pure ecstacy. My heart fluttered. My breath drew short. It was the greatest feeling ever.  For that one, single instant, I was the happiest man on earth. It was pure, true happiness. Pure, true love. At that moment, at that instant, I knew she was the one. I knew she would be the one that would make me whole. For that moment,&nbsp;I knew everything was going to be okay.  I would experience all of the pain, I would take a world of pain, I would endure countless hours of torture, just to experience that one more time. For one more moment. Just ONE!  I knew she was the one. I KNOW she IS the one. I feel it. I feel it in my heart, in my mind. In my soul I know. There is not a shred of doubt. I can't even consider anybody else. I can't even consider any other woman. I know it's her. I know it.  If I know it so well, how come it has not come to pass? How come nothing is right? How come everything is so out of place? Why is everything broken? Did my heart lie to me?  Who will I trust then, if I cannot trust my heart?

      Has anyone picked up on the recent trend of names? If you can guess what the next post name will be, you get some freshly baked oatmeal cookies, straight out of grandma's kitchen. I'll probably post again in another hour, but hey, a chance is a chance, right.  I chance is a chance...Can I throw away my chance?   Whatever.   I've been thinking about college. I've been thinking about the future. OK, so college is in a year or so. I'm going to major is psychology, minor in philosophy or somethingorother. The required admission average is 81% percent right now at the U of C. I want to go to the U of C. If I do, I can live here at home and save thousands. The admission average will probably rise and rise. I will need to achieve academic excellence to attain my goal. Right now my average is in the mid-70s. I've got some work to do. If I fail, I won't get into university, I won't get a career. I figure I'll just go on a killing spree if that happens. For now, we'll call that plan b.   I hear a lot of university students change their majors at least one throughout the course of post-secondary. I fear I may suffer the same fate. Do I really know what I want to be right now? Right now? Right now? Right now? Fuck. My future isn't going to go as planned. Not one bit. I know it.  &nbsp;  I wanna meet some people! I wanna expand my horizons! I wanna have a number of friends that extends into the double digit range! I wanna have someone to turn to if I need it!   Haha, funny thing, damn near everyone on hear is chinese or japanese or spanish or whatever. I need somebody that speaks english! ENGLISH! I WANNA MEET SOME WHITE FOLKS! Haha, just kidding about the white thing, but some people that speak the same language as me would be nice.   And what about the fucking lingo in this place.   Hey pplz, so mee an mah homz went 2 da mall 2day, dat wuz whack. neways, mah bf an I r havin sum truble. I dun kno wat 2 do. do i talk 2 him? I jus dun kno wat 2 do.   or   WTF, ROFL, LMAO, LOL. LOL. LOL!!!! Laugh out friggin loud!   There. How can they get their there's confused? The desecration of the english language that occurs on the internet is unruly. I crave some intellectuals to talk with. Ones that can spell. Ones that take time to think about what is coming out of their mouths.   I guess that's the obsessive compulsive in me.   &nbsp;  I'm going off my rocker.  I saw her sitting on my couch today. She's three thousand miles away and I saw her sitting on my couch. I walked up to her. I smelled her hair. I touched her face. She didn't say a word. I turned away and she dissapeared.   That seems to be the way it is with most anything.  At what point does like turn to love? At what point does love become obsession?  Arielle. I think of you all day. You swim in my blood now. I must have you, Love.

       "I am becom death; the destroyer of worlds."   -J. Robert Oppenheimer  Tee hee. I like little tidbits like that.  &nbsp; Sittin here. 1 am. Drinkin some iced tea. Yup.  You know, my fucking diet has gone to shit. I was all for the eating healthy thing. Every time my friends would pick up a chesseburger or a cany bar, I would yell at them. I'm not fat. In fact, I'm a skinny pale white guy. I go to the gym a few times a week.&nbsp;I'd rather keep it that way. I'd rather stay healthy.&nbsp; I'd rather stay alive. What has changed to make me stop eating right? Do I not want to stay alive?  For fuck's sakes, I think I'm actually gaining weight. I have not gained weight in three years, and it is happening now. FUCK FUCK FUCK.  Whatever. I gotta get to the gym SOON. I have to get back to eating right. I have to. Just because I've venerably given up on life doesn't mean I'm going to be an out of shape slob.  &nbsp; Have you ever wanted to scream, but your lungs have collapsed? Have you ever wanted to love, but your heart won't beat? Have you ever wanted to be&nbsp; with someone, but you're on a remote island in the middle of nowhere?  That's what I feel like. It won't go away.  &nbsp; She's all upset about how she's hurting people. Newsflash: love hurts. Life hurts. You may hurt people, but most of them won't hate you. I don't, for one.  Does it even matter who you hurt? Shouldn't who you help, who you save, matter in the end. Perhaps it does.   &nbsp;  I used to help everybody. I was like a personal psychiatrist, except for free. Now I create more problems than I solve.  &nbsp; I've always had somewhat of a sixth sense. Call it latent psychic ability. Call it wisdom. Premonition. Call it bullshit. Call it whatever you want. But sometimes, I just know.  I know it's going to end. I just don't know how.  She fuckin hates me. I fuckin hate me. The world fuckin hates me. Fuck.

      &nbsp;  &nbsp; Robert Frost once speculated whether it would be better do die a death of fire or a death of ice. Freeze to death or burn alive. Both, seemingly equally horrible deaths, indeed. So, what it comes down to is which would you prefer. Not which one is better or worse than the other, but which you would prefer. Which would you choose?  I would choose the death of ice. Slow and unrelenting. A soft sleep. Uncomfortable, yes, but euphoric. The thing about being close to death, is that it is a feeling unmatched. There is nothing like it; not cocaine, not heroin, not morphine can top good old death. I choose ice,&nbsp; as the ice will kill you just the same, it will kill you slower. You will spend a greater amount of time lingering around close to that precious light at the end of the tunnel. Ecstatic.  &nbsp;  You know...Even this place here is full of hurt.  There are two women. One is 40, well, 39 exactly, but it makes no difference. The other is 35. They are both very sad. I tried to help them. How can I help them when I can barely help myself? Haha, perhaps this is what I've been put here to do. I am a Guardian Angel, aren't I?  The first one, she is quite the exceptional poet. As a matter of fact, most everything she says is so poetic, so melodramatic.  The second one, a victim of the "once bitten, twice shy" syndrome. She made a mistake, and now regrets it more than anything.  It would seem dire straights for the both of them.  This world is so full of hurt.  I have to stop it. How?

      April 15. 2002. There was a half moon that night. It was before any of this. It was before this. That day was they day I never saw the light again. That day smothered me as I sat there. That day will never leave my memory. I haven't felt the heat from the sun in a long while.  Now is now.  I would have spent the rest of my life with her.&nbsp;I would have married her. I would have had kids with her. I would have grown old with her. I would have died for her. I would have died next to her. I would have done whatever it takes. I would have gone to any lengths.  I did whatever it took, I tried as hard as I could, I stooped to a level lower than I should have, and still, I failed. To this very day I have not been with the one that I truly love. I haven't experienced it. I have barely experienced love. Do I even know what love is? I figure I do, as every human experiences love. It is universal. To not understand it is to not be human. That does not change the fact that I have not experienced it. I haven't.  Who was the asshole that said "It is better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all"? Hm? Do you know where I stand, I stand horridly in-between. Dancing hopelessly around the equinox of that famous statement. I have loved, yet I have not really experienced it; I'm in love right now, but I am not with her. In a sense I have never loved at all.&nbsp;I have lost, too. I have lost people I have cared about, I have lost heart and hope. I have been deprived. That's damn close to losing, don't you think? Now...Now I feel I am truly losing. I feel I am falling apart, that I've become cold and indifferent. For fuck's sakes, I actually considered packing up my things and leaving all (or, the few that I still have) of my friends. What kind of shit is that?  &nbsp; It feels like April again. It feels like it is happening all over again. That day, when I saw her face the way it was, It changed me forever. I can, I will, never forget those eyes. I do not even understand what they meant to say. But no, it's not April, Simply close to it. The eve of April. Soon the showers will come to wash away the malice. Or drown me one more time.

      You know what I realized I just hate?  People who spew self-righteous political outrage bullshit, then sit on their asses and do nothing.  You know. Kinda like me! AHAHAHA.  There are other out there. You know who you are. Well, actually you don't. Ya stupid prick. But you'll find out sooner or later.  &nbsp; I finally found meself a new dream. Fuck love. Fuck hapiness. I'm going to be a billionaire. But, unlike those other dickheads, I will actualy DO SOMETHING with my money. Yes, of course I would live quite comfortably, but not like others.  For starters, I won't have a fucking twenty three bedroom palace for just myself. I won't have gold plated toilets. I won't pay some guy to drive me everywhere. I won't spend $300k on the latest Versace merchandise. Yes, I would buy lotsa stuff, I mean, who wouldn't. But I wouldn't live in excess, when others just can't live at all.  If I were a billionaire, I certainly wouldn't be able to spend all of that money in a lifetime, so I would donate loads and loads of cash to different organizations across the globe to help make the earth into something it should be. Fuck the Canadian Cancer association. I'd donate to Unicef, Greenpeace, things like that. Millions and millions of dollars to help those who need it. Not those who enjoy the luxury of it. Hell, maybe I'd even start an organization or two of my own. What's a good charity that hasn't been started yet. I know! The anti-crazy-dictator-motherfucker organization. TACDMO...Hmmm...Not quite the ring I had hoped. But it would helped. A big problem with this world is crazy dictators trying to police and bully the world. Well, one Texas-borne individual, in particular.  Or perhaps an organization promoting humility and an end to extreme avarice.  &nbsp; Let's talk about an ideal society. In many minds, and ideal society is one without guns, one without wars and fighting. Such a thing is impossible, as it is human nature. A prohibitively difficult thing to change.  Another ideal situation would be one without such greed. Lacking greed, there would be an end to poverty, the rich and the poor would rejoice. Alas, it is human nature to be greedy. Lay a billion dollars in front of any person and leave the room. Surely enough, the billion dollars will be gone when you return.  Rather than treat the cause, why not treat the symptoms. There is no cure for the common cold, the best thing you can go is take some nasal spray and hope for the best. Take away the money. Money is the problem. Greed is not the problem. It is money. Abolish money. Take away money, and people no longer have to kill each other for it. Take away money, and people no longer have to poison the earth to get it.  In my ideal society, money does not exist. You go to work every day just like normal, except every other week, you do not get a paycheck. When you need a loaf of bread, you walk into the store and get one. When you need to see the doctor, you go in and he gives you some medicine. When the doctor needs a loaf of bread, he just walks into the store and takes one. When the store manager needs a new car, he walks down to the dealership and pics out a car. Now that money does not exist, prestige does not exist, and, thusly, fuel inefficient sports cars do not exist. He picks out a nice fuel efficient honda civic. When the farmer who grew the wheat that feeds everybody needs something, he just goes and gets it. Everyone in society does their job, and everyone gets rewarded for it in that they have everything they need. As long as everyone fills their role, perfect harmony will indeed exist. Lumber mills will no longer have to cut down countless trees just to turn a profit. They take only what they need. Without having to worry so much about ourselves, we would become less selfless, and nations would branch out and help the less fortunate, giving all that they can. Currently, there is more than enough food and resources in the world to sustain everybody. The only thing maintaining world hunger is the greed and excess of western nations. Take away the excessiveness and you have enough to go around. If we stopped hogging all the resources, everybody could have their fair share.  But what can we do to achieve this? It will take a long time. Society does not just convert instantly. It will take time. Time and unification.  &nbsp; Does anybody think I'm bordering a little bit on the dictator side of things?

      Looks as though this thing is a good way to pass the time. It's like a conversation...Except only with myself...Cuz nobody else reads it. SOOO....  Let's add boredom to my list of worries. Oh and full fledged insanity. But not the George W. Bush kind, the Emily Dickinson kind. Sans the suicide. She wrote some of the most beautiful poetry in the history of mankind, she was alone, and crazy as a loon as well. I don't care if she's been dead for hundreds of years! It was a match made in heaven!  On a sidenote, has anybody else gotten sick of all of the pornography/spam type blogs? I, for one, have. This is supposed to be an intereactive online community, not just another cess-pool of human filth. God.  Hahah speaking of filth, I took this quiz that determines which of the presedential cantidates I am most aligned with. WOOO! Kerry all the way! Bush scored a whopping 5% on the test. I'm not American, but I still want that crazy son of a bitch out of office.  Funny Bush vs. Kerry Cartoon:  urlLink http://atomfilms.shockwave.com/contentPlay/shockwave.jsp?id=this_land&preplay=1&amp;ratingBar=off   Har Har Har.  &nbsp; Many people are telling me that I should be a writer. Hehe. I'm just that telented (Ego ego ego!!!). Maybe I should. I even got a fan-mail a couple of weeks ago! That was nice.  I dunno if I could ever be a professional writer. What if I'm not all that great? Well...Stephen King is a terrible author, and look how sucessful he is! That gives me hop. Spelt incorrectly on purpose, for those of you who have read Lyddie.  Did I mention I entered in an online poetry competition? I got a letter a few weeks after, telling me that I was a semifinalist. The poem that I entered wasn't even that great, now that I think of it. Further investigation revealed that the competition was a scam. Way to shatter that dream.  I've been bloody bored as hell. I'm bored as hell. I've considered getting a part-time job to pass the time, but then there are some problems. One, I have to wake up at a decent hour and/or sleep every night. This could be easily overcome, however. Two, like a job at Wal-Mart or KFC would be all that riveting anyways. Three, I'd be making minimum god damned wage, which is fucking bullcrap. I could make more money in a day panhandling. Three, all of my friends are out of town, and I would like a job with at least ONE of my friends. (Ya can't always get whatcha want, though.) Four, I go to the gym two to three times a week. Balancing work and working out could be rather cumbersome. And tiring. A good time to go to the Talisman Centre to work out is around 1-4, before the droves of&nbsp;working class adults&nbsp;get there. Having a work schedule to follow might make things just a tad difficult. Five, this is supposed to be my summer! I'm supposed to relax, chill out, go to fucking Guatemala. Hey, I said SUPPOSED. I've gotten my fair share of chilling out.  So far summer has sucked shit. I think the last exciting thing I did was mow the fucking lawn. I'm so tired my corneas hurt....AAAAGH.  You know what would be nice? A conversational partner other than myself/Alter ego.  Let me tell you about my alter ego. His full name is Chris Vincent Metzen, him and I look exactly alike. We have many things in common, but what makes him interesting is that he has different stances on certain subjects than I do. Chris hates Bush as much as I do, but we tend to disagree on other things. I will not elaborate on those things. One way that Chris happens to differ is that he is a homocidal maniac. Good thing he does not posess any corporeal form! Heh? Heh? Am I right?  However, the thing about spending most of your time alone with yourself, is you get bored very easily. Chris knows me inside and out, and I know him inside out. There really isn't much to talk about anymore.  The name, Chris Vincent Metzen, is actually that of a Writer/Creative designer for Blizzard corporation. I just liked the name. Nice ring to it. SO i decided to give it to my alter ego. He's just that special.  Does anybody know a good way to raise a hundred thousand dollars in a hurry? Just wondering....  &nbsp; You know, I don't even wath much television anymore. Daytime TV blows and has always blown. And even when "normal" TV comes on, it's crap too. Friends, Frasier and Seinfeld re-runs.  I seriously cannot fucking live in a society that worships Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. All the reality TV was bullshit before. These two retards brought it to a whole new level. Words cannot express.  And the Newleyweds!? Hey, Jessica, call me when you can tell the difference between tuna fish and chicken. Jesus. People are making millions of dollars off of&nbsp;that moron.  Society is sick. Just sick.  Big Brother five? FIVE!?  And the simple life! Old porn stars, alcoholics, and televangelists are entertaining the mind-numbed masses.  Survivor, The Bachelor, Bachelorette, Joe Schmoe, The Swan, Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire!?  Our world is proliferated with this shit.  At the very, very least, start making shows with REAL actors (not burnt out ones), with DIRECTORS, and a SCRIPT. I mean, fixing television is not going to save the world. It's not going to solve world hunger, cure aids, or clean the environment. But Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this what our society has come to!?  I swear if that damned Simple Life comes on for a third season, I'm going to kill those two apathetic sluts. How about spendning that $500k on cleaning up oil spills in the Atlantic, rather than buying Prada boots made from the seals that died in it!  Hm...Lack of human-to-human interaction seems to have soured my intropersonal skills. And I'm developing a nast rage problem, to boot.  &nbsp; Adieu, my diary. This life is just you and I.

      &nbsp; When they cannonize me, I shall be Matt: The Patron Saint of Liars. Lookin forward to that one.  Waaah waah. I still can't get over that picture. Here I am bitching about how sad I am. Do starving kids in Rwanda get to express how sad they are feeling on internet diaries?&nbsp;HA!  I read one guy's blog, and it was mostly: "My girlfriend won't have sex with me, wah wah." All I can say is, consider yourself lucky to even have the opportunity at it. My problems are no more important that his, but none of what is important is on anyybody's mind.  When you drive to work in the morning, do you realize how you're contributing the the millions of tonnes of CO2 dumped into the atmosphere every year, melting our icecaps, boiling us alive?  When you're at McDonalds scarfing down your large order of fries, do you realize that some kid in Ethiopia would kill you where you stand to get some of those fries?  No. No. I get more and more disgusted with soiety every day. Even me.  &nbsp; Now, back on the subject of my unfathomable sadness....  It seems she believes that what I said in my previous diary was some sort of passive-agressive attack at her. Rubbing my problems in her face, so to speak. As much as I'd hate to defend myself for what I said and did (it really was quite awful), I just had to say what I said. That was how I felt. I had to get it off my chest or I'd explode. What was said cannot be taken back, I know that, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm still sorry. A word in edgewise: I wasn't trying to hurt her, but I did anyways. Sigh. There we see intent, yet again, amounting to nothing. Action. Action. Action. I know it's my fault, either way. Agh, just let it go, Matty.  &nbsp;  "To believe that things either exist,   or do not exist, is a primitive   form of thought"    &nbsp; I can't quite remember who wrote that. Just an interesting little tid-bit I remembered just now that doesn't really relate to much....Or does it?  &nbsp; Let's talk about some things going on in Matty's life right now. Aside from nothing, nothing, lonliness and boredom, there are a few interesting things.  Well for starters, I'm gonna be getting braces soon. What joy that will bring me, having a face full of cold steel. Yay. You know, I never really thought my teeth were all that bad, but I guess they just kinda...Grew on me! Hahahah...ha...ha....WAAAAAAAH.  Ah yes, my mother and her commonlaw husband of seven years are splitting up. We can't afford the house on our own, so we have to move! Yaaaay. Oh, and then there's all the loss of money involved. What fun.  You know, there seems to be quite the rift between my friends and I. Perhaps it's the hundreds of miles between us all at the moment. Perhaps not. I can't help but feel...That we've only grown apart...And not closer together. And whos fault is that?  &nbsp;  Like any good teenager would, I have generated a list of solution to my largest problem. (Are my priorities out of tune?)  1) Give myself what I had coming, leave everyone and be with0ut friends and without hope.  2) Fall out of love with, and continue to be friends with Her. Find happiness elsewhere, I suppose.  3) Killing spree.  4) Stay and shut my god damned mouth.  Like any good dilemma, it has its fair share of cons.  1) I will be even more alone, and&nbsp;even more sad, but I will have got what I deserved, and everyone else will be much happier with me gone.  2) My love for her is the only thing that keeps me ticking. Sure it hurts, but it sure as hell does the trick (keeping me alive, that is). If I were to go find love elsewhere...I doubt I could find one so strong and so pure....Love like this doesn't happen twice. Hell, to some people,&nbsp;it doesn't even happen once.  3) Perhaps not a  spree , more or less just a few select individuals. I will give no names. Consequences could be&nbsp;jail, if I'm not sneaky enough....  4) Stay here, continue to offer my love and support to my close friends, whilst coming apart at the seams...Hm.  Perhaps everything will sort itself out, no?  &nbsp; What do I dream of now, then? Millionaire, perhaps. Money will make me happy where all else has failed. And I can donate to charities to stop all the bullshit! Everybody's happy!!!!  Peace out and PCP.

      Look at that picture!  Look at it!  Jesus christ! Four and a half billion years of evolution has amounted to this shit. We poison ourselves. We poison this earth. We're fucking discpicable.   Right now, some of us are more concerned about our boy/girlfriends, the nail we just broke, or our turning a profit. This is the world! This is the fucking world!   This is more than horrible. We raped an pillaged this earth for some cash, and now we destroy each other with chemicals and words and wars. For paper. For little green pieces of god damned paper.   Do you remember when Canada tried to conform to the Kyoto protocol?  Do you remember when Ralph Klein said "NO TO KYOTO"!?  He said that it would hurt the oil industry in Alberta and cost thousands of jobs.   Well he's right, it would cost thousands of jobs. But there isn't going to be a place to work your stupid god damned jobs if there isn't an earth to live on, is there!? Dumbass.&nbsp;  The world is not a happy place, filled with love and flowers and candy. The world is terrible. The world is dying.  We are the cause.  Humanity is the problem.  I am, you are.  We all are.  We took this earth and ruined it.  Now we ruin each other.  The world is filled with poison and hurt and death.  Not just emotional, now, is it?  The world, it fucking burns to the ground at our hands.  Sitting here now, I am not part of the solution.  The world is littered with demons,  But nobody cares.  They just blend right in.  Chaos.  Destruction.  End.  Burn the world in two.  Burn to burn.  Burn it to be happy.  Ruin all to be content. &nbsp;Kill them to make a buck.  You're more concerned about your breast size.  You're more concerned about getting laid.  You're more concerned about your job interview.  Guitar riff,  Cocaine sniff,  This world has more problems than Marilyn Manson.  This world has more problems than crime.  Open your eyes.  Open your god damned eyes.  God, however, did not damn this earth. Open your eyes, and look at that fucking child's dead body.

      It's 1 am, and here I am,&nbsp;sitting here in my&nbsp;underwear, and&nbsp;talking to who? NOBODY.  I'm so god damned lonely it hurts. Everyone is floating away from me, and I'm stuck here. Or perhaps it is I who am floating away, and they are still on land. It all looks the same, nonetheless.  You know, I haven't had a girlfriend in more than two years. I haven't even gotten laid!  There is one girl out there who really cares about me, she likes me a lot. We've been friends for a while, but I just don't feel the same way about her. It's making her miserable. The body count rises, dammit.  It hurts, it physically hurts. All over. I haven't slept in days. I barely sleep when I do. When I do, it's nightmare filled and unsettling. Today I watched the sunrise. It hurt like hell.  I can't even afford a god damned shrink! I don't have the god damned money, hell, most of the populous doesn't! I can't fucking be helped. Everything everyone says, every word of comfort, just fails to help. Fails miserably. The thing that keeps me alive, is the thing that keeps me dead. I wouldn't trade it for anything...But that doesn't change the pain.  &nbsp; Yes. Yes, she did hurt me a lot. Yes I mention it a lot. I'm not trying to rub it in&nbsp;her face. I don't hate her for hurting me, I don't want her to feel sad because of me. I just need to get some things off of my chest.  I wouldn't change how things are right now. If I could go back and time and change something, I wouldn't. I wouldn't change it for the world. I know I am supposed to be right fucking here.  &nbsp; The nights are colder, lonlier and longer than ever, and I'm going off my god damned rocker. Jesus, have you read any of my poetry lately? No sane man writes shit like that. Look at Stan Rice! HA!

      &nbsp; Well well. I saw Man on Fire. GOD! I cried more in that movie than I did in A Walk to Remember. This was supposed to be an action flick! BUT GOD! That little girl changed his life...she made him want to live again...He would have died for her...He DID die for her....Sounds familiar.  Yes. She saved my life. She pulled me from the throes of death. I have her to thank for my life. Was it her saving me that made me fall in love with her? Does it matter!?  Apparently, at times I make her feel like I'm better than her. I'm better than HER!? HA! I don't recall me ever saving MY life, now do I?  To whom do I owe my sucess?  To whom do I owe my talent?  My life!? HER!  She doesn't spin lies. She doesn't hate like I do. She's just as smart, if not smarter than I am! Bah. It's the whole self esteem thing.  Nobody is better than anybody else. Perhaps some people are better at some things than others.&nbsp; Lance Armstrong can ride a bike faster than I can, but he isn't better than me. Albert Einstein can build a device of mass destruction better than I can, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's better than I am. Bah.  What is perfection?  Perfection is intangible, it is unreal. And, as you can see, I am a rather big fan of reality. I take what I can see. Real. Much better that way.  Truth. Much better that way. I like to stand for truth, but then I went and told a bunch of lies and hurt a bunch a people. I'm a god damn hypocrit. Which rhymes with Hippie! AND I HATE HIPPIES! Ahem...ANYWAYS....  God, I can't believe it sometimes. I cannot even begin to comprehend the pain I've caused her...Jesus Christ...I tried to do everything in my power to make her happy, and I couldn't even do that, in fact, I ended up doing the exact opposite! FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK SHIT FUCK GOD DAMN FUCK WHORE FUCK BITCH SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT FUCK FUCK FUCK DAMN BASTARD PRICK FUCK FUCK FUCK SHIT DAMN FUCK SHIT DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN FUCK SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT PRICK MOTHERFUCKER FUCK FUCKING FUCK SHIT SHIT BITCH SHIT BASTARD JERK PRICK JERK JERK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT FUCK SHIT FUCK SHIT FUCK FUCK FUCKING FUCK GOD DAMN IT!  Wow, I'm not angry. FUCK! I did what I did, and she gets really sad and upset, and posts this big thing on her blog about how I don't love her, how much o fa jerk I am, etc. And then I get angry at her!? Who the fuck do I think I am? As if I don't deserve to feel like shit.  I had what, like 4 friends, and I fucking threw that away. I don't deserve friends, I've come to realize that.  Should I just pick up my things and run for the hills? Seems that way, doesn't it?

      Wow. I've posted 3 times today (that's this many: I I I). I guess I just have a lot of things on my mind today. Well,&nbsp;actually, I'm mostly in a writing mood.  &nbsp; Did you know that the tides are controlled by the moon? As the moon orbits around the Earth, it's gravitational pull attracts the oceans, drawing them in one direction or another. The ebb and flow of the tides.  &nbsp; Up and down. Ebb and flow. That's the way of nature. That's the way things are.  A talented singer can hold a note for a very long time, probably as long as they'd like (yes, I'm talking about you, KENNY G!), but that wouldn't make for much of a song. A song has a variety of notes, highs and lows, bass and treble, all that neat stuff that makes it sound good. It is diversity of sound&nbsp;that makes good music.  Life just happens to function in the same manner. Life has its lovey highs, it's sad sad lows, but it isn't always that way. The song must change. I was one happy. Now I am sad. Odds are I will become happy sooner or later. Perhaps the low-note will last a little longer than most, though. Hey, maybe it won't. Who knows.  &nbsp; Like the tides, I have receded into the abyss, but I too shall return to the shore. To high up.

      What is a dream?  &nbsp; Perhaps something like intent, or perhaps ambition.  Hitlers ambition, his intent, was to create a pure, holy, and industrious nation. Coincidentally that meant one without Jews. His intentions were (venerably) good, but it was his actions, NOT his intent that defined him. He slaughtered countless innocent millions. You kill people, you are a murderer. Simple as that.  You do something out of good will, but end up fucking somebody over, then you are a jackass, simple as that.  Intent is nothing. You cannot feel intent, you cannot touch it, smell it, or hear it. Actions are really the only thing of importance. You could love somebody with all of your heart, but if you do not show that love, you are, essentially, not in love with them. You can say "I love you" I love you" "I love you" all you want, but, it means nothing unless you show it. Whether that is being there for them, supporting them, never leaving them to be alone, or just simply not hurting them.  So then what is a dream? A dream is something that you aspire for, or so I've been told. But, in much the same fashion as intent, dreams are intangible. However, unlike intent, dreams can actually do something. Your dreams, your ambitions, your aspirations push you to achieve, to do the things you must do, to get you to the place you must go.  Alas, here I am, cold, stupid, and naked, and a far cry from my dreams, and from reality, for that matter. Or so I would think. Is there something I did wrong? Is there something I failed to do in execution? Or was it, perhaps, that my dream was simply unnatainable. The wrong dream, so to speak. What was that dream? I wonder now. What was it that I drove so unequivocally towards. That dream, my friend, was happiness. Happiness, however, is different to every person. Happiness to Ghandi was world peace. (Back the the Hitler analogy) Happiness to Hitler was blonde hair and blue eyes for all. To me, happiness was something special. Happiness was being with the one that completed who you were, who loved you as you loved them. Happiness was undying love. Happiness was falling asleep without a tear, and wanting to wake up the next morning. Happiness was some day marrying that loved one, and then bringing a precious life into this world. Yes, I know I'm only sixteen, but that doesn't mean I can't want to have kids later on in my life! Happiness was love.  But was that too much to ask? I suppose it was. It must've been, as, herein, happiness is for the most part, unnatained and unfelt. You know, I've had this dream for quite some time. I think I could safely say three years. Perhaps closer to two? I don't know, my memory isn't all that great. Anyways, for the better part of that time period, I've been quite unhappy, and for more reasons than just failing to achieve my dream, failing to find love. I could speculate that it was perhaps circumstance that foiled the attainment of my dream. I was unhappy, and therefore wanted to be happy, perhaps this dream was borne unto the wrong circumstances, selfish ones, so to speak, and therefore could not come to pass. Doubtful, but an explanation is an explanation.  No, that's not right. A better answer would probably be that it was MY fault. I'd put money on it that I fucked myself over. Somehow, some way, I know it is my fault.  I used to blame God, or whatever higher power I could think of at the time for my problems. Everyone goes through the whole "Why, God, why!?" phase at one point or another. Now that the existence of such a omniscient being eludes me, the blame has come "down to earth." Pun intended. Whosever fault it may be, I at least have it narrowed down to who it is NOT. It is NOT her fault. I know that. It is not her fault. It can't be. Hey, if I had to blame someone, it would be simply bad luck. If such a thing does indeed exist, then it is the fault of Lady Luck. The wrong place at the wrong time.  Back on the subject of intangebility.  When someone is trying to find themselves, or find reason, or guidance, or whatever it is that they are looking for, they often tend to look inside of themselves, into their thoughts and motivations. That, in my humble opinion, is where they go wrong. If one wishes to find themself, they need only to look straight ahead, at their hands, in the mirror, wherever. Just not inside. Because inside does not exist. Look at the things you have done, they will tell you what you need to know. If you fly around and save people's lives,&nbsp;then yes, you are, in fact, a superhero. No doubt about it. If you do just the opposite, then there is a more than likelt chance that you are a supervillian.  &nbsp; When it comes to me, however, things get a little tricky. Although I suppose it does with most people. What if you both save lives and ruin them? What are you then? Neutral? I think humans are very Black and White beings, and therefore neautrality does not exist. Perhaps grey, but not neutral.Yin and Yang, baby.  Well, me, I choose black. I've fucked up a hell of lot more things than I have saved, done more harm than good, and caused more tears than any one person deserves. I'm one evil fucker. MUAHAHAHHA....Egads.

      &nbsp; Hello, my name's Matt. You can call me matty...or mark or jerkface...or whatever you prefer. Or perhaps Snake...yes...I rather like that one.  I suppose I'm going to give another go at this diary thing...Last time it ended rather badly. I hope I don't piss anyone off this time...THIS TIME. Hell if I know why I'm writing this. I guess I just am. All most of life really is is somebody's best guess. Take chemistry for example; scientists assume that electrons orbit around the nucleus in seperate valences in a constant, ultra high speed motion. They can't see them, but still they figure that's the way it is. Somebody's best guess until proven wrong by the next big scientific discovery.  Last time....last time I was a stupid prick. Everyone else tells me they forgive me, and they probably do, but I sure as hell don't.  &nbsp; Everything is all crazy. I fucked everything up. I suppose every one of us in that fram of mind right now, though. I said things I never should of said...Some were lies...others, well those words have to come from SOMEWHERE. I suppose I was just vindictive at the time. That or I'm a cold heartless maniac. You know, I was never really one for the&nbsp;self loathing,&nbsp;but now, after all the shit I've done...I can't really not hate myself. I was never really one for hate either. For the longest time, I've been telling everyone: "don't hate" or "anger is bad" blah blah blah. And now I look in the mirror and I see I have become everything I feared. agh.  Did I really see myself here, where I am, two years ago. Well, actually, yes. Less of a knowing, more of a drastic generalization come back to bite me in the ass. Be careful what ya wish for, eh?  &nbsp; I've been pondering lately about the existence of God/Vishnu/Buddha/fate or any other sort of higher power or guiding force. An experiment I read about a few months ago happened to pique my interest.  OK, so these two scientists, Prof. Miller and Prof. Urrey, wanted to find out how life originated, so they did what any other scientist in their position would have done; they did an experiment.  It is a common belief among scientists that life began with a single cell, and continued on from there. Miller and Urey wanted to find out how this single cell just happened to appear a few billion years back.  In the famous Miller-Urey experiment, they took a large glass jar, and fitted it with the components that they believe contrived the environment of our (at the time) young earth; The atmosphere consisted mainly of Methane and Ammonia, the earth was covered mostly by ocean, and the surface was constantly ravaged by fierce electrical storms and intense heat. So, they filled the jar with methane and ammonia, water, and zapped it with electricity every one in a while, churned it, and kept it nice and hot. After only a few days of this process, the water turned a murky brown. Further tests revealed that the contents of the water were indeed primitive amino acids and carbohydrates, etc. Which makes perfect sense, as Ammonia, Methane and water contain all of the components necessary (which would be Nitrogen, Oxygen, Hydrogen, and&nbsp;Carbon)&nbsp;to build proteins, and, consequently, life itself. The heat and lightning facilitated the chemical reactions to bind the chemicals.&nbsp; Miller and Urey deducted that after a period of time (which could have been millions of years, for all they know), in somewhat of a random fashion, these building blocks of life were brought together, and the first cell was born, able to flourish in the predator-less environment, sustained by the vast quantities of sustinance floating around in the oceans (the apt word, Primordial Soup, comes to mind).  So...There was no Garden of Eden, so God is a corporate scam? Dunno. But when I told that experiment to my uber-christian friend, he got kinda pissed off. Design an experiment to prove God DOES exist, then come talk to me budddy. Until then, these two guys got you beat.  &nbsp;  By the by, whoever you are, please take a look at my site:  urlLink http://lsdnsideburns.tripod.com . Read the poems and whatnot, I could really REALLY use some constructive feedback.  Ciao for now.  &nbsp;

      Doesn't it seem like the world is spinning around faster and faster? So much has transpired in so little time. I don't really know what to make of a lot of it, some of my options have been restricted by a promise.   Innocent? There's still blood on your hands.   Me? A good person? That's laughable.

      Ok, so it seems that my blog lied to me, and that last post was my 101st, so the turnover party was in vain. Joyous joy.  So happy 102nd post...Fuckass.   So I'm reading the diary of a certain green-party member, and it occured to me that my opinion of the green party was incredibly skewed. This man was an intellectual, down to earth guy. Hell, he would be one of the few politicians that have actually graduated from high school, let alone college! Usually when somebody brings up the green party, I think about a bunch of hippies parading around, yelling "Save the whales," "Legalize the pot, man!" Well, there's a stereotype for ya. This party could do a good job or running our "fine" country, promoting stable economical and social growth, rather than the "bang for the buck" type of system current politicians have going. They're more than a bunch of power-hungry, money-ravaging dickheads, and that is what sets them apart from most of the other parties. They don't want what's best for them, they want what's best for CANADA. I for one, vote green. Hell, anything's better than Liberal or Conservative...*Shivers*  And not to mention he's drop dead GORGEOUS.  Heres to not keeping secrets! *Drinks sparkling apple juice, pretending it's champagne*

      All this bloody time, all this terpitude, and here I am, still in love.  I always wanted a nice house, expensive television, moderately nice, fuel efficient car; all the fruits of a sucessful life. But I also need someone to enjoy it with. Someone that I can cook fancy dinners that I saw on Food Network for every night. Someone to stay up late watching indie movies with on weekends, rather than going out and getting wasted. Someone that can yell at me for leaving the toilet-seat up. When I was a child, I wanted to be a cop. As a teenager, I wanted to be a star. Now, I want a life. But all this time, I have always wanted someone in my life. Even as kids we have crushes on the little girl with the bow in her hair. Companionship is part of who we are. Why spend a life alone? A life is wasted if it is alone. Only together can we mean anything; I just realized that now, you know. Funny, though, I think I already knew it. I've always gone around saying (mostly to myself, mind you,) that a human being left to its own designs is a horrible and dangerous thing.  What lies ahead? What lies beneath? The same and the same. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tommorow...And what-have-you. I don't like what I see in my future. Whether it is truly there or not (even though there's a 99.99% that it IS), does not matter, as that is what I see. The image disturbs me.  Wherever you go, the past, present and future is always with you. You can do your best to ignore the past, but the human brain does not have the capacity to truly forget, the present is now, and the future is now, and now, and now, and it is forever where you are going. You can escape none of them; the terrible three you must accept.  Odd, the present is rather cumbersome. Er, maladjusted, er, whatever word you can find for it. Too many things are starting to make sense, too many things have been made clear to me, and too many things have been shown to these eyes. These things I do not need to see. I see them anyways. Odd, I could always have closed my eyes...Couldn't I?  My enemie's enemy is my friend. Is my friend's friend my enemy? What logic is that?  Demented logic for dummies.  Still in love, and listening to the song, too.  You know, the first time she ever enjoyed a Metallica song was my doing. I sent "Nothing Else Matters" to her to listen to, for reasons unknown at the time, and even now. Hm...  99th post...11th hour...New years eve...last day on Earth...   Exonerating...er...exterminating the human race one at a time, circa 1942.

      Im rotting here. I almost want to go back to school so that I won't be bored out of my mind.  What did I do this summer?  I went to the gym.  I saw some movies.  I hanged out with some friends for a while.  I started living below the poverty line.  I didn't go on vacation.  I sat here for literally hundreds of hours.  I slept for days on end.  I stayed awake for days on end.  I watched softcore porn on showcase.  What a great summer its been.  What a great school year this will be.  I'm not going to be in the yearbook this year.  I don't think I'm going to have enough money to get a tux.  I don't think I'm going to have enough money to pay for electricity.  On a rollercoater ride, all the while rotting here in suburbia.  Except it's Forest Lawn instead.

      Do you ever take a look around at the world, and think: "Holy hell, is THAT what all this is."  Well I do. It's the world, and I can't wrap my fingers around it anymore. Ha, like I ever could.  It's 11:11 again, and it's not a coincidence. I started it at this time on purpose, like a lot of things.  *makes a wish*  1128464234235820913th time's a charm.   Sinking lower and lower, in the visage of my own mediocrity. It's my fault that I'm here, isn't it? I dug the hole, did I not? No, I'm beginning to think otherwise. Beginning, no less. Always.  I don't really even know what to say anymore...  He breathes words of truth. Or, at least, that is how I see them. And does it really matter if I'm blind otherwise? After all, here I am, safe in my own little conniving existence, apart.  What lies ahead? Ever after.

      Me and some friends went out for yet another midnight adventure. We took the number 1 downtown, so we could take the train to sunridge, but the anderson train came first, so my bright idea was that we get on that and go to chinook instead.  So we sawed AVP...which wasn't THAT spectacular. Not nearly gory enough, not nearly scary enough, and not nearly enough humans getting ripped to shreds. And when the humans did get ripped to shreds, they didn't even show it. Paul Anderson should have opted for an R rating instead of PG-13 so there could be some serious gore. But hey, worth the 10 bucks. At the end, I couldn't help but feel there was going to be a makeout scene, that is, until she looked at its face...  So, the movie's over, and it's like midnight, so we take the anderson train back downtown. By then it's like 12:30, and no more busses are running. Me one friend lives in inglewood, and the other in erin woods. So we walks her home to inglewood. That was a nice long walk, but we all survived. It was worth it all in the end, because we got to see her mom in her pyjamas! So then we walked back to my house...That was a long fucking walk. Then we get home and the adventure was over. Oh well.  Then, this morning...er...afternoon, when we woke up, we had to hook up the "new" tv in the living room, because fuckface took the other one when he left. That took a really long time. Further investigation would reveal that one of the RF cables was busted...joy. So we have television now! Yay...Yay for the degredation of our society.  You know, everybody's saying that our generation will be the one that changes the face of the earth, but I doubt that. Society is on a slow and steady slope downwards. We are just as biased and inolerant as ever...And not to mention destructive. I predict an apocalypse or two around...2035...

      Methinks I should get a tatoo.  Celtic cross with the latin word "Peccavi" above it, which means "I have sinned."  Yah? Yah? I was thinking shoulder, or shoulder-blade perhaps.  Pretty schweet. And we all know how chicks dig tatoos...HAAAAAAAAAAA!....I'm so shallow.

      She stands in the window, looking out at nothing, into nowhere, running nowhere with her deep brown eyes. She always wanted to run off into nowhere. She had not known that he wanted to do the same.  At night, she awakes to his screams for help. He, however, did not scream for help. Had she seen him do it? Or was it a coincidental dream. She often wondered if she was in that place between asleep and awake, that place where she could still remember dreaming, and yet wonder if she is still alive. That is where he said he would always love her. Right there.  Wax dripped down onto her wrist from the monatery white candle sitting in her hand. The burning meant nothing. She had burnt him with wax plenty of times, and it really didn't seem to phase him. Why should it do the same to her?  A scream out on the moor. No, not there, nowhere. No, inside. No, behind you, screaming, and there he stood, in the blink of an eye, wailing, not screaming, and in just that instant, dissapeared like a grain of sand.  He had always told her that dreams were often easier to remember than reality. This was also the case with lies, which were harder to believe than truth. That is how he would tell the difference. She had remembered that image so vividly. Could he have been right? He was always right about a lot of things.  She had left her bedroom window open. The twilight-driven winds whipped at her hair. Hundreds of nights they had lyed awake, being caressed by this very same wind. Perhaps it knew the truth. "Why not ask the winds," he would say, as if to rhetort "who knows?"  You do not truly know what you have until you have lost it. Another scream. Always screaming. She, herself, would soon befal the same madness at this horrible shreaking. But alas, it was not a scream, simply the tides crashing against the rocks, whispering tales of the sea told eons ago. Did anybody really understand what the Earth was saying? He had left her with only questions unanswered.  And there he was again. Opening the door to the porch, its rusty hinges creaking, as the winds goaded him along. There he was again, strolling, undaunted towards the surf. There the ocean was, a sweltering pearlescent madness of its own, still ripe with the haunting sunset. She had watched that sunset with him, and it would last forever. There he was, and he walked out into it. Not to swim, not to float, not to sink, not to die. To walk. And he walked, out into the abyss. Had she watched him in horror? Or had she slept the night away at his conspicuousness?  Naught but his body had washed ashore. He had left her with bits of clothing, jewellery, and unanswered questions. All but his body. He had flat out left her. He left a tear in the ocean once, and when they found it, he would stop loving her. In that salty brine, she alone had discovered that tear. For the dying sea. Would she follow him?

      Is it safe to look within, And erase all that's been, And all that's been between? Is it gone? tell me what went wrong, 'Cause baby i'm not that strong,  And i'm walking wounded All alone, all alone.  Are you comfortable and numb? Did they all succumb to all those lies? Does it satisfy the greed? Is it all you need? Is it all you want? 'Cause baby i'm not that strong.  And I'm walking wounded, All alone. And baby i'm not that strong, And i'm walking wounded, All alone , all alone.  How does it feel? How does it feel?  How does it feel? How does it feel?  If your memories do stray Then they betray all that's past, And all that's been between. Is it gone? tell me what went wrong, 'Cause baby i'm not that strong.  And i'm walking wounded, All alone, And baby i'm not that strong, And i'm walking wounded All alone , alll alone,  How does it feel? How does it feel?  How does it feel? How does it feel?  How does it feel? How does it feel?  How does it feel? How does it feel, baby now?  God, I sure do loves my Tea Party.   You know what, I think I should just rot in hell for my desires as such. Waaah, waaah, I don't have a girlfriend, waah waah, I'm all alone. Who gives a shit? Lets deal with some REAL problems, not my apathetic teenage life. Worldly inhibitions be damned. Spend my life trying to help, I shall. How, is yet unknown. There are more people that need more help than I do, and help they will get. How is still unkown. Such suffering. To save the human race, we must all change. To save the human race, we must do more than send 31 cents a day to World Vision. To save the human race, we must do so much. And at the same time, I can't help but wonder if humanity is just some fell curse upon this planet.  Save or exterminate the human race, I'll put that at the top of my to-do list.  Until then, well, Matt Johnstone, as Mr. Hat would say so eloquently: "YOU GO TO HELL, YOU GO TO HELL AND YOU DIE!"  A HA HA HA.  Do you realize when all this shit began? Why, I can see quite clearly when. Quite clearly.

      You know what they say about depression. It makes good art! And I have proof!  Perfection is ludicrous. Michelangelo once created a stautue; it was immaculately perfect. An uncanny replica of a human. He destroyed it after he realized what he had done. Artistic perfection is an oxymoron.   Rage seethes through me. My heart pounds furiously at me, scowling. Blood boiling, I reach for the knife. Put it away. I want to scream. I can't wake everybody up. They're all so peaceful in their sleep. Perhaps they are the ones that are awake, And it is I in the nightmare. No, this is truth. It reeks of truth. Torpid stench. I scream. No answer. Rage eats me up inside. It feeds. It grows. It turns into hate. I kill every single one of them. I want to scream. Anger. I plunge it inside And I'm awake. No, no, no, I say Over And Over. Beaten path, it beats me.

      Ugh...my sleep cycles are completely and utterly backwards now...Stay up till daylight...sleep a whole bunch...do nothing....stay up till daylight...AAAAAAAHHH!   Are you familiar with a little country called Somalia? Sure you are. Last nite, over 10,000 Somalians died. Did you join greenpeace? Did you sign up for the Red Cross to go provide crisis support? No. 7,000 AMERICANS die in 9/11, and we scour the world in an unending crusade to eliminate terrorism. The amount of innocent people alone that have been killed is in the 10,000's range. Oh, and lets not forget the terrorists. But their casualties don't count. 7,000 Americans die, and the world falls to it's knees. Because we are born with all the power, our deaths are somehow more important? Fuck.   If I asked you to die for me, would you? I doubt it. If you asked me to, would I? I doubt it.   I'm the cynic. I'm angry all of the time because the world did not bow down to my influence. What I do not realize, however, is that I will have to do more than ask the world very rudely before it will do anything for me. Nevertheless, I refuse to see it as my fault, and direct all of the anger towards some unseen force in the universe that is magically acting against me.

      No trees were harmed in the making of this diary, Although a large number of electrons were Terribly Inconvenienced.   My uncle's girlfriend, Angela, has this lip gloss, and on it, it says POISON, but it's crossed out, and in its place is written: "Lip gloss for my friends."  GAAHAHAHAHAHA. That's what I needs. A gal with a sense o' humor. And one who's my age.

      Man, there are bigger problems in the world than me. Hell, most sign posts in this world are bigger than me. We've got more things wrong with the world than matty not being able to find a girl. But yarrr, there be plenty 'o other fish in the big blue sea. Yeah, you know you like the sexy pirate man. Fuck that, take me to Davey Jones' locker. Maybe there are some nice, red headed mermaids there.  I just realized that I like bands headed by women. Especially rock bands. Arch Enemy, Kittie, No Doubt, BIF Naked, Garbage. WOOF WOOF! Baahahaha. Wow, I'm more of a typical male than I had once thought. They tell me that's a bad thing. Shit.  I will stand up now.  There are worse things wrong with this world. Why should I be any more important. Christ, I'm just gonna sign my vow of abstinence, then join the fucking green party.  You know, losing one's virginity is defined by having a male penis enter the body. So really, only straight women and gay guys can lose their virginity. Hopefully I might fit into one of those categories one day. Oh, matt, you crack me up sometimes.  We will rise.  Yay for passive resistance.  Sun, where are you? I can't quite see through all of the heavy metal.  Vote democrat or don't vote at all. I for one chose option b) Heheheheh.

      Every night, the big man stays up to watch the sunrise, and yet he still has no taste for it. Bitter. He still prefers the sunset. It is still the only thing he lives for.  Something about nightime just gets me going. Maybe I'm borderline werewolf or something. Yes, that's a perfectly logical explanation. AWOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Something about the blade just calms me down. Sometimes more than others. No, I'm not a slasher, at least not enough to qualify as one. But then again, they may have changed the rules, so I might actually qualify. I'd say about 2 every year. But the blade, holding it, it calms me.  Something about blood gets me off. When I see a vampire feed on a woman on the big screen, I stop breathing. When I get a nosebleed, I let it bleed until I get dizzy. Forbidden fruit, I suppose. Praise jesus. Maybe I'm a half-vampire, half-werewolf, protestant, japanese coneptual artist, televangelist superhero. There, that is a slightly more logical explanation. Gotta admire that Daphne (from Scooby Doo); always a logical explanation for everything. Don't believe it 'till you see it.   I often wonder what couplehood is like. I hope it's not like all those movies where the repair man with a nine-inch cock comes in and pounds the lonely housewife. I've never really been in a real relationship. The first girlfriend I had was in grade 3 I believe. I aslo think that's the first time an entire class of students ever made fun of me (it also would not be the last). The second one was in grade four, but she was using me to make her grade 6 boyfriend jealous. The next one was in grade 7, and she was a total whore. The next one was in grade 9, and after many months of "dating," the relationship had gone abso-friggin-lutely nowhere. Then, again in grade 9, I dated a girl that I was "in love" with for a grand total of three fucking days. Grade 9 was also another one of those times when the entire class, and -as a matter of fact- pretty much the entire school made fun of me. It's been cold hard lonliness ever since.  I often wonder what being in a relationship is like. Do I tell her I love her a million times a day? Or will she get creeped out and leave town? What if I'M to tired to do it? What if she doesn't love me back? So many unanswered, unfeasable situations. I've never ever really been with anyone. And right now, I realize that it really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really sucks. Really. Can you be alone if you never really had anyone to begin with? Can you miss something if you never had it before? Longing.  I want someone to fall asleep with me at night. That's it. That's all I ever wanted. Just someone to BE THERE. Nobody's there yet. I'm sure they're lined up out the door. If I was starving, and somebody offered me a bowl of cow testicles to quench my hunger, would I take them? No, because I'm a stuck up North American bastard, and am too ungrateful. Bring me steak and lobster, and then we'll talk. Oh, and a glass of apple juice. Wouldn't we all be grand? Everybody wants the fucking best. Everybody wants the most expensive thing on the menu. Romantic, smart, artistic, sexy, get your god damned heads out of the clouds. Look around. Do you think you're going to find perfection? Perfection does not exist. 'Cept in Nevada, but it's just an ugly trailer park and a general store. I for one, choose, no rather, am forced to settle for less. Less also happens to be the same as nothing.  Although I've got my eye on Lieutenant Ripley (aslo known as Sigourney Weaver). Something about a strong female character kicking ass sounds tempting. I fucking wish.  11:11. Isn't some sort of wishing supposed to be happening at that time? So far, I've got a grand total of ZERO wishes that have come true. Oh well, if at first you don't succeed, try and try again.  Why do we dream? I've decided dreams are useless. And I am no longer going to dream. Thus, I will master the fine art of sleeping with my eyes open. Man, I'm going to need eye-drops.     "Why can't I just be on the first flight out instead of here?"     Pity. I admired your optimism.     I'm going to be a god damned bachelor with mostly fucking milk crates for furniture. Well, at least I HOPE not. If I ever get into that scenerio, I beseach all of you, please, shoot me in the head. Quick and painless.  HOPE. There's that word. HOPE. I remember back in the day, I used to think hope was pointless. I used to think that hope and expectations could only lead to dissapointment. After all, you can't fall down if you don't get up. Maybe I'll grow accustomed to the dirt. Or maybe hell will freeze over. It appears history is trying to repeat itself. Perhaps I should've gotten better than an 85 in social studies. Then I'll show that history who's boss.  At the party today...Well, actually I guess it would technically be yesterday, my cousin tells everybody about how small her boyfriend's penis is. She doesn't know what to do. She can't fake it in bed a hell of a lot longer. Wonderfull news to hear, I'm sure, especially for her 16 year old cousin. But anyways, she figures she'll just break up with him. Wow. Wow. Wow. Is this what dating is going to be like? FUCK. Don't live up to expectations and you're out the door. I can't fucking wait for it. No, I think I'll just find a girl now, one that can see past the human body, and marry her real quick. Get a few kids, and off we go! I'm trying my damndest, but it's just not working. I'd sooner have a really long relationship, than lots of little ones. At least with choice a) the pain all comes at once. I'd gain less weight from eating buckets of ice cream that way. But then again, there's also fat free ice cream, but it's nasty, so fuck that. High-School romance? What? Romance? Romance is romance. Love is love. No matter how old you are, a love in high school is just as important as the next.  Why am I looking for love now? Won't it ruin all the fun I could be having in my teenage years? First of all, WHAT FUN!? Second of all, it is because I'm the closest thing to pathetic, and rather than go for the million, I'd pick Don Meredith, and go for the sure thing. He could make that throw better than I could. He was a quarterback, after all.  Wake the hell up.  Open your lies and deceit, and see the truth, in all its round, red glory.  The skies aren't as pretty. The grass isn't as green.  But you have to see the truth.  Humanity hates the truth, but this is the choice I have made.  Head is far away from the clouds.

      Bad taste in music.   Who's to say which will last longer? Your next love could be forever. It could be with you, it could occupy your last dying breath. Your next friendship could end the next time he does something monumentally stupid. Which bond is closer? Is it the one that breaks first, or is it the one that hurts the most when it comes apart?   Worse taste in music.

      I have screamed until my veins collapsed, I waited as my time’s elapsed. Now all I do is live with so much fate. I've wished for this, I've bitched at that, I've left behind this little fact: You cannot kill what you did not create. I've gotta say what I've gotta say, And then I swear I'll go away, But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise. I guess I’ll save the best for last, My future seems like one big past, You’re left with me 'cause you left me no choice.

      Yay for friday the 13th.  My cousin's birthday was yesterday, but she had the party today. What a day. 22 years old. Everybody was hella-freakin drunk except me and my uncles girlfriend. I like her, smart gal she is. Works at the teen crisis centre, I believe.  Anyhoo, so here I am, sitting there sober, and everybody is trying to get me wasted. THANKS MOM!  Then my aunt pushed my cousin into the kiddie pool, and she dragged her in with her...Lotsa things I seen that I wish I did not see....*shivers*  But yeah, drunk people are a lot of fun to watch. But never do as they do...No.   There's that reverse serendipity again. I could have went and seen a great movie with my friends, but instead I went and watched a bunch of adults get drunk.  I live a charmed life, I do.  Not to worry, I'll get to see it on sunday with my uncle...hopefully.   I still don't really even know why I'm so freakin pissed off. I guess I'm just looking for reasons. Fuck matt, you're such a dick sometimes.

      The river does not know why it flows; it just does. It wakes up in the morning, and it rushes through the valley. It falls asleep at night to its own soothing sound. The river still does not know why it flows.  My tears do not know why they do the same. They wake up in the morning, dried across my face. They do not know why they are there. They fall asleep at night, in a marathon to the bottom; to the river below, although neither know why.  I don't think I know, either.

      Serendipity is awesome.  Reverse-serendipity is quite awe-inspiring as well, but not in the same respect.  Thanks to reverse serendipity, we no longer have to steal her a car! BaHAHAHAH! Yes, and I did intentionally use REVERSE. Or perhaps adverse would be more fitting....  I don't know why, but it fuckin does.   What is life's quest, life's meaning? Matty says procreation. Every being on this earth exists solely for procreation. To facilitate what? MORE PROCREATION. Bugs breed so they can feed the frogs. Frogs breed so they can feed the snakes. Snakes breed so they can feed the eagles. Eagles breed to keep the population in check, allowing for more...you guessed it...PROCREATION. We exist solely to spread our seed.  So yes, to all you nay-sayers out there, life IS all about boys and girls and falling in love, and something or other involving birds and bees. BaHAHA!  The cause was lost somewhere in translation, and now we just exist in effect, searching, and endlessly searching.  I'm not pessimistic, I KNOW what's going to happen. And that is SO not the same thing. Totally.  Well, I better go find myself a suitable mate, preferrably one that will devour my head and lay her eggs inside of my carcass. Ah, love at first sight.   You know, me fellow buddies in AA have a little prayer, and it goes somethin like a this:   "God, grant me the serenity,   To accept the things I cannot change;   The courage to change the things I can,   And the wisdom to know the difference."   Now, the thing about serenity is it is not exactly existing in an environment totally without chaos, as that is impossible. Entropy exists no matter where, when, or who you are. Chaos is the human stain. Serenity is being able to cope and to exist within this chaos, without having it destroy you.   I don't know what all these fans of mine are raving about. I'm hardly in tact.  I don't really have a choice otherwise.  We will rise.

      There are things that make us angry, and there are things that make us angry for no good reason. Take spilling milk for example. You probably don't fully understand why you get upset when you make a mess, but you do. You get angry. You know you probably shouldn't, because it's only milk, but you are. I know I shouldn't. I know.  It beguiles me. It discombobulates me. A beautiful deluge of every piece of the spectrum. Torrents of delirium and hyperbole mar my conscience. I cannot, for the life of me, Comprehend this delusion of mediocrity. Like a sinking feeling from within, Although, I know I am not sinking.  Their motives, I will never quite fully understand their motives. There IS some reason, something that I, for one reason or another, have missed, or was forced to miss. There is something that I am just not getting here. Not until hell freezes over, yes? It puzzles me. It fucks me. It fucks me over.  I...I can't quite even put it into words.   Why take him and not her?   "Boys will come and go, but she will always be there."   Is it our time to go, already? Pity.  Why? Why not?   Love is love. I'm almost at that point again. That point, where love becomes evil to you, and you never want to be close, ever.

      In the beginning of time, Heaven and Hell were deadlocked in a cataclysmic battle of good vs evil. After millenia of brutal combat, humanity appeared on earth. Both sides dropped their weapons and halted, in awe of the free-willed beings. Each side sat in wait to see which opponent humanity would turn to. Eventually, they stopped waiting, and brought the battle to earth. The fight now was over control of humanity. They, alone, would turn the tides of the age-old war.  Are we really just pawns in the game of otherworldly beings?  BA! I've just being plaing to much Diablo. Seriously. At times I see a Devilkin scamper down the hallway. It feels weird, my eyes don't feel like they're there anymore. The world has an intangible, movable quality now.  Break? You say? No. Not a chance.

      You were at point A.  You moved a step closer to point B.  You are now one step farther away from point A.  Distance      from      point       A = A-X    .    X       is         you.  To remove point B would cause you to always move inexplicably towards A.  Because, you'd see that the world is no longer flat, and every direction is south again.  Distance will again become an illusion. As will the prospect of choice. Farther. Closer. Away.

      Counter terrorism is quite extensive these days. The American government is doing all it can to fight terrorism, and, more importantly, keep terrorists out of their lovely country.  Take, for example, the counter-terrorist measures at the airports. Here my grandmother is, this 75-year old woman, trying to get on her flight. They take her bag, run it through the x-ray, then pull it, rip it to shreds, while she's watching in horror. After their extensive search, they remove a tiny screwdriver that an old woman would use to fix her glasses.  Oh my god! It's a 75 year old woman with a 3cm long screwdriver! Call the national fucking guard!  No Q-tips allowed either. I'm sorry, but if an elderly terrorist can kill the entire flight crew by jamming a Q-tip into their brains, there is something seriously SERIOUSLY wrong.  I dunno, I suppose an old woman COULD be dangerous, I mean, we do vastly underestimate them, don't we. We also treat them like garbage. They don't get any respect, we ship them off to a shoddy care centre when they become a burden. Marvelous. Might as well leave them out on northern ice floes to die.  Well, to all you seniors out there, take a stand! Embrace your life! Instead of a wheelchair, use your life insurance policy to buy you a ferrari! Don't bother with walkers, get some boy scout to carry your ass around to get his badge! Make them do the work! Don't get a hearing aid, ram a cone into your friggin ear! When you can't hear somebody, don't make it be your fault, yell "Speak up! Into the cone, fuckface!!!"  Bring back euthanasia! Really, though. If somebody is in the throes of death, in intense pain, suffering a severely low quality of life and just wants to stop being a burden on the healthcare system, LET THEM!

      Fear. It is a primal sense, meant to protect one from bodily harm or death. Fear is often caused by the unknown, perhaps darkness as it overwhelms the light and prevents one from knowing what is or may be upon them. Say, demons from Hell, perhaps.  Oh, I'm PRICELESS.

      It's true. They do. What have I created with them?  When I grow up, I'm going to be a maniacal, sociopathic hitman. It's true. Tom Cruise, er, Vincent, I should say, was my inspiration!  She tells me she didn't want me to read it, because she wanted to keep the pain to herself. That, my friend, you should never do. We're in this for the long run, and we share everything; the pain, the hurt, the love, the good. All. It's true.

      I realize now I've made the same mistake twice.  Ignored the light and seen only the dark.  Happiness was always there, I just didn't realize it.  I should be happy with what I have, even if it kills me. But at least I'll die happy.  Try. Try. Try. Try.  Remember the happy times. See through the dark. I always could see in the dark.

      I came from hell, I got the tee-shirt, I came from hell, dug straight throught the dirt.  It was hot down there, and at this rate I'll freeze instead. It was damn hot down there, I'll be straight back when I'm dead.  I'm the demon clad in blue Not like the rest, I'm coming after you.  Adorned in pretty blue I'm killing me and you.

      I wonder how many times I've listened to that same song over and over again. I wonder how many times I've pictured that same face over and over again. Do you think it's healthy?  His cryptic voice behind those ravaging guitars. It haunts me, you know, but I love it, and that is the very reason why.  The sun will rise soon. I wonder what color it will be today. Maybe red. British Columbia burns to the ground, and that stained the sun red once before. It was pretty, devastating, but pretty, a lot like most things.   I will live to publish this. It's like the diary of Anne Frank, except I'm the bloody nazi.

      Soon I will unleash my army of undead gnats upon this world.  Soon.  I just need to catch a few billion gnats, kill them all, then bring them back from the dead under my control. They will crave brains. Delicious, deep fried, human brains.  Catching three billion gnats should prove to be rather cumbersome. To accomplish this mighty task, I will enlist the help of many thousand specially trained, undead ant-eaters. They will be specially trained to eat gnats instead of ants.  Now, I just need to catch a few thousand ant-eaters, kill them all, bring them back from the dead under my control, and give them a bloodlust for gnats.  As you well know, ant-eaters are fierce predators, and in order to subdue them, I will enlist the help of 17 undead badgers, three atomic monsters (I was thinking Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra), and a genetically engineered screaming albino gorrilla.  The badgers will be easy, as I have an illegal badger farm behind my computer desk. The atomic monsters owe me big time. I'm sure I can engineer something along the lines of a gorilla in my laboratory. Although I do believe I spilled egg-nog on my Albino-izer. Thats the machine that will make the gorilla white.  The only problem now is storage...  The battle will be cataclysmic, and the casualties severe, but I have to do something to pass the time, right?   Necromancy, truly LUCICROUS. LUDICROUS I SAY!  I'm well on my way to Professor Farnsworth status.

      I don't think this is who I am. I think what I am is a lie. But, like the man with the horse mask, I have befel the same fate. It hath become me.      For your malice. No, for mine, the palaces will burn to the ground. In defense of my good name, I have caused ruin. A blood junkie, I am proficient in the subtle arts of murder and persuasion. My vigil is pure, purified, although we well know I am simply a devil in God's country. When the 11th hour comes, and judgement knocks upon us all, I will be nothing more than a boot scraper.     You know what they say about me? They say:  "That boy is clever like ice is cold!"

      There is no rest for the wicked such as I.  So much whirring about my mind. I'm sharp.  Here he is, wanting to be my friend again, and here I am, being a jerk again. Oh joyous joy.  Is this really what I have become?  Malevolent. Malificent, yes, I rather like that one. She was always my favorite villian, Malificent. Of all the tepid Disney villians, she was truly good. Good in the sense that she was good at what she did. Pure, efficient evil. And you know how I like efficiency. If I could execute my plots with such efficiency as her, I would be set for life. Hell, if I could transform into a 30 foot tall dragon like her, I'd be set for life. Prince Charmings went out of style in the late 80s, so my unruly schemes would go undaunted! The world is mine!  The world is mine?  Does anybody really know what vaught is? How about avarice?   Alien vs. Predator is coming out soon. I've been waiting for this for 23 years. No, seriously. Do I want to see it for the high production value? Do I want to see these two magnificently horrid subcultural icons battle it out? Do I want to see the...*giggle*...Riveting plot and exceptional acting? Or do I just want to see a bunch of stupid humans get ripped to shreds? I choose d) Regis, and yes, that is my final answer. HA!  Why do I refuse to sleep? Is it because I seek to escape nightmares in all their glory? Do I love reality this much? Or am I simply a victim of the human condition? "Catch me please, for I am falling." Yes.    I no longer wish to scream atop the mountains. Why? What has changed? What has changed in me? Nothing has changed, I still have most of my organs, I am still the same cynical, cold, efficient sociopath that I always was. Something has changed? But what? The answers have to be somewhere, I suppose I will require some sort of machine to extract them. I shall call it "The Answering Machine." Patent pending. That applies to all of you.  I don't quite know why it is that I'm still here. I wonder about that sometimes. If I have failed my purpose, then shouldn't the game be over? Maybe I should ask Cain for another quest. I need a journey of sorts to figure things out. Pity I have no money and no superhuman strength to traverse me across Sanctuary. What have I left to offer!?  ANSWERS!

      Would I really?  What do you think?  I think not. I always think not.  Everyone else seems to think so, though.  The world was not built on could-have's, however.  The foundation is only action. And for every action there is  An equal and opposite reaction. Would I really have done the same?

      I fell asleep at 8pm today, and awoke just now to dreams I cannot conceive. Do you know that she is in every single one of my dreams?  I woke up - in more ways than one - and realized that I'm a godawful friend. I cause far more problems than I create, and not just with her. I woked up to the sound of fate.  How long has it been since we talked like we used to? How long has it been since I gave her advice? How long has it been since we talked about more than just hello and goodbye? How long has it been since I've been making her life miserable? How long has it been since I've been making his life miserable?  are just a few that come to mind.  All too long. She doesn't even come to me for help anymore, hell,  I  wouldn't come to me for help. She has better places to look.  Seeing how much of a great friend he is brings a tear to my eye. Seeing how good of a friend he is makes me realize how bad of a friend I am. He's so great. Me? I am a burden on her, nothing more.  February, what would now be more than a year ago, was when we first truly met. I remember that night, she said how anxious she would get when left alone. At that moment, I knew I had to help her, above all else. If I could have, I would have never left that house so that she wouldn't have to feel alone. My goal in life from that point on was to always care for her, always be there, always make her happy. I failed, I failed, I failed.  I woke up to the knocking of fate, did you know that? He sent me a letter, and in it was the truth. I know this because truth is easily distinguishable from lie; for someone like me, the truth is often harder to believe. He made a mistake any one of us would have made. Why persecute him? His intentions are geniune.  Tears of mine are bridled with sick laughter.   A beast of burden I have become, Upon your small shoulders, A beast of burden. I have lost.   If I end up with her in the end, will that help? I will simply have guilted her into it.  FUCK!

      Something just occured to me.  Ok, so a guy is addicted to heroin, he very much enjoys the euphoria of it. One day he runs out of money, and can't afford to buy heroin any more.  He really misses the feeling of euphoria that it brings, and he's going through bad withdrawl. In fact, his body could even go into shock and he could die.  In his discombobulated mind, he is thinking "Man, I NEED HEROIN. NEED. NEED. NEED. That is the only only thing that will make me feel better!"  Is heroin the only thing that is going to make him feel better?  Wouldn't a life of recovery and happiness be great?  Doesn't this scenario apply to many things?

      The two of them were upstairs, laughing, playing, fighting, being happy. I heard a playful scream every now and then. And here I was, downstairs, in the living room, alone in the dark, literally.  And it hit me. It has been so long since I've been happy that I don't even remember what it's like. I sat, staring blankly into the television. I was empty, completely empty. I was, no, I AM a god damned robot. Or, at the very least, close to it.  Voiced raced through my mind, speaking languages I didn't understand, thinking thoughts that I could not comprehend. Adel and Chris, laughing haughtily in the catacombs of my mind. Not all laughter precludes happiness.  I flashed back to the image of that Indian man, walking fearlessly down the runway in an attempt to stop the plane from taking off. If you've seen The Terminal, you know of whom I speak. In the theatre, when I saw that, I cried like a baby. This image, this image of a tired old man standing up to this monstrous steel juggernaught, to meet his end, to meet his destiny, struck me at my very core. I saw what he was doing, what he was doing for a friend, and I cried. Against all odds.  There was a perring knife sitting on the coffe table in front of me. I picked it up, and scrubbed off the apricot remains with the palm of my left hand.  The entire bus ride there, I looked despairingly at my left palm. I would look out the window, and out of the corner of my eye, catch the drip drip dripping of blood from my palm, and I would look, shocked at first, only to find that there was nothing. Over and over, I kept seeing this cut across my hand.  I picked up the knife, and, babbling carelessly in a language thus far unheard of, tears streamed down my face.  I knew that I was so empty, so alone. What did pain even feel like? The opposite of pain is pleasure, but if I always feel one and not the other, how will I ever tell the difference. So hollow.  I knew it had all come together like this for a reason. Crooked teeth made me this. Sore teeth from the dentist disallowed me from biting into things. I used the knife to cut up the apricot. The knife sat there, brought there by a mad destiny.  I cried myself my very own river, motioning stabbing myself several times, but could not do it. Like poor disgruntled Noah (no, not from the bible) I cried mentally disabled tears. Twitch to the left, cry a little, sniffle, open your mouth too wide, shift your jaw to the left, twitch again, bow your head left and forward, look at your shoulder, cry more and more.  Fiddling with this knife in my hands, I could not, or maybe would not cut myself. I had thought it so easy before. I dragged it slowly across my left hand, remembering back to the trip.  I heard the sound of footsteps I had heard one million times before, but not really. They were heavier than hers, less organized, they were his. He came and sat down all too close to me on the couch. He noticed the knife in my hand all too soon.  He asked why I had the knife. I didn't respond. I don't think I even knew why I was holding it. Simply because it was there? He turned and looked at my face, and right away noticed the tears strewn across my face.  I find it funny how I tried to frown. I found it difficult to get my lips over my teeth because of the braces, but did he really notice in the dark?  "What's the matter?" He says. I did not respond. I could hear the chills up and down his spine. Or maybe they were mine. She came downstairs, and he switched off the television. She knew something was wrong. She looked and saw that I was in tears. No, in shambles.  She, too, saw the knife in my hands. She hated knives. She freaked out. She was angry. She scolded me, to give it to her. I at first resisted, but what was the point? With a flashy spin of the blade, I handed her the knife. She knew me. She checked me for cuts. She made me swear that I had not cut myself. I had not.  "I'm going to die alone" I say. Boy, I live a charmed life.  I left, to clear my head, or maybe to freeze to death. Some job of that I did, I wore two sweaters on purpose.  I always knew the waning half moon lead to trouble, and it sure as hell did. It made me crazy. Surely.  "God, take me now, take me to where I belong. That is surely hell." Looking up at the night sky, free of red and clouds, clear for a change, I said this. A long silence. "Then you disagree." He must have. I am still here, are I not?  Sitting atop the school, tresspassing, although nobody but me really cared, I was alone to our thoughts. I looked up at the half moon, laughing. It was so funny to me that yet another one of my, my, oh what to call it...Predictions...Had come true. I realized something.  I  believed I was crazy,  they  believed I was crazy, but Chris and Adel were adamant; I was not crazy. In a voice that only I could make sense of, Adel put it quite eloquently, in her French accent, I might add:  "You're not insane. You're not bipolar. You're not a paranoid schizophrenic. You're not even paranoid! You know what your problem is? You're a socially mal-adjusted son-of-a-bitch."  And it made perfect sense.   Your blood is my blood now.   A destiny spun in too many directions will soon break.   Although, the thread all ends up in the same place.

      I had an epiphany today.  Well, actually, she put a gun to my head and forced me into one. Ha. Ha. Ha. Just kidding.  To you, whom I had hated for all this time, I apologize.  My hatred was ungrounded. Then again, no hatred is ever justified.  All my life I had been preaching about how hatred will destroy everything, and then I go and become a living example of it. I've decided to have a zero-tolerance policy on hatred. No more hatred. Not towards anybody. Well, except Bush. I hate Bush. It's just an awful tasting beer. *snickers*    I still don't forgive me. I don't see how anybody else can.

      It's not that the pain is all that intense, unlike before, it's just that it's constant, and refuses to go away. Oh, and the braces are that way, too.  I had this thought in my head, at 2 am last night, I thought for a second, I thought that I could make all the pain go away, and achieve what I had always wanted. Of course, I had hope, I had this OPTIMISM that everyone keeps on raving about. And, of course, my hope was shattered.  I still, in some small, miniscule way, think that there is a chance that we can be together. 1:1000000 odds is still a chance, is it not?  I saw The Villiage today. An interesting thing caught my attention.  William Hurt's character said this:   "The world stops for love. The world falls to it's knees in it's prescence."     The world hath not stopped for me. Nobody had.   Still, I am perplexed. After what I did, do I even DESERVE her? Even as a friend? How could I possibly believe that we could be together. After all this time, after all this rejection, after all this hardship, what made me think that there was a feasable chance?  Desperation.  I got braces today. I have a face full of steel, and now all I can taste is blood.  I don't even have beauty anymore.   I have to have her love. I can't let even a miniscule chance go to waste. If even for one second, I lose that chance, and opportunity arises, I will never forgive myself. I can never look at another woman. I can never be with another woman.  I remember the last time I tried to fall out of love with her. The last time I tried to fall out of love with her I nearly blew my head off.
