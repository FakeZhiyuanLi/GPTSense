      I can't find my glasses or my silverware.  I've been cleaned out.   Jake moved out and he took everything.  Literally, he took everything.  If it wasn't in my room, it wasn't safe.  Oh well.  Today I woke up, got ready, packed the car full of boxes and stuff, and headed to a garage sale on the way to Rochester.  It was nice.  I bought a great TV stand for my living room.  It even has a swivel top so I can move it one way if I want to watch TV in a different angle or something.  I dropped the rest of my stuff off at the apartment, and realized I forgot my cell phone.  It would have come in handy since Laura and Luke were a little late coming.  We were to meet at 9:45.  So at 10:00, I went and picked up Cindy.  Laura and Luke were waiting on the grass when I returned.  I gave Luke the grand tour and we headed to our first garage sales.  We shopped and shopped and shopped some more.  The one we really liked had end tables (I needed), a coffee table (I needed) and a kitchen table and chairs (I needed).  I told everyone that we'd return later and get these things.  We also stopped at others and I found a brand new set of silverware still in the box, a brand new tie/belt rack (still in the packaging) and other fun stuff.  Out in the boonies, we also found a box of Margarita glasses (9 glasses for $5) and a set of bowls, 10 for $1.  It was an awesome deal.  We dropped Luke off at work and ate lunch at Pelligrinos.  I had a great Buffalo Chicken sub.  We then headed to more garage sales in Chili, Irondequoit (which oddly enough we went a really long ways to get to something that was almost directly north of Chili in Greece) and then returned to one of the first ones to get those ends tables and such.  We made several trips to deliver all the items we bought from this one sale that is only 1 block from my apartment.  The closest sale was the best sale.  We hung out at the apartment for awhile, planned how we were going to set it up and then headed to Movies 10.  We stopped at a pizza place and got a slice, then headed to see 50 First Dates.  It was a really nice movie.  We then went to Target and shopped for some shower curtains.  I didn't like many of the ones they had, and the ones they did have were $20.  Oi.  Luke picked Laura up at 9:40 and Cindy and I headed back to my place.  Cindy gave me her shop vac, VCR from 1994, soap and a million other things.  I gave her my VCR.  Even trade, right?  Cindy asked me to take her home, so I did and I came back to Brockport.  I don't want to live here anymore.  I can't wait to move.  Tomorrow I'm going to bring the birds to their new home and bring all the plants.  I hardly have anything left.  I wish my bed was already moved.  I wouldn't come back anymore.  Night.

      I am very much looking forward to being completely moved.  After work, I dropped off my parking permit for Park Lot and met up with Laura with Cindy at my new apartment.  We hung out for awhile until the cable guy came around 5.  He was a little late.  But then we headed to Golden Port and ate great food.  We dropped Laura off and Cindy and I went to town and shopped in between trying to watch a movie at Movies 10 twice.  We never did.  But we did get to see neat furniture in four different stores and we explored Michaels and a Kitchen store in Henrietta.  I am going to love living so close to everything.  I dropped Cindy off and went back to Brockport.  Jake, Rach, Kristen and Will were packing Jake's UHaul.  Most everything is gone from the apartment.  It's kinda sad and kidna happy.  I'll feel completely normal and happy when I'm all moved into the new place and its set up.  I packed a bunch more and am going to bed.  I need to get up tomorrow, plan the route for the garage sales and then head to Rochester again.  Only 2 more trips that way until I no longer have to drive to Brockport.  Yay for me.  Night.

      So this morning was fun.  I went to the new place and dropped off a ton of stuff.  I also got McDonald's sausage mcmuffin, here's how it went down: Cashier in drivethru: Welcome to McDonalds, please wait.  Okay, sorry for the wait, can I take your order. Me: I'd like a sausage mcmuffin with two packets of ketchup. Guy: Sir, we don't serve big macs for breakfast. Me: I know, I'd like a sausage mcmuffun with two ketchups. Guy: Is that all?  That will be $1.08, please pull up. Guy: You said you wanted jelly right?  Who eats jelly on their sausage?  (By the way, why did my spell checker just suggest 'sweatshops' instead of 'ketchups'?)  Anyway, my friend Kim just had her baby.  I'm so happy for her, I can't wait to see pictures.  I got to work and immediately worked on the status report for Garry for the DARS stuff.  I'm not sure why I needed to do it in such a formal way, but I did and it looked good.  We had our usual Friday morning meeting and I went downstairs and finished some coding.  I had my usual Friday meeting with LAS.  Vicki wasn't around so I had to meet with her assistants.  Whatever, I still get paid a load to work for them too.  Garry left at noon.  I went to the gym late.  I worked for a bit and hung out with the coworkers for a bit.  It's relaxing without Supervisors.  I always love these times.  They said we can all go home at 3:30 today.  Bah, I had already planned on it!  I'm off to the apartment with Cindy and maybe Laura to wait for the cable guy.

      Luke left work as soon as he finished. He had "something to do." "I have to pack" he says. "I'm moving into a new apartment in a different city" or something like that. In any manner, I suffer withdrawal symptoms.   Now for the Rochester-Brockport Crime Bulletin  Cindy Vaca, a student at the University of Rochester admittedly ate the loaves of bread belonging to Luke Fischer, an employee and alumni of the same school. Vaca is under dorm-arrest pending trial.   Luke arrived at his apartment only to find his delicious loaves of bread completely douched. Gone. I apologized. For some reason I believed he had given them to me. I am in remorse. Luke, I totally douched your bread and I'm sorry. I'm a bread doucher. Oh, and there were FIVE loaves, and they were delicious. Oops.   CinnyDearest:  it's over! i'm breaking up with you  luke awol:  food divorce  CinnyDearest:  it's not you. it's me  luke awol:  from your food husband  CinnyDearest:  i'm divorcing you  CinnyDearest:  me and my fat  luke awol:  shut up! (that lawyer looks great on you)  I love my job. I get paid to do mostly nothing. My only beef is that I am not allowed to do that "nothing" in my room. I am forced to do my nothings in a mechanic's workshop, sitting in a hard chair, wearing clothing. (And you know how I hate to wear clothing.) The real physical labor of the day never begins before 8:30am. However, my boss (a.k.a. my favorite redneck) insists I show up to "work" at 7am so we can have an early start to our group nap and crossword puzzle. I compromise and show up at 7:30am. I guess if Tom fires me, he can stare at Dave Wingrove's legs and Jamil's chest all day.   I guess I shouldn't complain about my job. My job description is "assisting" my boss, Tom. I do, technically, assist him with the crossword puzzle and, occasionally, the jumble.  Inspired by the lovely phone conversation Ben and I had last night, I wrote him a letter to accompany the stack of photographs I'm sending to him in Massachusetts. I made myself a Shirley Temple with the grenadine he gave me and I consumed a Hershey's Cookies & Cream Bar. Feeling rather complacent, I reminded myself to appreciate the small things in life.  Speaking of small things, someone got rid of a perfectly good baby and tossed it in a dumpster in Irondequoit. I can only imagine how horrified Laura must feel right now. She lives at the apartment complex where the infant was found. She  likes babies a lot and doesn't like it when someone tosses them in dumpsters.  In my two-person computer class, I came across a picture of my friend David in my online photo album. He ran the Los Angeles Marathon this year and I was very proud of him.    urlLink    David running the LA Marathon&nbsp; urlLink     David and I met each other in debate camp in 1995. (He's the debate nerd; I'm just a debate  loser .) My best friend Kim - who also attended the camp - coincidentally transferred to his high school shortly after the camp ended. They had a two-year relationship, and naturally, David and I became friends.   In Los Angeles, I was addicted to his company and we socialized almost everyday. No film went unwatched. No late night diner went unpatroned. I have always been able to rely on David to listen to my crap. "In due time" he responds. Which actually means "stop complaining, you whiny twit." But I appreciate the sympathy. David saves me when I don't have money, or a ride, or company. He always has good advice when it comes to school, job, and life. He loves eating foods from all over the world and never ever complains about driving long distances. A part of me wishes that my situation doesn't work out and I would be forced to return to LA so I can live with my friend again. David Tom - my consolation prize.  IN DUE TIME, everyday, all of my heroes will have their tributary paragraphs as this online log is a record of my day, and my days are not possible without all the people who save me without expectations or reservations.

      Hiya,  So I was told today that yesterday's blog entry was boring.  I'll try to spruce it up a little bit.  We haven't been doing anything exciting these last couple days because I'm in the process of moving.  Anyway, Laura visited me at work today.  We're planning to go garage sale hopping on Saturday.  Sunday we might go to Lollipop Farm again.  Cindy also visited me at work, she brought me packing tape and shampoo for my gym trips.  When I got out of work, I went right to my new apartment and walked around a little bit.  It felt really good to be close to everything, close to work, close to Cindy and Laura, close to Rochester, close.  I talked for awhile with my neighbor, he's a physic professor at UR part time.  He said he's the poorest professor I'll ever meet.  He looked ragged.  Poor guy.  But at least now I know I can enter my apartment through the parking lot door and that I have a little patio if I want to sit outside.  It's pretty cool.  I dropped off a couple things in the trunk to make room for my packing.  I went home and ate some leftovers.  I couldn't find my bread from last night, so I asked Cindy if she'd seen it.  She took it and ate it today.  I think I made her feel bad, but that wasn't my intention.  I was just looking forward to some bread!  We had something like 6 6" french bread rolls left.  Jake got home and we played Champions of Norath for 10 minutes and then he left.  He came back with Rachael and Kristen, they ordered pizza and I started packing.  They asked if I wanted some so I paid $5 and ate a couple slices.  Jake later told me I ate more pizza than I paid for and made me once again feel like an idiot.  I asked him why he complains about everything.  I'd give him more money if he needed it.  But I did just host a picnic for all my friends, including him.  You'd think he'd forgive a buck or two.  Enough complaining.  So I packed for the rest of the night, loaded my car up to the brink and am headed to bed.  I watched 5 hours of TV that I've taped over the past 9 days.  It looks like I'm only got 14 hours to go.  Tomorrow I need to go to the apartment after work to wait for the cable guy around 3:30.  Garry is letting me out early.  Good night.

      I'm extremely lethargic today.  I really haven't even stood up since I came into work today.  Kinda nice not to have to see anyone this morning.  I watched the season finale of Enterprise last night before bed.  Pretty good, pretty weird.  I have a bunch of errands to run today, including returning a library book and mailing my license address change form.  I can't remember my license plate number and I forgot to look on the way in.  Arg.  I'm headed to the gym in a couple minutes with Anesa and Susan.  I think I'm going to go right home after work to start packing.  I have a load of stuff to pack.  The previous tenant of my current apartment is finally dropping off the keys today, so I'll be able to drop stuff off tomorrow.  There isn't anything interesting in the news today.  This week is dragging on.

      I get paid 25 dollars an hour. Actually, I get paid around 6 dollars an hour for eight hours of work, but I only work two hours a day but still get paid for 8 anyway. I feel my absimal productivity is justified by my meager wages. I wake up around 7:20am to make it to work by 7:30am, just in time for our group morning nap and crossword puzzle. I gathered much summer booty with my new coworker, Jamill, while we inspected (inspected = rummage & pilfered) Crosby.   Because Luke and I don't see each other enough, we celebrated the last week in his present apartment with a party of cold cuts and cheese. SURPRISE, LAURA!  Two days ago I burned my thigh on the lamp Benny gave me. Thanks, Benny.  Hijo de puta.  My burn has changed many colors: beginning with a burning red, then a blister white, finally a blushing blue. Never experiencing a burn before, I asked if this would be the final and permanent color. Laura explained that it would actually remain white and it would spread to the rest of my body. I now fear I will soon lose my ability to dance to the beat and maintain a culture.    Laura:  Yes, but at least you'll get to sit at the lunch counter.  Thanks, Laura. Thank you for taking pictures of my burn while I contorted myself into pornographic positions.  Jake asked if I enjoyed anal sex. I gave him my answer and explained why. That's all you need to know. This exciting and informative conversation was followed by Jake shoving a cob of corn into Laura's underwear. Not new to me, Laura was shocked, however.   Laura:  Living with Jake is like having corn up the ass.  Hey Laura, it's got to get there somehow.

      So last night Jake and I played Champions of Norath until 12:30 in the morning.  When I woke up, he wasn't awake yet.  I cooked breakfast and watched TV like I usually do and I finally got up to wake him up.  He freaked, got up, washed his face and left.  He said I should have woken him up 30 minutes earlier.  I got to work and go to work on DARS and MVS stuff.  Real boring to everyone else.  But I asked Emily, Katie, Janina and Susan about what I should do for our dinner.  They all had a wide range of suggestions, from casserole to Dinosaur BBQ to cold cuts.  I decided on cold cuts.  So I made a grocery list and made plans for after work.  I really don't know how the day went so fast, but it did.  Emily and I went to the gym at noon.  Not anything exciting, but while I was changing, a guy sat right next to me and started talking to me.  He's like "isn't it always the way that when two guys are in a locker room, they'll always be right next to each other?"  Umm.. buddy, you came after me.  But going to the gym 10 minutes of noon sure does give you breathing room when you're showering.  No big rush to make it back by 1.  Cindy called and I had a long conversation with her about some people she's talked to in the past couple of days.  Then my sister called and talked to me about harassing voice mails.  Then I talked to my mother.  Then I talked to like 10 companies about address changes and such.  Yeah, I got a lot of work done.  It's a slow week, so kill me! :)  I also got my car insurance reduced since I won't be using my car to drive to work anymore.  I'm canceling my parking Monday. They're crediting me $15 for parking and GEICO is crediting me $50 for walking to work from now on.  Cindy and I headed to Wegmans and I bought a ton of food for the picnic.  Ranging from cold cuts to vegetables to chips and dip.  I also bought sweet corn.  We went to the apartment around 6:05 and our guests were going to start arriving at 7.  We hurriedly cooked, making macaroni salad, spreading out the cold cuts, cutting the bread, preparing the beans and divvying up the ice.  It was quite a spread.  Laura, Luke and Jake all arrived around the same time.  Kristen also came home (after being away for a long long time).  We all laughed, talked, joked and whatever for several hours.  Cindy showed off her burn mark, Luke talked on his cell phone for two hours, Laura was funny as always and I just quietly worked on my computer.  We had a great time.   urlLink   Jake & Cindy   urlLink   Laura & Luke  Jake was in the bathroom for most of the time.  Well, he just corrected me, he was only in the bathroom for 25 minutes.  However, when he got out and we were packing things up, he tried to stick a corn cob down everyone's pants.  Laura said, "I don't think I've ever had corn down there!"  They all left around 10, after Fantasia won the American Idol competition.  By the way, the other night when I said the Hawaiian girl, I meant the girl that auditioned in Hawaii.  Sorry to those I confused.  We're just sitting in the living room discussing everything and anything.  I think Kristen is happy my friends are gone.  We were talking about how Jake always wants his way when he wants it but doesn't respond when others ask things of him.  For example, I asked him if he wanted to play video games.  He said no.  However, he's asked me to play video games the last 3 days.  I asked him if he'd skip an autocross for Rachael and he replied: I wouldn't skip the autocross even if Rachael was in the hospital.  Wow, you picked a winner Rach!  (By the way, thanks for checking out my blog.)  We'll see what tomorrow brings.  I need to start packing.

      I went to the gym.  Bah, gym.  However, since I went to lunch, I missed my usual gym lunch time.  So after 45 minutes at the gym, Cindy and I hung out at her place for awhile.  It started raining.  She finished cleaning and we went back to Burton.  We watched American Idol for awhile.. ugh.. that 2nd girl was gawd-awful.  I hope the first Hawaiian girl wins.  I agreed with Simon tonight.  I don't even watch this show and I have an opinion.  I collected a bunch of boxes from Cindy for my move this weekend (I have to pack Wednesday or Thursday) and headed home.  I started a load of laundry, started planning the dinner party with Jake, Laura, Luke, Cindy and I and chatted with Jake some.  He talked and talked and talked.. blah blah blah (I told him I'd write this).  He really didn't have anything interesting to say.  We talked about Rachael, his new place (He's living a full hour plus away from his job.  Rach is 5 minutes walking from her job) and a variety of other topics.  He just got back from a run and was soaking wet and tired.  He laid on the floor and put his legs up and started wriggling in pain.  Very weird.  We talked about the blog and how we now have a loyal fan base (hi Laura, hi Emily, hi the 35 other people that read this every day).  He did say something moderately funny (I miss Cindy and our funny quotes): Jake: I don't want to get out of these wet clothes... they're so cold. Luke: Uhhh.. that would be a perfect reason to get out of them. Jake: Not when I stand like this....  (see picture below)   urlLink     We're going to play some video games now.  My laundry is done.  Talk to you tomorrow.

      This has been an uneventful day so far.  Today was a long day, it was slow and it was painful.  Well, not so much painful as boring.    My mother came to town and we went to Peligrinos for lunch.  We both got chili.  Now you know where I get it from, right?  We talked about a wide range of topics, plus the great dinner we had with Cindy the other night. Plus, she showed me the article in the paper about how she saved that dog.  "Now remember, it's a small dog." you read my mom saying.  She instructed him on doing the heimlich. "Is he okay? I think he's okay, he's biting us now." the guy onthe other line responds.  I had fun with mom, for sure.  She went and donated blood.  Later, I did take a moment to find a great deal on a cell phone on ebay.  It comes with a bunch of cool stuff AND the cable to hook my laptop up to it to use as a modem.  That's great, seeing how I can connect to the net now with my new knowledge.   urlLink     It's a Motorola.  And if I don't like it, I can turn around and sell it or give it as a gift to someone.  Cindy and I are off to her room, apparently, ResLife yelled at her for not cleaning it.  So we'll go clean, then we'll hang, then I'm going home for one night this week and just veg.

      So Jake said he wouldn't be staying with me this summer after all, after he told me he would and I signed the lease.  That's really a shame, I only took this place because he said he'd be staying a couple nights a week.  Cindy burned herself really badly last night.  I haven't seen it yet, but it apparently started blistering almost immediately and she's peeling.  I gave her the advice I have, I hope she's okay.  Mom is coming to town today to give blood.  I'm going to try to meet her for lunch.  We'll see if Garry lets me take a longer lunch.  He shouldn't mind, but you never know.  Not really looking forward to today, it's gonna be a long one.

      Because we don't spend enough time together, Luke and I went to historic Irondequoit looking for dirt. I mean, soil. We went to the Irondequoit Bureau of Tourism looking for suggestions to absorb the culture and rapidly we were on our way to the Walmart. I went to McDonald's and took my food to the Taco Bell next door where Luke was eating burritos for the sixteenth day in a row. It's the American Way.  A gardener I am not. I don't know if I killed Benny's cilantro plant, but I certainly had no idea how to save it. My new hobby - aside from praying for miracles and sleeping on bare mattresses - will now be cultivating my baby chili pepper and basil plants. This summer I will try to keep my touch of death away from plants, and keep it safely to thoughts of babies and my dreams of happiness.   Me : Magic 8 Ball, will I see Luke again tomorrow?  Magic 8 Ball : Outcome Certain. Luke is the only one around who tolerates your sh*t. The man should be cannonized.

      Work was long, slow and kinda nice.  Cindy visited me for awhile.  We talked about plants, Jamil the ex-ICLCer turned summer mechanic, and plants and perhaps watching a movie tonight.  I suggested "Super Size Me", a documentary about a guy who ate only McDonald's for a month.  I was looking to getting my Earthlink Cable internet disconnected but they asked if they could give me a free month instead.  Whatever, at least I'll have an easy transition from the old apartment to the new.  I can keep the cable modem while I move and give it back before they give me a new one on the new account.  Hopefully I can get the $30/month deal again at the new place.  Cindy and I left Rochester for Irondequoit in search of planting material.  Laura suggested we check out a couple small green hatcheries in the areas.  But she was eating dinner, so we decided to waste time at Walmart, our Rochester getaway.  However, after getting slightly misdirected off of 104, I found my way to Taco Bell.  But we didn't go to just Taco Bell, the McDonald's was right next door.  So Cindy got McD and I got tacobell and we ate like kings.  However, it was really slow, the ice machine was haunted and they gave me the two largest bean burritos I have ever seen.  These things put Ragin' Burrito to shame.  We went to Walmart and found soil, seeds, cat toys (for my new kitten next week) and bikes.  I'm still not sure which bike to buy, we'll see.  Mom has offered $100 toward a bike, so I need to pick one soon.  I ain't walking to work.  Well, I might.  I do need to workout more.  Doesn't Cindy look good on this bike?   urlLink     Gas was only $2.07 at the SuperKiss, so I filled up.  We then found our way back to 104 and stopped at Laura and Luke's place.  We stayed a long time, watched TV, played on the computers, talked, drank all their water and soda.  I told Luke about the Verizon Wireless Quick2Connect service, qnc, that is included with all Verizon phone plans.  It lets you connect your laptop to the internet through the cell phone for free any time anywhere while in their digital network.  We worked for 2 hours to get it working.  We couldn't get it to work.  It would connect, but our username/password was wrong.  I gave up, we left, I dropped Cindy off, and returned home.  Luke called and told me he finally got it to work, the username and password were both qnc.  Argh!  The one combo we didn't try.  Alas, now I can spread the news.  Off to bed, while Jake is cheating his way to the top of Champions of Norath without me.  I invited him to a small picnic I want to hold Thursday or Wednesday at our apartment, but he didn't think he could make the time to spend dinner with his friends.  Hopefully Laura and Cindy are interested, otherwise I'll be eating along come the picnic!  Night.  Quote:   Directions : Place rocks or broken clay pieces in bottom of pot.  Cover with soil.  Cindy : So what should I put in the bottom of the flower pot instead of that?  Luke : Perhaps pieces of your broken heart?  Cindy : Or my hopes and dreams?

      I discovered why the vapid sitcom Full House ran for 8 years while I was staying at Luke's House Saturday Night. While everyone was sleeping, I was in the living room looking for comfort from cable television. I watched Full House and loved every minute of it because IT REQUIRES NO THINKING! Two married couples and a single bachelor choosing to live together in one Bay area house with five children makes perfect sense at five in the morning.  Breakfast at Brockport Diner. Kittens at Lollypop Farm. (Cats are the Devil's spawn). And because we feel we don't eat enough, and because Luke feels like he doesn't feed me enough, and because we don't eat there enough, Luke took me to Golden Port. When I die, I want to be wrapped in rice paper nestled in a bed of rice noodles, my head resting on a pile of fresh basil leaves.  Later that night, I was pelted by bricks of loneliness. Sean Martell took me to the Elmwood Inn where we drank a pitcher of Yeung Ling (highly recommended), took a kamikaze shot with a tequila sunrise chaser. In our drunkeness, we flung plastic darts at a wall that seemed to be made of teflon. Or maybe we just suck at darts. Oh, and vodka. We had more vodka. Why does drinking alcohol at two in the morning seem like such a great idea when work begins at 7am?  Thanks Luke. Thanks Sean. You two are much better than Nick at Nite.

      Not to get too geeky, but during a break from programming, I started looking for a cable to hook my cell phone up to my laptop.  Wow, they're like $69 for a small little cable.  On ebay, they're a little cheaper, around $40.  I'm not that anxious to connect my laptop up to my 15 cents/min cell phone, but it would also allow me to backup my contacts on my cell and install new ringtones.  However, while searching ways to connect a laptop to a cell phone I came across a guy who lives out of his RV and decided to build his own rudimentary connection system.    Take your phone off the hook (The phone that's only plugged into your modem) and grab a cellular headset. Take the part you press into your ear and tapes the earpice to the mouthpiece of the phone, then take the microphone part of the cellular hands free and tape that part to the hearing [speaker] part of the phone.  Then dial your local access number [The one you call when your own your home computer]  Try to hold the earpiece of the handsfree up to your ear. As soon as you hear that terrible screetching noise click DIAL CELLULAR, the laptop will then wait 2 seconds and send out the calling tone that the internet service provider is waiting for.  Before you know it it says connected and you will be happy as can be.  This guy is fascinating!  He actually hooked up a handset to his computer, taped the earpiece of a headset of a cell phone to the phone and got his computer to connect.  His only downside: when his wife vacuums, the phone picks it up and disconnects.  I'd try it, but I think I'd rather buy the cord than waste money on a project.  There's cheap Luke poking his ugly head out again.

      I really need to master this whole getting up in the morning thing.  I woke up this morning 20 minutes late, so I was rushed out the door without lunch (I grabbed a couple cereal bars Cindy gave me last week).  I've been changing my address for different things in my life to the new apartment, bank, credit cards, paypal, etc when I came across a promotion for a VISA World Shopping Tour in Milan, Paris, London, Buenos Aires or Tokyo.  All I have to do is use my VISA debit card... a lot.  It's worth $150,000 and includes accommodations for four people, so I could take three friends.  I'm trying to think who I would take.  I would of course take Laura and Cindy.  But who to take as the 3rd?  I could take Jake, but I don't know how much fun he'd be on the trip.  There are a couple other people I could take, but I just don't know.  This is a hard decision.  I'll have to think about it more.  Maybe Laura and Cindy and I could just go and we could spend the extra money they'd give us for not taking a 3rd person?  How nice it would be to travel the world and be free.

      So I had a great Sunday afterall.  Lollypop Farm was terrific.  I met a bunch of kittens, one of which I hope to adopt next week.  I've got a bit of work before I can do that, but that's not too bad.  We also walked around and met some horses, including one that was extremely thin and sick.  Cindy liked that one a lot and would adopt it for sure if she could.  However, her dorm room is a bit small.   urlLink     After explaining the finer points of egg differences and pot belly pig intelligence, we moved on to Golden Port.  We had a great meal, including some samples of some "extra" food that Wayne had in the back.  We went back to Cindy's room and moved some more of her stuff.  I swear, for someone that has so little, she has a ton of stuff.  And its heavy!  After moving it up 16 floors in Burton, I returned home to an anxiously waiting Jake.  After cleaning my room, eating a little dinner and running a couple errands, we went outside and took some pictures of his tires (he needed them to get feedback from car people on the internet).   urlLink     It started to rain and a thunder and lightning storm hit quickly.  Meanwhile, we started playing Champions of Norath, a game that is taking us forever to finish.  It's like a 100 hour game and we're only on hour 12.  However, I got some laundry done.  I finally found my cell phone, it was hidden in the recliner.  Amazing how fun my life was this weekend, huh?

      After a great breakfast with Jake, shopping at the video game store, then the dollar general, then the used cd's store, Cindy and I are sitting in CLARC.  We're headed to Lollypop Farm to see their selected, since I will be adopting a cat next week sometime.  Although I doubt I'll adopt one there, I'm keeping my options open.  The animal shelter where my mother lives usually has kittens.  Wish us luck.

      So, after a loud and stormy night, we got up and sat in the living room.  Cindy had just gone to bed around 6 so Jake and I woke her up by talking and watching the weather channel.  I'm surfing the web when I get breaking news.   urlLink CNN.com - Bush falls on bike ride - May 22, 2004   Yes, thank you CNN, I needed to rush to the website to see this.  We're gonna go to breakfast, but it depends on if Cindy is awake enough.

      Empty dormitories lead to uninhibited showering practices. The early morning began well. My fears of showering alone were quelled by one Mr. ChrisSinclair. It was expectedly platonic. Without physical contact, we held a watery 40-minute conversation on a variety of topics, including prefered showering methods, his internship in Texas, and manipulative marketing practices of the hygiene product industry.  ChrisSinclair believes there are too many chemicals in body soap, so he vowed when he invents a new body soap, there would only be two ingredients: water, and soap. Soap to make the water soapy, and water to make the soap "liquidy." It's a good thing you have a 4.0 in mechanical engineering, because I doubt your success in the emulsifying agents industry. On a sentimenal note, I'm watching The Best of Christopher Walken on SNL. ChrisSinclair and I love him and I wish I could be with ChrisSinclair right now. I missed you even before you left my door.  I hope you're sitting down, because you're not going to believe this: Luke and I went out today. Yes, I know. We saw Shrek 2 in Brockport in a theatre full of children. At the first high-pitched scream, I wanted to shove my hand inside my womanly cavity and rip out my uterus.   While I'm in the habit of shocking all of you, Luke and I went to Taco Bell again. Third day in a row. We should get frequent-visitor cards, or a free burrito, or a roll of toilet paper or something. I'll talk to a manager about that tomorrow...when we go again.  Luke: it's going to be   so   busy at work next week. Me: Why? What's going on? Luke: My boss gave me, like, five things to do. Me: Wow, so now you'll have, like, five things to do.  Luke is the only person in the world who doesn't think I'm an asshole.   I wonder what tomorrow will bring. Oh, hey, more Luke! The days have just become fodder for my blog. My life is blog fodder. Blog Fodder. hee hee. Say it out loud. It's so funny. I mean it. Do it now. Blog Fodder. hee hee.

      So Cindy and I went to see Shrek 2 at the Strand in Brockport.  This was after I drove to Rochester and waited outside the dorm forever for someone to let me know.  I don't know Cindy's new number yet (well, now I do).  We went to the Strand in Brockport and watched Shrek 2.  It was pretty good, except the ending sucked.  Probably because the film caught fire and burned and they had to take 25 minutes to play the last 5 minutes of the movie.  Half the theatre got up and left.  We went to Mark's Pizzaria and ate a slice of pizza.  Seeing how I'm cheap, we went to Walmart to buy bottles of soda.  We also got taco bell.  We returned to the apartment and watched TV with Jake.  Then Jurrasic Park came on and we're watching that.  Jake offered ice cream and other stuff (well, we asked for it) so we're just hanging out.  Apparently there is a severe lightning storm with tornados going on.  They won't stop telling us on the TV.  Cindy is singing and plucking, it's real nice.  Jake asked Cindy to cuddle, Cindy asked Jake to shower.

      Woke up, my room-mates stuff was mostly gone... its really weird to see everything gone or going.  At least I'm still all here.. for at least a couple more days.  Watched TV for awhile and now I'm off to go furniture shopping for the new apartment.  I got a really nice shelf from Crosby that somebody left behind.  It's great quality.  Now to find some other nice stuff.  I haven't planned what the new place will look like, but I definately want it to look more home-like than dorm-like.  So I'm off.  I'm picking Cindy up around 4:30 to come back to Brockport to watch Shrek 2.  That should be fun.  Maybe we'll do Taco Bell again.

      I only associate with people who can make lactose udderly fascinating. Get it? Shut up. (That shirt looks great on you.) Evidently, the angry, "punky" Canadian, Avril Lavigne, has attributed her embittered and hateful lyrics to her consumption of too many carbohydrates. (I attribute her bad lyrics to lack of insight, life experience, and oh, talent. But what do I know? I'm not a music snob.) Miss Lavigne has found peace in her new organic, low-carb diet. We can only look forward to a lighter, more effervescent, brand of dribble - as opposed to her customary morose, yet pointless, dribble.  Back to the lactose. Available for your misguided consumption, American Dairy Farmers introduce Low-Carb Milk! Now you can enjoy your milk with slightly less guilt. However, Luke astutely pointed out that the carbohydrates in milk come from lactose, and lactose-free milk has been available for quite some time.   Luke: People can just drink lactose-free milk! Cindy: Or don't drink milk at all, like me. But I don't drink it because I can't afford it. Luke: And some people don't drink milk because it leads to more risky behavior.  Thank you, Luke, for making fun of my weakness, poverty, and penchant for dairy.  Today, both Luke and ChrisSinclair helped me move from the basement of Crosby to Burton 3, which is actually Burton 4, but seems like 5. Whatever. The point is that we all went to eat and I didn't pay BECAUSE I'M A BIG FUCKING LOSER WHO HASN'T PAID FOR A MEAL IN THREE YEARS! The shame goes away after the first year - it really does. I almost wear it like a badge. My new room is great. It's four flights up, very very hot with one window, and much much smaller than my old room. Yep, I got it made. I stood up from kissing my rats and banged my head on the ceiling. Now I know what Luke feels like.   LukeyLuke and I mosied on over to the Mecca of Rochester (Walmart) to pick up my pictures of Benny. Three roles of film dedicated to someone who never cared about me. Hey, I look great. Sheila looks great and Luke looks great which is the most important thing. Remember kids, personalities fade but good looks are forever.  We jet to Luke Osborne's house where Laura and I make fun of Luke Fischer's extremely bad memory. His feelings were hurt, but I doubt that he even remembers any of it by now. Not that we cared. hee hee. In the car, we decided that Laura likes to boil babies in a tub and make them into soap.   I am currently blogging at ChrisSinclair's apartment. ChrisSinclair (one word) - he's more hair than funny. He's the only person in the world who doesn't laugh at Luke's jokes. He lacks the gene which enables people to appreciate the absurd.  Luke, when are we going to start losing weight again? Damn you and your job! Your employment status is making me fat!  Sheila: What business does a hispanic girl have going tanning? Why does Cindy go tanning??? Luke: To make her teeth look whiter.   Luke: Thanks for making me laugh before bed. Me: Thanks for making me fat.  Good night, Luke. May you have sweet nerdy dreams about your creepy caucasian aliens. Zzzzzz

      It seems like I never go home after work anymore.. not that that's bad.  I went to Emily's apartment to see if her old computer was good enough to buy for my sister for college, who is attending this fall.  It's pretty good, except the hard drive I brought to put into the machine needed to be formatted, and it took 10 minutes to get to 1%.  So I moved it to the external case and tried again and it was 10 minutes and it hit 1%.  Poor Emily had to sit through all my jokes.  After Emily, I headed back to campus to help Cindy move to Burton.  Chris Sinclair was already helping her move and they moved more than half the stuff already.  So I helped move a couple things and Cindy got zapped by the tv when she was unhooking it.  Then we went out to dinner at Taco Bell.  We've eaten there like 4 times this week.  I think I'm done with tacos for awhile.  I don't think Chris Sinclair liked my jokes too much, he didn't seem to laugh much.  He dropped us off at campus and Cindy and I moved more stuff and set her room a little.  Laura and Luke called and we made plans to visit them.  We went to WalMart to finally pick up the pictures and the guy behind the counter had no idea what was going on.  He was from another department, so every answer to our question was "Yeah, sure.  I think.  Yeah."  I think we could have asked him anything and we would have gotten the same answer.  The cashier we checked out with was amazed that I was happy.  Cashier 'Harlet': Well, you're in a good mood tonight! Luke: I'm always in a good mood. Cindy: He's got this metobolic disorder that keeps him happy all the time.  We looked through all the pictures and a couple of them were pretty good! I'll post one later.  We headed up North to Laura and Luke's and hung out with them for awhile.  We of course stayed too late.  I'm actually still here.  Haha.   Quote:  "Gah!  You can't quote anyone right.  This is our world (she gestures in a circular motion in the air)... and this is YOUR world (motions in another spot in the air)!" - Cindy, explaining how I can't quote anyone right.

      So this afternoon I'm working on a todo listing that my boss gave me and one of the items was to get the backup server working on everyone's desktops.  It's not hard, it was just time consuming.  Well, I went to do it on Lynda's computer and since I know what I'm doing, I do it really fast.  So before she knew anything, I was done and said this is what you do and this is where you go.  I confused her and she wanted it back the way it was.  I explained I can't do that since Garry told me to do it this way.  I then explained to her that shared files go on the H drive and personal files go on the F drive.  She didn't want the whole staff seeing the files she shares with Lori and wanted me to change it back the way it was.  I told her I can't change it back, because "back" wasn't the way she's thinking.  The files she though were private before weren't private.  They were public on everyone's computers.  So she got frustrated and said she wanted the shared files she put up put into her private folder.  So I showed her and she moved them.  I told Garry that I was all set and she moved the files to her private area.  He didn't like that.  He looked at me and said "Move them back." in a very angry tone.  Ugh.  If she doesn't want files out in public, why can't she keep them private?  Whatever, so I went back to Lynda and said "You're not gonna like this... I need to move them back to the shared folder."  So after making her mad and making Garry mad, I went back to my office.  Ugh, why do they put me in the middle of their rivalry?  What did I ever do to them? :)

      My boss, let me out a little early so I could go pick up my Aunt Deb from the airport.  Cindy came with me and we headed to Waterloo.  Deb was of course very funny.  My sister called and asked if we wanted to go to dinner with her, my mother and Deb.  Cindy saw some cows and wanted one for a pet.  So we drove for an hour and stopped at Taco Bell to see my Aunt Mary Joan and my grandmother.  We chatted for awhile and then headed to Connie's diner for dinner.  We ate for awhile, I had a turkey club and Cindy had a tuna melt.  We told a lot of jokes and laughed a lot.  Cindy and I headed back to Rochester in a lightning storm.  I dropped her off and headed back to Brockport.  Now I'm just sitting in the living room with Jake, Kristen, Rachael and their friend.  I said hi to Jake and he of course told me to shut up.  Ahh.. this is the life.  Quotes:  (Describing the aliens in the tv show) "Well, they were tall... played by women and very white." - Luke "Oh god, those scary caucasian aliens!" - Cindy  "Well, you have a small tank." - Aunt Deb "Excuse me??" - Luke "We didn't want to bring it up Luke, but it had to happen." - Deb

      I just got back from the Atlanta Bread Company with Katie and Emily.  I've never been there but it was a fantastic place to eat.  Very clear and very nice food presentation.  A little on the expensive side, though.  But the conversation is always the high point when eating with Emily. :)  Katie told us a new pick up line she heard about at the bar she works at:   A guy walks up to a girl at the bar.  Guy: My watch tells me things. Girl: Oh really? Guy: Yeah, it's telling me that you're not wearing any underwear. Girl: Whatever, I am too wearing underwear. Guy: (Shakes wrist, listens to watch.) Oh, that's right, it's an hour ahead.  I read an interesting  urlLink article  on male eating disorders, something that's always on my mind.  Obsessive exercise, low eating, bulemia, all important things to keep in perspective when trying to lose weight.  Researchers at the University of Central Florida released a study this month saying men who watched TV commercials of muscular actors felt unhappy about their own physiques. This "culture of muscularity" can be linked to eating disorders or steroid abuse, the researchers said.  Dr. Theodore Weltzin of Rogers Memorial Hospital in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, said one study showed 70 percent of high school males dieting.  It's amazing how hard it is to skirt the line of dieting and eating disorder.

      Getting ready this morning reminded me of a funny story I didn't share from yesterday.  I really should be leaving now to get to work on time, but whatever.  Yesterday I woke up really late since I was out really late with Cindy.  So I set my alarm to be about 10 minutes before I needed to leave.  But guess who was running   really   late that day?  Yep, Jake.  He decided he was going to use the bathroom and then shower in the last 10 minutes of my morning, which he knows is when I shave and brush my teeth.  So as soon as he was in the shower, I knocked and went in.  Every time I used the hot water he would sqeel.  It was pretty funny.  Hot water on... Cue Jake.  Hot water on... Cue Jake.  Haha, serves him right to take my bathroom time.

      So Cindy and I did our yearly Summer scavenge.  We've done it every Summer since my Sophomore year Summer.  We got a couple grocery bags and went from dorm to dorm in the quad and found food in kitchens and in lounges that people just left behind.  Cindy had already looked through several buildings since she's working in the quad as a mechanic this Summer, but there was plenty of stuff left for the both of us.  Gilbert and Hoeing were the big stashes, the others not so much.  I came home with 3 bags of food and a three tier shelf table.  It's a nice end table and should fit into the new apartment nicely.  Now just to find matching furniture, right?  We then promptly went out to taco bell.  Cindy had a craving as she put it.  Had a couple bean burritos.  Went to walmart to pick up the film, but it won't be ready until Friday.  I guess we'll go back Friday.  Hey, I heard on the radio that Darien Lake is having Mardi Gras weekend a week from this weekend.  Should be fun, we should go.

We just walked to the Finacial Aid office and that dude that was so rude to me when I took summer course was there to help.  He's so apathetic and demeaning.  You tell him you need one thing and he'll tell you that you need something else.  You tell him you want one thing and he'll hand you forms without seeing if you've filled them out.  I don't like him, but they keep him because they have high turnover there.  So I wonder what tonight will bring, I don't have any plans.  All I know is it's 5:00 and I'm done for the day!

      After work Yakiv and I went to the landlord's office and I signed the lease.  I hadn't intended to actually sign a lease, but he said if I didn't, he was planning to raise the rent $20 and also start showing the apartment to interested parties.  Well, I don't really want people in my apartment when I'm not there, and I really don't want strangers there when I am home!  But anyway, so I signed it for 12 months.  At least this way, it'll be over in May next year, in case I get a chance in job or something.  We'll see.  I went back to UR to try to comfort Cindy, but instead we went and ate at a Japanese hibachi restaurant.  Woah, it was a lot of food.  I ordered the tofu dinner and Cindy ordered the steak dinner.  I chuckled when the cook asked how I wanted my steak done.  Apparently, I'm not the de facto tofu eater.  We left there and headed to Walmart to drop off finished rolls of film for Cindy.  I checked the movie times and we chose to go see Kill Bill 1.  I haven't seen it yet.  So we walked around the store looking at stuff for a little bit to waste some time when we realized the movie started 45 minutes ago.  So we chose Troy, the new movie with Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom.  We bought some candy (heath bites) and headed to Regal in Henrietta.  Cindy was cold so I gave her my only sweatshirt in the car, an ugly red Nebraska thing.  I wore a leather coat my Aunt gave me and stuffed the candy and soda into the coat.  We looked like hicks walking into the theater.    We got into the theater and to our surprise, Raqella was there with her friend.  It brightened Cindy up and we sat with them.  Cindy proclaimed I was funny to sit with in the movie theater and to our delight, we found out all four of us like to talk during the movies.  It seems we no longer watch slides before a movie, but full fledge commercials.  So after 25 minutes of commercials and another 10 minutes of movie previews, the movie started.  It was pretty good.  I like most movies, so when I say its good, people like Jake may hate it.  Whatever.  There were lots of battles, lots of blood, lots of fighting.  It was great and Brad Pitt did a good job in his role as Achillies.  So after 3 HOURS of watching nonstop action, I dropped Cindy off and went home to bed.    Quote:  Cindy: Do you have side impact air bags? Me: No, I only have underneath and in-back air bags. So if we get hit by a rocket from behind, we'll  be okay.

I rushed to UR to find that even though I was late, I could still help out.  Laurel put me in the handicapped section to help people in wheelchairs.  When I arrived, there were already 10 people standing around doing nothing.  It was one stinking cold morning.  I wore my new shirt and tie from yesterday and my new boots (I find that they are one size too small and now I can't return them.. ugh, oh well).  I sat through the hour long ceremony. The CEO of Warner Brothers gave the commencement address, apparently he's also part of the board of trustees.  He was talking about all the WB's movies, shows, etc, etc and then got political.  While I agreed with him on almost every issue, it really wasn't the best time to be giving this speech.  It didn't relate to the graduates at all.  I'm glad my graduation was a bit better, even if they did ask us for money during the ceremony!  I went to the free brunch they offered and then went to Susan's ASL ceremony.  Very interesting and light hearted.  A bit less mellow than the Computer Science ceremony I had during my graduation. :)  I then went and found Sheila and her family and hung around them until the ceremony for Psych in Strong.  Very logn ceremony.. so many people in that department.  But it was nice and it was for Sheila. Except her father now thinks I'm her boyfriend.  He asked me about a ring?  Oh boy.  The Psych reception was in a really small enclosed area and I had to fight for a cookie.  Not my idea of a celebration, but whatever!

      I went shopping with Laura today.  We met up around 1:00 at Old Navy.  I bought a couple Luke-esque tshirts for the summer.  We headed to marketplace and I bought a couple pairs of shoes (sandals and boots).  I also bought 2 new dress shirt/tie combos at JCPenny.  They're pretty nice, I look forward to wearing them next week at work.  Laura and I went and picked up Luke at CompUSA (I love that store...).  While I was there, I picked up Krispy Kream donuts for a graduation present to Jake and Kristen.  I felt bad I couldn't give any to Laura and Luke.  I suppose I could have gotten a couple extra.  :)  We headed to park lot, dropped off two cars (Luke's and mine) and headed to the Lilac festival.  It was freakin cold, but we managed to buy a candle and Luke bought a bird house gourd.  We ate Nick Tahou's garbage plates (a must at the Lilac festival) and then headed back to our cars.  I went looking for Cindy and Sheila, but they were both out to dinner.  So I headed back to the apartment and hung out for the rest of the night.

      Oops!  I forgot to mention I picked up Laura on Monday night at the airport!  She was flying back from DC after a weekend getaway (getaway from Rochester) for Luke and her to check out the area since she'll be moving there in a couple months.  Luke started his new job.  On the way back to her place, a cop pulled out behind me and I knew he was going to pull someone over, since we were all going 60.  But he pulled over the guy that passed me going 60, which meant he was going 70.  Haha, sucks for him.  Laura and I chatted and then I went home. :)

      Sunday was a really lazy day which was nice.  All day to myself with the cat.  She likes it when I'm home all day for her to torture.  I went for a run in the evening.  Monday I worked all day, took a walk around the block during lunch and then after work I went to dinner and Wegmans with Linda.  She had a craving for junk food (and me being a junk food expert) I wanted to help.  We ate at Wendy's for under $5 together and then she spent $70 on groceries.  I spent $12.  Seeing how she's 2 feet shorter than me, it seems a bit unbalanced, but hey, I'm cheap.  I meant to go to the gym but I couldn't find the time.  I wanted to go for a run but I couldn't find the energy.  This morning I woke up at 6 and Linda and I went to the public market, which by the way is REALLY empty at 6am.  Best to come at 7 or 8am after they've all set up.  But I got everything I wanted (but the prices were a little bit more than I'd hoped).  I came back, fell asleep and then went to work.  Blah, I'm here now. :)

      So I haven't posted in almost a week.  Whoops.  So back to Tuesday mid-day. After mom picked up Nola, I dropped my TV off at a repair shop in downtown Rochester.  The shop was really sketchy, but it was a mom and pop shop and they would repair it the cheapest in the city.  Most other places wanted to charge me over $100 to repair my $300 TV, so no, I'd rather let a short, bald, fat and hairy man fix my television than be overcharged.  The neighborhood was really frightening, with half naked people walking around and them drinking on the streets.  I still didn't feel my best, but I had errands to run, so I went to walmart, picked up some medicine and picked up some other items, stopped by and paid by eye doctor bill, picked up a couple DVDs and then went and picked up my tv.  Wednesday, after work, I went to the Farmington Racing Casino (Racino) with Deb and blew a ton of money.  I only stayed an hour because Laura was having a goodbye party for Luke (they left Thursday) and she got Dino BBQ, so I sped back, picked up Cindy at UR then we sped to her place (her place since Luke is moving and she is staying).  We hung out, had margaritas and ate good food.  Kerri was there and it was nice catching up with her.  Cindy had to leave to go study.  Thursday Cindy and I hung out at my place for the evening.  She had homework, I had to clean.  I cleaned the place from top to bottom and got it ready for the Vakarias, whom I was hosting this weekend.  I planted a bunch of plants and such.  Friday was an all day professional development (waste of) day.  I didn't plan to eat, but when the Italian food came out I couldn't resist.  I sat with Anesa, Katie, Kelly and JB.  So we sat through presentation and presentation.  I lent my laptop for one of their presentations.  The afternoon was a little better.  We had group discussions, I sat with Suzanne OBrien and a couple others and had the best ideas (I'm not being conceited).  I also presented to the bigger group and we dismissed for the day.  I came back to the apartment and Sheila and Dimple arrived as I was changing my clothes.  So we hung out, I let my aunt know I wasn't coming to Grace's birthday party (I was staying to hang out with Sheila and go to Fahrenheit 9/11).  Sheila wanted to go to Golden Port for dinner, but I was sickened by all the food from the day, so Dimple and her left without me.  Cindy asked me to pick her up, so I did and asked to be taken to Golden Port to join them for dinner.  They weren't there, they went to Taco Bell instead.  So we went back to my place and hung out until Shiela came back and picked Cindy up and went and ran errands.  I fell asleep, and waited since we were going to see Fahrenheit 9/11 at 9:30.  They called at 9:30 and said they weren't going to the 930 show that instead would go to the 1020 show at Tinseltown (the most expensive theatre in the county).  They had gone to Golden Port (without me) and wanted me to meet them at the theatre (since Golden Port is all of 3 min from my place).  So I met them at the movie place and they were sold out (we were 10 minutes late as well), so that kinda spoiled the night.  I stayed home tonight (instead of hanging with my family) to hang with Sheila and watch the movie.  So we went back to my place and Cindy wanted to go dancing.  I didn't, I don't enjoy those clubs since I'm a towering, huge, ugly, and undancable white guy. :)  Sheila (rightly so) stayed with me and we watched a movie while Cindy went out with Dimple.  I ordered a pizza and it came after Cindy and Dimple came back for the end of our movie.  We hung out until 3am, and then Dimple took Cindy home.  Saturday I left early to get to my mother's in time to go to my sister's high school graduation.  I helped out a bit to prepare for the party, we had some strawberry daiquiris and went to the school.  It was a long and boring ceremony, but we hung out for pictures and I shook some people's hands, saw a couple people I graduated with and we went back to my mom's place for the party.  The food was good!  Mom knows how to cook (or I'm just really used to her food).  Macaroni salad, pasta salad, pretzel salad, cheese salad, bbq chicken and more strawberry daiquiris.  The cake looked great (it had Molly's picture on it) and tasted good too.  My mom's garden produced at least 16 gallons of strawberries, so I think I'll be eating them until I die.  she gave me a bag of berries and a quart of homemade jelly to bring back with me.  I fell asleep and eventually woke up in time to get going back to Rochester.  We were going to try to see F 9/11 again.  I got back and Sheila, Cindy and Dimple were at Golden Port again (without me) and said they wanted to see the 10:20 showing at Tinseltown.  So I hung out and waited until they got back and we left for the movies.  Luckily, it wasn't sold out again.  We watched it, it was a GOOD documentary.  I'm not a Bush fan, but even if I was, I'd have to question everything I had ever thought about him.  This gave me such insight into everything, it confirmed some of my suspicions and whoa... it showed me stuff that I never ever even considered.  It was well worth the $16 I paid for it (since Cindy forgot to bring money).  Dimple's friend and Dimple came back to our place after we left the movie and we hung out for several hours.  It's nice having cable but my guests get more use out of it than I do.  This morning the Vakarias left and my life has gotten quiet again, which is nice.  Hopefully this will be a day of catching up.

      On the Nineteenth Day, of the Seventh Month, of the Year of Our Lord, 2004, Luke and I went back in time to the Romulus Community Church for a wedding between three people: a man, a woman, and their savior. Jesus Christ was the main character of this play, the bride and groom merely extras.   Pastor:  Jesus Jesus Jesus. Christ Christ Christ. Hey, these people are getting married. Repent all ye sinners. Jesus Christ is #1.  Woof!   So what's the point? THE POINT IS Luke and I were the best looking couple there. Word up to Mr Matt Mann, groomsman and usher from Sloansville, NY. He was super super cute. I was silently wishing he would ask me out, so we could go on three dates and I would inevitably get bored of him like every other guy I like because he's good looking. I guess it's best nothing happened. I couldn't possibly go out with someone from Sloansville. [Pardon me, while I climb this ladder to pick my nose.]  I spent quality time with Luke's horse, Tasha. She is a healthy happy horse with a full belly and a perfectly round peach-like behind. I'm jealous. I played with the doggies and poked the piggies.   The night in Fayette (West Fayette, thank you) capped off with a viewing of Stephen King's 1984 Children of the Corn starring a less man-like Linda Hamilton. It was a nightmare. Devout christians are always terrifying and Stephen King knows it. It was only fitting that our sinful, gluttonous, Christ-less day ended with Children of the Corn.  The Power of Christ compels me to go to sleep.

      Friday night: So that night, Laura, Cindy and I went to East Ave.  Lots of music, lots of drinking, some Golden Port.  We walked around for awhile, I got some magnets for my fridge, I met JB and Kasper from 98pxy and that was about it.  We came back to my place, watched TV, hung out and went to bed.  We woke up at 8 to get ready for the wedding.  We got going around 9:30, the wedding was at 11.  We got there with about 25 minutes to spare.  We found our way into this 'church', and I put quotes around it only because it was more like a community center than a church, and Cindy and I talked until the wedding started.  Colleen (the bride) gave me Audrey's (highschool friend) camera to take pictures.  When the wedding started, Colleen started coming down the aisle and she looked terrific.  However, the camera was VERY loud and started rewinding as I was taking a picture of the bride.  So I changed rolls and took as many pictures as possible of everyone involved.  The wedding was summed up like this:  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, we come here today Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, to wed these two Jesus, Jesus, people Colleen and Anton Jesus, Jesus, repent repent may the Lord be with you Jesus, and its not too late for all you nonbelievers.  Amen.  Cindy and I got out of there and went to my mom's to drop off our stuff and kill some time before the reception at the Holiday Inn in Waterloo at 2.  But since we were in our nice clothes (Cindy looked fantastic), we couldn't do much.  We got down to the reception and waited around about 45 minutes for everyone to arrive.  My shirt matched the entire wedding completely, so I think I was mistaken for one of the people in the wedding party.  I was in a nice suit after all. I got a mixed drink (I had to tell her how to make it) and we ate so much cheese and crackers I felt I was going to explode.  But the main meal started (a buffet) and we ate with two lovely people that my mother actually knows.  So we talked to them about travel, California and our cross country trip Cindy and I are taking later this Summer.  The food was VERY good.  However, it was more salt that I'm used to.  But I liked it: rice, vegies, chick with breading and other fine things.  There was no dancing so we were bummed.  Nola and Molly were having issues with work and I needed to go home to take Nola to work.  So Cindy and I excused ourselves before we got cake, said goodbye to Colleen, Anton, Audrey and made our way outside.  We promptly went to McDonalds and got ice cream cones for a treat.  We got home and we changed and hung out while Nola and Mom got ready.  We were going to the casino that night and I offered to drive mom instead of her going with my aunts in their vehicle.  Cindy petted the horse (and I took some really nice pictures, but my PDA lost them when it ran out of battery power).  She hung out with the horse forever and it ended up licking/biting her knee.  But we went and dropped off Nola, got gas and headed for Verona (past Syracuse).  That takes about 75 minutes.  We got to the casino and made our way in.  I had to get a replacement gambling card, and I also forgot my free play :( .  But we found Deb and Mary Joan, gambled for a bit, then went to dinner at one of the restaurants.  It was really good.  We hung out, laughed, talked and ended up heading back to gamble while Mary Joan, my mother, and Frank went to the concert.  Cindy and I walked around for awhile while Deb gambled at the $1 machines (she ended up winning over $300) and I came out about $20 in the hole.  But Deb gave me $20 to go to the movies with Cindy, so we sped off to a neighboring area to watch a movie.  We got there (after I hit a curb) and found the movie was 30 minutes in.  So we went back home.  We got back, Cindy and Nola watched a movie (children of the corn I think) and I went to bed.  I woke up and it was 11:00.  Eeek, we were meeting Laura and Luke for Darien Lake (well, not meeting them, getting a free ticket from their book) today and they would have already left.  So I called, made arrangements to meet them at the gate when we got there and we got ready to leave.  We packed up the car (I still have stuff at my mom's I keep bringing up with me each trip) and we headed back to my place.  We got here around 1, unpacked, got something to eat, and left for Darien Lake.  We got there around 3, met Laura and Luke and explored the park until late.  We had a lot of fun, rode Superman 5 times.  Laura and Luke left around 9 (they had been there around 12 hours) and we rode a couple more rides.  I won two gigantic snakes for the weight guessing game.  They always underguess my weight, which is great.  We ended up leaving, dropping by Burger King for dinner, then got gas for $1.95 off the Exit 48 offramp for the thruway.  We got back, I dropped Cindy off, Nola and I fell asleep.  She fell asleep about 2 hours after me, but thats just details.  I got up Monday, went to work and worked on DARS stuff for the morning.  I felt ill, asked to go home and I did.  However, I had a LONG meeting at the Towne House at 1 so I couldn't relax until after that was over.  It looks like DARS will be done in just a couple weeks.  I laid down for the rest of the afternoon.  Cindy came over for dinner and Nola's boyfriend Alex came over as well.  So we went to Raging Burrito (such a good place to eat) and had dinner.  We then went to the movies.  I had a headache through the entire thing, but we enjoyed "Stepford Wives" a very funny movie.  We got there 15 minutes late, but STILL before the movie started.  That's what I call timing. :)  We came back to the apartment and relaxed and watched TV.  Nola and Alex went for a walk and I fell asleep.  I awoke this morning to my infamous sore throat.  I usually only get it when I go my mother's home and come back... which I did this weekend.  Ugh.  So now I can hardly breathe and I have a headache.  I called in sick and have been just relaxing, taking medicine and drinking fluids.  I'm going to get a strep test later today.  I made Nola breakfast, mom is picking her up in a couple minutes.

      I don't know when I started defecating flowers, but it must have been when I stepped off that tiny plane at the Greater Rochester "International" Airport. Luke, Laura, and I went to the East End Festival. (East End? Like in London? Oh, that's right. Whenever I go to Downtown Rochester, it takes me right to London's East End.  Pip pip, cheerio, and all that rubbish .)  We visited Wayne (owner of Golden Port) at his stand. Laura bought some food and as usual, I ate free. Set up a man's overly complicated aquarium once and never pay for food again. Works for me.   We walked around and avoided some of Rochester's finest trash. Here is an excerpt of an actual conversation I had as we were leaving:   Man:  pssssssst  Me:  Oh, hey! (I actually knew him). You got your tooth back!  Man:  Yeah, I got it back nine months ago!  How exciting. This guy got his tooth back, and we were both so happy. [I slap my forehead as I reach for my customized tooth whitening trays]  I am a bad, horrible person. My formerly unspoiled unjudgemental friend (Luke) has become a snob, and I think it's all my fault. Now we both hate our not-white-enough teeth, our not-thin-enough bodies, and our not-long-enough hair.   Luke:  Now I know where all our weight went.  Wow. That was soooo bad. That's like the pot calling the kettle a snob. Seriously.  Vodka is my new boyfriend. Until the next one.

      Nobody deserves anything, that's my motto.  That's a little bleak in the world, but so much is 'unfair' in our lives that seriously, who decides who deserves something while another person does not?  Anyway... the gym was full and annoying, but I needed to go.  I eventually made my way home to find my cat had broken a dozen things in the apartment.  Cookie jar, glasses, refridgerator.  Well, not really, but she did break the cookie jar.  And I was going to make cookies some day!  But I made my way to Walmart since A) I had nothing better to do 2) I was out of good food III) I wanted soda, aka pop, aka diet coke  I picked up Cindy on the way back and we watched TV for the night, ranging from Newlyweds to HBO (which had a show about anal sex that was disturbing), Who's Line is it anyway?, Who's the boss? and so much more.  I took her home at midnight.  Cindy wants to go to my mom's tonight, tomorrow is my friend's wedding, then we're going to the casino.  Should be fun.

      Work was work, but Cindy and I walked back to my place after work.  Laura called and confirmed we were leaving and a couple minutes later (after Cindy prepared a meal for herself in the microwave) we left to get Linda.  Her new place is down on University and Goodman, a nice huge apartment complex.  We made our way to the inner loop, 490 and finally 390.  We traveled what seemed like 60 miles north to the lake, and we took exit 27b like the directions said.  However, we should have taken 27a and we ended up doing a U turn on a highway.  That was fun:  Luke: Hold on! Passengers: AAaaaAaAhaahhhhh!!!  Okay, maybe nobody was screaming or maybe I was screaming, I tend to forget.  But we got to the beach and Luke had already cooked the kabobs.  He put my hot dogs on and we ate great food and talked about a half hour.  We went and got ice cream (thanks Cindy!) and walked along the lake, eventually making our way back to where Linda was sitting and reading in the grass.  We played frisbee for awhile but Cindy wanted to go so she could do homework.   urlLink    Laura and Luke, cooking on the grill  urlLink    Laura choking Luke  urlLink    Me, from above, my best angle :)   Linda and I hung out for an hour, watched Newlyweds (such a funny show) and then I took her home.  She is deathly afraid of cats and would scream when Ashley would look at her.  I kept putting her in the other room but Linda said to let her in cause she was whining and scratching the door.  Blah.  That wasn't fun.  I came back, burned a couple DVDs, watched TV, cleaned a little and went to bed.  I woke up to a pile of garbage all over my doorstep.  Completely gross, it smelled and was nasty and wet.  Thanks whoever did that.  The entire day dragged on, but I managed I get quite a bit accomplished.  I'll have to tell you more later.  I'm really looking forward to this weekend, so much to do and Cindy is coming along.  She wants to meet my mother's horse.  Garry is out Friday and Monday.  It's nice when people take so much vacation.  I'm REALLY looking forward to my 2 weeks off in July.  I borrowed two more DVDs from the MMC.  Hopefully I won't run these over with my bike.  Oops.  The guy knows me by name since I go get DVDs every day now.    Ugh, I skipped the gym twice this week due to lunch dates and appointments.  I am going to go in a couple minutes to make up for it.  I don't like working out in the evenings.. it takes away from me time.  I'm so selfish.  Oh, and apparently monogamy is in our genes.   urlLink Click here.

      Cindykins works! It worked for me, I know it will work for you. Cindykins is a the new diet (this is the third year since the diet's birth) where one removes one's intake of carbohydrates. One also removes one's intake of proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, empty and not-so-empty calories. You might be saying, "Hey, isn't that unhealthy, not eating and all?" And I say to you, "Hey Fatso, what are  you  doing this Friday night?" Don't argue with results, people. Luke and I have been on Cindykins for a total of two days and he has lost 15 pounds and I have lost 4. To celebrate our weight loss, Luke, Laura, Linda, and another Luke and I went to the Lake today and ate steak, chicken, and Abbott's not-so-frozen custard. I felt out of place, as I was the only person in the party whose name did not begin with the letter 'L.'  Our picnic at the lake was excellent exercise in snobbery.   [Laura, cleaning up after our picnic.]  Laura:  Is there any more trash around here?  Me:  Are you kidding? They're everywhere!

      So tonight we're meeting at the lake to have a picnic and watch/listen to a concert.  Sounds like fun.  The blog post title is from when I asked Luke Osborne what the plan was for tonight.  Today I'm having lunch with my old boss. She's taking me to the Elmwood for helping her with code I wrote for her website last week.  Since payroll has changed for everyone starting next month, they needed a different way to report time in Facilities, and the script I wrote them last year needed some tweaking.  All I asked for was cookies.. but instead she is taking me to lunch.  I'll let ya know how it goes.  My meeting this morning to Helenwood Hall was moved without notice (to me).  Whoops.. luckily I don't have to go at 11 now, else I would have to cancel my lunch date.  Britney Spears has canceled her tour this Summer.  So she won't be coming to Darien Lake.  Shucks.  My eye is bothering me.  My toe is bothering me.  I'm a mess. Heh.

      Last night I was alone with the cat and the tv.  I realize I don't spend nearly enough time with the tv.  I am so far behind on all my tapings.  Today I awoke to a loss of 11 pounds.  I knew most of what I had gained before was water from Darien Lake and whatnot, but a day of fasting sure kicks things off.  I got 2 more DVDs out.  Only something like 30 to go.  Laura visited me at work, she brought a pamphlet for jobs in the DC area.  She's got my future all planned out. :)  We went back to my place and hung out until Cindy got done with work.  We then headed to a fabric store in Henrietta.  Cindy needed supplies, I needed material for a tablecloth.  Laura is sewing it for me.  All the while I was doing laundry at UR.  I've discovered my cat likes to break everything I own, walk on everything I have and eat anything I have in reach.  She also stinks to high heaven (her litter box) even though I clean it several times a week.  I think I need a new litter.  Several fish died today.  A shame really, but what did I expect with such a small tank.  Yes folks, I admit it, I have a small fish tank.   Cindy and I hung out forever and watched Footloose.  We're having a picnic tomorrow at the lake with Laura and Luke, so thats all good.  My aunt called and let me know that we're going to the casino on Saturday, a picnic for my cousin in 2 weeks and also going to the racino in Farmington a week from today.  Lots to do in the coming week.  Ont he way to drop Cindy off, we figured out how to lose 20 pounds for me and 40 pounds for Cindy.  We'll be cutting off limbs, shaving our hair off, donating as much blood as possible, and a cease of any food or drink.  Kidding of course, but it was a funny conversation:  Cindy: I could cut my breasts off. Luke: If you did that, even I'D lose weight. Audience: Hahahahaha.... (sigh)  Good night.

       1.  Luke and I are starving again. It was about damn time.   2.   I love New York? When I was making plans to leave for Rochester, NY (4 long wasted years ago) my friends immediately responded by saying "New York City?? That's great."  No. Not New York City. Rochester, NY.   Moi:  J'attendrai l'Universite de Rochester a New York.   Mon Ami:  New York?? Tres bien! Avec La Statue de la Liberte, n'est-ce pas?  Moi:  Non. Rochester.  Let's face it. There is only one city in New York state and the rest of the state is one big landing strip for jets. Which is why I did not understand why the City of Rochester was up in arms when the "I Love New York" tourism website failed to include a larger feature about the Fast Ferry. The boat is designed to get you OUT of Rochester. OUT. As in, OUT.   Visit Rochester! It's now even easier to leave!    Visit Rochester! We're just across the lake from a real city!   I'll stop there as I am stuck here until August. I don't know why I'm complaining so much. I've been having the most awesome time these last few weeks. Oh well. Stick to what you're good at, right?   3.  I think I registered for the wrong summer class. I don't remember "Stick-Up-Our-Pale-White-Asses 234" being in the summer bulletin. I am enrolled in a class of 7 people, 5 of whom are emotionless, humorless, witless, and might as well be dead. Thank goodness for Nose-Ring Matt. He is as off his rocker as I am and has an appreciation for the absurd. He sits next to me and will be my summer class buddy.    Me:  I used to smoke chicken.  Nose-ring Matt:  I used to smoke cloves.  Me:  That's cool. I use cloves in my cooking.  Nose-ring Matt:  I use chicken in my blunts.

      Wow, what a day.  The apartment is a mess after the breakfast fiasco yesterday.  I tried cleaning a little this morning but blah, I'll clean tonight.  So Cindy and I are on a blood-oath (well, more like an elbow promise in honor of Laura's sore elbow).  First day is always the most fun: no food.  Tomorrow we'll return to a much healthier eating pattern, well, at least I will.  Miss Cindy will eat anything I throw at her.. which will be much much less!  Plus we're going to the gym more often.  Maybe we'll go after work.  Sounds like a plan.  We'll keep you aprised of our progress.  Cindy gained 5 pounds and I gained 15 pounds since last week.  Hmm.. I wonder if its water weight. :)

      Sunday was fun.  I woke up early and went to Super Walmart to get supplies for breakfast and stuff for the day.  I spent about an hour shopping and called Cindy to let her know I would be coming in 15 minutes or so.  She said she'd need more time to get ready and so I simply went home and started cooking.  Laura came about an hour later and helped me cook.  We waited about 30 minutes for Cindy to show up but we started eating around 10:45 since we were leaving at 11.  Cindy called at 11 and asked me to pick her up, so I did, I went and got her, brought her back for a power breakfast and we were off for Darien Lake.  We spent a good 9 hours at Darien Lake, here are some pictures from our adventures.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      Superman was closed until late in the day but we managed to ride it once.  Cindy was nervous but she got through it.  Laura rode the Ferriswheel, she was nervous but she got through it.  All in all, a great day of rides.  We also ate at the Beaverlodge restaurant.  The chili was bad, but the onion rings were great.  Laura dropped us off, I dropped Cindy off, and I came back at hung out with the cat, played a computer game for awhile and then went to bed.  Blah. :)

      So Friday night was a blast.  Cindy and I went to some of her associates' house, who when we arrived, promptly went upstairs and smoked up.  I had a lovely conversation with the girl downstairs in her living room about Montreal, snow in the northern NY region and other fun things like relationships.  We all then went to Element and danced the night away.  I missed having Laura there, I enjoy dancing with her.  I was a designated driver, so I didn't drink.  I kinda wished I could drink, get drunk and have fun.  However, Cindy made fun of the way I dance and after awhile I just sat in the corner and waited for the night to end.  It did, but wait, we went to taco bell first.  The drunk guy in the backseat was really funny.  But then I dropped off people at the right houses and went back to my cat at my apartment.  It was 3am by the time I fell asleep and I wanted to get up at 7:30am to go garage sale-ing at 8.  Sadly, I awoke at 8am to my cell, a call from my sister.  They wanted to know where I was, since they were there and I was going to meet them.  Sigh.  So I went back to bed for awhile, then got up and let Cindy know I was picking her up shortly.  She didn't argue with that.  She was up way too early to have gone to bed, so I knew this was going to be a long day for her.  I don't know how she does it.  But we shopped from 9am to 3pm.  It was a lot of fun.  I bought a bunch of great stuff.  However, a couple items I wanted I couldn't get so I guess I'll have to keep my eye open.  Some items of interest: 40 AA batteried for $1.50  Clock radio for $1.  UPS power backup for $5.  A nice bike rack for $8.  A steal indeed.  Cindy and I both got burned a bit on the face and she got burned on her shoulders.  I stopped by Office Depot and picked up the blank DVDRs that Luke had got for me with his discount.  He bought me 50 for $40.  Not bad at all!  We came back to the apartment and watched TV forever.  Laura called and invited us to see Connie & Carla.  We went and saw it at Movies 10.  It was really good.  I'm amazed at how often I disagree with the movie critics on yahoo.com  The cat thinks my candy dish is her personal food bank. She keeps taking candy and playing with it all across the room.  She also has the awful habit of trying to eat anything anyone is eating.  Laura left, Cindy left to play with her drunk friends and I'm playing with the cat.  I'm making breakfast for everyone in the morning, plus we're going to Darien Lake all day tomorrow.  Should be fun!

      I am a Failure Insomniac Gardner. Unable to sleep before work, I do what any normal female building mechanic college student would do at 5 in the morning: I uprooted and repotted my basil plants. I wish I had real talent - like playing video games.  BECAUSE LUKE AND I DON'T SPEND ENOUGH TIME TOGETHER, we padded our slim and slick bodies with chicken wings and beverages d'alcool at Jeremiah's. We gathered a pack of Molson as a peace offering to Pablo Desayuno's house which led us to Element. Formerly  TILT , formerly Star Bar, now Element, it is a club that perturbed my small-town sensibilities.  Element is a sorrowful attempt at being a posh Manhattan-like club with anorexic waitresses and mirrors built into the bar table for one's snorting convenience. Smoke machines, bad techno, black walls, "L.A.S.E.R.S." and various screens showing random, non-sequential images of trees, colored paints, shadows, and death help to achieve the ambience and make one feel that the cocaine wasn't completely wasted.  Luke and I felt right at home!!! Hey, if I want to go clubbing in Manhattan, I'll go to Manhattan. This is Rochester, people. I want my cowboy hats, Rochester Red Wings jerseys  (there's nothing minor about it ), and rotten brown teeth.  I complain only because it's the only thing I know how to do. I actually had a great time, and Luke and I danced. We managed to include his new dance step "Fuck the Cow" somewhere in our combination.  side-side-back-front   It's 7am on Saturday and I have yet to sleep. Only one thing left to do. Two Words:   GARAGE SALES.

      McDonald's gets low-carb Coke.  What the hell?  It's called diet coke people.  It's been out for a decade.  Some of you know I have a 2nd job I work in my free time, completely related to the LAS website.  I've been writing a program for them to update the site completely.  Well, I am finally done with it for now.  It only took 8 months.  The next part will be another several month project and the third part is going to be a doozy.  http://www.rochester.edu/College/LAS/new_website  It's not live yet so nothing is correct.  All the coding is done and there is a lot of back end hidden menus for them to modify stuff.  Everything is customizable.  It feels good, every project I do I expand my abilities.  I could sell the coding I did here and make several thousand dollars.  Anyway, I went to a meeting to present it, and this is the 4th week in a row that we've been unable to have a meeting because they keep telling me Vicki is busy.  Well, at least I get paid to sit there. :)  I went to the multimedia center to get a couple DVDs for the weekend and I grabbed four thinking maybe during the summer they let people have more than two.  "How many can I get out?" Me "Two." Guy "Even in the Summer? For staff members?" Me "The students bought these movies.  You get two." Guy "I know who bought them, I went here for four years." Me  Suffice to say, what the hell was his problem?  He was olden than me.  And apparently nobody told him that Mr. Dowd pitched in a big chunk of money from the library fund to buy half the collection too.  So I have two movies for the weekend.  I used to own both of them before they were stolen, so I'm going to see if I can make a copy of them onto a blank DVD+R and if that works, I'll keep doing that.  I also signed up to the Walmart DVD renting club. It's free for 30 days, so I'll see if I like it.

      I attempted reading the journal entries of people I don't know as I have found strangers reading mine. I wanted to see if there was anything to it. There isn't. You people might lead more interesting lives than I do (who am I kidding? OF COURSE YOU DO!!) however, I find the accounts of other people's lives uninteresting unless I am involved.  There is an exception the rule: DANIEL REED. I love Dan Reed's Xanga. I love Dan Reed. I love his spew. I'm a sucker for smart witty guys who ignore me. http://www.xanga.com/danreed Enjoy (Cut and Paste if you have to, you lazy bastards) It will make you say "Hey, I hate that too!"  Dan Reed is full of hatred, which I find to be his most attractive quality. I need to make more hateful observations - they are so much more entertaining. So, here I go. I'll begin by listing all the tihngs I hate.  Hold on. I got a note from google.com. I'm limited to only 570 terrabytes. BLASTED!  Today, after being a lazy bastard at work, I made my travels with Luke & Laura to....where boys and girls?...that's right! WALMART. SUPERSIZED. McDonald's, too.   Bah da bop bop bah! You're getting fat!   We made goohuacamole! and marrrgarrritas! Laura got so drunk she started telling stories about this ancient mythological donut called "the dunking donut." Legend has it that this "donut" had a "handle" baked into "it" for "dunking" it into a "cup" of "coffee." Fucking loon.  Last night I went to Thirsty's, a bar for the Pittsford locals. I stood around holding a cup like a lame ass until I couldn't take it anymore. I don't see it, people. How do you guys do this year after year? So Marc and I bought some Ben & Jerry's and watched Army of Darkness in my room. Ah, the density. One of the many things I learned from Benny is that denser ice cream is better. And Benny knows about density. He is the densest person I know, and I'm completely in love. He's white, from New England, and tightly packed. Damn.  I cut my arm on Luke's screen door handle. I'm bloody. I'm watching my fat rat clean his foot. Life is good. What? No it isn't. I just like dirty rat feet.

      So today was a blast.  I'm still kinda buzzed from tonight.  Today was boring as usual.  I was sick most of the day, but I dealt.  Went to the gym, worked out, worked on some webpages in the afternoon and made last minute plans for a party tonight.  I got home at 5:10 and Laura arrived soon after.  We did laundry, dropped it off to dry it at UR, picked up Cindy and went to Super Walmart and McDonalds to pick up supplies.  We stopped by the liquor store and bought some tequila.  We came back and I started making guacamole.  Laura started helping, then Cindy started helping.  Luke got here and he started helping making the margaritas.  It made a lot...!  About as much as I had hoped.  Luke stretched it out a bit and it came out perfect.   urlLink    Luke making the drinks.  We drank, listened to music, played SPEED skip bo, which was kinda fun, danced a bit and Luke recorded us.  I just watched the video of us.  Oh my.  Yeah, we'll keep THAT under wraps.   urlLink    My distorted vision for most of the evening.  Cat is tired, I am tired, I'm going to bed.

      So the cable guy was an hour and a half late.  But now I have cable internet and so its all good.  Cindy and I made our daily trip to Walmart.  She had a huge list to buy and I had two items I needed.  I came back with 20 items and Cindy had less.  I need to stop going to Walmart.  Cindy got some Pelligrinos, I made some chicken patties.  We ate ice cream sandwhiches, oreo cookies and drank milk until the cows came home.  Well, 1am to be more exact.  We played skip bo in between.  I told Cindy we need Emily to come over to play with us.  Today was okay.  Stupid tour this morning.  I went to UR, I don't need to take a tour of the campus.  It was hot, I was sweaty and I wasn't feeling well.  But the day went pretty fast and I made plans to see Harry Potter with Linda.  So I rushed home at 5, got my car and went to pick her up at the MRB.  She was waiting inside the building while I was waiting in the circle.  He friend got in the car and we called Linda 3 times, but she wasn't answering.  We waited and waited and waited.  She finally came out and her explanation was "it didn't occur to me to come out".   Oooookay.   But the movie was terrific, it was over 2 hours long, but it felt like 10 minutes.  I'm watching Kathy Griffin on Bravo and the cat is attacking is attacking my feet.  Oi.

      Inside the hearts of all cats, inside their furry little bodies, is the den of all evil. Straight from the Devil's loins, they traverse the earth and our living rooms, spreading their demonic saliva, proving the irony of the human immune system. Living with a cat has inserted several phrases into my daily vernacular. The top 5 most common phrases I now use are:  1. Get off me! 2. Get out of there! 3. Stop drinking my milk! 4. Stop eating my food! 5. Where is my gun??  I hate cats.  Dearest Emily, I provide for you the essence of my date with Marc last week. What I can remember:  Thursday night, Mr. Marc picked me up from school and gave my friend, Dan Reed, (more on Reed later) a ride to the gas station. I made a poor decision and watched The Day Before Yesterday. I find dramas far too stressful. I cannot watch other people get hurt, unless it's Jim Carrey, only then from which I derive great pleasure. Not because he's funny, but because he's turned into an asshole. After the movie, he (Marc, not Jim Carrey) and I returned to his ginormous house in Pittsballs, I mean Crapford, I mean I HATE ROCHESTER. I enjoyed the opulence for a few hours and went home.  Do you ever hear the phrase "nice guys finish last?" Only "nice guys" say this, and it's usually in the middle of a really long boring story over some white-bread-and-mayonnaise dinner at Applebee's. Nice guys, with nice parents, from nice towns with nice cows are the inspiration of my new chart. In my chart, I compare my ideal man and everyone else. All examples are taken from my real relationships, specifically from both the drab and dreamy young men I have dated in the last two years. Click on the image for a closer read.   urlLink    Recipe For Success&nbsp; urlLink     The weekend was a jovial, drunken blur, spent with hippies and hippy associates. Friday, I went to Pablo Desayuno's house again, ran into Senor Alejandro Cross, then we went to Oxford's where he plied me with liquor. It was delicious. Saturday I went to Monsieur Nellis' improv show and I now regret not going to all of his past shows. Paul-hilarious. Paul's eyebrows-intense. Highlight of the night: (other than getting to sit next to Big Al) is getting up on stage and playing the part of Paul's date. Funny enough, I've thought about it before, but I never imagined it would happen on stage. I serenaded Big Al with an original love song "You are my little turtle" and he returned the favor by giving me the biggest bong hit in the world. I coughed so much I felt my ureters rocket through my womanly area and out of my body. They landed on the couch and now Big Al has a new scrunchy. Took the tour of the new hippy pad, all four minutes of it. Wouldn't be complete without a broken window, n'est-ce pas? Bam! Done and done!  I have learned to accept my transformation into white trash as an inevitability. So today, I skipped work, wore mismatched clothing, and headed to Walmart. Did I even brush my teeth today? I sink into my new Rochesterian identity without fear because I know in August, I will return to my city - a place where people know that guacamole is not supposed to look like green toothpaste and shouldn't come out of a gun.   Me:  There is a tombstone for a two-day old baby in this cemetery. It's not even worth it! A two-day old is just a clump of cells.  Luke:  You sound like an abortionist.  Me:  I give abortions to women who aren't even pregnant. That's how much of an abortionist I am.

      Cindy walked with me back home after work, which is where the title of the blog post came from.  We hung out and stopped by Wendy's to get a SPICY chicken sandwhich (no bun, no mayo, no lettuce, in a potato boat) for Cindy.  It came with lettuce, mayo and a potato boat.  We then headed to Jerimiah's, where my friend Katie works in the evenings.  I brought the laptop to get on the net there.  We were seated, but I accidentally confused the waiter guy and we were seated in the wrong section.  But Katie came to us anyway.  I couldn't get on the net, some network error.  I'll try again some other time.  Cindy got really sick, really fast.  I felt bad, so we went and picked up some alcohol and went back to the apartment.  Laura and Luke came over and we hung out until 10 or so.  Luke helped me install some software using his cell phone as a modem.  We walked around and detected wireless networks in the complex.  That was neat.  Cindy and I hung out, played card games, ate good food and eventually got some take out from the Distillery.  Cindy paid, she's so generous.  I ate wings, Cindy ate a pasta dish.  Around 2am, I took Cindy home, and fell asleep.  This morning I dropped by the eye doctor to pick up my contacts.  They didn't have them yet.  Arg.  I then dropped off the cable modem to Time Warner from the old apartment.  They're giving me a new one at the new apartment.  Don't ask why I didn't keep the same one, I'm cheating the company.  Garry asked me to bring my laptop in for the demonstration of the website during the meeting, so I went home at 1 and picked up the laptop and petted the cat.  Apartment smells funky.  Cindy needs to do some dishes.  Heh.  I also brought back a wireless adapted for the PC in my office so I could set up an ad hoc network so I can get wireless on my laptop in the whole building.  UR wireless doesn't come into Lattimore so during my meeting I would normally be screwed.  The meeting went well, Nancy put me in charge of the project, recurring weekly meetings and chose my committee.  Sounds professional.  Anesa and Emily also want to be on a subcommittee.  I suppose I'll find someone to be on a 3rd subsubcomittee. :)  I'm going home early for the Time Warner guy, who is coming any minute to the apartment.

      You know how hard it is to remember everything you did in the past 3 days.  Well, that's what I'm doing.  I've made notes and I'm going to attempt it.  On Friday I had a morning meeting in Helen Wood Hall over by the Med Center.  A nice long walk with Garry and Nancy.  We talked about a bunch of stuff and Garry had a story to tell.  After standing on my feel for what felt like hours, Garry told me I could sit down.  Cindy asked if we could go to Pelligrinos since she wasn't feeling good, so I said sure and we walked there for lunch.  I find that my dress shoes are not meant for walking.  My toes got so torn up by the walk that I had to walk barefoot on the way back because it hurt so much.  We got food and ate in my apartment.  I checked for mail and still didn't see anything, so when I got back to work I filled out the form at the USPS website to have it forwarded.  It cost $1 to do it online.  I later got home and found my mail had indeed started being forwarded and I wasted $1.  Shame.  That is useful laundry money.  Laura came and visited me at the end of my work and I convinced her to stay until 5.  Cindy came as well and we all decided to go back to my apartment and hang out for awhile.  I had a dinner date with mom, so although it was fun spending time with Laura, Cindy and eventually Jake, I kept watching the clock.  Laura left and Jake arrived a little bit later.  He was dropping off my shaving kit and contact solution that I left at the old place.  He, Cindy and I played Skip Bo for a little bit.  I told them I had to go, Cindy decided she wasn't going to come with me at the last minute and I headed to historic Canandaigua.  Jake and Cindy went to a movie.  Dinner with mom was fun.  I got to listen to a couple 911 calls, including a woman that was screaming that she was being attacked by a dog.  She kept getting disconnected.  These calls went on for almost an hour.  The hair was standing on end on my neck.  A deputy finally found her and we assumed she was dead.  But it turned out the dog wasn't attacking her, but humping her prized $1600 show dog, which was in heat.  Ha.  I sat with mom for two hours, we ate subs, talked, laughed, she gave me a bunch of fish from a former intern there and I went back to Rochester.  Jake was waiting at my parking lot, I called and invited Laura over (who was ready for bed at 10pm on a Friday night :) ) and we all hung out for awhile.  We then went to the Distillery, had some chicken wings, potato skins and drinks.  Laura went home and Jake and I went back to my place.  We talked for awhile, but he fell asleep on my floor even though the cat loves when people are within jumping distance.  Quote from Jake: No kitty.. stop it kitty!  Don't bite that!  Saturday came with an early vet appointment for the cat.  She got her stitches out and was felt up by the doctor.  She said she's a beautiful cat and is so friendly, and that's a good sign.  Afterward I dropped of the cat and went to Wegmans to buy some food.  I was just going to pick up some chili or something, but I got really disgusted at the price of everything I saw I left and went to Walmart.  I bought some soda, chips and headed home.  It's starting to be a problem, living so close to everything.  I can just get in the car and go.    I cleaned up the apartment for awhile, and watched a bunch of TV.  Cindy came over for awhile and we made plans to see an improv show that night.  Laura called and invited me to dinner with her parents, but they also wanted to drop by the Distillery first.  Cindy had just walked in so I invited Cindy to come with us to the Distillery.  We had Margaritas and watched the horse race really quickly.  I dropped Cindy off and went to Aja Noodle.  I had the Wok Fried Rice with egg rolls.  It was great, as always.  Very filling.  By the way, Laura's parents are looking very thin.  It's hard to recognize them when you remember them being heavier people.  They've accomplished a lot over the last couple of years.  I came back and Cindy and I went to the Elmwood for some drinks.  She bought wings and a pitcher of beer.  I tried the beer, I didn't like it, but I drank half of it anyway.  The wings were terrific.  We later went to the improv show at the Geva theatre.  It was extremely funny, Cindy even was invited up on stage and she was funny.  Lots of jokes, lots of innuendo.  Cindy went home with someone else, I went home and fell asleep after watching another couple hours of TV.  Exciting.  Sunday brought more cleaning.  My new couch was coming at 10:30 and my place was just very dirty.  I got the vacuum out and did some cleaning and Emily and her father came with Jesse.  We unloaded the truck and was it difficult to get into the apartment.  We had to take the door off the hinges and the feet off the couch just to get it wedged into the door.  Finally got it in and they were gone like the wind.  I couldn't even offer them a drink before they were ready to go.  Oh well, I had a couch to break in!  Cat loves the couch, by the way.  I'd love to say my day was exciting, however, I did laundry and went to UR to dry it.  Saved me $3, so why not.  I dropped it off and went to WalMart for my week's supply of food.  I spent an hour taking my time buying everything from meat to plates.  I got to the last part of my trip, the pet aisle and I was looking for food for the bottom feeders.  I found it, turned around and my cart was gone.  Someone took my cart full of food.  I looked every where for it, first thinking maybe I left it somewhere.  But they had left their cart behind, so I knew someone took it.  I went to customer service and asked them to announce it and ask anyone finding they had the wrong cart to return it to the pet department.  They refused.  They said "Just get another cart and shop again."  Imagine this in a true Rochester/Chili accent.  So I did, I went and got another cart and reshopped for all my previous items.  I get to the pet aisle to buy some kitten shampoo and low and behold someone brought my cart back (with a couple items they had picked up).  Ugh, I was disgusted.  Now I had two carts with the exact same stuff.  So I unshopped.  I returned one set of everything back to their shelves.  After my afternoon of FUN at WalMart, I got my laundry and sped home, vowing never ever to shop at WalMart again [today].  Cindy visited and stayed until 1am.  We watched TV, played Skip Bo, memory, washed the cat (she's so cute when she's wet), clipped her nails and fed her meat from Cindy's sub.  Well, she grabbed it and ran.   urlLink    My Cat is An Alien!  I biked to Kim's Asia (after getting lost on my way) and picked up some Sesame Tofu.  On my way, my handlebars got really loose and I almost fell off three times.  I took Cindy home after we debated whether she should stay or not.  This morning I awoke to a very disgusting fish tank.  The fish mom gave me from the other night are gross.  Their tank is murky already and it was fish poo everywhere.  Bowser never did that. Sheesh.  I went to work and visited Emily, who promptly asked Cindy and I to continue to blog.  She's interested in what we do. :)  I said hello to my other coworkers, several of which wouldn't give me the time of day.  I seem to be bothering them when I say hello in the morning.  What's that about?  I had lunch with Linda out on the quad, which was nice.  Birthday party with the Finance people at 1.  Not much going on, I need to finish this project for Nancy.  I'll blog later.  Tomorrow night I get internet!

      Walmart is the end all be all of apartment home furnishings.  Without it, I would have to shop at Target or worse yet, mall stores.  Yesterday after work, Cindy attempted to put my kitchen table together with Laura's drill.  The screws were too long and wouldn't screw in far enough.  One actually chipped the surface of the table.  So we made a list (including smaller screws) and went to Walmart.  Not that a list is of any use.  I didn't buy most of the items from the list, I bought them as I saw them and actually didn't buy several of the items on the list (who would buy a $12 bath rug?)  I bought cereal and milk for Cindy so she'd visit me more often (once a day for 5 hours isn't enough).  She promised to visit when she's hungry, though since I bought us some appetite suppressants, I don't think I'll be seeing her at all anymore.  One of the items I did not buy, a new bike seat, is sadly needed.  The current bike has a seat that wouldn't fit a 5 year old.  It hurts to sit on it.  However, despite Cindy's recommendation, I am not going to get the one that is 9 inches wide.  This one needs to be tightened, I feel like I'm going to fall off.  My birds tried unsuccessfully to hatch their 3 eggs last week.  So she laid 3 new ones, but they're also gone.  They got sick of the new ones too and threw them overboard.  I don't know whats wrong with them, no babies in ages.  Perhaps the cat is scaring them.  I dropped Cindy off and parked in front of the library around 10:30.  I downloaded my email on the laptop and surfed for a couple minutes then sped home.  Thursday came and I had an eye doctor appointment at 11:30.  The only issue with living close enough to use a bike is you have to bike home, grab the car, drive to the appointment, drive home, bike back to work.  I am dilated and can't see anything clearly that is less than 3 feet in front of my face.  I had to hold my keys out as far as I could to figure out which one was the one to my office.  Good news.. my eyes haven't changed perscriptions in 18 months.  A van honked at me several times while I was riding on the sidewalk. I don't know if I had a sign on my back or what, but they were definately trying to get my attention.  They also honked at me while I crossed in the crosswalk.  Why?  I haven't gotten any mail yet at the new apartment.  I don't understand, I filled out the address change form.  I usually get 3-4 things a day.  I filled it out again and submitted online.  Hopefully it'll work this time.  I don't know whats wrong, but I wonder what mail I've not gotten since the move.  Mom wants to have dinner tomorrow evening at her job.  She wants to give me new pet fish.  I suggested I bring Pelligrino subs.  We'll see.  Hopefully tonight will be calm, I'm tired.

      The only thing worse than a used car salesman is a new cell phone salesman. Tuesday night, Luke and I walked into the Verizon Wireless Store expecting to be helped by someone knowledgable about Verizon contracts and worthy of the air-conditioning and new carpeting. We were greeted by a greasy, spray-on-tanned, gum-smacking slime ball named Christo. Christo!! Jesus, even his name is greasy. Luke did his research before entering the store. It was obvious that Mr. Salesman did not. His slime oozed as freely as his ignorance.    Slimeball Sales Ass:  [smack smack smacking the gum] I've never heard of that plan. I don't know what I'm talking about, so I'll just keep on looking out the window and smacking my gum. Don't slip on my puddle of slime.  It was a most unsavory experience. Thank goodness I am too poor for a cell phone. Thank goodness I have no friends and no one to talk to so I don't need one.  BECAUSE LUKE AND I DON'T SPEND ENOUGH TIME TOGETHER, he and I  ONCE AGAIN (!!!) , destined to perish in the den of all evil, root of all sin and economic despair, went to the Super Walmart in Gates. God damn it, for the third day in a row.   Luke:  Where is the bike stuff?  Me:  The same place it was  yesterday  and the day before!  We spend so much time at Walmart, Luke and I are slowly becoming white trash. I feel my teeth rotting inside my head and an urge to procreate with a relative. I think I'll put on some Salsa music and read the New York Times just to feel better about myself.  I am looking forward to my date tomorrow. If things go well, there will NOT be a blog entry tomorrow night. tee hee.    Luke:   There are worse things than having The Distillery as a neighbor, including   not   having it as a neighbor.

      This is for Monday, the day I moved the majority of my furniture in the rain.  It sucked, a lot.  But I had Laura, Luke, Cindy, Nola and my mother to help. It went very smoothly.  We moved one load and then came back for a 2nd load with the truck.  The second time we came back and Laura, Cindy and Nola had cleaned the majority of the apartment.  It was sooooo nice to have so much help.  So we moved everything in and put everything away for the kitchen.  It looks really nice.  Laura and Cindy did a fantastic job organizing everything for me.  Luke started up the grill and we cooked hotdogs and hamburgers, had chips and soda.  Laura made cupcakes, so that was a great dessert.  We hung out for awhile, but mom and Nola finally left.  Laura, Luke, Cindy and I played Skip Bo for an hour, watched some TV, but Laura and Luke ended up leaving for the day.  Cindy and I hung out for awhile and watched TV, played with the cat, but eventually, the night came to an end and I dropped Cindy off.  I finished unpacking and went to bed, realizing I had to walk to work in the morning.  Tuesday came and it was nice to wake up at 8, shower, eat breakfast and do everything and still be to work at 9.  Well, I was a couple minutes late.  Work was blah, but we did go to a training session at 1pm for the new HR system.  That was boring too.  I looked into cell phone plans, made an appointment with the vet for the cat, and planned the evening.  So Cindy and I walked back to the apartment, which goes a lot faster when you have someone with you.  I just realized this daily recount of my life is really boring.  I need to do what Cindy does and only post funny highlights.  I'll start that for the next post, promise!  We headed to the Verizon Wireless store in Henrietta.  The guy was an absolute idiot.  He had no idea what I was talking about.  He didn't even know the name of their internet service.  I'm considering a cell phone with internet instead of cable internet, but they won't let me keep my FreeUp phone number.  It's impossible to port to their post-paid service.  WHAT!??  Why the heck not?  That turned me off real quick.  We left frustrated and hungry.  Especially hungry.  We headed to Wendy's, not to eat, but for Cindy to apply for a job.  But we got a Frosty too.  But the real gem of the evening was WalMart.  I needed a bike and a couple supplies that I didn't yet have (toothbrush, bike, shaving cream).  So I harassed Ryan, the Bike/Fish/Sporting departments guy (he looked 17).  But he was very polite and didn't get annoyed with our jokes.  I bought a nice $100 bike, a U lock and a bike cable.  One to secure the back tire, one to secure the front tire, bike frame to the bike rack. (By the way, securing it this morning was a pain in the butt.)  Getting the bike home was fun, the trunk was open, the bike was holding on with its own weight.  But we got it home and the kitten was happy to have something new to stand on, other than the bird cage of course.  We hung out, played Skip Bo, watched TV, and I returned my friend to her place of residence, only to get a phone call at midnight asking me how to get my laptop I lent her onto the ResNet internet.  That wasn't fun, I couldn't think I was half asleep.

      Because Luke and I don't spend enough time together, he and I ventured into the deep, dark, cavernous hell that is the Henrietta Walmart. He had to meet his $100 per day spending quota. He purchased a beautiful new bicycle and then made Ryan, the Walmart associate, really earn his money by discussing the 674 different configurations of a bike lock:   1. around the front tire and through the frame 2. around the back tire and through the frame 3. two times around the middle and through the front tire 4. around the river and through the woods, to grandmother's house he goes 5. around my neck six times and shoved in my eye 6-674. so on and so forth  Luke and I capped off the evening by sticking the cat in the refrigerator and playing a round of  Skip Bo!  Luke kicked my skip-bo-loving ass. Oh, yes. Mr. Fischer - cat lover - failed to notice that his new daughter, CindyVacaCat, took residence in the refrigerator when he had opened the door. Close, went the door and achoo, went the cat. I found her a few minutes later when I went looking for the jelly. I don't think that's what they mean by "Fresh Kitty."  I have a date for Thursday with Mr. Bilcultural Trilingual Med Student Piece of Meat. And so it begins....my summer dating routine. It's funny how I would trade a score a nice guys for just one asshole. The same way I would trade a thousand small towns for just one big city. Marc did everything right. Called before Wednesday for a weekend date. He is great. My mind, however, is always on someone else.  Lukey Luke Luke lent me his laptop to download songs for my the mp3 player ChrisSinclair gave me. I love the men in my life and their gadgets.  I met Christopher Michael Sinclair working at the Wendy's. I thought he was absolutely gorgeous and completely out of my league. (He is perfectly symmetrical.) Nine months later, we started dating and he became my significant other. It was the first time I had a boyfriend who was prettier than I was. Early in our relationship we stopped getting along and I sent him out of my room and out of my life. I vowed never to remain friends with any of my ex-boyfriends because keeping ex's around is always a bad idea. Congratulations Sinclair, you are the first exception to a very old rule.  I could never tell him that the reason our relationship didn't work is that my mind and my heart resided in a different place, a different house, a different relationship with a different person. Although he had no obligation to me, he would come to me and comfort me while my life was falling apart. We get along so much better now that we're not together. We talk on the phone every night. He's in Texas and I wish I were there. I miss you, Sinclair.   urlLink    Damn Sinclair - Damn Pretty&nbsp; urlLink

      This is a post for Sunday.  Laura and I headed to Lollipop Farm around 11:45 and we checked out the kittens.  I started the paperwork and was able to adopt a gray tiger kitten that day.  My landlord was a complete jerk and demanded I get a female, spayed declawed cat.  I got him to allow her claws.  He then promptly hung up on me.  I just wrote a huge blog post and realized I already posted Saturday's post.  A complete waste.  I was actually funny in this one.  We shopped at Petco in Pittsford, got a bunch of toys, came back to the apartment, played with the cat, put a couple things away and then I headed to Seneca Falls with the cat for my uncle's birthday.  The cat enjoys walking everywhere in the car while I drive.  She did finally fall asleep on my lap for most of the car ride.  The picnic was fun, the cat was a hit but I came back to Rochester and started a load of laundry.  The cat explored the apartment while I cleaned, put stuff away and then did 2 loads of laundry.  I had to go buy a sandwhich from Pelligrinos to get $3 in quarters.  I took the wet laundry and the dry cat to Cindy's to dry my clothes, for free.  The cat enjoyed Cindy's rats, Cindy enjoyed the cat.  Cindy gathered her laundry and we headed to my place to wash it.  While the clothes washed, we went to the Distillery and ate wings and Margaritas.  Lime ones to be exact.  There was salt on the glass and it got into my cut.  I think the cat cut me, I'm not sure.  After we left there we went to Super Walmart, by this time it was well after midnight and I was already getting tired.  We shopped for who knows how long, but after piling a million things into the cart, we checked out.  It came in just above $100, what I had guessed.  Cindy guessed closer to $150.  I dropped Cindy off at her dorm with all her clothes and I put all the food away (for the picnic) and made a simply blanket bed on the floor and the cat and I went to sleep.  She likes to sleep on my neck.

      Luke has helped me move places of residence a total of...uh...16 times in the last three years. I finally had the opportunity to help him for the first time today. The move went smoothly and we had a lovely barbecue at his new place. It was so great to be without those heinously rude, selfish, uptight, Elmyra roommates. I played with CindyVacaCat all night long and my allergic reactions were amusing. I am allergic to evil and that's why I try to avoid it. But CindyVacaCat is my new niece and the new daughter of my hero and I will take care of her as if she were my own dog.  Cindy "Call Me Cindy / Just Call Me Cynthia" Allen. She and I met sophmore year of college and we immediately got along because we're both nuts (in a completely non-violent manner). The two Cindys were inseparable for two years.  When Cindy loved me, everything was beautiful. Every hour was spent together...  Cindy #1 (Uno) and I discovered everything that Rochester had to offer. And because we were done by 8pm, we spent the rest of that day singing the theme song to Golden Girls, badly. We had many deep conversations about nature vs. nurture, as Uno is example #1 about defying environmental influences. She emerged a caring, open-minded, non-judgemental saint.  Cindy was my partner in crime and partner in life. My days were always filled with fun and love because she was there. She was selfless and allowed me to make my mistakes knowing that I would need her when I came back from ungodliness. And she was. Years Two and Three of college were fun because of you. I lived Years Two and Three because of you.   urlLink    Uno Y Dos&nbsp; urlLink

      Sunday began lazily, like all of my days. However this Sunday I was lazy in a 50,000 square foot house. Was it 50,000? I'm not sure, since I think anything above 500 feet is a waste. I had cereal and milk for breakfast - ahhh...another luxury I miss dearly. Milk leads to risky behavior. I took a nap after breakfast.  While I was enjoying being somewhere else for a while, Luke adopted a kitten (despite my assertions that cats are the devil's spawn) from Lollypop Farm. He brought the devil's spawn to my room late Sunday night and I enjoyed her company greatly. I insist her name should be CindyVacaCat, as she is just like me! She desperately needs Luke to feed her and take her places and she goes poop in a box in the corner. He wants to name her Ashley (VOMIT!) and Laura wants to name her Skip-Bo.  Skip Bo!   Benny called again, to console me on the bad news, I gather. Our conversations are funny. I tell him how devastatingly poor I am, and he tells me where his next leisurely vacation will be. Naivete and worldliness in one package - you can't ask me why I fell.  Life is full of humor. Luke and I did our laundry at his apartment complex where it costs $1.25 opposed to $2.00 here. And then we dry our clothes here free, opposed to $1.00 there. We save seventy-five cents per wash, and one dollar per dry. Then we went to Walmart and spent over $110 on who-knows-what. Well, I didn't spend anything. I just enjoyed watching Luke agonize over which trash receptacle to buy.    Luke:  Should I get the little white one, or the little white one?  When Luke gets very very tired, he regresses to his early childhood and his speech becomes almost unintelligible. So the above rumination went more like this:   Luke:  meh. mumah. nanana. plooofrf.  Needless to say, he got the little white one.  My soulmate of 13 years has now achieved her dreams. She now has a job where she wears a suit. In high school, someone asked Kim what she wanted to do with her life, what career interested her, what did she want to be. She said "I want to be a business woman so I can wear nice suits." My memory is impeccable and this is exactly what she said. Model/Actress/Astronaut and now, lawyer, my overachieving best friend just graduated law school with two degrees: masters in...uh...something smart, I'm sure. We met when we were 12 at Virgil Junior High School and our moment of bonding came in the form of our fanaticism for a horrible horrible band called "The Party," an offshoot of the New Mickey Mouse Club. Kim and I were total snots in junior high school and we continued to be snots throughout high school. But now, only she has the right to be one. I have become an underachieving loser and I respect that Kim still finds me interesting enough to call me her friend. My mind followed a dark path when I was sixteen. I hid from the world, and my best friend, for an entire year. And, as is my fashion, I emerged to find my true friend waiting for me. It was that year she introduced me to Sarah McLachlan. And you know the rest of   that   story.  Kim and her (my) parents save me from homelessness, and still have faith in me when my own genetic relations have failed to care. Kim and I are twins at the core, but I'm the  BAD  twin.   urlLink    My Overachieving Best Friend, Kim.&nbsp; urlLink

      Saturday, because Luke and I do not spend enough time together, along with Laura and her Luke, we went to...oh, about a million / million and a half garage sales in the Greater Rochester Area. We found miles and miles of baby clothes and incomplete dining sets. One woman was selling individual disposable baby diapers for a quarter a piece. I was without coin, so I couldn't take advantage of this incredible bargain. Garn! I guess I'll just have to go another day making that long trip to the bathroom.  That evening, I returned Mr. Trilingual Hunk's phone call and we headed off to a bar in Pittsford. Yipee. I won my first game of darts, and I had a good time trying to convince a very very drunk girl that I went to high school with her.    Me:  You don't remember me?   Drunk Girl:  blah blah blah  Me:  You don't recognize me because I use to bleach my hair and wear contacts!  Drunk Girl:  blah blah blah  Marc (trilingual, bicultural, medical student hunk) thought it was cruel and I stopped trying to convince the young woman I had attended Pittsford-Sutherland High School. Ick. How could I?   Drunk Girl:  What is your nationality? (my other favorite question of all time)  Me:  American. I was born in Los Angeles.  Drunk Girl:  Noooo! You are far too beautiful to be from America.  Me:  I agree with you completely. I like you, Lindsay.  Marc, most evidently, leads a very comfortable life. I have never been allowed to enter a house so gigantic without being paid to clean it first. My humble beginnings did not prepare me for his huge house. Before entering, I started to cry, wondering why my grandfather and my mother, who worked so very hard everyday of their lives, could never live in a decent house, could never own a car, never have a backyard, or even piece of mind. What does a rich boy think when his poor date starts crying at the disparity of their lives? I don't know and I don't care. The tour of the house took about one or two hours. Too many rooms, too many bathrooms - one huge jacuzzi.   Sheila Prakash Vakharia - Mother Theresa, and not just because she's Indian. My lovely Hindustani Princess, adored by all. Of all her fans, I had the honor of being her conjoined twin all year. We had a great time eating and watching Conan O'Brien. Because of her, I met a score of fabulous freshman, and gained a score of fabulous pounds. She endured my delusions of impossible relationships, and waited painfully while I sank into my diet of vodka and sleeping pills. Always there when I emerged from my regular excursions into hell, I couldn't express how much I admired her patience. I never use the word "friend" lightly, like many people who claim to have "a lot" of friends, because being a true friend is taxing, and being my friend, even more so.   urlLink    Princess Sheila & late minion, Rex.&nbsp; urlLink

      Many times, technology is not our friend. Through a series of many extraneous thumb movements, all my digital pictures have vanished - to be retaken and posted shortly.  This town is far, far too small. Because Luke and I don't spend enough time together, he and I took Laura to Golden Port. We followed our dinner at the best restaurant in Rochester with some fine, fine theatre: we watched 50 First Dates at the Movies 10 - the hub of Rochesterian culture. Later that evening, I had a little drinky drinky at Eric's house - a young man I had met at the hippy house. The house was full of Pittsford Sutherland graduates. Is there anything better than a house full of ignorant, rich trash? Yes. There is. There, I met a super cool medical student. We got along well and we went to many-a-bar and club. I impressed him with my uncanny rhythm and belly dancing. Thank you, Shakira. Phone number was asked and given, and shortly thereafter, called. One day, I will learn Arabic and take over the world.  Speaking of speaking Arabic, after frequenting des clubs, Mr. Pittsford Sutherland and I ate at Gitsi's and had our first real conversation of the night. He asked me my ethnicity - my favorite question of all time - and I wondered why I was getting along so well with someone from Rochester -- Pittsford, no less. (If I learned one thing in my four years in this dismal place, is how I should avoid speaking to anyone who is from this dismal place). Ahhh!!! HE'S LEBANESE! Too cool to be white, he is fluent in Arabic and French. Tu es tres cool, aussi!  Every day is an ode to Luke. He keeps me fat and happy. He saves me from loneliness and misery, starvation and boredom. He is the funniest person I know. His humor is absurd and incessant. Life without him wouldn't be a life at all. This is the third summer Luke and I have spent together, and every year gets better and better. Our first summer, we were both poor working students, obsessed with our lack of food and spending endless hours at the gym. Our days were filled with unbearable heat and unbearable calorie-counting. We both lost a ton of weight. We were starved and happy.  Our second summer was a blur to me. I had a huge monkey on my back. There was much liquor and involuntary expulsion of food. Luke watched as I ruined my life and esophageal lining with the patience of a saint. He isn't the only one, but he was the first one. He could have given up on me then, but didn't.  Summer #3. Yeah. We're having a great time and I have the waistline to show it - Luke has the credit card bills to show it. Mr Fischer is my hero, sacrificing all his time, money, and effort to keep me from jumping in the river. Luring me from the edge with his stabbing humor, I can only thank him for trying to save my life.   urlLink    Starved Yet Happy Luke&nbsp; urlLink

      So I was reading this article about cats and the problems that arise when you start a relationship with someone and the cat gets jealous.  I think that's funny, my cat loves new people, she wouldn't get jealous.  But what struck me was the following statement from the article:   And pets can have a serious impact on a relationship. "Seventy percent of people asked to choose between their spouse and their dog will choose the dog," he adds.   Can you imagine?  How awful.  My cat has been destructive lately and she only seems to be getting worse.  I come home to plants on the floor with dirt everywhere.  I have a lovely houseplant that is shredded to bits.  It's 3 years old and she's killing it.  She's not even 3 months!  She has been chewing on my blinds and recently broke 3 of the blind flaps completely in half.  So my blinds look like crap now.  Yesterday I walked into my room when I heard struggling (I thought she was bothering the bird.)  No, she was tangled up in 3 strings for the blinds.  She's lucky she didn't fall off the shelf and hang herself!  Cats.  Sheesh.

      Friday, they all enjoyed my cupcakes.&nbsp; I made 29 in all and all were eaten by the end of the day.&nbsp; Friday night, Laura, Cindy and I went to East End fest, got a great meal at Golden Port and then went to an Improv comedy show at the Geva theatre.&nbsp; It's the same one we went to a month ago and it was still very funny.&nbsp; We enjoyed ourselves.&nbsp; Laura went home, Cindy and I hung out for awhile.   Saturday Cindy slept in all day while Laura and I went to Darien Lake.&nbsp; We had a lot of fun, did all the major rides, however, the park was packed and we didn't do everything.&nbsp; It's okay, we'll do more again.   Sunday, Laura and I went and saw '13 Going on 30' which was a funny movie, cute and romantic, kinda.&nbsp; We then went shopping in Henrietta, went to a card shop, dollar store, D&K store, Brueggers, Best Buy and finally Target to buy some gifts for the wedding we're going to on Saturday.&nbsp; I had been cooking stuff in the crockpot all day, so when we got done shopping around 5, we came back, I picked up Cindy and we all ate spaghetti and turkey meatballs.   Both of them left, and the cat and I hung out and watched TV and whatnot.   Monday was nice.&nbsp; Work was blah, but Linda met me at my office at 5 and we walked back to my apartment.&nbsp; My bike chain broke while we were walking (ugh!) but that didn't deter us.&nbsp; We went to TGIFridays and had dinner.&nbsp; I got my new Goldpoints card, we got some free food and once done, we went to movies 10 and watched Van Helsing.&nbsp; It was a good movie!&nbsp; Surprisingly... Cindy hated it when she saw the first 5 minutes, but after that gets done, I enjoyed it.&nbsp; Some parts were weird, but whatever, sometimes you just have to sit back and enjoy the action.   I got back and Cindy and the cat were watching TV.&nbsp; We hung out, but I took Cindy back after she needed to get back and read for her class.   Today, Tuesday, was pretty much a repeat of Monday.&nbsp; Work was blah, but this time I had to walk to work.&nbsp; It was sprinkling, but that wasn't bad.&nbsp; Gym at lunch, as usual.&nbsp; We had a cake party for JB (coworker) and Lisa (finance) at 4.&nbsp; After work, it was pouring rain, so I hitched a ride with Donna (coworker) back to my place.&nbsp; I was a little late and I was meeting Laura at TGIFridays at 5:40, so I was basically late then and there.&nbsp; I got there, we had a wonderful meal and when the bill came, my portion was $2.50.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; So I left $7 and split to go pick Linda up for the free movie.&nbsp; All three of us were seeing "The Manchurian Candidate"   Well, Laura went and got us seats and I hurriedly picked Linda up across town.&nbsp; We got to Regal Henrietta by 7:10, but tons of people were being turned away from the movie.&nbsp; "Sold out!" they screamed as they stomped away.&nbsp; Uh oh.   I called Laura.&nbsp; She was saving 3 seats, so I went in to get through the gate, the guy said the movie was full, I explained the woman I was on the phone with was holding 3 seats for us.&nbsp; He escorted me in, we saw Laura, he let us in.   The movie was good... it was a typical war movie / political movie.&nbsp; I liked it, it was weird at times, but the jokes Laura and I said during the movie made it better.&nbsp; However, I think Laura is right.&nbsp; If we were ever in a comedy troupe, nobody would laugh at our jokes. :)   Linda and I stopped at Krispe Kreme, we got a free donut, a cold drink and I dropped her off.&nbsp; Cindy texted me, she needs&nbsp;a new phone cord, rats chewed her old one.  Okay, now I'm alone in my apartment, watching the Democratic Convention and I need to go bed.

      Wednesday my mother called and let me know that we were having another picnic at my grandmother's since my other uncle and his wife were in town.&nbsp; At lunch I worked out at the gym and after work Cindy and I went to my grandma's after I burned a CD with a slideshow of the pictures from our vacation.   The food was okay, there was Earthquake cake for dessert (which had coconut, yuck).&nbsp; The conversation kinda turned political with people complaining about people who criticize Bush.&nbsp; I just kept my mouth shut, a lot of them don't realize how uninformed they are, but I correct people too much, so I'm trying to make a habit of stopping.   Then Cindy and I arrived back, we watched Newlyweds, then went to Tops for conditioner, I dropped her and the rats off at her dorm and went to bed.   Thursday was fun.&nbsp; Laura stopped by around 3:30 after work and we made plans to go to Dashen Ethiopian food and watch a movie at Movies 10.&nbsp; We did.&nbsp; Our waitress was kinda non-English speaking, which was fine, except I wanted BREAD and she only heard WATER.&nbsp; I needed water too. :)   We wanted to see Man on Fire, but we ended up seeing Day After Tomorrow since we were 15 minutes late to Man on Fire.&nbsp; But DAT ended up being a decent movie.&nbsp; Lots of scenes were good, the graphics were good and we laughed since the President and Vice President reminded us of Bush and Cheyney.   Laura dropped me off and I came back to find Cindy on my couch, a nice surprise.&nbsp; We watched TV for a while, then went to Tops (our new favorite place) to buy some supplies.&nbsp; I needed to make cupcakes for the coworkers Friday and I had a coupon for the boxed mix.&nbsp; I asked Cindy if I had any eggs in the fridge and see promptly said she saw a carton of a dozen.   I dropped her off and came back to find no eggs in the fridge.&nbsp; Dang!&nbsp; So instead of buying them then, I got up early in the morning, drove the Tops, bought some eggs, came back, baked 29 cupcakes and furiously rode to work to deliver them.   They are good!&nbsp; Everyone enjoyed them.

      Well, the plane left Ontario on time, we got to St. Paul, went right to our gate, got on the plane at noon, but were asked to deplane and we had to wait 30 minutes.&nbsp; We got back on the plane, and we taxied for an hour.&nbsp; So we were really late,Iwe got in around 10:45, rather than 9:50.   Cindy was at the airport, been there since 10:30, so she didn't have to wait very long.&nbsp; She was helping a French couple, since nobody else in the airport spoke French.&nbsp; We got our bags, went back to my place and Nola and mom went home.&nbsp; I have rats in my apartment now, Cindy's pet rats.&nbsp; They sqeek a lot.   Monday was a nice day.&nbsp; I got up at 10am and went to the bank to fix an error in a credit card payment.&nbsp; I accidentally paid off my credit card from the wrong bank account, so my account went negative (since I don't use this other bank account).&nbsp; So I got it fixed and went to the mall to return a pair of shorts I bought for my trip, but they neglected to remove the security tag.&nbsp; I went to BJs, got a trial membership (though I'm prolly going to get a real 15 month membership with Laura this or next week).&nbsp; I bought 15 gallons of spaghetti sauce, some cereal and other stuff.&nbsp; I went to Walmart, got the rest of my needed supplies and came back to the apartment.   Cindy was reading and we just hung out for a bit.&nbsp; I called Laura and asked her to come to my place after she got out of work, and she did.&nbsp; I gave her some stuff and invited her to go to my grandmother's for a picnic.&nbsp; We left around 5 after dropping Cindy off and spent the evening with my uncles, aunts, grandmother and family.&nbsp; My uncle, his wife and their kids are up from South Carolina for the week.&nbsp; It was nice to see them again.&nbsp; We had a lot of Italian food (none of us are Italian) and had a great truffle for dessert.   We came back to Rochester, Laura went home and the cat and I fell asleep around 11.&nbsp; I had a weird dream about something trying to choke me and I woke up when I threw the cat off my neck.&nbsp; Whoops!&nbsp; She promptly came back anyway. :)   Tuesday was pretty lame, but after work I worked out at the gym for an hour.&nbsp; I decided to start a new gym routine to see if it works.&nbsp; Walk an hour for lunch, Work out an hour after work, eat 2,000 calories a day.&nbsp; Hopefully I can lose this darn weight once and for all.&nbsp; My pants are tight again and I refuse to buy bigger clothes when I know that I used to fit into one size smaller!  Cindy and I hung out at the apartment, I did laundry and we watched a lot of reality tv last night.&nbsp; Everything from "Trading Spouses" to "America's Next Top Model"&nbsp; It was interested and I think they have us hooked.&nbsp; I hate loving tv... I feel like I should be doing something else!

      So this morning was quite a ride.&nbsp; Nola and I couldn't get back to sleep until around 5 or 5:30.&nbsp; See, I accomplished what I said I would.. I have completely reversed my sleeping schedule.&nbsp; 5am Pacific is 8am Eastern, when I normally wake up every day.  &nbsp;  So I took a couple pictures this morning, one of the window that Danny broke last night and got cut on.&nbsp; I decided not to post the inside shots of where he bled all over to save all our stomachs from churning.&nbsp; I found out more about what happened.  &nbsp;  Danny sleepwalks and tends to hurt himself by breaking through windows.&nbsp; He was sleeping in the garage last night and woke up and tried to get out... through a window that was paned, so he broke part of the window, climbed over a bunch of junk, cut himself really bad and then came back into the garage asking for help.  &nbsp;   urlLink    Bloody Broken Window   On Friday, we stopped by Aaron's school where he is a PE teacher to drop off some paperwork.&nbsp; Mom asked me to take a picture of the kids sitting on the school sign.&nbsp; I felt kinda like a stalker.  &nbsp;   urlLink    The school Aaron teaches at    urlLink    Nola and Aaron by Aaron's car packing to leave.&nbsp; We left the house around 9, got to Denny's around 9:10, ate breakfast, and then got to the airport around 10.&nbsp; Our flight leaves at noon, and haha! they have wireless internet in the waiting areas.  &nbsp;  Talk to you soon. :)

      So both Friday and Saturday we basically went to malls and shopped.&nbsp; Got to get in the traditional mall.&nbsp; Well, California does malls very big.&nbsp; We went to Tyler Mall on Friday, which was a two story mall.&nbsp; We shopped for 3-4 hours.&nbsp; Once we finished, we went to a little Mexican restaurant, where they spoke rough English, and had a great meal.&nbsp; My sister got a burger. I got a burrito, chips and guacamole. &nbsp;  On Saturday, we went to Ontario Mills mall, one of the larger malls on the West Coast, which is funny, because Ontario has 3 things: an airport, a mall and an industrial complex.&nbsp; We went to the mall, which was a HUGE square seemingly endless row of stores.&nbsp; We shopped for several hours, Aaron and Nola got a bunch of great stuff and we headed home.  &nbsp;  Aaron cooked another great meal (steak &amp;&nbsp;veggies) and we ate and hung out until around 1am.&nbsp; Now you may be wondering why I'm up right now, only 2 hours after falling asleep.&nbsp; About 30 minutes ago, I awoke to the sound of glass breaking.&nbsp; I heard something outside like someone climbing and breaking plants.&nbsp; I got up and looked out the window but didn't see anything, but was going to wake Aaron up because it freaked me out that someone was outside on the roof or something.  &nbsp;  Then I heard someone fall and scream 'Help!'&nbsp; That freaked me out and I headed to the garage where I heard the&nbsp;noise.&nbsp; Danny, the brother of Aaron's room mate Kenny, was bleeding profusely and was clutching his arms.&nbsp; He was dripping blood and his clothes were covered.  &nbsp;  I went and woke up Mom, a 911 dispatcher and expert at this kind of thing and she came down and started helping him.&nbsp; I woke Aaron up, who looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language (maybe I was, I just woke up), but Mom told Aaron that Danny needed to go to the hospital, so he woke Theresa (Danny's girlfriend)&nbsp;up who got her car ready.&nbsp; Danny had tried to wake up Kenny, but Kenny seems to sleep hard and Danny didn't have much strength when he knocked on Kenny's door.&nbsp; So Danny, mom, Theresa and Aaron all went to the hospital.&nbsp; The blood stains, puddles of blood, broken window and everything looks like, as Nola said, a murder scene.  &nbsp;  Nola and I are sitting here now, fully awake and unable to fall back asleep, watching TV.&nbsp; I woke up Kenny (Danny's brother)&nbsp;when Theresa called and Kenny and his girlfriend went to the hospital too.&nbsp; I have honestly never seen so much blood outside of a movie.&nbsp; We'll see if mom and Aaron are still up for breakfast in a couple hours.&nbsp; I'd post some pictures, but I dunno if that is appropriate.

      So we had quite the day on Thursday.&nbsp; We all went to a beach called Huntington Beach, a little south of Los Angeles.&nbsp; It's a beautiful little city and we parked on a city street and walked to the beach.&nbsp; The water was warm!&nbsp; The waves were terrific... big, salty and fun.  &nbsp;  We swam&nbsp;for an hour... then we laid on the beach for an hour... swam for an hour... sat on the beach for an hour.&nbsp; Once we finished that, we went to a Mexican bar in the city and had drinks and free burritos (happy hour).&nbsp; Ick, the margaritas weren't as good as I was hoping.&nbsp; We ate chips with really spicey salsa (I was longing for some guacamole).  &nbsp;  We headed to Long Beach where Aaron's friend (who got us all those free tickets) lives.&nbsp; Her name is Frances, she lives in a beautiful apartment.&nbsp; We went to a nice Chinese Wokery, ate lots of white-people food (they didn't have any dim sum or good vegetarian dishes).&nbsp; We took some nice pictures and headed home.  &nbsp;  We hung out for awhile here, they all drank, I fell asleep after losing a game of pool around midnight.  &nbsp;   urlLink     Huntington Beach    urlLink     Eating Mexican    urlLink     Mom &amp; I after eating Chinese Food   &nbsp;  Today we're going to the Ontario mall and shopping for a bit.&nbsp; We're getting a later and later start every day.&nbsp; By the time we leave, we won't be getting up until 5pm.&nbsp; Sheesh :)

      Wednesday, we went to Venice Beach.  It took about an hour to get there and it was a fun day.  We got a late start, since we stayed up so late the night before, but we got there around 3, walked the strip (a bunch of businesses selling stuff for cheap) and I got a 99 cent piece of pizza, a $3 bag of fresh kettle corn and I bought a keychain.  We laid on the beach for a couple hours but then headed home.  Traffic was awful and it took 2.5 hours to travel 60 miles.  Wow.  Here are a couple pictures.   urlLink    Venice Beach Strip   urlLink    Venice Beach  We got back to the house, watched Starskey & Hutch (a week earlier on DVD than anyone else ;) ) and then went to bed.  Tiring day for sure.

      So after dinner we stayed up REALLY late (well, for them its standard practice) and played pool, drank, listened to music and just hung out.  It was nice.  Aaron & Billy get funny when they drink.  Better than getting scary I say.   urlLink    Playing Pool   urlLink    Party at the House  I'm curious when I'm going to bed, I'm not tired yet.

      So we got up really early (9:15am) and got right into the hot tub.  Stayed in there for awhile, took our showers and went to a waffle shack for breakfast.  Expensive!  2 pancakes were $5.99.  Oi.  I got a turkey club.  We got to the San Diego Seaworld around 12, got our free tickets (I love getting everything free!) and went in.  It was a big park.  We walked around and looked at some of the animals.  Unfortunately, it felt like a zoo, again, so I was sorta disinterested in the information they were giving.    But we got to see a show with sealions, seals, whales, more whales and more animals that live in water.  I got to hold a starfish, feel thirsty all day long (no way was I buying a $6 soda) and take some good pictures.  We went through a shark exhibit, which was really cool.  We went through a tunnel under the tank, so we got to see under the sharks.  Big and impressive teeth.   urlLink    Nola Holding Starfish   urlLink    Shamu the Whale   urlLink    Lovely me waiting for Mom to buy Molly's gift   urlLink    I'm a polar bear!   urlLink    Nola, Aaron & I in front of the ocean  Nola wasn't feeling well, so we planned to leave a little early.  We left around 7 or so, got home around 9.  We stopped at a grocery store and picked up dinner.  Aaron cooked chicken, I made guacamole dip again, and Nola made brownies.  A good dinner.  I'm getting used to staying up late (check the time this was posted).  This isn't good, vacation ends in 5 or so days and I only have a day to catch up!  Make sure you check the below post so you don't miss any details.. I posted several things tonight.

      On Monday, we went to San Diego and went to the 'World Famous Zoo'  You cannot believe this place, it's huge!  It took us hours and hours and hours and we didn't get to see everything.  Nor did we want to see it all.  I'm not really impressed by large zoos any more than I am impressed by large amusement parks.  Size doesn't matter, right folks?  Anyway, once we walked the zoo, rode the bus tour, rode the sky ferry and drank our 15th free refill on our $8 soda souvenir cup, we decided to leave and get to our hotel by 8.   urlLink    Family Entering Zoo   urlLink    Mom & I, with Aaron smiling behind us   urlLink    My Favorite Animal  We stayed at a place called King's Inn in Hotel Circle.  It had a pool (good) and a hot tub (the real reason we stayed there) and the rate was great.  We got there, checked in, put down our stuff, immediately changed and all got into the hot tub.  After 30 minutes, we only left to eat pizza and wings for dinner.  It was 10pm, we were exhausted, and all went to bed.

      So Sunday was Aaron's baseball game.  It was over 98 degrees and I was hot in the shade.. I couldn't imagine how it was for Aaron.  They lost the game.. the ump was a jerk, but it was entertaining at the very least.   urlLink    Aaron At Bat   urlLink    Aaron in a pickle...   urlLink    Nola, Bobby and I watching the game   urlLink    Aaron & Mom  After that, we came back to Riverside.  Bobby took us to a fastfood restaurant called 'In and Out' which surprisingly was VERY good.  They have 3 menu options, but they are very accomadating.  We hung out at the house for awhile until we left for Billy and Bobby's parent's house.  They live in a really nice neighborhood on top of this moutain.  They have this mineral water pool and this amazing house.  They cooked us a 6 course meal, which included tortilla chips and salsa from a local mexican restaurant (way too hot for me) and then cheeses and dip on crackers.. then seafood, a vegetable salad, garlic potatoes, steak and asparagus.  So much food.. I couldn't eat everything.  They also had this barrel of drinks.. I don't think I've drank that many calories in my life.  It was great, we got home around 1:30 am here, 4:30 back home.  Oi!   urlLink    Nola & I in the mineral pool

      So Saturday was Beach Day.  We went to Aliso Beach, which Cindy said was an upscale beach (what does that mean?)  All I know is the water was wonderful, the people were few, the sand was white and brown and the sun was perfect.  We spent from around 1 to 5:30 there.  It's funny, each day we wake up around 9, which is noon EST, and we're getting used to it.  I always feel like we're wasting half the day, but then we stay out really late so it makes up for it.  We all got really tanned.  Aaron and Nola got really beat up in the surf, apparently they were the biggest waves my brother and his friends have seen that year.  We saw dolphins out in the water about 30 feet, which was really cool.  We played volleyball, Nola Aaron and Billy played frisbee.  There were planes and helicopters flying overhead with advertisements in pull for TV shows and movies.  It's funny, in California, it seems all the ads are for Hollywood productions.  Last night we just hung out.  A ton of people came over drinking and whatnot, but by 11pm PST, we were dead tired and we went to bed, but the party continued downstairs.  This morning Billy's brother Bobby got Krispy Kreme donuts for breakfast and Mom and Aaron went to the game.  Billy, Bobby, Nola and I are joining them in a couple hours.   Here are some pictures of our adventure...   urlLink    Volleyball on the Beach   urlLink    Aaron, me and Billy   urlLink    Aliso Beach   urlLink    Watching the Dolphins

      So we went to Universal Studios for the day, which was a lot of fun.  Aaron's friend got up VIP front of the line season passes, which was awesome.  We never had to wait more than 5 minutes for any ride.  The wait for food was the longest wait for anything.. which was funny.  I kept trying to flash my VIP pass to get through that line :)  We got home and I watched the new season premier of Stargate SG1, a great show.  Today we're off to the beach for the whole day... haha!  I'm gonna get tanned.  Below are some pictures of our trip yesterday.   urlLink    Wooly Mammoth on the Mountain  urlLink    Family in Front of Universal Globe  urlLink    Mom and I on the Studio Tour  urlLink    Me going down the escalator  urlLink    Waterworld Live Show

      Well, we got to Hollywood and walked the Walk of Stars.  I got a lot of great pictures of the stars for the people I like the most, plus we were able to see where Cindy is going to live in a couple months.  LA is huge.  It doesn't make sense to have a city that takes over an hour to get through and you're still only half way through it.  We got free Sierra Mist that was being handed out.  We got to see On Air with Ryan Seacrest.  We saw the Chinese theatre and went through Ripley's Believe it or Not.  Once we finished that, we finished the walk and went to McDonalds for dinner.   urlLink    Me in front of Gene Roddenberry's Star  We drove to Dodger's Stadium and watched the game.  A lot of great catches and slides and everything within our view.  It was great.  We got home around midnight here, 3am in NY.  Very tiring.   urlLink    LA Traffic Is Busy!   urlLink    Aaron, Nola and I at Dodger's Stadium  We're about to leave for Universal Studios, I'm looking forward to it.

      So after staying up really late EST, we all went to bed and slept in really late.  Mom and I went for a run around a couple blocks and came back and got ready.  It's 11:27 now and we're off to Hollywood and a Dodgers game.  Should be fun.  I took a picture of Aaron's house in Riverside:   urlLink     And I also took a picture of the view behind Aaron's house, which is a huge sand pit.   urlLink     I'll let you know how my day went when we get back. :)

      So we left my place at 5:00 to make the 6:45 plane.  Security was awful but I think we got everything.  I realized I left my sunglasses, whoops!  Cindy made a quick trip back to get my cell phone... a very important thing.  Thanks Cindy.  We changed planes in St. Paul MN.  We got off, walked right to the new gate and had to get right on.  Talk about timing.  While walking, I quickly got some McDonalds, but this McDonalds put egg in their burrito (maybe all do), so I ended up giving it to my mom and Nola.  They like egg.  We got to CA by 2:00pm EST, 11am PST.  We waited for about 30 minutes for our backage, but Aaron was on time and we went right to his house.  Wow.. what a house.  It's huge.. has 3 living areas and 5 bedrooms.  It has an amazing back yard and view and guess what... someone has an unsecured internet wireless AP next door!  So free internet for me.  We went grocery shopping, mom bought it all (with objections from Nola, Aaron and I) and got enough food to last us 2 weeks.  We're making dinner right now.. chicken bbq, grilled vegies and salads.  I made some guacamole dip and we're snacking.  Mom is napping until dinner.  I'll post later. :)

      Sunday was a lazy day.  Cindy and I vegged ALL day and watched TV.  I only left to get food.  Once to get bagels, once to get McDonalds, once to get ice cream.  It was one of the best days I've had in a long time.  It was nice to relax.  Monday was almost a repeat of Sunday!  Amazing.  Laura came over in the evening to visit Cindy and I, watch TV and whatnot and I planned for my trip.  Cindy did some dishes, I cleaned up a little.  Tuesday was a good day.  I had a blowout meeting in the morning (they canceled without telling me) and I felt rushed in the afternoon.  Prolly because I took a 75 minute lunch.  Those extra 15 minutes are important.  I demonstrated the website to Nancy at 3:30 and by 4 I was cleaning my office.  I left at 4:30, rushed home, changed and took Ashley to the vet for her rabbies shot.  We got there 15 minutes late, but they took her anyway.  We came back and I left to get Laura for our shopping spree.  We went to Old Navy, I tried on some board shorts and some swim trunks.  I ended up buying a red and black pair of board shorts.  We went to the mall and checked out Express for men, I bought a couple pairs of summer shorts, then we went to Walmart and got supplies (and a couple shirts).  We stopped by McDonalds, picked up some food for Cindy and then went to pick her up.  We came back, Laura did a fashion show with the old clothes Cindy does not wear anymore.  I cleaned, packed, did laundry and relaxed for the evening.  My mother and sister get here at 4:30am, so I need to get to bed.  Wish me luck, we fly out in a couple hours.

      Cindy and I went to Golden Port for dinner, I'm not remembering anything exciting that happened.  Afterward Cindy bought some beer and vodka and headed to the hippies house.  I hung out with the cat and had a quiet Friday night.  I took some garbage out to the dumpster and I saw the stairstepper that had been there for over a week.  So I got on it thinking I could perhaps use it if there wasn't anything wrong with it.  I went inside to get a flashlight to check it out further and when I came back outside, it was gone.  Not moved, not thrown out.. it was gone!  Within 2 minutes.  That's crazy.  Saturday I woke up late and cleaned a bit before Cindy and I headed to my grandmother's place for a 4th of July picnic.  We got there around 4 and stayed until 8.  We went to the Outlets and shopped for awhile.  I got a shirt, pants and shorts for my trip.  We came back to Rochester, Cindy got her alcohol and we drank the night away.  Alison came over and stayed until 1:30 or so.  Cindy spent most of the night on the floor.  It was fun.

      So, Laura has offered to take care of my plants and car while I'm on vacation.  She absolutely refuses to take care of the cat... :)  Well, she meant cat and not car, but she can take care of my car if she wants.  On the way to pick Linda up for Golden Port, I saw one of my pet peeves, people who smoke in the cars with their kids in the back.  I looked in the rear-view mirror and she was puffing and blowing with her baby in the back.  Absolutely awful.  So my cat IMs people randomly, so what.  She likes you and she wants to talk to you.  What?  You haven't been IMed?  Well, that's just because she doesn't like you.  I got into my apartment and I noticed the cat on the top shelf of my closet.  It's 7 feet in the air, how she got up there is impossible.  I hope I don't come home sometime to ripped up clothes just so she could get to the top.  At Golden Port, I dined a fine meal with 50 Indians.  Sheila and Dimple's Indian camp couselors all came to Golden Port for dinner.  It was quite packed, but luckily, our food came out first while some people didn't get their food for 45 minutes or longer.  We ate a lot of great food.  Today my coworkers and I went to the Elmwood for lunch, we sat out on the deck.  It was great, a very nice lunch.  I enjoy going out with them, they're such interesting people, varying in opinions, humor and experiences.  All of them are older than me, which is a change of pace since most of my friends in my life are younger than me.  Today has been slooooooooooooow.  There isn't much going on.  Cindy stopped by after her class but had to go to work, but she then called me and we talked on the phone for an hour.  Amazing how I can still get work done and talk to her at the same time.  Our conversation went (and usually goes) like this:  Cindy: Fat fat, fat we're so fat. Luke: Gym gym gym, we should do the gym. Cindy: Let's eat tonight at Golden Port. Luke: Okay, wanna get some liquor? Cindy: Well, yeah.  Taco Bell at midnight?  Yes, we are horrible horrible people.  I was reading an  urlLink article  about an exhibit traveling the world that uses real bodies, deceased, in its display.  Parts of the bodys are opened and put together and displayed for visitors.  It's a real learning experience and I'd definitely would like to see it.  However, I find it funny when religion pokes its head into the mix. People feel its wrong and amoral to display dead bodies (even though these people donated their bodies when they died).    For example:  Eva Edwards was fascinated until she discovered the exhibit featured real human bodies. She quickly saw a conflict between her religious and scientific beliefs. "Religiously, we feel the body should be respected and buried," she said. "I don't really feel that scientifically."   Yes, because burying stuff and letting it rot and forgetting about it is so much better than preserving it so it won't rot and turn to dust and let people learn from it.  Ugh.   urlLink    Who the heck would let their cat weight this much?  Hopefully we can get out a little early today.  It's going so slow!

      So I went home for lunch, walked and all.  I say if I want food, I need to work for it.  I didn't even want to stop since I ate so much last night, but my arms and legs started shaking and I knew I wouldn't last until 7 tonight.  I couldn't believe how shaky I was, it was getting worse the closer to my place I got.  On the way, I had considered doing an all cereal food regime since it would control my calories really well (one box per day is about 2000 calories).  Well, I'd need to be sure its a low sugar high fiber cereal, because the cereal I had this morning made me so hungry and shaky by noon I couldn't do that every day.  Cat enjoyed me being home for just a couple minutes.  I don't know how she's going to handle me being on vacation for two weeks.  It will be so lonely. :(  Maybe Cindy and Laura can take turns staying with her?  So my mother IMed me and was telling me about her dentist visit today.  She goes to my dentist too, and since I went yesterday they were raving over how wonderful a person I was:   Mom : I went for my cleaning this morning and they were all oohing and ahhing about what a nice young man you are  Mom : they said you were every mother's dream of a son in law  Mom : I said does that mean he didn't cause a scene and throw a fit?  Mom : they LOVE you  Mom : even Mr Dr thakrar said he saw you and what a nice fellow you were.  Mom : I said that you took after your mother  Mom : I did hear she was a nice person  My mom makes me laugh sometimes.  I can't even go to the dentist without being harassed, if even a day late!  So I opened my new money market account and put my six months saved income into it.  You're supposed to have nine, so we'll see how that goes.  It has a 2.15% interest rate and its harder to get to than a checking/savings account, so we'll see how that goes.  Mom was telling me about all the wonderful (read expensive) things we'll be doing out in CA for two weeks.  Dodger's game, boat trip to Catalina Island, San Diego zoo.  Should be fun.  I have to water all my plants.. eek.. two weeks, so much goes on during two weeks.  And I'm going to be away....  After helping my mom with my uncle's website, she wrote:  Mom : you are the best!  Mom : but I already knew that because the dentist's office told me this morning.  Something to make me smile. :)  Also, Sheila called and wants to go to Golden Port tonight at 6:15, so that's something to look forward to.

      So CNN is reporting this morning that Saddam Hussein was in court today and when asked for a statement he said that the real criminal is George Bush.  While he's not anyone that should have lead a country or gassed his own people, I couldn't agree more than that the US President is the real criminal here: leading us to war under false pretenses.  I just heard a funny and cruel joke: When Mary Kate Olsen was reading a newspaper article about her finally being 18 she said "Damnit!  Who told this reporter I lost another pound??"  Ouch.  Anyway, Tuesday night after the gym, Laura and Cindy came over and we hung out, munched on food and stayed up way too late.  Laura left, Cindy didn't, so Cindy and I hung out and burned workout CDs and watched late night TV until 1am.  Wednesday was a really busy day for me.  I think 3 different people asked if I was cranky.  I don't get cranky!  I just get busy and distracted.  Full staff meeting at 9am, going back to my apartment with Janina at lunch to drop off goods she's donating to me, dentists appointment from 2:30 to 4:30 and then gym until 7.  Got home, picked up Cindy and we went to Walmart.  We meant to also go to BJs and a Pet Store to get rat food, but by the time we were done at Walmart, everything was closed.  We hung out for the rest of the night, ate biscuits, cereal and everything else in my apartment. :)  She left around 11:20.. woah!

      So Sunday was okay. I went to Brueggers, got a paper and ate a couple bagels. I came back to the 'part 'ment and clipped a bunch of coupons. Then I made a trek to Target (grrrrr) and returned a DVD I bought (I already owned it damnit). This time I was in the store for under 60 seconds, so it wasn't so bad. :)  I also stopped by a Rite Aide to buy some soda and deodorant that were both on sale (with coupon) and my luck, the one at 12 Corners was out of both. So I continued down Monroe and found a sketchy one on Goodman and got my stuff and left as quickly as possible.  Laura came over and hung out until we were all ready to leave for the picnic. I picked up Cindy, we got on the road and got to the picnic with a couple minutes to spare. Good food: chicken breasts, salads, beans and the like. It was nice. Grandma gave me $10, Deb gave me a memory board. Mom gave me hopes of a dinner in the future.  Sophie and Grace wanted to play hide and go seek, so Deb, Laura, Cindy and I played with them. Deb was 'it' and we ran around trying to get to the home base. Well, I don't know what was wrong with me but I became so winded that I gave up trying to run and let Deb tag me. Very embarrassing. I guess I'm really out of shape. Which is depressing.  We left and went and visited Molly (who worked through the picnic) at her hot dog stand in Waterloo. We visited for awhile, Laura and Cindy got hot dogs and we eventually got on the road around 8. Laura and Cindy left and the cat and I hung out for the rest of the evening.  Monday morning came and I decided I was going to try and start a good habit... every morning I'll go and run/walk through Mt. Hope cemetery at 7am for an hour. So that's what I did, and it was nice. I built up a nice sweat and I was extremely tired after I got done. Work was nice Monday.. no bosses. I even wore a t-shirt to work.. haha. I went to the gym at noon and decided to shake up my workout... so I did the stair climber for... 30 minutes! If you've ever done the stair climber at a high rate, you'll know 10 minutes is bad enough.  Jake and I have been emailing back and forth during the day and he's given me some fatherly advice about working out, so I'm going to try a couple items he suggested (which I knew, but I need someone to tell me). You're not working out unless you're pushing yourself. As soon as it becomes easy, you need to push harder. I'd love it if I was able to run run for an hour during the morning and then push again during lunch. If I can start losing weight again I'll be more than happy to continue this. I've even begun eating the way I used to eat: 3 square meals a day, 2000 calories. Oatmeal in the morning, plenty of food during the day and a full dinner.  We'll see how it works out in the next couple weeks. Laura leaves in a couple weeks and Cindy moves in, in a couple weeks. Hopefully I can continue my routine when Cindy moves in.  Monday night I ripped a couple DVDs I got in the mail, ate a full dinner, then headed to the post office to mail them back to Netflix. I also deposited Grandma's check in my bank and also stopped by Cingular to port my number. They closed at 7, so I missed them by 2 minutes. I guess it'll have to wait until today. Laura, Cindy and Kerri all went to the mall during this time and shopped for bras. Sounds like fun. ;)  I stopped by the Central Library, returned a DVD and tried to get 2 others. However, they're 'in transit' so I'm out of luck until they arrived in the next day or so. My PDA gets returned Tuesday, so I'm looking forward to that.  This morning, I woke up and it was raining, but I went for my run through the cemetery, however, the gates were closed. I had to run down Elmwood and go in the smaller gate. Too much work just to work out. :) Now I'm at work, and this day should be just as nice as yesterday.

      So last night was quiet. Cindy and Kerri went out dancing and drinking so I stayed in with Ashley. You know what? Late night TV isn't as fun without Cindy watching with me.  This morning I'm watching VH1 best month ever and a special about La Toya Jackson. I think its funny. All these shows on MTV and VH1 are showing the lives of celebrities, but all of them seem to go to the Kentucky Derby. What's with that? They all meet up there too.. and funny thing is.. Jessica Simpson is on each of these shows. Sheesh. We watched an episode of Anna Nicole and the same thing happened. She's a funny character, and her son is one screwed up guy.  You find out so much useless crap about famous people if you watch enough television. I think I'm going to Brueggers in a little bit. Cindy wants me to wake her up to go to the picnic, but I'm gonna let her sleep until this afternoon since the picnic is at 5, so we have to leave around 3:45 or so. Ugh, the Jackson family has had so much plastic surgery. La Toya was really hot until she had her nose done, and now she looks fake.

      Friday night was fun! Oh, what do you mean I didn't do anything? After work I took Cindy and her deceased rat to the vet on Park Ave. Unfortunately, the vet closed at 5, so we were a bit out of luck. Her rat is starting to give off an odor, poor little thing, so she wants to get it cremated soon.  Linda, Michele, Cindy and I went to Dinosaur BBQ around 6. We arrived and to our wonderful surprise, we were seated right away. However, there was an hour wait, so we were very lucky to have surpassed it. We all had chicken and a couple of them had ribs too. I had a sandwhich with their macaroni and cheese and 'marshed' potatoes as Cindy put it. :) They were fantastic.  I dropped Cindy off at her dorm and came back and spent a quiet night with the cat watching Stargate on SciFi. Unfortunately, I kept falling asleep during the show so I missed a couple important scenes. Luckily, they repeat the same 2 episodes at the 10 and 11:00 hour, so I set the tape and went to bed.  I woke up this morning at 9:30. I think I had almost 11 hours of sleep. Who needs that much sleep? I got ready and went on a couple errands. First I headed off to the post office to mail a DVD back to Netflix (2 week free trial), I dropped by Staples and bought 25 blank DVDs for $20 and then headed to ESL, my bank, to cancel that new credit card I got through them. It turns out its a little different than they first described to me. And I don't need a credit card for a couple perks when I already have a credit card at 7.9%. After waiting 30 minutes, the lady looked at me weird when I asked to cancel it. "Um.. I've never actually had to cancel one of these..." Heh. Let me be the first lady.  Then I headed to Target to use my new gift card I got from Uno. (Thanks sooo much Cindy!) Target isn't my favorite store in the whole world (no offense to Laura or Uno who love the store), first because prices are higher than Walmart and second because their selection seems to be limited. So I searched the store front to back for their nice garbage cans (Cindy indicated I should get one since I need a nice one). Well, I found their plastic ones.. and they sucked. So I kept looking. On the other side of the store, like 15 aisles away, I found the metal garbage cans, and they were nice. They were also $100 or more each. Whooo! Yeah right.  So I looked through every section of the store for other possible things to buy with my gift card. Nope. How about... nope. Do they have... nope! Damnit! They don't have anything I want. So I looked some more, got really tired of looking and headed to Walmart to return an item there. They easily took that item back, but they refused to give me my money back for an item they double charged me for. They said I'd have to go back to Irondeqoit to return it. Ugh. I need to spend $2 in gas to get $1.99 refunded. Yeah right.  So I left Walmart and got gas and headed back home. I ate lunch and watched the taped Stargate from last night. Unfortunately, I kept falling asleep again.. so I had to keep rewinding. Sheesh, Luke. What is it with you and falling asleep? I went to the 2:30 showing of Chronicles of Riddick, which was a good movie. I didn't like how fast the imagry moved on screen. It stinks when you can't see what they're showing you. But I liked it, and saw a lot of the same qualities its prequel had.  After the movie I went back to Target to try and find something to buy. Believe it or not, I spent 2 hours there trying to find something. I finally decided I would buy items that I truly need rather than something 'gift like.' So I bought 2 new pillows, super-odor-killing kitty litter, febreez, a new DVD, blank DVD labels and some toilet paper. Over all, a great birthday present from Uno! Thanks Uno! :-) :-) :-)  So now I'm sitting in my apartment waiting for something to do. Tomorrow evening I'm heading to my grandmothers with Laura and Cindy for my birthday party, but until then I'm probably just going to do some serious cleaning around the apartment. Maybe I'll watch a couple of the DVDs I've reclaimed.

      So Monday, we returned the rental car during lunch. Not exactly the most exciting lunch I've ever had, but Cindy bought me 2 double cheeseburgers and dropped me off at work. I had a bad meeting with the coworkers about the website just like on Friday but the evening was a bit better.  I got a ton of mail on Tuesday. 3 birthday cards, each with money in them, and my movie Outfoxed came today. Actually, they sent me 2 on accident! Woohoo!  Tuesday after work, I went and visited Laura. We went to Walmart to shop for food and stuff. Cindy told me not to buy any food, but I had coupons... so I bought a ton of food. I bought some cake mix and frosting for my birthday on Wednesday. Laura and I made a meatball sub dinner with salad and smoothies. We watched Trading Spouses, but Cindy called and I went and picked her up. We needed to do laundry and I had promised to pick her up around 8.  I went and got quarters from Movies 10 ($5 for me $5 for Cindy) and came back and did laundry. I dropped Cindy off, went to bed after folding up some clothes. Interesting, huh?  Wednesday was my birthday. My apartment was a mess. I had meant to clean it, but every time I planned for it, something else came up. Work was blah. However, I came in and someone had put a HAPPY BIRTHDAY sign over my office door and my non-co-workers threw me a party with pudding cake and a card. It was really nice of them. The folks upstairs didn't really even notice.  After work I went and bought 3 movie tickets from the cashier's office, I made cupcakes and frosted them and Laura came over and we went to the Post Office and finally mailed Cindy's book that she left here. We headed to Tinseltown and met up with Jake and watched Spiderman 2, which was a great movie. Gave me chills several times. After, we cameback to my place. We picked up Cindy and I invited Kerri over to hang out. I went to pick up Linda, but she called and said she didn't want to come. The cat had walked all over all the cupcakes (luckily, I covered them with papertowels). If I didn't like her so much, I'd kill her!  I went back to the forbidden Hess, got some soda and gas, and went home to hang out with everyone. We had some cupcakes, ice cream and I opened my present from Laura. Wow.. she got me this huge dinnerware set.. plates, dishes, cups and bowls. She also got me some glass cups. They're all so fantastic.. Laura eventually left and we went over to the Distillery and got Jake some food. Cindy and Kerri went to McDonalds and got some food. She got me a double cheeseburger.. sometimes something so little makes ya happy.  Kerri and Cindy left and Jake stayed over that night. I had to get up at 5 to take Linda to the airport on Thursday. She went and had a job interview in Washington DC to do the same thing Luke Osborne does. I came back and woke Jake up at 7 so he could go to work. Then I woke up at 8 and went to work, albeit very tired. Jake forgot his cell phone, so it looks like I'm babysitting this weekend for it.  Thursday was also blah.. but fortunately, I'm done with this damn website! No more dribble over it anymore. Went to the gym during lunch (early lunch). After work I went to Verizon Wireless, Cingular Wireless and BJs. I used up a gift card that Mary Joan and Frank gave me for my birthday. I'm also looking into porting my Verizon cell number to Cingular and then porting right back to Verizon. I need to call about that.  Cindy came over after I got back and she wrote one of her papers while I cleaned the apartment. She stayed over (but stayed awake all night) while I slept. Now I'm sitting at work, contemplating all the work I should be doing. I'm waiting on several people to get back to me, plus someone brought in really tasty bagels today.  Tonight Cindy and I are going to Greece to eat Chinese and maybe a movie after. What's bugging me is I seem to have lost $10 from between Tuesday and today. and its driving me insane trying to figure it out.

      Friday I woke up, tip toeing around so I didn't wake up either of the Cindy's. Went to work, got chewed out for stupid little stuff, had a bad morning, but Cindy and Cindy picked me up from work, we went and rented a car for Dos for her trip to Phily. I had to rent it since Cindy doesn't have a credit card. So the car is in my name. I told Cindy I'd feel more comfortable if she took my car and I took the rental this weekend, just so if something happens, the car(s) are covered by insurance.  They drop me off and they head to Golden Port. I continue to work on the website. Cindy and Cindy bring me some leftovers (which were fantastic, even cold) and I finish my day in a grumpy mood.  I get home and Cindy V. is gone. So sad, I missed her the entire weekend. Laura and Cindy get there and Linda comes over. We're all going to Raging Burrito for dinner (we's got's coupons!). Kerri comes over, a bit late, and Linda tells us in the car she has to go at 7, which was like 10 minutes from then.  We sit down, order our food, our waitress takes forever to do anything (I'm so impatient with people whose jobs are to serve me) and we eventually get our food. We eat, we have a great time and the waitress takes the coupon and takes the discount on the cheapest burrito any of us got (rather than a previous GOOD waitress that discounts the $8 burrito). Oh well. :)  We go back to my place, hang out and then go and head to the movies. On the way, we stopped to get snacks at the Hess gas station next to my apartment and I got 2 bottles of soda. 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' Good movie.. kinda weird.. but good. I realized during the movie that the lady at the gas station never gave me my change for the soda.. I gave her a $5 bill and she gave me 12 cents back or whatever. After the movie, Laura heads home and Kerri, Cindy and I head back to my place.  I stop at the Hess, go in and politely explain that I was in a couple hours earlier and that I didn't get the correct change. The lady said that I'd have to wait until 3am to get my change, since that's when they close down the register. I said sure... I'd give her my name and phone and tomorrow I can come back and get my $3. Then she said she remembers clearly.. CLEARLY giving me my change. I told her I didn't get my change, but that I would wait until tomorrow to know for sure. If they are $3 over, then it's my money. If they're not $3 over, then no harm done. She then called me a liar and said I was making a big deal over only $3. I told her that $3 is a big deal to me because its my money and that I would wait until tomorrow, she didn't need to yell at me. It was no big deal. She then said she was a mother of 4 and her entire paycheck goes to bills and only has $20 left at the end of the week, so I shouldn't tell HER about $3. I lied and said I was a college student and $3 was a big deal to me. She then said if I was really a college student, then she'd remember ME. She then said I wasn't welcome at this Hess station ever again (all the while, she was slipping $3 under the window to me). I said thank you and started for the door. She then yelled SEVEN YEARS BUDDY. I turned, walked out the door and she came on the intercom for the building outside and screamed SEVEN YEARS.  Holy good god mother of china..! I got in the car, frazzled (over $3) and we went back to my place. Kerri left, Cindy A. and I hung out, watched raunchy tv and went to bed. I didn't have a good day, as you can see.  Saturday we got up, went to breakfast at Jay's diner after I ran some errands (I mailed my PDA to get it fixed, shopped for some things and went to Dollar General). They had sugarfree syrup, my favorite. Cindy got some french toast (I stole a delicious piece). Laura came over and wrapped up the wedding gift, I got ready and we left to head to Kristen and Wil's wedding around 12:45. After a long two hour drive (and me driving 80) we got there just in time to be seated in the 6th row. Wedding started, lasted forever, and then let out. We waited a long time to throw flowers on Kristen & Will, but it ended up not working out. We got tired of being rained on, so we headed to the country club for the reception.  Found it, went in, and started eating cheeses, drank at the open wine, beer and soda bar (awesome) and awaited the bride &amp; groom. We visited with the people at our table (and secretly hoped that Mr. 7th seat wasn't going to show so Cindy could sit with us with no issues). He never showed! Salads came out, then the main courses. Either beef, chicken or pasta. The waitress was really confused, since nobody at our table ordered beef, but she said 4 people did. Oops. But she finally brought the right food, Cindy had chicken, I had pasta, Laura had beef. We got some Italian cookies, finished our dinners, Laura got tipsey (hehe) and the dancing started.  We danced for a good 4-5 hours. It was so much fun. I sweated like an animal, but it was good fun, plus I felt I was burning off the food I was eating. We left the party around 11 and I drove for 2 hours very tired and with two sleeping people in my vehicle. Finally, I saw Rochester, and we settled into the apartment for a good night's sleep. I think I hit the bed already asleep.  Laura and I woke up and headed to Brueggers for breakfast. Cindy got ready for the day. Today was the last day, Sunday, she was gonna be there so we planned to do a couple fun things. We went to a neat store on Park Ave called Park Leigh (or something), tried to shop on Monroe unsuccessfully, but then headed to Unos in Henrietta for lunch. We had a great meal, Laura and I split a small pizza and I had a salad. Cindy A got some chili and a burger. We took pictures, laughed, caught up on good times, and headed out to the lake for the final 2 hours.  We got up to Charlotte Beach, walked around, walked out on the pier, and then got some ice cream. A weird old hairy guy was skating in a speedo. He kept going past us. Ick. We headed back to my place, Laura went home and I took Cindy (minus Cindy's Michael Moore book) to the airport. I hugged her, told her I'd miss her (I will!) and sent her on her way.  I went back to my messy apartment (I had 3 people over this weekend) and relaxed. I was not looking forward to getting back to the grind at work. :( I got nervous since Cindy wasn't home and it was 9:30. I called Kim with no answer. But Cindy got home at 10pm and Uno was back home too. Cindy and I hung out, talked about our weekends (her weekend was a bit more of a downer) and eventually went to bed around 1 or 2. I think she stayed up though.  A long weekend for sure, but I had a ton of fun with all of my friends. I don't know what I'm going to do without then come September. :(

      So I don't remember Wednesday.  Forgive me.  Thursday was blah as blah can be, I had a bad day.  I went to a meeting at the Town House for a couple hours and the people I was meeting were not only out of the loop about what they were doing but huffy because they felt they were doing more than they were supposed to be doing.  I explained that when you volunteer to do something, you do it.  However, I think they'll no longer be volunteering.  My female boss got extremely upset over the website I created for her due to the many grammatical errors in the site.  Since it was a collaborative effort and 90% of the content was coming from the old site (which was online for 5 years) and since we have at least a week before we deploy the new site to the web, I didn't feel it necessary to check everyone's spelling.  What turned from her reviewing the site and giving me feedback turned into her writing me an email titled "major problems" and telling me I would have all of her edits in my mailbox tomorrow.   I got stressed, so I went and scraped up $1.25 to get a diet coke, I even had to borrow a quarter.  So I went to the vending machine and they were sold out of diet coke.  So I went to another one: sold out.  So I pushed the "Diet Coke w/Lemon" and a mellow yellow came out.  Ugh!  Disgusted (and in desperate need of a pick me up) I went and got a refund for the soda from the ID office and came back and got a diet coke out of a machine I could actually see the soda.  I came home and worked hard to get my wireless router working again.  Apparently a night of downloading a couple episodes of Stargate has made my router break.  After 3.5 hours, I found out that my router no longer will encrypt my wireless packets and still give me an IP addy that works.  So I turned off encryption, turned on restriction and poof, it's working again.  I just have to be careful what I write on the network now since someone outside could be reading ;).  Cindy Vaca came over at 10 to give me food and go to the airport with me.  Cindy Allen's plane was coming in at 10:30, but she called and said they were delayed.  I checked the website and it said 10:45, which is fine.  I checked it 5 minutes later and it said 10:50.  Hmm.  I checked it again at 10:30 and it said 11:30.  For god's sake!  But we picked her up finally.  She's lost a bunch of weight, looks really nice and even streaked her hair!  We came back, I went to bed at 1, but Cindy and Cindy stayed up until 5 and visited.  I'll write more about the weekend later.
