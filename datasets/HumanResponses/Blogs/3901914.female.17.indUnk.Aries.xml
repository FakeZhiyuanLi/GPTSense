      no song today.&nbsp; its not really a happy mood today, and i shall explain why!   yesterday jami and i went over to my little sisters friends house to pick her up. while i was there i was talking to the dad, after all, out families are friends.&nbsp; im standing there as he tells me about a girl from my school who fell off a cliff and died last friday, july 23.&nbsp; as i asked him the name i thoguht, "well it wont be anyone i know, but thats sad." then my heart dropped as he said "well she was going to be a junior, it was um, chris hartman's little sister" i fell into a chair and just cried and cried.&nbsp; katie was such an amazing person and a great friend of mine.&nbsp; i miss her so much.&nbsp; this isnt fair.&nbsp; she was only 15! she had her whole life ahead of her.&nbsp; she was such a bright light to so many people.&nbsp;  what happened was she was on vacatin with her family in west virginia.&nbsp; her, her older borther, and his girlfriend(who is also a friend of mine) went hiking.&nbsp; they got to the 900 fott peak and decided to rest, eat, and take pictures.&nbsp; katie got too close the the edge as she fainted due to a fainting problem she has.&nbsp; as she fainted she fell 30-40 feet to her death.&nbsp; almost 3 hours later she was pronounced dead.&nbsp;  this sucks so much.&nbsp; she was such an amazing person.&nbsp; if we were both in a bad mood, she ried to make me happy before herself.&nbsp; we ate ice cream for breakfast together.&nbsp; we talked every morning!&nbsp; everyone loved her, and there is no reason they shouldnt have.&nbsp;  katie- i love you so much and i will always miss you.&nbsp; nothing will ever be the same without you.&nbsp; you meant so much to so many people.&nbsp; we all love you and miss you.&nbsp; you will always be in my heart. please, say a prayer for katie, her family, her friends, her classmates, and myself.&nbsp; i know we all need it. peace.

       Wish You Were Here~~ Pink Floyd   So, so you think you can tell  Heaven from Hell,  Blue skys from pain.  Can you tell a green field  From a cold steel rail?  A smile from a veil?  Do you think you can tell?   And did they get you to trade  Your heros for ghosts?  Hot ashes for trees?  Hot air for a cool breeze?  Cold comfort for change?  And did you exchange  A walk on part in the war  For a lead role in a cage?   How I wish, how I wish you were here.  We're just two lost souls  Swimming in a fish bowl,  Year after year,  Running over the same old ground.  What have we found?  The same old fears.  Wish you were here.  &nbsp; so i decided to get away from dashboard today, give you guys a little variety! i love pink floyd, and i really like this song! when i play the cd in my car and this song comes on, i roll up the windows so i can sing it without anyone hearing me.&nbsp; i know, im kinda dorky, but hey, at least ill admit it.&nbsp; im the biggest nerd in the world! but anyhey, onto my day! so my friend jami satyed the night last night, you know, the one whos brother doesnt want her hanging out with me! yeah, yesterday was her birthday, so i picked her up and me, her, and my older sister went to putt-putt, then to my sis's boyfriends friends house to go swimming! since we did not have bathing suits, we got to swim in boy swim trunks and out tops! yeah it was fun, but the pool was really warm, kind of like bath water, so it wasnt really a cool down so to say. but yes moving on.&nbsp; then we came back ot my house and decided to lay down and sleep in front of the TV, however, very little sleeping went on.&nbsp; i fell aslepp, but was then woken up when i heard jami and my little sister talking, mind you it was a little before 3 AM so i felt kind of bad, so i woke up.&nbsp; then&nbsp; jami fell asleep leaving me awake until probably around 4:30 AM.&nbsp; yeah that was no fun because i was sooo tired! then i woke up and had to take jami home so i could take my papa (grandpa) to his physical therapy session.&nbsp; then i had to go straight into work.&nbsp; i have been sooo tired all day.&nbsp; i could barely keep my eyes open, but all is good now i guess. that was a really boring story, sorry to everyone who wasted their time reading it!! but yes moving on... so i am at work, right? and my leg itches.. and there ios a scab there because it used to me a skeeter (mosquito) bite, but i scratched it and well, you know the deal.&nbsp; anyhey, so i was wearing khaki pants and then i look down and there was blood on the outside of my leg...it had gone through from where the scab was.&nbsp; appearntly the scab came off when i scratched it! darn it, because those were my only pair of khaki pants, and they fit me lenght wise, which is very odd because i&nbsp; am very short.&nbsp; so hopefully this stain comes out! we shall see! but yes... hmmmm... what to say, oh i know! shout out time!! to my dearest jami! girl...happy sweet sixteen (yesterday).&nbsp; im glad you liked your present! im soooo glad we met.&nbsp; i dont know what i would do without you.&nbsp; wel i know one thing for sure, your brother wouldnt hate me so much, and he wouldnt be so mad at you! but anyhey... you are the best.&nbsp; finally i have a female friend my age at work! WHOO-HOO.&nbsp; hey, wanna go drivin on the expressway, make your bro a little angrier? or how about we just keep saying bye to him, he'll eventually have to look at us at least! hehehe! gosh, im such a bad influence, but you are the instigator! man i hate to see how you grow up to be! hehe... just joshin ya! you know i have nothing but love, and gas, for you, just dont ever fart on me again! see you laters! but yes, so jami is the coolest gal i have ever met! just ask her! kk, well i think i am out for tonight, though it is still early, danielle is very tired!   *MUAH* to all of you...PEACE!     &nbsp; ps-- 25 days until you return... you know who you are, and you know i still miss you and im here for you, forever and always!

       Screaming Infedelities ~~Dashboard Confessional   I'm missing your bed, I never sleep Avoiding the spots, where we'd have to speak And this bottle of beasts is taking me home I'm cuddling close to blankets and sheets You're not alone and you're not descreet You make sure I know who's taking you home I'm reading your note over again There's not a word that I comprehend Except when you signed it, "I'll love you always and forever." As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs And sit alone and wonder how you're making out But as for me I wish that I was anywhere With anyone making out I'm missing your laugh, how did it break? And when did your eyes begin to look fake? I hope you're as happy as you're pretending I'm missing your bed, I never sleep Avoiding the spots, where we'd have to speak And this bottle of beasts is taking me home Your hair, it's everywhere Screaming infedelities, and taking it's wear &nbsp; &nbsp; so there is&nbsp;a reason i chose this song, but i really dont feel like talking about it.&nbsp; so since i got to work today i have had a pretty bad headache so i have felt kinda crappy since about 2:00.&nbsp; but i did take a nap from like 8ish-10ish, so i do feel a little better.&nbsp; but anyhey... so the whole this i worte about the other day (yesterday or the day before?) i have no clue how that is going to turn out.&nbsp; the two guys i talked about wont look at me, much less talk to me anymore, which i am fine with, itll make it easier for me not to be friends with them anymore and keeping our conversations strictly business. so that is good, i guess. so yeah, but i want to get off that subject because i dont want to get mself worked up over it anymore! so there, begone with the subject for now!! so yeah... have you ever been bored and decided you wanted to do something productive, but didnt know what to do? i felt like that earlier.&nbsp; i got home from work and was sitting on the couch playing super mario brothers 3 on an original Nintendo System (sooo cool, got it for $6 at a garage sale (including games) and it works perfectly).&nbsp; anyhey... so my little sister came down and had a notebook and markers and a stapler and some stuffing from a stuffed animal she cut apart (still, i do not know why she did that... the pain, the horror!!).&nbsp; she colored the paper, then crumbled it up to make is feel kinda soft.&nbsp; the she put the stuffing in between two pieces and stapled it together, she threw it at me and said "look, i made a pillow" what a nred she is, but then i starting thinking, "i would ike to do something artistic right now" but i have to artsy, craft skills, besides sewing, and i didnt feel like going to JoAnn's for material, and i wanted to do something like drawing, but i cant draw if my life depended on it.&nbsp; so instead i continued playing video games, ate dinner, plaed more games, watch part of Finding Nemo, then took my nap.&nbsp; i woke up and felt very lazy! so tomorrow i am going to try to be very unlazy and try to keep myself busy.&nbsp; but yeah... i want to take these final moments just to say a couple things, if you dont understand it, then just ignore it, it is meant for a friend i miss so much and am here for as long as he needs.&nbsp; so here you are: zia's, mario winnians, BIODOME!!, we are only humans, we make mistakes, the park--it seems to be our meetin spot!, white rose, goofy pictures, chemistry (blah), voicemails, letters, matching outfits for dinner, etc etc... i tried to get some that werent on the calender, but i dont think i did too well.&nbsp; call me sometime! but anyhey....  *MUAH* to all of you...PEACE!

      hmmm, well, no song today.&nbsp; im too, whats the word im looking for? well whatever it is i am too much of it.&nbsp;upset? angry? stressed? preterbed (sp)?i dont know! &nbsp;so let me tell you:  so i where i work, i am like the youngest person there, and not only that, but the only people who work there relevantly close to my age are guys.&nbsp; now i know what you are thinkin ladies "LUCKY!", well, youre wrong, and allow me to tell you why!&nbsp; well recently one of their little sisters started working there.&nbsp; which was so cool for me because 1. now i have a girl my age there and 2. i dont have many girl friends, so this was cool. so me and her started talking and eventually hanging out.&nbsp; then turns out, her older bro doesnt want me hanging out with her becaus ehe thinks i might be a "bad influence".&nbsp; bad influence my ass! im not a bad kid.&nbsp; ill admit sometimes i may be a little rebellious, i mean i have stayed out 15 minutes after my curfew before (sarcasm), i do normal teenage stuff, but im not a bad kid, in my opinion.&nbsp; but anyhey... but surprisingly he let her hang out with me yesterday.&nbsp; we had a blast, but when me and her were driving on the expressway yesterday, i was going a little fast and it started to rain, and my car spun out a little.&nbsp; nothing happened, everything was fine, and all is well.&nbsp; we were a little shook up, but thats all.&nbsp; well he found out today at work and wouldnt talk to me.&nbsp; granted he hasnt been talkin to me much ately because he is mad at me for hanging out with his sister, but today it was terrible.&nbsp; then i find out, all he wanted to do was tell me off and make me cry.&nbsp; so after i found that out i decided to call him because i really want us to "be cool" again because he is such a good guy and has treated me with probably the most respect out of any of the other guys i work with, and i really appreciate that.&nbsp; but anyhey, when i called him he had this other guy we work with answer the phone.&nbsp; this other guy told me that my friends brother had nothing to say to me because he thought i would have nothing good to say to him.&nbsp; he told this guy to tell me that he doesnt ever want to talk to me again because im immature because of what happened, and irresponsible.&nbsp; so i just said "and hes not immature by not talkin to me?" he repiled with "no, because you pull this shit all the time at work, with all your crazy mood swings no one knows when they can catch you in a good mood" well for that i am sorry.&nbsp; i just try to treat them with the same respect they treat me. but maybe i  am  in the wrong about all of it.&nbsp; i dont know, i guess we will just have to see how things get.&nbsp; i might end up looking for a new job, but i doubt it.&nbsp; i still need to talk to him personally about all this.&nbsp; dont worry, ill keep updates! anyhey...  a couple good things came out of today,&nbsp; iwent to a movie with my mom, older sister, and one of my younger sisters, i got to hang out with an great friend of mine i havent hung out with in like 4 weeks, maybe even more than that, oh well though.&nbsp; and i got to see a friend i havent seen in forever! that was great because lippy is awesome!!&nbsp; oh and i got hit on by a carnie (sp?)... that was fun right crystal? lol... gosh it was weird! hehe! oh well, i think i am going to hit the sack pretty soon so i should wrap this up right about now.&nbsp; i promise next time i will have a song since you all care o0h so much (sarcasm).&nbsp; *MUAH* to all of you!&nbsp; PEACE!  &nbsp;  ps--less than a month til jeremy comes back!

       Shirts and Gloves ~~Dashboard Confessional    When I'm back from the road then you're out on it  And I'm tired of this distance and I believe it's over, it's over  And this phone tag game is endless, the novelty is wearing  I'm hoping time will pass without any assistance or convincing  &nbsp;  Road rules apply, there's so much action, you're getting busy  So I'll call your cellular phone to tell you TV night was lonely without you  And so am I, so am I  It seems our day keeps falling on a leap year  &nbsp;  So many high points on this last leg I can't wait to recount them  It seems like nothing's happened until I've shared them with you  And that note that you had called says you're half a day away  And you are heading home just in time for me, for me to leave  &nbsp;  And road rules apply there's so much action, I'm getting busy  So make sure that I'm up to date on TV night, I'd hate to miss out  I think I miss you most on Wednesdays and Saturdays  It seems our day keeps falling on a leap year  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  so i was sitting in my car today listening to this cd (of course--ps thank you crystal for letting me borrow it...i still need to get it back to you tho! well figure it out--anyhey...) and i think i realized just why i love this cd soooo much.&nbsp; a lot of the songs are about distance, being away from someone you hold dear to yourself, someone you love, etc etc.&nbsp; my dear friend jeremy is away.&nbsp; he left april 26 and is to be gone until aug 16 (116 days).&nbsp; he has done soooooooo much for me i cant even begin to describe it.&nbsp; hes helped me through things i didnt think i would make it out of, and has taught me that in order for things to get better, i need to help myself. he also helped me to find myself.&nbsp;  &nbsp;jeremy  , if you are reading this now, thank you  . i know i say it all the time, but never nearly enough.&nbsp; thank you, for being there&nbsp;for me, now let me be there for you! anyhey...  funny story... well not really.&nbsp; maybe its a little embarassing (sp?).&nbsp; so i was in the shower today and decided to "change things up a bit".&nbsp; im trying something new lately.&nbsp; trying to break up my habits a little.&nbsp; so to change up my showering, i decided to sit down as i rinsed the shampoo and conditioner out of my hair.&nbsp; eh, prolly not the best thing to do, but i just thought id give it a try.&nbsp; anyhey... it got me thinking, what if i was parapeligic (i kno i didnt spell that right!).&nbsp; ya know? what if i couldnt use my legs.&nbsp; i dont know, just a little thought in my head! then, now this is going to sound stupid, i did somethings trying not to use my legs.&nbsp; ITS HARD!! i mean i figured it would be, but yeah.&nbsp; im so thankful i am able to use all of my limbs! if any of you reasding this right now are unable to use any of your limbs or have difficulty with them, i admire you so much. but anyhey...  i think its about time i go and dance on the coulds in my dreamland! dont forget to smile!&nbsp;   *MUAH to all of you*...PEACE!!

        A Plain Morning   ~~Dashboard Confessional    It's yet to be determined, but the air is thick  And my hopes are feeling worn, I'm missin home  And I'm glad you're not a part of this  'Cause there're parts of me that will be missed  The phone is always dead to me  So I can't tell you the temperature is dropping and it feels like...   It's colder than it ought to be in March  And I still got a day or two ahead of me  'Till I'll be headin home into your arms again  And the people here are asking after you  It doesn't make it easier, it doesn't make it easier to be away  I'd like to hire a plane, I'd see you in the morning  When the day is fresh I'm comin home again, comin home again, comin  home again  When the day is fresh I'm comin home again   It's warmer where you're waitin, it feels more like July  The pillows are in their cases and one of those is mine  She wrote the words, "I love you," and sprayed it wiht perfume  It's better than the fire is to heat this lonely room  And it's warmer where you're waitin, it feels more like July  It feels more like July   It's yet to be determined, but the air is thick  And my hopes are feeling worn, I'm missin home  And I'm glad you're not a part of this  'Cause there're parts of me that will be missed  The phone is always dead to me  So I can't tell you the temperature is dropping and it feels like...   It's colder than it ought to be in March  And I still got a day or two ahead of me  'Till I'll be headin home into your arms again  And the people here are asking after you  It doesn't make it easier, it doesn't make it easier to be away  I'd like to hire a plane, I'd see you in the morning  When the day is fresh I'm comin home again, comin home again, comin  home again  When the day is fresh I'm comin home again    i dont quite know why, but i really love that song. check it out. actually check out the whole cd (swiss army romance), or any dashboard song for that matter. i love dashboard confessional. they have helped me through a lot. and swiss army romance is helpin me a lot right now. a lot of the songs have a lot of meaning to me right now.  which is cool.  i love music.  its awesome and its amazing how it can get you through something and you can relate with music sometimes more than you can relate with people.  weird thought? what do you think? anyhey... off subject.  i think im going to try to post a new dashboard song everyday.  then when i run out, i will post a new song! tell me if you like it or not! well im gonna get going for tonight i think.  i love ya all! *MUAH* to all of you...

      SO YEAH. I AM GOING TO POINT OUT RIGHT NOW MY CAPS LOCK BUTTON IS NOT ON so i am on the toledo diocese youth council this year for the 2004-2005 year.  its really cool, it is something i have wanted to be on for a while! so i am uber excited! now how, you may ask, does this tie in with my "trouble in the homeland" title! let me explain.  when i filled out my paper work to run for council, i signed a promise stating i would lead a alcohol, nicotine, and drug free, and chaste (no sex) lifestyle.  and i intend to keep that promise.  however, my parents i believe think i have started to smoke.  they found a lighter packet from the store in my car and assumed certain things. "you know, you did sign a slip stating you would lead a certain lifestyle, are you sticking to it?" my dad asked me today.  they packet was from my friend.  she told me it was for incense (sp?).  so thats what i told him.  i dont think they believed me though.  i dont know the whole situation of them not trusting me is really making me upset.  i wish i had just a little more freedom.  a little more trust.  maybe i dont deserve it, but id like to think i do.  because of recent events, they are tending to keep me on a shorter leash than normal.  and it seems there is nothing i can do to show them i will be fine! i guess i just have to live it out for just a little longer! but what bugs me more than the fact they arent trusting me is the fact my mom kind of lied to me today.  i was talking to hewr on the phone and was telling her how im still losing my voice and she said "well maybe you should stay in tonight" but not really saying it bc i am getting sick.  u know how you can tell by tone how someone means something, well i could.  so i asked her "am i in trouble for something" she told me no, but then i got the lecture from my dad.  so i basically was in trouble and/or they were disappointed in me.  it just upsetted me.  but i am fine now.  so yeah, im just gonna live it out a little longer! ill be fine after a while! moving on... dont really know what else to say! so i guess i will get going for tonight! *MUAH* to all of you...PEACE!  35 days jeremy!

      hello to anyone who may read this.  you are going to find out very quickly that i dont like to capitalize any letters... so those of you who get annoyed my grammer errors, im sorry.  dont read i guess.  anyhey... i got the idea to start this "blog" from my dear sweet friend jeremiah/jeremy/prince charming/knight in shining armor/whatever else i call him.  baby you know who you are and thats all that matters, right?  but back on business.  i am glad he got me into it.  this will be good from me! so let me move on! allow me to explain my name...insomniac dreamer.  an old friend and  were on the phone late at night one tme and decided we wanted to write a song with a really cool name.  so instead of writing the song first, we named it.  we called it insomniac dreamer, and ever since then the name just kind of stuck with me.  its unusal, like myself, but i like it! we never did write the song.  he said he did, but i never heard it... OH WELL!! im over it!! :) so yes, i guess thats about it for now! just thought id get myself out there! i miss my jeremy! 35/36(whatever...hehe) days until he comes home!!   *MUAH* to all of you... PEACE!

      how could i have been so stupid.  i dont want to go into too many details, because i dont want to get any more upset that i already am, but yeah, stupidness takes hold of me again.  you ever want something so much for so long and  get it;  its awesome and you think everything is going to be so cool, then you realize not only do you not have it, but it was probably all just a game with you as a pawn anyway? yeah, it really sucks.  and hurts pretty bad too.  but what can you do right? just have to learn to live with it.  but in this particular case, it wont be that easy. sometime, when i can, i will fill in on the details, but if you really want to know, ask, ill see if i am up to it. but moving on... so i go back to school tomorrow and i really dont want to. and my parents basically told me they have very little, if any, faith of me getting into a good college, like the one i want to go to.  gee, way to get me to work hard to go somewhere that 'probably wont accept me" anyway.  oh and its not only my parents, but my aunt too.  way to make me feel sooo stupid, oh wait,  i am right? man i was doing to good for so long.  i mean im still doing fine.  no needs to worry, but still.  i was so happy, and now im just back to feeling nothing again.  oh well ill be back to normal eventually. yeah but im gonna go.  school tomorrow and i really dont feel like this anymore.    *MUAH* to all of you...PEACE!

      Waterfalls~~TLC  A lonely mother gazing out of her window Staring at her son that she just can't touch If at any time he's in a jam She'll be by his side But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much But all the praying just ain't helpin' At all 'cause he can't seem to keep His self out of trouble So he goes out and he makes his money The best way he knows how Another body laying cold in the gutter Listen to me  Chorus Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that You're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way Or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast  Little precious has a natural obsession For temptation but he just can't see She gives him loving that his body can't handle But all he can say is baby is good to me One day he goes and takes a glimpse In the mirror But he doesn't recognize his own face His health is fading and he doesn't know why 3 letters took him to his final resting place Y'all don't hear me  Chorus  I seen a rainbow yesterday But too many storms have come and gone Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray You say because my life is ten shades of grey I prey all ten fade away Seldom praise Him for the sunny days And like his promise is true Only my faith can undo The many chances I blew To bring my life to anew Clear blue and unconditional skies Have dried the tears from my eyes No more lonely cries My only bleedin' hope Is for the folk who can't cope Wit such an endurin' pain That it keeps 'em in the pouurin' rain Who's to blame For tootin' caine in your own vein What a shame You shoot and aim for someone else's brain You claim the insane And name this day and time For fallin' prey to crime I say the system got you victim to your own mind Dreams are hopeless aspirations In hopes of comin' true Believe in yourself The rest is up to me and you  Chorus   going back to the old school songs! i've alwasy really liked this song, im not quite sure why, but i think everyone liked it! so im not the only weird one! ok well maybe i am because it is the title of my post for today! i remember when i was so happy and i thought i was so cool when i had the "rap" part memorized! ah, what a nerd i am! anyhey... im really happy i get to start my vacation tomorrow.  i start the YES project tomorrow evening, then i am going to cedar point and soak city, then relaxing at the cottage! YAY! im excited for all that! it should be fun, plus, hopefully i will get a very nice tan before i have to go back to school! YAY, TAN! hehehe, yes i know, i am a huge nerd! but oh well, at least i can admit it! but anywhoozle bees... (sp?--referance from Bruce Almighty) im so confuzzled with my feelings and emotions lately.  im frustrated with it all as well.  i wish i could make up my damn mind and realize what i want! all in god time though.  i need to stop "looking" for all the answers and everything i want.  though i musn't just sit and wait.  its confusing.  but i know what i mean.  i cant be too hung up on everything, but i cant just "sit on the sidelines", ya know? there was something else i wanted to talk about, but i forget, hold on and let me think to try and remember it! OH YEAH... now i remember! so for the majority of my life, i havent really cared about much when it came to school, but lately i have been htinking a lot about college.  its not that far away, and i finally found somewhere i want to go.  i never thought in a million years i would care about college until i had to, and now i do.  so i am really going to put all my effort into this last year, and hopefully ill get accepted! yay! thatd be awesome. though i will be in for hard years at college! double-majoring, and probably having to live away from home! and not to mention money for it! ugh... maybe i shouldnt be thinking about college... hehehe! oh well, i dont know.  im actually pretty excited for it! woah, did i just say/type that? ive never been excited for anything that had to do with school. wait let me rephrase that, ive neevr been excited for anything that has had to do with school involving work, and lets face it, this would involve a lot of work! ok, i dont really want to think about this right now then! maybe later when i am less tired! so yes! well i have a pretty long week ahead of me, so i think i am going to go for the night! i probably wont be able to update for a while, but we shall see! alrighty. well good night, sleep tight, dont let the bedbugs bite!    *MUAH* to all of you...PEACE!

      hey, so i guess it's been a while. sorry, people have been keeping me busy to get my mind off of certain things. and it has been working. it doesnt change what happened, and i will never forget katie, but im lucky to have those people to help me get through all that happened last week. you know who you are, thank you. you are all very special to me. but anyhey... so in my first post i talked about how a good friend of mine got me into this, and i was thankful! this has helped me say some things and release some emotions without any regrets. he told me he wrote something for me on his and after i read it i started mine. and i was happy. but now, the more i read his, the more i hurt. does he do it intentionally? i read it and realize, thats not him. and i used to think some things but i now realized they were all stupid thoughts that apparently werent true. i was just stupid. WHOO-HOO, way to go again danielle! i always put ideas in my head, then eventually have to realize how stupid i am, and let me tell you! i dont know he just seems like a whole different person now, i barely know him anymore. maybe thats what he wants. i mean it doesnt really seem like he wants to talk anymore, i know hes busy and everything, especially with his new lifestyle, but oh well. i guess sometimes you just have to learn things the hard way. just when you think you know someone, and it all seems great, i dont know. ill always feel the same for him though. i dont really want to talk about this anymore. so i guess i should change the subject. damn i am so emotional lately. ever since katie's death i jsut am too emotional. i hate being like this. im crying more and i hate it. im not supposed to cry, ya know? i hate it. and im always tired! but i will be getting over it eventually! time for a funny story. so my friend crystal stayed the night last tuesday so we could go to the funeral together. well she was just getting over a cold (cough, sore throat, losing voice). somehow, i got it. though it did not kick in until saturday. so there i am saturday, coughin away with a sore throat.  i went to bed early hoping to be better when i woke up, plus i was up at the cottage, so i was tired anyway.  i woke up feeling fine, but could not talk.  it was pathetic.  that was sunday.  well today (monday) i had to work all day (8am-6pm).  and what do i do, oh yeah i answer phones.  so i basically got made fun of all day.  if i got a nickle for every time someone said "oh it sounds like you got a cold" or "oh have you caught something" or "do you have larangitis?" id be rich.  damn that got annoying! but what can ya do right? anyway, im tired and whatnot from working all day.  so i think im about to turn in! i almost forgot, one good thing about today, my friend from virginia told me he is coming to visit in less than 2 weeks! i cant wait.  i have seen him in almost 6 months! i miss him so this should be great.  he made my day when he told me that! well im gonna get goin!   *MUAH* to all of you...PEACE!
