      Good Morning to all.  It was an amazing week in Montana.  Got to see everyone and really enjoyed being back in the Big Sky State.  As I was driving one day I was looking up at the sky, a huge blue scape dwarfing the mountains, and I started wondering about the orgins of the saying Big Sky State.  Was it Native Americans?  Frontiersman?  Drunk Willow Creek Outdoorsman?  So I figured they were all sitting around racing thier ATV's, Horses, Buggies, there was a huge accident and they end up on the ground.   On a day a lot like the one I saw they looked up and said 'That there be a Big Sky,'  or 'That's a Big Sun-of-a-bitch' or something in native tounge lost in translation.  Either way I guess I had forgotten what it was I loved about that state until I saw that skyline again.  Anywhere you are you feel overwhelmed by the hugeness of blue contrast against towereing lodgepoll pine and the rivers snaking their way down through canyons of silver, copper and gold.  So for those of you who know I was up for that promotion, you will be happy to hear that I got it.  They came back to me yesterday with the offer and i accepted.  What a week it has been already.  So I start next week.

      Hey just quick note:  I am pretty jacked up about Garden State the Movie.  It is out in select theatres, which means it will never come to your area, but this looks worthy of the indy buzz it is getting.  The best part is  urlLink Zach Braffs' Blog .  I have been a big fan of his for the past couple of years while on scrubbs, and if that doesn't get you interested read a couple of his posts to his fans:   Responding personally: Many of you ask me to e-mail you personally. Please don't think I'm being a dick if I don't. I couldn't possibly e-mail everyone. That's what's so cool about this blog; it enables me to talk to all of you at once. But if I began to write to everyone individually, I'd never have time to wash myself. It's not that I fear that we'll get close, have an affair and then you'll freak out and boil my rabbit on the stove. I don't even have a rabbit, or a pot big enough to boil one in. I do have a stove; but no rabbit and no pot... irrelevant. Can't do it... rabbit or not.         Peace out.  See you all when i get back.........

      What is with all of these commercials I have been seeing lately. By the time it is over i am not even sure what the ficking product is that they are selling. Has anyone seen this new one with Serena Williams? Basically there are fifty of here hitting the tennis ball all around the court and the entire time the scene is flashing back and forth between some cheesy looking tinnis pro and a bunsh of 14 year old girls. it is by the end a confusing jumble of transitions and masculine references. Toward the end I feel like she is going to smash the guy in the nuts with a 115 mph serve. Then there is this Burger King Chicken ad going around the web. You can basically tell this chicken to do anything within reason and he will do it. Tell me again how this promotes Burger King? I want to meet whoever is in charge of their advertising budget. Where they all just sitting around one day and thought hey I have a novel Idea. Lets dress some jackass up like a  urlLink chicken  and make him stand in front of a couch doing crazy stuff. Yeah, Yeah will take him to my basement and totally dimoralize him then will post it on the web, so everyone else can do the same. On a different and Refreshing Note this is the best commercial I have seen in quite a while. ESPN view of  urlLink women's knowledge of sports.....
