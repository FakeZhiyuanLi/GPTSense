      Back in the CCU.  Last call of intern year.  No feelings of accomplishment nor feelings of relief.  Maybe i enjoy it. I don't know.  No admissions and four transfers.  Maybe we'll get killed tonight with admissions.  My health sucks.  Gotta eat better and workout vigorously. I'm seeing the dentist on Tuesday.  That should be fun.

      Livning on borrowed time.  That is what he said.  I would never be so callous to utter such words in a place where people are supposed to get better.  You'll find all kinds out there.

      Feels like old times.  Back on summer vacation.  I am ending intern year much in the same way i started it.  Chillin and still collecting a paycheck.  My intern year ran the spectrum of difficulty.  Sometimes as difficult as any in the country and then, the next month, easy as a summer breeze.      Considering going on a trip but have no one to go with.  I am not too gung ho on leaving either.  I am taking the opportunity to read a bit and catch up on all the dumb things i like to do like watch tv and sleep.  Maybe ill go somewhere though.  Just to tell pepople i did something.

      Glad I'm done with clinical medicine.  I actually enjoyed the CCU to some extent but on the last day, memorial day, my aggravation hit an all time high.  I had problems with the nurses and problems with the resident.  I have never been so happy to leave a place behind.  Doing ortho for about 4 days which is nice.  The first two days were cancelled because the doc was on vacation.  So i too had a mini-vaca as well.  I went to see a movie and went to ny to check out the hayden planetarium, central park, and a b'way show.  Slyfox with dreyfus, stoltz, bronson pinchot, and elizabeth berkely from showgirls fame.  It was good.  Today i was in the OR.  It was fun for about one hour and then it got boring.  Gotta start planning the move down to south jersey.  Movin' is always a pain in the ass.

      Its already July, the month of my bro's b-day and doc's wedding.  I have completed the move to camden with relatively few hitches.  Packing was painful but not terrible.  I am now an expert at dismantling IKEA furniture.  Putting it back together is a different story. I drove a 10 foot truck from Clifton to Camden and it was quite an easy drive.  I didn't even mind it b/c Stern was on the radio.   Since my last post i have been to south beach for 3 days and northern cali for four.  Two great trips which really made my time off feel like a vacation.   Rads will begin next week.  I have completed two days of relatively painless orientation.  No "stand up and tell us your name" business, just fillin paperwork and gettin shit done.  The other rads residents are cool.  I think it will be a productive and enlightening four years.  I am excited.
