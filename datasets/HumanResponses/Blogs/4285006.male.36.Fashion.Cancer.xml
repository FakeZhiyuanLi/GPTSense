      WELL...  I was totally off this weekend, but was so beyond exhausted I couldn't even enjoy it; I couldn't even stand being around myself.  I took da boyz to the Mart of Wal yesterday, and I wanted to scream my head off.  Mom drove, and we even went to the 'nicer' Wally, 5 miles out of our way.  HAHAHAHAHAHA, WHAT A JOKE!  There is simply nothing nice about Walmart; it's hellish no matter how you slice it.  Smelly, freaky, loud, confusing, SCARY!  I'm seriously thinking of going to another supermarket and paying more just to avoid it.  Now that's scary!  Ever dream you could put your boss over your knee and spank his/her ass HARD?  Some bosses would definitely benefit from the experience, especially ones who are so friggin' high & mighty... ones who love to create chaos just because they can... ones who love to torture their employees and watch them wriggle in pain... AM I VENTING HERE?!?!  I would love to take out my Magik Wand and make CERTAIN bosses choke on it!!  ;o)  (Not mine, mind you.)  I downloaded some Scissor Sisters for Tink, and he's his usually gooey gratefully self.  He's actually the one who introduced me to Blogspot.  GO TINK!!!  Just some things I HATE: Britney Spears    Barbra Streisand     Liza Minnelli     Country music     Racism/Homophobia     Rednecks     Ignorance     Guns     Violence  My favourite things: Donna Summer     Madonna     Kristine W.     George Michael     RuPaul     Sarah Brightman     Annie Lennox     Lisa Stansfield     Pet Shop Boys     Scissor Sisters     Julie Andrews     The Gay Pimp     Dance music     Buffy The Vampire Slayer     Six Feet Under     Queer As Folk     Queer Eye For The Straight Guy     The Bionic Woman     Lord Of The Rings     Star Wars     Deepdiscountdvd.com     IMDB.com     PerfectBeat.com     Disney     Playstation 2 ..................................... GOD, AND THERE'S SO MUCH MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     OK, I'm tired.  Peace, Love & Hair Grease, Peppy

      OK, I might just OD' on this blog thing.  I just posted my pic, and I must say one word: FAHHHHBLISSSS!  I am absolutely out of control today.  I have 'Summer Stock' on right now, as promised, and I just can't help but sit here & wonder how many of the male actors/dancers in it were gay.  It must be the short trousers & white socks that are doing it to me.  Gene Kelly was always too dang cute to be str8, and Miss G. was reportedly a big lezbean herself, so one can only imagine how much homo-luvvin' was goin' on BEHIND (pun intended) the set/scenes.  Betty Garrett is still alive (and like 90-something)... B!TCH NEEDS TO WRITE A TELL-ALL ACCOUNT!!   Forget your troubles, come on, get happy   The Lord is waitin' to take your hand   Sing hallelujah, come on, get happy   We're headed for the promised land!     Can't wait until that sequence comes up!  It's so... PINK!  Ooh, that gives me an idea: I'm gonna put 'Funny Face' on when this one is finished!  LOVE Audrey Hepburn, even though wooden man Astaire is a total snore.  Maybe I'll just skip around & watch the more fabulous parts of the film...  Toodles, y'all!!!  Pepper D'Lite

       OK, da boyz & I are sittin' here watching Miss Garland &amp; Crew ham it up (sorry, but the Wicked Witch is the REAL Diva here), and was reviewing what I posted last nite, and OMG... SOMEBODY SEND ME SOME CHEESE & CRACKERS 2 GO WIT DAT WHINE!  I apologize to anyone who subjected themself to that literary vomit.      I just read on PerfectBeat.com that old school disco is making a comeback, and, all of a sudden, I'm feeling rather perky & optimistic (and I'm not even eating any Gummy Bearkin).  The fact that I'm off this weekend isn't hurting my mood either.  If you're inclined towards dance music, PLEASE check out "In & Out" by Scent, "Lola's Theme" by Shapeshifters, "I Like It" by Narcotic Thrust and "Put 'Em High" by Stonebridge.  FAHHHHHHHBLISS!!!!!  (Yes, my very own special combination of fabulous & bliss, done in real Diva style.)       I think today's going to be a Happy Movie Day... I'm yanking every musical & comedy I own and popping it in the DVD player.  For some reason, I'm really in the mood for more Judy Garland.  I think my old VHS of 'Summer Stock' will get some big play today!  Sh!t, now I'm making myself wanna vomit!  I simply cannot understand why so many people dislike the uber-talented Frances Gumm.  I mean, look past all the drama & booze &amp; drugs and what pure talent!  Radiant is the word, really; she just glows with talent in every scene she ever put on film.  Anyway, enough Gumminess for one day.  Just DARE me to pull my wig in a box down off the shelf & put Hedwig on!  ;o)      Smooch,   Pep In Da Step

       Today was HELL.  Just when I thought work was calming down, all hell broke loose again.  One of the other Managers at my store, Miss Traila Trash herself, quit today, no notice, no new job, nuttin'.  I hate to say I saw it coming, but, like, I did, and can anyone say STUPID?!?!  Talk about a fish outta water (pun intended); she'd be better working at a store where the style of the clothing is determined by which kind of animal you're killin' for suppah.      Two words (OK, maybe four): I HATE MY JOB!  I was so looking forward to taking other trash out today, but my insipid Assistant Store Manager screwed that royally.  Mr. Pimp Daddy has needed to be let go for the past year, but, slick as he is, has managed to circumvent the system... NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY!!  All I can say is that you can dress it up & make it look pretty, but trash will always be trash.  And I am tired of doing my fcuking job, being totally responsible at all times and watching other people walk around being totally useless.  And what was I saying about justice last night?  Well, today, there was NONE.      We had a major sale today which I have been in mad prep/sweat mode for the past few days, and not a damned soul turned up for it.  And I'm talkin' full-page ad here.  So, needless to say, my Store Manager was a fcukin' wreck.  I am so glad I am off this weekend.  I think I'm takin' da boyz to see that Anime flick, Ya Bang Booty! (or somethin' like dat).  Freudian slippage?  PURRRHAPS!      Tink called me Pepper last nite (because of the pepper sprayin' shoplifter), and I really like it.  Suits my personality, too.  I'm thinkin' bout stickin' wit it.  Too bad I can't fcukin' stick to my diet... I'm slowly slipping out of my 36" waist back into the nasty 38".  There's something about the summer that makes me not want to eat well.  Plus, this damned town depresses me.  I never knew how living in the Bible Belt would affect me psychologically... they need to rename it the Bible Truss.  It's like a huge, suffocating gaseous cloud that just sucks the air out of your lungs and all individuality out of your brain.  Plus, my mom being Miss Psycho Right-Wing B!tch is really painful to deal with.  Well, back to NYC soon... I hope.      Dassit 4 now.      Hugz, Pepper

       OK, premiere blog... I AM FEELING PRESSURE  AND  PAIN, DOCTOR!!!      Lessee... today was a really LOOOONNNNNNGGGG day.  OK, see, I work in a department store and I had to go to court for a shoplifter who pepper-sprayed me back in December (merry fcuking Christmas to you, too) and this was the FOURTH appearance by moi with her no-showing the past three times.  NOT FUN.  OK, so Ms. Thang shows up in there with her wig sittin' all up crooked on her head, her Buckwheat fro hangin' out da back and I was like ROLLING (not literally, I had to kept it all inside).  The top was all smooth & silky and like BURGANDY, and the rest was just black & nappy.  A TOTAL KODAK MOMENT.  So anyway, Ms. Thang waived her right for an attorney, musta hit da crack pipe too hard before she made her Divappearance, and sailed her way into the big house for 12o days.  $10,000 bond on her, too.  God, I love when justice is served.  God Bless America!  Now all I have to do is pray her homies don't come hunt me down and like kill me.  It's the petty things we worry about in life, really.
