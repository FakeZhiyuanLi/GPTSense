      Peace be upon you...  Wah siong ah... 3 meetings almost back-to-back today.. Not to mention the Friday prayers as well.. Really rushing things through and that just took nearly as half of my life away.... Wonder why they're called meetings when actually they can be called talkings...??  Anyway, the last meeting (more like briefing) today at MUIS (Islamic religious Council of Singapore) is about an Empowerment project for the less unfortunate Muslim families that will be launching pretty soon. I'm not complaining because it's gonna be more work (hey, these people have God-given rights to be protected, as ordained in the Holy Qur'an); it's just that we don't enough people/staff to take care of the 40 families assigned to the mosque, oh boy, let's just wait what my board members have to say about this....  Actually, it's not that bad working with "people/family with special needs (FSNs)" as MUIS calls them. You just need to be patient with them, talk nicely to them and reassure them that we're doing something to help them. Most would be happy to receive any form of assistance especially in terms of money; some are very persistent too and some are well, too dependent on the hand-outs. But there are others who prefer to suffer quietly and choose not to beg or ask for help even though there's provisions made for them.   In Maslow's theory of needs, they're the ones who need to satisfy their physiological needs: getting food on the table everyday, not that most of them don't try their best. It's just the vicious circle; and I pray that my family or generation would not fall into that.   Working with FSNs teaches a lot about the reality of life. Singapore might be a rich country but there are segments of people who still are in need of help. It teaches us to be grateful of the blessings we've always been enjoying and have always taken for granted; I'm counting the blessings I get. No matter how big you might be earning; the money earned is just God's trust to you to be spent wisely; on the family and on charity, and there's a small portion out of which is to be given to certain groups of people. And 2.5% is not exactly much; even then there are conditions attached before tithe becomes compulsory for the Muslim.  I thought originally, I want to lament on today's hard work, but I ended up giving a mini-lecture on one of the 5 pillars of Islam: zakat. But who cares; I'm just thinking aloud, though I must say that most probably I would not be able to utter it out fluently in a recognised human language. Oh well, a Peaceful Phlegmatic prefers to mumble....  (21 Jumadil-uulaa 1425H)

      Assalamu'alaikum wrt wbt once again,  Now I've found the "key" to change this Blog of mine, I feel so engrossed; not in adding the blogs, but to make the page much nicer and friendlier than the original one. Oh do comment if you want to suggest something better for this page. I'm getting the hang of JAVAscript.  Must be wondering why I have so many pictures of children in this WeBlog right?  - Are these kids my own? (Fat hope, I'm not even married yet, but I would like them to be like that, if Allah Wills it.) - Am I a paedophile you might think? (Haha, I love children but not to that abnormal extreme!)  No, I got this inspiration from one of my fav personalities: Bro Yusuf Islam. Brother as in brother-in-Islam, not because he's related or anything. One of his songs (when he was still called Cat Stevens) is "Where Do The Children Play". The song's typical of Cat Stevens; with just vocals accompanied bu a guitar.  It's amazing how a person can make a 180-degrees turn in lifestyle; and masya-Allah, he's making use of his talents to share the beauty of Islam with the Muslims and non-Muslims alike. I especially like his works in areas concerning the children (I Look I See is a must-hear); they are the future of our generation and we need to to teach them in order to perpetuate the good values that Islam has brought for mankind.  urlLink     Children are innocent creations of Allah, they're born pure like white sheets of fabric; it's up to the parents to colour them; either to remain pure white as Muslims; or taint them with spots, blotches and splashes of God-heedlessness.  Which makes me afraid, what if it is my turn to have children? Will I be able to bring them up the way that please Allah and the Prophet? Or will they turn out like the countless teens I meet along the road on my way to elsewhere, who knows no shame in uttering vulgarities and rude words, unmentionable indecency, etc.?  We have to start making efforts to improve ourselves and start to change the young ones especially those of our own, and pray to Allah for the best, so that our succeeding generation will not be the generation as prophesized as people of the last hour; people who live just before the end of time......

      Here's the lyric of one song I'd like to share; it's a personal reminder for myself & for others too...  Fortunate Is He  Fortunate Is he Who remembers Allah abundantly Worldly distractions cannot mildly sway  His thoughts of Allah and Judgement Day  Righteous is he Who bows to One he cannot see  Whose deeds do not spring without Bismillah Fulfilling his tasks with perfect Taqwa  Devout is he Who supplicates to Allah intensely Whose heart is merciful, tender and kind His gaze on life after this world behind  Prosperous is he Who spends his wealth on the poor and needy Who speaks a kind word to kin and neighbour Ever-grateful for Allah's favours  Guided is he Who praise Allah with punctuality Early morning Tahajjud he prays For Allah's Pleasure and Nearness he craves  God-fearing is he Who contemplates death early Who starts as he sees his demise And tears fall over wasted sacrifice  Blessed is he  Who sings Allah's Praises fervently  Blessed be all of Allah's slaves Allah's mercy be with them always  Song by Zain Bikha

      I'm a fool in this no man's land. A Peaceful Phlegmatic one too.  Try as I might to squeeze out whatever HTML or C-language programming that I'd learnt a few years ago, I can't even decode the HTML template for this WebLog. Seems like even CZ1101 can't even save me from this predicament. Mine's gonna be a dull, boring blog with just my stupid comments to decorate my Web....  Hmm.... maybe trial and error is a good method to try..... then again it could turn out disastrous; then it could turn out to be more work to salvage this humble page of mine...  Oh, in case you still don't understand, a Peaceful Phlegmatic will procrastinate just to avoid the extra work that he can foresee in the future. We're good forecasters you see. Damn good ones... We can smell work like from days or months away.... We'll make "efforts" to shun away from work if possible. But it's inevitable if you have a Powerful Choleric mother running the show at home. Not that I hate my mother; I just hate the extra work, you know, clearing things out, tidying and wiping dust away. I betcha I can still find my A-Level notes in my drawer.....  I love being Peaceful Phlegmatic; but is there anyone out there who can motivate me?

      This song marked a turning point in my life, way way back then. "Kekasih" here literally means "lover" or "the loved one", but it actually refers to God, and the song is about the prayer of a person who's longing to be back with his Creator. I'm sorry for those who don't understand Malay, but it's a song really close to my heart...  kepadaMu Kekasih (lagu M Nasir, lirik Hattan/Eunosasah)  kepadaMu Kekasih aku berserah kerana kutahu Kau lebih mengerti apa yang terlukis di cermin wajahku ini bersama amali  kepadaMu Kekasih aku bertanya apakah Kau akan menerima kukembali atau harus menghitung lagi segala jasa dan bakti atau harus mencampakku ke sisi tanpa harga diri  hanya padaMu Kekasih aku tinggalkan jawapan yang belum ketemukan yang bakal aku nantikan bila malam menjemputku lena beradu  kepadaMu Kekasih aku serahkan jiwa dan raga jua segalanya apakah Kau akan menerima penyerahan ini apakah Kau akan menerimaku dalam keadaan begini

      Assalamu'alaikum wrt wbt (May peace be upon you)  Alhamdulillah (all praises be to Allah), I've decided to try my hands on this blogging thingie. Not sure whether I'll get hooked onto such fad; but it seems like a trend to note down one's personal thoughts and feelings for potentially millions of people to see.... It's like hanging out your laundry in the middle of Orchard Road, for the passers-by to see whether your shirt, pants or underwear has holes in them... But then again it's a place to talk it out for me, release tension; after a long day at work...  Well, insya-Allah (if God Wills), I'd continue writing; if not then, it'd just another blog entry among the millions already on the Net.  Wassalam.   Erwan (16 Jumadul-ulaa 1425H)

      Peace to you all people!       There is this colleague of mine who shared this info: Mosques are taller than any other buildings in the world including the Petronas Tower in KL, in fact, they're the tallest buildings in the world. Why?       Ans: Because the minarets always reach the moon and the star. (That's because they always have a crescent and a star on top)  PS: This is meant for people to have a different look at things only, some say it's a only joke. Albert Einstein and other physicists would say "Everything is relative", which is almost correct except that only Allah is the Absolute.

      Found this while checking out the photos in DACC's yahoogroup:      Prayer (solat)&nbsp;is the pillar of faith, whomsoever guards his prayer (ie. perform his 5 daily solat on time without fail), verily he has guarded his faith... (Hadeeth)   'Afwan Khairul, Firdaus & Shadiq; for "borrowing" your faces.   (BTW, this picture's copyrighted under DACC and Farhan Abd Rahim (everythink17@hotmail.com).

      Peace be upon whoever's reading this...   Yesterday, I attended a  walimah  (wedding reception) of my Secondary school friend, Dudi Arfan; and I got to know about it from another friend just a few hours before the wedding dinner itself. It's not really a surprise: I met Dudi a few months ago at the MRT station and he told me he's getting married very soon and wanted to invite me (so I gave him my card). He might have misplaced the card or forgotten all about it over the the distractions of preparing for his big day.   For someone I know for about 4 years, it's wonderful that he settles down much more quickly than me. Yeah, who would expect Dudi to be a police officer and then got married first?   The event was also a time for me to meet up with other friends from the BPGHS, people like Faizal, Faizad, Kaijie, Man-tat, Botak, Tien-Ann, Faizul, Khairuni, Salina, etc. (truthfully I can't remember many of their names). Faizad's getting married next week (surprise surprise) and he was like handing out this one wedding invitation card that he has to everyone, and telling us to write down the address and time and date.   Cindy Tay already got hitched and Salina's married with one and a half child; she was at Dudi's wedding with her husband. Khairuni got married last year and is expecting his first child in October; I also heard that a few of my Chinese friends also getting married soon (namely Liyan &amp; Ah Bao - these two people, and I think Bee-chuan is already married); and the rest of us were like gasping and feeling the "pressure". Surprises after surprises.... It's a pity that I didn't bring my camera though..   Well, I think I've outgrown all these. There was a time when my usrah-mates were like settling down, one by one; and we started counting how many got married and then after a while, when more than half were already married, the trend was reversed: counting the number of people in our usrah who are still single. That leaves like me and 3 others.   Then after a while, after things has settled and no one else was getting married, the married ones were like extending their help to try to get each of us a wife: I kindly declined; I was too proud to admit that I actually need someone to help me find a partner. I wouldn't mind if my parents would help, but "no, you must find on your own" was my Mum's reply.   Yes, marriage is an important aspect in a Muslim life and we're encouraged to marry early. But everyone is different and has different priorities: some are still struggling to be stable (as in my case) while others are determined to finish their studies first. Ultimately, it's up to the individual to decide when is the best time to share his life with another person... It's a life-long choice and should not be one to be regretted.       Life will still go on and each of us will face different challenges in our own lives. It's our level of faith and hope in God that will help in overcoming them.

      Arrgggghhh!!! One more week to go, so much work to accomplish and I haven't even got my list of things to bring to the long trip in order yet. Not to mention about getting a proper backpacking bag too....  urlLink

      Assalamu'alaikum,  Now I realise what the Beatles meant in one of their songs about "a man must break his back to earn his days of leisure".  Which is how I feel right now, after I lose count of number of meetings and appointments this week alone. Affected not just physically or mentally; but psychologically and emotionally too.  Some things are never meant to be resolved in the fastest possible time.  Work will always be there, as one of my many bosses told me; but delayed work means more work accumulated later. I wonder how much work would wait once I return from Africa..... But thanks to unpredicted positive circumstances, I actually got someone to partly cover my duties. At least I can worry less during the holidays. No HP call to disturb me and a whole new boundary to explore. Hmm, a lot of souvenirs to buy/"bribe" for my colleagues who have to spend about half-a-month handicapped with just 2/3 of the total admin strength.  Luckily the Wednesday management course had just ended this week too. Seems like things are opening their own way to allow me take this holiday. Be sure to stay tune to be updated on the fate of the unlucky pseudo-workaholic "me" in an attempt to hand over the 2-weeks work to a rookie and how he'll try to "tai-chi" things coming along the way. LOL!

      Assalamu'alaikum wrt wbt  I just can't stop feeling excited about this trip to a faraway place very soon, just hoping the visas get approved cos' the airtickets have been paid for.... Ahh... finally, a getaway to really get away from Singapore... time to think about what to do with my life... time to widen my experiences and perspectives... Wanna know where it is? Here's what I found about the country at the Lonely Planet website:   [Name of Country Purposely Taken Out]  Its list of attractions would do justice to a country twice its size. From the Roman-era hot springs at Hamman Mellegue to the space-age sets of Star Wars (parts of which were filmed at Matmata), its lush-to-lunar landscapes have seen more action than the New World nations combined.  Spend a few days here and you'll agree: daydreaming at the famous Roman ruins of Carthage and El-Jem is almost as good as stepping into Virgil's Aeneid and knocking one back with Dido, while a day's dawdling on the north coast's beaches will leave you wondering why Hannibal ever left.  Tourism remains very low-key throughout most of the country, though if you're looking for resort life you can find that too. Be it its capital's French-Arab culture collage or the Sahara's unthinkably massive expanse, you're going to be impressed with what you find in *******. After all, they've had 3000 years to prepare for your visit.  Full country name: Republic of ******* Area: 163,610 sq km Population: 9.92 million People: Arab-Berber (98%), European and Jewish Language: Arabic, French, English, German Religion: Islam, Christianity, Judaism Government: republic Head of State: President Zine el-Abidine ben Ali Head of Government: Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi  GDP: US$67 billion  GDP per capita: US$6,800 Annual Growth: 5% Inflation: 2.5% Major Industries: Petroleum, mining, tourism, textiles, footwear, food, beverages Major Trading Partners: EU, North African countries, Asia, US  Here's a nice place I would want to go to later; a colosseum in El-Jem to re-live "The Gladiator":  .    So guess where I'll be going insya-Allah.

      A'kum to all,  Talking abt mosque in the last posting, I think it's best to separate between a "fun fact" and the real fact.  We should be proud of our mosques; they're where Allah's Names are mentioned and praised many times a day.     This is  urlLink Assyafaah Mosque  in Sembawang; the newest addition to the 69 (and increasing) mosques in Singapore. Doesn't really look like the conventional mosque at a first glance.   Compare that to this 11th century mud-&-brick mosque in Mali, Africa:     Well how about the grand Hassan II Mosque in Morrocco, with the tallest minaret in the world:

      This is the pioneer batch of the Course: Certificate in Management of Non-Profit Organisation, jointly organised by SSA Consulting & Ngee Ann Polytechnic:  urlLink    They were my classmates and lecturers for the past 5 months at Jalan Masjid near Kembangan MRT Station. A few of them are my colleagues from other mosques, so we do meet up once in a while if there's any MUIS function or meetings. News has it that Mr Alwi wants to organise a fishing trip or get-together for the "Enam Jahanam" - the Dreaded Six (ie. the guys in the final group presentation). We've had such good fun and laughter; we shared jokes and funny stories during our project discussions.

      Assalamu'alaikum wrt wbt,  It feels so nice to be back home once again. That's right, I'm back from Tunisia after 2 weeks; still experiencing jet-lag and I'm wondering whether I can continue  work tomorrow. But stay tuned to read the daily journal of the Tunisian experience. Insya-Allah, will try to get more pictures and movies from my friend. Till then, ma'asalamah.
