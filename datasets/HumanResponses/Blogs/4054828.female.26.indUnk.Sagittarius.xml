      This weekend is Alumni Reunion Weekend at Marquette University--my alma mater.&nbsp; It's been five years since I graduated from college.&nbsp;    urlLink http://www.marquette.edu   I can't wait to catch up with some of my friends that I haven't seen in person in quite some time.&nbsp;

      Let's face it ... there's a lot of bad music out there.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp;   There's a guy out there who likes to go around to venues where certain musicians are playing (JUSTIN TIMBERLAKER, EVANESCENCE, LINKIN PARK, ADEMA, STAIND, etc.), and uses a megaphone to inform concert-goers that they have bad taste in music.&nbsp;&nbsp; He even has statistics to back up his claims.&nbsp;   There's a whole bunch of videos of him outside his venues on his website.&nbsp;   urlLink www.youhavebadtasteinmusic.com    This guy is my new hero ... preach on my brother, preach on.

      I work in the seemingly glamorous (but not always) field of public relations.&nbsp; Sometimes you get really great clients, sometimes you get some real nut jobs; sometimes your clients love you and sometimes they hate you.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, I wouldn't switch jobs for anything.   Anyway, I am working for a client who loves us and they actually do good things--it's an organization involved in increasing awareness about organ donation.   Now organ donation wasn't something I had ever really thought about.&nbsp; I always thought it would be a "nice to do when I die" kind of thing, but was never motivated to actually sign the back of my drivers license.   Boy have I changed my mind.&nbsp; Last week I was at a client event where I had the chance to meet both donor families and transplant recipients.&nbsp; These are among the most remarkable people I have ever met.&nbsp;   First the donor families--for some it's been a while since they received that phone call and rushed to the hospital to be by the bedside of a family member that was essentially dead.&nbsp; For some that phone call was more fresh in their memories.&nbsp; But, for all of them, being able to donate their relative's organs and tissues was a powerful act, often made under very difficult circumstances.&nbsp; Without fail, every single donor family said the decision was easy and has helped them heal.&nbsp;   The recipients--what a group.&nbsp; They're so full of life and energy.&nbsp; They're also tremendously grateful for the second chance they have been given.&nbsp; And they're going on to accomplish great things.&nbsp; Many were at one point in danger of dying, but then that phone call came and they got a new lease on life.   As I said, I am a changed person because of these people I was lucky to have met.&nbsp; The back of my license is signed and I am planning to talk with my family about my wishes.&nbsp; I've always been willing to help people wherever I can.&nbsp; I just want to make sure that I will be able to do so even when I am gone.

      We'll see how long I keep this pace up.   Anyway, may I be frank ... We've got to get rid of George W. Bush.&nbsp;   I was watching some of the Democratic&nbsp;Convention coverage last night.&nbsp; I saw Bill Clinton speak and was truly saddened when I thought about how Bush came into the White House and trashed eight years of hard work and progress with his narrow minded, self-serving policies that have done nothing but divide our nation.   &nbsp;  I would also like to link to an amusing little blog ... and remind everyone to&nbsp; do the goddamn Ronald!   urlLink http://whatwouldyousayraymond.blogspot.com/    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I am not sure why I am doing this.&nbsp; I tried to keep a diary when I was young, but that only lasted a week.&nbsp; See I was always afraid people would actually read what I wrote.&nbsp; Anyway ... I am looking at this as an excercise to get over my neuroses.&nbsp;   Carbon leaf is a band from Richmond, VA that I think is really good.&nbsp; Last week, after releasing five independent albums, they finally released an album with a label.&nbsp; Check 'em out ...    urlLink http://www.carbonleaf.com

      I think I may have mentioned my love for a little band called Carbon Leaf ... Here's some videos of them performing songs off their new album "Indian Summer."   urlLink DemoDaze Lounge   I cannot wait until they make it back to this part of the country so I can hear the songs off the new album live.  PS ... at 26 years old (almost 27) is it wrong to get a little weak in the knees and giggly over a musician?  See I have always loved musicians (especially singers in bands ... there's something about a man with a voice), and I guess I still do.

      I went to the Wisconsin State Fair yesterday and was intrigued by all of the  crap  you could by.  Slicers and dicers, chamois mops, jewelery cleaner, ginsu knives, cookware, glass cleaner ... all items as seen on TV.  I was maybe not so much intrigued by what was being sold, but by the salespeople.  I cannot imagine being enthusiastic enough about a product to travel into city after city for 7 to 14 day long fair/festival and shilling ginsu knives for 13 hours every day.  It's a funny sociological phenomenon to watch these salespeople turn on the charm when someone looks in their general direction.   But, I suppose it's a way to make a living.  I have always wondered how much stuff these guys are actually able to sell?

      See, I knew the novelty of blogging would wear off eventually. Anyway, I will try to be more consistent.  Well, the Olympics are coming up and actually I am kind of excited. While I am hopelessly unathletic, I very much enjoy watching others be athletic. I typically get sucked into watching hours of Olympic coverage ... And it's kind of fun to watch sports that you don't normally watch.  I actually got sucked into watching the X-Games on Sunday afternoon. It's actually quite fascinating to see people boarding and rising bicycles and motorbikes and flipping around in the air and defying gravity. I wonder what Newton would think.  Back to the Olympics ... I was wating this PBS documentary on the history of the Olympics late Sunday night (yes ... PBS ... nerd alert). It was actually very interesting. A lot of the pagentry we see today, such as the running of the torch culminating with the lighting of the flame and the Olympic rings, were things started during the 1936 Olympics in Berlin--an invention of the Nazi government. Quite interesting that we have forgotten about that.  Oh ... Dwayne Wade of the Miami Heat is on the Men's Olympic Basketball team.  Yay!  He was a star player on the Marquette University Basketball team (my alma mater).

      Thank goodness ... we're finally starting to see politicians and those involved in politics start to act, dare I say it,  human .  I work in public relations and I am paid to try and keep clients on message and God forbid, swearing on television or emiting a Howard Dean-like "yeeeeaaaahhhhh"out of excitement. I have an appreciation for all of the long hours press secreteries spend with the candidates, their wives and their children trying to get them to sound "Presidential."  But, by the same token, who among us hasn't told someone to "shove it" (or perhaps, like Dick Cheney, you've tols someone to reproduce with themselves). I know I certainly have. We shouldn't vilify someone for speaking their mind.  I am sure there are times when all of our great presidents--from Washington to Lincoln--have told someone to "shove it." It's just that they didn't have to deal with the prying microphones of the media.  Sure, there's something to be said for grace under fire, but from time to time, we all slip up ... politicians included.
