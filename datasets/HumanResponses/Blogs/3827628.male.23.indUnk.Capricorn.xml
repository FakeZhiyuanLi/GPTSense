        Here's an excerpt from a recent article by Commonweal, a Liberal "Catholic" Magazine:    urlLink I conclude that Catholics may support the legalization of same-sex marriages, together with the progressive disentanglement of sacramental marriage from state-sponsored contractual marriage.   "I CONCLUDE"???  Eh... last time I checked, Paul Griffiths wasn't the name of the Pope.  So why on earth is he giving his readers definitive statements on faith and morals?  Oh well... another example of a CLERICALIZED layperson giving their USELESS opinions!    urlLink It is likely that such support, together with the argument and clarification that would accompany it, would clarify Catholic teaching about marriage, help Catholics to live in accord with it, make it more attractive to non-Catholics, and so, in the end, conform the body politic more closely to Christ by making the church more seductively beautiful. This is a prudential judgment, of course, correctible and fallible like all such.   By allowing same-sex "marriage", this will make the Church more "seductively" beautiful?  Uh... yeah!  To a person who's smoking weed!  First off, don't use the word "seductive" and Church together.  You make the Church sound slutty!  Second of all, where's your common sense?  "It is likely that such support... would clarify Catholic teachings about marriage"?  Where's the logic in that?  It's like saying to your son "don't kill your next door neighbor", but giving him the gun to do so!  Lord have mercy!  If this article is the sign of how "progressive" the magazine is, I can't wait to see the magazine a decade from now!  Perhaps the future editors will be chimpanzees???

        For those of you who don't know, this guys's Fr. Richard McBrien... an infamous heretic.  One of his blasphemous offenses is supporting the theory that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene!!  He also supports heretical views such as women's ordination, rejecting the Perpetual Virginity of Our Blessed Mother, promoting that Christ didn't establish the Catholic Church, and supports dissenting organizations (ie: Call to Action).   You know what?  I'm feeling charitable today, so I thought I'd develop an exercise routine for Fr. McBrien.  As you can see from the picture, Fr. McBrien is pretty tubby (Probably due to his EXCESSIVE eating and LACK of exercise... tsk tsk!!) and we wouldn't want Fr. Richard McBrien to die from a heart attack. (Andrew grinning...Bad Andrew!  Bad Andrew!  Bad thoughts!)  So here's the routine I developed:  1) 10 minutes of stretching and aerobic exercise 2) 25-30 reps of barbell twists   3) 25-30 reps of Basic Crunch 4) 25-30 reps of Bicycle 5) 25-30 reps of Knee Raise 6) 25-30 reps of Knees up crunch 7) 25-30 reps of Side Bend 8) 25-30 reps of Twist Crunch   If Fr. Richard McBrien does this three times a week (including dieting), he'll have abs of steel like Sr. Joan Chittister!  (Though I doubt he'll look more MANLY than her!!!)   BTW, in case you're wondering who's Sr. Joan Chittister, she's another infamous heretic!  For more information about Sr. Joan and Fr. Richard, check out the following site:   urlLink Our Lady's Warriors

        Erggghh!!   Why can't liturgists stop twinking with the mass?!  Look at this abomination!  A picture of a clown mass!  DISGUSTING!!!     Here's an exerpt of the article:    urlLink Fr. Brian Joyce in clown vestments.... uhhhh the bald older gentleman in the clown "vestments," captured at the Gospel which was performed by the troupe and followed by a homily also performed by the troupe.  Not surprisingly, little, if anything, in Fr. Joyce's archived homilies gives joyful assent to authentic Catholic teaching. There were many offenses against Our Lord and His Magisterium at the CLOWN MASS, but one of the worst was when Fr. Joyce revelled in quoting his nun homilist (Why should Fr. Joyce obey the Church in dogma OR discipline?) from last week, Sr. Carol Zihn, who promoted the United Nations in her "Wisdom from the World" homily at Mass.  Fr. Joyce gleefully quoted Sr. Zihn at his CLOWN MASS (not archived on his webiste at the time of this writing): "All of the species of the world, except for our housepets and houseplants, would be better off tomorrow if mankind became extinct today -- and the housepets and houseplants would bounce back and be better off in a few years." Hmmmm, give me a moment here -- Prince of the World, Wisdom of the World, United Nations, United Nations Family Planning and forced abortions and sterilzations, better off without mankind, Sr. Carol Zihn, Fr. Brian Joyce, Bishop John Cummins.

        Finally!  Someone's taking some legal action against John Kerry!  (YIPEE!)  Let's just pray John Kerry repents for his grave actions!  Anywayz, anyone interested in joining the class-action law suit, please check out the following site:   urlLink www.defide.com      urlLink A Catholic lawyer has filed heresy charges against Sen. John Kerry with the Archdiocese of Boston, accusing the Democratic presidential candidate of bringing "most serious scandal to the American public" by receiving Holy Communion as a pro-choice Catholic.  The 18-page document was sent to the archdiocese June 14, but released to the public only yesterday by Marc Balestrieri, a Los Angeles-based canon lawyer and an assistant judge with the Archdiocese of Los Angeles' tribunal, an ecclesiastical court.   "Heresy is a public, ecclesiastical crime," said Mr. Balestrieri, 33, whose complaint is posted at www.defide.com. "It affects entire communities. It is one of the greatest sins you can commit."   If the Boston Archdiocese, which is refusing comment on the case, decided to press heresy charges, the Massachusetts senator could be excommunicated.   "My goal is his repentance, not excommunication," Mr. Balestrieri said. The charges do not seek monetary damages.

        urlLink Article    July 09, 2004, 9:19 a.m. Controlling China The U.S. Congress should not fund state-mandated abortions.  By Harry Wu  Today, we expect the U.S. Congress to vote on an amendment to restore funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). This would, in turn, restore U.S. funding to UNFPA programs in China, where women are not allowed to freely give birth and are subjected to forced abortion and sterilization. This one-child policy is the most pervasive human-rights violation in China today: It should not be sponsored, and cannot be encouraged, by the United States.  The UNFPA argues that it must cooperate with the Chinese government to help improve the reproductive health of Chinese women and children. But as published, China's newly promulgated State Family Planning Law is a violation of human rights as outlined by the U.N. Charter, UNDHR (Universal Declaration of Human Rights), and the Cairo Declaration, to all of which China is a signatory. Each of these documents clearly states that family planning should be the responsibility of individuals.   Family planning, in the true sense of the term, should be encouraged the way that family planning is universally accepted throughout the international community. Its concept, defined in the World Population Plan of Action as adopted at the United Nations Bucharest Session, is: "All couples and individuals have the basic right to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so." In contrast, family planning enforced in China is actually "State-Controlled Mechanized Reproduction of Children": "Individuals" and "husbands and wives" are replaced with "the state," and "family planning" becomes "the state decides how many children a family may have, and at spacing in accordance with economic development."   According to the Population and Family Planning Law of the People's Republic of China, "Under China's family-planning policy each couple may have only one child; in rural areas a couple may have a second child if the first child happens to be a girl; a national minority couple may have two children. All births must be approved in advance, with the state allotting birth quotas in a unified way; children in all areas of the nation should be borne by the quotas allotted for the given year; offenders shall be punished." This Chinese version of family planning — thoroughly manipulated by the state — deprives Chinese citizens of fundamental rights.  In China, with few exceptions, only married couples who obtain advance approval — i.e., a birth permit — may legally have a child, even if it is their first child. A majority of Chinese women are forced to use intrauterine devices (IUDs). Violators, if discovered to be pregnant, are often forced to have abortions. Most violators of the one-child policy are forced to undergo sterilization. Doctors who do not perform IUD insertion or sterilization, or who fake these operations, are jailed. Family members of violators are often jailed if they do not reveal a violator's whereabouts. Other common "punishments" of violators include heavy fines and the destruction of property, and even infanticide. Despite relaxation of certain aspects of China's family-planning regulations, enforcement of the one-child policy continues to be coercive.   Every year, the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS) receives thousands of applications for asylum from victims of China's coercive population-control measures. Congress views China's one-child policy as a form of persecution and mandated that the BCIS set aside 1,000 visas per year specifically for its victims. China is the only nation whose citizens are eligible for asylum based on population-control-related persecution.  The UNFPA states that birth targets and quotas were lifted in the 32 Chinese counties supported by its programs. It also notes a "shift from an administrative family planning approach to an integrated, client-oriented reproductive health approach in the project counties." We have heard charges that the UNFPA has provided computers and vehicles to the Chinese government to enforce China's family-planning policy. Regardless of what has taken place in the 32 counties the UNFPA operates in, they constitute only about one percent of China's more than 3,000 counties. There is no major change taking place in China, and these 32 counties are being used as a showcase by the Chinese government. By cooperating with Beijing, the UNFPA is allowing itself to be used as a model example, when what is being carried out throughout the rest of China is a draconian policy infringing on the rights of the individual.  A typical example of the continued implementation of harsh family-planning measures throughout China involves the case of Jieshi Township in Guangdong Province. After the introduction of the "Population and Birth Control Law" on September 1, 2002, Chinese authorities declared that all family-planning violators would be fined a so-called "social alimony" fee instead of being subjected to other punishments. There have been various unwritten rules for how family-planning violators should be punished, as described above. The implementation of these different forms of punishment has varied in locations throughout China. While each location has attempted to carry out measures in the spirit of the central government's policy, each has had its own measures to prevent "illegal births."  The Laogai Research Foundation recently obtained a document — "Document No. 43" — from Jieshi. It shows how the local government has harshly implemented China's family-planning law. Jieshi, located in the northern part of Lufeng City, has an area of 124 km and a population of 200,000. The document (issued on August 26, 2003) gave orders that "the fall 2003 family planning assignment should begin on August 26, and within 35 days (ending on September 30), certain goals must be achieved: to sterilize 1,369, fit 818 with an IUD, induce labor for 108, and carry out 163 abortions. During this period, each five days there should be a count and each ten days there should be an evaluation, and there must be a 100 percent success rate. Party secretaries and village heads who failed to fulfill this task would have their salaries cut by half, and other responsible cadres would suffer the withholding of their entire salary."  One regulation in Document No. 43 stipulates: "Sterilized women will be compensated with 50 yuan, and women who undergo late-term abortions will be compensated with 300 yuan." The document also demands "in the countryside, sterilization for all women with two girls, and induced labor for late-term pregnancy. Overcome difficulties with creativity, so that all fall actions can be implemented successfully, and the ground can be set for yearly population control planning." In the spirit of the document, the leaders of the township asked all villagers to be vigilant and to denounce all "unlawful" pregnancies and births.  Even after the supposedly more moderate "Population and Birth Control Law" was promulgated in 2002, it is clear from this Jieshi document that harsh family-planning-implementation methods have not changed.  China's coercive population control — approved and celebrated by the UNFPA — is too terrible to be ignored, and we must not turn a blind eye to this problem. Denying the UNFPA congressional funding may encourage the U.N. to stand by its stated principles and to tell the Chinese government to end its coercive family-planning policies.  It is true that the UNFPA has implemented some positive programs in developing countries throughout the world that benefit women and their families. However, we must stand on the side of the millions of Chinese women who lack the fundamental human right to freely bear children. If Congress and the UNFPA are truly forces for voluntarism, human rights, and progress in China, they will do the same.  — Harry Wu is the executive director of the Laogai Research Foundation.

        urlLink      But its full text, which was published Saturday in the Italian newspaper L'Expresso, contains much stronger language than Cardinal McCarrick used last month at a meeting of the country's Catholic bishops near Denver.      Cardinal McCarrick's nuanced speech during the meeting from June 14 to 19 paraphrased the Ratzinger letter to say that the Vatican had left the issue of Communion in the hands of the U.S. bishops.      As the chairman of a task force on Catholic Bishops and Catholic Politicians, it was his job to convey what Vatican officials had told him during meetings in Rome.      "I would emphasize that Cardinal Ratzinger clearly leaves to us as teachers, pastors and leaders WHETHER to pursue this path" of denying Communion, Cardinal McCarrick told the bishops in his speech, the text of which is posted at the U.S. bishops' Web site, on www.usccb.org.      "The question for us is not simply whether denial of Communion is possible, but whether it is pastorally wise and prudent," the cardinal said.      As a result, bishops voted 183-6 on a compromise statement allowing each bishop to decide whether to give Communion to pro-choice politicians.      Before the meeting, 15 bishops had released statements suggesting that pro-choice politicians refrain from taking the Eucharist, and four bishops forbade such politicians from doing so.      However, the Ratzinger letter says that denial of Communion is obligatory "regarding the grave sin of abortion or euthanasia."      Cardinal Ratzinger also says a priest should warn "the person in question" of the consequences, including the denial of Communion.      If "the person in question, with obstinate persistence, still presents himself to receive the Holy Eucharist, the minister of Holy Communion must refuse to distribute it," Cardinal Ratzinger wrote.      The letter's last paragraph also takes on Catholics who vote for candidates because of their pro-choice stance.      "If he were to deliberately vote for a candidate precisely because of the candidate's permissive stand on abortion and/or euthanasia," that Catholic too "would be guilty of formal cooperation in evil and so unworthy to present himself for Holy Communion," it reads.     Tsk tsk tsk!  Looks like McCarrick is pushing his liberal agenda again.  Oh well... thank goodness we have AWESOME bishops like Archbishop Raymond Burke!

        urlLink  ''Vatican II is very clear. There is something called freedom of conscience in the Catholic Church," Kerry told the Telegraph Herald of Dubuque in a story in its Sunday editions. ''I oppose abortion, personally. I don't like abortion. I believe life does begin at conception. But I can't take my Catholic belief, my article of faith, and legislate it on a Protestant or a Jew or an atheist . . . who doesn't share it. We have separation of church and state in the United States of America."   Here's another example of Kerry's "wishy-washy" politics!  First of all, he misinterpreted the Vatican document.  If he read his Catechism CORRECTLY, it states that the conscience MUST be in union with the Church's teachings!  Second, he picks and chooses which teaching he wants to follow (Another cafeteria-Catholic).  Yes, the Church teaches about the "primacy of conscience".  However, the Church also teaches that supporting abortion is a MORAL evil, and carries the canonical penalty of excommunication.  Seems to me that Kerry needs to retake his Catechism classes. :**(

        urlLink  Washington, DC (LifeNews.com) -- The Catholic University of America continues to come under fire from abortion advocates and the NAACP after the college prevented students from organizing an official campus chapter of the nation's oldest civil rights group. CUA officials cite the NAACP's pro-abortion position and the existence of two other minority-oriented groups.  On Friday, about 40 students protested at the university carrying signs such as "Is C-U-A the last plantation?"  NAACP officials, supported the protesters and said that CUA's decision amounts to a quota system.  Last month, CUA and NAACP officials met to discuss the situation. Though both sides met to discuss the impasse, an agreement could not be reached.  Rev. David M. O'Connell, president of CUA, attended the June meeting and told the Associated Press that two other groups already exist on campus that promote civil rights but not abortion.    That's right!  You tell them Davie! :)  Over the last two decades, the face of the NAACP has dramatically changed.   It was once a powerhouse for Black Americans.  Now, it's a powerhouse for Liberal WASPs!

        urlLink  This week, FTM looks at a number of related liturgical issues, starting with a news report that the Holy See is about to expand the indult for the Tridentine Mass.   On Sunday June 18, the U.K.'s Catholic Herald reported that the Holy See is about to "relax the rules" on the Tridentine Mass because bishops have not been "generous" in allowing its use.  According to the report by Freddy Gray, "Cardinal Castrillon Hoyos. prefect of the Congregation for Clergy, told The Latin Mass, America's leading traditionalist magazine, that the Vatican was preparing to issue a 'juridical guarantee' in favor of the Tridentine rite, which was the Church's official rite from the 16th century until 1962.   "Cardinal Hoyos' remarks are a clear indication that Rome wants to embrace traditionalists by ensuring that they can attend old rite Masses if they so wish. The cardinal praised the Tridentine rite, and acknowledged the growing numbers of traditionalist Catholics, before giving cause to hope that restrictions on the old rite might be lifted....  "Cardinal Hoyos said: 'The idea is constantly growing that it has become necessary to provide for the concession of the indult in a broader fashion that would correspond more with the reality of the situation. It is thought that the times are mature for a new and clearer form of juridical guarantee of that right, which has already been recognized by the Holy Father with the 1988 indult.'  "He explained that the cardinals, and the bishops of Ecclesia Dei, a pontifical commission set up to oversee the implementation of the indult, have all studied the matter carefully, and are trying to thrash out the best possible solution.   John Medlin, development manager for the Latin Mass Society, said he was excited by the cardinal's comments. 'Rome is signaling that it is prepared to use the transcendent nature of the traditional Mass as a standard to rein in the abuse in the new rite,' he said. 'We are beginning to hear the death knell of liberalism in the Church and not before time'....."

        urlLink  French Muslims defy school headscarf ban   Paris, Jul. 05 (CWNews.com) - A large Islamic activist group last week urged Muslim schoolgirls to defy a new French law that bans the wearing of the traditional headscarf, but French officials warned the group on Monday not to provoke them.   The Union of French Islamic Organizations last week offered free legal aid to any girl expelled from school for wearing the headscarf, which many Muslims see as a religious obligation for women. The law passed this past year will go into effect in September and bans the wearing of any item by students that they see as challenging France's official secularism.    IMHO, if France continues with their intolerance policies, they will never have TRUE religious freedom.

        urlLink Woman in China Killed for Distributing Bibles   BEIJING, JULY 5, 2004 (Zenit.org).- Vatican Radio reported the "brutal killing" in prison of a 34-year-old woman arrested in China for distributing Bibles.   Jiang Zingxiu was imprisoned June 18 for distributing the Bibles to people on the streets of Guizhu province, in southwest China.   The woman died from the blows she received while in prison, Vatican Radio reported today.   The state-run newspaper Legal Daily reported that the woman was imprisoned for "inciting social disorders."   Tan Dewei, Jiang's mother-in-law, arrested with her daughter-in-law and then released, said that during the questioning the agents repeatedly struck Jiang.   The police handed the body over to the family, saying that Jiang died from a sudden attack.   AsiaNews said that China only allows a limited number of Bibles to be published each year. Bibles may not be sold in bookstores.    Most Holy Spirit, continue to strengthen the Church in China!

          Since it's creation, the Anglican Church has gradually turned away from Christian Truths.  During the last couple of decades, the Anglican Church has come close to turning away from Christianity altogether.  IMHO, the Anglican Church finally left Christianity when the Archbishop of Cantebury approved a PERVERTED translation of the bible!  At first, I didn't believe it.  I mean the stuff in the article was so far-fetched!  However, I later read an article from  urlLink BBC News  that confirmed my worse fears!  The information in the article was ALL true.  Check out the following article:    urlLink The Archbishop of Canterbury, leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, has personally backed a New Testament that seems to promote sexual license.  Instead of censuring fornicators and adulterers, this translation of the New Testament has St. Paul advising Christians not to go without sex for too long and it deletes prohibitions against sodomy, the Times of London reported Wednesday.  The new version was translated by John Henson, a Baptist who helps lead a network of scholars who have long worked for inclusive language in the Bible and who place a premium on the dynamic equivalence of translated passages.  Henson changes the original Greek and Hebrew names into modern nicknames: St. Peter becomes Rocky and Mary Magdalen becomes Maggie.  In other passages, Henson changes demon possession into mental illness and the theologically significant Son of Man into the more psychologically oriented and politically correct Complete Person.  Archbishop Rowan Williams' endorsement of the Henson translation has provoked orthodox and traditionalist clergy and parishioners throughout the worldwide Anglican Communion.  -------------------------  Here are examples of the new translation:  Mark 1:4   Authorized version: "John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins."  New: "John, nicknamed 'The Dipper,' was 'The Voice.' He was in the desert, inviting people to be dipped, to show they were determined to change their ways and wanted to be forgiven."    Mark 1:10-11   Authorized version: "And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him. And there came a voice from the heaven saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."  New: "As he was climbing up the bank again, the sun shone through a gap in the clouds. At the same time a pigeon flew down and perched on him. Jesus took this as a sign that God's spirit was with him. A voice from overhead was heard saying, 'That's my boy! You're doing fine!'"    Matthew 23:25   Authorized version: "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!"  New version: "Take a running jump, Holy Joes, humbugs!"    Matthew 26:69-70   Authorized version: "Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, 'Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.' But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest."  New: "Meanwhile Rocky was still sitting in the courtyard. A woman came up to him and said: 'Haven't I seen you with Jesus, the hero from Galilee?" Rocky shook his head and said: 'I don't know what the hell you're talking about!'"    1 Corinthians 7:1-2   KJV: "Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, [to avoid] fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."  New: "Some of you think the best way to cope with sex is for men and women to keep right away from each other. That is more likely to lead to sexual offences. My advice is for everyone to have a regular partner."    1 Corinthians 7:8-7   KJV: "I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."  New: "If you know you have strong needs, get yourself a partner. Better than being frustrated."   -------------------------

        "Catholics" for a Free Choice is at it again.  They're pushing their EVIL agenda around the globe.  This time, they're in Puerto Rico.  My friend told me that they're distributing Holy Cards of Our Lady of Guadalupe.  Distributing Holy Cards are okay... I mean what harm can they do?  Than again, we're talking about Frances Kissling here.  Anywayz, guess what's in the back of the prayer card?  In the back of the holy card is a prayer asking Our Blessed Mother to PROMOTE abortions!  Retarded eh?  Asking the Patroness of the Unborn to pray for abortions!  How absurd?!  It's like asking a mother to kill her own children... it ain't gonna happen!  Our Blessed Mother's not going to do anything against her Son's will!  So Frances Kissling... "Don't bother praying for more abortions! God's not going to answer your prayers!"  Frances Kissling and her baby-killing minions are poster children for pro-abortion supporters.  They're lack of common sense has led me to believe that persistent abortion support makes you STUPID!  Look at Frances Kissling for example.  She's been supporting abortions for over 30 something years... and look at her!  Her brain's a pile of mush!  (Scramble eggs anyone??) ------------------------------ This is your brain:    This is your brain when you follow Frances Kissling:   Any questions?

(Exodus 14:21)  One of the most famous stories of the Bible is God's parting of the Red Sea to save the Israelites from the Egyptian army and the subsequent drowning of soldiers and horses in hot pursuit.  But is there evidence that such an event did in fact happen – and if so, precisely where did it take place?  The issue is surfacing some 3,500 years after the event is said to have taken place with reports of Egyptian chariot wheels found in the Red Sea, photographs to document it and new books by scientists that could lead to a whole remapping of the Exodus route and a fresh look at ancient biblical accounts.

        urlLink  The powerful Austrian Catholic church was plunged into its second big sex scandal in a decade yesterday when a seminary run by arch-conservatives was alleged to be the site of orgies among young priests and their teachers.  The seminary in St Pölten, west of Vienna, comes under the authority of the conservative Bishop Kurt Krenn.   The Vienna news magazine Profil has published pictures of priests and students engaged in sexual acts, prompting an uproar, emergency meetings of the church leadership, and calls for Bishop Krenn's resignation.   The pictures were said to be part of a cache of some 40,000 photos and child pornography videos found by church officials on computers at the seminary a year ago. While the Austrian Bishops' Conference issued a statement declaring that "homosexuality and pornography" could have no place at the seminary, Bishop Krenn refused to resign and appeared to compound the crisis by saying: "This has got nothing to do with homosexuality. It's just boys' pranks."   BOYISH PRANKS?!!  A prank is flushing a guy's head down the toilet... not kissing another guy and showing him porn!  Oy!  PSYCHO-Dissidents!  When will they ever learn?

        urlLink  (1010 WINS) (WASHINGTON) The Senate dealt an election-year defeat Wednesday to a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, rejecting pleas from President Bush and fellow conservatives that the measure was needed to safeguard an institution that has flourished for thousands of years.  The vote was 48-50, 12 short of the 60 needed to keep the measure alive. Six Republicans joined dozens of Democrats in sealing the amendment's fate.  "I would argue that the future of our country hangs in the balance because the future of marriage hangs in the balance," said Sen. Rick Santorum, a leader in the fight to approve the measure. "Isn't that the ultimate homeland security, standing up and defending marriage?"    Sen. Santorum poses an interesting question: "Isn't the ultimate homeland security, standing up and defending marriage?"  Hmm... let's look at this issue in a sociological perspective:  1) The "Feminization of Poverty" is caused by the breakdown of the marriage institution. 2) Studies have shown that girls are more sexually active and boys are more rebellious if there are no male "father figure" in their lives. 3) Demographically, Black males have the highest incarceration rate in the United States.  This is due to their unstable "lifestyle" at home.  (ie: No "father figure" at home) 4) The majority of ephebophilia (sexual attraction of adults to adolescents) cases are done by homosexual men. 5) Homosexual men have the highest rate of AIDS/HIV virus.  This is due to their promiscuous lifestyle. 6) Promoting homosexuality as "healthy" and "normal" can be dangerous to teenagers.  NARTH (National Association of Research and Therapy of homosexuality states:    urlLink Scientific research supports age-old cultural norms that homosexuality is not a healthy, natural alternative to heterosexuality. Research shows that gay teens are especially vulnerable to substance abuse and early, high-risk sexual behavior. It does far more harm than good to tell a teenager that his or her attractions toward members of the same sex are normal and desirable. Teens in this position need understanding and counseling, not a push in the direction of a potentially deadly lifestyle. A 1992 study in Pediatrics found that 25.9% of 12-year-olds are uncertain if they are gay or straight. The teen years are critical to the question of self-labeling, so the facts must be presented in our schools in a fair and balanced manner.    Anywayz, I can go on and on about this issue.  Let's just say that I totallly agree with Sen. Santorum's viewpoint.  BTW, if anyone's interested in where I get my facts, feel free to contact me.  Most of my facts came from my sociology textbooks.  (In case you're wondering, no, I don't attend a Catholic University.  I attend a VERY Liberal College)

        urlLink  It was the TV pictures that first got to Bronagh Cassidy. Same-sex couples marrying in San Francisco: "They were so proud of themselves. And then they had these little children with them." Cassidy, a 27-year-old married mother of two, sighs. "Something inside of me wants to be able to help those kids, because I know they are going to have problems."   Sound ignorant, maybe even bigoted? This week, as the Senate is expected to begin debate on a constitutional amendment to protect marriage, many voices will try to convince you that people like Cassidy are, as Cheryl Jacque, head of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, put it in a recent letter, "hate-filled people who will stop at nothing to achieve their discriminatory, offensive goals."   But Cassidy knows better: She is one of the first generation of "gayby boom" babies, raised by two moms. Adult children of same-sex parents are rare. I recently came across Cassidy's story by accident, after she e-mailed a friend of mine who is a family scholar.   Back in 1976, Cassidy's mom had a religious ceremony with a woman named Pat. To make Cassidy, they did artificial insemination at home, mixing the sperm of two gay friends "to make sure nobody would ever know who the father was," says Cassidy. (That was in the days before widespread DNA testing.) The two women stayed together for 16 years, until Pat died. Three years later, Cassidy's mother married a man.   What was it like for Cassidy being raised by two women she called "Mom" and "My Pat"?   "When growing up, I always had the feeling of being something unnatural," Cassidy says. "I came out of an unnatural relationship; it was something like I shouldn't be there. On a daily basis, it was something I was conflicted with. I used to wish, honestly that Pat wasn't there."   Why does she oppose same-sex marriage? "It's not something that a seal of approval should be stamped on: We shouldn't say it is a great and wonderful thing and then you have all these kids who later in life will turn around and realize they've been cheated. The adults choose to have that lifestyle and then have a kid. They are fulfilling their emotional needs -- they want to have a child -- and they are not taking into account how that's going to feel to the child; there's a clear difference between having same-sex parents and a mom and a dad."

        urlLink  Bangkok, Jul. 12 (CWNews.com) - Remarks by the president of Uganda at a world AIDS meeting in Bangkok brought the controversy of abstinence versus condoms to the fore on Monday.   President Yoweri Museveni, whose country is the lone success story against AIDS in Africa with an official pro-abstinence policy, said abstinence works every time it is tried. "I look at condoms as an improvisation, not a solution," Museveni told delegates on the second day of the 15th International AIDS Conference in Bangkok. Instead, he called for "optimal relationships based on love and trust instead of institutionalized mistrust, which is what the condom is all about."   Kudos to President Museveni!  Finally some "common sense" in politics!!

        urlLink  U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr., met privately with St. Louis Archbishop Raymond L. Burke on Monday, two weeks after he accused the church leader of "going over the top" in his dealings with candidates supportive of abortion rights.   Diocese spokesman Jim Orso said that Burke and Clay agreed that the discussion was a "pastoral meeting ... between the archbishop and a Catholic in the diocese," and that no public statements would be made.

          urlLink  Most of the Mass was in the Chinese vernacular, although the sermon from Bishop Wang was in English. The Bishop spoke of the importance of appreciating God's gift of eternal life and creating new opportunities for evangelization. At the offertory, a Chinese lantern dance was performed by 13 girls, making what appeared to be slight curtsies to the left and right as they processed down the aisle holding lanterns; and, just in front of the sanctuary, several young women performed a Chinese ribbon dance.  After communion, Cardinal Mahony, Auxiliary Bishop Edward Clark, and Bishop Wang participated in an ancestral veneration ritual along with elders from the Chinese community. At the conclusion of the veneration, Cardinal Mahony stepped up to the podium to deliver two short New Year's greetings, one in Cantonese and the other in Mandarin. This met with much laughter and applause -- the first and last of the evening.    Aren't they going a little too far with "acculturation"?  As a Chinese-Catholic, I think it's VERY inappropriate for them to have Dragon & lantern dancing during mass.  Outside of mass, I don't see a problem with it.  But during mass... HECK NO! Mass is a time to worship our Lord... to adore with BEAUTIFUL presence!  Also, I don't see how the Dragon and Lantern Dance has ANYTHING to do with a sacrifice!  The dances are celebratory rituals in the Chinese culture, which are TOTALLY INCOMPATIBLE with the sacrificial nature of the altar!  It's like Our Blessed Mother and the Beloved John DANCING at the foot of the cross!!!

        urlLink  A Roman Catholic archbishop in South Africa has suggested that a libation of blood—a ritual pouring as a symbolic sacrifice honoring the ancestors of black Africans—should be incorporated into local Catholic liturgies such as the Mass.  Archbishop Buti Tlhagale, of Bloemfontein, recently raised the issue in an article in South Africa's Catholic weekly publication, The Southern Cross.  "Sacrifice to the ancestors continues to be a very common practice among Africans," Archbishop Tlhagale said. "The slaughtering of an animal—cow or sheep—takes place wherever there is a funeral or a marriage feast, or in times of illness, unemployment, family feuds or the birth of a child."  The practice should be considered within the context of inculturation, according to which local, indigenous culture and values are a means of presenting, reformulating and living the Christian faith, he suggested.  In an interview with Ecumenical News International (ENI), Archbishop Tlhagale said that white Christians who balked at the idea of blood libations "are not talking from the same experiences" as black Africans. "There is a clashing of cultures. All I'm trying to argue is that even sophisticated black Christians slaughter animals as part of their tradition of communing with their ancestors at important occasions in their lives.  "Is there a way to integrate this custom with their Christian belief as a step towards meaningful inculturation?" he asked.    Of course not!  The only blood that should be poured during mass is from Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!

Disgusting!!!!!!!!  I know... I know.  The site is from the Pope Pius X Society, and you really can't trust everything they say.  But I did further research, and the information they posted is pretty legit.
