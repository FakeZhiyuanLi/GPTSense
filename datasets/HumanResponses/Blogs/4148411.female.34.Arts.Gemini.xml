						   So, the wedding I mentioned early is coming up again on TV. It’s now airing on the Life Network on August 30 & 31. They called our episode  Cake Expectations . In the detail they say something about the cake not being right, and the bride being late.  What a joke that is. Before I slam the show totally, I will say we had a brilliant time planning Holly & Chris’ wedding. That’s the concept behind   Exchanging Vows  ~  you’re paired up with another couple, you meet for 10 minutes and aside from watching video clues left by the other couple, you are on your own trying to plan their dream wedding. Whoever can plan it the closest to what the couple said they wanted (taped separately and shown later on) wins a dream honeymoon.  SO….. Reality TV? Not! The segments were taped out of sequence, which is perfectly normal, and expected. What we didn’t expect was book their venue a mere 4 days before their wedding, or Holly’s dress a few days prior… the list went on. Jane and I went through major heart palpitations trying to work through this – almost forgetting the other couple were likely dealing with our wedding plans in the same fashion.  If you happen to watch the show, keep in mind that producers and directors of reality TV LOVE drama. The more the merrier. Like the cake thing. I’m now wondering if they didn’t sabotage it on purpose as everything else at that point was going pretty smoothly. Their cake arrived in a regular pastry box – not protecting the cake, but instead leaning against the beautifully created white leaves showering the white icing in gentle waterfalls. All three layers were crushed down one side. The cake had taken an ecstatic leap forward from its bottom layer, and now canted precariously close to the edge. I was mortified ~ and they caught it all on camera.  “Why didn’t someone take more care with this?” I remember snapping, only to look up and find the lens staring silently back at me. I appear very angry in this shot, giving the world one of my death by jugular removal glares (I am after all the Dog in Chinese Astrology, and find I go for the neck every time I’m pissed), and upon watching this part find myself mortified all over again. Such drama. We could only laugh afterward.  The part about the bride being late was about Holly. Another carefully created caper with total thanks to the director. On the show they depict Holly as a prima donna who can’t possibly tear herself away from her hair stylist without each strand perfectly in place. She’s an hour late by God! A shot pans to Chris pacing dramatically in the front court yard, waiting for his precious bride to arrive.   So what really happened? Holly had told the coordinator, who will remain nameless only because any mention of her name gives me a bad case of facial ticks, that on the day of her wedding, she would be at the hair salon getting her hair and make-up done, and not to go to their house to pick up the bridal party. Have the driver go to the salon. Pretty clear right? So what happens? The driver goes to their house in rush hour traffic only to find Holly “missing”. He calls the producer, who has selective amnesia, and says he can’t find the bride. The producer, (now I’m using conjecture here as I can only imagine how the conversation must have gone) tells the driver of this enormous white limo that the bride is in fact at the salon, still getting her hair done, and he was to find her there. Go Go Go!  You can’t go anywhere fast in Toronto in rush hour. It takes him almost an hour to travel 20 minutes, where he finally picks up Holly who’s been waiting for hours with her hair perfectly in place. They then must travel to Kleinburg to The Doctors House, the surprise venue we chose for them.  When all was said and done, both weddings were wonderful. They each had their glitches (at ours, the power had gone off and the backup generator was roaring in the background, creating a 3 hour delay) but in the end, we married the people we fell in love with and started our lives as man and wife, and wife and wife. It was all good.  Even better was becoming fast friends with Holly and Chris Monster. We found many things in common – Holly and I both study Reiki, Chris and Jane share common interests. We consider ourselves lucky to have been paired with them, as neither of us looked at this with the contest in mind. Instead, we planned the weddings of potential friends with as much care as we would have planned our own.  Jane and I “officially” won the honeymoon ~ a trip to Thailand which we took in March. We had planned to all go together in fact, and share the cost of two extra tickets. However, work plans and life in general interfered with this, and we went alone. Not one day passed where we didn’t think of Holly and Chris while we took in the sights of breathtaking Temples and the Emerald Buddha. We visited the Royal Palace, where the remake of Anna and the King took place.  In the end, what mattered was our union, celebrated in time with the ruling in favour of gay & lesbian weddings; and the uniting of new friendships with two wonderful people.  Thanks again Holls and Chris Monster.  You guys rock the party.

						   With help from my friend Holly, we created the counter and guest book last night. Fumbling around myself this morning, I was able to modify each. I was pretty happy with myself until I tried to actually move the code for the counter... then I ended up splitting the page in half at the bottom, and hopefully I haven't FUBARed it totally. I didn't save the changes... *sigh* I must stick to what I know.. writing and painting and pestering my friends to help me. :-D Holls?

						   I told Dale I would keep this tame, so here's a short story about my little boy. Jane and Gillian are the main characters. Let me know if you enjoy it ok? Tell me if I'm on crack thinking this book will sell... lol  Little Noah by Jennefer Paul  	The stillness to the house was broken as Jane woke up, not sure what had roused her from her sleep. She looked over at the clock and registered through her sleepy gaze that it was 3:03am. She laid her head back on the pillow, closed her eyes and listened. Sure enough, she heard it again as Noah cried out from his room. She looked over at Gillian, fast asleep and snuggled deep within the warm duvet. Gillian had been so tired this week; she didn’t have the heart to wake her. She drew back the covers and slipped out of the bed.  	Opening the door to Noah’s room, Jane saw him sitting up in his bed, rubbing his eyes and yawning. 	“What’s wrong hunny?” she asked as she sat beside him. 	“I had a bad dream,” he said, leaning into her for comfort. She wrapped her arms around his little body and pulled him into her lap. She rocked with him for a few moments, enjoying his little boy smells and the feel of his body wrapped snuggly against hers. She felt her stomach twinge softly as it did now whenever she thought of having a child of her own. Loving Noah and Emily had meant opening her heart to them completely. It meant risking being hurt by them, feeling pain for them; everything a mother feels for her children. The rewarding side was hearing them call your name, hearing them laugh with you, and feeling their absolute love for you. She bent and kissed the top of his head. She inhaled the scent of his hair, freshly washed before bed and smelling of watermelons. 	“What was the dream?” 	“These bad guys were chasing me. My spider webs wouldn’t work and I couldn’t climb the walls.” Noah sighed the last remnants of the dream from his body. His current hero was Spider-Man, and his bedroom was alive with the web-slinging anti-villain. Noah held up his wrist and showed Jane. 	“Look, no webs!” His little face was solemn. 	“That’s okay buddy,” Jane said, giving him another hug. “The bad guys didn’t catch you, and you’re safe. I think your dream catcher may have helped you.” They both looked up to see the little blue dream catcher dangling in front of the window. The small crystal suspended inside the web glittered in the moonlight. 	“Will it stop the other bad dreams?” he asked hopefully. “Until my webs are back?” 	“I’m sure it will. Now let’s get you tucked back in so we can go back to sleep.” Jane wrapped the blankets around him and kissed his cheek. 	“I love you Jane.” 	“I love you too Noah.” Jane felt her eyes prick and smiled as she stroked his little head one last time before leaving the room.  	She climbed back into bed and watched Gillian sleep. Her face looked serene with her black lashes brushing the tops of her cheeks and mouth parted slightly in sleep. Jane leaned over and kissed her mouth gently. Gillian murmured softly and turned towards her, and Jane drew her fiancée into her arms, settling around her in their bed. She listened to her breathing, deep and even. She waited for a possible call from Noah, but none came. He was asleep. 	The house was still again.  March 13, 2002

						   Hello fellow bloggers... Dale has gotten some amazing tips and assistance from some of you, and I was hoping I could inlist some help? Maybe? Perhaps? Pretty please?? Funny how us writers don't know a thing past working in our word program... Actually, I'm not that helpless... I'm a whiz with all the programs... but web stuff? Forget it! So, that brings me to this ~ asking for help in setting up a guest book and counter and the usual stuff that fills our web sites. If some of you were closer, I could offer my spa services! :) Take care everyone!

						   Well wonders never cease! I posted a picture! Sometimes I really do surprise the crap outta myself. Actually, I meant to send the picture to my profile, but whatever - it's up. Now I can experiment and send something actually worth looking at! :P  Okay - so, really going to bed now... more later. Maybe a sample of my book perhaps? Zzzzzzzzz

						   So, my friend Dale told me about his blog adventures, and being naturally curious, I thought I ought to try this out.  I filled out my profile and got to the part about adding pictures.... It said on the screen that I should download Hello, which I did. I then transferred a pic from my HD to the hello page... and that's where I got stuck. How to get the picture to the blog screen... that is the million dollar question.  I'm getting rather sleepy from all the wine Dale made me drink with dinner, so I think I may have to forog.. oops, forgo the pic thingy right now and ask Dale how he did it. The pictures I mean.  While we're on the subject of my good friend Dale, I should tell everyone that I am the Jennefer who lives in O'Ville, and whose house he graced for din-dins tonight. We had pasta with chicken and peaches and cream corn if you're wondering. And wine. Oh, and pina coladas while I was preparing dinner. Yes... a big glass of pina colada. I call it penis coladis actually, which I believe is the correct name for this wonderful drink. Snobby people couldn't say it though, so they shortened it to pina colada. Silly really. What a waste of a good drink name.  Anywho, where were we? Oh yes, dinner with Dale. It was lovely - great company, great food - Dale loves to read to my little boy Jake. After dinner he cleaned up my kitchen with Jake's help (or hinderance.. I wasn't sure which) thank you Dale and Jake! They made their way to Jake's bedroom to read more of his Harry Potter book, or read some kind of book - I was busy corn-rowing my daughter's hair. It's virtually inpossible to corn-row straight brown hair, but I did my best.  Julia is having 4 girls over for a sleep-over tomorrow. 1pm Saturday to 11am Sunday. 5 12 year old girls in total. Not sure what I've roped myself into, but I'm certain we'll all survive. Somehow. We're setting up tents in the backyard so we don't have to listen to them screech and giggle all night. I wish we could have a little camp fire, but we live in the suburbs of O'Ville, and from what I've heard that's a no-no.  Hmmmm, I guess I could expand a bit on myself since I kept my bio rather short. I'm in the process of working with my agent on finding a buyer for my book. I started writing an anthology of erotica for women three years ago for PrideVision TV website; the column moved to the Slack Alice website, and throughout that time I built quite a stock of little stories. I guess I should clarify the stories are lesbian in nature - and some quite graphic; in all the anthology is about a main set of characters and their experiences throughout life. We're hoping some publisher out there loves the work, thinks it's original enough to sell, and loves my style. Fingers crossed! Dale was my proof-reader on this venture - love you Dale!!! (Yes, he read everything! Even the smutty parts when Jane strapped on the dil.....) I know the sacrifice he made in slogging through it... Bless his randy soul.  Okay - I really should go now - Dale, how do you post pictures???  Night!
