      the restaurant industry hasn't changed much at all over the past few years. Not that I really thought it would, but I have to admit, after three days of training I have come to the realization that any fantasy I had of being able to do it for a while, was a severely delusional one.  Yesterday after work I was walking home and realized that everyone who I have met over the past couple of days are amalgrams of people I have worked with in the past. The constant little bickering among the staff, the complaining about this or that; it was weird when it hit me because I had kind of romanticized it the way that you do after times passes. I was remembering the team work, the food and the camaraderie during the days between when I got hired and the day I started. Now, this week I have been reminded of the smoking and drinking, the whole mentality of the industry is just different and weird. I think I have said this in the past, it is a great job for a young person in school. You make good money and you learn a lot of things, how to deal with people, how to juggle a lot of simultaneous needs and tasks, but unless you evolve into a different role (I guess this is a life truism, in general) you tend to stay in that same place. I think that is the part that is hardest for me. I have changed so much that I don't fit anymore.  Anyway, so here's the update on my job hunt. There are two main things that I am looking at right now. Actually, let's start with a little warning. This job hunting thing is a COLOSSAL pain in the butt. I have a really tough time with the roller coaster ride of finding something, putting a lot of energy towards it, picturing it as a good fit and then ultimately not having it work out. I tend to NOT want to talk to anyone because it feeds my excitement and then I feel awful when it doesn't work out. I've given this some thought and I think it has a lot to do with feeling rejected and not dealing with that well. So, I am trying to get over that.  Here are my two latest leaders:  One is a publishing company located in Louisville. They've been around for a while and are primarily the spiritual genre. I got the impression from the ad that I found for an associate editor position that their book division was up and running. However, further research revealed that it is a project that is still in the development stage and that they naturally would like someone with publishing experience to step up and spearhead the project.  I wrote a truly inspired cover letter, and sent it to the HR person and lo and behold, I got a response. Apparently, they haven't posted the new opening yet, but they are thinking about hiring for a more junior position, basically the same department, same job, but for someone who doesn't need to have the five years of experience. I don't know if they were planning to do it anyway, or if it came as a result of my letter, but regardless, I told him I was definitely interested and so we'll see where it goes next.    The other is with a medical device company. This job actually came up in a funny way, a random friend of a friend mentioned it and then was rather insistent towards both parties that we meet. He was dead-on, though because when we met, we totally hit it off. However, we have run into a few snags, also. Apparently they have never hired a chiropractor for the original position that we discussed and HR is balking a bit about it. There is a silver lining, though, in that they don't seem to have the same issue with the higher paying sales jobs, so it is just a matter, hopefully of finding a fit. AND, the original position was located in California, however, according to the website yesterday, there was a sales position here. I have been in constant communication with both the person who I've already met and her hiring manager, so we'll see where that goes.  I'll update this as new developments occur, so rest assured, if you haven't heard anything, I am still working at the restaurant and you can be pretty confident that I don't want to talk about THAT!!!

      Since my life has turned out to be more eventful than I could have ever imagined and my group of family and friends is so large and way more geographically spread out than anyone could have predicted,  I decided to start this blog to share what is going on.   To those of you who decided this is an incredible show of egotism on my part I have two things to say:  1)  You do know me, right? and 2) This is a great idea and everyone should do it.  How cool to have a place were you can put pictures and let people know what is going on with your life?  Plus, you can always go back and reread things you may have forgotten (how much better is that than having to pretend you were paying attention when you weren't?)  So here goes, I am still working out the kinks and trying to figure out how to get the pictures on here, but plan to have plenty of them once I do.
