      I emailed Democrats Senator  urlLink Brian Greig  with a few questions about John Howard's plan - now underway - to ban gay marriage.   Questions are numbered with the Senator's answers after.  Dear Senator Greig,  I have been following the gay marriage 'debate' in the media for the past few days and was wondering if you would mind me asking you a few questions.  1.) I've read about this plan being in the works for a while, most notably from Margo Kingston's Web Diary. How long have you known that John Howard was going to pull this one out of his hat? Have you been preparing for it?  = = = = = = = = =   I figured Howard would do this as soon as Bush announced his Constitutional Amendment in the US. It was just too good for the PM to resist, gay bashing in the guise of "protecting traditional marriage." Having said that, I felt that Howard would be more likely to raise the issue for public debate only, and threaten reform, but not necessarily bring it into the parliament with legislation. (He has done that on a few controversial issues, such as lesbian access to IVF).  In terms of preparing for it, I guess it depends on what you mean. As a party,  there was little, if anything, to do to prepare for it. I mean - we oppose it outright. What's to prepare for? But, as a gay activist, I have been preparing myself for just this sort of thing for 15 years, and can  argue all the counterpoints to Howard's homophobia in a logical,  compassionate and academic way.   = = = = = = = = = = = =   2.) What do you think his motive is? Is it really to close what he sees as a loophole on gay marriage, because he is such a die hard conservative? Is he taking his inspiration (for want of a better word) for this from Bush? Or do you see some type of sinister attempt at a wedge here, from a desperate man?   = = = = = = == = = = = = = =   The motive is simple. Howard is reaching, once again, for the lowest common denominator in an election year - popular prejudice. And,  perhaps more importantly, he is looking for a divisive wedge with which to target Labor to try and create disunity between its left faction and  its Catholic right faction, in this, an election year. So, he has made gay and lesbian people and their children the whipping post for rednecks. Having run out of racist election tactics (whether it was the Wik 10 Point Plan or demonising asylum seekers), homosexuals are the new bogyman. Pink is the new black. Gay marriage is the Tampa of 2004.  = = = = = = = = = = = = = =   3.) What do you think of what has been reported at the ABC website today (31 May) with regards to Labor refusing to support the ban on gay couples adopting from overseas, yet continuing to back Howard's ban on gay marriage? The reasoning seems to be purely legalistic - i.e this is a question for the states, and the federal government should not be sticking its nose in.   = = = = = = = = == = = = = == =  Typical ALP dishonesty and hypocrisy. The issue here is not whether  it's a state or federal issue, it's about the role of gay and lesbian people in Australian society, and whether they are included or excluded from full citizenship. And it's about the capability of gay and lesbian parents, and whether or not same-sex parents can raise healthy,  balanced kids. Neither the ALP nor the government want to engage in that much needed debate, and as a result the "debate", limited as it has been, is merely surfing along on the top of unquestioned myths and misinformation.  The ALP will allow foreign adoptions, partly because it does absolutely nothing (foreign adoptions are already banned to same-sex couples by those overseas countries themselves), and partly as a sop to its Left faction as a trade off for supporting the marriage ban, which the Catholic faction in its ranks want.  = = = = = = = == = = = = = == =     4.) When would you expect the legislation to pass through the senate? What kind of time frame?? Does the Government want to rush it through?  = = = = = == = = = = = = ==   Yes, I think the Gov't wants to rush it, just because it's a great election wedge and has successfully distracted attention (for now),  away from the Gov'ts difficulty in Iraq. I suspect we will see the Bill within three weeks, however, the Democrats are calling for the Bill to go to a committee inquiry for full scrutiny. There are many serious issues that these Bills address, real issues that effect real people's lives, and serious implications for several international treaty obligations. We Democrats don't want to see this issue lobbed like a hand grenade into the middle of a polarising and volatile election environment. It needs sensible debate in a calm atmosphere.  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =   5.) Are you dissappointed that Mark Latham will be supporting John Howard on the gay marriage question?  = = = = = = = = = = = =  Very. And angry. Sadly, Labor has shown no leadership on this issue at all, and has learnt nothing from its "me too" approach to Government wedge politics from the last election.  = = = = = == = = = = = == = = = = =   Many thanks for your time. Personally, I am appalled by the HOward move. But obviously, I shouldn't be. It's just what you'd expect, but nonetheless it makes me angry, so that's why I'm writing to you.  I also do a bit of freelance writing, so I'm looking at perhaps working this into some type of article.   = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  I'm appalled by Howard on this too, but much more appalled by the ALP for going along with most of it.

      Interesting to read the following in  urlLink Glen Milne's  column in the Australian today. Seems Carmen Lawrence has been giving frank and fearless comments at business conferences and seminars about Labor's confidence with regards to the upcoming election. Some wise guy took notes at one of Lawrence's gigs and passed them onto the Australian  Milne wrote:  'Lawrence's own narrative made it clear that Latham's folksy style, with its emphasis on things like reading to children, is not an act of character but the working out of a disciplined strategy.'  That's what it's always looked like to me. He stopped the bad language as soon as the job required it, and jumped from espousing 'hate' in politics to his 'good things'.

      I read an Andrew Bolt  urlLink column  about Merlin luck and came across a line that said:  Nor should it surprise anyone that anti-war activists can be manipulated with historic falsehoods, such as the lie that America was a close ally of Saddam and sold him weapons of mass destruction.   I was surprised by this, because everyone knows the US supported Saddam, so I asked Andrew to explain:   18 June, 2004  Hi Andrew,  I didn't understand what you meant saying America had never supported Saddam Hussein or sold him weapons. I thought that was pretty well documented.  Donald Rumsfeld shook his hand! Can you explain?  Regards, Chris   21st June, 2004  You misquote me, Chris.  America for a while during the iran/Iraq war gave Iraq intelligence help to avoid the country being overrun by a regime more threatening to us even than Saddam's. If you doubt just how dangerous Iran, with Iraq's oil money as well could be, look at how helpless we are even now with Iran just about to get the nuclear bomb Rafsanjani has already threatened to drop on Israel.   But the US did not sell Iraq weapons of mass destruction. That is a lie. A university institute, in a scheme involving even our own ANY, sent over viruses meant for agricultural research. Stupid, yes, in restropect. If you want to see who sold Iraq most of its weapons, look up the old UNSCOM website and check what Germany, France and Russia were up to. Do bells now start to ring?   Andrew Bolt  23 June, 2004  Andrew,  Thanks for responding. Sorry to misquote you. I was referring to this from your column:   Nor should it surprise anyone that anti-war activists can be manipulated with historic falsehoods, such as the lie that America was a close ally of Saddam and sold him weapons of mass destruction.   Do you mean I misquoted you because I said we 'supported' Saddam Hussein, whereas you disputed we had ever been a 'close ally'? Plus I said weapons, instead of 'weapons of mass destruction'.  I presume you agree then that the West did support Hussein, and that we did supply him with some weapons and technology.  Regards,  Chris Saliba  24 June, 2004   America briefly gave Saddam military intelligence when it looked like Iran might overwhelm his forces and potentialy take over his country and his fabulously rich oil fields. That was a prospect that seemed (and still does in hindsight) even more frightening to world security than did Saddam's toxic regime. This was one of those hard decisions, like the USA and Britain joining with Stalin's Russia to fight Hitler, where sometimes a democracy has no choice but to pick the least worst dog in a  common fight against a greater evil.  And I don't think the US sold any weapons to Iraq. France and Russia were its main suppliers, and Germany sold most of its supplies of WMD and WMD production materials.  Andrew Bolt  Well, I thought everyone knew that the US sold weapons to Iraq, covertly. Read Alan Friedman's  urlLink Spider's Web .  Don't think I'll pursue this one. Plus Andrew didn't confirm where I'd misquoted him.

      A book by Alison Broinowski, who has also written about Australian perceptions of Asia.   The book details Asian opinions, from some ten countries, about Australia. It's not a fun book. Depressing is how across the board racism is, and how similarly petty we all are. We thought we had a Pauline Hanson problem. You should read what Asians - or rather a certain segment of Asian society - think about us. Lazy, uncivilised, boorish, racist, lower class, stupid. The list goes on.  The most interesting part of the book describes two cases of where Australia and the rest of Asia totally misunderstood each other.  1.) Pauline Hanson. They barely cared in Asia, and just thought of it as an embarrassing internal problem. After all, Asian countries have their own problems with racism.  2.) The East Timor independence vote. There was wide hostility to Australia's involvement, something I never understood. We were seen as aggressors, sticking our nose into something that wasn't our business. Plus the fact we always look to the US for our foreign policy, right over our neighbours.  The book's main point is that we need to start caring more - much more - about our image in Asia. We can't afford to be misunderstood. Nor can we afford not to care what our neighbours think of us.

      The last novel I read of Thomas Hardy's was Jude the Obscure. It wasn't until I was half way through it that I discovered 'how' to read it. I had been reading it as a straight narrative, not picking up its quirkiness and outright strangeness. Even queerness.  The same goes for Far from the Madding Crowd. Why does everyone see Thomas Hardy as so dark and gloomy. I don't think he is. Sure, there's lots of negative and tragic aspects to the story, but so much that is also rich and strange.  Some aspects of the novel I don't know how to read. Like, when the tragic Fanny Robin, who ends up pregnant to the amoral Sergeant Troy, turns up to the wrong church and so misses out on marrying Troy, how are we supposed to take it? It reads as funny.  Indeed, there are so many artificial aspects to the novel that it's almost like a pantomime. Or a fairytale at least.  I loved the portrait of Farmer Boldwood, who falls in love with Bathsheba Everdene and can't get her out of his head (as the Kylie song goes). An brilliant study of a crazy love that causes endless pain.   I wondered how much of this sort of extreme love Hardy had experienced himself. His portrait of Farmer Boldwood had the ring of experience about it.  A ten out of ten novel. I will try to read more of his books this year.

      A book I came by browsing the library's new acquisitions. What a doozy! The book covers four generations of the Bush clan, right up to George W. Bush, trawling through their financial dealings, arms dealings, CIA links etc. etc.  The author, Kevin Phillips, is a former strategist for the Repulican party. He writes that one of the good things about writing the book was that it crystallized why he never liked the Bush family.  There's lots of dry humour and wit in the book. At one stage he describes the Bush family as a theme park.   The book has an excellent  urlLink website , with responses to criticism, reviews and excerpts.  I have got out his book previous to this, Wealth and Democracy, and look forward to reading it.

      A book by  urlLink Stephen Tanner . Traces the various Empires and conquerers that have staked a claim on what is now Afghanistan.  From Alexander the Great right up to the United States. While the author seems pretty much pro US, he does admit that the US created a bin Laden type monster by arming and financially backing the mujahideen.   Sideline piece of interest. Page 304 tells of how Dick Morris, policy guru for Clinton, urged war on Iraq by using proxy troops, 'Shi'ites in the south and Kurds in the north' to topple Saddam, therebye avoiding US casualties.

      I'd greatly appreciate it if you could provide your response to the following quesions:  1.) Now that Howard's marriage amendment bill is to go before a Senate committee for further investigation, what sort of time frame do you envisage for the process? Will it be complete (the Senate committee) before the next election? And what changes would you hope the committee might recommend  - if any at all ? on how the bill currently stands?  ANS: The timeframe is not yet set, but I think we can safely assume that the ALP will agree to a timeframe that pushes the reporting date way past the election - possibly into the new year. The prospect of an inquiry is pleasing to Labor, as it gives them a temporary escape route from a tricky situation. It means they don't have to debate this controversial topic in an election year, and denies John Howard the opportunity to use the issue as a sharp wedge. I would hope and expect that the Committee, when it reports, will at the very least, argue for partnership recognition for same-sex couples to address all current areas of discrimination under Commonwealth law - in the event that civil marriage is banned to same-sex couples.   2.) Labor's position on this issue seems contradictory. Shadow Attorney-General Nicola Roxon said in a statement:   "While Labor questions the PM?s motives and reasons for bringing on this issue for debate now, and questions whether it is necessary ? Labor does not oppose these parts of the Bill which merely confirm existing law and our previous commitments to keeping marriage as a heterosexual institution."  She is suggesting on the one hand that the Government is doing something underhand, yet will go along with it. How do you see Labor's position in this light?  ANS: Disgracefully gutless. "Confirming existing laws" suggests there is unquestionable merit in allowing existing laws to continue. I mean, there was a time when women were denied the vote. Would Ms Roxon have argued in 1901 that the ALP would "confirm existing laws", just because most people's understanding of voting franchise excluded women? Just because a law exists, does not make it a just or valid law. In reality, the ALP is struggling with its own internal difficulties, between its Left wing an its Catholic Right wing, so it has been forced into a clumsy compromise. That being, support for a marriage ban but opposition to a ban on foreign adoptions. The ALP is fearful of a debate on this matter (despite recent polling showing a remarkable 38% support for same-sex marriage), and fearful of a split in its ranks over the issue. Its strategy is purely political, and is designed to rob Howard of the opportunity to rattle the ALP caucus during an election year.       3.) On a similar note to the previous question, what do you think of Mark Latham's siding with the PM on the issue of the "two mums" debacle on Playschool? He said young children should not be exposed to this . Yet at the same time he tried to appear progressive and set himself apart from the Libs by saying he acknowledged our society's diversity. What do you see as his real position on gay issues?   ANS: Latham is showing he cannot be trusted on GLBTI issues. He slips and slides. He wants to pander to popular prejudice (marriage, play school), but at the same time appear reasonable by making muted gestures to the G&L community about law reform in other areas. In reality, it's not possible to be reasonable while at the same time arguing for inequality (marriage ban) and invisibility (play school). The federal ALP, unlike its state counterparts, is not as educated, sophisticated or up-to-speed on GLBTI issues, hence its clumsy meanderings around the topics and the resulting contradictions.  4.) The Prime Minister doesn't seem to have 100% Party Room support on the issue. He said the majority of his Party Room supported the decision, conceding some people have "different views" on the subject. Do you think there might be more Liberal MPs who have misgivings about the Bill than the PM is letting on?  ANS: No, 'probly not. I just think there is general and understandable concern that the marriage-adoption ban looked like unwarranted gay bashing. Many coalition MP's were worried that it looked like an attack for no good purpose (it is of course), but was later tempered with superannuation reform, salving the conscience of a few coalition MP's. I think, more importantly, that what the coalition partyroom reaction showed, was that anti-gay politics does just not have the power or impact it once had. Every coalition MP would now know lesbian and gay people in their wider families, circles of friends and supporters, and in their electorates. It's not so easy to target, bash and blame G&L people any more, as we have become integrated into everyday society in a way unimaginable just ten years ago. We are no longer bogey men, we are voters.    5.) If the Bill is eventually passed, how far do you think it will set back the gay rights agenda? How difficult would it be to get the law changed to recognise gay marriage??  ANS: Not as hard as you may think. I can imagine a future ALP Government moving to recognise gay marriage, as more and more countries around the world recognise gay relationships, and as Australia looks more and more isolated. The recent SBS poll of 1,200 people showed that the greatest support for gay marriage was with those under 35 years of age. This means that, over the next decade, as older Australians die off - taking their conservative attitudes to the grave with them - the younger generation, those under 45, will be supportive of gay marriage, and the balance on the scales will be tipped.  6.) Both major parties seem to think the electorate is not ready for gay marriage. Do you see a widespread resistance? If gay marriages were to be legally recognised, how do you think the community would take it? Would the world fall apart, as Howard and co. seem to think?  ANS: I think both parties have misread the electorate. The SBS poll showed that 44% opposed gay marriage (note that this is under half the population), 38% supported it, and 18% were undecided. I think these results shocked both parties, neither of whom would have felt that gay marriage had such low opposition or high support. I believe that if the ALP supported gay marriage, there would be some minor fuss, and it would soon all blow over. All the doomsayers will be proven wrong, and the shrill claims from the Religious Right and Conservative MP's about "undermining society" will be shown to be nonsense - just as it has shown to be so in Canada.  7.) What kind of effect do you think this is going to have on voting patterns for the next election   -  not just amongst gay people, but their families and friends too??  ANS: Very little I suspect. It's not a vote changing matter, not like jobs, tax, and health. However, I think the minor parties will do better than expected in many inner city seats. Only the Democrats and Greens have stood up for gay marriage, and the ALP has shocked and disappointed many GLBTI voters with its gutless and at times offensive and patronising utterances on this topic.  8.) What kind of response have you received since Howard announced his planned changes to the marriage act? Are you receiving lots of positive feedback?? Despite this apparent set back, are you hopeful of positive change in the future??  ANS: Yes. Lots of good feedback, especially from people who would otherwise have voted Labor. Change in the future? Of course! Everything changes. It's a question of when, not if.  9.) You said in my previous email to you that you thought Howard's motive was to wedge labor. The issue doesn't seem to have got that much media traction. Do you think his gambit may have fizzled? Or perhaps that the fear it provoked was successful in getting Latham to go along with it, without demur?  ANS: Got it in one. As soon as Latham said "yes" to the marriage ban, the issue was essentially diffused. The next beat-up will come when the ALP agrees to send the Bill to committee in the next two weeks, and the Gov't will scream about Labor, "causing a delay in the passage of the Bill which will allow activist judges to support gay marriages with test cases, and by-passing the will of parliament, bleat, bleat ......"   Thanks so much for your time so far!!  ANS: Okies. BG Perth.  Kind regards,  Chris Saliba

      Meg Lees, of the Australian Progressive alliance, has a good entry on her  urlLink Blog  for June 8, with regards to the Four Corners show on what an officer in the Australian Defence Forces was doing writing responses to the Red Cross report on Abu Ghraib prison abuses. What was he doing? Why was he scripting a letter saying the Geneva Conventions need not apply to all prisoners?   The Senator writes:  "This raises a number of extremely worrying questions:   What is the official role in Iraq, of this Australian Major, who visited the prison on a number of occasions after the October report from the ICRC was received?   What was this officer’s purpose in going to the prison in this period? Were his visits part of an ongoing, normal duty, or were they specifically in response to the ICRC Report?   Who is providing advice to Australian military personnel in Iraq, about what is a legal action according to international and Australian law? Is it this officer?   If it is this officer, fulfilling such an important role, why does the government continue to refer to him as a ‘junior officer’ who should not be subjected to questions at the Senate Estimates Committee? Alternatively, if he is such a ‘junior officer’, why is he charged with such an important role in Iraq?   And if this Major is such a ‘junior officer’, why has the Australian government allowed him such autonomy that he can participate in the drafting of a letter which justifies a denial of rights under the Geneva Convention?   If this officer acted without the authority of the Australian Government, why is he not being disciplined for compromising the integrity of the Australian government and military?"

      The branch members of Kinsford Smith have chucked a wobbly at  urlLink Mark Latham's green light  to Peter Garrett, who has all but given the seat away if he wants it.   Furthermore, health spokeswoman  urlLink Julia Gillard  has said Mr Latham is sure to get his way on the matter, despite the furor it's created.  Interesting to note Latham has written extensively and with much derision about decisions being imposed from above, and the need for greater grass roots democracy.   And Barry Cohen, former Labor MP, had a few interesting things to say in  urlLink The Australian

      Yesterday's  urlLink Age  reported some interesting comments from the acting Prime Minister, John Anderson. In relation to gay people he said:   "I do think it's a choice and . . . that's a choice people have an absolute entitlement to make, but . . . if I choose a particular lifestyle, certain other things are not open to me," he said.  I presume this means he has 'chosen', from a wide range of options, a heterosexual 'lifestyle'.  Mark Latham weighed into the  urlLink Playschool Lesbian Scandal , basically agreeing with the government on the matter.   urlLink Matt Price's  article today on Latham was a good one too.

      An excellent book by  urlLink Gabriel Kolko  about how US foreign policy has been developed in an ad hoc fashion over the past 50 years, and has now led to our current dilemmas.   Published in 2002, before the invasion of Iraq, one of the book's major themes is that wars may be won, but the political outcomes are always failures. And a million miles away from a war's original intentions.  'We can never forget,' he writes, 'that the two men whom the United States has most demonised over the past two decades, Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, both collaborated for years with it; Washington believed their causes were identical and put vast sums at their disposal.'  Also:  'Communism and fascism were products of grave errors in the international order and affairs of states that the First World War created........'

      I have just finished Iranian author and filmaker Siba Shakib's book Afghanistan,  urlLink Where God Only Comes To Weep.   It is unrelenting in its grimness, and reminded me of Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. One of the descriptions of mutilated Russian soldiers made me feel ill for days.  The book tells the story of Shirin-Gol (which means sweet flower)and her life in refugee camps, under the Taliban and civil war in general. Depressing reading, and an up close look at the reality of the lives of millions.

      I could have added further examples of office language for my  urlLink Heckler  piece that was published in the Sydney Morning Herald June 3.  Like 'Desk Drop Communication' - which is when a piece of paper with a note on it is placed on your desk.  Or 'Feedback'. A colleague of mine once took a phone call from an extremely angry customer, dissatisfied with our service. After twenty minutes or so of taking abuse my colleague at last took advantage of a break in the customer's ranting to say, 'Well, first I'd just like to thank you for that feed back'.

      This was the second Quarterly Essay, published in 2001. I think I've read most of the Quarterly Essays. Some are okay, but most I find pretty tepid. It's more a left / small 'l' liberal thing than anything else. A lot of the writing can be precious and too careful. Plus I think there's a lot of padding, or overwriting.  Robert Manne's essay I found too bitchy. Guy Rundle's on John Howard just so-so, nothing earth shattering. Amanda Lohrey's on the Green's too airy-fairy, with little real substance. Don Watson on our relationship with the USA was his usual effete self. Novelist David Malouf's essay was just plain boring. Germaine Greer's was okay, but she lets her loopiness get in the way of some interesting ideas. Who else can I remember? Political journalist Mango McCallum - about the Tampa 'crisis'. That was a pretty good essay. Tim Flannery's on the environment was very good, nicely written. Plus Gideon Haigh's essay on CEO's - I probably enjoyed that one the best. He's funny and clever, without seeming forced. Labor man John Button's essay wasn't bad, but nothing earth shattering. Paul McGeough (from the Sydney Morning Herald) is next, about the war in Iraq. That should be interesting, seeing he's been reporting from there since the war began.  I didn't realise until I read the introduction that this John Birmingham was the same one who wrote He Died with a Falafel in his hand. Much has been written on East Timor, by people far more engaged in the subject that J. Birmingham. You can have your criticisms of John Pilger, but at least he writes with real anger and urgency on the subject.  Mr Birmingham's essay was okay. I found it a bit too carefully written - a bit too self concious. He uses expressions like 'dysfunctional paradigm' etc. etc. As I said, much has already been written on the subject, and I don't think the author added anything really new.  I found the part on the Indonesian military interesting. He said their military is no match for ours, that's it's only good for terrorising Timorese peasants. I remember reading Kenneth Davidson in the Age writing the same thing.  Pretty much a forgettable essay. Read John Pilger or Noam Chomsky instead.

      Daniel Defoe is probably better known for his two classics, Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders. I found Robinson Crusoe boring, I'm embarrassed to admit. But that could just be me. I remember flipping through the last twenty pages, not really reading them at all.  Moll Flanders was another matter. That won me over right away. It sets itself up as a cautionary tale against doing evil, with Moll forever wringing her hands over her immoral past, but then - thankfully for the reader - goes through all of her sins in the most lurid detail. I remember a favourite scene where she advises how to successfully rob people. Yell fire, because people will always run mad when you say there is a fire going on, and then you have free reign to make the most of the disorder.  I thought the Journal of the Plague year utterly brilliant. I had always presumed it was what its title says, a journal by Defoe of a year he experienced the plague, but it's actually a work of fiction. Defoe was five years old in 1665, the year of the plague he describes where some 100,000 Londoners died. He wrote the novel in 1722, using available records for detail.  I've never read anything like it. It's just page after page of death, people fearing death, people fleeing London to avoid death, doctors and priests taking to the hills.  Then there are descriptions of those who come off worst: the poor, who had no choice but to stay behind. Defoe leaves no stone unturned. He even goes into all the economic consequences of the plague. For example, a lot of builders were left without work due to the surplus of empty houses that were left after whole families perished.  The descriptions of quacks and mountebacks and all manner of tricksters peddling bogus cures for the plague also remind of how little we have moved from the 17th Century. The low popular culture of 1665 is pretty much the same as the low popular culture of 2004.   You knew you had plague if you found a 'token' on your body - a spot the size of a coin or token. Death would not be far off. These people were avoided or locked up in houses and guarded against escape. Worse than the infected were what Defoe describes as 'the well' - people who seemed sound, but were carrying the 'distemper'. Here's a good quote.  'Now it was impossible to know these People (the well), nor did they sometimes, as I have said, know themselves to be infected: These were the People that so often dropt down and fainted in the Streets; or oftentimes they would go about the Streets to the last, till on a sudden they would sweat, grow faint, sit down at a door and die: It is true, finding themselves thus, they would struggle hard to get home to their own doors, or at other times  would be just able to go to their Houses and die instantly; other times they would go about till they had the very Tokens come out upon them, and yet know it, and would die an Hour or two after they came Home, but be as well as long as they were abroad. These were the dangerous People, these were the People of whom the well ought to have been afraid; but then on the other side it was impossible to know them.'  The book makes you feel like you are actually there. Read it if you want to be filled with dread.

      My knowledge of economics wouldn't get me an entry level position&nbsp;at one of Alan Bond's dodgier operations, but I've been reading bits and pieces about the FTA agreement with the United States that we are soon - the Howard Government at least hopes - to sign.  I agree with Mark Latham. What's the rush? It seems important that we take time to look at the ins and outs of it before we get mauled by the an economic behemoth like the United States. It's especially worrying that so many medical groups think the PBS will be compromised by the agreement.  Then there's the local content rules. Do we want to be swamped with American TV?? More so than now??   urlLink Senator Meg Lees  has written a good entry on her blog with lots of useful links.

      My  urlLink article  about John Howard's plan to amend the marriage act was published at Margo Kingston's web diary Wednesday 21st.   I've already had a request to reprint it - in a West Australian Lesbian magazine. And Senator Brian Greig, whom I interviewed, liked it and wants me to give an opinion on an article he is writing!   The Web is wonderful!

      I finished The Curious Incident of the Dog today. While I did enjoy reading it, I can't understand why it's so huge.  The character of the autistic boy was well done, but I didn't like the adult characters at all. They just continually use the 'F' word with each other. I wish the author could have given us a bit more diversity when describing their characters.  Plus the plot I found a bit weird. The father of the autistic boy, Christopher, kills the dog of the title. Basically, he kills the dog out of sexual jealousy. You see, his wife had run off with a neighbour's husband, and so he took out all his frustration on the poor dog, which belonged to the wife of the man who ran off with Christopher's mother (does that make sense??). Strange, I know. And it doesn't exactly make him a likable character.   Anyhoo, the father also lies to his son, telling him that his mother actually died of a heart attack, all the while keeping secret letters that she had written to Christopher.  Christopher finds out about these letters while investigating the dead dog. Soon the secret is out and Christopher is on his way to London to find his mother.  The book calls itself a mystery, but the father blurts out half way through the book that he killed the dog, and that is that. We aren't given that much detail or depth about why a man would kill a dog with a gardening tool.  The feel good part is the end, where Christopher triumphs over his adversity. I think the book uses a pretty common ruse - the simpleton who is very smart. All the way through the book Christopher balks at being touched - making us want to reach out to him.  An enjoyable enough read though. Based on its current success I imagine a movie and follow up books and god knows what else.

      In his autobiography, Anthony Trollope wrote that it was impossible to write a novel 'without love' - that is, love as an intergral part of the plot. He claimed the one time he tried to write a novel without love in it it turned out a turkey.  He also insisted that anyone could write a novel, should they sit down at a desk every day and work at it. If he were alive today I would agree with him, but with this caveat: not everyone could write an Anthony Trollope novel.  Trollope seemed to be almost saying that writing love stories was a chore to him. Ironically, never did a man spend so much time writing stories about love! I suspect a closet romance novelist - of sorts, anyway.  I have always been intrigued by Trollope's women. He writes about women with a large degree of sympathy, and creates compelling female characters.  In the first few pages of The Small House at Allington he writes this terrific passage:  'Women at forty do not become ancient misanthropes, or stern Rhadamanthine moralists, indifferent to the world's pleasures - no, not even though they be widows. There are those who think that such should be the phase of their minds. I profess that I do not so think. I would have women, and men also, young as long as they can be young.'  Then there is this extraordinary line:  'But men are cowards before women until they become tyrants....'  I have read about a dozen of Trollope's novels. My favourite is The Way We Live Now, a doozie about political corruption that could have been written yesterday. The Small House, one of his pastoral novels, I found very enjoyable, but not on the level of his masterpiece The Way We Live.  It tells the story of love gone askew and has a realistic and depressing ending.  The main character, Lily Dale, is jilted by the shallow social climber Adolphus Crosbie. He throws her over for the dull yet socially superior Alexandrina de Courcy. Adolphus ends up unhappily married.  Lily Dale all the while had a more suitable prospect, the vigorous, straight down the line Johnny Eames. When Eames proposes, Lily Dale morbidly insists she must stay faithful to the memory of her first love, Mr Crosbie.  Lily turns into a young Miss Havisham, jilted, but clinging to the memory of her first love.   Trollope admitted to being impatient with Lily Dale. And my reading of the ending is that women should seek sexual fulfilment where possible, and not retain such a fundamentalist attitude to love and marriage.   Despite this, the 650 page novel ends unhappily, all of us wishing that Johnny Eames and Lily Dale could get it together!  The moral: take love where and when you can find it........

      Well, Ms Insider Trading has been given a lenient five month sentence. I wonder if Oprah will still be flogging her 'good things' on her show.  &nbsp;  Chris Hubbard has given me the link to a  urlLink letter  that Ms Stewart wrote to the federal judge that sentenced her. Read it all - but make sure you have a puke bucket nearby. She knows no shame.  &nbsp;  For starters, she shouldn't be writing to a federal judge and asking for a 'one on one' discussion. That is not how the legal system works. You don't curry favour with judges!  &nbsp;  Nor does she seem willing to confront her own behaviour, but talks rather about 'perceptions' of her behaviour.  &nbsp; In fact, she has&nbsp;the hide to compare herself to  urlLink Nelson Mandela , and calls her lies to the government&nbsp;'a small personal matter'.  &nbsp;  And to think, she's put herself through all of this just for a lousy few extra thousand dollars.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I woke up this morning to the ABC news blaring out that asylum seekers on Temporary Protection Visas will be able to now apply for permanent visas. I was a bit shocked at this, considering the Government's continued tough line.   urlLink Meg's desk  gives a good going through of how mean the TPVs were, but says it doesn't change much.   You have to wonder at the change. Why would Howard do it? Apparently, the answer lies in the  urlLink marginal seats  that have TPV workers. The people have become attached to them and want them to stay.  Marion Le, from the Independent Council for Refugee Advocacy, was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald:  "Amanda Vanstone wants to clean up the mess that's there before it becomes an issue in those marginal regional seats," Ms Le said.  "Some would say that's cynical but in my view it's commonsense.  "This is an indication of people power at work. The rural voters say we want these people to stay in our communities and work."  Talk about ironic. You'd think it would be the so called redneck voter who would want a tougher line on immigration. Apparently not.  I heard on the radio that Howard caved into pressure from his back benchers. Let's hope the whole nasty Tampa episode might be unraveling a bit.

      I'm not one to talk out of turn, but what's the big deal about Charlie Chaplin??  I watched Modern Times the other day, a DVD copy picked up from the Melbourne CAE library. The first time I saw it was as a teenager at St. Bedes. I must admit, I really enjoyed it when I first saw it.  My second viewing gave me a creepy feeling about Charlie Chaplin. I didn't like his tramp character's complete and utter innocence. The way he jauntily trundles along is really annoying. In fact, I found his character INSIPID. It's like he's a child in an adult's body - and he stays continually in this immature mode, never learning anything from his experiences.  I know, people will point to some of Charles Dickens' innocents - like Oliver Twist. But he wasn't a grown man running around like a two year old!  Then there is the political aspect of Modern Times, not to mention his other films. I have no quarrel with his making a film about the negative aspects of modernity. It's just that it's all so didactic. Everything is done in the service of pushing his political agenda. The tramp character is just a complete VICTIM all the way through the film.  And the ending was plain awful, with him and Paulette Goddard ambling off into nowhere, with that god awful song 'Smile' playing. Again, they looked like two children walking into the sunset, and they're both grown adults. What are we supposed to make of this? That people will be continually kicked in the teeth, so they should take it with good cheer?  Give me the brilliantly misanthropic W C Fields any day.  I checked up  urlLink Pauline Kael  on Charlie Chaplin. She famously dissed Limelight. Here are a few of her comments:  'Chaplin's range as an actor is quite probably as wide as he thinks it is, but his range as a creative intelligence is certainly considerably less. He is almost the only man who is in the position to use the film medium for personal statement. (It is questionable if other creative film-makers would wish to do so; his aim may be as unique as his opportunity). His ideas and personality have pervaded his last three films. Verdoux remains fascinating, impudent enough to make one toss overboard some minor reservations. Mercifully in Verdoux the ideas are not nearly so explicit as in The Great Dictator and Limelight where the failures of taste and creative insight are alternately embarrassing and infuriating.  As Robert Duncan remarked, "It would have taken W.C. Fields spitting into Calvero's passed hat to restore the comic genius."  The Chaplin of Limelight is no irreverent little clown; his reverence for his own ideas would be astonishing even if the ideas were worth consideration. They are not-and the context of the film exposes them at every turn. The exhortations in the directions of life, courage, consciousness, and "truth" are set in a story line of the most self-pitying and self-glorifying daydream variety. Calvero's gala benefit in which he shows the unbelievers who think him finished that he is still the greatest performer of them all, his death in the wings as the applause fades--this is surely the richest hunk of gratification since Huck and Tom attended their own funeral. It was humor in Twain's day; Chaplin serves it at face value a hundred years later.'

      This was Thomas Hardy's first published novel. He wrote a previous novel called The Poor Man and the Lady, which was rejected by three publishing houses. Advised to write a pot boiler  - or 'sensation novel' - he duly complied. Desperate Remedies is the result.  There is plenty of the key Hardy traits in the novel, or what I have picked up so far from reading his stories.   A lot of the mood is very rich and strange indeed. The first half of the novel he spends building up a lot of bizarre characters and situations. Miss Aldclyffe is a good example, whose haughty tone and behind the scenes wheeling and dealing reminded me of something out of the Marquis de Sade (she helps coax the young Cytherea into a questionable marriage).  The evil Aeneas Manston reminded  me of the rake Lovelace out of Samuel Richardson's 18th century uber novel Clarissa (apparently the biggest novel in English). I wait to read a Hardy biography to see if Richardson had any major influence on Hardy. Described as extraordinarily beautiful, Manston's dark and brooding character made for fun reading!  Sometimes I wonder if Hardy had a very black sense of humour, like Christopher Marlowe, or Shakespeare  in his spoof Titus Andronicus, which we are supposed to believe is a tragedy.   When we discover that Manston has a wife that he has been concealing, Hardy has her killed off, barely having set foot in the town where the action takes place. Nor are we made to feel any sympathy for her. She is described by Manston as a 'third rate actress', 'an American' and even on the last pages, as a rum drinker!  Eunice Manston, the first wife, spends a night at the Three Tranter Inn, which catches fire and kills her with it (although later plot developments change this very fact).  Yet as we read, we are happy to see her go, because she is a hindrance to Manston's desire to marry Cytherea. And the death is so ridiculous, and so promptly done, that it comes across (to me anyway) as funny. After they discover she is dead a villager describes her as now nothing but a 'cinder'. Whatever happened to respect for the dead?  When I was first reading the novel I thought, this is pretty good, maybe close to some of his later novels, but the over contrived, popular plot ruined it a bit. Populism may have worked for Charlotte Bronte (she was told to write a pot boiler, and came up with Jane Eyre), but I think Hardy is better to leave it alone.

      You'd never know that Kevin Phillips voted twice for Ronald Reagan, and was a Republican Party strategist. His book Wealth and Democracy reads more like a Noam Chomsky anti-globalisation diatribe.  I read this book after reading his fantastic American Dynasty, which covered four generations of the Bush family.  Wealth and Democracy is just as good. The book basically outlines how money concentrates at the top, and how governement, when captured by rich special interest and lobby groups, helps to push the money upwards.  Despite what many right wing thinkers tell us, that Markets and Democracy go together, the author states the opposite. He tells us that markets have their origin in Medieval fairs.  'Market theology and unelected leadershiphave been displacing politics and elections. Either democracy must be renewed, with politics brought back to life, or wealth is likely to cement a new and less democratic regime - plutocracy by some other name.'

      I just finished Margo's book the other day. I thought it would be more of a bulging diatribe aimed at the Howard Government, but it's more than that.  Yes, she goes through a lot of the Howard years scandals. Remember how the parliament was locked down for George 'I love free speech' Bush? West Australian press gallery reporter Karen Middleton had to explain to American security that it was the wire in her bra that was setting off a super powered metal detector.  In the end, however, the book sees Howard as someone who has left a mess behind which we must clean up. There are some excellent contributions from her 'webdiarsts'.  The basic premise of the book? Australian democracy, Use it or Lose it.  The book features a  urlLink web site .    urlLink Here  is the speech that was given by Justice Tony Fitzgerald at the book's launch.  By way,  urlLink here  is my review that I contributed to the web site.

      I always thought John Pilger was indulging in a bit of hyperbole when he said the United States was the world's biggest exporter of terrorism. Having read the Sorrows of Empire, I now totally agree.   urlLink Chalmers Johnson  is a former cold warrior. He supported the Vietnam war and thought the hippies and students opposing it didn't know what they were on about. In his last book, Blowback, he says he wish he'd been more open minded to what these critics were saying.  Mr Johnson has followed up the prescient Blowback, which he wrote before the September 11 attacks, with an awesome indictment of the United States and its non stop military culture. He makes the distinction between being prepared for war, an army trained to fight wars, and militarism, a constant military culture.  I haven't read a book that explains so well the US military presence that straddles the globe. There are some 725 listed military bases the world over - many more remain secret. Soldiers serving on these bases are exempted from the laws of the host country, under agreements made with the United States. Thus, many crimes committed by these soldiers on foreign army bases - murder, rape, criminal negligence resulting in civilian deaths - pretty much go unpunished. Anyone who has studied the My Lai massacre, and knows how the ringleader got off pretty much scott free, will know what I'm talking about.  This is one of the many reasons for anti-American sentiment in foreign countries. When two soldiers raped a twelve year old girl on the Japanese island of Okinawa - a US military base since the second world war - thousands turned out to protest.  The book brilliantly details the frightening amount of power the Pentagon wields. The money spent - and lost, or rather wasted - is staggering:  'This "circulation of elites" tends to undercut attempts at congressional oversight of either the Defense Department or defense contractors. The result is an almost total loss of accountability for public money spent on military projects of any sort. As Insight magazine journalist Kelly O'Meara has noted, in May 2001 the deputy inspector general at the Pentagon "admitted that $4.4 trillion in adjustments to the Pentagon's books had to be cooked to compile ...required financial statements and that $1.1 trillion.....was simply gone and no one can be sure of when, where or to whom the money went."'  I need not say where the money could have been better spent. Instead, the US spends loads of cash in training armies in other countries. Only recently I read that the US is looking at spending $700 million on training 'friendly' militias in foreign countries.  That's what can be understood as exporting terror.  There is a good chapter on globalization too. He quotes Lawrence Summers, who was the chief economist at the World Bank:  'On December 12, 1991, Summers became notorious for a leaked memo to senior officials of the bank encouraging polluting industries in the rich nations to relocate to the less developed countries. He wrote, "I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage countries is impeccable and we should face up to that."'  This is literally exporting our own crap to the poorer parts of the world. And we wonder why people protest this?  On our involvement in the Iraq war Mr Johnson has this to say:  'Why the British and Australians went along with this fiasco when they could so easily have stood for something other than 'might makes right' remains a mystery.'  The book is indeed a sorrowful one, only because, following Shakepeare's past is prologue formula, the empire will end, and it won't be pretty. I quote the book's last paragraph in full.  'There is one development that could conceivably stop this process of overreaching: the people could retake control of Congress, reform it along with the corrupted elections laws that have made it into a forum for special interests, turn it into a genuine assembly of democratic representatives, and cut off the supply of money to the Pentagon and the secret intelligence agencies. We have a strong civil society that could, in theory, overcome the entrenched interests of the armed forces and the military-industrial complex. At this late date, however, it is difficult to imagine how Congress, much like the Roman senate in the last days of the republic, could be brought back to life and cleansed of its endemic corruption. Failing such a reform, Nemesis, the goddess of retribution and vengeance, the punisher of pride and hubris, waits impatiently for her meeting with us.'

      When I looked at the cover of Plan of Attack I groaned. Can I really be bothered reading another book about George W. Bush and Iraq? I read Bob Woodward's last book, Bush's War. I don't remember much of it, only Karl Rove, Bush's chief advisor, describing a crowd's enthusiastic reaction to Bush's throwing the first pitch of some baseball season as akin to a Nazi rally. My eyes popped out. Only John Pilger says things like that about Bush and his cohorts. Check out Rove in the index and you'll find it.  With Plan of Attack it only took a few pages and I was totally hooked. It's a real insider's view, with lots of detail and conversations and brisk portraits. You get a good impression of how this particular power elite really works, who's in the loop, who's not (Colin Powell).  The author for the most part holds back from making any judgements on what he is reporting, although you get the impression he is quite moderate on the questions he raises.  For example, he talks about how high level sources were telling him that they weren't entirely convinced by the intelligence that the CIA was giving out. Woodward toyed with reporting what he'd been told, but held off. He later appears to regret this:  'Even now I cannot disclose the identities of the sources. But I did not feel I had enough information to effectively challenge the official conclusions about Iraq's alleged WMD. In light of subsequent events, I should have pushed for a front page story, even on the eve of war, presenting more forcefully what our sources were saying.'  Bush is his usual glib self. The book also makes plain Bush's 'on a mission from God' belief in himself. On page 379 the president prays for success in war, after he opened hostilities:  'It was emotional for me. I prayed that our troops be safe, protected by the Almighty, that there be minimal loss of life.'  And:  'Going into this period, I was praying for strength to do the Lord's will. I'm surely not going to justify war based upon God. Understand that. Nevertheless, in my case I pray that I be as good a messenger of His will as possible. And then, of course, I prayed for personal strength and forgiveness.'  You won't hear Australian commentators talking about that when it comes to discussions of Iraq.  Then there is the Bush that visited the war wounded, and his glib advice. To a soldier who'd lost a leg:  'Bush told the soldier that one of his former aides in Texas had lost his leg, and the guy was a runner who learned to run on his prosthesis. "They can make 'em good these days," Bush added. 'You'll be able to run again".'  'One of the president's assistants saw a look on the soldier's face that said that he didn't believe that the commander in chief's saying he would run again would make it so.'  Finally, Bush balks at being asked about WMD.  'I said I was asking these questions because I wanted to show in the book what he thought the status of the WMD search was. "Why do you need to deal with this in the book?' he asked. "What's this got to do about it?".'  Need I say anymore?

      Here we go again.  It's becoming now so blatantly obvious that the FTA has little to do with economic matters and much, much more to do with bottom-of-the barrel politics. Every conservative nut case in town is braying that the Labor party under Latham is anti-American. That's what the debate about the FTA has now come down to.  Probably the worst offender is the atrocious Tony Abbott, on  urlLink ABC's Lateline  (3 August), in debate with Julia Gillard:  "TONY ABBOTT: Well, we're not going to put an unnecessary and unworkable amendment into the enabling legislation just so that Mark Latham has a feather to fly with Labor's anti-American Left.We're not going to pander to the basically anti-American instinct of the Labor Party and its leader."  Oh brother, how stupid can you get. Are people buying this sort of rubbish?  Then there was Media Watch star  urlLink Janet Albrechtson  in the Australian:  "WHILE the ALP may have given a slow-motion thumbs up to Australia's free trade agreement with the US, it will do little to allay fears that anti-Americanism is still writ large on the party's psyche."   urlLink Alan Kohler  summarised things nicely. Referring to two competing studies on the subject, he goes on to say:  "They are now most useful as door stops: it turns out the FTA is not about economics or trade. It's about politics. More specifically, it is about the positioning and identity of the Australian Left, which is largely defined by anti-Americanism and for which the FTA has become a totem."  Now Latham has pulled out another trick, with his amendments to protect the PBS. And John Howard? Last words to Alan Kohler:  "If John Howard set this up on purpose, he is a genius. The one issue that would always bring the ALP Left wing and business people into conflict, with Mark Latham caught in the middle, is a bilateral trade deal with America."  And I read John Howard is determined to pass the  urlLink anti-gay marriage legislation  before the next election. My god he's a creep.

      I believe it was Flaubert who once said 'Touch our idols and the guilt comes off on our hands'. I think he wrote that in Madame Bovary. Not that Mark Latham was anyone's idol, but he certainly had the media starry eyed there for a while. That might be over now.  I'm surprised everyone is so amazed at Latham's backing of the FTA, even after he said he wouldn't. I've always thought he was big on talk, but when squeezed, would do whatever was politically expedient. Sure, he's been tough with his 'home by Christmas pledge'. Although he has brought in Bomber Beazley from the cold as a kind of ointment to rub on US wounds - the big sooks. But that was certainly a gaffe, and he must regret opening his big mouth and boxing himself into a corner.   urlLink Christian Kerr  at Crikey.com.au has bemoaned the passing of the old Latham. But I wonder if this is just the political reality of Latham sinking in, after his brilliant beginning. In government, would he revert back to his old feisty self, and do what the hell he likes? Or would he be a more calculating political operator?   urlLink Michelle Grattan  summarised nicely why Latham had no choice but to sign:  "Mark Latham began in January with his bolshie line "no sugar, no deal" and later flirted from time to time with saying "no" to the agreement, which needs Labor numbers to pass the Senate. But that would have been suicidal.  It would have revived the wider issue of the American alliance, which Labor has been at pains to calm after Latham stirred the dust with his policy of pulling Australian troops out of Iraq. It would have negated some of the benefit of putting pro-American Kim Beazley on the front bench."  So much for the actual merits of the agreement. It seems to be just signed for political reasons, not economic or the national interest. Just to keep chummy with the US, or Howard's mate George W. Bush.   urlLink John Garnaut  wrote this excellent piece in the Sydney Morning Herald. He shows the extraodinary amount of disagreement over the deal:  "On February 8, after just 11 months of negotiations, the Prime Minister, John Howard, picked up the phone to George Bush and sealed the deal.  HOWARD'S trade deal with the US split his negotiating team. It has since split farmers, business people, the Labor Party and the free trade community. Political commentators and editorial writers have lined up mainly in support, economics editors have mainly opposed.  Business people have attacked public interest groups, economists have attacked each other's work, film stars have cried in front of politicians and the Government has been praised and pilloried from all directions."  Even  urlLink Meg Lees  at her blog is hammering on about it again, urging much, much more consideration of the ins and outs of the deal.  The more and more you read about it, the more and more bizarre the whole thing seems. Labor's own economic modelling says there's around an extra 53 million a year in it for us. It seems like peanuts - around $2.50 per man, woman and child (if my sums are correct, probably not).  There are so many economic questions hanging over it, and how it will benefit Australians. And Mark Latham is signing off on it so he's not accused of being anti-American? This from the fearless warrior who had a real go at George W. Bush?  I wonder what Latham will do when the Senate Committe on amendments to the marriage act reports on October 8?

      I refer to Mark Latham's apparent dithering over the FTA. What's he got up his sleeve? So far he's kicked the issue to a Senate inquiry, which will  urlLink report soon, maybe today.   Labor seems to be divided down the middle on the issue.  urlLink Alan Ramsey  in the SMH puts the numbers like this:  'While in theory it is supposed to be a matter for the entire Labor parliamentary caucus to decide, it is Latham's decision that will determine what happens. And that decision will be made in the shadow ministry, not the full caucus. Once Latham's front bench decides its recommendation, based on Latham's attitude, that will lock in all 32 members of Labor's front bench to a collective decision. This, in turn, will determine the formal caucus outcome, whatever the vote of Labor's backbenchers.  One count of the front bench, on a notional free vote, this week put the numbers at 16 in favour (Stephen Conroy, Kim Beazley, Mark Bishop, Jacinta Collins, David Cox, Simon Crean, Annette Ellis, Joel Fitzgibbon, Robert McClelland, Bob McMullan, Nicola Roxon, Kevin Rudd, Nick Sherry, Stephen Smith, Wayne Swan and Kelvin Thomson), 13 against (Jenny Macklin, John Faulkner, Anthony Albanese, Kim Carr, Chris Evans, Martin Ferguson, Laurie Ferguson, Julia Gillard, Alan Griffin, Kate Lundy, Daryl Melham, Kerry O'Brien and Lindsay Tanner) and two uncertain: (Craig Emerson and Gavan O'Connor). The 32nd vote, of course, is the only one that really counts, if he exercises his authority. And that is Latham's vote.'   Many commentators are saying Labor will pass it - they've got no choice but to. Come again? You'd never know we're an independent democracy.  It's interesting to read this extract from Mr Latham sometime in 2002:  "I would also argue that the Minister for Employment [Tony Abbott] is more British than Australian. He is, in his values and public statements, born in Britain, basically hanging out the backside of the British monarch whenever he can. I stand up for Australian sovereignty, and I say to the people in my electorate that it is the Labor Party that is the patriotic party in this country. We will not surrender our interests in the United States by entering into a free trade agreement that allows for enormous subsidies in the United States..."  Big words. How can he be sitting on the fence now?  And on February 9 he told ABC radio:  "Based on what we know at this stage, this [FTA] deal doesn't appear to be in Australia's national interest. In fact, this is not a free trade agreement, not at all, it's a partial trade agreement." And the same night, on ABC television's 7.30 Report, when Howard pronounced: "It is an historic agreement. It will add enormous long-term benefits to Australia," Latham told the program: "Quite frankly, our farmers have been dudded ... The Government should have been standing up for the interests of our farm sector, not rolling over and defying [our] best interests ... "  Talk about stuck in the bind. Now will come the real test of his words. Will he refuse to pass the FTA as it stands, or do 'the inevitable', seeing he has 'no choice'?  The best recent article on Mr Latham comes from the Age's  urlLink Shaun Carney . He's basically saying that Latham is keeping all his cards close to his chest, that's why no one can fathom his strategy. Mr Carney is right on the money.
