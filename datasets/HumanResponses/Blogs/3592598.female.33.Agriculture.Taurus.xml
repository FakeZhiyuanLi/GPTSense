      What an ironic situation... today is the opening of Spiderman 2.  Coincidentally, this evening, I was outside sweeping my porch between reading chapters in my college classes.  Something caught my eye & I happened to look up on my rock wall exterior.  There, perched between 2 rocks was a HUGE tarantula!  OH MY GOD!  It's body is about 1 1/2" big & the legs measure from end to end, probably 4" big.  Talk about screaming bloody murder.  So, of course I call my friend who is a 5th grade science teacher.  I know she'd get a kick out of it, considering last year, she had a pet tarantula.  She helped guide me thru the process of scooping it up into a small tupperware container, putting the lid on it temporarily & then transferring it to my now-empty hermit crab container.  Talk about more screaming!  I told her that she would have to suffer thru the screams in order for me to get thru this process.  The damn thing is hoisted on it's back legs, ready to strike.  He's not a happy camper.  (she helped me assertain sex of the stupid thing...)  He's in his new home now.  We shall see if he climbs back off his legs & gets happy in his new home.  I think the rain & the fact that my landlord had someone come over & trim my tree today has brought him out of his home....  But here's a thought.... where there's 1, could there be 2???????  His name is Spidey... I have named him.  HOLY CRAP, THERE'S A HUGE SPIDER IN MY LIVING ROOM!!!!  And, of course, now I have the "itchy" feeling all over my body.. as if he was climbing on me.... YIKES!

      Remind me again why I chose to go back to college?  I'm soooo friggin overwhelmed! I  hope that I can keep all this up - full-time work, full-time school, part-time taking care of chores & stuff at home.... It's been 4 week since I started.  Next semester will be even more interesting - I will be taking a Math class (which I know I will struggle in) & a Science hopefully.  I will be going to class 4 nites a week - 4 for Math & 2 for Science.  WHAT WAS I THINKING?!  I hope I can get thru this.  I'm taking Friday off to work on school work, filling out grant applications & other stuff.  Arghhhhhhh....  Other than that, the news of the day is the same - more killings in Iraq.  I really do believe we shouldn't be there at all.  We have no business being there.  We need to bring our boys & girls home & just say "screw it" to Iraq.  We have our own problems to take care of here at home.  Why don't we focus our time, money & energy on that?  How friggin stupid...

      Ain't that a Country song??  Anyway, I didn't find my zip disk, so I hope whoever has it is happy with their new present.  I had to re-do my website; luckily I wasn't too far into it that I couldn't re-create it.  Well, I wish I had some exciting news to pass on tonite.  I don't.  It's been a good day - I was able to talk to a friend from Iraq on the telephone today.  He called just to say hello.  I was so surprised.  Life is rough over there..  he actually said the words "it's like Vietnam over here".  I was so upset when he said that.  I reassured him that most of the population is beyond proud of the job they do.  I hope to God he makes it back alive...  now he's talking about finishing his Reserve committment & going back as a civilian.  I just can't imagine what drives people to want to stay there.  He said the money definitely pushing him towards that.  I guess that's all the news for now.  I have to get back to homework.  I have tons of government homework to do...  Ciao~

      I had my zip disk... I am not believing this... somewhere between last Thursday in class & tonite, I have lost the @#&% thing.  I am hoping I left it in the computer at school.... God, one can only hope!  I went to the lake yesterday.  I look like a lobster today.  OUCH!  I was only out in the sun for MAYBE an hour.  That's pushing it.  The rest of the time, I was underneath shade, studying.  So much for fun at the lake, right?!  Oh well...  but it was a good picnic at the lake, regardless.  Well, I saw they beheaded that civilian Paul Johnson in Saudi.  Those people are pure & simple - savages.  It makes me sick to think that they can do such a horrific act to another human being & not feel an ounce of remorse.  We went in & killed a bunch of the people who did this to him.  So what?  I'm sure his family could care less that they are dead... all they know is that their father, friend, family member is dead.  Never coming back...  he did nothing wrong.  He lived in their country for over 10 years.  I'm not bitter about this, am I??

      So this morning, I decide to read a little bit in Time Magazine.  What was the 1st article I see on the table of contents?  Yup... you got it... A story on Blogs and how popular they have become.  This is so wicked because a week ago, I had never even heard of the term.. now, it's multiplying like rabbits!  No one won the Mega Millions Jackpot.  It's now $121M.  The Texas Lotto is tonite - $120M.  Yeah... I'll take a small chunk of that change.  I probably won't get anything... but if I do... WOW!  I just came back from Wally World.  I swear, I hate shopping at that place unless it's midnite.  I wish they'd hurry up & build the one in Harker Heights because the one in Killeen is a zoo!  Ok, gotta go study...  Ta ta for now. me

      Is that all we are worth these days?!  Just wondering...  I saw that the Texas Lottery is up towards $120M & the Mega Millions is at $100M.  Can you imagine winning both?!  My God... you'd see smoke trails behind me!  I can't even imagine what I would do with all that money.  I'm sure I would have tons of relatives & friends coming out of the woodworks.  New friends too!  I think I would buy a very large house in northern Italy & one in Greece (where I'm from).  One big house in the Carribean, and one somewhere in the mountains of the United States.  Maybe even one in Florida.  Heck, it would be hard to even think about where to live for the rest of my life.  But honestly, I would be happy with $1M.  I could live off of $1M for the rest of my life & never be hurting for money again.  Well, I guess I'll have to buy some lottery tickets today.  I know, I know... all I'm doing is helping someone else win more money.  Right?!  But wouldn't it be fun for me to be the one to win it!

      Well, I've been an emotional mess today.  I've been watching the Memorial coverage of Ronald Reagan's death all day.  This has been really hard to watch but I can't keep myself from watching it.  I want to remember this day always & forever.  I started bawling at work yesterday - there was this Marine Corp member saluting his casket at the Capitol.  He was a bi-amputee... but he was still saluting.  It was such a special moment for him.  I downloaded his picture and saved it to my desktop at work.  It gives me shivers every time I see it.  They showed it today as well, and again, the tears started.  I was watching the Today Show this morning before the funeral coverage began.  Katie Couric was showing an old story she ran about the love letters between Ronald & Nancy Reagan.  They were so special, so intimate... so personal.  Every thing about today has been sad... My Dad had cooked for him once when he was working at Watergate.  I have so many fond memories of President Reagan because he was "my President" growing up.  I was living in northern Virginia at the time.  We would hear different news about the President than was broadcasted in the world.  We had  the "funny" memories.  I remember when he called the Washington Redskins to congratulate them on their Superbowl victories.  He's this nation's Grandfather.  I will truly miss him.  Marianna

      Well, this is the 2nd posting of my blog.  We have had no internet or email access most of yesterday and until now, today here at work.  It's amazing how dependent we get on reading the news or checking email.  We don't know how long it will be down, so we are all scrambling to send email & do other Internet related issues.  Ahhhhh....  it's nice to be back in touch with society!

      Howdy... my name is Marianna & I live in Killeen.  I have to create this blog for an Internet class I'm taking at CTC.  What is a blog?!  I've never heard of it until yesterday!  How strange... well, even though I feel as if I know a lot about the Internet & I am called the Google Queen at work, I hope that I do learn a lot more about creating html codes & writing in javascript.  It will only better me at work, since I've been asked to assist in re-develop our work website.  It should be a lot of fun!  Anyway, a bit about me... I am a former Air Force member - very proud veteran.  I had a very good time in the Air Force & miss it very much.  I now work for a state agency in Temple.  Pretty good job.  Long story on that, I may share at a later date.  I was married for 6 1/2 years & have been divorced for almost 5.  I'm very excited about starting college.  This is my 1st class.  I feel that I have done a big disservice to myself by not completing my college diploma.  I have found that not having that piece of paper on my wall has only hurt me.  I hope to finish in a decent amount of time & hopefully do something I like.  Right now, I have no idea what that is!   Ok, that's enough about me for now.  Don't want to bore you right off the 1st note!  Thanks for reading! Marianna

      My life has taken on a very interesting twist in the last few weeks.&nbsp; I know that's a cryptic statement and perhaps in the next few weeks I'll be able to share it with you.&nbsp; Let's just say that the twist is in a very positive way.&nbsp; No worries... lol, it's not like I'm selling drugs or anything stupid like that...&nbsp; It's a very wonderful thing, where my mind will be clear on a lot of issues & able to accept certain new changes in my life.  I do wonder one thing... do you believe in fate or in destiny?&nbsp; What I mean by this question is ~ do you think our lives are predetermined or do we have control of what path we choose?&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; Is your life written, chapter by chapter, even before you were born, down to the last day on earth?&nbsp; Or do you feel that you have choices & the choices you make alter your destined path?&nbsp; I used to think we have control of our own lives.&nbsp; But then I watched Final Destination 2.&nbsp; Now, I still haven't seen #1, however #2 blew me out of the sky when I saw it last year.&nbsp; After that movie, I think we have no control over what happens in our lives.&nbsp; Our lives are already written.&nbsp; We just choose the path, but that choice is already written.&nbsp;&nbsp;So how is it that we choose the wrong path?&nbsp; Why can't we all make the right choices & live a happy, normal life?&nbsp; Because, our lives are pre-written...  Does that make any sense?  I want to go see The Village.&nbsp; It's the new movie out today.&nbsp; It's one of those suspenseful kinda movies... it's made by the same guy who made Sixth Sense & Signs.  Anyway, those are my thoughts for the day... I hope your day is going splendid!&nbsp; My day started out on such a positive note... it's really carried all the way thru so far!  Many hugs, me

      I found out I have to go to Dumas (in my twisted little mind it's pronounced Dumb Ass) in August for a Trade Show.&nbsp; Get this... it's an outdoor show!&nbsp; Texas.&nbsp; In August.&nbsp; Outdoors.&nbsp; Can we say INSANITY?!&nbsp; I'm soooooo not happy about that!&nbsp; But, oh well... I have no choice.  I'll be wearing boots & jeans, that's for sure!&nbsp; I'm sure I'll look just lovely picking sand outa my teeth.&nbsp; I swear, Dumb Ass in the summer is not where I want to be... (you know, I really need to watch myself - I'm liable to get shot at by some farmer out there... lol).&nbsp; I guess I better start pronouncing the name right..... DUMAS...&nbsp; DUMAS...&nbsp; DUMB ASS.... OOPS!&nbsp; lol  Anyway, I have to go August 23-26.&nbsp; Ughhhh....

      I feel steam rolled, but I'm back from camping.&nbsp; It was a good trip - I slept outside of the tent on a chaise recliner all weekend because it was so dang hot in the tent.&nbsp; The 1st nite, I didn't get enough sleep because I had to wake my friends up to go fishing at the butt-crack of dawn.&nbsp; Actually, come to think about it, it was before dawn - 5am.&nbsp; I decided to not go because I had kinda twisted my ankle the nite before & I didn't want to stand on it for too long.&nbsp; So I decided to take it easy that morning.&nbsp; I was a bit scared about sleeping outside the tent since we were in the Piney Woods of east Texas & I didn't know what kind of wildlife was out there.&nbsp; I was scared I'd wake up with a bear in my face... lol.&nbsp; But nothing ate us besides the flies & fire ants.&nbsp; Damn fire ants, they are everywhere!  The 2nd nite was a spectacular evening ~ I slept for 4.5 hours & my body felt rested.&nbsp; Yesterday we left (I ended up having a migraine on the way home which made it so much fun to drive!) & got home yesterday late afternoon.&nbsp; I took a 20 minute nap, woke up, unpacked my stuff out of my car (found a HUGE pile of fire ants that I had transported from east Texas), & went to bed around 11.&nbsp; I feel soooooooooo&nbsp;tired!&nbsp; I can't believe I'm functioning & awake (well, maybe not functioning... lol).&nbsp; But I'm here.&nbsp; At work.&nbsp; Kinda brain dead... but here.&nbsp; Blahhhhhh...  It was a good time ~ good to get away & relax.&nbsp; Somewhat... lol... you never relax on vacation.&nbsp; Most of our group stayed in air conditioned cabins with showers.&nbsp; Not my idea of camping, really.&nbsp; I did use their showers just because I felt cleaner & cooler after I did shower.&nbsp; But I wasn't gonna go camping & stay in air conditioning!&nbsp; Come on now!&nbsp; lol  Ok... so I'm back... and I'm pooped...

      Well, after class tonite, I'm heading out to east Texas to go camping.&nbsp; I hope it'll be a good weekend.&nbsp; I have some things to work out, so hopefully it'll give me some peace of mind to be out there.&nbsp; Plus, a ton of homework.  I hope for a lot... now, if only some of my wishes would come true...  See you Sunday nite...

      We've been asked to write about our experiences with cyberterrorism.&nbsp; At home, I know that I am not protected against traffic accessing my computer.&nbsp; I do not have a firewall, do not run an antivirus software on a regular basis &amp; probably have a few viruses on my system.&nbsp; I run Windows ME (don't laugh) &amp; thankfully, I don't have any major problems with my system, other than it crashing when I run it too fast (going from one website to another).&nbsp; I think I have a .dll error problem somewhere, but unfortunately, when it comes to computer repair, I'm a box of dumb rocks.&nbsp; I did run trend.com's antivirus software at one point in time&nbsp;&amp; it did detect a trojan virus... this was eons ago.&nbsp; I did run it again even more recently &amp; it did not find it, so I'm assuming that it's gone now. &nbsp; My&nbsp;friend in class is wondering why I don't type "AND" instead of "&amp;"... it's EASIER!&nbsp; Deal with it.&nbsp; &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; &nbsp; I do have a pop-up blocker at home.. it helps keep those annoying ads from popping up. &nbsp; Now, at work, I did have a pretty serious problem that wouldn't go away.&nbsp; It was a series of pop ups that would not go away.&nbsp; Somehow, someway, I had a program that installed itself onto my computer &amp; caused havoc.&nbsp; After 2 days solid of my IT guy helping me get rid of all that crap, it finally is working better.&nbsp; But now I have things tweaked so tight, I can't even breathe online... lol &nbsp; Ok, that's all I have for now.....&nbsp; &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; &nbsp; hahahahahahaha&nbsp; it's the attacks of the &amp;s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

CHOMP!&nbsp; He ate it like it was nothing!&nbsp; I put another 2 in there &amp; I just checked.. they are gone!&nbsp; These are baby crickets so they aren't too big for him.&nbsp; I need to get a water bowl in there &amp; he will be just fine.&nbsp; So, there ya go... a new pet in my home!&nbsp; I think I will call him Geico...

      Well, I got a 98% on my Govt midterm last nite.  I couldn't believe it.  For all I knew, it was written in Chinese.  I was so distracted by other events going on in my life, I couldn't concentrate on studying or even taking the test.  I was done with 50 questions in 12 minutes.  I never looked back to check my answers, never even bothered to question myself.  I just took it & was done!  So now I go back to same ol' boring homework... read, read & more read...  And hopefully survive life's events...  Wish me luck, I'm gonna need it.

      Well, all I did all day is study for this government midterm that I'm taking on Monday.  I swear, I feel like a box of dumb rocks sometimes.  The terminology is just not sinking in.  I went to Wally World for some groceries & that was a big mistake.  Tons of kids, people, shelf-stockers everywhere.  I get so frustrated in that store.  I once left my cart in the middle of the isle & walked out one day... just couldn't deal with the crowds anymore.  I feel like my brain is mush.... and I have more to study tomorrow.  I hope after a good nite's sleep, I can focus more & let it soak into my feeble brain.  I was gonna go see Spidey 2 tomorrow.. no way... I just can't do it.

      Tonite is my 1st midterm.  I'm scared crapless, but I guess I'll get thru it.  HOPEFULLY!  It's on Introduction to Internet.  My 2nd midterm will be on Monday - Government I.  I will study all weekend for that one.  I had the bug man over last nite.  I had to get rid of the Army Invasion of Ants threatening to take over my entire house.  Of course, right at the moment that he showed up, there was a complete deluge of rain again.  I swear, it just never works out for me the way I want it to.  Well, he sprayed the inside of my house extensively.  Needless to say, I'm high as a kite today from the fumes that crap puts out.  I woke up with a slight headache.  I'm hoping the smell will be gone by the time I get home tonite.  He said it should last for about 24 hours.  Great.... I hope my little animals don't die between now & then.  I'm just glad to not be home... I was really getting loopy last nite.  Hopefully no more bugs!  (yeah, right)  I live near a creek.... it's really a wonder that I don't have more bugs than what I do.  Ok... have a good day!  Wish me luck...

      I'm reading People magazine tonite.  I thought I'd take a break from studying since I found out I don't have any homework except to take 2 midterms... so I'm flipping thru pages of fame, hollywood & smut........  Then I turn the page & see ..........  the most touching article on People magazine to date.  I have been bawling since I read it.  It's about a soldier from Fort Hood who is stationed in Iraq & who has been documenting his time there in a blog.  People took excerpts from his blog & wrote this incredible article on him.  Stories like his make me want to become the biggest philanthropist & humanitarian on earth.  I want to donate my entire time, money, life to these brave men & women.  I am forever grateful for the job they do & want to become a One Woman USO Tour or something.  I want to make care packages from now until every single military member comes home.  I want to hug every single one of them... I want to salute them... I want to tell them that they are so loved.  And respected.  And honored.  I'm a train wreck now.... All I can see is that soldier's face... and read his words...  Please God, bring him home.... and the rest of his unit....

      Too bad I'm studying...  but guess what?  I wrote my very 1st ever college paper!  WOOHOO!  I spent 4 hours this morning working on it and I think it looks pretty good so far.  I just have some tweaking to do with the bibliography.  I've been inside all day - I think I'll take my box turtle for a walk outside.  I need some air.  Midterms are next week & I really want to do well in them.  I feel like that's all I'm doing - studying!  Hopefully tomorrow I can do something fun with my friends... it would stink to be indoors all weekend!  I do need to go to Wally World tonite... hmmmmmm.... and I need to hit up HEB (cheaper than buying groceries at Wally World).  So that may be my evening.

      I know, you're looking at the calendar & thinking... hmmm, she's lost her mind.  It's Thursday.  Well, technically, today is my Friday.  I am taking tomorrow off, although it won't be much of a vacation for me.  Lots & lots of school work.  I am soooo friggin overwhelmed with all that is required.  I swear, I'm gonna need bifocals by the time I get my degree from all the reading I have done.  Homework, homework, homework!  SUCKS!  lol...  Well, midterms are next week.  I hope I do well.  I saw So Damn Insane on tv tonite.  What a jackass.  Sorry if I've offended anyone.  I just think we shouldn't be there... bottom line.  I have said it before & excuse me while I stand on my soap box... but we have so many issues here at home that we could be using all that money for.  We have placed a $25M (I think) bounty on the head of Zarqawi... why?????  Why don't we spend $25M on cancer research, or stem cell research... or modernizing our schools?  Grrrrrr.... I am a very proud veteran & I do support our troops... HOWEVER.  There is a time & a limit to our generosity.  End of story!

      Wow... what an emotional week for me so far!  It will only get better, at least I hope so.  Today is Friday the 13th... I'm soooo superstitious!  lol... But I'll be ok.  I had both of my finals in the last 2 days.  I got a 98 on one exam & a 97 on the other.  I couldn't believe it!  I really haven't done Jack Crap since midterms so I knew I had some cramming to do.  It's amazing how much stuff you can cram in your head in 2 days!  Ironic thing is I have no idea what I learned... lol... oh well, it's over!  I have no homework!!!!!!!!!!  I am BESIDES MYSELF!  I may read my People magazine at lunch.  Why?  BECAUSE I CAN!  So the Olympics are gonna be in Greece this year.  I am soooo proud & feel so much honor that they are back where they started from.  I watch every news segment I can just to feel that goose-bumpy feeling.  This morning, I was listening to the news on the radio - I almost started crying, I was so emotional!  It was such a good feeling...  I just can't wait!  I plan on recording most of it, if I can.  I think this is history right here... and I am missing my homeland.  I have a feeling that I may be visiting Greece in my not-to-far future.  I may be a tour guide.... lol... I know, I know... more secrecy... Soon!  I promise!  Anyway, many hugs! Ciao~ M

      I may burst before this coming up weekend... I have such a wonderful story to share.... it may be one of the best stories ever told...  The Olympics are starting Friday nite.  I will be recording anything & everything I can get my hands on!  This is my homeland!!!!  My cousin in Greece is gonna be able to go to see them.  Some of the venues are there in my hometown - 5 hours from Athens & he will go see some of the soccer matches.  How cool is that?!  I asked my Aunt to make sure he buys me something from the Olympics...  I hope they will be good events without any incidents.

      It's Sunday, I've mowed my lawn, I have 2 midterms coming up to study for... yet I feel like I'm on top of the world!  I know what you may be thinking... has the girl really just lost her ever-lovin mind?  I feel like I could conquer anything that comes at me, including those 2 finals this week.  I promise, this next weekend, I will share all... but right now, I want it to be my little surprise... and I want to be greedy & keep it all to myself.  Ciao~ me

      Sometimes I wonder why, when things go so well for a short amount of time, the rug gets yanked from under me.  Did I piss someone off somewhere along the way?  Did I hurt someone while I was trying to have a good time?  Why can't I be one of those people that rarely has challenges in their lives that make them question what happened?!  I'm trying to stay optimistic... I'll be fine... I know I will be.  I guess it could always be worse... but damn, for once, I'd like to be happy for more than a few weeks at a time!  The future will take care of itself... I'm fully aware of it... but I just hope I can withstand the next few days til I can figure out this crapola!

      I have to blog about 3 things I've learned about this Introduction to Internet class I'm taking.  I learned how the internet took shape - Sorry Al Gore, you did NOT create the INTERNET!  I learned how to create my own website which has been... well, trying at best, fun sometimes.  I learned how to create a blog.  Before I started this class, I had no idea what the word even meant, let alone what it does & what I can do with it.  So, there you go... my life as The Internet Queen!  I rule!
