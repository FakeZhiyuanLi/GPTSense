      The teacher that I mentioned in the section about my friends is a weird story. In grade 3 we had to read silently at the beginning of every day, while listening to Backstreet Boys in the background. I think whenever that wasn`t playing she was singing "kay sara sara". On a daily basis she would klonk us on the head with a book if we ever said something stupid or did anything to annoy her. She also yelled, the whole 2nd floor and part of downstairs could hear her.   Sandy (the teacher) flipped out on me one day, it was scary, I was only like 8 then. So I ran out screaming after, my mommy wanted to know what was wrong. I told her and she had a said she wanted to schedule an appointment for later. My mommy found out that I hadn`t done a lick of homework the first term, and that I had a test to see if I was functioning properly. My result came back saying I had the intelligence level of a grade 5. Still it was just hell after that, I stayed up every night until I went to bed doing nothing but homework. This teacher was a friggin drill sergeant.  Before the appointment my mommy was aware of all the things the teacher did to me and the other kids. So she decided to take a recorder that could fit in her pocket. Sandy spilled her guts for about an hour, boy was she surprised when my mom pulled out the recorder and shut it off. It was made so if we had any more problems with her she could be fired or held back from teaching. That year I got all straight A`s, Sandy acted proud that I was in her class at the awards assembly. She had no faith in me before, the hypocrite, even worse she said she helped me. She did not what-so-ever! So that`s how it went, and the next year was smooth in her class.

      It seems like all my friends are leaving me here. Crimson`s in Vancouver doing what I don`t know, I don`t think she does either. Maya`s in Japan attending school, doesn`t 6 days a week sound enough to you? Meanwhile Leah`s scheduled to move in August. No body loves me no more... I only have MSN now to talk to people.  Speaking of the devlin (my phrase), people are so bored this summer that they must all try and send me the Netsky virus through my e-mail. They try to send it as a binary attachment, and the letters are all messed. They`re stupid if they think I`m gonna open it, the dumbapples.

      Here`s a breif description of the three prime people in my life.  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Name:Crimson Katsuya Age:13 Zodiac:Scorpio  Colours:Crimson (duh!) and black  Bishounen:Joey(Yu-Gi-Oh), Max(Beyblade) & Sesshoumaru(Inuyasha)  She acts the complete opposite of a scorpio, she`s very outgoing and friendly. When we`re together we`re like the two stupidest people on earth. She`s quite clueless about certain things. She  enjoys scaring boys with her ultra-huge binder full of Joey and Kaiba pictures. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Name:Leah Age:14 Zodiac:Libra Colour:Purple Bishounen:Yami(he`s long dead now) and Jin(Beyblade)  She`s the oldest in our group, she fits the description of a libra. She worries about me, sometimes I act immature, but at least I can make her laugh. I`ve known her since grade 2, I remember that I was only there for June of the last year. We`re kind of like sisters even though we`re different skin tones. She loves dancing, reading, writing, and making up stories on the spot. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Name:Maya Age:13 Zodiac:Saggitarius Colour:Blue  Bishounen:She has none, unless she didn`t tell me...  Me and Maya first met in Math class, hosted by the wicked witch of the west. (I have a story to tell about her later). It was 1998 when Pokemon first came out, I was in grade 3. We both liked the show, I wondered how she knew so much since it just came out. She told me that she used to watch it in Japan. She`s a real saggitarius, that`s for sure, she`s always bright, cheery and optimistic. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

      My name is Rose Vixen, but sometimes I`m referred to as Rosie-Chan! I needed a place to tell others who I am and to display some of my fanlistings. I thought it would be interesting to record my adventures in high cchool, grade nine through to the point I graduate. I`ll get to laugh at myself later in life.  If you really want to know more about me go to my profile. For some visual information, I have long chesnut brown hair, and my bangs are parted to the right. In summer my eyes turn ice blue, which everyone bugs me about. If you happen to see anything in my profile that we have in common feel free to e-mail me.
