      It is 4:00 in the morning and I am still working ... I was a little bit disappointed by the ending of Prince of Persia - Sands of Time.  The worst thing that could happen to you is the gal who accompanied you through all the zombie crap finally forgetting who you are ... tch tch tch ... you can't just leave her like that ...

      I have started saving up chat logs with ppl, now this motivates me to chat more which is not very good, but still has its own advantages.  I will probably go through these chat logs after 5 years and laugh at stuff :)

      I have always wanted to develop some real cool application in java. And as the saying goes 'Necessity is the mother of invention'. I finally have found a little tool that I am going to write in Java. This might actually end up being a very handy tool for researchers.

      Writing is&nbsp;a good habit. And I have cultivated a faint desire for a long time&nbsp;to write a full length novel. I like the idea of writing a novel. My inherent interest lies in science fiction.&nbsp; So, the decision is made to write a Sci-Fi novel.&nbsp; My roommate listens to the plot and thinks it should be based more on scientific theories than on fictitious and wonderous ideas that I have.&nbsp; No wonder he is going to be a good scientist, he likes publishing in scientific journals. I am writing an entertaining novel, and not proving any theories. The idea of basing the wonders of my novel-world to scientific theories sounds preposterous and is rejected. &nbsp; So, blabberings aside, 'What's the plot?' - you might ask ... so I will start outlining the plot in my subsequent posts. Here are the few things that I need to do before I can start working on the actual plot. &nbsp; Character bibles Location description -->&nbsp;I have positions&nbsp;for artists to give life to all of these - any takers? Some study of neurology (for some basis to the scientific wonders) &nbsp; thats all for now, keep visiting for more updates. &nbsp; -Arnav

      I agree, gameplay is very important. Although any enhancement in graphics that add to the gameplay experience are always welcome.  I was playing Prince of Persia-Sands of Time and was very impressed by the fact that all the little intricacies of gameplay (Like the crumbling ledges) in the original Prince game have not only retained their place, but also look more awesome in their 3D rendering.   I am also looking forward to what the id guys have done to the original doom models, I am getting geared up to beat the crap out of their true 3D versions :)).   urlLink Slashdot | Videogame Graphic Advances - Not That Important?

       urlLink Programming Guide for Linux USB Device Drivers   So, I've been thinking about a very cool little usb toy that might make a millionare out of someone who starts selling it.  But first, I need a prototype. For a prototype I need to know how to program USB drivers first, then go back to a drawing board and design the hardware for the toy.   It is not easy to become a millionare (unless you decide to participate in a reality show -- Any geek/nerd dating shows around??)  -Arnav

      Text based discourse generation systems have been founded on extensive research carried out by disocurse analysts (linguists&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;psychologists). Large corpora of text have been mined for finding patterns and relationships between discourse segments. &nbsp; Now, there has not been too much work on mining video databases for finding such patterns. One of the main hindrances in undertaking such a task, is that there are no strict linguistics rules that could be applied to sequences of shots and frames.&nbsp; But movies are created from scripts, and scripts are written in natural language.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I propose a hybrid model for analysing films. The rhetorical structure of the discourse is first&nbsp;extracted from the analysis of the script.&nbsp; The script is annotated with discourse markers with the types of relations. Now, frames corresponding to these&nbsp;markers in the script&nbsp;are specifically analysed for a particular expressive element. &nbsp; Of the expressive elements in films, tempo, rythm and tone have already been studied.&nbsp; I believe this approach will yield more accurate results because by annotating the script, we are&nbsp;incorporating the writer's&nbsp;storytelling intentions explicitly in the analysis. &nbsp; ...
