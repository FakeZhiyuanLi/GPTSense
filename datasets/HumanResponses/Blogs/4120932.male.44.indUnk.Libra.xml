 When the body was first created, all the parts wanted to be boss. The brain said, "I should be boss because I control all of the body's responses and functions."
The feet said, "We should be boss since we carry the brain about and get him where he wants to go."
The hands said, "We should be the boss because we do all the work and earn all the money."
Finally, the asshole spoke up. All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the boss. So, the asshole went on strike, blocked itself up, and refused to work.
Within a short time, the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic, and the brain fevered. Eventually, they all decided that the asshole should be the boss, so the motion was passed. All the other parts did all the work while the boss just sat and passed out the shit!
  Moral of the story: You don't need brains to be a boss -- any asshole will do.

						    Tommy Shaughnessy went into the confessional box and said, "Bless me Father, for I have sinned. I have been with a loose woman."
The priest said, "Is that you, little Tommy Shaughnessy?"
"Yes Father, it is."
"Who was this woman you were with?"
"I cannot tell you, Father, because I don't want to ruin her reputation."
"Who was this woman you were with?"
"I cannot tell you, Father, because I don't want to ruin her reputation."
The priest asked, "Was it Brenda Patty O'Malley?"
"No."
"Was it Mary Patricia Kelly?"
"No."
"Was it Elizabeth Mary Shannon?"
"No."
"Was it Fiona Mary McDonald?"
"No."
"Was it Cathy Moran Morgan?"
"No, Father! I cannot tell you."
The priest finally gave up and said, "Tommy, I admire your perseverance, but you must atone for your sins. Your penance will be three Hail Marys and four Our Fathers. Go back to your pew."
Tommy walked back to his pew. His friend, Sean, slid over and whispered, "What happened?"
"Well, I got three Hail Marys, four Our Fathers, and five good leads."

						     POPULATION  (everything is year 2000 information) 
There were an estimated 850,000 inhabitants in Chihuahua City in 1999.
Approximately 459,000 people (54%) are the economically active population.
The state of Chihuahua has 3 million people and 55% of the population is under 21 years of age.........
 STATE DESCRIPTION 
Chihuahua borders the US states of Texas and New Mexico to the north, Durango and Coahuila to the east, Sinaloa to the south and Sonora to the west.
It is the largest state in Mexico representing 12.56% of the country’s territory and covering a total area of 95,400 Sq. miles, an area comparable to Arizona in the US or to France in Europe.
Elevations range from 2,625 to 9,843 feet above sea level.
Chihuahua City is located at 4,806 feet above sea level.
Annual average temperature is 64’ Fahrenheit with an annual precipitation of 14.4 inches.
The coldest month is January with an average temperature of (47’ Fahrenheit)
The hottest month is June with an average temperature of (78’ Fahrenheit) ..... LOCATION. Chihuahua City, the state capital, is located at the geographic center of the state, 231 miles south of El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez.
Access to Chihuahua City from the US border is through a 4-lane highway with an average driving time of 3.5 hours....... DEMOGRAPHIC IMPACT  .The labor force in Chihuahua City is considered very stable in comparison with other locations along the border. The City is still a hub for north and south bound trade with a growing population in search of higher paying jobs. Chihuahua has been an alternate destination for maquila operators who require access to the border crossing at El Paso/Juarez but who wish to distance themselves from the border.

Training programs in the schools are flexible to the needs of industry resulting in a high quality labor force.........
 WORKER SKILL LEVEL 
Approximately 26% of the total number of maquila workers in Mexico are in the state of Chihuahua.
The most credible proof of the quality of the workforce is the type of industry established in the city. The principal maquila plants in Chihuahua employ personnel in the following industries:
Wire Harnesses 37%Electronic Components 22%Automotive Parts 18%Electric Appliances & Parts 9%Apparel/Textile 6%Injection Molding 3%Other 5% ...... EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS :
The state of Chihuahua has 8 Universities and more than 28 technical education centers.
There are 7 technical schools in the City of Chihuahua offering associate degrees in programming, accounting, electricity, welding, electronics, machine tooling, instrumentation, and other disciplines relevant to the maquila industry.
Training programs sponsored by the State of Chihuahua cover a worker’s salary (minimum wage) while in training for a period of 60 days. ....... 
 
   INFRASTRUCTURE
 An exceptional highway to the northern border crossing in Ciudad. Juarez.
An international airport with daily non-stop flights to Dallas, Houston, El Paso, Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey.
Public and private industrial parks with all services necessary for manufacturing including water, electricity, natural gas and fiber optic telephone services.
Daily rail service to Juarez/El Paso, Mexico City, and Los Mochis, Sinaloa.
26 inter-city and 6 intra-city bus lines.
31 hospitals an clinics.
Two golf courses, bilingual high schools, 7 five-star hotels.
13 Mexican and international banks including; Banamex, Bancomer, City Bank, Santander Mexicano and BBV......

 SERVICE AND SUPPORT COMPANIES:. Chihuahua’s smaller size and interior location also means fewer services and support capabilities than those found in border cities like Cd. Juarez and Tijuana. That is one of the tradeoffs companies make in search for a more stable labor force. Ford Motor Company developed its supplier base when they established their large engine plant in Chihuahua City. Diminished access to services and a further distance to the US can significantly increase costs for a highly specialized operation. ........ OTHER BIG NAMES..  More than 200 "Fortune 500" companies are established in the State with over 100 of them in Chihuahua City alone........

 ADVANTAGES
 Proximity to the US border
Immediate access to U.S. transportation &amp; distribution services
A good educational system
Excellent business climate
A more stable labor force compared to border cities
A growing manufacturing base that attracts suppliers and other support companies
Lower crime rates than in Ciudad Juarez ......... DISADVANTAGES..
 Distance from the ports of entry may increase transportation costs
Lower overall skill level of labor force than that found in Cd. Juarez
Limited extended supplier network due to geographical location
Water supply may be an issue in the future
Chihuahua is ideal for expansion or a new manufacturing operation. The city is not new to the maquila industry and it can support large-scale manufacturing. It offers a substantially better quality of life to both workers and executives than any border city. The state government is keenly aware of the importance of the maquila industry to generate jobs and bring foreign investment.

						    A visitor from Albuquerque NM experience  ..............
  
 Visiting Chihuahua City is one of the best things I've done this summer. In exchange for a four to five hour bus ride in the comfortable Omnibus system of Mexico, where we got to see "Gladiator" for free, I got a weekend full of beautiful sites and culture. What made it even better is that I had a great travel partner.
On the spur of the moment my friend and I planned our weekend adventure, and it turned out to be easier than we thought. With the help of the internet, we booked a $40.00 hotel room in Downtown Chihuahua's Days Inn. There are many hotels to choose from in the downtown area, but if you're on a budget like we were, the Days Inn of Chihuahua with two double beds is great.
Getting to Chihuahua is also an easy process. We discovered that buses depart from the Juarez central bus depot for Chihuahua City every hour on the hour until 9pm, and vice versa. A word of advice, if you're planning to visit Chihuahua for the weekend, pack lightly. We backpacked the city with all of our resources on our backs.
Once in Chihuahua, we let our curiosity navigate our outing. Downtown Chihuahua rests on a hill, and because our hotel was at the bottom of the hill, we decided to work our way up, but for about a $2.50 cab ride to the top, you can work your way down and avoid tired legs.
Chihuahua City has a very romantic feel to it, with its narrow streets and its beautiful French and Spanish influenced architecture, I found myself in awe of my surroundings. Walking the city is the only way to take in all of the elaborate, but sometimes subtle details of downtown.
I was especially impressed with the "Quinta Gameros" Regional Art Museum. I later learned that it is considered to be the best structural example of the "Art Nuveau" style in the Mexican Republic and perhaps America. Aside from its breathtaking site, the museum is home to some of the best art to emerge from Chihuahua City and the Mexican Republic.
Another "must see" while in Chihuahua is its cathedral. Taking over a century to build, Chihuahua's cathedral is an architectural gem with elaborate works of sacred art throughout. We also visited Pancho Villa's home, where his wife Luz Corral lived until she passed away in 1981.
Chihuahua's nightlife has something for everyone. We were interested in seeing local live music and ended up catching a ska show from Chihuahua's local band, "Rice and Beans." Ska music is an energetic reggae influenced form of dance music that's popular throughout Mexico. Never have I seen a crowd as entertained and "into" the music as I experienced here. People were dancing on bars, chairs, and tables throughout the "Club Grail." Needless to say, we had a great time.
Chihuahua is a city rich in history and culture, and for the same amount of time it takes to go north to Albuquerque, one can learn more about the Mexican region south of us.

						    Chihuahua City, the state capital is noted for its charming colonial architecture which today is woven between the modern industrial influences of a major city progressing with forethought. Founded October 12, 1709, it was elevated to the status of town in 1718 with the name San Felipe del Real de Chihuahua. In 1823 it became a city. Chihuahua City is about 900 miles from Mexico City and 235 miles south of Cd. Juarez on the US border.The name of both the city and the state comes from an Aztec word that means dry and sandy, but a visitor would find it hard to call that an apt description. The weather is complete with the contrasts of rainy seasons and warm summer days and these conspire to produce ample trees and plants that add a greenness to the sandy desert environment, providing a very attractive natural ambience for the visitor.

						     Shades of Juárez    The Search for the Missing Women of Chihuahua-----------
Sitting together on a small couch in their modest Chihuahua City home, Francisco Torres and his wife Martina Albeldaño are visibly proud that their 17-year-old daughter is a middle school graduate. But like many other young working class women and men in Mexico, Minerva Torres decided not to go on to high school and opted for the work world instead.
After stints in maquiladoras and at other odd jobs, Minerva informed her mother early on the morning of March 13 that she was catching a bus to go downtown for a new job interview. It was the last time the Torres family saw Minerva.
"We feel very depressed at times. It gets worse everyday because we don't know her whereabouts, what happened to her," says Albeldaño. "We don't know if she's alive, or whose hands she might be in." Soon the parents discovered that they were not alone in their suffering. Noticing flyers posted around town that begged for help in locating other missing young women, the couple got in touch with the families of the others. To date, local media reports and posters issued by the Chihuahua State Attorney General's office (PGJE) indicate that at least nine young women and teenagers between 13 and 20 years of age have vanished from Chihuahua City since last December. However, a source with the PGJE will only confirm four of the disappearances.
Four of the women disappeared in one three-week period during the months of February and March, and at least three of the missing were last reported seen at separate times in the same general area of downtown Chihuahua City, a congested zone filled with bus, automobile and pedestrian traffic. They seemingly dropped off the face of the earth in broad daylight.
Besides Minerva Torres, the young women reported as missing include Ericka Carrillo Enríquez, Jazmin Islas Gutíerrez, Miriam Cristina Gallegos Venegas, Rosalba Pizarro Ortega, Yesenia Guadalupe Vega Herrera, and Julieta Marlene González Valenzuela. Missing posters of Torres, Pizarro and González, issued by the PGJE, are displayed in the main Chihuahua City bus station.
Another Ciudad Juárez?
The Chihuahua City disappearances have mobilized women's rights activists and raised fears that the now internationally notorious crimes that have struck terror in the heart of the border city of Ciudad Juárez to the north are being repeated in the capital city of Mexico's geographically largest state.
Both the age group and manner of disappearance of the Chihuahua women coincide with those of many of the women who have been killed or disappeared in Juárez during recent years.
Likewise, many of the women in both Juárez and Chihuahua worked in maquiladora plants or other low-wage jobs. Since 1993, more than 300 women in Juárez have been reported murdered or disappeared. In June, a woman was found strangled outside a maquiladora plant in Juárez. A few weeks later, The daily El Heraldo de Chihuahua newspaper reported that a man was arrested after being caught while attempting to rape a maquiladora worker right after the victim left the factory where she worked in Chihuahua City.
Blame for the carnage has been laid alternately at the door of serial killers, porno snuff rings, drug gangs, satanic cults, and everyday misogynists. A growing number of observers is calling the phenomenon femicide.
They note another chilling trend: Some of the recent disappearances or killings in Juárez and Chihuahua were committed on or right before holidays with sentimental meaning, such as Valentine's Day and Mothers Day. In one such incident, the body of a sexually victimized and pregnant young woman was dumped close to the home of Juárez Mayor Gustavo Elizondo.
A report issued last month by three Mexican non-governmental groups -- the Mexico City-based Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights; Choose, Youth Network for Sexual and Reproductive Rights; and Epikea, Justice with Equality -- calculated that at least 108 of the murdered women were victims of sexual attacks, typically suffering torture and rape before being killed.
Because dozens of unidentified bodies were found too late to determine the precise manner of death, the number of killings that fit this pattern could be far higher. Given the high number of disappearances, it's also widely suspected that an undetermined number of bodies have yet to be recovered.
"We want an environment in which all of us can live in harmony and security," says Isabel Saldivar of the non-governmental, Chihuahua City-based Commission in Solidarity and Defense of Human Rights (Cosyddhac). "These disappearances are really grave. All the stops must be pulled out so this sort of thing doesn't happen again," she says. "We want preventive actions by the state. On the one hand, [we want] preventive actions that eradicate this kind of occurrence, on the other hand, punitive actions that eliminate impunity in these cases."
Polemics
As in the Juárez drama, controversies quickly erupted over the conduct of PGJE personnel in the Chihuahua City investigations. Declaring that leads existed as to the whereabouts of some of the missing women, PGJE agents ferried victims' relatives on several trips last May to red light districts in the cities of Juárez and Casas Grandes, both in Chihuahua state, and in Monterrey, hundreds of miles away in Nuevo Leon state.
However, searches in strip bars and table dance joints produced none of the missing women. The suggestion that her daughter might be working in a sex industry venue shocked Albeldaño. "One didn't imagine there were places like this," she says. Minerva Torres, adds Albeldaño, is a follower of the Mormon faith, an ardent churchgoer, and an individual who eschews wild lifestyles.
One line of investigation reportedly pursued by the PGJE centered on the theory that the young women might have been convinced to abandon their homes to follow religious sects, including the Mormons.
Minerva's father contends that police are barking up the wrong tree. "If they think that way, they're never going to find them," Torres fumes. "They have to look for the criminals who have them. I'm sure that someone has them out there, but they haven't communicated with us."
One possibility, speculates Torres, is that the women were kidnapped for the white slave trade and forced into prostitution somewhere. In Minerva's case, her family has received no phone calls demanding ransom.
On Mother's Day, May 10, Torres joined protesters from Juárez in a demonstration outside the offices of Chihuahua Gov. Patricio Martínez that demanded the return of missing loved ones.
According to Alma Gómez, a Chihuahua state deputy for the Democratic Revolution Party, police inexplicably detained the Juárez contingent at a government highway checkpoint before allowing constituents to proceed to the Chihuahua City protest. Once outside Martínez' office, the protesters were met by a counter-demonstration organized by a women's group from Martinez' Institutional Revolutionary Party. The latter were quoted in the media as stating that they did not want the latest disappearances to be politicized.
The U.N. Comes to Town Again
Even as the Chihuahua City cases came to public light, renewed controversy broke out in Juárez around the scope and direction of state investigations into that city's long record of murder and disappearance. Prompting the new round of polemics was the May visit to Juárez and Chihuahua City of Dato Param Cumaraswamy, a UN special monitor for judicial and legal independence. He was the second UN special monitor to hear first-hand about the Juárez cases in as many years.
While in Mexico, Cumaraswamy met with non-governmental organizations, Chihuahua State Attorney General Arturo González and the state's Special Prosecutor for Women's Homicides, Suly Ponce. Before departing the country, Cumaraswamy commented at a news conference that he was leaving with enough documentation on irregularities in the legal system "to fill a suitcase." He's expected to make a report sometime this year.
Meanwhile, border violence against women once again is being used in the triennial ritual of political parties competing for power. The violence has garnered various mentions in the platforms and statements of the contenders in the upcoming July municipal elections in Chihuahua state.
Although the killing of border women has been a political issue in the state for years, the number of bodies and disappearances continues to mount. The most recently reported victim in Juárez was a strangled woman whose body was found outside a maquiladora on June 12. Hers was the twelfth death this year to fit the pattern of the ongoing unsolved murders there, according to the Diario de Juárez newspaper.
Looking for a Local Remedy
Elvira Villareal of the March 8 Feminist Group, a Chihuahua state non-governmental organization, considers the UN monitors' visits a positive step. Yet, while welcoming international interest, Villareal nonetheless adds that family members and their advocates seek local solutions to their sorrows, such as better police work and tougher punishment.
"They want justice in their own country; they want to exhaust all the legal remedies in their own country," says Villareal. Cosyddhac representative Guadalupe Montoya contends that Chihuahua state needs to pass stronger laws to punish perpetrators of forced disappearance.
Map of Chihuahua Area Although kidnapping is certainly a crime, Montoya explains, some police agents are reluctant to investigate unexplained disappearances, especially if no ransom note is found. This forces family members to launch their own searches.
In addition to the psychological and emotional toll exacted by forced disappearance, Montoya says, economic costs could prove devastating to low-income family members who face the impossible choice between keeping their jobs or leaving them to search for their relatives.
"The family members of disappeared persons in our state are completely defenseless," she says. "This is a red alert in Chihuahua. Besides the disappearances of women, men have also disappeared," she adds. "This puts us on notice to look for alternatives, like passing a law so people don't have to keep organizing in their own defense."
Part of the problem in getting new, pro-woman legislation approved, affirms Villareal, is that politics in Chihuahua and Mexico are still dominated by men. While a 1997 amendment to the Chihuahua state constitution stipulates that no gender group should have more than 70 percent of the seats in the state congress, a legislative head-count shows the failure of good intentions. In 2001, only five women sit in the 33-member Chihuahua state congress, according to Villareal.
Says the activist, "Government has been amiss in attending to the families of disappeared women. It's a gender problem. The victims are women. Apart from this, they're poor. It's also a class question."
Meanwhile, Francisco Torres and Martina Albeldaño wonder when they will hear news about their missing daughter, whose 18th birthday fell on July 25. Despite some leads, Albeldaño laments that, mysteriously, "Nobody knows anything." A rumor that some of the missing young women might be in the El Paso area was not confirmed by the El Paso Police Department, whose spokesman did not return phone calls .
