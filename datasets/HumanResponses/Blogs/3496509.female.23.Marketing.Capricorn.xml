      Working life is so damn boring. I really regret that I didn't enjoyed my life back while I was studying. I regret that I want to enter to the working life so soon. When i realise so much I have miss out, there is no turning back co's this is my life and I must stick to it. The pressure that is being face now is count by every single drop of sweat and pressure. Why want to work so hard just to have a stable life and future? I guess the advantages of being a woman is...we can rely on man.

       urlLink    I spent my whole Saturday with Jason. We watched GT in Sepang and both of us dont even know anything about GT. We know each other better and we are getting a level closer. After GT, we have our dinner and followed by a movie at Sunway. We took numerous photos together. When I look through the photos that we took together, it seems as if we were really close together. I am uncertain how he feels toward me or is he treating me as a close friend and nothing more than that.

      I met Kelvin in friendster and I never add him in my friendster’s list as I don’t even know him. We exchange messages but sometime out of no reason I will receive weird reply from him. He went over to France for training and we stopped exchanging messages. The last messages that he sent me was actually asking for my contact number.  He send me sms when he was back in Brunei, he also give me a call. I was actually quite shocked co’s I never expected at all. Our conversation was okay but all of a sudden he just letting me know that he is actually looking for a girlfriend and I suite to his requirement. He called me again a second times and our conversation lasted for about 5 mins.  Last night, we chat in msn and after that he called me up again. This time, we chatted over the phone for about 1 hour. He asked me a lot of questions and he is hoping that we could get to know each other better and if opportunity is there then we could further on. He is 4 years older than me and he just told me that he is looking for someone who could be his wife. To me, I think it is good to have someone inside my mind and heart even though we are not together co’s it could actually keep me for being single.  I fear that it won’t last co’s I have a bad experience with Willoong. I am indeed attracted to his talent and I really hope that we could further on. Things just change once he was tied up with his dream and passion. Nevertheless, I am happy that I have met him co’s he shower me with all the attention and open up my heart to show me what is Love. Maybe because of his young age, he is not stable yet.  As for Kelvin, it is still too far away. He told me that I could trust him and he won’t do anything bad behind my back. Maybe after a few weeks, we will have a better picture as in how’s our situation going to be. Really looking forward for tonight co’s we will be chatting together online.

      I spent my Sunday with Irene. Oh gosh, I really can’t believe it myself that I am so useless. I can’t even shop. My legs become so tired and I would just sit there and prefer eating. How could it be that I can’t shop anymore. It seems like everything that I am interested in is actually so damn expensive.

      Last night, I represent my company to a close event in Zouk organise by Microsoft. I never been to a club alone before. I guess that I am very tension that very day as I am not only worry how am I going to survive but I have been busy the whole day. I arrived there early, I just sat there alone and order my free beer while lighting my cigarrette. Then a guy approached me and it so happened that I met him before in another Microsoft event in Hyatt Saujana.  He introduced other people to me and stay beside me when I am standing there alone. A thought just struck my mind when the guy is getting too close to me. He is practically standing really close to me, placing his arm around my waist. What image that I potray which resulted that he place his arm around my waist? He didn't acted that way infront of his female colleagues. They invited me to join them in Beach club but I am waiting for my friend to pick me up as I am half drunk. After being persue by them and I really feel inappropriate to push them away hence I followed them after my friend told me that he will be able to join me. We go to barfly instead. There the guy invite me to dance with him, holding my hands and waist. I only know that when people look at me, they thought that I am the kind of person that always go clubbling but the fact is, I am not. This is not the first time that a guy is trying to get too close with me when I was drunk. I am okay with friend whom I know getting close with me while I was drunk co's he is actually protecting me and taking care of me.  When I was a teenager, the image that I potray is shy, cute and quiet. I am the daddy little girl that stay at home and being restricted by my parents. I am also the so call "good girl" image infront of everyone. Hence, I change my image. I start off with piercing my ear as I want to move away from the image. Then, while I was in Australia studying...I pierce my naval and one month after that, I had my first tattoo. Now, I can't change my image back as I am now a blur, curious and crazy kind of person. I smoke and I drink....

      Why am I so sleepy? Everyday when I was alone sitting in one corner, I will just hide behind my monitor and fall asleep for few minutes until my phone rang or when someone come over and ask me a questions. No matter how early I sleep, I will end up taking a short nap when no one notices me. Is working too boring for me? Or is it I am the kind of person that is not suitable to have a normal working hour job? Can I get the hang out of it or am I just not motivated enough? Or is there something wrong with my health or am not resting while I was sleeping?

       urlLink    I hang out with my colleagues at Halo Cafe in Subang after 2nd weeks of working in the new company. It is the first time I hang out with them. I find the people there really friendly and I really felt that I am lucky to have such a good colleagues. Things changes once I notice that many of my colleagues decided to resign. The guy in the pic is called Jason and our name is very similar. His name is "Chai Chien" and my name is "Chia Chien". We started hanging out with each other very often since last month. He will just called me up and asked me out co's he said that I am one of those people that he likes to hang out with co's I seldom talk about work. Thing started to change once we hang out more co's I kind of grow a mutual feeling toward him. I tend to be more serious about the words he said. I tried to hide my feeling, I tried to talk nonsense to him, I tried to act like crazy in front of him...but i know there is something deep inside me which I can't hide. It has been a while since I last have any feeling for any guy co's most of the time, will be the guy who confess to me and I just make the decision. This time is different. I just hope that this will be just a feeling that I have which will fade away as days passes by.

      If I am given a choice what do I want to change, I really hope that I could be a Man. The only reason why I say so, is because, being a Man...you won't have period pain. Apart from that, I feel that it is much more convenient. Though they are advantages being a Woman since Woman is the weaker species. Why, a woman have to go through the cycle of having period pain? To me, it felt like "running water" and I lost my appetite for few days. Before the period, I will suffer from the symptom such as breakout and bad mood. Hai~~~life!

       urlLink    Tomorrow is my ex's b'day. After being together with him for 5 years, it has been a habit of mine to greet him without fail at 12am sharp. Every year, apart from receiving my phone call, b'day card...there will also be a gift from me. I still remember clearly that I gave him an ID bracelet with his name engrave on it last year during his 25th B'day. This year, I didn't send him any card, neither do I be sending him any gift. I really do hope that I could forget that tomorrow is his b'day. I am just so use to it to send him wishes every year that I feel awkward that this year, he won't be getting any wishes from me. It is so hard to believe that I love him so deeply before and everything between us ended just like that after being together for many years. We have been through a lots and it is so hard to believe that we can maintain 3 years long distance relationship....and till the end, after went through so much....we still break up.

      Yesterday night, siew fern, ailing, jason, yeong chan and me went down to Pontian to attend Celine's funeral. We arrive Pontian at 3.30am+ and I speak to her brother and close friend "Fu". My tears keep on rolling down my eyes and I just can't control myself and I just want to see Celine for one last time. After hearing what they told me bout Celine, it just bring tears to me co's I know Celine don't want to die so fast. I even have a deep conversation with Celine's parents, I also send my warm regards to Celine's favourite cousin.  I reach back KL at 10pm + and Jason come over to pick me up. After I reach home, I just can't sleep and I sms Jason. Jason asked me whether I want him to accompany me for a night and I agreed. Having Jason by my side has calm me down for the time being and he tried his best to distract my thought and move my direction toward him by kissing me. I didt have few hous sleep but as for Jason, he didn't sleep. He also tell me that he didn't sleep well while I was in Johor co's he is really worry bout me.  He know that I am sad, he know that there is nothing much he can do but by seeing me like that, it also hurt him.

       urlLink    Why a day of a birth can be also a day of mourning? Just three days ago, I receive a sms from Celine telling me how much she miss me and how much she miss Adelaide and just in Monday morning, I received news that she is involved in a car accident and she has passed away.  Though I hate her but I have also learned to forgive her and I am grateful to have her as my friend. I am also grateful that I am one of the first person in her mind when she has a problem. I am grateful that she treats me as someone special in her life. The last time that I shared with her will now be a memory to me. The story and long conversation that we share is now deep in my heart.  Her voice, her smile, the way she call my name, the way when she make fun of me, the things that we share together, the picture that we took together, the tattoo on my body, the naval piercing that I have, the moment when we were being robbed, the time when we spent drinking, the time when we smoke together outside at our house just bring tears to me. The problem that her face, the things that she has shared with meI know it clearly that all this thing is not what she want. I also know that she will feel that she has so many things that she want to do, so many thing that she want to settle and she cant.  I know this is life, no one want this to happen but I just cant accept the fact that she left me. Just the thought of her bring tears to me, just a thought of her bring a sorrow smile in my face. What is in her mind when she was involved in the accident? What is in her mind when she was in pain and die on the way to the hospital? Many things in my life just remind me of her, the photos that we took together, and the moment that we share together. I miss her so much, I am happy that I have told her everything that she needs to know about me. I am happy that she knows that I have Jason by my side now.  Why life is so painful? There are just so many things that I want to tell her. There is so many things that I want to share with her. She will always stay in my mind; she will always stay in my heart. Celine, thanks for forgiving me for everything that I have done. Thanks for being my friend. Thanks for all the memory that you have given me. Please rest assures that you have nothing to worry about me. Please rest assure that I am always by your side, accompany you and stay beside you, take care of you when you are in trouble. I am grateful that you are happy to have me as a friend. Celine, I miss youyou are always my close friend.

       urlLink    Jason accompany me to meet Ming Yee at 1 Utama. Ming Yee told me that Jason is a nice guy. He is indeed really caring and he could suite himself in my environment, I guess it is because that Ming Yee is an out going person.  After that, Jason bring me to KL. A place where I passed by everytime but never know why is there a park in the middle of the road. He told me that it is a very nice place and there are a lots of people going there. I never expect that I will see the statue that I always saw in the tv. The statue is so nice and I am so excited that Jason bring me there. There we took few photos together. After that, we went down to Wangsa Maju to look for his sister.  Meng Onn called me and asked whether I want to join his to Redang and I need to give him an aswer by Thursday. I really want to go and I did asked Jason whether he want to go with me and straight away he told me don't. When I am home, he send his unsatisfied sms to me then I asked him what his sms mean. He didn't asked me not to go but he prefer that I go with my own friend and not going with Meng Onn's friends. He said that Meng Onn likes me and Meng Onn will do everything to have my attention.

      I spend time with Jason after work. We have dinner together. During our conversation, he mentioned to me that his ex gf is very pretty and that really make me jealous. I kept quiet but he is telling me that my beauty has melted his heart. &nbsp; We went to the park nearby office. Hang out around there for a while. He keep on starring at me, hugging me tightly. We went to a night spot and there he kissed me for a very long time. He told me that he love me.&nbsp;He really touches me and I really felt like crying. &nbsp; While we was inside the car. He keep on starring at me and talking to me but all of a sudden, he kept quiet. I could sense something really wrong. I sense that he is starting to cry and that really make my heart feel so sorrow. All of a sudden, my tears just roll down none stop. He hug me tightly and I told him that I like him. &nbsp; He asked me why I cry and I told him that I just can't believe that someone will actually love me so deeply co's&nbsp;I ain't good enough for anyone. He told me that he is real and he really likes me. I am truly touch and he told me that whatever I do, I am so pretty and I have capture his heart. He can't understand himself why he likes me so much. He keep on telling me that he can't control himself and asking me to guide him.

       urlLink      Last night, Jason gave me a red rose. I asked him why he gave me a rose and he told me that he has no particular meaning but he has never given any rose to anyone before. I could sense that his love grow each and everyday. He is also very caring, understanding and gives me space though he is dying to be with me. He can't control himself for telling me how much he likes me and he can't control himself from not spending time with me for one day. Neither can he stop himself from kissing me. Everything about me is beautiful in his eyes. Because he never has this strong feeling before, I really fear that I will hurt him one day.   Never have I ever felt the passion in a guy and neither have i been so blessed to have someone beside me. I am the key to his heart and I am the strength to keep him going. He told m ethat he must do his best in work co's I am behind him watching over him. I am starting to fall for him but dare not tell him that I love him in words.

      It has been more than a week we have gone steady. An issue arises on Tuesday night after I have my dinner with his mom and sis. He really concern about the guys around me. He told me that there is no such thing as normal friend between male and female. He told me that a guy will treat a gal nicely and willing to be by her side even if he knows that he can’t be the one for her.  It really makes me wonder a lots but I choose to ignore to safe guard myself from getting hurt. I could sense the insecurity inside him but I also know that he is really comfortable to have me as his girlfriend. He wants me to be natural in front of his parents and treat his sister as my own sister.   The passion inside him for our relationship is very strong because he never really attaches to anyone before and he never has any intimacy with any person before. He hugs me in public area and kisses me a lot. It really reminds me of the freedom while I was in Adelaide. Kissing and hugging in public area and didn’t care what other people look at us. He don’t know how to French Kiss and he has the intention to learn more and try more.   Sometime the feeling of being with him is like a close friend. The only difference is we kiss and we hug. We push a lot just like small kid. He is mature when it comes to working and view toward relationship but just like a small kid while he is with me in person.

      I truly feel so sorry for Jason. On the first few days of going steady with him, I am so certain that he is the one that I like but after work on Saturday...after I have been observing him from behind while he was driving...it seems that I am deducting his mark one by one. All of a sudden, I asked myself...do I really like him? Can I accept the way he wear his clothing? Can I accept the way he eat? I really feel bad that I think of him that way.  After bringing Hasler back home, I went to his Wangsa Maju with him and I met his mom. I am not only nevouse but I don't know what to talk to his mom. I know that his mom keep on looking at me but when I was about to left...the feeling that his mom and sis given me is very warm. He is just like a big brother and big boy infront of his family member.  We went to Starlight Cinema at 10pm plus. He keeps on kissing me but I didn't show him any much response. Neither do i show much response when he first kiss me. He thought that I don't have much experience in kissing or I am uncomfortable to kiss him. I could sense that he is dying to kiss me and he could on mentioning everything about me that is attractive. I pulled him to a night spot, hug him and kiss him on the lip. He was indeed shock but the kiss that I gave him is a bit of French Kiss. I know that my French Kiss will turn a guy on and I don't want this to happen to Jason. He is still very fresh in a relationship, he never likes anyone so much as me before.  He hug and kept me warm while we watch LOTR. He is indeed very caring as for me, I didnt give him the care that I should have and I didnt even try hard. He is cold and he is tired but he didnt tell me and neither does he want to admit. I understand his feeling perfectly and yes, I do agree that he likes me more than I likes him. He also tell me that he will jealous and feel insecure if I go out with other guys. He is feeling really insecure being with me co's I look too innocent.   Jason is a great guy. All I could do now is treat him the best as I can and accept him for who he is.  8th July - we are not together as he need to go KL to pick up his mom and i have a three hours meeting. while we were in the office, both of us feel so insecure and only when we are left alone, he gave me a peck on my face 9th July - we also have our lunch alone and at night he go KLCC to pick me up. 10th July - Starlight Cinema, the first time i make the first move to kiss him

      Never ever I felt so blessed to have someone beside me sharing my life, protecting and guiding me through my happiness and sadness. Never ever like anyone before so deeply and feel so happy that I just want to share with everyone that I have found that special person.   I believe that he is a gift from god to me. Though he seems like a normal guy but his assurance to me is so touching that I willing to open up my heart and let him enter into my life. I am very certain that he is the one that I am seeking for after failing in relationship for a number of times. My past relationships is a guidance to me and through all those sorrow, I learn to love and precious the one that I love.   Spending time with him is all I want. Silent night but with him by my side, holding my hands is all I want. I just melt in his arm when he holds me. I know it is too early to judge anything co’s this relationship just started.   I fear that I will fall in love with him. I fear that I will love him more each and every beat of my life. I fear that I will fall in love so fast that I haven’t got to know him in detail. I really appreciate that he will arrange everything for me and accompany me for what I want to do. I also appreciate that he is looking for a serious relationship and proud that I am his girlfriend. I also appreciate that he accepts me for who I am and not wanting me to be someone I don’t want to be.   Both of us believe that word from mouth is not important. What is important is the action taken to prove to the other parties. I am really happy that he is willing to change and accommodate me in anyway he can. Shower me with sweet words through sms and writing though both of us is not good when it coming to figure of speech.   3rd July – He first hold my hand at Sunway Coffee Bean 4th July – He accompanies me to my friend’s graduation in Nikko Hotel and he gave me a peck on the cheek while we were in Mid Valley. I was touched that he accompany me whole day and bringing them around. I was touched that he want to join me and visit my friends in Sarawak. 5th July – I met him at 10pm, we went to Darusalam café for the first time as a couple and it is the first night we exchange goodbye kiss 6th July – We are having dinner at MAMA PAPA café in Subang airport and it is raining nonstop. I was touched when he proposed to join him to his hometown in September.  7th July – Our first movie as a couple in Summt USJ (Heat Team)

      Many things is running through my head. I know that I have feeling for Jason but how should I go about it? Questions popping out of my mind when I received sms from Jason that make me confuse. Does he meant what he said? Did he has any feeling for me?  After few hours Chin Foo confess to me that he is trying to court me, the only person that come to my mind is Jason. I asked him out and he agreed. We were outside Starbuck and I am asking him bout his sms and hinting him that I have feeling for him. I told him that Chin Foo is trying to woo me and he just keep quiet.  Next day, I am just so uneasy that I really want to get it out of my heart. I email Jason telling him that I treat him more than an ordinary friend and he has the first priority when asking me out. I push away all dates just to be with him. I don't mind spending whole day with him and talk nonsense.  Today, is the first day we go steady. I also never expect that he will be so direct and tell me that he likes me and asking me to be his girlfriend. I am truly touch when he told me that he never likes a person so much. though, we are same age but he is far mature than me and I am blessed that I have met him. 3rd July 2004, Sunway Pyramid's Coffee Bean is the place when he first hold my hand.  Hope this is a new begining of a beautiful relationship.
