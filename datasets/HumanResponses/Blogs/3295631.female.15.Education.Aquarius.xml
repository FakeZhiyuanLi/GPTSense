      I share  urlLink Mr. Krauthammer's  views on the WWII Memorial.  On with the show...   I live in Wick, Iowa.  I really have no fear of stalkers because you'll never _find_ Wick because, well, it's almost nonexistent.  The one thing that makes Wick "WICK" is the cemetary. Pathetic, yes, but that's what is the basis of this... Cluster.  That's what I'll call it, a cluster of houses.   We have a cemetary, a fair sized one for rural Iowa, bigger than St. Mary's (which is a bigger community than ours, they have businesses, we don't XD).  Our pride and joy.  Every Memorial Day, I hop on my bike and ride the the quarter of a mile or so to the cemetary around 9 a.m.  There are about 10 other people there, they pull up, get out of their cars, I park my bike, take off my helmet, and stand there awkwardly with the lot of them.  All the large flags are out, grass mowed, all the veteren's grave markers have little flags in them, flowers, the whole bit.  It looks magnificent.  Then the  old people  American Legion members march with their guns/flags around the little driveway, and when they finally get into position, somebody over at the truck turns on a C.D. with  urlLink taps  on it.  Ready-set-fire, ready-set-fire, ready-set-fire.  Nothin' wakes you up like the sound of gunshots in the morning O_O  Last year there was this lady who was around 50 years old, not sure if she was there like I was, to remember people I didn't know but was indebted to, or if she had a relative there.  After the gunshots went off, we just kind of stood there, and she looked at me, straight in the face (eye contact=scary for teenagers, really, it is) and said "I am really glad you came today," and handed me a bullet shell.  I still have a shell, and that's a moment I'll carry forever.   My grandfather, Mr. Cornelius Mallinger, was a medic in the Army, and was killed in a plane crash when my father was four years old.  My grandmother, Carol, remarried a widower with 7 children, totalling 10, then had four more (one, Joseph, died), brining the total of the family to 13.  She later, when I was around 8-9, divoriced that man, who is a member of the Lion's Club.  My uncle John, a member of the Air Force for >20 years, passed away when I was in fifth grade, and though I didn't really know the man, I felt a terrible loss.  Heart wrenching sorrow.  He left a wife and three children at home.  Brings tears to my eyes even today.  John's oldest son, Brian, who is 20 now, will be going to Iraq in several weeks.  Brian is a Marine and a very dear relative of mine.  Last fourth of July he, his mother, and siblings came down from Lincoln, NE to spend it with my grandmother/rest of the family.  He had great stories of training, played volleyball with all of us, hung out with my cousin Wes (who graduated this year), etc., etc.  An overall great person, and  I am very proud of him .  My uncle Chris recently finished his National Guard duty, and has a son, Jonas, who is probably one of the cutest, smartest kids you'll run across.  Chris and Brian like to swap stories, it's a very manly experience to say the least XD  My own father was a Marine, and boy does he look h0++ in his old pictures. (not really people, I'm not like that o.O)  Haha.  It's a time he'd rather forget to be honest, hash and constipation.  But ah well, we'll keep reminding him about those prime years he spent working to send money back to the other 12 ;).  My neighbor and pseudo-grandfather, Larry, who died of lung cancer (and on that note, don't smoke people, I love you too much) when I was 11, was an Army vet.  Fought in WWII, his father in the first.  He was a very loving man, worked with his hands all his life, a good, honest citizen whom I adore still today.  His wife, Joan, still lives next to us, though I haven't been able to see her in a while due to not being home :(:/  I cannot tell you how proud I am, how much I love, or how much joy I find in my family and friends.  Their sacrifices to their country are an honor and a privilage for me to remember.  Yet, I know that many people have my same story, or a  urlLink longer one even , and to think of ALL the people who gave so much for the future, for the progress and improvement of this country.  It's amazing what people are willing to sacrifice for their homes, their land, their beliefs. I know a bit what sacrifice and dedication is like with my athletic teams and such, but never for my country.  I can only hope that someday I would be able to give as those before me have, without second thoughts, without flinching.   I know words will  never  suffice.  But.  Thank you.    Tomorrow morning, nine o' clock a.m., I'll be there, bike and all.

      Well then.  I've heard many people saying the U.N. is a "corrupt organization," and I was wondering why in the world they would say that.  So I dug my heels in, and looked up some stuff on the U.N. Yay me.   The real issue is their finances.  Their budgets, apparently,  are secret .  Hm.  Corruption?  Noooo...  They also rejected an audit, hm.  Makes ya think.  Now, realize this, if the U.S. were to pull out of the U.N., it would collapse.  We give them loads of money, and without us, they'd be... well.  They're ruined.  We probably won't leave for another ten years or so, but support for the body is decreasing lately.  The Clinton admin. thought that they could take the load off of themselves and their foreign policy by giving troops to the U.N. and have them do what they would.  That worked like a charm.  Somalia ring a bell?  Right.   Back to $$. In 1945, the U.S. payed 39.98% of the U.N.'s budget. Sick. Then it dropped to 25%. Ew. Back up to 31%. What are we doing?! $10.5 billion a year! •_•  In 1992, 79 memebers were paying the minimum "membership fee." Another 9 were paying .02% of the total budget. That means the voting majority of the members all contributed less than 1% each, while 14 members carried the burden with 84%.  The word irresponsible comes to one's mind...  "The countries are poor." Granted, yes, third world country have poor peope. But the people who run those countries are not poor. Case in point. Are people in Cuba poor? Is Fidel Castro poor? Right.  Since Third World countries  took over  joined, the peacekeeping forces have gone from 1,500 to 50,000++.  The 50k number doesn't include the 10,000 "consultants," which in 1993 numbered around 80,000. Until 1994  there was no central list of employees , so yeah.  Even today there are no records of many appointments in the Secretariat.  Seriously.  Personnel eats up about 70% of the budget, and that could be higher since we don't really know  what  they're doing with all that $$.  Hm.  That leaves little-no money for the actual missions.  Somalia ring a bell?  Anybody?  Anybody at all?  The average salary for a midlevel accountant in 1995 was $84,500, non U.N. was $41,964.  U.N. computer analysts got around $111,500--while non-U.N. got around $56,836.  An assistant secretary general received $190,250 while the mayor of New York City was paid $130,000.  All salaries are free of taxes.  Here's the kicker.  They also get: monthly rent subsidies of up to $3,800 annual education grants (also tax-free) of $12,675 per child  I can't even go there.  I honestly can't.  Words...    "according to Richard Thornburgh, who once served as under secretary general, "In the Office of Conference Services where translation services are provided, we currently employ 500 secretary-stenographers who are given the responsibility of typing the dictated version of translated documents and returning them to the translators for editing and approval." Those positions, of course, could be eliminated entirely if the translators worked with word processors. The cost of that featherbedding is $20 million a year."   Hmmm word processors?!  Y'don't say :O   Many have no particular skills other than cultivating support from their sponsoring governments. Once they are inside the UN bureaucracy,  it is virtually impossible to fire them.    So, they're hiring skill-less people who they can't get rid of?!  GREAT!    Now, this is not where the squandering stops, SHOCKER!  The UN Children's Fund [maybe] lost $10 million thanks to (GET THIS!)  mismanagement  in Kenya. Now, note the maybe.  But the fact that 10 million bucks could even PERHAPS be missing is a fairly large... thing?  Am I wrong? Lost 4 million in cash, in noneother than... Somalia.  Just stolen from them. It goes on and on and on.    Y'know.  I really don't like the U.N. now.  When I hit the age of tax paying, I really hope that there is no more U.N., because I know I don't want my hard earned cash going to them.  I don't think reform will fix this, I think scrapping the whole thing will fix it.  Get rid of it.  Scr00 the whole frkn thing.   All my info. came from  urlLink here .  I turned it around, paraphrased, and made it a little easier to read, I think ;)

      Y'know.  I've been thinking about what to ramble on about today. Fear not, it's the last two days of school, and I don't get much accomplished anyways.  Thinking about blogging is probably one of the better things I do [eat candy, talk, eat candy, draw, eat... yeah XD].  All I could think about was the last few years and how my political stance on about everything took a 180 degree turn, along with my life in general.  First off, I was born and raised in a liberal family and church.  Democrats to the max, so left they were almost right (but not really XD).  Heard all the grand things about Clinton, supported his reelection, liked him through all his oral sex crap (I was in fifth grade, I didn't know/care what it was), and was a proud, strong Democrat.  I was of the left.  In the last election, I supported Gore.  Didn't like him, liked Bradley myself, but Gore got the nomination.  Hated Bush.  Hated him.  My mother hated him, father, pastor, church members, etc., etc.  Well, after the whole Florida Fiasco, Bush was president.  AGH. WHAT AN OUTRAGE I TELL YOU!  I HATED THE MAN!  HOW COULD HE BE IN OFFICE?!    So, I'm in sixth grade or so at this time, and I argued with my (right) teacher about Bush, and how Bush was "an idiot, forgot Medicare was a government program, etc., etc."  I was kindly asked if I had ever misspoke, and got shut up and schooled by this educated man whom I adore.  Eighth grade I started to turn, ever so slightly, a shade of right.  My American History teacher, Mr. John Amfahr (he's also my track coach now), is a Republican Catholic.  How do I know this?  I'm very perceptive about those things.  Both he and his father own a TON of Notre Dame apparel, the way he talks, his views on things, all point to Catholic.  He's a good, strong, articulate man, and he lectured the class for entire class periods about the war in Iraq, Bush, 9/11, and it was all from the "right" point of view.  And I agreed with it.  Which meant I disagreed with what I _had_ agreed with.  Which meant.  I was growing up!  That meant I'd have to disagree with some people. My mother and father were separating, I joined an Assembly of God (notoriously right) church, surrounded myself with a variety of friends, and went to work at becoming politically active.  It's not easy when you're 14 and living in a broken house of liberals to try and find yourself in the political world.  It really isn't.  But I began to enjoy Bush as a leader, I supported the war, still do, supported his cabinet, still do, and on and on.  I am now in love with President Bush, I adore the man, he's awesome, I have pictures of him on my wall, I have a letter from the White House, etc., etc.  Drives.my.parents.bonkers  And I love it.  It's thoroughly amusing.  So this year, instead of being the close-minded one and have my only argument be "Bush is an idiot!"  I actually have stood back, looked at the country, and would love to have the "idiot" [ or not ] be in office for another 4 years.

      http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/05-26-2004/0002182423&EDATE=  And now, watch Big Al get picked apart by Annoyed Kate.    - he has brought deep dishonor to our country and built a durable reputation as the most dishonest President since Richard Nixon.  Yes... because Nixon was a horrible President?  What?  O_o  - Just as he would not honor the United Nations,  LMAO.  Who in their right mind would  honor the U.N. .  Corrupt pile of crap.  - [not honor] the opinions of our allies,  Oh.  You mean France?  *fits of giggles*  - How did we get from September 12th , 2001, when a leading French newspaper ran a giant headline with the words "We Are All Americans Now"  You mean France?  *fits of giggles*  *cough*  - this administration sought to radically destroy the foreign policy consensus that had guided Americasince the end of World War II.  I can picture it now, President Bush, Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Cheney, Dr. Rice, etc., etc. all in the Oval Office coming up with a scheme to just screw over all of our allies (NOT FRANCE). Or.  Not?   Yes.  - because an American policy of dominance is as repugnant to the rest of the world  But then again, we have to please everybody!  THAT'S RIGHT!!  My bad there--thought we might be able to think for ourselves.  Nevermind.  - And as always happens -- sooner or later -- to those who shake hands with the devil, they find out too late that what they have given up in the bargain is their soul.  This from a man who worked under the CLINTONS?!  - One of the clearest indications of the impending loss of intimacy with one's soul is the failure to recognize the existence of a soul  Did he just try to say something... smart?  *blink*  - He has created more anger and righteous indignation against us as Americans than any leader of our country in the 228 years  This... from a man... WHO WORKED FOR THE CLINTONS?!  - He has exposed Americans abroad and Americans in every U.S. town and city to a greater danger of attack by terrorists because of his arrogance, willfulness, and bungling at stirring up hornet's nests that pose no threat whatsoever to us.  Y'know... that's kinda what we all thought before 9/11.  "They won't hurt us!  We rawk!"  Now you're complaining that he's trying to prevent that from happening again?  Make up your frkn mind.  - The unpleasant truth is that President Bush's utter incompetence has made the world a far more dangerous place and ramatically increased the threat of terrorism against the United States.  Who's incompetence?  Sounds like ol' Al is trying to shove the blame off of... someone... wonder who that could be?    That's about all I can stand to read of it and write about [for now].  You tear the rest apart for yourselves.

      The President fell off his bike, got some cuts and bruises, but was able to ride back home.  Who does that sound like?!  MEEEEEEE :D  Only my "fall" was on an all-weather track.  I got tripped in the first 100m of an open 800m race, and I got cuts/bruises/swelling/black crap in my knees, but I got back up and ran the race.   I feel for the man, it has to hurt like a beach, but he still has to be cheery.  I was able to be ticked off after mine, he still has to be president -_-  Earlier this month, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry took a spill from his bicycle while riding with Secret Service agents through Concord, Mass., about 18 miles north of Boston. Kerry fell when his bike hit a patch of sand. He was not injured.    Told about Bush's mishap, Kerry said, "I hope he's OK. I didn't know the president rode a bike."  John K. can frk off.  Go drink some wine, man.   I am so cool.

      Now, abortion is not something I take lightly, and, once again, Senor Waffles manages to give me something to rant about.     "Yesterday brought yet another flip-flop from the junior Senator from Massachusetts, this time on abortion. After vowing to filibuster pro-life judges, Kerry now says he would consider appointing them to the Supreme Court:   DEMOCRATS fretting over fumbles by John Kerry's campaign have something new to agonize over - his bizarre flip-flop yesterday on abortion rights.  After months of saying he'd have a litmus test as president and only pick pro-choice Supreme Court justices, Kerry did an about-face and said he might name some right-to-life justices after all.   "I will not appoint somebody with a 5-4 [Supreme] Court who's about to undo Roe v. Wade," Kerry told The Associated Press.   "But that doesn't mean that if that's not the balance of the court, I wouldn't be prepared ultimately to appoint somebody to some court who has a different point of view. I've already voted for people like that. I voted for Judge [Antonin] Scalia."   For an extra helping of flip-flop, Kerry then added that his vote for right-to-life Scalia was "a mistake." ...  Even more bizarre: Last year, Kerry vowed to "filibuster, if necessary," to block any Supreme Court nominee who's anti-choice. Now he's ready to nominate the kind of judge that he'd already pledged to filibuster to block.    But wait! Kerry's pro-choice supporters quickly demanded that the Senator "clarify" his remarks:   Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which has endorsed Kerry, said, ``I'd like to hear him use language that is stronger.''  The Boston Fog Report documents Kerry's constantly evolving position on appointing pro-life Supreme Court justices.   The Los Angeles Times' Nick Anderson and Michael Finnegan report that, in a meeting with Ralph Nader, Kerry sought to distance himself from Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and the Democratic leadership in Congress:   Kerry replied: "Don't judge me by the people who preceded me. You may have had a disagreement with [President] Bill Clinton, or [former Vice President] Al Gore, or the Democratic leadership in Congress…. but that's not me. I have fought with you, I have been with you on a range of issues, and you should judge me by my record in the Senate."  This is quite different from the pose Kerry was striking last week while campaigning in Arkansas:   By the time he finished his 20-hour swing through the city Thursday, the Massachusetts senator had dropped Clinton's name at least a dozen times. He had tried to imitate Clinton's drawl. And he had visited Doe's Eat Place, a smoky barbecue joint that was a renowned hangout for Clinton and his staff.  The senator's embrace of the two-term president and former Arkansas governor, who still inspires devotion among some voters and is disdained by others, contrasts sharply with the posture struck by the last Democratic presidential nominee.    Perhaps the Kerry of this week is finding that his Clinton imitation of last week is wearing thin.  (Taken from the  urlLink GWB  blog)    Ok Johnny.  Ok. Look.  Either shut the frk up or propose a way to fix problems.  This changing your mind thing depending on who you're around... you're not in high school anymore, big boy.  People are always watching.    Just a thought.  Raising taxes by SIX BILLION DOLLARS won't fix anything.  Six billion dollars.     That's seven months salary gone to taxes for a good friend of mine. And that, my friends, is absolutely, horrendously ridiculous.  As for gas prices, I don't want to hear a single liberal complain with Mr. K. and his $.50 gas tax.  Ok Johnny.  Ok.

      Well then.  This was brought on, by, of all things, the show "Colonial House."  What's that?  Well, it's a Public Broadcasting Company program (the local station here is IPTV) and it is like the show "Frontier House." Basically, a group of people are living/surviving in/through "1628" and trying to turn a profit for their investors.  Oh, but it's so much more than that.  Because why did the first pilgrims come over here?   Religious freedom. To turn a profit for their investors.  However.  Zee Govenor is a bit obsessed with the Puritan views. And these people, the colonists, are finding that fact out rather abruptly.   Now since I've given very little background information on my personal religious beliefs in this blog, the doctrines of my church are  urlLink here , and that'll give you a small inkling as to where I stand about Jesus, the Holy Spirit, the beginning, the end, and on and on.  Does this mean I'm a loud Bible thumper? Well, I sure don't think I am.  I mean.  I'm not afraid to tell you that there's a heaven, a hell, and a loving righteous God that died for me, for you, for  the world  on a wooden cross on a hill called Calvary.  So if that makes me a bigot, then I want to be the best bigot  ever .  But I don't try to shove the envelope... to hard.  I'll talk about bigots some other day.  ANYWAYS.  Back to Colonial House.  These people were picked up from random parts of the country and dropped down in one little group of houses.  Now.  In 1628,  everybody  had to observe the Sabbath, ne?  Riiiiiiiight.  However, this doesn't sit so well with some of our Atheist colonists.  Shocker.  One woman in particular, I can't recall her name, she has black hair though, is just terrified she'll have to pray to a God she doesn't believe in, she had to pray a ton of empty prayers when she was a kid, etc., etc.  Catholic upbrining I'm guessing.  She's pretty ticked.  On the other hand, my favorite male colonist (who happens to be an Atheist) explains that this is not about religion to him, but about a community event that needs to be respected for what it is.  The Governor, oddly enough, is a pastor from Texas (odd how great things come from the ol' TX...), and his wife and children are strong Christians.   At the first service in the colony, the older daughter speaks. She starts off with this verse:   Jeremiah 1:5 - "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations."   Now this girl, a woman really, is a very eloquent speaker, absolutely amazing.  To start it off, she's in tears because she really misses her home church, she misses the people, the family atmosphere. To be honest, that's why I go to a church.  It is so reassuring, so comforting, so uplifting to know that I'm not the only one who thinks like I do, to know that there are other people who love me very much, and they BELIEVE THE SAME THINGS THAT I DO! :O  Anyways.  She is talking about the fact that she just cannot stop telling people about  the peace, the joy, the love  that she has in God, in Jesus.  To know that he loved her before she even existed, and that he still loves her regardless.  She doesn't want to be pushy, but she's FOUND IT, and that she wants everybody to be able to FIND IT too.   Cut to the lady in the black hair.  "Well, "so-and-so" was talking this morning, and I really do think she's a smart, talented, beautiful girl, but I think she was giving too much credit to God and not enough credit to herself."  'SCUSE ME?!  I stared at the television.  I COULD NOT believe that ANYONE could/would possibly say that.  Give... myself... more credit for what I am? *blink*  More like for what I am NOT, for what I'm lacking.  What's in this lady's drinking water? O_O   Ok.  We're going to get one thing VERY clear before I go on. I cannot and will not take credit for anything I ever accomplish on my own.  Y'know why?  Well, I didn't lift myself out of nothingness, I didn't give myself peace, I didn't give myself rest, wisdom, love, salvation, righteousness, strength, faith, etc., etc., etc.  And, oddly enough, I didn't die on a cross, that might expalin why I'm able to type right now.  Just a thought.   I'm not GOD!  What a frkn shock!  O-:=  So, I have a problem with that lady with the black hair now.  She's like a liberal complaining about gas prices.  An atheist complaining about their life.  Do me a favor and just shaddup.  She's very stuck on having herself being right and not trying to/denying the fact that she has to fix the real problem, HERSELF.  Scary how that sounds like many people I know who are just content to go it on their own and just roll a die about heaven and hell.  -_-  I'm totally off of my original track.  I was just going to say "I am nothing without the One who made me, lived for me, died for me, loves me, speaks to me, and will some day judge me," but clearly I've siad a bit more.  No appologies from this one though ;)  Reading is grood for you, fools!  :D   Oh.  And I qualified for state track.  Yoink. ;)  Halleluja, thank you Jesus.  I and another member of the 4x800 relay are Christians.  Just a thought.    I thirst.

      First off, excellent read  urlLink right here  if you're having a rough day, which I know I am.  Stressed out about track.  .-.  Anyways.  Politics.  The John Kerry commercial cracks me up.  "In 19-somethingorother John Kerry cast the deciding vote that created 20 million new jobs."  LMAO!!!!  WTH?!  There's a bill that can create 20 mill. new jobs?!  Let's pass a bunch of those while we're at it!    Anyways.  That's about it for now.   Thrilling.  *sigh*

      Yeah.  Somebody got beheaded.  And I am well, honestly, I'm thoroughly pissed off about it.  And the way some members of my party have been shoving the blame off about the prison abuse scandal.  Childish.  Downplaying what actually happened.  Moronic.  I cannot understand these people.    But the beheading. The news only showed 30 second clips. The actual tape was 5 minutes and 37 seconds. How do I know? Well, I watched it, of course *blink*  And after watching it, I cannot understand what goes through these people's minds.  I cannot comprehend what kind of solice these people get for their offences by killing someone.  The man screamed for a good 30 seconds.  How these people can... live, can FUNCTION, is beyond me.    But.  We've got to be the big people here.  *sigh*  We've got to be the understanding country.  But man, sometimes I just want to go punch those people in the mouth and ask wth they were thinking.  And then I remember that I'm fortunate to live here, fortunate to get an education, fortunate to have opportunities to be something great, fortunate to not have to fear for my life (generally XD), and that being tolerant is part of the package.  Dang it.

      A couple thoughts.  I don't think that kicking Rummy off of his post will accomplish ANYTHING.  I mean, I think he's in a little to deep to just yoink him out, but maybe that's just me.  I don't think he's the problem in the prison abuse situation, and what needs to happen is have the PROBLEM removed.  Idiots.  And poor Colin Powell.  Who doesn't love Colin?!    http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=519722  Just remember this little thing folks:  that crazy lady likes her name to be said as "Teh-reza," and her husband wants "Teh-reza" your taxes.   Anywho.  Have a lovely day.

      Woot.  This name is awesome.  Oh yeah.  So.  I'm Kate.  I'm not used to this whole introduction thing, so, please forgive me, eh?  ;)  Well.  I'm a conservative Christian who goes to an absolutely wonderful Pentecostle church in Des Moines, Iowa.  I'm located a little south of that in no-man's-land.  I'm a freshman in high school, coming up on the end of that title, however.  Soon I will be "sophomore."  Scary.  Scary.  I am also currently employed by the Indianola Aquatic Center as an operations assistant.  That'll be fun with softball.  Ahem.  I also play the piano (have for around 6 years now) and percussion (well, I guess piano is percussion...), I love to pick apart songs, and I also enjoy song writing.  So yes.  I'm a colorful character, or at least like to think myself one.  As for family, my parents are almost at the one-year mark of their separation, though they are still working with the lawyer on the "divorice."  Both are seeing somebody currently, or at least what I know of it.  My parents are liberals, and basically have the polar-opposite views of the world that I hold.  Ah.  Life.   This'll be my political blog, I'll keep my personal life melodramatic juvenille crap to  urlLink live journal .  So yes.    If you don't like what you read, then move on.  I'm watching you, fools. •_•  Hear me roar.

      America is one pissed off nation, and we are far too comftorable with that.  We like being angry because it's what we know.  We are not a people who embrace change and thus whatever we are used to is what we stick with.  I used to be an angry person, which I know is hard to believe considering I'm 15 and shouldn't have a "past life," but live with it.  Real anger doesn't happen all at once, it is a series of events that leads up to hating everybody.  I find that my own path to pissyness correlates with the angriness of America.  Fifty frkn percent of marriages end in divorice. I will only say this once. That is sick and that is wrong. Broken houses tend to spawn angry people.  There are TV commercials for anti-depresents.  And Cialis.  And Viagra.  Turn on the radio.  Eminem.  Need I say more?  TV doesn't help much.  Dan Rather and MTV.  I mean really.  Drugs and alcohol haven't ever had a happy ending for anyone, and yet both are embraced by the current "public".  Going to a baseball game is like attending a drunk-fest anymore.  I think people, my relatives being a prime example, try to mask their anger with substances, while what they're really doing is pissing themselves off even more.  Hangovers always make people cheery.  Lying is commonplace anymore.  I really wish it wasn't, but it is.  Honesty is... where again?  That whole "Thou shalt not lie" thing is kind of in the "Christians Just Hate Everybody" category nowadays.  When people lie to me, it totally makes me day! [/end sarcasm]  Road rage.  Pissed off people controlling a ton a steel cruising around at 75 mph while surrounded by other pissed off people in the same state.  Cursing.    I don't swear unless I am absolutely pissed, while some of my peers drop f-bombs like candy.  Yes, yes, I would love to live in the little "Christian Box" and pretend that everybody smells like roses, goes to heaven, loves each other and uses correct English, but the fact is that's not the way it is.  My coaches, teachers, friends, etc., etc. (luckily not my church leaders) all curse.  I've witnessed it.  No matter how quiet you try to make it, kids notice.   Been there, done that, living it. Swearing doesn't make me happy, I always regret it (sooner if not later), and between watching people getting flipped off and hearing the f-word thrown around, I'm tired of it.  Case in point: Today my teammate was talking to her  father  on her cell phone before we boarded the bus.  She got on the bus a few minutes later and someone asked her who she was talking to.  She said, "Oh.  That was my dad.  I pissed him off.  He was angry because I told him we hadn't gotten to talk in a while and that I was upset with him about some stuff.  He kinda went crazy and was all, 'God Katie, you're such a fucking failure' and stuff like that."  Now, I know Katie's dad.  He used to coach my little league team.  He's not only a drinker, but a smoker too.  I do not know where someone finds room to call another person a "fucking failure," ever.  Much less if it's your own flesh and blood... or if it's your own child.  [If you do say that kind of thing to your kids, get off my blog now.  Scum.]   We're an angry people.  We're used to it.  We like it to an extent.  We try to cover it up but end up making ourselves even angrier in the process.  We've accepted it.  The last few months, I've tried to enjoy myself.  I mean,  really  enjoy myself.  Laughing and smiling has done me so much good.  Life.  Is.  A.  Blast.  Maybe I can find a way to make happiness popular like Atkins...  Don't worry. Get happy [America]   In other news:  There's a bat in the house. I finally got the Hannity book from the library. JV tied, Varsity lost tonight. I'm tired. I'm really an elephant at the zoo.  Come by and say hi sometime.  Good night.

      My trip kind of stunk.  Being sick will tend to do that.  But for the most part, Morris, Illinois is...  I don't know.  I slept the whole time.  I have no exciting vacation stories, all right?!  Fine!  Just fine!  (I am going to Chicago later on this summer.  There is hope.)  At any rate, I'm not offended at all that Bush is using Adolf Hitler to compare to Krazy Kerry & Ko. I don't know if it was the wisest thing for his campaign to do. But I don't have a problem with it.  John Kerry never ceases to amaze me.  The man _now_ has a problem with the Nazi's being brought up.  Why now?  What about Zack Exley, Al Gore (several times), George Soros,  or Michael Moore?  Is not everyone equal Mr. Kerry?  Perhaps... Chancellor Kerry?  And I had Belgian waffles for breakfast too..

      42.  I have long been puzzled with people's interest in that number.  "What's the answer?" "I don't know, but it has to be 42."  "What's the meaning to life?" "42."  I mean.  What now?  o.O  I DON'T GET IT.   So the other day, I was reading Matthew 1 (The Geneology of Christ), and having nothing better to do, counted up all the generations between Abraham and Jesus.  42.  o.o  Coincidence?   urlLink Not really.    The number 42 is used 8 times in the Bible.  The numbers 11 and 15 are used 42 times in the Bible.  On the whole, 42 books of the Bible use the number 7, whose eight in the NT.  Nicephore, which deducted the words of the Greek original text of the Revelation, counted 42 proper nouns.  The word star is used 42 times in the OT.      Seriouslah.   So there you go.  Another one of Kurious Kate's mini-projects.  And now you know, the answer to life really does lie in "42."     In other news,  urlLink John Kerry wants more of your money...   I mean seriously.  He wants to "cut the deficit in half" and pour more money into EVERYTHING...  And yet acts as though it won't come at a price to the economy and American people.  People.  Like.  Their.  Money.  Anybody want to prove me wrong? o.o  'Cause send me a check if I am--I know I like money.    Speaking of which. First paycheck ev-ar this week. Ching. Buying myself a[nother] fitted STL Cardinals cap :x  But now I'm off topic.  42. Kerry wants your money.  The end.

      I was eight years old when I started taking piano lessons.  And I am very proud to say that today was the last recital for a teacher that I will probably ever perform.  Many songs and ovations later, I can look back and say that I have been taught not only about the piano, but taught about life in general, and taught quite well if I do say so.  I started lessons with a neighbor, we didn't have a piano at the time, so I went over there every day to practice.  Finally, I got a [used] piano, the one I still play today, a standing Whitney by Kimball (that needs to be tuned ;)).  I then "graduated" from my neighbor (I got too good, ok?! :P), and moved on to Susan Holman.  She is an amazing pianist but a fairly craptastic teacher, though I did learn a great deal from her.  She was gracious enough to teach a sixth grader Mozart's Sonata in D Minor.  1+ at contest, standing ovation and even TEARS at my sixth grade talent show (I also gave a DARE graduation speech, but that's another story ;)), and a great story to tell :).  Well, finally my mother had all she could handle of bi-polar Susie, and I moved on to Susan Piffer.  Susan is one of the most genuine people I've ever met.  It's sick XD  She picks your piano form apart, though by the time I came to her I had all of the basics down, so her teaching wasn't very effective for me.  She's very friendly and honest and loving, but... just not my type ;)  I am very honored, though, to go out with her as my teacher.  Seven years of my life.  Once a week.  Going to a stranger's house and playing the piano, then getting picked apart and playing the piano some more.  I'm not going to kid you or make myself out to look like a prodigy.  At one point, I hated the piano.  I despised it.  It was hard and boring, I couldn't figure it out, I was frustrated, and I just hated it.  This is normally where people [like my own sister] give up, pack up, and later regret it.  Not I ;)  Once I learned all the notes, how they sounded with each other, chords, inversions, once I knew about everything there was to know about the sounds, it got so much easier.  I actually enjoyed the piano.  The first song I ever made up was wretched. The second song I made up wasn't much better. Same for the third.  Ah, but then something changed. Suddenly, I realized that I could a) use more than two chords and that b) the chords didn't have to be right next to each other! :O.  I find it quite amusing that I was able to not only find a lyricist, but build a chorus out of the material they graciously gave me during my last week of lessons.  I find it quite sad that the great Ray Charles passed away during my last week of lessons.  I also find now that I am not only capable, but willing to write quality songs, that the guitar is a far more portable instrument than the piano.  Thus.  My next musical adventure.  So if there are any recommendations as to what type of guitar to keep my eyes open for, let them be heard :D  For news, my grandmother was able to come to my recital reception (she got out of the hospital and is doing fairly well), my sister's team won their championship game this afternoon, and I am currently batting .620+ for my own softball endeavours, and George W. Bush is still an amazing President.  Seven years.  Well spent.

        A Tale of Calzone    One day in a land far far away, full of unicorns, fuzzy things, cookies and gummy gnomes, there lived a mighty Calzone.  Now, this wasn't your ordinary calzone. This was a   Calzone  . Big, hairy, muscular arms, thick legs, small furry rodent for a pet, a mustache, and of course, gigantic feet.  One day Calzone was tromping down its street, when suddenly the Wicked Witch of the West and Mary Poppins floated down on their broomstick and umbrella (!), and started poking Calzone in the eye with their forms of transportation.  Calzone, obviously shocked and in pain started to scream, "AH MAH AYE!!! AH MAH AYE!!!" (all the while Mary Poppins is humming "A Spoonful of Sugar" and the Wicked Witch of the West is randomly cackling for good measure)  Finally, Calzone was able to back away from the two evil, poking-obsessed, humming/cackling women. Calzone then proceeded to pick up the Wicked Witch of the West in its right hand and pick up Mary Poppins in its left hand.  Calzone bashed their heads together and ate them, broomstick, umbrella and all.  The. End.   Written for my hamster-loving-Canadian pal, Kyla, whose last name sounds an awful lot like "Calzone." This has absolutely nothing to do with politics.   Comic relief, if you will.  (Though it would be really funny to see John Kerry "poked in the eye with forms of transportation." ;))

         Democrat, Republican, or Southern Republican?      What with elections coming up, we should all decide.  Question: How do you tell the difference between Democrats, Republicans, and Southern Republicans? The answer can be found by posing the following scenario:  You're walking down a deserted street with your wife and two small children. Suddenly, a dangerous-looking man with a huge knife comes around the corner, locks eyes with you, screams obscenities, raises the knife, and charges. You are carrying a Glock 9 mm, and you are an expert shot. You have mere seconds before he reaches you and your family. What do you do?  Democrat's Answer:  Well, that's not enough information to answer the question! Does the man look poor or oppressed? Have I ever done anyting to him that would inspire him to attack? Could we run away? What does my wife think? What about the kids? Could I possibly swing the gun like a club and knock the knife out of his hand? What does the law say about this situation? Does the Glock have the appropriate safety built into it? Why am I carrying a loaded gun anyway, and what kind of message does this send to society and to my children? Is it possible he'd be happy with just killing me? Does he definitely want to kill me, or would he be content just to wound me? If I were to grab his knees and hold on, could my family get away while he was stabbing me? Should I call 9-1-1? Why is this street so deserted? We need to raise taxes, have a paint and weed day, and make this a happier, healthier street that would discourage such behavior. This is all so confusing! I need to debate this with some friends for a few days and try to come to a consensus.  Republican's Answer:  BANG!  Southern Republican's Answer:  BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! click...(sounds of reloading). BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! click.  Daughter: "Nice grouping, Daddy! Were those the Winchester Silver Tips?"   -Note lack of last name ;) -Note lack of pity for liberals  That is all.

      *sigh*  President Reagan is dead.  I heard literally moments after Smarty Jones lost.  Went in to my room, started drawing a mountian lion, top of the hour news came on Northwestern College Radio and...  He's dead.  The long goodbye.  I know what it's like, not with alzheimers, but my uncle Jeff was diagnosed with brain cancer a few years ago, and though he's doing wonderful now, we all know it's just a matter of time.  At least I know where Reagan is at this morning.  That's more than I can say when the death of my own parents, and some of my dear friends occurs.  Granted, the man had some faults, but we all have to give him his time, his days of remebrance.  If Hillary Clinton were to die today, I'd shut up about it, I'd let her have her peace.  Wish I could say the same about the libs.  Not being a CBS person, I did see Dan Rather get emotional towards the end of their broadcast when his voice cracked and he paused before saying goodnight, then they quickly cut the camera.  -_-  The man who gave us prosperity in the 90's, ended the Cold War, and revitalised the Republican party is dead.  Viva la Reagan revolucion.

       MTV, the network that brought us the infamous Super Bowl halftime show, has announced that they are beginning a cable TV network to push the homosexual lifestyle. The new network will be advertiser-supported and will be offered as part of the “basic” package by cable networks. You will be forced to pay for it whether you want it or not.  The network is scheduled to begin operating next February. MTV plans to really promote the network. "We have big plans and hopes for LOGO (the new homosexual network)," said Tom Freston, CEO of MTV networks. MTV is owned by Viacom, which also owns CBS, Showtime, VH1, Comedy Central and TV Land.  The selection of LOGO as the name of the homosexual network is an apparent attempt to play on the Greek word "Logos" which is used in scripture (John 1:1-14) to identify Christ.  -Email from the American Family Association   I can't even find words to describe how incredibly disgusted I am.  But then again.  I shouldn't be surprised.    morals    Why even bother.

      Being the curious person I am, summer break is a good chance for me to answer all those little questions that pop in my mind during the school year.  Now, the fish on people's cars.  Being a Christian, I knew it was a Christian symbol, but I just assumed it meant that it meant they believed in creation as opposed to evolution.  Oh, but it's really so much cooler than that XD  It's called an  ichthus .  Ooooichthus.  It's an acronym.  I (Jesus in Greek) X (Christ) O (theta) (God) Y (Son) E (epsilon) (Savior)  If you pronounce IXOYE in Greek, it is ichthus (means fish).  Thus, the little fish on people's cars.   :D Jaja.  Amusing myself.  :P

      I'm currently reading two books.  "The Portable Conservative Reader" edited by Russell Kirk  and  "The New Thought Police, Inside the Left's Assault On Free Speech and Free Minds" by Tammy Bruce.  For good relaxing reading, I recommend the latter, but if you're into learning about the meat, the heart, the soul of conservatism, have a large vocabulary, and aren't afraid to stop and reread something a few times to make sense of it, the first one will amuse you.  Though, I must admit, it is a challenge.  I finally made it through the [rather large] introduction of the Conservative Reader, and well.  It was hard.  Now that I'm done with the introduction, I believe it'll get easier.  It's a compilation of many conservative works (Burke, Adams, Macaulay, Disraeli, Henry, Lewis, etc., etc.).  Ah well.  Hope for the best.  The New Thought Police is written by an "openly gay, pro-choice, gun-owning, pro-death penalty, liberal, voted-for-Reagan feminist."  Everybody should read this book, seriously.  Very very well written and edited.  I'm only on page 10 or so (there's an introduction, I'm not that slow of a reader :P), but I   She slams the left.  Everybody should love it ;)   But now to my real point. I'm curious. Go figure. I get to thinking about the Bible a lot. People tend to pick and choose the parts of the Bible they want to be true for themselves.  But.  That's not the way it works, though.  Right?  Either it's all right, or it's all wrong. Right? "Thou shalt not kill." I'm going with right.  Just a personal opinion here.  I mean, if a piece of it is up for debate, then ALL of it is up for debate.  If one part is "not right," then how can that not be said about ALL of it?   But being the "see-both-sides" person I try to be, I got to thinking about the other religious texts.   Hm.  The Koran.  Now, nobody ever like... quotes the Koran really.  Maybe it's just the people I hang out with.  So now, I'm reading the Koran, and my hope is to get it done before I go back to school.  Needless to say, it's very boring, and I'm literally only on "The Cow" right now. 2 of 114.  Ouch.  So.  In my search to see if the "all right or all wrong" argument is really going to work, here I go.  ;)  I'm curious. Go figure.

      I love mail. I love getting mail. I love sending mail. I love buying cards to send in the mail. I'm a mail addict.  My name is Kate.  And stamps rawk.  A few months ago, I wrote a letter to the President.  It was on 8 1/2 x 13 paper, because I bought a reem of that over Christmas break, because of my shoe designs, because...  Well.  That's another story.  BACK ON TRACK...ahem...the letter said something of the sort as follows:  Dear President Bush,          I just wanted you to know, that even though John Kerry might not like you, I sure do, and that's all that really matters, right? ;)  Kate D. Age 15, future registered Republican    Ja.  The way I looked at it was:  "If I were President, would I want to get this letter?"  Well yeah o.O  I'd love to get this letter.  :D  I should add I also sent a letter to the last administration, and it took them around eight months to respond.  (it was about banning smoking, but I think that alienates about my entire audience, so I'll shaddup now ;))  This one came in around a month or so.  Coincidence? I think not.   Anywho.  The response ;)    Dear Kate:  Thank you for your kind words of support.  I am honored to have the responsibility of serving as President of this great country.  You also have an important responsibility to be a good citizen.  I encourage you to study hard, make the right choices, and help others.  By setting high standards, you can achieve your dreams.  Mrs. Bush joins me in sending our best wishes.  May God bless you, and may God continue to bless America.  Sincerely,     George W. Bush  (I got a picture of G.W. and a funny look from my dad to go along with it XD)   Mmmmmmmmmmail.    [Yes I am up late.  It's summer break.  The bus broke down on the way home from my softball game, and I'm awake.  Fin?!  .-.]

      I know, I know, I'm techincally gone, and I'm technically busy, and I'm technically supposed to update the  last  entry.  But I don't feel like it.  Remember  urlLink this?    We are state champions.   That's right, folks, for the first time since  1941 .  What an absolutely amazing way to close out not only the senior's amazing careers, but an amazing way to end a 30+ year reign of the coach, Mr. Jim Donohugh.   Never before have I seen the man cry, but today, today it all changed. Everybody was crying.  My uncles, my aunts, my friends, my classmates, my teachers.  It was one of the most... bonding?  Communal? events of my entire life.   It started the way most games start, with the national anthem. The song was sung by two girls from the local high school (Carroll), but the part that made me almost cry was that  everybody else joined in .  That's right, everybody was singing along, both teams, the players, everybody.  And it sounded amazing.  Matt pitched.  A shutout. Sean closed.  Matt's shutout.  6-0.  Devils win.  You must understand that Jim D. is more than a coach, he's like the President.  He has two daughters (oddly enough...) and a son (but that doesn't count ;)).  His wife is a social icon, etc., etc.  Today at the game one of his daughter's brought in a towel, and he threw it [throwing in the towel].  Amazingly, refreshingly sad.    It's over and won.  It's over and done. And golly, it feels frkn fine.  Now to wait another 60 or so years...

      So, this is posted Friday, but I leave Monday.  However, I am going to be gone, though not on vacation, all weekend, because of State Baseball, church, minor league baseball games, etc., etc.  Confused?  Get over it.  In case you couldn't tell, I'm going to Chicago, so if you're stalking me [which I know you are...], feel free to leave the area surrounding my house and go say hi to your own families!  Wednesday (or thereabouts), I shall be dining with the ever-lovely family of  urlLink Guy  and  urlLink Deb  (or Deb and Guy, don't hurt me?).  And yes, you should be absolutely  insane  with jealousy.    For people who run across this for the first time, feel free to dig around, I have some... older stuff you can look at.  A month old, wow, ancient, I know.  For the 20 or so regulars, here's some stuff I dredged up from my livejournal that might be worth looking at over the week.  Don't overwhelm yourself with Kateness, though, it tends to cause temporary headaches, much like a brain freeze, only it's a Kate Freeze?  Turn me off before I break something.  Quickly.    - urlLink My first entry in anything, ever.  - urlLink Gummy Gnomes  - urlLink Oklahoma City Bombing Anniversery  - urlLink Columbine Anniversery  - urlLink My Horrendous Track Crash  - urlLink State Track Meet  - urlLink Script From Theatre Class   (disregard my ranting about setting up a drum set at the beginning)   And that's about it.  You can check out the "calendar" part if you want to read more, crazies.  Warning:  I have over 300 entries, though probably a quarter of them are not visible to you, and an eighth of those aren't visible to anybody but myself.  Yes, I am talking about YOU, be very paranoid.  In other news:  Applications for someone to replace me temporarily as the official "Bat Hunter Of Wick" are currently being accepted at redpopsicle07@iowatelecom.net.  Requirements inclue:  Catching and releasing winged rats, also known as bats.  Free pair of sunglasses included.  Likewise, applications for a temporary replacement as the "Unofficial  urlLink Deb  Stalker" are also currently being accepted redpopsicle07@iowatelecom.net.  Requirements include:  Being a fanatic, checking her page at least five times a day, enjoying yourself.  Mickey mouse ears and chocolate cake included.  The baseball team is playing in the  championship  game tomorrow, and I will update this as to whether they win or lose, because I know you all care SO MUCH.  My mom's $300 bike got stolen.  I leave you with a  urlLink g'bye message  (like gone fishing, but not quite?  laugh, dang it, laugh!), and a picture of your  urlLink contemplative runner .  And I am not cute. But don't barf, please, I don't like cleaning up after my readers.   Merry week.

      Sometimes being right can really suck.  Because in order to be right, somebody has to be wrong. And sometimes that wrong somebody can be, well, verbally violent.  Sometimes thinking things through can really suck.  Because the majority of people like to do things based on their "feelings," and that puts them in a hole of their own misery.  Of course, that puts the people who aren't miserable at fault!  [/sarcasm]  ( oh dear, not Sarcastic Kate again... )  Sometimes knowing what you're talking about can really suck.  Because when you're trying to have a conversation with someone, and all they can do is make things up, it's difficult if not impossible to have a reasonable debate.  Heck, if I could make up things I'd win every debate, EVER.  "John Kerry is really a squirrel who drank a magic potion and is now a man, which explains why he's so freaking nutty."  ( ooo, bad pun, bad pun... )  Sometimes being pleasant can really suck.  Because, though I try to be professional here, sometimes I just want to explode into a profaine rant about how incredibly stupid some people are.  But I haven't, give me credit.  Deep, deep breathes.  Sometimes being a Christian can really suck.  Because I have to walk into a classroom 180 days out of the year and be the only one. Because I have to deal with a world that, for the most part, doesn't like me. Because I have to work with people who hate me because of what I believe. Because I have to constantly explain myself, while I watch the rest of the world get away with murder.  Sometimes being smart can really suck.  Because the majority of the world is made up of un-smart people.  You know what I'm talking about.  Sometimes being conservative can really suck.  Because half of the world, like it or not, consists of screaming liberals.  Sometimes using proper English can really suck.  Because it seems the hick population is growing daily, and when you use a big word in public, you get looked at funny.  There, their, and they're, people.  There, their, and they're.  This is not a difficult concept.  Don't even get me started with my precious preposition song.  Aboard, about, above...  (  no more singing.  ever.  )  Sometimes forgiveness can really suck.  Because being angry is so much easier.  And finally, sometimes being The Kate can really suck.  Because today just sucked.  Spyware, removing spyware, work, a boss that hates me, sister, fighting with my sister, parents, money, parents fighting about money, etc.  massivesighselfhug.  So.  How 'bout them Cardinals...

       urlLink Well, apparently I'm not the only one who thinks I'm not cute.   Is this official attack The Kate week or something?  I've managed to get trolled like no other, and it's getting very old, very fast.  Yet somehow  I  manage to get called the bigot?  What?!  Who's being intolerant of whom here?  Yes, that's right.    urlLink Speculation, but something to think about.   If Bush doesn't run with Cheney, he'll win, especially if he's able to pick up Giuliani, which would personally thrill me.  People don't like Cheney, he's an old coot, but Rudy will be able to give Bush that little push over the top he needs.   urlLink Apparently Saddam had a stroke...   Well, personally, I'd like to see him go through the misery of a trial and all that legal crap, only to be killed at the end of it all, rather than have him die now because of poor health.  Suffer, you old...  Yes.    urlLink Anna Nicole,  you  are a moron.   First, this is Kirstie Alley.  I mean.  Really.  But then:   Instead, Smith says the slimming down is due to a healthier diet and Trimspa, a weight loss supplement she advertises.  Exercise is absolutely not a part of it, though. The former Playboy playmate says, "No, I hate it."   Or maybe... the magical slimming effects of illegal drugs?  But no, no, this is ANNA NICOLE!  She'd never do a thing like that! :o  She was married to Kurt Cobain after all!    Hang on, hang on... wait.   BIG nevermind.    urlLink And, finally, some good news.   Aw.  How precious.   I can only imagine what I'd do.  "Uhm, hi, I run cross country, I can stomp him to death?" Yes, teeny me.  That'd be wonderful.   In other news: Ed says hi. Cross country starts the 16. School starts the 23. World History this year--with my conservative geography teacher.  That'll make for some fun stories. Almost time for [half of my family's] family vacation.   *smirk*

      I play yahoo pool occasionally.  It's fairly amusing, and I'm not terrible, so it all works.  I've met some weird people playing yahoo pool.  Then again, weird people are a part of life.  July fifth I was playing a game with the user Pranav143m.  The conversation was fairly mild to begin with, what's your name, how old are you, where are you from, blah blah blah.  He's literally "Pranav," 21 and from India.  oooo fancy.  Then he asked what I did at night.  From there, the conversation completely changed.  The topic became sex, and more importantly, would I have sex with him.  I told him the truth.  A) I'm not having sex with him.  B) I'm not having sex until I'm married.  Silence.   Finally I mustered "You know, I think you need more to live for than having online sex with strangers."  We then talked about his life and what he does.  He lives for soccer, was Hindu, and could care less about what the Bible said.  I don't know why, but I sat and plead with this absolute stranger for an hour that there was more to life than just living and dying.   From my  urlLink livejournal that night:   There is a part of me that is reaching desperately to help this man, and I can't understand it. But then again, it's not my job to understand it.  I never knew the question, "If you were to die right now, where would you go?" would actually come in handy for me.    For approximately twenty days I did not speak a word to Pranav, all I did was pray. Then tonight I decided to go out and jog. At midnight.  [don't yell at me]  When I returned, I found a message for me from Pranav:  I have given my life to God.  I have given him the blank cheque, all I am.     I cannot tell you what I feel now. I cannot explain to you how much joy this brings to me. I cannot put into words the satisfaction this causes me.   This is what I am called to do. There is a reason I won't just shut up and go away ;)  In other news: Haloscan, wonderful. I'm getting a hamster Monday and naming him Edmund, after Edmund Burke.  I am not a nerd

       urlLink Sometimes people make you think.    "Come on, sweetie, have a little fun."   "Never say never, because you never know. Someday you might like it that way."    ..."But it's generally to desensitize the whole stigma of 'Oh my God, it's a condom.'"    The first two examples are things no teacher should ever say in a class, regardless of subject matter.  Don't call your students sweetie, it's disturbing.  When I had sex ed., there was a group for the girls with the [female] school nurse, and a group for the guys with the [male] health teacher, and it worked wonderfully, the awkwardness, though it still existed, was cut in half.  As for "stigma," these students are in the ninth grade of Modern America.  I know what it's like, because I was just there, and the only stigma that exists about condoms....  well.  It's not there.  Sadly.  People don't get worked up over it, it's just... normal.  Which it shouldn't be, but nonetheless, it is.  What a freaking moron.  My health teacher, who I happen to like, never even came close to the line this guy crossed.  Chalk another one up for home-schooling.   Couresty of the charming  urlLink Reality Hammer     In other news:  urlLink The Mighty Conservative  is in the hospital and is ill, I don't know exactly what with, but yes. Go Lanceeeeeee.  urlLink o.o  I am so tired.  Nap.  Time. Chocolate rice-krispies are grood.

      Everybody has their regrets.  Some more than the average bear  (heyheyhey!) , but I don't think I've held a conversation with a functioning person who doesn't regret something in their life.  And so, on with my tale.  My neighbors are elderly people for the most part.  Almost all of them are over seventy, with a few exceptions.  One of the exceptions used to live across the street from me.  Used to.  There are two houses.  The one to the left is owned by Roy and Alberta, the one to the right is their's as well, but it used to be occupied by their daughter and her two children, Morgan and Mark.  This was not a functional family.  Broken, no father figure, Mom on and off with her ex, and yelling matches we could hear here, in our house.  Morgan and Mark came over to my mom's daycare for a while.  Heck, we have pictures of them in our albums.  Morgan used to babysit me, play barbies with me.  Every day I trudged across my beloved road and waited for the bus.  I had no fear, no anxiety, nothing.  And why should I?  I'm 10 years old, these people were my neighbors, I just stood out at the end of their driveway for the bus.  That's all.  But Mark. Mark was not what you'd call a "good kid."  He's the person who taught me the f-word, the one who threw icy snowballs at passing cars, the one who broke into my family's home while we were on vacation and made 1-900 phone calls, the one who put sugar in my dad's truck's gas tank, screw drivers by the tires, you get it.  But I liked him.  I don't know why.  He was just... cool.  I suppose when you're 10, just cool will cut it. And then came that night.  I don't wake up in the night.  Ever.  To go to the bathroom, to get a drink of water, whatever, I sleep all the way through.  That changed.  There were these glaring lights on the other side of the street. It was a helicopter. Life flight.  And then, there was no more Mark. Shot himself in the head. From the neighbor's accounts, they heard his mother screaming, and just assumed it was another fight. Now all there is to remember this young man is a plaque, near a tree by the elementary of the school.   I've always felt sad about Mark.  I'm not sure why, but I always felt that there was...  something  good in him.  However, I never got a chance to see that.    I've tried this living thing once without Jesus, and it was my great mistake.

      Lance Armstrong.  What a guy.  [ and  he votes Republican]  Ok.  Real update in a few hours.  I have to go be social.  In other news: I suck at pool.   [Update]   In the interest of not bogging my blog (ongthatrhymes) down, I have decided to post the pictures in my  urlLink livejournal .  You don't need a subscription, you don't have to join.    Here, though, I will explain the "making of the blog."  (I've been waching too much VH1, verily)  Each poster takes 2-3 hours each, because I am terribly anal-retentive about them.  I take out my triangles/rulers/compass/etc. and block out the entire poster, seperating each letter by 1/18 of an inch.  Then I go in with my micro-pen, and then finish it off with my Sharpie markers, throwing in color to make it more appealing.  Drives my mother up the wall.  I just keep them on my walls, to amuse me, and to make clear what I'm about to anybody who comes in.  Not that there are a lot of people who come in...  o_o  So.  Enjoy.  If you're just going to give me crap about them, email me at redpopsicle07@iowatelecom.net.  If you feel like being friendly, feel free to leave a comment either here or there.  Anonymous is turned on there, though I would appreciate it if you would sign your posts ;)  Thanks goes to the kitchen chair for graciously holding the posters for me.

      I'm an NPR listener.&nbsp; Get used to it, I happen to like "This American Life," ok?&nbsp; ALL RIGHT?!  &nbsp;  Fine.  &nbsp;  I'm a member of a livejournal NPR community.&nbsp; I was struck by a   urlLink  comment   &nbsp;to a recent post:  ____________________________________________________________________________________  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I was recently in a discussion with a kid (who lives with his parents and doesn't have to support himself, incidentally) who says that we should do away with welfare and let "natural selection" take its course. The "strong" poor will preval and the "weak" poor will...I don't know, die or something.  &nbsp;  According to him (and many Republicans), they are responsible. It's their fault they're poor, and it has nothing to do with luck, location, or the hand they've been dealt in life.  &nbsp;  In my opinion, anything can happen to anyone at any given time to either take away their wealth, or gain them wealth. Many times it's not a matter of how hard they've worked; it's luck. Many rich people are rich because of the family into which they were born. I work two jobs and I struggle to pay my rent and bills. I know a girl whose parents pay for everything for her, and she sits around and drinks at outdoor restaurants all day. Is she "stronger" than I am simply because her parents send her money?  &nbsp;  I'm definitely not saying that everyone who is rich is lucky. Of course there are people who have earned their wealth by hard work. It's just that I don't believe you can lump all the poor together as lazy and expendable, and all the wealthy together as hard workers.  __________________________  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  ...  &nbsp;  - ...who says that we should do away with welfare and let "natural selection" take its course.   - According to him (and many Republicans), they are responsible. It's their fault they're poor, and it has nothing to do with luck, location, or the hand they've been dealt in life.   I think the kid she's talking about is an idiot, getting rid of welfare won't solve the problem of poverty,&nbsp;some people really rely on it, but her generalizing him with all Republicans really isn't helping either.&nbsp; I don't know any sane person who thinks that  every  poor person is poor because of their own actions.  &nbsp;  - "In my opinion, anything can happen to anyone at any given time to either take away their wealth, or gain them wealth."   - Many times it's not a matter of how hard they've worked; it's luck. Many rich people are rich because of the family into which they were born.   Some people have a hard time realizing that "equal opportunity" does not mean "equal outcome."&nbsp; Does luck play into it?&nbsp; Of course it does, but please, just&nbsp;get over it.&nbsp; You can still make your future, and you can still buy a lottery ticket.  The latter tends not to work out as well.  &nbsp;  Ah, but there  is  some motive behind this...  &nbsp;  - I work two jobs and I struggle to pay my rent and bills. I know a girl whose parents pay for everything for her, and she sits around and drinks at outdoor restaurants all day. Is she "stronger" than I am simply because her parents send her money?   Jealousy?&nbsp; Just from reading this comment, it sounds like this person needs a financial plan or a lifestyle change.&nbsp; Or both.  &nbsp;  - It's just that I don't believe you can lump all the poor together as lazy and expendable, and all the wealthy together as hard workers.   And it's just that I don't believe you can lump "many" of the Republicans into poor people haters.  &nbsp;  Are all poor people really poor?&nbsp; Well of course not.&nbsp; Should all abortions be illegal?&nbsp; Well of course not.  There has to be some breathing room.&nbsp; But wait.&nbsp; We all have to be concrete and unable to conform to the circumstances.&nbsp; My bad.  [/end oozing sarcasm]  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  On&nbsp;a different note, why is the Left so very&nbsp;jumpy about the Federal Marriage Amendment when they knew it wasn't going to pass [this time]?  &nbsp;  Are they afraid that... the majority of&nbsp;[voting] Americans&nbsp;might actually think differently than they do?!&nbsp; GASP!&nbsp; That'd just be too much.&nbsp; The sky would fall, people would think clearly, and the fabric of society might stay together?&nbsp; Aw.&nbsp; That's terrible.[/x2]  &nbsp;  They're quite riled up that the House/Senate is bringing it up now, in an election year.&nbsp; And... why would that be?&nbsp; Because it will not help&nbsp;Kerry out.&nbsp; Ah.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; We're only allowed to do and say things that will boost&nbsp;the Left&nbsp;up.  &nbsp;  My bad.  [/end oozing sarcasm x3]  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Finally, the NAACP.  I really don't like those people.  The last time President Bush spoke to them, they followed it up by running attack ads at him about how he "stole" Florida.  If I were the President, that would totally make me run back and speak to those people. [/x4, wow I'm bad today :D]  They are the black section of the Democratic party, they support homosexual marriage, affirmative action, etc., etc.  Because, after all, those are all things that President Bush goes out of his way to support. [/x5, get used to it]  So, good job, President Bush.&nbsp; Good job.  &nbsp;  And Mfumi really, really annoys me.&nbsp; I mean.&nbsp; Really.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  In other news:  Happy Birthday, Nelson Mandella.&nbsp; Your prison time carried far more weight than Martha's ever will, no matter what she says, man ;)&nbsp;  We lost our game last night, thus ending my softball season.&nbsp; Golly.  Bring on the bats.  Got a new sitemeter, I messed my last one up :D yayme *slinks away*   cuteness

      I go to a very small school.&nbsp; The average graduating class hovers around 40.&nbsp; We don't have a lot of athletic talent to choose from. &nbsp; Our last state title was in  anything  was in  1941 . &nbsp; It was a baseball title. &nbsp; The team hitch-hiked to the state tournament due to the lack of petrolium.&nbsp; A gas truck overturned in a ditch close to the town and the team waded in the gasoline, getting a few gallons to give to the people willing to give them a ride. They could barely afford one bat. At the semi-final game they started with literally only nine players, the rest arrived later. &nbsp; &nbsp; This year,&nbsp;our streak&nbsp;might change. &nbsp; The class of graduated seniors is something special. &nbsp; Our football team went undefeated.&nbsp; They went to the state tournament, they lost, but this is the first time we have ever gone.&nbsp; Ever. &nbsp; Several wrestlers went to state,&nbsp; the basketball team didn't do to shabby. &nbsp; But baseball,&nbsp; baseball is our bread and butter. &nbsp; First, the field. &nbsp; It is a field of dreams.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; Surrounded by corn fields, our single road running on one side.&nbsp; During football season when a field goal/extra point is kicked to the south end, [a usually small] someone has to go retrieve the ball out of the cornfield. &nbsp; The seniors are amazing. &nbsp; Matt, one of the pitchers, gave up no earned runs.&nbsp; The entire season.&nbsp; None. Sean, the catcher, owns the record for the most stolen bases in the state.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; He also owns the record for the most carreer rushing yards in the state (football ;)). Wes, Joel, Aaron, Alex, Josh,&nbsp; C.J. &nbsp; All seniors. &nbsp; Currently rated #1 in class 1A. &nbsp; The teams has lost 3 times this year. &nbsp; The coach, our athletic director, Jim Donohugh, has been doing this  forever . Carreer record of 747-299. He is obsessed with the up-keep of the baseball diamond. He won his first state tournament game last year. This is his last year to coach. His last chance for a title. &nbsp; And. On to the state tourney they go... &nbsp; In other news: I got another bat.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I am awesome. District softball game tonight.&nbsp; So.&nbsp; Excited. Not cute.&nbsp; Times infinity I win?&nbsp; ;)

      I'm a Chrisitian.  Just thought I'd reitterate that in case you're blind or... something.  I tend not to get offended easily, life has made me fairly tough.  However, recently something really got under my skin.  I'm just hanging around, doing nothing really, when a friend links me to one of her livejournal friends,  urlLink Ass_ .  You don't have to look at his writing, in fact I highly reccomend that you don't.  Save your website hits for someone who deserves them.  The conversation with my liberal friend went like this: Lib- "He's nice, you should read some of his stuff." Me-  "I have a problem with him.  I don't really care about what people have to say when they use the f-word and "Jesus Christ" in the same sentence."  Then I pointed that phrase out to her.  "Well I don't have a problem with it."  I just shut up.  I just dropped it.  ...  Now, if I were to say "F-ing Muhammed", I would get called a bigot.  If I were to say "F-ing Buddha," yes, you guessed it, bigot= The Kate.  Somehow it's only intolerant to say the F-word in context with another religious leader's name, but it's totally fine to bash Christianity.  I do understand that some people don't have this oral and mental error, but they are getting harder and harder to find.  Tolerance is "everything but Christianity."  Bigotry is when Christians, or conservatives in general really, are right.  Atheism is a religion.  The lack of a God is a God in itself.  You're living for something or you're dead.  The ACLU can shove it.  In taking religion out of everything you are, in a sense, endorsing a religion.  "Under God" is not shoving a religion down anyone's throat, it is in the pledge to set us apart from communists, who live in a godless society.  Once again.  The ACLU can just sit down, be quiet, and eat their cookies and drink their milk with Socialist Hillary.  I choose to live for something that will never die, never disappear.  Some people live for their families, for their jobs, for their spouses.  I'm not saying those aren't an important part of life, but when you make something your entire life and then it disappears, where do you go?  What do you turn to?  God created time, so I give my time to God.  It's really that simple.  It is to a man's glory to overlook an offence. Working on that... working on that...   Created on purpose, for a purpose.

      A tale of my mother and my father [when they still liked each other].  Once upon a time, in a land full of happy times, there was a town called Burkley.  In Burkley there is a town square with a restaurant, a barbar shop, a coffee shop, an antique store, a guitar store, an athletic shop, etc., etc.  Around noon one pretty day, Mrs. Facetious went out to lunch with several of her friends at the restaurant, which is near the barbar shop.  She parked her van outside and went inside to eat.  Half an hour later, Mr. Facetious stopped by the barbar to get his hair cut.  He parked his car out front and went inside to get his hair trimmed.  In the meantime, Mrs. Facetious has ended her meal and exited the restaurant, chatting with her friends while leaving.  She gets in the car and drives away.  Ten minutes later Mr. Facetious walks out of the barbar shop to find his car missing.  He calls the cops.  The cops arrive and question Mr. Facetious about the car and who might have stolen it.  "Who would want to steal a '98 Saturn manual car?" he thinks to himself.  Suddenly he realizes something. "Hey!  That's my van over there!"  The policeman leaves, though he is a bit worried about Mr. Facetious' mental state.  Mrs. Facetious has since stopped by the grocery store, picked up groceries and left.  On her way out of town she realizes that she is not in her van.  The two eventually make it home and swap stories, realizing what had happened and have a good chuckle at themselves.  The moral of the story: Don't eat lunch near a barbar shop.     In other news: -Is it just me or is it the fact that when the news says "The Johns" it makes me think of something.... else.... y'know?  o.O  -It is really hot in Iowa.  It is really humid in Iowa.  It is really summer in Iowa.  -Softball is almost over.  -My marathon is fast approaching.  -The tent only fits in the box once.  When you buy it.  -I can finally go back to church tomorrow.  See #3.  -I made a movie about peanut butter and jelly on my webcam today.  Yay for new toys.  Today's post is brought to you by the quote of the week, "To the max."  Tomorrow's post will most likely be religious.  Just a heads up.  --Out.

      I am a three sport athlete.  Cross country, track, and softball.  There are several things that being a team member require, and some points are often forgotten or overlooked because of people's own selfishness.   If you don't have leadership qualities, don't lead.  If you can't string words together into a sentence and make sense of it, let somebody who can do that DO THAT.  People who try to take charge who have no organizational skills or basic knowledge of the world, well, they suck.   If you have no idea what you're doing, don't tell other people what to do.  If you're not good at something, don't tell other people how to do it.  'Nuff said.   Be willing to sacrficice.  You have to be willing to give of yourself for the betterment of the team.  I know, I know, it sounds like Hillary.  If you want to get anywhere (this year's Lakers?), in a group or on your own, you've got to get over yourself.  :o  Wow.  Big moment there.   Don't cry every time you get yelled at.  Getting chewed out is a part of life, get used to it.  Do I enjoy it?  No.  I do not go looking for situations in which I might get chewed out. People who throw a fit every time someone has an ill-word toward them, or even just constructive critisism, are annoying and destructive.  Use your negative experiences to build you up, not tear you down.   Don't give yourself authority.  I hate, and I mean I  hate  when people who are my equals, my teammates, my peers, who have no leadership skills whatsoever, find room to chew me or one of my other teammates out.  Self-appointed leaders generally crash and burn, and crashing and burning is not pretty.  The peasants revolt and then, well, you know.   Get used to having people above you.  You can't be the best all the time [unless you're Cy Young or Michael Jordan or whoever].  There are people who have more skills than you or I, therefore, they are in charge!  Follow the leader, baby, follow the leader.   Love your teammates.  Bond.  Like the people you're around.  Make your talents work together to make something great.  Laugh.  Enjoy yourself.    I will close with a picture of me and our fine President:

      I'm a person who learns well from lists and statistics, it's just the way I am.  I don't need pictures or dancers or whatever.  Just give me the numbers, the rankings, etc., etc.  So for the last three days I've had a piece of paper in my desk titled "Life Goals."  Periodically I've gone and added to it, and for now, I think I have a pretty comprehensive list of my 15 year old "Life Goals."  Here it is.  (I'll link to some of this stuff when my IE stops commiting suicide, also known as Monday) These are in no specific order.  I put in bold the ones I felt like.     Life Goals   Drive a Porsche on the Autobahn  Perform at Carnegie hall  Record a C.D. Meet Jars of Clay  Get over myself  Visit all 50 states.  Build a great church [in San Fran]   Graduate from high school   Graduate from  urlLink CBC   Participate in the Iowa Girls State Track Meet each of my four years in high school Watch Jars of Clay live  Vote  Run for and win a public office Travel internationally  Run 100 marathons  Be a good wife and mother Register Republican Create a custom shoe  Hear one of my songs on the radio  Build a custom OC drum set  Live every day to its fullest  Complete  urlLink RAGBRAI   Figure out that it's not all about me   Be sure my friends and family will sleep in heaven  Learn to play the guitar Become financially secure  Love unconditionally  Live to see the Second Coming  Know what I'm talking about  Watch the St. Louis Cardinals win the Series  Climb Mt. Everest  Visit all seven continents Own a firearm and join the NRA  Be generous   Comprehend myself   Die      Now, some of these tie hand in hand (international traveling with autobahn and Everest, etc.), and some contradict each other (see the Second Coming and die).  Some are a work in progress (getting over myself, etc.).  Some are probably not going to happen (Everest), while some are going to happen within five years (RAGBRAI).  Yaylists.    I know you're amused.  In other news: Delayed steals can really start to hurt after a while. I bought a web cam.  Now to install... My butt really hurts (see #1). Ah.  Playing Varsity softball.  (see #s 1 and 3)   And with that, I have two more games tomorrow.  Grood day, evening, whatever.   It's five o'clock somewhere.

      First off, I'd like to wish a very merry birthday to the President of our great country, George Bush.  w00t.  Now, some people are spaztic because Kerry chose John Edwards as his running mate.  I personally think this was a bad idea for Kerry because he had to run against the man already, therefore blasting him.  Now he has to say... he lied about calling him immature?  Smooth one Johnn[y][ies].  Smooth one.  It could be worse.  You could have the governor of Iowa running with Kerry.  That would be a disaster.  Tom Vilsack is a scary leader, granted he was better than the Republican candidate, Doug Gross, the last election, however that doesn't change the fact that a monkey could do a better than him (which I know doesn't say much about Doug).  Tom decided to not expand onto a local [overcrowded] hospital, he decided to build a new casino instead.  Way to go, man!  His wife is annoying, she wears these big, ugly hats EVERYWHERE.  That probably explains why Theresa likes her so much.  He obviously hates the Bush tax cuts and wants to add more and more programs, thus wanting more and more of the people's money.  Shocker.  December 19, 1998 - If Iowa has the toughest meth laws in the Midwest, Vilsack said, the drug may become less accessible and more expensive. If fewer people can afford to buy the drug, Vilsack said, the demand could fall.  'Cause that makes so much sense.  Iowa has  urlLink a terrible time with meth , over 100 labs are busted every year.  Nice to see we have a good leader who knows what he's talking about.  And of course, he  urlLink doesn't   urlLink support  the  urlLink death penalty.   So even though Edwards sucks, it could be worse!  In other news:  Diet soda is death in a plastic bottle. It's really not about what you want, it's time to get out of the pool (or something). School of Rock is actually a decent movie.  Not.  Crazy.   And.  You know it's bad when  urlLink The Corn Cam  gets more hits than you do.  Sadness.  :(  ;)

        How To Get Rid Of A Bat    1.  Arrive home to an empty house with no lights on. 2.  Open door. 3.  Find a black squeaky thing flying around the kitchen. 4.  Figure out the black squeaky thing is a bat. 5.   Turn off fan.  6.  Get tupperware container, lid and flashlight. 7.  Attempt to get bat. 8.  End up chasing it into a small crack under the spinning cabinet. 9.   Get sunglasses.  10.  Poke bat out of crack with sunglasses. 11.  Watch bat flounder, bare teeth and squeak like a hamster on drugs. 12.  Bat crawls into another crack. 13.  Take out very heavy drawer. 14.  Find that the bat is under another layer of wood. 15.  Beat on wood with flashlight. 16.  Find that is not effective at all. 17.  Use tupperware lid to poke/drag bat out of the crack. 18.  After five minutes, the bat gives up and comes out. 19.  Watch bat bare little tiny teeth at you yet again. 20.  Carefully pin bat between container and lid. 21.  Throw bat outside (they can't take off from a sitting position). 22.  Come back in the house and let out a scream for good measure.  And now my friend, you know how to get rid of a bat. My Fourth of July certainly was entertaining.

      Weeeeeeell.  It's the Fourth of July.  Time for Iowans to blow off their illegal fireworks and drink large amounts of alcohol.  A scary yet amusing death-defying party if you will.  This year's July fouth is a little different for my family.  Last year my cousin Brian had just finished basic training in time to come to our party.  Now he is stationed in California, waiting to be shipped off to Iraq.  Am I resentful?  Not in the least.  People are required to make a military function properly, and the fact that one of my relatives is part of that makes me honored, not angry.  America is the best country in the world.  We are the richest nation. Both culturally and financially.  We haven't killed the Prime Minister of France yet. We have great self-control.  Our military might is unmatched.  We are still alive and well after September 11.  We have almost all of the world's climate zones except for tropical rain forest.  We provide an amazingly good life for the ordinary guy.  We offer more opportunity and social mobility than any other country, including those countries in Europe.  We have atained higher social equality than any other society.  People live longer, fuller lives in America.  We have the best baseball, American football and cycling anywhere.  Our young people are not handed their destiny, they are expected to create it for themselves.  We have gone further than anyone in establishing equal rights.  We have found a solution to the problem of religious and ethnic conflict that continues to divide and terrorize much of the world.  We have the kindest, gentlest foreign policy of any great power in world history.  We are the freest and the most virtuous nation on earth.    Aaaaaaand...   We have the coolest Secretary of State. Ever.

      Nothing to say about Swift Vets, John Kerry, President Bush, the U.N. or taxes today. Yes folks, for real.  Simmer down, simmer down.  So I'll just stick to  urlLink elephant pictures .  In other news: I am so sick of idiots.  And I'm not even in school right now. I had a nightmare about cross country last night.  I am so scared it's not funny.  Cheerleading, why must you  steal all of my teammates  forsake me.    [The  elephant  is cute] [ urlLink I am not ]    This was such a quality post.

      So I'm back.  Please control your  vomit  excitement.  The worst vacations make for the best stories, and believe me, I've had plenty of bad vacations. However.  This was a  good  great vacation.  I'm sorry?  Dinner with  urlLink Deb  and  urlLink Guy  was quite fun.  The first thing I heard when I walked through the door was, "Wow.  She really is too cute."  Gorgeous people, inside and out, great kids [ meow ], and yes Francis, I really did get the "taxes talk," much to my mother's... uhm... I'll call it pleasure.  Or something.  There was only one point in the conversation where I wanted to die, which is actually very good considering that the majority of conversations I want to die the entire time.  My mother brought up Michael Moore.  I just wanted to melt into a puddle and say, "Hi, I'm a puddle and therefore cannot in any way be related to this talking mass of flesh and bones to my left."  Chicago was... Chicago.  Being from the middle of nowhere, I'm amused easily, which means that I was practically in amusement-overdrive in the "big city."  Rode with some DNC people on a trolley, and be very proud that I didn't yell out "Bush is my homie!" or "Anybody want some waffles?!" or "How about them Swift Vets...".  Self-control.  Self-control.  Some Kerry- moron person was outside the Art Institute (which was very nice) and said, "Help put a Democrat in office, vote Kerry!"  I looked at her and said, "Uh.  No."  My mom said "No need to worry, I'm already voting for him."   Snarky.   Learned all about socialism by watching the local Public Television Station in the hotel room.  Those people really hate us.  North Korea has a  dead person  as their head of state.  Gee, that sounds like it'd work out great !   A ton of anti-Bush bumper stickers, with most of them referred to the Florida Fiasco.   Get over it, you whining  idiots  morons.   I saw a nun at the train station. Rode in a cab. Ate at White Hen. Poked myself in the eye [several times].  Was cute.    Speaking of cute. I tried to explain the whole "cute" situation to my mother, and she thinks I have self-esteem issues now.  Hahahanot.  Saw a pair of gigantic  elephants  at the Field Museum, and bought a little elephant at some small shop in some small town. I'm just elephanttastic.  I'll have to take a picture tomorrow.   I feel pretty craptacular after riding in the car all day. Blah. Grood night.  [I'ma get you,  urlLink Francis ]
