       Hey, now that's interesting. Just as i'm writing this stuff, trying various html stuff, a phone-call: Eldad, whom i filed as "Eldad Pink" in my cellphone. He called me from an ad that Hadar posted for me on the 'net. Pink, because he said he plays Pink Floyd-like music. We arranged an appointment. Wow, blog, my life is completely on the web. Kinda.

       Mid-nineties, particularly 1995 -- a very important period in the formation of my musical taste. Not decisive, but important. Some songs that i hated then, i came to love now. One of them is  urlLink Buffalo Tom 's "Summer". Rock, ya mama.

       Could it be? 
 I listened to the whole of  urlLink R.E.M.'s "Reveal" . It wasn't easy. I tried a few times before, but didn't succeed. I haven't decided yet if it simply sucks, or good but hard to get used to. I should keep in mind that "Automatic FTP" wasn't so easy for me to get used to either. 
 I'll take the raaaaaaaaaaaaain. The really good song here. But Beachball starts off with a pretty disgusting electrobeat. Then it becomes a faux-latin thing, that  urlLink Yo La Tengo  would do so much better. I should try some 80's R.E.M. 
 The reason i'm listening to it is that i'm home alone. Alone, that is at home with my parents and not with my sweetheart Hadar, with whom i spend almost all my weekends and holidays. On the rare occasions that it happens i am somewhat glad at first for the opportunity to spend some time alone listening to all those CD's i buy, and "scratching my balls", but soon realize how much i miss her. I swear to God (see  urlLink Gen 2:24 ) that i'm not getting this touchy-feely because she might read this.

       Watched  urlLink Matrix: Reloaded  (also  urlLink here ). To say the least, it is a worthy sequel. A (very) few scenes are too long, but overall -- the plot is interesting, the action is intense, the humor is kept at a reasonable level and there's a good balance between effects and philosophy. There are a few points in the plot i didn't completely understand, or maybe wasn't supposed to understand, but i don't wanna spoil it to anyone. 
 In the Rig Veda there isn't much philosophy. It is, however, a beautiful peace of religious poetry. I sat five hours in the university library today, trying to translate 4 verses (1.42.7-10). The only reasonable dictionary (Grassman's) translates to German, so i learnt more German than Sanskrit and eventually translated hardly three verses, but it was still very enjoyable.

       I love Joy Division. I bought Heart and Soul after watching the wonderful  urlLink "24 Hour Party People"  (also  urlLink here ) and hearing "Love Will Tear Us Apart", "Transmission" and "No Love Lost" (the last two i downloaded randomly on KaZaA). Now i'm listening to the great 4-CD set. Till now -- every song is a winner. I have a lot more listening to do, but those 27 pounds were definitely well spent.

        urlLink The Lemon: History Of The Internet  
 Linked from Slashdot. I usually don't even bother to click on their humor links, but this one is funny. 
 It mentions  urlLink zombo.com . Now -- i remember this word "zombocom" from somewhere, a movie or a cartoon ... i remember some monster or something saying "ZOMBOCOM!!!" with a scary voice. And i can't even look at this site, as it is probably slashdotted.

       Another suicide bombing in Jerusalem. 
 I'm somewhere between not being afraid of these poor murderous idiots and feeling glad for Hadar, who doesn't have to take a bus to the University. 
 On a happier note, Amazon.co.uk  "dispatched"  my order of  urlLink Joy Division's "Heart and Soul" . Those funny brits, why do they have to say "dispatched" instead of "shipped"?

       The experience with Eldad "Pink" Eshel was interesting. The bassist was obviously not so interested from the beginning and went home after an hour -- he is more interested in funk (like Jamiroquai) and Pink Floyd, but actual Pink Floyd, not what Eldad calls "Pink Floyd". Eldad -- and i'm not patronizing! -- has a lot to learn himself. He plays keyboards very well and he's incomparably better than me on the guitar, but his communication skills are less than average (which makes me wonder if  urlLink Scientology  could help him...) His songs probably sound very well in his head, but he has very hard time passing it on. His music is not Pink Floyd, it is close to Porcupine Tree at best. When he sang, we (me and the very nice drummer Uri) couldn't hear him, so we told him, so he sang again, and we told him we still couldn't hear him, he said: "But i shouted!" Well, he didn't. But nevermind. I don't want to get down on him, he has very good intentions, i wish him luck and i don't run away from him. 
 The most important thing about it all is that i finally entered a rehearsal room, payed and played. I really should do it with Amit and Tamir. And i should get back to Eran "Gitara" Shar'abi too.

       Yeah, that's some very erratic poetry/songs i tried to write when i was 17, my teenage blues. I found that notebook in 2001, edited it a little and locked it up again. Now i'm publishing it. Maybe i'll forget it for a few years more. Maybe Hadar will make me compose it and make into songs. Maybe it sucks.  urlLink Pitchfork  would most probably hate it, they're picky about lyrics.

       I really don't like mosquitoes. They disturb my sleep. If until now i used to enjoy dreams equally well in Russian, Hebrew and English, i now have to suffer  French-speaking nightmares (!!) , (no) thanks to these abominable creatures. 
 A propos French: yesterday, someone tried to download  urlLink Thurston Moore 's "Psychic Hearts" from me, all the files at the same time, which obviously didn't work for him, so, being nice and helpful as i am (ahhhh...) i explained how he should download it. And guess what, he said "i don't understand English. French, maybe?" He didn't know who's he dealing with. So here's what i told him, with accents left out intentionally, preserved for future generations, thanks to  urlLink babelfish : 
  je ne sais parler pas francais tres bien, mais j'essayerai: 
 si vous voulez telecharger toutes les chansons de Thurston Moore, telechargez-alors les un. Si vous les telechargez toutes dans le meme temps, cela ne fonctionnera pas. 
 si vous entrez dans le mode "a distance aligne" ("remotely queued"), ne rendez pas, attendez quelques minutes et cela fonctionnera a la fin 
 The bummer is that he disconnected right after that. Oh well.

       The wall clock is in the garbage now. The alarm clock still works. That they stopped on the same day is a curiosity. 
 I'm using the Hebrew phrase "ima shelkha zona" ("your mother is a whore") more and more lately. It's been waiting inside me to come out ever since i heard it used so effectively on the brilliant Chamber Quintet's "Watermelons" sketch (i won't get into details). 
 Here's an example:  urlLink Amir Peretz , ima shelkha zona! 
 It can make a good bumper sticker.

       A song, inspired by mindless strumming and some titles on the bookshelf at Hadar's place. The lyrics are supposed to be happy, but the sound is quite depressing and makes me think of it being performed by  urlLink Anathema . To be finished.

       So, there is a price for giving up my principles afterall. 
 I went to a shopping spree, i had to use my "sport coupons" somehow, bought a lot of shorts, t-shirts and even an elegant buttoned shirt. Some of them were  urlLink Speedo  branded, and apparently i was entitled to receive free Speedo sunglasses. 
 Fine, i will go with them. They are not very protecting, but they don't give me a headache and they are free. I give up.

       Radiohead's new "Hail to the Thief (The Gloaming)" is great great great great great. So fucking great. Rock and roll at its best. The best parts of OKC, Kid A and Amnesiac mixed together. Pianos, keyboards, guitars, drums and Tchocky. 
 I wonder who are all those nice people with Israeli names that Jonny Greenwood thanks -- Sharona, Tamir, Daniel, Yardena, Yair, Neta, Yotam, Tomer, Edo. Fans on the mailing list? Personal friends? (I heard a rumour that he has some relatives or friends in Israel.) Whatever. At least it's nice to know that not all antiglobalist  urlLink Indymedia  fans hate Israel (afterall, even  urlLink Israeli Indymedia  fans hate Israel ...)

       Sunglasses, the most useless invention ever. Useful only for making brand owners rich and making naïve people feel cool and/or protected. 
 Last Saturday Hadar talked me into buying a pair. Very cool-looking, Prince-branded, purple-tinted. I paid 340 NIS for them. The morning after i wore them and went out to work. In the few minutes that followed i avoided sunlight just like i did without them; the difference was that it gave me a horrible pain behind the ears, just like every other pair of sunglasses i ever tried (i don't care if it disappears after a few days, i didn't pay 340 NIS for pointless pain, even if it's temporary). We talked about it and Hadar said that i should keep the receipt, put the sunglasses back into their case, and return it to the store. She's so great. 
 The worst thing about this affair was giving up my principles, even though all the way i knew i was right. I should have stopped the shopping spree right there when i saw items sold for 59 NIS next to items of the same style and brand for 259 NIS. The clerk's explanation: "last year". A simple proof that sunglasses is  only  a matter of fashion -- not eye protection. 
 The  best  thing however, and the really important one is that we didn't fight about it. It's really amazing how we go on for almost a year and a half essentially without fighting. I love her.

       Here is a  urlLink chapter  from the  urlLink Christian Science  "bible". Go on, do it -- click and read it. 
 Of course you can say that Christian Science is just a silly and profoundly american cult, just like  urlLink Watchtower  or the  urlLink adventists . But try to read this chapter omitting direct references to Jesus (but not God). I'm not saying that this text is  true ; it  doesn't matter  if it is true or not; it is presented as a worthy challenge to the atheist science. Where would we be without challenges?

       Only about 40% of the people voted. No final results yet. I voted the first thing in the morning. I don't have big problems telling who i vote for in local elections -- for the mayor i voted for the Greens' Avi Binamo and for the council --  urlLink Shinui . I considered the Greens, but they didn't have a website and didn't even answer my email, so there -- they lost my vote. I don't know almost anything about the candidates in either list. I really hope Shinui pass the barrier, they should have ran together with the Greens. 
 As i write this, i realize why 60% of the Israelis find the elections so boring. It's still a shame, though.

       The flights were incredibly cheap -- 95NIS (1 person/1 way). Thank you,  urlLink Arkia . 
  urlLink Caesar  hotel is OK, not 5* and without the wonderful omelettes like in  urlLink Orchid , but who cares about the hotes,  when there is the sea, the desert, and the restaurants. 
 And the tax-less shopping -- i bought myself a  urlLink Hohner  chromonica ad i'm gonna learn it (420NIS),  urlLink Ray-Ban  sunglasses (450NIS, usually it's 900NIS, and strangely i don't hate myself for buying sunglasses...) and also Rockfour's "For Fans Only" and Led Zeppelin IV (it's about time). 
 Made a quad runner ("tractoron") trip in the desert. Expensive (150NIS) but fun. Now i want a motorbike. 
 Restaurants: 
 
 Eddie's Hideaway -- hidden in an actual Eilati neighbourhood, it is a real hideaway, worth seeking out! The food is mostly French, big selection of big steaks. When there, don't miss the appetizers. Great service. 
 Santa-Fe -- Mexican/(Native) American, whatever, very good. Bean soup, wonderful pork osso buco, amazing smoked chicken (a complete one), and Isla De Mujeres -- profiterolles with ice-cream and chocolate sauce. 
 
 On the last day we won another free weekend in Caesar. Thank you, God (and sorry about that osso buco).

       Weekend -- two films with Sam Rockwell, mostly memorable as the obnoxious Wild Bill in Green Mile. Both good. 
 First -- Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Howard Stern's Private Parts meets Beautiful Mind. I didn't know what it is about, which is good, that's how i love my movies -- surprising. 
 The second was  urlLink Matchstick Men  whichs was also a good surprise. A little more than an average Hollywood sympathetic con-artist movie. The welcome bonuses include the very charming Alison Lohman, and some great acting by Nicolas Cage, who takes a few hints from  urlLink Monk . Very much a Hollywood movie though, but good fun.

       More about my Italian studies -- and language studies in general. In some computer magazine (it was printed on paper!!!) i found a link (which i couldn't click!!! ok, 'nuff) to this site:  urlLink My Language Exchange . The article said that this site arranges (virtual) meetings between people who are interested to learn each other's languages. Well, i tried the search feature and when it immediately found a few people who are willing to teach me Welsh (!) in exchange for Russian, i was extremely happy. But there was a catch -- to initiate contact, one has to become a "gold member" which costs 12$/year. I couldn't stand the temptation, and i paid!!! Ya mama, i was so excited. I already spoke to a few Italians, and received great compliments, none of them could believe that i studied just two months (i blush). I hope they'll give me a discount for the membership for the next year for the great PR i'm doing for them... 
 This morning i went to the University, to sign up for the courses next year. I wanted to take Lithuanian and Slavonic, but they changed the hours since the last time i checked, so i can't take them both. Maybe i'll take Latin, or Catalan, or (as i hope) Latin and Lithuanian together.

       I've been bad, i haven't written anything here for a long time. So, what happened: 
 Italian course for beginners at the  urlLink Italian embassy  in Yaffo 
 The memorable points: 
 
 The teacher, whose name is Paola was very nice. 
 There were some obnoxious "ugly Israelis" who left after a few lessons. After that the course became considerably more enjoyable to attend. I don't know how did they get there in the first place. 
 The road to Yaffo through all those Southern Tel-Aviv streets -- Allenby, Aliya, Salame -- is very depressing. If i was Bill Gates, i'd start buying all those dumps and slums and rebuilding them. 
 Italian is easy and fun to learn, except all those pronouns before the verbs. So confusing. 
 
 A wonderful trip to Rome 
 A little short -- only 4 days, but wonderful. The weather was perfect. The flight was El-Al, so the meals and the movies were incomparably better than the crap on the charters. The Italians are nice people, but why did all those popes have to steal so much obelisks from Egypt?? 
 Although the food there is pretty good, there  is  good Italian food in Israel too. Anyway, the best meal of the trip was the one we had at Osteria Margutta (Via Margutta, near Piazza del Popolo). The runner up is Pasquino, near Piazza Navona. 
 One of the high points was  urlLink Enzimi  -- a  free  rock festival. We popped at it by a total coincidence when came out the  urlLink metro  at Termini. We were hungry, so we sat in a Tavola Calda nearby and heard a complete  urlLink Thrills  show which ended the second we stepped out of it. Nevermind, it was tasty and we discovered the wonderful  porcini  mushrooms. The next day we went to  see   urlLink Elbow , which was great + i got myself a t-shirt. We even caught them rehearsing earlier that day. Ya mama. 
 My mama rebuilds the house 
 Walls painted pink, green and yellow, with Greek paintings on the living room walls. So now the living room is Greek, the parents' room is American with paintings based on Henry Miller's books, and for my room she said she plans to make it "Chinese", but only when i marry Hadar and leave the nest (notice the  when , not  if ). 
 Now when she said  urlLink "chinese" , she apparently meant feng-shui. She surprised me by just doing it when i wasn't home for a few days. It included taking away the shelves and putting all my cd's in plastic bags, taking away my bed ("What's the difference? Sleep on the floor.") I was shocked. I hate surprises of this kind. 
 Now that the damage is done (and fixed) i admit that i'm obviously happy with the change. The carpet is gone too, which is a most welcome improvement. 
 My old bed is temporarily back, until the new one she ordered arrives ("God almighty, i shudder to think/my new bed is a sofa and it's coloured in pink"), but it's on the other side of the room, so the sunrise is right in my eyes and it literally wakes me. I wonder if it's a part of feng-shui too.

 הנושא: מצדה או מסדה? 
 כבוד השר, 
שלום רב 
כיצד יש לומר את שמו של אחד האתרים ההיסטוריים והתיירותיים החשובים ביותר בארץ-ישראל - מצדה או מסדה? Metzada או Massada? בפרסומים שונים, בעברית ובלועזית, מופיע השם בצורות שונות והדבר מבלבל אנשים רבים, ישראלים ותיירים כאחד. מן הראוי הוא שתהיה מדיניות אחידה בנושא - שהשם יופיע בצורה זהה בכל השלטים, הספרים, הנאומים, וכן - שכל מדריכי התיירים יתורגלו לומר אותו בצורה אחידה. ניתן לסמוך על האקדמיה ללשון להמליץ על הצורה המחייבת, ורק שתהיה ברורה ומוכרת לכל. 
 לטיפולך בנושא אודה, 
אמיר אהרוני.

       It is  urlLink  XHTML  1.1   now, although still not 100% valid, but again -- only blogger code is to blame. Mostly under-the-hood improvements. 
 
 Removed all style attributes into the &lt;style&gt; element. 
 Changed #xxxxxx color specs to rgb(x, x, x). 
 Removed unnecessary tables, &lt;br&gt;'s and nbsp's. 
 Layed the groundwork for transforming &lt;td&gt;'s into &lt;div&gt;'s 
 Hidden the mysterious &lt;hr&gt; at the bottom. 
 
 TODO: 
 
 Dump the utility &lt;hr&gt; completely. 
 Replace &lt;td&gt;'s with &lt;div&gt;'s and &lt;iframe&gt;'s. 
 More  CSS  cleanup. 
 Quit my job. 
 Find a way for a better main page display. It's not very good that the whole blog is displayed completely. 
 Permanent easy-to-access link to  urlLink nevIoth  and other friends. 
 Improve the color of hyperlinks (the hardest part).

       You really don't have to read this entry unless you are interested in XML and HTML. 
 Now i'm strict XHTML 1.0. Not yet 100% valid, but that's only because of the auto-generated blogger advertisement code. I complained to them about it. XML "validification" included: 
 
 Converting all tags to lowercase. 
 Closing unclosed tags like &lt;br/&gt;. 
 Dropping all &lt;font&gt; tags (thank God, finally). 
 Quoting all unquoted attributes' values. 
 Converting the deprecated &lt;td height&gt; and &lt;td bgcolor&gt; into style attributes. 
 Converting all &amp;'s in dynamic URL's into &amp;amp;'s. Apparently the links still work. 
 Also -- the dates are written on a little different background now. 
 
 TODO: CSS validification. Currently it is very messy. And also -- XHTML 1.1...

       On Wednesday i filed a request to check my resignation options. 
 On Thursday there was a team evening at Almog's place, which was surprisingly relaxing, considering that Rakhamim was there. Almog's mother is a classical pianist and she begged me to play something on her new 50,000 NIS  urlLink Kawai . I was terribly shy at first, for i am very far from being a classical pianist, and i see myself as a shitty amateur. I started with "Imagine", which proved as a winner and went on with "Avshalom", and surprised myself with how great it came out. She was so happy. She told that it's her dream to play pop-muzik and not classical. Chicks luv me. 
 At the end of the evening i decided to give Rakhamim another chance.

       I have a problem. 
 When i talk to an English-speaking person, and can't hear a word or a sentence he says, i ask him: "What?" 
 It's terribly impolite. It sounds very "Israeli". In English one should say "Excuse me?" or "I beg your pardon?..", even when talking to friends -- and i say "What?" when talking to people i don't know. Every time i do it, i regret it the moment after, but just can't rid myself of it. I should try to do better when i'm in London Town.

       I really don't like to write about my job in the blog, but the situation there gets  urlLink curiouser and curiouser . 
 I had a very hard talk with Rakhamim urlLink  1   today, vented a lot of frustration at him, and right in the middle Amir G. comes in, flashes a nasty grin at me, asks Rakhamim something unrelated, and he replies --  as if i'm not even there. I quietly pointed out to Amir G. urlLink  2   that i never interrupt his personal meetings, to which he replied: "You show too much  urlLink chutzpah  lately, and we should have a talk about that." Oh yeah, definitely, we really should talk about anything, you egocentric anti-communicative jerk of an "IT department manager". 
 Rakhamim came into my office later and said that he advises that i send Amir G. an apology letter. I guess it is a good idea ... for me to poop on. No chance of that happening, ever. 
 
   1   Rakhamim -- my boss. 
  2   Amir G. -- Rakhamim's boss. Bald.

       It might be  good that the wheel is in  urlLink Egged 's hands  TM , but their hands shouldn't touch any telephones. Their service is terrible. 
 Yesterday morning i forgot my bag in the  baggage  when i arrived from Jerusalem to T.A. I hated the bag and if it's gone forever i'll be glad, but inside it there were my  urlLink hardcover Cassel's Latin Dictionary  and  urlLink "Beginner's Lithuanian" by  Dambriūnas  et al. , both brand new and also my university notebook. Let alone the expensive books, i'm particularly sorry about the notebook, which is the best i ever had. So good that other female (!!) students asked for it, to photocopy the lessons they missed. That a female student should be able to even look inside my notebook without having to be hospitalized was unimaginable until recently, so i'll really miss it if it will be lost. 
 Anyway, Egged's handling of the case was disgusting, their service skills are appalling. I'm not giving up, but it's still a little depressing.

       Imagine that you enter a beautiful church in Italy. There's a fresco of some night scene (Jacob's dream? Jesus' birth?) On the fresco you see a night sky, some mountains and some clouds. All this is painted church-fresco-style. 
 That's what i see in my window right now. The best view ever. These clouds are fresco-style. I wish i could take a picture. Amazing. 
 The weatherpeople say that it is the official beginning of the winter. The first actual rain, not the pilot. It is beautiful.

       Told Mira stuff about Israel: about conversion to Judaism, Haredim and  urlLink Eliezer Ben-Yehuda . Successfully pointed her to  urlLink the Knesset site  with an  urlLink IP address  and taught her about ping and DNS on the way. 
 Then she introduced me to her friend Omatchi, an Emarati who speaks Italian and we had a little impromptu Italian chat.  Lui studia in  urlLink Università Americana John Cabot  a vicino di Via Trastevere, dieci minuti da Vaticano a piedi. C'è anche una fermata di ferrovia.  A nice coincidence -- yesterday i started the second part of my Italian course, again with Paola. I'm still better at writing than in talking. 
 I also learned something important about the Lithuanian language today -- that it is really hard! I ordered  urlLink Beginner's Lithuanian , which is supposed to be a revised version of the book  urlLink my professor  uses. 
 Yesterday evening on my way to Jerusalem i read the Latin textbook. It was the first time ever that i enjoyed homework and felt that i really should do it, the first time ever! It was worth it. Oh, the joys of Latin. 
 My crazy dream comes true -- i study three languages at a time and devote quite a lot of time to it! I might add Aramaic in the 2nd semester.

       Buying a digital camera is not easy. 
 There are too much specs, which soon left me caring mostly for mega-pixels and optical zoom and, to a lesser degree, for the type of batteries and storage. Viewfinder, manual aperture, bla-bla-bla, i don't have the attention, i give up. 
 There is a good helper site,  urlLink dpreview , but as i said, there are too much specs to choose from and it's not so clear where do the prices listed there come from. It is definite, however,  that the prices in Israel are droven up  wildly . Only a complete sucker will buy a camera in a retail store here; online stores and duty-free seem better, but: 
 
 The duty-free is a mystery, as their  urlLink website  is too terse and doesn't seem to be up-to-date  and  they don't give any "marketing information" (?!) on the phone, so there's no way to know if they have the brands i want. 
 Online stores seem to be rather cheap, but they ship after 21 days and i'm flying next Monday. 
 
 I will buy a camera eventually...

       El'ad went all the way to Eilat to get his passport. After being strung around by the  urlLink govt.  for a week -- will it or will not come in the mail? -- it finally came, so we are flying and it is final. 
 In the duty-free i'm planning to buy a digital camera --  urlLink Canon  A80 or maybe G3... I'm  accesorising  myself -- minidisc, discman, colour cellphone, Ray-Ban, Hohner, Latin Dictionary, good stuffs. In London i'm not planning to buy nothing but beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, whiskey and some very silly souvenir for Avital O. (he specifically asked for something  very  silly).

       Hello. I have a new cellphone. It's my fourth since 1997. It is made by a company that i have never heard of before --  urlLink Telit ; i got it because its ability to store 1500 phone numbers captured my attention. It also has an SMS quick-speller and a color display! Ya mama. I have a strange feeling that for the first time i got a cellphone a little before that model became completely obsolete. 
 The  urlLink website  says that the company is Italian, but the user's manual says that it's Korean. Whatever's the truth, it felt great when i saw that their download section was written in Italian and could read it. That's how bugs can sometimes make people happy.

       My lovely government builds a bunker for itself in Jerusalem. Apparently it is very big with miles and miles of tunnels with a center in the Government campus in Givat-Ram. The tunnels were shown on TV -- and if they were just a few inches wider, they could be used for a metropolitan underground. Above the ground a  urlLink light rail  is being built, because a committee found that building an underground would be too expensive. The solution -- build them both! The government of Israel, i love you so much.

       I swear i thought about it myself. Here is my theory about the "Baby Mozart"-tape industry: there is no copyright on classical music! It costs nothing to pay a very cheap orchestra to play it, put it on CD, publish a mocked-up "scientific study" that claims that babies that listen to Mozart grow up smarter -- kazoom,  the  urlLink guy 's a millionaire. I have an absolutely disgusting feeling that he is Jewish. Why Mozart? -- because he's the most famous classical composer and has the most pronouncable name. Imagine "Baby Musorgsky", "Baby Rimsky-Korsakov", "Baby Rakhmaninov" or "Baby Händel" -- it wouldn't sell. I should check if there other people who think like me.

       The "Cooking According to Your Blood Type" says that pork is bad for my bloodtype. Which seems to fit with my  urlLink former hypothesis . However it also says that i shouldn't eat caviar and almost any kind of cheese except goat and mozarella and as if that is not bad enough, then it discourages me and all of my O-blood-type mates to avoid durum wheat from which pasta is made. 
 No, thank you, this just can't be true.

        What it is : four audio CD's with live concerts, each corresponding to a studio album; one DVD with five clips; and a booklet with a long interview and quite a lot of photos; all in a nicely designed black box. Read the rest  urlLink here . It costs 209.90 NIS (46$) in  urlLink Musica Neto . 
  Why do i love it so much : mostly because of CD #2 -- Post live. I even feel a little ashamed to be so unoriginal, because hey -- Post is my favourite Björk studio album too and it was the only tour i experienced myself (twice). And yeah -- that's exactly the reason i love CD #2 is my favourite and also makes the whole box worth the money. Because it IS the best example of playing electronic music in a live setting, whether you call it Rock or not (i certainly do, even though Björk herself might not be so pleased with that.) And i swear it's more than nostalgia. 
 The brilliance of putting live drums, a sampler and an accordion on the same stage with a pretty minimalistic decoration -- but decoration nevertheless, really ties the concert together. In fact, i was a little disappointed when i read in the booklet that she chose the accordion because of budget issues -- the record company wouldn't let her drag a whole orchestra around the world back then, as she did on later tours, but in any case, the arrangements were mesmerizing, especially Anchor Song. It was  new music  being created, the wettest dream of any serious musician. It wasn't rock, it wasn't dance, it wasn't retro, and it was NOT some "fusion of it all", as the whole was so much greater than the sum of its parts. And although her concerts became larger and more spectacular on Homogenic and Vespertine tours, they were, ironically, somewhat less groundbreaking. 
 Which doesn't mean they weren't great. The tamer Homogenic songs (5 Years, All Neon Like, Immature) are more pleasing here than on the album and yet another rendition of Anchor Song, this time with strings, is also welcome. And it hurts to say that as good as it is, CD #4 is probably the weakest in the box as it doesn't add much to the studio album, except a little different performances of Frosti and Hidden Place and the non-album track Generous Palmstrtoke, but it certainly isn't worse than the studio version. 
 Which brings us to CD #1 -- the MTV Unplugged. While in the battle of the albums Post wins triumphantly over Debut, the live concerts is a much tougher strife. First of all, for the protocol: that Unplugged performance remains one of the greatest proofs that MTV actually mattered once as a cultural phenomenon -- and i swear again that it is not me getting all nostalgic for my teen-age years. Secondly, it was an amazing show. It didn't run around the world for months like the Post show, but it was so complicated (just check out One Day on the DVD urlLink  1  ) and, for that matter, so astonishingly well-produced and performed that it is easily one of the most important musical events of the twentieth century. To devise two such performances -- Unplugged and Post -- within two years, proves that God is good and generous. 
  Why the CD format shouldn't become obsolete : because. 
 
   1   Or better, get the complete show on DVD along with another nice MTV live performance.

       First, here's the email that i sent to  urlLink delaguarda@delaguarda.com . 
 
 Hola! 
 Last Saturday i experienced your wonderful show in Tel-Aviv Cinerama. I expected some "cool" "modern dance", acrobatic show, maybe something "Stomp"-style, but i got so much more!! It was such a complete mind-altering EXPERIENCE, it actually influenced my views about life - definitely for the better. Of all the modern artists who try to be trendy by mixing cultures and looking tribal and pagan you are easily the best and the most original! 
 As great as the rope parts where, i loved the Fiesta part most of all for the sheer simplicity of it - somehow i got a million times more excited there than on any party or disco ever before. I have never ever saw such wonderful and boundless love and fun developed within moments between total strangers coming from different sides of the world. 
 A million thank-you's, kisses and hugs to all De La Guarda staff and crew!!! 
 
 This cheesy-smartass email tells most of it, basically. I came with my silly oriental cap with hope that it will attract their attention and they'll pick me up in the air. They didn't pick me up, but i did attract their attention in the Fiesta part -- they took it off my head and put it on themselves, we danced, we hugged and kissed and had the best time of our lives. They are experiencing it every day and although i did it only once, i'll remember it for a very long time. 
 I hope that one day all parties will be at least as good as that Fiesta was.

       It's very sad, the state in which humanity is today. The moment i heard on GLZ news that "a few minutes ago a plane crashed into one of the Twin towers in New York City", i thought: "What day is it today? September 11th ... very soon it will be a memorable date." 
 Whether the Geneva accord is good or not, there's this issue of memory -- somehow i'm not sure that even the greatest supporters of the Oslo accord can remember the day it was signed. My bet -- as well as the Road Map ( urlLink come again? ), "the first of December" will be forgotten very soon. It's not a coincidence that the Geneva guys tried to organize that ceremony on the 4th of November -- of course, the day  urlLink Rabin  was killed seems more important to remember than the day he shook  urlLink Arafat 's hand. They failed to sign it then, so today they are trying another "easy date" ... Let's see if they succeed. I am putting a reminder for 01-DEC-2004 on my cell phone.

       OK, one of my favourite subjects: i hope there's someone here who understands Russian. Compare the sites of  urlLink the president of Bulgaria  and  urlLink the president of Ukraine . Which one do you understand better? 
 According to linguists, Ukrainian is supposed to be more closely related to Russian than Bulgarian -- both Russian and Ukrainian are Eastern-Slavonic, while Bulgarian is Southern-Slavonic. The closeness of languages is usually explained by grammar, and indeed, the Ukrainian grammar -- cases ( падежи ), word formation, verb tenses etc. -- is nearly identical to the Russian, while the Bulgarian is considedrably different -- the verb tenses are more archaic, and there are no cases at all. Despite that, when i read the Bulgarian text i understand it more easily than the Ukrainian (i am not fluent in either of these languages and i have never learnt any of them). How can it be explained? 
  In the Ukrainian alphabet there are letters which are not present in Russian, such as  ї, і, є ; in Bulgarian, however, there are no additional letters. I know how to pronounce the "strange" Ukrainian letters, but it seems to me that on some more subconscious level they interrupt my thought. 
 There seem to be more words in Bulgarian which are identical to Russian. Not similar -- 100% identical. Of course it can be proven only by a thourough philological-statistical analysis, but that's the feeling i get. The possible reason? Bulgarian is a direct descendant of Old Church Slavonic, in fact "Old Church Slavonic" is just a fancy name for "Old Bulgarian". Linguistically, Russian is  not  a descendant of Old Church Slavonic, but it was heavily influenced by it through, well, the church. Literary Ukrainian, however, is, at least in part, a fruit of political intervention that favoured non-Russian but rather Polish or dialectal Ukrainian forms. Bulgarians, who never had to prove their national identity and uniqueness to anyone, did not need such political adjustments to their language.  
 The observations above are not very scientific, i never studied the subject academically. These are just "hunches". I want to study the subject thouroughly some time in the future.

       Fooled ya -- no blood here. The stitches were painlessly removed from my gums on Sunday and the flesh is growing back steadily.

       Snap quietly and wreck all, 
But first let them know, 
You're just too nice, you won't just surprise, 
Scream in the lift so they don't hear, 
 Stand quietly as you reach your floor, 
Walk out, business as usual, 
Eat your lunch, pay and be happy, 
Then go back, snap and wreck all, 
 You screamed, they must know now, 
Though you hope they can't hear, 
Now it's the time to wreck all: 
The cupboards, the PC's, 
The flippers on the wall, 
 They they they know all, 
They've nothing to do, 
They are to blame when you 
Snap and wreck all, 
 You're in the middle, 
Not righteous, not evil, 
And they'll have no use for the flippers on the wall 
The moment you snap and then wreck, wreck, wreck them all.

       Strong feelings for the wrong reason, 
Wrong reactions to silly decisions, 
Silly musings on obvious subjects, 
Punish me, please, don't let it get worse, 
 I could come Sundays, but i come everyday 
I'm sad to admit i don't know the better way, 
Everyone does it, i'm not better of course, 
Punish me, please, don't let it get worse...

       M. Stipe and M. Mills of R.E.M. perform  urlLink Nightswimming  (48MB MPEG video). One of my favourite songs. 
 Just as i finished watching it for the first time, a guy named Eli called. He saw my ad at  urlLink Musicians  and offered me a job as a pianist in a cover band in the mega-fabulous  urlLink Herod's  hotel in Eilat. 4000 NIS after taxes + free accomodation. Not too much, but then it's fun. Makes you think...

       Random thoughts about my lost camera: 
  I don't know where i lost it. I know i had it in the bus and i  think  that i picked it up when i headed towards the exit, but then what? Maybe i forgot it on the seat. Maybe i put it aside when i sat down to pick the big yellow bag from the luggage compartment. Aside -- where? On the pavement or maybe inside the luggage compartment? If i put in the luggage, then it should have reached the airport or the C.B.S. in Jerusalem, but the airport security didn't hear anything about it and neither did  urlLink Egged . Maybe i forgot it on the pavement. Maybe i put it on the bench of the bus stop when i waited for Hadar, then when she arrived, i was so happy to see her, that i took the two bags and forgot the camera there on the bench. 
 Whoever found it -- what would he do? Does he understand anything about digital photography? Would he see that there are pictures inside it? That it belongs to an actual person, that may want the camera back and make a decent effort to find the owner? Or maybe he just saw something fancy and expensive, and sold it to cover his debts? 
 It is even possible that no-one actually found it -- if i left it on the pavement, a car could have ran over it and that's it. 
 The  urlLink Israeli Police  doesn't mean to do anything to find it; the whole lost and found department in the Police is not intended for finding lost things, but giving people documents that prove that the article was actually lost -- to give the insurance company. The policewoman to whom i spoke was surprised that when i told her that i want to leave them my phone number. What for?? 
 Now the more philosophical part: the same morning i lost it, i was very impolite to my mom, particularly when she asked me about the camera bag. She couldn't tell the difference between it and the discman bag. I was very  urlLink bad  and i'm genuinely sorry about it. I called her the next day and told her that i'm sorry, and she told me that she thinks that i'm crazy and then i told her that i lost the camera, which obviously made her sadder and more dedpressed than myself. Very awkward, but did i have a choice? 
 The general feeling is "What is wrong with me?" Is there something radical about myself that i should change? Or should i just be more careful and make a better effort not to lose expensive things? The modern world of 2004 -- the world of electronic gadgets and cool stylish and expensive stuff -- how we should cope with it? With care, insurance and protective bags -- or something more deeply moral? Afterall, we definitely don't  need  these things, and how happy they make us is a tough question; the possibility of loss is never treated in the advertising and the fancy websites. Hard, hard questions. It makes my poor head all squeamous.

       Very similar to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon -- the familiar themes of stubborn and idedalistic Chinese pride and very similar flying battles, but i enjoyed this movie much more. It is known to be somewhat more westernized, but i didn't notice how exactly; in that sense it was not very different from Crouching Tiger, except it was somewhat more stylish and post-modern. The main difference is that the plot and the message were a lot more clear. The message was very political and pragmatic, applicable in the political situation of today, although i don't know how exactly. Recommended.

        urlLink Blackfield  -- Aviv Geffen with Steven Wilson. When i first heard about it, i just couldn't believe that Steven was actually interested in Aviv's Isra-teen-Rock, but listening to these clips i realize that they sound good and that there's a good songwriter buried somewhere inside Aviv's gimmicks. The album is out soon, and there's a chance that i'll buy it. 
 
 
 
  urlLink The Dub Side of the Moon  -- The name says it all, it's a reggae version of Pink Floyd's Dark Side. It's not the first attempt to do this, i know that there's a trance version and a novelty version (although i didn't hear them), but this one sounds dead serious. First of all, there seems to be a very serious reworking of On the Run, and it sounds as it should have sounded in the first place -- futuristic (that is, it would be futuristic in 1973). Pink Floyd's musings with the famous VCS3 in 1973 were actually not as interesting as King Crimson's and this jungle version of the "song" really makes it up. Hell, i would do it one day, but now i don't need to. The sax solo in Money rivals the original! There's a fat chance that i'll buy it.

       Mom -- two  urlLink Kenvelo  shirts. They are very good, actually, but it's pretty much the same thing she gives me every year. Oh well. 
 Dad -- deodorant,  urlLink shaving gel , umbrella. They are very good, actually, but it's pretty much the same thing he gives me every year, except the umbrella. Oh well. 
 Hadar -- a great  urlLink backpack , inside which i found a  urlLink kinder surprise  egg,  urlLink Depeche Mode's "Exciter"  urlLink  1  ,  urlLink Return of the King Soundtrack , a little buddha mascot, a  urlLink pen , and a lot of greeting cards.

 Sunday 28-DEC-2003 
 Bringing the stuff for the trip from all over the country -- Petakh-Tikva, Nesher, Jerusalem -- to the office in The Big City. My planning was mostly bad. I'm too used to public transportation and i often imagine that i can be in all those places at once. I must settle. 
 In the evening i went home to Nesher -- i forgot my fancy brown coat, which i thought was in Petakh-Tikva and obviously i forgot my cash $$$ with which i planned to buy the camera in the duty-free (almost ruined my own dream). After just one hour at home i was already back on the train to Tel-Aviv, finally packed the bag,  then El'ad picked me up and we went to sleep at his place. I got very little sleep, 'cuz most of the time i had nightmares about forgetting stuff, especially the battery charger, which is essential for the camera, even though i still didn't have a camera! Oh, mercy. At 3:00 AM we headed to the airport. 
 In the duty-free i rather quickly got  urlLink FujiFilm FinePix S304  (a.k.a.  urlLink 3800 ) even though it didn't appear in the clever comparison lists i prepared (actually it did, as 3800, but then i didn't know they're the same). The price seemed good -- 370$, i didn't sleep so well, so i just paid. Later i found out the price was indeed cheap, at least in comparison to Israeli retail stores (but that's not a big surprise). El'ad also bought a pair of shoes, both of us got a lot of chocolate, i got Martini and Bärenjäger and El'ad got Drambuie and a bottle of Bailey's for his friend. More on that later. 
 The flight was quite horrible, one of the worst i ever had. That company,  urlLink Monarch , might be even worse than  urlLink Aeroflot  and  urlLink Arkia  combined. The seats had zero legroom, the crew wore ridiculous hats, the meals were crappy and vegan (and i do believe that vegan meals  can  be good!), there was no movie, and the only Hebrew translation they bothered to do was of the security video. For that price i would expect more. But nevermind, as all that brings us to .... 
 Monday 29-DEC-2003 
 The lines at Gatwick passport control were a little long, but it was there that i first encountered the funny and wordy and very English signs, the kind of which i would later see a lot more throughout the city: "Staff harassment notice" and "If you would like to file for political refuge in the UK, please do so as quickly as possible". I don't quote them precisely as they were, but you get the general concept. 
 The bus from Gatwick to the hotel was not a very good idea, as there was bad traffic on the M25 (which is, roughly, London's  periferique ). The views on the road weren't too picturesque, either. We should've taken the  urlLink Gatwick Express , which costs pretty much the same; the saddest part is that the hotel is just a 2-minute walk from Victoria Station at which the GS arrives. More on Victoria station: there are no trashbins -- later we found out that they removed them for security reasons; and we also bought weekly tube passes for £19.60 each and no photograph was required! 
 Here our trouble almost ended. One last very minor problem -- we arrived at the hotel at 13:00, but the check-in there starts at 14:00. So we quietly left the bags and went out to eat at a very special and fabulous restaurant called " urlLink Garfunkel's ". It took us quite a lot of minutes to realize that Garfunkel's is a chain and that almost all restaurants in London look pretty much the same. But we had a very tasty  urlLink burger  nevertheless. That was also my first English language adventure -- i ordered "Classic Hamburger" and the waiter obviously called it "Yeah, a Classic Burger, and  (turning to El'ad)  for you, sir?" I actually thought that being a Briton he would say " Yes , a Classic  Ham burger." Maybe, like the majority of restaurant employees, he's an immigrant; but then he must be an immigrant from the USA, which doesn't make too much sense. 
 In any case, that meal was fine, and the hotel was even better. It was the  urlLink Victoria Park Plaza , comfortable, clean, polite and well equipped with a bath-robe, an iron and even an umbrella. The only letdown was the fully automatic minibar which charges £2 the moment you take a (very small) bottle of Coke. So we just didn't touch it. I immediately started jumping on the bed of which El'ad made a very touching short movie "Aharoni - Why Are You Jumping on the Bed?", which will almost surely get a Volgin prize. 
 In the evening we went for a stroll at the Piccadilly Circus, and i got pictured with the famous Bishop Line (22, Desmond Tutu -- get it??) and then a little Oxford Street and Soho. Other comments: 
  There's really nothing special about the large CD stores -- HMV, Virgin and Tower. None of them carry  urlLink Yo La Tengo ! Crap. 
 The pizza at  urlLink Pizza Express  is decent. 
 That draught  urlLink Guinness  in an actual English pub is nothing short of exceptional, albeit not very different from the one at Mike's Place. The main difference is the technique of pouring which looks more professional in England.  
 Tuesday 30-DEC-2003 
 Off to Big-Ben, that is, the parliament. I, personally, really liked the Victoria tower, the one that doesn't have a clock, but is thicker and even more beuatiful than the one that does. Then the horse guard changing, a hot soup at Benjy's, then --  urlLink the Cabinet War Rooms . It was El'ad's idea to go and see them, and it was a good idea (despite the long line). The best part about British Museums are the tour guides -- in this one there were an actor and an actress, playing an officer and a secretary, respectively. You can see their  urlLink pictures  on the aforementioned website. They actually dress and act as if it were the forties now, with old stockings, hairnets, cigarettes, accents and everything. I really enjoyed it. Supper at the  urlLink Spaghetti House . 
 We spent the late night at  urlLink Ronnie Scott's . When we arrived, the literally  urlLink big black  guard said something in a very English English, so i immediately said "What?" to which he replied: " Pardon!  When you couldn't hear something that someone said, the word is 
'pardon', the RIGHT, NICE word is 'PARDON!' Be nice!" It was a little scary and i didn't know where to bury myself. What he meant to say in the first place that there were no seats remaining, and that we can enter, but would have to wait to be seated, to which we agreed. It cost us £20 each (ugh!) but it was worth it. The show inside was already on the way, it was George Melly -- an old, fat and ugly dude with an eyepatch, that also happened to be a fabulous old school jazz singer. As almost all jazz concerts' reviews are exactly the same anyway, i don't have much more to say about the show, except that i hope that that concept will never change, and people from all walks of life will be able to come and see a good old jazz show any day, ever. Just about the time George Melly finished, we were finally seated and enjoyed a burger, as the next singer -- the stylish Italian  urlLink Ray Gelato  came on stage. The hits included "Pizza You" and a swinging rendition of "Volare". Very Italian and very swinging. The website tells the rest. 
 Wednesday 31-DEC-2003 
 The classic London tourist trap -- the  urlLink Tower of London . As with the War Rooms, the best part of the attraction are the Yeoman Warders, a.k.a Beefeaters. In case you haven't been there -- they really are very friendly, will happily answer any question, and volunteer to be photographed with silly tourists, like Amir Aharoni, for example. Or Keito Nakamura. Or Yoshimi Akagawa.  urlLink Arigatō !! 
 Dinner at  urlLink SOba  -- a modest and very tasty Japanese place. A little similar to Zozobra, but smaller, less high-techy, and no sushi. Plus, for some strange reason they don't have soy sauce in any their meals, but they do have a lot of "black bean". Maybe it's because they're British. They also have wonderful freshly-squeezed apple juice. 
 The New Year Night 
 The Trafalgar Sq./Parliament area was closed to traffic to facilitate a lot of celebrating people, many of them drunk. We watched the Big-Ben strike 12:00, almost lost each other in the crowd and headed for the Underground, as we planned to go nightclubbing. That proved to be very hard, as the demand for it was high. Also, both of us wanted to pee, because we had some beer before the midnight, so we tried to make our way into the toilets of some Scottish restaurant called " urlLink McDonald's ", and despite the very long line we decided to wait there; i was photographed waiting in that line. That's something to remember. Even worse -- although i promised myself and everyone that i won't eat any McDonald's junk in London (or anywhere), we were both hungry, so we bought ourselves  urlLink quarter-pounders  (with no cheese). 
 When we eventually made it to  urlLink the tube , we almost gave up and went back to the hotel, but eventually managed not to fall asleep and reached Shepherd's Bush, where we found what we were looking for:  urlLink Ginglik , a real London night club, not a tourist trap! Ya mama. After having our ID's checked, we signed up as members, paid £5 each and began the party of our lifetime, danicing like no-one was watching. A live latin band, good drinks, wonderful vibe, yound ladies of all races and clean toilets -- what more a clubber would ask for? El'ad was offered a joint by a lovely Irish girl whom for the sake of privacy i shall call R., but politely refused and settled for her home phone number in  urlLink Baile Atha Cliath . A cool, unshaved and dressed-up-like-a-hobo guy approached me, asked me where i'm from and when i told him that i'm Israeli he told: "Oh! there's very interesting music in Israel! Do you know the musician who's name is Avishai Cohen?" That was a nice surprise, so i told him about two jazz musicians called Avishai Cohen, the bassist and the trumpeter (that's an interesting curiosity). Later we both took the same tube train and then i also found out that he's Afghan, he left his homeland when the Russian invasion started, and that his girlfriend, whom he loves a lot, is far away -- which made me very homesick, but still couldn't spoil the fun. 
 Thursday 01-JAN-2004 
 Woke up late. Went to the  urlLink Science Museum . It's very impressive, although it's probably much more interesting for the kids. We watched an IMAX movie, and it was the first time i actually enjoyed a 3D movie like it is supposed to be enjoyed. The movie was "Bugs", a good old-style british nature flick about mantises, butterflies and other small inhabitants of rainforests. The experience is indeed intense, and besides, when i see those earth/ecology/nature stuff i get all touchy-feely, so i cried like a baby at a certain point when the planet Earth appeared 3 cm from my nose. Then we went to the exclusive  urlLink Lord of the Rings exhibition . That took up the larger part of the day. 
 In the evening we simply went to the pub near the hotel. I got drunk like an idiot from two pints ( urlLink Theakston  and Guinness), a gin 'n tonic and a whiskey. There was nothing to eat in the area, so it got even worse, that is -- very funny. We finally found a Pakistani who sold us a Lamb Kebab, which was very hot, so we had to run to the hotel to drink something. El'ad filmed me drinking water in the hotel's bathroom for two wonderful short movies -- "Aharoni - the Drunken Truth, parts I and II". 
 Friday 02-JAN-2004 
 We devoted the morning to some art -- the  urlLink Tate Modern  gallery. Elad liked a painting called " Höhere Wesen befahlen rechte obere Ecke schwarz malen  (Higher beings order: paint the top right-hand corner black)" by the German artist  urlLink Sigmar Polke  and i had my picture taken lying on the floor underneath Olafur Eliasson's sun. I also found an excellent exhibition of early communnist-era propaganda posters in various languages and alphabets; Stalin, whom many of these posters glorify, killed  most of them in the thirties and replaced them with a modified Cyrillic script. I should do a research project about that. 
 Then we went to the ultimate London tourist trap --  urlLink Madame Tussaud's . Ordering the tickets saved us from the queue, but it did cost considerably more -- not only there's a commission charge,  urlLink Isracard  fucks everyone who doesn't pay in US$. We paid as if £1 cost more than 8 NIS, although it is actually 7.8 NIS. Bloody goniffs. 
 Anyway,  i enjoyed the experience -- the paparazzi at the entrance, the breathing Britney, the very small Tom Cruise and Geri Halliwell, Patrick Stewart etc. The only wax figure El'ad liked was  urlLink Abu-Amar ; it was also the only place where he wanted to be photographed and the only place in the whole museum that he enjoyed. I also enjoyed the planetarium very much, even though they almost ruined it with  urlLink the Treasure Planet  characters; El'ad hated it. Supper at Zizzy, an Italian place that felt as if it was in Tel-Aviv. 
 In the evening i convinced El'ad to go and see  urlLink The Return of the King  in  urlLink Odeon  cinema on Leicester Sq.; El'ad claims that to the best of his knowledge it is the biggest movie theatre in Europe. When we stood in the line to buy the tickets, some brit bloke shouted from behind: "I've seen it, it's crap! They all die in the end!" The tickets cost £10.50 each. A lot. But it really is a big movie theatre, so there. The movie -- pretty good. Watching it was a very post-modern experience, as i was more interested in the way they made it than in the plot, which i already knew anyway (i read the book, ha-ha.) 
 The movie was long, but El'ad was hungry for more nightclubbing! Ya mama. So we headed to the famous  urlLink Mean Fiddler  club. There was no live show, but rater a pretty standard alt-rock party, the kind of which you can find in Tel-Aviv and Haifa (the whole place really reminded me of the  urlLink City Hall club  in Haifa). The playlist was even more tame than it would be on such a party in Israel, most of the songs played there were MTV hits. But it was fun nevertheless, and besides it's good to know that the nightlife in Israel is not so far behind the world. And even ahead of it. Ya mama. El'ad got a little drunk (Guinness, Smirnoff Ice and some more stuff which i can't recall now). The Smirnoff Ice bottles were plastic. Those Brits are so careful not to hurt anyone. 
 Saturday 03-JAN-2003 
 Our last day in the wonderful city. Most of it was devoted to Camden Town market. It is just so big. It never ends. You think that it ends at the end of the street and then you discover that the street suddenly goes right and there are more stores. And then it goes left and there are some more stores. And so on. One shouldn't come with a lot of money, because as long as one has something left in his pockets, it's impossible not to buy something. Hats, toys, souvenirs, army uniforms from all over the world, records, grass smoking accessories, art, food and much more. We had a cheap and tasty Indian dinner, bought some souvenirs and headed back to the hotel, spent the last money and minutes on beer and caught the bus to the airport. 
 The duty-free in Gatwick is pretty good, actually, but there's one thing to watch for: the lovely bears at the  urlLink Harrods  branch there cost twice as much as the same models in another duty-free toy store just next to it. Be careful. The alcohol is cheap, so i got a bottle of  urlLink Beefeater gin  and a bottle of  urlLink Bacardi Carta Blanca . The flight home was even worse than the flight to London,  but after such a wonderful trip, who cares. 
 The Morning After 
 We took a taxi to El'ad's home and when we arrived, took the bags and started walking to the house, the handle pf the duty-free cardboard box with all the  urlLink boxes of chocolates  and the alcohol torn apart, the box fell on the asphalt and the Bailey's bottle was broken. We ran to the apartment, threw our coats and bags and began washing the Toblerone's and the good bottles. When we were done and wanted to sit and cool off, i noticed that i threw my black Polgat coat on El'ad's shabbat-oven which was working and the coat was roasted and essentially ruined. After cursing the crap out of the whole shitty situation we turned on the TV and heard about the plane-crash in Egypt and understood that there are worse news than ruined coats and broken bottles and that we should feel happy that we landed safely. Since the my mom unbelievably skillfully fixed the coat and El'ad thinks of suing the duty-free for bad packaging. Not everything is so bad. 
 Other comments 
  The buskers in London are the best. Paris is second and Rome is worst. The secret is that busking in London is not just illegal, and that's it; you can busk if you pass an  urlLink audition  and get a license! It made me want to live in London at least for a few months. Amazing. 
 The prices of internet cafe's change wildly during the day and i still didn't get how and why. It ranges from about £0.60 to £1.60. Probably peak hours play some part. Moreover, we didn't find one where we could save pics from the camera, but then -- we didn't bother to look so well. 
 
 More details might follow as i remember them. El'ad, you're welcome to send corrections and additions. Everyone else -- thank you very much for reading.

       Lydia Lunch interviews Thurston Moore  urlLink here , along with some very beautiful paintings. A very interesting interview, i didn't imagine that we think so much alike about music and art. Selected Thurston's quote: "I want to write a song, record it, and throw it out for download. Do that for a half-year, and then compile it for the CD buyers." A must-read.

       I placed an order for El-Al flight to L.A. on 26-APR, right on the Independence Day. You decide which is better -- partying or going to the airport. Good hours -- takeoff @ 1:00am, landing @ 10:45am. Now i need to get a visa (a separate story), rent a car, and find something to do there, besides letting  urlLink Black Francis  damage my ears.

 My Lithuanian teacher, Prof. Lea Sawicki told us a story about her meeting with William Schmalstieg, one of the co-authors of "Beginner's Lithuanian". "You see," she said, "He's German, but he prefers to be considered American, so he calls himself William instead of Wilhelm and often spells his last name Smallstig. When i met him a few years ago, he told me: 'You can call me Bill, unless it hurts your Eastern-European dignity.' He was really very nice." 
 I just love this story.

       My renewed gusGus obsession brings about these thoughts: I own more than 300 CD's. Not all of them are favorites, some of them are almost never played. Among the ultimate favorites almost all were bought back in the time didn't have so much money to spend and usually had to beg my dad to buy them for me.  urlLink Post ,  urlLink In a Bar Under the Sea ,  urlLink Noise Only Noise. N. ,  urlLink Nearly God , and even much-hated  urlLink Pablo Honey  -- i know every single note on those records. It puts me in a very philosophical mood. I can draw some very depressing conclusions -- for example, that rock was really never supposed to be enjoyed by adults and that one day i'll stop enjoying it myself and also that having the means to buy music kills the anticipation and the excitement. I can also draw optimistic conclusions -- that this all is only a preparation to something bigger. 
 To sum it up, take  urlLink Vespertine : it is truly a great album -- revelatory, innovative, beautifully written and performed, not overproduced. Add to that the fact that i am a huge fan of Björk. Then why have i listened to it not more than maybe 15 times, while i listened to Post probably more than 150? I can only hope that somewhere in the world there's a 16-year-old kid that has the same passionate feelings for Vespertine that i have for Post. 
 I should offer myself as a subject of study to a Musicology student.

 I talked to Hadar on the phone yesterday, and we had nothing interesting to say, so she told me to just babble some crap. So i opened the "Good Vintage" (" urlLink Batzir Tov ") lyric sheet and read her Yona Wallach's "Kol Neshifa". Hadar was pleasantly surprised, and so was i. Reading poetry aloud is fun. Later in the day i read her some more Yona Wallach's and also the first verse of "Eugene Onegin" (the whole of which i should read myself already!) Today i read her  urlLink Shalom Gad 's "Yibane Hamikdash". It seemed fitting -- it talks about building a home, a temple (mikdash) of love by a couple, using manual labor and some funding help from the bank. Equally realistic and poetic. 
 Now if i could write some decent poetry it would be really great...

          Nothing reminds me of my teenage blues as well as  urlLink gusGus ' "Polydistortion". 
   Oh . When i think of Polydistortion, i think of being seventeen. Being deep in love with a girl that hated me (and very depressed about that), starting to understand that life is harder than i ever expected ... and having very few CD's. With the little money i had i didn't buy East 17, Metallica and Tupac like everyone i knew, but Bjork, Tricky, dEUS, Sonic Youth and gusGus. The soundtrack of losing innocence really. Nothing better to say about that than  "Oh..."  
  Gun . Back in 1997 i used to be very miserable and disaffected and for me Polydistortion was a wonderful soundtrack for almost killing myself. I really thank God (and Beck) that i didn't. I thank God that i blew my mind with gusGus' music and not my head. How can music be so depressing and so uplifting at the same time is a mystery which can probably be understood only by Icelanders, but luckily it can be enjoyed by anyone. Oh + Gun = one of the best openings for an album, ever. 
  Believe .  On the water we talk se-ri-ous-ly . Yep, it seems that for an Icelander, nothing is easier and more natural than having a serious conversation with Jesus while walking on water. Whatever is the message of that song, it is encapsulated so well, that "Laconic" is not the word. Even "Effective/Passive/Aggressive" is far from describing it right. 
  Polyesterday .  They tried to rape her, she couldn't reach higher . With gusGus, it all comes back to the sheer simplicity -- the simpler the song is, the better. Sparse and minimal is the formula for genius. These songs aim straight at the heart and they hit perfectly. 
  Barry . It is a song about love. Homosexual, probably. Or maybe i didn't get it right at all. What i am sure of is that it is a song about someone who is very unlike me, at least on the outside. Or vice versa. 
  Cold Breath '79 . This song, along with Barry, is the one that i find hardest to identify with on Polydistortion, which doesn't mean that i don't love immensely. I'm a guy and Cold Breath has something inherently female in it; some things we just don't understand. 
  Why?  Everyone likes this one. I don't know why, no pun intended. It's one of the tracks i like least; the context makes it loveable, though. The best thing about "Why?" is the  "Longing for you baby, mm-mm-mm"  line, which can't leave anyone indifferent. 
  Remembrance . It's a little too long, but one just needs to find a good time to listen to the album. Probably the saddest song i know. And it's nasty. So nasty. It is in the feeling -- i have very little idea what the lyrics are about. 
  Is Jesus Your Pal?  Oh, the heavy cultural burden: i was born Jewish, and this deprives me of the possibility of being pals with Jesus. The good thing about it is that i don't need to  call out his name when my conscious is shivering . Something taught me that coping with it by myself is the right way; maybe it was my culture and maybe it was this beatiful song. 
  Purple . One of the best and the most outstanding tracks on the album. The artists are not ashamed for a second to put a happy major-scale trance tune at the end of one of the saddest albums ever. Whatever were the reasons to putting it there, the result is so wonderful, that this song changed me -- suddenly i moved from hating trance into respecting it, along with absolutely any other kind of music. Up to that time i was solely a rocker; "Purple" triumphantly broke that. 
  Polybackwards . The little hidden track that could. Nothing but weird synths with no melody or beat, but who needs them? It made me feel good about buying an electronic album - "ha-ha-ha, i'm listening to super-cool arty music, it's not just trance." How innocent was i.

       Played with Miron and Eran yesterday. We worked on only one song, Eran's "Am". A few months have passed since the last time we played together; in themeantime he has written good lyrics and gave the song some structure. The problem is the balance between the instruments -- my piano is way too dominant, and Miron's guitar lines are too sparse. And there are no drums. Miron has a kit, maybe i'll try to learn it? There's also a major problem with Eran -- he's a genuinely good songwriter, but has bad timing; he just couldn't manage recording his guitar over a recording of piano and elc. guitar that Miron prepared. Completely out of beat. I'm sure we'll get over it. 
 Miron is great songwriter too. Every time he plays us some of his demos, of which he's unrightly ashamed, but i'm constantly stunned. It will be very bad if they don't develop into complete recorded songs. He's gotta get an album out, to paraphrase Waters.

       Words are dangerous. They are bad. They can hurt. But if we didn't have them, it would be harder to express ourselves. Maybe understanding this can help understand the music of  urlLink Stina Nordenstam . 
 Music, yes, i wanted to write "art", but then i affirmed to myself that she is a musician. One can have doubts about Jennifer Lopez -- whether she's an actress or a singer, or a dancer, or maybe she would be most properly called a model. But even i can't escape thinking "that singer", when i hear "Jennifer Lopez". Maybe because i could never force myself to see any of her movies and i couldn't care less about her dancing, but i can't escape hearing her on the radio. Now Stina -- a photographer, a poet, a performance artist? Or a musician afterall? Or a singer? And what's the difference? 
 Question is, how can i even consider her a performance artist if she never performs? Does her image become so alive through her music and interviews that it feels like a performance? Or is it her personal style in liner notes text? Is music so powerful that it eventually prevails over all other forms of art and expression? Given so many hard questions, let's just call Stina's output "music". 
 She definitely is a songwriter, and there's no doubt about that. I finally received her "Dynamite" album on CD. Expensive -- the cheapest option was to order it from the CQD site for €20.80. I was afraid that i'll hate it, like many critics. I also have to admit that the mp3's i downloaded once were not very convincing either. But i'm a completist, so i crossed my fingers and hoped that in headphones it will sound better (bla bla, i'm just an irresponsible completist). 
 So, what is it? It was described by many -- stark, dark, industrial, impenetrable, electronic. To me it sounds in the same vein as Björk's "Homogenic", arrangements-wise. Unwelcoming beats and over-distorted guitars and beautiful, classic and mature strings. This is Stina's Electr-O-Pura -- not her best album, not perfect, but the most consistent. This rare case of non-boring uniformity! Better than Homogenic, actually (and not only in that sense). And it's also terribly ugly. 
 Ugly, yes, and  almost  unlistenable. These wonderfully written songs seem to deserve a chamber-pop arrangement, which would be very easily (easily?) created by some  urlLink Godrich  or  urlLink Fridmann . And that could make Dynamite not  almost , but  completely  unlistenable -- "What, yet another  urlLink Mazzy Star ? Oh, spare me". Well, maybe i'm exaggerating, but the main point is: whether or not she is aware of it, Stina's art is making the listener think and concentrate on the content using impenetrable and unfitting arrangements. At that she is the champion. If the listener is worthy of the challenge, he can make up his own arrangements that he finds fitting, but that is only secondary. The message of words and melody, enveloped in very bad packaging, but it is only the addresee that can really damage it. 
 Journalists, reviewers --  they often very easily interpret these personal messages about hardships of the singer-songwriter's life, the pain of writing and releasing the album, etc. Usually i don't get it, and don't care about it, but few album openers could be as striking as: 
 Under your command 
did I not do well 
Was not my record fine 
 Your record was horrible, Stina. If you do yet another "Little Star", i swear i'll shred all your expensive and hard-to-get CD's. Well, i don't know if i'll really have the guts, but Stina does need guts to  not  release fifteen more CD's full of  Little Star 's and  Another Story Girl 's that will sell millions and make everyone sick. Her next album will tell, but i believe that she has that grit, just as i believe that bringing Suede's Brett Anderson for guest appearance on "This is" was not a publicity stint, but a sincere artistic collaboration of a rare kind. 
 Nordenstam is a singular talent. Any comparison -- to Björk, Rickie Lee Jones, Tori Amos -- won't do her justice, because she takes self-deprecation to the farthest extremes and with the greatest success. And Dynamite is that album about which i can boldly tell any critic -- You don't like it? You don't know crap and i couldn't care less. 
 P.S. A few days ago i received a phone call on my cellular. Caller-id was very unusual -- eight digits, most of them were zeroes. The caller asked in English with a strange accent: "Is this Ah-meer Ah-haroh-ni?" I immediately thought that it's someone from the work playing a joke at me, but the voice insisted: "Is this Amir Aharoni? May i speak to Amir Aharoni?" Then i thought about the unusual caller-id and replied in English that it's indeed Amir Aharoni. The voice said: "I am calling from the CQD website, we sent you a Stina Nordenstam CD, did you receive it?" Those Belgians are so sweet. €20 is expensive, but what a wonderful service! Belgium now has me for an advocate in Israel.

       We're going to Coachella today! Wow. But first, a little more San Diego. So hard to leave this wonderful place. So we drove a little around La Jolla, took some pictures at the beautiful LDS temple (which is, as i mentioned earlier, even more impressive during the twilight) and then the truly greatest American experience -- dinner at the world-famous  urlLink Hooters ! Our server (which is an American word for "waiter") was Starley, who is apparently Jewish! Horrors! She even went to Kotel on her Bat-Mitzvah! Oh my. After a little stroll on the beach, we headed to the desert. 
 But no, not yet -- California is a very diverse place, so we had some mountains and forests on the way. So it was similar to Beyt-Oren again, but much longer and with a genius improvement called "Turnouts" -- short side lanes for slow traffic. Slow traffic is me, of course, and i let all those American guys to pass me. I still don't why were they in such a hurry. 
 And finally the desert. Huge, endless, with quite a lot of RV's going to and fro. Some half-abandoned "restaurants" on the way. A very long drive there, and though monotonous, not boring, and even quite beautiful. 
 Now Coachella is the name of the valley and also of a small town there. Nothing special about the town, except the Polo field. It's special, because first of all, all the other "fields" we've seen there were golf places, and there are a lot of them. Secondly, the Coachella Music and Arts Festival took place there. We've spotted the place from afar -- there were huge lights pointing at the sky (like in a Soviet war movie, i thought.) We arrived at the campsite right on time, just a few minutes before a very long line formed there. The tent was a good surprise -- it was my first time building it, and it was a breeze. The box said that it is for four people, but it had place only for two, or as El'ad said: "It is fine for two people, but four? -  urlLink Sprats !" Riga sprat, Riga sprat, goes so well with this or that. 
 That's it, tomorrow's the big day. Pixies.

       We took a peek at the old city of San Diego -- nicely restored with dressed-up tourist guides, but interesting mostly for the kids. Then some driving around the hills, some nice views and then -- the world-famous zoo! Ya mama. Animals and stuff. Very fun, but really not that much to tell. I took some pictures, and i'm particularly proud of the hummingbirds. Maybe i should study a little ornithology. El'ad, for some reason, was very curious about the koalas. The pandas there symbolized San Diego in the best way -- laid-back. 
 Later we took a little walk around the Balboa park, which is really nice. Maybe we should have went there earlier -- it's a quiet place with some very nice Spanish buildings. Maybe some other time. Then some more driving around the city, and also to the world-famous Coronado -- the fancy suburb on the peninsula connected to mainland with a long narrow bridge. Some impressive pics there too, and a supper in a Japanese restaurant. El'ad kept complaining about the quality of sushi there -- he was very disappointed, according to him it paled in comparison to Tel-Aviv's Sakura. Actually he was right, but hey, it's San Diego! He's supposed to be LAID-BACK!! In the evening we found ourselves an internet cafe. Expensive, damn it!

       The last day in LA. We were planning to go to San Diego in the evening, but were in a mood for a little culture in the morning, to balance the rollercoasters, so we went to the world-famous  urlLink Getty . As El'ad said, "That's what happens when someone gives someone else a billion dollars and tells him to build a museum". The experience begins at the parking: it is located at the foot of a picturesque hill, and the city had built a highway way just to facilitate it. From the parking there's a monorail tram going up the hill, and on its top is the museum. An appropriate word to describe the whole thing is "futuristic", but " urlLink Gattaca " is even more on the spot: everything and everyone is squeaky clean, the walls are sparkling white, and the gardens downstairs ... oh the gardens. The museum itself is not too big; maybe LA can't take large doses of high culture. But for what it is, it is a very worthy visit. 
 For the afternoon we went to Venice beach, which is quite like the Eilat promenade, but American, which here means -- original and real. And of course much much bigger. No chic there, just a lot of interesting and very free people. 
 Before hitting the highways for San Diego, we stopped to buy the camera for Dudi in a small store on Hollywood boulevard. It's a  urlLink Minolta DiMAGE Z1 , and though it looks a little weird on the pictures, it's very cool in reality. 
 I drove all the way to SD; there was some slow traffic on the way and crossing the huge sprawl of LA's one-story suburbs started to feel like eternity at some point, but as soon as we hit the country it started to look very nice. When we got close to San Diego, the sun was almost down, so we got an amazing view of the  urlLink San Diego LDS temple , which is much more beautiful and unique than the one in LA. Indeed, this was just the start of how nearly everything in SD is just better than in LA. 
 Our hotel in SD was  urlLink Travelodge . "Well maintained" means "not ruined", but El'ad says that it's not that they don't have the means to clean it, it's just meant to be that way, because one old Jew owns 99% of the hotels in the world, the cheap and the chic, and Travelodge is supposed to look like a motel; it's diversity, really. Sounds somewhat reasonable. 
 In the evening i drove to the world-famous  urlLink Gaslamp Quarter  and after i turned to Broadway St., i noticed police lights in the rear-view-mirror. For a few moments i thought that he's not chasing after me, but then he activated the siren. At that point i wanted to die. I carefully pulled over, open the window, and a very slick young policeman asked, just as i expected: "Your license and registration please." He checked my passport and told me that i turned left from a straight line. I was so shocked that i didn't even understand what he said exactly and just let El'ad do the talking. He let me go with a warning. I hardly managed to handle the car to the parking, then we went to an Italian restaurant and i ordered Gin-Martini right away. And then some wine. Just didn't want to leave El'ad any doubts about who's driving back. It took me a couple of days to understand what the policeman said, cause i started to imagine all kinds of weird things about the American traffic regulations. The meal was pretty good, but for me that evening was pretty much ruined. Trauma.

       After the little driving exercise last night we went back to the hotel to finally get a proper sleep, but alas -- we couldn't. Oh, the jet lag. Both of us hardly got any sleep. At least it was easy to wake up early. 
 We quickly agreed that there are probably no serious cultural, historical or natural landmarks in this town. Now El'ad didn't have any particular ideas of where to go, but i, of course, wanted to go to the happiest place on Earth --  urlLink Disneyland . El'ad vetoed, just as i expected, not wanting to expose himself to the cheesiest tourist trap on Earth. Eventually we settled on the world-famous  urlLink Six Flags , because it's lighter on the theme part and heavier on the thrills and rides part, which was perfect for me. Before that, however, we took a ride on the world-famous Mulholland drive. A long road through forests and mountains, it resembles the Beyt-Oren road in Israel, except that it's in the middle of a city. It was very cool and l33t to park the car on a steep cliff. Watching the fancy villas, we quickly came up with the second silly-phrase-that-would-follow-us-till-the-end-of-the-trip -- "Mi shegar po -- histader!!" ("Whoever lives here - made it!!"). El'ad was very pleased that from that moment on he can brag in front of Eisenberg that he visited the street after which  urlLink that movie  was named. I almost made an accident there, when i turned left on green without yielding to the cars in front of me. Apparently that's the rule in USA. It would never work in Israel, where green is always green! 
 On the way to Six Flags we dined at a world-famous unique gourmet restaurant called  urlLink Denny's . Just kidding -- it is obviously a chain, but not even half as good as London's Garfunkel's. Very American of course, and very junk, no matter how hard they advertise their veggie, diet or low-carb meals. The pancakes are served with all possible sauces and confitures AND whipped cream. A lot of it. But of course i finished all of it. Hey, it is America. 
 Six Flags was a real treat. A little expensive, but worth the price, as it is chock-full of rollercoasters, just the way Aharoni likes it. As for El'ad -- it took him some time to wash away the desperate "get-me-out-of-this-silly-tourist-trap!!!" face (and i also yelled at him -- it worked) and eventually he started to enjoy it. In a Whack-A-Mole race against El'ad i won a stuffed animal of an unknown sort -- we called it "Cat", but Hadar says it looks like a dog. Both of us took a lifetime dose of rollercoasters. On one of them, the world-famous "Viper", every time a ride started the P.A. proclaimed "Enjoy your ride on the V-I-P-E-R!!!", and because we stood in line for some time there and heard it at least five times it became the third silly-phrase-that-would-follow-us-till-the-end-of-the-trip. Other memorable rides include "Goliath", "Gotham City" and "X" (the one with the longest line). One last notable thing: El'ad noticed that nearly all girls there, of all ages (most were around 14) wore denim panties. I don't think i would notice it myself; he says that it induces pedophilia. 
 On the way back from Six Flags there was a huge traffic jam on the I-5 highway. We listened to OK Computer and at " urlLink Exit Music " El'ad came up with the fourth silly-phrase-that-would-follow-us-till-the-end-of-the-trip: "We hope/cha cha cha/cha cha cha." (It later developed to include "... a song to keep us warm/there's cha cha cha/cha cha cha" and applied to many more songs.) Sick of that jam, we got off the road ( pesha`!!! ) and had a dinner at a restaurant which actually looked like it is not a part of any chain, "Wild Thyme" (seriously). The food was slightly better than the average junk, and the waitress was particularly nice (later we found out that in USA most of them are). The funny part was that i heard a familiar song, and realized that i'm familiar with the version performed by the venerable  urlLink Flys . I knew that it's probably a Byrds cover, but didn't know what is the name of the English original, so i asked the waitress, and all she could tell me was: "It kinda sounds like the Beatles..." 
 On the way back to LA we checked out the sleeping bags prices at Sport Chalet, and i picked up a bottle of the world-famous  urlLink Mug root beer . Damn it, i wanted to taste the notorious beer replacement for minors and the ultimate weapon of  urlLink ghost-pirate  destruction. El'ad said that it's the most disgusting thing he ever tasted; i didn't think so, but it did taste just like  urlLink Ben-Gay , so i won't be drinking that crap again anytime soon. In general, the soft drinks in USA are rather bad compared to those in Israel and i'm not quite sure that it's just a matter of what i'm used to. Judging by the American taste, it seems that Israel's cheap "Super Drink" brand would be a real hit there, while Coca-Cola bottled in Bney-Brak and adopted to the Israeli taste wouldn't stand a chance.

       The flight was pretty bad. The food was OK (El-Al), but there were no movies (because of the Memorial Day), and i hardly got any sleep. My first jet lag. 
 The car: at  urlLink LAX  the car agencies are not at the airport itself and there are shuttles to the pick-up lots. Which is not bad, but for some reason the AVIS shuttle arrived late, and we were pretty pissed to see happy Dollar, Hertz and Thrifty clients taking one shuttle after another. Oh well. 
 Hadar made me promise that i won't drive on the highway right away, which was a good thing, because the world-famous LA highways are crazy. El'ad handled them pretty well. A notable feature of nearly all roads in the USA is poor asphalt, so pretty quickly we came with the first silly-phrase-that-would-follow-us-till-the-end-of-the-trip -- "Do we have a puncture? We should pull over to check". The first time we thought we had a puncture we actually did it. 
 The first night we stayed at  urlLink Motel6  Hollywood. It is indeed pretty cheap, but they are fair: if the guest leaves early, they give the money back. If there's no parking at the hotel, they give back the money for the parking outside. The room is a little smelly when you enter it, but after opening the window, it goes away. Overall -- a decent place to sleep. Only one serious problem -- CNN's was not on  urlLink channel three , in fact there was no TV at all. 
 We took a little walk on the Hollywood boulevard, the one with the stars. Nothing special, really, it looks just like Allenby in Tel Aviv (that is -- not particularly good!), just with the stars. So there are some attractions -- the world-famous  urlLink Grauman's Chinese Theater  (with the stars' handprints),  urlLink Ripley's Believe it or Not  and of course,  urlLink L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition  (apparently, that last one became so important that it can be found on the  urlLink MSN map , in LA tour guides, and among the flyers in hotel lobbies. I get the impression that Scientology is doing a pretty good PR job lately). Anyway, the jet lag kicked in, so we only took a peek at the Grauman's Theater and went back to the hotel to hit the sack. 
 I set the alarm clock on 08:00pm, but obviously woke up much later, at around 09:00pm. And of course it took some more time to wake El'ad. We went out to explore LA's nightlife and i drove for the first time. After going on red light once, i got a grip of myself. I drove through all of the world-famous Santa Monica boulevard, which, despite being featured in  urlLink certain  hit songs, it's just a very long street with a lot of traffic lights connecting several suburbs. If i'll go on with comparisons to Israeli streets, then this one is like Zhabotinsky in Ramat-Gan etc., really nothing special. The only landmarks worth of notice on this street are the  urlLink Herbalife  building, the  urlLink Flynt Publications  building, and  urlLink LA LDS Temple . There's a little alley in the end of that street, near the beach, with some pubs and restaurants, but it's not Israel, so at 10:30pm they were all closed, and most of the people at that alley were homeless.

       The bags are ready at Hadar's place. My last mindless day at work. Apparently my lovely government decided to play with the calendar, so my flight is on the Memorial Day and not on the Independence Day, which is not very nice. In any case, i also noticed that i land back in Israel a day later than i thought. Oh, the dates. But why should i care. 
 In the duty free we got ourselves 500ml of  urlLink Chivas Regal  in a plastic bottle, for the trip.

       Remember  urlLink Amir G. ? Of course you do. The boss man. He's also a well-known coffee-addict. I guess that many bosses are. Seeing him, i certainly don't want to get addicted to coffee. 
 Anyway, i brought a coffee machine to our building. The vendor installed the machine for free and we pay only 2 NIS ($0.40!) for a cup. When Amir saw it, he was happy, and i saw a very rare spark in his eyes. "Aharoni?! A coffee machine? Who brought it? Did you bring it? How much does it cost? Where did you get it? A coffee-machine!!!!!????!!!!" 
 He, too, can be human.

       New and promising venture -- this guy,  urlLink Ahava Shmaya , contacted me, he wants to play with me. His music is very good -- Hebrew, English, and instrumental too.  urlLink Give it a listen ! Clearly influenced by Bob Dylan and Pink Floyd and Radiohead to some point, but very original and varied. We swapped emails and i hope we will meet after my vacation. 
 It will be particularly interesting if i could hook him up with Eran and Miron...

       It was a huge gamble. Someone bet the life of a whole family. It was crazy. No-one is quite sure if it worked out. 
 They think they know why it happened. They think they control it. They take their medication daily, even though some of them think they don't need it. Each of them responds to it quite differently. They seldom wonder about its function. 
 Turns out it went on for longer than they expected. 
 Turns out it was bigger than anyone would imagine. Someone told those chips quite clearly that it would be bad. "In fact, it is bad already", he assured them. They recklessly moved on, the pictures burnt into their minds forever, but they still didn't notice it. Perhaps they knew better. People are strange.

       Someone asked me, as a Sonic Youth expert, for "a good definition of Art Rock". My answer was very long of course. I'm quite proud of it. Here it is: 
 Hello, 
 "Art Rock" is a common name for an endlessly varied bunch of genres and artists, which are unified by the idea that the simple format of rock music -- guitar, bass, drums, vocals -- can be considered an expressive art form, just as well as classical music is and not only music for dancing and entertainment. 
 There are, as i said, many varieties of art rock. Consider the simplest case, the Beatles: they experimented with lyrics, and dared to write rock 'n roll songs which were not about dancing or teen age love, such as "Paperback Writer" or "Taxman" and publish "Eleanor Rigby" as a rock song, while it was actually played by a symphonic orchestra. They have also quit playing live concerts for screaming young girls who cared more about their looks than about their music and proceeded to playing albums only. 
 The most bombastic kind of Art Rock, is of course the British "Progressive Rock", with bands such as Genesis, ELP, King Crimson etc.; they were rock bands, but often played multi-part songs, sometimes more than 20 minutes long, they incorporated many elements of classical and folk music, plus they played their instruments particularly well and added keyboards, flutes, organs and other unusual instruments to the simple guitar-bass-drums base. 
 Sonic Youth presented a new kind of Art Rock. Their background was punk-rock, which, ironically, emerged as a reaction to the sometimes over-bombastic and self-indulgent aforementioned progressive rock, but soon developed into a different art form at its own right. For example, the New York punk singer Patti Smith used punk rock to deliver the poetry she wrote. 
 Sonic Youth decided that their innovation would be mainly in the kind of distorted noise that they incorporate in their songs. It actually makes sense, that their songs about confusion, violence, perversion, rebellion etc. should have a confusing and violent sound. They definitely didn't have any intention of getting their songs played on the radio, but expressed their ideas in a totally independent form, which wasn't encumbered by record companies.

       Apparently The Smiths' " urlLink Panic " was inspired by a British DJ who senselessly played a Wham song after the radio reported about the Chernobyl disaster. A few days ago  urlLink Slashdot  posted  urlLink this link  about Chernobyl. A shocking and devastating website, and an absolute must-see. The English is a little broken (which is interesting for me as a linguist), but the pictures mostly speak for themselves. Did i tell you that it is a must-see?

       I went to a disco in Gaash last night with Hadar and her sister Ginat. I don't like discotheques. It seems to me, at least subjectively, that there's something very wrong in the concept of paying to enter some place with a lot of people you don't know to dance to music you didn't choose and drink free alcohol to forget that you don't really enjoy the whole thing (unless of course it's good alcohol, in which case you have to pay for it separately! Now talk about hospitality.) 
 Now Ginat, she really likes the concept of disco, and she likes that kind music (we'll get to that later too.) And so does her husband. Hadar is less excited about the music, but she likes discos, she likes dancing. She's begging me to come to a dance party with her for a very long time, so could i say no? 
 It's not that if i wouldn't have a girlfriend i would enjoy eyeing the girls (and no, if they would be more tastefully dressed it wouldn't help either.) 
 And it's not that the if the music would be to my taste, i'd feel better. It's not just Ginat's taste in music. Elad's taste is closer to mine (rawk, yeah!), but i still don't dig his passionate fascination with those nightclubs. 
 I like listening to music privately, intimately. In the car, on my headphones, on my stereo -- but alone! Or with few people whom i  know  to enjoy it as much as i do. It's very hard for me to listen to music with someone that doesn't like it. It really scares me; i'm not interested in turning them on to my style. It's my style and that's the way i like it. But people like Ginat are sure that everyone likes the same music that they do, and i can't blame them -- they are the majority, after all. Although it does bother me that ever since 1994 or so, the music at the discos didn't change at all. It used to be more dynamic before that. Oh, whatever. 
 What makes things even worse is that since i experienced the De La Guarda fiesta, it became even harder to impress. So ok, the party last night was pretty well organized, there were free drinks (to some extent), the sound was fine, the music was probably good for those who like that style, the place was clean and the security people were professional -- they even had a female guard to check the girls, but what now? Is that all? Can't i just mix myself drinks from my own booze and crank up 99FM radio and listen to exactly the same music for free (And God forbid -- i don't really want to)? I'm sorry, i give up, i just don't get it. 
 Burn down the disco 
Hang the blessed DJ.

       Anna from the Lithuanian course read my blog, and liked the  urlLink Bulgarian  entry. Nice to know that it was noticed. 
 My ex-co-workers, however, run out of words of praise for the entries about the job, about Amir G. and that stuff. I hate it, but can i tell my fans that they are wrong? That's a privilege that only giants of Stina Nordenstam's proportions are entitled to.

       Shavuot, my favourite holiday, foodwise. Cheese! And more cheese! 
 This time i made a lasagna. My first. It was kosher -- i replaced the meat with mushrooms, which was a gamble, but came out really well. 
 The night after that i had some weird dreams -- first, that i'm a character in a Big Lebowski sequel, where Walter "Shomer-Shabbes" Sobchak becomes a cheese factory manager. And later, that i went to a trip with El'ad and forgot to take the food and had to come back and somehow made all the way to a supermarket in Moscow, where i had to choose between Gouda cheese and  urlLink beef jerky  ... Guess what i got.

        urlLink Sonic Youth  -- finally, a pop band. I am still keeping my  urlLink Stina Nordenstam  fixation, classifying artists by the degree of their susceptibility and submission to their fans. And so it seems, that Sonic Youth are going to surrender completely to critics' and fans' will and make a sequel to 2002's duely acclaimed  urlLink Murray Street.  
 Now please forget anything you may or may not think about this rock'n'roll band and just listen patiently to this teaser song from the upcoming album Sonic Nurse,  urlLink I Love You Golden Blue . I know nearly all of their catalog by heart, so from the first moments it sounded just like them -- quiet static. It actually somehow gave me the feeling of the color blue. After a few seconds some sporadic strumming joins, again it is trademark SY. Beautiful, by the way. To the trained fan's ear it's been a treat until now, almost a guilty pleasure, but it's just the beginning, as after a minute or so, the actual song starts, quiet, slow and melodic! AHHHHHHHH! And yet it is 100% Sonic Youth. Kim sings, and unlike most of the time, she actually tries not to fake! The song is quite long, but pretty much verse-chorus-verse and without any chaotic feedback freakouts. As it draws to the end, i understand that i won't need a  urlLink thesaurus  to look for adjectives that could properly describe the outcome -- it is very simply beautiful. Just as i expected. Classic Sonic Youth, lovable Sonic Youth, my favourite old Sonic Youth, doing what they do so well for over 20 years now, beautiful songs. 
 And the point is that this whole expectedness is actually worrying. Are words like "songcraft" about to be applied to the great iconoclasts of pop culture? Did they become, God forbid, professional in indie-crowd-pleasing? Particularly worrying are the lines Kim sings in the chorus: 
 I can't feel the thrill, 
I don't have the will. 
 It is worrying, cuz the last time their lyrics seemed so multidimensionally self-referential was on Dirty's "Youth Against Fascism" with "It's the song I hate", when it wasn't clear what Thurston hates more -- fascists or making MTV hits. So, Kim -- who can't feel the thrill? The imaginary hero of the song, or maybe yourself after all those years? Cuz i admit that i'm still thrilled to hear you. Even though you can't sing. 
 As i go back to their excellent official website and listen to the "mixtape" (recommended to fans only), i relax. They still can kick some avant-garde ass if they want to, and release an incredible pop album every two years so  urlLink Geffen  keeps giving them money to hang in the studio (click on ECHOCAM at their  urlLink website ). Now let me please just let go and enjoy. 
 P.S. Two more things, that i wanted to write in this entry, but couldn't find the write place: 
 
 Sonic Youth albums seem to be getting better and better ever since 1995's Washing Machine (this includes the underrated 2000's NYC Ghosts and Flowers). 
 So does their  urlLink artwork . 
 
 That's it. I hope everyone enjoys it.

       My trip story will follow shortly. In the meantime, this little important thing: 
 Amir G. makes me sick, very physically, sick and nauseous. When i first came to the job after the trip, with his usual abysmally serious intonation he uttered: "Aharoni! You're finally back. You left a lot of unfinished tasks! We are very unhappy about you." Keep reading, it's getting better! 
 "What unfinished tasks?", i asked him. His viciousness was clearly unprepared for that. 
 "Ehh ... ehh ... Rakhamim will tell you." 
 And then, by some magic, Rakhamin enters the office. By that time, i was already feeling dizzy, disoriented and squeamish. 
 "Rakhamim! Tell Aharoni why are we so mad at him!", said Amir G. before making himself busy with the traditional duty-free  urlLink Toblerone 's i brought. 
 "Aharoni! It's good you're back. I want to punish you, you left a lot of undone work. But first, do you know that you have several special nightshifts starting next week?" 
 Of course it was spoken with the familiar clueless smile, that i tried so hard to forget in California. After a few minutes of some more void speeches both left the room, leaving me nauseous until the end of the day, and i'm quite sure that jet lag was not to blame here. 
 Thank you, my dearly beloved wonderful bosses for this hearty reception. Damn those work contracts.

       I insisted that El'ad should drive with me to the airport because i didn't want to kill myself on the last day. I took me a few minutes to convince him that he can take the bus back after we return the car, but common sense prevailed. 
 The drive was indeed dangerous -- there's no chance i could do it myself safely. The car return process was very easy and quick. On the shuttle from Avis agency to the airport i filled a customer survey and asked El'ad to mail for me when he gets back to Beverly Hills. 
 The baggage check-in was mostly, and just like in the way back from London, they hardly looked at my passport. They did check the bags though, because of the tent and it was a little embarassing to show the security girl the Hooters calendar. 
 Then i bought  urlLink Rémy Martin  XO in the duty-free for $88 for my dad, ate one last burrito, said El'ad one last goodbye and went to the boarding gate. The Israelis there were very unhappy to realize that they missed the duty-free. 
 The flight was so-so, i hardly got any sleep, but the movies weren't so bad:  urlLink Cheaper by the Dozen  which was actually complete crap;  urlLink Along Came Polly , which was silly, but had nice dance scenes (i can't believe i just wrote that);  urlLink Paycheck , which was 98% copied from  urlLink Minority Report , not half as good, but entertaining;  urlLink Mooseport  with Gene Hackman and Ray Romano, which was entertaining too, but only mildly and it also made me feel happy that i'm not American. But it took  urlLink Girl with a Pearl Earring  to finally help me doze off. 
 The interesting part in the flight was talking to Doc, a 70+ year old Jewish surfer from Hawaii. Like many ... things in America, it was a little surreal: his baggage consisted of surfers posters and a surfboard (and he could hardly walk). We talked about surfing, Israel, Israeli girls, more surfing, Tel Aviv hotels and beaches and i also told him why is it important not to change currency at the airport (those shameless Jews!) 
 Towards the end of the flight i imagined myself meeting Hadar, which actually made me extremely happy. I imagined it all in great detail (nothing dirty) and it put a big phat smile on my face.  urlLink It's good to be on the road back home again . 
 When i landed i was surprised that El-Al didn't lose any of my baggage, not even the sleeping bag mattress. Hadar's parents kindly picked up my stuff and put it at their place and i went straight to Jerusalem to meet my darling. She was at the Student Day party at Giv'at-Ram, so i took a shower at the dorms and went to see her there. When i came in, Ivri Lider was on the stage. The second i saw Hadari, i ran to her and we had a very very long hug. 
 If there is one reason to travel, coming home would be it.

       One day before the last. It's about time -- a great trip is coming to an end and i had enough, in a good way. 
 Essentially it was one more long and calm drive. I was starting to get really mad missing my dear Hadar, but on the other hand i knew that i'm getting closer to her every second and it soothed me. 
 We decided to pass on the world-famous  urlLink Hearst Castle , because we didn't have too much time and didn't want to pay $10 each for yet another tourist trap. The seals on the beach nearby were great though (and free). 
 We had dinner in a beach town called Cayucos, at "Skippers Restaurant", the best diner we tried anywhere in the U.S. A very good family feel. They still asked me for ID when i ordered beer. 
 San Luis Obispo mission -- nothing particularly fancy. It met my expectations -- i didn't think that it would look like Notre-Dame, but El'ad seemed a little disappointed. A simple catholic church and quiet gardens. Good for a relaxing half hour. 
 Santa Barbara -- not an extremely fancy place, as some people might believe. Yet another beach town, bigger than the most, but very Californian. We already got this California vibe and were totally used to it. After relaxing on the beach there, we were completely ready to change the atmosphere. On the way out from Santa Barbara, we popped into Taco-Bell; it was my favourite junk-food ever, but El'ad hated it. He just can't stand those tortillas. 
 Los-Angeles felt strangely welcoming. It took us some time to find El'ad's parents' friends' home in Beverly Hills, but when we finally arrived, it was all very nice. A very Jewish house, with religious books in English and Hebrew, mezuzot, brakhot hanging on the walls, ritual handwashing ware, kosher food etc. It surely felt very warm. We spoke in a mix of English and Hebrew, told our lovely hosts about our trip experiences, refreshed our memory, and had some interesting reflections of our own. A little taste of Jewish life on the way back home ...

       It's the VE-DAY today (as celebrated in Russia) which is an important holiday, because we kicked some Nazi ass back then. 
 Not much to tell about the trip today, as it was mostly driving and views. We started our journey south, back to LA through the west coast and Big Sur. When we left SF and moved into its suburbs we finally experienced the famous Bay Area fog -- the visibility was indeed pretty bad and we had to drive carefully. 
 We stopped at Santa Cruz for a great pizza and headed further on HWY 1. Quiet clean beaches, trees, hills etc. 
 Monterey is a tranquil beach community with happy children and very clean streets, but there was nothing that we were particularly interested to see. We decided to try the world-famous 17-Mile Drive. The entrance costs quite a few dollars (don't remember how many exactly...); is it worth it? Well, the nature there  is  somewhat more unique than most of the west coast and it  is  pretty well-preserved, but it's 17 miles! Which is long, considering the 25 mph speed limit. So except for a few nice places to shoot photos, there's nothing very special. 
 We slept at the  urlLink Big Sur Campground  -- very friendly place, $20 per car per night. There we decided to throw a spontaneous Bar-B-Q, got us some wood, burgers, sausages and marshmallows. It came out very well. We also had a friendly conversations with some girls at a site next to ours and i guessed that they spoke Czech and Polish. 
 The 22:00 curfew was obeyed perfectly there. Just amazing.

       We decided to stay another day in SF, but move to a different hotel -- the lovable Travelodge. Should have done it in the first place -- much cheaper and not that bad at all. 
 Not much to tell ... a had-to-be-there thing? Well, we saw the world-famous Coit tower, but didn't go up ($5 tourist trap) and took some walks through the neighbourhoods, the world-famous crookedest street in the world -- Lombard St., and we took a ride on the world-famous cable car ($3!!) Took some pics too. 
 Lunch at the China Town. It is indeed all very Chinese -- the people, the food, the trucks, the advertising. We dined at a place that was described in National Geographic's Traveler magazine and it was exactly as described -- they didn't speak English, there was no style, design, or, for that matter, clean tables and we had no idea what are we eating except that it was all  very  tasty and filling and cost just $5. 
 Later i dragged the tired El'ad to  urlLink True Sake , a store i read about in a magazine placed in our hotel room. I learned a lot about sake there -- why it is better cold, what are the different types of rice it is made from etc., but forgot most of it. The good idea that Beau, the store owner, had was to put labels on all bottles that recommend the sakes according to buyer's taste in food, wine and beer. There was a lot to choose from, hundreds of different brands; eventually i chose Toranoko, the one recommended for lovers of dark ales and semi-dry white wines, with green apples flavour, which describes me perfectly. 
 After some rest in the hotel we took a look at the nearby Japan town, which was much more quiet and clean than its Chinese cousin, but also a lot more American. There we had a good Japanese dinner and i also tasted Suishin, a sake which i wanted to buy at the store, but didn't and it was indeed good. I have a reason to go back to SF now. 
 Above the restaurant we noticed a Japanese karaoke club, which of course was very interesting for me, but a little less so to El'ad. I insisted on checking it out; the nice j-hostess said that the evenings begin at 22:30 (finally, some normality!) and they play both Western and Asian music, and i decided that i really want it. I still don't understand why El'ad wasn't so excited, he seems to be much more interested in both nightclubbing  and  j-girls than me. After some more rest at the hotel (it took me an hour to get Roz out of bed) we finally came there, seeing the amazing Hummer limo on the way. There was, indeed a lot of Asian music in the beginning, and some  urlLink bishonen  sang  three   urlLink Lifehouse  songs in a row. We will probably never understate the Japanese' taste in music (and the French's, for that matter.) Eventually i sang Beatles' "Come Together", which came out really great, my voice was in a surprisingly good shape and some j-girls that were sitting next to us asked me about it. But it didn't develop. I quietly noted to myself that i'm content to have the potential. If i only had a way to pass it to El'ad. We went back pretty drunk, after a few cocktails, a healthy dose of  urlLink Bishonen sake , and a bottle of Bud light, which was obviously horrible, but i had to taste it sooner or later.

       So, first things thirst -- we ordered room service! A nice Japanese (or Chinese?) guy brought us our "Golden Gate Eggs and Sausage". And a fresh apple. 
 Then the tourist public transportation ticket, which at $15 for three days is still a robbery. Elad lost his shortly afterwards. 
 Then -- to  urlLink fisherman's wharf , the world-famous Pier 39. Probably the nicest tourist trap in the world. There are charming Hawaiian Pearls salespeople (who are actually Vietnamese, but who cares); i bought one for Hadar. Very simple and beautiful. And the world-famous sea lions, of course. 
 We rented a bike, to bike The Bridge. The way to Sausalito was very easy, thanks to the lucky winds. We dined at a fine restaurant there, except that the Guiness pint that El'ad ordered was almost hot. Then, a surprise: it's impossible to take the ferry back, because no bikes were allowed at that particular time. So we had to go all the way back, and by a total coincidence it became my first mountain biking trip, which was hard, but rewarding. When we returneed the bikes, the receptionist, noticing our names, asked "Ma shlomkhem, El'ad ve-Amir?" and then explained us in friendly Hebrew that there's an unwritten agreement between  urlLink SFPD  and the petty street criminals -- they don't trouble the tourists and the police doesn't trouble them. This free spirit of San Francisco is everywhere; i heard that in NYC, ever since Giuliani came, it's just the other way around. 
 In the evening we headed to the gay center, Castro; it was, as always, too late (we still don't learn!), so we just saw the huge Rainbow flag, a lot of dyke couples and a  urlLink Yossi & Jagger  poster in a gay-porn DVD shop and also grabbed a delicious slice of gay pizza and  good  American beer called  urlLink Red Hook .

       The last day in Yosemite. We love this place. The camping is peaceful, the waterfalls are breathtaking, and all those cute squirrels everywhere. 
 Before leaving to San Francisco, we went to Vernal Falls. Everyone warned us that we'll get wet, but we just went on. The climb was hard and then those terrible drops from the waterfall were very disturbing, and when we had to decide whether to go on to Nevada Falls or go back down, we went on. I've got to admit, though, that i felt with El'ad like Hadar feels with me -- El'ad went faster than me and i needed more rest. So OK, he's in better shape than me, but he's supposed to be  laid back ! How many times i have to remind him that? 
 Anyway, after that ordeal we rested a little and went back down on a different path. We took some very impressive pictures there. The waterfalls, the waterfalls... 
 And then the long way to San Francisco. I drove those 3+ hours. Where Yosemite National Park  ends , Stanislaus National Forest  begins , and i, knowing some Latin, understood that a Park is something more preserved and a Forest is just a forest. But it's still national. The transition from park to forest to just a bunch of hills and then to the usual American sprawl was very gradual. A little before San Francisco i made a very silly mistake -- attempted changing lanes without looking at the dead zone and almost crashed the car. But only almost. The car into which i almost crashed already had some bumps in it. But i still learned my lesson well. 
 Driving inside SF is very hard. All those strange angles between Market St. and the numbered streets are very confusing with unusual traffic lights, one-way streets etc. Good thing the hotel was close to the highway. We stayed in Holiday Inn Civic Center and they are complete thiefs. The parking is fucking $25 a day! And the hotel is not really that good. 
 At 22:00 we went out to take a look at the city. Hey, we never learn -- no-one goes out so late in USA. There were a lot of homeless and drug dealers on the streets, but they didn't harrass us. At least we found an Internet cafe. Which was still very expensive. 
 The impression, however, is that SF is the closest i've seen yet to a real, that is, European city. But it's still very American with these srtaight streets.

       Another day at the world-famous Yosemite. I wish i could tell you where we went and what waterfalls we saw, but i forgot all those names and it really doesn't matter so much. It was beautiful. The pictures tell the rest. 
 In the morning we asked in the visitors center if we can go to some place where there are beautiful views, and so many people, and they recommended lake Hetch Hetchy. In the evening we went there. It's a long drive and some it is outside Yosemite proper and the road is narrow and a little ruined. We listened to Kid A on the way and it was really fitting. The lake is pretty big and there is a dam. I thought to myself -- "is it, like, God dam?"

       Bye bye Coachella, we're going to Yosemite. It's a long way and we drove something like ten hours. Passed Bakersfield and Fresno on the way. A lot of those American sprawls. So many Denny's and In-And-Out's and Jack-in-the-Box's and Motels6's along the way. Those simple signs -- "FOOD", "GAS". I enjoyed this driving. So American. 
 The arrival to Yosemite was wonderful. All those forests and mountains and waterfalls whose name i can't remember. A little after we came in we stopped at a vista point to take a piss and for some reason couldn't stop laughing at each for a few minutes. I decided to hide from El'ad to take a dump quietly and started climbing down the slope. El'ad stopped me before i totally lost my mind and maybe my life. Maybe it was some kind of oxygen poisoning. 
 When we arrived to the camp site the ranger reminded us to hide all the food and everything that has odor from the bears. They are really keen about it there.

       We learned the lesson. Fuck the crappy bands, we said, they're not worth our sweat. We're too old. So in the morning we went where the streets have no name --  urlLink Joshua Tree National Park . El'ad was very strongly impressed by it, me -- a bit less, but still something to remember. Those trees look very human. Like everything in America, the park is huge, and its sheer size is overwhelming. El'ad developed a conversation with a 35+ woman, who apparently saw the Pixies on the Doolittle tour, and was particularly of Kim Deal and even met Kim's mother in person. We were kids then and haven't heard about the Pixies; she was younger; the Pixies themselves were younger, but -- the songs stayed the same. This put me in a very philosophical mood. She also told us about her love to Gram Parsons and his love to the Joshua Tree Park. I should check him out. 
 In the evening we went back to Coachella to catch good places for the Flaming Lips. We saw Belle and Sebastian doing the last few songs, then Air (French Band), which were kinda good, but not too amazing, and then the big wait for the Lips began. They were probably the first band on the entire festival which started the show late. Their excuse is that they had a lot of stuff to prepare. So -- not only they had lots of people in funny costumes (animals, Santa, the Sun, etc.) waving flashlights and doing silly stuff, as they do on most of their shows, this time they went one step ahead: Wayne Coyne descended on the crowd from the outer space in a giant bubble and tried some stage-diving to the sound of his band playing an almost classical overture. The very short setlist: Race for the Prize, Fight Test, The Gash, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots p. 1. In between the songs Wayne tried to teach the crowd about democracy, Bush, Kerry,  urlLink Schwarzenegger  etc.; a notable quote: "I'm not saying 'Fuck Bush', because he was elected by the people, so i'll just say 'Stop Bush'. Let's say it, let's wake all of Palm Springs saying it!" Actually Bush was  urlLink not elected by the people , but who remembers that now. 
 As the show went on, Wayne kept saying the crowd not to worry, as the Flaming Lips will finish on time and let the Cure begin. However, i didn't care about the Cure so much, and right after the Lips finished, i ran to see Mogwai on another stage. Mogwai were smashing and it's a shame i missed the first few songs. The Cure were total trash. Everyone knows that Robert can's sing, but this time he didn't even try. And they didn't play so well either. Bollocks. Oh well.

       It's desert, it's high, it's Coachella! Quick shower in the morning -- getting in line at 06:45am was a smart move, by the time the showers opened at 07:00am, the line was already long. So i was lucky. El'ad was lazy and had to wait for at least 40 minutes. Then a little shopping -- snacks, water, stuff and then we discovered that no food or drinks may be brought into the festival grounds. Stinking capitalists, they wanted us to buy water inside. $2 for 33cl. 
 A little about the music --  urlLink The Sounds  are  urlLink Blondie  look- and sound-alikes, whether they mean it or not. Even their websites look the same. But they write their own songs and it's fun, so why not.  urlLink Kinky  were incredibly bad, but the crowd loved them. Their most sophisticated song had four words in it!! "Welcome to my world,/Welcome to my world,/Welcome to my world,/Welcome to my world" ad nauseam.  urlLink Juana Molina  and  urlLink stellastarr*  -- both were very good, but they played in that terrible super-hot tent, so we couldn't handle it and left to rest after a few songs. Beck came to a surprise show, but it was in the same crappy tent! Too small. Obviously a lot of people wanted to see the world-famous Beck, so this time we stood outside, and hardly saw, but he was pretty good, alone with acoustic guitar.  urlLink And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead  were good, but i wasn't prepared so well.  urlLink Howie Day  -- he had a little nu-metal look, but actually he's pretty much a singer-songwriter. El'ad liked him. 
 The food and drink were terribly expensive, and i even broke my promise to Hadar not to drink any Coca-Cola (i confessed later), because the line for the water was just much longer. After a few tiresome hours we went into the movie pavilion where we watched " urlLink Bodysong ", which is famous for having a soundtrack by Jonny Greenwood. Very graphic presentation of birth, growing up in very varied kinds of environments and schools, games, love, sex (did i mention "graphic"?), suffering, death etc. Very expressive, well-done, i guess, not ultra-genius, but there was air-conditioning in that pavilion, and i didn't care about anything else. I needed rest before the Pixies. 
 The Pixies show was amazing. El'ad wasn't impressed too much, because i failed to educate him on that matter. Oh well. It was a standard Pixies reunion show, as much as it can be called "standard" -- Bone Machine, Isla de Encanta, Monkey Gone to Heaven, Velouria, Broken Face, Tame, Debaser. All those great songs that i and so many other people know by heart. Most of them were performed just like on the album, but there was a nice slow rendition of Nimrod's Son. In Heaven with Kim's lyrics was a little disappointing, but except that -- pure bliss. Radiohead were pretty good too. Excellent, actually, with mind-blowing performances of There There and 2+2=5 for the kickoff, heartbreaking Exit Music (For a Film) which started very quietly and was interrupted by some rap band on the other stage (which made the Radiohead audience rightfully angry) and two wonderful surprises for the encore -- Planet Telex and Creep. I took a small peek at Kraftwerk extravaganza -- they were performing " urlLink Tschernobyl ,  urlLink Harrisburgh ,  urlLink Sellafield , Hiroshima". I loved it, but El'ad was tired so we went after two songs. I'd like to catch them some other time. 
 The amazing thing about camping in USA is that the campers actually obey the noise curfew. We wouldn't imagine that someone would care about it, because in Israel no-one does. Makes me think about how we Israelis don't care about good sleep for ourselves or our friends.

CD costs 45 NIS in Jerusalem's "Hatav Hashmini" and 501 Verbs costs 89 NIS at the Academon which leaves us with 161.25 NIS; I haven't seen the DVD or the dictionary here, but DVD would cost at least 80 NIS and the dictionary at least 140 NIS, so i saved at least about 50 NIS. 
 Reviews of at least some of the above items to follow.

       From now on i'm gradually changing the way i write dates. It is actually quite a principal decision and that's why i'll elaborate on it now for a minute. I'm sick of VMS-style dates. They are lovely, but i need a change in my life, so there. From now on i'm going for the Japanese style YYYY-MM-DD, because when you come to think of it, it is the one which is best-suited for technical purposes, as it is the easiest to sort. Thanks for your attention to that.

       My bigger sister Zhenja, her daughters Sasha (11) and Dasha (4) and my other sister Olga's son Nikita (12) are here. Olga is coming too on the 18th. I've been waiting so long for them. Family, afterall. Nikita, in a way, would be my smaller brother. I wonder how much i missed this as a lone child. And i admit that it's a little awkward. I hope not to disappoint anyone, especially myself. 
 After looking for stuff to talk about i finally got to the simple things -- i'm explaining them about Israel and Jews and Hebrew, and why are there so much people speaking Russian here, especially the cashiers. Sasha thought that they all just learnt it, because hey -- everyone knows Russian, it's so easy...

       Why does the free-thinker Amir E. Aharoni fast on Tish'a B'Av? 
  It's cynical, i know -- but it's healthy. 
 It's an excellent willpower exercise. I proudly stood the test. 
 Because i am a free-thinker. I am a free-thinker because i think like myself and not like other "free-thinkers" that scoff the Kharedim for ignoring the Holocaust Day 10:00 siren, but ignore Tish'a B'Av. Before there was the tragedy of Holocaust, there was the tragedy of the destruction of the Temples. It wasn't just a desecration of a holy site --  people  were killed there. It was not only a destruction of some Temple, it was a destruction of a nation. So i observe both days. Call it "providing a good example."  
 At 19:00 before the fast began i ate wonderful Pam-Pam's Khumus with Mushrooms,  drank a lot of water and didn't eat or drink anything until 20:00 the next day. Unlike some of my freunds (wink wink) i worked regularly and by a total coincidence was released at 15:00 and then went to visit Hadar. 
 On the way to Jerusalem i sat next to Khaggay, a nice Khabadnik, whom i asked to teach me a bit Tanya. An interesting piece of religious-philosophic literature, once you understand all the abbreviations. A lot can be said about Khabad's unusual practices, but the book of Tanya is not a hoax; any opposition to it is purely political. Incidentally or not the part which is supposed to be studied on the 9th of Av speaks about self control and power of will, something very human, with almost no references to Sabbath and Kashruth etc. Khaggay told that whahtever i will learn is "personal providence" -- why not, i accept that. 
 For supper i ate one toast with Feta cheese and tomatoes and a little salad. And a yoghurt. And an apple and a few grapes. And finished the first half of "War and Peace". 
 The 9th of Av of 5764 was a good day for me. Today, the day after, was yet another 8:30 to 17:30 workday with Pam-Pam's Kabab in pita for dinner. We all need special days sometimes.

       I'm finally taking up Tolstoy's "War, What is it Good For" in it's original tongue,  Russian  French. It goes surprisingly quickly, i'm already on page 370. It's truly amazing how lively his language sounds. Tolstoy is so damn good at presenting different character types, such as Boris' disgusting adaptiveness to army bureaucracy -- "a  subordination  in which a well-connected staff sergeant can give orders to a colonel". And then there are also Marie's modest religiousness, Dolokhov's repulsive cruelty, and Prince Andrew's manly, blunt and individualistic reasoning. But my favourite is Pierre Bezukhov, of course, with his emotional directness, unpretentiousness and naïve search for truth. 
 Some critics go all the way to say that "War and Peace" is really more of an excercise in character prototyping than an actual novel, but that's exactly the thing i love about it. Tolstoy's philosophy never stops surprising me -- i would expect that he would emphasize virtues like patriotism, faith and honor much more, but he stubbornly keeps teaching the reader that nothing is more important than humanity, life and love. If only he was the czar.

       I had a heart attack yesterday. Actually it was in my belly, but i don't know how they call it when it happens there. I felt this sharp pain in my belly, tried to tell Eitan that i'm dying, but could hardly speak. Then my head began to explode, there was funny noise in my ears and i lost my clarity for a few moments. Finally Eitan and the guys from  urlLink IBM  who work with us called an ambulance. The paramedics found that my blood pressure dropped to something like 80/50, but i felt fine except that. They took me to  urlLink Sourasky (Ikhilov) , where a male nurse took my blood, or at least tried, because his needle stuck inside, bended and he had to take it from the other hand. When he finally succeeded, a doctor came to check me. Actually she was an intern, and she wasn't particularly nice; impatient and cynical, Israeli-style. Eventually after almost 2 hours in the E.R. they just said that i'm in perfect health. I'm not a hypochondriac, but somehow i just don't believe them.

       Avis responded to the  urlLink customer survey  that i filled and El'ad was kind enough to mail, apologizing for the slow shuttle bus, saying that "there is no excuse for being late etc." And they gave me a $25 (valid until June-2006 in USA and a few other countries). 
 They actually care about their promise to try harder. Good for them.

       Hadar's uncle passed away last night after a long illness. I didn't know much about it, i knew that he is ill, and he was operated recently, but until the very last time i saw him he made his best efforts to enjoy every little moment of his life, and i think he did. I'll remember him as a good, happy and loved human being. TNZBH.

       Amir G. is a  urlLink sick fuck . Just had an urge to say it. 
 I went to my usual physician a few days ago and told her how bad i feel at the workplace. Physically ill. She asked me if there's someone in particular in my workplace that makes me so ill, i said yes. She asked me if everything becomes normal when i come home, i sayd yes. She said that it's a known condition, medically called "anxiety"; She couldn't formulate it better: "It sometimes happens that some loser is over-promoted and then he ruins the lives of his empleyees ... usually out of envy." She gave me one sick day, with the diagnosis "Headache". 
 There it is, Mr. G.: to you i'm just a little soldier, but to me you're just a little man. I have just six months until the end of that damned contract. You won't break me.

       Yes -- he bought a new CD player for the car, now all his tapes are obsolete and he wants something new and obviously the possibility of getting free  urlLink Leningrad  music excites him. 
 Of course, searching for "leningrad mp3" is not very productive, as most of those monster mp3 sites are strange ad traps and God knows why do they exist at all. Advanced users like me can't find anything there, so what can users like my dad do.
