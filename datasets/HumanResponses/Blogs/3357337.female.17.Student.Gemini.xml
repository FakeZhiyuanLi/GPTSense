      as of this writing i have exactly 11 days before another school year officially kicks off. and that schoolyear my friends isnt just something.  coz in about eleven days, i am a college student. a freshman in a university.  i came from a catholic all-girls school and thats where all this drama is coming from.  the university is conveniently(im being sarcastic here) 2 hours away from where i live.  and im going to commute after my first week.  maybe this is just jitters..or im just freaking out. ..  but i guess its not all baaadd. i got in the course i want. i'll be majoring in communication arts. ill be studying the subjects of my dreams. so i guess ill be fine. yeah, ill be fine.

      Survivor isnt reality tv.  Spongebob is.  Spongebob works in a diner and has a selfish,self-centered crab for a boss. He works there despite the fact that he knows that most of the time his boss isnt up for any good. All these, well..because he has no choice and he enjoys cooking those crabby patties.   Spongebob has an egoistic colleague who acts as if he owns the place. Although Spongebob is the one who cooks the food that makes the diner successful, he treats Spongebob like shit. Talk about being insecure.  Spongebob has a stupid friend starfish who he has to deal with every single day. Spongebob has to endure idiocy at its best and still keep his sanity.   These are the things that every person, at any point in their screwed up lives, experience. This is reality personified in a cartoon.   And yeah, when u get stranded in an island, u dont get followed by a camera and u try to help the other people who are stranded too to survive. Because ur human, and that is just how it goes...how real life goes.

      i finally have my own blog! hehe. i think this is cool, sharing my thoughts-my random thoughts-with the world..at least as far as the world wide web is concerned. :)  just recently, i read the book entitled "i kissed dating goodbye" by joshua harris. its a great book and it opened my eyes about relationships. there were some parts that i could not relate to though coz its about marriage and stuff like that. im just turning 17! but i have to say that i indeed kissed dating goodbye..at least for now.

      answer: by backstabbing.  i hope some will be informed that the world isnt round for nothing. u can't do anything that isnt goin to come back to you and get u at ur rear.   there are a lot of things goin on in our world- children starving, women are being abused, HIV is fast spreading, our economy on the ground, terrorism, obesity..and the list goes on and on... and what do some people care about? bring others down and talk nasty things behind their backs.  i hope and pray karmic forces will go gentle on you, and i hope and pray i can forgive you too. and while im at it..here is what you are supposed to do:  get a life.

      so far, so good.   what u just read aptly describes my first month as a college freshman. and so far, i have not failed a single quiz and they are coming my way faster that u can say stop. i go home everyday unscathed, and i am eternally grateful.  i have filed for diff orgs like its the end of the world tomorrow. as of now, ihave filed for 4 orgs. i cancelled wat cud have been my first brush with theater because i nid to study math and the constitution...no regrets.. i passed the test. im about to cancel one more, i got accepted in another, and the last one is still pending. if ur thinking that this will be the last of my applications, well..think again..coz i am goin to apply in another one related to advertising.    now this is my version of suicide..minus death.

      i was at the mall a while ago, and then after an hour of mind shattering, ground-breaking um..aimless wandering aka window shoping..i felt the urge to go to wendy's and eat a hamburger.  so there i went, ordered my burger and sat in one of their chairs... alone.  now what is it about people eating alone in a fastfood restaurant that compels some people to wonder (out loud and otherwise)and fuss and get fidgety in their own seats? a lady came up to me and asked me if i was ok. "i was, until u came up to me and asked me that stupid question", i said to myself. that and the stares i got from the other diners.  call me paranoid, or something else..but i think people nowadays are geting more and more clique-y and dependent. i think its about time people try to enjoy the company of their own selves..its not being a loner and detaching yourself from others.. but, i think, people will come up with better things to say, suggest more happening hang outs,or better yet be more effective people who lead fun lives if they can be able to be with themselves even for just an afternoon.  its like loving. u cant really give something u dont have or did not really get to enjoy.   the bottomline is..its ok eat alone. its ok to be with nobody.... sometimes.   i know.  i have to let it go and loosen up.

      I want to feel butterflies in my stomach.   I am sitting here in front of my computer with petroleum jelly all over my lips (its chapping like hell)on a fine friday night. i cannot sleep and its killing me.. and.. I have no one to talk to.  Now I realize that I am really alone. That there is a part of me thats envious of other people for having someone in their arms. I guess, no matter how cynical this world may be, the people living in it are still hopeless romantics.   At the end of the day, what everybody wants is someone who'll ask them how their day went, if they're feeling alright, if they need a hug..someone who'll kiss them good night, and somehow make everything fine again.   butterflies,butterflies,butterflies.

       I love to shop.   In fact, i save to spend on yet another bag, another shirt, and another pair of shoes. Just recently, i just found out that as far as I am concerned..shopping has healing powers. Believe me, I went shopping a week before my prelims exams with a temperature of 38 degrees...and guess what.. i became so healthy afterwards that I was able to answer all the questions in all my 7 exams. must be the endorphins that got crazy all over my body, the exercise that comes with walking for two hours going through racks after racks of mass produced merchandise..well, that or i just need psychiatric help for being so "angry" with money that I can't stand it bein with me..for a week.   so without further delay or as good writers would put it.. much ado (yeah whatever)..here are my confessions and escapades as a (now) CHRONIC SHOPAHOLIC:  1. I refer to Carrie Bradshaw like a person who truly exists..and someone who is close to me. I can't, for the life of me, remember what Condoleeza Rice's occupation is or her place in Bush's government.. but I am poud to say that Carrie is a writer of a sex column who loves shoes (Manolos and Choos), she has dated a musician and the two of her loves are Mr. Big and Aidan. she also can't bear to leave NY much less see other people do it, coz New York City--is the CITY..and her fashion acquisitions are her financial investments to date.   2. This is how I pray:  "Dear God, thank you for all the blessings. You really love me. Im sorry for acting like a spoiled brat sometimes..ok half the time..promise ill make up for it..in the future. Please guide me, esp with my studies.. take care of my family, my friends, everybody in school and the whole world.. even those who hate me..  And God, please help me in my pursuit to become a size 0 so I can fit in those Roberto Cavalli dresses and Tyler pants (with the air) when I can I finally afford them or have come up with a flat 1 average and bribe my parents with it. Thank you God, i love you."  3. I silently contemplate suicide whenever a person does not know what DKNY stands for or the difference bet suede and velvet.   4. I stay up late just watching Fashion Television. U think women walking up and down the ramp is boring? Well, what do u make out of watching races joined by schumacher..he wins all the time, its no contest! let it go.   lets all watch fashion television and will&grace..we shud be inspired by karen's penchant for designer clothes..so we wudnt look the same all the freaking time.  5. I think Coco Chanel is a hero.  6. The number of fashion magazines (Cosmo, et al) i have can successfully burn our house in a minute when u light them up.   7. The wrong color of socks can make or break a guy's outfit and the wrong shade of stockings can destroy a woman's reputation. I don't need to wear stockings, thankyouverymuch!  8. I get sad when I don't get to buy anything. As in depressed.  9. I enjoy reading Oscar Wilde..and those fashion critic's articles about every fashion show here or otherwise.  10. And lastly.. I keep every paper bag of the diff stores...as remembrance.

      A promise or a dare I would jump if I knew you'd catch me Staring over the edge I can't tell if you'll be here for me  I close my eyes and make a wish Turn out the lights and take a breath Pray that when the wick is burned You would say that it's all about love  [Chorus:]  You were there when I needed you You were there when the skies broke wide, wide open You were there when I needed you You were there when the skies broke wide, wide open  You were never here  I remember you said Love was more than your good intentions Empty boxes on the floor Things I never asked you for I pray that when the wick is burned You would say that it's all about love  [Chorus]  I can't see the promise of Excuses you fall upon I pray to God not holding on To things you've left undone  [Chorus x 2]  You were there when I You were there when I You were there when I needed you    this song was playing on my mind while i was taking my exam in literature.         i really hope i passed that test.
