       urlLink    This is Geddy Lee, one of the greatest bass players of all time. He plays, along with Neil Peart (the greatest drummer of all time) and Alex Lifeson (an insane guitarist) for one of my all time favorite bands, RUSH. I just recently saw them in concert with Ryan Cicero, another big RUSH fan. &nbsp; urlLink

      I am obsessed with music.   I love it all (well most...). It's all I do is listen and "try" to play music.  It sooths the soul. No matter what kind of mood that I am in the music always brings me higher.   I have just taken on the role of "unofficial music 'expert'" for "The Apex". I'm goig to be reviewing local bands and well-known bands. Pretty much everything, so if anyone has a suggestion on a local band or a new album coming out, leave a comment.

      I write for a local feature magazine, "The Apex". It's a really cool thing, run by about 6 high school kids, including me. Our third issue is coming out soon, and you can pick them up at places where the Fort Wayne reader is distributed (coffe shops, restaurants, etc.). I've got the cover story in the next issue. It's about Matt Taylor, a local musician. I don't really know much about him, so if anyone has heard anything about him let me know.

       urlLink    We go on a cruise every year, and this guy was our bus driver. He was the coolest guy ever. He sang soo many cool songs, like the Banana Boat song (aka Daay Ohhh), and stuff like that... it was awesome.&nbsp; urlLink

      Wow, you're proly all like that's like all Larry does is talk about Canada, but this is only my second post about it. I just can't explain what it's like. If I told you what we did, most of you would prolly ask.... "Well why do you go back every year?". And if I knew the answer to that question, I'd tell ya. But there is something unique, something different, something extrodinary about it that just keeps bringing me back. Its not the never ending lake, its not those millons of stars, but what I think it is is the peacefulness. The relaxation. The cameraderie. But most of all it's the atmosphere. When you wake up in the morning, you don't have to worry about who is going to like you and who is going to be mad. You don't have to worry about your boyfriend or girlfriend.  You don't have to worry about fitting in. You don't have to worry about how you look. When your biggest problem is a 220 rod portage, life is good... very good (especially if its Yum Yum (haha Canada kids)(I hear its over rated anyway)). Life, I think it's good.

      In his 2nd post, titled "Too much drama", KNo said this bout me. "...We could all take a lesson from Larry, cuz as it says in his Blog, he is one of the most carefree and happy kids that I know, after reading his post, i came up with the idea for mine. He knows how to live life the fullest and how to just live, learn, and forget. So let's try to keep the drama in the movies everyone..."  Thanks Kev, that means a lot.

      The reason this blog is titled "A unique outlook" is due to one of my favorite teacher in the entire world, Mr. Kuhn. Kuhn is absolutely the man, and anyone who has had him will tell you that. But, anyway, back to my story. We were talking one day and he told me that I was the only kid that he knew who was truly happy... that all of the other kids took things for granted and were just down sometimes. He asked me why that was and I told him what I thought to be a good answer. "Well K-Man, I'm a 15 year-old highschool Freshman. There is nothing in my life, right now, that big, that I can be truly that upset about." And he said, "You're right, Larry. It's just that most kids your age don't figure that out for awhile." That moment is probably one of the most defining moments of my life. I try and be open minded and see the entire spectrum of things. Always be positive, never get down. I have a unique outlook on life... it cannot be explained in words.

It took awhile to get used to using the template editor, but eventually I got the hang of it. Tell me what ya think!

      Every year I go on a canoeing and camping trip to Quetico Provincial Park, in Canada (just above Minnesota). It the most amazing place I have ever been to.  Trees as far as the eye can see. Canoeing down endless lakes. Singing ridiculous songs to your fellow canoers. Lakes ending, portages beginning. Searching for campsites. Setting up tents. Hanging the close line. R and R. Chopping fire wood. Coooking a nice dinner over a warm fire. Euchre game. Massages and rest. A look at the stars. The stars that never end. Hundreds of thousands that you could reach out and touch. Crawling into the sleeping bag. Drifting into a different land. Awaking to the sounds of the loon. Another day gone, another day about to begin.   urlLink    Getting up for an early paddle, the sunset was beautiful. Had to stop and take a photo.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink   &nbsp; Yea, so everyone always desides to party at my house with out telling me, but that's for another blog. So the three Taylors (TU, TK, and TP) were all at my house, and Brittani was. After countless efforts to try to get them all to pronounce my name right (thanks mom), no one got it. I was laying on the kitchen counter when TK licked some dinner mints and put them in my hair. 2 of them to be exact. The first one came out easy. The second one was a chore. After TU trying to pull it out of my hair, I just told TP to hold it while i jerked my head away. Yea it came out alright, with half of my hair stuck to it. Ow.

      So I get a call at work from Lindsay Baker and she wanted to know if I wanted to go to the Three Rivers fireworks thing with her, Kelli, Mike, and Megan Koo. I really didn't wanna go, but I told Linz to call me back when I got off at seven. Well, to make a long story short, I ended up in the car with Mike, Kelli, and Linz, in my cowboy hat, going to meet Megan at the Holiday Inn. We got Meg and walked around for a little bit, looking for junk food alley. Until we walked by the fountains. Lindsay and I ran over to them and went for a little swim, while the other three waited for us, or so we thought. So we got out of the fountain and looked around for the other three, but couldn't find them. So we walked down to junk food alley, and still couldn't find them, so back to the fountain it was. When we got a call from Kelli that said where they were. All the way back to junk food alley we found them. So then we walked down to find a place to watch the fire works. We ended up behind a building with some trees, but it was a good spot over all. The fireworks were real cool too.

      Yes, another adventure for me. My partner in crime this time, Allison Douglas. Well all these adventures seem to start off the same, we were bored and had nothing to do. So Allison wanted to go jump in a pond and I didn't want to... cuz I'm supposed to do that with Ryan and Jordan, but that's for another blog. Anyway, so she ran upstairs and outside and chased her down and then we saw the mini-bike. Now this isn't any ordinary moped type thing, this thing is the coolest little motorcycle ever. It's a 1970 honda mini-trail, blue with orange writing. Oh so pimp. It goes about 15 mph,&nbsp;on a good day. But, back to the adventure. I got on the mini-bike and Allison got on my bike and we meandered down the street, with no particular place in mind. It was about 8 o' clock when we left and rode down my street then around in circles for awhile, then down the Ciceros street, then back. Down another street, on to the golf cart path, past the hole in one hole, and down by the Pyle's house. We rode up their back yard to say hi, but almost got attacked by their dogs in the process. They weren't home so it was back to the cart path, and Allison was driving the mini-bike. Oh boy, there's someting scary. She didn't even know where the brake was. Oh geeze. But, we drove around for awhile, down the cart path to the seventeenth hole where we found the sprinklers. YES! Gotta love the sprinklers.&nbsp;So we drove through them a little bit, and then turned around, back past the Pyle's house and down to the DeJong's house. They are in Wisconsin so we jumped on their trampolene for awhile. We layed there and Allison said, "lets go get ice cream." So off we went. Back down the cart path, through the sprinklers,&nbsp;on to the 18th hole. Off the 18th past the tennis courts and down to the office park through the secret maintenence path on to the 9th hole, past the Wises and up the huge hill. Down through the Villas and out by Wells Fargo and McDonalds, our destination. Wow, what top quality individuals they have working there. But aside from that, Allison got a triple thick milkshake, and I got a hot fudge sunday. We ate/drank our ice cream and looked at our phones. the time was 8:59 and I bet her we could get home in 15 minutes, which is making pretty good time. We ran out the door and onto our bikes. I manned the mini-bike and flipped on the headlights, Allison took the bike. All the way back through our route. Out the Wells Fargo parking lot, back through the Villas down the 9th hole hill, past the Wises, past the club house (close call), on to the open road, back past the driving range, onto the 10th hole. Down the 10th across the street to the hole in one hole, backwards down that hole, back across the street to the 13th (the one my house is on), all the way down the 13th to my back yard. And into my garage... all in 12 minutes. Oh yea, record time. Another adventure in the books. Gotta love it. Live in the moment.

      As most people know a backseat driver is someone who criticizes the drivers driving from the backseat. And as I learned the other day in Drivers Ed, I would probably be a better backseat driver than I am a regular driver. No, not really, I am okay driver, B+ (good enough not to have to take the driving test down town), but I do have a tendency to speed a little. Hey, it's in my genes. Everyone in my family speeds. My 56 year old grandpa is a speed demon, my mother is, my father is (oh boy), and so is my grandma... kinda. Oh well, I'll be okay. But hey, being from the city we're all good parallel parkers!   Oh Backseat Driver also has another meaning to me. It's the name of our band... but we'll save that for another blog.

      As Ryan Cicero once said, "Larry, I come over to your house because, well, we never have the same thing twice... and it's usually pretty exciting." That pretty much sums up my house. Never a dull moment, thats for sure. The Wises are staying with us for a couple of days, Jenna and Jordan. And Jenna told me to blog about her.... so last night she was "depressed" (some girl thing), and she was hitting me with pillows, hampers and other various objects. She also has never had Chinese food. This I couldn't believe. So we went out for Chinese and got American stuff. The only Chinese thing she had, was an egg roll, but oh well. Atleast she tried it. And we're going to watch School of Rock tonight. Gotta love that movie.

But, when I say I like to write, I mean I like to report, review, and inform. I don't like to write deep stuff, just because, quite frankly, I think it's pointless, and makes things more complicated then they actually are. And I dunno about you, but I like my stuff simple.

      I have two posts from someone named "Stanley" and I don't know who he is, or maybe I do, I'm not sure. But I should reply to my readers and explain my blog. He posted two comments on my views on life... which I will admit contradict eachother some, but what it all comes down to is a matter of opinion. But the facts are the average life expectancy of a human being is about 70 years old, which if you think about it, is a long time.  And I definatley think life should be simple... I mean simple things are fun too. And all people do is complain about how hard their lives are, when really, its only as complicated as they have made it. There's a simple solution to everything. I agree with, "living your dreams" because believe me I have soo many of them and I intend to fulfill all of them. I'll have to post that list in this blog sometime, it's a good one. And to "Stanely" thankyou for reading my blog, I appreciate your posts.

But noooooo, it HAD to thunder and lightning. So we decided to camp in, instead of out... I think that was a good choice. AND TAYLOR UNDERWOOD MY BEST FRIEND WAS WITH US!

      Kind of ironic, me writing the name of the day our country celebrates independence from Britain in Spanish, but whatever. It makes for an interesting title.  But, I had a good fourth. It was my first fourth of July that I had been home for in 4 years. The last 3 I have been in Canada over this week. I got hit twice with fireworks, but it was fun. I wanted to have a bottle rocket wars but of course not, cuz "You'll get hurt." I probably would have, but it wouldn't have killed me. Gotta live a little, right? Anyway, so after everyone left the Wise's house it was just me and Ryan left... imagine that? and we went over to the Smith's bonfire across the street. We were gonna go SCUBA diving for golfballs but Jordans dad wouldn't let him, so we're gonna save that for another day (it's on the goal list so I HAVE to do it!). But then Ryan and I went on another "mini"-adventure. Our goal this time... wood. We tried to find a saw in the garage, but it turns out the Wise's don't a "manual" saw. So we took this crappy little thing, and baseball bat. We were just going to cut down a tree in their backyard, but it turns out their backyard happens to be the 18th hole of the golf course... haha. No one would notice. But we went back in the woods a little bit, but the litte crappy thing didn't cut very well, and the baseball bat wasn't much help, so we gave up. Until the next adventure, Larry

      The life of a journalist. From designing pages to writing stories journalists do it all. For our new 44 page feature magazine I have 3 stories and 4 pages to design, a little rough. But still I love it. You get to meet so many new people, and so many more people know who you are just through your writing. I've had people come up to me and say,  "hey your larry buchanan? I've read some of your stuff." I really like that feeling, and I think thats why I love journalism.

      It all started when Ryan and I were sitting in my room with nothing to do. Jenna Wise had just left and we were left alone. We went upstairs and started annoying my parents... and in the words of my father, "Get out and ride your bike or something." So that's what we did. And our adventure began. And so it was... about 10:04 when we embarked on this epic journey. AT first our goal was ice cream... at the local DQ, but then a tasty buger from McDonald's became our new objective (really because we didn't wanna cross 14). With only 12 dollars, a few candy wrappers, and my wallet full of crap in our pockets, we set out for that burger. The time 10:16 p.m. when we arrived at McDonalds. Lights were still on and the hours on the door said they were open 'till 11. But as it turns out that the little black guy inside was closing early, about 45 minutes early. So, I stared him down, as Ryan watched in dismay. He eventually backed while I still rapped on the window. So I was a little cheesed off at McDonalds, which obviously isn't Wendy's, where you can eat great, even late... cuz it wasn't even late yet. But anyway, so Ryan had brilliant revalation - chili dogs at DQ. We crossed 14 and made it to our new destination only to find a killer deal, 2 chili dogs for 2.22. So we bought 4, and 2 small drinks... and those drinks were expensive... I'm talking like 2 bugs a piece, for like 16 ounces.. yea it was bull crap, but anyway. The lady asked us if we wanted to donate a dollar to charity, and we were already running low on money... but luckily Ryan spoke up and of course we donated a dollar. In return, we have cool little cone with our names no it on the wall at DQ. Our chili came out, all nice a neat on the tray, and we being the adventurous type decided to eat outside. After Ryan spilling chili dog all over himself we threw away our trash and were going to go back inside to give the tray back... but the doors were locked. So I proceeded to do a little dance outside the door to get the lady to come over and take the tray. Finally she did and we were off.... we set out for home. It was now about 10:37 and we thought we were going home, until gas station candy caleld our name. We were now down to 3 dollars and 70 cents... but luckily gas station is very fairly priced. A king size Resse's and a box of mild duds, and we were down to to 95 cents. Not too shabby. So finally we were settin out for home, but not before another pit stop. It was now 10:48 and were riding back down the cart paths in the complete dark. And there is this huge hill that we couldn't really see... but we got down that ok. Our final pit stop was the Wise's house. As we proceeded to their door we saw Mrs. Wise really high window in the front. She was hanging some picture or something, but we went in to see if Jordan was home yet. Mr. Wise said he was just leaving to pick him up. So Ryan and I went into the computer room and talked to Jenna for a little bit, then Jordan came home. He kinda poked his head into the computer room with a little grunt, "oh hey... you guys are here.." and proceeded to go upstairs. so we left. And treked backwards down the golf course back to my back yard.

      I think it has been about 4 days since I have started this site, maybe a little more, but it is amazing too see how many people actually look at it. I have had my cousins in Philadelphia and Ohio tell me they've seen it, my uncle, my grandparents (both sets), and a ton of friends, some of who I haven't talked to in a very long time. So the internet really is a "web", and a world wide one at that... it's a small world, after all.   Random Thought: I wonder if people in like Japan are looking at this and saying, "woo sho ju fing le." i dunno what that means but it sounds kinda cool =)

      Somehow we always end up at my house. By "we" I mean all of my friends and by "always", well I mean always. Whenever there is nothing else to do its off to Larry's, or when a party is over at someone elses its over to Larry's. I don't really mind it though, it's just my house isn't even that exciting. Sure I have the coolest parents in the world a pretty neat room and a lot of good music, but thats really about it. It's just a really relaxing atmosphere and all we do is sit around play songs and chill. All 5, 10 or 50 of us, however many are here. I have to admit, I do like it though.

      It was freezing outside, but not cold enough to close the pool. So Kevin brought Burger King for lunch to the pool and he, TP, and I ate lunch outfront of the pool and talked about our upcoming movie (a later blog), inspired by  Napolean Dynamite.  So anyway, after that Allison and Katie Thomas came to the pool and we went swimming. Why, I do not know, cuz it was cold. But yea, good day. We played chicken and TP got nailed in the face... like 5 times. It was great.

       urlLink    Playing the guitar rocks. Not only for the chicks, but because no matter how stupid or dorkish you are, playing the guitar automatically makes you cool. And because music rocks (see "Drugs, sex, but most of all, Rock 'n Roll." - 6.30.2004). But I got this guitar, from my uncle who said he would never use it. It was a great way to score a free guitar, and a real nice one at that. But mine is blue. urlLink

      With football practice (2-a-days), lifeguarding, writing for a magazine, student government, and school beginning to get started again I've got a lot to do. I was talking to Annie Baenen about it and she put it in the best way that I can think of. She said, "I just wish I was bored." Which is kind of ironic, because when you're bored you don't want to be bored any more. But now, I would just love to be bored. So when you're bored, cherish it.

      It's been awhile since the last post, because I've been on the East Coast for a week. Ocean City, New Jersey. Everyone always asks me what do I do there? besides going to the beach. And I always say its like real life version of  Rocket Power  (that Nickelodeon show). We hang out on the beach, ride the waves, go to the boardwalk, golf, ride rideds. Its awesome. And when you're with my family, that just makes it ten times better. Even though sometimes they do get annoying, like my drunk Grandpa playing Scrabble with me at 1 in the morning asking if "P-E-W-E-R" is a word, over and over and over again. But, it was really fun. I'll have some more blogs about it later, but that's about all for now.
