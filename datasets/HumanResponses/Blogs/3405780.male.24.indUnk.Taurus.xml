      There are times when something comes my way where I literally say to myself, ‘Oh boy, I sure didn’t need to hear that.’ Well, it’s been that way recently. But it has been the norm when we experience such breakthroughs, things will begin to come our way. It’s  test time, plain and simple. I’ve had the opportunity to learn from God’s Word, and now the time has come to apply it.  Well this is the case at this present time. I must continue to endure a situation which I am beginning to feel is a dead horse, but I know otherwise. It takes a lot of my patience; I’ve been dealing with it for years, hoping that the here and now is the time for breakthrough, but all signs point otherwise. Still, I am continuing in faith, that I will not become disenheartened in this situation.  Today’s verses: “  31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: 32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

      Well, I will keep it short and sweet tonight. I had neck pain so I took something for it, which has an added sleep ingredient so I will be off to bed soon. Today was ok, a little slow, but ok. There is a tornado warning west of here but I'm not going to sweat it. If it kills me, I'm ready to meet my maker. :-)     Today's Verse:   "Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."  Matthew 5:10

      Well I said I was going to fall back on  Blinx  when  Shenmue II  got a little tiring, but  Shenmue  is turning out to be a very demanding game. I want to always see what is around the next corner so I can't stop playing. When I play I mean. The last couple of days have been good church days so I've been easing along...*wink wink. ;-) I feel so great, like I haven't felt in a long time. I am on a new level of glory I believe, the joy of salvation has been restored in my life.  On another note I am a bit disappointed. The G4TV/TechTV merger became official today. They do have some interesting shows I will have to look into, but I will miss  Call For Help.   I'm probably annoying somebody out there with the italicizing of these words, huh?

      I have quickly gotten tired of a little opening I see too often, it's only a couple of  words but they irritate me.    'So I blah blah blah...'   So I this, so I that. In case you didn't get it yet, I am talking about the " So I " part.   Oh well. I just read something to that effect just now, so I thought I'd write about it.

      Well, now that I have better composure, I can more in detail describe my pain last night. I thought I was getting a migraine, it's been about 10 years since I had (my only) one. I had a deep ache especially in the front of my head and was sick to my stomach, though I was not sensitive to sound or light. I finally went into deep sleep about 4 this morning and since then have not had a big problem.  We went to hear Evangelist George Wright tonight. It was an amazing service and I was glad to go. I am fired up for next week, when I minister for Wednesday's services.    "For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.   For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.     Psalm 18:28, 29

      Well, I want to be regular in posting entries here, so in spite of my condition, which I will get to later, I will tell about tonight.  The lady I mentioned in a previous post was at my church tonight. I really enjoyed it.  After services on the way home, I broke out into a sweat and was overcome with a headache and nausea, which I still have. So I will now go to bed.

      As I am writing this entry, I look out my window and can see/hear the squirrels in the mulberry tree right outside my window. I have the window open. It’s one of those days where it is not really hot enough to turn the air conditioner on, but it is humid enough to make one sweat, namely me.   I can stand both cold and hot, but I guess you would call me more hot natured. For me, the ideal temperature would probably be 70 instead of 72.  This is just a filler entry, I suppose. There is stuff going on, but I don’t want to get into details in a public area.

      Some can't grasp the concept of both beauty and devotion. They jump to the assumption that if, for example, a song is overly fancy or beautiful, then the person must be doing it for the wrong reason or just to get noticed. I would have to ask: Is it possible that a person could sing a song and be both beautiful/anointed?   Well, that's a little off topic. I am listening to a version of  Amazing Grace  being sung by a lady, who I think is Swiss. She has a nice voice, a deep motherly tone. This song is truly blessed, especially coming from such a person. You can tell if a person is singing for fun, to entertain, or an expression of worship. This lady loves the Lord.  This song has given me strength and encouragement tonight. I recently became aware that I hit a brick wall with a certain situation before me, but I am now confident that God will see me through. I will admit that it was a struggle for me, bur I am determined to keep on marching through. I was tempted to go off the wall about it, but I know that it is in the Lord's hands. To Him be all the glory, He will see me through.

       Yes, the gamer in me is coming back to life, after a near fatal experience from my absence from the Xbox.  This is shameful to admit, but since Shenmue 2 arrived yesterday, I’ve been devoting my spare time to it. I’ve accomplished a lot already, but from what I read I’ve probably only scratched the surface. It’s not as deep as I was anticipating, but it is still good. I suppose what I was expecting isn’t really doable on today’s consoles anyway. But it is a great game.  Once I need a breather from Shenmue, I still have Blinx for a more lighter-hearted game experience.  Heh heh.

      I am looking forward to this upcoming week. My original pastor from here in Locust Grove will be ministering at our church this Wednesday night. I haven't heard her regularly in services since 1998 and don't really get to see her too often. Both she and her husband are dear people I respect very much.  I consider them spiritual parents. I have my own natural parents, and they are still with us, thank the Lord. But as spiritual parents, my former pastors taught me so much. They saw and nurtured the call I had on my life, even before I fully realized it myself. They are completely genuine.  Through them, I was able to see the plains, the mountains, and the valleys of the ministry. They were great examples to me, taking it all in stride, and fully trusting the Lord in it all. If they were not the great, God-fearing and God-loving people that they are, I could very well still be out in the world, lost and without hope. It was because of their warm welcome that I decided to return to church, and soon after I gave my life to the Lord Jesus Christ. What a wonderful experience that both was and is.   If you just happen to be in my area and are interested, take a look  urlLink here  for details.

      The final episode of M*A*S*H* was rerun tonight on television. Still one of my favorite shows, the final episode can still bring somber feelings. Compounding this feeling is the conclusion of  Call For Help , a great show that said its final goodbyes this Friday. Here is what I published on my website, which of course is now gone itself:    I’m a frequent viewer of the channel TechTV. The station is currently in the process of merging with G4TV to produce G4/TechTv. Well in the past I’d hoped to see what G4 was all about, with all the gaming shows (not game shows), so I admit that I was curious and a little optimistic about this merger.   Knowing the details, it’s a little hard to swallow now. In fact, people from all around are choking (and choking up). If you don't want to take my word for that, read the TechTV message boards.  G4/TechTV is focusing on a specific demographic: Gamers. Not tech buffs and gamers, gamers only. Though TechTV wasn’t a major network (a lot of people probably haven’t even heard of it), it was aimed at technology in general. Shows for newbies, gamers, tech news, etc. It seems that G4 is the senior partner in this merger, because some of TechTV’s very lifeblood is being drawn out, namely Call For Help, one of my favorite shows.  Needless to say, I am bummed about this decision.  I know you'll never read this, but thanks for some great memories, Leo.    Q said it best in the final episode of Star Trek: TNG -  "All good things must come to an end."

       urlLink I visit this site occasionally  as it usually has some interesting videos in it. I look for stuff like this when I'm kinda swamped and need to relieve some stress.  The reason I am mentioning it now is because there is a couple of interesting videos on it, both 'kids'. The SWK, or Star Wars Kid is good, I've seen plenty of them over time, variations which are always springing up somewhere, but I have to admit, there arent' too many that make me laugh like the first time I saw it.   The second one that I am referring to, Aicha Kid, is a little weird. I don't know if this was a secret project originally like the SWK or what. But it is worth a look. I didn't go hysterical with laughter, but it was good for a smirk or two. ;-)

      My name in Hebrew can means something like, "Yah (God) will rise" or "Whom Yah (God) exalts". I don't believe your name will dictate your future, but I believe generally that your name is from God. I say generally because I am reminded of an episode of Seinfeld where George comes up with, and wants exclusive use of a name. I think it was Shasta? Personally, I think if you are going to name a kid after a soda, you might want to name it after a higher-priced brand. Where I live, Shasta is a cheap (but good, though I never drink it) alternative to the bigger brands, like Pepsi or Dr. Pepper (my drink of choice).    Anyway, in my life I certainly do believe that God has blessed me and in the case of my name meaning, "Whom Yah exalts" it is true. I am a very reserved person, but I am friendly with others. All this favor from many just falls in my lap. I will have faith in the Lord to help me with some issues that will be coming later this week and into the future.   Yes, this was the 'typical' journal-type entry I was talking about earlier.   Yirmeyah (Jeremy)

      I've decided that I am not going to be working on a new website for myself. I've been too busy with other websites and life in general that it would be impractical to do both. I know that if the need should arise in the future I can certainly go back to a site, but not right now.  I'm actually quite apprehesive about doing this. After all, this will be the first time in over a year I'm officially without my own website. I feel like I'm losing an arm, so to speak...  But, I have this wonderful blog to fall back on. End of one chapter, beginning of another I guess. I suppose in reality the blog is better than going all-out for the website, since I didn't really need half the pages I had anyhow.

      I’m in the process of redesigning my website. It’s currently offline right now. Well I say that, but it’s acting as a redirect to my forum. I’ve exhausted myself creative-wise, in that I don’t know exactly how I am going to make my latest site work.  I’ve got ideas brewing in this noggin of mine, but how to make it come together in a way that is asthectically appealing to me is going to be the trick. I’ve said it once, and I will say it again: It’s difficult judging your own creations. I mean, once it’s finished you’ve worked with it so long that you are already tired of it.  Well, while all that is going on, I’ve been putting the good old Xbox to use again. I ordered  urlLink Shenmue 2 , which is to arrive any day now. I also ordered  urlLink Blinx: The Time Sweeper , which has arrived and I have been playing. I really like the game, but I figure a real-life cat can go much faster than Blinx. But, he’s wearing clothing and boots, so you’ve got to figure that will slow a cat down (pun intended :-))  Tomorrow's entry will probably be a typical journal entry. For me it will be typical anyway. But there will be a variety of different entries. Without my website, I have to have some place to put ideas and stuff.  Right?

      I think many in my position ask themselves the same question. In fact, I know they do. I saw it today on a television commercial.    "Do I suffer with these allergies, or get relief and get K.O.'ed?"   I chose the former for so long. You see, it was just easier to carry tissues with me than to try and feign alertness whilst in the hazy world that most antihistimines take you to.  I've tried all the OTC meds. Nothing helped me. I'd tried a certain $20+ medicine that boasted 24-hour relief.  Thank the Lord for off-brands.  Claritin didn't seem to help me that much. I started taking the generic version this week, and lo and behold, it's helping! Now that's not to say that I am no longer affected by seasonal allergies, but they are no doubt more bearable. What's now some slight sniffling and an occasional sneeze was only a week ago a fit of sneezing, coughing, watery eyes and making the tissue companies rich.  Now I make the generic-Claritin maker rich...  Hmm...

      I'm back and hopefully better than ever. I don't know how many people will end up reading this, but for those who do, I hope to help out your day with perhaps a laugh, a word of inspiration, something like that.   Let's do it!   Last time I had a blog, I didn't have the time or the content to work on it, but things are such now that I have daily time to spare. Yes, times are in constant change, and both my outlook and I are as well.  What to talk about..Hmm...well, I know already, or I would not have started this thing. The new me has a vision. The new me doesn't recklessly jump in headfirst in everything. The new me is cautious, but still spontaneous enough to know when it is worth taking a risk.  So what am I going to be talking about? You'll just have to keep checking in...

      Sometimes things just get too complicated, it can nauseate one thinking about it. Such is the case with me. As noted in previous entries, a lot has happened lately, so I am sometimes feeling a bit mentally overwhelmed. Not desperate by any means, but I've had better days.  I am in the middle of a situation that quickly got complicated. As per my personality, I've been fretting all day, thinking of a way to solve this problem.   First thing is first, I need to devote myself to prayer. If you read this, feel free to pray for me. :-)

      WWE sure likes to alienate it's established fanbase. I remember during the 'Attitude' era the leigons of 'old' old-schoolers who decided to give the then-WWF the ol' 'heave-ho'.   Well, I must admit that WWE is greatly trying my patience. Since the demise of WCW, WWE has rested on it's laurels and told the wrestling audience, 'You're gonna sit back, take what we give, and like it, because we're the only game in town.'  I thought I'd never say this, but I am beginning to think I can live without pro-wrestling if it's going to be WWE's version of it from now on. Around the time of WCW's purchase in 2001, I was one of Vince McMahon's diehard followers. Through various means, ridiculous and excessive storylines, stuff I could find somewhere else (like skimpy ladies), wasting talent, and dropping the ball with the mother-lode of angles in the WCW & ECW, WWE has lost my respect.   WWE, you may as well get the 2nd 'W' out, because you are certainly not about wrestling anymore. You make me sick.

      I mentioned in a previous post that the Lord would see to my situation. If I were not a Christian, I would have to say that I seriously 'lucked out' about some things. But I don't believe in luck, I believe in the power of prayer, to none but the Holy Father (God, not the pope) through Jesus Christ.   1. A situation is coming together for me. I may get into it later, then again I may not. Suffice it to say that this was looking quite impossible. God worked out all the details behind the scenes and for that I am grateful and happy.  2. God is my healer. I have trusted Him as such, and He has not disappointed. Situations that are impossible for me are possible for Him, and he has come through with flying colors.    O Lord, surround me with Your favor. Cause those mountains before me to crumble, that I may further Your kindgom with the help of Your Holy Spirit.  Amen.

      I didn't get to receive my weekly fix of  real  wrestling action today, yesterday, whatever. The satellite was acting up. I need to chop a tree down I think. The limbs are getting too long, but the bad part about the whole deal is that I would need something like a cherry picker to do it. The offending tree is one of the largest in the yard.   Went to revival tonight. I enjoyed meeting the visitors and all. I went in spite of the fact that I felt more like climbing into a comfy, comfy bed and snoozing the night away.  Seems a bit ironic then that I am still awake. But that's how it goes. I really need to be praying about something right now, so I will get off this thing.

      Since I am limited on time, and I feel the obligation to keep this blog up to date, since I've already done a fair amount of writing last night, I would post it. It's the first of my 'rants', I'm not the kind of person who regularly does them, but there it is below.    urlLink From JBackwater.tk    I, along with many webmasters out there, was recently rebuked by a certain other webmaster for making a faux paux in my website design. The writer was very condescending and arrogant with his views. He praised his own website for being simple and having a color scheme that is ‘easy on the eyes’. According to him, my white background makes you think you are staring into a light bulb.   Well I admit that the white on black is easier on the eyes, it also has a different personality. Depending on the site, it can have a dark, lonely isolated feel to it, even if that is not the creator’s intention. The argument against white background sites is that the creator is attempting to reproduce the effect of paper. What‘s the basis of that argument? I use the layout that I use because I think it looks good, not because I am trying to fool a person into thinking there is a piece of paper that suddenly materialized on their monitor. If you want to bawl people out about this, look for those sites that use the notebook paper backgrounds with the handwriting fonts, and leave me alone.  I believe my site is easy on the eyes. There are no colors that scream at you, they all blend together nicely. The fonts are small, but not too small that you can’t read them. I agreed with the writer on the point that the super-small fonts that are so popular nowadays are hard to read. Also, for the benefit of those who are on dial-up, I kept the images and other slow-loading bells and whistles to a minimum. I am on dial-up myself, and I recently visited a site whose pages took about 2 minutes to load because of all the JavaScript in it. They are lucky I had the window open in the background, because I would not have given it the time of day any other way.  The final point I’d like to make is this: The writer kept singing the praises of Google, saying how it keeps it’s position of the greatest, most used search engine even with it’s simple layout. I agree. That is the reason I use Google. I don’t need all the news and stock info that you find on other search homepages. But...  Did you happen to take a gander at Google’s color scheme, Einstein?   No, perhaps not. You were too busy “staring into light bulbs.”

      Well, things are slowly looking up. I held on to my faith, and I believe that the Lord is going to work things out like He usually does. This is not to say that I am in the clear, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I made this comment during my last preaching message: 'We are running a race for a prize. Your enemy seeks to break your legs, but the promise of God stands in his way. You also have your own self to deal with, the fatigue, the utter exhaustion, but you keep going because your eyes are on that prize. Yes, the goal causes you to overlook the pain and discomfort you are in and urges you on. Your body says, 'let's quit' but there is something inside you that says, 'let's go all the way!'  The enemy certainly has tried to break my legs so to speak, but I do see the tide changine. All praise and glory be to God my Savior.

      I went and made this big post last night, but for whatever reason, it didn't take, and when I used the back button, all my content was gone. No biggie, I will just condense it, because there was a LOT of information.  I watched INA wrestling for the first time Friday. It is like night and day compared to WWE. I've been a WWE loyalist most of my life but they are severely stretching my patience and I am glad to see a promotion (TNA) actually treating wrestling like a sport again, not a 'sports-entertainment' soap opera. Now it does have elements of SE, but not to the extent that WWE does. The TNA show, Impact, is a one hour show, and right of the top of my head, I can recall at least 5-6 matches. On a WWE one hour show, you would be lucky to get 3, due to the fact that they are recapping their retarted storylines and doing useless segments. And they wonder why their ratings are on life support. Their solution: Put in more nudity, and add some interesting twists to the storylines. Give me a break, I don't watch wrestling to see skimpy women or stupid storylines. I watch to see  wrestling , but they can't get that through their stupid skulls.  I've got a lot to say about this, and I will continue later.

      WWE has long been trying my patience. Vince McMahon has stated that WWE isn't a wrestling company, but rather an entertainment company. He probably would have taken the acronym 'WE' had it not been taken by a women's channel. I've lost a ton of respect for the company. The only reason I haven't abandoned it completely is because they can still squeeze out a good match or two, in a mass of 'entertainment'. Personally for me, though, the wrestling was the most entertaining. Skimpy ladies aren't going to give me my wrestling fix. Sorry but it's true.   I watched NWA-TNA wrestling for the first time Friday, now that they thankfully are on a channel that I get. It's amazing wrestling, but I can't afford to cough up 10 bucks a week for it. The program and the federation scored major points with me in 1 hour, and here is how:  1. NWA Actually has  Wrestling!  I'd forgotten what a good wrestling match looked like! Sure, it's more 'futuristic' than traditional mat wrestling, but the fed treats the wrestling like a sport. And that's a big thumbs up for me.   2. It's Not Oozing Male Soap Opera Sure, it has elements of 'sports-entertainment', such as obviously scripted promos and dialogue, but at least 75+% of the show isn't being devoted to some storyline you have to be an absolute retard to believe. I've really missed just simple promos. Stupid WWE and their vignettes.  3. The Small Crowd. Maybe I'm alone in this, but I do miss the days of the smaller audiences. I remember at Raw's 10th anniversary they showed the (1st?) Raw with Razor Ramon and 1-2-3 Kid. The audience wasn't very big, they weren't filling up major arenas with vast multitudes (but then again, right now they aren't either) and I liked that. The audience at Impact brought back those warm nostalgic feelings.  You have to understand something. I was a steadfast defender of WWE just 2 years ago. Over time, they have managed to whittle most all of the loyalty away from me.   Now I know how the older generation felt during the introduction to the 'Attitude' era. WWE should really consider their stance as an 'entertainment company. Because if it continues on this same path, I will have no regret in ditching it. I think this is the attitude of many.

      More like at least a couple of weeks. After ending my site with Angelfire, I received a generous offer from a good friend, my best friend in fact. I am now in a new location, with a new, better design. Sure, it's not the best, and there are many better one out there, but I feel proud of it.   Perhaps it is because of the location alone, where I am among a close friend, and perhaps a bit of it is because I am under my original webhost, where it all started, I feel like I am back home.

      I've not blogged for a couple of days due to time and being busy and all. My allergies are slowly trying to catch up with me, I had to wear my glasses last night, which I haven't wore in some time. I only need them when things are really blurry, and that is a good thing, since they don't look good on me anymore. I got them in 1998, and just my appearance has changed to the extent that they look clunky on me.   Maybe it's style, or how my tastes and style have becomed a bit more refined, but I would not wear them in public anymore unless I had to.   On a more solemn note, I was glued to the TV yesterday watching the procession of Reagan to the Capitol building. The trek up the stairs was actually the most difficult part to watch. As the Battle Hymn of the Republic played, tears welled in my eyes and I choked up. There is always a point when someone dies, at least for me, when it finally sinks in. The surreal shock beforehand suddenly vanishes, and we get our rude awakening. For some, it's seeing the coffin, or watching the departed being lowered into the ground. For me it was the music. The hymn will never be the same for me again.   Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord    Revelation 14:13

      Of course it is to be expected that there were hypocrites in the days of Christ, seeing as this is where Christians get the term, ‘Pharisee‘. But you would think that after the passage of so much time, we would begin to grasp the message, the meat of what Christ was saying, yet many people still miss the point entirely.  Matthew 23 is a very interesting chapter that many just can’t seem to grasp. The fact is, if you aren’t ever offended by it, I’d think you were in denial or just plain dense. At times, every person has shown a bit of the old hypocrite in themselves, but only a few realize it and seek to eliminate it from their lives.   The danger of the Christian life is that there are some things that can be taken as such that over time it loses its meaning and becomes nothing but a ritual, something done only through habit. We must be careful that our worship does not proceed down this path. People take comfort in rituals; this is nothing new. We get up every day at the same time, do the same things to some degree, and when that rhythm is upset, we are thrown for a loop.   Pharisees took comfort in their ritual. In fact, this comfort went unto the point that their salvation depended upon it rather than the condition of their heart. They were careful to obey the smallest letter of the law, yet missing the message that it was trying to convey.   I suggest that you read Matthew chapter 23 in light of this. You may find it very interesting. I know I did, particularly this verse:   “Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.”    Matthew 23:24

      When I come here just about every day it often looks like I wait for days before making another entry. The fact is that I just write at very early and late hours so it can look like 2-3 days went by when they really didn’t. I’m just making an observation...  Well, things are ok right now, I am up late with stomach problems though. Other than that, I am well and feeling quite good actually. I guess in reality this time could better be described as bittersweet. I’ve been quite solemn since hearing of the death of Ronald Reagan. It didn’t hit me as hard as I thought it would, but I figure it will become harder as it sinks in. He was a great man, one that I have the highest of respect for.  Sometimes we just have urges. Mine as of late have just been to pray. Sometimes I don’t know how to pray. Perhaps it was times like this that Jesus Christ gave us the Lord’s prayer.   Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever. Amen.    Mr. Reagan said in 1988:  “...When I saddle up and ride into the sunset it will be with the knowledge that we’ve done great things. We kept faith with a promise as old as this land we love and as big as the sky. A brilliant vision of American as a shining city on a hill. Thanks to all of you, and with God’s help, America’s greatest chapter is still to be written, for the best is yet to come.”   God Bless You, Mr. President.

      I suppose everyone knows the news about President Ronald Reagan's passing.   President Reagan was truly one of a kind. Though I was too young to appreciate it all, he is in my mind the greatest President of modern history.  May God bless you, Mr. Reagan. Amen.

      No biggie, same old  I guess. I ministered Wednesday, went ok.  Not too much going on. I happened upon a forum where they were debating the use of instruments in wotship. 'What's the big deal?' I thought. The deal is that since the use of instruments isn't mentioned in the NT, it's not applicable anymore. Psh. Those people love to pick and choose that, don't they? Divine spiritual gifts  are  for the today, and  are  in the NT, but for whatever reason, they "aren't for today."  Whatever.  Well, here's my take on it, but it's from the OT:   1   Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. 2   Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness. 3   Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. 4   Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs. 5   Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. 6   Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.    Psalm 150

      Just when I thought Angelfire inflicted as much torture on me as they could, first cutting off images without notice, a stupid stack overflow error that took over 3 months for them to fix, then problems with their ads. Now they have the nerve to add a blasted search bar to the left! When is this going to stop!?   I suppose Angelfire thinks that people are just going to sit idly by and watch more and more ads imposed upon them. They should understand that people will only get pushed so far, and yes, I consider this being pushed. I understand that it's their space, and that they have the right to impose all this junk all over the page, but IF I WANT TO DO A STUPID SEARCH ON THE PAGE I AM VISITING, I ALREADY HAVE ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF SEARCH BARS ALREADY IMBEDDED IN MY BROWSER! I DON'T NEED YET ANOTHER SEARCH FEATURE!   To my knowledge, many already abandoned their Angelfire sites when they left us all in the lurch concerning the image deal. I hope many others protest this crap in their own way.

      The wonders of God’s grace are truly without boundary. I sit here late at night listening to the song “Just As I Am”, a song that we traditionally think of as an invitational song for the sinner. But I have enough to assume that from the newborn in Christ to the old-horses, there is an invitation to come deeper, to be nourished directly from the Presence of God.   I at this moment, even with the present and immediate cares and genuine concerns that I have in life, do feel drawn closer to the Lord. It is something that I need, even more than a junkie needs his fix. To me, the life that the Holy Spirit brings to me is more valuable that breath itself.   As the song says,  “And that thou biddest me come to thee, O Lamb of God, I come, I come!”  "Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost. Why spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy? Listen, listen to me, and eat what is good, and your soul will delight in the richest of fare.”    Isaiah 55:1-2

      Being unusual is not a complaint. It's just an obeervation. Work could have been cut very short today, the electricity in the whole area was down. This happened twice, and had it happened a third time, I would have been making this entry a lot earlier. I guess the upper management would have allowed it, since they are the only ones who can make that decision.  When I came into work, I sat waiting for the shift to start and I received some interesting news. I had won a monthly drawing for a free $25 gift card. I wondered about it, since I thought maybe you had to enter the drawing, but I guess being an employee you are automatically entered.  So I got home a few minutes later due to the wait. What to buy with it...hmm.....  I'd never really won anything before and having won it on the first opportunity was even better.  I went to work, not really having time to enjoy myself. I was hoping for a slow day. It didn't end like that, but at least I got a break. When the power went off, I just got to stand around and/or do whatever for about 45 minutes. A lot of people left because of the wait. That was nice while it lasted.  In my last entry I mentioned another who I've been having a hard time with. I've had a change of heart. The person is no different, really, but I just can't stay mad. That's not me. In some weird way, I feel sorrow for them. I simply cannot repay evil for evil. I consider it wrong that they are unfriendly, but I am not going to sink to that level for satisfaction.  Long entry. I'm off to bed now.  - _ -

      My experience at my new job is bittersweet. Of course the money is the sweetest part, most of my coworkers are sweet, so to speak. They are great in my department at least. As for the bitter, it seems that the place is made up of cliques, each department mingling with those similarly dressed. Thats alright with me. I didn't join to talk or socialize.  A certain person of another department has been less than flattering. I make every attempt to be friendly, but whether this person is just full of themself or whatever, the favor is not returned. I have my feelings for this person, but I am attempting to put that aside and just live with it, hard as it can be.

      I am adjusting to my new job as well as can be expected, there isn't a lot to it, but there are some parts that are just hard on my back. I move a lof of heavy stuff around and it can get to me, but I guess in general it's all ok. After all, I'm in it for the $$$ anyhow. ^_^ &nbsp; I received word that my time will change after Thursday. It will all be fine and good, I will be able in the sunshine other than the early morning, but I'm already meeting and getting attached to new friends who have been very supportive. They are so new, in fact, that I don't remember their names. @_@ &nbsp; Thursay was my first day. It's all ok, but the bad parts are: (1) To save on money and gas until I get paid, I am riding with my father, who starts at 2:30 and my shift begins at 4; (2) I would be driving there on my own now, but I am not the best (read: I am a terrible) driver and I have to merge both ways, which I've never had to do before now, and am terrible at.

      I am officially employed in my new job, though I have not officially begun it. This week was a week of tests, and it is going to end with me working, and will be working into mid-next-week. It is going to be tiring I expect, but as it has been said, it is better to be worn from work rather than worn from doing nothing. Not to say I wasn't busy before, but now it will be more consistent.   Even if it turns out I don't like it (doubtful because of the atmosphere), I can't afford to quit with my new transportation *wink

      I'm waiting to hear some news. In the meantime, I didn't really celebrate the 4th, which was Sunday of course. It's not that I could not, I really didn't want to. No, I am not depressed or anything like that, it's just that as I've grown older, my outlook for such days has changed.  If you are reading this, hello, how are you doing? I really don't have a lot to say, so I will just ramble. I've been playing Shenmue 2 again. Though I know the story now, it has a lot of extras which give it a great replay value.   Lousy seed-ticks...I hate to see animals suffer, and even most bugs, but I think I'd take pleasure in watching them suffer, along with flies, mosquitoes, and those gnats that fly around your face.

       urlLink Sportsman Acres Fellowship  is under a new color scheme that is a bit easier on the eyes. I didn't get complaints, but now you shouldn't have a reason. I'll do the fine tuning next opportunity I get.  Check it out if you are interested.

      I am so tired right now. I had hoped to attend church in the morning but I don't think that will be happening. I have to catch up on my sleep which I will be doing in a little while. Work went ok today I guess.  Coming home, I hit a roadblock. I'd wondered what it would be like, having to deal with the police. I'd asked myself if I would be nervous, but I guess working around the armed security at my job tempered me for it. After all, they are actual reservists, not just rent-a-cops. I was completely calm, which I didn't think about until afterwards. I even made small talk. But since I didn't get much sleep today, my mind hasn't been with me 100%.

      Well it's coming upon my usual weekday bedtime but for a day-off bedtime it is a bit late. I've got tons I want to do tomorrow before work; some of it is more important than other things, but hey, if I can't enjoy myself a little then what's the point?  At my new job, we get paid biweekly on Thursdays. So I got paid today, I've already dished out the cash for the car payment, and so I will be saving a bit for the insurance, but for now, I can splurge. I'll have to factor in for food and gasoline for the next couple of weeks, but still I think I can enjoy myself a bit. I want to start a checking account, but I'm planning to wait until things level out before I do that, which should be in a month or two.  I won't be able to attend the Cherokee National Holiday this year because of work, which is kind of a downer, but I haven't been in many years, so I can live with that. I very much would have liked to go, but it's not looking good in the future for that.  I'm beginning to see how the job's taking a toll on me. During church, I've had to learn to keep occupied with writing at times to stay awake. It's not boring at all, but lately when I become idle I get sleepy. It's easiest to doze off during a special song, as there is nothing to do but close your eyes and listen.  I suppose I am going to have to verify a possible error I made in a form I completed. I won't go into details with that, but it could have an effect in the future if not resolved.  Slowly I am getting the hang of the days in relation to my workweek. For example, I can more quickly say that it's Thursday (actually Friday), but it's my Sunday. Friday (today) I will go back to work ( shudder ), but with the friends I have there it is bearable. I may transfer as soon as I can, which some of them have the intention of doing also, but I certainly hope we are able to continue the relationships that we have achieved thus far. I'm very fond of these new friends, and I hope that the feeling is mutual.  Well, I think I will try to go to bed now.

      Last night was a really tough ride. I am certainly surprised that I am here in one piece like this. We barely made it, but we did make it, and that is what counts. They told us that there was going to be a lot of people, but a more accurate description would be a sea of humanity. Yes, it was that packed. Had I had the disregard for other human life and comfort, I could very well have walked on this sea, in an ode to the Lord. I very much would have liked it because of the impoliteness of some of them. I mean, a guy's coming through, and he's got something heavy, and he's waiting for you to move... Don't you think you ought to do the decent thing and move the couple of inches? Apparently not.  I don't say that just for me. I say that on behalf ot the other workers that were shafted also.  So we made it through a night of torment. It's over, time to move on.  I subscribed to a couple of TechTV's newsletters last year, and since the merger between G4 and TechTV, I must admit that I don't read them much anymore, partly because of time. I opened one of the newsletters today and G4/TechTV's design is very different from the days of good old TechTV. In fact, I consider the current layout a big step down from what it used to be. The emails are mostly text, which isn't too bad, but it's just so  plain.  The website itself takes forever to load because of all the large images and animations they put on it, none of them useful.   The site has one of my most hated annoyances on it, there are probably worse sites out there, but this is the worst I've encountered lately: Big images take up most of the screen, and they are links. Sometimes when a page loads, for whatever reason it's not in focus, so I have to click on the page to be able to scroll with my mouse wheel. So because of these gargantuan links, I have to move the mouse all over, looking for one small piece of real estate that won't take me to an ad or some page I care nothing about. See what I mean  urlLink here.

      The new uniforms are very different from the old ones. They fit alright except for the shoulder area is tight. The worst part about them is that they don't breathe. This became too obvious yesterday as I had my toughest day to date. The day was busy, and nothing I couldn't handle, but because the shirt doesn't ventilate very well, I was hot most all of the day. I was hitting it hard at about 10 p.m., and barely made it through the remainder of the night. Hence the title of this post, "Carry me home in a casket."  I am very pleased that today is my Friday. However, with all the stuff here at home that needs to be caught up on, I doubt that this will be a very relaxing two days off. But as long as the check comes, I can't complain too much I guess. However I am thinking that our superiors are demanding a lot of us. None in my department like the new clothes. The look is  tolerable , but the functionality is minimal. I'm glad I look decent in blue. At least it isn't a chicken or hot dog promotional-type suit. Thankfully we don't do that kind of thing.

      Now I am not the most tech-savvy person around, but I am always glad that I can find my way around concerning computers and technology in general. At work I listened to some talk about technology, and I often have to bite my tongue, because a part of me wants to correct the person(s) in their erranious talk. Maybe I should have: I am gentle and understanding. Perhaps they could see the light from me instead of the annoying know-it-alls who would not hesitate to guffaw at first chance.  Maybe you should disregard that paragraph up there. I know how to operate computers, but as for the inner workings, there is plenty that eludes me.  I'm a little down tonight. Maybe it's just from the overload today.  To my credit, today went well. I made a bit less than $2 in tips, but for someone like me, and my position, that is something. I worked alone and thus it was my time to shine. I was even told that one of the high-ups would be hearing of my exceptional work. Still, I am down. I guess it is because it's finally sinking in that my old routines aren't mine anymore. I no longer have the freedoms I enjoyed a month ago. Plus I don't like the drive to work. I've been wondering if it is going to be worth it, with gas and all. At current rates, gas would be about $60-70 for two weeks. Man, when you think about it, that is a big chunk of change.  The people I have the privilige of working with are the ones who make an otherwise monotonous job bearable. This fondness that I have for them exceeds departments. God bless them every one.  Today will be the first day of wearing our new uniforms. This should be interesting.
