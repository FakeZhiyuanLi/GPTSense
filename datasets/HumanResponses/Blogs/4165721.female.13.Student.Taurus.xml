       something just doesnt make sense...i cant place my finger on it but for some reason the world actually seems happy. which i suppose is a good thing, but then nothing ever stays happy, nothing ever ends good, so eventually all this happy stuff will leave and we'll be left with the rest of the crap. eh..oh well, ive lived a lifetime of that crap whats a little more? sorry, bringing down the happiness, wanna make that last as long as possible!

       You let me drift away   Watching from afar   You stand there   Waiting for me to dissapear   You make no movement   No handmotion of goodbye   You just let me drift away      Ill make one last gesture   Begging for forgivenss   Just saying goodbye   I salute you   You've let me drift away

       Hope is slowly puring out   Faith, will too eventually leave   While darkness comes creeping quickly   And love drains out just as fast   Loneliness is settling in   Inspiration will soon give out   And evil will win   All happiness must go,   Eventually

      ya know, little kids can really boost your self esteem. really, its like they look up to you so they always wanna be aournd you and they want to sit next to you and if you ask them how you look they tell you you look absolutly beautiful and they wanna do everything you do and its just sooo cool! especially when you feel really down about yourself and the world they help you realize taht there really are good things in life and you sort of notice things more when you're around them. i odnt know, at least thats how i feel when im hanging iwht my little cousin.

      I have no idea who to tlak to about anything at the moment...i was just told that the one person i dotn like is the one person who deosnt hate me. He told me that most of my friends despise me and looking back, maybe i do see of a few hints of this. I guess i jsut wanted things to be good and all right so i just ignored what was really happeneing and i cant believe this...i actually thought people liked me. Who do you turn to when all hope is lost? when the person who doesnt hate you is the one you hate? when the people who you thought you knew and trusted secretly or obviously never really like you to being with? who do you turn to when you're all alone? i guess this blog is my only salvation left...
