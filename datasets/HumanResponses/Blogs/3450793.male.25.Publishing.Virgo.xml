      After work, I decided to find somebody to relieve my solitude, so I hopped into the Valyrie. It's a really nice place, have several, and, what's the most important I know the bartender. This gives me the exact aura I need to start a conversation easily enough. It worked really well today; after a half an hour, I already ordered a gintonic to a stunnigly pretty chick. She has long, curly, flaming red hair (most probably artificial - works for me well), green contact lenses, white skin and blue nails. To my astonisment, her clother were made at D-Mode; I never thought that anybody even heard about this small firm. That's why I am lucky to have an old friend who studies the fashion trends at the university - we usually work togather on some university project, so it was really easy to recognise the discreet logo just under the neck. (Of course, I don't teach regulary at the university, although, if there is some interesting project, I occasionally held master courses for three or four holomaker-wannabees.)  Back to the chick; she was really sleek, and I did my best. I payed for her drinks, I recognised her clothes - in twenty minutes we were talking about her underwear. At the exact moment I dropped in my being a holo artist. At midnight, she agreed to come up to my apartment to watch some of my new holos. I have to tell that I  am  a gentleman; if I promise to show my holos, I show my holos. If I promise to make a cofee, I do so. However, she was eager to have more...  By the was, the name is  Jitka . I have a suspicion that here name will be mentioned here...

      Yesterday night we were talking about my grandfather who was a famous "blogger" of his time - the blog was an old-fashioned, text-based diary kept on OpNet's precursor, on the Internet. Petr (my excentric friend, a remarkable musician and an awful cook) insisted on that the time of these old things has perished: the new technology has too much advantage to let them survived. So I started this diary - as you will see, it's mostly text-based. I am curious how much attention will it attract.  Today morning Lucas interrupted my working my computer - I was experimenting with flame-like, royal blue patterns. He seemed like longing for a chat, although he never looks like this without a hidden intention. He continued asking me about my advance in my abilities; I tried to look calm and conceal that I  do  feel somewhat distracted these days. I wonder wheter he could be fooled at all because he keeped getting on with the subject, and the end he  recommended  some intensive practice days. I am afraid he is right - in a week my new exhibition will be opened and than I will have the time.

       I wanted to post a comment and I had to create a blog. I already have one,  and  it's already mirrored to a somewhere else, so I feel like doing something different. This is the English-language chronicle of my interestingly boring life. I will not post too often however; my English is far more shocking then the  Necronomicon  and the Universe is horrible far enough without my babbling.   This morning I awoke wiht a real shock. Did you realise the Golden Rule of Partymaking? Today, I did. The earlier you start organising it, the bigger the probability the no one can come. Making some calls on the previous evening would be the best - a pity I don't have the guts.   Never mind. I will be twenty-six with or without a party.

      My grandma died yesterday. I feel really miserable - I have never felt like this since I was fifteen. She was really far from perfect, she had mistakes like everyone else, but she was a loving, caring grandmother and she was the wisest person I could turn with my problems. She especially understanding and helpful about the problems with my girlfriends. Now she is gone; this is the first time in my life I lost someone really important.  I think she was never able to understood the changes of our world - in the last fifteen years too many things happened and she did not have the patience nor the motivation to get on with it. She cared about her family - she wanted to spend as much time with us as possible; she always wanted to be the center of the family. She loved to be loved.  I hope I was one of the few people who understood him - in the last years it seemed to me that there were only a few of us that really cared what she had to say. I think I was really close to her. I was the youngest grandson of hers.  Small pieces of memories swirl inside me. I remember, when I was a kid, she lent a knitten sweater to me when I visited her at the weekend. Next day I wear it at school and I could feel her fragrance all day. Before my final examination at high school I went to her weekend house and she cooked my fauvorite meals for two weeks. I never had so much time to have a rest before. After the second day I did not even pretend learning.  I already miss her too much.

      It has been a long time since my confidence since to fade away about this little corner of mine in the world of English. Today, however I am full of energy so I decided to come back.  My ADSL connection is just fine. I am not an Internet addict, I just happen to spend four to five hours a day on the net. I decided to read some newspaper on the net instead of buying - this keeps me informed and keeps my eyes strained. It needs some training or some special glasses; or I have to buy a filter on my monitor.  I bought a new coffee-maker the day before yesterday; I utilized it today. The coffee was nice, apart of having the taste of metal. I hope it will improve with time.  I read  Gateway  from Frederick Pohl. A nice book, the storytelling it's a bit too complex (even the author seem to lost the track of his story), but the feeling is really cool and the character's are well-formed. It's a really good piece of cyberpunk, if you are not familiar with it, you should.  The birthday party was ok; I got a lot of presents from my friend, my cooking was decent and the game went on really fine. My Captain seemed to find her own style: the bard seems to fit her, she played wonderfully, even Balu had to admit it. To tell the truth,  everyone  played really fine, so I hope it was a good afternoon for everyone.  Colin bought  Starcraft  to me - this abandoned the remains of my free time. I think on new strategies even on the underground. (This, of course, makes me hard to advance with my new Joseph Heller novel,  Good as Gold . And you are right, it was Andrew's present.) I am a bit too thick to real-time strategy; I find myself too often stuck with a given situation and saving the game in every two minutes. The it appears that my entire concept was wrong, and I have to start over the entire scenario. The mood and the good graphics compensate me however.

      Yesterday night I made salad for supper.  Again.  I did this the third time this year - the reason I mention it because a few years ago, and especially last year I simply wasn't able to eat only bread and salad for any meal. First of all, I like my supper to be warm; secondly, I used to like my food containing enough calories for a  Tyrannosaurus rex : three paires of fried sausages with several slices of white bread and some icecream afterwards etc. This year I seem to be changed. I eat much more fruits and raw vegetables - I think it's a sign of ageing. Or maybe I am just too fat to eat more.  I spent the evening yesterday lightly: I read  God Knows  from Joseph Heller (a fascinating novel but I doubt it will get on my fauvorite books list), designed the tales for my Captain and for my birthday; I designed an alternative webpage of mine etc.  Today, I am waiting for some men from the phone company to create the conditions of my ADSL connections. I am looking forward to it very much, although my modem seems to be frightened from the possibility - it works unusually perfect these days.  I think it will be raining again today. I am fed up with this year's weather - the rising water level of the Balaton is the only thing that comforts me. I do not plan to visit it this year, but it's good to know that I will not be able to walk from Tihany to Siófok in the near future. (I wrote this paragraph because I had my first visitor from abroad. Well Guys, it's time to get the maps from the shelves. No offence meant, though.)

      I used to think that I am a pretty good Dungeon Master - I have severel dozens of told in several RPG's and few ended with the total frustration of the players. I always thought that there are no bad players just terrible DM's - and here I come, my Captain doesn't seem to be proceed with my tale.  I was having a bad feeling about this from the start: C. was uncertain whether or not she wants to be with a witch. I admit that it is one of the most complicated roles to play but it seemed quite fitted to her - perhaps I was wrong. I hope she will not give up because it's one of the best tales I have ever written - it's hazy, exciting and full of complicated plots.  Today I gave up my principles and had breakfast at Burger King. I feel the fat building inside me.   I hope the rest of the day will pass by more succesfully.

      Having Chinese food for lunch in a park is usually fun. It's  not  fun if the first portion of food you buy for your Captain is like shit, the second is too rich and the salad is too spicy and if the rain washes you two out of the park. I made an oath that I will never invite  anyone  for  anything  which is from a Chinese fast-food restaurant. I cannot see what large pieces of cooked cabbages are doing is Chinese food. "Non-fast-food" places are usually ok, however.  I had a very lazy afternoon. I planned to go to the library, but      It started raining heavily precisely at the moment I arrived home and ut stopped just now.    Today afternoon I found it out that it's an administrative impossibility (it's the highest rank of impossibility) for me to have a mark from the  theory of electronic texts , so there is no immediate use of reading about XML all evening.    I fancied to have a nap.      Algy made some minor modifications on his blog: it succesfully outgrew it's infernal babyhood and swiftly reached the lowest level of readibility.  I understood a gag in  Kill Bill:   "What about a dinner this evening?"   "Only on the condition that  I'll pay for everything ".

      Today I had a long walk - I  hate  waiting for more than two minutes for anything - and today I didn't have so much patience. The bus wasn't in the stop waiting for me so I decided to live healthy today.  Following in this line I had a cookie and a cup of milk today - I have been trying to lose some weight for a year, and I do not intend to give the minor results I was able to accomplish. It cost too much pain.   Maybe I will take up the custom of running again - doing sports is so  cool  and it would also silence my mother. On the other hand I could just make up stories of running every morning - it would be much more comfortable and would silence my mother too. But I doubt it would help loosing weight.   Once I run regularly; it wasn't bad, and it was  much  better than swimming, which is too wet for my liking. Actually I started running with a 16-mile-long race; I survived it so it was very easy to run 2 or 3 miles a week and it kept me fit. We finally have a very nice summer here; maybe it will help to win a battle in my constant war against my laziness.

      I could hardly stop laughing when I saw Cal with a huge, pink sweet in his hand on the excursion on Sunday. It was a really hilarius morning, I made many photos with my new camera and we walked as much as two miles - if it's not a heroic act I don't know what is. It was fun.   It  didn't  looked like fun when I arrived at the meeting point and was informed that El Diablo will join us in ten minutes - I don't really like the guy and I am sure that the feeling is absolutely mutual. However, we did not jumped at each other's throat - I kept talking about the only common topic, my favourite computer game,  Baldur's Gate .   Most of the time I found myself separated with my Captain. The others were full of adventuring spirit, took large loopholes on the road and didn't feel sick on the lookout tower - I, unfortunately, did.  I become unbelievably popular when I took a large piece of chocolate out of my (or, more precisely, my Captain's) pink backpack. We watched Cal's judo demonstration on Balu and Szabady - their childish spirits had to be restrained, and he was just the man for the job.

      I lost my job, the girl who almost became my boss behave like a bitch and humilitated me in front of forty people; my new boss is short-sited dictator; it's hot and my flat is on the top of the house so it's me who is shading his lower neighbours. But I acuired an electric fan so I am fine.    I flushed my Deibian distribution and tried Mandrake: it's far, far away from perfect, but earned a strong "satisfactory". I hope we will get used to each other.    I was away for roughly a week, and I can say that I had enough. If the company is right, than I have no problem with travelling - now the lack of good company was my key problem. I missed the time which I could spend alone contemplating on my situation.    I feel myself much better now. The future has changed but what could we ecpect from something so unreliable?

      Balu got through his final examination - since he is most probably listening, I don' want to give too much details. We started university together, I almost got my final examination on an other faculty where I fleed - he remained and won, though not unharmed.   My Linux project moved on a tiny bit - I cannot say I am out of the shit I jived into voluntarily, but at least I have some dim conception how to get on, so we will just see. By the way, CA, who I met today afternoon was  so  glad that I gave it up; he was really disappointed when I had to inform him that I started it over. Maybe I am just too proud (stupid) to admit that I have nor the knowledge nor the experience nor the wits to get on with such a comlicated piece of technology.  Today I hunted for a cell phone wich is compatible with my palmtop - I did not succeed, since the phone model I was looking for is kinda antique these days. I was so disappointed that I repaired my own in an instant when I arrived home. I have never done anything like this before, and it definitly seems that I succeeded; this means that I will be able to update my blogs when I am not at home or anywhere near proper civilization.  Tomorow I am going to travel far from  any  civilization so it will be very handy - don't worry I will keep you informed. It's two conferences and I think they will be really terrible. If I can choose whether I attend to these meeting or let somebody brake my toes with a 10-pound hammer, I would not hesitate to choose the latter. Seriously.

      I promise it is my last remark...     "It seems that Freeblog was unreachable for some time. We don't know from when and we don't know why - we just arrived back to Pest - but if we know, we will tell."      Well, guys  that's  what I call true professionalism!

      My Mum had business nearby and stopped to visit me. We talked, had lunch (yestarday's pasta was good today, too), and had a cup off tea.   It is interesting that I drink my tea hotter than my Mum. When I was a kid I had the impression that my parents start drinking it as soon as it's ready; I made serious - and succesul - efforts to follow them. Nowdays, when tea is ready, I am finished with it when the others were not able to have a single sip.

      I got stuck with my local mailserver, so I turned to Mr. Last Hope to fix my problems. He is really nice,  and  is an expert in Debian Linux; I already got the promise to look into my case in the afternoon.    urlLink Freeblog.hu  is back. No apologies... I think these guys are rank amateurs in polite serving of customers!

      Maybe it was a bit strong, but their server has been being down for a day and no one seem to notice this. If I had a huge blogserver, than I would make sure that somebody is taking care of it. Even at Sunday. Several of my friends blog became unreachable; I think it's much more than I should bear. I am seriously thinking on moving my blog to blogspot.com and forget about my origins.   It is especially annoying because they joined to the largest Hungarian portal only a week ago under the banner saying "we can use it's greater resources".   Go to hell!

      Well, today I seem  to be in an extraordinarily experimenting mood!     First, I got on with my Linux project with great speed. If I am correct, I will be able to update my blog in e-mail as soon as tomorrow!   I improved my "ham pasta" - it's in the oven now and it smells really good. I think the added smoked cheese will do it's intented job.   I washed almost all my laundry - not just the very clothes I will need in the next few days.    Cleaning my room (more or less) is not really an experiment, but it is definitely an imrovement.   And we are just in the middle of the afternoon!

      Well, that was it, and I am still alive - I think it could be worse after a funeral. Especially considering my famuily which has many members who are well out of the category "normal".  First of all, I simply cannot see why is it so important to be introduced to people I have never seen before and I will never see in the rest of my life. Why shall I endure the jokes of my grandma's sister's son just after it? Why is it  so  important to attend the banquette hold by my aunt whose husband doesn't even care to say hello to me. I am am there, why can't we talk about my grandma in piece why does it look like a quite ordinal weekend party? I am glad that it was no more than an hour - althogh it could not be  too  short.   Something else   The chat with algy was really refreshing - I was thinking about him a lot. I think I saw Loreley this week - she was a bony girl who algy listened like no one else I know. She would really suit him if it was a metter of appearance.

      Or not? If it is true, than blogspot is my only opportunity to publish blog online - it's Hungarian brother does not support my text-only browser.   Why am I using a text-only browser? I decided to get on with my Linux project and I have no graphic interface. Yet, althogh I do not plan to install it for a little while longer.  I just hang up the "phone" with an acquintance of mine; I think it was our longest talk we ever had. He is a collegaue of mine and has an "interesting personality"; tonight he was really bright.  Time to sleep, good night, Linux.
