      I stole that title from an "It's Happy Bunny" postcard.  Kind of made me feel all warm and tingly inside because I do in fact derive pleasure from certain people getting upset. Eh, judge all you want.  I do whatever I need to get me through the day.  So anyway, I got an email from a friend of mine about a possible side job working for a friend of a friend.  This is a semi-big deal because it'll help with my apartment fund.  She asked me if I got the voicemail she left for me at the house. Nope, didn't get it.  Then she told me her father, who is also my mechanic, has been trying to reach me all week to schedule time to look at my car.  Didn't get those messages, either.  There is only one person (besides me) who knows how to check the voicemail messages.  And if I'm checking them and there are none, either that means my good friend is lying to me or Her Majesty has been erasing my messages.  I should call and leave one in a phony voice just to see if she gives it to me or doesn't erase it, but I'm not in the mood for such pettiness.  I'll just clean the rim of the toilet with her toothbrush.  Again.  :)

      Since it's been rather muggy the last couple of days, I am enjoying the comfort that is 65 degree, recycled air.  It actually got chilly enough in my room that I started thinking, "Hey, I want soup."  So I made the trek downstairs and into the kitchen.  I grabbed a pot from the safety zone- the area WAY behind all the other pots under the cabinet.  (And I didn't slam the cabinet door.)  I opened my soup, and being the impatient person I am, put it on the high setting on the front burner.  In the 5 minutes it took for me to boil my soup:  I washed my hands,  threw out my soup can, grabbed a spoon out of the drawer, washed off said spoon, checked to see if I had mail, and grabbed a bowl out of the upper cabinet.  I pulled my soup off the stove, poured it into my bowl, and high-tailed it back to my room.  15 minutes later, I'm in agony.  Not that anyone needs to know, and not that I enjoy sharing moments like these, but I have been in and out of the bathroom 5 times so far.  Soup wants out!!!  I don't think there was anything particularly wrong with my soup.  It was chicken and vegetable Campbell's or something similar, and I boiled the hell out of it just in case the pot WAS dirty.  I believe the culprit of my pain, the bane of my existence, was the dirty bowl.  I forgot to wash the bowl when I brought it down from the cabinet.  Creepy, dirty, finger-up-the-nose or in-the-ass fingers must have touched it today, and I forgot to re-wash what was supposed to have been an already clean bowl.  Ugh.  I'm dying, and it's all because people downstairs have no concept of personal hygiene.  Tomorrow I'm going to do something I never thought I'd actually ever HAVE to do- buy a stash of plastic bowls, plates, cups, and utensils.  Unfuckingbelieveable.

      I haven't left my room since I came home from work, but I can tell Her Majesty just came home.  No, I didn't see her pull into the driveway, and I don't have a sixth sense or clairvoyance.  I can feel the walls and floors shaking from her ritual cabinet slamming, even though I have my radio on and am sitting directly in front of an oscillating fan.  This is something that I must get off my chest.  In her ever-present need to draw attention to herself, Her Majesty routinely opens and SLAMS every cabinet door in the kitchen.  And unlike an obessive compulsion where she might open each one just to be "even", she opens all of them, SLAMS all of them, and repeats this until either someone walks into the kitchen or she realizes that no one will.  If that doesn't get her attention, she'll start opening and slamming doors.  I have heard this slamming continue for lengths exceeding 5 minutes.  The worst part is that my room is right over the kitchen, so naturally I'm inclined to believe she does this just to fuck with me.  Always one to give the benefit of the doubt, I've gone downstairs and experimented with the cabinet doors.  Perhaps they could be rusty or spring loaded or not close all the way unless you slam them shut.  Alas, I found they are in perfect working order and only require the slightest push of air to close.  If someone sneezed in the other room, I believe the cabinet doors would close.  Can I just tell you how fucking ANNOYING it is to wake up every morning at 7 a.m., not to my gentle, bubbling brook alarm, but to SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! over and over again.  I realize I may not be the quietest person in the morning, but I am amiss to find a legitimate reason for this chorus of cabinets every fucking morning.  And for a woman who doesn't cook or clean, I have to wonder what the fuck she's doing in the cabinets at all.  Oh yeah, trying to fuck with me.

      I just had the single-most enlightening conversation I've ever been privvy to in my 20+ years on this earth.  Her Majesty:  "We should get one of those thingies you stick the thingy in.  What do you think?"  Me:  "I'm not really sure what you're talking about."  HM:  "You know, the thingies.  It goes in the thingy to make the computer work."  Me:  "Um..."  HM:  "The THINGY. Oh, come on.  You know.  They sell it at the place.  There's one on the highway.  They sell batteries."  Me:  (stifling contemptuous laughter) "Um..."  HM:  "I got my mom her thing that she ties around her neck there.  It goes in her ear so she can hear.  They sell all sorts of wires and batteries.  Tons of batteries."  Me:  "Walmart?  Circuit City?"  HM:  "No.   Come on .  I know you know.  The place with the thingies."  Me:  (Thinking to myself, Oh good Lord woman, spit it out!) "I have no idea what you are talking about."  HM:  "It starts with a 'B'.  They sell batteries."  Me:  "Best Buy?"  HM:  *SIGH*  "I know you know.  They sell batteries."  Me:  (At this point, I'm wondering if maybe she means Radio Shack, but I'm so amazed at the sheer ridiculousness of the conversation, that I keep my suggestion to myself to see how far she'll take this.  HM:  "Let me call my son.  He'll know."     "Hi, I have an emergency.  Remember when you bought that thingy for Grandma?  No, the other thingy.  No, the other one.  It goes around her neck and in her ear to help her hear.  Yeah, that thing.  Where did you get it?  The place with the batteries...Oh yeah, Radio Shack!"     "It's Radio Shack!"  Me:  "Hallelujah!"  May I point out that, for a woman with a   Master's degree   in Computer Science, we have these conversations  all  the time.  I used to try to guess at what she was talking about to spare her from embarrassing herself.  Now I feel like, fuck it, if you're going to be an idiot and throw this learned helplessness shit at me, I'm going to revel in your stupidity.

      All of this rehashing of the ex-boyfriend years opened up some psychological door, and now shit is just floating around in my mind. I'm not sure if you know this or not, younger sister, but I invite you to share in some background on why I do not particularly enjoy spending time with our older sister.  There are so many times that she would fuck up to get me into trouble. Most of these you are aware of, but the details may have been skewed over the years. Time and again, she has provided me many reasons why I should just haul off and punch her in the mouth or never talk to her again. And it's not like it's something that occurred only in childhood because she still fucking does it. I'm not even living by her, and she's still making shit up that I supposedly have said or done to fulfill whatever her neurosis of the day might be.  One thing that sticks out in my mind...a reason to end all reasons for why I should never talk to her. A mild form of sexual abuse.   I forget how old I was, but it was the year that Vanessa Williams won Miss America but had to rescind her title because had posed in Playboy or Penthouse or whatever. Daddy had bought a copy, and it was just lying around the house. She had taken it into her room and come up with the idea that we should act out what was in the pictures. She promised to play with me after I played "her game." She shut the door to her room and told me to sit on the bed. She flipped through the magazine, looking for things that we could do. I didn't know any better, I swear. I didn't think anything we were doing was wrong or bad or evil or whatever. I just wanted her to play with me, so I played her game first.  One of the pictures was of two girls, one kissing the other "down there." She said if I did that to her, then she would do it to me. Then we could go play. I remember asking how long I would have to do it for. (I was fucking impatient, wasn't I?)  I remember kissing her down there. Not really sure what I was doing. I just know that I really didn't like it. I kept asking if I could stop. Could we play yet? (God, I have that mental picture in my head now. I can remember everything...how it looked, how she smelled) She wouldn't let me stop. She kept saying, "I'll tell you when." And I don't remember how long she made me do it for. But she was supposed to do it to me, that was her game. But she didn't. She made me do it to her, and then the game was over. I remember getting mad because that wasn't fair. That sounds sick, but I didn't know any better. She said I had to do it to her first, and then she would do it back. We ended up arguing over it, and then she never played with me.  She always did stuff like that, too. Now that I think about it, she probably started masturbating around age 5. And she did it fiendishly. We used to have to bathe together, when we actually got to bathe. She was double-jointed, and she would fold her legs back by her sides. She would shimmy up to the faucet and let the water drip all over her privates. I couldn't do the same thing, so she would rub the water over me.  Again, I didn't know any better, so I never said anything about it to anyone.  Telling this story doesn't help answer my question...do I still try to keep a relationship with her? I'm half and half on it. My gut tells me to forget her, but my conscience says it's all in the past. And my conscience is a pretty damn strong force.

      When we left Arizona, we traveled along I-10 straight through to Texas. We still didn't have a radio, and we tried keeping my stereo up front for a while, but that left no room for the growing puppy. Besides, all of my cds got scratched when he almost flipped the truck over. The best thing about the trip back east was a sign we passed while in New Mexico: "Do not pick up hitchhikers. They may be escaping inmates." Great.  We ended up at a flea market in Canton, Texas. This was a flea market that was supposedly the Mecca of flea markets in that people from all the neighboring states would flock to this spot, fists of dollars in hand, to buy and share in whatever we had to offer. So we had high hopes of making up for the financial disaster in Arizona. My boyfriend's parents, who were vacationing in Florida, decided to drive over and meet us for the weekend and help out with the anticipated mob of customers. We went out to dinner and played gin rummy. For entertainment, I got to listen to his dad bestow his wisdom on being a salesman and how to draw people into our booth using a wide array of sales pitches, most notably "Help me out ladies, I need the money! I'm putting my son through school. He's studying to be an astronaut. He's taking up space." or "Check it out now! Check it out! 6 for a 1/2 dozen!" *insert canned laughter here*   After another busted flea market, we headed down south to the Gulf of Mexico. We did a market in Winnie, Texas. We sat in a motel for the week, staring out the window longingly at the green, half-filled pool. We tried to experience the local culture, but that turned out to be an exercise in futility. The only restaurant in town served crocodile and shark, and there was no movie theater, bookstore, library or anything that would remotely provide some relief from boredom. With my boyfriend in a state of perpetual rage, I spent most of my time hiding out in the bathtub, re-reading the same books I read in Arizona.   As if God were playing a cruel joke on me, the day we set up for the flea market, the weather turned. It went from 80 degrees and us walking around in t-shirts to 30 degrees and us scrambling to find our jackets. It rained so hard that our booth flooded, collapsing part of the tent. We had to take the plywood we used for the tabletops and throw it on the ground so people would be able to walk into our tent. I believe it was during this trip that I became interested in atheism.  Bills were mounting. There was no money left to stay in motels. My boyfriend made me sign up for credit cards at every booth and table we happened upon. We showered at truck stops and got right back into the truck. We still had some dry pantry food from Arizona, so that's what we ate. I tried to reason with myself that it was a learning experience, and my escape mechanism du jour was to liken it to being a rock group going out on tour.  I gave myself two options for when we returned home. Either I was going to pack up and leave immediately, or I would give things a chance when the comfort of "home" had been re-established. I obviously opted for the latter.

      Wednesday, June 09, 2004  I met my ex in the summer of my sophomore year at college. I was still dating a guy from college when I started to work for this guy. Pretty soon, I could tell that he was attracted to me. A very short amount of time passed before he was professing his newfound interest in me to everyone he came into contact with. Back then, he couldn't find enough good things to say about me, or enough people to tell them to.   I wasn't really interested in him romantically. I was interested in the amount of money he was willing to pay me, under the table, to help pay for my tuition. Then a series of events transpired that I believe altered my course in life.  I caught my father and another woman outside of his place of work, rather late at night. I didn't confront them, but I saw them, leaving after everyone else had left and standing way too close for my comfort. Long story short, my father lied about where he was and whom he was with. When I finally did tell him that I saw him, he called me a liar in front of our whole family. He told me that I was trying to break our family apart and a slew of other terrible things. That pretty much shattered my world.   Well, without delving too deeply into my relationship with my father, let's just say that I was crushed by what he did over this woman that summer. The man who for 20 years had been the absolute center of my universe lied to me without blinking an eye. That hurt.  I started working for this new guy, full time, almost immediately after. For the most part, the work sucked. I viewed it as a temporary summer job. I still had every intention of returning to college in the fall and I guess of resuming my relationship with my current boyfriend.  And then the dog thing happened. The day before the event, I had taken one of this guy's dogs on a car ride with me to go see my mom. I wanted my mom to see how cute and sweet this dog was. During the car ride, I had a one-sided (obviously) conversation with the dog. I told her that I was confused over this new guy. I told her how he kept repeating that we were meant for each other. He kept telling me how he had these "visions" of me in his head before he even met me, and he swore up and down that God had picked his brain and designed the perfect woman for him. I guess that was supposed to be me. I sat there for twenty minutes telling the dog all of this. And you know what? I think she was listening.  The next day after work, we came back to the new guy's house to find that, (brace yourself), one of his other dogs had EATEN the dog I had just taken with me to see my mother. It was a most gruesome, heart-wrenching scene. After we had everything cleaned up and taken care of, this new guy said something that haunted me... "She knew you'd take care of me, that's why she died." Like somehow the dog "knew" that I was the one for him and she was somehow giving approval or consent for our relationship by giving her life. I don't know. I know if I try to explain it on paper it makes me seem nutty. But I know at the time that it made perfect sense to me and made me feel as if I had just been handed a new truckload of obligation. Bottom line is: that's the day I moved in with this guy.  I'm thinking that most of my relationship with this guy revolved around some kind of conflict or trauma. It seems that at every turn, there was some new disaster waiting to be unleashed. But I'll get to that shortly...  After I moved in with him, I knew that there was no way that I could carry on any relationship with the guy from college. I had become so jaded and misguided about everything in just a matter of a few short months. I was still carrying around the hurt and assorted emotional baggage from what happened with my father. I often spoke with the new guy about the path and purpose of my life. I expressed to him my unhappiness with the plans that were made for my life. I told him how I wanted to do something for myself for a change. Naturally, he agreed with this. He firmly believed that I should live my own life, but at the same time, he was convinced that "my own life" included everything that he wanted for me. Where my focus had previously been making my father happy, it had shifted to making this guy happy. I replaced one for the other. I should have seen it then, but I guess I was too conflicted to realize it.   So this new guy starts to tell me how I had lived a scholastic life because that's what my father wanted for me. He convinced me that my father was living vicariously through me. He told me that I didn't owe anyone anything. He even went so far as to convince me that my father was a bad person. Everyone I knew was bad and "out to get" me. I was weak enough to believe this. So when school started up in September, this is the attitude that shaped my life. Inevitably, I quit school after 2 months and became a "partner" in this guy's business.  And so I tried to make a perfect relationship with this new boyfriend. At first everything was great. He couldn't stop singing my praises. He bought me flowers, we went out to dinner...the usual courting rituals. He tried to sweep me off my feet. But I can't pretend that my college ex wasn't still on my mind. I tried to reason with myself that I had found true love. I tried to persuade myself that I was giving up a guy who complemented me in almost every sense and had a fantastic future for a guy who seemed to know what I wanted out of life better than anyone. But I was still hesitant. I knew I didn't love this new guy anywhere near the way I had loved my college ex. I just didn't know how to say that out loud.  Eventually, the new boyfriend promised to take me across the country. For someone who had never really gone anywhere, this seemed like an exciting idea. I was so excited about the idea of traveling across the country. I wanted to see new places, but most of all I wanted to get away from all the frustration and hurt at home. He told elaborate tales of how much more beautiful it is out west, how the people are wonderful, and how we were going to make so much money and have a blast...he made everything sound perfect. And then he promised to take me to Mexico.   We left after Christmas. We drove for approximately 8 days. For the most part, the trip just sucked. We didn't get any radio stations, so I was subject to 8-10 hours of CB static per day. And the heat didn't work.   While driving through Missouri, I randomly asked what would happen if, while we were driving, we just shut the truck off? Well, rather than dictate an explanation, he felt the point would be better conveyed by a visual demonstration. He actually shut the truck off. WHILE WE WERE GOING 65mph DOWNHILL ON THE INTERSTATE. Unfortunately, timing was not on our side because the key tumbler decided that this would be the perfect opportunity to stop working. We couldn't get the truck turned back on. We ended up in a ditch in the median.   I remember climbing out of the truck, interstate side, clutching my new puppy to my chest. This guy starts flipping out, so I had to be the calm one in the situation. We had to cross the 4-lane road, dodging cars, trucks and 18-wheelers. I was scared out of my mind, mostly that my puppy would get loose, and partly that the truck WOULD flip over. While waiting for the tow truck, I sat on the side of the road and cried. I cried because I didn't want to be on the trip anymore, and I cried because I missed my college ex and my family. I cried because I was supposed to be sitting in a college classroom, not stuck on the side of the road in Missouri waiting for all my worldly possessions to spill out on the highway.   We spent New Year's Eve in a shitty motel in Oklahoma. The puppy peed on the bed. The boyfriend was asleep before 11pm. I stayed up and watched the ball drop, all by myself.  I remember spending the majority of the night thinking about my college ex.  Well, when we got to Arizona, it appeared our destination was the retirement capital of the world. I was the youngest person there. There was no phone, no television, no radio station...I was completely cut off from everyone and everything except the boyfriend. All he wanted to do was read his stupid books and work his flea market. So the puppy became my new best friend. We went for walks together. We spent hours playing and cuddling inside the trailer that was now our home. In a very, very short amount of time, that dog became my life.  The boyfriend was unhappy mainly because he wasn't making any money. Each day, we'd make between $20 and $100. Considering that our daily expenses were about $100, the situation just wasn't profitable. Of course, the boyfriend blamed me. Things seemed very desperate at times, and we naturally became argumentative. We would have nasty fights where he would throw things at me. I would try and leave and just go for a walk. He would block my path, putting both outstretched arms across the doorway. He would throw me backwards or grab my wrists and throw me down. He left bruises; black and blue marks in the shape of his handprints on my wrists.   I remember one day I planned to go to the post office to pay bills. It was quite a ways away. I had to pack everything into my backpack and ride my bike over. As I sat at the kitchen table looking up addresses, he came inside. For some reason, he had it in his mind that I planned to steal his money. Things got pretty heated very quickly. He accused me of being a thief, ripped things out of my hands, and tore my backpack off my shoulder breaking the straps. He threw everything within reach at me. And to top it off, he decided to tell me all that he thought was "wrong" with my personality, my lifestyle and me.   Things didn't improve much after that. We still fought constantly. He still threw things and blocked my path from room to room. A couple of times, I called my father to ask if I could come home. But he pretty much told me that I had made my bed...

      Sunday, June 06, 2004  Her Highness returned home late this evening. I believe all of two minutes passed before I could hear her screaming my name from the bottom of the stairs. She wanted to take back the phone cord so she could go online and IM her lover, even though she had spent the last 72 hours with this woman. (Yes, we are still using a dial-up modem to connect to the internet.)  That's ok, I thought. I'll go in and watch the season finale of the Sopranos in peace. Wouldn't you know it, as soon as I plopped down on the couch, in she comes. Apparently, this was the optimal time for her to raid the fridge, shuffle some papers, move the kitchen furniture around, shuffle the same papers, sigh heavily, leave the room, come back in, shuffle those goddamned papers again, pick up all the crap she left on the floor when she came in, and then leave the room again. This happened about 5 times in the hour it takes for the Sopranos to air. Unreal.

      Saturday, June 05, 2004  I've never done this before, but I'm sure I'll have no trouble filling space. Lately it seems that I have a lot to say but no one to say it to. I'm hoping that no one will be able to, whether purposefully or accidentally, identify me since most of what I want to get off my chest is rather scathing.  I guess I'll begin by saying that the shit that happens to me CANNOT be made up. It's unreal how much drama and bullshit surrounds me. There are people in my life who are so inherently flawed that most people would not believe they exist. They seem to be the product of a writer's overactive imagination. But I do not believe that any accomplished writer could even begin to fathom the idiosyncracies and storylines I am about to relate.  That being said, I do not think that I consciously or actively seek to include these types of people in my life. I am some kind of magnet for this shit, and they find me no matter where I go. I have to admit that part of it stems from my lack of assertiveness. And naturally, like any person with anger management issues, I have questionable self esteem. (But I also think I may have been on the grassy knoll in a former life, and my penance is being served out in this lifetime.)  Ok, you need to know a few more things about me before I start itemizing the things that are frustrating in my life.  1) I am almost obsessive-compulsive in my need for order in my immediate environment. I like my space to be clutter, garbage, and mildew free. I do not necessarily view this as a bad quality, although it is the root of many a anger flare-up. 2) I despise liars. I do not see the need to put all the thought and effort into making up something to hide your true intentions or to give the appearance of a more interesting life.  3) I am a people pleaser. Given my current living arrangement, I do a lot of things I normally would not do because I feel that saying no is not an option. I believe it goes without saying that I am allowing my good nature to be taken advantage of. Big time. I recently had the unique opportunity to witness just how disgusting a trait this can be, and I am taking steps to be more assertive.  4) I am the type of person who lets their anger build and build until a seemingly insignificant blip in my day sets me off on a tangent where "the fucking world has gone to shit". I'm getting much, much better with this, but I am nowhere near a healthy expressor of anger.  God, there is so much I want to vent, but I'm not sure if I should tell it chronologically or just go with what happened today. But this is already way too long, so I'll start with today.  I came home from work to find that someone in this house stole my razor and left it sitting on the coffee table in the living room, full of tiny hairs. Not only is this a BRAND NEW, expensive razor, it was upstairs in my room in a drawer. So someone apparently snooped through my room. They left it within easy access of the dog, who has taken to pulling things off of the coffee table, and he could have easily walked off with it and sliced his mouth open.   Ok, so I find my razor, in the living room of all places, still covered with hairs. And someone apparently picked up a tuft of hair and stuck it in the fan. I noticed it as I was cleaning up the hairs and stealing back my razor. So now I am confronted with the decision of either cleaning the fan NOW or waiting until someone turns the damn thing on and cleaning up the aftermath. I just stormed off. What the fuck is wrong with people?  So now I'm in the bathroom. Of course, it didn't occur to whoever used the toilet last to flush. Thanks for letting me know your digestive system is in proper working order. And every last damn towel is laying in a pile on the floor, breeding new, Tilex-resistant strains of mildew.   After cleaning up the bathroom, I walk into the kitchen to affirm that I am not hungry. I invite any scientist studying bacteria to come into my kitchen to run experiments. I don't know how anyone in this house can eat anything that comes out of there. There are ants everywhere, mouse shit all in the drawers and cabinets, and good luck figuring out what the fuck is in the tupperware in the fridge. It's all either congealed, liquified, or solidified. Some of it has been there so long that the tupperware has popped open, almost as if in a desperate cry to be remembered.   Why don't I clean it using my superhuman powers of OCD? Been there, done that. It's an exercise in futility. Shit pops back in there in less than a week, and I'm tired of having droplets of mystery meals spill onto my skin. I hardly eat when I'm here, and I'm sure my immune system is already compromised. I don't need the hassle of 10 days of amoxicillin or a nasty case of hives AGAIN.  So I've taken refuge in my room for the rest of the day. As I sit here downloading music and debating whether or not to actually write a blog, I know the powers that be are busy discussing how I've been antisocial lately. Regardless of whether or not I may actually want to be social, I'd rather stay in my room where I know I can rest my elbows on a surface without contracting some bizarre infection. And of course, hiding out in my room also protects me from exposure to the pigs and liars and all the accompanying bullshit that lurks downstairs.  The main person I hide from is the worst of all. She is an attention-hungry, self important, manipulative, lying hypochondriac. And she gets testy if you don't drop what you're doing and greet her when she walks through the door. I exercise my right to sit on my ass and refuse audience with her highness every chance I get. This of course results in her screaming my name from the bottom of the stairs. When and if I finally emerge from my room, she invariably asks me a stupid question like do we need milk or did the mail come today. How the fuck should I know? Go and look for yourself.  My main beef with her is that she is cheating on her husband with another woman, but she thinks she's discreet and that no one knows. It makes me insane. She spends every available moment with this woman at the expense of her own family, and they even bought a "summer home" together. I think hotels were getting a bit too expensive, so they opted for their own place.   If this woman truly makes her happy, and if this is a lifestyle choice she has made, I wish she would be honest. I realize her extra-marital activities are none of my business, but she includes me in her lie. She'll ask me to tell this other woman she was someplace other than where she really was. Or she'll say she's going out with another friend, but then she comes home and tells me all about her escapades with her secret lover. I know this other woman genuinely cares for her and wants to make a life with her. But I think she's just using this woman to validate her sexuality, for her money, and to have another source of attention for her imagined chronic illnesses.   The whole charade pisses me off, especially since her husband is the sweetest man in the world. He trusts his wife implicitly and is completely oblivious to the affair. He honestly believes that his wife is just out gallivanting with one of her girlfriends. The idea of an affair, especially with a woman, would never occur to him. I hate her for this.  Yet I live in her house, slowly saving enough money to move out and get my own apartment, so I am not in a position to say any of this to her. I can't tell her that her fake, high-pitched laugh makes my blood curdle, her house is disgusting, that she should spend a weekend cleaning up after herself instead of getting eaten out in her "summer home", or that I could give two shits if her stomach hurts again its probably because her lies are eating her up inside. I can't say any of this while I am living here rent and bill free. That would make ME the asshole.

      Apparently I fucked something up with my last blog, because I am no longer able to edit my profile, or even add things to it that were missing.  So here goes attempt number two.  I will republish my last entries because I think it would be a waste to pretend they never existed.  Enjoy.

      Something got messed up with that last post, and all of my text disappeared.&nbsp; It's a shame, too, because I believe I had captured, in the most eloquent and flattering way, the story of Nasty Pants G-ma's intestinal distress yesterday.&nbsp; Oh, well.&nbsp; Now I'll have to tell the REAL story...   As stated above, G-ma had intestinal distress yesterday.&nbsp; She blamed it on the grape juice that "came from the Hindus' down the street."&nbsp; I blamed it on her rotten potato/brown lettuce/can of cream-of-chicken-soup-minus-the-water concoction that she let sit out on the stove, uncovered, for two days.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomay-toe, tomah-toe.   She asked the husband to run out to the store and get her some Pepto.&nbsp; He had to do a bit of food shopping, anyway, and he was excited at the idea of getting out of&nbsp;the house for a while.&nbsp; While he was gone, I set about cleaning up the kitchen.&nbsp;   In the time that he was gone, G-ma managed to shit her pants twice, sit down on the couch (still wet and dirty) and remove her soiled undergarments, and proceed to bare-ass it to the bathroom while simultaneously leaving a trail&nbsp;of the contents of said spoiled undergarments all across the floor.&nbsp; All the while, I'm standing at the kitchen sink, horrified.   I ran upstairs.   When the husband came home, I ventured out of my room to help with the groceries.&nbsp; Although, how anyone could bring food into the house a) knowing how dirty it was to begin with and b) after the incident I had just witnessed, was beyond my understanding.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I helped him unpack the groceries.&nbsp;&nbsp;   When he gave G-ma the bottle of Pepto, she thanked him by saying, "I only eat Pepto tablets.&nbsp; I have to be careful what I put in my mouth.&nbsp; You have to take this back and get me the good stuff.&nbsp; Oh, yeah."&nbsp; [followed by guttural throat clearing that lasted for two minutes]   After shooting me that "I wish I could strangle her" look, he headed back out the door.&nbsp; I went back upstairs to get ready for work, thankful that my boss had asked me to come in on a Sunday.    *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *  &nbsp;

      I forgot to mention that Fatty, who is still "on the Atkin's Diet", is here.&nbsp; He's supposed to be taking care of Grandma today (for a hundred bucks, I'm sure), yet he didn't get here until after 2 p.m.&nbsp; Two minutes ago he was masturbating to internet porn downstairs on the floor.&nbsp; How do I know?&nbsp; I can see down into the living room&nbsp;from my room at the top of the stairs.  I went out to the store yesterday and did a bit of grocery shopping so I could feed Grandma this weekend.&nbsp; When I went downstairs before, I found that 3 of the frozen dinners were eaten (cardboard containers laying on the table, plastic trays half hidden in the couch, and half a case of soda was devoured.&nbsp;   Right now, I can hear the rustling of a bag of potato chips and his loud snorting and exhaling that can only mean he's feasting.&nbsp; Way to stick to the diet!  [blood pressure rising]  This leads me to vent about Fatty and&nbsp;how he would be a piss-poor criminal.&nbsp; Since he is so self-absorbed, he never succeeds in hiding his indiscretions.&nbsp;   Take food for an example:   He'll leave the empty wrappers&nbsp;and his utensils laying around and then play dumb when you ask him about it.&nbsp;   He'll eat a Hostess cake or the equivalent, leave the little cardboard with the chocolate smears on the table, and throw the cellophane wrapper back into the empty box back in the cupboard.  He'll drink half a case of soda, leave the cans all around the living room, and then leave before anyone can question him about it.  Or, and this is my favorite, he'll throw his dirty dishes, utensils, wrappers, and whatever else is left into the couch cushions or under&nbsp;the couch.   My FAVORITE activity when he is around is to catch him masturbating.&nbsp; And yes, this happens EVERY time he is here.&nbsp; &nbsp;He lays on the floor, crotch into the rug, with the laptop sitting in front of him.&nbsp; You can tell his pants are unzipped because his belt is hanging loose on either side of him.&nbsp; And he always says "Hey, what are you doing?" when you come into the room.&nbsp; I usually have to step over him, one foot in between his outstretched legs, and high-tail it to the kitchen.  Good Lord, I want out of this house.&nbsp;

      Since I only work 4 days a week, I usually have plans for Friday through Sunday.&nbsp; I realize that this is the time that Her Highness reserves for traveling down to her "summer home" with the other woman, but&nbsp;I don't see how that should impact my life at all.  Since school is out, Her Highness is officially off for the rest of the summer.&nbsp; This means that she is home ALL WEEK.&nbsp; During this time, you would think she could find a moment or two to schedule someone to come in and take care of her mother while she plans to be away.&nbsp; I guess since this would require an output of energy, it is beyond Her Highness' scope of responsibility.&nbsp;   So I found a note this morning (another goddamned note) that basically laid out my plans for the rest of the summer as dictated by Her Highness.&nbsp; It said that since she would be gone most weekends, "this is what grandma wants for dinner" and "this is what time she goes to bed" and "thanks."&nbsp;&nbsp;How the hell did HER MOTHER become MY responsibility?&nbsp; At least I got a "thanks" out of it.  And thank YOU&nbsp;for the conversation about my schedule, my plans, and your compensation to me for services rendered.

       Last night we had an intervention for a friend whose boyfriend is suspected of abusing her.&nbsp; We're not sure if he's actually hitting her, but he's definitely verbally and emotionally battering this poor woman.&nbsp; None of us were sure how to start or even what to say, but thankfully he gave us the right opportunity.     &nbsp;   Around midnight, he called and demanded to know why she didn't call him earlier.&nbsp; He tried to give her some sort of ultimatum that would supposedly embarrass her in front of us.&nbsp; As soon as she hung up the phone, we started in on her.&nbsp; No one yelled or was mean or accused her of being at fault.&nbsp; She was surprised to hear we all felt this way.     &nbsp;   I have to say that seeing her confronted like this made me wish I had known these other women a few years back.&nbsp; Not that people weren't telling me that I didn't belong with my ex, but the atmosphere of caring and support last night was overwhelming.&nbsp; In a good way.     &nbsp;   I spent my drive home and most of today rehashing incidents from&nbsp;4 years ago.&nbsp; I, too, should have seen the warning signs&nbsp;of my ex's temper.&nbsp; I should have picked up on so many clues, so many OBVIOUS clues, but I always tried to reassure myself that I was causing him to act that way.     The last time he ever hit me resulted from a fight we had over nothing.&nbsp; He dragged me out of the house at 11 p.m. to go to a bar.&nbsp; I resisted at first because I had to be at work at 5 a.m., and I knew that I wouldn't get any sleep.&nbsp; Plus, he wanted to drink, so that means I'd have to sit there and watch him get loud and out of control, and then I'd have to drive his drunk ass home.     &nbsp;   We met up with two of my friends at the bar, and my ex was Mr. Personality all of a sudden.&nbsp; He bought everyone drinks and told stories and jokes.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the bar closed at 2 a.m., he wanted to continue the party.&nbsp; He invited everyone back to our house and got visibly upset when they refused him.&nbsp; My friend kept making faces at me, as if to say, "Who&nbsp; is  this guy?"     &nbsp;   On the drive home, I turned on the radio.&nbsp; He turned it off.&nbsp; He started to yell at me because I "never want to go out anymore."&nbsp; I told him I don't make it a habit to go out on nights before I have to get up early.&nbsp; I guess this pissed him off further.&nbsp; He started to yell and throw things around the car.&nbsp; All of a sudden, a switch in his brain was thrown, and he calmed down.&nbsp;   He asked me to call out of work and drive him down to Atlantic City.&nbsp; I told him I couldn't because I had just started my job.&nbsp; It wouldn't look good if I called out already.&nbsp; After a moment of silence, I turned the radio back on.     &nbsp;   And his mood changed again.     &nbsp;   He flipped the radio off.&nbsp; He started yelling about&nbsp;ME trying to keep him separated from my friends.&nbsp; In truth, the opposite was true.&nbsp; He was constantly telling me that my friends were no good, that they all disliked him, and that I shouldn't hang out with them.     &nbsp;   I believe I said, "Whatever.&nbsp; You're drunk."&nbsp; and turned the radio back on.     &nbsp;   He reached out, shut off the radio, ripped off the knobs and threw them out the window, then turned back and punched me in jaw.&nbsp; The car swerved, and he was thrown into the dashboard.&nbsp; Of course, I did this on purpose, so that required further punishment from him.&nbsp; He started slapping the side of my face and telling me that I should "Go ahead, cry.&nbsp; I wanna see you cry you fucking baby."     &nbsp;   I didn't quite know what to do, so I pulled the car over and just sat there.&nbsp; We were still about&nbsp;7 miles from home, in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp; It was now 3:30 a.m.&nbsp; I wasn't going to get out and walk anywhere.     So I asked him if he was finished.&nbsp; He just sat there, staring out the window.&nbsp;&nbsp;I took that as an affirmative answer, and I pulled back onto the road.&nbsp; We drove the rest of the way in&nbsp;silence, although I was seething with anger.     When we pulled into the driveway, I got out and ran inside.&nbsp; I immediately went to bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;He came in about 2 minutes later, butt-ass naked.&nbsp; He climbed into bed and tried to be all romantic with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I got up and went&nbsp;to the other&nbsp;bedroom.&nbsp; He followed me, turning on every light in his path.&nbsp; It was now 4 a.m.     &nbsp;   He tried to climb into the bed with me.&nbsp; I told him I just wanted to try to catch a half-hour of sleep before I had to work.&nbsp; He said since I was already up, I should make myself useful.&nbsp; And he started to manipulate himself.&nbsp; I got up and went back into the other bedroom.&nbsp; He followed me again.     &nbsp;   When I got out of bed, he was on me.&nbsp; He tackled me, and told me that I wasn't good enough to be with him.&nbsp; My dog started to bark at him.&nbsp; I managed to kick him off of me, and I ran to the bathroom.&nbsp; He didn't follow.&nbsp; I grabbed my toiletry bag and my change of clothes and decided I was going to my mom's house to shower and get ready for work.&nbsp; He was already blocking the front door when I got there, still naked.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I put my finger through my keyring in case he tried to steal them, but that proved to be a bad move.&nbsp; He immediately saw the keys and tried to grab them.&nbsp; He yanked on them so hard that the metal key ring cut through my finger and actually opened.&nbsp; Keys went flying.&nbsp; He told me that I wasn't going anywhere.&nbsp; I tried, in the calmest voice I could muster, to tell him that I was just going to my mom's house to shower.&nbsp; I would be back after work.&nbsp; I wanted to give him time to get some rest, and we could talk when I got home.&nbsp; But he wasn't buying any of it.&nbsp; He grabbed my clothes and bag and threw them back into the kitchen.&nbsp; As I went to go pick them up, he ran outside and disconnected my distributor cap.     &nbsp;   When I went outside, he was holding the wires in his hand, smiling and telling me that I wasn't going ANYWHERE.     &nbsp;   I tried again to reassure him that I was only going to work.&nbsp; I went so far as to give him a kiss and a hug and tell him that everything was ok, I just needed to get to work.&nbsp; I begged him to put the distributor cap back in.     &nbsp;   He finally relented and walked back into the house.&nbsp;I knew that I would never make it&nbsp;to work on time, and I pretty much decided right then that our relationship was over.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I got into the car, I looked at my dog, standing by the open door.&nbsp; I thought about taking her with me, but I knew that he would know what I was up to.&nbsp; I told her that I loved her, got into the car, and drove away.&nbsp; That was the last time I ever saw her.

      Happy Birthday to you!  Happy Birthday to you!  Happy Birthday dear Fatty,  Happy Birthday to you!   Ok, so Fatty's birthday was this week.&nbsp; I have to say that I knew it was coming up, but seeing as how he's on my pay-no-mind list, I completely forgot that it was this week.&nbsp; So I made plans to go out with a friend on Tuesday night.&nbsp; I got an email invitation from his mom&nbsp;on Monday that we were going to have a birthday dinner on Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Apparently asking me in person when I got home proved too difficult a task for her highness.)&nbsp;   This presented me with the dilemma of either canceling my plans and going to the party and having a horrible time, or going out with my friend, as planned, and incurring the wrath of his passive-aggressive family (including silent treatment, passing under-their-breath comments, and being made to feel like an overall asshole).&nbsp; I also had to deal with the whole gift issue.&nbsp;   Let me say that he has NEVER gotten me anything for my birthday in the four years that I've known him.&nbsp; So right away I felt rebellious over the idea of having to spend money on him.&nbsp; I figured I'd get him a card and leave it at that.&nbsp; But my boyfriend, his brother, hinted that I really "should" get him a $30&nbsp;gift certificate to Best Buy so he could buy the newest wrestling DVD's.&nbsp;   Um, no.   I ended up getting him $10 worth of gift certificates to Blimpie.&nbsp; At least I know he'll use them.   I'm already NOT looking forward to this event, and then my boyfriend tells me Monday night that he might not even make it at all.&nbsp; I became more and more convinced that I might suffer an anxiety attack if I had to attend the dinner, especially if I was expected to go it alone.&nbsp; So all day Tuesday, I kept flipping back and forth- what should I do?&nbsp; Around noon, my boyfriend told me he would make it down, after all.&nbsp; &nbsp;And, as it turned out, my friend had to cancel our plans, and&nbsp;I ended up saying I would join the family.   My boyfriend's response was something like, "All I had to do was hint that you'd see me, and you naturally cancel your plans."&nbsp; Like him coming was enough for me to want to subject myself to this thing.&nbsp; I thought that was funny.&nbsp; I didn't bother to tell him that my plans were cancelled.&nbsp; Let him think whatever he needs to get him through his day.   So we ended up going to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;I got sandwiched in between Fatty and my boyfriend, which was great because I got to listen to the latest wrestling gossip.&nbsp; And watching him eat is nothing short of vomitous.&nbsp; He ate two loaves of bread.&nbsp; When the bread was gone, he resorted to&nbsp;dipping his fingers into the butter dish and sucking his fingers.&nbsp; When the meals actually came out, he shoveled food into his mouth, snorting and exhaling, never stopping to chew.&nbsp;   Her highness was SO fake-happy the entire time.&nbsp; "Oh, isn't this great?&nbsp; Thanks so much for coming!"&nbsp; At one point, she even said to me, "I didn't know you were coming! Thank you!"&nbsp; and gave me a hug.&nbsp; Um, we left the house around the same time, woman.&nbsp; Where did you THINK I was going?&nbsp; She was so plastic throughout the entire meal.   But my real issue with the dinner was that his mother's girlfriend came along.&nbsp; The two of them sat there, engrossed in their own world, sharing food off the same plates.&nbsp; They openly mocked the father when he said he really wasn't all that impressed by the food.&nbsp; And they were all high and mighty when he said he didn't like his coffee because it tasted burnt.&nbsp; "Well, you just don't know what GOOD coffee is, then."&nbsp; Give me a break.&nbsp; As if the two of them are the most cultured socialites this side of North Jersey.   So the best part of the whole evening happened when I finally got home.&nbsp; I overheard Her Highness and her lover on the telephone (which isn't hard to do in any room of this house).&nbsp;    &nbsp; I know, she hardly spoke to anyone at all.&nbsp; Mmm, hmm.&nbsp; I think she suspects.   My ears perk up.    &nbsp; I noticed that, too.&nbsp; She wouldn't even look at you.&nbsp; Well, she needs to forget about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; You had more of an invitation to be there than she did.&nbsp; He specifically mentioned he wanted you to come.   At this point, I have to laugh.&nbsp; I didn't want to go to this celebration in the first place.&nbsp; And if they're stupid enough to think that he wanted them there because he genuinely enjoys their company, and not that he's expecting them to bring envelopes of money, they're more deluded than I thought.   Take your high-brow, self important, superficial dinners at Ruth Chris' Steakhouse and shove them up your pretentious, cheating, lying ass.&nbsp; And do me the favor of not inviting me anywhere else.

      ...how a moth can sit on a wall, motionless, for hours until you walk past it, and then it FLIES directly at your face?&nbsp;  &nbsp; I went to look at an apartment today.&nbsp; The location wasn't too bad, although it was a bit further than I would have&nbsp;liked.&nbsp; It was a studio apartment on the lower level of a condo.&nbsp; Plenty of free parking, utilities included, and over 720 square feet.&nbsp; The only things I didn't like were that there was no kitchen and only one tiny window in the back.&nbsp; Well, that and the fact that the guy showing it to me invited my friend and I to dinner almost immediately &nbsp;and mentioned that I could come up to his apartment and drink wine in front of the fireplace during the winter.&nbsp; Eh, no thanks. &nbsp; But I must say that I feel good about actually researching this lead and reinforcing the belief that I need to get my own place.

      For reasons that were implemented long before I was born, everyone here uses the back door to leave the house, so the back deck stairs get a lot of traffic. The deck is raised a couple of feet, and there are three steps that lead to the driveway in the backyard.  When I went to walk the dog this morning, I noticed something was amiss with the deck. Upon closer examination, I realized that the middle step was broken clean through and the metal railing (yes, a metal railing on a wooden deck.  Talk about your eyesores.) was rocking in the wind.  This is the third time I have seen this happen since I've lived here (just under ten months).  I have only one guess as to who's girth could have caused such destruction:  Fatty wuz here.  Apparently, Home Depot neglects to inform its consumers that when building deck stairs, they are not meant for 450+ pound men to bounce on.  Shame on Home Depot for not being more forthcoming!

      I had a conversation this afternoon with my boyfriend.  He's studying to take the bar at the end of this month.  He asked me to help him study by coming up with weird cases for him to explain the legalities of.  Eventually, our conversation turned to my ex.  I wanted to know, if I could sue him, what would I sue him for?  So my boyfriend presented me with a littany of legal terms and concepts, most of which wouldn't work today since the statute of limitations has run out.  But the one that stuck with me had to do with my ex dog.  I believe I've already mentioned that I loved that dog like a child.  When I left my ex, his only real revenge was to steal my dog.  I tried to act like it was no big deal, since I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing he had hurt me any more.  But then he told me that if I ever tried to go after her, he would make sure to kill her before I ever stepped foot on his property.  Heartless bastard.  So basically, my boyfriend explained in his legalese that if I WANTED to sue my ex (which I have no desire to do), I could sue him for something known as a "proprietary interest" in the dog.  Basically, this means that the dog was mine, and he stole her.    If I hadn't waited to sue, I could have gotten quite a nice settlement from him for assault and battery, the whole proprietary interest thing, and something known as NIED- negligent infliction of emotional distress.  Good to know.

      During the summer of 1999 while my boyfriend was away in Pennsylvania, I decided to deep clean the entire house.  I went room by room and straightened up every last corner.  Not looking forward to organizing assorted ham radio equipment, I saved my boyfriend's "radio room" for last.    I made piles of books, magazines, wires, photos, you name it.  While reaching for one of the books on the top shelf, something resembling a bill came tumbling down.  I picked it up and flipped it over, and noticed it was a phone bill.  I thought this might have accidentally gotten mixed up with the books, and perhaps he still needed to pay the balance.  So I opened up the bill to look at the date.  It was for the previous month...  And all the calls were placed to a number in Nashville...  No big deal, I think.  He is constantly calling all over the country to make business deals and whatnot.  But I noticed that the bill was for over $1,000. I kind of shrugged it off and continued cleaning up.    But something about that bill kept nagging at me, and I went to take another look at it.  I noticed that all the numbers were 900 numbers, and I started to panic.  I decided to call one just to check it out.  If someone answered with a business name, I would just let the whole thing alone.  I dial 1-900- whatever, and a breathy voice on the other end says, "Ooh, HOT...ANAL...SEX." I immediately hung up and freaked out.  So let me sort this all out for you:  my boyfriend of 2 years now is making $1000/month calls to phone sex lines without my knowledge.  Mmm hmm...yeah, I don't like this at all.  So I look at the bill, and sure enough it itemizes each call with the time the call was placed, length of call, and how much each call cost.  My boyfriend seemed to be in the habit of making these 10 minute calls every morning before I woke up, sometimes 2 or 3 times in the span of an hour.  And he would make them as soon as he came home, and after I had gone to sleep.  After calming myself down, I called him in Pennsylvania.  I told him that I had been cleaning up his radio room and I found what appears to be an overdue phone bill.  Not hinting that I knew what it was about, I asked him if this was something I should pay for him?  He told me not to worry about it. So I told him I had it right in front of me, and that I was shocked to see that calling Nashville was so expensive.  Was he calling our supplier?  His only response was, "What do you think it is?"  He kept repeating that over and over again.  I finally told him I think it's grounds for me to leave him.  I ended up calling my dad and telling him about the whole incident.  I guess I expected some sympathy or advice.  My dad said, "Well what did you expect?  I mean come on, the guy has boxes and boxes of porno mags."  WHAT? He does? Where? And why does my dad know about it and I don't?    So when my boyfriend finally got back, we tried to have "the discussion."  He ended up telling me that it was my fault he was calling because these women were willing to do things with him that I wouldn't.  He said he had developed this addiction to phone sex, and that it had been going on for well over a year.  He said that if I could just learn to be more uninhibited, then he would stop.    Just like everything else in our relationship, his shortcomings and weaknesses were all my fault.

         I know you will read this little sister, and I know it seems to be a big joke to everyone anymore.  But the level of hurt I still associate with this event is very real, very true, and still very raw on a number of levels.  While I was outside playing with our neighbor, my mother screamed for me to get in the house.  I dutifully ran over to see what she wanted.  Apparently, someone had given my new baby sister pea pods from the garden.  My mother began to scream and hit me, telling me that I was trying to kill the baby.  (Now mind you, I was outside playing with the neighbor for most of the afternoon while older sis was inside doing the devil’s work.)  She immediately remanded me to my room for the rest of the day and told me to wait for my father to come home.  And then the phone rang.  Her father had just died, and the funeral would be that weekend.    A short while later, my mother screamed at me to come downstairs into the kitchen.  As soon as I got down there, she sent me flying across the kitchen with a slap to the face.  How DARE I give the baby crayons! (Was she nuts? I was upstairs…)  The baby had a box of crayons within inches of her playpen, and there were two or three crayons lying next to her blankets.  She sent me to my room again.  Naturally, when my father came home, I was duly punished.   When my mother left for the funeral the next day, she took my older sister with her.  My father and I were lying on the couch watching TV.  He asked me to go in and check on the baby.  As soon as I got there, I saw that she had red crayon all over her face.  I yelled for him to come quick.    After checking the baby and cleaning her up, he flew into a rage.  He accused me of trying to kill my little sister.  He beat me and cursed at me and beat me some more.  He dragged me upstairs and into the bathroom.  He asked me how I would like it if someone bigger than me tried to make me eat something that I didn’t want.  And then he opened the medicine cabinet and took out the new can of shaving cream.  He proceeded to empty the can into my mouth…  Within seconds, I began to vomit blood.  He made me clean the bathroom while he stormed downstairs to collect himself.  Sobbing and scared, I went back downstairs to tell him that I was finished.  Apparently, the sight of me set him off again, and he started to hit me with his belt.    When he finished, he went into the garage to work on some project.  After a while, I went in after him.  I stood off to the side and watched him work.  He got upset again and picked up the blowtorch he was working with.  He threw me down on the garage floor and started screaming at me about bigger people picking on littler ones and how wrong that was.  And then he started to pass the blowtorch over my legs and back.  I don’t believe the flame ever touched my skin, but the heat was enough to burn and cause my skin to redden.  When he finally exhausted himself, he told me to get in the car.  We were going to Grandma’s house.  As soon as we got there, he told her his version of the story.  I sat in the corner, still crying and wondering if maybe I had done something bad, but knowing I didn’t feed my little sister crayons.  They sent me outside to play.  I sat on the walkway outside the front door until my grandmother came out.  She asked me to tell her what happened.  I told her that it must have been my oldest sister putting the box close to the playpen.  I told her that I loved my little sister and would never do anything to hurt her.  I told her everything that I knew about the incident, and she believed me.  She held me and told me she loved me and that she knew I didn’t do it.  She went back in and told my father that I didn’t do it.  He got mad again.  He dragged me into the back room, knocking over furniture in the process, and beat me again.  He made me go back out to my grandmother and tell her that I was a liar.  He made me tell her that I looked her right in the eye and lied to her because I was a worthless child.  Through tears and sobs, I managed to tell her that I lied.  She started crying, too, and told him to stop.    To this day, my family still jokes about the time I fed crayons to my little sister.  It’s been almost twenty years since this incident, but it still gets me upset to hear them joke about it.  Nothing about that day was funny to me.

      I believe I was 3 or 4 when this incident occurred:  My mother and father got into a nasty fight one afternoon.  I don’t remember what they fought about, but I do remember they stormed into my room and started throwing everything around.  My father eventually grabbed me and took me to my grandmother’s house.  We stayed there for a while, until one day my dad told me we were going to see Mommy.  We drove back down to our house, and Daddy told me to stay hidden in the car.  He said Mommy didn’t know I was there, and he wanted to surprise her.  As he got out of the car, he tossed his jacket into the backseat, and I promptly threw it over myself, eager to play his version of hide and seek.  I heard my parents talking outside of the car.  They started shouting at each other, and then my father yelled for me to get out of the car.  As I opened the door, he grabbed me and took off running down the street with me in his arms.  He ran up to a neighbor’s door and asked them if he could come in and call the police.  They said no and quickly closed the door.  My father turned around and started running in the other direction.  A man I did not know came out of nowhere and hit my father.  My father fell and dropped me.  As I stood there in bewilderment, I saw my mother standing outside of our house with a smile on her face.  The next thing I know, my father had scooped me up again and was running across the street with me.  Then he was falling again, pinning me to the road underneath him.  He said the person chasing us had a knife.  And then my father was off of me.  This strange man who was chasing us picked me up and started running with me in the opposite direction.  I was screaming for my father, and this man was yelling at me to be quiet.  I remember being terrified that I would never see my father again, and I HATED this man who was carrying me to God only knew where.  He ended up driving me around the neighborhood for what seemed like an eternity.  I was crying, and he was still yelling at me.  He finally drove me over to a friend of my mother’s house.  When we walked in the door, I saw my older sister playing in the living room.  Everyone ran over to me and started hugging me, telling me how worried they had been about me.  I demanded to know where my mother was and what was happening to Daddy.  They told me my mother would be home soon and immediately sent me to bed.    The most unfortunate part of this whole ordeal is that I still dream about this incident from time to time.  I’ve gotten used to the nightmares, so I don’t get too freaked out about it anymore.  From bits and pieces of information leaked out over the years, the best explanation I could put together was that my father drove down to reconcile with my mother.  She duped him into thinking they would reunite and that he should bring me down so we could all be together.  My mother asked some of her friends to ambush my father in the hopes that she could steal me away from him, but my father put up too much of a struggle.  Eventually though, there were too many men for my dad to fight off, and one of them was able to steal me away from him.

      I tried to explain to a friend this evening just why I don’t like my oldest sister.  I didn’t feel too comfortable explaining the number one incident (see previous blog entry), but I was able to briefly relate some of the other stories.  My friend suggested that perhaps my older sister was a victim of sexual abuse before she came to live with my family.  I have to admit that her insight makes perfect sense- I just never wanted to see that before.  From as far back as I can remember, my sister was always inappropriately sexual.  She either wanted me to touch her or made me watch as she masturbated in the bathtub.  I was too young to know what was really going on, but I knew enough to think that she was “gross.”  This new knowledge puts a slightly different spin on things.  I feel sympathy for her if she did in fact suffer sexual abuse at the hands of her caretakers.  But part of me just thinks that she’s psychotic and chemically imbalanced all on her own.  Either way, I don’t feel I need to forgive her for the horrors she put me through while growing up.  She had such a fondness for getting me into trouble.  She loved to break things or take magic markers and write all over the walls.  Being two years older and having more developed gross motor skills than I, she would run into my mother’s room and tattle about what I had “just done.”  Now, you need to know this for background:  my oldest sister is the product of my mother’s first marriage.  Seeing that my sister was, well, let’s call her a handful, my mother’s first instinct was to protect her over me.  Whenever something went wrong, my mother thought the best course of action was to tell my dad that I was the bad kid and I deserved punishment.  Even if my mother knew that I had not done something wrong, she would still protect her first-born child to the very end.  So night after night, my father would come home late from work and storm into my room.  Still half asleep, I would be excited to see that Daddy came home.  But Daddy didn’t come into my room to kiss me goodnight or tell me that he loved me.  No, Daddy came into my room to yank me out of bed by my ankles and throw me over his knee to whip me with his belt for the havoc my older sister wreaked during the day.  Still too young to realize what a jerk-off my older sister was and that this behavior was NOT typical of other families, I went about life as normally as I could.  I still played with my sister and thought the universe revolved around my father.

      Thoughts of my ex are creeping around my mind this evening.  For some reason, I can’t shake the memory of the last real nasty fight we got into.  Most of the fights we had started over the most seemingly inconsequential request or comment.  This fight was no exception:  We woke up rather early on a Saturday, and I asked him if he wanted to go to Great Adventure.  After we both had showered and dressed, I went into the bathroom to start fixing my hair.  He came in and grabbed the comb out of my hands.  I explained to him, rather matter-of-factly, that I have to do my hair while it's still wet, otherwise I can't get it to do anything right all day.  But he was having territorial/control issues that morning and decided that he HAD to have the comb right then and there.  We got into it almost immediately.  The typical ex reaction was to start shouting and throwing things at me.  He threw everything within reach directly at me as I stood in front of the bathroom sink.  He took the comb in one hand and pretended to give it to me, but pulled it away at the last minute and just punched me in the face.  He yelled about how I was such a baby about things and if I wanted to do my hair, then fine.  He would give me "a reason" to redo my hair.  He grabbed me by the back of the neck and slammed my head through the mirrored glass on the medicine cabinet.    I managed to back him out of the bathroom and close the door.  Confused by how quickly things had escalated, I slumped down behind the door, partly to keep him out and partly to keep him from seeing me cry.  I could hear him slamming and stomping his way through the rest of the house, cursing everything about me.  And then, in keeping with his typical behavior, everything got quiet as quickly as it all had started.  I stopped to check my appearance in the remaining mirror fragments before heading out of the bathroom.  The image reflected back at me immediately killed any sadness or fear I might have been feeling.  I stormed out of the bathroom and confronted him.  I asked him if beating up on women made him feel like more of a man.    Wrong move.  He grabbed me around the neck and shoved me up against a wall.  With one hand on my throat, he reached around for the nearest object to hit me with.  It turned out to be a glass frog- one of those heavy vase toppers that holds each individual flower stem.    Still holding me against the wall, he spit at me, repeatedly, and dared me to hit him back.  He told me that he should never have gotten involved with such a child, such "a worthless, piece of shit, immature fucking baby."  And then his anger diffused and he walked away.  He just walked away from me.  I started to gather my things into a small bag, and I walked over to the phone.  I started to dial my mother when he came in the room.  When he heard my mother pick up, his temper flared again.  I got about three words out when he yanked the phone cord out of the wall.  He picked up the phone and threw it clear across the room.    I told him I was finished with him.  I wanted to leave.  He blocked the door.  He wouldn't let me even walk out of the bedroom.  He ripped my bag from my hands and emptied it onto the floor.  When I bent over to pick it up, he kicked my legs out from under me, sending me crashing into my dresser.  One of my bottom teeth actually flew out of my mouth.  Bleeding and pissed, I marched right up to him and looked him square in the eye.  Without warning or hesitation, I punched him as hard as I could right in the jaw.  While he was on the floor, I grabbed my bag and ran out the door.  He was on his feet quickly and tackled me, quarterback style, in the middle of the driveway.  He started to punch me repeatedly, in the ribs, in the stomach, in the face.  He was still spitting at me, calling me every name under the sun, and saying he never loved me in the first place.  I managed to flip him off of me, and we repeated the cycle of him tackling me and punching me.  By the time we made it to the street, he decided that it wasn’t worth it to continue fighting with me anymore.  My guess is he was momentarily spooked at the thought that other people might be able to see him.  But my adrenaline was pumping too hard and too quick at this point to simply run away down the street.  I turned around and this time I tackled him.  I threw him down onto the pavement and positioned one knee on his chest and one on his neck.  I grabbed him by the hair and slammed his head into the road.  He didn’t fight back at all.  This pissed me off even more, so I slammed his head one last time for good measure.  I told him that his days of using me as a punching bag were over.  I told him that I had “let” him get away with hitting me for the last time, and if he ever laid his hands on me in anger again, I would kill him.  I would absolutely fucking kill him.

      Background:  Her Highness and her husband are off on an island vacation for the whole week. (and yes, the mistress is with them.  Nice, huh?)  Fatty has been recruited to spend the week here and take care of Nasty Pants Grandma.  I have resigned myself, since I am not the one who stands to receive a couple hundred dollars for babysitting this week, that I am not going to clean anything this week.  I cleaned up on Friday to give a good base going into the week, but you can’t tell now.  I was in a very good mood all day.  After my five-day weekend, I was actually glad to get back to work and out of this house.  I did a little shopping after work, and decided to pick up something to spruce up the mailbox.  I bought flowers, mulch, and spray paint for the mailbox and post.   The Issue:  I finally walked into the house around 8 p.m. I walked straight past the kitchen with the dishes and food all over the counter and the trash overflowing.  I talked with Fatty, started my computer, played with the dog while waiting for AOL to connect, and then decided to go to the bathroom.     First thing I noticed was the puddle of water on the floor with the soggy newspaper right smack in the middle of it.  And no toilet paper left on the roll. Oh, and look! Fatty had a bowel movement and clogged the toilet for the 6th time since Friday!  Oh joy!  While I was busy being disgusted at the idea of having to plunge the toilet and have it overflow onto the floor AGAIN, something caught my eye…my razor was out on the counter, clogged with little red hairs.  Shaving cream all over the sink, hairs inside the sink and all over the counter.  Son. Of. A. Bitch!!!  But all I could see were the little hairs in my razor.  That goddamned motherfucker stole my razor again! AGAIN!!  Good God, are you shitting me?    I had to come and write this down to try to diffuse some of my anger before confronting Fatty about my razor.   I don’t think it worked.  I’m actually more fired up now than I was walking out of the bathroom.  And I still didn’t fucking pee.  Son of a bitch

      My boyfriend, his brother, and his friend all have this theory that bugs the shit out of me.  “Women aren’t funny. “  Being a woman and someone who has always prided myself on my ability to make people laugh, I was naturally offended by this “observation” of theirs.  For the record, I am NOT a feminist.    These are three guys who honestly are lacking in the looks department; receding hairlines, at least 80 pounds overweight, and are all devout fans of pro-wrestling, WWE style.  They have lumped themselves into a self-appointed elite category of men who are better than EVERYONE else in mainstream America.  Needless to say, with the exception of my boyfriend, they have little to no contact with women outside the workplace (those of them who DO work).  I will say that they have all had their moments where they have made me laugh.  I tend to see humor in just about every situation, so it is natural that anyone can make me laugh.  But they think they are this supreme trinity of comedians, and no one else could ever measure up to their standards of funny.  I’m willing to bet that part of their sexism is derived from their lack of relations with women.  They’re jaded and understandably so.  When you go the better half of your life without finding someone who wants to be within 3 feet of you, you might get a little bitter.  But to branch out and say that women are inherently flawed somehow and lack the DNA to make genuinely funny observations, jokes, or statements is ridiculous.  So I tried to have this conversation with my boyfriend to figure out where this misogyny originated.  He launched into this very animated lecture on how guys just “get” other guys, and that guys’ behavior changes the minute a girl walks into the room, and that the only reason that guys have probably laughed at anything I’ve ever said was because they wanted to get into my pants.  Hold up- to discredit a trait I happen to hold dear to my personality simply based on sexual desire is not acceptable.  I refuse to believe that I am NOT funny.  I’ve always been the one in the group to make people laugh.  Shit, I’ve made my BOYFRIEND laugh.  So what the fuck does that mean?  To tell me that I’m not funny insults my intelligence, my perspective on the world, my life experiences and history, and my identity as a woman.  And who the fuck are you and your elite crew to be making these decisions?  What credentials do you have to make this decree?  And how many women do you know, collectively, to be able to ascertain this fact and use it to make a blanket statement against all women everywhere?  My boyfriend tried, in his own way, to understand my point of view, but spared no time in pointing out that of course I would feel this way because I am a woman.  And he also pointed out that there was no logic to my argument.  So now that I am an illogical, unfunny woman I am inclined to ask what he’s doing with me in the first place?  To which he replies, “You happen to be the ONLY girl I know who is funny.  You’re ridiculously funny, and I knew that from the beginning.  But you’re the exception to that rule.”  Oh, gee…thanks.

      I’m angry.  What else is new?    Let me first start off by saying that I do not believe that I am crazy or psychotic.  I will concede to being paranoid and neurotic, but I believe that both of these behaviors take root in events that have happened and that continue to follow me now.  These behaviors are a learned response; they are second nature to me now, not because I enjoy creating drama or because I have a chemical imbalance, but rather because my mind has been programmed to automatically react to these situations I find myself in on a fucking daily basis.  I live with people who are inconsiderate and petty.  I’m not talking about the kind of inconsiderate jerk who walks through a door and leaves it to slam in your face rather than holding it open for you as any decent person would.  I’m talking about the kind of jackass who would blow through a door and then stop to pull it shut behind them just so they can make a point of not holding it open for you.  Ok, maybe that’s taking it a bit too far, but at the very least, these people would look you in the eyes and then not hold the door.  I find that unfathomably inconsiderate.  My boyfriend believes that I am crazy.  He cannot come to terms with the evidence or even the presumption that his family, specifically his mother and brother, are actually doing things with the sole intention of making my life difficult.  I can fully appreciate his position- this is his family and he has every right to want to protect his image of them and their reputations.  At the same time, the things that I have seen and experienced cannot be denied.  And to have him dismiss me with an insult to my emotional stability absolutely infuriates me.  Granted, if you isolate each of the incidents, I do seem crazy and paranoid.  But when you take a step back and look at the big picture, the pattern of “inconsideration” transforms into something else, something much more sinister.  Ok, you need examples?  You don’t believe me either? Fine.  Go get a drink and make yourself comfortable.  I have in my arsenal story after story to illustrate my point.    Example 1: About two years ago, I decided to clean the laundry room because the 20 mounds of clothes were beginning to drive me crazy.  I spent three days sorting, washing, folding, and putting away laundry in the basement.  I scrubbed the floor and cleaned the gunk off of the washer and dryer.  When I went to go back up the stairs into the living room, I tripped over a laundry basket and pile of clothes that someone had thrown down the stairs and “forgotten” about.  (Everyone in this family seems to suffer from these memory lapses.  I am of the opinion that they just don’t give a shit and leave things laying around knowing full well that I will end up cleaning or putting them away.)  So I picked up the clothes and brought them over to the laundry area and proceeded to simultaneously place them in the washing machine and curse whoever did this for being such a dick.  When I get back upstairs, his brother asks me to bring his clean laundry out to his car.  Fuck you, no.  I ended up saying that I was tired and that since I had washed and folded them, I didn’t think it unreasonable for him to bring them to his car.  He got pissy.  So about an hour later, I went down to finish my latest load of laundry.  Low and behold, there are clothes strewn everywhere!  My neatly folded piles were now lying on the floor.  The clothes that were in the dryer were sitting in a pile in front of the dryer, and the dryer door was still open with the cycle dial still set where I had left it.  And his brother’s cleaned clothes were nowhere to be found.  Of course I got upset.  I told my boyfriend.  He didn’t believe that his brother did any of that “on purpose.”  He said he was just clumsy and probably didn’t realize what he was doing.  “He’s just messy.”    Are you fucking kidding me?  Knocking over the piles I might be able to understand.  But when you go so far as to take wet laundry out of the dryer and throw it on the floor, I’m not supposed to think this was done on purpose?  That this is some kind of retaliation for me not taking your laundry to your car?    Example 2 Morning coffee.  This is the example I gave my boyfriend that sparked the crazy comment.  I believe when this incident is isolated it can make me seem paranoid.  But taken in conjunction with all of the other shit his mother pulls, you will have to agree that she is being petty.  When I first moved in, I thought it would be nice to set up the coffee maker at night so when his parents came downstairs, all they had to do was turn the machine on.  I set up their mugs, the sugar bowl, the spoons, and even measured out enough coffee so that there would be enough for them to have at least 2 cups each.  It took me all of two minutes to do this for them.    Eventually, I fell out of this habit.  I would still do it every once and a while, but not every night as I had been doing.  Apparently, this somehow offended Her Highness. I started to notice that on the nights when I hadn’t set up the coffee, there would be none left for me in the morning.  No big deal- how much effort does it take to make a new pot?  But I did a little experiment just to satisfy my own observation and to prove that I wasn’t imagining her little slight.  Sure enough, every time I set up the coffee, there was plenty left over for me before I left for work.  On the days where I didn’t make it, there was none.  I had to chuckle to myself at the sheer pettiness of her behavior.  So my response to the whole incident was to stop making it for them completely.  Now I pretty much know to expect to make my own coffee in the morning. No big deal.  Petty shit man.  The whole point is that I know these things are being done on purpose.  To try and rationalize them to someone who isn’t involved with this every day is maddening because it does sound loony.  And I’m not the kind of paranoid where I believe people are out to steal what I have or out to get me.  I believe this shit is being done for the sole purpose of pissing me off.  And everyone here takes for granted my people-pleasing personality.  They count on me not saying anything or confronting the issue.    And Her Highness wonders why I would rather spend all of my time upstairs in my room.

      During yesterday's storms, it appears that our house was struck by lightning.  Fatty was here using the computer when he heard the crash.  The lightning took out the cable, zapped all the phones (except mine, yay) and tv's, and finally decided to depart after blowing up my radio.   None of us knew any of this had happened when we got home.  It took 2 hours of Her Highness' storming up the stairs, repeatedly asking me to get off the phone line (when I wasn't on it), huffing and puffing, and cabinet slamming before she called Fatty on her cell phone to see what happened.  I believe the conversation went a little something like this:  (HH)  What happened to the cable?  (F)  Uh, I dunno.  (HH)  Well, the phones don't work either.  (F)  Uh, I dunno.  (HH)  Whaddaya mean you don't know?  (F)  Uh, it coulda been the lightning.  (HH)  So you knew we were hit by lightning and you couldn't leave a note?  (F)  No, I got scared and went out to my car for a while.  Then I went home.  (HH)  So how am I supposed to use the computer now?  (F) Uh, I dunno.   *       *       *       *       *

      Did you ever read a physician's "diagnosis book"?  You know the ones- where they list the diseases and all the possible symptoms, causes,  and contraindications.  My high school nurse had one in her office.  I picked it up one day and convinced myself that I had a tumor on my knee.  It turned out to be a blood blister.  But anyway, I believe names of the majority of Her Highness' illnesses come from a similar reference material:  WebMD.com.  She goes on there and types in a few symptoms, and the next thing you know she's got lupus or something.  She memorizes all the major symptoms and then runs off to the doctor to get a prescription filled.  Perhaps the powers that be should investigate the ethics behind her doctor's quick jump to prescribe narcotics, but I'm sure that will never happen.  It would be too karmic for me.  But it's Thursday, and you know what that means! It's "let's go down to our other house!" time. So yeah, she was practically dying the other day, and now she's fine.  There are half-emptied bottles of pills laying all around the living room to serve as a weekend reminder that Her Highness was sick.  I'm willing to bet $5 that she's ill again when she returns.  I guess coming home to your mundane lie of a life will do that to you.

      I was spotted by Her Highness, only to be engaged in the following conversation:  (HH)  "I feel bad that you leave [the dog] in the cage all day."  (Me)  "Well, if someone would walk him while I'm at work, I wouldn't have to."  Side note:  I put the dog in the cage one day about two weeks ago.  The only time he's been in there since is to hide his bones and occassionally, of his own volition, to sleep behind me while I'm at the computer.  (HH, completely missing my point)  "Yeah, but it's mean.  You got a thingy in the mail.  I left it on the table."  (Me)  "Ok, I'll get it tomorrow."  Another side note:  The only things on the table right now are a half-chopped onion and some rotting fruit, complete with requisite fruit flies, and a Sports Illustrated magazine addressed to Fatty.  (HH, partially under her breath even though she's standing right in front of me)  "That's so mean.  I could never do that."  (Me, daring her to engage this)  "Do what?"  (HH)  "Are you working tomorrow?  Because I needed to go to the store."  (Me, again)  "Do what?  What did you mean?"  (HH)  "I have to go to the store to pick up that thingy for [Fatty]."  Another side note:  She has her own car.  It just came back in perfect working condition from the mechanic.  What the hell her having to go to the store and me working have in common escapes me.  (Me, wondering what the point of this conversation is)  "Ok."  (HH)  "Yeah, so are you sure you didn't get the thingy on the table?"  (Me)  "The mail?"  (HH)  "Yeah, I left it right on the table."  (Me)  "Nope."  (HH, shooting me that fake motherly smile)  "Ok, goodnight hon."  (HH, turning back around)  "But I wouldn't want to be caged up all day.  I'd rather be playing and running around."  (Me)  "Ok, goodnight.  But I wouldn't cage him if people would walk him during the day."

      It's a quarter to midnight, and I just got home. Her Highness is lurking around downstairs, banging silverware in a cup and slamming doors in her "NOTICE ME!!!" mode. I am hiding out in my room, with the lights turned off, trying to type silently so as not to be noticed and backed into a conversation corner.  I saw her briefly this afternoon when she emerged from her room to give us all an update on her condition. I must say that for someone who is complaining of head-to-toe hives, her skin looked pretty damn clear to me. She did look a bit groggy, though, which I guess we can blame on the prescription of Percocet she's taking.  As an aside, I don't remember being prescribed Percocets when I had hives earlier in the year. And I don't seem to remember the hives hurting enough to warrant a pain medication, but whatever.  We can add "my stomach is killing me" to the list of symptoms today. "This diuretic is making me sick." Hmm, don't remember being prescribed a diuretic for the hives, either. All I got was a killer combo of elephant strength Benadryl and some amoxicillin to reduce swelling. But alas, I am not an MD, so what do I know?  Grandma is all up in arms because she hasn't won the lottery. "I have to take off this damned yellow shirt. I never have luck when I wear the yellow. Oh, no. And this fingernail is starting to fall off. Look at it." (And she proceeds to pry it from her dirty finger). "Don't get old, dear. It's terrible. Oh, yeah." (gutteral throat clearing)  I hear the cup and silverware banging getting closer to my door now. And right on cue, here come the heavy sighs as we round the top of the stairs. (I am now in stealth mode, typing with the monitor off...) The trick will be sneaking into my room and closing the door before she notices I'm home.  Dammit! I've been detected. Grrr...

      Just for shits and giggles, I've decided to try to keep a running tab on Her Highness'  and her mother's "Disease du Jour" for a while.  I want to see if there are any patterns, or if they keep coming up with the same ailments for lack of a creative imagination.  I can't count how many double-whammy bladder and kidney infections Her Highness's had that require a super cocktail of antibiotics and painkillers or how many times she's gone to the hospital with "anaphlactic shock."  Those episodes really crack me up.  But I'll have to start with today, since it's Sunday, and go from there.   Sunday, 8/08/04   Her Highness: She has hives, which in her mind necessitated a trip to the emergency room because of the "burning, stinging sensation in [my] legs."  She is still working on a bladder and kidney infection from last week, and since she's still "suffering" from it, I'm counting it.  Creepy Grandma: That nagging heart-attack feeling is back, and she's self-medicating with blood thinners and Budweiser beer.

      The husband was off from work today.  We both got up around 8 a.m. and had coffee together.  I had wanted to drive down and visit my grandfather today, so I jumped in the shower early.  When I got out of the shower, I noticed that the husband was gathering a bunch of stuff outside around the stairs.  I went outside to see what he was up to.  He was trying to fix the broken stair that Fatty demolished.  I could not, in good conscience, let him do this by himself given his arthritic condition.  So the two of us spent the better part of the day rebuilding the entire set of steps.  I got my radio and brought it outside for him to listen to the Yankee game while we worked.  All in all, it was a satisfying experience.  My boyfriend came back home from Fatty's apartment a little after 2 p.m.  His father looked at him and asked where Fatty was- he was supposed to come over today and help him fix the stairs.  Wait a minute...  So my boyfriend said, "Oh, maybe he didn't know he was supposed to come over today."  To which the father replied, "Oh, he knew.  That's where he got the $50 from."  No FUCKING way.  Fatty was asked to come help his father (who is severly arthritic and legally handicapped because of his condition) fix the steps that  HE  broke, and,  AND  he was paid $50 upfront as an incentive to show up.  I FUCKING FIXED FATTY'S BROKEN STEP- for no payment or hope of one, and Fatty was rewarded with $50 for breaking the fucking thing in the first place?!?  Are you KIDDING me?      .    .    .    .  On another note, still Fatty related, Her Highness came back from her "trip" with the lover and told everyone that Fatty has just been accepted into William Paterson University.  "He wants to study History!"  Please excuse me for not feeling any emotion besides "whoop-dee-fucking-doo."   That motherfucker still hasn't thanked me for the birthday gift I got him.

      I wanted to start off by saying, "I can't understand why...", but the truth is that I DO understand the "why" behind this story.  And knowing the background on Her Highness helped only to elicit another disapproving head shake.  Apparently, I am involved in some kind of contest Her Highness has running inside that neurotic head of hers...  My boss asked me to make an appointment with her hair stylist so she could get a touch-up before she leaves for vacation this weekend.  We got to talking about my hairstyle, and my boss offered to treat me to a new hairdo if I went with her.  So when I got home, I naturally mentioned this to everyone since I was a bit apprehensive about changing my look.  When I got back from the hair appointment, I walked through the door to find that Her Highness had ALSO been inspired to make a change to her hairstyle.  She did the whole "Oh, I don't like it- what do you think? Does it make me look (insert any negative adjective so that you are forced to answer with a compliment)?"  She pranced around the living room, playing with her hair and acting like her usual fake-happy self.  The issue I have is not that I wanted everyone to ooh and ahh when I made my entrance.  I actually had my hair tied back because it was still wet.  Just the underhanded manner in which she felt obligated to get her hair done, the same day and an hour before I came home,  just to "out-do" me pisses me off.   And for the record, her hair looks stupid.  She got most of it chopped off and let it go to it's natural curly state.  For a woman of 55, walking around with an 18-year old's blonde, curly bob is not a good idea.   I am starting to feel like she's competing with me in everything I do anymore.  If I buy new curtains or even WASH my curtains, she'll run right out and buy more expensive (and more tasteless) curtains just to prove some kind of point.   My boss gave me a couple of bags full of mostly-new clothes she didn't have room for anymore.  Her Highness was somehow threatened by this and decided that rather than buying new furniture for the living room (which is still rug-less and semi-furniture-less), her money would be better spent on a new wardrobe.  And it's ridiculous that she bought almost the same style of clothes that my boss gave me.  I'm at a point with her where I can't even force myself to smile when she's in the room anymore.

      So I'm thinking about all the things that I think are wrong with this family, and I know that I'm not faultless, by any means.  I've been asking myself those stupid "who am I?" questions for a while now, but I decided to actually answer them this weekend.   Control- Janet Jackson Style:   I am a control freak.  I have no desire to control other people in the sense that they are my wards, sent out to do my bidding.  Rather, I am a person who is most content when everything in my immediate environment is clean and orderly and when I know exactly what my limitations, obligations,  and expectations are.  I am a person who needs to have a space in the world that is entirely mine; a place where I can find sanctuary.   I am having a particularly difficult time adjusting to this house because a) it isn't mine, so I can't readily change what I don't like (that being the dirt and clutter and smells and people in it), and b) I don't feel like I actually "own" any space here.  I have completely sacrificed control, and therefore a large part of my personality, and my body and mind are starting to rebel against this.    Different Strokes:   I am EXTREMELY judgemental, although I have to say that my first impressions of people are usually dead on.  I am hyper-critical, obviously due to my own insecurities.  Sometimes I wish I wasn't like this, but at the same time, I think that by consciously excluding people who initially rub me the wrong way, I am saving myself a great deal of heartache and headache in the long run.    The Wall:   (sigh)  I am completely emotionally unavailable.  While I believe in and think I want to have romantic love, I find it incredibly difficult to allow myself to  be  loved.  My boyfriend says this is a defense mechanism brought on by previous relationships with the men in my life.  The mere notion of physical closeness with my boyfriend, or any other man for that matter, makes me shudder.  I want to be open and be able to feel a reciprocal intimacy, but that part of me seems to have shut down.  This doesn't mean that I don't FEEL love for my boyfriend.  In fact, I love him more than I've ever loved any man, even though he can piss me off more than anything.   Part of me absolutely refuses to let another guy hurt me.  I will not stand for any hint of mistreatment, hypocrisy, mysogyny, condescension, etc, in a romantic relationship.  If I feel as if I'm being treated unfairly, I can actually feel a wall closing down over me, shutting every emotion, except anger, down.  I want to be loving.  I want to be affectionate.  I guess deep down I'm terrified of feeling the pain and humiliation of rejection.  I'm actually more affectionate and expressive with my dog than I am with any human.  I'm having a hard time coming to terms with this.  I mean, I know that it's fact, but I never thought I was "one of those people."  I'm not sure what to do or how to approach turning this emotional unavailability around.  And the thing is, it's not like I don't have emotions.  I have them, alright.  And they're usually pretty damn strong.  So yeah, I have no idea how to change this, but at least I recognized that it is an automtic way of being for me.  That has to be a good step.

      So Monday night, when I came home from work, I noticed that the same middle step leading to the back porch was broken.  Again.  Pieces of stair were lying on the ground, along with the overturned flower pots.  Jesus Christ, Fatty wuz here again.   The step was JUST replaced within the week, and his fat foot went crashing through it.  This guy is out of control.  It is now officially Thursday, and the step is still broken.  The flower pots are still overturned.  There's soil all over the place, and everyone just ignores it.  What else can I do besides shake my head and stretch my legs to accomodate the larger-than-usual step I now have to take to get up onto the back porch?  His parents should make him fix it this time.  Someone needs to make him accountable for his destructive behavior, not condone it by ignoring it.  Just once, I wish that man would have a moment of self-awareness.  I wish he could see that he's really just a horrible,  self centered, undisciplined, developmentally arrested, lazy sack of shit.  And while he's having his moment, let his mom share in one of her own.  And I am well aware that I am not perfect.  See the next entry for notes on my date with the magic mirror...

      I've had a rather emotional week, and I'm not quite sure where I want to begin today. I think I'm going to have to break this up into a couple of entries...  Let's start with Friday.  I wanted to take my boyfriend out and celebrate him finally taking the Bar and my getting a raise. We were going to go down to the shore and have a picnic, but first I needed to take my boss' car to my mechanic for an oil change.  The ride to my mechanic went fine- nothing of importance to report. When we got there, I was talking with the mechanic about the usual bullshit, when he told me that he finally met Fatty. (My mechanic was working on Her Highness' truck, and I guess Fatty drove her over to see how the work was progressing.) My mechanic then informed me that I have to be a horrible driver to have caused all that damage to Fatty's car.  WHAT?  Ok, I will concede to hitting the basketball pole in the driveway about 3 years ago. I dented the side panel, which they opted to not fix. But since then, Fatty has hit parked cars, backed into cars in his own driveway, hit guardrails, and he actually drove into the outside wall of a Blimpies. Half of his front bumper is hanging off, there are dents up and down the sides of the car, and the back bumper has huge chunks missing. I DID NOT have anything to do with these other mishaps. And apparently, Her Highness confirmed that I did, in fact, cause ALL the damage to his car.  This pissed me off on a couple of levels. 1) He's trashing me for wrecking his car because he can't cop to being a bad driver, 2) He's telling his mom that I'm causing all this damage to his car (when I can't even drive his car because his fat ass  COLLAPSED  the seat, causing the entire thing to jump off its track. He had to wedge the fold-down seat in the back behind his seat to keep it in the upright position.), and 3) Her Highness was  IN THE CAR WITH HIM  when he hit the Blimpies.  I happen to like my mechanic, who is also a good friend's father, very much. Maybe I'm overreacting, but the thought of him believing that I'm such a wreckless driver really upsets me. And the fact that Her Highness actually agreed that I caused this damage really set me off.  Thankfully, my boyfriend told the mechanic that yes, I did hit the basketball pole, but I didn't cause any of the other damage around the rest of the car. He said that that was typical of his brother's behavior- to blame anyone else for his mistakes.  So on the way home, I told my boyfriend that, while I didn't want to make an issue of it, I thought it was particularly shitty of his brother to say those things and for his mom to affirm them. Immediately, my boyfriend turned to face the window. I knew this was going to be a sore spot for him. So I said that I would never make up shit about either of them (fortunately, they provide enough real-life stories that I don't have to get creative), and I was kinda offended. I was going to leave it at that.  Well, my boyfriend launches into this whole defense of his family (which is understandable) and tells me that it's not a big deal. Then he went on to say that he wouldn't let things like that bother him. So I said, "Well, then I guess you're a better person than I am."  (Boyfriend shouting) "Yeah, actually I am better than you! Take me home!"  We drove the rest of the way home in complete silence, although I was absolutely seething with anger. How DARE he! I always knew he had this "holier than thou" attitude, but until that moment, he had always managed to aim it at everyone else. Needless to say, we never went on our picnic.  Bright and early Saturday morning, I met up with Her Highness in the kitchen. Without missing a beat, she launched into the whole "Oh, when we said you did that to the car, we were joking. Ha ha."  Yeah, ha ha.  So I told her that I really didn't understand how she could believe I had done all of that damage (because if shit hits the fan, I will NOT be responsible for any of it), especially when she was with him the last time he hit something. And I told her that I didn't appreciate having lies told about me to people I have professional relationships with.  "Oh, we all thought he knew it was a joke. We said that because we were embarrassed." (Lalalala in her fake, everyone loves me voice)  I got even more pissed at my boyfriend for blabbing about the whole thing to his mom. I didn't speak to him until Monday night, when he practically followed me around the house asking inane questions (wonder where he gets that from?). He apologized and said that he was only joking when he made that "better than you" comment.  Like the jerk that I am, I made him work for an apology.  (Him, being all sincere) "I don't actually think that I'm better than you. I didn't want you to think that I'm better than you."  (Me, in my emotionally unavailable way) "Oh, don't worry. I KNOW that you aren't better than me."  (Him) "I'm sorry I said that. I thought you'd know I was joking. I didn't mean it."  (Me) "Good."  Eh, situation resolved, I guess. This family needs to work on their joking style.
