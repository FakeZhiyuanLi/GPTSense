      Is a pretty accurate reflection of how I'm feeling today....  We are in the process of moving house - everything seemed to be fine and ready to exchange then complete on the 23rd and move into our lovely new house..  Our current home is far too small for us - we have 2 kids and just a small 2 bed mid link - our new house is great HUGE kitchen, conservatory, dining room, big lounge, 3 bedrooms etc etc - it will be so lovely having all of the extra space...  Today we happily trotted to the solicitors to sign our contract and the solicitors dropped the bombshell........our house has been down valued by the mortgage valuation surveyor which leaves us in limbo - our buyer wants us to drop the price, we cant afford it and if it isnt resolved in the next day or so we will lose the house....  I cant contemplate how awful it will be for that to happen, I really dont think I have the inclination or strength or time to go through the whole process again...  :( :( :(  Fingers crossed for good news tomorrow PLEASE

      I joined weightwatchers when my youngest (now 10 months) was 6 weeks old....I have done quite well and lost 1.5 stones but I have taken soooo long to do it as I just love food (particularly crap, unhealthy food).  Today is weigh in as usual Im attempting to starve myself because Ive been so naughty during the week....  I went out for lunch yesterday to TJI Fridays and had Chicken Fajita's. Saturday night I was out on the town with girls and drank copious amounts of vodka and ended up in a kebab *ick* shop on the way home - unfortunately it stayed down so I will have to count it! Im hoping to have lost a pound tonight but realistically if I stay the same I will have got off lightly!!  I want to lose another half a stone for now then before the wedding another half stone so Im super slim and bony shouldered on my big day....

      This is a good place as any to record my wedding planning....  H2B proposed on valentines day this year (I KNOW!!! I hate how cliched it is but hey!)  We have decided on next summer but havent fixed a date yet as I cant bloody decide on a venue!!!  The short list so far is this.......... http://www.longhirst.co.uk http://www.otterburntower.com  http://www.themoffitt.com http://www.jerseyfarm.co.uk  http://www.whitworthhall.co.uk We went to see http://www.closehousemansion.co.uk yesterday and really liked it only to discover it is shutting down next month *argh*  We are paying for the wedding ourselves and I'm starting to worry that with 2 young kids, a new house to decorate, no holiday for 10 years and a car in need of replacement we have better things to spend 10k on but I JUST WANT TO BE A PRINCESS FOR THE DAY!!! Logically we should just bugger off and do it on the cheap but I think I would feel permanently dissapointed I didn't get my *big* day.....so.....here we are Wedding Planning hell!

      I came across someones blog and it was the first time I had seen a blog.  I thought "I want a blog", so I googled "blog" and Blogger.com came up so I created my own blog....  ....but I still don't know what a blog is?
