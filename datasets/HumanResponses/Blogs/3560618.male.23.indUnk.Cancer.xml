      Whatever you do, dont live there. It would be a waste of life. This town has nothing to offer me and I hate it. I want to go back to Cincinnati where I had everything, here Im confined to a 10mi radius of everything that sucks. Unfortunatly Im stuck here and ASAP Im outa here. Like my wife's family, town sux. IF this were Houston or Dallas, life could be good. This place is a waste of dirt.

      Always have the problem of starting a story and not knowing where to go with it. My ambition is to write a book but about 10 to 15 pages in I have no Idea what to do next. I think I will resign myself to short stories for now and just get published. Hopefully I will get accepted into the journalism program at ASU. I dont want to be stuck working in the pits of lower management for the rest of my life. My sights are set on supervisor in a month and a half... but you probibly dont want to hear it, sorry!

      Getting ready for work is such a masochistic task. My jobs not hard at all but Im tired and want to go to sleep. Harry Potter was pretty good. I enjoy the new directors style. As for Dumbledore he looks the same but sounds and acts different. But I like the new Dumbledore better. The new direction makes the movies a little darker, just as the books do. I look foreward to the next two movies and the sixth book. My time grows short and I must be off to my personal hell....work. If it was my choice I would never have to work, but such is life.

Anyone who reads this that has a Warhammer Fantasy army for sale let me know now that I have money. I think my Army priority is Wood Elves, Dark Elves, Undead (Any Type), Orcs, Humans.

      The truck stopped in front of the green rear security door. The .40 cal machine gun opened a volley upon the door. The hail of led penetraited through the aluminium and smashed the lock beyond recognition. The two men in the front jumped out of the beaten truck cab. Both carried AK-47s with 30 round banana clips with gas masks. One had very old and shifty eyes, the kind of a war veteren that had been in the feild too long. The other man was very young and green. The older man pulled open the remains of the dorr while the other covered the hallway inside.       White light, white walls, and a white tile floor almost blinded the men. Both of them rushed down the hallway."We need lab 12," belted the older man. "Were at lab 15 now," screamed the other.       As they ran two security gaurds rounded the corner.

           The laboratorys were quiet at this time of night. All research personnell has gone home, the lab animals are asleep, and all thats left is the security gaurds watching moniters and making their rounds. The perfect time to strike.      This time of year was cold in Germany. "There is usually snow on the ground, but it has ben unseasonably warm," though Klaus as he looked over his load drop off schedual. He was a lone gaurd at the gate of United Deutschland Labs, Incorporated. Off in the distance the lights of a small truck peirced the black veil of the forest that surrounded the labs.      "Theres no material drops tonight,"thought Klaus. Klaus was a man in his late fourties, with brown withering hair and a moustache. Time was hard on this man, but tonight would be harder. The roar of the truck's enigine cam blasting up the drive. "This truck isnt going to stop,".      Klaus frantically pushed the gate close button, and the metal fencing gate closed. The truck came closer. There were two people in the back of the truck and two in the cab. "Stop or I will be force to fire," Klaus screamed as he drew his revolver. The truck flashed their high beams which momentairly blinded the fourty-something old man. Then the sounds of the .40 cal machinegun in the bed of the truck rang out and sent the fealing of searing flesh and penetraition through the security gaurd.     The gaurds body fell to the ground in a fleshy plop. Just in time to escape the bumper of the red truck as it smashed into the gate just beyond the body.
