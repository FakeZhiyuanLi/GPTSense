      This is going to be harder than i thought. it's been less than 24 hours, and I've already fallen off the wagon.  Last night, I actually found myself praying to God to please help me. To cut me some slack, not that I've a right to any, but to just let me appreciate what I've got, to see how I can become a better person, all that blah, blah, blah, bullshit.   And then, today, two e-mails. Two crushing e-mails and it's starting all over again. It's as if I was meant to die, to kill myself. I'm at my wits end, and I can never get a fucking break. I'm begging now for something good to happen, absolutely begging.   please.

      So, that's it. I'm finally bored of being angry, upset, sad, and mostly, a victim. When my sister calls me with bad news, I take the easy way out. Instead of going to the gym (which makes me feel excellent, though I never look forward to doing it), I cracked open the mini bottles of vodka that my shop keeps at the ready in the freezer (which makes me feel worse, never better, exacerbates the pain, and loosens my inhibitions and makes it easier for me to toss off nasty e-mails pushing friends and loved ones away). It's funny, that in a time of need, I would do something so counter-intuitive as intentionally isolate myself (which makes me even more sad, which makes me drink more).   So, I've decided to cut drinking, cold turkey, until I can figure out how to cope with things beyond my control and take control of things that rest within that realm. I have already lost a few friends along the way, but thank god I the ones I really trust, who are dear to me, can see my bullshit lashing out for what it is, and are standing by me.   Now is the time to grow the fuck up. To stop being a victim and stop squandering all that I can offer to my friends, my family, to myself.   Such new age bullshit. Hope it works.

      My sister just called; she saw my ma in the hospital. My mother is now on oxygen full-time, the doctors are thinking to put a tube in her stomach to feed her, and she now weighs something like 115 pounds--her weight in college, she's proud to note. According to my sister, my mother looks like a flat pancake, punctuated by hip, knee and elbow bones poking through her soft, almost mushy skin. I cry, but my sister says not to. It's always been like this with my mother, just a little worse each time. I cry a little harder, and I drink a little earlier in the day. It's not healthy, but I'm really not concerned with that at the moment. There's always time to recover later.

      I feel so light today. Easy in my skin. I have begun to extricate situations in my little life which cause more grief than pleasure. I'm not saying I'm not partly responsible (probably more like wholely), but whatever, whatever, its not working and I won't do it anymore. I want to wake up smiling, not dreading another fucking emotionally turbulent rollercoaster of a day.   Frustration, however, remains in my shit-hole job. Like I'm on a goddamned hamster wheel with no end, no satisfaction in sight. My mind atrophies each pathetic, useless day I sit here not contributing in any way to the betterment of mankind. That is what I am trained to do, the art of diplomacy, but I have most recently become productive in efficiently downloading illegal Mp3s off of bearshare.   Jesus fucking christ do I SUCK?!

      it's at a point now where i feel like i can't relate to anyone.   i'm living a violent, disturbing, destructive existence just below the surface and more and more recently, friends are beginning to see the tenuous grip i have on my sanity.   i'm bored, troubled, frustrated and i can't see a viable solution anywhere. i feel like an alien. and i'm afraid.

      I'm recently fed up of boys pretending to be men. The push-me pull-me routine is tired, and I'm done. But I was recently reminded of something I wrote about one of these assholes ages ago, and since it's the same asshole who's made me gone completely fed up just now, in honor of him, shall I post it as my first blog entry.     i love men, but i can't fucking stand a guy...    So, I can't sleep, cause I'm thinkin' about some dumb ass guy who's once again got me staring at the ceiling wondering who's pussy he's fingering tonight, cause it sure as hell ain't mine.   Let me start by saying that, as much as I wish I wasn't, I'm unfortunately heterosexual. I love making love to a man, I love holding a man, running my hands through is hair, admiring his big hands, feeling cuddly safe and shit in his big arms. And I love the wedding tackle or the bits and pieces, a nice, erect penis. I love that. Yummy.   So, I'm in bed thinking how much I love men, but man oh man, I fucking hate guys. In the same vein as Chris Rock, when he says he loves, loves, loves black people, but he can't stand a nigger (check his shit out at chrisrock.com, bigger and blacker), I wanna tell the world, or at least those of you who got this far, why I can't stand a guy.   A man is confident, not cocky. He is sure of himself whether he's in a bar with a beer, at the office, or walking down the street. He'll even come up and talk with you without any kind of bullshit pretense.   A guy is one arrogant mother fucker, but only when he's around his guy friends. A guy won't say dick to you on the bus, in a bar, unless he's drunk with the guys, and when he does finally say something to you (maybe trying to get your number) he'll start the conversation in such a way that you're not really sure if he's trying to be smarmy or set you up for an insult. That's his way of slinking away with a modicum of pride in case you shoot him down.   If a man wants to see you again, he'll take your number AND he'll call it with an invitation to do SOMETHING, whether it's something he had in mind or something you two work out. Either way, you'll hang up the phone knowing a specific time and place and exactly what kind of event you two will be doing, i.e. drinks, dinner, flying kites.   A guy will wait, a few days, weeks, whenever he ain't got anything better going on--you know, he's trying to keep it all low key, casual. When he does call, it will be to "hang out". You'll hang up the phone with a vague idea that you will be "hanging out" sometime over the weekend, but you'll have no fucking clue exactly what that will entail, how long you'll be together, and whether you should eat before, wear heels, or bother to get your nails did.   A man makes love. He kisses and caresses, and he is respectful of your body. He will touch you in a way that brings you to a higher plane of self-awareness. He'll knock your boots off and you'll be inclined to reciprocate, if not already simultaneously.   A guy wants to stick his cock in your pussy. I should know, a guy told me he wanted to do that just the other day. In his fascination (or surprise that he managed to get you naked) he will rub your breasts in a way that reminds you of having a mammogram. He'll ignore every part of your body except your vagina (which he will refer to as your pussy), your breasts (referred to as "tits", "knockers", "jugs" whatever, you've heard 'em all) and your mouth, though he's probably more interested in your using it to "kiss" his "cock" than he is in kissing it himself.   Even after engaging in sex, you will mutually continue to pursue a relationship with a man until it runs its course (be it break up or marriage). Dates will continue to be arranged, or, after rapport has been established, certain patterns emerge, but mostly, you'll always know where you stand with a man.   A guy is always looking for the next piece of tail. Once conquered, you lose luster in his eyes. Yeah, sorry, it's true, and don't let some bullshit guy tell you different. He's just trying to get into your pants. And are you "dating?" "Seeing" each other? Get out your guy decoder, cause he'll try to keep that shit as vague as possible for as long as possible. "We're just having fun, right?" That's his favorite way to avoid responsibility for your feelings and for his actions.   When the relationship's over, you'll sit down with a man, and have a conversation explaining why it's just not gonna progress, why it's better to part ways, and decide if, in time, you'll be friends or just call it a day. It will be sad, and disappointing, but it won't be a mystery why it didn't work out.   A guy will do one of two things:  1. he'll either phone you (yeah, right), e-mail (most likely), or even instant message you (my favorite) and tell you its not working for him. He'll tell you some bullshit about not having anything in common, despite however many months of "hanging out" or trips you took together, or family members you met. Or maybe he'll ask if you remember that girl he was sort of seeing a while back...yeah? well, good, cause she's actually his girlfriend.  2. He'll up and disappear. Poof! Whaaaa??? What happened? Exactly.   Whenever I hear some bullshit like "I'm just a regular guy" I want to stick my finger down my throat and gag myself, but I usually just roll my eyes and make a jerking off motion with my free hand. "I'm just a regular guy" is not your get out of jail free card for getting away with being lazy with someone else's feelings. If guys want to tomcat around and see how many notches they can accrue, fine, whatever, we all need hobbies. Just don't pull this lazy shit with a woman's feelings and be up front (which doesn't mean be an asshole) with what you want, what should mutually be expected. Plenty of women are looking for a little non-committal action. So quit trying to work out ways to stick your dick in as many orifices as (in)humanely possible by the stroke of midnight. And grow up, be a man.   So, while I love to love men, and oh god, do I ever, I fucking can't stand a guy.

      I've cancelled my membership to the NYSC. I'll tell you why: I can't, on principle, continue to fork over some 90$ a month for the privelage of being sneered at, dismissed, and generally treated like cattle in a sub-par, sub-equipped gym utilised by mostly snot-nosed marketing/advertising and finance dipshits. I just can't do it. And after 14 months and two dues increases, I'm putting my foot down.   Sometimes, in this last month, my lame-duck period before joining a new gym, I regret my decision. I do. Then those gym rat/assholes pull some stupid shit like shutting off all the lights to indicate the gym is closing in 15 minutes. Give me a fucking break. I'm not very vocal about my disatisfaction. I mostly hem and haw and grumble, but it's pretty fierce, and I can tell, they're noting it. And it's breaking through the icy shell of their still-frozen hearts.

      My sister just called to tell me that mom is doing ok. Except sometimes, Mom will lose conciousness and her eyes will roll back into her head for a few minutes before she recovers. She also mentioned that she saw Sue...Sue Williams, Mom's cousin who was brutally murdered with her sister, Patsy, some ten years ago. My sister doesn't think much of it. But frankly, it scares the shit out of me.

      Mmm, let's see. Monday. Pretty day. Feeling fairly decent and it's nice. Am seeing a nice guy, nothing special, but decent company. Have a date with another guy on Tuesday. Seems nice. Decent. Nothing special. Is it me? Are my expectations too high? Do I need constant stimulation? Invigoration? Aren't all "guys" selfish fucking egotistical bastards who use the companionship of women to validate their flagging egos? It sure as hell feels that way.   Spoke with my mom yesterday. She weighs 112. She sounded like she was drugged up beyond belief. I'm tired of people asking after her. They only do it to seem concerned and caring. But it's so fucking patronizing that I just want to slap them upside their heads. Instead, I just say fine and abruptly change the subject as if to say "QUIT FUCKING ASKING ME ABOUT MY MOTHER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE YOU DON'T REALLY CARE ANYWAY YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW WHEN ARE WE GOING TO HANG OUT OR GO SHOPPING OR JUST FUCK AROUND SO PLEASE JUST GET TO YOUR FUCKNIG POINT AND QUIT BRINGING UP MY FUCKING MOTHER FOR GOD'S SAKE." So, yeah, something like that.

      I have an overwhelming sense of frustration, a lack of interest in anything such as being with loved ones, shopping for fab shoes, eating good food, laughing joking, reading, sleeping, living in general, I can't see myself in any sort of career, don't know what to do with myself--thinking of escaping, but bored by the prospect of getting on a plane, going through customs, blah, blah, blah, only to find myself of the otherside and realize that all my problems, my frustrations, my anxieties stowed away on my carry-on.  I really fell for a lovely guy. He makes me laugh, and feel funny down there, and I never take myself seriously, at least not THAT seriously, when I'm with him. It wasn't reciprocated. And it's hard, because we've already been intimate, yelled at each other, fought, not fought, for months and months, and months, and it seems that he's really more attracted to the masochistic parts of our "relationship" that he was to me. And me, not wanting to get rejected AGAIN after putting myself on the line AGAIN, constantly pushed the fucker away, then changed my mind, then did it again, and again, and again.  Finally, though, I think I've done it. I'm tired of waiting around, always waiting around for this fucker to call, to write, I'm suffering, waiting, and I'd rather he's not there at all. So, that's it, good bye. GO AWAY. FUCK OFF ALREADY. And so now, I'm supposed to feel better, right? Well, I would, except I can't feel anything at all.

       The Bestest E-mail repartee EVER!!   From me:   You keep writing "be good." In a a sincere effort to comply, I just want to clarify the parameters of "being good", specifically, what constitutes "being bad": putting pennies on railroad tracks? eating three pints of ice cream in one sitting? or "going commando" in a short skirt during my subway commute? Just checking...  From him:   Apologies for not making the definition of good too clear. I will try to illustrate with examples:  Good things are eating and drinking too much, although being a fatty is bad. Putting coins on a railway track is bad, as it putting damsels in distress on railway tracks, however giving coins to damsels is ok. Going commando is very good, especially when wearing short skirts. I am an Army Commando, and I wear short skirts more than I go commando, which is also good. Other good things are curry, bikinis and lingerie. Bad things are women with beards, scorpions and any music made after 1990, except the music that I like. Bread is good, bagels are just bad bread.  Well, that's that covered.   Got to go - playing golf (also good).  with love  Me: swoon

      On being single: an unoriginal, tired-out, and heard throughout the Western world over and over and over again. Weren't we supposed to have this figured out by now? And please don't get me started on where the fuck my brilliant career has gone....I'll cry.   soraya:  just got back...distracted by the sales!  Angela:  naughty thing  Angela:  my god...that was a long lunch--did you find anything?  soraya:  yeah...had to buy dress for a wedding (not my wedding..) as have 4 more this year!  Angela:  oh that's right....good god  soraya:  yeah..have been to 3 so far and have another 4 this year...and a couple for next year already...definetely the year of weddings!  Angela:  please, I feel old and spinsterly-ish  soraya:  exactly how i feel too...always the bridesmaid and never the bride as they say...:(  Angela:  grrr. well, it doesn't help if your extremely flirtatious friends cut in on the man you declare early in the night as the "hottest thing since the sun"...as was the case on the night of my birthday  Angela:  i just can never seem to get a break.  soraya:  was that the guy who was going back to uk?  soraya:  well the guy you did have was very cute my friend!  Angela:  well, yeah, but I still declared him mine for the night!  Angela:  yes, but he's not very sophisticated, or interesting--he doesn't put the zing in the strings of my heart, as it were  Angela:  you always look to the bright side---bless you  soraya:  yeah, but hey you gotta have some fun too...even if only for a night!  Angela:  carpe diem? you're reading too many cosmos again!  soraya:  which is more than i can say for myself...has been nearly a year since i have got any action!  Angela:  i can't believe that.  soraya:  lucky i have pet rabbit...  Angela:  oh, tell me about it. my new best friend  Angela:  it will never cut in on your action and it always does what it's told  Angela:  my most satisfying relationship to date  soraya:  if only men could be so good!  Angela:  crack that whip!

      Wow. Wow, wow, wow.   I've met the perfect man. I mean, he's just luscious, beautiful, funny, smart, extremely and extraoridinarily well-traveled, tall and bascially EVERTHING I COULD EVER WISH TO SUMMON UP IN MY DEFINITION OF THE PERFECT MAN. And he's British. And he lives in the UK. And he's just got through a nasty divorce and is probably still suffering from the loss. Which means, not only is he physically not available, he's probably not emotionally available, either. So, like I said, he's perfect.   And I'm angry. And frustrated. And generally feel defeated.   For the very first time in my little life, I have met a man that I was truly, deeply impressed by. I mean, giddy nervous and delightfully shy. So much so, that I gave him absolutely no indication that I was t-totally into him. I did do my patented "flip to the fuck out" frustrated yelling thing at the end of an extremely alcohol soaked night, so he knows, now, how I feel, was probably pressing me to admit it earlier in the night with his hard stare asking me "why" to my question "do you want to come out with us?" Now he's gone. Gone, daddy gone.   And that, I suppose, for me, is the best kind of non-relationship with the most perfect man I've ever met, to not pursue.  Why would this happen to me? Please, can I get a break? And but quick??

      Went on a date last Wednesday. Very pleasant, well-dressed, articulate man in his early 30s. Things started smelling fishy when he wouldn't mention his place of work, launched into his deflowering story after a gin and tonic, and ultimately tried to bed me inside of 4 hours of meeting him. When I declined to house his penis for the evening, he quickly quipped "get thee to a nunnery" and hailed me a taxi just after mushing his salty, fleshy hole all over my face.   Fifteen minutes later, he called to say "hey-I think you're fun."   I thought: Oh, salvageable?  Nay, t'was not to be. All was lost the next afternoon when I received an e-mail which said: "hey-I think you're fun." And something about 'gotta run, babe.' Babe? Um, you'd better feel again.   Just another twat lookin' to score a slice of this hot cake. Thank god I jumped that shark before it bit.

       So I was mentally masturbating the other day...   ...and this is the spunk that came forth:  I never cook anymore. I used to be a great cook. Now, in my refrigerator, I got mushrooms with fungus growing on fungus. The irony of that does not escape me.   My "fiance" hasn't written. The fact that he's emotionally and physically unavailable makes him the perfect man, because, in effect, he lives only inside my head.  I don't like having sex with someone I'm not attracted to. WHOA. Until now, I've always been attracted to those I've humped. But this last kid, this boyish skater kid, he's the object of my affection in the same manner that my neighbor's golden retriever puppy might be. And the whining....god, enough already!  Yoga gets me high. The more I do this birkam, hard-core extremis shit, the less I want to drink or eat shitty foods. All I can think about is perfecting my postures and turning into a real yoga-dork, and, in the words of my beloved grams, I don't give a whit.   I hate ingrown hairs.  And lastly, this one's sheer genius: when you're happy, people flock to you like flies on shit. And I'm happy. (I'd be happier if my fiance wrote.)

       No one's better than me today.    I don't know if it's the blue skies, the clean jeans I'm wearing, or the superb I'm so popluar weekend/phone ringing off da hook I just had, but no one is better than me right now. Meaning, there's no where else or anyone else I'd rather be. It's contentment and it feels purer and cleaner than outright elation. And I like that. Very much.  It makes me think of Kevin, when, in a moment of selflessness/trying to cheer me up (or was it a moment of self-satisfying gloating?), he made a laundry list of things that made him happy at that very moment: paycheck in a few days, the purchase of a greeting card which would make the recipients happy, dinner engagements, etc. At the time, I thought, what a fucking tool, in light of the laundry list of things that were upsetting me at the time: news of my mother's worsening health, fretting over money, lame friends, and a general dissastisfaction with the state-of-my-life.   But today, as cliche as flipping a light switch on, my head is beginning to clear and I'm beginning to see the joys for living right now, in the moment, and relishing in the visceral joys of my ever-expanding social circle, increasing job satisfaction while still searching and applying for my dream job, and family-life skimming along better than expected, which is more than I can ask for.  So, here's my ultra-gay assertion that life isn't all that bad, and I'm just going to shut the holy hell up for a little while and enjoy it.

       You're my obsession.   In fact, today, there is very little that falls outside of that category, whether it's obessising about my phone not ringing enough (by the right people) or ringing too much (by the wrong), obsessing about Tuesday's 2nd interview, obsessing how how  FUCKING GORGEOUS  is the weather today, and that I have no one to hold hands, eat ice cream, walk around Little Italy and be gay with...in general, too much caffeine.  Latest  urlLink website obsession : it's been around for a long while, and it actually first came to my attention over a year ago when one of my "best of"  urlLink craigslist posting  was  urlLink featured on it . It's an obession, redux.  I obsess about acquiring this phone:     And obsessed with the fact, young man, that I can see you on the AIM, I can see you're not idle, and I can see that you are deliberately ignoring me. Well, I don't care.  Not ONE FUCKING IOTA!!!  Ass. You're not that cute, anyway.

       This is a man's world.   Don't believe me? Check  urlLink this out:   "...we offer a specialty product that fuels ego and heightens emotion, just like the fashion and adult entertainment industries do, but we do it by working as a custom tailor..."  I can guarantee they're not referring to a luxury product like a specially tailored sports car (such as VW's  urlLink Bugatti Veyron  on sale towards the end of the year for a cool $1.1 million--mark your calendars):     On a related note: My voyeristic nature and penchant for dirty talk with a brit-sohpisticate accent has led me  urlLink here . It's like reading a XXX-rated version of Bridget Jones' Diary.  Had interview yesterday. Went well. So well in fact, had an e-mail waiting for me when I got back to the office requesting a second interview. PLEASE GOD LET THIS BE THE ONE!

          Is it getting hot in here?   Yeah, it is, so shut the holy hell up and Ardha Chandrasana a little more, like you actually mean it.  It's been about 6 weeks, off and on, since I deluded myself into thinking that doing a series of 26 poses in a thousand degree room would whisk away all my ailments, find me a new job, a new body, and new boy, and basically and new life for a new me. For the most part, I'm delighted with the results thus far: smoother, softer, clearer skin, a deep sense of ass-kicking confidence every time I leave class, and the emergence of.....hamstrings. I thought I had left those in my high school gym locker, but it turns out, they were hiding out under a few inches of fat and cellulite (thank you  urlLink Bikram !).  Every now and then, my perception of the whole 90 minute sweatin' my balls off experience while finding inner peace and meditation is shattered. Inevitably, its always some dumb 30-something year old over-privileged, over-educated (read: expensive), but under-intellectual (read: beer bongs and too much Sex & the City) girl (who, btw,  might very well be the same bitch who pushed past me and the amputee in the subway to secure a 2 nano-second lead on the escalator ), who starts complaining that it's hot. It's hot? No shit, Einstein, it's called  HOT YOGA . At least that's what the four foot block letters hanging on the banner outside the door read.  Aside from the fourth-tier socialites who populate the class, I do find hot yoga becoming an obsession. Unlike weight-training or swimming, you must be in better than- or top-condition to complete the class. I can remember occasions when I might take in a pint half an hour before having a run at the gym. That's no longer the case: that beer I had  the night before  is stunting my strong bow, fucking up tadasana. You can't hide behind a treadmill, a Stairmaster...it's all you, and it's up to you to make it happen, to keep pushing, to do better, bend better, be better. It's the ultimate barometer for your physical and mental health...  Even though my trikanasana sucks ass, I do believe I've become a true convert. Bikram yoga is like an adult's Simon Says. The mind, Simon, says the players, your limbs, tissues and skeleton, can fold over like a sheet of paper. I feel like I can think clearer, I wake up stronger everyday, and pretty soon, I will have a new body, to go with my new job, and my new life. Simon says so.

        Dead drunk.    That's how I will die if I carry on the way I do. Thursday night I tallied up my cocktail intake: 14 drinks from 7:30 to 2 AM. Holy fuck. That's just gratuitous drinking...and to think, children in Africa are going without tequila shots and Cosmos, while I'm having thrice my fair share.  Here's a consumption breakdown:  2 Cosmos.  Realized, I don't work in marketing or PR and I don't live on the UES so I don't drink Cosmos.  2 Martinis.  Grey Goose (as if it matters?), straight up with a twist (for the anti-oxident properties).  2 shots tequila.  Well, hot-to-trot Jeremy arrived and wanted to get the party situated in the fast lane.  2 Glasses Sangria.  It just sort of arrived at the table without provocation.  1 mystery Shot.  No idea, except that there was tabasco. LOTS of tabasco.  2 shots Vodka.  Again, blame Jeremy.  1 shot tequila.  Never turn down a drink! It's rude.  1 more shot tequila.  This was just outright a bad idea.  1 last shot vodka.  It just appeared in my hand.  No wonder I was throwing up until noon the next day. I deserved to wake up in a pool of my own vomit with my entrails threatening to spill forth, yet my body takes it and more and wouldn't you know, I'm back at it on Saturday night.  Which can only mean one thing:  urlLink DETOX . I need a break. My wallet needs a break. My kidneys, my skin, my acid-burned esophagus needs a break. Today, I had three cups of coffee which I will eschew during the next two weeks. Literally, DETOX. Lemon/lime juice, bran, etc...all that shit. It's DETOX time. For my health, for my mental clarity, for prevention of midnight text messaging mania, I welcome DETOX with open arms.
