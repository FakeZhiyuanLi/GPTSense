      I've read in the Bible where is says "be anxious for nothing" but I'm finding hard to live it right now. I have a knot in my stomach feeling like there is too much to accomplish in 1 month and not enough willingness to do it (not on my part). Then I look at all I want to do and think that possibly there are some things I need to let go of until a later date. It is really difficult when all along the way I have come against a veritable "brick wall" to try to do things in advance. Now its crunch time and I can't sleep. What does that accomplish? Me being tired the next day and irritable. Now, not that I want the community [the Bridge or otherwise] to come calling and see what they can help with but it makes me think about this whole "sharing life" attitude. I'm not sure I completely buy that American culture can actually live it. We can't wait to turn 18 so we can move out on our own, we agonize over the thought of getting married or moving in with someone because we may lose our "independence". (Am overusing quotation marks? I owe it to Dodgeball) When our parents become of an age unable to care for themselves we put them in homes where others can take care of them, not us. Can a culture so saturated with the "ideal" of being independent...job, house, wealth etc really live as community? Maybe, but I think it's gonna take a big shift in the way people think. I suppose it starts with those who really want it to begin ingraining it in their children. Notice I said "their", I don't know if  I  want it. I guess I'm about to be thrust in 100% to try it out. I'll let you know how it goes. I'll tell you what though, yesterday I read the mail to my grandpa-in-law because he is blind. It felt good. I think I may like it. There will be challenges but I think it's going to be good. Now, back to worrying about how to get everything done.

      I am on the brink of moving in with my in laws, plus a grandpa. I am nervous, I'll admit. The reason for doing so is NOT to save money, but to help with the health problems of said in-laws...AWWW, how sweet- no not really. This last month is going to be nerve wracking to say the least. My one hope for this whole trasnsition is to bring a positive "vibe" (if you will) to the household. My tendency is to hide or complain to my husband. I read in James today (Living Bible) "Listen much, speak little and do not be angry." Prayers for this are appreciated. Also anyone who wants to help us move on July 24th, that's appreciated too. I promise this will be it for awhile...:) !

      Would it be, could it be, possible, for people - regular humans to tell each other if they have a problem? Whether it be with that person or something they said or did, or just in general. Secondhand information sucks. I want face to face conversation. Do you avoid it? If so, why? I am so much closer with the people who have the cajones to get in my face. Deep thoughts....

      I sold an item on Ebay that was broken when it arrived to the buyer. He insists on complete refund including shipping, I disagree. He also says it was packed badly and that the post office has no part in the damage. He was offered insurance and did not opt to buy it. I have offered him a refund, minus shipping. What would you do?

      Summer is upon us and by us I mean me. My kids get out of school tomorrow and then it is the great motherly challenge to find things to do other than super glue the TV on Cartoon Network and the kids to the floor. What kinds of things should one do to keep summer interesting, but not labor intesive? Suggestions?

      I was wondering how someone gets in the circus? Not that I want to join, but is is really something you run away to join? Are you born into it? Are you chasing a girl like in Big Fish? Well, whatever. We went on Saturday and it was great. I can't believe some on the things humans can do, or train themselves to do. Truly amazing. Not really sure what to think about the protestors. Did God create animals for our pleasure? I think so. Are they treated cruelly? Not that I saw, but you never know about that. I guess that would be the same for child abuse. You don't always suspect it or even see it. Does that mean we stop all people from having kids? What do you think?

      I had my wallet stolen on Tuesday. Well, lets just say someone forgot it in a cart at the store and when they came back another person had helped themself. You know I was wondering if it was some kind of judgement for lying. There was one of those guys with a can for the "Homeless Coalition" or something asking for money. Now I never have any cash on me. I am totally into electronic money. So I said "no, I don't have any cash" when he asked. As I was walking away I'm pretty sure God whispered, "you DO have cash." I recalled that we had taken some change and turned it&nbsp;into cash. So, yes indeed I had a pretty good load of cash to be honest. The change we turned in ended up being like $140.00. But at the time I didn't remember. So, after I DID remember I should have gone back and given the guy a&nbsp;few bucks at least. Now, hadI done this would I not have left my wallet in the cart? Who knows. All I know is, I really hope that whoever found it really needed it and wasn't just a slimy leech. The part that really is a bummer is calling all my banks, etc. to get new cards. I now have to wait 10 days to become electronically funded again. Thank goodness for the cash from my garage sale. Now I'm living on that. It makes me nervous though.&nbsp;I don't like carrying cash, it makes me feel vulnerable.&nbsp; So, pick a lesson learned:   A. Just bring the whole darn purse next time.  B. Make sure you really don't have cash before you refuse to donate a little.  C. Put one kid in charge of clearing out the cart before getting in the car. (Must have kids to choose this.)  D. Don't go to K Mart for a kiddy pool, just take them to the real pool, you lazy butt!   Any other lessons here? Please I'm really in need of character building right now. (Add Sarcasm, Please)  Well, Hopefully today will be a better day. Packing and moving, Yippee.

      Painting sux! I will always and forever have speckles of white paint embedded into my skin now. Why do the Trading spaces and HGTV's make it look so easy and fun?! I spent 18 hours in paint hell - but hey my living room looks good! Jared hates the fireplace. I painted it white. I'll have to post a picture and you can vote. I'm hoping once the furniture gets in it will take away the stark feel of it. Anyway, just thought I 'd share.&nbsp; Have a groovy day.

       Ok everyone, here's  my question of the day! Do men get their feelings hurt? And if yes, do they ever share about it? I have never had a man come to me saying his feelings were hurt&nbsp;by me or anyone else. Is this a female issue and are we REALLY just too sensitive? I am curious how you feel. Men (and women) please share your insight.

      Is it disrespectful to be late? Or just not show up? How were you raised? What is the deal with total lack of concern for others' time? I'm just curious what you think...leave your thoughts, please.
