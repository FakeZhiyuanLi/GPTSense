      About two weeks ago, on June 21, a phone call from my mom woke me up at around 7 in the morning.  Sounding very calm and composed, she told me that a sheriff and a handful of cops were downstairs, about to take away my car.  Trying to sound very cool myself, all I could say was “Ha? Anong nangyari??”    Ok, ok, sounds melodramatic right? The story of my car has so many twists and turns, sometimes it confuses even me.  My sister got it via car loan from her former employer (I will not name names lest I be sued for libel) about three or four years ago.  It’s a 1997 Toyota Camry, 2.2 liters, grey, automatic, leather seats, climate control, woodgrain paneling, the works.  At that time, I was driving a beat-up (my fault) 323 Mazda Familia, which had survived a major accident that almost sent it to car heaven.    On the latter part of 2002, my sister bought a van to keep up with her growing family.  Hence, the decision to hand me down the Camry, and I said goodbye to my Mazda forever.  Considering that my parents were paying a minimal amount and that it IS one hell of a car, I accepted it despite the fact that my sister had gotten embroiled in a legal battle against her employer, with the Camry right smack in the middle of it.  Counting on the merits of my sister’s case, I was thrilled at the prospect of having a luxury car which I could never afford to buy on my own.    For one and a half years, I cruised the streets of Manila in the Camry.  My boyfriend called it a “power car”, and rightfully so.  In it, going through potholes and humps felt like floating.  It hovered over the ground and was always, always stable – even at speeds over 100 kmh.  I would clean it myself (a stark contrast to earlier days when I would leave all “car business” to our maid or driver, all I did was drive).  I would sweat weekends giving it a carwash and rubbing off dirt from its leather seats.  But alas, my love affair with the Camry abruptly ended on that fateful day.     Going back to the phone conversation with my mom -- a few more reassuring words from her and my dad and it was over.  I was off to the garage.  It seems that my sister’s former bosses know how to spring a surprise – and they chose to do it in style, with cops and public officers crowding around our gates.  As if I’d attempt to do a Lara Croft or something, bring out the heavy guns, and shoot at everyone in sight just for a car.  Tsk, tsk, if only I could take a picture of all those cops and officers who went there undoubtedly without need of prodding, but with a few thousand pesos safely tucked in their wallets.   Greasing palms, after all, is nothing new and has proven to be the swiftest and most reliable way of harassment and intimidation.  That being said, I will not go into the sordid details of the case and will just keep my fingers crossed and hope that the judge sees through all the dirty tricks (let's pray that Your Honor has not become a part of the grand scam).  Oh well.  Ce la vie.  It broke my heart knowing that these strangers were driving away with my car, without me having the opportunity to properly say my farewells.  I was so stumped and dazed I just took a peek, had a quick breakfast, and went back to sleep.  A few hours later, I woke up, dressed for work, went to the garage and whispered to no one in particular “Jude, where’s my car?’”

      I wanted to write this piece for Father’s Day, but never found the opportunity to do so.  During that time, I was swamped with work – hard to believe since I work for a small firm with only three other lawyers.  Suffice to say that they are all partners and I am their only associate (a.k.a all-around slave :-)).    Anyway, before I digress, I wanted to write about my dad for father’s day.  He will be turning 61 this year (I think)...and after all these years, he is still a frustrated lawyer.  I remember when my eldest sister graduated from college with a degree in I.S.  My dad refused to even look at her diploma and insisted that she go to law school.  Actually no, he didn’t insist.  He demanded it from her.  And so, to get into my dad’s good graces, she did.  That was way back in 1991.  A few years later, as soon as my two other sisters graduated from college, he was at it again "Anak, you might want to take up law...” One flatly refused to do so, while the other took the entrance exam disinterestedly and never bothered to find out if she passed or not.  Fast forward 1999, and I had just graduated with a degree in Political Science.  Besides the usual congratulatory remarks, there was, as predicted, my dad’s usual spiel on the merits of becoming a member of the legal profession.  I must admit, I was not opposed to the idea, and in fact welcomed it.  On one hand, I wanted it for myself.  On the other hand, I also knew my dad wanted it for me.    My dad has been mistaken for a lawyer (this one sends him into fits of kilig), a congressman, even a general. Looking at him, one will find it hard to believe that he is in fact a farmer.  For more than thirty years, he has been tending to a farm, the fruits of which helped me and my four other siblings get the best education from the best schools in the country.  A self-made man.  Still, the dream of lawyering often lingers in his thoughts.  My mom once confessed to me that she is to blame for my dad’s aborted dream – she claims to have been blinded by jealousy and possessiveness during her younger years.  To this day, she curses the day she refused my dad’s wishes.  He would have been a brilliant lawyer – a litigator, with his booming voice and unmistakable presence.  Add this to the fact that he is an indefatigable reader and news addict.  He taught me to read the newspapers everyday, watch CNN regularly, and would often ask me about my opinions on current events just to make sure I am updated on everything.  He insists, too, that reading biographies of great leaders and icons will help me learn about living my life.  My dad also has his own set of law books.  He has a copy of the Philippine Constitution, the Civil Code, and if I’m not mistaken, all other major laws in the country.   A nightmare client, perhaps, for he would read every single pleading down to the minute details and question every single statement made.  It pleases him to have two daughters/lawyers at hand for all his legal queries, and whenever his interest is directed to some legal issue he does not hesitate to call.  He will call.  Everyday, long distance, just to ask me or my sister about it.  Sometimes, he would throw us a question and give us a few days to come up with an answer.  And when he does call back, he would already know the answer but ask us anyway, just to check if we’ve been doing our homework.  He may sound like a King Nagger (which he really is) but I actually find it sweet.  Having lived away from my parents since I was 11, the strongest connection I have with him right now is this.  Nothing compares to the pride in his eyes when he hears other people address me “attorney”, or the delight in his voice when he talks about the law.  People used to ask me “Did you really want to take up law?”  Back then, I would always hesitate and say, “Well, 50-50, it’s my dad’s decision as well as mine.”  If you ask me now, I would say yes without hesitation.  If only to live out my dad’s dream, I would.

      I am an average law student.  No awards, no special honors were bestowed on me when I graduated from law school on April of last year.  Nevertheless, I personally considered it an achievement to have marched down the aisles of Meralco Theatre together with my fellow survivors, knowing that we were officially one step away from being full-fledged A.T.T.Y.s. Nevertheless, on that stage, proudly brandishing my JD diploma, I had only one thing on my mind: the bar exams.    In my experience, I would say that taking the bar is akin to having your heart broken by a great love.  All those stages of “Anger,” “In Denial,” “Self-Pity” and finally “Acceptance.”    Anger, because of the incredulous task that lies ahead.  I remember looking at my books during the first week of my review and wondering, “how the hell am I supposed to cram into my head everything that I learned for four years in just four months???!”  These are not ordinary books, by the way.  These are large, heavy, thick and hardbound, with words and phrases that could test even the patience of a saint.   Not to mention the fact that every time you finish one, there always seems to be another and another and another…  In Denial – this comes when you feel like staying in bed the whole day, maybe watch some dvd’s, eat, tune in to Meteor Garden, or just hang out with a loved one, sharing your thoughts and dreams – in spite of the fact that September is fast approaching.  (Last year, my favorite commercial was the “Globe” commercial, a.k.a. “AYOKO NA MAG-LAW!!!!” – with matching teary eyes and dramatic throwing of books.  This, despite the fact that it is, really, too late in the day to realize that.)  And what of “Self-Pity”? I constantly found myself suffering from this during the whole review. Asking myself “WHY ME? WHY, WHY, WHY???!!!”  This feeling was compounded by the mercantile law controversy, which sparked intense emotions amongst my fellow reviewees and friends.  The thought of another Sunday was torturous at the least.  And when the re-take’s cancellation was finally announced the day after what was supposedly our last exam, we felt even more sorry for ourselves, having been deprived of the traditional “salubong” at Taft Avenue.       Acceptance.  I never really arrived at this stage, which means that up until the results came out, I was just one big nervous wreck.  While during the review, I found it hard to sleep at night with constant “I have to study some more” thoughts bugging me constantly—during the long wait for the results, these were replaced with “Did I answer number 1 correctly? Number 2, 3??? Oh no!!! What was the question again???!!!”  I call it “Bar Psychosis” – an offshoot of the enormous stress and anxiety that every single examinee goes through for four months of studying, taking the exams for four Sundays of one whole month, and waiting for the results for another six.   Worse, the Bar Exam is probably the most hyped up and publicized among all licensure exams in this country.  I have it on good authority that results in other countries are mailed individually, and never publicized and celebrated by the media.  Really, it should not be such a big deal!  This way, examinees can actually be relieved of loads of additional pressure.   After all, a number of famous people, even the best, have taken the road to “take two.”  Claro M. Recto, for one.   And in foreign shores, the late JFK, Jr. (“take three” in his case), Hillary Clinton, Gerry Spence.  I could go on and on.  I am one of the lucky ones who made it on my first try, but I do not see the reason why others should be crucified for making it on their second, third, fourth, nth tries.  A friend once told me that the Bar is a personal journey and success is not measured just by the results but by what values you've learned and what memories you've gathered.  Indeed, I can honestly say that it was one of the biggest challenges I've ever had to overcome in my life, what with all the highs and lows.  To say it was difficult would be an understatement.  Grueling, perhaps, would be a much better term. I remember having read tons of “bar preparation” materials back then.  I remember all those pointers about number of readings, what books to use, the struggles I was about to face, etc.  But all of this notwithstanding, I will never forget the memorable experiences that no handout or manual prepared me for  -- from scouring the city for 24-hour cafes, to indulging in last-minute "in denial" drinking sprees and feeling guilty immediately thereafter, to waking up in the middle of the night with my face plastered on a book, to praying to every Saint I know, and finally, to steadying my trembling hands moments before an exam and looking at everyone else in the room, knowing I am not alone in my fear.
