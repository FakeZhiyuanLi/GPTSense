      Okay... let me clear... If Tim Henmen does not play as well as his opponent, his play is bad and he thus deserves to lose... quite regardless of the fact that he is British. Some mad lunnos seem to think that he should win regardless of how bad he plays, this is utterly objectionable and rubbish. To all such people, stop watching Wimbledom and get a life!

      As everybody in the whole world knows, we lost Euro 2004. It's painful to say we as it wasn't me, it was a bunch of people who happen by some fluke of chance to have been born in the same country as me led by the husband of a failed pop star. Harsh but true.  And we all know what the international symbol for bad drivers is: Red cross on a white flag.  The england vs Portugal match was not the first time we lost against a host country's team: the only other times we played against host teams in the history of the european championships(ironic name!) was in 1980 against Italy and 1992 against Sweden. Both we lost.   So in the World Cup 2006, english people, one and all, support a good team!

      This is a really long post or at least it will be when I have finished typing it. What can I say here to fill up this space? Any ideas? Thought not. Well I'll just have to keep on rambling or repeating myself.This is a really long post or at least it will be when I have finished typing it. What can I say here to fill up this space? Any ideas?

Any ideas? Thought not. Well I'll just have to keep on rambling or repeating myself. See I repeated myself or rather copy and pasted myself. Why do we talk about repeating ourselves? Instead of repeating what we say. That's english for you: irregular, stupid and in need of a good old smack. But who's there to give it one? Now the french, they know how to discipline their langauge.

      When I came back from the pharmacy, I had a sealed package containing no less than 7 boxes. It's like christmas. And only one of them contains pills. What for? As if I'm going to say that.

      that my views in this blog are "homosexual". Well, this from the guy who thinks the use of allcaps will make him better in bed. Go figure!  What he means is my views are "gay" which means he doesn't like them... but that is the point. An express purpose of this blog is to annoy those who think James Bond is cool and that support any kind of team or other person who happens to think he is good at sports : hint hint Tim.

      ... This is mainly because Jack somehow managed to place his country's interests over his own. Some form of martyrdome. Mainly because his wife died(no sympathy please: he is nothing more than a construct in our minds: if you dare say he's more, get a life!)   I think James Bond married someone in one movie and then she was killed later. But knowing Bond he probably went on some sort of revenge trip(yeah, that's what he was up to in Die Another Day, for the unlearned out there.)  But Jack and James... They BOTH fight terrorists The terrorists they fought were in BOTH cases riddiculous charactatures... James fought media and oil tycoons mostly, Jack seems to go after terrorists who are incredibly organised, civilised(well that word's just there for effect) and in other ways not Osama Bin Ladenish (who apparently has a  urlLink sister in law . If it was some other celebrity, such an interview would seem ridiculous and petty but in this case...) They BOTH are highly moment in history specific... James Bond appeals to Cold Warian times, Jack is most definitely post-Stalin, post-Hitler, post-Cold war and post-911 which seems to work for us now for some reason  In any case, 24 rocks!

      Maybe it's some kind of rite of passage but navigating a supermarket for the first time sure isn't easy. No, I revise that it's sheer hell(metaphorically at least). I mean where does one find custard powder? Or stuffing? I mean there are many easy things: vegetables(if you know what the particular one looks like), drinks(I mean who misses hundreds of bottles?). But past that things get a little harder. And what shopping list doesn't have a few obscure items. I'm relatively okay: I don't mind asking customer services to label my list with isles or asking a question(to multiple assistants if needed to find a precise location). Then you have the nightmare of packing bags. Even a basket full takes more than one bag and this takes time: and even if the till assistant helps you(such as at ASDA(sometimes, if you're lucky)) that still stops them from serving other customers. One man's customer service is another man's customer disservice. In the event, I survived as ASDA had a cafe where I could sit down and pack my bag properly and take the crumpled fivers back out of my unzipped trousers pockets to disposite them somewhere safe.  A few practical suggestions: 1. An Index of items needed to be created 2. Stop moving around items! 3. Online supermarket shopping would work&nbsp;IF the customer was contacted if some item could not be found instead of the customer getting some substandard crap alternative.

      They are so wrong. For some reason, blogger wants me to manually type in the time I want them to show up as posted, instead of manually changing it occasionally to lie about when something was posted. Wrong way round. Also how so unblog is it to falsify a time??  - this was posted 3 minutes after displayed date

      Give Blood. I think I will soon.  Alternatively or in addition, view  urlLink this page  at the  urlLink National Blood service for amazing facts like this one: "Duelling is legal in Paraguay if both parties are registered blood donors." Quite a cool site in general... worth a browse.

      My advice to football fans in concerning the next worldcup: Support the team you believe will win based on sound level-headed analysis, not nessisarily England.  Some would say this is unpatriotic. It is not. I believe in the happiness of my country's people and I believe people would be happier if they devote their energy of supporting into the team that wins. See I'm patriotic.  The strange paradox is this: I'm being patriotic by encouraging people to be unpatriotic. Hehe.

      Generation sex respects the rights of girls Who want to take their clothes off As long as we can all watch that's OK  And generation sex elects the type of guys You wouldn't leave your kids with And shouts "off with their heads" if they get laid  Lovers watch their backs as hacks in macs Take snaps through telephoto lenses Chase Mercedes Benz'es through the night  A mourning nation weeps and wails But keeps the sales of evil tabloids healthy The poor protect the wealthy in this world  Generation sex injects the sperm of worms Into the eggs of field mice So you can look real nice for the boys  And generation sex is me and you And we should really all know better It doesn't really matter what you say  by The Divine Comedy  So... apparently that means the song agrees with me and apparently they make the point better. It is quite obviously a "satirical song", as my friend says, but I'll have to read it a few more times before I fully appreciate it. Furthermore, dpen2000 humbles appolgises for the assumptions of the previous post. (They were great points, though, eh?)   Oh yeah, for those, like me, who have never heard this strange phrase(it still is) before, Google has 8,740 references to it. Where on earth were we? ;-) Here's a  urlLink tiny  for them:  urlLink http://tinyurl.com/64cb7 .

      This is highly theoretical: 1. Fill a glass tank with water. 2. pour sand from hand into water. 3. wait until it is sufficiently diffused (Or is sand too heavy?) 4. Take digi-pics from hundreds of angles simultaneously 5. Reconstruct tank on computer in 3d(make a programme to do this) 6. Let computer count the uncountable  Any body else got any solutions on how to do this?

      "Generation Sex, respects, the rights of girls who wanna take their clothes off...as long as we can all watch, thats OK!"  Apparently there is a great subtly to this line but I don't know it yet. Enlighten me please! (This quote is also very sexist: generation implies both men and women in an certain age bracket: this quote assumes that GS is made up of only men.) In the meantime, let's just take on this ridiculous "Generation Sex" concept. Firstly, sex was enjoyed by every generation and the people of the 70s were probably more obsessed than most. (A close reading of Song of Solomon, the bible's very own erotic poem, reveals even in bible times breast size was a concern as it is today. Though, thankfully, they didn't have Page 3.) Secondly, it's unfair to Christians, young priests-in-training, people in comas and many other sensible souls to suggest that we are all obsessed with sex and proud of it.
