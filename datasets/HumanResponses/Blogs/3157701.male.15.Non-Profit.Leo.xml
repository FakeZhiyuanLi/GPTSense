      I can kickflip a deck now. Something new. I've been on my board for 7 days now. I have most of my tricks back, except double kickflip and double heelflip. They need some work. My flips are ripping my shoes to crap. They're leather too. I swear, if I wreck these shoes, I will be very very upset. My tank is on empty. I am not a happy person right now. One of these days, someone will push me just a little far and I'll smoke 'em, then walk away and feel nothing. I get really messed up in the heat too..cripes

       2 windows broken.. oh well. Shit happens.  I tremble alot. Maybe from being nervous. Maybe from fear. I don't know. It dosn't matter now. It didn't matter before. My heart was pumping so hard.. heh. I'm not going back to ordinary life this time. I won't pretend everything is ok. Not this time. Too far..

      TORONTO Toronto owned Ottawa last night. I thought it was going to be a close game because Sundin was still out but I was very wrong. I called 6-2 for Toronto, just for the hell of it. It turned out to be 4-1. After Toronto scored 3 goals on 12 shots, I knew it was over, before the game was even into the second period. Oh my.. it's good to be a Toronto fan. Toronto eliminated Ottawa in the playoffs 4 times in a row now. That's sweet music to my ears. Belfour was sensational. He is currently the best goalie out there =O!!

      Today is a good old Monday. Man it sucked. First of all, it was really warm in the morning. So I didn't bring a coat, just my sweater. Halfway to school I figured I should've worn shorts and a T-shirt. It seemed freakishly warm and windy. We went out to the store again today at noon, this time everyone came. Then, right in the middle of last class, it started raining. I was soaked when I got home. Stupid crappy weather. I'm also a little glad though.  I should have approximately 15 days left until my leg is good to use. 2 weeks. It's so close, but so far. I'm going insane..

      Today was pretty crappy. Marc is over right now, that's alright. Ashely got back, and it sounds like she had fun, although there were some bad parts. Nat had asked if I wanted to go to a movie, and it all sounded good untill she cancelled. She's upset about something, hopefully it's not too bad. I have to stop by Orbit sometime and ask them to order some Lakai's, even though I just bought a pair of shoes for $160, these Koston's better last me a looooong time. Very uneventful day for me.

      It's Saturday, 1:00am right now.. so yesterday (Friday) wasn't too bad I guess. Careers was a pain. The teacher really knows how to piss me off. Computer class wasn't so bad, Chris and I were screwing around with Logan alot. At lunch, Phu and Alex went to skate so Chris, Kyle, Logan, myself and Nathan were all together. Wierd having Nathan around. Anyways, we went to the convinience store at lunch and oddly enough, Logan bought us some stuff. Must of been because we were all saying how he would ditch us to save himself anyday. I guess everybody has plans but me. Well, I did go see a movie with Shannon and Lesley, and I saw Phu there, he told me about a certain transaction with a certain someone. Ashley is busy for the weekend, I can't skate so there's not much could do with Phu or Kyle (is he even in town?). No idea what Halie is doing. I'm not going to hang out with Meagan or Amanda. Meagan isn't so bad, she's pretty cool, but she's always with Amanda, so no. I should be going back to the hospital sometime soon, I'd say within the next 5 days. That will mark the halfway point of my healing. Oh joy. only 3 weeks to go. I've seen people with sprained ankles heal faster. Then again, a fracture is much worse. I'm so tempted to go skate, but I know if I try even the smallest trick, I'll just reinjure myself and spend another 80 days doing nothing.

      Correction: don't expect to see much of me at all. The earliest I can go back to school is Wednesday. Until then all I can do is sit around and suffer. Oh trust me, it's bad. I was wishing I was dead a few times now. I lost track of time, I think today is Friday, I haven't been at school even once this week.  What timing. Now I have to miss the wedding. Geeze. I was looking forward to it. When I DO get sick, it's always something big. No flu or anything with me. It's more like shingles and crap like that. I always suffer so bad. I'd much rather those mediocre sicknesses *tear*  It's like I vanished off the face of the Earth.

      We played a 4 way game of PIG Sunday at Heritage. I even went last, and I still won. When it was over, I had no letters. Flawless lol. Oh it's good to be #1.  I'm very sick right now. Man it sucks. It's like pain 24/7. Sore throat, hurts so bad. I'd rather have the flu right now. At least then I'd be able to rest. No school today. Not like I wanted to go anyways. I'll be going to the clinic later. Don't expect to see much of me today. I'll be suffering somewhere. peace out

      Wellllllllllllllllll Nat is finally back!! woo 'bout time too, it's great having her around again. 3 weeks without seeing and 2 without talking. Cripes lol. Went to Heritage today, got Kyle and Phu to come with me. That was fun until it started to rain pretty bad, then we all went home. I got home, Kyle stayed for 5 minutes or so, then left. I went to my batcave and stayed there 'till now. Going out to do something every now and then. Like laundry, at 12:30pm and shower at 12:45pm. Sometimes I amaze myself. I can do that retarded primo stuff now. Something so simple, I know grade 6's that can do it, and I just learnt this afternoon. One word "wow -_-".   I might actually be sick. Pooey. I haven't been sick since last year, I think. Now, my throat is all swollen, and Ashely has the exact same thing. Can you make the connection? I can't. Anything else notable.. Ashley might come over tomorrow, to meet my mom for the first time. 2 months, and she's only going to meet her tomorrow (possibly). Hmm.. =O! 2 months, awesome. We're great.

      Let me pull some thoughts from this gray matter of mine...  Nothing. I almost drank liquid Old Spice. I had water and deodorant beside eachother and I wasn't looking and grabbed the spray on accident and brought it to my mouth and almost sparyed it. Thankfully some brain cells kicked in just then. Wasn't that fun, and totally worth your time. (I want my money back)

      I went to the doctor today, no swimming. Ashley is still very sick. I hope she gets better.  I can't play hockey tomorrow because I'll be going with my mom and stuff. We have Monday off. I don't have anything planned for the weekend. Stuff pops up every now and then though. I'm thinking about pulling a few all-nighters. Opportunities like this 3day weekend don't surface too often. Being distracted, I have to go yeah..

      My mom, myself, my brother and Roger all went out today. Just to get away, I guess. We went to Long Sault at first, to the islands and stuff down there. We had found this one place before, so we went to it again. We stayed for a while but it was too cold to swim so we went and got supper, then went to the Quarry. The water was nicer there but seemed colder now then that last time I swam there (about 2 weeks before). I eventually got in and swam around. It was so cold that it made your head feel like it was getting crushed, like a severe headache. So I swam for a while but it wasn't worth it anymore so I got out. (Hey! at least I didn't hit any hidden rocks this time) The GV thing was cool, it ended up being only me, and then Ashley's mom decided to go with me so I wouldn't be alone lol. I saw so many people that I know...cripes, that's freaky. I'm not sure if anyone recognized me, I don't really care either.  Now, should I go swim tomorrow? hmm It would be indoors, but I don't quite like indoor pools because of the chlorine. I also have a doctors appointment..

      I felt pretty bad this morning so my mom told me to stay home. I took some Tylenol 3's and then went back to sleep around 9:00am. I woke up around noon and I felt better. It was raining pretty hard today at some points. It was great.  I'm going to a Spring Concert thing, to see Ashley play in the band. Sad part is, this will be my first time inside GV. I think I'll go swimming with Sam on Thursday. We might have to play hockey on Friday because Sat & Sun don't look good. I really don't know if I can make it on Friday though. Geeze, I miss too much. It seems like each week we get new people. This week might be Ashley and Jessica. First girls to play with us (besides Nick). We might get Corey too, if we grow desperate enough. We could also get Logan. I guess anyone is welcome. Hell, we might even get Shea.

      Does anybody know the secret? Or the combination to this life, and where they keep it? Moving along.  Nothing much to report today. Well, I would get my ass kicked by Ashley, Chris, Phu, Kyle and Blake (5) if I move away. Honestly lol 'if you move we'll kill you!'. Geeze, great friends there haha. My mom has been checking out houses and taking down numbers for a while now. It's got me thinking. Most of the houses are just outside of town. Far enough. I haven't given it serious thought but just off the top of my head, it's like 50/50. It would be nice to move because I've lived in this house for 7 years and it's a bad neighbourhood. But then.. there's friends, and then Ashley (gf). I don't know, I've had a long distance relationship before and it's not easy. I don't exactly see much of Ashley as it is.  *my Koston's are STILL getting shredded*

      School was okay, well, as good as it gets. Let's see.. most classes were easy, we didn't do much. Steve came over after school and wanted to see if I wanted to go skate but I said no, just not up to it today.  I went to a dance at Heritage. I went with Sam, Lauren, Jessica and I don't know who the others were. I thought "hey, wait, I hate dances & dancing" but it was too late by then. I was supposed to get there at 6:30 but I thought "naw" because I have a thing with being 'fashionably' late. I'm always the last to arrive, for some reason. Anyways, I get there and they go 'when we get in, just say you're in grade 8, because it's a 7 & 8 dance'. I was like 'wth? oh, wonderful'. I'm only 8 inches taller than half the people in there. My night consisted of standing around alot, I did kinda dance at some points. Then, I slow danced a few times, since that's as easy as dancing gets.  I suppose it was okay, I'm glad I went. I doubt I'll go to any other dances though, unless I have to. Oh yeah.. lol, the wedding too.

      I went out to the college today with my skateboard, planning to ollie one of the barrier things. They're identicle to the one at the skate park and they are equal to 3 decks. There's like 100 all around the school too so it's perfect. Anywho, I talked to Ashley about it and she got a little upset and my consience got the best of me so I ended up not trying it (I'm a good boy =O). I wore my éS' and when I got there I thought "darn, shoulda wore my DC's". WHY? Because my damn éS are getting scratched to hell already (same thing happened to my DC's). They are some of the best skate shoes money can buy right now. So I figured 'hey, I desperately need to find a more efficient way for flip tricks'. And then, with my expertise (w00t) I found another way. I'll explain it, even though nobody cares. Before: I would slide my foot up as I was going up and flip it then land, scratching the toe cap to hell  Now: I ollie up, as high as I want (better height than before) and then when I'm at or near my highest point I push down and flip it instead of sliding my foot off the edge and flipping it. It didn't work so well the first while but now I'm getting the hang of it, I'm flipping higher and landing more than before. Best of all, I don't think my shoes get messed up.

      Let's see... ah yes, my right let hurts. It feels as if it never fully recovered. Stupid doctor, 10 years of school and all he can tell me is "just stay off it, and when it feels right, go ahead and play again". That bastard. The last time I went into surgery wasn't a very pretty sight, but now I don't care. Anything to get better fast. From now on, I'm going to stretch P-Rod (Paul Rodriguez) style before I go out and skate. I have about $65 cash and another $10 if I need it. That's $75. What can I do with that much? Nothing!  Oh yeah, I got asked to a dance by Sam. Hmmm.. She knows I have a gf, I told her. I'll talk to Ash anyways, to see what she thinks. No big deal though. She's cool. She says my friends are a little wierd =( haha.  Next up, varial heelflip. I also have to figure out what a Tre Flip is.. There's so much to do, I don't even remember.

      I stayed up 'till about 3:00am then left Ashley to go to bed. I woke up around 10:30am and I was talking to her, I found out that she hadn't slept at all. Madness.  I went out to l'Heritage to skate today. It was really hot, the ground is perfect and there was nobody there. I pulled off some flips up and down the curbs. There is one gap.. you go down a long pathway and then then at the end, there's a curb you have to jump off, and then about 4 inches and there's a sewer. The gap is about 4 feet and you have to get good speed. I haven't done this one since last spring. So first try, I'm going pretty fast and then I ollie but I lost it completely. The board flew away and I was in mid air over the stupid sewer. I was worried I'd land bad and twist my ankle, or soemthing worse. I was shaking after that. My heart was pumping really bad too. I hurt my ankle, I think it's bruised, but I'll be fine.

      Did you know I have an evil monkey in my closet? Well, techincally, I don't even have a closet. But if I did, there'd be an evil monkey in it I tells ya.  On to business. I might buy a board and wheels off Corey. The deal is this, I have $40 cash right now, and that's all I can offer. So it's basically we do business, or I'll go elsewhere. Yep, dog eat dog world.  The kittens are really cool but geeze they won't shut up. They're only 5 days old.. but.. oh well. And Kyle (if you read this) it's $30 a kitten man. Start saving mwhaahaaa [special price for you] Stupid Canada day. By 'stupid' I mean fun, of course.

      Cat had kittens. big whoop. Person from CAS is coming tomorrow.. hah, I just might have a talk with her after all.  Remember when I said "give me 3-4 weeks and I'll get a fs flip," ? Wellll... suprise suprise *I heart suprises* I landed 3 frontside flips yesterday. Yes, three. I also landed two backside flips. All this and I can't even 360 flip yet. Well I think I made a mistake, I think it's the 360 flip that will take 3-4 weeks. It's about time too, I hadn't leart a new trick in a while. My old bag of tricks was getting tiresome. Now I have new shtuff to pull out and suprise peeps. My next tricks to learn will be  1. 360 Flip 2. Hardflip* 3. Varial Heelflip  *(FS Flip and Hardflip are very simmilar. The only difference is with FS Flip you do a 180 kickflip with a body varial. With hardflip you do a 180 kickflip without the body varial. The board spins the exact same way for both tricks so if you can FS Flip, you are well on your way to Hardflip)

      I bet you are all thinking "Justin's back. Shit". Well that's right, I'm back, and feeling shitté. Kyle and I planned to sleep over at Phu's and then go to the skate competition on Saturday. Well Phu and I went to Orbit but those decks sell fast so I didn't get one. Then we went to his house and met Kyle. So it was Phu, Kyle, Quy and myself because Woman was gone to Wonderland. That very day, Phu's mom tells them they have to go to Montreal to say goodbye to their cousin who seems to be leaving the country. I don't think either of them were very happy. So Kyle and I were thinking "damn, what now? do we go home?". So Phu said he wasn't to sure, and was all bummed. Then Kyle said he would wait all night, he didn't care, he didn't have anything better to do.  "BUT JUSTIN, WHAT WOULD YOU DO LOL?". Well it turns out we loitered for 8-9 hours straight. We went to my house and tried my rail. We went to Kyle and got his.. 'stuff' and then we went to the mall and were assholes there for about 3 hours. Then stopped at the General Hospital and tried that big.. platform thing. I think that's where I busted my hip because it's really sore =(. We stopped and my place again and were off to loiter some more. We pretty much skated around Tim's, Galaxy, were ever else. Long story short, we were killing time until about 12:15am. That when we ran into Phu. He took us in ^.^ and we did whatever, stayed up all night, went to the competition. We knew we'd all be wrecked, but we did it anyways. This was my second Comp. Not bad, it was nice. But it got so much more people when it was at the Civic Complex. I think the nicest tricks were the Hardflip Mute Grab over that kicker thing, and then the 360flip off the platform. There was some nice stuff though. Sam and Jessica showed up, that was cool. Then Ashley, Kibbee and Jess Sauve showed up. Ashley creeped me out with her naval ring. Bleh.  It rained so we couldn't skate.. not like we had the strength. We ended up sleeping at Phu's again and then went home in the morning, only to sleep some more. I woke up about 60 minutes ago, and now I'm going to attempt sleep again.     odd how people shake  **QUOTE OF THE DAY** "He pushes mongo, now I won't clap," -Kyle

      I don't think I'm the only one that feels this way.. but summer itsn't so great so far. Some cool things, but it's mostly been downhill for me. Like, really really downhill, madness.  On a lighter note, Julie and I are talking again after mysteriously just not saying anything for about a month. It's great, I had forgot how well we get along. Lesley (Icaldwell) and I are doing just fine now also. Jessica and I had a good chat lol, that's cool. Everything else is just peachy. Not really, but I can pretend.  I'm getting a new deck tomorrow! Wait, it's 1:21AM, so, I'm getting a new deck later today!! I'm going to sleep at Phu's then on Saturday we'll go to the skatepark. I'll try to remember to bring the digital camera too!

      The Lakai pro team is doing a tour of Eastern Canada and I think I'll go see the demo in Ottawa. There will be Mike Carroll, Rick Howard, Anthony Pappalardo, Jeff Lenoce and Danny Garcia. My first pro demo.. I wonder if I'll get free stuff.  I'm going camping on Tuesday, I think, if anyone wants to come, just ask me.  Skate Wars on Saturday, with the guys. People are welcome to that too. I sure hope I can get a new deck before then.  That's about all I guess. Shitty day.

      Wellllll I woke up a little after 1:00pm today, and I only went to bed at 2:00am last-..yesterday? I don't know. Anywho..  I went out just now (about 9:15pm) and said to myself "I'm going to learn how to FS Flip" and so I went and experimented with my Koston's and got some ideas but never did pull off the FS Flip. Then I tried 360 Flips for fun, and what's funny is I can fully rotate and flip it now and plant one foot down on it. I come really close and thought I could land it tonight but it was getting really dark and I was exhausted. I will land it very soon, I'm sure of it (btw, that kicks ass). I'm confident that I'll get the hang of FS Flip in about 3-4 weeks which is about the time I'll have enough dough to buy my OWN deck. I think 360 Flip will be good in less than 2 weeks, so long as the board doesn't snap on me.  Oh yeah, I went to Quebec and stuff. And we didn't have enough time tonight so next time (soon) we'll be going to Riviere Rouge for the day.  aurevoirs, mes amis

      DO YOU KNOW WHAT TODAY IS PEOPLE?!? (yes, it is the first Day of Summer) YéS! It's GSD!!! Highlights are: Kyle and I went into St.Lawrence to get Quy, and were total jerks while we were there. Always healthy.  I ollied a four set at the Civic, which I never even knew existed. That was a rush. I ollie-manualed the entire thing outside Macs' Milk. That was sweet ass. We went to the Bandshell and some guys there asked if I wanted to play PIG so I said sure. The first game was me and 2 guys I don't know, it a dragging on and I ended up dropping out first. The second game was me, Kyle, and the 3 random guys. So 5 of us. I went second. I pulled a double kickflip out of my sweet bag of tricks and at that very instant knew that everybody had a letter, because they suck and nobody else landed it. Kyle and the 2 guys I played before got knocked off next, and so it was just me and the third 'nobody'. He had 'PI' and I had 'P'. I pulled a nice heelflip and his friends said he was screwed so I was guessing he has big problems with heelflips. Well, that asshole pulled it off. The game went on, just him and I, doing whatever for at least 20 minutes. Then I managed to F up hardcore, because in the end I had 'PIG' and he had 'PI'. Ugh.. how could I screw up twice with such a lead? I blow ass. I heard his friends keep saying "come on [whoever], you can't let this guy beat us". I've done some limited thinking and have some reasons why I couldn't do my best. 1. I had just finished jumping the steps with the Hawks, which hurt because they blow. (tear tear, yeah yeah) 2. My deck is snapped so I've been using other peoples decks for a while now. 3. I had my Grind Kings, not my sexy Tensors. 4. It's freaking GSD, I had previously been all around town, and skated my ass off before that.   Does this effect the outcome of the games, and my performance? Yes, I think it does. But oh well, right? *rolls eyes* The point of this day was to have fun. I did have fun, but geeze I'm pissed at myself for losing. Damn it.  Meh. I have alot to learn still.  Later peons. Happy grad Nathalie. **QUOTE OF THE DAY** "Oh, I thought you guys were saying 'black guy' " - Kyle, about Phu and I saying Lakai alot. Lakai bro's w00t!

      Not an eventful day. Nothing much.. I sat out by the water for a few hours, it was cool because the wind was crazy. I read, I slept, lost my temper. Found out some cool (by cool I mean..crazy? I guess) things from my mom. Kyle has ditched us once again. Thumbs up to KayL everyone!! Nat just might have a messed up knee. You have to be carefull with the knee's, a little mess up and you could easily be out for a year. Wow, marc appleyard is 17. I never knew that

      Here is my day> The exam sucked and pissed everyone off. There were questions like "Name 5 types of occupational groups on the NOC list," yeah, wait a minute, what the hell is the NOC list? A thanks goes out to Ms.Curran for putting random junk on the exam.  What else? We pretty much skated all day, Phu, myself, Kyle and Alex. Alex sucks but oh well. I don't really mind hanging out with him. We hung out at a protest, where Elaine McDonald, my english and art teacher, told us we could skate, to put on a show. (She's running for the NDP, maybe you've heard of her) I was thinking "sweet deal" and to add the the fun, we got some free ice cream out of it. (PS some rippin' pins, vote Elaine) {yeah, I'll do that..} Oh, and before I forget, to top it off, my board snapped. %$#@. I'm really pissed/bummed about that. Pussy Kyle went home earlier than planned so I took his board and the 3 of us hung out at the mall then crossed town to see Quy getting out of school, so we could poke fun. They were outside for gym, I would've waited for Nat but we were on a tight schedule (sorry!). We went down to St.Peters Church (I think it's called that..) and chillaxed/skated for a bit. Then I came home and here I am.. it's a Friday night alone.  **QUOTE OF THE DAY** "Oh shit no. F***." -me, after breaking my deck *shame*

      Highlight of yesterday- Phu, Steve and myself went to Heritage. They actually still had school so everyone went to class after a while. Then this class came by and these girls were watching us, so I blew some kisses and they blew some back *awww so cute!*. Not much happened there, except we got a good look as some posers. Remember kids, posers come in all shapes and sizes. Long story short, the principal came out and told us to leave so we did. Walking through the college parkinglot, Steve got really low on his board and did a kickflip and it poped up and hit him right between the eyes. He was bleeding like crazy so we washed him up at my house then walked him home. Turns out he got 4 stitches from that ordeal. -  As for today, nothing much. Checking about the camera to do some filming and we got a bunch of new living room crap. I'd be happy, or at least smile. But no. Been crappy for a while. Lieghter fools. (You know és footwear? It is pronounced "ess" like the letter "S". Althought the majority of people call it "E-S". I knew that before and I told people but I wasn't certain so I pronounced like all the cool kids do =(. Anyways, I'm right.) http://esfootwear.com/etc/faq/  **QUOTE OF THE DAY** "non non, n'est pas des boys" -someone at the school

      Let me recap. I went and met Nat at school then dropped our stuff off at her house and went on our way to the Square. Ohhh it was hot, tiring and I'm still sore. But we talked and like having conversations with her. Got the glasses, came back, did some work, watched a movie and then more work. Overall I give it 2 thumbs up. (she came close to falling asleep on my though -_-)  Business exam was easy but lengthy. I think I'll do really good, I pretty much knew it all and I studied hard. You can call me the anti-fail. We (by we, I mean everyone BUT me) moved everything out of the living room last night because we're supposed to get a living room set today or tomorrow morning. My mom keeps saying things like "oh it's so nice!!" and "aww you just have to see it!". In due time, mother..  Today, I have alot of reading and writing planned, for myself ^_^.  **QUOTE OF THE DAY**     Me: "Well, we already know he's going to fail". (about Kyle and math class)

      “If it wasn’t for Rodney, none of you would be doing 360 flips right now,”  Chad Fernandez - Globe  The short exam days have strated. Give me much more time to get things done. I'm going to hang out with Nathalie for the rest of the day today. That's really cool. Tomorrow, I'm not sure, but I'm thinking about going stakeboarding with some peeps. That will be fun. We need to gather some skateable stuff, where ever possible. I have some ideas, and I'll see what everyone else can come up with. It's about 12:30pm right now, so not much has happened. I might update later tonight, or tomorrow.   **QUOTE OF THE DAY**      Matt.S: "I got new pens and you got new shoes, maybe they're good luck, for the exam,"

      I'll keep you awake tonight. And I'll hurt until sunrise, in this attempt to displace this pulsing attack on my senses. Because I'm not sure I can go on! Now drag me down, into your world.  More about last night.. I jumped the steps at the library, I jumped off the bandshell and I kickfliped off the 2 set at the school. I had a great night. I was all pumped up and everything. It was great. Well, besides the hand thing, that hurt. *tear*  On to today. No camera, but I will try to get it for next weekend, beforehand. I don't know who will come along this time, and who knows, I might not have a camera either. NOW back to today! It was Nat, Quy, Phu and myself for most of the day at Heritage because a certain someone can't wait 45 minutes, but can be late by 3 hours. Anyhow, moving right along. Umm.. I was pretty sore and all. I think Phu was too. Neither of us really did much.  It was cool that Nat came with us. We all ended up going to get Kyle, which was pointless because we didn't skate, everyone just went home. Well, Nat got a milkshake thing out of it from her sister lol.

      First thing I think of when typing this is 'does anyone even read this?'. I really don't think so. 40 hours of my life down the drain but hey, that's alright.  Item #2 on the list. My shoes are sweet. I love them. I'm a bit of a shoe fanatic, you see, I have 5 pairs. All skater shoes too. I love these Lakai. Phu's are awesome too. Sweetness describes it well. We're like Lakai Twins now, with our board graphics and shoes. I think we have a new place to buy our shÿt now. I got the Soca model and Phu got Carrol 3 (Girl limited edition).   People mostly said "nice shoes", "those are really nice" and "how much were they?". Then comments came like, "holy crap, you wear a different pair everyday" and "you bought another pair of shoes?!". Vans, DC, éS, Hawks and Lakai. So what if I have 5 pairs. So what I have have more shoes than most girls I know (actualy, every girl I know). Meh it doesn't matter. I rock, and will continue to buy shoes. Next comes a board though. I almost snapped mine today pulling some big stuff.-_-

      Top 5 Pro's with Justin 1. Eric Koston 2. Rodney Mullen 3. Geoff Rowley 4. Mike Carrol 5. Cairo Foster Welcome to the Tap boys (wth?) Dear Diary, lolZ  Well I went to Top Of The World in Ottawa, and Phu asked if he could mooch a ride so we brought him along. I was going for Lakai, he was going for Fallen. But in the end he also got Lakai. w00t I love my new shoes, they rock. Came with alot of stuff too, it's awesome. Phu and I are the only ones in town I know of that actively skate, with lakai's. Pretty sweet.  I'm still seeing about the video camera, I'll know about 60 minutes from now. Today it will be Phu, Kyle and myself. Tomorrow will be Phu, Kyle, myself, Nat, and I guess kyle has to bring his cousin Brittany =(. Well, Nat said she would film, assuming we get a camera, which is a sweet deal. And Sunday it will be just Phu and I. Maybe Nathalie, I'm not too sure. Today was really cool. and yeah.. I'll update latter.

      I stayed home today for reasons unknown* Ashley and I are supposed to make green shoes in the summer w00t I'm going to wear them too. I asked if she would walk around with me but she said no way *cries* MEAN! lol  I'm going to Top Of The World on Thursday w00tx2. I went out skating just for a bit. I think I finally know how to kickflip WITHOUT shredding my shoes or laces, but I'm not too sure. Oh yeah, I can nollie shovit now and I land most of the time. I come pretty close to nollie 360 shovit too. I'll get it soon.   Also, I think I have my heelflips back. I can do them nice and high now but I have to work on landing. Another big thing, I can manual and then kickflip out. I landed like 2 out of 10 but I'm getting better. That's pretty crazy, all this stuff I did today, in less than 2 hours. [my uncle said 'do a double kickflip' so I did, and landed for like 2 seconds but then I fell lol oh yeah, it hurt, I landed awkward]  "I'm not f*cking doing that again. That was sketchy" -Geoff Rowley [really sorry]

      Today I went to Ottawa, to West 49 to pick up some Lakai shoes but noooo the have to carry other shit brand shoes instead. But Lakai is a very rare shoe, not easy to get. So my mom has this friend, and her boyfriend is a skater. He skates like 4 hours a day, everyday and he goes to the skate shops in Ottawa alot. So I talked to him and he gave me the names of some places and said they just might carry Lakai. I tried Top Of The World first, and I got lucky. They carry 'em. So, I might give them a call, and then we'll definately go down and pick up a pair. And if they carry Fallen, then I'll see if Phu can come along, so he can buy his pair.   We also played hockey tonight. Our new player of the week was Lis Fraiser. We had alot of people say 'maybe' and not one of them showed up. So it's all out revenge, seeing as there's one real week of school left. Maybe I can try skating in the halls now...  I have a video camera idea going around, to film some skating and some general screwing around.. but don't get your hopes up, no promises.

      Skated again today. I thought I was going to go with Ashley and Erika today but I have no idea what happened. Something got changed, I don't know, I guess they decided to go without me. ahh, I'm a sad panda =( *cries* So instead I decided to stop lazing around waiting for something to come along and went out. I went and met up with Phu, then we went across town to Central where we met Chris. The 3 of us went to visit Kyle at his hardcore yard sale =). That was funny, then the 3 of us went around to stores and malls and crap, then went and got Kyle around 4:10. It was then me, Phu and Kyle. We went way back down to Phu's, got Quy, then way down to Heritage.  We skated for a while and had some good laughs because Kyle had 3 wicked bad falls in a row. His skating was comparable to a sack of shit. I brought the garbage can over and was jumping it, then, on like.. the 10th try, I wiped out bad, and rolled and shit, and I had no shirt on. These dudes in a truck laughed too. They make me cry on Christmas *tear*

      Phu and I went to Orbit after school and looked at the shoes. The Fallen ones they just got in are pretty nasty, I wouldn't buy them. They had a new selection of DVS and éS. I must say, those Accel and Accel Plus are some sweet ass shoes. Inexpensive too. Accel plus has System G2 and the strap. I'd buy those for sure. But I'm looking for Lakai right now. Rob said I'd have to bring in a picture of the model so he could order it. I think I'll just go to West49 though.  We had a little something something happen at Heritage last night. It started off with just Phu and I, then a little later, Steve came. So we were skating shirtless then these little whore dancer girls were flirting with us so we were screwing around. We got them to fill up our water bottles too haha suckers. Landed some new stuff, had some fun, fell a few times. Then, like 3 hours later, fag master came (Kyle). We said we'd all trash him all week, but with might show mercy on his poor soul.

      Today, Phu, myself and Kyle went to Heritage to skate. Steve came later on. We skated for a while, and had some games of PIG. The were a few 4 way games, and I won at least won of them (w00t). I also had a good game with just Phu and I. Then a gam ewith just Kyle and I. I like to call it a goof game because we just screwed around for 30 minutes. We'd sit there and keep doing the same trick over and over, and we'd never land it. We did this the whole time. Although we each pulled off some BS in that game.   All in all, it was a good afternoon and I'm glad I went out. I didn't get as tired as I thought I would either. Perfect. I figured I can't tape my DC's up forever so I stooped real low and got Kyles Hawks. I might use them tomorrow if I bring my board.

      I got the O-K from the doctor this morning. BUT   I should expect a wave of fatigue to hit sometime. Extreme fatigue. He even said, if it gets bad, stay home from school. Not at this point I'm thinking "bonus, the doctor told me I can stay home to sleep, sweet deal". Well I doubt it will come to that though, I'm a tough cookie =/. There's more I want to rant about but I'll save it...

           Well I've been much better. I think I'll be fit to go back to school soon enough. I'll admit, I feel like shit mentally and physically, so don't expect me to be all outgoing Mr.excitement. Seriously, not in the best mood.   I don't know what else is going on.. I left the house to get Ginger Ale today. LIEK OMGZ. I'm so proud of myself. Hmm.. oh yes, I want to learn (back foot) Impossible. It seems simple enough, but I don't know, I haven't even tried it yet.  I found a pair of Lakai's for only $39.99US. Which will come up to about $80 with all the shipping and crap. Not bad, and they even have the pair in all sizes. One let down is, the last time I ordered something from here, it took like 8 weeks because of the damn US Customs slowing shi- stuff down. They have it in 2 colorways, White/Gum and All Black.. yeah, I don't know. I'll probably just go out of town and buy a pair. Montreal or something. http://skateamerica.com/Skate/showdetl.cfm?&DID=7&Product_ID=13280&CATID=29

      Welll what did I do today? I worked from about 10:30 to 4:00. So 5.5 hours. I'm supposed to work between 6 and 7 hours a day but you know, things get hectic. What did I do? Umm.. mostly painted. I painted a cieling. 2 cielings. No, 3 cielings.  It's not overly hard work and the pay is good. I make $7 an hour. I pretty much make at LEAST $38 a day which isn't bad at all. I expect to have $350 by Sunday, the latest. Friday the earliest. I think I work Saturday and Sunday but I'm not too sure. A day off would be nice though. So then, when I have a free day, my mom said she'd bring me (and whoever I want to bring) to Ottawa. I plan to do some filming while there.  I got home and showered then came on and talked to Ashley lol always fun! Welll that's about all for me...  aurevoir

      Well at the party, I was with Ashley, and then Lee-Ann yells "quit beating around the bush Justin and just kiss her!". Then Ashley flipped her off lol. Then later, everyone was in the tent, and it was TRUTH OR DARE LOEL. I got duped into playing. I just sat there, semi-clueless. Everyone was picking on Ash and I. First was Ashley had to kiss me. Alright. Then it was "Justin do you still like Ashley". I said "sure. okay, yes I do". Then I think Ashley got asked if she would go out with me, and that was a "I don't know". Phu was recording stuff too, but I'm not sure how that turned out. I was really tired that night. I just wanted to sleep. People kept touching me and I was getting wet from being against the tent. So then Ashley's grandmother gave us a ride home. And when she was going to my house, she drove right over a curb. That was crazy. My head almost hit the roof of the car.  I got off easy. At least I didn't have to kiss a dude.

      Okay I have 2 days to cover here. Sony Camcorder with LCD screen and all that camera stuff, $350. Now I make anywhere from $42 to $49 a day. Do the math. It would take me at least 9 days to work it off. But I already have some money. I think I can get it by next Friday. Good deal, for a camera that would be regular $800 (approx.). There's like hundreds of things I could do with a camera. And it would be completely mine, so I can do anything at all.  Yesterday, I went out to meet Phu and Kyle in the other end of town. Well they were at Bishop to we were skating and then like 10 minutes later Kyle leaves. He wasn't going to come back out because of a phone call (wth?). So Phu and I hung out and then skated at Jean 21 and then went to his house after a little accident eek. So we talked Kyle into coming over, and then Quy and Nick came too. So we were skating at Blockbuster and crap and then the damn cop came and told us to leave. So we did, and we went back to Jean 21, this time with everyone. Then Kyle left, and the rest dropped like flies. So it was Phu and I again for like 90 minutes skating at 10pm, it was cool. Then we decided to leave and got these sweet planks and brought them to Phus house. Then I went home from there. End of story.  Now on to today. I'm tired so I'm not going to write much. Party at Erikas. I met up with Phu and our plan was I buy hotdog buns and he buys hotdogs. That worked out just fine.  oh well, other stuff happend.. I'll leave it at this. goodnight

      Yesterday was the Lakai demo. It was supposed to start at 6pm at the McNabb arena in Ottawa. Ok, cool. Well we get there (My mom, Roger, myself, Phu and Jordon) and there were about 20 skaters outside so we knew we were at the right place. They were all gathered around so we went to see. It was about 4:30pm at this point. This guy was ollieing decks. He ollied 7 decks, stacked width wise. That is crazy. Then some guys said " JUMP THE STEPS LOLZ". So he went way back in the parkinglot for speed and came up, and after a few attempts, he ollied the 8 set. That was really nice too.  6:30 rolls around and still nothing. We're all thinking "wth are they doing?". So then we go to the parking lot on the side, and in the back, there was a crowd. So I said "maybe there's a game of SKATE or something". Yeah I was wrong. The Lakai team had pulled up into the parking lot (30 minutes late) and they got out and started warming up right there. It was sweet. Mike Carroll and Rick Howard were doing the most. They did it all so easily too. Then they left so we went back to the doors.  Anyways, thanks to a problem, we didn't get in until 7:10pm. Go to www.lakai.com for details on that little delay, and www.crailtap.com for pictures.  The demo was 2 hours 30 minites. Not bad. The skaters were awesome. There was Mike Carroll, Rick Howard, Jeff Lenoce, Anthony Pappalardo and Danny Garcia. They had a few other guys skating too, they were good. All in all, they kicked ass, it was awesome. They had a huge ass product toss. I got 20 stickers and 3 posters lol. Umm, autograph signings at the end. I got six. Four on my board and two on a poster. At least 100 kids showed up.  Afterwards, we went to Wendy's (at 10:30) somewhere in downtown Ottawa and so the 3 of us, Phu, Jo and I skated around. It was cool. I'm supposed to go to Ottawa again sometime, just to skate around. I jumped a 3 set a few times, before the demo. That was fun. I got home at 11:45pm and then did whatever.  (I might be buying a camcorder for cheap..hmm)

      Let's see.. I spent most of the day with Ashley, because, I just did. woo! I got my nails marked in the process *sigh* Came home to find my mom in a pissy mood. Fun stuff. Tomorrow I go see the Lakai team. They start at 6pm, I'll be leaving for Ottawa around 2:30pm.  I'm feeling like crap right now, so I'll cut this one short. Later all.

      Yesterday was Canada Day (I'm now 3 hours and 14 minutes into Friday, so technically Canada Day WAS yesterday). My day: Ashley's mom called in the morning (11:15am) and asked if I needed a ride, I said "no, it's okay" even though I secretly could have used a ride. I talk to her mom on the phone more than I talk to Ashley these days. Tisk tisk. So I get there and the mall is closed. Already, my day is off to a craptacular start. So I go and I see Ashley's mom and evidently I was the first to arrive. So I stuck with her and we talked and everything. Then we see Kyle go and sit down and figured it'd be funny to wait and see how long until he spotted us.  Kyle and I took off for drinks and stuff and Ashley's band thing finished so it was the 3 of us for a while, then we found Emma, Lee-Ann and Erika. We found Jess, Amy and Joel, and then went to an Ice Cream thing and stood around for a bit. Then Phu appeared magically, fashionably late (2:05pm) . So we had our gang and soon after Corey and Quy joind our posse. We were all at a picknic table. So Jess & Ash go way off and sit in the grass and talk or something..('bout what?). Phu and I took.. Quy's board and went by the clock tower to skate.  Then we all regroup and Ashley says "we're leaving and we'll meet back here at 9:00". Wow, alright then. So it was myself, Phu, Quy, Kyle and Corey. We went to Kyles, then Coreys, then back to the Clock Tower where Corey went home to play PS2 or something. Everyone was eating so I said "I'll go home and eat, I'll be back in 60 minutes" and Kyle says "sure, we probably won't even move".  So I did my stuff and came back at about 6:05 and our insane posse had gotten much bigger. The Ashley kr3w came back 3 hours early and yea.. so we did whatever for the rest and then it was Amy, Jess, Emma (I think?)Lee-Ann, Erika, Ashley, Phu and myslef. Some other people got mixed in there, I was lost.  So we went by the water and watched fire works. I must say, this year, they were great. The best in Cornwall for as long as I can remember. Ohhhh the moon was sweet ass too. It was red, I swear. It was so pretttyyyyy! The winner that night was the moon, until the clouds covered it and it went back to white. Today was awesome, I'm glad I went. w00t!!  Ashleyyy your hair isn't as bad as I made it sound! After seeing it, it actually doesn't really bother me. Half the stuff I said was just teasing lol. But I stand by whatever I said about the naval. Blehhh. I forget what I said though. :p  **THIS JUST IN** Freaky stuff going on here right now. I'm telling you, this is the wierdest/creepiest thing that has happened to me in a long time.--> I'm alone for the night, as usual, and I went to let the cat in at 3:00am. Well I open the door but no cat. As some of you know, we got this new living room set so our old couch and stuff is all on the veranda.                  I stood there for 5 minutes, completely shocked. Speachless, geeze. It's a girl, she looks to be 14-16, red tanktop and short white shorts. So I say "what the hell? Why are you on my couch?". No response. I was thinking she was ignoring me. So I look at her face and she was freakin' sleeping. WTF??! I'm thinking "shit, there's a girl sleeping on my damn couch, wtf?" So I say some things but she doesn't wake up. Now, I'm here alone, and it's hella cold to be wearing that skimpy stuff. She's fast asleep. She is right there on the couch as I'm typing this, I swear to you.  10% of me is sympathetic; maybe she has nowhere to stay, I'll let her stay for the night?  40% of me is dumbfounded, no clue what to do. What would you do if a teen was sleeping on your damn couch? No idea!  50% Is pissed off and creeped out. Cripes! How the hell? Honestly, who the hell goes onto to someone's porch and sleeps on their couch?!  I should go slap her as hard as I can and say "get the f*ck off my property or I'll kill you". It's dirty but somebody has to do it..why me? damn it
