      Franklin Delano Rooselvelt once said and I quote    "I have seen war. I have seen war on land and sea. I have seen blood running from the wounded; I have seen the dead in the mud. I have seen cities destroyed; I have seen children starving. I have seen the agony of mothers and wives. I hate war."   But it seems like everywhere you see, there is a war going on, people are being killed, rights are being encroached upon. History of mankind is littered with wars and bloodshed, and all of them were fought for one reason to enslave fellow men. Sometime on basis of race, sometime religion and sometime just because one can. Every war was given a name, only difference between past and present is in past they will call it quest to conquer, these days it is always something different.   Not every war involve armies and weapon some are fought differently. There is an ongoing war going in every religion between men of religion and so called liberals. You can't not ask any question without risking a trip to hell, only path to salvation goes through holymen. A man with inquisitive mind is considered non-belie      Matthew 7: Ask, and you will receive. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened for you.    But how? When every door is guarded by a priest, imam or rabbi ?

         	       	 	 	 	 	  	  	    Isn't religions suppose to help people lead a better life, be more tolerant , be considerate and list goes on. But look around you, look closely at every single deeply religious person and you will see that they are not tolerant of anything, they are quick to pass judgment.      It is so easy for people of one faith as eager to banish people of other faith to hell why? does hell really exists, and if it does than isn't it job of god decide who goes to it ?    Instead of teaching tolerance people in place of religion are teaching hate, why it should matter what one believes, if your neighbor does not share your faith, does it affect you? why are people so interested in other people personal life and faith?
