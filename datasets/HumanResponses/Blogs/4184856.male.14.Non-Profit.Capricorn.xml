      I think i may be in love. I've known her since I was a small child and am I  finally  realizing it? No I've had inklings before but this...Let me explain. I was up at Mick Connelly's lake house after his son's Bar Mitzvah. We were all swimming and being happy and I was sad when she left and explaining is moot beyond this point. Best of friends but one's a little bester.

      Just read a couple pages of a book I'd read before then felt blessedly tired but didn't go to sleep. I can never get to sleep these days. I recently had a dream where I would walk down this trail next to a boggy marshy little place to get to open bay water and climb onto the dock. I couldn't climb it though because of the nasty spiders hiding underneath. Pity. Also i remember something about a rich house. A large house...maybe. I forget. All of you shut your mouths and fetch me the...go fetch.

      There's nothing worth telling! Why can't i just spin right back into the world of lies i'm used to. It's hard to be so boring. Oh Well. I'd better work on my story.

      I've recently written to Hollywood unknown Annelise Van Der Pol. Check it fools.  Anneliese, I am writing to say hello and to ask a favor of you. I’m not really a fan of ‘That’s So Raven” but, I do watch the show (if only occasionally and due to a couple of younger sisters in the house). I believe you to be one of the better actors on the show and find you quite attractive as well. Perhaps you should pursue some better acting roles. The show is great and very entertaining, but I would love very much to see you in something serious, something real. You’re very beautiful, and good at acting, from what I can see. I don’t think finding roles would be a problem. Now, onto the reasoning as to why I’m really writing. Most of the mail you get is probably all asking for autographs and proclamations of love for the show. And though I would like an autograph, I’m requesting it, if you would, in a different manner than most. It may sound a tad bizarre, but stick with me. I would like a check…for as little as you see fit, something like a quarter or a dime. It is an autograph, technically. However, you won’t find the amount taken out of your account, as it will simply by mounted and stuck on my wall. To me, the novelty of an autograph/check is insurmountably entertaining. In all probability, this letter with be ignored, as I’m sure it has been delivered stifled among hundreds of others. You’re also bound to have preparations for the show, etcetera. But if you do answer this letter, especially with the special sort of autograph I have requested, I will be sure that a kindness of that level does exist in the world, and will praise you for it. Thank you for simply taking some time out of your day and reading this, if nothing else. Much luck on your future endeavors, be they acting related or otherwise. Please and thank you in advance, and here’s hoping. With love,              Adrien Darcy, age fifteen of Upper Montclair, New Jersey.  P.S.I have noticed online that you charge a fee of $5.00 for an autographed photo. Seeing as this is a bit more elaborate, I have included a sum of $10 as a sort of deposit (should the check should fall into the wrong hands and be cashed) and for any personal inconvenience it will cost you.    Noticed i lied about my name....Well what would you have done? I can't have hollywood get wind of me.    I'm lonely.

       Bon soir mes ami. I've found that living a lie is far more fun than surviving in the world you're provided with. TALKING about such a world...well it just turns my stomach. But I'll do it. And you are going to be here to watch.
