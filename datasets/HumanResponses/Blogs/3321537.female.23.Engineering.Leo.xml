      On Monday, my Hermit Crab will be done with his molting process.  He is already poking his head out some more and starting to be a little more active than he was.  He actually turned himself around to be facing in the oposite direction, but he is still in the corner of the tank.  His exoskeleton is almost completely eaten too, its gross, his old legs are just lying there.  I'm not actually sure if they eat their old legs or not, I guess I will find out soon, if they aren't gone in a couple of days.  I'll post a new picture of him after he is all done molting and he is running around his crabitat.  Sometimes crabs will change their color when they molt.  It depends entirely on their diet.  If they don't get enough calcium in their diet, their color will be faded after they molt.  Which reminds me, I need to buy some new shells for him, cause he may have a tight squeeze in his old shell.  Hermit crabs molt, in order to grow.  See, their bodies grow behind the exoskeleton, and when their bodies are too big for the exoskeleton they molt and shed their exoskeleton to grow a new, bigger one.

       urlLink       As you can see, he has begun eating his exoskeleton, there is less of it left.  He will continue to eat his exoskeleton to regain the calcuim that he lost during the molt process, this will help his body produce Chitin, which hardens his new skin into a brand spanking new exoskeleton.    Pretty gross that he eats his body that is left over.  However, what is really gross is that if he had buddies in his crabitat, they too would be trying to partake in his exoskeleton.

       urlLink    My Hermit crab just molted last night while I was sleeping!  Isn't it gross!  I think it looks cool.  He looks really pink right now, when he comes out of his shell a little.  This little guy needs extra TLC.  He is in a critical state right now, this is the most vulnerable time for Hermit crabs, if not taken care of properly, they can die.  So, I will be watching him closely for the next 10-14 days, until his new exoskeleton hardens.  Pretty neat, huh?&nbsp; urlLink

      I have decided to move my Hermit Crabs in a room with better air circulation than they were in, where the temperature is more stable and in doing so, I managed to bump Crabby's Kritter Kage against the desk ever so slightly and his burrow kinda caved in a bit.  I was worried at first, because he has not been up in almost a week to eat or drink.  He already molted in May though, so I do not think he would be due for another, especially since he started burrowing about two weeks after his molt.  However, I thought what an opportunity to shine a dim flashlight into the now bigger hole to his burrow to see how he is doing.  Sure enough, I could see his little antennae flicking back and forth, so he is ok.  I'll leave him be and not disturb him any longer.  He will come back up on his own time.  Rigby and Pepper are doing well in their little tank, bright eyed and active, often following eachother around.  I may mist them tonight and let them run around in a big rubbermaid container looking at shells, they seem to like that a lot.  Atleast, that is what they can do while I am bloggin' and taking care of the daily chores required in keeping up their little dwelling.  Well, that is all for now.

      So, I bathed my crabbies today and Crabby is still burrowed, but he is eating, so I guess he is fine.  I am a little worried about him, but I will put on my pacing slippers and not dig him up like I am tempted to do.  I still have not gotten a new tank for them, but all in good time as they say.  We need to make some room for it, because we are buying the stand for it as well, it can store all my Hermie supplies for them nicely and out of the way, because right now the supplies are very much in the way.  I recently bought new shells and my hermies looked more interested in them than they previously were, so I guess that is good.  I also bought a Coconut Hut for them, for the new tank.  See, this is getting bad, because I haven't even bought the tank yet, but I am already buying things to go into it for decoration and nice little hiding spots for them.  Oh well, atleast I won't have to do all of that after I buy the tank, I'll just be ready to set it up and boom it will be done for the time being.

      I guess the smell came from the water getting mixed in their food, because the past couple of days the smell has been gone.  So, I have no need to worry.  Plus both crabs are pretty active, not lethargic like they can get when they are getting ready to molt.  Mr. Crabbykins has been hiding a lot, but he is eating and drinking because he has been leaving lots of evidence behind that there is some activity going on.  Unfortunately, due to work, there are a lot of hours in the day that I am not watching his tank and seeing if he is coming up out of his burrow.  He missed the bath day a couple of days ago, so I will bathe him before I get him into the new tank I am buying for them.  Hopefully, I will get it this weekend and set it all up, but we will see.

      My crabs that are in the ISO tank smell like the ocean.  I don't know what it is, at first I thought it was their food, but I changed their food and dug the left overs out of the substrate and put them back in and they smelled a little better, but still like the ocean.  Its weird.  I hope one of them is not on the verge of molting, because I have heard that they sometimes get this smell when they are about to molt.  The problem is that I don't know which one it would be.  I checked for the signs of premolting symptoms last night, but I saw none.  Well, I guess I should just keep a close eye on them.

      He has been in his burrow for the past 2 days.  He is so far in and so covered up that it looks like there is no crab in my tank.  I'm surprised he didn't come out for feeding time like he normally does.  I don't think he can possibly molt again, in a few days it will have been a month since he last molted.  I don't think that they can molt again so quickly, but I could be wrong.  He has been eating a lot more since he molted last and has been having parties in the water dishes every night, except for last night.  Anyhow, I don't know what is up with him, but I did not try to dig him up, I left him alone like I am supposed to.  Digging crabs out of their burrows causes them a lot of stress.  Rigby and Pepper are doing well, they are just about ready to be introduced to the main tank.  However, I am going to buy the 30 gallon cube tank at Petsmart and set it up, then I will introduce all three crabs to a new home at once, that is if Crabby comes out of his burrow at all.  So, that will be later this week sometime.

      I heard that they had square aquariums at Petsmart and so I took a little trip there this weekend and sure enough, they did.  So, I am going to invest in one later this week for my little guys to have a bigger space.  Its a little on the pricey side, but I think it will be a good thing to do, because they will be much more comfortable.  It is in the shape of a cube, so it is high enough, so that I can also add a second level for them to climb up on.  In addition, I was checking out the ingredients on the hermit crab food I have for them compared to another brand and found I was spending more money on hermit crab food that was missing some key ingredients that they need to have in their diet.  No wonder they don't eat that kind when I offer it.  Terrafauna Hermit Crab meal and cakes is a complete rip off.  I bought the Jurassi Diet hermit crab food and it was a dollar cheaper and had better stuff in it.  Lesson learned, I am going to be checking on those labels more often.  It makes sense though, I check labels on the food I buy for myself to make sure I am not eating empty calories and crap, so it should be the same for our animals too.  They do have "junk food" for animals too.

      Here it goes, the bigger purple pincher's name will be Rigby and the smaller purple pincher's name will be Pepper.  I figure they are neutral names, so if I find out their sex one day, I don't have to feel stupid over giving them a name of the opposite sex.  Today when I woke up Pepper and Rigby were sound asleep in the sand and to my surprise, right before I left for work, Crabby arose to greet me.  He was all covered in forest bedding, he seems to enjoy his new burrow.

      When I was misting and feeding my crabs today and checking out their tanks, I found mold on Crabby's crawl wall.  I don't think I will mist it anymore (like the package says to), it causes too many problems.  So I took the wall out of his tank and the iso tank, just in case.  None of the mold got on the substrate thank goodness. I keep his humidity level at 70% exactly to prevent mold from growing anywhere, but some just snuck by, I guess you can't prevent everything.  Still thinking of names for my Hermies, I played with the thought of naming them after Beatles songs.  I could name them: Maxwell (from Maxwell's Silver Hammer), Lucy (from Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds), Eleanor Rigby or Eleanor or Rigby (actually I like those they are kinda cute names, Sgt. Pepper or Sgt. or Pepper, Rita (from Lovely Rita), Penny (from Penny Lane).  So here is the final list of names to choose from:        Maxwell       Lucy       Eleanor       Rigby       Sergeant       Pepper       Rita       Penny

      He really was chillin like a villian, cause about 10 minutes after I wrote the last post, he comes out of his burrow and starts scooting around the crabitat, playing in the ocean water and kickin' up his chilepedes like a happy little crab.  So, there was no need for any alarm, he was fine, just a late riser for his nocturnal day.  The other kids were just sitting on the inside of the crawl wall still this morning.  I'm not sure what has gotten into them, but we will just have to see.  They didn't come down and eat at all last night, there were no little footprints in the sand that I smoothed out last night.  I think they are just trying to relax in the new environment.  I still need to come up with names for them, no Spongebob or Finding Nemo names though, people name their crabs after those characters too much.  I want to be more creative.  I'll have to think about it some more.

      It seems Crabby has decided to take refuge and burrow down in his forest bedding.  He already molted a couple of weeks ago, so I know he cannot be doing that, maybe he is just relaxing, who knows, I will just let him be.  He was just sitting in it, with his little feelers going.  I couldn't see what he was doing in there, so I shone a mini flashlight on him, so I could see if he was just chillin or really burrowing.  He was chillin like a villian.    As for the two new purple pinchers that are in the isolation tank, they have decided that it is more fun to sleep in the air hanging on to the crawl wall than it is to sleep in the sand.  Strange little boogers.  I smoothed out the sand to see if they move from their aerial positions while I am asleep at all.  I want to put them in the main tank, but I know it isn't a good idea for the first two weeks, to make sure that they are not disease ridden guys.  Ok, that's all I have for today.  Maybe some pics tomorrow, we will see.

      Today, I misted my hermit crabs and to my surprise the Ecuadorian one I have, Crabby, chirped at me, so I let him down to wander in the big tub to dry off.  My little ones don't get much exercise by wandering in the tub, so I am going to invest in a couple of minature sized hamster exercise balls, so that they can wander around the apartment or house and get more activity in.  So, I am presented with a new dilema for these kids, I need to come up with new names for the two new kids on the block.  They are both Purple Pinchers and I haven't gotten to see much of their personalities, mostly because I have had them for only a few days.  Any ideas, if so, leave me a comment.

       Now, I have three Hermit crabs.  I have to isolate the two new guys for a couple of weeks to make sure that they are healhy enough to be in the same tank as Crabby.  So far so good, they are active and have the full amount of legs.  This summer I am going to build them a custom Hermit Crab tank, it will be my new project.  How exciting is that?  I think I might even make a multilevel one.  Crabbing is such a fun hobby.   urlLink    New Hermit crabs to add to the collection.  This one is a small purple pincher, he just had a stress coat bath and now he is wandering around looking at shells for a couple of hours to see if he wants to switch.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Here is the other Purple Pincher I got from PetCo today.  He is about twice the size of the other one and a little bigger than Crabby.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Here is the big one hiding out, being antisocial, he tried to pinch me at PetCo, but my palm was flat, so he couldn't pinch me if he tried.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Here is my little buddy, Crabby, he gets to look and pick a shell today too.  Equal treatment for all the Hermies.  I went to WalMart today cause I was tipped off that they had a lot of good seashells in the crafts department for 96 cents.  About 10 of them came in a little basket.  To think, I was going to order them online from sea shell city for 20 bucks for the same amount and assortment.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Here is the little purple pincher, getting used to the surroundings before he tries to look at shells, he's testing out the waters.  I gotta come up with names for these little guys.  The cute guy at PetCo who was helping me pick them out, said I should get one of the Jumbo Ones.  I thought about it, but decided I would have to buy a bigger tank in order to do that.&nbsp; urlLink

      Being concerned about Crabby's condition, I went to an online Hermit Crab community and asked about his lost claw.  They said not to worry, just to make sure he can reach his food easily.  The cause of the lost pincher claw was that the claw wasn't molting from the exoskeleton completely, so he had to drop it.  If I feed him a good diet, he will start to grow a gel numb of a pincher claw and after a few molts he will be as good as new.  So, when I start to see his gelly nub of a claw, I'll take a pic and post it, cause gel nub legs and claws look really gross and very interesting.  See, its like a never ending science project, these critters get more and more interesting as the days wind on.

       urlLink     Here is Mr. Crabby as promised.  He is still not quite himself, for some reason he did not come out of his molt with a big claw, but only the small one.  He is going through some seperation anxiety over losing his lovely pincher claw.  The good news is that his claw will grow back during the next molt.  I am trying not to disturb him too much still, because he needs to recooperate from losing a pincher claw, he needs no more added stress to his life right now.  Tomorrow is cleaning day, his crabitat will get new sand and he will get a long awaited bath, so I may try to sneak a picture in during that if I can.  If anyone out there knows why a crab wouldn't come out of a molt with a pincher claw, leave me a comment, I would love to know if there is any additional support I can give him so that he can be a happy crab.  He seems to be doing ok without the Pincher claw, but I worry about him.  Since Hermit Crabs are exotic animals and cannot reproduce in captivity, if we own one, we should take extra special care of them, because they paid a big price when they were being snatched away from the wild. &nbsp; urlLink

      This weekend I did my monthly deep cleaning and I ended up putting all three crabs in one tank.  I figured that it was time for them to get acquainted with one another since I had a few hours to watch their behaviors.  My PetCo crabs, Rigby and Pepper have been isolated for about a month from Crabby, just to make sure that they were healthy enough to be with him and because I haven't had a lot of time lately to let them interact in close quarters.  When I give them baths they interact in a big tub full of different shells, but they are more into the shells than eachother normally, so they hardly pay attention to one another and it is a much larger area that they roam in.  It was a little different in the crabitat though.  Crabby seemed more interested in them than they were interested in him, he was a little more aggressive about them moving in on him.  Pepper seemed pretty interested in him as well, but Rigby got into the forrest bedding and decided to take a nap.  For the past few days, Pepper and Crabby have been getting to know one another, doing the feeler fight thing and checking eachother out.  So, far it has been friendly play and not hostile warfare between them, which is good, because they are around the same shell size, so I was really worried about potential shell disputes.  Although they are two different species of hermit crab, so I really shouldn't have a problem.  The difference in species usually means a different preference of shells, so I think they will be fine.  That's all for now.

      Yesterday night I was checking him out, because he was being social and walking around his crabitat, not hiding, like he has been doing a lot lately.  Well, I saw that he looked a little lighter in color than usual and that he had a new pincher claw!  I think he pulled a fast own on me and molted by surprise.  I figured it had to happen pretty fast if he was to regain his new claw.  Also, I have been giving him more Ocean Water so that it would help with the nourishment in growing his new claw.  I had heard that if you give them more ocean water, they tend to grow back their limbs faster, but I did not expect him to grow it back in 2 months!  Crazy, but good for him.  As soon as his normal color returns, I'll introduce him to the others.  I left him in iso since his last molt, because he had no pincher claw and I didn't want to take any chances with him being defenseless against potential shell fights.  My baby is ok now, Yeah!  Rigby and Pepper are doing good, just being themselves.  They are great friends and follow each other everywhere.  Pepper is Rigby's shadow at times and they crawl all over one another like two little peas in a pod.  Well that is all I have for now, I need to get new pics of them up, I just haven't had a lot of time to do so, I've been pretty busy lately.

      All my crabs are doing well, everybody's getting more social and less afraid of bath time.  Crabby comes out of his burrow more often now and Pepper is about the most social little crab I have ever seen.  Oh, on Monday, I went to the Block and saw the crab kiosk over there.  This time there were no mites crawling on the crabs and they were more active, the guy must have added more UTHs to the tank and OMG cleaned!  Still no humidity or temperature gages though, however the substrate was not cold to the touch like it was previously.  I saw some really exotic looking crabs that could not have been Purple Pinchers, Ecuadorians or Ruguosos, they were more of a blue color and I also saw a very purplely one as well.  I was tempted to buy one, but that will have to wait for later on when I can accommodate another crab.

      Last night when I got home, Crabby was walking around, outside of his burrow, so I took the opportunity to bathe him and let him wander in the shell tub.  I wanted to see if he was interested in shell shopping, he wasn't too interested in them, but he was enjoying his wandering outside of his kritter kage.  Pepper and Rigby were throwing a party and I guess that every morning when my mom gets up, she sees them partying.  So, they are quite the party crustaceans, I asked her if they had a keger, complete with strippers and nose candy.  She said no and that they were partying straightedge, so they were having good clean fun.
