      And whiskers on kittens,  Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens, Brown paper packages tied up with strings, These are a few of my favourite things....  But I don't get to see them too often now do I. It has been "that" kind of a day. Not much happened today as against happening today since it is 10.21 PM right now at this instant of time. I'm sitting around at home on a saturday night listening to "The four seasons" by Antonio Vivaldi. The music is good. Just finished doing some chores at home like folding the clothes and putting them back inside after they had a good day in the sun. Cleaning of the restroom with bleach. Having "something" for dinner. I say "something" since there isn't much to go around at home. We havn't been shopping for almost 2 weeks and things have almost run out. We better get to the market and fast. This time around though, I think I am going to let people take a lead in arranging a trip to the market. I've been doing it for long enough now and it's time people do it more often at home. It dosen't have to be me everytime. Not that others havn't ever done it, but just that they've done it so few times I can count it at the tips of my fingers probably.   That apart, spend the day today pretty much just lolling about doing just about nothing whatsoever. Went to the bank in the morning to deposit my first paycheck from the internship. Followed that up with a visit to the library to pick up a book I had requested and had just come in. I didn't even bother to open the book once since I got home. Just goes to further underline the amount of laziness that this day has generated. I doubt tomorrow is going to be any different. With Sean's birthday being tomorrow, I still havn't thought of any gift for him. I don't want to give him the regular "cigar" or "bottle 'o wine". Something that stands out. Maybe one of the handicrafts I got with me when I came back from India. Maybe something else. I'll think about it. As for now, I'm just gonna go hit the sack. Why not just take advantage of the fact that it was a lazy day and just go to sleep. Might as well try and make the best use of a lazy day I say :-D

      Sitting here, just watching the arms of the clock move around, I wonder what the future holds for me.   There are so many possible directions my life can take from here. With regards to work, studies, friends, travel, leisure and most of all, my loved ones. True, I do miss home a lot even if I do not show it or even if I do not call home ever so often. Listening to some music from the gift CD set "The Gang" gave me on my birthday 4 hrs ago, I couldn't help but drift back in time a few years and remember the days bygone, friends lost touch with, opportunities coming and going, work, and of course, "The Gang".   That just gave rise to a bout of nostalgia in itself. The last 1 hour ( between the last paragraph and this one) was spent looking at old photographs from college days, from the two trips to vaishno devi, from the days of our farewell in college, from the days spent loitering around campus looking for "Photo Ops". Those were some happy days of my life. These are some happy days of my life too. Memories of time well spent. Memories of things well done and accomplished. Memories of friends. But memories are just that. Memories. The moment you start living on memories, you've lost the battle. Live for the moment. Derive STRENGTH from the memories and from knowing that eveny moment well spent will give you memories worth remembering. So don't waste this moment that you are in right now. Live life to the fullest. Make the best of it and you will die a happy man :-)

      Take a look at the mirror will you. Are you really who people think you are? More importantly, are you who you think you are? Are you a follower? Are you a leader? Are you a breakaway? Are you a loner? Are you a social person? Do you crave publicity?     ARE YOU BEING WHAT YOU WANT TO BE?    "To be what you want to be is to waste who you are."  What is it that drives you to do whatever it is that you do? Give a little thought to these questions.

      I think it's about time ****** paid up. It's been over 4 months now. All in all, he owes me more than $850 now. I say it's about time. I really need to start paying back my loan back home and will need to pay the CC bill soon. Plus I'll have to pay cash for the car soon.  Let's see what happens in the weeks to come.

      Just in case you are wondering about the morbid nature of these last few posts, don't bother. It's just something that came across my mind and hence I penned it down, even if without a pen as such.   I've been listening to this song for quiet some time now. I don't know what it is about the song that attracts me. It is wierd to say the least. But I still continue to listen to it as I am writing here.   It's not like I've had a bad week. It's not like I'm under too much pressure at work. It's not like I'm not doing well in school. It's not like I have issues with arranging my finances. It's not like I'm not having fun. In fact I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11 today. Pretty strong documentary. I can if I was not having fun. Heck I even drove back in Ezra's car today from office. Despite all that work done in a day, I still feel the lack of something. A lack of the sense of achievement. Maybe I need to take a real break and go to the wilderness and spend some time alone there. Just go into the wilderness and sitting back and just lying around doing nothing for some timewith the sun shining through the tree leaves...wow...I can already imagine it...:-)

       Thanks for this lovely song guys...I'm gonna be listening to it for the next few days without a break for sure...!!    No one knows what it's like To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes  No one knows what it's like To be hated To be fated To telling only lies  But my dreams They aren't as empty As my conscience seems to be  I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance That's never free  No one knows what it's like To feel these feelings Like I do And I blame you  No one bites back as hard On their anger None of my pain and woe Can show through  But my dreams They aren't as empty As my conscience seems to be  I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance That's never free  When my fist clenches, crack it open Before I use it and lose my cool When I smile, tell me some bad news Before I laugh and act like a fool  If I swallow anything evil Put your finger down my throat If I shiver, please give me a blanket Keep me warm, let me wear your coat  No one knows what it's like To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes                    - The Who
