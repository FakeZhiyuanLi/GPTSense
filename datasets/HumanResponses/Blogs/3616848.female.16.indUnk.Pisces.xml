        We got 3rd place in the tournament. So HA to all you public school kids who think all the Christian kids suck. Cause we don't. So there. OH yeah I have a new story about the mean girls at temescul, Okay so I am walking along the baseline after our game and coming right towards me is this girl on temesculs team. So anyways, I am carrying both the medkit and bballs (cause freshman still don't get that its there job but I don't mind) and the chick says excuse me. Can you believe it. Actually that's not what was bad. After she recognized me she was all "Move" She spoke in a very offensive manner. I think it was uncalled for. She probably went back to all her friends and was all I so totally told that Christian chick. Oh well, I don't care. I will probably never see any of them again.    I so excited for next year bball. We get to go to Washington. We get to fly and stay in a hotel. It is going ot be muy divertido. Oh yeah, Caitlin what is "buenos caballos"? I didn't get that part.    Lets see what else did I do today. I woke up and went to church. I wasn't as tired today and was able to stay quit awake. I even know what all of the sermon was about. It was about who God is and how knowing who he is is the answer to all our questions. That isn't a very good summary. I am sure my dad could do a better job. After church I skipped the Ice cream social thing and went home. I bribed my little sister into going to get me some Ice cream though. It wasn't very good. Nothing like Baskin Robbins. After that I practiced the piano. I never practice the piano. I learned The Coloring Song. It has the prettiest words and a beautiful melody. I did that for and hour or so and then I went to the bball game. WE WON!! I already said that so never mind.         WARNING: I am going to start Complaining so stop reading now cause its a waste of time.     The girls were so aggressive. They grab your jerseys and all this stuff. Its dumb. They were pressing us and I am such a bad inbounder. I think Meg R. should do it. She is a way better passer than me. I threw so many turnovers. Sometimes I feel really bad during the game. Like I never know if what I am doing is right or not. I will drive to the basket or something and get fouled and I don't know if I was supposed to that. I will even look at the coaches to see if they are mad that I did what I did but they are expressionless. And sometimes I feel like a total ball hog. But I don't know what else to do cause barely anybody shoots. Well actually a lot of people were shooting tonight. Like Megan had nice outside shots and so did Courtney. And then I felt so bad at the end of the game cause we were up by 4 or something like that and I was telling everyone that we had to get the rebound. Well then the ball came right off the basket to the player I was supposed to box out. If the game was closer and they would have scored It would have been all my fault. I felt like a total hypocrite. I am glad that we don't have bball cept for Wednesday. I love the sport and all but I am so tired and bruised. I think everyone is. It will be nice to have a break. Now instead of playing I get to work, yeah! Ann wasn't there cause she went to universal Studios with her family. I forgot she wasn't going to be there so I didn't say goodbye. I feel bad. I wont see her till Vball time. Gosh I keep on complaining again. I just thought of a name for my blog. "The many complaints of Katherine."All right I am done. I feel sorry for anyone reading this.  I am going to go back to the top and put a warning for everyone to stop reading cause I am going to complain. Night.                                                 P.S. Jessica I am hearing noises outside my window to. Is it you? Or maybe its just the gnomes that come my sisters hair in her room. Sweet Dreams.

      Does anyone know haw to download a picture from a digital camera to a computer? Cause I cant figure it out. It is so frustrating. All this technology. Oh well, tell me if any of you know how to do it. Everyone go to megan R's page O.K. It is http://www.megar0o.blogspot.com/    Lets see today was my far away brothers birthday. I didn't call him or anything which kind of makes me feel bad cause he always calls me on my bday. I don't have anything to talk to him about. Well I do, but it is hard to think of all the little stuff in my life to tell him when I never see him. It is almost as if there is to much to tell so why bother starting to. I really should try.    We lost our game tonight by 13 in think. All of us seemed so tired. I didn't feel like playing that much and played a horrible game. I am so tired. I don't know why. I really should go to bed cause tomorrow is church. I am going to bible class so I have to get up at seven thirty. It has been so bad the last two Sundays. I keep on almost falling asleep. Last Sunday it was probably 2 minutes into the sermon and already I was nodding off. I should really change that. I am going to try. After church there is going to be an ice cream social. I really don't want to go. Just cause none of my friends come to my church during the summer. Everyone goes to Christ the Vine. I don't know why. It is probably cause it is so much closer to all of them.     Brian, I think that thing you wrote on your blog was great. It is so true that we so often just sit around feeling sorry for ourselves and waste our lives away doing nothing. You should totally be a pastor or teacher. You have a great gift.     All right I have to go or else I will make it three Sundays in a row of almost falling asleep. Buenos noches.            Thanks Caitlin, for the info on how to say goodnight.                                P.S. I need to come up with a new name for my blog anyone have any suggestions.

      Oh my Gosh Darn,     I have so many bruises. People are going to start thinking my Dad BEATS me. Which he does. No I am just kidding. My Father would never do a thing like that. No but I do have a ton of bruises. Hold on a sec Ill count them for you............There are eleven and that doesnt count all the scratches from the girlies who never cut their nails. My whole right arm is scratched up. One of them looks infected. Probably from some chica who doesnt clean under her nails. Oh what I just saw another bruise so its 12 now. All those Public school girls are so viscous. Let me make a list for all of you.-They grab your jersey -Hit you with their elbows -Scratch up your arms -ATTACK you in the Bathroom. Well actually I am just kidding about the last one. My list wasn't that good so I had to add something good to it. It is so scary though. I never want to go in the bathroom by myself cause I am afraid that the other team might be in there and I don't want them to beat me up. Isn't that horrible. A person should be allowed to at least pee in peace. All the schools are mad at us cause we beat them. Ann and I were walking past some girls from Temescul Canyon and Megan R's mom saw them hitting there fists into their hands at us. Isn't that scary. I don't want to get beat up. And then at our second game they were booing us and trying to make us miss our free throws. You wanna know what is even worse. Somehow they found out my name. Meghan B. said they were yelling out my name during the game. I don't like people I don't know knowing my name. That was a very confusing sentence. I shouldn't complain though cause I hit all of them right back. Not on purpose though of course. So Krytle, you get to see the smart side of public school and I get to see the Jock side. There was one really really annoying girl on the other team. She was guarding me and whenever I got the ball she would start screaming BALL BALL BALL in my face. It wasn't just some little scream either. It was a full out bloody murder scream. I almost went deaf. I wanted to hit her so she would shut up. I even thought about it, but then I would get a technical foul and be taken out of the game. My parents and couches would all get mad at me and think I had an attitude problem so I didn't do it. I wanted to though. All right that is enough complaining for a little while. That's all I ever do, complain, complain, complain. O.K. I am done.      Caitlin I am soooooooo glad you are going to gsbc. I hope it is fun. That would stink to pay 75 bucks for a horrible time. I would have put you down to be a counselor with me but I already sent mine in. The only thing with us being counselors together is that we wouldn't have free nights together. All right I had better go to bed. This morning I didn't wake up till 12:30. I would have kept sleeping but my sister came in and asked if I wanted to wash her car fro ten bucks. That got me out of bed fast. Sleeping that late makes me feel like a bumb. I am going to go watch T.V. now so Good night said in spanish. I don't know how to say that.

      Oh man those little girlies can be sooo lazy. I mean the girls at the basketball camp. If we tell them to run to get water and then run back to their spots, they still walk. And then they had to put the balls away and some of them just threw them off to the side so Leah and I told them to get them and all but one kept on walking. I was so mad. I dont know what is wrong with kids today. Sheesh. No but seriously, some of them are soooo lazy and dont listen to anybody. If my kids are brats I am going to spank um. I know that sounds really harsh but here is nooooooooo way my kids are going to be the ones none of the parents ever want over. This camp is taking forever to end. It feels like it should be Thursday, but no its only Tuesday. This week is so long, and its going to be even longer cause we have games every day this weekend. Oh well I shouldn't complain, I love bball.       Our last game we lost by only one point. We would have won if I hadn't missed my freethrows. I don't know what is  wrong with me I just cant focus at the line. I should shoot like Jess Bry. With one hand. I don't have the guts to do it though. I tried it fresh year but aired it and everyone gave me a hard time. I got so mad in the game. I don't know why I think it was cause the other team was really pushy. There was on time that I screamed really loud. There is a new freshman on our team and I inbounded the ball to her and she turned around and almost pulled a joelle. She was about to shoot into the other teams basket!!! I yelled so loud. I was all, NNNNOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! She would have made it to if she had shot. I mean she was wide open and all.

      All right Jess Bry. I am writing for you. I have been really busy lately and havent had time or felt like writing but you told me to write so I am. Lets see, not much is happening. I am just working and playing summer bball. Oh yeah. I am also going to go to Good S Bible C. I hope it is fun. Meghan B is also going s it will be fun as long as she doesnt ditch me for Tristan. I am sure she wont do that though. They can go off and have their alone talky talk time, but she has to hang out with me some what. Or I will be ANGRY.GRRRRR. No but megs a good friend so she wont. My little sister and cousin are going to go also. I hope I can be their councilor. My little sis will probably end up getting homesick and start crying. Or she will come and wake me up so she can sleep in my bed. I wouldnt be surprised. I havent been to camp since 99. I guess it has changed alot since then. I hope I dont have to watch the kids the whole time. Jaymie said we get free nights but I dont want to watch them the whole day. I had better not get a cabin full of little bratty kids who dont listen to me. I cant stand that. All right TTFN

      I am kind of sad. My brother moved out today. Right now I am on the floor of his empty room typing this out on my dad's laptop cause my brother took his computer with him. It is so weird to go into his room and it is empty. *Sniff* I miss him already. No but really I do. Lately I haven't seen him all that much, but whenever I do he is always fun to talk to. My parents are so sad. I guess when I was at work tonight they were crying about it. I have never seen my Dad cry. He seemed really upset when he came to pick me up. my sister asked him if he was sad and he said yes cuase now he is the only boy left in the house with a bunch of girls. Oh well we will all make it through. On the bright side I can be on the computer talking to people for as long as I want. Except tonight their is noone on to talk to. Where are all of you. I guess you all have lives or something and dont have o just sit in front of a computer at night talking to no one. Its so depressing. All right Icant do this anymore I feel like a loser. Ha the graduation talk. "You are not a LOSER for being a christian" Thats all I remember from his sermon.

      Yeah well tonight was the first night of Bball. It was kind of fun to start with but then I started getting really tired. Nobody knew what to do cept a couple of us. I was really frustrating to cause there were only 7 of us and so we just had to keep on playing. I am so tired right now so that is all I am going to write.

      Finally, I am done with work for two days. After 8 hours of asking people wether they want a regular of large and if the want whipped cream or not, you can get pretty tired. No but work is fun the girls are all really nice and alot of fun. And hey, getting a paycheck now and then is cool to even if I never have a chance to spend it.      Tommorrow is B-ball and I have to prepare myself to be totally tired and entirelly ready to lose. We are playing public teams and we always lose. Nobody knows what to do or where to go. Tomorrow night there are only 7 girls. Jaymie why do you have to be on vacation? Adrienne and Joelle why do you have to have surgery? Oh well, I am sure it will be somewhat fun. At least I get to play a guard. I think I might try to shoot a three. I am sure I will air it like the two I took during last season. They were so embarasing. Any ways this is all really boring.     It is so sad. Today my Dad left for Arizona and wont be back for a couple of days. Anyways the sad part is that I didnt get to say goodbyt to him. I forgot he was leaving and went to work. I called him later to see if he could bring me food and he said he was in Arizona. That was when I realized he was gone. It is alright though I dont get sad when he is gone anymore. I used to like when I was little. I used to cry at night cause he would be gone for sometimes 5 days at a time. Doesnt that make you sad. I was a little cry baby.      All right well I am going to go cause I want to watch Paycheck. C ya.

      All right I am officially annoyed. This is the third time that I have had to type this. The first time My computer got messed up and deleted the whole thing and the last time my brother came home so I had to delete the whole thing.  Anyways, a big HAPPY BDAY to Krystle. Sorry you have to be so far away on your bday.  Caitlin, You got me started on this now. Since I talked to you last night It seems like everyone has these so I have to get one to. Its that darn peer pressure working on me again.   A summer a time of boredom. If it wasnt for my job I think i would go cazy. All i do all day is clean and watch my little sis and now write on this. I also kind of started cooking, but that got a little boring. all right after the third time of writing the same thing you dont want to write it any more. There used to be alot more but I dont want to write it all over again. Adios.

      Hey all you few guys who read this here is a tip for you, DONT HIT ON WAY YOUNGER GIRLS. Yeah well the reason why I am going to change my name to Katherine is cause now this really scary old guy knows my name. I was working today and this 40 year old guy comes in and orders a shake. The guy kind of looked gay but apparently wasn't. Well I get him his shake and ring him up when he asks me his name. I thought he was just being friendly but I guess he was interested. I told him my name and He said, "I am Erick" I said nice to meet you. By this time I was a little weirded out. So then he says thank you and I might have a shake when I get off. I was starting to get scared. So then he askes me when I am going to get off. I was like no way am I telling this guy. So I said I don't know I would have to check. Then I gave him his money said bye and walked away. It was so weird and gross. He was way old. If he had been 17 or 18 and cute I would have been fine but not 40 and ugly no way.

      Hey all,   Sorry if I havent been on lately cause I HAVE NO COMPUTER. I have to go to church to write. I hope I will have internet soon. Well you all wont be hearing from me anyways for quite awhile cause my parents are making me go camping at one of the prettiest places in the world. It is great and all but a little on the boring side. Cause I dont know anyone. I am to shy to just walk up to complete strangers and talk to them. Like last year there were a lot of teenagers and stuff there but I guess I am just a wimp. If I had a friend with me then I would go up and talk to them but not by myself. It ok though. I might go horse back riding and to a really cool awuarium.  Oh well, Maybe I will meet some really hot guy and have a great time, but I really doubt it.  Okay I had better go for now

      Hey Caitlin, &nbsp;This is for you, but i have to be careful about what I say cause well you know. You who have seen H.P. know what I am talking about. Well there was a whole lot of it then and now. WOW,&nbsp;that was really weird I just got a whole whif of your lotion and I feel like doing something nice for you. To bad your to&nbsp;far away. Oh my Gosh,&nbsp;There is this really annoying thing that has been playing&nbsp;the same little tune from Whinnie the Pooh for the past hour. It is really annoying, but I am to lazy to go and find it to throw it against the wall. All right my parents want me to go and help&nbsp;finish packin . Sianara. Is that how you spell it.&nbsp;

       Well I am back from camp now. It was a lot of fun. Except for the parts where we had to watch the little kids, wait in lines for our food, get dirty the second your out of the shower, listen to little kids tell their "exciting" stories about what happened to them when they were little (Which was so long ago for them), and listen to little and older kids scream because they saw a bee and it might sting them. Other then that it was loads of fun. All the fun stuff outweighs the bad. But seriously, so many of the little kids were so scared of bees or any other bug. If they saw any flying insect they would freak out and start screaming and running around like penguins with their heads cut off. It was so cool though cause I got every night off. We played spoons one of the nights. It wasn't just spoons, it was   extreme   spoons. The game that tests not only your mental stamina, but also your&nbsp;physical endurance. Who can race the fastest to get the licorice across the room is the true test of any great player. I guess I was never that great player. But that's only cause I never cheated like some People.  )

      Yeah well who ever said Change was bad was only half wrong. I moved last night. Last night I slept in a strange house and woke up in a place I didnt recognize. Yeah some of you are probably saying, I never knew she was moving. But just to let you know I didnt know either till a little while ago. My house is really nice except for the fact that there is no flooring, only my bathroom is done, and that my cat is going to die. My cat is going to die, because he is so used to having so much room to run around in and now we are stuck by Mission Road that is always busy and I will bet you anything that he is going to get run over. So when you see the title " My CAT IS DEAD" you will already know what I am talking about and that I am probably crying my heart out.  &nbsp; I am so tired. I didnt go to sleep till one thirty and then I woke up at 12:00, but I am still tired. TodayI dont have to work which is nice. the bad thing is that I cant get away from the house which I really want to since it is so uncomfortable and I dont have anything set up. I just have to keep telling myself that this is all a great experience.

      Yeah well not much happened today. I went to work from 11 to 4 and then got in the car to go play bball. We won but I didnt think I played really well. Like, it was a really boring game and I felt so lazy and like I wasnt doing anything worth while. I dont really like being post anymore, but I have to be it cause everyone is hurt or not here. Also we have tons of guards. Oh yeah in our game I had the ball and the girl on the other team was trying to taunt/trash talk me. It as stupid especially since we were winning by so much. She was all " Yeah, whachya going to do huh. Come on." It was retarded since I could have totally taken her.  Yeah well that was my excitement for one day. See Ya. Well not really/ night

        All right, I know a lot of people drink on the fourth, but everyone should have their limits. Especially when they aren't even 16.    So I went to the vista fireworks with mi familia and my lil and older sisters friends. We listened to this band play on stage and then the fireworks finally started. We stayed for about 10 minutes after they were over and then we decided to leave. We went to the car and got in a huge traffic jam and decided to take a short cut. Now most of you know that I am not very good with directions, but my Dad can be even worse sometimes. We went into this residential area and got stuck a couple of times but finally we found the main road. Anyways by this time my little sister and her friend had to go to the bathroom. We stopped at a gas station and my mom and them all went in. My older sister, her friend, my dad and I all stayed. We were sitting in the car talking when we saw this one lady walk by. She was so messed up. She kept looking at us over our shoulder and was totally on drugs. Then, all of a sudden this girl comes running out of the store. We all started talking about how short her skirt was and thought it probably would come up while she was running. Well we were right except it didnt come up cause she was running. She had to go to the bathroom so bad that she ran over to the planter, pulled up her skirt, pulled down her bathing suit and went to the bathroom. My sister stopped mid sentence and you could hear the intake of breath through out the whole car. It was such a surprise. The girl came back and you could tell she was so wasted. She couldn't walk straight and just kept on laughing. Her friends weren't much better off. My Dad was so embarrassed. He just turned away and was shaking his head. Yeah well that was my excitement for the fourth. I took us an hour to get home from a place that's 15 minutes away.  O.W. And out

        I saw "The Notebook" yesterday with Meghan B. It was so sad. I cried so much. Like in the part at the end when Ali remembers Noah again, but then forgets and starts freaking out. Then the doctor came in and had to sedate her and Noah started crying. That was so sad. Of course Meghan didn't cry at all so I felt dumb, but it was so sad. I told my mom the story( Of course I left out all the sexual tension parts) and she started crying. But on the other hand, Noah is SO HOT. And Ali, I totally didn't realize she was the mean girl in mean girls. It took meghan telling me that she was before I realized it. I am going to go get the book from the library and read it. I was going to read it before I saw the movie, but we got there and meghan wanted to see the notebook so we did.    P.S. I am sorry I always hit you in bball jess I hope you don't hate me for it. :(

      Yeah well camping wasn't awesome but it wasnt horrible either. I didnt meet the guy of my dreams but I did meet a horse named Harry. I suppose next time I should where Caitlins lotion and then Ill have guys from across the park wanting to do stuff for me. Harry was having a bad hair day. I went horseback riding with my family. My horses name was Harry. It was a lot of fun. Here is a description of our horse ride. We arrived during high noon at the rusted old stables to begin our great trail ride. First we made our way to the stablehand and paid with our worn money. We then donned our grimy lice infested helmets and waited to be assigned a great steed. I heard the thick voice of the ride leader say in my direction "You shall have Harry" She gestured to the horse and I graceful strode across the great beast. I then alighted upon it. The others were assigned their horses, yet none were as great as my faithful steed. I had just met the beautiful animal yet already we had a connection. We then set off on our wild adventure. We rode on a dusty trail, surrounded by slithering rattle snakes. It took all of our awesome horse skills to keep our horses from rearing and taking off at the site. Others lost control of their horses, but I, I had complete control. Under my steady guiding Harry never faltered. Not one step slipped, not one slithering serpent came close. We then made our way past the great rattlers on the dusty trail to a wind swept beach where we rode among the crashing waves. On our return journey we crossed a raging river with wet cobblestones beneath our horses hoofs. Yet still Harry never faltered. We then made our way under the eaves of the trees back to the ancient stables where I bade farewell to Harry the Horse and with tears in my eyes made my way to the world of technology and motorized steeds. Yeah well maybe it wasn't like that, but I did go to the beach, cross a stream and see a rattle snake right by my horse.
