        It's been 10 days and counting since I last had a taste of my current addiction. I'm not hooked on drugs or alcohol or even nicotine, no this girl has a taste for something far more sinister - something that digs its claws in and won't let go - something that sends you soaring like an Eddy Gordo Rio Special, eats you alive like Liu Kang's Dragon Fatality, slams you face first into the ground like Tina's Death Valley Bomb, and leaves you begging for more. I am a video game addict, there - I've said it - it's out - no turning back now.      When I left home I wasn't sure how long I'd be gone - family emergencies rarely come with a reservation or a schedule to follow - but I was confident that I could go without my game for a couple of days. I mean, I'd lived 26 years without City of Heroes - surely I could make it 3 days more. Two days in I was taking it like a champ, but as the days turned into weeks it all started to go south. Hands shaking, cold sweats, downloading inferior net games like Mah Jong and Solitare and trying to get my fix. Normally I would have brought a console with me - I have plenty to choose from - but my jumbled mind left them all behind and stranded me here, cold turkey, trying desperately to hold on a few days longer until I can return to my life of heroism in Paragon City. Somewhere out there is a mental institution with my name on it.      Reading : GameStar new fledgling zine with a great preview of the new Silent Hill and Half Life, 1492, Neil Gaiman's perfect comic series, and Lord of the Rings as a single book not a trilogy as it was meant to be. I decided I had to read it again before the third extended edition was released at Christmas.       Watching:  The Amazing Race, addictive and highly entertaining - really the only reality TV worth wasting your time or your brain cells on. I'm glad those brothers are gone, they gave not just our country but our species a bad name. Elephant, incredible and beautiful in it's simplicity. You want to know what your kids go through in the hell holes we call High School, it's all right there.       Playing:  City of Heroes, of course - community is the thing, find a good group of people with your style and enjoy the ride, Final Fantasy X-2 - I just want to get my 100% so I can feel like I've gotten my money's worth, and Animal Crossing - yes, I know it's a kids game but it's damn addictive, you try to start your town then put it down!       Listening:  Muse - Absolution, if you're ready to be angry about what's happening to your country, to your planet, to your world (and if you're not, then you haven't been paying attention) then this is the album for you.
