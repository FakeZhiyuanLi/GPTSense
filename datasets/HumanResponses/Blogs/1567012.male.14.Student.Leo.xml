       trial after trial.. i find maiself in a dead end.. no direction, no sense.. only feelings to guide me..  a road i chose to walk.. only to wish it brings me joy.. but no, brings me pain n sorrow.. too deep to turn back now..  i only wish along da road.. r lil drops of happiness i can hold on to.. to give me hope n will to keep goin.. until i reached my love .. u..  only to lift mai head n walk it proud.. walk, run, crawl if i hav to.. thru mud..snow..rain.. juss to get 2 u .. my love..  never kno if i reached u.. only to hope a sign will b bestowed upon me.. to tell me u r mai tru 1.. not another heartbreak or misguided infatuation..

       Gazing into darkness.. Alone in bed I cry.. I want so much to hold you.. To have you in my life..  I long to feel your presence.. To warm with your embrace.. If you could only see the smile.. That you put upon my face..  Unrequited maybe.. But it's oh so hard to say.. I need you in my arms, And I need you here today..  I love you oh so deeply.. How much, You just won't know.. For my feelings are deep inside me..  I can not let them go.. I struggle just to hide them.. In fear you may just find.. A glimmer of emotion… shining in my eyes..  So secretly I love you.. Until that sunny day.. When I can tell my feelings to you.. And maybe have my way..

       i'm bored..like always..  let's continue on da enormous topic of love..  how do guys develop their crushes..is it reallie true dat guys really try to mess round wit da grls dey likie, n make fun of them n make them feel uncomfortable...i find it true..i do dat sum times..i find it more in lil kids tho..but iono y i do it tho..i'm still kinda immature i gues..i still it shows tho..in lil ways..but some guys hide it so badly, n b shy..iono which is better but o wel...if u mess round wit da grl n make her uncomfortable..dusn't dat make her dun like u..den da guys is screwed...i dink i got screwed over by this several times...iono how grls develop crushes n show them tho.. da eziest way is to get it out of their mouths instead of rumors..  Wht do gfs n bfs do newaiz?..  i hav little to no experience in this..i had only one past relationship..n i dun really how to act as a bf..i noe dat couples should b their own best friends..n their close n..they know all to most of the things bout each other..they dun really need to spend every waking moment wit each other but, they should always hav a part of their mind on them..they spend a lot of time obviously..but they r juss close close friends..dat hav spesho privelges.rights..games..times..howevery u want to put it..  opions expressed on this blog doesn't not necessarily reflect upon michael himself..

       mind of a average hi skool guy*.*.*.  GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS..ahem..no we're not like dat..at least i'm not..girls isn't a major part of a guys mind..but a part of it, i would agree to dat..i dunno if grls welly dink dis or not but..NO..guys dun dink bout sex all da time..i would hafta say sum of da time..n no not like raping or shiet..w/e might b thrown in da convo..guys hav soft sides too..i kno i do..i guess guys juss hafta hold it inside..let's c..guys also crave affection from da opposite sex..guys dat r players..i dun no wut to say bout dem, or pimps..i'm not 1..  Love..y do ppl cheat..isn't da ponit of love is to find da person to spend with da rest of ur life..wut's da point then, if you noe dat it isn't love dun lead ppl on n juss stop right thur..  What is true love?...Does god really set up pairs before our lives actually start..?..can there b more then one true loves?...How do u noe wen u really love instead of a major infatutaion..?..Do love last 4eva?..Wut is da point of one night stands?..  True Love is wen u hav found da very person u spend with da rest of ur life, and u love him/her no matter what... I beleve we take our own paths in lifes..and we may never find our real true love, n never noe .. True Loves r one of the rarest things on earth, there might be more than 1..it's hard to noe if it is "da ONE"  You may never kno if u r willin to lay ur life down 4 ur other half, like in da movies, but life isnt a movie..r u willing to give up evrythin 4 sum1 else.. Love lasts 4 eva, dis is too controversial..i find dat it does..if it is da purest, most true..and love do last forever.. throuhg lifetimes n lifetimes..in ppl's memories..ppl member u as da loving couple... One night stands, is an escape..a sin to me since..no love is actually needed...4 pleasure..tsk tsk..  all i sed here is opinions of mine..plz dun yell at me if u disagree..  views and opions expressed on this blog does not neccessarily reflect upon Michael himself..

Just smile for me and let the day begin You are the sunlight that lights my heart within I'm sure that you're an angel in disguise Come take my hand and together we will rise On the wings of love up and above the clouds The only way to fly is on the wings of love On the wings of love only the two of us Together flying high Flying high upon the wings of love You look at me and I begin to melt Just like the snow when the ray of sun is felt I'm crazy bout ya baby can't you see I'd be so delighted if you could come with me On the wings of love up and above the clouds The only way to fly is on the wings of love On the wings of love only the two of us Together flying high Flying high up on the wings of love Yes you belong to me I'm yours exclusively Right now we live and breathe  Each other indispensable it seems, We're flowing like a stream Running free flowing on the wings of love On the wings of love up and above the clouds The only way to fly is on the wings of love On the wings of love only the two of us Together flying high Together flying high  On the wings of love up and above the clouds The only way to fly is on the wings of love On the wings of love  Only the two of us together flying high Together flying high Upon the wings of love

"Perfect Proposal"  This is for my baby..  will you marry me by your side ill be (pretty lady) Will you marry me (will you) by your side i'll be.  [refrain] I think it's time to be a host to my baby, i think it's time make a toast to my baby, i think it's time to just propose to my lady, will you marry me? [2x]  Your truly the best,a bless, the greatest girl i know, you made my life worth living, baby and it shows. I want to have you c loser to me, to feel happly home. i want to promise that i'll never leave you alone.  For one thing i'm really sure for you my love has no way? And nothing in this world can separate us, So until then  [refrain]  Not a day go by that I don't think of you. Sitting here contemplating will my dreams come true. No one is perfect in life, but you're so perfect for me. I can't describe how your love sets me free. My life won't be okay until you're by my side. Without you i'd be empty,so be my bride!  [refrain]  Will you marry me? By your side i'll be. Will you marry me? By your side i'll be!  For one thing i'm really sure for you my love has no way? And nothing in this world can separate us, So until then  [refrain]
