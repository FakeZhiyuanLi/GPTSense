      So begins day one of this blog, I'm not so sure if I am writing it for people to read or for myself to figure out my life.   The major crisis I have right now is that age old question---what do you want to do with your life??  If I had the answer for that, then I am more than sure a cure for cancer would soon follow.  I'm one of those people (I'm sure you all know one or two), who goes from job to job or even changes careers a couple of times because nothing really grabs them.  That's me!!  Not sure if I am proud of that fact or not?  I'm currently on career number 2, though I don't think I ever really used my first degree the way it was intended.  My dream was to work as a profiler for the FBI, so I got a degree in Psychology and Sociology (for the criminal classes).  Graduated with that in 1995, but the only way to really get to the FBI at that point was joining the police force and earning my way there.  That didn't mesh with the life I was leading at the time (ex-husband) and so I worked as a teacher's aide in a BD/LD classroom and with a night school program for about two years.  I really liked that, so I started back to school to become a BD teacher.  That didn't really pay the bills, so I went into being an insurance agent (let's just say that lasted about a year).  From there I went to work for a friend of the ex's family and then finally decided I really wanted to go back to school for computers.  So the summer of 1999, I headed back to school and started working toward another Bachelor's this time in CMIS (Computer Management and Information Systems).  I landed a co-op position to gain some experience and worked there for about a year, before I had to seek full-time employment.  That was 2000 and I was lucky enough to have several job offers and picked on at a "not for profit" organization.  Worked there about 6 months and got a call for a great paying job at the railroad, so I signed on there and worked until February of this year.  I only left because they were relocating out of the area.  So I started working here on the help desk and have been here since.  But, I'm really having trouble seeing myself resetting people's forgotten passwords at age 50 or 60.  So, I'm in search of a new career.   I'm really interested in helping people, so I'm kind of leaning toward the medical field, especially a nurse or respiratory therapist or even a sonogram person.  I would love to be giving sonograms to pregnant Mom's to be.  Of course, I should know plenty about sonograms, I've had TONS of them done over the years----one of my many medical problems.
