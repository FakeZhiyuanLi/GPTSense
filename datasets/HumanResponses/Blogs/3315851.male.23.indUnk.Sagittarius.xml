      This is just a brief post to comment on the revival of Family Guy and Futurama. Both of the short lived cartoon series have done so well on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, that the creators have reunited the voice actors and are in the process of filming new episodes. No news yet on when these will air but, if you were one of the millions who purchased the DVD box sets, then clear some room because more are on the way.

      Often in movies these days, the ability to kept the audience ooohing and aaahing with special effects or shock comedy overrides the directors ability to tell a deep and meaningful story. Tarantino's direction is masterful in confronting the audience with a drama so deep with sarcasms, hate, death, joy, and pain that special effects are hardly needed. In Kill Bill Vol 2, Tarantino continues this bloody saga where it left its vengeful heroin. Unlike many sequels, Vol 2 feels like a continuation of Vol 1, as opposed to a sequel. The word sequel insinuates, that we will hear an additional story about the characters from the original. In Vol. 2 the story has not ended, in a way, Tarantino makes us feel as if we had made a mistake in leaving the theatre after Vol. 1 was over. When the lights go down we see the Bride back with a determined and cold monologue abbreviating her gruesome actions in Vol. 1. and renewing her vow of retribution. Despite my want to go over every scene of the movie bit by bit, I will refrain and just give my overall impression. This movie lacked something in itself, as did Vol 1. However, the two movies combined tell a complete and beautiful story of love, betrayal, determination, vengeance, and return in the end to love where the circle becomes complete. The characters in this film have extraordinary depth and seem like people you might meet on the street, despite there very different lives. One of my favorite characters is Bud, the ex assassin now turned titty bar bouncer and brother of the elusive Bill. His anger at his brother and despise for everything about his own life give off a feeling I have never experienced with a movie character before. The actors roles in this movie, combined with excellent storytelling, and amazing music and visuals, make this my favorite movie of this year and rank it highly in my all time list of great films.

      In an article I read in my favorite magazine "Wired", middle school students in Santa Clarita, Ca and Yonkers, New York are being subjected to a training program called "What's the Diff? : A Guide to Digital Citizenship". In this program the students are required by the teachers and pawns from the RIAA to perform in role playing games which teach them about the alledged terrorism that is file sharing. By the end of this school year this program will have been ground into the brains of at least half a million students. The good news....According to many students in the program the ideal of the record companies have not become their own. Its good to know that free thought is still a freedom they can not take away.
