      Your Sex Sign is Cancer!You're a total pleaser.One sample of your touch, and anyone is hooked.You're so good that you've gotten people off just with your incredible kissing.You're a bit of a romantic, and you only have sex that's meaningful.Cancer, you are a born pleaser.Few people can resist your passionate, playful allure.An incurable romantic, you adore being courted.You'll do anything for a lover that sends you flowers or love tokens.You like lots of cuddling, touching, and kissing.You are a celebrated kisser.You also like to touch and fondle yourself.Typically, you learned to give yourself pleasure at a very young age.As an adult, you are easily aroused and multi-orgasmic.Mutual masturbation is very satisfying for you.You are extremely aware of your sexual attraction.You telegraph your sensuality with every move you make.You have the most communicative body language of any sign.You are very emotional, and you constantly need an emotional outlet.Frequent sex seems to calm you down.But you are old fashioned, and a quickie is not your style.You prefer long, slow seductions, erotic masasages, and lots of oral sex.

       woo hoo today I got to go to Oshawa with that sexy girl named Sarah!! We had a great time and I spent about $350!!!   Well its less than 2 weeks until camping. Should be interesting. I get to share a tent with a guy I have never met. He is friends with Sarahs man. She has described him to me, what he looks like and his personality.  I hope hes cute and doesn't smell lol.   Still no man in my life obviously.... I am not too sure if I even really WANT one right now. It would be nice. But I think I would perfer something casual though. I will be very busy in September once school starts back up and I'm working every weekend. Right now I think I would just perfer a little attention. Wether it be physical or verbal. It would be so nice. I get lonely every now and again.   I am really starting to hate this Zellers commecial   Good grief charlie brown!! Just stop calling me! I just got a phone call. I am not naming who. I am sick of people trying to make me feel bad! I am not your bloody pigeon. I do not sit at home just waiting for you to call. I have a life. Its not much right now but it's mine. I am working between 50 and 60 hours a week right now. barely getting a summer to myself. I'm so damn sorry if I haven't talked to you in a week or so.   Quickmill..... :) there is a cute boy working there ;) well 2.... But one I think is very cute and very nice.    I'm going to watch Kill Bill Vol 2.  LUV U!! thanks for reading.... I will write again soon  Peace
