      For a few brief hours last night, I went over to Matt's.  It was like 2:00 in the morning and neither of us could sleep, so Matt picked me up.  When I got in the car, Evan was with him.  I had forgotten that Ev is staying at his house for a few days.  Why?  Well, Evan (as I've mentioned before) is living with Rave.  Rave's in Arizona this week visiting some relatives.  His grandfather is really sick.  Typically Ev would have went with him (as they are inseparable...), but he couldn't get the time off work.  After Rave left, they decided they didn't really need him most of this week, so he could have went after all - which sucks.    As I've said before, Ev is a few years younger than most of us (Ev's 22, Rave is 26) and is prone to bouts of depression.  He has enough phobias and anxieties for our whole crew, including a horrible case of social anxiety disorder.  He's on meds for almost everything, but he's still not 100%.  His biggest phobia, however, is being alone.    He's okay if he's out by himself during the day, driving to work, etc., but if he's alone in the house, he goes insane.  Panic attacks, the whole nine yards.  I'm sure everything goes back to his shitty childhood, which is chock-full of  stories that would make you sick to your stomach.    I thought my anxiety problems/panic attacks were bad, but Ev makes me look like a lightweight.    Needless to say, we worry about him alot.   Rave is probably the best thing that ever happened to him - as a friend, a lover, and a protector. And vice-versa.  Ev keeps him grounded, saves him when he's about to make a fool of himself (er...Rave has quite a temper), and gives him a chance to show off that softer side that no one would otherwise see.  (And they've been friends since they were 6 and 10 years old.)  It sounds cheesy, but they really complete each other.    I know it sounds like Evan is very frail (and at times, I think he is), but he's honestly one of the toughest people I've ever met.  I'd have never survived what he's been through.  I have so much respect for that boy.     Well, I'm getting off track.  Anyway, Matt (being the wonderful soul that he is) asked Ev if he'd like to stay at his place for the week while Rave was away.  Evan greatfully accepted.  So instead of just the two of us (as I'd been hoping for), there were three.  It was actually a really nice night.  I don't know that I've ever been around Ev without Rave.  Not that he acts any differently, but it's kind of nice to have his  full  attention... ; )  As we sat there watching 'Cabin Fever' (which was horrible), we ended up talking for quite awhile about our families, work, our past love lives...  We dozed off on the couch, and I woke up with Ev's head on my shoulder.  He was awake - I smiled and stroked his hair gently.  "You okay?" I asked. "Yeah..."  He sat quietly for a minute, "I can't wait until he gets home." "I know..." "God, I wish I were normal.  I'm so pathetic." "No you're not." He laughed.  "You guys are so good to me..."  He smiled and snuggled into my shoulder and drifted back to sleep.  Evan.  What can I say?  I love him.

      I am a blogging fool today.  New toy - whoo!    I've been spring cleaning today.  While I was tossing things out left and right, I opened one of my old journals from 5 years ago (a.k.a. 'The Depression Journals).  What a horrible, shitty time in my life.  No one should ever have to experience depression, particularly at such a young age. I can still remember waking up each morning, feeling completely void of all emotion.  If you've never been through it, you can't even begin to understand the hell it is.  Wanting to die, but feeling so apathetic that even that doesn't matter to you.  Feeling - numb.  The pills worked great - but I always felt I was cheating myself.  Laughing, smiling - none of it genuine.   I cried for a long time this afternoon, all of those feelings flooding over me relentlessly.  It's a sickness.  And it's so big, so frightening, that I feel very helpless against it.    Of course, things went well for me.  I was only on medication for about a year, and I'm off it now completely.  I get depressed from time to time, but nothing even compares to before.  It was a long, bumpy ride - withdrawal was the worst.  I'd get these hot/cold spells, flashes of light, extreme dizziness, and this sound and feeling like an electric jolt in my head.  It truly is far more serious than most people think.  I remember the first few months afterward - I actually felt a bit sad that I wasn't depressed.  I know it sounds sick - but for so long, my sadness was all I had - and then that had left me.  Eventually I was able to fill that dark space with other (happier) things, but for a long time I actually missed it.  Sounds crazy now, but it's true.  I read an article way back then about the effects of aspartame (at the time, I probably drank 5-6 aspartame drinks a day), and how it causes depression (amongst other scary things - most of which I had).  I stopped drinking/eating it immediately.  It was only a month or so later when I was feeling fairly good.  And it wasn't much longer until my doctor felt I was good enough to decrease my dosage, then eventually ween off of it.  I'm not saying it's a cure, but if you're drinking/eating it - just think about it.  I mean, it causes holes to form in the brains of rats, for god's sake (Not that I advocate animal testing).  Keep a positive outlook - you can get better.  You will.  I'm proof.

         Friends.  Can’t live without ‘em.  Since this is my first day with my new blogger, I felt I should introduce you to some of the people you’ll hear about.  Even though they’re a huge part of my life, I’ll rarely mention my family.  I don’t want to air out dirty laundry or offend anyone.  Besides, they probably don’t want to hear a lot  of what I write about.  ; )  I have so many stories about my friends, that I think they need introduced. So, I’ll start with 'Crew 1':  Dave, Evan, Raven, Chris, and Matt.  Yeah, all of my best friends are pretty much guys.  It’s weird, I know.    Of all my friends, I think I’ve known Dave the longest.  I was infatuated with him when we first met, now we’re just good friends.  Dave’s a computer whiz by day, party animal by night.  He’s just a lot of fun, completely non-committal, and always trying to get (boring, anxiety-prone) me to live life.  He lives with no regrets.  At times, I wish I could be more like him.  I’ve known Raven almost as long as Dave.  Raven (a.k.a. Rave/Raver) is actually ‘Paul’, however, due to his black hair, we’ve always called him Raven.  He’s very openly bisexual.  Other than that, Rave is much like myself – politically active, an animal lover (vegan), artistic, kind of a stay-at-home type… He’s very sweet, but he doesn’t show that side of himself to many people.    Evan (a.k.a. ‘Ev’), is the sweetest boy alive.  He’s a few years younger than the rest of us.  He’s very shy, has some anxiety/self-esteem issues - probably due to a crappy childhood.  He’s just the kind of frail boy you want to protect (though he clearly needs no protecting).  Also much like Rave and I, he’s pretty political, artsy, an animal rights person.  He grew up next door to Rave, and their parents were good friends.  They grew up together, and of course became the best of friends – inseparable, even.  Then one night, Rave got him drunk… They’re dating now, and still inseparable.  His parents aren't cool with it, and they've pretty much disowned him.  He's living with Rave now.  They're quite possibly the most saccharinely sweet couple I’ve ever seen.   They even finish each other's sentences.  I wish you could hear them tell the story of those first few days after it happened.  Too funny.  I may attempt to tell it one day.  You’ll see that I love to re-tell conversations.    Chris – oh geez, what do I say about Chris?  Another friend of Dave's.  I met him about the same time I met Matt.  He’s insane.  He had this crazy black shaggy ‘rock-star’ hair, and the ‘rock-star’ clothing/looks to match.  He does freelance graphic design, and DJs on the weekend at a club in NYC (and sometimes other clubs in Toronto, Pittsburgh, etc.).  He’s also openly bisexual, cocky, sexy, and just… oh, so bad.  You can imagine the stories I have to tell about these guys - So if you're easily offended or prudish, you probably shouldn’t continue to read my blog.  ; )     urlLink Matt .  (See previous post).  I love him to death.  I love how his black shaggy hair falls into his sparkling green eyes.  I love how he holds me.  And as Evan once so sweetly remarked, “His head fits very nicely in the crook of my neck.”  I’m going to stop before I get too gooshy on you, but you get the idea.    So there it is.  My main group of friends - Plenty of stories about them in the days to come.    And then there’s me.  So who the hell am I?  Just a 25 year-old girl trying to figure out just that – who I am.  Confident on the outside, confused and insecure on the inside.  I don’t know my direction in life - Still.  Is anyone else out there in the same boat?  Because I often feel very alone in this.   I feel trapped in that middle-ground - Too old/too young.  Too old to just keep hanging out with my friends at concerts and spending all of my excess money on CDs.  (And at the same time, that’s what I live for.)  I feel too young to be stuck in my dead-end job, but since I get paid fairly well, get vacation/sick/personal time, full medical insurance, etc., I don’t think I’ll find another job comparable.  Silly, I know.  My dream is to just write or sell my art.  Maybe do something dealing with music promotion.  I just need to figure out a game plan.  If I could, I’d quit my job and do charity work for the rest of my life – but of course, that’s not practical.  I’m not good with ‘new things’.  It’s a strange phobia I have - add it to the list!  Oh well.  Enough of my insecurities!  I’m sure you’ll hear more about them later.    Welcome to my life and my circle of friends.  Hope you stick with me.

      Here's something I don't talk about much - my love life. (Or, more often than not, my lack of.)  Why?  Why can't I be like normal people who allow their feelings to be known? Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold-hearted bitch or anything.   I just have to put up a facade for everyone to see because I hate letting my weaknesses show.    And Matt is just that: My weakness.  One of many vices, but the strongest one of all.  Who is Matt, and how did it happen?  Let me start from the beginning.  We met through a mutual friend, Dave.  Dave and Matt have known each other about as long as I've known Dave. (With me so far?)  All these years we'd heard stories about each other, but we hadn't met until a year ago.  I also have a friend (Chris), who's been trying to hook Matt and I up since we met.    In the first few months after I met him, we hung out a bit, but mostly with our other friends.  We never really had much 'alone time', but it was cool because Matt was the big-brother, faithful-friend-for-life type.  He's the guy that was most comforting to me when I'd had a bad day:  He, Dave, and Chris would  'kidnap' me in the middle of the night and we’d go to Matt’s place.   We’d curl up on the couch to talk or watch movies, and he’d stroke my hair until we fell asleep.  Or he'd make me some (vegetarian) 'chicken' soup when I had a cold.  I never questioned it, I just thought he was exceptionally sweet.  But then… Something suddenly changed.  I can’t pinpoint when, but it changed.   My grandfather passed away almost two weeks ago.  (Which sucks, because my grandfather was really the backbone of our close-knit family).  Anyway, even though he said he didn’t think he could do it (because HIS grandfather had just passed away two weeks prior – they were really close), Matt showed up at the funeral home.  He got as far as the door before I rushed over to hug him.  He said he didn’t think he could actually go INSIDE (which was fine, I understood), but he stood outside with me and talked and held me.  Maybe it doesn’t seem like much, but I know how hard it was for him – and it really meant a lot to me.    Now every chance I get, I meet him for coffee or lunch.  I even occasionally blow off a day of work to hang out with him on his day off (admittedly, I do it a bit too often).  We’re not really a couple or anything because we’re both commitment-phobic, but our friends say we might as well be.  I know it sounds silly, but he makes me absolutely giddy.  Maybe nothing will come of it - It's really tough getting past that 'best friend' stage.  We're both open to whatever happens.  Hell, he's probably reading this and running the other way. ; )  You'll be hearing more about Matt in the days to come.  I just thought I'd give you some background.

      I write non-stop.  At the end of the day, I find myself going up to my bedroom, journal in hand.  Far too often, I waste my time filling my blank books with thoughts, dreams, and the day's events.  I've written music reviews, poetry, general fiction, and (er...maybe just a little) slash.  I've entered essay contests.  I had a few short stories published.  My poems have been printed alongside everyone else in the free world who enters those shitty poetry contests.    But for some odd reason... I don't want a lot of people to read what I've written.  Even when I feel that it's particularly good, I don't want to share it with anyone I know.  There's a few exceptions - a few close friends, perfect strangers.  I really hope my family never stumbles across my writing (and this blog) - is that weird?  I'm a very secretive person, and I like it that way.    There's a whole other world inside of me.  There are so many sides that no one will ever know.  Except you.  Is anyone reading this?  Am I insane?

      I’ve been thinking about a good friend all day.  He’s somehow managed to keep me up talking most of the night again.  Yeah, I’m tired.  (But happy.)  He just makes me smile.  ‘Story Hour’ at the library is hell. It leaves us short-staffed, and twice as busy.  Horribly rough day today.  *yawn*  I’m going to a show tonight with my brother.  It’s at this place where most of the people who go are like 21 years old, tops.  I always feel old when I go there, but not enough to really care.  I’m not gonna’ let that interfere with my fun.  Besides, people always think I’m younger than I actually am anyway.   Had a message on my phone from Evan this morning.  (One of the few times my cell phone actually rings... lol) Sounds like they’re having a great time in Florida.  (Though he feels a little silly for making such a big deal out of it.)    That’s it.  Just felt like checking in.

      *snip*  So, you’re married now.  Sorry I didn’t make it to the reception, as you know my grandfather passed away that day. I still think it’s weird that you married the first girl you had a serious relationship with.  You didn’t even date very long before you decided.  The whole thing just strikes me as odd.    *snip*   I have to be honest.  I don’t like her.  At all.  She’s never been nice to me or any of your friends.  And she’s certainly not willing to share you.  Even when I try to be nice to her, I feel like she’s looking down her nose at me.  *snip*   Remember all the stupid stuff you used to do with your friends?  I’d just laugh hysterically as you guys tied a rope to a tree and swung like Tarzan.  Or  when you’d climb up on the roof and then  *name omitted* would be too scared to jump down?    Or when we'd take turns seeing who could vault over the porch higher?  *Name omitted* always won.  When you first started seeing her, she used to yell at us, “Stop doing that!” and “You’re so immature!”  And heaven forbid we made any noise - it would trigger her 'headaches'.  I guess that’s when we started to hate her.  *snip*   I miss the times when we used to hang out.  Seems you’ve been way too busy since you met her to even talk to me and your other friends.  I think the last time I saw you was at Warped Tour last summer.  August, maybe?  Maybe I’ve seen you since, I don’t know.  But if I did, you didn’t really talk to me.  I feel like she runs your life.   And it’s not just me.  Your ‘best friends’ think it’s bullshit, too.  You’re ‘not allowed’ to do anything she doesn’t like.    You’re ‘not allowed’ to just hang out with us, or go to a show, or just rent shitty vampire movies and talk.  Seems your entire life has now been consumed by her.  Awhile ago, you didn’t seem too happy about the whole situation.  But you still got married.  I have a feeling you think you settled.    *snip*  I don’t really care, but *name omitted* has cut you off completely.  He says he doesn’t give a shit about you any more.  Friends don't just ditch each other during the tough spots of their lives.  I think he misses you. But he’s moved on.  The only good thing about all of this is that I’ve become better friends with him.  Still, we have occasional marathon bitch-sessions about you - and about your brother, who now seems to be following in your footsteps (ditching his friends for the first girl who comes along...)   *snip* You insert yourself in our lives when it’s convenient for you, and just enough so that you can feel good about yourself.    *snip*  Don’t feel bad about it.  It’s cool.  I’ll see you occasionally - we’re still family, after all.  (Not that you even visit for holidays anymore.  You always have to visit her family...)  I'm oddly okay with it.  *snip*  We’ve moved on, but out crew has thinned out a bit.  We don’t see *name omitted* much anymore either now.  It’s just funny for how close we all were.  'Wolfpack', for god’s sake.  Remember how H2O’s ‘Family Tree’ was our song?  “My friends look out for me like family...!”   We truly believed that, stupid fucks.    *snip*  It just seems the light has gone from your eyes – that crazy look you’d get when we were all about to do something really stupid.  You just seem… sad.  But I can’t feel sorry for you, when you’ve burned all your bridges.  We still try to get you to come to shows with us occasionally (via e-mail, since you’re so busy).  You always have an excuse.  “I can’t *name omitted*’s parents want us to come over” or “I have to work”.  I know you have responsibilities now, but you have vacation time.  One day away from work (and her) wouldn’t kill you.  Anyway, I hope you’re happy.  I truly do.  I’m not saying it to be mean or sarcastic this time... I just hope she’s taken up enough space in your life to make up for the four people you left behind.

      There is a mosquito in my office that I can’t seem to find.  He’s bit the inside of my ankles, my arm, my neck… Grrr…  Had *quite* an interesting night last night. ;)   But I’m not gonna tell you about it.  Still, I’m feeling kind of lethargic today.  I’m not really sure why.    Evan and Rave left for Florida last night.  Evan threw up five times (out of nervousness) from his house to the airport, poor boy.  I didn’t get to see them off, as they left late.    However, I had a message on my phone this morning that they had arrived safely.  Ev took his tranquilizer and slept curled up to Rave most of the flight.  He seems to be doing okay now that they’re settled into their very posh hotel.    They crack me up.  I don’t know how they ever got together, but I’m glad they did.  Evan always laughs and talks about how he always imagined growing up: marrying some pretty girl, having a bunch of kids… And none of that really matters now.  Raven was the type that would ‘never settle down’ for anything, and he’s so incredibly whipped  - it’s hilarious.  All Ev would have to do is bat his eyelashes, and the world would be at his feet (Not that he would, but…).  Of course, they’re still both into girls, but they have a ‘no other men’ policy.  And their close  (mutual) guy friends are void of (most) policies so long as the other party is in the room… I know, I know.  What?!  Guys are so messed up.  lol  I’m sorry I don’t have anything interesting to say as of late.  I feel tired, mostly.  Not physically-sleepy-tired, but more like mentally-exhausted-tired.  I have an earful of political rambling in my head, but it’s too mind-numbing to drag out right now.  I just was thinking about when I was little and I walked down to the creek by my old house...  Not sure why, but that image just popped into my head.  I want to flop on some water shoes, and drag a good friend through that creek, hand-in-hand.  Jumping from rock to rock, trying not to get wet, then falling in anyway.  Catching minnows, building tiny houses from those flat shale rocks…*sigh*   Nostalgia gets me every once in awhile… and it makes me smile.    I need to take more time out to do those silly things.

      I know we've all heard that urban legend (or is it?) about how men think about sex every 20 seconds or some such nonsense...  But this guy has taken it to a new level.  Ummm...

      I'm at work right now, kinda pissed off.  There's literally 2 clerks here today.  That makes for a hellish day on the two of us - on a typical day we need 4 clerks working at the same time.  I might just snap and punch someone in the face today.  lol  Okay, not really.  But it's quite a lot of stress when you're short-staffed and dealing with the public all day. (Not to mention, I have my own secretarial work to do...)  The worst thing is, the director knew about it a week ago but she didn't care because she's not here to deal with it today.    lol.  Enough whining!  I just cut three paragraphs of complaining.  Heh.  I get a little carried away sometimes.    My dad has another doctor appointment on Monday.  I don't think I've mentioned it, but he's been off work since... October?... with some mysterious ailment.  He's been seeing several doctors, neurologists, etc., and no one can seem to figure out what's wrong with him.  It's been 8 months now, and no results.  It's kinda scary, and I worry about it a lot.  I kinda just wish they'd just find  something  so that it can be treated and dealt with.    He sits around most of the day (because he can't stand or walk very much) and plays 'GTA Vice City' on the PS2.  lol.  I guess the constant onslaught of 'kiling' is his therapy.  "Gotta' go do some killing!", he chimes happily.   It cracks me up, but I know it drives him insane.  His short term disability ran out last month (and he can't claim a full disability until he's diagnosed and off at least another 6 months), so things are really tight around here.  I'm trying to help out as much as I can, but it just doesn't seem to be enough.    I know, nothing good to say today.  I'm actually in a pretty good mood, I swear.  I'm probably just rambling, because I was up a little too late talking to a good friend.  I get a little silly when I'm tired... one of those nights where you really don't want to go, but you have to sleep eventually.  lol.  I was in a very good mood when I went to sleep last night, disregard my previous blog. ;)  I want one of those blogs where it asks what music you're listening to.  I think you can tell a lot about a person's mood by what they're listening to.  (And a lot about a person in general.)    For example, right now I'm listening to Robin Black and the Intergalactic Rock Stars.  (So it's incredibly cheesy... It never fails to put me in a really good mood.)  A little glam rock is a good thing (or maybe I've just seen Velvet Goldmine a few too many times. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. Mmm...).  Anyway, Robin Black - it's my favorite 'home-alone-screaming-along-and-dancing-in-the-shower' CD *blush* But let's just keep that our little secret, ok?  I'm all out.    Robin Black and the IRS - 'More Effeminate Than You'   "Well I know you love me Or so it would seem But i've never been a king I've always been a queen  And you say you love me And that you'll be true But how can you love someone who's more effeminate than you?  I never played soldier I never played ball...  I'm one of those boys Who played with girls toys..." - Gaah!  ;)

      I'm freezing.  It's been pretty cold at night here lately.  Fahrenheit 9/11 was sold out at the only theater that it was playing in (within 50 miles of me) today.  I'm bummed.  Oh well.    I'm feeling very lonely tonight.  It's kinda weird, I guess.  I need someone to cuddle up to and fall asleep with.  *sigh*  It's a weird lonely/angry feeling.  Angry because I always manage to fuck up any chance of happiness I get.  I get scared when I get too close to someone and I run away.  I hate it - why do I do that?  I have this really horrible fear of being vulnerable or seeming weak - probably because I  feel  vulnerable and painfully shy - and I try really hard to hide it.    I'm not really that pissed off I guess, just pensive tonight.    So, instead of going out or something this is what I do on a Friday night:  Whine.  Blog.  Eat Uncle Ben's Broccoli Cheese Soup at midnight.  Really living the good life, huh?    Chris, Matt, and Dave are at some club in Toronto tonight(and NYC tomorrow)where Chris is DJing.  I'm sure they're getting drunk, stupid, and laid about now.  (Well, not Matt because he's shy and a good boy...) I often feel I just don't fit in with their crazy rock-star lifestyle.  I don't drink.  I'm not big on bars or clubs.  I don't really like to dance.  And I'm not getting laid (which Dave tells me all too much, and quite frankly I'm starting to agree with him).  lol.      *sigh*

      Evan is panic-stricken over his upcoming vacation.  They leave on Sunday, and he's kicked, screamed, and cried his way through the week, and has even flat-out told me he doesn't want to go.  ...  He's going if Rave and I have to bound and gag him.    Rave and I talked about it a little last night.  He really wanted this trip to be a fun experience for Ev, but now he's doubting why he booked the trip in the first place.  He feels really awful for putting Ev through this agony - he thought about cancelling the trip and everything.  (Ehh.. I hope Ev isn't reading this...lol.)  I know, it probably sounds ridiculous to the average person.  I understand, because I get panic attacks and have a million anxieties, too... but personally I can't imagine  not  wanting to go on vacation...   So I dragged him out of the house today to help him shop for his trip.  We went shopping for sunglasses, sunblock, swim trunks... With each purchase, he just grew more and more anxious.    We just lay around afterwards, he had a panic attack and I let him cry on my shoulder until he fell asleep.    *sigh*  I don't know what to do with him - He's going to have a great time once he gets there.  And this will really be a good thing for him, but he's making himself completely miserable over it.  I'm so torn, my heart is absolutely aching...

      Do you ever think about the people around you?  You know, what they do, who they really are?  I do.  Sometimes I want to get into someone’s mind to see how they think.  I read this article today, and I remembered all the crazy people I’ve met along the way while working at the library.   urlLink War Vet Defaces Library Books   We have a guy at our library who goes to our book sale, buys anything with excess amounts of sex or violence, then tears them up in front of us.  He says he doesn't want anyone to read such 'trash'.   We also have this guy who believed he was god.  He took a bible and desecrated it, scrawling things about sin and hell… We caught him destroying it, and charged him for the book.  He got pissed, and we didn’t see him for a long time.  Now he comes in all the time, completely pleasant and normal.  Weird.    There was this woman who used to come in here who was always really bizarre.  She just acted really skittish, and was really short-tempered.  She’d get really angry if we didn’t have a book she wanted… I heard that she went to prison a few years ago for killing a guy with a dryer door.  Yes, a dryer door.    I remember another guy who came in all the time preaching his right-wing propaganda.  He was charming -  in a Charlie Manson kinda’ way.  Everyone else ignored him, I just politely nodded and humored him.  A few years ago, he was arrested for hitting someone with his car because they ‘were in his way’ at a construction site.  They declared him legally insane.  Glad I never got in his way.  There’s one guy who scares the daylights out of me.  He’s something like 6’6” and big.  I guess he’s partially retarded and extremely violent.  No matter what you say to him, he twists it around so that you’re insulting him.  He’s very loud and obnoxious.  I'm scared shitless when he comes in, because he's obviously not very stable.    Not all of the crazies are scary.  There’s one woman who comes in here who is harmless…  She wears winter coats in the summer.  Sometimes she forgets to wear shoes.  She smells like horrific b.o. all the time… You can literally tell when she walks into the building from all the way down the hall… Story is she was really beautiful and intelligent ages ago, but got into drugs heavily.  Now she’s perpetually spaced out and schizophrenic –  she comes to the desk … She’ll stare at you for sometimes 5 to 10 minutes.  And it’s really creepy, because you can talk to her and she doesn’t hear.  It’s like she’s staring right through you.  Sometimes she almost has it together, other times you hear her talking and laughing with the voices in her head.  It’s sad, really.    You wouldn’t think a library could be so exciting...

      1.  Vanity plates on cars.    I saw two today, and I just wanted to yell, "What the hell does that mean!?"  They didn't make sense.  What's worse are those airbrushed 'so-and-so hearts so-and-so' or 'Joe's Ride' plates. Bleh.  2.  'Bob' and his wife from the Enzyte commercial.    I don't want to hear about your 'natural male enhancement'.  If I was interested in such things, I'd just open one of my millions of e-mails I receive every day.  'Gain 2-4 inches guaranteed!'  3.   Christian Rock Bands.    I'm sorry.  I'm not highly religious.  (Though I'm fairly agnostic, I'm more interested in Zen Buddhism.)  I wouldn't care if they'd stay out of the mainstream and on the Christian charts.  All too often, I've gone to a local show and have gotten stuck sitting through Christian rock bands while waiting around for the one band I want to see.  While I admire their faith, I can't listen to a million songs all about the same thing.  But I wouldn't listen to an entire album about toast, either.  Don't get me wrong.  I have nothing against Christianity.  I think that whatever gets you through life is a great thing (well, within reason).  But the Christian rock gets old fast for me, no matter how horrible that sounds.  "You're not making Christianity any better, you're just making rock music worse!" - Hank Hill  4.   People Who Mock My Vegetarianism.    I don't hassle you when you eat meat, don't hassle me when I don't.  I don't even touch it.  I know that's silly - but I wouldn't touch a dead carcass on the road, either.  Same principle, right?  Also, I hate when I tell people I'm a vegetarian and they say "Oh.  Well you still eat fish and chicken, right?"  Umm.  No.     Enough hatred!  Let's see.  Here's some weird things I like:    Pirates. Chocolate Soy Milk. The Chicago Cubs.  I can't help it.  They're loveable losers. Converse Shoes.  Particularly the older ones, from when they were still made in the USA.  I have a funky pair of Chucks extra-high tops from the 80s. The tv show 'Queer as Folk'.  I don't watch much tv, but I'm a serious 'QAF' addict. Retro 'Space Age' Furniture.  Is anyone else obsessed with 50s-60s furniture?  I didn't think so.

      Migraines suck.  I don't get them very often anymore, but I left work early today because of one.  Gee, couldn't be stress-related or anything, could it?  The nice thing is that my boss actually tried to get someone to fill in for me for an hour and a half... by the time she found someone, my Imitrex had kicked in.  I didn't have the heart to tell her, so I thanked her and left anyway.  So, what started out as a crappy day turned out okay after all.  ;)  Went to Evan and Rave's to help Ev pack for his trip.  (Today was his day off, and Rave was at work.)  He's a nervous wreck... he's going to forget something, he's terrified of flying, what if he has a bad asthma attack, etc.  Ev, I refuse to let your neurosis keep you from going!  After packing, we fell asleep watching TV.  I know, we're such party animals.  I guess the past few weeks of little sleep finally caught up with me.  I don't think I've ever taken a nap...   Oh well.  Good times.

      I'm going to sound like an insensitive prick here...   but when can we raise the flags again?  Reagan died on June 5th.  The funeral was over a week ago.  I don't mean to sound rude... but let it rest.    Morrissey is a bit of a god to me.  As shocked as I was, I couldn't help but giggle a bit when I read this.   urlLink Singer Morrissey Sparks Outrage    Of course, I get off on telling people it's at half-mast because I'm mourning our current president...

      Whenever someone asks what I do for a living, they're surprised.  I work in a library – Another piece of my anonymity, gone.  *sigh*  By the end of the year, you’ll know me inside out… Librarians aren't old women in long skirts, glasses, and hair pulled into a bun anymore.  (They might be a 20-something girl in a homemade pink Rancid t-shirt…)  If there's one thing I've learned in this life, it's not to judge a book by it's cover.  (No library puns intended.)  Some of the most amazing people in this world are sometimes the unexpected.  And sometimes we just need to dig a little deeper to find people.    *yawn*  I was up way too late talking to one such ray of ‘sunshine’.  But I’m glad I was.   Speaking of sunshine – what a segue! - Evan left a message on my cell phone very late last night.  He and Rave are going to Florida next week - quite a surprise, last-minute trip.  (Wish I could leave on a second’s notice!)  Ev’s pretty much never left the state, so I’m very excited for him.  He needs to get out more.  I hope they have a great time - just stay away from the spring break whores, kids…    I’m going to see Fahrenheit 9/11 on Friday (opening night) with a friend, my brother, and my cousin.  We’re hoping there’ll be protesters – I could use a good debate.  I only worry because I’m taking my brother.  Smart kid, he really knows what he’s talking about… but he tends to get angry and foul-mouthed when debating.   Heh.   I don’t know how it’s going to go, but I hope the movie at least inspires people to check this stuff out on their own.    It would be nice to find someone who actually knows what they’re talking about to debate with.  It’s funny because usually I’m so shy… but debate brings out the vocal side of me.  I’ve got nothing to talk about… I’m pretty boring lately.

      I haven't been eating much lately.  It's kind of weird.  I've had this anxious feeling in my stomach for about a week, and I'm just not really hungry.  I'm not sleeping well either.  There's an overwhelming restlessness that's been consuming me.    I was telling my friend Dave about it, and he gave me the old mocking, "Are you in looovvee?"  No.  "Then you probably just need to get laid."  *Sigh*  Bastard.  At least he makes me laugh.  I don't know why I'm so restless lately.  I need a vacation, that's for sure.  But not just away from work - I need to get  out  of this place for awhile.    I live in one of those small towns where everyone knows everyone (because most of them are related)...  Everyone knows your business at all times, they all have police scanners and CB radios so they can keep up with the latest gossip.  (Whereas, I could give a shit what everyone else does.)  "Didja hear about Smitty?  Got pulled over for speeding the other night!"  It's like high school, but worse.  Luckily I'm a fairly law-abiding citizen, so they've got nothing on me.    I did get pulled over once for no apparent reason.  My brother and I were coming back from Wal-Mart, of all places, around 10:00 at night... This guy behind me had his highbeams on, and he was practically riding my bumper.  I was so mad...  I glanced up as a light started flashing.  Good, it was a cop.  (What a prick!)  His reasoning for pulling me over: 'I clipped a center line in the road'.    I politely appologized, though I wanted to scream obsenities at him.  "Why were you riding my ass with your brights on?!!"  There's a bunch of punk stickers on the back of my crappy car, and my brother insists it was a case of 'Punk Driving'.  Yeah, I think maybe we were 'profiled'...  Well that was way off topic.  Does this blog have a point today?  No.  But it's slightly better than the pile of invoices sitting on my desk...

      This song's been in my head for three days...  Rancid - 11th Hour  Hey little sister do you know what time it was When you finally seen all your broken dreams Come crashing down your door? They demand an answer and they demand it quick Or the questions fade and the wasted days Come crawling back for more  Do you know where the power lies?  And who pulls the strings? Do you know where the power lies? It starts and ends with you.  The face of isolation Well that's one you recognize Well you can't get straight It's a lonely place and It's one you do despise  Boredom is for sale now And helplessness you feel It's a wounded dove and the hawks are above Blood splattered on a reel to reel  Do you know where the power lies?  And who pulls the strings? Do you know where the power lies? It starts and ends with you.  I was almost over - my world was almost gone in a sudden rush I could almost touch  the things that I'd done wrong my jungle's made of concrete through silence I could feel my aim is true I will walk on through  Do you know where the power lies?  And who pulls the strings? Do you know where the power lies? It starts and ends with you.

      This could get bad, so proceed with caution...  I'm single (yeah, imagine that...), and I am so freakin' tired of the whole dating scene.  I either get hit on by 45-year olds or 18-year olds.  There's no middle ground.  I was helping this guy at a computer today, and he was like "Hey, brains  and  beauty... Are you seeing anyone?"  I politely smiled and said yes.  Of course, I wanted to say something like, "No.  And you're old enough to be my father, you creepy bastard."    Dating.  How bad does that suck?  Ehhh.  You know what I hate?  When people say, "I have this friend that would be perfect for you!"  Don't try to hook me up, okay?!   I'm okay with being single.  I  like  not having to answer to anyone.  Sure I get lonely, but I think I'm truly better off on my own-  for now.      Quite frankly, I'm a commitment-phobe.  It's true.  When people get too close to me, I get weirded out then run away.  I hate it - It's awful.  I don't mean to be like that.  I just don't know what happens.   There's a few exceptions, I guess.  Evan knows me better than anyone - somehow he knows just about every deep dark secret I have.  He knows my obsessions, my fears.  He knows how to console me, and what I need at all times.  He's incredible. I couldn't be happier for him and Rave.  (I have to admit, we've fooled around on more than one occasion.   Which would typically be weird, messing around with your best friend, right?   For some reason, it's not.  Even stranger, Rave knows and encourages it.  LOL.)  I know, I know.  That sounds  so  horrible, doesn't it?    Evan is probably the only guy who's never let me down.    I'm not going to get into too much detail or anything, but I guess my view of sex is a little different.  I crave the emotional side of it all (*hold me*), whereas every guy in the world is into the instant-gratification side.  The actual act itself doesn't quite do it for me.  Most of my friends from high school are married and/or have kids already.  I cringe at the thought of it.  I can't imagine being stuck in that whole responsibility - mortgage/kids/soccer practice.  Gaah!     *Sigh*

      I was just thinking about a conversation I had with someone the other night, and I'm feeling kind of weird about it...  I'm really close to my family, but sometimes I feel like they don't know me at all.  For example, if any of them should ever read this blog (and hopefully not), they'll probably have no idea it's mine.  Which is good, because I don't want them to be  that  involved in my life.  It's like we keep the conversations on the surface at all times.  There's no discussing of feelings or emotions.  They don't really know my friends...They don't know that I leave my house sometimes at 2:00 in the morning.  And it's not that they don't care.  I just... I don't know.  I'm a really secretive person.  It's like I sneak around them, and I don't know why.  And they're great parents, really.  My friends just laugh.  It makes me feel kind of shitty, though.    On the other hand, I open myself up to strangers completely.  (Probably not the safest of habits...)  What's that about?  My problem is that I've read too many psychology books, and I still don't understand what goes on in my head sometimes.  The human mind is a fascinating thing...  Does anyone even read this anymore? - because I had this thought...  Who reads this blog (besides Evan)?  Comment now, please!

      83.2° in my sweltering office.  Yuck.  The air  never  works in my office.  It's stuffy, and it just makes me sleepy and irritable (and obviously unable to focus on my work).    We're in the midst of (yet another) huge thunderstorm right now.  We lost power for a minute, so I had to reset 20 computers by myself (because we're short-staffed today), and then it flickered again so I had to re-do it all.  I also lost the (roughly) $2000 order that I was working on.  Gone from my shopping cart completely.  *Sigh*    Gaah!  It just flickered again.  I wish we'd just lose power already - if it's out for awhile, I get to go home.  Might as well - the morning has obviously been a waste of time.  Pretty intense storm - downpour, lightning like crazy.  We've had them 3 days in a row. Flash flood warnings in effect - which means every backroad and minor highway around me will be flooded over, leaving me with only the interstate.  (Ah, the joys of living in the county!)  I hate driving the interstate.  I can't drive it without at least one panic attack.  I should probably get back on meds for that since it's starting to run my life again, but I dread it.  I feel more neurotic with them than without.  And I hate doctors.  *shudder*  I went outside my back door a few minutes ago to watch the lightning (much to the dismay of my co-workers), got soaked, then turned my fan on.  Aahh.  Gotta beat the heat somehow.    Instead of going anywhere, I decided to go to sleep early last night.  I woke up this morning feeling even crappier than when I go to bed late.  I can't win.    I hate that alarm clock.  Just... ten... more... minutes...!  I just heard on the radio that we've gotten 3 inches of rain in the last 45 minutes, and a lot of the local roads are already at least a foot deep with water.  Great.  Alright already!  Let's lose power!

      (Random thought... why do I put a period after every 'title'?  Clearly not necessary.  Oh well.)  I've been in a pensive mood today, and I've been thinking about how much I take for granted.    Today was my day off, so I hung out with my brother.  We went to lunch, then shopped a bit. I (once again) bought two CDs - this 2 a week habit has to stop!  At least they were used.  Anyway, as we were sitting there eating, he said, "You know what's weird?  My friend Courtney would never go to lunch with her brother.  They're not close at all."  Huh.  We've always been pretty close.  He's my music buddy - we go to local shows and concerts together, and pretty much hang out whenever we can.    So I've been thinking of all the other things that I take for granted -a few months ago, my neighbor's house caught on fire.  When we found out, pretty much the whole neighborhood pulled together to help out, found her a place to stay, etc.  Until that day, we had never talked to her.  Nice lady.    Then I started thinking about this older gentleman who used to come into the place where I work every morning.  He was a nice enough guy, but we never said more than 'Good Morning, How are you?' 'Fine, yourself?'  Then one day he quit coming in.  A few weeks later, I found out he was very sick and had passed away.  I never got to know much about him.  Well, that's depressing.  Sorry.  I just have a lot of stuff floating around in my head right now, and I'm hoping this will help.  Totally unrelated thought: I'm reading 'Ham on Rye' by Charles Bukowski for the third time.  It's such a weird little novel.  I actually like Buk quite a bit.  I'm also reading a collection called 'Sirens' that Rave gave me.  Let me just state for the record: vampire porn is... oddly good.  But I'm a freak.   I hung out with Matt a little today.  Had a *very* nice time.    When I came home, I picked up a Sharpie marker and started doodling.  I'm totally out of art supplies.  No paper, my charcoal pencils are worn down to nubs, my paints have pretty much dried up.  It's been so long since I did  anything .  So I took my Sharpie and a stack of computer paper and doodled my way through about 20 sheets.  Nothing really great, but it was amazing, really.  I haven't been inspired in  so  long.    Artists are a moody lot, aren't we?  I don't do anything for 6 months, then I draw or paint for a week straight.  Last time I had a creative spurt, I sold some paintings on eBay.  They didn't sell for much, but I also painted some 'HIM' jackets which sold for over $100 each.  Wish I could get inspired to do  that  again.  I should get more submissions out to comic book companies.  I got so burned out on rejection letters last time, though.  I did have one offer to ink on a series a few years ago, but they wanted me to move to Buffalo and I just wasn't ready for that.  *Sigh*  That was probably my one chance.  Oh well.  I'm not sure if I could make a career of it anyway when I go months with no inspiration.    Well, I'm going to Matt's for awhile tonight.  That is, if we're not both falling asleep.    'Night.

      I have a 3 foot tall red crayon bank in my bedroom.  It was dug out of a dumpster behind the plaza by my cousin's house.  Now don't tell me you're not familiar with 'Dumpster diving'...  It's practically a required activity amongst my friends and family!  No, it's not gross at all.  Stores throw out the coolest brand-new stuff...  The Blockbuster dumpster has brought us loads of B-movies on video and DVD (and cardboard cutouts and movie posters that we've sold for a small fortune on eBay).  The appliance stores throw out new fans and chairs and such that are missing one screw.   It's really quite amazing.  I'm convinced that we've collectively gotten enough stuff to furnish an entire house.   I havethis book called 'Evasion' (Written by some anonymous guy, and published by the Crimethink Collective.) It was one of those books that completely changes your way of thinking.  It's a true story about this guy who gets tired of his job, the daily routine, etc., and decides to live on the street.  Hopping trains from town to town, dumpster diving for food (which seems to be thrown out plentifully)... pure righteous anarchy, stickin' it to the man!  It's so amazing how easily one could live on the American 'trash' excess.  Really, it blew my mind.  Anyway - the crayon.  I've been throwing every piece of change I get into this bank since Christmas.  There's over $100 in there right now.  I call it my 'Ireland fund'.  Yeah.  I'm going to Ireland if it kills me.    I've always had a strange fascination with all things Irish.  I just  need  to go.  Even if I have to go nearly flat broke.  Or if I have to go all by myself.  I  will  get to Ireland somehow, someday.  Of course, at the rate my red crayon is filling up, it may be 10 years down the road.  LOL.    No one I know is nearly as excited about it as I am.  They're like 'Uh, yeah that's great."  *sigh*  Any takers?  Who wants to leave the country with me? C'mon...

      I had a panic attack at work this morning for no apparent reason.  Someone had to cover my spot for 20 minutes while I bawled and gulped for air.  I hate that - at least if something scares me, I can understand why it happens.  Somewhere deep inside of me, there's the drive to be 'normal'.  You know, to live life without worry ... To just get in my car and drive to a concert in Pittsburgh... Or to just go do something  new .  (I can't imagine.  I wasn't always this way - what the hell happened?)   But every once in awhile, there's this little part that pushes me to get out there and  do  something, whether I want to or not.  Like driving to that show on Saturday.  That was monumental.    Baby steps are better than standing still, right?  Dave has always tried to get me to be a bit more adventurous.  I guess (with his help) I've come a long way in the last few years.  Dave and Chris, by the way, seem to be having a 'thing' going on... I don't see either of them as much as I'd like anymore, due to conflicting work schedules.  (I don't care what you guys say.  'Fess up.  Lemme' guess... Chris took you to the club and got you wasted, right?  Typical.  No drunken straight guy can resist him... hell, no one can resist him. Myself included.  Damn he's pretty!)    *sigh*  Oops.  Got off track there.  Anyway, panic attacks leave me drained, then I feel really bummed out most of the day.  What's that about?  Heh.  Whenever I'm down, Dave always says "That's because you need to get laid!"  Right on.   I'm exhausted.    Matt and I have fallen into a comfortable spot lately.  I don't know what's up with us... We're just... comfortable.  Maybe just really good friends.  I don't know.  I cut work yesterday and hung out with Ev.  We've been hanging out alot lately, having alot of good conversation and heated debate - politics, religion... Nothing is sacred!   I'm also getting to watch some great gay porn, and hear alot about Rave that I really never needed to know. Heh.  Whooo!  Good times.   Wow.  The whole focus of this blog went from panic attacks, to bisexuals and gay porn!  I challenge any fellow blogger to beat that!

      I was checking this out today, because I wanted to read the actual document for myself, and stumbled into this.  Read and be terrified:  From hategun.com -   "Marvel at the  urlLink Pentagon report  that attempts to create legal and moral justification for torture and murder under the order of the President (see pages 21-25).  This is some scary, Orwellian, fascist shit. Based on the logic of this report, Hitler could have easily justified the Holocaust based on the premise that his "Final Solution" was for the greater good.  If this is the direction our executive branch is heading, what's to stop something like that from happening here?  The answer: VOTE. Then pray."

      Called Ev last night just before 3:00 a.m.  He was a wreck, as usual. Rave won't be home until Tuesday now, so when Matt got home this morning, he invited him to stay at his house for a few days.     So I went to Ev's last night for a few hours.  I think I got in just as the rest of my house was waking up, then got a whole two hours of sleep.  I feel really helpless around him sometimes.  I want to protect him from everything, and that's just impossible.  So anyway, we watched tv for awhile and fell asleep together.  (It was far more innocent than it sounds... lol).  My driving anxiety problem has been getting better lately.  I drove to a city I've never been to(about an hour away), got lost, and  didn't have a panic attack.     You probably don't understand.  I have panic attacks on highways...When semi-trucks get too close to my car...When I get lost  (I'm completely directionally challenged)...Going new places...  I was still a nervous wreck, but this is a huge breakthrough for me.  Maybe that's why I was so on edge last night.  I don't know.  Well, I'm going to try to sleep like a normal human being tonight.  Good night.

      Ever have one of those nights?  A night where you're wide awake, even though you had very little sleep the night before?  Even though you had a full, exhausting day?  Well, obviously I'm having one of those tonight.  I'm feeling very anxious and restless for no apparent reason.  It's kind of a nervous feeling...  Something just doesn't feel right.   Went to a local show tonight - great new band.  I'm excited about that, because that will help fill my boring summer nights.  While we were gone, my brother's CD player got vandalized from his car.  (Not stolen, vandalized - they were so stupid, they destroyed it trying to get it out of the dash.)  I'm feeling incredibly lonely right now.  I really need to talk to someone.  Anyone.  But since it's 2:44 a.m., I'm pretty sure everyone I know is asleep or out-of-town.  Still, I keep glancing at my 'buddy list' - hoping someone will sign on.  No one IMs me randomly, even.  Just the same old 'porn' IMs...  *Sigh*    I wonder what Chris and Matt are doing right now.  They're at the club tonight (Chris DJs  every  Saturday night).  They're probably having a blast as I sit here bored out of my mind.    Ev called my phone earlier and left a message.  He's having a bad depression day, and Rave's out of town for the night.  So he's home alone (which is one of his biggest anxiety problems/phobias).  I've tried calling him several times, but got no answer.  I hope he's okay.  I know - I worry about that boy way too much.    I need to calm down a bit.  I'm so freakin' tense right now.  I don't know what my problem is.  I guess I have nights like this every so often, but I don't know why.  I think once you have depression or any kind of anxiety disorder, it messes with you forever.  *Sigh*  So bored and lonely... I suppose if no one calls or IMs me soon, I'll try to call Evan again.  If he's awake, I'll go to his place and get him drunk.  If not, I'll take some Tylenol PM and try to sleep...   So restless... Aaahhhh!  Is anybody out there?  Does anyone actually read this crap?

       urlLink Punk rock guitarist Robert Quine found dead   Sad news today.  Robert Quine passed away at age 61.  Guitarist probably best known for his stint with 'Richard Hell and the Voidoids'(see Early Punk 101), but he also played on many Lloyd Cole albums, Tom Waits'  Rain Dogs  and some of Matthew Sweet's early works -  Girlfriend ,  Altered Beast , and  100% fun .  (If you know me at all, you know I'm a big Matthew Sweet fan.)   Heroin overdose - he was a hell of a guitarist.  Such a shame.

      I had fun yesterday.  Chris (a friend - not the same Chris that I've previously mentioned) is back from college for the summer.  He has formed a band with my brother and cousin, so I ran my brother over there to practice (and hang out).  Band practice only lasted an hour and a half, so we watched a crappy vampire movie, then went to the park afterwards.    We played soccer, frisbee, tied a rope to a tree and swung from it...  (Or more likely, I watched them make jackasses of themselves for most of the time - running is just no fun for some girls.)  Even so, I felt like a kid again.  This is pretty typical from these guys - even when we were 'bored', we had fun.  It made me think of how much fun tire swings were.  And jump rope.  And hopscotch.  All of those silly things that we don't do anymore since we're 'adults' now - and I wondered 'why?'

      I’m a liberal.  As much as I hate the ‘which side are you on?’ battle, and as much as I hate being labeled, it’s true.  I try to view everything from every possible point of view before I pass judgment on it.  I try to be as non-partisan as possible.  But have I ever found a republican candidate who I’d vote for?  No.  Try as I may, it’s just never happened.  There are just certain things that I will never understand.    I’ve seen the bumper stickers that say “We vote Pro-Life”.  Let me say that I think abortion is disgusting, and that I would personally never have one.  However, I am pro-choice.  I know the whole abortion debate will go on forever, but as my uncle would say ‘You can’t govern morality’.  I truly believe that.  I would never have an abortion because of my own morals and values.  Maybe my upbringing had something to do with it.  Unfortunately, not everyone who conceives a child is fit to be a parent.  And when this is the case, I would rather that child never live than grow up in extreme poverty, abused, crack-addicted, or neglected.   (I am completely against partial-birth abortion, however.)    ‘We Vote Pro-Life’.  Please.  There are a lot more issues to deal with in this world.  To base our entire future on one issue is just plain  ignorant  to me.   You can’t govern morality – period .  (And while we’re at it, you cannot force your religion on people, either.)  If people want to have an abortion, they will.  Unfortunately, many conservatives are against abortion, and also against sex education in the classroom.  Does this make sense to you?  Because it doesn’t to me.  Knowledge is power, my friends.  Why is it so horrible to educate our children to make informed decisions?  Otherwise, they’re finding out about sex on their own – which is  far  scarier.  This whole thing reminds me of a time when I overheard a guy say, “I’m gonna vote for whoever lets me keep my guns!”  Sir, no one is taking your guns away from you.  You’re an idiot.  Many conservatives are Pro-Life, but typically Pro-Death Penalty (which seems like a contradiction in itself…).  “Since 1973, 114 people in 25 states have been released from death row with evidence of their innocence. (Latest release, Gordon Steidl, May 28, 2004)”  urlLink Cases of innocence, 1973 – Present     That’s 114 innocent people in 31 years.  That’s 114 too many.  To their friends and families, that statistic is probably all the more staggering.  “The estimated costs for New York’s death penalty, which was reinstated in 1995: $160 million, or approximately $23 million for each person sentenced to death, with no executions likely for many years.” -  (The Times Union, Sept. 22, 2003)  $23 million!  Can you imagine how many other ways that money could be spent?!    Another thing I will never understand – the whole gay-marriage debate.    I don’t understand why gay rights have to be ‘special rights’.  In a country that prides itself on ‘Liberty and Justice for all’, a country that’s struggled for equality… why are we even having this debate?   Besides, why is it any different if they live together or are ‘officially’ married?  Does permitting them to marry change anything?  No.  (Of course, I’ve always thought that true happiness is hard enough to find in this world, and if you find something that makes you happy you need to hold onto it – despite what anyone else may think.)  Maybe it’s the  whole generation-gap.  This is a country that battled for women’s rights and black rights just  seconds  ago in the scheme of time.  I cannot imagine ever pre-judging someone based on the color of their skin, their gender, or their sexual orientation.  My mind will never be able to comprehend that.  Because we’re all human.  We all want and need the same basic things.  Don't throw the religion-aspect bullshit at me, either.  "Oh, it's in the bible!  It's a sin!"  It's not your job to pass judgment.   You are nothing.  If there is a God, let  Him  do the judging, and teach tolerance to your children.  You don't have to agree with it - but children need to learn understanding.     The America I love is based Liberty and Justice for  ALL .  White/black/Hispanic, Gay or Straight, Male or Female, Rich or Poor – Equal rights should be equal for everyone.  Am I so crazy to think that?

       urlLink Creed Splits   Yes friends, it's true.  Creed has split up.  Yes, the band that brought you the cock-rock anthem 'Higher'!  And don't forget the bullshit ballad, 'With Arms Wide Open'!      Is it just me, or did it sound like he was overpronouncing the last syllables of each line in that song?    I want to punch Scott Stapp in the face.  Alright, so I'm a little brutal with the Creed-bashing.  But I, for one, am glad it's over.  Who'd have thought they'd make 3 bestselling albums?  Three!      Who buys this crap?

      I'm at work right now, and I shouldn't be blogging.  But that's too damn bad, because I'm having a shitty day.  I'm waist-high in a project that shouldn't be my job (what else is new?).    And I'm not just being a bitch because the project is a pain in the ass - It really  shouldn't  be my job.  Without giving too much away, someone came to us to see if we could order thousands of dollars worth of products for them, but all in special quantities, 'only if I can get 8  right now '.  My boss told me last year when we did this that we'd never do it again - it took up too much of my time, it wasn't really my job, it was so much hassle, these people should be doing this themselves, etc...  Then when they asked this year, she was like "Okay.  Sure.  Hey, you're going to do this again..."    So once again, hundreds of things are on backorder.  Things that weren't supposed to backorder are coming in, and I have to ship them all back.  If they only had 7 instead of 8, they ship 7 and I have to re-order another one - but it's backordered.  Thousands of dollars worth.    On top of all that, I have my  actual  work to do.  So that  really  sucks.  I have six big boxes sitting in front of me, unopened.  And they're going to stay there until Monday, because I'm burned out on this whole thing.    So instead of opening those boxes and examining the future headaches to come, I'm gonna' sit here and whine about it.  LOL  At least I have a few CDs with me to calm my nerves.  On Chris' suggestion I bought 'Franz Ferdinand' and 'The Faint' last night.  And though neither one is really 'my thing', they're growing on me fast.  'The Faint' makes me want to dance - and well, I don't dance.  Of course, Chris (being a club DJ) is all about dancing.  You 'beautiful dance whore', you.  Of course, for a day when you want to revel in your own sadness (or creep out the rest of your office), you need the good old-fashioned morbidness of 'Murder By Death'.  So when my dance tunes run out, I'll pop that in and sulk a bit more.   *Sigh*  I have a little over three hours to go until I get a day's reprieve...Then I get to do it all over again.  The routine is killing me.    Think happy thoughts... Think happy thoughts...  Tomorrow I have a day off... Whooo!    Yesterday was a blast.  I was 'sick' (er...of work) yesterday, so I blew off to hang with Matt.  We went to the zoo (!) for a bit, which was fun, then I bought him lunch (despite his protests).  Ev & Rave stopped by Matt's place for a bit and we did the whole cake-and-presents thing.  I guess Dave, Chris, Micah, and Joey showed after we left.  (We all worked on his birthday, so we celebrated it Friday.)   It was one of those days that you just don't want to end...    Everyone has those, right? - Summer days...The weather's beautiful, you're with your friends in the car with the windows down, tunes cranked up, singing along... And at that moment you can't think of anything more perfect.  And you'll do  anything  ... 'Just don't take me home yet'!?  We don't 'go out' like most people do, I guess. I don't drink, I hate the smoke, I hate drunks, and around here we just have really shitty bars... Shitty cover bands, drunken rednecks, and country star wannabes.  Getting drunk with your friends is one thing.  Bars just don't do it for me.  Matt usually goes with Chris to the club on Saturdays, so that's about all the partying they can stand.  The club Chris DJs at is a lot of fun.  If it were closer, (Uh, about an 8 hour drive) we'd all go every weekend.    Dave asked me the other day, "Does it bother you that Matt goes every Saturday?" I said, "No, why would it?" "I don't know.  Most girls would be pissed at their boyfriends for going out without them every Saturday." "He's allowed to hang out with his friends.  I can't usually go anyway, because I work Saturdays.  I trust him.  He's a good boy.  He's more likely to make out with Chris than some other girl."    He just laughed, "Yeah, you're right".    I'm  far  more worried about  Chris  than any other girls (and with good reason - Chris admittedly would be all over Matt if he'd let him.  Who knows what happens when they're both drunk...) LOL  I don't care what happens, boys.    Just make sure I get pictures. ;)

       urlLink An Interesting Day: President Bush's Movements and Actions on 9/11   I'm anxiously awaiting the release of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11.  Though I don't personally like  him  (I think he's a bit obnoxious), I think he really has alot to say.  From day one, I've insisted that Bush had to know something about 9/11.  The inconsistencies and odd coincidences are too numerous to be... well, coincidences.  I've studied this painstakingly (because I'm a dork like that.)- I printed the NORAD report before it was yanked off of their site when people started questioning it.  The news article above talks a little about the inconsistencies of Bush's week - fascinating.  I'd go into depth, but for fear of 'the Patriot Act', I guess I'll keep this whole blog vague.    Will somebody just  read  the Patriot Act, for christsake?     I'm sure I'm not alone when I say I'm not pleased with how the 'war' is going.  And I'm sure I'm not the only one who's unpleased with Bush's job performance.  This morning on my local news, I heard that one of our local 'reserve troops' has been called out for a  second  bout in Iraq.    I've been kicking all these thoughts around in my head since last night when I visited my aunt.  I love her to death, but we will just never see eye to eye on politics.  Of course, I probably provoked discussion when I wore my faded old 'Not My President' shirt to her house without thinking.    "Poor guy, he's just trying to do his job," she says.  I spew out some random insult about him not even being able to speak in complete sentences, how is he supposed to do his 'job'?  (Let's face it, he's clearly not a grammar scholar.  He makes up and mispronounces words, then uses improper verb tenses with reckless abandon and no regard for basic sentence structure.)    She mentioned something like "Well, we're not exactly grammar scholars, either..."     "No I'm not -  but I'm not  Leader of the Free World! ", I yelled. "He graduated from Harvard, they don't just give those diplomas out, you know." "Actually he graduated from Yale - member of the Skull and Bones society.  So it's a good possibility..."  She (of course) had no idea what I was talking about, so I just dropped it - not in the mood for a fight.  It's not just some silly conspiracy theory - it really exists.  If you're unfamiliar with the Skull & Bones, do a quick Google search - just the sheer weirdness of this whole secret society is fascinating.   Of course, many other famous politicians were 'Bonesmen' - Bush, Sr., John Kerry...    Just a few observations from a political junkie -   Everyone knows that Bush's cohorts are making billions of dollars off of the  clean-up/reconstruction/oil deals from Iraq... but no one seems to care.  Is that weird to anyone else?  I'm sick of our corporate-owned media.  I only believe about half of what I hear.  I like to find alternate news sources on every story - foreign papers, Indymedia... Try a couple different perspectives before you go running your mouth like you know what you're talking about.     "Well, ABC, NBC, CBS: Bullshit! They give us fact or fiction?  I guess an even split.  And each new act of war is tonight's entertainment. We're still the pawns in their game.  As they take an eye for an eye until no one can see, we must stumble blindly forward, repeating history.  Well, I guess that we all fit into your slogan on the fast food marquee:  Red blooded, White skinned oh and the Blues. I got the Blues! I got the Blues! That's me!"  - Conor Oberst  Let me say that I'm not a fan of John Kerry, either.  Though it's an improvement over G-Dubs,  I don't really think he has the vision to get our country back on track.   I hope I'm wrong.  I truly do.  I was supporting Dennis Kucinich.  I love the grassroots funding/networking that his entire campaign was based on.  He has some visions that I think would actually change Ameri©a - that is, if we could get Congress to pass anything.  Sometimes I feel like the president is just a figurehead nowadays.  Everything is about 'which side you're on' with no regard for what's good for the country.  As engrossed as I am by politics... I'm bored with it.    Don't believe everything you see on TV.

       urlLink    Dropkick Murphys - Club Laga, Pittsburgh 2001&nbsp; urlLink     I am going through 'show withdrawal'.  That's right.  I haven't been to a music concert/local show since February 22nd.  Over three months.  I remember that show because it was one of my all-time favorite bands, the Mr. T Experience.  I've been listening to them for almost 10 years, and they're one of those bands I never thought I'd get a chance to see.  They don't tour the east coast very often.  The band has probably had close to 30 different members throughout the years, but one thing has remained constant - Dr. Frank.  So needless to say, I was pretty excited when they came to Club Laga in Pittsburgh (My absolute, all-time favorite venue, about 2 hours away).  I don't know if anyone else is like this, but when I listen to a band for many years, I feel there's a strange connection.  You know, how you can bring to mind the time when you first heard 'that song', certain memories connected to each one?  I mean, I've been listening to them since I was in junior high!  So it was a great show.  I met the band, and they were awesome.  Very sweet, humble people.  We talked and took pictures, and shook hands - all in all a pleasant night.  (And that picture of me with Dr. Frank still sits on my dresser...)  As I left there however, I was incredibly saddened.  I realized that this was probably the last show I would go to at Club Laga.  I took a picture of the neon sign and walked away.  Laga closed it's doors after 12 years on April 2nd.  It still bums me out incredibly - over the past few years, we went to so many shows there.  Tickets were never more than $12.00, and you'd get a great night of music really close to the stage in a unified, friendly atmosphere.  All shows were all ages (something we appreciated back in the day!).  You could get close to the band and not get killed!  It was one of those few places where you could have your hands  on the stage  without a 5 foot barrier, or a million bouncers pushing you back.  Hell, if the band didn't care, you could be  on  the stage, as was the case with many punk shows. There's not too many intimate venues like Laga left - if you've only attended concerts in an amphitheatre, make it a point to go to someplace smaller - like the Cleveland Agora.  You'll get a much better show.  (Though Laga was far superior to the Agora...)  It really saddens me that it had to close - there's not many positive environments left for kids these days.  Just another part of my youth, gone.  Before I get too weepy and nostalgic on you, I guess I'll shut up.  Ah, yes.  Show Withdrawal.  Most of the local bands that we've loved so much through the years split up last summer.  Some of them have re-joined and formed new bands, so I'm looking forward to that.  First local show of the year - June 12th.    And then there's Warped Tour.  Tickets are $32.50 this year.  When we started going they were under 20 bucks.  Still worth it for an entire day of music and fun.  God, in the past few years I've seen and met so many great bands on the 'Tour - AFI, Rancid, NOFX, Bad Religion, Brand New, The Vandals, Flogging Molly, Dropkick Murphys, Tiger Army, the Rollins Band, Anti-Flag, Less than Jake...  the list goes on and on.  It's actually what I plan my summer vacation around.  No, seriously.  I live for Warped Tour.  Well, that's enough rambling for now.  Does anyone else have this horrible music affliction?  Because sometimes I think I'm crazy...

      This morning Matt and his friend Micah stopped by while I was working.  We ended up talking a bit, and Micah seemed kind of aggitated.  I asked him what was wrong, and he told me a story that went something like this.  "I went to get my haircut today, and I wanted it shorter than usual.  So I'm sitting in the chair, and she asks me how it looks.  I say it looks okay, but I'd like it a bit shorter.  She starts cutting then says, 'You know, I'm trying to keep it a little bit longer to hide your receeding hairline.'"  (Micah is 23 years old, and his hairline really isn't that bad.)  At this point, I burst out laughing.  "You should have said something to her!", I yelled.  "I would have, but she had scissors in her hands!"  Then Matt started laughing, and interrupted with the rest of the story.  "So we went to *random electronics store - I don't remember which one*, and he picks up the video camera that's attached to the big screen TVs.  And he yells 'Attention shoppers!  I'm Micah.  I'm 23 years old from New Jersey, and this is my receeding hairline!'  And he continues to zoom in on his forehead ranting for five/ten minutes.  'Yeah, see that?  Big forehead!  Receeding hairline!  I'll be bald before I'm 30!'"  A word of advice to hairstylists - don't tell your clients they're balding at age 23.  It's just not good business.

      Do you ever feel very small and insignificant?  I don’t mean it to be depressing, but have you ever stood next to a 100 year old tree and pondered the fact that it may still be around after you’re gone?    I went to the peninsula last night (which truly has some of the nicest beaches on Lake Erie – and some amazing sunsets).  I don’t know why, but I hadn’t been there in a few years.  It’s not that far from where I live – I guess I just take it for granted.      As I sat on that old weathered picnic table watching the brilliant orange sun sink into the water, I was overwhelmed.  The water was particularly choppy, it was windy and cold, but the view was incredible.    When I was younger, I never realized how lucky we are to have this little gem of a beach on our shores.  We used to go fishing with my dad and uncle – my cousins and I would tire of fishing quickly, and collect beach glass and seashells until it got dark.  On the holidays, we could sit against an old hollow tree trunk at night and watch the fireworks over the lake from the nearby amusement park.    Back in October, I vacationed in Florida.  I felt like that when I saw the ocean for the first time.  Very small, very frail.  And I wondered where I fit into this great big world.  When faced with the vastness of nature, I often wonder if anything we do really matters.  I mean, If I were a huge success in the business world – would it mean anything?  These lofty goals we set for ourselves – all meaningless.  To the earth, are we really any different than the squirrels or birds?  So when I start feeling like maybe I’m not where I’m supposed to be at this point in my life, I’m going to try to remember this:  It doesn’t matter.  It doesn’t matter where I am in 5 years, because it’s clearly not going to matter in 200 years.    Funny words coming from a political junkie who still thinks that maybe something I do can change the world.    Don’t get me wrong, there’s much worth fighting for – the quality of life, equality, nature.  Maybe the key to life is just to enjoy our short time here while we can.  Soak in that warm sunshine (but not without sunblock!), splash through a mud puddle barefoot, roll in the green grass… Bring back some of that childlike wonder – from before you were jaded and stuck in the 9 to 5 grind.   Try to remember what it was like before deadlines, car payments, housework – and do it every chance you get.    I’m not giving up - I'll keep fighting the good fight (Never, ever lose your anger).  But I hope I can live by my own advice a little more often.

       urlLink News    Does anyone see a problem with this?  I don't know, maybe it's just me.  It just seems sick.  You know, Jeffrey Dahmer used to keep 'souvenirs'  of all the people he killed.  Okay, so it's not  exactly  the same thing, but why would you keep this as a trinket?   And then show it off like it's some great prize?  Don't you think the rest of the world might see this as egotistical and just a bit  wrong ?  (And, as some might note it's like he's compensating for something else.)

      I have a friend, he is made mostly of pain.  He wakes up, drives to work, and then straight back home again.  He once cut one of my nightmares out of paper. I thought it was beautiful, I put it on a record cover. And I tried to tell him he had a sense  of color and composition so magnificent. And he said "Thank you, please but your flattery  is truly not becoming me. Your eyes are poor.  You are blind. You see,  no beauty could have come from me. I am a waste  of breath,  of space,  of time."  I knew a woman, she was dignified and true.  Her love for her man was one of her many virtues. Until one day, she found out that he had lied  and decided the rest of her life, from that point on would be a lie.  But she was grateful for everything that had happened. And she was anxious for all that would come next.  But then she wept. What did you expect?  In that big, old house  with all those cars she kept. "Oh!" and "such is life,"  she often said.  With one day leading her to the next, you get a little closer to your death,  which was fine with her. She never got upset  and with all the days  she may have left, she would never clean another mess  or fold his shirts or look her best. She was free  to waste  away  alone.  Last night, my brother he got drunk and drove.  And this cop pulled him off to the side of the road. And he said, "Officer! Officer! You’ve got the wrong man. No, no, I'm a student of medicine,  the son of a banker, you don't understand!" The cop said, "No one got hurt, you should be thankful.  And you carelessness, it is something awful.  And no, I can't  just let you go.  And though your father's  name is known, your decisions now are yours alone.  You’re nothing but a stepping stone on a path  to debt,  to loss,  to shame."  The last few months I have been living with this couple. Yeah, you know, the kind that buy everything in doubles.  They fit together, like a puzzle. I love their love and I am thankful  that someone actually receives the prize that was promised  by all those fairy tales that drugged us. And they still do me.  I'm sick, lonely,  no laurel tree,  just green envy. Will my number come up  eventually?  Like love's some kind of lottery, where you can scratch and see  what's underneath.  It's "Sorry", just one cherry,  "Play Again."  Get lucky.  So I have been hanging out down by the train's depot.  No, I don't ride. I just sit and watch the people there.  They remind me of wind up cars in motion. The way they spin and turn and jockey for positions. And I want to scream out that it is all nonsense. And that their lives are one track,  and can't they see how it is all pointless? But then, my knees give under me.  My head feels weak and suddenly  it is clear to see that it is not them but me,  who has lost my self-identity. As I hide behind these books I read,  while scribbling my poetry, like art could save a wretch like me,  with some ideal ideology  that no one can hope  to achieve. And I am never real;  it is just a sketch of me. And everything I have  is trite  and cheap  and a waste  of paint,  of tape,  of time.  Sometimes I park my car down my the cathedral,  where floodlights point up at the steeples. Choir practice is filling up with people.  I hear the sound escaping as an echo. Sloping off the ceiling at an angle.  When voices blend they sound like angels. I hope there is still some room left in the middle. But when I lift my voice up now to reach them.  The range is too high, way up in heaven. So I hold my tongue,  forget the song,  tie my shoe  and start walking off. And try to just keep moving on,  with my broken heart  and my absent God and I have no faith  but it is all I want,  to be loved  and believe in my soul.  Listen to Bright Eyes.

      (Lyric: 'Dr. Frank Was Right', The Benjamins) ;)   Lots of crazy dreams last night. Whoo. I have been so wound up for the second day in a row… Gah! I don’t know what my problem is…! Someone help me! (Plleeeeaaaase?)  I wrote here for 45 minutes while I was sitting around by myself last night. I published my blog, then checked on it later, and all I had was a title! Gah! How did that happen? Sheesh, that’s annoying. Not that I ever write anything important, but still.  I was whining about my ancient old cat. She’s 18-19? years old right now. A few months ago, she got really sick. I took her to the vet, which helped, but she lost a lot of weight. A month or two after that, she slipped a disk in her back (yeah, seriously)… she hobbled around, so I took her to the vet again. I’m not sure what he did, other than give her a cortisone shot. It seemed to help her for a few months. Now she’s hobbling around again. She takes a few steps, then has to rest. I feel so bad. Every time she gets the slightest ailment, my vet wants to have her put down because ‘she’s so old’. (He’s been saying that for 3 or 4 years…) She still seems pretty happy, though. It’s almost as if that doesn’t bother her at all. Unfortunately now she’s eating very little (down from 2 cans a day to about ½ a can…). Gah. I’m afraid she won’t be around much longer. I should have her put down, but I can’t bear to do that…*sigh*  It’s 77 degrees outside, 83 in my office. Bleh. It’s been raining off and on for the last 16 hours or so. The roads are starting to flood. I hit a puddle today that was much deeper than I anticipated, sending muddy water sloshing into my open window. Heh.  Everyone here is without power – except the freakin’ library. It sucks. (If the power is our for an hour, we close.) It’s been out since I got here this morning – over 4 hours! Literally every block is out except ours. *sigh*  I know I sound depressing, but I’m actually in a good mood today. Weird, I know. I feel like I’m complaining all the time, but this is where I go to vent. It’s easier to write about the little things that bother you for some reason. General happiness leaves me with nothing to write about. lol  I’m getting excited about Warped on Thursday. Can’t wait to see Tiger Army, Anti-Flag, Taking Back Sunday, and Flogging Molly again in particular. Our local boys, The Code will be there. They’re so much fun. A band we see sometimes called ‘Coat of Arms’ will be there. They haven’t played around here in awhile. I’d also like to see the Casualties, as I missed their set last time. My goal is to get my picture taken with those guys. I will totally not fit in with them and all of their punk-rock-ness. lol And that hair! How do they do that?!   Ev & Rave are home. Ev begged me to stay home today to hang with him, but I don’t dare. I’m off Tues. - Sun. of next week. Plus, today’s a Saturday and we’re incredibly short-staffed as usual. I feel bad, because I don’t get to see him much lately.  He's keeps teasing that he's going to revoke my computer priviliges if I don't start sleeping earlier.  *giggle*  But ... I don't want to....!  I'm having too much fun...!  I told him about how I got hit on by a girl the other day. Gah. Why did I tell him that? I don't know. He laughed, then told me I should have 'hooked it up'. Quote: 'She obviously wanted you! You should have gotten some action, if nothing else!' *sigh* I'm just... not into girls. I like muscles and... er... 'boy parts' way too much. lol I think it's cool. Whatever makes you happy is a good thing. I'm just not into it. There's nothing special that a girl could do for me. I mean, really. Either a guy could do it, or I could do it to myself. lol Of course he was like, "Hey, but you've never tried it!" Gah. I don't want to get into discussing my (lack of) sex life... lol  It's different for guys, you know? Seriously, that's a whole new world there. lol Don't get me started, Ev. I was there when you... well, you know... Should I tell the story? *giggle*  Well, I’m off to write and design some P.R. stuff for a library event. Whoo-Hoo.

      Cut from one of those stupid chain e-mails... still, some interesting stuff here.&nbsp; lol   >>Interesting facts about sex:   1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when women make love they produce amounts of the hormone estrogen, which makes hair shine and skin smooth.   2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses the pores and makes your skin glow.   3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that romantic dinner.   4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special&nbsp;sneakers!   5.&nbsp; Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases endorphins into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and leaving you with a feeling of well being.   6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called pheromones. These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!   7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.   8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away.&nbsp; Kissing encourages saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.   9.&nbsp; Sex actually relieves headaches A lovemaking session can release the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.   10.&nbsp; A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a natural antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.   Wow.&nbsp; Who knew all that?&nbsp; Huh.&nbsp; I get headaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm always on edge.&nbsp; I'm not severely depressed any more, but I've been known to have brief bouts with mild depression.&nbsp; That explains it - it's because I'm not getting any!&nbsp; lol&nbsp; I am so horribly repressed... I need to hook up!&nbsp; Any takers?&nbsp; C'mon.&nbsp; It's for medical reasons!&nbsp; *giggle*

      (Lyric: 'Our Lady of Sorrows', My Chemical Romance)  I forgot to bring my lunch to work today, and walked out of the house with no money.&nbsp; Gah. I hate that.&nbsp; Luckily I borrowed a few bucks and went to the BK Lounge for a veggie burger.&nbsp; (Uh... BK Lounge = Burger King.&nbsp; Listen to Dane Cook. He’s my idol.&nbsp; Well, him and #2 from Anti-Flag.)&nbsp; His CD cracks me up.&nbsp; The first time I heard it, I thought I might wet myself from laughing so hard.&nbsp; “I don't like when juice wears tights!”&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp; Um... Just listen to it.   On the way there, the radio was playing a strange but good mix of old songs, including the Ramones and Bob Marley. Now I’ve had ‘Redemption Song’ stuck in my head for over 4 hours…lol&nbsp; (I should mention that I rarely listen to the radio, but when I do, it’s indie channels out of Cleveland, or Cincinnatti… Corporate radio sucks ass.)&nbsp;&nbsp;   I love Bob Marley.&nbsp; Maybe I should get more into reggae.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; There’s this reggae group called ‘Morgan Heritage’ that plays at Warped Tour every so often.&nbsp; They’re always so much fun. It makes me feel very carefree, and has even been known to get my shy self dancing with the crowd.&nbsp;   I got an e-mail from classmates.com today.&nbsp; ‘Do you recognize these 63 names?’&nbsp; Um.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Remind me why I signed up to be included in this after high school…?&nbsp; How do I take my name off of there?&nbsp; lol  &nbsp;&nbsp;   urlLink Women See This One Color Differently &nbsp;  Gah!&nbsp; Interesting article...Evan and I have had this discussion a million times.&nbsp; There ARE different shades of red.&nbsp; No, really.&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of Ev, they’re coming home tomorrow.&nbsp; Short vacation, but I hope they had fun.   Well, I get to go home soon.&nbsp; I’ll probably go get dinner, then sit in front of the TV and watch C-SPAN all night.&nbsp; God, I’m exciting.

      ...something warm to hold me, something pure to burn away the darkness that hides inside my mind..." (Lyric: 'Maybe I'll Catch Fire', Alkaline Trio)  Gah.&nbsp; I love the Alk3.  I'm such a dork.&nbsp; I've been watching C-SPAN quite a&nbsp;bit lately.&nbsp; Of course, they're covering the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp; My brother is just as bad - he has to work tonight, and he's having me tape the keynote speakers tonight so that he doesn't miss it.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; These stupid things get me fired up.&nbsp; Get that bastard out of office already.&nbsp;   It's kinda funny.&nbsp; It reminds me of WWE wrestling - you know.&nbsp; Everyone gets announced, then they stroll out to the stage... everything is set to some funky music... there's some name calling... &nbsp;there's people there waving signs for their favorite guy... *giggle*&nbsp; C'mon.&nbsp; Don't you see the resemblance?&nbsp; At all?&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; lol  I got the new Taking Back Sunday CD today.&nbsp; I'd have probably bought another one, but I was pretty broke, and needed to put gas in my car.&nbsp; And everything I wanted was on sale!! Gah!&nbsp; What are the odds of that?&nbsp; It's not like I listen to massively popular mainstream bands...!&nbsp; They're having a 'Warped Tour'/'Epitaph' sale at our local FYE, and everything I wanted was $9.99 or less.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; lol&nbsp; Hot Water Music, Hawthorne Heights, Funeral For a Friend, Letter Kills, Eighteen Visions... and I almost walked out with the Ann Beretta CD ($8.99!).&nbsp; Gah.&nbsp; I have so little self-control.&nbsp; I'll probably go back on Friday or Saturday.&nbsp; lol&nbsp;&nbsp;   The CD is good, though.&nbsp; I likee.&nbsp; I'm kinda disturbed by the naked baby's ass on the&nbsp; front cover.&nbsp; It's kinda weird.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I can't wait to see them again.&nbsp; I could watch Adam Lazzara swing that microphone all day long.&nbsp; I've seen them ... um...&nbsp;6&nbsp; times?&nbsp; and I've never seen him drop it yet. &nbsp; Gah.&nbsp; That's talent.

      “…so turn up the corners of your lips  Part them and feel my finger tips  Trace the moment, fall forever  Defense is paper thin” – ‘Vindicated’ – Dashboard Confessional   I really like that new DC song…it’s been in my head all morning.   So I get home last night... and no one's here but my sister.  Her boyfriend came over, and they went upstairs to... god knows what...  My cousin comes home a bit later and says, "You know your dad was in a car accident, right?"  Um.  No!  He's fine.  Someone smacked into him.  Some jackass kid driving too fast down a winding side road.  Probably a few thousand dollars worth of damage....  *sigh*  It really isn’t as bad as I make it sound.  It just freaked me out.   It sucks.  Our insurance will cover it, but we have a $500 deductible.   The car really isn’t too bad, so it’s going to be low on the priority chain… The money issue is getting tighter here.  I keep trying to help out as much as I can… still, I don’t feel it’s ever enough.   Dad is still off work.  They now say he has permanent nerve damage in his back.  Something about they think he did damage ages ago, then aggravated it… I don’t know.  Either way, it wasn’t diagnosed soon enough.  So they’re having him see a rheumatologist and a pain management specialist.  They’re going to try ‘nerve blocks’ or cortisone shots and hope that helps.  It’s all like one big experiment.    In the meantime, they told him to apply for social security, because these kinds of things can sometimes take years to correct.  So he did…He was turned down because he has a 401k plan at work.  He can’t pull that 401k unless he quits.  If he quits his job and pulls his 401k, he’ll have no medical insurance for all those appointments… Gah.  I don’t know.  Shitty situation all around….   I had a panic attack for no apparent reason last night.  Very odd. I get them every so often, but usually something triggers them.  I don’t remember having one (for no reason) like this since around Christmastime… Probably if I look back in my blog, I’ve had one since.  Wait… maybe I did.  I don’t remember… My memory is crap. lol   Gah! I talked to Allan last night. I was really afraid he’d think I was a dork, but I think everything was okay.  A little bit awkward, but good.  It took everything I had to dial that last digit… lol  I wish I wasn’t so horribly shy.    Yesterday I felt kinda ‘blah’.  Today I’m feeling very good.  Giddy, almost.

      (Lyric: 'Frano Un-American', NOFX)  A library patron started talking about ‘life-chaging’ books today… of course her ‘life-changing’ books were all ‘Oprah’ books. Gah. Of course this got me thinking… I’m not sure I can think of a life-changing piece of fiction. These are a few non-fiction titles that completely knocked me on my ass:   A People’s History of the United States by Howard Zinn   You Can’t Be Neutral on a Moving Train by Howard Zinn   Evasion by the CrimethInc. Collective   Days of War, Nights of Love by the CrimethInc Collective   Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser   Pretty much anything by Noam Chomsky   No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies by Naomi Klein   My Soul Looks Back in Wonder: Voices of the Civil Rights Experience by Juan Williams   Diet For a New America by John Robbins   Slaughterhouse by Gail Eisnitz   Silent Spring by Rachel Carson   The Legacy of Luna by Julia Butterfly Hill (Gah. I have to read this again! Remember that girl who stayed in a redwood tree for over two years to protest the clear cutting of redwoods? What a great story...)   I’m sure there are a million or so more that have shaped my warped little mind…I can’t think of any more right now.

      (Lyric: ‘Line and Sinker’, Billy Talent)  I don’t. Not that I ever do. But today I’m feeling more self-conscious than usual. I’m never going to be one of those super-pretty, super-skinny girls. I'll always be average at best. I’m never going to feel comfortable in my own skin. Gah. I’d be happy if I got down to a size 12. Hopefully by September… I seem to be at a standstill. Depression can wreak havoc on not only your mind, but your body, too. *sigh* I think maybe the pack of anorexic-looking 16-year olds who just came in are getting to me. lol.  Feeling yucky today.  Just kinda sad for no apparent reason… I’m okay.  Just kinda ‘blah’.  Ev called last night. He and Rave are having fun in Aspen. They haven’t hiked yet. I’m not sure why they’d want to, as Ev is horribly asthmatic and hiking would surely send him into an attack… I’m not so sure Rave wanted to hike anyway… I think it was just an excuse to get away. (As a side note, I’m pretty sure they haven’t left the hotel yet…lol) Ev’s doing well – only one panic attack on the plane. Of course, he took the tranquilizer his doc gave him and slept most of the way.  I have shin splints from ten hours of walking during Warped Tour on Thursday. They hurt. I can’t even touch my shins, because they feel like they’re badly bruised. I’ve been hobbling around since Friday morning. lol. When I woke up today, the ringing in my ears was finally gone. I was starting to get worried about it – I’ve never had ringing last that long! I’m buying earplugs for next Friday.  I’ve watched ‘The Neverending Story’ twice in the past two days. I started thinking about all of the movies I watched when I was younger… The Last Unicorn (I started reading the book today), The Goonies, The Dark Crystal, Willow, Labyrinth, Legend… (I guess I was really into fantasy stuff when I was little…) I think I need them all on DVD. Does anyone remember ‘Legend’? I could pay that $20 right now just to see Tom Cruise in tights. lol. Do you think that man will ever not be attractive? I mean, sure…. He’s old enough to be my dad, but he still looks good. It’s like Brad Pitt. Or Matt Damon. Or Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. I don’t think you could ever make them look bad.   Speaking of fantasy… I was just thinking of a book I read a few months ago called ‘Eragon’… Has anyone read it? The author, Christopher Paolini, was 15 when he wrote it. I thought it was fantastic, albeit a bit similar to the ‘Lord of the Rings’. You should read it.      urlLink Bush’s National Guard Records Found    Ha! Fan-fucking-tastic. You mean they suddenly ‘found’ Bush’s records less than 4 months before election time? Isn’t that convenient, now that it’s an election-time issue?! What do you think we’ll do for an encore? A month before some sort of legislation is considered to limit gas prices? And two months before we ‘find’ Osama Bin Laden! Then we can all rest easier, knowing that G-Dubs was a good guy after all!    I ordered the 9/11 Commission Report. I can’t wait until it gets here. The most amazing thing to me is the times submitted by NORAD. I printed the NORAD report before it was taken off their website when people started questioning it… I mean, you receive notice that a plane is on it’s way to the White House, and you wait 12 minutes before you dispatch planes to shoot it down? Bush learned of the attacks at 8:55 a.m. – but didn’t leave until 9:35! America was under attack, and you sat around reading books to children for 40 minutes!   “At the time the Pentagon was hit, about 20,000 people were at work in the building. Yet despite the significant portion of the building affected by the crash, only 125 Pentagon employees were killed. The portion of the building that sustained the impact, so called "Wedge One", had recently undergone renovations including the reinforcement of exterior walls with steel beams and columns.” - urlLink  urlLink  9/11 Research      Isn’t that odd that it hit the ‘least important’ part of a big government building. You’d think terrorists would do their research!    I don’t see how it happened.  It think it was ‘allowed’.   urlLink  9/11 Timeline    Enough rambling.  I’m going on my lunch break!

      (Lyrics by NOFX)&nbsp; though the lyrics change at every show...   He's not smart, a C student  And that's after buying his way into school  Beady eyes, he's kinda dyslexic  Can he read? No one's really quite sure…  He signs stuff. He executes people  Maybe that's why, he doesn't have any friends  Cocaine and a little drunk driving  Don't matter, when you're Commander in Chief.   Idiot son of an asshole  He's the idiot son of an asshole  Idiot son of an asshole  He's the idiot son of an asshole   Put on some make-up, turn on the 8-Track,  I'm putting a week back on the shelf.  Suddenly I'm the President of the United States,  But then I wake up, and realize I'm still me.   He's too dumb, to eat pretzels,  apparently smart enough to fix an election.  Moved boldly into the White House,  though most people voted against him.  He likes naps. He really likes naptime.  A couple of naps then a nap and he's ready for bed,  He may be from Bush decent,  but he's always gonna be the un-president.   &nbsp;  Idiot son of an asshole  He's the idiot son of an asshole  Idiot son of an asshole  He's the idiot son of an asshole  Idiot son of an asshole  He's the idiot son of an asshole   He's our president!

      (Lyric: 'A New Kind of Army, Anti-Flag)   Warped Tour was fun.&nbsp; I saw a few good bands this year.&nbsp; I could have scrapped a few hours in the middle where we wandered around aimlessly, for lack of bands we wanted to see.&nbsp; I got beer spilled on me, I smelled like pot by the time I got home, the crowds were nuts, I was sweaty and gross... Still, not a bad experience.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; My ears are still ringling really loudly.&nbsp; I'm kinda worried, as I never have this problem. Usually by the time I go to sleep and wake up, it's gone.&nbsp; And my calf muscles ache today!&nbsp; I guess 10 hours of standing and walking without break will do that to you. lol   The Cleveland venue sucks in my opinion.&nbsp; We always have a much better time in Pittsburgh.&nbsp; It's more spread out, so you don't have to deal with the wall-to-wall crowds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only one panic attack, and that didn't happen until we were on our way home.&nbsp; Whoo!   I'm trying to remember the bands we saw.&nbsp; Tiger Army was amazing, as usual. Flogging Molly is always a blast, as it's a big sing-along (and you can dance a jig!) ...&nbsp; I think this is something like the eight time I've seen them?&nbsp; Alkaline Trio, one of my favorites.&nbsp; One of the reasons we went to Cleveland.&nbsp; Taking Back Sunday - we've seen them a lot, but Adam Lazarra is away 'on'.&nbsp; He's pretty intense.&nbsp; Ah, and of course Anti-Flag!   &nbsp;  (Screamed) "The color of your skin does not matter here.  Your religion does not matter here.  Your sexual preference does not matter here.  The fucking flag they fly over our heads  does not matter here .  What matters is humanity and brotherhood."   Thus spoke Anti-Flag's '#2'.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Yes, he's the second Chris in the band, therefore he goes by the name, 'Number Two'. lol)&nbsp; I'm a fairly avid civil rights person, but watching Anti-Flag always gets me militant and fired up.&nbsp; I love all the political banter in between songs, about the gay marriage issue, re-instating the draft, registering to vote...   "With you or against you?&nbsp; Then I am against you because you're a:&nbsp; Turncoat!&nbsp; Killer!&nbsp; Liar!&nbsp; Thief!&nbsp; Criminal with protection of the law!"&nbsp; ('Turncoat', Anti-Flag)&nbsp; Put your middle finger up in the air, and scream it to&nbsp;G-Dubs&nbsp;for all your worth.&nbsp; There.&nbsp; Don't you feel better?&nbsp; Hehehe.   Those were probably the 5 bands I liked the most.&nbsp; But we did see a few others - Matchbook Romance.&nbsp; They were decent.&nbsp; I saw a little of NOFX.&nbsp; They crack me up.&nbsp; I caught a little of Bad Religion from the skateboarding/BMX ramp.&nbsp; We saw Allister, who I like.&nbsp; Um... oh... Billy Talent - man, their lead singer is intense!&nbsp; I didn't feel like fighting the crowd to see bands that I only kinda' liked this time.&nbsp; Oh well.   I didn't buy anything this year.&nbsp; Kind of a bummer, as I need new shirts at least.&nbsp; Maybe in a few weeks when the Pitt. one rolls around I'll feel like buying stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was drawn to the NOFX hoodie that simply has a characature of&nbsp;Bush in a cowboy hat that reads 'Idiot Son of an Asshole'.&nbsp; (By far one of my favorite NOFX songs... lyrics to come.&nbsp; Even if you've never heard it, you'll laugh.)   Well, I'm going to&nbsp;go shower, as I haven't done that since yesterday morning.&nbsp; Eck. lol

      (lyric: 'Bonus Mosh Pt. 2', Taking Back Sunday)   The new TBS CD is out on Tuesday.&nbsp; I've heard 4 songs so far, and I'm excited.&nbsp;   I'm bored.&nbsp; For as much as I bitch about work, I get horribly bored when I'm home alone all day.&nbsp; I'm not really 'alone' per say, but I might as well be.&nbsp; I can't think of anything to do.&nbsp; Except maybe clean my room, and I dread that.&nbsp; If I clean it, my cousin (who shares my tiny living space) will have her clothes thrown all over 10 minutes later.&nbsp; She has more clothes than any 4 people combined.&nbsp; I'm not kidding - it drives me insane.&nbsp; And she never cleans up after herself.&nbsp; I'm going to stop talking about it before I get bitchy.&nbsp; lol   I talked to Ev online a few minutes ago.&nbsp; He and Rave are going shopping for a few last minute things. *sigh* I thought I could at least hang out with him a bit before he leaves tomorrow.&nbsp; I'm bummed that I don't see him as often lately.&nbsp; I'm glad he's so happy with Rave, though.&nbsp; He's a good guy.&nbsp; (Rave and I dated&nbsp;a little bit ages ago... weird how things worked out, huh?) lol   So I'm trying to satiate my boredom by downloading&nbsp;the rest&nbsp;of the Straylight Run songs...&nbsp; They're so good.&nbsp; I&nbsp;wish they'd get their CD out...  I feel kind of nauseous today.&nbsp; And my neck is&nbsp; aching... Kind of a yucky day.&nbsp; It's nice outside, though.&nbsp; I want to take my lounge chair to the beach and read, but I'm afraid to go by myself.  It's supposed to rain in Cleveland tomorrow.&nbsp; 'Early morning showers', so hopefully it'll clear up by 11:00 or so.&nbsp; It'll probably rain just enough to make it unbearably humid. Bleh.&nbsp; That happened a few years ago, and and everyone you saw there was just drenched&nbsp;in sweat all day long (ourselves included).&nbsp; It was pretty nasty. lol&nbsp; My brother and two of my cousins are going with me tomorrow.&nbsp; It should be fun.&nbsp; I'll be going with a slightly different&nbsp;group to the&nbsp;Pittsburgh date.&nbsp; I miss the whole crew we used to bring...&nbsp;It used to&nbsp;be the highlight of my entire summer.&nbsp; It still is, I guess.&nbsp; But it's not the same.&nbsp; Getting older sucks sometimes.  I guess I could go grocery shopping.&nbsp; I must go grocery shopping twice a week, I swear.&nbsp; I'm such an airhead sometimes.&nbsp; I'll buy hamburger buns, and forget the Boca burgers.&nbsp; Or I'll buy everything to make tacos and forget the taco shells.&nbsp; I did it again this week, so I guess I should make another trip to the store.&nbsp; Not only that, but I'm needing a sugar fix, and&nbsp;I'm out of Cool Whip.&nbsp; I've been&nbsp;eating ice cream cones filled with frozen, fat-free Cool Whip.&nbsp; Whoo.&nbsp;  I don't know.&nbsp; I'm just bored and want to hang out with someone to do... a whole lot of nothing today.

      (lyric: 'Mistakes We Knew We Were Making', Straylight Run) &nbsp; My mind has been wandering all day, and I am horribly turned on right now...  &nbsp;  Confessions:  &nbsp;  I’m 26 years old, and I’ve had sex with one guy. *blush*&nbsp; And it’s been almost 4 years since that ended.&nbsp; I am so sexually repressed it’s ridiculous.&nbsp; On top of that, I live in a very small house with 5 other people (a.k.a. ‘No alone time’…lol)  &nbsp;  I don’t know why… I’m really shy, of course.&nbsp; I grew up in a terribly prudish house. (My mom doesn’t think anyone should even date until they’re 21…lol)&nbsp; And I’m scared to death of serious relationships.&nbsp; I guess I’m not good with committing… to anything!&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; Maybe  that’s  why... &nbsp;  I’ve fooled around with…um. Two other guys.&nbsp; (Both of which were just really good friends, not someone I was dating.)&nbsp; Is that bad?&nbsp; Is that a ridiculously low number?&nbsp; I don’t know.&nbsp; I try to avoid talking about these things, because I feel horribly naïve sometimes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure why I had to get all that off my chest... &nbsp;  Okay, I feel silly.&nbsp; Moving on…  &nbsp;  Music News of the day:&nbsp; Fred Hell is quitting the band, Tiger Army.&nbsp; I’m bummed.&nbsp; Tiger Army is one of the bands I really wanted to see on Warped.&nbsp; (They’re still playing, just with a different drummer).&nbsp; I met them all two years ago and they were really cool.&nbsp; (Geoff was my buddy because of my really old AFI shirt I wore.&nbsp; Whoo!&nbsp; lol.)&nbsp; I guess his quitting is due to health reasons.&nbsp; (He was shot 4 times last spring, and nearly died when someone broke into his house…scary shit.)&nbsp; We saw them back in… November?&nbsp; He seemed to be playing well then.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That sucks.  &nbsp;  I can’t wait for Friday.&nbsp; I’m really excited about Tiger Army, Anti-Flag, Flogging Molly, NOFX, Taking Back Sunday, Alkaline Trio, Bad Religion… !&nbsp; I kinda want to see New Found Glory, Billy Talent, and Sugarcult.&nbsp; I just hope our favorites aren’t playing at the same time.&nbsp; I hate when that happens.&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp; I’m such a dork.  &nbsp;  Well, I’m getting nothing accomplished here at work (obviously).&nbsp; I have no ambition today (what else is new?).&nbsp; I had planned to get caught up, but it’s not working out that way.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; I wish I knew what was wrong with me.&nbsp; I have a pile of work on my desk, and I just want to be done with it... but when it comes time for me to actually do the work, my mind shuts down.&nbsp; I've been seriously burned out for weeks.&nbsp; Maybe this little mini-vacation will change things.&nbsp; I hope so.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Ev called me last night and told me that he and Rave are going on vacation (again!).&nbsp; I'm glad Rave's jobs are&nbsp;going so well, but sheesh!&nbsp; They just got back from Florida a bit ago!&nbsp; They're going hiking in Aspen.&nbsp; (Rave's parents own a timeshare,&nbsp; so they're always off to fun places in some ritzy hotel...) *sigh*&nbsp; Rave&nbsp;wanted&nbsp;to go during ski season, but settled for&nbsp;the off season so they could go to Florida, too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ev is a nervous wreck as usual.&nbsp; I think it's a little better than last time, though.&nbsp;   Oh well. I guess I should get some work done.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; Or I could talk to Allen.&nbsp; Yeah, Allen wins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;

              (lyric : ‘So Much’ - The Spill Canvas)  I don’t like thinking of titles for my blogs, so from here on out, I’ll be using a random quote or lyric.  &nbsp;  Seems there’s always one floating around in my head.     I started something new on Friday. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Every time I have a $1 bill, I’m putting it in my red crayon bank. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I probably have $8 in there from over the weekend. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I don’t know how long it will last though… probably until next Wednesday when I start scraping for gas money.&nbsp; &nbsp;lol&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, I hope I don’t touch it, as I’m saving to treat myself to something nice… ;)  My neck hurts very badly today.   I need a nice long neckrub… Actually, while we’re at it, I need a full-time masseuse.      urlLink Schwarzenegger Calls Dems ‘Girlie Men’  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Oh yeah? &nbsp;&nbsp;  And republicans are doody-heads. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Lame-ass.  Went shopping with my sister yesterday.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I bought some jeans that are a size smaller than usual, so I’m happy. &nbsp;&nbsp;  My clothes are all getting baggy and looking ridiculous. &nbsp;That was exciting. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I don’t hang with her often, as we only seem to hang out when her boyfriend is out of town. &nbsp;&nbsp;  She’s driving me insane…! &nbsp;&nbsp;  She doesn’t put her cell phone down, ever. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Seriously. &nbsp;&nbsp;  She won’t go anywhere after a certain time, and she won’t go past a certain point because she ‘might not get a signal’ and he might call her. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Eck.&nbsp;  &nbsp; If I ever get that obsessive over a guy, shoot me in the freakin’ face. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Thank god he’s only gone for two weeks.  I ran into a friend from high school at Wal-Mart yesterday. &nbsp;&nbsp;  We had a brief ‘how are you’- type exchange. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I wish I had stopped to talk to him. &nbsp;&nbsp;  We didn’t hang out a lot, but he was always funny and extremely nice to me. &nbsp;&nbsp;  For some reason, I was too shy to talk more. &nbsp;&nbsp;  He works there, so maybe next time I’ll be braver. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I’d like to know what else he’s been up to.  I wish I knew when I suddenly got this shy. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I wasn’t always like this!   Last summer at Warped Tour, I stood about 4 feet away from this guy I had a crush on in high school.&nbsp; We always got along okay. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I did one of those ‘pretend I didn’t notice him’ things because I was suddenly  horribly  shy. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I glanced at him and we made eye contact, though. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I’m pretty sure he thinks I’m just a bitch. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I’d really like to just talk and see what he’s been up to. &nbsp;&nbsp;  We always had so much in common – he was an amazing artist.&nbsp; I wonder if he’s done anything with that talent. &nbsp;&nbsp;  He wanted to go into comics… but so did I at one point. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I’ve seen him at couple of other times since, and we’ve pretty much ignored each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;  *sigh*&nbsp;  &nbsp; I wish I knew what was wrong with me. &nbsp;&nbsp;  It makes me feel awful when people think I don’t like them, when in reality it’s just my painful shyness.  I hate summer.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I’m tired of shaving my legs . &nbsp;&nbsp;  *laugh* &nbsp;&nbsp;  I bought a waxing kit last night for the first time ever. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I only have two things to say:    ‘Ow .’ And ‘ Hold me .’ &nbsp;&nbsp;  *whimper*&nbsp;&nbsp; (At the same time, I kinda liked it. Heh. I'm weird.)&nbsp; It had better last ‘weeks’ as promised.&nbsp;  &nbsp; lol &nbsp;&nbsp;  They look and feel nice, though. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Now if only I could tan…  &nbsp; I’m so pale! &nbsp;&nbsp;  I hide from the sun. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Must be that Irish blood in me.  I’m trying really hard to get caught up with work before I go. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I’m taking a 5-day mini-vacation from Wednesday through Sunday. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I can’t wait. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Warped Tour is Friday, then Saturday (I think) I’m going with my aunt and little cousin to the zoo.&nbsp;&nbsp;   She’s going to be 3 years old next week. &nbsp;&nbsp;  She’s the most adorable kid I’ve ever seen. &nbsp;&nbsp;  (And I don’t typically like kids…) &nbsp;&nbsp;  My cousin, sister, and I take her out occasionally when her mom needs a break. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I’m afraid we spoil her silly, though. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Every time we walk in, she asks if we’re going to Chuck E. Cheese. &nbsp;&nbsp;  *giggle* &nbsp;&nbsp;  My brother and I are going to another local show on Sunday – some good name bands. &nbsp;&nbsp;  We don’t get too many signed bands playing here, so I don’t want to miss it. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Unfortunately, It’s on the east side *gah!*, which I hate. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I’ve never driven there myself. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Hopefully I can kick my own ass and get there. &nbsp;&nbsp;  *sigh* &nbsp;&nbsp;  As for the rest of the week -   I hope to stay up too late every night talking to Allen, and hopefully hanging with Ev one day.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I should be good and worn out by the time I go back to work on Monday.     *sigh* I need a hug.  I have 6 CDs here with me today: Franz Ferdinand, Tiger Army, Morrissey, The Code, Desaparecidos, and The Cure. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I’m tempted to start dancing back here in my windowless, airless office, as I’ve had ‘Boys Don’t Cry’ on repeat for the last 15 minutes…   There’s something oddly sexy about that song. &nbsp;&nbsp;  If my boss wasn’t here today, I probably would.     I’ve been reading a little of everything lately, none of it seriously.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I started a book on hypnotism   (it’s always fascinated me) , I’m reading a book called ‘A World of Ideas : A Dictionary of Important Ideas and Thinkers’, which breaks down some philosophical stuff easily for a layperson like me. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I’m reading ‘the Buying of the President 2004’, and I’ve started Terry Pratchett’s ‘Discworld’ series, which I haven’t read in ages…    I guess I have a whole lot of nothing to say. I feel horribly uninteresting lately.

        Oooh. Blogger   did   change their interface. I likey. I can change my font colors... And I don't have to type around those HTML tags... wheee!      An older woman came into the library today, targeting me with her petition to ban gay marriage.     I’m not sure why people always come to me with stuff.      You can bet if there’s a kid selling something, a charitable cause, etc., they zero in on me.      Probably because I’m ‘too nice’.  So  this woman (who I don’t particularly care for anyway – she’s rude and  downright nasty) asks me if I’d like to sign her petition.     Apparently it’s being sponsored by a big right-wing Christian organization.     She got really pissy with me when I declined.     “Marriage is under attack!   We must rise to defend it!”     I have a better idea.     Get your freakin’ nose out of other people’s business.     If you’re so worried about ‘who’s fucking who’,   maybe you should go fuck yourself.     Yes, elderly woman: Go…fuck…yourself.   Our constitution cannot be changed to reflect each person’s individual moral values.     I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again – You can’t govern morality. *grr*   Since we’re talking about morality  – let’s talk about sex toys, shall we?   lol.  So  Evan and I were talking about this yesterday… We were laughing about  when you have your cell phone on vibrate…. and forget…and it’s in your pocket… lol… Anyway, he told me he heard about this ringer thing you  can buy for your cell phone… um… I can’t exactly describe it.      So read:   urlLink Hold the Phone, It’s a Sex Toy    When he told me about this, I didn’t believe him.     So I tried to look it up for myself.   Well, I found the article.     But I also found this:   urlLink Dial An Orgasm   (Click it. Don't worry. Just sex toys, no porn. lol.)     Quote: ‘Give someone an orgasm from another state!’         It’s hilarious! (And oddly intriguing…)         lol.     Okay.         But here’s a question.         What is this really for?        Is it a just a gag gift thing?         Maybe for travel use?!         For ‘on the go’?!         *giggle*         But imagine the possibilities.       The endless fun you could have calling your partner every few minutes!        It’s just too bad you won’t be able to talk to them while you get off.        Unless you each had two phones…. Hmmm... *laugh*

      I just received a local concert/show newsletter, and I've been thinking about how much I learned from growing up in this scene.  I feel old.  Most of the people who hang out there are younger than me now.  Still, there’s a few veterans like myself who go and remember when punk wasn’t the ‘cool’ thing to listen to.     What I've learned so far...   The Clash is the greatest punk band ever.    Everything can be 'customized' (aka 'made better') with safetly pins, duct tape, and/or Sharpie markers.  It's okay to question your government.    If you call yourself 'punk', you're probably not.  If you try too hard to ‘look’ punk, you’re  probably a poser. lol.  If you're in the pit, make sure someone has your back at all times.  If someone goes down, circle like wolves!  Tim Armstrong puts on a hell of a show.  Even when he almost falls on you, because he's apparently drunk off his ass.  Singing about killing babies and raping mothers is not cool.  Unless you’re the Misfits.  Stop arguing about who ‘sold out’.  If you like the music, listen to it.  Warped Tour gives you something worth living for all year long.  No, really.  Some of the greatest times of my life are Warped-related.  You need no music on the 2 ½ hour drive home from Warped.  Everyone will have hilarious stories.   If they pertain to the band Simple Plan, they’re even funnier.  When parking at Warped Tour, never park in within two miles of a power plant.  Even if there’s 50 other cars around you.  You will be fined.   If you're ever in a really shitty venue where you're packed in with no elbow or breathing room AND you're claustrophobic and suffer panic attacks, move towards the wall immediately.  If you fail to reach the wall before the crowd push, you will fall and be trampled.  Fortunately there will be 6 people trying desperately to pick you up.   Which brings me to the most important fact: It really is all about 'unity'.    So I'm a nostalgia freak.

      I’m feeling kind of mopey today for no good reason.  I don’t know what happened.  I was in a very good mood last night and this morning.    *sigh* I need something new.  I need things to *happen*.  I need some space.  I’m feeling as though I’m suffocating, and I’m getting more and more neurotic each day.  The funny thing is, if I got my own place I’d be even more insane.  First of all, I could barely afford my own apartment.  I couldn’t live by myself, because I’m pathetic and would never sleep, probably crying half the night because I was alone.   lol.  I’m feel like I’ll never get past this stupid driving anxiety.  It makes me feel very silly, since it’s something most people take for granted.  I really need to get past it, because it’s stopped me from doing things that I want to do.  Oh, don’t get me wrong.  I’m okay.  I’m not really sad or upset.  I’m kind of  void of emotion right now.  Don’t worry.  This will pass in ten minutes or so… lol  *to myself* I know, I know.  You can’t just wait for things to happen.  You have to make them happen.  The driving thing is getting better…  If you stopped buying so many frikkin’ CDs, maybe you could afford your own place.  As for living by yourself – well, good luck finding someone who’ll put up with you.  Lol  *deep breath*  Sorry… every so often I need to vent.

      Your favorite civil rights defender, checking in!    Though I love my two loyal readers dearly, I'm writing in hopes that I reach a few more people today.  Maybe I'm a liberal bastard.  But I can't understand why anyone would go out of their way to deny happiness to some people.    In less than 48 hours, Congress will vote on an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would permanently deny marriage equality to same-sex couples. This is unprecedented - never before has our Constitution been amended to take away anyone's rights. We've got to fight back!  Moveon.org has constructed an emergency petition to urge Congress to vote against this outrageous disregard for civil rights.  Tell Bush that editing the constitution for your own personal beliefs will not be tolerated!     urlLink United, Not Divided!  PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION   From Moveon.org:  President Bush campaigned on a promise to unite us, not divide us. Yet today, as people are questioning Bush's handling of everything from the war in Iraq to the economy, Bush and his friends are trying to distract voters from the real issues by turning to the politics of division and hate.  If America stands for anything, it stands for equal rights and opportunities for everyone. Throughout our history, we've struggled to guarantee that equality: ending slavery; securing voting rights for women; and passing the Civil Rights Act just 40 years ago.  Equality in marriage is the civil rights issue of our generation. We can't let anyone, or any group, be singled out for discrimination based on who they are or who they love.  When two people make a deep personal commitment, taking responsibility for each other and doing all the work of marriage, they should be able to share in the legal benefits of marriage as well. These benefits include access to health care and medical decision-making for one's partner and children, parenting and immigration rights, inheritance, taxation, and Social Security benefits.  This isn't a partisan issue, notwithstanding Bush's pandering to his right-wing base. Former President Gerald Ford, a Republican, said this about same-sex couples and marriage: "I think they ought to be treated equally. Period."1 Also, many major corporations, including Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Disney, Coors, and IBM, offer health insurance and other benefits to their employees' same-sex partners. Senator Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) says the amendment is "Nuts... To be seen as the party that's coming between two people that love each other doing what they want to do... to me that's going to be seen as a liability, politically."2  Yet President Bush is bent on moving America backward, by enshrining discrimination in the United States Constitution.  Don't let him divide us like this. Go to:     http://www.moveon.org/unitednotdivided/  Please help make sure your friends have signed on too, before we deliver this petition tomorrow.  Thank you.

      I’ll never understand how someone can be surrounded by people all day, and still feel lonely.  That’s how I’ve been for quite awhile.  But I feel very silly lately.  I feel loved.  I’m feeling very much like I matter to someone, and it’s a good feeling.  I’ve made a very good friend (and dreaming buddy) in the past few weeks, and he makes me smile all too much.  Sorry.  I don’t know where that came from.  I talked to Ev last night for a bit.  I don’t see him as often as I used to.  It’s okay, because we both have our own things going on.  Anyway, he spoke to his parents last night, which he hasn’t done in months.  Of course, it got him pretty upset.  His mom wants to see him.  His dad says he ‘can move back home if he stops acting like an idiot’ (a.k.a. ‘stop seeing Rave’).  *sigh*  Poor Evy.     A few random thoughts:   urlLink  Officials discuss how to delay Election Day   Maybe I’m crazy.  But this just seems all too convenient…  I’m also expecting us to ‘capture’ Bin Laden a month or two before the elections.  That should pull in the swing voters!  P.S. – I think we’ve already ‘got him’.  There’s a few Pakistani news sites claiming he’s been caught… Oh yeah, and gas prices will probably drop too.  Here’s a great article from one of my favorite websites (Common Dreams):   urlLink  Experts warn of Potential Problems With Electronic Voting Machines  Does anyone think it’s weird that Bush has been pushing so hard for these electronic voting machines?  It seems kind of odd.  No one’s worried about this?    And one more link for anyone who reads this:   urlLink Free the West Memphis Three     I’ve been really fascinated with this case for years now.  DNA testing was finally ordered for the case last month – 10 years after the trio was already convicted of murder.  So many things don’t add up, it’s ridiculous… There are two documentaries about the case; ‘Paradise Lost’ and ‘Paradise Lost II’ which will make you lose faith in our entire legal system.  Whether you believe they’re innocent (as I do) or not, they at least deserve a fair trial.    That’s all for now.  God, I’m boring lately.

      I've been pondering the whole Nick Berg issue.  Berg (in case you've been living under a rock) was one of the troops beheaded (supposedly) in response to US treatment of prisoners in Iraq.    Now I'm not shocking you when I say I'm a big doubter of the U.S. Propaganda Machine.  I'm also not shocking you when I say I've got my own little conspiracy theory going on...   Now I'm not the only person who thinks there was something weird going on.  This whole thing started churning in my head when I read this article at Rense.com:   urlLink Why Did the U.S. Take Custody of Nick Berg?   Now this in itself is just... weird.  So I started checking out other websites...and found this mind-blowing piece... Consider the following observations brought to you by Infowars.com:   urlLink Fishy Circumstances and Flawed Timelines Surround American's Beheading    I watched the video a few times (which I couldn't bring myself to do before), and can absolutely see ALL of the points made in this article.  It's really quite amazing to think about...  So I think I have 2 loyal readers left.  Anyone have an opinion on this whole thing?  Does anyone care about this crap other than me?  lol.

      Nothing really to blog about... I just feel really empty if I don't write something every once in awhile.    Wait!  Here's a good embarrassing story.  Today is Ev's day off.  When I tried to call his cell this afternoon, he didn't answer it - which is not like Evan at all.  So I checked online - not there.  All I can think of is that his depression has hit him again and he's bawling in the dark somewhere (It doesn't happen too often, but occasionally...).  So I drove to his house.  His car was in the driveway, but he didn't answer the door when I knocked.  Now I'm really nervous, so I try the door - it's open, so I let myself in.      I heard this muffled, indecipherable noise (sobbing?) coming from Ev's room.  Well, let's just say I walked in on something I didn't really need to see.  Rave took the day off because his car was in the shop, and... well... I think you can figure out the rest.  *blush*  Ack!  Needless to say, that was the shortest visit ever.  lol.  I feel like such an ass.  Evy, I'm so sorry!!!  (You guys were far too nice about the whole ordeal...!)  Heh.  You have to admit, it makes for a fun blog story though.  I'm sitting home alone right now.  I'm blowing off work for the second day in a row.  My intent was to catch up on some sleep, as I've been a pretty regular insomniac recently.  Of course, whenever I have the chance to sleep in, I bolt awake after 4 or 5 hours.  I'm not really sure why that keeps happening.    I've been feeling very odd lately.  It's a good feeling, but strange.  I'm quite not sure how to explain it... I'm not used to feeling good so much.  Not that I'm down all the time, but I usually range somewhere between apathetic and somewhat empty.  lol   *sigh*  I need something to do!  I'm antsy today.  Since I can't sleep , now I'm kinda' bummed out that I'm home.  I get so restless when I'm alone with nothing to do.    Maybe I'll take my car for that long-overdue oil change today.  Or I could mutilate/modify the new shirts I bought yesterday.  Or maybe I'll just take my new lounge chair down to the shitty beach and read instead.  (Heh - the shitty beach as compared to the nice beaches... The shitty ones would be 2 miles down the road from me.  Our side of the lake isn't the beautiful, well-maintained tourist trap part... lol)  Oh well.  Till later.

      (hehehe.  Has anyone seen 'Head of State'?  I oddly enjoyed it.)   Ev and Rave got home late last night.  I talked to Evan for about five minutes.  He had a rough flight home.  They hit some bad turbulence… which triggered a panic attack… which made him hyperventilate, which triggered an asthma attack… The poor boy was exhausted.    Aside from that, it sounds like he *gasp* actually had fun.  lol.  John Kerry chose John Edwards as his running mate today.  I liked Edwards (well, as far as politicians go…), so that’s good.  And (quite frankly) I think he has far more ‘elect-ability’ over the other possible candidates.  So it’s a good ‘business decision’ as well.  I guess it wouldn’t matter who it was.  Anyone but Bush.    Happy (delayed) 4th, by the way from your favorite Anti-Patriot.  Hope your fireworks were pretty.  Yeah.  Anti-Patriot.  There, I said it again.  Let me start by saying that ‘Anti-Patriot’ does  not  mean ‘Anti-American’.  Now before you jump down my throat…   From Merriam-Webster:   Main Entry:  pa·tri·ot    Pronunciation: 'pA-trE-&t, -"ät, chiefly British 'pa-trE-&t Function: noun Etymology: Middle French patriote compatriot, from Late Latin patriota, from Greek patriOtEs, from patria lineage, from patr-, patEr father : one who loves his or her country and supports its authority and interests     Huh.  Supports it’s authority and interests?  Well, in this political climate I think there’s a lot of people who can’t consider themselves patriots.    I just don’t understand how that mindset is so revered…   I think it’s great to be happy where you are.  I’m  glad  I live in the US.   Not  proud.  I’m not proud of where I live – no more than I’m proud of my skin color.  Why are the two any different?  Maybe I’m reaching a bit by equating patriotism with racism, but the same underlying themes seem to keep surfacing.    I don’t know.  I’m having trouble phrasing this… Patriotism, to me, is a feeling (not just of pride or love, but) of superiority – and I don’t like that.  Flags divide us.  I think it distances us from other countries when we’re blindly waving our flags and chanting “Go USA!” (unless it’s the Olympics or something…lol).   When we break down those barriers and start seeing each other as human beings (instead of Americans, or Canadians, or whatever), that’s when change can begin.  (As the anarchists all cheer… lol)  Anarchy is great in theory.  In my opinion, it would never work in practice.  People are far too greedy.  I don’t know how you can change the system when you try so hard to distance yourself from it.  Still, I’ve had great conversations with some passionate anarchists that have made me ponder my entire political theory, and I thank them for their mind-blowing points of view.   I could argue this crap all day.  But for your sake, I’ll just leave you with this:   urlLink Burning River Revolutionary Anarchist Collective  - read their ‘Points of ‘Unity’ page.     “Not proud of my skin. Not proud of where I live. I’m fucking proud of who I am.” – Anti-Flag  Unity. No Borders. No Nations. No Flags. No Patriots.

      I bought a CD today - Jamie Cullum.  He's a jazz pianist that sounds a bit like Harry Connick, Jr. in his younger days... The deciding factor in my purchasing it was a cover of Jeff Buckley's 'Lover, You Should Have Come Over'.  Jeff Buckley, in my opinion, had the most potential of any artist at the time of his death.  He had the most insanely amazing voice, and incredible range... Such a shame.  It's a sad story...  I saw the small Buckley traveling exhibit at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame last summer. I actually teared up as I read those handwritten lyrics and letters to Jeff from Elvis Costello... (I'm such a dork!)  I was kneeling down in front of the glass case, reading - somewhat in awe of this small scrap of paper filled with the words that had shaped the last few years of my life.  Suddenly these people came up behind me.  They were talking to each other: "Who the hell is Jeff Buckley?"  "I don't know.  I've never heard of him." *sigh*  It's silly, but I get very attached to songs and the musicians who write them.  Jeff Buckley is one of those.  And Matthew Sweet.  Conor Oberst from Bright Eyes is another.  My not-so-obvious one is Dr. Frank from the Mr. T Experience... I know it doesn't fit in with the other musical geniuses.  lol  But I've been listening to the 'MTX' for...10 years?  His lyrics are witty and kinda silly, I guess.  But Frank seemed to go through depression about the same time I did.  He somehow managed to make fun of himself throughout the whole ordeal -I wished I could do that so badly! 'That Prozac Moment', 'Semi-OK', 'Even Hitler Had a Girlfriend'...   He was depressing in a self-deprecating but funny way... Somehow it always seemed to cheer me up (and still does).  I met him back in February and wanted to tell him all of this.  How much his music meant to me, how he got me through high school, how his songs had been good friends to me throughout both good and horrible times... Instead I just got really stupid and embarrassed.  I stuttered something (I don't know what)... He was really cool and tried to make conversation, but I was so flustered.  lol  I do have a really stupid looking picture me with him on my dresser, though.  I met the rest of MTX and they were really cool, too.  And I didn't stutter like an idiot.  lol  I've met a lot of cool bands and people - The Vandals, Tiger Army, Our Lady Peace, H2O, Jade from AFI, Something Corporate, The Dropkick Murphys, Anti-Flag...oh, and Wee Man (from 'Jackass' fame. lol)... But I've never acted like such an idiot as when I met Doc Frank... lol  Anyway... Marvel at the genius that is Buckley:    Lover, You Should`ve Come Over  - Jeff Buckley     Looking out the door i see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners Parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water  And maybe i'm too young to keep good love from going wrong  But tonight you're on my mind so you never know   When i'm broken down and hungry for your love with no way to feed it  Where are you tonight, child you know how much i need it  Too young to hold on and too old to just break free and run   Sometimes a man gets carried away, when he feels like he should be having his fun  And much too blind to see the damage he's done  Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one   So i'll wait for you... and i'll burn  Will I ever see your sweet return  Oh will I ever learn  Oh lover, you should've come over  'Cause it's not too late  Lonely is the room, the bed is made, the open window lets the rain in  Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him  My body turns and yearns for a sleep that will never come  It's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder  It's never over, all my riches for her smiles when i slept so soft against her  It's never over, all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter  It's never over, she's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever  Well maybe i'm just too young  To keep good love from going wrong  Oh... lover, you should've come over  'Cause it's not too late   Well I feel too young to hold on  And i'm much too old to break free and run  Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage i've done Sweet lover, you should've come over  Oh, love well i'm waiting for you   Lover, you should've come over 'Cause it's not too late

      So our computer tech guy was working on our computers today.  I was at the circulation desk, waiting on a patron… He was crawling around on the floor unhooking things, and suddenly he popped his head up.  This old lady (caught by surprise) looked at me and  started laughing hysterically.  She said, “Oh!  What else do you have hiding down there?!”  *laugh*  I (now embarrassed), just blushed and said, “Yeah, well he is pretty cute, isn’t he?”  Now our tech-ie is just blushing fiercely, as he’s easily embarrassed as well.  And she replied, “Yeah, honey.  He is!  You should hook up with him!”    Alright, old ladies that use the term ‘hook up’… it’s just funny.  I think I was hit on by a girl today for the first time in my life.  But I’m so naïve, I had a 20 minute conversation with her before I realized it.  lol    Random things that have crossed my mind today while I’m working:   *sigh* What I wouldn’t give for some lip-gloss right now.  (I’m a flavored lip-gloss fiend.)  Evan and Rave ‘get it on’ (for lack of a friendlier term) a minimum of 3 times a day.  I’m not gettin’ any.  Bush’s approval rating is at an all-time low.  But it’s not low enough.  I need to go buy the new ‘Tiger Army’ and ‘The Code’ CDs tonight.  Remember when Chris said, “If I saw pudding walking down the street, I’d rape it in the ass!”?  I wonder if anyone else in the world is as obsessed with those cheesy paintings of big-eyed children and animals from the 60s.    How can you be the boss of someplace when you can’t understand basic procedures – that you put in place?  Teabagging.  (Uh…I just watched the movie ‘Pecker’…lol)    Pondering my little Buddhist ‘wisdom card of the day’:  “Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.”    *sigh*  My mind won’t shut off.

       “Well I'm in business... business of kicking your ass and let me tell you business is booming. I'm open for business. Business of giving you the business. Up your butt. Did you hear me say that?”  - Meatwad, from last night’s ‘Aqua Teen Hunger Force’  Gaah!  Chris (who I haven’t seen in weeks) just stopped by on his way to work to deliver a handful of pictures from the last few weeks at the club.  (He’s a picture-taking fiend.)   I don’t think I stopped saying ‘awww’ for ten minutes.   Cute-sy pictures of his beautiful self with a very beautiful Matt (his next probable victim… *sigh*) and the sweetest picture I’ve ever seen of Rave with his arm around a clearly anxiety-stricken Evan.    (I don’t know why, but occasionally Ev volunteers to go to the clubs with them.  Probably not the best idea when you have horrible social anxiety disorder….  I’m sure he just goes because Rave likes to.)    Chris is a sweet guy.  It’s a shame he’s such a whore.  I’ve never seen anything like it! He can just narrow his eyes and lock into his ‘come hither’ supermodel stare, and people fall at his feet.  Girls, guys, straight, gay, bi…Everyone.  It’s sickening.  And of course, he’s soo personable.  He takes care of himself very well.  I’ve yet to have a manicure, and he has one every other week… lol  He dresses in a way that no one else could pull off.  He commands attention - sometimes I wish I had (just a little of) that power… and I promise I wouldn’t abuse it like he does!  lol     But in reality, I am extremely shy and boring.  I’m a really casual kinda’ girl.  I’m happiest in jeans and a t-shirt (oh, and lots of cute jewelry/accessories…).  I’m pretty low-maintenance.  Swanky settings make me nervous.   I’d rather be home drawing, or watching a movie, or in a broken-down concert venue…or something lame like that…  I guess I’ve never been very materialistic – I didn’t want those designer label clothes that everyone had in high school.  I never wanted a really nice car.  I always felt different than those other kids, because those kinds of things just didn’t matter to me.  I didn’t really care if I fit in or not.  And I guess some things never change. When I go shopping with my sister or cousin I just can’t see paying $30 or $40 for a pair of jeans that were made in a sweatshop by a 5-year-old child who earned $.50.  It sickens me.    (Okay, when it comes to my 700+ CD collection, I guess I’m a bit materialistic.  But we all have our vices, right?  …right?  Someone back me up here…!)  Where Chris moves from one relationship to the next in rapid-fire fashion, I have had one serious relationship in my life (Mostly because I manage to fuck up somehow… lol… see previous posts).  I’m not sure why I can’t let anyone get close to me.  I crave to have an honest, open relationship, but at the same time I am absolutely terrified of it.  Eck.  I just hate feeling vulnerable.    Anyway… um… Yeah.  Still nothing to really talk about.  Lots of political bitching in my head, but it all seems too tedious to think about right now.  I’m in such a somber political mood right now.  The ‘war’ seems all but hopeless. Does anyone else feel that way?    The 9/11 commission has stated that there was no link between Hussein and Al-Queda… so why do all the polls keep showing that an overwhelming majority of people still believe there was?  Wait, I said I wouldn’t think about this… Aaagh!

      I went to see Harry Connick Jr. tonight. How can I describe the show in one word? Wonderful. Breathtaking. Magical. lol He's an entertainer in the highest sense of the word. He's so funny. What other jazz pianist would tell a story about how he wants to kill Russell Crowe? C'mon! That's great.  Went to dinner with the crew tonight (consisting of: two of my aunts, two cousins, and my cousin's wife) at a somewhat expensive Italian restaurant. Everyone raved about the food... I wasn't impressed. When you pay $12 for ravioli, I think you should get more than 5. Not that I could have eaten much more than that, but that averages $2.40 per ravioli. Yes, the entire time I was there, I was doing math in my head. lol You see, since my aunt bought us tickets, we said we'd buy dinner for her and her husband. $100 for 4 of us to eat. I'm so cheap. I thought that was insane.  So, we had the 'cheap' tickets.  $40.  We were in the very back row.  Now I should tell you about the theater... It's absolutely gorgeous and extravagant. It was probably in it's heyday in the 40s, but it's all been renovated. It's just... amazing. Beautiful... Anyway, there's not a bad seat in the house.  So we're sitting in our back row seats...which aren't bad at all, really. Five minutes before the show starts, an usher asks us if we want front row seats. Gah! Apparently they didn't sell out those $85 seats, and they were empty. We were whisked away to the third row. Close enough, my cousin observed, to get spit on. lol The show itself was amazing. The band was incredible, and of course, Harry's voice was dead-on. I met him after the show and he signed my ticket stub. *sigh*   I need a boy who can sing me to sleep.  He doesn't even have to be good at it. ;)   It was a good night.  Fun time with the family.

      (Lyric: ‘Take Me Out’, Franz Ferdinand)  I’m restless. I want to go home.  Fuck working.   lol  Chris and Matt just stopped in on their way to work. I was pretty excited.  I haven’t seen them in awhile!  (Not many guys could get away with a long-sleeved hot pink shirt and a skinny black tie… Somehow Chris manages.  lol)  Chris is such an ass - after throwing me against a shelf and kissing my neck like crazy, he managed to hit on two other girls and a guy before he left.  Gah.  First off, he’s going to get me in trouble at work.  lol  Second, he knows my neck is extremely ticklish, and likes to tease me.  lol  I’m not sure why I put up with him, the cocky bastard.  Alright, alright.  He’s not so bad.  He’s very good to me.  Usually.  A little over-protective.   I just wish that I could exude that sexy confidence he has. *sigh*  Oh well.  So I took my break with them, and got Matt to admit that he’s slept with Chris.  lol  But “just once!” and he “wasn’t really into it”.   lol  Still, Chris acts pretty friendly towards him.  Of course, he acts pretty friendly with everyone.  I think (though Matt doesn’t mind…He’s a sweet boy.  He’ll take all the cuddling he can get… lol) he’s kinda shy and he just goes along with it.  And he’s just  sooo  laid back.  ‘What? Chris wants to make out with me?  Umm, okay.’  Heh.  Chris invited me to go with him to the club this weekend. If I didn’t work, I’d actually consider it.  I need to do something completely out-of-character for me.  I’m not a partier.  Never have been.  But I feel the need to do something really stupid.  Maybe even dance. lol   Ev and Rave are going this weekend.  (Even though Ev hates clubs.  And crowds.  And people in general. lol)  Rave's been trying to DJ, and Ev's fascinated now, too.   Yuck.  My WeatherBug is giving me a storm warning:  “Hail To 1.5 Inches In Diameter...Thunderstorm Wind Gusts To 70 Mph...And Dangerous Lightning Are Possible In These Areas.”      That sucks!  I’m going to a Harry Connick, Jr. show tomorrow.  I’m excited.  I adore his music.  My only concern is this: What am I going to wear?  Now wait!   Don’t mock me yet!  It’s at this nice place where most people dress up… First of all, I’m a really casual girl.  I don’t have a lot of really nice clothes.  Second, the few things I did have are now too big on me.  Which is good.  But that leaves me with nothing.  Why can’t they just make clothing that shrinks with you?  Someone invent that!  lol  Hopefully between my cousin’s massive amounts of clothes and the stuff in the back of my closet, I can find  something …   12 more minutes, and I get to leave work.  Whoo-Hoo!

       (Quote: Ralph Waldo Emerson)  Someone said something to me the other day that sparked a whole lot of soul searching and meditation… I’ve been very pensive lately. I can’t get these thoughts out of my head. Stupid things that I’ve grudgingly learned in my short 26 years here…thoughts that seem sappy and very ‘Hallmark-card’… but they’re true.  I’ve been thinking about the amazing amount of potential each and every one of us has…the potential to be great, the potential to fulfill our dreams, the potential to make the world around us a better place with simply our smile or our kindness. How many times has your day been brightened by an unsuspecting individual? Maybe someone who compliments you.. Or that person who goes out of their way to hold a door for you. Or tries to help you with a heavy box or bag. Or that friend that knows when to hug you at just the right moment. Or maybe that sympathetic smile and help from a stranger when you drop the piles of books in your hand. lol All of these things are greatly appreciated. Never miss an opportunity to brighten someone’s day, and never take the kindness of others for granted.  ‘I won’t ask you what you think of me.  ‘Cause I’m exactly who I want to be’ – ‘Over It’, Matthew Sweet  Don’t compare yourself to anyone else. We each have our own special quirks, obsessions, and weaknesses. These are the things that make us the wonderful people we are; the things that make us endearing to the people around us. Never try to change yourself to impress another. Eventually that layer wears off, and you’re left with the ‘real you’… someone who was probably good enough anyway.  “You wanna drag me under?  Better take a number.” – ‘Who I Am’, Ashba  Don’t ever question yourself. And don’t worry about what people think! They don’t know you! They don’t know what you think, what you feel… They have no idea of what you’ve been through, or where you plan to go! When it comes right down to it, you are the only one who knows what’s best for you. Hold tight to your values, but be open-minded enough to respect other’s points of view.  “I will... not walk silently through this life… I will... never yield the passion in my soul… I will… not surrender what's inside, I could never! I will... not walk silently through this life... This is my promise…!” - ' Break the Silence’, The Code  Never stop fighting. Never. In your heart, you know what’s right. Let that passion live inside of you, and don’t let it burn out. Believe it, and fight for it. Don’t let negative assholes bring you down.  You can always push yourself just a little harder than you think you can. Be it physically, mentally, or emotionally. It’s true.  You can’t let shyness control your life. (This is a tough one for me.) How many times have you said or done something, then felt sick about it later…wondering how someone would react? You sit there in agony, wishing you’d never done it. But… that’s normal. Everyone feels that way. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Challenging yourself is the only way to progress in this life. (So go on! Make out with that cute guy with the blue Mohawk! You’ll probably never see him again anyway! Err… lol)  “When’s the last time I told my friends that they mean the world to me? When’s the last time I told her that ‘your eyes shine beautifully’? No one would ever know… how much I have to show…! ‘Cause if I died tomorrow… I’d hate to die full of so much sorrow. So every breath will be… the sweetest one for me.” – old local band, ‘Good Intentions’.  I miss you guys.  To those of you who have been reading my blog occasionally: Each one of you is very special to me. To my already good friends: I love you all madly. Your friendship means more to me than you will ever know. I don’t mean all of this to be inspirational. (Because I hate that inspirational crap as much as you do!) This is just how I’m feeling at this given moment in time. I’m not even sure I understand it all. I want all of this knowledge to wash over me, making me embrace life – living it on my own schedule. Without deadlines, without work restrictions! Without guilt or worry!  If you take any of this with you – if any of this resonated with you – remember this: You each have a gift. The potential for greatness. Maybe to the world. Maybe to your family or friends. Or maybe to that one special person. Dig down today and find that fire…that passion that keeps you going every day… If my words have meant anything to you, don’t sit there. Just get up and do it. Share yourself with the world.  With all the breath in my lungs, and all the love in my heart, Me.

      (Lyric: 'Alive With the Glory of Love', Say Anything)  I have to stop taking the beach for granted. I live only minutes away from the lake, yet only go there a few times a year. I should be there every night, for pete’s sake! Even though there were a lot of people there, yesterday was sooo relaxing. I sloshed through the cold water, looking for shells and beach glass. (I only found two little pieces of shell… weird.) I was also looking for a big piece of driftwood for a friend, but found nothing interesting. Oh well. The time spent relaxing in my lounge chair was well worth it.  I’m at work again, after a week off. *sigh* I was feeling okay about it, because my boss was supposed to be on vacation this week, but she decided to postpone it until NEXT week. So I wasn’t expecting to see her today. Grr. She left for an hour and a half meeting. As soon as she left, the temperature in my office starting rising... It's 82.6 now. She turns off the air intentionally whenever she leaves. She's so evil.  So I’ve had this feature on my phone for over a year, and have never used it. It seems really nifty, though. And it only costs $.25! The ‘Rescue Ring!’ How cool is that?  urlLink Via Cell, Help's on the Way for Bad Dates   Random thought: I need to call my cousin and see if I left my camera in his car.

Lucky bastard. *giggle* I’m amazed they can still walk.  Have you ever played that ‘Have you ever?’ game with a close friend? Wow. You really learn a lot. I know more about Ev than I ever wanted or needed to know. lol  Ev is probably the only one I’ve had really frank, open discussions with. (Well, actually I’ve been pretty open with someone else lately, but I digress…) It’s kinda funny. My house is so ‘Brady Bunch’. That’s just the way I was raised. You don’t talk about sex, ever. lol (Not that I’d want to talk about it with my family or anything, but still! I don’t think I ever got the sex lecture. Or the safe sex lecture. Thank god for public schools. lol) I know you guys aren't fully comfortable talking about it, either. So (between you two and this blog), it’s nice to have a safe place to vent, talk, and joke about all this silly stuff.  Gah. I guess I should be trying to get some work done. I have piles everywhere from being on vacation! *sigh*

      You know when you haven't gotten enough sleep, but someone tries to wake you up... and you start talking to them, even though you're not completely awake. You say a bunch of stuff you don't understand, and then forget about it... And then someone tells you about the stupid stuff you said later...? I *think* we've all done that, right?  Yesterday morning, 9:30 a.m.  "Hey, wake up. We have to leave in an hour!" (inaudible mumble) "Did you hear me?" "Yeah." "Did you call work and tell them you weren't coming in?" "What?" "Did you call work?!" "Yeah." "Who did you talk to?" "Laverne." "Laverne? There is no Laverne..." "I called, I swear to god." "Hey! You're not awake! Who did you talk to?" "I called Laverne, goddamn it! You know, from Laverne and Shirley! She was signing autographs as Warped Tour!  What the hell is her real name?"  At this point, I walked away and came back a few minutes later.  So awhile later, he finally wakes up and stumbles into the dining room... "So, uh... hey. Do you remember talking to me a few minutes ago...?" (long pause) "...kind of." "So..." "Penny Marshall. That's her name, damn it! And you shut up!"

      (Lyric: 'Lover I Don't Have to Love', Bright Eyes)  Don't we all, Conor? Don't we all.  Anyway, once again I have nothing to write about. Therefore, I'll tell you about my day. Doesn't that sound exciting? No? Well scoot away then, because that's all I've got.  I had a very good day today. I started taking Kava Kava again. Thank you to the friend who brought it up in conversation yesterday. I used to take it, then once I started feeling fairly good, I quit. So I found a bottle on the fridge (completely covered in dust) late last night, and took some before I went to bed. This morning, I felt fairly good and I popped two more. (Have I mentioned that every night and morning when I wake up, my heart has been racing like crazy lately?) Well, it didn't today. Maybe it's a freak thing, but I think I'll try taking some at night for awhile. I'm also taking a liquid B-vitamin supplement, which seems to be doing something for my energy level. (Maybe it's all just power of suggestion...! I don't know.) I know I should be taking the B-vitamins anyway... I'm a vegetarian who definitely doesn't eat right. I'm pretty sure I don't eat enough protein. Lately I can't even eat soy/'fake' meat substitutes, as they remind me too much of meat and make me gag. I'm trying to eat more dairy to supplement the protein intake, but I'm also trying to watch what I eat - and cheese and other dairy products just aren't so good for you. To sum it up, it's really hard to be a vegetarian who is trying to lose weight. *sigh*  Went to lunch with my brother and cousin this afternoon, and then we went to see a movie ('Dodgeball' again, since my brother hadn't seen it and it was at the 'dollar theater'. Funny movie. I liked it.) 'Dollar theaters' are some of the greatest things in the world. Do they have these everywhere? (It's a regular movie theater that plays the movies that just left regular theaters, and they charge $1 admission.) I want to see 'The Bourne Supremacy'. 'The Bourne Identity' was awesome. If you haven't seen it, you should. I didn't really care if I saw it or not at first, then realized even if it sucked (and it didn't!), Matt Damon is nice to look at. lol  So later this afternoon, my cousin and I got bored (my brother went to work), so we went to the beach. We took our lounge chairs and just lay there for about an hour. It was one of the most incredibly relaxing things I've done in a long time. The sound of the waves crashing, the slightly cool breeze, the seagulls overhead... *sigh* The gulls were trying to fly against the wind today, so it looked like they were just hovering in mid-air... I watched them for a long time before closing my eyes. Something about the sun makes me so sleepy when laying there, so I left drowsy but content.  I took a camera with me, but I only took one picture before the batteries died.  Grr. I didn't realize my sister had taken it to a wedding the day before, or I would have charged the batteries.  I'm kind of a picture-taking fiend.  I'm not sure why.  Hey! I'd blog more, but the X-Games are on! Two words: Travis Pastrana. 20 years old. 4 gold medals in 5 years (one year he didn't compete, because of injury). He has a concussion from yesterday, a broken foot, a jacked-up wrist, and can barely see out of his left eye (bruised). He's riding anyway, and just scored a 90.6. I think Nate Adams could be trouble for him this year, though! ...and the BMX stunt finals are tonight, too. Gah! Gotta go...! lol

      (Lyric:  'A Decade Under the Influence', Taking Back Sunday)  I'm watching the X-Games, as I have for the past 8-9 years. I remember the first few years, when the Games were kind of a joke. The Skateboarding and Moto-X best trick competitions are tonight (probably my two favorite events). One question: Is Travis Pastrana amazing, or what? He had a rough night, but still finished 2nd. Tomorrow: Skateboarding's 'Big Air' contest. It should be good.  I was watching some news bit about teen pregnancy rates today. I will never understand why the people who are so against abortion are also typically against sex education/handing out condoms in school. Does this make any sense? I can't figure it out. I see it this way: Kids are already finding out about sex on their own. Why wouldn't you want your child to know the facts? Let them know about STDs and pregnancy! Teach your children, and let them know the dangers. They're going to make the decision on their own anyway - all you can do is help them to make a smarter choice.  Well! Here's an interesting little article:  urlLink Dutch Consider Ban on Toe Licking   Toe licking.  Sounds gross.  Feels good.  *giggle*

      (Lyric: 'I Want to Know Your Plans', Say Anything)  I bought this CD... (Yeah, big surprise...) Anyway, it came in the mail today, and I am so excited about it. It's a band called  urlLink Say Anything . Rarely do I get this rabid about a CD. This is already one of my favorite picks of this year. If you like smart indie rock like Desaparecidos, Bright Eyes, or... well, most of the Saddle Creek bands, you will love this. Even if you don't like those bands, you will love this. Go to the site, listen to the clips, buy the album. Go on.  My other pick for album of the year goes to  urlLink Tiger Army  for their latest album. They're a really unique mix of rockabilly and punk music with slightly creepy lyrics (a.k.a. 'Psychobilly'). Maybe I'm biased, because they're one of my favorite bands, but I don't think so. Geoff Kresge plays the stand-up bass like a madman. 'III: Ghost Tigers Rise': It's an incredible album.  If you haven't heard  urlLink My Chemical Romance's  'Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge', you should listen to that, too.  I went to my family reunion today. I had planned on not going. ThenI started to feel bad... My parents didn't even go! But I went anyway. I must tell you this - I HATE volleyball. And that's all my family does there. So I sat around a lot. By myself. *sigh* Volleyball hurts my neck. Damn that stupid car accident. I'll never be normal again. Oh well. Could be worse. Awhile later, I talked two others into playing hackey-sack - which I suck at. Still, that was fun.  So I left early, and went to Ev's.  I made him hug me.  lol  Then I fell asleep on his shoulder while watching TV.  I only stayed about an hour and a half, because he and Rave had plans.  I really need human contact today.   I just need to curl up in someone's arms and stay there.  Feeling kinda weird and needy, I guess.   I'm going to blog about something intelligent. It's coming, I swear. I feel so boring lately. I can't believe anyone reads this. lol  I need more concerts! I'm going to see Harry Connick, Jr. next week, but that's kind of different. Sit-down concerts are just... different. I want to see  urlLink Bright Eyes . When is Conor coming here?! Gah.  And I want to see Tiger Army again. Twice in one month wasn't enough! lol  To paraphrase Nick 13, lead singer of Tiger Army :  "I hate the sun. As far as I'm concerned, the sun could just disappear. Gone, good. And everyone says, 'But Nick! Everything relies on the sun! Without the sun there'd be no human race!' ... Exactly."  "If you're fucking with Geoff Kresge, you're fucking with the wrong guy. He's as bad at playing the bass as he is at kicking your ass!"

      Warped Tour Pittsburgh.   The Pittsburgh venue is always better than Cleveland.  While Cleveland is all pretty crammed together near the ampitheatre, Pittsburgh is nice and spread out. However, there is that issue of 'the hill'.  ('The Hill' separates the main and side stages.)  The Hill is okay for the first 5 or 6 hours of walking... by 6:00 at night, the Hill has had it's way with you, and even bands you really want to see suddenly don't seem so important...  Thus, NOFX and Bad Religion were enjoyed from a distance in the shade of the tree-covered hill.  I'm trying to remember everyone I saw this time.  Taking Back Sunday, Flogging Molly, Bad Religion,  a little of Rise Against, the Bouncing Souls, Coat of Arms... Oh!  The Code!  They played a great set, and drew a pretty big crowd. I miss them not playing around here so much.  I forget sometimes they're not just our local band anymore.  The toured with the Suicide Machines, for gosh sake!  Good guys. It's always nice to have them come back home, though.   Anti-Flag stopped their set 3 times, because people kept getting hurt or something.  That was incredibly annoying.  I mean, I feel bad for the people who passed out or got hurt.  Still, they only had a half hour set, and it was stopped three times.  Argh.  Tiger Army.  My main reason for going!  Gah.  I love those guys.  Amazing, as usual.  I think I may be in love with Nick 13.  No, really.  lol  He's too cute.  We've met them a few times, and they're wonderful.  Geoff kept stopping me in the crowd to talk every time I walked by last year, noting the *very* old AFI shirt I was wearing.  (From the first album - when he was in AFI...!)  "Hey!  I don't even have that shirt!", he kept saying.   I went with my brother and two of my cousins.  We had a really good time.  Cock jokes aplenty, lots of stories about stupid shit we did back in the day, 80s hair metal, lots of Slayer, and just overall doing stupid things.   I have so much 'free stuff', I'm not sure what to do with it all.  Stickers, CD Samplers, buttons, posters...  'Slim Jim' was a big sponsor of Warped Tour this year.  Which means they give away lots of stuff.  I'm a vegetarian, so this means nothing to me.  However, I'm traveling with a pack of meat eaters.  So, there's a huge box of Slim Jims sitting there, and my brother and cousin each take a HUGE handful.  My brother proceeds to stuff them into my bag for later.  Gah.  (Also, he slapped a Slim-Jim sticker on my arm, which proclaims 'It's Meat-A-Riffic!')  God, we have a stupid sense of humor.   So the car ride home is always the best.  Everyone's exhausted, but everyone has their stories to tell.  (We always get separated throughout the day.)  I'll spare most of the stupid stories.  But as we began driving, they suddenly remembered the Slim-Jims.  So the rest of the ride home, the two of them hung out the windows, screaming 'free meat', and 'who wants the meat?', and such things.  They kept trying to give them to people who were driving next to us.  We got flipped off a lot.  Only one person took the Slim-Jim.  We tossed it into her car at a red light.  *giggle*  We also left a few on windshields when we stopped for food at Sheetz.  We really do have a stupid sense of humor.   I missed my favorite friend today.  I wish he could have been with me.

      I'm excited. I just downloaded the first song from our local boys, 'Signal Home' at purevolume.com.  Good stuff.  Can't wait until the next show.  On another note, Fred wrote the best blog ever about a beverage, and it needs to be shared:  >>At about Noon we all stopped at the local Taco Bell, and ate a bit of food. The brand new Mountain Dew flavor, exclusive ONLY at Taco Bell this summer, I forget the name. BUT LORD ALMIGHTY, I have NEVER been so indecisive about whether I enjoy a beverage or not. I swear, and I quote Ken.  "I could drink this drink for the rest of my life, and not know if I enjoy it or not..."  It has the most obscure taste, and at that, I cannot tell if it's a good taste or a bad taste. I'd like for you all to try it and get back to me, or at least be able to DESCRIBE what this new flavor tastes like. It's really really really weird tasting. It's a brand new flavor. Something that has NEVER BEEN DONE.  I'm not usually riled up too easily about food or drinks or what-not. But this is just weird tasting. IT's like they mixed all the bad testings of livewire, mountain dew, and ginger ale together, and for some reason it's weird tasting. Really weird. I couldn't get a grip on it, do i like it? I have no idea. Did I drink a HUGE XL CUP OF IT? YES!? But yet the answer still eludes me as to whether the drink is good tasting or bad.  In any case, they get some points for making up a completely new flavor. There's grape, orange, red, green, clear, and other tastes. But this is NONE OF THEM. It's weird.

       (Lyric: ‘Don't Tell And We Won't Ask’, Thrice)   For the second day in a row, I feel miserable. Gah. Being a girl sucks sometimes. I feel completely wrecked - I rarely feel so terrible. Tylenol is my best friend again today. Ev said if I want to come over, he’ll have real chocolate (not the vegan crap he eats!) and the hot tub ready for me… *giggle* Rave is a lucky boy. I think I’ll just go home and lay down, though. lol   I’ve been daydreaming entirely too much lately. I need my own place. My parents are wonderful for putting up with me. I think they even like me living at home. Still, I really crave a place to be alone sometimes. I think I could just barely afford a crappy apartment now. Of course, I’m trying really hard to help my mom with the bills, since dad’s off work and his disability ran out. He’s still trying for social security, but they’re giving him the runaround. *sigh* If I moved out, I wouldn’t be able to help and then I’d feel awful. Oh well. I’d hate living alone anyway. I’m too neurotic, and I’d go insane. lol    Lots of strange random thoughts in my head today. Like this one: I wonder how much money I’m up to in my red crayon bank? lol Not nearly enough…probably a little over $100. Ehh..   I wonder what Matt’s up to. We were so close for a while… just a few weeks ago, even. It’s cool. We made better friends than anything. It’s weird how things work, though. I’m pretty sure he’s got something going on with Chris. lol Chris is such a bastard. Uh, yeah. He was the one trying to get us together a few months ago, but I’m pretty sure he’s sleeping with him now. lol    Chris really is a bastard. He’s just this tiny thing, but he’s so cocky and confident. With model good looks. He’s so pretty - I think he intimidates most people. And rightly so. Matt’s just as pretty, so they’d make a good pair. lol Chris particularly loves messing with ‘straight guys’. It’s a thrill for him. I remember the first time Chris met Matt. We were at Rave &amp; Ev’s house a few months ago… Matt’s pretty shy and… well, straight (or was - ?) … So of course Chris starts a conversation by telling him how sexy he is (poor Matt turns bright red)… then Chris asks him if he’s ever kissed a guy… (Gah! Who does that?) Of course, the night progressed with Chris coaxing him into kissing him…and the night ended with Chris’s head in his lap, and a very scared, trembling Matt holding on to me for dear life. That was one of the most awkward situations of my life. Ehh. Seriously, though. What an ass! lol If you haven’t already met Chris – you’re not going to. I’m keeping all of my guy friends far, far away from Chris.   Well that was a fun story, huh? lol Way more than you needed to know. I'm still reading 'The Last Unicorn' - so far, the movie is very true to the book. I need to buy that movie. Aah. I love it!   Another random thought: I have been at this job for 5 years. I just now realized that I can adjust the arms on my office chair. I think every day that the arms are too high, and they make my elbows and wrists hurt. *sigh* What an idiot.  Gah. I’m going to take more Tylenol…
