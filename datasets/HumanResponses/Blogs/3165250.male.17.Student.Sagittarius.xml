      I suppose the title would indicate that i made it. All i can say is that the trip hurt! Oof. The first half was fairly difficult being a lot of uphill and a little downhill. The second half was easier but hurt all the same b/c the lactic acid at that point was faily high in my quads. It got to the point where all i could think about was the pain. However, i stopped off at Dead Man's flat for some quick sugar because my blood sugar levels were at an all time low. There i bought some vitamin I. Oh blessed vitamin I. by the time i got to canmore, the pain was all gone. Complaints aside, the trip was a lot of fun. GREAT workout. Talk about your base line cardio. So i got into Canmore bout a quarter to four and realized i didnt know where the hostel was. So after asking some locals where i might find this lodge i got some direction.. it was halfway up a *&#@ing mountain. At that point i got off my bike and pushed it up the hill. The hostel is out of this world. Its nothing like any hostel iv stayed at before. Its beautiful. large rooms, a gorgous sitting room, a modern kitchen, showers, wahing machines, and ofcouse, a computer. So after i checked in, i changed a walked to downtown Canmore, about a fifty minute walk, which is fine since i had to get the acid out of my muscles anyways. I got a light vegitarian wrap at the bagel co. downtown, stopped at IGA (sorry, Sobies) to get some milk for breakky tomorrow and walked back, just missing the rain. Iv been bumming around the clubhouse reading Mags. Its gotta be around 8:15, and i have 3 minutes left of internet use.  some things i saw on the road: - A dead deer - large amounts of tire remains - an abundance of dead animals  will report about the trip back to Calgary when i get there

      I bought some new stuff for my bike today at MEC. I got one of those little pouches that sits under your seat. Its now filled with a brand new innertube and three tire wrenches. I also got a water bottle holder and a water bottle. I also bought some biking socks. they feel soooooo much better in the biking shoes than regular socks, so it should make tomorrow's trip a bit more comfortable.Iv found a hostel and made reservations. $23 a night, not too shabby. Unfortunatly my pack is a bit on the heavy side, but hey, thats life. In leaving the house 10:00 AM sharp friday morning.

      The Golden Triangle is put on every year by The Elbow Valley Cycle Club. This will be my first time doing it, and im pumped. Its next may long weekend if im not mistaken, and im pumped. As I said in an earlier post, you start at the Castle Mountain Junction and haul ass up to radium. That first part is all up hill so, oh yeah, that hot spring is going to be a good friend. They then stuff you full of well-earned food. The next trek is from Radium to Golden. More food in Golden. Then, you drain the tank as you go from Golden back to Castle Mountain. I would say its a pretty good deal, $130.00 for such an experience. One of my rowing coaches, who is also a respected member of the biking community, got me onto this. Cheers Blair. Blair has also biked across Canada which is my long term goal. Dip my back wheel in the Atlantic and ride through all provinces until my front tire is in the Pacific Ocean.

      NEVER, NEVER, EVER clip both shoes in and then try to go. The only direction you will go is down. Amateur mistake, and one that is made just once. A few points iv learned  1. Clip one shoe in, take a stroke, and while coasting, do the other.  2. Be in an easy gear when you start off. you need that quick coasting ability to get that other foot in.  3. When possible, avoid trying to pedal uphill and clip your other foot in.  4. Most importantly, if ever you are asked to put a tap show on while wearing the cleated shoes, those cleats have another use... denting shins!

      A quick rundown on the bike deal. I originally took it up the sport on a cheapy moutain bike when I was about 10 because the parents refused to drive me up to Casablanca video. I then owned another cheapy bike which I used to putter around in life, you know, to and from school, around to get food and candy and the like. After saying "hasta luego" (thats Spanish for until next time) to that bike, I then mooched my father's relatively cheapy bike. This bike was put to some serious use. It saw all parts of the city, Brentwood, numerous trips around the Calgary reservoir, the bottom of the reservoir (an adventure involving failed brakes and unfortunate hijinx), Mount Royal, and so on. We pourd more money into fixing this bike then we buying it. So after a quoted $300 tuneup, I said good riddance. Being the lazy bugger that I was, I didn't even bother to pick it up form the bike store. I assume it is now becoming something greater in life, like a chain link fence post. I then mooched another bike off my father, a 1978 Raleigh. I will double check the spelling on that. This bad boy was retro. And in great condition... Because it was never used. I quickly put a stop to that. Now, unlike wine, a bike does not appreciate in value over time, so locking it up was never a huge priority. Just stash it behind a dumpster and go on your way. Now with all this money we saved on bikes, I thought it was about time I invested in a bike... A real bike. So after 3 months on my dad's bike, we went our separate ways and I bought Virginia. I might never own a sports car of any sorts so naming this bike is as close as im gonna get. Virginia is a road bike, a Devinci Apex to be exact. $899 marked down from $1299, I paid about $1100 in total. In addition to the bike, bought a kryptonite lock (to keep that fucker Superman's hands off my stuff) , a computer for it, a bell and other biking accessories.  Virginia is my pride and joy. I have no sorrows about getting up at 4AM when I know im gonna be biking to rowing on Her. anyhow, it occurred to me after i bought the bike that yeah, i could go somewhere with this (pun completely intended) and toyed with the prospect of long distant bike. Iv done two fifty kilometer on cosecutive days and my big project for this year is to bike to Canmore on a Friday and home on the Sunday. Thats about a 200 Km round trip. My almighty goal for next year is  The Golden Triangle.  Its a 3 day, 300 Km trip, starting at Castle Moutain Jnct and doing a round trip and arriving back where we started. Thats all for now. Ill keep this updated... i hope. Mack
