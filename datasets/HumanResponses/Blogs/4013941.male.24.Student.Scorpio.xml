						   So from the first blog its every evident that i am weirdo.. well i think this one would just cement the fact that i am an absolute weirdo.. .&nbsp; I had many crushes in life and this blog is about the latest crush which i had in my life.. This happened about a month and half ago. I was coming back after my visiting my relatives.&nbsp;i was waiting for train in&nbsp;Chengannur Railway station( for those who don't know abt this&nbsp;place, its a small town in alleppy district in Kerala).   I saw a pretty good looking girl on the&nbsp;opposite platform and she got my full 5 mins airtime. Because by that time my train came and so i had to leave. Well everytime i go for a trip i inadverently develop a liking towards girl(s), so looking at her and appreciating was nothing new for me. But this is different because i still remember her face distinctly, though i saw her face only for 5 mins that to when u she was sitting in the opposite platform.   Well the rational guy in me say it as an anomaly in the matrix( Refer: Agent Smith, Matrix Fame), But i don't know whether its just an anomaly because i am a pretty detached guy( atleast thats what i feel :-)) and i forget ppl pretty fast. Then u ppl may ask me what am i trying to say.. well i liked that girl so much ( u may call it infactuation , but i say a value added term "unknown attachement") that i wish i could meet her again in my life. Well i don't know her name nor what shes doing.. so lets see if i am that lucky..

						   " Samoj and Passion, Please don't joke", that would be the first response of people who know me. Well&nbsp;I was always said a "sensible", "rational", "non risky" guy who would be one of the last person in the world who would dare to utter the golden word of passion, which is &nbsp;perceived as by many as a irrational feeling.   Coming to our main topic whether i am passionate, its a tough thing to say. I have never thought about it. I dropped a crush in Engineering college because i felt that it would affect my career ( Still don't know how&nbsp;it0 would have affected my career).. So "samoj" seems lika a insensitive non passinate moron.   But if I stop for a moment and think&nbsp;whether I am a non passionate moron as many think or Am I a more complete human being with emotions like passion and sensitiveness. Well I think,&nbsp;I am a bit of passionate guy, though I have never noticed, I have spend a lot of time on seemingly trivial things ( by my rational part of mind) , spending a lot of energy trying to do things just because it gave a lot of satisfaction and completeness.   Then do we need passion in life ( sounds like crappy "MBA" stuff rite!!! sorry boss, u have come to this god damn blog&nbsp;).&nbsp; A "rational" mind's analysis of passion is something we&nbsp;keeps your adrenaline pumping, which gives you energy even though you&nbsp;are physically and mentally sapped of the work.
