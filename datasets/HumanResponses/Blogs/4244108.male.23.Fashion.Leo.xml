      As Christians we are continually seeking to possess Christ-like characteristics, to obtain this personal relationship with our Lord, and to strive for God's will to be done in our life. What I attempt to contribute in this post is to challenge us to reevaluate the notion there is God, but now where is God? The Enemy has the complete jurisdiction that allows him to govern this sinful world and culture we live in. With this in full force, the Enemy has the opportunity to take every possible angle that he can to intervene with our relationship with Jesus. Now, when this intervention transpires this causes a little bump in the road, compelling us to ask the question okay God where were you there? But two days ago we were completely saturated in His presence during an amazing Church service on Sunday. Can you see and feel what I'm lying down? Here is God in our life and then seemingly, He disappears. To be blunt this is how life is. Being a Christian we automattically assume God is alway going to be right by our side and holding our hand with each circumstance that arises. And Yes that idea of God is safe and comfortable. This is why when we are REALLY working for the Kingdom it entails high volumes of risk. Religion is a system of safety, which was perfectly demonstrated by the Pharisees. When God called David to engage in a battle with Goliath, this does not align with an easy comfortable calling. God is like check it; David I want you to fight this huge dude, not with a sword or a machine gun, but with a stick sling shot. (1 Sam 17:40) Wow I bet David was real calm and comforted by that. David was probably thinking sweet...I get a few soft pebbles to shoot at this 8 foot giant and I'm suppose to kill him.  But David acts on faith which requires huge amount of risk to get the job done. Let me reinforce trusting God and enduring in Christian values is not a safety net for us Christians; fully exemplifying trusting God, enables us to engage in a fight that must be motivated by the Heart. There are going to be situations in your life where God is going to be there and other times where He is going to be absent. But we must look at the bigger picture and trust that He is for our best interest and for our Good. (psalm 107, psalm 145, exodus 34:2) That is right GOD IS ALL GOOD!! I'm encouraging anyone who is reading this to look at the bigger picture and trust in your heart that Yes God is all good in the hood and that the enemy is only trying to take away from our relationship with God (John 10:10). Ya'll keep it crazy out there living for Christ! Know this publication emphasizes why I always go with the mentality Go Big or Go home Baby. If I'm going home, that means I'm letting the Enemy get in my way breaking me down and that aint going to happen! I'm out....much soul and love echoing from the valley of LA......
