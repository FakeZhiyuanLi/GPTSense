We ain't worth it..We were born of a sinful nature..Not worthy of you Lord..No pureness nor holiness can b compared to you..Why Lord?..Why did we have to let our brother to die fer us..It hurts mi too... Lord Im reali praying hard fer my friends Lord..Forgive them..It hurts mi to see my good friends getting hurt over n over again.. Lord i just pray that they wun get into quarrels, conflicts, fights, arguements and anithing that a child of yers shouldnt have..Lord I pray that Lord u forgive mi as well... Lord as Im praying Lord, some pple out there wil b stil sinning out of anger. jealousy, envy, hatred...Sorry Father fer all the things we hv done, Lord but I pray that Lord yer angels will just guide them Lord.. Thank you Lord..I pray,Amen. (Glory) Great is the lord God Almighty,great is the Lord on high. The train of his robes fills the temple,and we cry out his highest praise. Glory to the risen King......
