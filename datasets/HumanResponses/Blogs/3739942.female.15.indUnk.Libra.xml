       Tonight*  I was selfishly ditched for a pack of FM girls. I seriously thought that I had figured out who my true friends are, then I get ditched for someone like her. That's basically insane and it pisses me off a lot. I told Ashley about it and It's not like I can miss the game so I guess I'm going by myself. ::Gasp:: I never go anywhere by myself, so it'll be a learning experience. I got a letter from Eric today. :) The thought of him just makes me smile and giggle. I've been starting to wonder why people are starting crap about us, but then I think i've figured it out. Jealousy. I know Tiffany Engle wanted to jump his bones last week @ volleyball so that's probably where some of the stuff is coming from.   Friday¤  I have to pack for a long essential weekend with the girls. There's a party @ Samanthas then its off to the sleepover routine. I need to take a nap friday because heaven knows I'm always the first one out. Maybe not if I get to talk on the phone with Eric til odd hours of the morning. ::giggle:: So much fun.  Saturday Morning¤  We leave for Celina for a weekend full of 3 girls, a cabin, and probably no electricity. I will cradle my cell phone. I love to camp, don't get me wrong... but boredom kills. We'll be around Celina Saturday night so I was trying to plan something out w/ Angela to go to the bowling alley there or something. Eric said it was pretty cool... and eric knows everything. haha. I was just thinking... Eric hates FM.. and who ditched me today? FM kids.. And ditching Amy.. just IS NOT cool no matter what is going on. So I'll be gone all weekend w/ the girls. I will be home Sunday night probably. Then I have to live through another week till i get to see my baby. later on kids.. ¤Amy
