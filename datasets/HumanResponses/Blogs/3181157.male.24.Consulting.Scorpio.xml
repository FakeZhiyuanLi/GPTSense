       "Once in a while, everyone stumbles on the truth; but then they somehow manage to pick themselves up and walk away again!"   This is the auto tag-line, my super-boss inserts in all his email correspondence.

      Woke up with a splitting headache, a million hammer-pinion systems over working themselves in the head. Put on ‘The Pianist’ soundtrack to ease the morning, the CD player was on Shuffle mode, it started of with Track 8 – Grande Polonaise brilliante. This kind of eased the headache, but this track begins in such a sweetly depressing way, it numbs the heart. Consequently, I slipped into an irrational state of depression.   At work, was chatting with a colleague during my Coffee Break, conversation veered towards the Euro Cup. We discussed England’s prospects, being the soccer crazy lot that we are, we created our own little fantasy team – a team formation if we were Technical Consultants to the England squad. It is as follows,  Defenders: Sol Campbell, Ferdinand…. Stopper: Lampard Midfield: Beckham, Scholes, Ashley Cole, Gary Neville Forwards: We will resurrect the ageing Alan Shearer,                  Play Owen to test the Offside trap, like how Cezare Maldini played Inzaghi                  And yes Beaty, to head home winners.  To be noted, we have excluded patently uncreative players of the likes of Manchaster United’s Nicky Butt and Liverpool’s Heskey.    It could work…magnificently actually. But its sheer escapism I know :(  But what the heck, the fox Eriksson may go ahead and draw up something absolutely different, and England may win the Euro in spite of it. But my headache is gone now, and I don’t feel like a newspaper that was left on the porch, when the rains came down.

      Watched a news feature on Landless Laborers in Harayana, last night on the telly. There are villages, where 2% of the people own a 100% of the land. Land reforms are obviously, non-existent.   Landless laborers (whole families) are involved in the entire process, from sowing the seeds to the final harvesting. To use a Management expression, they provide end-to-end solutions, but the returns they get from the landlords are on an average only one-eighth of the produce value!   The urban-rural contradiction, with allusions of poverty in villages and prosperity in the cities, is often rather misleading. What do we really own? Is the desire for ownership, moral, ethical and justified?  Life for Rent, and often, the only thing we own, is an entry on blogspot.

        "But if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy Well I deserve nothing more than I get Cos nothing I have is truly mine"    Downright depressing and fatalistic, in a way, but rather true...just think about it.   Driving a car through a crowded street, the air-conditioning, the windows insulating you from time and space.   Kids don’t rush across the street, you don’t need to push the brakes.  All the crossings blink green, you don’t need to change gears. The radio plays all your favorite songs, you don’t have to reach for the channel button. The streets buzz with life, but you don’t need to care. The only thing now is your life, beyond the window glass is thoughtless caricature.  And you just drift-drive on ...streets leads to abstruse lanes,  Abstruse lanes meander aimlessly, but you don’t even notice, Lanes end at cross roads, you don’t pause and you don’t think, ...and then the wide open...the highways,  the city recedes, there is always good roads under the rubber.  Kids skin dipping in ponds wave, you just smile. Gas stations loom ahead, you drive past…your tank is full. The woman you loved sits on the garden bench, an eye on the road… You slow up, smile and say something…before driving away She laughs, and then she waves …asking you to come back.  As you drive away, you look at her …through the rear view mirror, you haven’t moved on.

       21 grams   They say we all lose 21 grams at the exact moment of our death everyone...  The weight of a stack of nickels, The weight of a chocolate bar, The weight of a hummingbird.  The weight of our soul perhaps? How much we meant to others?

       “We will sit back and laugh about it someday”   There are various things which happen, some nice and fun, some not so happy. And as the event is happening, or soon after, we tell ourselves “We will sit back and laugh about it someday”.  Like once in hostel, we made a guy fake an appendicitis attack, so that we could go out at 11 in the night to eat at the Dhaba. We were part ravenously hungry, part the urge to do something outrageous and rebellious. So we faked an appendicitis attack, to gorge on roti, channa and paneer.   While we stuffed our faces with the food, there had been guffaws of laughter and back slapping in good measure, “We will sit back and laugh about it someday!!”  Yes, today when I do look back and remember that particular night, it does bring a smile. Memories of the bonhomie, the friends who I have not met since the day we left college.   But there have been stuff, which has elicited a similar comment, “We will sit back and laugh about it someday!!” But somehow, I haven’t been able to smile about them yet. Maybe its one of those things which will never quite bring a smile or induce laughter, alternatively maybe the elusive “someday” is yet to happen.  Hope the smile and the laughter does actually happen ‘someday’. Not in a cynical, fucked with life way, but in a warm, fuzzy and nice way. Cheers to that!

      I never had a teacher like Morrie Schwartz. But I had someone else, very quotidian and no where as flamboyant. But in his own way, he told me a lot many good things.  It was DKB, our ‘Head of plus two’, a post created solely for the man. Because he wasn’t Christian, so he could never become principal or vice principal. So they placated him by making him Head of Plus two.  DKB, taught Physics. And frankly sucked at it…he was big time ineffective.  But the man told me a couple of things, once he asked me, what was it I wanted to do in life?   Me: “I want to be an engineer, a Computer Engineer”. DKB: “Where do you want to do it? Abroad?” Me: “No in India. I know I cannot make it to IIT, but anything a rung below, will do”.   Btw, I did make it to IIT, technically speaking atleast. I did a project on Steganography in association with a Professor who taught Digital Signal Processing, in IIT Madras. Worked in there labs and offices for six whole months.  Anyways,   DKB: “You will face a big culture shock; you will have to live with people who wear gamchas! And eat rice like there is no tomorrow! It will be an anti-thesis of all that you have been exposed to at La-Martiniere”   I had found it ludicrous then, but yes all that he had warned me about, “the culture shock” did happen.  Another time, I had gone to complain to DKB about the selection of some team. Some worthy guys had been left out, and some daft pricks had been included.  I complained, how ‘not good’ the whole thing was, and how worthy people were being wrongfully left out. I raved and ranted for their cause. But DKB didn’t budge, his official line was, the selection has been made and it won’t be changed!  I had exclaimed  ‘But Sir, it’s not FAIR!”.   DKB had prophetically said,  “Who ever told you that life was supposed to be fair?”.   Frankly, I had wanted to wring his neck then, and somehow ensure that justice was done.  But with time, I have come to realize that this probably was the most practical advice anyone ever has given me.  While driving back from work last night, I realized it fully and forever. A lot of our problems are because we expect life to be fair.   There was a lot more sapient advice DKB had given me, but for the love of my life I can’t remember what they were. It’s good in a way, I guess this way i'll discover my own truths.

      Whether being a Romantic makes me metrosexual, frankly I don’t know. Like many other things in fact.  I have kind of held on to two Romantic Notions, silly to be admitting it, but it does only matter to me. So nothing much to lose is there? If I ever meet the girl, with whom I want to go the “whole 9 yards”, and she feels the same way. I would do two things,  1.	Go and see the Taj Mahal with her. No, I haven’t seen the Taj Mahal yet.  I have had dinner at the Eiffel Town, stood all evening on Trafalgar Square.  But No, I haven’t seen the Taj. I plan to do it with her.  2.	Watch Casablanca with her. It’s my all time favorite Romantic movie. I have always watched the movie alone.  I watched it again last night, and yes again alone. Metaphorically speaking of course, ‘cause there is always - Lisa and Rick.  “In all the gin joints, in all the towns in the world, she had to walk into mine”.   Maybe I will own a gin joint someday. Maybe she will walk into my gin joint, in my town. Till then I have a post on blogspot.

      A kilometer down from my college was this 24x7 teashop, catering to Truckers mostly. It overlooked a bus-stand, a STD booth, a building with a music store on the ground floor and a cyber café on the first floor.   This guy called Kareem bhai, a Hydrabadi, ran the shop. His station a raised platform, on which stood this large copper thing, most close to a boiler, reduced manifold in size. It was always on the boil, and had two spouts one for water and the other for milk. Its Indian-ness was unmistakable.  It had a wooden bench stretched out in front of it. I used to often go there in the evenings. It was a lovely perch from which to watch the din and bustle of a busy crossing. Buses with loud blaring horns tumbled in like beaten up jalopies. People were everywhere, women with shopping bags, men with attaches, and students with a textbook. And there I was with my Coffee on the bench, under Kareem bhai’s nose.   There was an odd sense of involvement and abstraction, all at once. I was part of the whole system, the bellowing automobile exhaust, the cries of a vendor selling an evening daily, the oppressive heat, and the warmth of my coffee rising out of the Styrofoam cup. Yet in a sense, there was abstraction, like watching sport from the stands. I was insulated, the discussions around where in a language I didn’t know, and the headlines in the newspaper I couldn’t read.   I looked across the buses and the people, the noise and the smoke, towards the sky stretched beyond it. A telecommunication tower rose into the sky, and behind all of that was the sun. A citrine disc now an oblate spheroid, drops of yellow citrus weakly squeezed from it dissipated into the murkiness, each drop coalescing with the sky to announce the curtain fall of a stage show.

      Rabindranath Tagore (affectionately Robbie T) didn’t receive the Nobel Prize in person. He sent a Telegram, by way of an acceptance speech.  Which was read by a Mr. Clive, the British Chargé d'Affaires, at the Nobel Banquet at the Grand Hôtel, Stockholm (December 10, 1913).   I beg to convey to the Swedish Academy my grateful appreciation of the breadth of understanding, which has brought the distant near, and has made a stranger a brother.

       Les Prix Nobel (1994)   John.F.Nash Jr    "...rationality of thought imposes a limit on a person's concept of his relation to the cosmos. For example, a non-Zoroastrian could think of Zarathustra as simply a madman who led millions of naive followers to adopt a cult of ritual fire worship. But without his "madness" Zarathustra would necessarily have been only another of the millions or billions of human individuals who have lived and then been forgotten"

      Haven’t done much of blogging…off late. A combination of many things really,  1.	Lack of Time (Had to put that in!) 2.	Am doing some other writing related work, so as I am Creatively rather limited, it’s difficult to supply creative musings to both my ‘writing related work and ‘my blog’. 3.	I don’t think, anyone really does read it…so it doesn’t really matter does it? 4.	Ok…how about the writing just for yourself?  My musings/opinions are all in ‘my mind’ right? To paraphrase Huxley…’my mind is my own private literature’.  So that’s that!  A very close friend from college Vivek, we used to have a ball in college! At the end of every semester we used to go to Pondicherry, lovely little place. His cousins who were settled there, ran liquor shops, so well the booze was often more easily available than aqua pura.   There was this little thing about the man Vivek, when he was rather “high”, the man had this propensity of asking “Fundamental Questions”. Which I must admit, most of us were too inebriated, to answer suitably. A sample would be as follows,  Vivi:  Boss, Why does man love a woman?  Me:    Hmm…  Vivi:  I mean why can’t he love a Chair…for example?  Me:    Bud, people do love chairs…Kissa Kursi Kaa and all of that. Politicians they love the chair.  Vivi:  No..I don’t mean it that way…I mean why is Man attracted to a woman, why does he love a woman? I mean why not a Cow, Furniture…a Place. Why does it have to be a     woman!         -	Long Silence and Steady Drinking –  The day after, the hangover not withstanding, there used to be guffaws about Vivi’s 'Fundamental Questions'.  “Don’t get the Fuck Drunk again, he will wanna do a Chair or a Cow or something!” More guffaws.  Last Weekend, outside Café Coffee Day, sipping on “Ice Eskimo” or some other such Cold-Coffee variant, this whole episode came back to me. Why indeed do we have this urge consciously/subconsciously, to seek a significant other? A girlfriend, a lover, a wife? Isn’t it like the ions from High School Chemistry, positive ions continually seeking negative ions, to attain stability and vice-versa.   Are we like that too? I mean for all our evolution, all our Buddha, Plato, Russell, Sartre, Jung, Mozart, …we are like an atom, with an electron more or an electron less.   Conversely, the whole ability or realization, to truly get rid off the “seeking/need a significant other” phenomenon. Is that a sign of evolution?  Funny what John Nash said though,    I've always believed in numbers and the equations and logics that lead to reason. But after a lifetime of such pursuits, I ask, "What truly is logic? Who decides reason?"  My quest has taken me through the physical, the metaphysical, the delusional -- and back.  And I have made the most important discovery of my career, the most important discovery of my life: It is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logic or reasons can be found.

      From Last night, Monaco came from behind to overcome a two-goal deficit to settle scores at 2-2 with Chelsea. Monaco move to the finals, imagine that.  The Champions League Final line up… Monaco v. Porto. Who would have wagered that?  That aside, coming to today’s blog. Was out with some friends, a mid week get together, a friend leaving town for a better job, all rolled into one. Kunal, who by the way works for a bank was cheesed off with work. At a training session at work, the trainer was apparently rather comatose, and no one could make any sense of the instructions she was attempting to impart.   Buddy Kunal, stood up and spoke his mind, saying something to the effect of “None of us ten trainees have understood a word after two hours, now it isn’t possible that ALL of us are daft, which raises the question whether you are a good enough trainer”. An extended verbal duel ensued, and at the end of all of it, Kunal was threatened with disciplinary action.  Conversation soon veered towards “success”, its definition – whether at all there exists a universal definition at all, or is it everyone for themselves. When we ask someone whether he is successful? How/Why do we assume he is not already?   We then tried to look at the whole Kunal Shenanigan in the light of “what-is-success? “  debate.   The fact that Kunal works with a leading bank and is fairly successful, indicative of success?  The fact that he had the conviction to stand up for what he thought was right, while the rest of the trainees spent their time “clipping finger nails and/or staring at shoestrings”, indicative of success?  The fact that in the evening he has friends in a huddle around him, talking to him about the issue, and will be there for him even if his bank fires him tomorrow, indicative of success?  Its an amalgamation of all the above, and much more, isn’t it? So there isn’t a formula right? 2 parts Money, 1 Part Fame, 2 Parts Assets…  Just to imagine that a word(s) we use so often..success, succeed, successful …we don’t know a rats ass what it means. That’s maybe because we are so woefully unsuccessful!   Strangely and not very much in congruence with the thread, a line from Philadelphia Story just kind of sticks…   Maggie: We both might face the facts that neither of us has proved to be a very great success as a wife… Tracy:  We just picked the wrong first husband

        Taxi Driver: The Movie which nearly killed a President       Dear Jodie:  There is definitely a possibility that I will be killed in my attempt to get Reagan. It is for this very reason that I am writing you this letter now.  As you well know by now I love you very much. Over the past seven months I've left you dozens of poems, letters and love messages in the faint hope that you could develop an interest in me. Although we talked on the phone a couple of times I never had the nerve to simply approach you and introduce myself. Besides my shyness, I honestly did not wish to bother you with my constant presence. I know the many messages left at your door and in your mailbox were a nuisance, but I felt that it was the most painless way for me to express my love for you.  I feel very good about the fact that you at least know my name and how I feel about you. And by hanging around your dormitory, I've come to realize that I'm the topic of more than a little conversation, however full of ridicule it may be. At least you know that I'll always love you. Jodie, I would abandon the idea of getting Reagan in a second if I could only win your heart and live out the rest of my life with you, whether it be in total obscurity or whatever.  I will admit to you that the reason I'm going ahead with this attempt now is because I cannot wait any longer to impress you. I've got to do something now to make you understand, in no uncertain terms, that I'm doing all of this for your sake! By sacrificing my freedom and possibly my life, I hope to change your mind about me. This letter is being written only an hour before I leave for the Hilton Hotel. Jodie, I'm asking you to please look into your heart and at least give the chance, with this historical deed, to gain your love and respect.  I love you forever,  John W. Hinckley     Monday March 30th, 1981. John Hinckley after writing this letter to Jodie Foster attempted his infamous assassination bid on President Reagan. Reagan was shot in his left chest, but fortunately survived.   Hinckley always had an affinity for firearms, and his obsession for Jodie Foster, began after the actress played a teenage prostitute in the Robert De Niro flick ‘Taxi-Driver’.   De Niro’s character in the movie, Travis Bickle, in an attempt to win the admiration of Betsy, his love interest, attempts to assassinate a Presidential Candidate, for whom she worked. Later in the plot, in a bid to rescue Iris (Foster), a 12-year-old prostitute, Travis (De Niro) shoots her client, pimp and a hotel Manager, emerging a hero.   Hinckley is said to have seen the movie fifteen times, and read and re-read the book on which it is based, numerous times. Influenced by the movie, he began to identify and imitate Travis Bickle in real life. He dressed up like him, drank the same peach brandy. He in fact moved to Yale, where Jodie Foster was pursuing a course, and his attempts to be-friend her, was in his mind an attempt to “rescue” her, the way Travis rescued Iris in the movie.   During his trial, the defense actually showed the movie to the grand jury, arguing that his identification with the psychotic Travis Bickle was unconscious. The trial, which lasted almost a year, found Hinckley not guilty on grounds of “insanity”. He has been in Mental Hospital ever since.

        "Could you please fill up this form?" Like NO!!!     There is stuff, which I just can’t do!   Doesn’t everybody have these teenie-weenie things, which they abso-bloody-lutely suck at! Stuff which are in fact easy and mundane, but one just cannot do it.   My Achilles heel, are Forms!  I just get totally freaked out filling up forms. Its strange I become a bundle of nerves, start seeing double, my palms get sweaty. It’s always been this way, ever since I remember filling forms up.   I get jittery about the smallest of things; dates for example, birth dates, months in the year, departure date when filling up travel forms. Determining which is my first and which is my last name becomes particularly tricky. And boxes, which I have to leave blank, kind of induces a crawly feeling behind the neck. Middle Name? Oh god! Don’t have one…so darn ill have to leave this one blank. Children? Wish I could pencil in a number like 10 or something! Instead of leaving an ambiguous hyphen sitting around the place.   The ones, which come with those rectangular little boxes, to pencil in names, letter by letter. My god! Are they infernal or what.  Online forms have their own curve balls to just knock me down.  Fill in your business goals for the current fiscal (limit 1000 characters).   Jack! I may have business goals, which run into 1010 words. So why should I prune my sentences, and abbreviate stuff? It’s MY Business Goals, for chrissakes! Can’t I at least decide how long my paragraph will be!   Forms, which have multiple-choice Questions, are particularly tricky, they often give you tones of options but none of them seem to be your answer. Like,   How would you describe yourself as a lover?  a) Romeo reloaded  b) “Love” a four-letter word!  c) Oasis in the dessert  d) Been there “DONE” that!   I mean, cant they have an option like “normal/regular”?   I just don’t “fit in” with the whole form thingy. I mean the guy who created forms and me; we must have been born with warring constellations shining on our respective posteriors.   Phew!

        One of my Goldfish, Caviar died last night.     I was up watching the Euro Cup last night in my den. And subsequently, dozed off on the couch. Bleary eyed when I returned to my room in the morning, I found the puffed up body of Caviar. Not swimming in circles, but still – half sunk, half afloat.   I have had Champagne (the second of my goldfish) and Caviar, for over six months. Frankly one doesn’t develop a conventional emotional bond with ones goldfish, like one does with his dog or even cat. Goldfish don’t hurtle up to you and paw all over you when you get home, nor do they curl up at your feet.   But my goldfish have given me great many days of joy. Every morning, the first thing I do is to feed them their dry food, as soon as I come up to the bowl, they rush towards the circumference closest to me. Their mouths puckered in gasps of breath. I used to smile to myself, Marilyn Monroe deep sea diving!   The identification, the adhesive, is derived from the fact that Champagne and Caviar and their fishbowl, is very congruent to my cubicle and me. Stuck in the same time-space warp. Where every day, seems the same?   A few months back, I decided to educate and familiarize Champagne and Caviar to the good life and the wonders of the world. I carried the fish bowl to the den, and we watched the 9 ‘o’ clock news together. Even gave them a quick update on News features on Israel and Russia, and anything else, which was before their time.   I spent couple of weekends exposing them to good music, we listened to western classical. Chopin, Bach and Handel mostly. I would like to believe they liked Chopin, because I do.   We listened to the singles from the 50’s and early 60’s. Ricky Nelson, Righteous Brothers and the lot. Stuff like Judy, Raindrops keep falling on my head, Love Potion #9. Lovely cute songs, without a care in the world.   We listened to other stuff too, my usual bunch of favorites Springsteen, Genesis, Sting, Dido, Simon and Garfunkel. Nothing fancy, just nice music.   I always wondered which of the numbers, they really liked? If they did like any of them at all? When I played “Groovy kind of love” in loop for hours, did their heart yearn for a “Homeward Bound”, say?   I guess ill never know.   When Red Indians die they are said to “move on” to the “Happy Hunting Grounds”. Where the days catch is easy. The Nordic warriors were said to move on to “Val Halla”, the battlefield where one all ways emerged victors.   I dunno where Caviar will go, but am sure it will be to pacific waters with lots of other goldfish, plenty of food and Chopin playing in the background.   Ill miss you buddy.

        A drive back home - Abe Maslow Navigating, Me Driving.     Was dropping a friend home a few days back, she recently finished her graduation-post graduation rigmarole. So is officially now on the job-market, seeking gainful employment.   This particular friend is nice and sorts, but she is not one who is (I don’t know how to say this) evolved. You know?  I mean she is one who is comfortable and content with catching a movie, going to a discotheque. Not necessarily one who would philosophize, analyze or hypothesize on say an event, a movie, a piece of music or a book. But of course, she is talented and accomplished in her own way(s).   I mean she is more Sarat Chandra’s Rajlokhi than Kamal Lata.  More earthy than ethereal, more gut feeling than cerebral musings.   So at a traffic snarl, I asked her “So what you planning to do, now that your course is done?”   She: “I think the O&amp;M job will happen”.  Me: “Okay that’s great then, I mean you couldn’t want better, in your line of work can you?”  She: “Yeah”  Me: “What you glum faced about, got a great job around the corner, getting married next year?”  (To fairly long time boyfriend I must add)  She: “Then what?”  Me: “Then what…meaning what? Good job, good money, happy married life. Kids. What else?”  She: “Is that it? What’s great in that? That can happen to everybody and anybody”   “Great” + “Woman”. I think Martina Navaratilova. I have this mental-map thing, a woman talks about “greatness”. She must want to be like Martina Navaratilova!   I mean the woman ruled the courts for decades in probably the Golden Era of Woman’s Tennis, made a comeback when everybody, from John Mc in the press box to the guy who sweeps the stands, had written her off. And second only to Billie Jean King by way of being the public face of the Women’s tennis movement. Yes there was Steffi Graf and Chris Evert, but they relegated themselves to star-invitees at the Grammies after they hung up their rackets. There were a couple of designer brands thrown in too. Brand Ambassador monkey business.   Okay, digression apart.  What my friend said, made me think  (a) Is greatness an attribute of “others”, men/women who we read/read about/see on TV, will we never appropriate “greatness” for ourselves?   (b) And ever since Abraham Maslow, decided to study human need/evolution/motivation patterns, and put all of us into convenient segments of his famous little triangle. We seem to be comfortably numb in the little psychological pigeonholes he placed us in, and you know what? We like it that way!   It helps us calibrate, our degree of association/attitude in regard to other people. He/She is a “Cretin or a Moron”, so I will talk to him about the English Premier League or even better Baywatch! He/She wouldn’t understand Chopin would he/she? I can get away with something sarcastic and nasty maybe, he/she wouldn’t dare retaliate!   Alternately, he/she is this outstanding creative genius, a classical musician or a poet or something like that; we would balk at the thought of talking to him/her about “Wet and wild”. Oh gees! No. We should talk Dali or Freud, shouldn’t we?  Its incumbent upon us to be in awe of him/her, kiss the very ground he/she walks on.   Hmmm…I did the pigeonhole thing for a moment there, she is more the “Rajlokhi”, and so a job and a family life should be enough for her? Makes more sense, eliminates the possibility of a paradox or a fallacy. Rounds of the digits, balances the equation.   A “starving artist” is a social oddity, remember? Someone from the other side of the tracks.   Bottom line - our own little subconscious/conscious pigeonholing and straightjacketing, makes us more comfortable, more secure, eliminates the unknown and the unexplained. Does not bring forth questions, to which we have no answers. Fits in neatly with the axioms and first principles, which govern OUR world.   Maybe that’s why, “WE” ...can never appropriate, far less attain ...“greatness”.

       Hemingway and the Brothers Bacardi!   The Bacardi brothers, Don and Jose setup their first commercial distillery in Cuba on the 4th of February 1862. In the rafters of the building lived large bats, hence originated their famous "Bat" logo.  After the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950's, the Bacardi Company abandoned its operations in Cuba and moved to nearby Bahamas. The Bacardi Company and Fidel Castro, shared a not too pleasant relationship, Castro seized all of Bacardi's assets in Cuba. The company is reported to have counteracted, by financing many anti-castro groups along with the Americans.  Okay, the reason why I embarked on this small trivia-digging endeavor on the Brothers Bacardi is because of the lesser-known Hatuey beer. For those who have read Hemingway's "Old Man and the Sea" will remember the fisherman drinking "Hatuey Beer'.   Apparently Hatuey Beer is a Bacardi Brothers produce, and when Hemingway won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1956, the Bacardi family held a week long festival in his honour!  Cheers ...literally!

      Read an article on “Metrosexuality” earlier today.  According to which, a metrosexual would be a man, who generally is, 1.	Someone who color co-ordinates his clothes 2.	Listens to Kylie Minogue 3.	Goes to “independent” movies 4.	Cares deeply about exfoliation or even perhaps manscapes.  The Merriam Websters and other online resources, reliably inform me that “exfoliation” is removing of dead/old skin cells from the face and body, to give oneself a “younger” look.   Yeah it does strike a chord now, was out of town awhile back and was staying in this hotel, had nothing to read and neither was there anything worthwhile on the telly. So out of absolute boredom, I began reading up the packaging/instructions on the freebie toiletries.   A face wash tube had told me something to the effect of “exfoliate the skin with a scrub or a loofah, and then apply the face wash”. I didn’t proceed to use the freebie face wash. The thought that "exfoliate" might mean the mundane "rub", did cross the mind. But I really was'nt mentally and psychologically upto "exfoliation of the self". Maybe some other time, I had told myself.  The more interesting thing is “manscaping”, which the Internet informs me, is men shaving off their body hair. I have known swimmers and cyclists do that, makes them more “aero/hydro-dynamic”. But this manscaping is apparently for cosmetic reasons.  Hmm, quite a lot of work this whole metrosexuality bit!   Anyways I have Joe Satriani’s “Home” playing on Winamp at the moment, and it sounds surreal.  Maybe ill listen to Kylie on the way home, or maybe ill play “Home” in repeat all night :)  Cheers!

       When Time stopped at the edge of meaning   France v. England. What a match! One of the few times in recent sporting history that a big hype match/face off not only lived up, but in fact outdid, the anticipated excitement, adrenalin rush and general frenzy.    The last time a match so dramatically swung around in an Injury time situation was probably the England v. Cameron Tie in the 1990 World Cup.  Last night in the 89th minute, Zidane took the holy mother of all free kicks; it wasn’t just a memorable sporting moment or just a neat dead ball situation.   For Zsu-Zsu and his compatriots - Time literally stopped at the edge of meaning. It was a knifes edge - holding in balance - Val Hala and oblivion, the immortal and the quotidian, destiny and despair.    Mr. Zidane please take a bow.

       A Cup of Tea, Please!   The origins of the word ‘Tea’ can be traced to ancient China. Various regions/dialects of China had different forms of the word; the most popular and lasting forms are “Te” as used in the Minion dialect and “Cha” as used by the Cantonese.  Now all over the civilized tea-drinking world today, how they refer to their cup of joy, is actually derived from either the Minion or Cantonese versions.  For example Britain and most of Europe (Tea, Tea Party, Tea Rooms etc) use derivatives of the Minion word ‘Te’. While the Indian subcontinent, Japan and most of the Middle Easterners use derivatives of the Cantonese word ‘Cha’.  Okay, now a logical correlation that would suggest that we as Indians who use the word “Cha/Chai”, would actually have learnt/imbibed tea-drinking and tea-culture as a whole from the Canton Regions, or alternately from Traders/Trade Routes owing its origins to Cantonese China.  And by the same token, link Britain and most of Europe’s tea-drinking Culture to the Minion speaking regions of China.  But unfortunately, we aint in a perfect world and fallacies just never seem to run out. Figure this, though Britain sourced all its Tea from the Canton Regions, and more so all its trade routes ran through Canton. Yet Britain drinks “Tea” and not “Cha”!  Hmmm…interesting?!?!

      Was listening to FM awhile back, the RJ said something to the effect of “The next song is by, probably today’s most respected pop group…Michael Learns to Rock”.  And they played Paint my Love.  The first gift I ever received from a “girl”, discounting those related to me by blood of course, was the ‘Paint My Love’ CD.   I was in class 10, she was in 12, and we had a “thing” going. She was the most beautiful girl I had seen till then, and I was thrilled to bits.  I got it on a Friday, I remember clearly, because I had Physics tuition at 7 in the morning on Saturdays. Friday evening we had met, she had given me the CD, we hung out for a bit and then I got home, in a hurry…cause I had to listen to the damn thing.   I listened to the CD on my Discman, mindful that I have to sleep in time to be able to get up the next morning, I listened to half the CD at least before I was asleep. And it must have been blissful sleep I am sure.  The next day, met up with my friends, and excitedly told them all about her giving me the “Paint my love” CD. Kunal had said “It’s a pussy CD man!”. I hadn’t protested, cause I would have reacted the same way if he had either bought or been given that CD, especially by a girl.   I dug out the CD, and am playing it now. Hope to listen to all of it, before I sleep tonight. And I hope it will be blissful sleep.

       Carnations in a jute flower basket   At Lunch break today, I took a stroll down to the ATM. On the way back, I noticed a small little flower shop, operating out of a literally 2m by 2m space. Outside the shop, was this little boy, still a junior school-er, in a red basketball T and black shorts. The flower vendor was putting together an arrangement of Carnations, white, lemon yellow and a very light pink hue. The boy stood there, intently looking at the flower Vendors swift hands. The boy had his hands by his side, his fist clenched; I could see currency notes peek from the edge of his closed fist.  I went up to the kid and said a friendly, “Hi”, he didn’t acknowledge me with open arms; the whole don’t-talk-to-strangers bit was at work. I asked him whether he was buying that arrangement? He said “Yeah”. “Who you buying it for?” “Its my Mothers birthday”.  And then he smiled, a silly excited smile, and then almost immediately aware that I was after all “a stranger”, he put on the dourest look he could muster.   I kind of waited for a while, till the flower arrangements was ready. Carnations in a jute flower basket. It really did look grand.

       The Man who created the world as we see it today   A couple of years back, the BBC ran a show called “The Greatest Britons of them all”. Or something to that effect.   I did manage to see most of the episodes in that series, and it was very interesting, real good programming.  The important thing was the selection of candidates, who were on “show” literally. Winston Churchill Lady Di Isaac Newton John Lennon Charles Darwin William Shakespeare Oliver Cromwell Queen Elizabeth I Horatio Nelson Isambard Kingdom Brunel  My personal favorite was Isambard Kingdom Brunel, probably the least “known” off the lot. He was the finest, visionary engineer of the Industrial Revolution.   If the Industrial Revolution could be compartmentalized into two distinct constituents. The social-economic factors/fallouts, and its associated politics. AND the real engineering itself. The Manufacturing, building, planning, visioning, Brunel was God. He was the nuts and bolts man who dreamt and created with the drawing board as his canvas.  He engineered the underwater tunnel across the Thames; he built over 1000 miles of Railways, and three steam ships each of which when built, were at their time the largest sea vessels in the world! And a lesser known fact is that, he was the Consultant Engineer during the building of the Railways in India and Australia.  And if that is not enough, he was the creator of the broad gauge railway as is used all over the world now and also created a fairly environmental friendly “atmospheric rail system”, which propelled trains using compressed air pipes instead of conventional rail tracks with fossil fuel guzzling engines charging up and down. But unfortunately this met with limited success.   The reason I admire the man most is for his bridges. He built over a 100 of them in his life time, from small corner stone ones measuring a few meters, to arch wonders half a mile long. The man was commissioned to extend the railways, and as he went about his task of building tracks and making stations, he encountered the pesky problem of rivers, rivulets and man made obstacles. And the “bridge building” he had to undertake, is the forerunner to the nearly all the bridge designs that we know and use today.   When he already was acclaimed as a pioneer in railway engineering, he set his eyes on steam ship building. The biggest problem at that time was building steam ships which could actually store enough coal to propel the engines, during a Trans Atlantic journey. Brunel designed a steamship “The Great Western”, which he argued could carry enough coal to fuel the engines for a Trans Atlantic journey. Though the Great Western wasn’t the first steam ship to actually make the Trans Atlantic journey, the Sirius first made the trip from London to New York. The Great Western docked at New York only two days later, but had taken 15 days as opposed to the Sirius ‘s 19, and the Great Western reached with over 200 tonnes of coal to spare, while the Sirius towards the end of its journey, had to actually burn its cargo to feed its engines, as it had run out of coal!  His last project was the steamship “The Great Eastern”, it was the most ambitious maritime project of the century. The ship was 700 feet long and weighed close to 20,000 tonnes! For the next fifty years no ship was conceived/designed on even paper to match “The Great Eastern”. Entire docks and ship building yards had to be extended to accommodate a ship construction of this magnitude.   After many financial problems, the ship did set sail, but on its second day an engine room mishap claimed five lives. An accident caused entirely out of human error as opposed to a design/manufacture flaw. Nonetheless the accident was tragic, Brunel died a week later.

       Unclasped.    The sun disappeared unannounced; the world a drape of darkness. Trawlers out at sea crawled along the horizon; their small bobbing lights drew faint illuminated circles in the gloom, like small distant fireflies circumventing the night.  The cool of the night blew like the wind, slithering through my clothes and touching my self. The sea was a swirl of unrest, living almost incognito with a pacific self. Well almost.  Intermittent sprays of water it through up, were warm pointed needles pelting my face. Even after its rage subsided to rest as droplets on my skin, it lingered on. The sensation of being alive, the taste of salinity coalesced on my lips!   I sat there living and reliving those same moments arranged randomly by the divine croupier.  Then almost unexplainably I got up, brushed the grains of sand of my clothes and looked hard at the picture I had just disturbed. I walked along the sea, the softness of the sand and water at my feet. I, me, myself - a part of this living canvas that just stretched on forever, not particularly striking but so wonderfully crafted that no gaze however long and pointed, could make a mental inventory of all its wondrous elements.  I walked along the shore, no path to follow, no signpost to lead me astray and time was a handful of moments strung out like pearls.  I saw the crowd, the faces, the colors, and the laughter, a brushstroke with the rainbow as its palette. The crowd moved like an autumn leaf fluttering in a confused breeze, slow, drifting and hypnotic.   For an instant the imagery paused, unsure, and ponderous…only for a moment, a moment which seemed to last forever.  I had known her for a long time, flowing locks of hair framed her portrait of a face, a sun kissed smile on her lips, eyes that shone like crazy diamonds. She looked so happy, content and excited, those slow determined steps around the rejoicing fire. The wind in her hair, the music in her ears, and the song on her lips. The leaping flames of the fire, highlighted against the depths of her eyes.  She smiled and she laughed, her eyes twinkled, it was magical. Then suddenly, she blinked and the moment for me turned into a rabbit hole of darkness…she was gone and the glow of the candle was extinguished, leaving rancid wispy smoke.  I slipped through the dark wretchedness of the rabbit hole, empty, cold and anguished.  Maybe I was asleep and dreaming and have now awoken, maybe it is the puff of the magic dragon, maybe I am awake but in someone else’s dream…

       Hyperboloids of wondrous Light Rolling for aye through Space and Time Harbour those waves which somehow Might Play out God's holy pantomime.    Alan Turing, 8th June 1952   These were his last words, he committed suicide. Leaving a half-eaten apple laced with cyanide, by his bedside. A loss of innocence perhaps?  In 1950, Alan Turing designed a test called the “imitation game”. Wherein, if a computer could induce a human interrogator to conclude that it was human. The Machine would be declared Intelligent.   The ‘imitation game’ has since come to be known, simply as the Turing Test.  Turing prophesized that within the next 50 years a machine would succeed at his ‘imitation game’. Today 54 years hence, no Machine has yet come close to passing his test.  And till that happens, the mantle of ‘playing out God's holy pantomime’ will continue to rest uneasily and inevitably on mans shoulders.

       The King of the Coffee Machine and the Newtons Law of G!   At the Coffee Machine yesterday afternoon, two colleagues were discussing a recent astronomical phenomenon, which had found mention in the morning’s newspaper. I couldn’t help but   “listen in”. Talk veered towards the stars, and these people being engineers, subsequently, to the Newton’s Law of Gravitation.  They remarked, that the universe was maintaining its stability because of the equilibrium, which existed between the various forces of attraction at work. TRUE  If the forces changed, bodies would fall into each other. PARTIALLY TRUE.  At this point, I decided to interject and make myself part of the discussion, albeit uninvited.  I pointed out that if the forces increase, the smaller body would in fact ‘Spiral’ into the larger one, as opposed to simply ‘fall in’. And if the forces increase, the force by which other bodies (say other solar systems/stars) attract bodies within our Solar system, will dominate. So what we will have are, elements of our solar system, our planets our asteroids moving towards other Solar systems.  At this point, they protested, but weakly. But yet, we ended up screaming “Bets! Bets!”  Back home, last evening, I dug out my Physics text from college, and read up the bit on Quantum Mechanics.  And yes I have won! I haven’t forgotten all my Quantum Mechanics and specifically the Newtons Law of G, and this fact alone will enable me to lord over Coffee Machine Talk, for at least a week.  I can almost hear a friend of mine say “Small pleasures of a small man”, like she usually does.   Cheers!

       “The Day After Tomorrow”   2004/Fox Pictures/Roland Emmirch   You watched the movie, here is the real dope.   Yes, global warming is indeed a reality. The temperature of the earth went up by about half a degree Celsius in the last century. That might not seem much really, but it creates quite a domino effect, affecting the whole climatic system.  Basically the atmosphere is like an insulating blanket, which maintains a comfortable temperature on earth (28-33 deg Celsius, yes what we generally and approximately refer to as room temperature). With automobiles and other energy guzzlers, continually burning fossil fuels, a lot of carbon gases are being added to the atmosphere, this addition is further accentuated by rampant deforestation. Effectively the burning of energy sources from below the earth surface (coal for example) is increasing the energy above the earth’s surface. (Remember the Law of conservation of Energy).  The increased temperature makes the water in the oceans expand; this raises the ocean levels, creating bigger stronger waves. The increased energy in the oceans, leads to more frequent storms, and storm like activity – unpredictable, rough and extreme weather.   Ocean water is in continual motion, it doesn’t move in random patterns. In fact it flows very much like a river, i.e. bodies of water flow from one region to another, so as to maintain a balance in the system. Environmentally 'Currents' are the whole system of water flow in our Oceans, which maintain a critical climatic balance.  One branch of this Current system is the North Atlantic Current, which dissipates heat as it travels from the tropics to the Polar Regions. Now because the flowing water continually dissipates heat, it becomes cooler and its effective salinity/density increases.  Focusing on the salinity, the currents salinity increases as its temperature decreases, and by the time it has traveled from the tropics to the Polar Regions, it reaches its maximum Salinity or “Critical Salinity”. This attaining of Critical Salinity(Increased density) is of vital importance, as it causes the current to sink to the ocean floor and flow back to the tropics. During this return journey it absorbs heat, effectively moderating the temperatures at the tropics. So as is evident, the attainment of this “Critical Salinity”, actually maintains a temperature/climate balance between the tropics and Polar Regions. Ensuring that the Polar Regions don’t get TOO cold, and the Tropics TOO warm.  Now with Global warming, the glaciers in the Polar Regions will melt adding FRESH WATER (Non-saline water) to the Oceans. This extra fresh water will PREVENT the North Atlantic Current attain “Critical Salinity”. Hence the North Atlantic Current will NOT sink to the ocean floor and will NOT flow back and forth from the tropics. Hence the whole Current system will go awry. This ‘failure’ of the North Atlantic Current will actually drive down the temperature of the Polar Regions greatly, and yes hurtle the earth towards an Ice Age.  The North Atlantic Current has failed twice in recorded/studied history of the world, 8200 years and 12700 years ago. And yes these were our two Ice Ages.

       Acres Wild & Cream Cracker Biscuits!   It’s intriguing the way the mind works, how it stores scraps of time and space. Linking the most unrelated experiences into one cogent singularity.  The recollection of Acres Wild, the Jethro Tull song, is inseparably linked to the dryness of Cream Cracker biscuits. First year of college…I used to listen to my Tull CD and prep for my engineering exams. And yes munch away on Cream Cracker biscuits.   And even today, when I hear the song, what immediately flashes to mind is “Cream Cracker Biscuits”. Strange little memory map!  "Acres Wild"  I'll make love to you in all good places under black mountains in open spaces. By deep brown rivers that slither darkly through far marches where the blue hare races.  Come with me to the Winged Isle --- northern father's western child. Where the dance of ages is playing still through far marches of acres wild.  I'll make love to you in narrow side streets with shuttered windows, crumbling chimneys.  Come with me to the weary town --- discos silent under tiles that slide from roof-tops, scatter softly on concrete marches of acres wild.  By red bricks pointed with cement fingers Flaking damply from sagging shoulders.  Come with me to the Winged Isle --- northern father's western child. Where the dance of ages is playing still through far marches of acres wild.

        A City is where a large community is lonesome together...    Firstly the Lonely Planet Guides are good stuff!  The one I am currently using is dated, it’s a decade old but is still good enough to help me get around.   Went to Dusseldorf last weekend - a town and a city co-existing on the banks of the Rhine.  Eighty percent of Dusseldorf was destroyed during the last World War, so most of the city as it stands today is modern architecture. No town halls and stadiums harking back to the Renaissance, more modern office towers with facades of glass and steel.   The modern architecture though, is rather impressive. The Rhine Tower shoots skywards, crowned by a glass revolving restaurant, the view it affords is exquisite. It was a clear day, I saw the Rhine snaking through the forests and lazily circumventing the city, I could see right up to Koln with the naked eye.   The Frank ‘O Gehry towers inclined almost at 15 degrees are pretty neat, so is the media harbor, an enclave of television, broadcasting and newspaper companies from all over Europe.  The highlights of Dusseldorf though, are Konigsallee (Kings Alley, popularly known as just the Ko) and The Alstadt (The Old Town).  Konigsallee is a kilometer long boulevard, closed to traffic and dotted with open air restaurants and cafes. It’s the high street of high fashion!  It is lined by the flagship stores of most leading global brands. Europe’s most celebrated jewelers, perfumers and designers brush shoulders on the Ko, confirming its status as the single most expensive place to shop in all of Europe. If one manages to keep shopping and all its associated stress at arms length, then Konigsalle is a wonderful experience.  I sat at a Café for an hour, and saw the city pouring in and out of the Ko on a lazy Saturday afternoon. Lifestyles of Europe’s affluent were on show, a page out of a magazine peddling high fashion. And there was me, a guy from a country where the per Capita Income is 350 dollars and where famine still makes news once a year.  The only thing that I could think of was Robin Leach, and the way he every week signed of his TV show ‘The Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous’ with that one famous line, ‘Champagne wishes and Caviar dreams’.   I walked down the Konigsalle and then across Heinrich Heine allee (yes the street is named after the man, because he was born in a little house on its edge). A few minutes walk, brought me to the famous Alstadt.   The Alstadt is the only remaining scrap of old Dusseldorf city, its atmosphere is unmatchable. It has the typical Rhineland charm about it - gregarious, convivial and quaint. The Rhine runs along the Alstadt bound by the Rhine promenade. The kilometer long promenade has over 260 beer breweries and inns, giving it the reputation of being the world’s longest bar! There are quaint little family run beer breweries, which have been in operation for over two hundred years. Dusseldorf is famous for its local Alt Beer, a dark colored bitter sweet beer which flows more freely here than water through a faucet. Rhinelander’s drink their beer in small slim glasses unlike Bavaria where it is guzzled in tankards.   The Alstadt captures the spirit of Rhine Land, small wooden door breweries whose porch doubles as a café, large groups of men and woman animated in conversation, with laughter and good cheer hanging over the promenade as the late evening sun warily shines over the Rhine.&nbsp;   The Rhine like all major rivers, with its still murky waters, stands witness to the rites of passage of man and that of societies which have grown roots by its banks, almost as if it were marking time.

      &nbsp;  Video killed a lot more than the Radio Star...     Got thirty six odd channels on TV, of those BBC (always) and MTV (sometimes) are in English. Didn’t opt for ‘Kabel’ as they say in Deutsch.   By the time I get back from the Plant, its generally past seven. This far west, the sun sets late and in the evenings its nice to walk around the streets, sit at café tables and drink beer, or sit on the bench under the lime tree and look at the flaky clouds in the sky.   Sometimes when it’s late and there are still a few patrons dining at the restaurant, they leave the stone fountain running.  In the still of the night the water falling on the stones -&nbsp;sounds like syllables from a lost language.  Okay now getting back to what this whole&nbsp;post was about,   The first thing which struck me about European Television is the surfeit of Reality Shows. There are all sorts, gags pulled on celebrities and regular people. Blind dates of all sorts - the plain vanilla ones, girl going out with two guys and then choosing one at the end of the hour, girl and guy out for the evening - making moves on each other based on text instructions from friends, who by the way are watching the whole evening unfold on hidden camera.&nbsp;   Then there are those ones where a bunch of people are made to co-habit. On one particular currently running series, a dozen people are housed in this cottage up in the Alps. There are hidden cameras all over the place, and the whole show is an exercise in group dynamics really. The viewers are supposed to vote out one person a week, and the last man or woman standing end up getting an obscene amount of money or something. And then there is of course the German version of Big Brother, where an eye in the sky (more like a camera in every corner of the house) just takes over the lives of people.   It is said; the movies introduce or destroy social trends, while television actually mirrors society itself. The whole popular flavor of European Television is all about intrusion into the private lives of people, does that then suggest that the current European generation is one of degenerate compulsive peeping toms?   I think that is just the symptom, the malaise runs deeper. The Western world in general, has seen the whole sense of society, the whole sense of ‘the collective’ really going downhill over the last hundred odd years. Instruments of social cohesion - the extended family, the church, the local council have all woefully disintegrated, producing a generation of very lonely and isolated individuals. People who because they are not in touch with lives apart from their own, have this primal propensity to reach out to people, to see what happens in others lives, to get the inside dig about the fears, loves, weaknesses and passion of others.   Frankly , Reality Television is a reflection of this phenomenon, and the continuous camera totting interest in people’s lives is just a way to feed this overriding desire to reach out.   Look at it this way, in India for example, we still have the family structure fairly intact. We have big weddings - with the motley assortment of cousins, aunts, family friends and all of that. We still meet infrequently at least - for childbirths, engagements, anniversaries and deaths. Our festivals, the pujos or dusshera for example, is still about reaching out. It is still about pandal hopping, having people over in our homes, its still about visiting friends and family. Yes we do light our lamps in our houses at diwali, but then we either go out and meet with people or alternately open our doors to them.   Contrast this with the western world - Christmas is usually spent in the company of the Christmas tree. The mechanisms for social interaction and cohesion is eroding rapidly, society is just a word.   Maybe this entire social critique thing is just me bored and lonely at a beer garden on a weekday evening. Or maybe there indeed is some truth in all of these musings.  I don’t know, but I intend to find out...somehow!

        The Windmills and the Triumvirate     My white office door has a brick-red name plate which reads - “Spillman, Dieter, Guha”. The first a Nordic, the second a German, and finally I, complete the heterogeneous triumvirate.  &nbsp;  Doesn’t it sound like an odd little law firm ‘M/s Spillman, Dieter, Guha’?  &nbsp;  Anyways, the office block is at the end of the Hydro Plant, and over looks the hills. This plant produces Aluminum stuff for a variety of customers, Cola cans for Coke, inner side foil for milk cartons, automotive parts for Mercedes, BMW and Volvo and little rectangular aluminum food containers for one Bangladesh Biman.  &nbsp;  My office is this large room, with three desks. The one by the door is occupied by a Materials Management Consultant, the German Dieter, he the one of the “funky look”. Odd shaped eye-glasses, flaxen colored suits and perpetual stubble. He is picked up every evening by this blonde, who drives a single-door black Jaguar Convertible. They are quite a number, the car and her I mean.  &nbsp;  By the window, at two ends of this room are Spillman and myself. Spillman is an auditor, but looks more like a helpless little house dog. He has a cold and is looking miserable, but is waiting with baited breath for his vacation starting Friday, a fact he incants every hour.  &nbsp;  And finally me, writing this blog from a slightly dated lap top with a German keypad. Quite a challenge it posed initially. Beyond the window is this wide hillock, in shades of green. The dark somber green becomes more vibrant and leafy as it reaches the top. The hillock is dotted with windmills, which are disturbingly still at the moment. Am sure it doesn’t power the Plant or my little laptop.  &nbsp;  I am waiting for Christian Sielaff, the only German here who can speak in fluent English without having to overtly tax his gray cells or facial muscles, to holler out to me for lunch.  &nbsp;  The canteen is at the other end plant, a walk of a kilometer at least. Its rather neat and pretty cheap, I had pasta for lunch yesterday with pickled cucumbers and lettuce. I go with Christian not only because he is rather nice company, but also because he painstakingly translates the canteen menu card which is entirely in Deutsch. One afternoon when I did have to go to the canteen solo, with a prayer at my lip I randomly pointed at something on the menu card, hoping at least that it is edible.

        Under the Lime Tree    &nbsp;  Am in Rommerskirchen, Germany.  The last few days has been an all together new experience. Professionally, I am thrilled to bits - am doing real get-your-hands-dirty Consultancy. As opposed to sitting in office, pouring over emails and working out abstract business solutions.  &nbsp;  I am consulting for a Company called Hydro Aluminum; their plant is fifty kilometers outside of Dusseldorf, which sometimes feels like the beyond of nowhere.  &nbsp;  The best thing about the Consulting is that I am framing solutions in discussion with the actual business process owners - the logistics coordinators, the material managers and the plant maintenance guys. It doesn’t get more real. It’s the heart of business consulting and I am thrilled!  &nbsp;  I am staying in this village called Rommerskirchen, five kilometers down from the plant. If their ever was an idyllic village, this is one. A population of under 800, no English news papers, no bank, one restaurant, and one non-German inhabitant - me.  &nbsp;  I am at the Hotel Zur Linde (literally ‘The Lemon Tree’). It’s just off the main road, an old house lined with lime trees, a large patio and a wonderful little stone fountain in front. It has a restaurant on the ground floor, which when the sun is out, opens out into the patio. The house-specialty is Croatian fare. The first floor has three rooms, curiously marked 1, 2 and 4. Yes it is a hotel with just three rooms.  Currently I am its only occupant, so well I have a whole hotel to myself!  &nbsp;  Last night I put my lap top by the window, and played Dido. Walked down to the patio and sat on a wooden bench under a lime tree, the music faintly floated through the open window and filled the night. It was ethereal.  &nbsp;  It started drizzling. Typically, European rain - a light awry spray which wafts through the air and kisses the earth. The night was dark and desolate; Dido hung above me from the open window. I closed my eyes and let the whole experience enter all my senses. I could almost see a detachment of Nazi soldiers in their ferret hard-hats, stealthily troop past me from around the corner. Just like the movies.  &nbsp;  I thought of my life, thought of the day that had ended, tried to peer into the looking glass, but I still could see nothing. I could have lived my whole life like that, the confused drizzle, the cool of the night, a wooden bench under a lime tree and a woman singing songs for me.  &nbsp;  Phew…  &nbsp;  This has been the highlight of my trip so far, the black Mercedes which came to fetch me from the Dusseldorf Airport comes in second, a distant second though.&nbsp;

        I can only love her now, the way I used to…if I was GAY.      “I loved her because she was a woman. She had all the feminine qualities that I admired. Now she is cold and I cant recognize her anymore. She has become like me, she has become like a man. I can only lover her now, the way I used to…if I was gay.”                                                                          - Java Script, a friend.    Was talking to my friend Java Script (called so, because he dedicates great number of hours contributing to the bottom line of one Sun Microsystems. And that’s just him moonlighting, well that’s digression…anyways).  So that’s what my buddy JS had to say. Poor man is anguished over his long-term relationship petering out. Well I felt bad for him, truly did, I could see the pain as he said what he had to.And when he said “I can only lover her now, the way I used to…if I was gay.” It felt odd; sardonically I smiled thinking about the improbability of a man becoming gay, cause his ladylove had got one of those sex change ops done and turned into a man. A ‘Ripley’s Believe it or Not’, thing almost.  But I truly did feel bad, there is very little one can do when a relationship goes down hill. It’s almost like a body in free fall; nothing really is in ones control, all seems to be determined by the force of G.I just patted him on his back, talked over things for a bit, and offered him a cigarette. But could do nothing else really.  Read Navtej Sarna's "We wer'nt lovers like that", over the weekend. Maybe thats why the perspective is kinda skewed at the moment. Liked the book, found the end a tad incredulous though.   Hmm...but one never really knows about endings. They never really run its course, you know, kind of always has a sting in its tail.

        A peek within and without...     I am on a break, like one of those big televised snooker matches. A chance to run the gauntlet, for a while - without running into a wall.  Had two wonderful days Tuesday and Wednesday.  Two very different evenings, different experiences, both provoked thought, brought joy and reflection.   Here's what happened on Tuesday.   Went to an event showcasing George Sand, her Literature and her influences. She by the way was courted by Fredric Chopin for nine years, though their relationship didn’t materialize into marriage, kids or anything of that sort, it evolved and had influences of a wholly different sort, and I daresay more meaningful.   The whole reason I went to this event was because they were playing selected pieces of Chopin. The focus was on, how Sand influenced Chopin compositions, and how in turn their relationship influenced her writing. The literary machinations apart, I was there just to listen to the master.   They played four pieces, notably the Raindrop Prelude and the Impromptu Fantaisie, apart from a ballad and a Mazurka.  Frankly it was exquisite. Just exquisite.   The Raindrop prelude, as usual struck a chord with the soul. Impromptu Fantaisie was performed with great skill and flair. The bit at the end, the pianist’s fingers caressed the keys, and the keys responded with musical strains of in-ordinate beauty.   It was enthralling. As I sat there listening to Chopin, I thought about the greatness and universality of music. Chopin, a Pole settled in France, created such exquisite beauty – so full and true, that years later it has the potency to enthrall a room full of men and women, in distant Calcutta. I mean if this is not the mark of greatness, what is?   A creation of beauty, which has transcended time and space, and is applauded by so many for so long. In a wonderful everlasting way, touching all those who hear it.  It was truly humbling, the spirit of man and his abilities of creation.   Later in the evening, went out for dinner with some friends. It was a different sort of evening, a lot of conversation, airing of ideas and opinions. Unfortunately not something which happens much in a group situation, in my group of friends at least. Generally conversation veers towards, the common-past we as friends share. The life at school, movies watched together, and girls we knew, things we did collectively…da-da-da.   But that evening, we talked about all that is generally excluded, the thoughts and opinions of the “individual” and not so much “the friend”. While listening to one of my friends, talking about her experiences and its associated emotions and reflections, I wondered, “There is indeed so so much, to a human being?” In this whole process of labeling people as– scientists, doctors, sailors, hoteliers, we alienate the person itself. It’s like identifying a house by its postbox number and not looking at the house itself or the people and lives that inhabit it.   People have their own private, intrinsic, peculiar response/ emotion/ opinion about so many different things. Some of it is influenced by societal mores, some by what we read, learn or are taught, and yet so much which is just intrinsic and rooted to who or what the person actually is. The variety of emotions, a single event or thread of conversation can elicit from different people is staggeringly diverse, distinct and unique.  Wonderous aint it?   It’s the same bundle of organic matter, which constitutes all beings living. Yet we are so different, not different only by the way we look or the whorls of our finger prints, but so varied in the way we respond to an event, or draw from an event. Even the way we are affected by it, triggering various different emotions and mental processes in each one of us.  Cannot help but think of what Aldous Huxley once wrote, "Every mans mind is his own private literature".

        Of Mickey Blue Eyes, the invertebrate U.N and Hazel Contact Lenses!     Was reading an article on the excesses of the UN/UN backed forces over the years. There was this bit about the excesses of Italian soldiers posted in Somalia during the civil war, well the soldiers came, kept peace and left, having successfully sown their seeds, as it were. Records of troops committing rape and plunder in Somalia, would make the excesses in Iraq look like a garden party gone a tad awry.   Along with the article was this photograph of a Somali woman, dark skinned, haggard and impoverished, holding in her arms a child - dark skin, brown-black hair and blue eyes. Yes, blue eyes. Obviously the fallout of Italian Soldiers "sowing their seeds", and all of that.  I wonder why the goddamned plunderers in army fatigues aren't tried and punished? I mean, hello it's the U.N, aint it? Not the friendly neighborhood lending library.   Hmm...the Eagles in the "Last Resort",     Brought the white man's burden down  Brought the white man's reign...     I looked at that photograph, for a long while. Piercing blue eyes, set against dark skin.  Could be straight out of a 'United Colors of Benetton' advert. How sardonic, how ironic.   Aside from all of this, my mind wandered to a fest I had once attended when I was in school. A particular girl, whose name now escapes me, wore different colored contact lenses on each of the three days of the fest. A light hazel on a Friday, gave way to an emerald green on Saturday. For that one weekend she was the cynosure of many eyes, un-modestly flaunting her newfound 'look'. It had brought a smile to my lips then, but now I laughed, hard and loud.     Who will provide the grand design?  What is yours and what is mine?  'Cause there is no more new frontiers  We have got to make it here   We satisfy our endless needs and  justify our bloody deeds,  in the name of destiny and the name  of God     I wonder what Mickey blue eyes will grow up to be?

        Inextricably linked by the colonial master    Beyond the Grevenbroich  Bahnof  are the Turkish quarters. It’s a crisscross of lanes, with Turkish fruit sellers under sun umbrellas, shops on the corners with men huddled around a television, drinking tea in small bell shaped glasses and watching re runs of Galatasaray’s recent matches.  Conversation threads are invariably about Turkeys impending unification with the EU and how prices will soar, making the prospect of returning home, for expatriates such as them, nothing short of a pipe dream.  The Turks have migrated to every major Western European City, where they run the popular Doner-Kebab kind of joints, corner shops or drive taxis. While there is a general levity in the air, due to the way the Turkish are - laid back and high on bonhomie. One cannot help but detect the fact that everybody in a sense is ‘waiting to exhale’.  Last evening I was walking around the place when I came across a small four table restaurant, not surprisingly named ‘A la Turka’. Though small it is a bona fide restaurant serving authentic Turkish fare unlike the Doner Kebab joints, which are Turkey’s contribution to the world as McDonalds outlets are Americas.  I ordered skewered lamb, with salad and Turkish bread (not unlike our Nan). The cook, with a cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth was a friendly sort. He was quite delighted that he could talk to me in English, unlike his usual customers with whom conversations where exclusively in either German or Turkish. The man worked for many years with the British in Istanbul and through this association, he picked up not only British cuisine but also their language. The average Britt’s obsession with ‘The Indian curry’ is well known, and our cook from Turkey vociferously confirmed the notion. As he said in his slow drawl ‘The British people want to eat Indian curry even with their roast beef and Yorkshire pudding!’  The man took upon himself the professional challenge of rustling up a ‘Curry on the rice’ for me. And if I was to confirm its authenticity as a ‘Good Indian Curry’, it would be a major professional victory and ego-trip all rolled into one. In the man’s own words ‘It would prove that I can cook an Indian curry without ever having entered an Indian kitchen!’  He did rustle up good stuff, a very spicy chicken in thick gravy laid out over a portion of rice. Well it tasted fabulous, but it wasn’t a curry and much less Indian. But I didn’t want to break the man’s heart, and told him it was the best curry I had ever eaten. He was thrilled to bits! It was his professional equivalent of an astronauts’ moon walk. He shook my hand and fawned over me for like ever.  After clearing the plates he sat at my table, and we smoked Marlboros over a glass of Turkish tea. The tea is boiled for hours and has a distinct bitter aromatic taste; it is drunk with a touch of sugar but without any milk. Over Tea he talked about his days in Istanbul and the financial compulsions which had brought him to Germany. He talked fondly of his British Employers, and how shocked he had been the first time his Master asked him to pour milk in the tea. Which I gathered was blasphemous in Turkey’s tea drinking culture. I bid the man good night and in a typical large hearted Turkish way, he bid me a good life.  As I walked back to my hotel, snaking my way through beer gardens on the verge of shutting down for the night, I thought about the unmistakable irony which underlay the entire evening. The way a Turkish cook and I - born in post independence India many years after our Colonial Rulers bid us farewell, were so inextricably linked. And the fact that it took the quotidian curry for us to strike an unusual little bond, a bond based on a shared history of colonial rule and the heterogeneous Occident-Orient culture which emerged in its wake.  It’s been over half a century since the famed sun finally set over the empire, but the long shadows at dusk or ironically the afterglow, will form the sub text of our continuing presents and futures.

        Thinking of 'S' and lot more-less    Last night I caught the 9:45 from Dusseldorf to Grevenbroich. It is one of those two-coach suburban trains, scheduled such, as to take people working late back home. There were two girls sitting across me, probably waitresses, because they were still wearing their black tunics with white collars. They were chatting and sharing an apple, a country apple, the color of crimson fused with cream. In between laughter and animated chatter, they bit the apple, lipstick making red streaks on the cream.  I dozed off for awhile and some where on the outskirts of Neuss I dreamt of S. It has been a year at least, since I last saw S. Though I have met her less than half a dozen times, I did like her. Maybe not in a romantic kind of way, but I did like her. I liked her because of what she could have been.  She could be strong, independent and authoritative but often she inexplicably gave in. She was always beautiful but she had it in her to embody grace, but she never did. She could have been sharp and cerebral, but she wandered on the fringes of bimbette land. She could have made love in a sublime kind of way, instead she chose to fuck. She could have had the limelight forever, but I think she had stage fright. She could have used her wit but she used her cleavage. She had these bursts of brilliance which could streak the night, but she only touched a moment.  Its not that I am making a value judgment, but I did see something out of the ordinary in what she could be. I wonder where she is now, and I hope she is happy and all of that.  I am sure people have a million and more things they wish I was. Some of that stuff maybe real stuff and the rest prejudice - but I do know there is some very real stuff out there.  I have a confession to make, I fancy the Kate Winslet song ‘What if’, very popish in bits but I think it’s rather nice.  I am in this preachy frame of mind today. Let me push the gauntlet just a tad more, while I still can. By way of sapient advice, especially for my cousins, some of whom are on the threshold of college/work life. At the threshold of getting their hands dirty in the muck of the real, big, complex world, all whilst trying to keep ones soul pure and pristine and all of that. A world where we conceal all that is important and reveal all that is illusionary.  These lines are from ‘Love in the times of Cholera’. And it speaks a truth,   “He would never reveal it...not because he did not want to open the chest where he had kept it so carefully hidden, but because he realized only then that he had lost the key”
