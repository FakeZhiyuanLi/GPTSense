Hehehe... that's my brother. Dah lamer dier tak online... rindu jugak. But, nak buat cammaner..now he is a public figure. He must be really busy right now. Reaaaallllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyy busy. Never mind. Hafiz is still his no. 1 fan. My supportssssss are always with him.  Keep on bro!!!! Make sure you give your best tomorrow. As usual, I will watch it alone ( my friends must be sleep at home or study...) coz no one is at home... Dah biasa. Daddy tak tahu balik biler.

      I didn't get a reply from my brother yet. Wonder how is he now...maybe sibuk sangat.takper. Ari ni seperti biaser takder aper yang menarik kat sekolah. Just a few things yang really interesting. My teacher organized an activity that  I enjoyed so much. Best giler ( coz English is my fav subj. ). But Biology... alaa..malasnyer nak bacer buku. Trial will be in a fortnight. Next week is holiday. Maybe waktu tu baru struggle betul2 . kalau tak mana leh gi Australia cam my beloved bro kan? Oh ya... my teacher also tell a story about her student who now is in Russia. Well, it really make me excited. It is fun to be in a new environment and learn many new things. Well.. i wonder macamana agaknya tinggal di Australia? My bro - Zamil, my sista - Izan, my dad, my mom.... I Love You Guys....

Now i can say something that i wish i could say it long time ago. When watching Malaysian Idol with my buddies, I can say... " That is my beloved brother". Bro, you are the greatest singer i've ever known... keep on you good work and as usual, my supports are always with you.

      My brother will make a perfomance in the first week of Malaysian Idol finals. Hope he will make a great perfomance and of course, i will vote for him. My family wants to celebrate my birthday on the same day with the concert but i said i'm sorry, my brother is more important for me. so, they don't have other free time and i think that i won't celebrate my birthday with my family this year but hey... i still got my friends around me. I wonder what they have as a present for me. So, this friday.. i'm going to relax and watch my brother sing a song and becoming the first Malaysian Idol!!!   -I love you , bro!!!-

Two days after, is goona be my brother's first concert. I wish i could go and watch his powerful perfomance. But, I don't know, am I going to celebrate my birthday with my family? Don't know yet... I don't know if my parent can spend time  for me.I think i'll celebrate it with my friends.

       Balik dari sekolah pukul 1.20 tengahari. No one's at home. I wonder where is Daddy and Mama. Nothing to eat, just money from Daddy to buy something to eat. RM10, what am i going to do with that money?..don't know... Go to cc and I got a message from my beloved brother, Zamil. I wish i could be with him. I always dream of a brother. Now, he is my inspiration.  I wanna be like him. I wanna go to Australia. Leave Malaysia,...

      As I Look into your eyes I see all the reasons why My life's worth a thousand skies You're the simplest love I've known and the purest one I'll own no you'll never be alone My baby you Are the reason I could fly And cause of you I don't have to wonder why Baby you There's no more just getting by You're the reason I feel so alive Though these words I sing are true They still fail to capture you As mere words can only do How do I explain that smile And how it turns my world around Keeping my feet on the ground I will soothe you if you fall I'll be right there if you call You're my greatest love of all you are the reason i can fly and bescause of u i dont have to wonder why my baby you,theres no more just getting by because you're the reason i feel so alive  MY BABY YOU by Marc Anthony

      If I should stay I would only be in your way So I'll go, but I know I'll think of you every step of the way  And I will always love you I will always love you You, my darling you Bittersweet memories That is all I'm taking with me So goodbye, please don't cry We both know I'm not what you, you need  I hope life treats you kind, And I hope you have all you've dreamed of And I wish to you joy and happiness But above all this, I wish you love  I will always love you I, I will always love you Darling I love you I'll always, I'll always love you  I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU from Whitney Houston

        I'm just a kid who wake up at 6 AM daily and spending just 7 hours at home. Nothing special, just loves to walk around aimlessly because I love to travel around and make new friends. pretty busy with school activities makes me spend less time with my family. My dad, my mom, my sista ( who lives in Selangor ) always doing things on their own. Well, i'm not going to blame on them because they have worksssszzzz to do, and i can do my things on my own. Wake up at 6, go to school, back home at 2.15, go to school again at 3, back home at 7, go toschool again at 9 and back home at 11 is quite fun for me. My job now is study coz i wanna make my parents proud of me. Hey, the trial exam will be in a month time. 7 A's, yearrgghhh!!!
