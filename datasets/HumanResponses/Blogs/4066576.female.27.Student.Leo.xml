      Today, I worked from 11:00am to 6:00pm. Jay was waiting for me in Second Cup during I was working at St. Lawrence Market.  I ran into the coffee shop after work with lots of fruits and vegitables for free.  Those were from my work. My co-worker gave me some of fruits and vegitables whenever I work over there. I really appreciate her help and taking care about me. If I were her, I could not do like her. I should learn how to treat someone like her.  I met Jay at the coffee shop near streetcar stop in Jarvis street.   We were very hungry so, we took a streetcar for having dinner in a Korea Town. Our menu was "Gam-Ja Tang" which is korean soup. It was so delicious. We got home around 8:30pm. I already took a shower. Therefore, I feel so fresh and I am ready to sleep.   Now, It's 9:30pm.   My roommate, Jay told me that she prepared some soup and side dishes for tomorrow morning meal for me while I was taking a shower in a bath. I know she wanted to take a shower, too. But, She made some food for me because I have to wake up early tomorrow. My work will be from 7:00am to 6:00pm.  I feel so sorry to her and thank her a lot. And She is waiting right now for using internet after me. Everything is after me for her. How can I be her best friend? Maybe, I will never be her friend just as a younger sister. And She usually take care of me. Thank you Jay.   I don't know how to say for this great support. Just thank that is what I can say to her right now.  Wow... It's 10:07pm. I should go to bed now. I have to wake up at 5:00am tomorrow.  She is eating some korean snack which we bought in Christie after dinner. She quite enjoy that. I am so happy to see that. Whenever she eat something, It looks so cute and happiness in her face. Especially, when she have lots of whipping cream on her coffee. KKKK...

       I have been working at St. Lawrence Market about two weeks ago. My job is casher in a fruits & vegetables store. This job is so hard 'cause I have to stand from 11:00am to 6:00pm. That is only for Friday. Today was from 11:00am to 3:00pm.  For Saturday, It will be from 7:00am to 6:00pm. That is the most difficult day. You know what?  My work place has no chairs. That is why my job is so hard to do.    Now, I am home and My roommate is beside of me.  You know what?  I was idiot. After work, I was waiting a bus to go home.  Two guys in a fancy car had been passed by me while I stood at a bus stop. They asked me that " Do you have a time?"  However, I answered " I don't have the time, so I can't let you know the time, now."  IDIOT!!!!!!!!!!  I know I am a terrible listener.  Moreover, they were pretty hansom.  If I can go back to 2 hours before,  I would say " YES, I HAVE A TIME."    My roommate, Jay told me. " Billy, you have been in here almost 1 and a half year. What is wrong with you?"  She is right.  I need a boyfriend who is canadian.   I can say I was not so much foolish because they was listening music loudly at that moment.  That is the big point why I could not listen correctly what they said.

      I was going to use internet but, a teacher of NCA dosn't allow to use it because the students of NCA can not use internet during the class. I came here ealier than I expected so I am writing my dirary with Notepad program. I will copy this to my web dirary. It will take a long time 'cause It's now 11:34am.  I should wait until 12:10pm to use internet and also meeting Jay and my ex-teachers like Denice, Adam, etc. I was at Starbucks coffee shop this morning. However, I was so bored. Therefore, I decided to walk instead of sitting at the coffee shop. I walked and visited some store which is Artists' Material near the Wellesley subway station. I bought some material of drawing for Jay. I know this is not a specially day for her. However, I want to buy some gift for her birthday which is 30th Dec.  This is too early but I am pretty sure that she might be happy when she get those. I will not be able to buy a gift at her birthday so, I bought those today. Nowadays, I have enough money to live several months.  I know I have been working St. Lawrence Market and I can earn some money from there. But, I am not too sure I will be able to have enough money for buying a gift on December. Anyway, Now, I am in NCA and I have been waiting her. I want to visit the AGO which is Art Gellery of Ontario.  Today is Wed. which visit there for free. I heard that every Wed. we can visit there for free. Actually, I really want to see special exhibition which is about impressionism and we also have to pay for it. Now, Impressionism pictures are showed by the AGO for severl months.  I don't know exactly when the exhibition will be finished.   A few minutes ago, I met Jay beacuse she had to answer the nature call. She was passed by me and then She called me "Billy, What is going on?" and "What are you doing?"  and I said " I'm waitiing for you." ^^ Now, She went back her class. It is almost the Lunch time.   Did I mention that I bought two Whopper for our lunch?  Yes, I did. It will be very delicious to us 'cause we skiped our breakfast. I am so hungry now. I can not wait even the time is 12:02pm now. AHH

      It was suck... I don't want to think about today. TTC had some problem of power because somebody jumped to the rail for suicide today. Therefore, I couldn't go IAE for tutoring early. I had to walk from Finch station to Shapperd station for taking TTC subway. However, It didn't work at all even at Shapperd station. So, I and Jay went to the Finch station again to take a specially bus instead of Yonge subway. It took 2 hours to go IAE. Anyway, I met Ryan who is my tutor at York Mille station when I just got there by a specially bus.  I had tutoring at coffee shop in Eglinton with Ryan. We talked about some news from Metro and 24Hours and then Ryan read some articles which he prepared with his brother. It was so good like TOEFL test style. I hope he will bring these stuff for next tutoring. It will help me alot for improving my TOEFL score. After tutoring, I went to IAE again to pay for my tuition fee to  Omnicom as a TOEFL course. I had to pay about $953 for two months. The class will be started from 23th Aug. I have to wake up at least 7:00am. everyday from next week. The class will be so tough for me. I already mentioned about that the TOEFL course used to be so hard for me. It might be like that. However, I wish that is not so difficult. I will study from wed. at public library which is at Yonge & Bloor. For tomorrow, I will watch three videos which were rent from Eglinton library. And then from wed, I will study TOEFL and reading a book, Briget Johnson's diary second edition at Yonge &amp; Bloor public library.  Now, I am drunken because I drank a bottle of beer at home after visiting Hazel's house.I am so tired now. Maybe because of beer. Anyway, The better way is that I should go to bed right now. I will write my diary tomorrow again.

      Today is kind of busy day for me. It used to be less busy than saturday. However, Today was like saturday. In St. Lawrence Market is kind of famous place in Toronto. Every customer is from other countries. He/She just visits here for a trip.  Anyway, We never charge any tax and everybody can buy something very fresh things. Therefore, every canadian visit on Friday and Saturday for buying food. Specially, On Saturday, many people come here early time like a shopping with family. Everybody has a smile on his/her face. It is good to watch them for me because I usually get tired from my work. However, If I saw someone's face which has a big smile, It would make me feel better and be happy even my work was hard.  That's why I keep doing this job even though the job is hard. Anyway, I worked so hard today and I could not take a rest even lunch time, too. To stand one place for 6 hours is so difficult to anybody. For me, Definitely hard..  My work was finished at 6:00pm and then I went to the Second Cup to meet Jay. She was waiting for me. I got some fruit and vegitables from my work for free. We just got home around 2 hours ago. My roommate already took a shower and She is watching my blog right now. Now, my turn.. I have to take a shower and go to bed earlier than yesterday. Tomorrow, I should go to my work at 7:00am so, I have to wake up at least 5:00am.

      It will be started on 23th Aug.  I am a little nervous to study again. I have not been studying for a while.  Maybe, It was from Feb. Yea.. very long time, I didn't study.  That's why I have been worrying about study right after registering the school. I wish the TOEFL course is easy. It might be very difficult for me. It used to be very complicated to study for me. When I was in ETP which is a famous school to learn TOEFL and TOEIC, I could not get good mark even small test at the school.  I took the really TOEFL test which we call CBT(Computer Base Test) several time. It was so difficult to get high score. Last year, I applied three universities as a Architecture course. That major needs the highest score in every university. Anyway.. I failed to get into university this year. Therefore, I can not extend my visa with acceptance letter from a university.  I will apply again next year. I need a school to extend visa because I have a student visa in here. So, if I want to extend visa , I should get some acceptance letter from any school like ESL school or any university. That is why I registered Omnicom which is private ESL school in North York Center. Anyway, I want to say thanks alot to Jini and Eric. They help me a lot since I came here. Thank you, Jini.  I will never forget every your help.  I hope that I will get a chance to help you someday. ^^  ...  Now, My roommate, Jay is drawing now with some pencils which she bought today. She is quite enjoying to use those.  Tomorrow is Friday which day is my work day until Saturday. It will be so tough day for me. I have to take a shower and go to bed earlier than usual time.  Now, It is time to take a shower. I hope to write my diary tomorrow if I would not be exhausted after work. ^^;;

      I came again IAE to extend my visa.   I have been staying one and a half year in Toronto.  This time is second time to extend student visa.  I am sick and tired of living in here because I have to care about my study of English, visa, and money for a living.  I really want to take a rest and trip. However, I can not get a vacation for a while, maybe, at least 5 years.

      I wake up at 7:15am today.  Now... I am a little bit tired. I slept very well last night. But, I don't know why I feel tired. I'm at IAE for waiting my tutor, Ryan. He will come around 11:00am.  I visited library for returning rent videos in the morning.  However, It was closed.  Maybe, I was too early so, I couldn't return videos. I will visit library again after tutoring.   I earned some money from part time job yesterday. It was so hard anyway, I deposited  $100. ^_________^
