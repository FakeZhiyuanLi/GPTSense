      Our field trip could have been a little better. The way it could be improved is by having more time to go somewhere farther and more fun. What I got out of it was information and visual learning about fish and sharks. Although I am not coming next year, somewhere that you can go next year to learn about animals, besides the zoo, is the rodeo or to the H & H Ranch, maybe you can go to Moody Gardens.

      If I were in a ship that was hauntred, I would have been really scared. I probably wouldn't even think about going inside a haunted ship. Maybe if I was with a couple of my friends, then I would be a little less frightened.

      I think that these ghost stories are fact, they are true. I can't prove it, but I know. I don't know why I think that it's a fact. My mom saw a ghost once, this happened about 10 years ago. My aunt saw a ghost, well, I'm not sure if it was an actual ghost, but she said it was a monster. the monster was sitting on the bed next to her daughter. She said she was yelling at the "monster" to leave her daughter alone, the next night, the "monster" was gone.

      A time when I have felt as though I was in a haunted place was when I was at Mexico. I was at my Aunt's house, and my cousins and I were telling old mexican stories and myths. We were in a circle outside at night, around a small campfire. One of the stories was about La Llorona and her children. Another was about the candyman. We didn't try saying "candyman" three times, everyone was too scared to do it. I felt scared, i don't know why, maybe because of the candyman or maybe because it was dark at the time.

      The relative that I get along with and am close to is my mother. She is the one person I can count on, 2nd on the list is my sister. My mom is there whenever I need her. Even though she works 9 to 10 hours a day, she still manages to pay attention to her children. These times are really hard for her, economically and emotionally. To me, she is the most important person in the world, especially in this time of my life.

      One really famous tradition for females is a Quinceanera. A Quinceanera is a celebration when a female turns 15. It's basically the only cultural tradidition that I know and is Mexican. I, personally, didn't have a Quinceanera, but I had a party when I was 16. I didn't want a Quinceanera because my parents couldn't afford it. My sister doesn't want a Quinceanera, she wants a Sweet Sixteen. There are so many things involved in doing a Quinceanera. For me, there's too many things to do, and it's too hard to organize it. First of all, you need the Damas and the Chambelanes.
