      Before reading, please my post prior to this one.  Ive done some reading and researching on this whole Nick Berg video, and things just dont seem to add up...  I cite most of these claims from the following article, which can be found here http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A22819-2004May12.html   There are some very STRANGE circumstances that just dont fit together right.  For one, Berg had planned to leave Iraq March 30th the, but he was supposedly detained by the Iraqi police for "suspicious activities" before he had the chance to leave.  He was detained through the 30th, and therefore missed his scheduled date to leave.  However the FBI is telling Americans that they offered Berg a free plane ticket out of Iraq on April 6th and he turned it down.  Hmmm... think about that for a second, why would a man who wanted to leave, but was detained and prevented from leaving, and then offered a free ticket out, turn it down?  That simply defies logic.  The moment a rational person was released from that, logic would say his first concern would be leaving as originally planned.  So why turn the opportunity down?  Another very FISHY aspect to all this is that U.S. spokesmen Dan Senor denied that Berg was ever put into US custody after his detainment by the Iraqi police.  However he did say that US Authorities were aware he was in custody. However, according to the Associated Press, Iraqi police had no recollection of Bergs supposed detainment.  To quote the AP, "Senor referred questions about the reason for Berg's detention to the Iraqi police. In Mosul, however, police told the AP they had no knowledge of the Berg case. Police official Safwan Talal said the only American arrested there in recent months was a woman who was released soon afterward"  To make matters more confusing, being that Iraq is under occupation by the U.S, it seems unlikely that they would hold Berg there for such a long period of time without approval and permission of the U.S Authorities. All of this starting to seem very...wrong.  However, contrary to what the Authorities are telling us, Berg did in fact tell his family that he that U.S. officials took custody of him soon after his arrest and he was not allowed to make phone calls or contact a lawyer.  This was all heresay of the parents until they were able to present demonstrable emails stating that he was in fact in US custody in Iraq. To quote the emails (found on http://wcbs880.com/siteSearch/topstories_story_134141930.html) -   Beth A. Payne, the U.S. consular officer in Iraq.   "I have confirmed that your son, Nick, is being detained by the U.S. military in Mosul. He is safe. He was picked up approximately one week ago. We will try to obtain additional information regarding his detention and a contact person you can communicate with directly," the e-mail said.   "I have been able to confirm that your son is being detained by the U.S. military. I am attempting to identify a person with the U.S. military or FBI here in Iraq who you can contact directly with your questions."   So Berg WAS in fact in U.S custody, despite U.S claims that he was not.  Finally, the latest twist in this disturbing case, is that Nick Berg was questioned in 2002 by U.S Officials after his computer password he used in college turned up in use by Zaccarias Moussaoui, the al Qaeda operative arrested shortly before 9/11 for his suspicious activity at a flight school in Minnesota.  The FBI dismissed the case as just a college student who was simply careless about protecting his password.  But in the wake of Berg's gruesome murder, it becomes a strange and sickening coincidence that an American who inadvertently gave away his computer password to one notorious al Qaeda operative is later murdered by another notorious al Qaeda operative.  Noticing a trend here??  Other emails sent home to his family told of how he walked around Iraq freely, unarmed and unguarded.  Now why would he do this unless he had a reason to feel safe, something NO westerner would reasonably do.  If you have seen the uncensored video, you'll notice that Berg does not look noticeably nervous or even fidgety while he was sitting there with the terrorists.  He was almost eerily calm, up until the point where they attacked him with the knife.  There are few theories about Nick Berg.  One is that Nick Berg was set up by the American Forces to draw world attention away from what we were doing to the Iraqi POWs.  Perhaps he was a CIA agent who was becoming a liability and was set up by U.S to be abducted by Al-Qaeda, serving two purposed: Nick Berg being dead and no longer a liability, and turning world opinion to be more sympathetic to us.  Or perhaps most chilling of all, and what I tend to believe, he was assisting Al-Qaeda, giving them information and involved in their terrorist activities.  Al-Qaeda decided one day that they needed a white American to kill, and who better than the guy hanging around with them all the time.  Easy to capture, easy to trick, and just as effective to kill.  Whatever you choose to believe, you MUST look past what our press wants you to see.  This was not just an unfortunate random American civilian in the wrong place at the wrong time.  There is much more to this story, the outcome may never be known for sure, but as is with any government story, we must try to see past what they want us to see.

          I managed to get a hold of the full version of the Nick Berg video, and let me just say, its gruesome. I've seen some scary stuff in my life, but nothing really shook me like this.  It really opened my eyes to how horrible the Iraqi situation truly is.  Not that I never realized that we were in a bad way until now, but this really made be think about what we are still doing over there.      This whoke situation makes you wonder about a few things.  For one, why are we still trying to be nice.  We were nice enough to get Saddam out of power.  I feel that was a move for the better.  But now, after what they just did, why don't we film ourselves executing all their POWs in our camps.  Forget the political aspect of this war for now, because they clearly have.  If they have NO regard whatsoever for American life, why should we have any regard for the lives of their POW's?  If they wanna play, we should play right back.  If this was  truly  a war on terror, should be focused on eliminating the terrorists.  Clearly, by the looks of this video, we STILL haven't even done that.      Another thing that makes me wonder about this is why are the Iraqi people aren't getting upset about this!  I find it very hard to believe that the entire population of Iraq supports the actions of the Al-Qaeda terrorist group, so why don't they CARE about this stuff?  You would think that the majority of the Iraqi people would be apologizing about this!  Sure there are still some radicals over there who agree with what the terrorists are doing, but I just can't imagine the entire country supports this.     Even if they don't exactly support this action, why do they take it as common place?  Its almost as if the attitude of the Iraqi people (and some of us Americans too) is like "Well, its been happening for so long over there, its no big deal, that's just the way things are over there."  It makes you wonder how long it will take until this kind of stuff will become commonplace everywhere.  I wonder if in 100 years or so, people will get killed in the streets on a walk home over here and people will be like, "Well that's how it is over in America.."     I just really hope that we find the sick bastards what did this, and saw their heads off!  If we just let this slide and never find or descry Al-Qaeda,  I'll  run for president!

      For those of you who go to Stratford High School, you probably already know who Mr. Singletary is. But if you don’t, or if you attend elsewhere, Mr. Singletary is a teacher who, to the best of my knowledge, loves public schooling more than anyone I can think of. Don’t understand why? Take a stroll by the math wing at about... 742 AM, just after the first bell rings. You’ll undoubtedly find him standing on the corner SCREAMING the praises of public education. Every morning like clockwork its "OFF TO FIRST PERIOD! DONT BE LATE ITS A GREAT DAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY TO LEARN!!! STREATCH YOUR BRAIN CELLS EXCERCISE YOUR NUERONS!! DONT BE LATE BECAUSE IF YOURE LATE YOU MISS KNOWLEDGE, YOU MISS KNOWLEDGE YOU MISS POWER!! ITS A BEAUTIFUL DAY OUTSIDE AND ITS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL INSIDE ITS A GREATTTTTTTTT DAYYYYYY TO LEARN!!" This continues up until the 1st period bell rings. Its quite possible the most annoying, obnoxious and morale lowering events one can be put through morning after morning.   I used to stand idly by and watch this horrid display of over exuberant school spirit, hating it internally and wanting nothing more than for him to blow a vocal chord out so I'd never have to hear his unfounded praise again. Just the other night however I was dreading going to school the next day, and Singletary's voice entered into my head and it sparked something inside of me. I decided time had come for action. No one else was going to tell this guy to knock it off so of course I, being the only one at school to actually care about things I am vehemently against, decided to write him a three page essay depicting in detail the vast array of problems and negative issues of the American public education system. I then sent the essay to Jay and he added a paragraph about socialism in schools today.  The very next day, I waited in the hallway of the math wing for Singletary. When he inevitably came to begin his morning pep talks like a rooster having to crow every single morning, I approached him and gave him the essay. He looked shocked; either that I had the nerve to openly challenge with such an intimidating paper, or that I took to time to actually write it. Whatever the case, he took it, said he'd read it and get back to me.  Just today, I went out into the hallway to see if he was there. He came up and told me he would be coming to my 4th period study hall today to discuss my views with me. This should be interesting. Right now its only 3rd period, but there’s only about 10 minuets left to class so I’m preparing for what I expect to be a heated debate next period, and I’ll add the results in a play-by-play synopsis 7th period when I can access a computer again.  Okay its 7th period now. Turns out things didnt go as "heated" as I had expected. Singletary came into my study hall period and asked me to get up from my table and follow him into some quiet side-room away from everyone else. He then proceeded to tell me that the essay I wrote for him was one of the most well written and coherent essays anyone's ever given him, including in any of his actual classes. He then explained that he realizes that the system isn’t perfect and is in need of some changes, but he told me that it seems as though I demonize teachers too much for the things we are being taught. He explained that as far as individual learning goes, with class sizes the way they are it would be near impossible to cater to every single person's individual learning needs, and that teachers do their best to ensure that everyone is grasping the material by presenting it in visual (notes and demonstrations) audio (explaining the material verbally) and hands on (projects) methods. He said that most teachers will then review how the majority of the students respond to each method and focus on improving the ones that students dont perform well in. This particular example makes sense, however further into the conversation he started to reveal his weak areas. He touched on the part of my essay where I mentioned that school board officials are all government employees and therefore are controlled by a government who doesn’t necessarily have our education on the top of their priority list. He combated this statement by saying that the school board officials are all elected by the parents and in that way, parents have a choice in who makes the decisions in their school district. Now wait just a minuet, last time i checked the parents weren’t the ones going to school. I told him that I felt as a student I should be able to vote about whose educating me. The obvious answer was that i cant by law being that I'm not 18 yet. As you can see, no practical solution to this problem other than the suggestion that I appear and speak at town meetings was reached.   He then went on to address my statement that I made about how most people who have been taught their whole lives that teachers are the givers of knowledge and on their own cant learn anything new, go out into the world and become complacent followers. To this, Singletary asked me to call state and local town officials and get figures for how many people send in emails, letters or calls opposing or questioning their new policies, laws, programs etc. He told me he was confident that many people do opine to public officials and government representatives very often, and furthermore that these officials care what the people think and use their opinions and views in their own decision making process. I has not previously called and asked this question to any officials so I couldn’t present him with any figures I knew at the time, but I told him that I could say with almost absolute certainty that not NEARLY enough people care enough to make a stand. I gave him the example of a person getting their taxes hiked and complaining to themselves but not openly questioning city hall about the need for the tax hike, and he told me he knows alot of people like that, and he realizes it happens alot. He then offered no actual solution or option to this problem. Yet another issue left unanswered or resolved.  Singletary brought up my comments on how grades dont really reflect actual intelligence in that some of the people on the honor roll are the same ignorant thugs who just figured out how to cheat on a test or "cram" before a test and not actually retain any information at all. He replied to this with "In a scary sense, thats actual individual learning in that kids have independently learned how to pass." So I replied with "Well doesnt that just defeat the whole purpose of education in the first place in that theyre not really retaining any information you're being taught?" To this he realized he had no real answer and replied with a brief and shady "well... you dont really KNOW what they retain and what they dont...." and then quickly changed to the next subject ;)  Lastly, Singletary addressed my concerns with the need for certain subjects in school, such as chemistry or three required years of math, or foreign language. I explained how i will never need chemistry in my life, but the fact that i was made to take it and failed, which negatively affected my overall GPA. His answer was well thought out. He said that the reason we have to learn things like that is not necessarily for our career benefit, but more for our overall education as people. He said a real world example would be the issue over destroying the lordship marshes to expand the runway. He said in order to cast an educated vote on the matter depends on your ability to understand the consequences of ruining nature and the effects it would have on the stratford Eco-system. He said without knowledge like that it would be that much easier for the government to control people by telling them whatever they wanted, and without the education to tell fact from fiction, you would just blindly believe them. I told him if that were the case I would like to see real world education courses required in schools such as economics, politics, personal finance, etc. He agreed and said that requiring the all-encompassing "civics" course was stride in that direction, but is obviously not enough.  Over all I enjoyed our discussion. From the way he spoke he is a much smarter man that I had expected. I respect his views and I must say, out of every pro-education person I have talked to, he had the most well thought out answers. The fact remains however that many problems are still left unsolved, and no one seems to be trying to change those. One thing I will take his advice on is speaking at town meetings from now on. I plan to do so as much as possible. I didn’t post my original essay to Singletary here because it would make this entry even longer than it already is, but if you would like to read it, say so in the comments and I will post it.

This new blog will serve as a replacement, and what better way to start a new than with a blog engine created by the coolest E-Business ever - Google! Anyway, enjoy!
