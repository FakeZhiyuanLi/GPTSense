      I have had 'Try Honestly' stuck in my head all day which has been pretty cool. Other than that i didnt do much met up with jackman wooze chadwick and jess. Oh yeah i laughed at woosey's sister and cousin playin WWE. Seeing someone being dragged along on a motor bike and thrown into an electric fence while they are jus wearing a bikini never loses its appeal :) Anyways its Friday tomorrow, Fridays always make me happy because they are the start of the weekend yay!!!!!! Going to Birmingham on Sat morning with Matt if you wanna come just come I don't mind :) Everyone seems to think i have a frog fetish :/&nbsp;i'd like to put thinks straight, i don't have a frog fetish i just like frogs :)  Any way im bored and tired and scared and fucked up as usual :) so see yous!

      My Billy Talent cd came today yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!! I was listenin to that and then luke jones jus came and randomly called for me, i have to admit it was kinda scary but as loren ses meeting random people is good. So we went and woke jackman up which i enjoyed :). Then we went and called for wooze, when we got there we found out chadders was there so that made 5 of us. So we randomly went walkin up to balfour and met Gaz and his girlfriend ( i never can remember her name). Anyways after that me an wooze walked up to a computer shoppy place to see if they sold wireless cards but they didn't :/ But on the way back we met katie :) then we had one of our convos where we don't talk, Jess knows what I mean. then we found out she was meeting Jess and Jackman so we went along and ended up in the canal (very simplified).&nbsp; But inbetween i cut myself with a breadknife spoke to woosey's wahing machine which lex screwed up and carried my dog over hot tar. Its been a pretty cool random day i hope i have more of them. If you're reading this i hope to see you soon.  Tom

      Matt didnt come round today because he called called into work, kinda short notice methinks but if you get paid its all good :) At 2 today me katie and jess went on another of our cool random walks and ended up at the resevoir. The resevoir is soo cool is so big and watery and still. We counted something like 17 ducks and to remote controlled airplanes! Water is so cool i sometimes wish i could be a water molecule and fly around in the sky and get drunk and stuff it would rule! Paul (my guitar teacher) didn't come for some reason, i guess i will have&nbsp;to ring him in the morning. I have decided one of my lifes aims is to go to Japan at least once before I die, the gimicky, flashy tackyness of Japan just appeals to me. The people are really cool too. I wonder how many times im going to say cool today i have already said it 5 times :/ My washing machine is ignoring me today so i think i will make friends with the dryer and make it jealous, muhahahahahaha(cue evil laugh) &nbsp;it'll come crawling (or whirring?) back to me yet!

      Today was pretty normal saw andy in the morning and matt in the afternoon, been a pretty cool day i guess just nothing much happened :) I don't know how much more of this doing nothing thing i can do, its wierd i kinda miss the unpredictibality of school life!!! I didn't have any dreams last night :(&nbsp; I like dreams lol that sounded like Rosie and Jim&nbsp;that i was watching the&nbsp;other day. The bloke who drives their boat&nbsp;(ragdoll) is called neil and he found out&nbsp;where honey came&nbsp;from. The honey&nbsp;guy said: "hello&nbsp;neil, would you like to see where honey comes from?" &nbsp;Neil replies: "Ooooh yes please, I LIKE HONEY!" I thought it was pretty cool. I love having conversations with household appliances, have you ever tried to speak to your washing machine? I have and i'm telling you you're missing out on all the wisdom and knowledge that they hold. The other day it told me that the capital of Chile was Santiago it totally enhanced my outlook on life. I LIKE WASHING MACHINES! Dum de Dum I told myself that todays blog would be shorter so im gunna stop screwing your eyes up on my page and shove off  Tootleoo  Tom

      Well im back off my hols all the way in sunny Mundesley, Norfolk was ok i guess not much to do though the whole place was populated by kevs :/ well theres not really much to tell you about because nothing much happened the most interesting thing that happened was i found a stone with a whole straight through it so i made it into a necklace. Takes 5hrs to get there as well booooooooring!!!! Had quite a lot of time to think bout stuff and quite a few dreams (i think one was lucid!!!!!) &nbsp;so i will discribe&nbsp;it to you (not that you want to hear about it so im gunna tell you anyway so shut up). Ok, the scene is ancient greece and im some kinda warrior archer bloke in some army thingy, lol me a warrior :) Any way there was loads of people in this army and we were watching the sky because there was a large comet thingy in the sky coming towards the earth like in 'the simpsons'. There was all these rich important dudes having dinner in this house ona hill deciding what to do they had lots of food! Carrying the story on now, this comet thingy got closer and it was a scary flying monster!!!!! I was sooo scared and it was killing loads of people and nobody could kill it. So i ran up to the house where they were having dinner and i told them about it and apparently some of them were wizards so i made freinds with it and it protected me then my sis woke me for up. Damn her i wanted to kill the scary monster!!!!!!!! Well that was my dream if you are a dream person who tells ppl what it means please tell me what it means because i wanna know.  Oh yeah i saw a very green frog jump through my house and i just laughed and said ha a frog and didn't think anything more of it, now i cant remember if it happened or&nbsp; not its really annoying :( I like frogs :) Don't you hate it when people make it obvious that they don't want you around i kinda got that feeling today i wont say when, i just felt it thats all. Thinking also sucks in two years i could be at Uni thats really scary! I dont know how long this blog can go on for so I will stop now, if you wanna hear more about my sucky life speak to me on messenger :p  Tom

      I been feeling alot better today, thanks for asking :). I actually got some sleep last night so I didnt have to make up zebra stories :( Methinks i will make one up now........................done haha you will never know what it was about, maybe it was about you :p Anyway im going on holiday tomorrow so i wont be posting anything for a week. Think about it a whole week without you having to listen to me moaning on and on (yay).&nbsp;I watch this dude in Americas blog (  urlLink http://www.pasqualy.com/blog/ &nbsp;) and he got a load of baby possoms!!! How cool would that be?? You could form an army and fight the evil cats. You could give them all positions in army like corporal and major, but i would be the general.  POSSOM POWER!!     We are having our house painted while we are away i hope i dont come back and not recognise where I am that could seriously screw my brain up, I mean im already messed up how it is. *yawn* im going to try and get a good nights sleep tonight, I hope i dont get&nbsp;a bad neck, oh yeah feel free to call me a loser whenever you want because i am one.      See you in a week   Tom

      Didn't  get any sleep last night i was too ill. Its really boring just lying in bed waiting for morning to arrive there is nothing to do except make up stories in your head. I had quite a fun story going for me when i was a zebra who had been outcasted from the herd because i had superpowers. I had to go live in america and fight crime, it was kinda like spiderman because no-one could find out who i was. As fun as the stories were they didn't distract me from how shit i was feeling. Got up today at 7.00am and i havent eaten anything all day feels like im gunna puke when i smell food. Today has been so lame i've been bored because i cant do anything because im too tired and i feel like shit. I think i have food poisoning from drayton manor, crappy amusement park food they should be reported. Anyhoos i will start writing better stuff when i feel better. Sorry if i have snapped at you and said some stuff i don't mean its just because i feel so bad.  Tom

      Woke up this morning and i felt the same as last nite (total crappy sicky feeling) i still feel kinda like it now but its not nearly as bad. I had to have a guitar lesson and go to crappy school to pick my lappy top up. It felt so weird going back to school, it seems like years since i was back there. Also i have to go back there soon :/ I gotta get my suit soon lol should be fun going shopping for it. I love that feeling that you get when you dont have to anything for ages, its great. I got that feeling now. Can't really think of much to say tonite im tooooo boreded so i guess im gunna be leaving you now.  Tom

      Sorry i missed the post yesterday i got a new comp. New comp is sooooooo much faster and it now goes whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr instead of hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm(louder). Went to Drayton Manor yesterday its was quite cool went on everything apocolypse (once is enough). Felt like i was gunna puke after i went on pandimonuim but i didn't, Yay! Saw this really fit rocker chick who i thought i pulled but i probably didn't, lol it is me after all. She was tres good looking though, oh well i gotta expect it. When we were waiting for shockwave we noticed that they were only letting people on one of the cars. It made you wonder what was wrong with that one. Also when we were halfway up the incline of shockwave i noticed my safety bar thingy was kinda loose, not good to find that out before you are just about to go over a loop and two corkscrews, got a good pic though :) All in all that day was quite cool just Drayton Manor is starting to get boring now i've been there too many times, i really wanna go back to Alton Towers mmmmmm Alton Towers mmmmm Overpriced. Today i didn't do much im still really tired and i don't know why. Oh yeah i forgot to tell you i now have a new best friend called froggy. Hes my little mascot he rules so much, hes so mini hes great. I can't believe i forgot about him he is soooooooo cool. Anyway i just noticed that the times are in GMT after all thats good. Today was going so well until 2.30pm when i started feeling uber sick. I still feel like it now, massive headache dizziness and a really sickky tummy :( I had to go get my D of E booked signed by my former Tai Chi Teacher, that gave me an even bigger headache. To be fair all I wanna do now is sleep, i've got a damn guitar lesson tomorrow and i have to go pick my laptop up from school. Why it takes 1hr 40 mins to do that is past me. You're not gunna get any random thoughts tonight i feel to unwell.  I will speak to you guys when im feeling better (hopefully tomorrow)  Tom

      Got up at 11 today, soooo bored bored enough to watch the grand prix schumacher won if u wanna know. Been a total snorefest today and i didnt even get to eat sunday roast, we had lasagne kinda weird for a sunday night but still tasty :) Just been hangin around really, hanging around and thinking (not good). I thought today what if the world was made of plasticine, we wouldn't have to worry about asteroid strikes and the kids of the world would have something to do. I suppose it would be hard to grow crops and stuff in it so we would probably starve, still it would be fun. Also i decided im gunna talk properly from now on. I'm gunna be all like what-o and im gunna say grass the right way. Its gunna so rule, i give u permission to hurt me if im not talking like that when im with you (dont hit me too hard tho). ANyway im getting a new comp sometime this week so i might miss a posting if my network is down. Don't worry i will make it up to you anyway you want :p Going to Drayton Manor tomorrow should be fun i get to go on new rides (YAYAYAYAY!!). I will explain tomorrow, if i dont throw up. Thats your lot for today, take it or leave it.  Tom  P.s. I was thinking about pink plasticine so the world would look pretty.  P.p.s. I wonder what it would taste like.  P.p.p.s E-mail me if you know

      Didn't do much 2day at all, i wasnt up until 11am which is really kinda late for me. Took my dog out on a really long walk everywhere down the canal and stuff he kept annoying me cuz he kept walkin back across the road when cars were coming. oo yay im going for a balti in town in 1 hour mmmm spicy food cant wait. AT the gig last night there were loads of birmingham uni students and it made me think about how life never stops and how when you think of it the cliche is right, life is short and you should make the most of it. Its just hard to see that sometimes. Also i've been thinking most people are out to screw you out of anything or fuck your feelings up so you may as well never let your guard down to anyone. Its happened far too many times to me so i only ever let my guard down around people i really trust, not to do that to me. Anyway its Friday night and im gunna try and enjoy myself so this is it for 2day.  Tom

      Just got back from the Ben Kweller gig, he is amazing. Got a signed CD from willy mason, he was rather excellent aswell. I love Ben KWellers music it really talks to me and i can empathise with him. ANyway 1/2 way through there are theses two losers dressed up as axel rose and slash and they keep yelling things at BK, BK humours them at first by playing 'sweet child of mine' but then gets quickly pissed off with their abuse. He then procedes to yell at them and get them thrown out, but they ruined the concert for me because BK had to leave early because of a sore throat he got while yelling at them :( APart from that the gig totally ruled i got a t-shirt and a pin, I cant wait to go back to see him in september!!!! I'd Never been to the academy 2 before but now i apprieciate how close you are to the band, i could of touched BK if id wanted to. I enjoyed most of the night but towards the end i started to think of how i didnt have a girlfriend and i so want one. Oh well i guess im destined to be a single. Anyways its kinda late and i have a headache and my legs are tired so im gunna go sleep now (yay!)  Love you all  Tom

Also i got a pink t-shirt (which im wearing now) from Cult. That day was soo cool we should do it agian.  Later on i went to one of siobhans 'social gatherings'  and i had a bit too much to drink. Stuff happened there that was quite cool but also i got a bit messed up in the head and i would like to apologise to all i upset and offended while i was there.  Anyhoos i better be going nows  Tom

      Slept at Siobhans house last night and got absolutely no sleep, kyle kept talking to me all night about random crap :/ Had to go to a funeral today, i hate going to funerals but i guess its a fact of life and you have to live with doing it. After the funeral we went to see my great aunt and great uncle who live in great witley. It was great and they kept feeding me food, also i got to see all of cliffords birds :) Oh yeah i found a '4 star mary' albumn in my house i think it belongs to my dad so im listening to it now. I lost my Miles Davis Cd though im soooo annoyed. Today and yesterday has been so great seeing people i dont normally see and just generally having fun, i guess im never going to feel like this again after we get back to 6th form so im going to enjoy the pressureless bliss.  Im going to go and perpetuate my dreams now buh byes!  Tom

After that we went back to Roz's house to watch school of rock and drink. Was cool because i don't ever get to see or speak to those guys hardly ever :) LAter on we went to take George back to the train station but we ended up randomly walking to emma troths house who i dont know at all but now at least i can say i've been in her bedroom ;) Altogether its been cool today seeing different people, hope to see you again guys!

      Went to London today it was really really hot and I think might of found the coolest place in the whole of London, Camden Market. Its so great there its huge and there is loads of alt clothes shops i bought three shirts it totally ruled i'm so going back and i recommend it everyone. Apart from that i went to the ballet and went on a carosel. Today was so great i love going on random trips its what make life interesting. The trains were actually on time aswell which actually made the whole trip enjoyable the only thing that could have been changed  would be the heat, it was kinda hot. Anyway if you ever fancy going on a random trip with me to like London or Paris tell me because i can get free accomadation in Versailles :) Haven't seen you guys for a while but i hope to soon.

      Had a lot of time on my hands today, hmm maybe I should of finished that emo poem im supposed to write, ah well i'll do it when im randomly on the train to London tommorrow:) Lol whenever I look out my study i see a Linden tree and it reminds me of that O-ozone song, mines not very loving though :/ I so want to meet stephen carroll he's so my idol and i'm probably never going to see the weakerthans live unless i go to Canada, so stephen if you are reading this do a UK tour just for me :) I also wondered if i dressed like an indie emo, could i dress 99% indie and 1% emo? If I could that would be pretty cool. I'm so going to start songwriting properly next week and get my record contract haha then i weel be rich i tell you! Also i really want to make friends with a ghost! They must be so lonely and misunderstood. I want to befriend one. If you are one please e-mail me I want to be friends. Im going to end by leaving you to think whether 'hopelessly hopeful' is and oxymoron or not. I personally dont think it is but if you are hopeless and full of hopes i can see why people say it is.

      Dum de dum didn't do much today like usual :)  I watched two episodes of that 70s show which totally ruled!!! Well I didn't see the start of the first one :( Also just by searching around i found out that you can call a servitor up to help you slow or speed time up. (  urlLink http://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/fotamec1.html  ) I thought it would be pretty cool if this works. I have heard countless stories of people saying it does but im yet to experience it. Oo might be going swimming late aswell, just thought i'd tell you. I decided to do my blog now instead of later so i wouldn't forget,  if anything really interesting happens between now and tomorrow I will post another blog then :)  Anyway i better go and try to call up my Dragon Guardian Buh byes :)  Tom

      sorry dudes i couldnt update the blog yesterday because i was at a partay. Mmm a party with free booze is always good. Lol i think some people may have had more than their fair share of booze aswell. Some people really cant pace it when it comes to drinking, no names mentioned but they know who they are :) I feel kinda happy today must be the booze still in my system lol.  ALso i have had alot of support from people who talk to household appliances, theres alot of u guys and i would like to thank you for making me feel accepted :)  Yawnypoos i been kinda messed up in the head these last couple of days realising stuff i didn't before some of it is quite nice even though it might be kinda stupid to other people. I don't care thought its what i wanna do not other people.  Anyways i thought i better update this for the sake of it cuz no1 reads this :(  Tom
