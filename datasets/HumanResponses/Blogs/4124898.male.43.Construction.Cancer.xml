       The Old-Time Family  It makes me smile to hear 'em tell each other nowadays The burdens they are bearing, with a child or two to raise.Of course the cost of living has gone soaring to the skyAnd our kids are wearing garments that my parents couldn't buy.Now my father wasn't wealthy, but I never heard him squeal Because eight of us were sitting at the table every meal.People fancy they are martyrs if their children number three,And four or five they reckon makes a large-sized family.A dozen hungry youngsters at a table I have seenAnd their daddy didn't grumble when they licked the platter clean.Oh, I wonder how these mothers and these fathers up-to-dateWould like the job of buying little shoes for seven or eight.We were eight around the table in those happy days back them,Eight that cleaned our plates of pot-pie and then passed them up again;Eight that needed shoes and stockings, eight to wash and put to bed,And with mighty little money in the purse, as I have said,But with all the care we brought them, and through all the days of stress,I never heard my father or my mother wish for less. By Edgar

       urlLink City of Jonesboro, Arkansas : "History of Jonesboro The first settlers in what is now Jonesboro and Craighead County were the Indians. When white men began to arrive in Arkansas, they found the territory inhabited by Osages, Caddoes, and Quapaws. The Osages were warlike buffalo hunters who roved over northern Arkansas and the upper valleys of the Arkansas River. The Caddoes were peaceful farmers who lived along the streams of southwest Arkansas. The Quapaws (or Arkansas) Indians inhabited the east central part. It is from them that the name Arkansas (land of the Arkansas Indian) came. Voyagers, trappers, Indian traders, and adventurers were here shortly after 1800 trafficking with the Indians for furs and pelts, but no attempt at permanent settlement was made prior to 1815. Jonesboro, located on Crowley's Ridge and bordering the Mississippi delta, was selected as permanent seat of justice in 1859 when the county was formed out of parts of Mississippi, Greene, and Poinsett counties. Jonesboro was named after William A. Jones for his support of the legislative act creating the county. The county, itself, received its name through a practical joke. Senator Thomas B. Craighead, who represented Crittenden and Mississippi counties, was against the formation of the county and campaigned actively against it. Senator Jones waited until a day when Craighead was absent to call for a vote on the act. Senator Craighead didn't know anything about it until he got back and found that the county had been named for him."

      Hi all. My wife Kathy and I along with Kathy's mother Modean Ward Bramlett came to the reunion and enjoyed seeing everyone. Our link to the Smith's is through Albert Smith's sister, Maggie Smith Ward. We all had a good time. We took lots of pictures and I will post some soon. This is a great blog with lots of good info. I encourage everyone to visit and post comments. We don't get to Smith reunion too often, but when we do, it's always fun.  We live in Denton, TX. We have two children, Bryan, who lives with his wife Becky and son, Ben in Colorado Springs, and daughter Amy and husband Tony and son Bowen, with another one on the way and who are relocating to Austin.  I am very interested in genealogy. I have some family history on the Smith's which I will post here soon. The Smith's, as far as I've been able to tell, came to Illinois in the 1820's from possibly Virginia.  Bob Greaves

      Hello Everyone, Well we're back from the reunion.We all had a great time even though we all ate too much. Jessica said her diet was on vacation too!I came down with a toothache the night we got there so that wasn't much fun but it was great to see everyone.If you didn't make it and missed Uncle Kenny in the thong don't worry the flashbulbs were going off all around the room.I'm sure we'll have a picture of it on here soon.Thanks again to Aunt Marvelene for all her hard work.What would we do without her!Well I hope to see even more of you at next years reunion and don't forget to come back here often and say howdy. Lots of Love to all,Robert
