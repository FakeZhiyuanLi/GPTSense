      First it was Dad. We've bought a second-hand hard drive from the nearby church jumble-sale and I intended to install it into my desktop the moment we got home. But farking hell - because dad wanted all the wires behind the desktop to be arranged very neatly, he said 'Do it tomorrow' coz' he's tired on the other hand. What pisses me off is that he just couldn't make up his mind. First No, then Yes, then No... ...  Then it was Mum. Wanted her to dye my hair today. She said NO... coz' she isn't feeling very well today. Alright, I'm ok with that. But farking hell - she said she wants to dye my hair on National Day (that's about a week plus from now!). Crap sia... I want my hair dyed ASAP otherwise the colour will fade out. Mum says I wash my hair too much... ... c'mon! In humid Singapore, I myself hate having yucky hair!!!  But what to do? Gotta' give in to them. Otherwise, they'll come to me one day and say we've given in to you a lot already... why are you fucking up?'

      What else happened yesterday?    Well, I had the chance(s) to dance with a few girls :P. Gotta' let ur' hair down on da dance floor yea?    But the best time was the last song of the night. Most memorable :).    Managed to catch up with one of the pageant queens and danced with her to the tune 'Without You' by 3 Doors Down. (not appropriate, but who cares?)    And by far, that's the only thing I'll remember for hopnite. And that's what I'm there for...

      This is truly a night to remember man. Party, party, party!!!!    Today's my school 'hip' hopnite. I supported it coz' it's organized by the Student Union - and the Union rockz yo! Probably this is the only union that I will ever be going to support :P.    It started out with a beauty pageant of 8 contestants (few la... sad) - 4 guys &amp; 4 gals. Kinda' (yawn) coz I'm there for the D-A-N-C-E. Later, they have a couple of hip-hop performances by self-made artistes (mostly malays - they rock at this man!). The performaces were kinda' (yawn) too... DANCE man, DANCEEEE!!!    And finally, the DANCE segment came.    Began with the song 'Where is the Love' - i mean, 'Where is the o-so-good-up-tempo song?'. Fuck!    Anyway, it was truly a happy-hippy party (tell you more about that later... mum's chasing me to bed).    Goodnight for now! -_-

      Had my Microsoft Excel Practical Test today. And WOW... the test was 1 hour long and i finished it in 1/2 an hour. The rest of the people took longer :(. Shiok sia! Even had time to drink kopi...    Well, I guess I had mastered the Art of Excel ;P. But seriously speaking, I'm not showing off - computer programs supoosed to help you do stuff faster right? If you're gonna' take a long time just to finish a soft-copy, won't it be better to do a hard copy instead??? (taking the same time)    Gosh... what a SHOW OFF!!!

      I met a gal from IRC. From the start, she told me that she was in the same school as me. Unfortunately, today, she told me she is studying in another school.    Gosh! She had been lying to me all this while. Why? Because she didn't really want anyone know what her real school was.    But how can I trust her like that? Lots of doubts overcame me. Will she betray me next time? Will she have an angel's ring floating above her head with a devil's tail behind?    WHY? WHY? WHY ???    Whatever it is, I guess I'm just thinking too much. It's already 1am plus and I think it's time for me to turn in too...    Goodnight.

      Whew! I just finished all the exercises on LOOPS. What I did just now was the FOR loop. I won't go into detail about the FOR loop. However, all LOOPs have one thing in common. In basic english, it's like = Do this again and again until satisfied, then move on.    I'm kinda' like the typical Singaporean ya... I'm doing ahead of the rest of the pack when it comes to programming classes &amp; math. :P    Not only that... I've done programming! So I'm GOD! MuHaHaHAHA!!! !!!    Well, after LOOPs, its FUNCTIONs next. Maybe next time... no mood now :(

      I had programming lessons yesterday and it was the same old crap. The fucking lecturer wanted us to leave our laptops alone while he rambled on and on about a chapter. Which sucks.    I bear no grudges against him, however, I find his teaching technique really outdated. You see, in our new millenium, kids grew up with MTV and not with books and the olden-day kind-of radio. That means less concentration on whatever crap we are being forced to listen to. Well, my point is, WE CAN'T BE CONCENTRATING ON SUCH A BORING TOPIC, DUH???    Anyway, my belief is programming should be learnt practically (as in we program ourselves) rather then 'listening-to-teacher'. For a simple reason - I've done it and it works for me :).

       I can't wait for the latest update package that Microsoft is having up their sleaves. It's gonna' be one mega update (or rather, 'clean up') for the god-forsaken Windows XP. It was initially planned to take off on July, then August, then 'sometime soon'...    FUCK! Does the W in Windows have to mean Wait?    Wait for a more 'stable' version of the package? Alright... sounds practical because there should be some minor flaws to be cleaned up. However, for a people's computer-troubleshooter like me, here's some reasons why I can't wait:          Windows SP1 only fixes original Window XPs       Most people don't update their PCs         Since their PCs are not updated, they have their doors open to computing hell (aka virus, etc...).      Windows SP2 overcomes all of the above (I hope). However, if development keeps dragging on, more hell may arise and SP2's development has to be extended. Vicious cycle to me...    But for now, all I can do is wait...

       Well, I thought once I could be invulnerable to such epedemics. I used to... but now, I'm wrong.    I'm having a sore throat since last thursday and I've been under its torture since. Happy to say, it got much better today :). HOWEVER, I got phlegm in return. Yellow-coloured goo - most of the time. These bastards must have caused me my throat.    Crap! Can't people just spare a thought for others? Stay at home when you're sick la! Get some rest. Get well soon. Go away! - until you're healthy.    (Actually, I'm amongst those guity too. Got sick on the first week of school and still came to classes as usual. :P)

      Now I know how quitting smoking feels like.  AND Now I know how loving a stranger feels like.  Crappy. It's mid-afternoon now and I'm spending my time in the poly atrium with my ' lao po ' (laptop). I'm not as shag as yesterday, BUT inside me - in my heart - I wasn't feeling really good.  I used to rush in my BGRs. Like this: Hardly get to know the girl, then say 'I Love U!', hold hands and sooner than expected - POW! Gone.   BUT  this time's different. I wait, and wait... and wait - for the next time I could see her.  And what a coincidence, my  urlLink brother  is suffering the same fate as me....

      I've always wanted to make Teacher's Day very special.  So I have an EVIL plan. (- resounding evil laughter -)  I thought...  Of...  Going up to Mr. Ray Chua....  And tell him...  "Hi Mr. Chua!  No Happy Teachers' Day For You.  And I'm So HAPPY To Hear That You Have Been Demoted From Teaching The Upper Sec. To The Lower Sec.  Gosh... You Produce The WORST PHYSICS 'O' LEVEL RESULTS IN CHUA CHU KANG SEC. HISTORY!!! (so much so that Principal Miss Sim didn't dare to show it off on Speech Day - pathetic!)  Oh Ya... I Guess You Should Resign. You Taint Chua Chu Kang Sec.'s Name Being A Teacher Of Our School." And the rest of my class (mostly gals) would be really pissed.

      Yes... I'm feeling really, really Shagadelic now Honey! Not horny (don't think sideways!) - very tired. I knocked off at 3am this morning, woke up at 9.30am and was out almost the whole day.  Went out to study with my  kakis  in poly in the afternoon. I spent all my time drilling physics to  urlLink Bro Golden Hair . Curse my Physics teacher Mr. Chua - now I couldn't explain all the concepts very well to him. FUCK RAY CHUA!  Oh ya... I'll elaborate more on the stinkin' RAY CHUA in my next post.  After that, I returned to my pit stop at home to have my dinner. Kewl... it's mum's chicken rice with coreanda (I think :P). And it's off to Bukit Panjang to moonlight as a Computer Technician!  I spent almost 2 hours repairing a Compaq desktop. You see.... Microsoft came out with all these flaws and complications in their software so as to suck money from us people. However, they won't suck it from the people I protect! (I got a workaround for their greediness - MUHAHAHAHA!)

      This film is real touching, ya'all know? It revolves around the famous transvetite boxer in Thailand. Instead of buttering him up to paint a flowery picture of 'him', the film - instead - brings forth a sad (but undoubtedly - true) story of him. Especially those sex portions of the film when girls want to make love to him - he, unlike other men, would sob on their shoulder. That's why the film is so different! :P  On a whole, the movie talks about his confusion - of being a boxer or the beautiful lady he had always aspired to be.  Truly Touching :,(...

It's really dry for the first segment of the opening ceremony. Showed the history of Greece etc... and I couldn't pul though that segment. Felt really sleepy.

I could tell it was the coffee house (the SummerHouse) right away as I could see the glass panels at the back. This week's show was on Singapore's  kiasu-ness  when it comes to buffets.

      Kewl! Juz finished my Reflections 1 for my CATS module. *WheW*  Before that, I went to Sim Lim Square to collect my printer ink. Should have anticipated that dad wouldn't be able to collect for me - as in the LAST MINUTE, he was caught in the meeting *sigh*. Next time, I'll be my own boss!  And back to REFLECTIONS 1.... it was full of crap. A bit of praises and a sprinkle of criticism. Sometimes, I think that I repeated myself (true). And that's why I didn't want to read what I wrote for my Reflections... otherwise I'lll be doing the double job of having to correct what I find to be a misfit.  So what else have I got to do? Cut wires, math tutorial on trigo... YA! Write my friend a tutor...(ouch!)...testemonial. Getting tutorial mixed up with testemonial - they rhyme :P

It's the signature of Kill Bill Vol. 1 - one of the most sleekest (and hyperviolent) movie by the cult-director Quentin Tarentino. What I like about it? The trumpets and most importantly - the bass. It's the tune played when O'ren Ishii (played by Lucy Liu, for those of you who have watched the movie) walks in with her Crazy 88 death squad.  Can't get what I mean?

      And to celebrate my patriotism for National Day today, I didn't watch this year's national day parade 'live'. Instead, I went to Bukit Timah Market to have dinner with my family without wearing the national colours (red or white). After that, we went shopping at Bukit Timah Plaza (not really shopping - just got some daily necessities from NTUC). I chewed my chewing gum as I  browsed around NTUC.  Very quiet day today... guess most people must be serving the nation today (go national day parade, go spend singapore money in malaysian soil [malaysia boleh!], go make babies...).  And I came home at 8pm. Just nice - Singapore Idol starts at 8.15pm!

      Gosh... I'm real fulll this National Day. Dad bought back supper:      San Bo Hor Fun (White Hor Fun with Fish)     Yi Mee     Bee Hoon    Well, I stuffed myself with more of the Hor Fun than anything else. For one thing - fish is good for the brain and is low in fat. Furthermore, this is a special Hor Fun lor - white colour one. Most of the time it's fried until brown colour - see until sian liao.  Anyway, its a heck lot of carbos I had today. Two bowls of macroni for dinner... heavy supper... *sigh*

      Just had my IT Applications class half an hour ago. The teacher is one plump guy (like my dad). I bear no gudges against him... but I just think he should slim down. Because every lesson is cold - the air-con is set to sub-zero temperature and it just sucks. I'm like a rock-ice now and my left arm is a bit cramp from the coldness.  Too cold air-com also damages the ozone layer. He should be anti-envortmentally-friendly guy I guess. Eat up too kmuch of the world's resources (food, electricity...)

      I'm now at the canteen enjoying the breeze. Had a Electronic Practical Test earlier... and it rockz! Did everything beautifully - I measured all the values for the resistors, circuits, etc without bumping into any problems.  Killed the IT Applications Test last Thursday, Programming Test on Tuesday, and Electronic Practical Test today - that means I'm F-R-E-E!!!  But sian.  The practical lesson just now ended half an hour earlier and after having my Lunch - I had 1 whole hour of slack time. Crap sia... what am I going to do now?  Sian.

       I'm one guy who keeps making this same mistake. If there's soemthing that I want, I'll charge like a bull towards it. But come to think of it - by charging like a bull - the thing I'm after goes away. Sad la... but that's something I have to learn - how to be patient.  Patience... I should be patient. I should be patient.

      Here's some  urlLink interesting stuff  to read about Bush and the 9/11 incident. It's some facts extracted from the documentary-movie 'Farenheit 911'. i watched it and it was kinda' kool! It's like being released from  urlLink The Matrix  of fear and conceit - mostly influnced by the media.  Well, here's something really interesting: Bush was on vacation 8 months before the 9-11 attacks. Not a single meeting on counter-terrorism was held - he spent his time fishing and on his ranch caching  urlLink Armadillos  :P.  0.o Eye-opener huh?

        PASSIONATE LOVER. You love to love, always looking for a relationship. You cannot live without it. Your lover must be passionate  and you want that you and your partner melt into each other. He/She should not try to take the domination . You dont want a relationship without passion, and the sexuality plays a big part. The first moment you meet him/her is one of the most important. There has to be something between you , you cannot explain. From the first moment on everything must fix. But when this passion disappears you disappear to. For you it is better to leave than to see your love restrained.  PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you think about my quiz, I worked hard on it.You can always message me or tell me how I can improve that quiz. Ill sure write back.    urlLink       ~THE big LOVE TEST!! What do you need? With PICS! For girls and boys!~     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       urlLink This blog  sounds kinda' spaced out to me... because I find it wayyyy toooo literary for the common people (like you and me). I guess Dhiya is stuck in a Dilema... forever unsure. H and I call her a chameleon because according to what I heard about her in JC... she change to whatever group she mixes with.  Say if she mixes with red, she turns red. Lesbo group - she's a lesbian. And so on... I guess you get he idea already ya?  Basically speaking, she thinks too much. I understand her case - coz' I also think a lot too (and still do - although  a bit ).  Don't think too much la Dhiya!

      Yea... one of my brother is  urlLink complaining  about not being able to blend in with cliques and having a low-self-esteem of himself. Just to share with him one word of advice my godfather told me:   "Everyone in this world can betray you, EXCEPT your parents"   Get it? So, take it as a blessing in disguise if you couldn't make more friends ya? (I sound EVIL!) So, just be casual friends with them and for the 'Clique-ing' part... see how lar ya?  And I agree, people come people go. No hard feelings ya? :)

      Well, I had a quarrel with dad just now over a couple of MP3 CDs that I couldn't find. I remembered exactly where I (used to) place them but fark... I couldn't find em'! Dad keep nagging at me that it was already in my bedroom... he helped me to tidy it... my bedroom was in a mess... And all I replied to him was 'ya ya ya...'  Hope that could just shut his nagging gap. It fucking sucks.

      Remember the  urlLink Firefox plush ? Asked mum just now whether she would allow me to buy it - but fuck, she said no. Was I asking too much? Sort off - its costing US$15 (S$30), kinda steep... and she says that 'the company is already making its own money'. Whatever it is, it is NOT a company , but just a foundation living off donations.  Should have got myself a Debit Card earlier!!!

      I thought love was only true in fairy tales Meant for someone else but not for me. Love was out to get me  That's the way it seemed. Disappointment haunted all my dreams.  Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer Not a trace of doubt in my mind. I'm in love, I'm a believer! I couldn't leave her if I tried.  I thought love was more or less a given thing, Seems the more I gave the less I got. What's the use in tryin'? All you get is pain. When I needed sunshine I got rain.  Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer Not a trace of doubt in my mind. I'm in love, I'm a believer! I couldn't leave her if I tried.
