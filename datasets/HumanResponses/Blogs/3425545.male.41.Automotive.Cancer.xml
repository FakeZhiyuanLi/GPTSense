      One of those days yesterday....woke up sick...and dead tired from staying up on computer stuff all night.  Still managed to drag my lazy ass into work on time...but ended up coming home around lunchtime and staying home the rest of the day.  Felt sooooo bad.  Slept for about 4 hours with my head under the comforter...I just couldn't get "warm".  Feeling a bit better today...but still tired.  I need a vacation...or a career change.  Have lot's of work to do today....then even more computer stuff after work (house calls).  Gotta find a way to make this pay.

      A decade has passed since the birth of my son, Jake.  He is an incredible child....gifted, quick witted, charming and pleasant.  He does, however, posess some qualities that I wish he didn't inherit from me.  Impatience is one that leaps to mind.  Discretion is another.  He may yet get a handle on these traits.  I hope he does.  But knowing my own shortcomings, I doubt if he will.  Maybe that isn't such a bad thing.  If he manages to develop his positive traits, they may make the negative one's less of a problem.  I recall the day he was born vividly.  He has been a joy to watch as he has grown.  He excels at just about anything he turns his hand to.  He is an eager learner, and has been since he could talk. He exhibits so much potential, that he causes me to reflect on my accomplishments of the past ten years and count it as wasted time for the most part.  While he has rushed at every challenge head first, I have been falling back on the path of least resistance.  I wish I could harness his energy and channel it into a better life for myself.  That would be foolish and selfish though.  Jake deserves everything he has gotten so far, and I love him for doing it.  So, happy birthday baby boy.  Many happy returns of the day...i hope you live to be 150!  Think of what you could accomplish in that amount of time!

      Nothing excites me as much as having my own blog.  Finally a chance to let the world know what I think about every topic you can shake a stick at.  I really care little for politics and world news..I've always believed that the world will just keep getting worse until it reaches critical mass, then something REALLY bad will happen.  If that sounds fatalistic, well...who cares.  Anything outside of my scope of influence will require the input of others in order to effect chance anyways, so why worry about the prospects of a doomed planet.  Better to provide comfort and support to my family and peer network.  Everyone talk's about a "revolution" coming and the promise of a brave new world.  Think about it.  Every generation has thrown up it's own version of the hero prototype before the masses.  In every case, it is simply a flash in the pan of history.  The instant success of the "reality" TV series leads me to think thatwe are a nation desperate for a new leader.  Well, I don't really think we need a new one, or the old one's for that matter.  If we all spent a little less time on cursing the world, and a bit more on trying to find the things that are really right about it, we'd all be better off.  I have never watched more than 10 minutes of a "Survivor" type show.  The real revolution will not be televised.  In fact, it's never going to happen, at least within our lifetime.  Turn off the TV and go hug your kid.

      I made it through an unusually long and decidedly weird week.  It was actually a short week, due to the holiday, but it seemed to drag on and on.  I got a visit from a past ghost...my old boss and his wife came in out of the blue and bought a new SUV from me.  I always thought they were pretty nice people.  I guess my judgement is pretty fair, because it turns out they are.  I should probably still be working for them...but that was another life.   Speaking of work...My current boss is heading home to Jerusalem this month with his family.  I feel sorry for him.  He will be coming back about three weeks before his wife and kids come back.  That will be lonely for him, I'm sure.  I'll do my best to be a friend to him during that time.  Also work related....I'm gonna be a star!  You got that right....I will be starring in a series of local cable TV spots for the dealership I work at.  Shot the video and did the studio voiceovers this week.  Post production should wrap up next week...then they hit the airwaves.  I should probably tell my wife & kids...but I'm not gonna.  Let them be surprised.  Computer woes continue to plague me.   First Dave D's wife frigged up her box...over 3000 bits and pieces of spyware, adware and virii.  I rescued her and finally got wise and made them get out their wallet.  I know I undercharged...but I also figure they are CHEAP...so it shouldn't be my task to fix them again.  My buddy Mark S's box crapped out on him this week...it's sitting in the livingroom...begging to be fixed.  Mark's a good egg and will receive my prompt attention.  The box I was building for Lynn A was giving me nothing but grief, so I had to start over...more on that once it's fixed.  Renee T's box is going to need a wipe & re-install of XP and all the trimmings...she sold it to a friend for more than what I charged her for it.  That's ok though.  She's a small business woman and a real sweetheart.  And she let me make a little dough on her stuff as well.  Jake needs RAM.  The daughters both have wireless internet access in Angel's room.  Dad's a Party Poker junkie.  Speaking of Poker...won again this week at my sis's place....$42 in a 5 and ten cent game.  I was on FIRE!  Thats all for now...comments are welcomed.
