      SALT LAKE CITY -- If you want to do some serious soul searching, go find a secluded fortress with tons of mountains and religious zealots. It's overcast and cool, which I like, and quiet, which I really like. You're almost forced learn a lot about yourself real quick, which can be a good thing when you've had the kind of month I've had. It's a nice escape if you can find it, though the whole watered-down beer thing is a bit foreign to my lazy, front-porch mentality. Aahhh ... drinking too much these days. Smoking way too much.  And for what? Those who know me know that things have been tough lately, which is probably the biggest reason I started this blog. But I'm doing better. Those problems seem far away right now. So does work and anything else causing me to feel much older than 24.  The goal is to remember that it's OK -- and yes, healthy -- to let everything go once in a while. All that really matters is yourself and what makes you happy. I haven't been happy and content in a long time. It's about time I discovered that again. Life isn't all that bad sometimes.

      OK ... I've joined the blogger community.  I wish I had more too say about it right this second. I could, of course, explain the title, Web address and the title of the first post to the blog. But I'll just say I live footsteps from the U.S. Space and Rocket Center and I'm a huge fan of the Upright Citizens Brigade. If you watched the show, it's funny.

      CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. -- We're going to try a positive post for once. One great thing about this often rotten year is that I've gotten to see a lot of really neat places in just a few months. Seattle, Phoenix, SLC, Denver and now Chattanooga. If you've never been to this area of the country, you should. Chattanooga was awesome -- a rainy afternoon soaking you while peaking through the clouds of Lookout Mountain onto the entire city, it's worth the 1 1/2 hour trip. Plus, I got to visit with an old, good friend I was barely permitted to speak with just a few months back. Ahhh ... I moan a lot, but things are starting to go really well now, with work and with life. I was missing so much by being tied down these past few years. It's amazing how things like bad relationships can trick and consume you into being something you're not.

      You know on the news when they say so-so many thousand people are still without power. Well, it really blows to be one of them, nine hours after the "storm". Huntsville Utilities ... you suck.

      CNN re-ran its special on the Dean campaign tonight. While bored, and finished two hours early, at work, I watched it again. Still very interesting to see Joe Trippi talk about Jimmy Carter walking into a room of reporters and claiming not to invite Dean to Plains, considering I was one of the reporters in that room when the ex-President did it.&nbsp;Anyway, the CNN special was&nbsp;good stuff, showing the idealistic campaign workers excited when it&nbsp;peaked and the&nbsp;fallout when it ended. It's&nbsp;almost&nbsp;depressing&nbsp;to see, because you know it's coming and you can't stop it. And this folks, would be how I would describe my life in 2004. While watching this special again.&nbsp;it dawned on me that ever since Dean exploded all over himself in Iowa and lost the nomination, things have gone downhill, or at least are very, very different. I watched Dean's Iowa speech&nbsp;in the sports office at Herald in Albany, went to my apartment in Albany, talked to Deathcab (known then as Lacey) about how he blew it. But I still felt like he or my guy Wes Clark had a real chance. Now all of those things are not in my life -- dead to me, really.   Imagine the changes:  - I live in a new state, surrounded by new people. I really like the job title, but absolutely despise certain things about the job (not that it would be any different anywhere, really).  - Lacey became Deathcab ... the result of&nbsp;self-importance meeting ego city, the place Vermont resident Dean most wanted to take on.&nbsp;  - I hate John Kerry, but not as much as the other guy. Honestly, I don't want either of them to be president, but how cool would straight-shooting Dean be in a debate with Dub-ya?  - My guy Wes Clark wound up campaigning for Kerry.  - Lots of bad shit happened to&nbsp;some good people I really care about -- which is much worse than all the above-mentioned things.   Where's the good vibes? No one is excited about the election. No one is excited about the Olympics. Hell, I'm barely excited about getting out of bed in the morning.   I can't blame myself, so I blame Howard Dean.

      Here's something I hate about the South: all the damn republicans. I can't drive a mile without seeing a car with a "W" sticker on the back of it. Each time I see one, I want to stop the driver and&nbsp;talk some sense to them. But that's useless in the Bible belt, where it's more important what a politican claims is his belief rather than what he actually stands for in practice. Hey, I don't like John Kerry much, either. But the idea that our civil liberties and American soliders' lives are&nbsp;in peril&nbsp;just because Bush's evil administration needs us deathly afraid and blind to their imperialistic greed, that scared me more than a political entity has ever scared me. People in Moultrie, Ga., are genuinally convinced the next terror attack could happen at their Wal-Mart. I'm not kidding.  Who did this?&nbsp;The Bush administration, who&nbsp;keeps up "ever vigilant" with&nbsp;color-coded systems.&nbsp;If we're afraid, we need Big Brother to protect us. But the cost is the core of American freedom, what&nbsp;a real patriot would love about the sorted&nbsp;country.&nbsp;&nbsp; You lose Constitution rights, like the rushed-through Patriot Act took from us, you don't get those back without&nbsp;a war, folks, and not the kind where oil is the driving force. Don't get me wrong. I'm not a democrat. I don't hold the democrats in&nbsp;any higher esteem than I do republicans, because Kerry was one of the gutless pussies who let the Republicans waltz through this&nbsp;bullshit legislation in the aftermath of Sept. 11.  But I can't help but shake my head at all the staunchly&nbsp;conservative republicans who refuse to acknowledge the&nbsp;dangerous, malicious&nbsp;incompetence shown by our president and his administration.&nbsp; Until this country wises up and realized a third-party candidate really would make the best president, we're going to be forced to choose between dolts like this time after time. But I freely admit it, I'm voting not for Kerry, but against Bush, 100 percent. I feel this is most important election we've faced in my lifetime, and if Bush and the warhawks get another four years with this, then this country may very well become I place I wouldn't want to ... Excuse me folks, there's&nbsp;a knock at my door.

      And suddenly, everything changes again.  For the first time in almost seven years, I don't have a girlfriend -- at all. For the first time in seven years, I really have a good idea about myself, what I want, and why the single people I know are happier than the ones spending their&nbsp;best days on&nbsp;someone else.  Things with Deathcab (hear the band, figure out&nbsp;my little&nbsp;nickname) are over. It's strange, but I'm feeling OK about it. Oh, it's no fun, and I mean, sure, I'm thinking about it and all. I probably will for a while, but I'd already dealt with the worst part, the realization that no one is there for you anymore. Once that's gone, the rest is gravy, because now I know for sure -- no more back and forth, no more bullshit mindgames, no more hidden messages and tests, no more wondering if it's even worth it&nbsp;-- it's not.  Deathcab looked at everything she loved about me -- and wanted to change it, to mold me into every other worthless, spineless&nbsp;asshole.&nbsp;She won't respect who she ends up with, because that person will long ago have abandoned the idea of respecting himself. She wanted the norm, and she wanted someone who would do nothing but kiss her feet for the rest of&nbsp;his life. There's a word for men like that, and we both knew I ain't one of them.  As much as this sucks, it's nice to know I stayed true to my intuition and never caved in completely. Looking back, the&nbsp;worst thing&nbsp;in this whole ordeal was that I lost a piece of myself. The best thing is that I'm well on my way to getting it back.  To quote a wise man, "Whatever, baby."

      OK, I realize it makes little sense to start one of these things, and then never post on it.  Why haven't I? To me, it's a sign that I'm doing well. That I'm not thinking about her and I'm going on with whatever I've constructed of my own life to this point. Hoo-ray for that. The theme for life right now is "Bored in Alabama." There's nothing going on. It's been that way for a while, though, thank god, it should change very soon. I'm still torn about the whole girl situation, but the best thing is to avoid it, I've learned. Nothing will change soon. So leave it right there and just see what happens. As for everything else, Decatur as a town is cooler than I thought. But not much cooler.  &nbsp;

      DENVER -- OK, the altitude is no good for someone who smokes. I feel like I'm in a daze half the time out here, but the scenery is outstanding.  We drove from SLC to Denver on I-70 yesterday and it had to be the most beautiful drive in the lower 48 states. The highway reached near 10,000 miles high at points, as we skirted through grassed-over ski slopes and winter playgrounds for the very rich. Did I miss lovely Alabama at this point? Uhhh ... no.  We even went through Eagle, Colo., which I found especially funny. Actually, the most educational part of the trip was lunch in Provo, Utah. How anyone could go to college at BYU is beyond me. It's not exactly the party paradise. We stopped at a place called "Heavenly Hamburgers" and ate next to a Mormon girl who looked about 16 and had like five kids. I got fruit punch. You know, when in Rome. The hamburger wasn't quite so "Heavenly" and the girl got our order wrong three times.  Something about Utah gives you the creeps if you're not from there. Perhaps it's the whole religious ideology, but people have a strange look in their eyes out there. Denver is much more normal, I guess.  Well, except for all the John Elway signs. He owns a bunch of car dealerships or something, and everyone is a big fan. I fucking hate John Elway. That bucktoothed bastard beat my Raiders too many times for me to worship at his shrine.

      Ever been to Moulton, Alabama? Well, I can now say I have. Let me just say, backwoods Bama isn't as charming as movies may make it seem. Here's the thing, they don't believe in street signs in Moulton. They just don't. Therefore, the directions I printed off Mapquest left me driving through cows for an hour and stopping at hick gas stations asking, "Excuse me, where's Lawrence County High School," which is about as much a dead give-away that "I ain't from around there," as you could get. Strange looks and poor, local directions aside, I finally found the high school, and then had the coach get on me for being late when his team was still sitting around before practice (listening to really bad rap music, by the way, which is a post for another day). Sometimes it's cool to be a sports writer. Today was not one of those days.
