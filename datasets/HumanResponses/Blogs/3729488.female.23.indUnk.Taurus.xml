      went to the christian youth group's movie nite held at this girl's new richmond apartment, for the film "bruce almighty". hmm what, it was in the theatres last yr when i was soo busy with graduation and going to japan, that i didn't have time to go watch the film. saw the trailers at the time tho and it seemed really funny and i had actually wanted to go see it. and later on i heard that it was the best-selling jim carrey movie of all time. but i have to say, it wasn't as good as i thought it would be.. but maybe that's just me. oh well, it was still a funny film, and i really need all the entertainment i can get these days to go out and have fun, so that i can take my mind off from reality.  was so funny to know that the chiropractor friend eric was into 'sex & the city'.. i never know guys would be interested in that series as well! well he's a weird one i guess, haha. kept asking the apartment owner girl if he could borrow all the dvd for the complete seasons. but well, i guess guys could really learn something about girls and how they view sex from that series, so it's good. guys should go see that show! lol  met a girl there tonite tho. she's new to the group like me. it's actually her first time there and she went all by herself, brave~ and she really seems like a nice person and we got into chatting pretty well. plus, she lives in kerrisdale too, so it's really great cuz i can go hang out with her easily since she's so close by. and the other great thing is, she wants to see "Fahrenheit 911" too! so yay! i can go catch the film with her! all my other friends are not interested in a documentary like that. i thought sami would wanna see the film, since she majored in IR and is in law school now and stuff, i thought she'd be interested in this kind of political documentary, and we watched "the corporation" together. but well, so since the only person i know who might have wanted to see the film turned out to be not interested, i had to find those church friends, cuz i know some of them might be the type who'd be interested in this kinda film. and i was rite, someone else there tonite actually brought up the topic, and immediately 2-3 other ppl were all saying they wanna see the film. but huh, i guess i'll go ask this new girl to go see it with me, cuz we live close to each other~ haha  was quite glad tonite actually in meeting and getting to know her, cuz well, whaddaya know, you lose a friend somewhere but you gain a friend elsewhere too~ (^-^)v

      after getting DiorKiss in a hurry, cuz i was sorta already late, then went to pick up sami to meet up with mindy for dinner. found that book "wild swans" at sami's place. about 3 weeks ago i had an interview with a president of a real estate firm. ppl always ask me if i'm chinese or japanese cuz i can speak both languagues. after he found out i'm chinese, he asked me whether or not i've read this book called "wild swans" which i said no.. and he then went on to telling me what the book was about. apparently the grandma had foot-binding and used to be a concubine.. so he was like "well you know, so the warlord locks her up in a room and just goes to have sex with her once in a while".. and i was sorta feeling shocked but also laughing out loud in my mind.. cuz wow, i never ever thought that i would hear the actual word "sex" during an interview!! (^-^);; a friend was like "huh, maybe you would've got the position if you've read the book and know about it!" hah oh well... but it's always interesting to read new books anyways, and this one has been on my mind ever since that interview, so i borrowed the book~ gonna read it on my flight back to taiwan next week.. hah.  had dinner at pearl castle in continental. and hmm... i think i saw a guy whom i just met online this past week. gonna ask him tomorrow where he was tonite to see if it's really him tho.  went to silvercity riverport with sami to catch the film "the notebook" and wow even tho it's a friday nite, the place was soo packed! even more so than the opening nite for Harry Potter!! was quite shocking actually.. and not just for me only. some guy was really surprised how packed the place was too that he came to ask me what film i'm gonna watch.. hah.. but well then later i figured out it's got to be due to "Fahrenheit 911", and my guess was correct! there were TONS of ppl lining up for that film, *way* more than for HP!! i actually really wanna see the film too, being a fan of michael moore's books cuz well i'm anti-bush (even tho i support his stand on tw/china issues being pro tw independence). but well this film can wait.. i'm not in that a hurry.. besides, i don't really wanna watch that kinda heavy material on a friday nite. went to watch "the corporation" on a fri nite and even tho it was a pretty good documentary, i fell asleep towards the 2nd half cuz well 2nd half wasn't as good as the 1st half.. and it was like 10pm-12am.. and i vaguely remembered i had few hrs to sleep the previous nite too having an interview that day.  but anywayz, wow, what can i say for "the notebook"... it's like the best romantic movie i've seen in yrs!!! i totally love it!!! it's going up there in my list of fave movies definitely!!! story was soo sweet and pretty funny too! throughout the whole film there were remarks that made ppl laugh. and the funniest thing happened. towards the end, tons of ppl in the room were crying!! there were all these sniffling sounds.. and when the movie ended, everyone started laughing too cuz it was really funny that everyone was crying!!! (^O^);; probably the most interesting crowd reaction i've seen in yrs~  absolutely love the male lead actor, who's canadian btw, ryan gosling's character noah in the film. i wish there's a guy in reality like that! but i'm not a naive dreamer.. i know guys like that don't ever exist anymore in today's world. still, i'd recommend all guys out there to go watch the film and learn something from the guy!!! it's a must-see!!! and now since i love the film soo much, i'm definitely gonna go buy the novel too!!! have a tendency to buy novels after i watch the movies. cuz well if the movie's good enough, then that'd make me wanna go get the novel. hah~  was really annoyed by the couple next to me tho.. they started making out rite from the start of the movie!! the girl had her legs all curled up onto the guy's body, and the guy's hands were all over her body.. jeeez, if you wanna make out in movies, go sit at the last row!!!! don't sit in the middle~~~ or better yet, just go get a room~~~ aaargh, i'm definitely not gonna sit next to a couple ever again in theatres!!!  on my way driving back home around 12.30am, heard LP's latest single [breaking the habit] on the radio. i love LP, they are no doubt my fave western rock band. and other than GLAY, their fan club is the only one i've joined, well cuz i had wanted to go to meet & greet and to see cutie chester, lol. but well.. having said that, i'm feeling kinda uncomfortable these days, seeing how the record label is sorta exploiting them, cuz well, BTH is their 4th single off their album! usually they're only supposed to release 3 singles off each album! 4 singles are way too much! are they gonna just release every track as singles?!?? not that i'm not happy about releasing good songs as singles, and believe me, all LP songs are excellent songs worthy to be released as singles, but it's still kinda weird.. i dunno.. anywayz gotta call it a nite now. 2am~ good thing tomorrow's saturday and i don't have to wake up early for job hunting!

      got another call back near 5pm. looks like i'll be having 3 interviews next week, which means i'll be having a total of 10 interviews for the month of june. wow~ (^O^)v  then went to richmond centre sears to get DiorKiss lip gloss. apparently it's the one Dior cosmetics branch in the whole van that gets the products at the earliest date! it's really weird too tho, the Dior site, cuz so far only the canadian one mentions something about the new DiorKiss lip gloss (even tho the page isn't really complete)  has been *really* crazy this past month buying cosmetics tho, and no by cosmetics i mean only lip stuff. so far just this spring/summer i've bought the new Dior Addict Ultra Shine lipstick, Dior Addict Ultra Gloss, and now the new DiorKiss... not to mention i've also got both the Chanel new wet shine lip gloss and the lip stick... so that's what, a total of 5 lipstick/gloss?! yah i know i'm CRAZY. but i just can't help it. i love Dior, and i've been using Chanel lip gloss for yrs and they are really great. and of course, i can never resist the words "limited edition"... all the reason to drive me to have to have the stuff now. besides, the new Chanel stuff has cute names like "Miss Pink"... now how can i ever resist that being a Pink Freak?!? other than the lip stuff tho, has also got some Dior/Chanel nail enamels too and mascara... hah... looks like i can't buy any more cosmetics in the near future (^-^);;

      was supposed to sleep at 12am in order to get up at 6am to get ready for the interview at 9am. instead, went to sleep at 2am cuz i got too carried away in IM with some guy friends, asking them for help on how to approach a guy when both of you dunno each other. asking guys really is a lot more help than asking my gal pals.. whom when asked all said dunno cuz we are all alike in being too passive when it comes to guys we like. the advice i got from these guys all seemed pretty good and helpful.. now i just have to put it into practice.. hmm.. well that can wait. these days i don't have the mind for that yet. only got into that topic in the first place to take my mind off a bit from all the chaos, and it did take my mind off, which was good! guess i am really crazy.. talking about that td bank guy always cheers me up~  so then i ended up waking up this morning at 7.30am, frantically getting ready for the interview.. made it at last moment, whew. was so tired on my way driving to there tho. and then i heard OLP's [starseed] on the radio, and the strong beats woke me up a bit.. love the song. tho after the interview, i was still quite tired and kept yawning, so i decided to go get a cup of coffee at bean bros. on my way there the radio played this song called [accidentally in love].. and my does it describe my mood these days.. head over heals for the td bank teller.. lol  came back home and still sent out some resumes and also called a few employers to follow up, even tho i said my job hunting is on hold at the moment. around 11.15am stupid father called... and started yakking away all his fucking nonsense again for goddamn 1hr straight, same as yesterday. i swear i'd go crazy soon one of these days if he keeps this up. why's he torturing me like this by him living and not just go die from the heart attack and end all the misery...  after lunch went out to london drugs to get black printer ink. these days the black ink's used up pretty fast when i'm printing tons of applications like everyday. and then went to drop off a thank-u card at the post office for the interview this morning. hah.. some guy kept telling me to go to td bank today and practice what he taught me to the cute teller guy, and i was like i won't have time today to go there... yet i was already in the kerrisdale neighbourhood twice today walking around..  3pm - just got another call for an interview next tues. so whew, i'll be spending the whole day of tues in downtown again for 2 interviews that day. it's good that i'm getting all these interviews and call backs.. at least made me feel good about myself, tho i'd feel even better if i can get a job offer soon...

      *sigh*  cuz of the possibility that i'll be going back to taiwan too in a week, i have to put a stop in my job hunting. cuz most employers contact ppl by phone, and since i won't be in van to answer my calls, i have to stop, or else they'll just call and leave a msg in my voicemail, yet there'll be no one to return the calls anywayz. i will try to tell them to reach me by email in the upcoming month.. tho it really depends on them, whether or not they'd like to take the time to send an email..   so i was just clearing up all my applications and stuff.. need to re-organize all the files from time to time.. and see which ones i should call again tomorrow and next week to follow up..  aaargh.. i really hate to be leaving van now in the middle of my job hunting, cuz i might have to start all over again once i'm back.. then it'd be like this past 3 months have all been just a waste of time..  oh well, just want to come blog this while taking a mini break.. and will now be going back to preparing for the interview tomorrow. so far this week i have 2, it's been like this for the past few weeks now tho.. bleh~ hmm and there's one next tues too. oh well, even tho i'm holding back my job hunt, still gonna try my best for the interviews i'm getting now!! 頑張るわ～！！ p(^O^)q

      1.30pm - just came back from a 30min walk in the neighbourhood. went out for the walk intentionally to clear up my mind (and well to buy today's papers) but i think it was to no avail. this past 2 days have been completely turmoil.. i feel like i'm still in a daze as if this all isn't really happening. my mind's still a blur.  i feel like i've lost touch with reality somehow.

      got woke up at 8am today by phone call from stupid father. it's now 9.45am and he's still yakking away all his fucking nonsense. and i still haven't even washed up yet.  mom is still on her flight back, estimated 6hrs to land. and i dunno what's gonna happen after she goes back.  i hate time difference, i hate being here all by myself with a sense of helplessness worrying about what's gonna happen and yet there's nothing i can do being a pacific ocean away.

      ......and I'm back to living by myself again, after merely 18 days.  12.22am - just sent mom off to the airport.  was supposed to be just us two spending the summer together here in beautiful van.  12.48am - just got off the phone with mom who's waiting in airport.  i was so looking forward to going to high tea, and dining at those nice restaurants in downtown while looking at the sunset with mom.  or just walking around in the neighbourhood after dinner, looking at those pretty houses and gardens, in the breezing wind and warm sunlight, chatting away.  but now this is all shattered with her back to taiwan.  and this is all thanx to stupid uncle, if he hadn't gone messing around with my even more supid father.  my poor mom.. just arrived in van 18 days ago after some 10hr flight and only got over her jet lag this past two days, is now taking another 10hr flight back to adjust the time difference again.    mom, have a safe flight back, and take some rest, and i wish everything will be ok soon......

      today's probably the most tiring day of this yr. running over the whole city to richmond and then kerrisdale. mom booked the ticket this morning for the flight tonite, and so had to pack the luggages in less than 12 hrs. during all this frustration, the only thing that kept me to still be in an upbeat mood was that we went to td bank kerrisdale today and that the cute teller guy was there. mom got him actually, tho she had me go talk to the investment advisor first so i couldn't be there with her in front of the cutie teller. afterwards i told mom, and she agreed too that the guy is indeed quite nice looking.. and she said that during the whole time she was in service with him, he kept smiling and stuff... ah so nice. sigh, tho i probably can't see him again in the next month or so.. that's a bummer..

      so what, i admit that i'm indeed a selfish cold hard bitch. if there really is justice in this world, you should've already died from your stupid heart attack and be rotting in hell now instead of creating chaos in all of our lives. you keep asking me to share my personal thoughts with you. well, you know what, the source of all my misery and pain is you! if i really tell you that, you'll just be having another heart attack, which i so hope you will. yet i'm just holding back telling the truth to you now cuz i want to wait for the perfect moment. now is just not the right time yet. even tho i'm not sure when's the right moment, i know it's coming soon. and i can't wait for that day to come to be able to see the look on your face when you know the truth, that you are the root cause of my unhappiness.  i pray everyday that why don't you just die...

      due to the extreme boredom with job hunting and the extreme tiredness of the chaos in my life brought on by my stupid father and whatnot, i've gone to look around some sites that provide blogs and decided to come here to set up my first official personal blog...

      *SIGH* got no phone call back from that company i was waiting for today. have to say i was a bit depressed/discouraged. but i really dunno what's up with them anywayz. maybe they just haven't made a decision yet cuz everything's so busy on friday before going into the weekend. or maybe they were so impressed with that other candidate's 2nd interview today that they offered the job to that person first?! i just dunno. mom called eagerly at 5.30pm to ask.. but aaai, no job offer from that employer yet! will have to wait till next monday. if they don't call that day, i'll have to phone in before 5pm to ask them what's up. (>__  went out at 6pm to pick up vivian, the new girl i met at church youth group the other day, and we went to silvercity riverport to see michael moore's critically acclaimed documentary. wow, even tho it's in its 2nd week, the theatre was packed! even the front rows were crowded with ppl! it really is the best documentary i've ever seen!!! but well, i've only seen this and 'the corporation'.. hah. tho compared with 'the corporation' i like this one a lot more. even tho both films deal with heavy materials like capitalism/globalization and 911/war on iraq etc, this film was a lot more humorous and so i like it more. guess ppl just all love to see how idiotic bush is! lol!  love how the beginning of the film about the 911 attacks on WTC was done. was just a total blackened screen with only sounds, and then slowly changed into ashes and tons of papers flying in the sky and onto the ground. he didn't show the actual planes crashing into the towers at all. and by doing so, the impact was stronger. while staring at the black screen and hearing the sounds, it actually made you think of the 911 attacks as the way you remembered it. very tastefully done. and was glad to find out that vivian love this too.  apparently some ppl cried too.. cuz of the emotional mothers whose sons were killed in iraq. yah, very sad scenes. some horrible killing/injured scenes too. but yah, it's a great film, could totally see why it won the best film award in cannes this yr! at the end of the movie, everyone applauded too~ love it~ absolutely amazing film.  a very scary incident happened tho. towards the middle of the movie, this older guy sitting behind me left the theatre. when he was going out everyone in our row turned and looked, tho i didn't know why and what's happening, just thought the guy's going to washroom. but apparently not. a min later he came back in with 2 security guards, to throw out this young guy sitting in the row behind him. he's actually a pretty young looking white trash guy. he got sooo mad and kept swearing at the old guy for throwing him out. but apparently he kept doing that throughout the whole movie so that's why the old guy couldn't stand it anymore and decide to ask guards to throw him out of the theatre. but it was sooo scary when the young white trash was going mad and kept swearing... cuz he's only 2 rows behind me, and i was sooo afraid that he'd go nuts and start throwing things down at the old guy or something, and if he missed, it'd hit me who was sitting like straight down!! was really relieved nothing happened and he finally left~~~ but anywayz the whole incident was just weird.. this old guy sitting beside me was quite confused and surprised too that we were looking at each other exchanging these confused looks.. (^-^);;;  after the movie at 9.30pm, went to rose garden to have bubble tea and dinner. absolutely love the pudding pearl milk tea at rose, it's the best i've tasted anywhere!! love pudding~~ *yum!* shared a gratin with vivian, and it's a pretty good gratin! tho really big, so good thing we shared~ stayed there for 3 hrs, kept chatting. she really is quite a nice girl~ we got into talking about everything, from drama to chinese/japanese/korean/french/italian cuisine, to comix and desserts and etc. really nice chat~ am really happy to make a new friend (^O^)/

      woke up around 8.30am today and has since been waiting for the phone call. i know they told me they'd call this afternoon at the earliest if they make a decision, but still, i wanted to wake up earlier to prepare and stuff. keep waiting... i hate waiting... cuz of that feeling of unknown... (>__  did get a phone call from this global logistics company in the morning tho. few weeks ago i went to the office to drop off my application for a position, and the manager came out to see me and we had an interview right then and there. she was looking for ppl who have a few more yrs of practical experience so i'm not that qualified. but i'm really interested in that company cuz it's a really big global company, so i kept stressing my interest and she was quite impressed with my background and everything so she said she'll pass my resume on to other dept for other openings. and she did! the sales dept has openings and they called me back today for an interview next monday! i accepted the interview, and if i do get a job offer later then i'll decline it~  well, in the meantime while i'm waiting for this possible job offer, i'm writing email to my elementary friend flora. just got her email this morning cuz i sent a letter to her last month after a mini reunion we had here with ellen and johnny. she's asking for advice on law school and national bar exam and stuff, so i wanna reply to her asap. but since i've changed to XP last x'mas, i've been having a really hard time typing chinese now.. it used to be easier and i could type pretty fast using this njstar program under win98. now with the XP IME it's so hard to type and it takes me a freaking long time to type up something decent.. bleh..

      Yay! Happy Birthday to Canada~~ (^O^)/  tho i didn't go to any celebrations today (^-^);; the past 2 days with all the interviews and everything have just totally stressed me out. so just rest in today~ overslept and did absolutely nothing the whole day except eat, read newspapers, watch tv, and of course, blog/IM. it's amazing how i wasted one entire day away just like that...  was supposed to pack and everything if i were going back to taiwan. i really am not looking forward to going back in the summer. the only thing i look forward to is meeting friends.. and well, shopping. have wrote down a whole wish list of the things to buy, like cosmetics, comix, and CDs. and i had really wanted to meet up with my elementary friends by doing a reunion this yr. and also i wanna meet up with debby.. told her i was quite possibly going back and that we'll go watch 'spiderman 2' together (^O^);; now that i'm not going back that's not gonna happen. i had really wanted to go watch movies with her tho, since we haven't been to the movies together after she went back to taiwan to work. hmm the last time we watched a movie together was what, for 'catch me if you can'?!? so long ago.. aaai, next time bah..

      so the 2nd interview was at 2.30pm. since yesterday with the 4 interviews everything was in such a hurry and all, i decided to leave an hr earlier today at 1.30 with estimated arrival time at 2.05. that'd give me ample time to sit in the garden outside of the office bldg to catch my breath and rest. however, since today's such a beautiful day, was soo crowded in the kits beach area so bus got slow and i ended up arriving there at 2.20!! lucky me to have left soo early!! whew!!  met the lady yesterday who had the interview with me first and i gave her the thank-u card. told her i had already written it by the time she called me back so i decided to just bring it in to give her directly instead of mailing it. she was really glad and smiled and said it was really professional of me to do that~ yay! well the interview today with the president went pretty well too. that company's funny tho.. they have pix of everyone on the site, yet no one looks the way in the pix!!! haha (^-^);;  i asked him how many ppl have gone in for 2nd interviews out of those 30 ppl who the lady said she's interviewed. and the guy was like nono, they haven't got that many applications, they got about 30 resumes, and they've interviewed like 8-9. (was really weird cuz i asked the lady yesterday "how many ppl have you interviewed"! she didn't hear my Q correctly?! hmm oh well..) and apparently i'm the first one to go in for the 2nd round of interview! (*O*) he said she was soo impressed with me yesterday she immediately asked me to come back for 2nd interview! and that now it's down to only 2 ppl, me and this other person who he'll have the 2nd interview on friday... and so they might make a decision as soon as friday afternoon! then start work on monday! WOW!!! (*O*) pray pray pray pray~~~ i hope i do get the job offer!!!!!!  after the interview, took the bus back, and again the bus was totally crowded! i ended up sitting beside this asian guy (most likely chinese i later on figured out) who ended up being a complete PSYCHO!!! he started chatting with me by asking me which country i was from... i'm like "uuuh.. i was born in taiwan". and he's like oh he's only asking that cuz he was wondering whether i'm chinese or japanese or... and i'm like "oh yah i can speak japanese too". then he's like "oh is one of your parents japanese?" i'm like "no.. i'm not mixed". these days i get mistaken a lot as either being japanese or being cbc who doesn't know chinese, even at chinese shops/restaurants!!!! see i go in these chinese shops/restaurants and ppl talk to me in english! even if i was with my mom! typically ppl can tell if i'm with my mom cuz she looks very chinese! but well, so i find it quite surprising actually. esp cuz it's happening here. i got mistaken a lot in taiwan and japan, but i've never got mistaken here before actually. anywayz it's interesting somehow i guess.. that ppl can't really tell my ethnicity from my looks, and i'll just have to adjust to that.  well, so the guy kept asking me Q about japanese and whatever and i'd answer him and stuff. then later on he just started talking about himself NON-STOP for like 15min!!!!! was sooo confused at first cuz he said he was framed for 12+ yrs and victimized by the system.. ppl screw him and so he screw them too and blah blah. then i realized he's crazy. later on i figured out he's just NUTS cuz he kept on yakking when i wasn't even replying to him! apparently he didn't care either if i reply or not.. and he talked pretty loud too so ppl in the whole bus kept turning their heads to look at him! aaaargh!!! (>______ (--__--);;;; how was i supposed to know he'd be a psycho anywayz?!??  was thinking whether i should get off the bus or not to avoid the crazy guy. but then i'd have to waste another $2 for bus ticket, and i really didn't wanna do that. (got scolded/laughed at by mom when i told her this tho.. she was like "it's just $2!!!!! you should've totally got off the bus to take another one!!!" hah..) i got a bit scared too cuz i noticed he had like 2-3 super big backpacks.. and i was thinking "what if it's bombs inside?!?" (*____*);;; cuz you never know rite? after all he's a PSYCHO!!!! and i was a bit afraid what if he follows me down at my stop... good thing there's a gas station and a grocery shop at my stop, so there'd be ppl there. so i was like if he really follows me it'll be ok too cuz there're lots of ppl around at my stop. was SOOOO relieved when he got off the bus on king edward. WHEW~~~  anywayz, i was in too much of a good mood today with the interview and the possible job offer that my mood wasn't really trashed by this psycho guy. only felt 倒楣竟然會碰上瘋子... one's already too much in my life!!! ah, and speaking of which, father told me i don't need to go back now cuz there's a typhoon coming. mom finally told him i've been job hunting and i may not go back anywayz cuz i'm waiting for a decision that may result in me starting work next mon. he didn't know i was looking for a job cuz we didn't wanna tell him. he has the idea that i don't need to go work anywayz cuz i can still live off, and so he's just weird. but well finally broke the big secret. even if i don't get the job offer and i can go back, i don't have to now. there's the typhoon and the super hot weather. so YAY! lucky typhoon! haha maybe only to me... sorry to those in taiwan rite now suffering cuz of the heavy rain/wind..

      AH~ am *so* exhausted rite now that my neck/back hurt like hell. man.. scheduling 4 interviews all on the same day really is way too much. not to mention cuz then i'd have to do research on 4 companies the day before as well. still ended up oversleeping till 7.20am... man i really have to stop doing that!!!! ARGH. last fri when i overslept for my intervew, that was still ok cuz that company's on broadway, only took me 10min to drive down there. yet today i had 3 interviews in downtown, so i couldn't drive there, or else my parking fee alone would cost soo much! so i had to bus there. and these 3 companies are all located near the harbour front.. which means it takes longer to get there cuz more ppl get on/off bus, esp since it was morning rush hr! (>__  had to run/walk to the first interview cuz it was at 9am.. was about 2-3min late (-_-);; had never been late for an interview till now! aah! was always 10min earlier! i missed a bus today so.. wuu. oh well but the interview went fine, i think?! she was still smiling all along and stuff, so i dunno if she really noticed i was a bit late or if she cared.. after the interview went to have coffee cuz i was oh-so-sleepy-tired. had it at 'cafe artigiano' located at the marriott pinnacle. was such a nice coffee shop!! i was there for like 1hr+ and the whole time there was a long line-up! ppl just kept coming in! non-stop! they have this 'latte art' thing which is so cute! they'd put foam on to your latte in the shapes of heart and stuff~ lovely~  2nd interview was with this asian guy. sorta nice looking too, but yay! this time i didn't get nervous that i'd start mumbling! haha! maybe i only get nervous around cute white boys?! (^O^);; but well, it's a tech company, so typically guys work there. after the interview when he walked me out, some other guy came to talk to him and that's a cute guy!! so i'd imagine there're lots more cuties in that company?!? (^O^);; was asked whether or not i know anything about online marketing. and i was like yah i've taken courses that had talked about it. and he's like 'so how would you go about marketing online?' i was like well you can get listed on search engines, and like join an online community like a web-ring or something. and he's like 'oh web-ring! interesting!' and he had this look that's like he was quite surprised and totally not expecting i'd say that. i suppose that's a good thing? so that he'd think i'm creative or something?! but well, this is a summer intern position that i just applied to randomly. didn't think i'd get picked for interviews~ hah.. so well, i'm still more interested in other perm positions, and to tell the truth, yah i really dunno that much about technology (*_*);;  had lunch at bread garden. actually i've never ate sandwiches there before. i've had coffee and other drinks and desserts there, but not sandwiches. but i always thought they'd have nice sandwiches, yet the tuna sand i had today was absolutely AWFUL! (>_  the 3rd interview. heh. this one's quite weird. at the start of the month i saw them post the job position on ubc career site so i applied to it. and one day cuz i was in downtown doing interviews so i went down to the office to drop off the application as well. asked to see the lady in charge and she was so not friendly! she's like she doesn't see ppl who come in. so i left. and afterwards no news from them. this past weekend saw them post the same position in the van sun, so i applied to it again. and they called me back the next day for interview! so i went in today, yet the lady i saw today was so friendly! and she didn't look like the one i saw last time! tho i really can't remember what that unfriendly one looked like either cuz i got a bit mad afterwards when she was so rude. yet both times i asked for the same person! weird huh!  the interview went pretty well. she actually said she remembers me for applying to the position twice, and she said they didn't call me back the first time i applied cuz they thought i was 'overqualified'!!!! (*O*) i'm not sure if it has anything to do with my stated salary expectations tho, they asked for that in cover letter. for my first application i stated quite high cuz i got confused by this stupid survey conducted by ubc commerce career centre. and i just realized last week that those were way too high! so i changed it for my 2nd application. i cleared this up with her tho, telling her about the whole thing.. even tho she said she can't remember what i stated for in the 1st application. later on i asked her how many ppl has she interviewed, and she's like about 30, and i was so shocked. most of the other interviews i've been too, they only interview like 7-15 ppl. so i thought 30 is a lot! and so i asked her how she thinks i rank in those 30 candidates, and she said i definitely rank quite high at the top!  was really happy to hear that and know they think i'm 'overqualified' tho. apparently it has something to do with the fact that i've worked at Fasken Martineau LLP (the largest law firm in van) and Colliers International (the 25th largest private companies in van). the other day this company called me for interview, and in the call, she kept stressing the point that the position is just an entry-level one so she thinks it may not suit me cuz i've worked at such big companies before. and i was like, but those were just summer positions.. and she was like 'oh! now i see on the side that it's summer jobs!' (^-^);; haha.. anywayz, so guess what, 3hrs after the interview, while i was just writing the thank-u card to this lady, i got a call back from her for a 2nd interview tomorrow with the president!!!!!! \(^O^)/ YAY!!!!! ガンバルゥ～～！！！ p(^O^)q  after this interview, i had to come back home to drive cuz the 4th one's in richmond. i've never got an interview in richmond before! well cuz it always turned out that the companies i found in richmond are located at the really far side of richmond!! so then i just don't apply to them anymore. but this one i didn't even know where's the company cuz i couldn't find it at all. but i still sent the application cuz well, sometimes i do random stuff~ i should've just turned down this interview yesterday when they called me back to arrange the time tho. have turned down 1 interview 2 weeks ago, again random stuff i applied to, promotional sales stuff, didn't think i'd get picked, so i applied.. heh. but well, yesterday this lady called me with strong accent and poor english.. i realized it's a mainland company but i still accepted the interview. doh.  i was like 10min late when i got there. cuz well, i got held up and left 10min later than i had planned originally. see, when i was coming home from downtown on the bus, i got a phone call for an interview! it was a restricted id call tho, so i picked it up. was SOO noisy on the bus that i couldn't even hear the guy's voice clear enough.. so aaah i didn't know what company that is!! (>___ __  it seemed like it might have been a nice company tho. cuz the guy had nice voice! i'm pretty accurate in figuring out guys' voices. so far all the times i've got guys who were the ones who called me back for interviews, they all turned out to be cute guys in nice companies! even the one this morning with the asian guy! he sounded pretty nice on phone too and yah he's nice looking (tho not super cute). but then i dunno.. this mystery guy/company sounded a bit gay too tho... so haha (^-^);; oh well see if he calls back tomorrow then..   so i was late for the richmond interview cuz not only had i left late, but the building was hard to find within that complex! i was walking around looking for it! aargh! it turned out to be this weird little biotech company that's also new! it's only been in business for 3 months! aah! and stupid mainland ppl! the president was a weird chinese man.. dunno if it was cuz i'm tall and he's short, so when we're sitting down his head's about to my chest height... or the fact that chinese ppl don't feel comfortable talking to ppl while looking directly in their eyes, his eyes were on my chest for a long period of time several times!!! EEWWWW (>______ ___  well, it's now 11pm.. i'm gonna sleep early tonite~ and i'll just do the other things tomorrow morning lah~ \(^O^)/ all in all, even tho it's a pretty tiring day, i have to say it's quite fulfilling too! having so much to do~ heh~

      so it's gonna be a liberal minority. ah well, at least the liberals won, whew. was really glad that the polls were all wrong cuz the conservatives didn't even come close to winning majority! yay! hmm tho we'll all have to see how this new minority govt's gonna work out. it's interesting to see how canada elects tho. the ballots were counted soo quickly! was amazing actually. voting closed at 7pm here in bc, yet by 8pm the majority of the votes were already counted and you can clearly see that it's a liberal win. wow, took only an hr!  stupid father phoned around 6pm to tell me not to go back. what the fuck. i waited till after the weekend to finally call in to confirm with the travel agency and they just sent me the tickets! and now you're telling me not to go back?!?? hah, you think i'd actually *like* to go back?!?? ifi it weren't for you who kept telling me to go back for months and now with this stupid incident, i'd never wanna go back in this blazing weather!!! jeeeeez. and yet half an hr later he called back again saying yah i could go back. DUH.  anywayz have 4 interviews tomorrow. WOW. gonna prepare for them now, still have 2 companies to research. and i gotta sleep at midnight or else i'm gonna oversleep again and that won't be funny this time. and well, GOOD LUCK to myself for the interviews tomorrow!!! p(^O^)q

      just came back from voting. (^O^)v it's the first time i've ever voted in my life. have to say that on my way walking towards kerrisdale elementary school to cast my vote i was feeling quite excited. but well, since it's my first time to vote, i have absolutely no idea how the whole thing works. apparently you take the ballot from the booth person, go behind to a secret booth to mark your choice, then come back to hand the ballot back to the person to tear off something... then you take the ballot from that person to put it into the box. was like a complete idiot ready to walk away after i handed the ballot back to the person, and he's like 'no no don't go yet~' and after he tore off something he gave the ballot back to me, and i put it into the box... and that completed the vote. felt great after voting too~ (^O^)  i voted for the liberals. even tho i really don't like how gordon campbell rules bc and there's the whole sponsorship scandal and whatnot, i still voted for them, cuz well, i'd never vote for the right wing extremist christian fundamentalist conservatives. so my only choices left were the liberals and the ndp. yet ndp is way too small there's really no chance they'd ever win, besides, they wanna do the whole estate/inheritance tax thing, now what the hell is that? apparently they believe that you should "tax 'em dead or alive"... jeeeez. so i'm left with the liberals.  it's quite scary tho, the polls these days all kept showing the liberals and the tories in a tight fight, or the chance of a minority govt. i'm sooo scared the conservatives would win, that'd totally change canada. and a minority govt is just a disaster, nothing good would come out of a minority govt cuz you can't decide anything within a minority. so i'm crossing my fingers here now, for a liberal majority win...  got another call for interview just when i was walking on the road and about to arrive back at my home. huh, i really do have 3 interviews tomorrow (*O*) tho i hate wearing suits on a sunny day... soooooo hot. and the forecast predicted that tomorrow's gonna be at least 24 degrees. aaaargh.

      ah.. so the england team lost. and it was beckham who didn't kick the ball in.. *sigh* poor beckham.. *sob* but well, no matter what, he's still my fave soccer player!!! he's got lots of talent, maybe it's just due to all the pressure he's been getting these days for the so-called 'affairs' that he's not as concentrated as he should've been and so he didn't play well enough. should really give the poor guy a break tho. besides, i don't really believe in those accusations that he's had some affairs anywayz. us taurus ppl are really loyal and devoted once we found the one, for us to betray is just totally unlikely! anywayz, i'll always support ya beckham! love forever!!! *kiss* lol  north americans here are really not interested in soccer. vancouver sun's sports section has like sooo little coverage on euro cup! practually none actually. aargh!! so i have to read the chinese newspapers for updates on the game. anywayz, love the july issue of vanity fair. it's got beckham topless in low-rider jeans on cover!!! *drool~~*  urlLink    David Beckham / Vanity Fair July 2004  he's not just a pretty boy, he's really talented in his soccer skills too. but for soccer games, a lot of the times other variables come into play too, so it's partially dependent upon luck. can't wait for the world cup in 2006~~~ sigh.. had talks with friends during world cup 2002 that we'd go to germany to watch the game in another 2 summers. but aiya.. really dunno how we're supposed to go when there's work and everything else.. *sob* but i really wanna see beckham play live!!! that may be his last world cup to play in!!! aaah!!! oh well... we'll see in another yr how everything goes...

      exactly one week after that whole shit with a so-called 'friend', on the nite of 622 father called twice and mom and i finally realized that something's happened. apparently uncle went to ask father for money to borrow, yet wouldn't tell him what the money's for and was kinda rude in his way of asking. and 24hrs later mom took the flight back to deal with the whole shit, since it's her brother who went messing around with father.  uncle lost money in the stock market. it's sad actually that some ppl just never know their limits. *only* go play in the stock market if you have the money and the leisure to lose, or of course, if you are bright enough and know what you're doing! when you don't really have money, you should know you don't have the luxury to trade in the stock market. besides, it's not like you are particularly bright and know a lot about those complicated financial stuff anywayz, so you're really just doomed to lose no matter what. 有的人就是沒有自知之明.. sigh. my grandma's sis used to lose money all the time to the stock market as well, and the debt she created cost her daughters to still be paying them back now while they both have their own families to support. stock market is just shit. stupid father keeps telling me to go deal stocks too and i keep putting it off. even him lost a lot of money to the stock market, why the hell can't he learn anything from it? jeez.  was soo mad at uncle that even i had almost called back to lecture him and tell him what his doing had done to mom and me. why the hell he went messing around with father anywayz knowing what kinda psycho he is? was he too naive or what to have never been clued in all these yrs?!? if you want money, ask mom! jeez. to go ask father in the first place without even letting mom know, now you won't even get a penny i tell ya.  over all these yrs i have seen numerous episodes of relatives/friends come to ask father to lend them money. i can just picture it now already that in the coming future, that'd be me, being asked by all my cousins etc for money. it's not that i'm particularly stingy or anything. it's just that i don't like to have money involved in both friendships and family relations. i don't like the fact that ppl just come to us cuz they know we have money. i really dunno yet what i'd do when i'm in that kinda situation. it's not like i will never lend money out to friends/relatives. but i really don't like to have money involved in relationships, any kind of relationships actually.  that so-called 'friend', hah, 2 summers ago tried selling me her direct sales cosmetics stuff. see, now that's involving money into friendship. remembered i wrote a whole long blog about this whole thing on love channel at the time. for friends to be involved in direct selling, there's a conflict of interest. she's in it for the money and well, possibly a little bit for the welfare of friends too to use nice products, but mostly it's for the money. yet the other party's interested in products that'd do them good. i'm not saying she was selling me those cuz she knew i have money; she only tried selling me those cuz at the time we were friends, and first step in direct selling is that you always try selling to your friends/relatives. but then i find it too often destroy the relationship somewhat, or just make it plain awkward. i remembered it was since that episode that i hardly went out with her, cuz i didn't want her to sell me those things again. it wasn't until this yr that i'm back to van that i tried to catch things up with her. but well, now that's off too.  maybe it's cuz of the fact that i'm the only child, i don't really have that sense of sibling relationships. i'm not that close to any of my cousins. not that i really care, but now that i think about it, maybe it's cuz i don't have bro/sis myself so i don't really know how to deal with them. but anywayz, this stupid incident definitely ruined my summer.. cuz now i have to go back to taiwan too to deal with my stupid father. the whole thing's not just uncle's fault, so yah, he's wrong in going to play in the stock market when he doesn't even have enough money and in going to my father in the first place to ask for money, but my father bears a lot of the fault too. it's just a simple thing to either turn him down or lend him the money. why the hell did you have to think of it as soo fucking complicated? jeez.  i just hope the whole thing will be alright soon.. if not before i go back to taiwan..

      have to say that no doubt this past 2 weeks have been the single most chaotic weeks in my life so far. 2 incidents happened, one with a friend and the other one with some family members, which have contributed to my constantly changing views on human nature. really wanna keep a record of all this, so here i am, blogging this all down.  last wed, 616, when i came on icq at nite i got an offline msg and a request for authorization. the offline msg had a mention about sugar daddy, and i was quite confused, but had a bit of a communication problem with the guy whom i later on realized has very poor english, and so he didn't tell me clearly at first what the whole sugar daddy thing was about. started talking with the guy, and then realized he added me from this cv short for chinese vancouver site, which i have never even heard of before that day.  went onto the site, cuz well, if i haven't even heard of the site before let alone ever going there, how the hell could he have added me from there? but i was also talking to some other friends at the time, so i looked thru that cv site really slowly.. and finally realized after like 2 hrs, that some person had stolen my identity and was posing as me on there, using my name & icq, posting up a msg about a virgin looking for a sugar daddy.  had to say i was REALLY shocked when i came onto the pages, both the msgboard page and the person's membership profile page, cuz i instantly realized that someone was trying to pose as me on there. was soo shocked that i blanked out for a min there, cuz i seriously couldn't even think of the person who would do this to me. it wasn't until after i calmed down a bit and looked carefully at my icq list several times, that i came up with a possible suspect. i don't give out icq easily, that's why i have authorization, and well lately, i'm mostly using msn so not a lot of new friends know about my icq. so it must be someone who's on my list and also has me on the list for a while now. plus, i'm not the kind of person who'd make enemies easily or even just get into arguments/disagreements often with ppl, so it really took me a while to try figuring out the person.  it was a she, contrary to what most ppl think would be a guy to post that kind of msg. i really didn't wanna suspect her at first cuz well, she is whom i consider to be a close friend. but we just had sort of an uncomfortable conversation on msn lately, and she's the only one in a long time whom i've had that kind of uncomfortable talks with. so if it weren't her, i couldn't think of anyone else.  i signed up a fake email account as a guy and sent that person an email, hoping to get clues as to who that person would be. and i did get the clue i want. the person replied saying i could add her on msn, and the msn account she gave out, was really my msn account. i use ISP email account with msn, unlike most ppl who use hotmail. so if the person knows my real email address, it really has to be someone i know well. and it really was the person i had in my mind, the one i suspected all along.  i'm like 90% confident of her identity. cuz not a lot of ppl know both my icq & msn accounts. some ppl only have icq, some only have msn. there are only a few ppl who have me on both, and weeding out the ones who're in taiwan and the ones i know who are busy with work and would never go to sites like cv, she was the only one left. and i remembered few weeks ago she was telling me about this site that lets you network with friends' friends and stuff. i asked ppl around and realized later on that it's friendster. and i looked thru that cv site, and apparently most ppl on there, also have frienster too. so she does go on sites like this. it really was her.  even tho i had suspected that it was her, i really didn't believe it until i got that email she replied. i was feeling really betrayed, cuz she was someone i consider to be one of my close friends. yet she backstabbed me like this. it was clear that it wasn't just a sick joke tho, she was really trying to trash me and hurt my reputation. i was really confused as to why she'd do something like this, then i vaguely remembered the uncomfortable chat we had not long ago on msn.  something about i put up a msn nickname that she thought was meant for her, and she got really angry. it was apparently about the bday present she got for me. i already told her that it had nothing to do with her, it was just something i thought of after hearing these incidents with some other friends cuz well lately there's been quite a few bdays and ppl have been all getting bday presents. i thought we had an understanding after the chat and everything was cool. but apparently it wasn't.  after giving some more thoughts, i then realized she must have misunderstood my nickname again, and that must be why she got angry yet again and decided to go trash me on that site. see, i put up this msn nickname calling myself an ungrateful spoiled brat. but that's what my stupid father has been calling me for yrs!!! so it was really targeted to him!  i couldn't understand why the hell she'd think all these nicknames were directed to her. it wasn't like i put up the nicknames with her name splashing all across them. so why the hell would she immediately think they're meant for her anywayz? whenever i see a friend's nickname that's vague and i couldn't really understand, i'd just go ask them what's up with the new nick! how can you be fucking sure unless you ask someone directly anywayz??? but you know what, now the more i think about it, i think she's just feeling guilty and afraid of being found out, like 心虛 or something. otherwise why'd she instantly relate to my nicknames like that?!?? oh and besides, i totally have the rights to put up a nickname in the way i like it whenever i want! it's not like i have to run it by you first and be like "hey, is it ok if i put up a nickname like this? you won't feel like this is targeted to you and be offended would you?!?!??" JEEEEEEEEZ.  but you know what, i don't FUCKING care why the hell she did all this anymore. cuz if she's the kind of person who'd do something as low class as this, i'm actually kinda glad i found this out now instead of like another 5 yrs down the road. i was sooo mad when i got the email back from her proving she's the one, that i too, had thought about going around trashing her name on public websites. but no, i'm just not that kinda person. i will never stoop to such a low level like she did.  if anything, i'd take formal legal actions against her. and believe me, i would totally have a winning case. it's kinda ironic tho, that with my father's background and everything my family's closely linked to the legal world and has known quite a few lawyers and legal politicians both here and taiwan. i have personal friends too now in law school studying here and in taiwan as well. i asked them about this kind of situation, and they confirmed my thoughts that yes, i could totally sue her for stuff like this, cuz she was going around posing as me telling untruthful info about me! i can sue for damages!  i had actually wanted to go to the police and really wanted to sue. but you know, rite now, i just don't ever wanna see or talk to her again. she's not worthy of my time speaking to her and whatnot. some other guy said so too, that if the same thing happened to him, he would't confront the person as well, cuz it's no use, they'll just deny the whole shit. but it's not like i'm afraid to confront her or anything, i actually really want to confront her, cuz i do have the proof i need to sue her, i could get the IP address and stuff that prove she's the one, but i'll let her off easily this time. just let the whole thing go. however, if she ever pulls something like this again, believe me, i'll fucking sue her for all she's worth! hah and i guess that litigious genes really are in me all along. no wonder law courses are the ones i had the most fun in in ubc commerce.  as for that msg she posted, virgin looking for sugar daddy. so what if i'm a virgin? i'm proud to be one. most of my galpals are virgins too. even she's a virgin, yet she sounded as if being a virgin is something to be ashamed of, and it's totally not! even a hot gal like jessica simpson waited till she married nick lachey. and it's not that i'm opposed to premarital sex or anything. once i found the special guy, i'll just do it like i'm making up for all the lost times, my other virgin galpals said so too. so there really isn't anything wrong with being a virgin. the sugar daddy part is complete bullshit tho. why the hell would i need a sugar daddy when my real father is my sugar daddy? i don't really need some other stupid guy to provide me with money, i have my real father to suck the wealth from already.  and i dunno what made her think that i'd be interested in sugar daddy, cuz apparently from that msg she posted she thinks i'm a gold digger or just materialistic. hah, why'd i have to spend all the time and energy to go find some guy to dig the gold from, when i'm already too exhausted digging gold from my stupid father. so what if i have some dior/coach/fendi bags and gucci/dkny watches. so yes, i have some, but it's not like i own TONS of brand stuff. as for me loving the reality show 'the apprentice' and its theme song 'for the love of money', so i just like the song, big deal. and millions of ppl in the world watch the show and love it, so there's nothing wrong. hell, we even watched the finale together, i thought she'd know something. but well, if she judges from the fact that since i own those brand things and i love that show/song then i'd be a material girl, well, i don't really care anywayz. life's already hard enough that i don't need to think what everyone else thinks of me.  all these yrs i've known her, i had thought of her as a nice person. it's amazing how after a drastic incident that you just see the person in a totally new light. now that i think back of all the times we shared, even tho i was happy at the time with her and we did have quite some fun in these yrs, i actually feel disgusted knowing a person who'd do this. and i guess those sayings 知人知面不知心 and 日久見人心 are true. it's quite hard to believe that someone like her, who's even 2 yrs older than me, exactly 25 in her mid-20s, would go around doing something as immature and childish as this. in fact, i really pity her. and it's actually kinda ironic, that with her being a libra, she's supposed to be someone who's peace-loving and everything! guess that's fucking wrong!!! oh i also find it funny that she blocked me off from msn ever since this whole thing happened. i haven't seen her online at all, and she's the kind who comes online pretty often, so the only explanation is that she blocked me. on icq, in her info, she claimed that someone's hacked into her account... YAH RITE... duh... just trying to make up excuses for being off. it's kinda sad actually to see that she did something like this, yet didn't have the guts to stand up and admit the whole thing, and instead just went to hide and be like a chicken!  i'm not gonna put her name on here, saying out who she is, cuz i have class and i won't stoop to such low levels. and i haven't really decided yet whether or not i'll publish this whole blog to my friends. yes, so far, no one knows about this blog, but well it's pretty new anywayz. my thoughts change pretty often, one day i'd think i'll let my friends know, the next day i'll decide not to. so i dunno yet. if i do decide to publish this, i don't really care how they judge me from all the private personal posts either. but well, that's that.  it's funny too actually, that most ppl on that cv site don't really know what sugar daddy means, so only 5 ppl have tried to add me on icq. i don't add strangers on icq/msn anywayz so if she thought she could somehow mess my life up by doing something like this, then well, she failed! this whole thing actually didn't bother me that much. so i was a bit preoccupied with this shit for a day or two, but it's not that important as the other thing that's gonna consume my mind later.  saw the korean drama 'red bean girl'.. hah, suddenly i felt like i'm that red bean girl, 莫名其妙地就被土豆女擺了一道... anywayz, now, after i've come blogged this down to keep it in record, i can say with confidence that this whole shit will be put behind me. i won't ever think of this again, and of course, i will never consider her as a 'friend' anymore. now, to me, she's just a stranger. and actually, i'm quite glad she's out of my life now. who'd need someone like her in their lives anywayz to be later backstabbed in! hah, so BYE! YAY! i'm actually lucky to have gotten rid of you! and as i said, i may lose a friend here, but i'll gain another one elsewhere too!

(>__   urlLink    Chanel Pink Camelia Watch   while i'm at it i might as well say i want that watch! love chanel camelia watch series~ so feminine looking~ and this one being pink, is just oh so gorgeous!!!    urlLink    Dior "Fiancee du Vampire" Fine Jewelry Collection   man ever since i saw that dior diablotin ring (the rite one with the red heart and the devil tail) in japan i'm now addicted to haute couture fine jewelry. that one costs like USD $6000?! (X__X);; so i can imagine the chanel venise ring must be around that price as well. camelia watch must be like at least double the price cuz that line of watch is always over-the-top expensive...  i should really be glad that there's no dior boutique here in van. or else i'm gonna be left with no money! cuz seriously, USD $6000 for a ring like that, i may seriously consider it! so it may cost like 3-6 months of salary, but i'd really save up that money to go buy it! i think it'll really be worth it! tho i'm sure my mom'd kill me... haha. but blah, i have a weird values system anywayz.  tho too bad that chanel venise collection is all limited edition. so i'm sure it's gonna be all sold out by the time i save up money to afford luxury like that. and i still don't even know when i'd be able to save up that kinda money. just hope the dior diablotin ring will still be around by then.. in the mean time, i just keep dream dream dream dreaming on~~~ haha.. me pathetic (^O^);;

      started the day quite japanesque i must say. eating japanese-style cod roe spaghetti while watching pop japan tv. never figure out when that program's on. the only one time i've ever seen it was already like couple months back, and it was a special on x japan. today the feature artist is laruku. DOH! how come i never get to see GLAY?!?!? was talking about how laruku finally got together again last yr, did the 7-day concerts last summer, then released their long-awaited album this yr. but hey, GLAY! it's their 10th anniversary man! and they released a new album this yr too! and they're doing expo again at the end of this month! they totally deserve more attention~~~ hah or i'm just being selfish (^O^);;  had interview at 2.30pm. hmm went ok i guess, nothing much too special to worth mention about. OH! except that after i left i was outside cleaning up my bag and stuff, and this middle-aged lady went in the door. she had her keys in her hand, and hah! it's playboy keychain!!! (^O^) was suddenly really excited seeing that, cuz i felt so happy seeing someone else also owning playboy stuff~ hehe! have playboy keychain, wallet, cap, tshirt.. and really should've bought some more! man i should change my name to playboy freak (tho that may generate weird thoughts in guys.. ^O^;;) anywayz, went to kerrisdale afterwards to eat and send off yet another thank-u card. is actually the last one, i've used up the whole pack. so from now on i'll just send emails, hah. hmm then went to london drugs to buy stuff. discovered the lancome new nail polish. and was of course again tempted by the extreme pink loveliness and ended up buying it...  had originally really wanted to go out with friends to dine again or something. but then decided not to cuz i wanna do my manicure! really want to have it done before tomorrow cuz i have a makeover session in the morning and then there's a gathering. want to have my pretty nails done~~ haha crazy me (^O^) was planning on to do french manicure, but then i tried my newly bought lancome polish. it's actually quite a great polish! sooo pink and glittery!!! and has this sweet raspberry scent~ lovely! actually i like this smell more than that rosey smell of anna sui. this really was quite a great buy. $15. compared to that dior addict nail polish i got last month. that pink is soo soft so i don't really like it. and it's like $25?! man, i really shouldn't be that head over heels for dior.. it's blinding me, really... (^O^);;  and i'm once again addicted to blogging, after 3 yrs. that time i was in love channel blogging in chinese. ended that one within 1 yr. not sure how long i'll continue with this one, tho these days i'm lovin' it! maybe cuz it's sooo pink? haha! that must be it! i really like the whole look of this template~ so the pinkiness is driving me to blog! *crazy* oh! and i finally figured out today how to play around with those html codes to put on music and additional lists! (^O^) something still doesn't look quite rite tho, and i'm still trying to figure it out. it's actually driving me crazy, goddamn html codes! i've looked around on sooo many other sites for their html sources. i did everything like the others are doing. yet it still appears weird on my page!!! WHY~~~??? (>____  anywayz decided to put up velvet revolver's slither first. absolutely love the song these days. whenever i hear it on radio i'd blast it out loud~ love the video too. god that lead singer looks sooo sexy! topless + low-waist shiny gold tight pants!!! the first time i saw the video my eyes were just totally glued to the screen!!! (*O*) he looks quite visual tho.. can't believe i'm finding that kinda guy sexy these days, but heh i'm always weird. but well, really love the rhythm and beats. the strong drums sound. and of course, that singer's not only got a nice package, but also great sexy voice too!!! (^O^)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   [Slither] by Velvet Revolver   When you look you see right through me Cut the rope I fell to my knees Born and broken every single time  Always keep me under finger That's the spot where you run to me  Might see some type of pleasure in my mind  Yeah, here comes the water It comes to wash away the sins of you and I This time you see   When you seek me you'll destroy me Rape my mind and smell the poppies Born and bloodied every single time   Yeah, here comes the water It comes to wash away the sins of you and I This time you see Like holy water It only burns you faster than you'll ever dry This time with me  When you look you see right through me Cut the rope I fell to my knees Born and bloodied every single time

      got email from flora this morning. totally made my day. and brought back all the sweet innocent memories in elementary. she said the guy i used to like, 517, is quite a hunk now. wow, am i glad to hear that!!! (^O^) cuz there was this rumor going around saying how after elementary the guy got fat and ugly and started wearing glasses (^O^);;; was quite disappointed actually when i first heard that. couldn't really believe that saying "one may look nice when they're young, but not so anymore once they grow up" is true, cuz the guy was sooo adorable in elementary and was not just the most popular guy in our class, but in the whole grade as tons of girls in the other classes liked him too. i know it's weird, but somehow i just feel happy knowing he's nice looking, knowing that someone as cute as before grew up to be cute as well.  but i guess the thing i want the most is to be able to meet the guy again, see how he looks now and get to know him again. i miss him, to tell the truth. i know it's quite unbelievable, that i still think about him 10 yrs after elementary. but well, maybe i've started to think more about him these days again cuz i'm watching this korean drama 'red bean girl' and in the plot, the girl got re-acquainted with her elementary crush and it's actually quite a sweet drama. but anywayz, the guy will always hold a special place in my heart no matter what. hope the same goes for him too, cuz i was the one who gave him his nickname as 517. seeing how he's still using it now, i really hope he'd remember it was me who started calling him that. oh, i wonder......

      aah and speaking of linkin park, i had really wanted to go to evanescence's concert here in van tonite!!! tho when the tickets first went on sale, cuz i didn't wanna buy it online anymore this time, i was planning on to buy it from ticketmaster outlet directly. yet by the time i had the time/chance to go there, floor seats all sold out!!! ~~(>__  actually a terrible thing happened today. logged in to my first ever hotmail account that i signed up for 6 yrs ago, and discovered that i haven't logged in there over a month and so everything's erased and i had to re-activate it. (>_____  have to really blame myself for this tho. being too busy and all that so i really just forgot about the whole thing. yet to tell the truth, when i realized at first that i had to re-activate the account and everything was gone, i wasn't feeling anything. and that's actually a good thing. maybe all along i've been wanting to get rid of those but i just didn't have the heart for it. now that they're all gone i won't have all the memories linger in my mind and trap me in that place anymore. see, my hopes fade away bit by bit every yr ever since 2000. summer 2001, no replies from u when i was there, i gave up. summer 2002, so much personal family issues happened at the time that made me realize you really aren't the most important thing in my life. by 2003, even tho i was there the whole time and i could go digging for the truth, once and for all, i didn't. that winter, discovered the biggest shock and realized she wasn't who she said she was all along. that was the final trigger, and i kept telling myself the whole thing's just a stupid mistake and it should be all over. and now, finally, by summer 2004, the last traces of all you two have been erased from my life. i really should be glad, shouldn't i?  all these yrs, the only reason i kept that account activated was to save those emails there, hoping that few yrs later, when i think of this whole thing, i'd still have a place to turn to, for memory. tho i was just fooling myself. all this time i could've gone back to re-live our times shared together in those emails, i never once did that. kept saying i had no time.. but well.. maybe that's just an obvious excuse i used. but seriously, ever since the end of last yr when i came upon that big shock, i've been telling myself to end this whole thing and just move on. have to say it's quite a success. i don't really think about that time anymore. and now with those old emails forever gone, i can safely say, i've put an end to that past, and is ever so ready, for a new beginning.  but still, thanx for the sweet times shared, even tho i was a big fool all along..  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Music:  [Everybody's Fool] Evanescence   perfect by nature icons of self indulgence just what we all need more lies about a world that never was and never will be have you no shame don't you see me you know you've got everybody fooled  look here he comes now bow down and stare in wonder oh how we love you no flaws when you're pretending but now i know he never was and never will be you don't know how you've betrayed me and somehow you've got everybody fooled  i know the truth now i know who you are and i don't love you anymore  it never was and never will be you don't know how you've betrayed me and somehow you've got everybody fooled  it never was and never will be you're not real and you can't save me somehow now you're everybody's fool

      it's funny how i've been going to downtown for 3 days in a row. monday for interview, tuesday for cupcakes, and today went to drop off thank-u cards. normally i send in thank-u cards after interviews, but since they told me they'd make a decision sometime this week, and it takes 2 days for the cards to get there, i wasn't sure if they'll get there in time before they make a decision, so i just sent in thank-u emails yesterday morning. but then last nite when i went to bed i kept thinking.. since this is a company i'd really like to work for, i really should try harder. so i decided to just go into the office to drop them off at front desk.  yet when i went in, there's absolutely no one there at the front desk.. where's their receptionist?!? (@_@);; waited for a little while and finally somone passed by and came out to greet me. asked her to please pass the cards on, and she was like "oh~ i didn't get one too?" quite funny and weird actually, cuz why'd i write her a card when i don't even know who she is?! and the shocking thing is she knew me!!! (*O*) she's like "ur jennifer rite?" and i was soooo majorly shocked. i asked her how she knew me and she said she saw me walking in the office the other day. but wow.. she only just saw me and then she went to find out my name?! (*O*) have to say i was quite surprised and happy~ quite excited too actually. i left the office smiling all the way~~~ it totally just made my day!! hahaha (^O^)/ really hope something like that would boost my chance of working there or something!  when i arrived at downtown it was already pass 3pm and i couldn't park at the roads anymore. so i had to park at this parkade that charges minimum 30min for $3 (>_   urlLink    new Prada pink heart-shaped keychain   urlLink    new Prada pink logo keychain  then went to kerrisdale to drop off sheets for dryclean and to send out mails. parents called last nite saying they gonna send money over for me to 'practice' investment stuff. whatever. but then mom asked me to go find out the current interest rates and stuff. and these guys kept asking me how i'm doing with the td bank cutie ever since i asked them for advice last time. it's funny, really, that i'm not even worried but they're all more worried than me! (^O^);; so well i decided to go to td bank. but the guy wasn't there! argh. i went 2 weeks ago around the same time, and he was there! yet today he wasn't! can't say i'm all that disappointed, maybe just a little bit really. i haven't thought of him lately cuz i've been so busy and stuff. but well.. i had really wanted to put what the guys taught me to use today yet it was all a waste. well, next time, next time..  the teller i got today, he's taiwanese too, i can tell by his last name. tho he's probably born here cuz he doesn't look so twnese. he's really funny and nice actually, sorta cute too. he kept smiling and stuff. made me think of the td bank cutie and he rarely smiles! he seems like the quiet shy type of guy so that's why it'd make me extra nervous talking to him. yet the guy today, no problem talking to him cuz he's so open and stuff. he asked me 'hey have i served u before?'.. and i was like, yah i think so. hmm.. really wasn't sure why he asked that. cuz according to what the guys taught me that could be a start-up line for conversations and stuff... it's interesting tho, but well, dunno, dunno..  went to downtown so late cuz i got a phone call from this securities company. had the phone interview at 1pm, and it's actually with 2 ppl. the girl didn't talk at all for the first 5 min and when she suddenly spoke, shocked the hell outta me... then i realized it's like a 3-way calling. were asked these 2 super interesting questions. "what are ur 2 fave animals and why". was soo surprised they asked that and i had to answer back in a timely fashion, so i ended up saying panda and cats... (^O^);; then, "who do u admire the most in the entertainment industry and why". i ended up saying linkin park... (^O^);; very interesting questions. now me gonna try asking these to other ppl and see what kinda answers i get!

       urlLink     the other day with shannon, she told me there's this little shop that sells only cupcakes and it's really good. we actually drove pass the place and so i saw it's a totally cute pink little shop! so cute! so pink! lovely~~ it's been on my mind ever since and well so these days i'm feeling a bit low i've been wanting to eat stuff.. healing food healing food~  was bored this afternoon so came online to search around, and really, i found that little shop's website! they have pix of all their cupcakes and a brief description.. and i was looking at all those yummy cupcakes and seriously, i was practically drooling~~~!!! was even telling ppl at the time in IM that i may be going down there just to buy cupcakes out of my boredom and tiredness... and guess what, i really did!!! *CRAZY*  so i drove all the way down to denman, only to buy cupcakes... LOL~ thought i might as well just buy 12 cupcakes to get the special price of $22. ended up buying 6 different flavours, 2 each to make it 12. they have a lot more flavours, but those are all super chocolatey, and i don't really like choco that much, so i didn't get any of those choco ones. 12 cupcakes, ended up only eating 3 for dinner. was actually quite full already after just 3 cupcakes. but wow, now it looks like it'll take me another 3 meals to finish all those cupcakes... guess i bought way too much out of my excitement (^O^);;  it's weird too huh.. that i ate cupcakes for dinner. told my parents that and they were like "what?!???" (^O^);; this made me remember this incident in tokyo last yr. saw in the GLAY Happy Swing fan club newsletter that there's this dessert shop called "patisserie TERU" and they have fabulous pudding, cakes, cream puffs etc. esp their pudding, it's actually called "TERU's pudding" (LOL) and they'd put a sticker on each pudding that said "TERU"~ XD well, and so being TERU love, i decided to go down to the shop one day. it's really crazy actually, cuz the place was really far in the suburban area considering i lived in tokyo metropolitan region. but i really couldn't resist the charisma of a shop called "TERU" and those desserts that i spent 1 1/2 hr just to go down there. of course, took 3 hrs back and forth, totally exhausted. ended up buying tons of cakes plus their famous pudding and cream puffs back. was eating those for dinner too. and at the time i was online as well, told my friends that, and totally surprised them... hahaha  anywayz, this cutie little pink store's cupcakes *are* really good!!! maybe it's cuz they're so pink too that i love them so much now?! and of course, i love all kinda cakes~~ heehee! (^O^)/

      *SIGH* i'm not in that much of a good mood today.  got turned down by that boutique investment banking firm which i thought i may have a big chance at cuz i was one of the final two candidates! SO CLOSE! AH! DAMN! i asked for their feedback and stuff as i really wanted to know why they didn't choose me instead. got the reply saying that i clearly am an ambitious and capable person but rite now they decided to go with someone with a bit more experience. but what's a recent univ grad supposed to do anywayz? i've had all the summer jobs too, what more experience can you expect from a new grad?!? i mean, they are obviously impressed with my background & experience, yet they still said they needed someone a bit more...  tho actually i think they just want a white person. that company, since it's boutique, is fairly small consisting no more than 20 ppl, and they are all white. i've had interviews with companies that small too but they have asian ppl and so it's not all white. to tell the truth the first time i saw the company website i was a bit surprised to see it's all white. and i remembered when i went in at the beginning of last month the person who was formerly in the position that i applied for was white too. it's just a totally white company. so i really wouldn't be that surprised if i got turned down at the very end cuz of that reason.  it's ok actually, cuz seriously, i wouldn't wanna go into a company that's all white. it'd be good if it's got at least 1 or 2 non-white ppl. but not all white. and today i definitely got to see what a diversed workplace feels like for an interview at this global logistics firm. company culture does play a big part in businesses. since this is a huge global company having branches all over the world, it just makes sense that their employees come from all kinds of different backgrounds.  when i went in for the interview i had to stay at the front desk to fill out this application form. and while i was doing so, there were ppl coming in and out casually chatting and stuff. saw this white guy discussing issues regarding the chinese language with a chinese lady, and you can just tell that he's obviously interested in the topic. i saw ppl in the office too, lots of asian ppl, not just chinese but also japanese too and etc. even their receptionist is either from europe or latin america or something cuz she said english isn't her first language and she can't even speak it well enough! which actually surprised me a lot seeing afterall she's the front desk person!! man... if someone with her english could do that job, i could totally do it as well!!! no offense to her or anything, she's actually quite nice... but still... i just felt a bit unfair. but well, the whole time i was there, i could just tell that the atmosphere was really open and friendly, and it felt really good.  well, hope there's good news from this company. actually had interview with 2 ppl. plus the time filling out the application, it took me 1 full hr there! totally didn't expect it to be like that and i drove there today, so i was really afraid my car would be towed or something cuz i only put in for 30min.. (^-^);; came home and got another call for an interview on friday. it's quite interesting. had an interview with this real estate development firm whose current project is to be van's tallest bldg located on georgia. the call i received today is for this marketing company that promotes for developers, and it's actually promoting that shangri-la bldg rite now! so they're partners! ha! oh and funny thing about this marketing firm, the owner's a white guy, yet most of the employees there are asians! only 2 other white ppl! now *that's* interesting!  oh yah, that boutique investment banking firm that i came to very close. they're quite rude actually in that they didn't even inform me of their decision! if i hadn't wrote in today to ask, would they just never tell me?!? i mean, it's one thing you don't respond to every person who applies for the job, cuz i can understand that, you must have had tons of applications so you wouldn't have the time to respond. but if i've had interviews with you, and i am one of the final candidates, it's just a common courtesy to at least tell ppl of your choice! so yah, that wasn't nice.  anywayz was a bit moody today so had the urge to eat.. really wasn't planning on to eat more for dinner this week, but aah i wasn't feeling well so i gave in. went to bbt cafe for dinner, healing food~~ *SIGH* well that concludes another day. gonna tuck in now...

Here is how you matched up against all the levels:  Purgatory (Repenting Believers)   Very Low   Level 1 - Limbo (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Very Low   Level 2 (Lustful)   Very High   Level 3 (Gluttonous)   Very High   Level 4 (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Very High   Level 5 (Wrathful and Gloomy)   Low   Level 6 - The City of Dis (Heretics)   Extreme   Level 7 (Violent)   High   Level 8- the Malebolge (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   High   Level 9 - Cocytus (Treacherous)   High     Take the  urlLink Dante's Inferno Hell Test     LOL~ amusing test! so i scored either high or very high for most levels of hell (^O^);; except for the one being wrathful/gloomy cuz yah i don't really feel depressed often or wanna kill myself or anything. and i find it interesting that just cuz i fail to believe in god and the afterlife that i'm a heretic?! so everyone who believes in a religion other than christianity / catholicism / judaism would be a heretic?!? that's just total bs! other than these, seeing how i scored 'very high' on lustful, gluttonous, and prodigal and avaricious, i guess the test is somewhat quite truthful since i really am a horny and greedy person who loves sex, fine food, and money! that's a true taurus! but anywayz, so yah, i'm a devil worshipper and i'm glad to be one! there! i said it! what what? HAH! so what if i love the fallen angel lucifer! i've always been fascinated by the story! and yah, i guess i'd rather be a sinner than a saint all along.. hehe~

      待ち焦がれていた季節がやって来て ざわめきだす風　動き出す街並  いつもより朝の訪れが早くて それだけでうまく歩けるような そんな気がして  胸を痛める話ばかりが この頃じゃ溢れてるけど 悲しみの為に楽しむ事 置き去りにしないでいて  短い夏が始まって行く 君といくつの思い出つくろう 太陽はただ光輝き 波はいつも寄せては返してく    焦急等待的季節終於來到 開始騷動的風 開始活動的街道  早晨到訪得比平常還要早 光只是這樣就令我感覺到 步伐似乎能夠走得更輕快  雖有太多令人心痛的事 充塞在最近這段時間裡 但可不要為了傷心難過 而忘了如何去享受快樂  短暫的夏天即將開始 一起來創造許多回憶 陽光只是盡情在閃耀 海浪不斷潮來又潮往

      so we're half way thru the yr 2004. guess now's a good time to do some reflections on the past 6 months. am flipping thru my agenda to see what i've done so far......  have to say that for the first 3 months i've done absolutely nothing of significance. i wasn't even doing any job hunting at the time either even tho when asked by others i'd say i was, but really no i wasn't. so why wasn't i doing anything? maybe it had something to do with the fact that i had lived by myself last yr in japan so i really wanted to cherish the time i could be with my mom. that's why when i got back here in van this yr and knowing that mom would be going back to taiwan in march i just wanted to spend most of the time with her.  living by yourself does have its perks, i mean you get to stay out as late as you want without someone nagging at you. yet on the other hand it's good to have someone nagging at you too living together with a parent. so far, i've found out that being apart with mom actually makes our relationship better. whenever we talk on the phone it's just clear that we miss each other and stuff having to spend a long time saying goodbye and hanging up the phone. and once we get together again after being apart, we would just be so happy that we wouldn't fight. not that we get into fights or arguments a lot or anything, but of course you've had those sorts of things once in a long while~ yet now i think this whole experience just made us move pass that, so it's all good.  i also find this rather amusing actually, that my mom would buy me expensive stuff after being away from me. last yr after the first time i've lived on my own she agreed to let me buy the dior messenger bag (even tho it's using sugar daddy's money). and last month when she came back to van, she totally surprised me by giving me this pair of diamond earrings. she said they'd look great once i go work, since by then i'd need some nice professional stuff so i'd look mature and all that. but i mean, it's really funny cuz i haven't even found a job yet! but of course, i was more than happy to receive the gifts (^O^)  the 2nd quarter was really productive cuz i started to be really engaged in my job hunting. i've had a total of 19 interviews within this 3-month period. apparently that's like a lot within that timeframe cuz ppl got misled by the numbers of interviews i've been getting, saying that it seems like van is a city full of opportunities and it may be easy to find a job here. i'm like, no no that's totally not the case! (^-^);;  i guess the reason the 2nd quarter was soo productive was that spring/summer had come so the weather was really nice and everything that it made me just wanna get out more. i went out with friends every week either catching a flick or just casually dining out. for the last couple of months i've been watching an average of 2 movies per month. don't think that's like a lot tho. but well, it's really funny too that i've already watched 2 movies within the first 3 days for the month of july~ guess i've watched my share of films this month! haha (^-^);; well it may be really so anywayz cuz it doesn't seem like there's any more new movies that i'd like to watch for the rest of the month..   anywayz, that concludes what i've done so far in the first half of this yr. my agenda shows that the first quarter was like mostly blank while the 2nd quarter was so full. now looking onwards to the latter half of the yr, just hoping it'll end up as productive as this past quarter, and that the agenda be written so fully too! (^O^)/ all in all, even tho the yr started off a bit slow for me seeing i've done nothing much for the first quarter, have to say it's got better, and i'm sure it'll definitely be better still ahead!!!

      hanged out with shannon today, haven't got together with her in a month! took her to my fave place to chill these days at "chicco dall oriente cafe" in downtown. absolutely love everything there. tried their anmitsu today. can't resist the combination of green tea ice cream + red bean paste + rice ball (shiratama) oishii--! (^O^)  urlLink    クリームあんみつ  also shared the green tea strawberry cake with shannon~ yummy cake~ again, just can't turn down anything green tea!!! maybe i should change my nick to maccha freak?! LOL~~ but still, after having tried out everything in that lovely cafe, i have to say the absolute best thing there is the green tea parfait!   urlLink    抹茶ストロベリーケーキ  after dessert, went to watch spidey~ didn't watch the first film cuz well, i didn't like spiderman.. he's not as attractive/sexy as batman or superman. and well, tobey maguire isn't cute either. so i really didn't have the desire to watch the first film even tho it was such a huge blockbuster. tho this second one i've been fascinated with the storyline watching the trailers and stuff, so i had really wanted to see it! and it really is a pretty good film! so funny and everything~ let's see, maybe i just love that phrase "even tho sometimes we have to give up the thing we want the most in order to get what we want..." so much that it made me wanna go see the film?! haha.. but well, story's definitely getting interesting! now i can't wait to see the third film in 2007 where harry turns evil~~ wicked!!! now *that* guy, james franco, is cute! haha~  went to "jang mo jib" korean cuisine for dinner. totally packed considering after all this was a saturday night! really yummy food~ was sooo full and we couldn't even finish all we had ordered! am still very full now 5+ hrs after the dinner. been eating too much for dinners this past two days i'll have to cut down on dinner the rest of the week! eat too much for dinner is not good! can't sleep well either! aah! but well can't resist the yum food! yay! haha~~  all in all, a pretty fun day! it's always great catching up with old friends and stuff (^O^) and saw shannon's new puppy coffee~~~ such a damn cute little thing!!! absolutely love it! tho i still wouldn't wanna raise a pet on my own having to take care of its shit and all.. (^-^);; but well, that's that! now off to dreamland! whee~~!!!

      blah blah blah. went to the gathering. aaaargh i'm never gonna go to their bible studies ever again!!! auntie wu said before oh it's gonna be like informal chit-chat, it's not gonna be so seriously focused on bible and stuff, yet it still was!!! (>____ &nbsp;  the only interesting thing was that a cute guy came! woohoo! (^O^) he has nice arms.. haha.. and tall and kinda buff. ah he has nice voice too! and wow he has like the brightest smile i've ever seen! but we sat too far so didn't get into talking. hopefully he'll go to next week's bbq as well then i can get to meet him~ apparently there're gonna be other fellowships going to the bbq too so yay! hope&nbsp;i get to see more ppl! lalala~~~  &nbsp;  hmm it's always so hard for me to pick out clothes to wear to their gathering tho. can't wear these devil/skull tshirts.. well once i did and eric was like "what's that?" and i'm like "hmm.. the death" and he was shocked and went like "why would u wear that?" (^O^);;; it's funny actually that u can scare guys by telling them u like skull! hah! this weird guy somehow associated me liking the skull to me gonna kill myself!! what kinda logic is that??? jeeez. and then he changed into saying "oh skulls are cool~ i like them too~" but jeeez, u don't have to say that just to please me!!! duh...&nbsp;  can't wear these playboy tshirts either. and then these other super lovers tshirts with all the big heart logos, i feel those are kinda weird for the event too, and well i'm sure i'd get teased again for those slogans like "love is the message"... but hmm actually now that i think about it it may be suitable to wear that, them being all "jesus loves all~ god loves u no matter what~" and blah blah *LOL*  &nbsp;  anywayz so i ended up wearing today this super lovers tshirt with the slogan "rock'n roll disco" on it. during the discussion when it's my turn to share my thoughts, eric went like "ok~ now the rock'n roll girl~" haha so funny. i always find it fascinating how asian guys find it so hard to believe that girls would like rock music. remembered once at school before we went to this hk guy friend's home to do a project. he already knew i like rock but when i was looking thru his cd collection, he was like "red hot chilli peppers~ u like them?" i'm like, yah i know about them. and he went like "wow~ u *really* like rock!" (^O^);;  &nbsp;  and then another time we were supposed to do this test to get to know each team member better. u have to guess what the other's fave type of music is. no one guessed rock, so when i revealed the answer, all of them were sooo shocked!!! and the funniest thing was this cbc guy kept going like "WOW~" till even after the class!! he was like "what kinda rock u like? hmm name a band" i said OLP at the time and he was already *that* shocked. he would've acted double shocked then if i'd told him i like LP!!! *LOL*  &nbsp;  but then so yah, why'd asian guys find it soo shocking to know girls like rock? when i went to those LP concerts in japan half of the ppl there were girls! and they were these normal looking girls too, just the ones you'd see everyday on the streets~ some were even quite girly! the david usher shows here u'd see a lot of asian girls too! so what's the big deal anywayz? it's like a big mystery to me~  &nbsp;  and the funniest thing i've heard these days is that apparently i'm white! *LOL* just becuz i like rock music! sooo funny. thought it was very interesting too that guys would think like that. aah tho i dunno, these days i get mistaken a lot as either being cbc who doesn't know chinese or being japanese. i go to these chinese stores/restaurants, and ppl would just speak to me in english! and then was surprised when i started talking in chinese.. (*_*);;; i find it very weird too tho cuz usually when i'm with my mom then ppl could figure out from her that i'm chinese. they said they'd still have doubts and be unsure about it, but usually ppl could figure out more easily.  &nbsp;  it's really fascinating to me why ppl'd think i'm japanese. i dunno if that's supposed to be a good thing or a bad thing, to be mistaken as being another nationality. when i'm in taiwan ppl'd always think i'm japanese. i'd say no, i'm taiwanese. and they'd be like "really? oh mixed?" and i'd still be like no, both my parents are taiwanese! and then they'd go like "but ur chinese sounds kinda weird... ooh u live abroad don't u?" i was sooo shocked ppl think my chinese sounds weird! how can it be? i speak it like everyday! aaaah it's just so weird.  &nbsp;  and so when i was in japan ppl there would all think i'm japanese. and then they'd get sooo shocked i turn out to be a foreigner! *LOL* it actually feels quite nice to shock ppl like that~ really fun! hehe! somehow in van here these days i'd get mistaken as tourists too tho. go into shops to buy stuff and ppl would ask me "so, how u liking vancouver?" and it feels soo weird!! (*_*);;  &nbsp;  how could ppl tell the nationality from the looks anywayz? i can never guess ppl's nationality! at least for asians... quite confusing to distinguish between chinese, japanese, and korean. and then within chinese u'd still have to distinguish from taiwan, hk, and mainland! aaah! anywayz i dun really know what i'm blogging about now for this post... (^O^);;

      it just so happens that both the interviews today were at richmond. the 11am one was with this supposedly leading north american chemical distributor company (have absolutely no idea what kinda industry that is...) that i got from hunt personnel. they really suck. so hard to get set up by them these days. it's good i finally got another one set up tho, it's just that i'm quite pissed at them. but oh, the position is like this office assistant in the mailroom that only requires min 6-month office experience, so that's really really entry-level, yet the pay is like $28K! (*O*) the downtown ones i'm looking for these days only go up till like $25K and most don't go that high and yet they require like 1-2 yrs experience. so wow i was really surprised by the high pay! but yah for that kinda money i'd be willing to drive down to richmond to work! haha.. (^O^);;  &nbsp;  had lunch at earls with sami. yay~ (^-^) then went to buy cd-rw discs. i'm really not that tech-advanced. i used to just store stuff on floppy discs, then later on i put them all on hard drive. is actually the first time i'll be storing files on a cd-rw disc! (^O^);; flora emailed back saying her pc got virus before and all the reunion pix got erased so she's asking me to send her mine copies. quite frankly i can't even remember now where the hell i'm keeping all the old pix tho? knew it's somewhere on the notebook, but i really need to re-organize all my digital photo albums. there're all these sticker photos i took in japan last yr that i've been wanting to scan ever since i got back! *LOL* it's already been like a freaking half yr and i still haven't scanned them just cuz i'm lazy like that. and well, i already threw the old stupid scanner into another room so now i really need to clean up my desk area to move it back just for scanning this one last time. after this i'm gonna throw it away for good. it's sooo old and slow and stupid... bleh~  &nbsp;  the other interview was at 2.30pm. this one's such a big contrast from the morning one just cuz this one's intern position and it's 4-month no pay. it's really ok tho, i don't care about the money that much anywayz, as long as i get to do something it's all good. the interview went well. the guy said he thinks i'd be much more suited for other positions tho cuz this one is for marketing. it's really interesting. first time i've heard something like that. "u'd be better fitted for managing and operating the business, rather than building up the business (sales/marketing)"... that's how he thought of me and my experience/background. i do appreciate ppl's feedbacks, cuz i seriously am quite confused haha. but well, seems like i won't get this position but he said he'll pass it on for the other one that'll open up later. at interviews, sometimes u can just tell if there's a good vibe or not ne? i could feel it was going nice today. and it's really nice of him to advise me on what i'd be better suited in doing. so yah, i hope he's like the panalpina lady who'll pass my resume on to other dept later~&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  went back to sami's place to change outfit. wasn't gonna wear the stupid suit while i go out to play! and it was sooo goddamn freaking hot today!!! and aaaaaah!!! after i changed and we came down to my car to drive, i realized my car key wasn't even in my pocket and noticed that it's been dangling outside the car door all along!!! i never even locked the goddamn car when i went up to sami's apartment!!! (O____O);;;;; was sooo shocked. and good thing my car was still there when i came down... thank god... *whew*  &nbsp;  decided to go watch the movie "before sunset" tho it's only showing at 5th avenue cinema. i really have to thank eric for telling me about this movie! cuz it's sooo good!!! (^O^) seriously, if he hadn't mentioned about it last weekend, i wouldn't have paid attention to the movie review anywayz when i was reading the weekend newspapers those days! i have to remember to thank him tomorrow when i see him~ haha~  &nbsp;  it's funny really, how i've been watching these romantic movies lately. it's messing up my mind somehow tho, being extra boy crazy (^O^);; but wow, this film and "the notebook" that i saw few weeks ago, are like the best love films i've seen in yrs!!! esp this one with all the sex jokes it's just hilarious!!! (^O^) ppl were all laughing their heads off!!! hahaha!!! too bad there's no actual sex scenes tho *LOL* but wow,&nbsp;now i really wanna go watch the first movie "before sunrise"~ (*O*) yah, the reason this movie stucked to my mind after eric&nbsp;talked about it was because he said it's some&nbsp;kinda 24-hr love story and this couple met but had to part ways very shortly and stuff. heheh. &nbsp;  fell in love with ethan hawke's character. but oh come on, there'd be no guy like that in reality who just as a one nite stand remembers and loves the girl so much it drove him into writing this novel about their one nite together!!! *sigh* movies really are a great way to escape reality huh... maybe that's why i love watching movies so much? hah.&nbsp;oh and i love&nbsp;how they're just walking around in&nbsp;the city and chatting. to me that's a great date! (^O^) so yah, it's&nbsp;really sweet watching them walk around and catch up for the entire film~ &nbsp;  drove back to richmond and went walking around in richmond centre. hah. went karaoke. i can't believe i haven't gone to karaoke in like almost 1 yr! (*_*);; and i can't even remember when's the last time i sang in van?!? been soo outta touch with the karaoke here i dun even know where's good to go sing now anymore. the beloved mike in metrotown closed down and i was sooo bummed. now where the hell am i supposed to go sing GLAY's songs while watching their videos?!?? (~>_ &nbsp;  came home just pass 11pm. and the most horrible thing happened. i put my key into the back door to unlock it, and realized it's not locked at all!!! and then i vaguely remembered i probably didn't even lock the back door when i went out this morning at like 10am!!! HOLY!!! (O________O);;;;;; so the whole day 12hrs i was out, it was just unlocked like that!!! GOD, was sooooo shocked i could be ditzy like that and i got quite scared what if ppl broke in, i went to check every single room and the basement... good thing everything's normal. WOW. am quite dumbfounded.  &nbsp;  can't really believe i'd be sooo freaking careless like that. let's see, first there's yesterday when i forgot to turn on the alarm clock. then earlier today when i forgot to lock the car. and now i realized my whole house wasn't even locked when i was out!!! i have to say, it must have something to do with last nite, the fact that i didn't get to sleep well. hmm said my mind was like spinning around in the morning. so yah, it's sooo bad. am gonna get major lectured at&nbsp;when i told mom this... (---___---);;; and hmm i probably will get sooo laughed at when i tell ppl. tho i'm sooo thankful that van's security's so well. or maybe i'm just lucky for today. jess lives 2 blocks down the street and said that their neighbour got broken into for like 3 times in broad daylight!!!   have to say that other than these ditzy episodes that i created myself stupidly, it was an absolutely wonderful day~ lalala~ got online at 12am and wow it's now 2am... stupid blogging. damn i write way too long. but sometimes i just can't help it. haha (^-^);; it's good tho, hopefully by sleeping late tonite since i was already sooo tired and everything i'll fall asleep faster and end up having a good sleep!!! hah!

      let's see. i've been having trouble falling asleep for the past week or so and last nite was the only nite so far i've had a great deep sleep. actually woke up at 7am. thought that's still early enough cuz i set the alarm clock to 7.30am, so i went back to sleep. thought it's perfectly ok cuz the clock would wake me up in half an hr. god was i wrong... next thing i know, i woke up and it's 8.30am!!! was sooo shocked and distinctively remembered the alarm didn't go off at all! then i realized vaguely that it's probably cuz i didn't set the goddamn clock last nite... (^O^);;;  &nbsp;  interview at 10.30 and i was supposed to leave at 9.30 for bus. i knew these days cuz the weather's so nice and everything the bus always takes extra long time passing thru kits beach. but i was sooo rushed i left later than i had intended. and holy.. there were tons of little kids going on field trips and stuff filling up the bus. i was sooo freaking relieved i arrived at the office like 3-5min just before the time.  &nbsp;  was hanging around at the front desk of rbc investments and i saw this colourful little sheet on it, and hah! it's an invitation! apparently that devil bldg park place is celebrating its 20th bday next wed!!! (^O^) that's so cute! haha! am planning on to drop by just to look around~ hehee~ oooh and there's this orca outside the bldg too. tho it's this weird eagle thing. now why would they put an eagle there?? a devil would be much more suitable!!! XD&nbsp; seriously! i'd love to see a devil orca!!! (^O^) tho i guess these rigid religious ppl wouldn't like seeing the devil figure when they're walking on the streets huh.. haha  &nbsp;  interview was ok. i suppose?! i thought the guy had sounded kinda mean on the phone the previous day but he turned out to be quite nice and was smiling and stuff. so that's good. the position is more like a telemarketing one and is only for the summer. tho i figure u know, since it's rbc, it's all good~ and he said he'd set up a script too! so that's great! anywayz have to wait till next mon to hear back.  &nbsp;  on the way back home on bus, there's another group of little kids going on field trip to the kits beach (@_@);;&nbsp; and god, the kids these days *are* really mean!!! 2 poor little girls threw up on the bus and these little guys were all going like "eeewwww she puked!!!" but seriously, what's the big deal anywayz? there were sooo many of u little noisy freaks on the bus and the air was so stuffy and everything even i felt like i'm running outta my breath (>___ &nbsp;  there's a cute guy with a guitar coming on the bus near kits beach tho. and immediately after he got on the hippie old dude sitting beside me started talking with the guitar guy. they got into chats about the guitar and rock music and stuff. very interesting. haha. the guitar guy has this dreadlock hair but still, kinda cute.. tho i dunno, even tho he looks young he has these terrible crow's feet around his eyes, is kinda freaky (O_O);;;  &nbsp;  came home to rest for a little while. ate lunch. went out for walks. this 3hr was actually my only resting time for the whole day. had interview at this real estate development firm in richmond at 3.30pm. and aaah it turned out to be.. well i don't really know&nbsp;how to comment on it. besides that little weird new mainland pharmaceutical company i had an interview with a short while ago, this was the only other one that i've interviewed with so far that i knew nothing about before the interview since i couldn't find any info cuz they are all new!  &nbsp;  went into the office. and waaa there were these 4 middle-aged twn men. was immediately quite surprised. the interview was weird too. they would speak to me in mandarin but asked for me to answer back in english. that's so weird! i mean i've had companies before who'd say mandarin to u and yah u reply that back to them! all still in same language! anywayz, it was pretty obvious anywayz that the 4 of them aren't good in english so they just want someone who knows english in the company. i don't like companies like that.. seems like they're just using u and stuff. i mean sure i'd love to utilize my linguistic abilities, but it's not like that.  &nbsp;  ended up staying in that office longer than i had anticipated cuz they gave me these tasks to perform. come up with a letter for late rent and do an excel spreadsheet. i was there for what, 40min?! and aaah, the whole time i was there doing the stuff, they'd just chat there and act like these typical twn middle-aged men saying stuff in taiwanese that kinda creeped me out. remembered i had a chat with sami few weeks ago and she was like she wouldn't like it as much being the only non-white person in the company, but she wouldn't mind&nbsp;being the only girl. i was thinking about that while i was at the office, and i was like hell... there'd be no way i'd wanna work in a company like this being with 4 middle-aged weird dudes... i may consider it if they are nice young guys tho. *LOL*  &nbsp;  anywayz because the interview went on way longer than i had expected,&nbsp;it messed up my schedules for the late afternoon.&nbsp;did remember to go to yaohan to grab tons of pocari sweat drinks, so that's good. had to&nbsp;go buy fruits too cuz i'm outta stuff to eat. and i noticed that the gas price at some stations already went up so i&nbsp;really wanted to fill it up&nbsp;while it's still cheap! ended up coming back at home at exactly 5.30pm&nbsp;which was also the time i was supposed to leave the house to go do aerobics!!! (>___ &nbsp;  aerobics was really good tho.&nbsp;hah.. even tho i felt like i'm about to faint any moment there being sooo hot from all the movements and the sweating.&nbsp;but it's all good. tho because i had absolutely no freaking time to rest at all for what, 4hrs straight, i was so extra goddamn tired. but i really wanna keep up the aerobics so i had planned to go do it again on fri morning too but&nbsp;i got callbacks for interviews tomorrow so i guess rite now i'll just keep aerobics to 2&nbsp;days a week.&nbsp;and see how it goes&nbsp;and if i can really keep this up.. hah.&nbsp;can get quite lazy at times. blah.  &nbsp;  had a&nbsp;short&nbsp;resting period reading the newspapers but i was also trying to call back auntie wu.&nbsp;she left a msg in the afternoon sounding so urgent and everything. yet i had been trying to call back for nearly 2 hrs and the line's busy! jeeez. when i finally called in ended up talking for&nbsp;longer than i expected. it's so weird.&nbsp;there's this girl i thought&nbsp;is eric's gf cuz they seem really close like a couple and stuff, yet eric denies it. i remembered few weeks ago at the gathering when we were all sitting together on the same couch and he started talking about him being single... it was getting weird why he&nbsp;kept&nbsp;stressing that point and finally the guy beside me asked him why he&nbsp;wanna get that point clear across. and somehow there was mentions about&nbsp;me and it's all weird and awkward. i still dunno what the whole thing's about (@_@)  &nbsp;  but well, so&nbsp;i was really curious how come the girl never comes to their gatherings, even for some fun events. and&nbsp;auntie&nbsp;started saying weird things&nbsp;like that's what she's concerned about.. having different faith and something about the girl wouldn't convert to christianity.&nbsp;i was&nbsp;like sooo shocked in my mind thinking wow, she&nbsp;wants her son to be with&nbsp;a christian (or at least someone willing to convert to that)?!?? (@__@);;; christian ppl can be soo up-tight sometimes it really freaks me out. i would never expect someone i be with to believe in the same things i believe in!!! everyone's entitled to&nbsp;their own freedom of&nbsp;beliefs!!! jeeeez. anywayz it was really stupid of me to have promised her few&nbsp;days ago that i'd be going to their bible study on&nbsp;sat nite.&nbsp;those are&nbsp;sooo freaking boring i hope i don't end up falling asleep again there this time. something about the theme this week being "be content about the things u already have,&nbsp;don't stress over those things u want"... man... and ur supposed to share ur thoughts on that. OH GOD. (---___---);;;&nbsp;i'm actually kinda amazed at myself. how come i can&nbsp;just say no&nbsp;to some ppl so easily&nbsp;at times and yet some other times it's so hard to say no...  &nbsp;  auntie wu wanted to meet vivian so i had to call her up to ask her if she wanna go to the&nbsp;gathering&nbsp;on sat. she&nbsp;doesn't wanna go.. hah i had guessed that already.&nbsp;if i hadn't promised auntie i'd go cuz i thought at the time it's held at her house and it's gonna be&nbsp;all casual and everything and plus she kept asking me (!!!), i would've thought of some smart excuse to turn her down!!! aaah!!! (>__ &nbsp;  then mom called. told her about all the things and of course it freaked&nbsp;her out i went to some 4 middle-aged men&nbsp;office all by myself. was&nbsp;lectured at... saying blah blah blah i have to be careful and stuff.&nbsp;parents actually&nbsp;accompany&nbsp;kids to interviews these days in twn&nbsp;u know... etc etc.&nbsp;oh come on, i didn't really think it'd be that much of a big deal... and i just didn't think of it that way at all! until ppl clued me in. i guess i really am still somewhat innocent/naive at times, even tho i'd like to believe i'm not&nbsp;like that at all anymore.  &nbsp;  it's really funny in a way, just the day i'm extra tired and busy i get all these phone calls. and ended up being on the phone for over 1hr.&nbsp;is almost 11pm. and yet i still haven't done my research on these 2 companies that i have interviews with tomorrow. was gonna try sleeping earlier today too like last nite at 12am. seems not possible for today tho. doh. oh well me do research now~~~ aaaaaaaaah what a busy day... tho it's nice to be busy sometimes~ it takes ur mind off things and it just feels good running around doing stuff~ (^O^) lalala~~~

      stayed at home today sending out applications and stuff. cuz i've been going out for two days in a roll that i haven't sent a single application out this week at all!!! am so bad (^-^);; let's see, sent out 9 applications today, got 3 callbacks! yay! the last time i went crazy and sent 10 resumes out in a single day i got 3 callbacks too. guess that's just the ratio huh.. 3 outta 9/10. haha. well so i've got 2 interviews tomorrow! and the funny thing is the morning one with rbc dominion securities is at that 666 evil bldg park place that sami and i were just talking about yesterday!!! hahaha!!! XD another funny thing about that one is the interviewer, his name is phil knight!!! isn't that the same name as the founder of nike?!? wow. but the guy doesn't sound that nice tho, not his voice but his way of talking. felt kinda mean or something i dunno. and he's got british accent?! hmm anywayz i have to do research later too after me finish blogging.  oh yah and i looked back at my own blog, and i realized that yah, i did associate guys with nice voice as nice looking myself too! haha. man. guess that's just human nature to do those kinda things? had interviews before with these cute guys and when they called i already guessed they'd be nice looking.. aah blah. should really try not to do these things tho. hmm and i really don't wanna mislead ppl by my stupid voice. have been thinking more and more about those pix things. and yah i guess it really isn't that much of a big deal anywayz for them to see me. i don't fucking care if one day i'm walking on the streets someone'd recognize me. hmm and besides, flora was asking me to send her our elementary reunion pix. so yah, i've decided that i really will go organize my pix around hopefully before the end of this month. have to go to staples to buy these cd-roms so i can save pix up and organize them tho~  aaaah and before i forget again, have to go buy pokari before the hoobastank concert!!! and also cuz me going to aerobics these days, really have been sweating too much that i need the drink! buy pokari buy pokari!!! (*_*) was supposed to buy it for linkin park concert before as well but i forgot! so yah this is major. hmm anywayz am gonna try going to bed before 12am today! have been having a hard time falling asleep for like almost 2 weeks now! damn! last nite i ended up falling asleep at like what, 2am?! and i got woke up this morning at 7.30 by noisy garbage trucks!!! aaargh. well that's all for today~  heehee watched the simple life earlier. paris and nicole got this handle name as the pink panther cuz their truck is pink. thought that's indeed a very cute and hot name! hahaha! and i love any stuff with pink leopard print!!! let's see, i bought this pair of knee-high stockings that look like the ones in the pic few weeks ago at holt renfrew. tho i haven't thought of the occasion i could wear the stockings to so i haven't even wore them once! (^O^);; anywayz will try soon one of these days~ lalala~   urlLink    Pink Leopard Print~~ XD

      除了想你　除了愛你 我什麼什麼都願意 翻開日記　整理心情 我真的真的想放棄  你始终没有愛過　你在敷衍我 一次一次忽略我的感受 我真的感到力不從心　無力繼續  這段感情　不值得我猶豫　不值得我考慮　不值得我愛過你 這種回憶　不值得我提起　不值得想起　　不值得哭泣 這段感情　早就應該放棄　早就不該讓我浪費時間找奇跡 這樣的你　不值得我恨你　不值得我為你而壞了心情  我决定不為你而毀了心　放棄愛你．．．   WOW... i absolutely love the lyrics of this song!!! actually i don't even know who sang it, or how the song sounds... (^O^);; but god, the lyrics!!! totally describes what i felt before. am really shocked actually.. haha.  but it's good tho. i've already realized that i should give up, that the whole thing was not worth it. i really shouldn't have wasted all those times waiting for a miracle or searching for that so-called truth. so yay! hooray to me!!! moving pass that whole thing was the best thing i've ever done so far in my life!!!

      went to lunch with sami today~ she was in the kerrisdale area so we got together. went to 'ginger and garlic', for me first time. and well it's an ok place i guess. tho these days i'm finding that i don't like chinese food anymore, it's really too oily.. aargh. but haha it was fun~ eating and chatting for like 1.5hr (^O^) oh, and i brought cheques to deposit today. i really could've done it later on in the days, cuz it's not important, but well, i purposely wanted to show sami the td bank cutie i like, so i brought the cheques along with me when i left. tho too bad, he wasn't there!!!!! AAAAAH~~~ (>____  let's see, was talking about that park place bldg in downtown that has the number 666 as address. we both find it very fascinating, hehe. and then told her i saw a car plate that's like 'HHH' the other day, and i'm like, i want a car plate that's like '666 HHH'!!! *LOL* sooo funny~ cuz that'd be like what, 'evil/horny pervert' XD but seriously, i'd really like a car plate like that! it'd be way cool!!! or else me gonna get one that's like '517 JEN' hehe, my fave number (my bday) and my nick! (^O^) otherwise me want a customized one.. that either mentions GLAY, or pink, or peach! wahaha!!! *crazy*  went to aerobics later on in the afternoon. waaaaaa soooooo tired. haven't had an intense exercise in a long time. aaaai. am gonna keep this up and go in for the rest of the week. not that i'm trying to be on a diet particularly or anything. but really, life in van is too relaxing and i've gained weight back again since i returned. i miss the way i looked in japan last yr at this time. even tho i was still somewhat chubby, i looked a lot fitter while i was there from all the walking around.. hah..

(^O^)  and then just when i was searching about the ticket info on that one, accidentally found out that 'Madame Butterfly' is gonna be in town as well!!! YAY!!!

      well the past few days had been kinda chilly actually, but today was sooo hot. aaah. tho i guess it still can't compare to the weather over in asia. can't believe tokyo's already got a record-breaking high temp this early in july at around 35 degrees. HOLY. am i glad last yr it was cool summer there or else i'd have been fried. hah.   after interview around noon, came home to eat lunch while watching soaps. haven't watched days and passions in a while, and hmm the plots are getting kinda interesting! think i'll keep tuning in for the rest of this week if i've got the time. went out for a walk around late afternoon tho. tried walking different routes today by going for the hills and stuff so i could get a better workout.  it really is too relaxing here in van. everywhere u go u just drive and u hardly get a chance to walk and stuff. guess one of the major advantages living in tokyo last yr was that i had to walk all the time. probably walked for at least 2 hrs every single day! plus i lived on meguro hills and the school was on shibuya cherry blossom hill.. so i had to keep walking up and down on these hills. no wonder i lost weight there even tho i had all the yummy food.   so yah, these days with the beautiful summer here, i'm feeling like i really should go out more to enjoy the great outdoors. so me gonna go for more walks these days! ah and i think i'll start up aerobics again. gonna go for it tomorrow! yay! lalala~~~   the weekend van sun had a report on the hells angels and put up a pic of their logo so i saw it for the first time. i mean, even tho i knew about the infamous biker gang, i didn't know they have a logo and it looks like that! cuz wow, that's such a cool logo!!! winged death head!!! love it~ (^O^) i love their name too, Hell's Angels.. but hah, i'm just weird. i'm interested in everything that has to do with lucifer the fallen angel. heehee~~~ XD   urlLink    Hells Angels (winged Death Head logo)

         urlLink     urlLink What Name Should You Have?   have to say it's quite accurate! i'm always being called too childish, tho i really dunno why ppl would think that way about me. hmm i guess i do appear to be childish on the outside, but inside it's like half innocent and half dark. darkness may be taking over more and more as i'm becoming older tho, hah. as for being funny and sociable, that really depends on who i'm with. if i'm with my close friends and ppl who know me well, then yah i'm all that. but if i'm with ppl i just met or i don't like or couldn't care less about, they would never find me as sociable. hah. i'm pretty subjective when it comes to meeting and getting to know ppl. but anywayz that's just me! aaah tho i don't really like that name krista.. hmm still sticking to jennifer even tho it's such a common name (^O^);;

      chilled at home today mostly. reading newspapers. watching tv. hah, watched that film 'fatal attraction' for the first time today! i knew what it was about before, but i just never got the chance to actually see the film. have to say it's a really good movie!! had me on the edge of my seat for the whole time.. quite scared and excited. i like michael douglas~ he's a really great actor and he used to look quite handsome when he's younger. like his film 'wall street' as well, which i just saw few weeks ago. maybe i just like his characters in both those films. corporate man or lawyer, wearing suits and trench coats.. (*O*) and quite dark mysterious looking too~ can't resist bad boys, heehee.  watched another old movie at nite. indiana jones and the raiders of the lost ark. can't believe the film was made the yr i was born! so it's already 23 yrs old! (*_*);; but well i like indiana jones series~ so just watched it to kill time~ nothing else interesting on tv anywayz. not feeling that well today and so stayed in cuz well.. pms. bleh.  watched the korean drama 'red bean girl' too~ nice drama, and i'm starting to really like it! can't wait to see what happens~ haha~ anywayz watched sooo many hrs of tv today. and well, quite a typical sunday for me. just relaxing and rest in~ lalala~ enjoying my simple life here in van~ (^-^)

      went to richmond centre sears for makeover session with dior at 11am. was there few weeks ago buying DiorKiss and saw the posters saying there'll be dior stylists coming in yesterday and today doing makeovers, so i booked an appointment. the stylist guy looks like that evil guy in "the mummy", the bald one who's the mommy but looks sooo sexy when he's not in mummy form (^O^);; seriously, i like that guy in the movie more so than i like the main character brandon fraser (well actually i don't really like him at all). tho only the stylist guy isn't as sexy as the guy in the movie cuz he's fat (^O^);; but well he's really nice.   took 1hr to do makeover. and he easily recognized me as a pink freak like everyone else does. so i ended up having everything pink for eyes and lips. hmm and in the end, i bought moisturizer and toner, as well as that pink/purple eye shadow set cuz it looks so nice.. aaaiyai. overspent money again on cosmetics (--__--);; am really bad. oops so now with the cosmetics around $130 and i bought that pink JLo bag the other day at $100 after tax.. total $230?! think i'm supposed to spend $300-500 now on visa?! after spending about $1500 on visa alone for 2 months straight before (while being unemployed --__--;;).. now i get a limit.   anywayz, funny thing was just 10min into my makeover when i've only had foundation put on, someone greeted me and it was eric and his mom. totally surprised me cuz i didn't think i'd meet ppl down there. kinda embarassing too being seen doing makeover.. well not exactly embarassing, just funny i guess. and it's really funny too cuz i would see him tonite anywayz at potluck. and he was saying 'wow u look so nice~' being all polite or i dunno what else, when i really haven't done anything to my face other than foundation! (^-^);;   went to vivian's house to order pizza so we'd go to potluck together around 7.30pm. she asked me whether or not i like opera, and hey! found another opera fan!!! sooo happy~~~ (^O^) in early may 'la traviata' was showing and i didn't think friends i know would be into that kinda thing, so i didn't even ask anyone. only to realize later that sami likes operas too. it kinda figures cuz we're both taurus and appreciate the finer things in life, something like opera. anywayz, so i missed seeing 'la traviata', sigh, only if i had asked her. but well, now i know another person who likes opera! YAY! next time there's nice opera in town i can ask either one of them~~~ can't wait!!!   potluck was ok. nothing too special. was really funny that everyone got excited by the new pizza hut 4-for-all pizza we ordered tho. haha. and of course bumped into eric again there, asking me to show him the make-up i've done. tho before going there i had already wiped off my pink eye shadow. i didn't wanna show up there with all the make-up cuz ppl are gonna think i'm so weird to dress up for that event, which i really wasn't trying to do. the makeover sessions are yesterday and today, seeing how yesterday i had an interview, there's only today left. but so yah, he's like "hey show me ur face!... wow u look really nice!" and i'm like but i've already taken off the eye shadow... it's just basic make-up now with foundation. (^O^);; had the other eric say the same thing too. man guys really can't notice how differently you've done ur face huh..   something about eric said after seeing me this morning his mom commented me as being pretty. but i'm like, that's what elders always say to youngsters.. they're not gonna come up to you and say "gosh ur ugly..", rite?! (^O^);; but anywayz i appreciate the comment in my heart~ haha. he said that afterwards he and his mom came down to look for me again wanting to see how i'm done after makeover only to find me already gone. hmm oh well.. it's nothing serious really..   and aah, had sort of a weird chat with him too. started talking about honeymoon cuz he's getting married in a month. he doesn't seem to take honeymoon seriously and i was a bit surprised.. and he kept saying "no, really, what's honeymoon anywayz?" and i'm like.. ur supposed to spend a whole month together and stuff.. and he's like "to do what?!?" i'm like "uuh.. sex? ur supposed to just keep having sex thus creating a sweet relationship (honey) for an entire month (moon) and that's how you get the word 'honeymoon'..." (^O^);; felt quite weird being the one explaining to a soon-to-be-married guy who's 10 yrs older than me btw in his 30's what a honeymoon's supposed to be, telling him it's a period of time when u keep having sex. and the weirder thing is, he doesn't even seem quite excited about it either!!! he's like "that's it?!? just sex?" (*__*);; i thought guys would be a lot more excited than that and be like "wow! a whole month of hot sex!!" anywayz he's a weird but funny nice guy.   have to say that after going to that church fellowship for so many times now, hah enough times to be able to vote for their next chairman, i'm still not familiar with most of them except eric and his sis. most of the times they are the only ones i talk to. i find it funny/ironic actually, that the other eric who introduced me to the group doesn't talk to me as often, or didn't at least try to be nice about it and make a better effort for making me feel more welcomed there by talking to me more and stuff, after all, he's the one who brought me there! so well, that's probably why i got a bit pissed before and didn't go there for a while, other than the fact that they had boring activities. but bleh, who needs him anywayz, i can go find my own fun in the group~

      bbq was quite fun. was held at this HUGE mansion in shaughnessy. sooo big and pretty~~~ was just in awe the whole time i was there, haha~ the bbq itself was nothing too special tho. cuz still ended up talking to the ones u already know! damn! that cute cbc guy i saw last week who has the brightest smile i've ever seen actually wanna be a chef. so he was the one doing all the cooking and stuff. at the end of the dinner he had to clean up and stuff too so he couldn't join us for the ice breaker game! so damn! i still didn't get to talk to him! (>___  saw this other cute young guy tho. sorta timid looking but looks sooo cute when he smiles~ has 2 dimples!!! (*O*) very cute~ but i think he's way too young. *LOL* the guy's probably not even 20!!! damn i'm becoming a pedophile.. first there's daniel radcliffe and now this?! haha crazy weird me~   was very funny cuz i bumped into an old ubc friend maria. actually i didn't even know her well before while we were at school. i just knew her cuz she's the sister of this cute guy whom debby had a crush on at the time cuz he looks like takizawa hideaki. vaguely remembered that i've seen her at some ta events and it turned out i was rite! she said i look familiar too haha. so we got into talking and catching up. yay~ so it was quite good cuz vivian couldn't come today. she had really wanted to come to the bbq but suddenly got pms last nite so had to cancel this morning. oh well there's always next time~   the funny thing was of course, everyone kept asking me about the huge bruise i got on my upper rite arm!!!&nbsp;everyone seemed sooo shocked and would ask me what happened.. like i got into fighting?!?? *LOL* i'd tell them i got it at this concert i went to on thurs nite. and of course, everyone looked very confused as to how u could get a bruise from a concert!!! hahaha~ it's really not a big deal anywayz cuz i've got bruises before from concerts too. so i'm quite used to it already~ but for ppl who know nothing about rock concerts, it's actually getting kinda annoying having to keep explaining to them that this kinda stuff happens...   eric was the only one who knows about rock concerts seeing how cbc he is, haha. he was like wow u went to the mosh pits? and then he's like how come u didn't get guys to go with u to protect u? yah i dunno. that morning i was talking to johnny and i told him i'm going to a concert and he's like "wuu~~ with a guy?!?" u all know i'm single! why'd u just assume that i'm going with a guy anywayz?! so weird. but well, quite frankly, i dunno guys who're that big to protect me anywayz. all the guys i know are just same height as me! it has to be someone tall and strong enough to protect me in the crazy mosh pits!!! (>___  and somehow i'm known in that group for being a frequent movie goer. they'd always ask me about which new movies i've seen and stuff. so funny~ and then somewhere along the line i dunno, we got into talking about clubbing. and i'm like 'no i don't go clubbing anymore for a long time'. and eric just said 'oh no, she would~'. now where the hell did that come from?!? (@__@);;; do i even seem like the type who loves clubbing?!?? that's the weirdest thing.. haha~   so the bbq ended way earlier than i had expected. i got home at 9.30pm. but then i figured since tomorrow i'll be going down to seattle i better just come back to rest cuz i'll have to wake up at around 8am the next day! so lalala~ blog away all the missing stuff these past few days~ (^O^)

       urlLink     urlLink    *LOL* huge-ass bruise i got on my upper right arm from the previous night's Hoobastank concert. was fucking crazy i tell ya!   this morning when i woke up i realized all the muscles and joints in my body are sore as fucking hell. really just wanna lie there on the bed and not move~~~ once i got up and looked into the mirror tho, noticed that i've got a big bruise on my upper rite arm!!! HAHAHAHAHAH~!!! (^O^)v dunno why, but i felt really happy i've got a bruise~~~ felt like it's some sorta proof that i've gone to the concert. is actually sorta like a trophy in a way. i have weird logic. *GRIN* but it *really* hurts... (^O^);;; well that's the price u pay for having fun and going crazy! hehee~ tho i can just see now, i'm gonna get sooo teased by ppl cuz they'll all get shocked seeing the huge-ass bruise... *LOL*  went out to kerrisdale again today. haha. had to go to td bank to withdraw usd for going down to seattle on sunday. funny that i've been going there twice this week already! i just went there on tues! (^O^);; well but today when i went in the guy wasn't there. but just when i was lining up, the guy came in!!! he went out to get lunch!!! and he went upstairs to eat... DOH!!! and to think i dressed up nice today!!! damn! (>___  went to bean bros cafe to keep writing my summer greeting cards. there's this guy i noticed for all the 3 times i've been there this week!!! he's always there! soo funny! he sat outside tho and i sat rite on the counter facing outside, so i was behind him. hehe. he's kinda cute. hmm the italian cafe rite across from bean bros is really nice too, but i guess i still prefer bean bros just becuz they've got these counter seats. i love sitting there facing outside and watching the ppl walk by~ and yah, could see cuties too if there are any *LOL*  went to oakridge around 5.30pm. had to go do exchange at aritzia for this top i got the other day at downtown that's too big. and aaah! i ended up buying stuff again!!! (>___  she took me to this new izakaya in yaletown called "shiru-bay". just opened for 2 months or something and it's the same owner as "guu". but it's quite different from guu tho! cuz WOW, it's such a cool place!!! (*O*) it's sooo stylish and trendy!!! it's also got very good food, and very cute waiters!!! yah, that last part was the most important one. *LOL*  there's a japanese waiter there, tho i think he's also born here cuz his english is really good, who's sooo cute!!! (*O*) and he's got the chin ring!!! just like how cutie chester used to look like!!! now how cool is that?!?? (^O^) spiky hair~ i think he's same height as me but eeh that's ok as long as he's cute haha~ he's sooo nice tho, kept smiling all the time~ the whole time i was there i'm thinking in my mind like "damn, i'm definitely gonna be bringing my friends into the restaurant to eat a lot in the upcoming weeks!!!" so i can see him!!! hahahaha!!!  we later realized after going to the ladies room that the restaurant's hiring. they put up this japanese ad and the one major criteria is that u have to keep smiling all the time! no wonder that cute waiter was smiling always. yah i'm told that u can often get misled by waiters cuz they act that way to everyone...  well, so alyson was saying how she may consider going to work at the place! and i'm like why would u do that when u already have a job being a jpn tutor. and she's like "so u get to meet new ppl!!!" and i'm sooo clued in. hahaha. i guess that'd really be a good way to get to know the cute waiter huh... (^O^) and so now i'm considering the option too myself! tho i dunno.. waitressing is such a tiring job. and me being spoiled rotten, i dunno how to carry those plates around anywayz!! and it being izakaya would mean that it won't close until pass midnite.. i dunno if i wanna work till that late.. (@__@);; man i really am picky... haha  i think i'm actually one of those 酒好き type of person. not that i drink a lot or like to get wasted, but i love cocktails, kahlua, champagne, and japanese plum wine!!! (^O^) had the peach cocktail tonite. in the menu it described it as 幸せのお酒 (^O^) yay! hope it'll bring me more more happiness!!! hehe!!! they have green tea cocktail too tho!!! was sooo surprised, happy kinda surprised!!! cuz i'm definitely gonna try that one next time i go there seeing how i'm an absolute maccha freak!!! hahaha~  went walking around in yaletown after dinner at about 9pm. the funniest thing happened. while we were waiting at the stop lights these 2 white guys who were crossing the street and coming towards us started talking to us! actually i only noticed 1 guy cuz the other guy was really really short!!! the tall guy was sooo cute!!! (^O^) while he was coming towards us he was all smiling and everything, so we of course smiled back seeing how the ppl here are just always friendly on the streets smiling at each other (^O^) thought it'd only be like that, but then he started to chat with us!  he asked us if we went to the indy's. i'm like no.. and ooh yah it's the indy's weekend! it goes on till sunday rite? and he's like yah, u should go check it out! haha.. and then he said something about we looking cute haha. so funny~ man.. dressing up differently really gets u somewhere huh.. alyson was saying how this has never happened to her before that some guy would just come up to talk to u on the streets. so hah! me really gonna change my style and dress nicer!!! crazy little me. *LOL*  tho damn.. apparently there's a lot of cuties down at the indy's. i'm definitely going next yr!!! (>__  oh yah and during dinner at izakaya i told her about the td bank cutie and how my heart would race up whenever i got him and i would end up mumbling things so he couldn't hear me clearly and would always have to ask again and i'd have to repeat it... and she was laughing SOOO hard, i'm like (--___--);;; ひどいよ～笑わないで！ god.. so embarassing.. and she's even like, "u know, if my throat isn't hurting and my voice is still all good, i would seriously just laugh out sooo loud that what i'm doing now would seem like nothing!!!" *sigh* i always get laughed/teased for my boy craziness.. (^O^);;;  went to urban fare too. first time for both me and alyson~ haha and it's such a cool place!!! i like the salads they have in there~ am thinking from now on i'll go there to do grocery shopping sometimes! seems crazy tho, i know, to go to yaletown to buy food while i live down in kerrisdale... (^O^);; but haha i should seriously start going to yaletown more often!!! i saw sooo many cute guys there the whole nite!!! and some of the prettiest boys i've ever seen!!! oh maybe it has something to do with the fact that it was a fri nite too, but really, tons of hot guys my eyes were like starry all the time!!! alyson was quite amazed that i was checking out guys sooo fast tho... hahah.  anywayz afterwards went to alyson's condo to play. haha~ she's sooo technology advanced!!! she has this mic and net phone.. and she showed me how to use 3/4-way calling. so fun. she kept telling me to go install it to talk to ppl online ever since i was in japan. but hmm i really dunno who to do that with and i'm really not that good with those too complicated stuff so i didn't go install the net phone. well, so there's one cbc guy who just got back from uk and we were all talking together. and alyson was saying how these days she likes how these cbc guys talk, it's really cute. and i'm like yah yah!!! i totally know what she's talking about!!! (^O^) so alyson and the guy wanna get together on sunday to welcome the guy back but also to send alyson off and i'm also invited seeing how i was there at the time. tho too bad.. me going down to seattle that day! otherwise i'd really like to meet him! alyson said he's really nice but not cute, but it's ok, it'd just be nice to make a new friend anywayz~ and the way the guy talks seemed funny~  then i started to play with her webcam~ haha! sooo fun!!! now i know why ppl go crazy over taking their own pix using webcams!!! at the time i was taking pix tho, alyson's highschool friend in taiwan was also online so we were talking on net phones. she could hear me taking pix cuz there'd be sounds. and she's like i'm sooo slow in taking pix. apparently it's totally different from the way alyson did it cuz she'd just keep taking tons of photos really fast! haha~ alyson was like "haha finally someone narcissist like me!" but really, no i'm not! i just thought that it's fun to try out cuz i've never seen webcams before~ and i haven't really taken any pix this yr so far, so i thought it'd be cool to take some that nite, seeing how dressed up i was anywayz. it wasn't until after i took about 10 pix i finally realized i had to take the pic of the bruise!!! hahaha!!! can't believe i hadn't thought of that earlier and had like no idea what kinda pix to take just smiling stupidly at the webcam while all along there's the perfect thing to take pix of! (^O^)  stayed till pass 1am. haha. sooo fun. should definitely do this more often!!! (^O^) anywayz another lovely day!!! so will the next 2 days be for bbq and seattle!!! sooo happy~~~ this is turning out to be an awesome summer indeed!!! (^O^) and mom's coming next fri!!! YAY!!!

      I'm not a perfect person  There're many things I wish I didn't do  But I continue learning  I never meant to do those things to you  And so I have to say before I go  That I just want you to know   I've found a reason for me  To change who I used to be&nbsp;  A reason to start over new  And the reason is you   I'm sorry that I hurt you  It's something I must live with everyday  And all the pain I put you through  I wish that I could take it all away  And be the one who catches all your tears  That's why I need you to hear   I've found a resaon for me  To change who I used to be&nbsp;  A reason to start over new  And the reason is you   I'm not a perfect person  I never meant to do those things to you  And so I have to say before I go  That I just want you to know   I've found a reason for me  To change who I used to be&nbsp;  A reason to start over new  And the reason is you   I've found a reason to show&nbsp;  A side of me you didn't know&nbsp;  A reason for all that I do  And the reason is you   &nbsp;  the song that made hoobastank famous. it's really a sweet song and i love the lyrics. the video's awesome too. soo funny and creative. got such a huge twist. haha. so anywayz, during the live, they played this song in the middle of their set. when they finished the song, doug said something like  "so i've been told that this is the song that's most often used at weddings in 2004. well, so if that song's the one ppl get married to, then this next song is one..."  and i thought he's gonna say  "ppl have sex to"  *LOL* he said  "...ppl get divorced to"  hahahahaha~~~ so i guessed wrong. eeh close enough~ (^O^);;; my dirty little mind... *GRIN*

      let's see.. went to kerrisdale bean bros cafe in the afternoon to write summer greeting cards. and realized aaaaah~ i'm forgetting japanese!!! (>_____  tho i guess i still could communicate alright. at least with yumiko. and she's surprised i know all these weird slangs. *LOL* was supposed to meet with her at 6pm and i did get to downtown at the time. but the goddamn parking lot i had wanted to park in ate my money!!! then i had to frantically search for another parking lot to park.. ended up being a cheaper place too except that it was kinda crappy and scary and smelly..  while yumiko and i were walking along robson and stopping in front of milestone's to check out their menu and deciding where to eat, bumped into eric! was totally surprised when he called out to me! and to think that morning i just sent his mom off to the airport and i just bumped into him like that! hah!  these days i'm always bumping into ppl in downtown tho. when i went shopping the previous day i bumped into a commerce classmate too, and she got all chubby and i couldn't really recognize her! (*O*) one day a few weeks ago when i was in downtown doing interviews i bumped into 3 ubc ppl.. amazing. u always tend to think that van is so small and it should be easy to bump into ppl, yet that's not always true. sometimes it can be big enough that u never get to bump into the ones u really wanna bump into!  anywayz eric was walking around there after work and so he thanked me for dropping his mom off at the airport that morning. told him we were gonna go to a concert and he's like wow~ but he doesn't know anything about them, yah i had figured that'd be the case. few yrs ago i bumped into him at the savage garden concert tho. hah. well, finally decided to eat at the downtown tropika. was telling yumiko about south-east asian cuisine and she's all like happy~ so we went there. yumiko was all surprised that it's soo trendy and 'high class' looking. haha (^O^)  thought the doors open at 8pm and since the floor area doesn't fill up that fast at commodore anywayz i decided we'll just get there rite at 8pm. turned out were we wrong... the line-ups were SOOO long it went on till 2 blocks away!!! by the time we got in, it already filled up a bit on the floor! aaah! we were still standing really close to the stage like at 5-6 rows but not close enough.. wuu. commodore was all dark inside that nite, so weird. but then again i haven't gone there in almost 3 yrs ever since the david usher concert! (*__*);; asked yumiko how the default concert in may was like and she said it wasn't dark like that since the beginning too! so yah it was so weird! cuz then i couldn't really see ppl's faces! i had really wanna go there to find cute guys!!! hahah...  at dinner while we were discussing about the band yumiko said the lead singer doug is half japanese! sooo shocked!!! so yumiko said hoobastank is quite famous in japan. and yah! there were quite a lot of japanese there that nite! there's an asian guy, i think most likely japanese, standing beside me and is about the same height as me, who looks quite cute! and it was sooo funny cuz we were head bopping and moving our bodies to the rhythm in the same way... (^O^);; tho damn i still didn't talk to him. hah oh well.  i actually know only 2 hoobastank songs yet the reason i decided to go to their concert was, yah first to find cuties, two cuz i haven't gone to concerts in 5 months so i really wanna go get crazy, and three cuz of that lead singer! when i first saw them at the linkin park concert i thought he looks like edward norton. yet when the video for 'the reason' came out i thought he looks like john cusack! and i really like john cusack!!! haha.. but no now i don't really think they look alike. anywayz he's cute~ and has got a great voice~ and now that i know he's half japanese, i may just like him more~ (^O^) haha! mixed-blood half asian rockers are cool~~~  i thought there's only 1 opening band, at least that's what the radio and webpage said for all the days before! yet it turned out there were 2! both opening bands and i had no idea what's their names were awesome!!! the 1st one had a lot of these melodic songs and i love their rhythms! i did notice their bassist look like ryan gosling!!! hahaha. and it's ryan gosling from the notebook cuz he has all the beard!!! so he's not really pretty, but i dunno why i kept looking at him... (^O^);;;  the 2nd opening band was apparently more famous tho cuz some ppl could recognize their songs. when they were about to play a slow song the lead singer said something like  "it's hard to play a slow song when ur not having sex"  and this girl rite in front of me yelled out  "yah!!! i want sex!!!"  *LOL* so true, so true... HAHAHAHAH~~~ (^O^) and near the end of their set that lead singer dived into the crowd!!! XD~~~ was actually rite beside me! i moved away cuz i was scared.. haha. but it was totally surprising! i thought he had just wanted to step onto the fence to be really close to the audience to sing or something, yet he dived down!!! first time ever to experience that!!! the band dived in!!! was sooo fucking cool!!! hahahahaha~~~ band diving in is really fun!!! especially if ur rite near the stage!!! wahahaha!!! oh yah and in all the craziness i did manage to touch the guy, but eeeeh, it's all sweat... (^O^);;;;;;  so yah, doors opened at 8pm. 2 opening bands each performed 30min yet took another 30min to set up the stage, so by the time hoobastank came on it was 11pm, and went on for 1hr to finish just pass midnite. but OMG... what a fucking crazy live!!! this was definitely BY FAR the scariest / craziest live i've ever been to!!! cuz there were lots of mosh pits and lots of surfers!!! (>____  hooba started with the song 'out of control' yah, one of the only 2 songs i know. haha. and it's really fitting too to start the live with that song~ cuz everyone just really went totally outta control!!! yah, and let's see, when hooba came on i was in the 2nd row centre rite in front of the mic stand. but that first 5 min for the first two songs was probably the TOUGHEST time ever in my life!!! TONS of ppl pushing from both sides and from the back... couldn't really stand still from all the pushing so u could only flow with the crowd. very scary. had to be so careful cuz there were sooo many times i thought i was gonna fall down!!!!!  by the time the 2nd song finished i lost contact with yumiko and got pushed to a bit back. (>____  one guy noticed me and started talking to me. he's like a mountain~~~ seriously!!! he's probably like 180/190+!!! and it was quite dark at the time so i felt like he's just mounting over me... i had to raise my head so high to look at him. i did see that he's quite good looking tho~ and muscular~ XD it's really funny, cuz i really dunno why he'd talk to me while hooba's still playing at the time!!! so it's really noisy and hard to hear!!! i mean if ur gonna talk to someone, usually u'd wait till the song's finished isn't it?! (^O^);;; but well, so he asked for my name and we shook hands. i think i asked for his name too but i can't remember what it is now... (^O^);;; and the funniest thing was he said  "don't worry, i will protect u"  *LOL* that did feel really sweet at the time, and i was like "oh ok thanx~" but then i think he's one of those mosh pit guys cuz he's sorta in the circle... well so he really wasn't standing close to me to "protect" me anywayz! i mean if ur gonna protect someone like u said u would, shouldn't u be with the person close by?!?? so i thought that's really funny.  another song went by and he came up to ask me again to see if i was still doing ok. and i'm like yah i'm good. and he said something like "ooh yah... u like that don't u..." (?!???) i think he meant it as something like i like these mosh pits and like going wild and crazy?!??? but well, that's the last i saw of him. i moved away from that crowd and he disappeared. *LOL* so what the hell was the whole "ooh i will protect u" shit?!???? jeeeeez. (^O^);;;;;;; u know, i wasn't really expecting some guy to protect me... but anywayz it's all fun~ hahaha. thought the whole thing's just really funny and interesting tho. (^O^)  so that guy was no help. but this other cap dude was really really nice. when i first noticed him i was behind him. and his muscles were.. hmm kinda like these wrestling guys so kinda scary. then somehow i could move up so then we were standing next to each other before hooba opened. that's when we were still rite in front of the stage. during the waiting times these guys kept pushing from the sideways and this cap dude helped us all by pushing them back. and he still had a smile on while he was doing all that! i mean it's really uncomfortable and everything yet during the whole time he would keep his smile!!! i thought that's really nice of him. and i noticed that he looks quite nice too~  somehow both of us got pushed backwards. and i ended up standing in front of him i think.. and he protected me!!! (*O*) see, now that's a nice guy! cuz even tho he didn't say out loud "oh i will protect u" his gestures showed!!! compared to that other guy who said so yet didn't do it!!! hahah.. (^O^);;; and doug threw down a water bottle and the guy caught it!!! and he gave it to me!!!!!!!! (^O^) i was sooo thankful at the time cuz i really needed some water!!! hmm tho now that i think about it i was kinda bad cuz i didn't offer him to drink?!? all the other guys were looking at me for the water so i gave them the bottle after i took a sip. and i dunno, if the cap guy had wanted to drink, he could've drank first then gave me ne? so i guess maybe he didn't wanna drink at the time?! tho that's hard to believe too seeing how fucking crazy the concert was and everyone was dehydrated from all the sweat and heat... ah anywayz i dunno.  the stupid funny thing was i kept the water bottle cap. *LOL* how crazy am i?!?? cuz i thought well afterall that was the water bottle doug threw down..... even tho i didn't technically catch it myself, the cap guy handed it to me rite after he caught it~ it's really dumb cuz i mean, it's just a plain aquafina water bottle cap!!! (^O^);;;;; but well u know, it reminded me that the whole thing wasn't a dream and it really happened ne? hahah. tho it's too bad doug didn't take a sip first. i mean, some other singers would drink first then throw the bottle down ne? now *that* would've been much much nicer!!! cuz then it'd be like indirect kissing... XD~~~ HAHAHAHAH!!!  doug started out wearing this long-sleeve shirt.. as he sang the buttons started coming off one by one.. and till the middle of the set he just took the whole shirt off. XD~~~ so he was topless and covered in sweat... god, my conclusion now is that the image of sweaty topless men (if muscular enough) is the best sight in the world!!! seriously, i was just drooling there and eyes fixed on his body~ fucking sexy!!! XD~~~ his muscles are just sooo firm!!! aah, i think tonite i'll just fall asleep with the image of his body in my mind... *GRIN*   urlLink     urlLink    sweaty topless Doug~ XD   they closed the set with the song 'crawling in the dark'. seriously, how come their song names are sooo similar to the ones by linkin park?!?? there's 'crawling' vs 'crawling in the dark'. 'runaway' vs 'running away'.. and some other ones i can't remember now. but one thing was confusing tho. they didn't do encore!!! at the end of the main set doug did say "so this is gonna be the last song..." but i thought that's what all bands say anywayz and there'd still be an encore. but there really wasn't! when the song ended and they went off the stage everyone really just started to leave!!! so how come there was no encore?!?? yumiko and i were totally dehydrated and fucking tired we just wanted to get back immediately to the car to get those pocari sweat to drink. otherwise we were saying at dinner originally that we'd gonna go wait for the band at the back door for autographs!!! wuu... no energy... *sigh* maybe next time...  yumiko was sooo lucky tho. she somehow got to be in the front row rite up against the fence!!! (>____ _____  i was also sooo stupid to wear that new top to the concert!!! i had really wanted to wear the pink skull tshirt like i did to the linkin park concerts last yr, but then i vaguely remembered that the one time i went to commodore before a lot of girls there were wearing these sexy nice girly tops! so then i decided to dress up like that too! (>____  sooo shocking. can't believe i stood for 4hrs straight again!!! am freaking tired. i think my neck's gonna break in half... it hurts like fucking hell from my head-bopping too much. anywayz even tho it was quite scary when u were in the moment, it's all really fun afterwards when u think about it~ i love losing control and going all hyper and crazy once in a while~ it does u good, really! am actually just contradicted. i mean on one hand it was quite hard to really enjoy the concert being in the mosh pits and everything. u have to constantly be on guard for nearby surfers so u won't get kicked in the head and stuff (it hurts like fucking hell to be kicked in the head!!! i think i got kicked a few times!!! wuu. >____  and i totally love 99.3 the fox now!!! they're just fucking awesome!!! yumiko and i were both saying how these days the radio station we listen to just stay fixed on the fox channel. *grin* they really know how to please the crowd. cuz let's see, during the waiting times for all the set up, they played that famous nirvana debut song.. eeh i can't remember the title.. youth something. "here we are now, entertain us!!!" (^O^) and everyone of course instantly recognized the song and would all sing along!!! the same thing happened again and again for the muse's 'our time is running out'... some jet song... and red hot chilli peppers 'californiacation'. immediately after the concert, fox put on 'i love rock'n roll'. i dunno whose song that is, rolling stones?!? but well everyone went all crazy and was all singing along to it again!!! hahaha!!! 99.3 the fox ROCKS!!! and I LOVE ROCK 'N' ROLL~~~ WHOOHOO~~~ and Hoobastank is quite good!!! they totally rock!!! me gonna go buy their albums now definitely!!! hahaha!!!  i *SO* love going to rock concerts. when ur standing there close to the stage and u hear the loud drum sounds, i just feel sooo alive. those loud drum beatings against ur heart beats... nothing more satisfying than that. i really feel like it's a proof of living, and i guess that's why i love going to concerts. when ur in the crowd and u feel the whole audience melt into one being, all just enjoying and loving the music, and everyone losing control and going hyper crazy, it's just fucking fun. ロックコンサートに行くのが大好き！生きている証なんだから。and it's funny too that because the live itself is sooo aggressive it's actually like a battle of life/death!!! 真的是像經歷了一場生死大戰一樣說... when it all ends i'd be like "aaah~ i'm sooo glad i'm still alive!!!" *LOL* 生きていてよかった！！！

      so far this week i have no interviews. don't think i will get any anywayz cuz this week there's not that many openings i saw and so i didn't send out that many applications. am just gonna slack away this week, like i spent the entire day today in downtown shopping~ haha. but it's fair i think?! cuz ever since mid-may i've been having interviews every week ranging from 2-5 per week! so yah i think i deserve a little break~ haha~  mom called earlier at midnite. couldn't tell her i went shopping today and ended up buying 5 tops for like $250 in total... (^O^);; *sigh* i'll just be like before, let her find out on her own when she gets the visa bills later on... ah ha... am such a coward.  anywayz, told her i went to the steps aerobics again yesterday cuz alyson postponed the dinner plans. and aaah! even she's getting suspicious now as to why i'm suddenly all interested in working out after slacking off for sooo long!!! (>____  but seriously, i don't really know why either? maybe subconsciously i really do have reasons. but well so far the only possible reason i can come up with is cuz i'm liking someone now?! but it's sooo weird tho. when i had the stupid crush on the td bank guy for months before i still kept slacking off! yet now i'm all like aerobics crazy and wanting to change my style to wear more girly clothes?!?? it doesn't really make sense! aaaah i dunno. is just all so complicated and weird.  人は本当に見知らぬ人でも好きそうになるよな…… ネットだけでの交際でも…… まだ気になるっていう状態になってなくても、 少なくとも、確かに気にするよな…… でもどうしよう……そうなりたくないわ！ ギャー ヤバイー マジヤバイよ～！ 誰か助けてェ～（＞＿＜）

      it's unbelievable. went to downtown and originally had only wanted to do window shopping.. but ended up really buying stuff and overspent again. (^O^);; and i walked for 4 hrs straight until i finally went to rest and sit down!!! (*O*) wow.. i don't think even when i was in japan or taiwan i had walked for that long before i took a seat to rest?!? man.. was just really crazy today.   ended up buying like 5 tops. ah ha... am so bad. what's even worse is that 本当に恋に落ちちゃったと思う。えぇ～ヤバイ！cuz i started to buy these girly cute shirts! doh! other than the 2 tna tops i bought for workout so they're sporty, the other three tops all just look nice and feminine for the summer. man.. these days i buy a lot from zara and banana republic. but i'm really getting tired of all my tees. even tho they're still cute with all the cool slogans, they're all the same style! so yah, i think i really need some changes in my closet.   saw in holt renfrew this new juicy couture bag. it's sooo cute!!! looks like the one britney spears has in that new everytime vdo!!! (*O*) sooo pink and fluffy!!! but aaah it's expensive. (>__  i'm always seeing these costly nice stuff... damn. mommy and auntie chie are always saying how the things i like all turn out to be expensive stuff. well i can't help it.. how would i know they all end up being expensive (*__*);; but this is becoming like a bad habit.. gonna be outta control soon. aaaah. i need help.   after walking around for 4 hrs and my feet were killing me, finally arrived at chicco. had the green tea parfait for dinner~ hehe. who the hell has parfait for dinner anywayz?! (^O^);; aah and since i was sooo freaking tired from all the walking around and shopping i didn't have the energy to write my summer greeting cards.. (>__   urlLink     抹茶パフェ～大好き！（≧▽≦）   well so i was reading this jpn fashion mag there. there's a report on all these male actors. in the list there's daniel radcliffe. and it goes like, 想像以上に成長が早く、上半身なんてもう逆三角形じゃありませんか、のハリー・ポッタ君。(Mr. Harry Potter is sure growing up faster than public expectation. Isn't his upper body already becoming like this reversed triangular shape?) HAHAHAHAHAHAHA~~~!!!!!!! XD totally just bursted into laughter when i saw that!!! cuz it sooo confirmed my views!!! kept telling ppl how daniel's chest is becoming broader and stuff after seeing the new movie and everyone thought i was weird that i put soo much focus on his body!!! but finally! someone else agreed with me!!! daniel radcliffe is becoming more and more drool-worthy!!! god i'm such a pedophile... (^O^);;;   aah~ also saw in the mag this ad for new sony cyber-shot digicams. these new ones are sooo cool!!! u get to turn the lense around to take ur own pix!!! aargh hard to describe in words, it's just sooo cool!!! how come the cyber-shot d-cams in japan are nicer looking?! i dropped by future shop today wanting to check out their prices for the nikon coolpix, only to find out they don't carry nikon.. but i looked at their sony ones and they're all bulky!   man.. now i can't decide which d-cam i want! *sigh* tho i guess i'll still stick to the nikon coolpix one cuz i only need a basic d-cam with like 2-3 megapix.. the new sony ones have up to 5 mega.. that's too much for a beginner like me i think.. and besides, me not in japan now to buy it anywayz.. too much trouble to ask ppl to buy for me too..   i dunno why i want a d-cam now? just cuz it looks nice. haha. crazy weird me. i was thinking of just getting a mobile camera cellphone like the one i had in japan. those cells are really quite convenient to use! u get to call ppl but u also get to use it as camera too! but then now that i think about it, once i take pix with the cell i always have to email them back to PC too so it costs money. then i might as well just get a separate d-cam?!   but omg, now it looks like i have sooo many things i wanna buy! (>____  new cell - something way less than $300?! since now i won't be needing the mobile camera function i wanna keep the cost down.. just a pretty colour flip phone.  nikon coolpix - $300  new contact lenses - $200. think i just ordered these the other day.. not sure how much in total yet tho.  new hair-do - $100. really need to trim my super long heavy hair!!! aaargh!!! and i wanna get red highlights too~ not sure about perm or not tho.  skin-care products - damn i think i ran out of some things again! and to think i just had the dior makeover few weeks ago and already end up buying way more than i had wanted that time! (>o  hmm still not sure about the juicy couture pink fluffy bag.. but the small one alone already costs $350 or something.. even more than the coach bag. doh.  think i'm supposed to not buy anything expensive before the 25th. cuz the plane tix mom and i bought was put into this month and cost thousands already. so i'm supposed to wait until august to buy things. but damn.. i spent over the limit again~ aaaaaaah. i really shouldn't go out to do shopping on my own. i always end up buying stuff or seeing stuff that i want!!! (>___  anywayz, came home rite at 9pm just in time for the simple life. haha. and wow, it's amazing really, cuz i finally watched her sex tapes this morning! (^O^);; i know it's all the big fuss last yr, but i never got the chance to see it.. well i didn't know where i could see it either. finally today i got the links from fwd email. haha. and i was sooo shocked cuz it's sooo explicit!!! (O____O);;; the only one time i've seen a porn was the one on that twn female politician, but that's really nothing compared to the hilton tapes!!! haha. was just really shocked~   well, it was such a gorgeous day today~ i didn't think it's that hot at first cuz there's the breeze and everything. yet later on it became so hot i thought i was in asia!!! apparently it's gonna get hotter for the next few days~ yay~ nice sunny day on sat for bbq~~~

      涙がこぼれ落ちないように 滲んだ空を見上げているよ  人はどうして想いの ままに生きられないの  泣けない弱い心も 泣かない強さもいらない  願いをかける流れる 星を探してみるけど  夜明けがもう早すぎて 見付けられずにいるよ   君の事思い出す日 なんてないのは  君の事忘れた 時がないから   悲しい事に出会う度に 大丈夫だよと口グセになる  あの日何かが止まって しまったこんな私じゃ  いくら祈ってみたって 星ひとつさえ見えない  会いたいよねぇ会いたいよ 記憶の中の  笑顔だけ優しすぎて どうしようもない    為了不讓眼淚掉下來 抬頭用淚眼看著天空  人為什麼就是沒辦法 照著自己的意思生活  我不要哭不出來的軟弱 也不要哭不出來的堅強  雖然我試著找尋 一顆許願的流星  但黎明來得太早 令我無法尋找到   我從未有一天 想起過你  因為我從未有一刻 忘記過你   每當遇見了傷心的事情 告訴自己沒關係已成了我的口頭禪  那一天我心中的 某個東西靜止了  這樣的我無論如何祈禱 也無法看見任何一顆星星  好想見你真的好想 在記憶裡的  你的笑容太溫柔 令人感覺好無奈    aaah.. wanna go see the fireworks this yr!!! (>O  but this yr it's quite a good timing tho. sami's never seen the fireworks here. vivian hasn't seen it here either. yumiko as the jpn int'l student also hasn't seen it~ it'd be sooo cool if we can all go together! shannon has summer school out in uvic till thurs so she won't be able to make the wed one, sux. hmm may be a good time to get in touch again with other highschool friends like jess, celine, and agnes. and i can ask those church fellowship ppl to go too! the more ppl the more fun! YAY! i hope we really do go see the one next wed!!! can't wait~~~ XD

      dinner plan with alyson is postponed till friday. it's good, cuz then i could go to do aerobics. can't do it this thurs cuz of the concert tho, so that kinda sux. these days i really love doing the steps aerobics! hah! can totally see now why rie got sooo into it before (^-^)  let's see.. so i *did* go to td bank today. and i *did* end up getting him!!! (*O*) was so funny. cuz the old man in front of me got him, and i was thinking in my mind "oh damn.. now i won't get him!" but it turned out that old guy was soo quick they finished in like 1 min or 2! and then it's my turn with the guy! haha! man i guess that praying did help huh... (^O^);;;  but i still didn't talk to the guy (^O^);;; one thing was cuz it was kinda busy there today and i looked around at other ppl, no one would talk to the tellers!!! so how am i supposed to talk to him?!?? aaah. and well the other thing that's really the reason why i didn't bother to chat with him, was cuz i realized today that i'm not into the guy anymore. when i got him today my heart rate didn't race up!!! *LOL* cuz seriously, for the past couple of months when i got him, my heart would pound sooo fast~~~ i guess it's kinda good tho that i got over him. cuz it's a really stupid crush anywayz.  but it's funny, just when i realized i don't like him anymore i finally figured out his name!!! (^O^);;; it's a really special name i must say.. hardly ever see guys with that name! and i realized today he's quite skinny (*_*) but well, he's still really nice looking~  and OMG... i think he really might be the guy who called me before!!! (>_____ ____  and it's crazy. even tho my heart rate didn't race up anymore when i saw him today, i still ended up mumbling stuff!!! DAMN!!! (>___  went to bean bros cafe afterwards to chill for like 2 hrs... writing summer greeting cards. and also took the time to think why i got over my crush now. *sigh* is probably cuz i got interested in someone else. damn... cuz that's not a good thing either. it's complicated. aaaaaargh.  kept looking out at the passers-by while i was there. damn how come there's no cute guys in kerrisdale?!?? cuz there were tons of hot girls walking around, yet in the 2 hrs i was there, there were only what, like 3 nice guys?!?? man.. it's no fun~ haha (^O^);;  went to check out that big camera shop today. last week i passed by there and saw they put this nikon coolpix digicam on the display, and wow it looks sooo cute!!! (*O*) so i went in to ask about it today~ haha~ i don't really know how to use these high-tech gadgets. haven't wanted to buy a digicam (until now) cuz i think they're quite complicated to use.. and well, i'm not the type of person who loves taking pix all the time. am not that photogenic to tell the truth. haha. but aah, that digicam is sooo cute now i'm like i want it sooo much!!! i have to do some thinking tho...  so i spent the whole afternoon in kerrisdale. took me 10 yrs to realize how much i love the neighbourhood. seriously, these days i would go for walks in the area for like 1 hr after lunch! and i feel so thankful that i live on the mackenzie heights cuz there's all these uphills/downhills i can walk on. and then i get to see the views from the hills too~ yay! feel soo nice watching the views on a bright sunny day~  love the kerrisdale commercial area too. dunno how to describe the atmosphere there. it's definitely not like downtown. yet it feels really great there too. lovin' kerrisdale~ XD really! i think it's better than shaughnessy! that area is soo dull and boring with all the old mansions. and they don't have a commercial area like we do here. it's lively here~ hehe~ anywayz it's been a lovely day~ lalala~ (^O^)

      these days since i really wanna try talking to the cute td bank guy i keep asking ppl for advice. hehe. am really gonna try it out tomorrow IF the guy's there and i get him~~ *pray* i just have to figure out first if he's single or not, or else it's gonna be so embarassing to hit on him when he already has a gf...  aaah~ and i finally thought of a good way to get to know the guy!!! i should go make friends with the other tellers there!!! (^O^) hahaha~~~ am sooo stupid. why didn't i think of this few weeks ago?!?? seriously, i just thought of this like on friday! the idea just suddenly crossed my mind and it seemed to be like quite a good one! tho i'm told that if i go make friends with the girls there, and the girls like the guy too and wanna date him, they'd just lie to me, and then that's no good. (@_@);;; so i should go make friends with the other guys there then. damn.. and just the other day i got that twn guy who was soo friendly and everything!!! damn i didn't think of this last week or else i'd definitely try to talk to him more!!! (>___  guys all say it's a lot easier for girls to pick them up. jeez.. supposedly the "directness" = "desperateness" in all of that makes it hot. (@_@);;; but i hardly know any girls who'd go put the first moves on the guys they like! it's really hard!!! (>___  is really funny tho. apparently i'm very weird cuz i'd talk to strangers if they come talk to me *LOL* debby's sis is in tokyo now studying for the summer and it's her first time there, so i was telling her the other day to remember to tell her sis not to talk to strangers on the roads. cuz apparently those guys are pimps who are either asking u to go do porn films or to set u up with sugar daddy like 援交. only just found that out few months ago and i was sooo freaking shocked!!! (O_______O);;;; cuz i thought it was just normal pick up! they started by asking u "how old are u..." "are u a student or are u working..." and i thought that's like pretty normal! some guy told me the other day that those are really obvious clues tho. cuz apparently in japn porns they show a lot of that.... now how the hell was i supposed to know that?!??  but it's really funny tho. i don't think i even seem like the type of girls who'd do those things! so why the hell would they come talk to me in the first place anywayz?!?? haha. found the whole thing just very funny. is actually an interesting experience! i only talked back to those guys cuz i thought it's a good way to practice my japanese... *LOL* and i guess i was quite young at the time so i was a lot braver and didn't care. last yr when i went i got scared a lot easier and wouldn't respond to strangers on the streets anymore.. just walked by quickly and pretended that i didn't hear them.  but then i've told a number of friends these and they all said they would never talk to strangers on roads like i did! so apparently i'm really weird! either that or i'm just easy to pick up?!? *LOL* or i'm just very gullible. let's see, few weeks ago some guy started talking to me on the bus too and i would talk back to him... only that he turned out to be a complete freak and scared the hell outta me. but yah, i guess i'm not that wary of strangers?! that's actually a very dangerous thing for me to act like that tho.. (--___--);;;  am so contradicted. i always think of myself as the type who doesn't trust others easily. yet a lot of times i think others think of me as the type who'd easily trust ppl. it's like i get easily cheated by ppl on internet too. *sigh* i'm just sooo gullible. tho i dunno what i should do to overcome that?!

      ah the other day at this bookstore in richmond centre, me and sami saw these japanese comix english versions. and it described mars as  "a bad boy can change a good girl forever" ... *LOL* that's the funniest thing i've read in a long time!!! can't believe they summed up the whole comic in that one sentence tho.. cuz i mean mars was much more than that! but haha, it sure was a super eye-catching phrase.. at least it caught mine and i love it lots! hehe~   am always attracted to the wrong type of guys. either playboy or bad boy... jeeez. it's like fatal attraction, really. *sigh*

      finally finished re-organizing my pix! yay! just sent off these elementary reunion pix flora asked for~ it's almost 2 weeks since she wrote to me to ask for them.. ah ha.. i'm just lazy to go look thru my old notebook computer, but it's all good now! i'm finally done with this! feels great finishing something~ (^O^)  tho other than my own pix, there're still tons of these GLAY pix scattering across numerous discs (@__@);; dunno how to organize those.. gonna take up freaking long time! so i'll just put that off again~ haha. have too many GLAY pix i love.. it's just hard to organize.  put up a digital photo album too. had one with yahoo few yrs ago. but these days they changed the outlook or something cuz the pix are all the same size! i had pix before that used to be bigger, yet they just automatically shrinked them down! (>__  and it's funny, i finally remembered the other day that i had used to wanna call my blog "Peach Life". tho now that i've already come up with some other name, i'll use that old one with the photo album then~ haha (^-^)

      for the past 3 days i went to sleep at 2am. cuz i figure i've been having trouble falling asleep lately, so i might as well go sleep later by tiring myself out first. see if i can fall asleep faster this way. well i did fall asleep ok, but i woke up naturally at like 7-8am!!! (@__@);; and to think it was the weekend! it's so weird! i tend to sleep later on weekends at like around 2am too before but i would wake up at 11am! man.. something's really wrong with my sleep these days...   this is gonna be such a busy week i dun even know how i'm gonna do stuff now..  mon - read weekend newspapers. i always have newspapers pile up on the weekends just cuz the weekend ones tend to be a lot more than the weekday ones. and i typically get so busy on the weekends running around i hardly get the time to sit down and take the time to read! (>__  tues - dinner with alyson. and so i think in the afternoon i'll go to kerrisdale cuz i'll be dressed up anywayz. haha.. yah.. it's all just an excuse to go to td bank to see the guy!!! hahaha~ and yes, tomorrow i will have to go to the bank cuz i'll be soon outta cash again! OH i have to pick up my sheets too! it's been like 2 weeks! and i really wanna go to cafe to write these summer greeting cards. am always sooo slow when it comes to writing cards. if i don't get these out soon before i know it summer'll be at the end again! cuz damn! i can't believe half of july already passed away! just like that! (>____  wed - go to downtown to see how that devil bldg celebrates its 20th bday. *LOL* no my real purpose is to go walk around commodore to see where i can park for the next nite when i go to concert. wanna go to that oriente cafe too, and gonna go write cards there as well. oh and i wanna go do shopping too~ lalala~  thurs - send auntie wu off to the airport around noon. hoobastank concert at nite. not sure what i'm gonna do for the other parts of the day. either rest and prepare my energy for the live, or just do more job search.  fri - so far nothing yet. but then i'll probably need the day to rest after concert anywayz. see if i can get interviews to put on that day too, if i do get any this week. so far i haven't got any cuz i haven't sent stuff out.. ah ha.  sat - dentist at noon. bbq at nite. (*O*)   i'm really supposed to clean up the house and do laundry like last week! aaaah! seems like there's no time to do those this week~ damn.. will have to put off till sunday or next week.. am just gonna keep procrastinate (^O^);; really could've done those yesterday cuz i was free and home. yet i went around scanning and organizing pix. it's still all a huge mess. i've got pix everywhere on tons of discs! have absolutely no idea how i'm gonna organize them...

      aah, instant messengers, hate them while loving them at the same time and can't live without them. been using icq for 6 yrs now. tho i think i'm gonna delete it sometime this week just cuz nowadays everyone's using msn. started to use msn only since last sept, am soo slow haha. so my msn experience is not even a yr yet! been thinking these days that it's no point really in keeping 2 programs while it's mostly the same ppl on both lists anywayz so me gonna delete the icq account. i like to keep things simple.  tho somehow 2 months ago i started to do things to complicate myself up. someone found me thru msn search and wanted to add me. i thought the guy's profile sounded really interesting.. well.. something about he's the ceo of an internet marketing firm *LOL* and he's only 27! so yah, i wanna know how he got to be the ceo at such a young age! but since the email account i use with msn includes my real name and stuff, i don't wanna add the guy using that account. i don't like to tell ppl personal info before i get to talk to them. so i signed up a different msn account to add the guy. yet i never saw him online and i rarely used that account anywayz. so that 1st month i've had that account it was basically just idle.  later on johnny sent me this cool msn add-on program that let u put up big pix. and u get to use multiple accounts with it. around that same time i got screwed, and these 3 weird guys tried adding me on icq. i didn't know at first what the whole thing was about, so i talked to them. when they asked for msn account, i just gave them that new one then cuz it's for ppl i dunno in real life anywayz.  now that i think about it, i don't really know why the hell i went to sign up that new account?!?? hmm so far there's only 5 guys on it. am thinking these days i'm gonna delete that account. it's too much trouble and weird having these 2 msn accounts. why the hell did i go sign it up to complicate myself anywayz?!? jeeez. sometimes i think i am sooo fickle. is strange actually for a taurus to be like that. i thought taurus ppl are supposed to be not liking change?! yet i change sooo often.  haven't made new net friends in like 3-4 yrs. and the past month talking to these guys have got me into thinking about the whole net friends business again. it's sooo weird. this one guy who found me from the whole shit, so we didn't start off well and of course i have bad image of him cuz of that, he's sooo hung up on me for some reason that's way beyond my comprehension! i'm sooo goddamn cold to him yet he's soo masochistic or something he still keeps wanting to talk to me! jeeez. cuz seriously, if i were him, i would never wanna talk to myself! hah! on one hand i have to say he's good to be soo persistent, yet it's actually really annoying to me that he acts like that. he kept asking me to talk on the phone and would just give me his cell#. i told him i'm not interested in that at all and kept telling him no way, yet he still doesn't get it!!! am sooo tired each time having to deny him... aaargh. some guys just really don't get it, no matter how many times u've said 'no' to them...  and it amazes me. how can he be soo obsessed with me anywayz while we've never even met? i didn't show him my pix either, so really, he doesn't know anything about me! yet somehow he just kept saying he's sure i'm a nice girl and blah blah, while all along i was sooo cold to him. so how the freaking hell would he just think i must be a nice girl anywayz from the way i acted?!?? cuz i mean, if it's someone who i know in real life who acts that way, then i can probably still understand it. but if it's just someone who u dunno at all, how the hell can u be obsessed with them?!?!?  the other thing, they would just keep asking for pix soon after chatting. but for me, i thought the whole point in making friends from the net is that u get to know the person inside. if u care about the looks so much, why don't u just go meet someone in real life where u get to see rite then and there how the others look?!  aaargh. dunno. it's all soo confusing. sometimes i kinda regret i got myself into this whole mess. my life would've just been a lot simpler if i had ignored all of them. just follow the policy i've been following for yrs, only add ppl u know in real life! but then sometimes i'd think since my life is already soo simple these days that i hardly ever get to meet new ppl, it'd be interesting to meet ppl this way too. so i dunno. i'm really just contradicting myself.  but well one thing's for sure. i've made up my mind now that sometime this week i'm just gonna delete the icq and the new msn account. am just gonna go back to be like before, keep the one true msn account and keep everything simple. voila!   urlLink    the new MSN account i signed up 2 months ago for net friends... it really just has 5 ppl on it. but aaah stupid me (>___<);;; i've lost interest in making net friends yet again, after merely 1 month...

      went to kerrisdale at 4pm to send this parcel out. i always park at the free parking lot behind td bank whenever i go to kerrisdale. so today, when i turned to yew st, i saw the teller guy walking out of the bank!!! (*O*) was sooo surprised!!! hahaha~ but damn, there was this HUGE truck there on the street at the time so it blocked my view... there's hardly any trucks in that small street before, how come it's there just on the day i have someone i wanna see?!??? (>___  went down to the td plaza at 5pm to meet with yumiko for the fox free concert series presenting "out of ur mouth" (^O^) the live was said to start at 5.30 yet by 5 there were already a lot of ppl waiting there! was kinda surprised actually. the stage was sooo small tho, haha~  around 5.15 the members came out to do sound tests and stuff. and wow, that lead singer looked a bit different from the video.. probably cuz he wasn't wearing make-up? *lol* but still, he wasn't like how i thought he would be, since he's actually quite a small and skinny guy!  i thought he looked pretty hot in that video, but hmm when i saw him for real i didn't think he's that hot anymore. but then again, he and that lead singer for "velvet revolver" looked kinda similar in that they somehow look like druggies... (^O^);;; i'm kinda attracted to weird men these days, haha.  the 30 min live was quite good! their music is really loud tho... and they're such a violent band!!! when the vocalist sang he'd grab other members' hair!!! yumiko and i were both sooo shocked (O__O);;; and we were like うわ～暴力的だね～ haha.  for one song, the lead singer started by saying  "we'll be talking about penis... we'll be talking about vagina... we'll be talking about masturbation..."  HAHA~!!! (^O^) very interesting indeed... maybe i'll go pick up their album too~ *GRIN*  they did the famous madonna cover for "music" at the very end. it really is quite a brilliant cover, tho i dunno how they'd feel as a band knowing they got all popular and famous now cuz of that song, which wasn't even ur own song to begin with and was only a cover! (^O^);; still, i love the song~ hehe! and that video's really cool. quite creepy tho, with all the chucky lookalike dolls and everything. they brought those dolls to the show too! they put them rite above the amplifiers and stuff! very cool~ haha!  there were mosh pits even there at the outdoors tho. but i hate those kinda ppl!!! they obviously just went there to keep fighting and stuff!!! and in doing so they often bumped into others who were trying to enjoy the music!!! (>___  was also very shocked cuz these 2 girls rite behind us were smoking pot!!! (O__O);;; i didn't know u can do that out in the open! it smelled sooo fucking bad!!! *way* worse than the normal 2nd hand smoke. i know it's ur freedom to smoke whatever u want, but it's our freedom too to be able to breathe clean air!!! (>___  anywayz, was still quite interesting to be able to see a new band do a free live show like that. since they're so new they did autographs and photos so easily with ppl~ tho i think both yumiko and me got kinda scared by them and everything so our interest wasn't that high in doing those stuff. otherwise it would've been quite cool~  yumiko didn't hear clearly that i said i have up to 7.30 to go to dinner with her and stuff the other day and she said she had to go back home. (--__--);;; so went back to buy take-out stuff and also for mom to eat when she's back home. she already got out when i arrived at the airport. haha (^-^);;; she too fast and me a bit slow i guess...  came back home and i told her i didn't clean the house at all for the entire 5 weeks she's gone. and she's like "ur kidding me rite?!" and i'm like "nope~ i really haven't cleaned at all since u went back!" and then she hit me (slightly)! hahahahaha~!!! (^O^);;; and then made me clean the floors immediately there at 9pm...  anywayz~ so i'm not home alone anymore! hehe! and will have about 2 months with mom here fooling around~ yay! \(^O^)/ it's still always nicer with mom around~ even tho now i can't listen to fox anymore when i go driving and blast the radio loud... and she'd always nag when i take about 1hr to dress up to go out... (^O^);;; haha, still it's all good! lalala~~~

      lately i've been wondering a lot of things.  i wonder what it would've been like if i were to stay in japan all along till now like i had originally planned. i wonder if i were to do job hunting in tokyo all this time, would i have found a job by now already? or i'd be fooling around like i am now too?  i knew already last summer when i went there, that Glay Expo would happen this yr. when i went there, they just ended a tour, and so i didn't get to attend a single concert the whole time i was there. well i did go to these special events and see them in a mini acoustic live. but no, if it's these live concerts where i really go crazy and lose control, then i haven't been to one of their concerts like that in 3 yrs.  i also knew by the time i was gonna leave japan that Glay'd be doing a tour early this yr. yet still, i decided to come back to van regardless of the upcoming live tour and the Glay Expo. cuz i realized that i've grown up already and that i shouldn't base my decisions all on Glay anymore.  still, i wonder what it would've been like, if i had made my decisions all dependent upon Glay. to stay in tokyo and then to be able to go to their X-Rated concerts... and then to go to their Glay Expo now in Osaka's Universal Studios. to see how they dress up for the event, and to finally be able to celebrate their 10th anniversary since debut rite there with them.  i also wonder for some of the recent events in my personal life, what a difference it would've made if i were to do things in another way. would it have changed anything? if i had chosen to do things differently, would it be a different situation now?  but eeh, i guess we'll never know. what's past is past and what's done is done. u can't change ur past and undo the things u've already done. i'm not the type of person who regrets easily anywayz cuz i'm always more of a forward-thinking person, even tho yah, i'll still engage in these "i wonder" moments sometimes, but hey that's just human nature.  so well, with july coming to an end, will just keep moving forward and let the past be! 前向きにいよう～！be positive~! \(^O^)/

      Let's talk this over It's not like we're dead Was it something I did? Was it something you said?  Don't leave me hanging In a city so dead Held up up so high On such a breakable thread   You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it And all the memories, so close to me, just fade away But all this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending   It's nice to know that you were there Thanks for acting like you cared And making me feel like I was the only one  It's nice to know we had it all Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  i don't like avril. well not exactly dislike either, just have no feelings whatsoever. but for some weird reason i know all her singles and i can sing them all. i guess the radio and muchmusic play them too often. but i do like her songs. i can relate to most of her songs cuz of the lyrics, and i suppose that's why whenever i hear her songs i'd sing along.. haha~ and rite now, i just absolutely love her latest single! seriously, i think now i may really go buy her albums cuz of this song!  somewhere in the past 6 yrs, i've finally realized that there's no perfect man nor happy endings. yah.. was way too gullible before and i used to think there'd really be a perfect man! only to see how it all later blew up in my face. i guess that whole thing made me somewhat cynical too. but it's ok cuz one can't stay all innocent and naive for that long anywayz.  i think it could've been something amazing... but well, i guess it's all for the best anywayz~

      Broken this fragile thing now And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces And I've thrown my words all around But I can't, I can't give you a reason   I feel so broken up And I give up I just want to tell you so you know  Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go, but there's just no one who gets me like you do You are my only, my only one   Made my mistakes, let you down And I can't, I can't hold on for too long Ran my whole life in the ground And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone   And something's breaking up I feel like giving up I won't walk out until you know  Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go, but there's just no one who gets me like you do You are my only, my only one   Here I go, so dishonestly Leave a note, for you, my only one And I know, you can see right through me So let me go, and you will find someone   Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go, but there's just no one who gets me like you do You are my only, my only one   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  been hearing this song a lot lately both on the radio and on muchmusic. just love the lyrics. i find it kinda funny too cuz the reason i love the song sooo much is becuz i can totally relate to it for having that same experience.  was so dumb few yrs ago when i was a lot younger and more naive and so i did exactly what the song said... at these Glay concerts i really just screamed my lungs out trying to get to Teru... but then of course, at the time, i was kinda blinded by the whole thing that turned out to be all lies...  still, i have to say that Glay will always be a big part of my life just becuz they've influenced me sooo much on everything. if it weren't for them, i wouldn't be the person i am now.  and that's why these days i've been thinking, if i were to get a tattoo someday, i'm gonna do one that's somehow related to Glay! haha~ just becuz they're sooo important to me and they'll always be a big influence in my life. so i wanna get a tattoo with the kanji words of Glay --> 愚麗 hehe~ it's cooler this way! i also wanna get that flaming heart logo of "pure soul" album, just cuz it looks sooo goddamn nice! (^O^)v  man.. these days when i think about these tattoo thingies i realize i have sooo many ideas! other than those 2 symbols, i wanna get a Playboy Bunny one too.. hehe. and i wanna get a peach one. both of those in hot pink! haha! oh! and i wanna get a cutie devil tattoo! hmm preferably a pair of devil and angel i guess!!! that'd be sooo cool!!! hahaha! *crazy*  hmm, tho now i'll have to think of 5 different places on my whole body to put all those tattoos!!! (@_@);; but yah.. one of these days, hopefully before i'm 25, i'm really gonna go get tattoos!!! even tho i'll be scared to death by all the pain... (^O^);;;     You keep me alive You are the fire burning inside of me You are my passion for life    Glay's my passion for life......

       "X-RATED / HIT THE HEAVEN"    urlLink    GLAY EXPO 2004 logo / mascot  it's now 731 in japan, the official Glay Day. and in a couple hrs Glay Expo 2004 will start in Osaka's Universal Studios...  it's sooo unfair!!! how come this yr their mascots are sooo damn cute?!?? it's the pirates!!! is actually quite funny tho, cuz it's all influences of that Johnny Depp film last yr. but pirates really suit the theme i think, cuz they're rebels~ heheh~  but yah, how come this yr's Glay Expo have such cutie mascots while 3 yrs ago they had that ugly weird alien thingy?!?? (>___  and aah, they just finished a pre-show which was also free the nite before Expo!!! (>___  *sigh* i wish i were in Osaka rite this moment......

      ok.. today i really just fooled around. was supposed to do some job search cuz i haven't done so in like 10 days. but eeh, leave it for tomorrow i guess. and aah i'm still supposed to wrap presents to send off! and i have like a whole week's portion of newspapers piling up on my table!!! (*___*);;;;; i have to try finish reading them tomorrow before mom comes, or else she'll freak out seeing how they're all piling up...   aah the only thing i got done today was blogging. hahah crazy me. finally finished updating all my previous entries. there's been too much happening in the past week or so that i haven't had the time to write them all down. but it's finally done today! so yay! (^O^) this blog's really just here for my personal satisfaction tho~ hehee!   was talking to debby and she said her luck in love sucks at age 23. hah! i think my luck in love sucks big time this summer!! let's see, that jpn fashion mag said the following: for the week of ６・２２ー７・１２　 牡牛座の恋愛運：不安定。新しい出会いは良縁ではなさそうです。最初は感じが良くても、つきあい始めた途端に態度が豹変する暗示。 when i read that, i was sooo shocked cuz it's rite on!!! (*O*) i don't take horoscopes that seriously, but i mean, sometimes when it's sooo accurate it can be quite shocking...   the same thing happened when i read in the other twn mags tho. it said something like there'll be one person who likes me, and who has all these places he wanna show me but he'd have a hard time convincing me to go see the views. while there'll be this other person whom i like, and there'll be all these places i wanna show him and would have to keep persuading him to go see the views. and the mag concluded that lately in the summer, i will experience both situations... and it's sooo true, cuz i have been going thru this these days!!! (O__O);;;   the funniest thing was i think i either scared or pissed some guy off. not that i care tho~ but i do find the whole thing amusing since i've never had something like that happen to me before. so i told johnny about this, that i think i scared some guy away. and the first thing he said back was "why? cuz ur too open-minded?!?" (*__*) ok... so apparently i am open-minded?!?? and that's supposed to be a bad thing?!?? that's sooo weird!!!   i dunno how he got the idea i'm open-minded tho.. so yah, he knows i'm boy crazy but i think he only knows i'm crazy about brad pitt and daniel radcliffe. he doesn't know how boy crazy i can really get. so i find it weird he immediately said i'm open-minded and to say it in a way as if it's bad..   i don't deny that i'm open-minded. and i take it as a good thing. tho i'm just surprised that's the first thing he said when i told him the whole thing. cuz he wouldn't really know how open-minded i can be anywayz since i've never discussed sex-related topix with him! hmm only that i've put up these stupid weird msn nicknames before saying how i'm a pedophile... and how i would *love* to be taken captive by brad pitt and orlando bloom *LOL*   so yah, i've learned now tho that ur not supposed to discuss anything sex-related with guys!!! cuz u'll scare them away!!! jeeeez~~~ anywayz, and so debby was really confused as to how i scare guys off. hahaha! seriously, i dun really know either?! my weirdness pissed them off i guess. but then again i like to scare ppl away anywayz. i find it sooo funny! haha so yah, i actually take pleasure in all of that!   i put up one of the webcam pix i took at alyson's the other day, the one where i'm doing the licking tongue. cuz i wanna see whether or not this guy will get scared away. seriously, that pic is not cute at all cuz my face is all twisted together doing the licking tongue pose! so i don't think he can see me clear enough anywayz! yet for some weird reason he found it cute!!! aaaah!!! and he said now he's more attracted to me!!! what the hell?!??? (@___@);;; my intention was to scare the guy off yet now he's more stuck on.... jeeeez.   it's fucking ironic. the ones i wanna scare away couldn't be scared away. yet the ones i don't wanna scare away ended up being the ones scared away!!! what the hell?!??? so see, i really have no luck when it comes to guys...   so anywayz, the one guy i wanna scare away but he won't be scared away. told him that i scared/pissed some other guy away cuz he deleted me altogether, and he's like that guy's mean and he won't do something like that. i said i don't really care (if he ends up deleting me)~ and he said i'm mean for saying that! for saying that i don't care! hah! but it's true, i hardly give a damn what others think of me anywayz. and well, this guy should know better too cuz i've acted soo cold and mean to him all along.  the funny thing was he said i must be quite rebellious from the way i act. cuz i love rock music and i love scaring ppl away. now he got that part rite! hahaha~ i'm a rebel!!! \(^O^)/ who loves to scare ppl away and takes pleasure in shocking ppl!!! *LOL* but oh come on, i just love to scare ppl cuz i like to defy them... to show them that how they think of me is not always true!!! and it's always very interesting to see ppl's reactions... hehehee~!!!

      the other day at chicco reading this new jpn fashion mag i came across this new ad for the brand "Rock & Republic". WOW~ immediately fell in love with the brand just cuz of the name! hahah~ damn i didn't know about this brand earlier tho, or else i could've gone looking for it the other day in seattle too!!! i can be quite slow at times... (^O^);;;   anywayz so i did some research on the net and found out that we carry the brand here too! apparently holt renfrew and aritzia both do! tho i've never seen it there!!! how come?!?? gotta go look more closely next time~~~ and there's this one trendy yaletown shop called "Atomic Model" that carries the brand as well. yay~ gotta go down there to play in yaletown sometime and look for this brand!!! wahahaha~~~ *crazy* 搖滾共和國!!!   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   found the following article too, and thought it's pretty cool~ hehe! (^O^)  &nbsp;  Rock and Republic at MARCS  By: Carmine Pascuzzi   THE hot denim label of the moment ROCK & REPUBLIC is now stocked at MARCS stores. A limited edition of 170 pairs will be available in you nearest MARCS store from July onwards. The new favourite denim of the celebrity set in the United States can now be yours. Cameron Diaz has christened Rock &amp; Republic jeans “the wonder bra for her butt!”   Rock & Republic means sexy, progressive denim for women inspired by Rock&nbsp;& Roll, with its emphasis on modern silhouettes with sleek fit. The edgy, rock styles and supremely sexy fit have garnished rave reviews, and brought Rock &amp; Republic a loyal celebrity fan base including Britney Spears, Sarah Jessica Parker, Hilary Duff, Alicia Silverstone, Renee Zellweger, and Paula Abdul.   Rock & Republic CEO and head designer Michael Ball likes designing for women. He was born in Las Vegas and grew up there and in Southern California’s San Fernando Valley. With both parents associated with the music business, Michael was exposed to a lot early and is identified with the maverick spirit of Rock &amp; Roll for as long as he can remember.   By the time Rock & Republic launched in July 2002, Michael was experienced in the clothing business and very clear about what, and for whom, he wanted to design. Keeping sexy and confident young woman in mind, and the notion that  everyone deserves to dress like a Rock Star , Rock &amp; Republic exploded, and is now established in over 500 upscale stores worldwide… all within a year of the company’s launch.   Rock & Republic rocked Smashbox in October 2003 as the line brought “Spring Invasion 2004” to Los Angeles Spring Fashion Week. Pairing outrageous body suits with barely there mini skirts and tailored denim, the  Glam Rock  vibe resonated as models and special guests Kimberly Stewart (daughter of Rod Stewart), Jake Sumner (Sting’s son), and Katie Cassidy (David Cassidy’s daughter) pounded down the runway to classics by Bowie and Iggy Pop. The music blared and lights flashed as over 2,000 spectators mobbed the scene to see the collection parading down the catwalk in front of a 20 foot high Neon sign. Rock &amp; Republic succeeded in bringing fashion to the next level with an all out  Rock Riot !

      still went down to watch the fireworks today even tho no one else wanted to come. haha. man ppl're all sooo lazy!!! (^O^);;; well or maybe it's just me too free with all the spare time being unemployed and outta school... haha.   tho the whole place was still sooo packed!!! yet how come none of the ppl i knew want to come? they either say they're tired after working a whole day or just don't wanna see.. oh some even dunno about the whole thing after being here for 10 yrs! (*__*);;; anywayz so i just went with vivian and met up with yumiko at the beach.   got down to the beach at 6pm. but vivian and i decided to go have dinner first. the korean cuisine place was sooo crowded with TONS of ppl lining up! was actually quite scary. so we went to guu. i haven't been to guu in sooo long cuz nowadays i just go to hapa. and eeeh, now i really dun like guu. the food's only ok. that other yaletown place i went the other nite was definitely better! not just better food, but yah, better waiters too... hehe.   got back to the beach around 8pm. found a space so we started our long waiting. fooled around taking pix using vivian's d-cam. haha. we were kinda dumb actually, but eeh, it's all fun. saw the funniest thing tho. the whole time i was there, i saw 3 ppl wearing that licking tongue tee!!! (^O^)v one girl with the black one like mine. one guy with the white one. and the most interesting one was this guy who had on a red one, yet the tongue was actually the canadian flag!!! thought that's sooo cool!!! now i want one like that!!! later on i realized it's a real rolling stones tee they had at one of their concerts here. sooo cool tho. they customized the licking tongue logo to the canadian way!!!   well, so the fireworks were just awesome. and the weather was sooo nice today being just breezy and not too hot with big sun. oooh yah, after the fireworks ended, when vivian and i were walking on pacific blvd back to burrard bridge, bumped into this old ubc commerce classmate!!! tho i totally forgot her name!!! sooo embarassed... we were in two classes together and even worked on a project!!!&nbsp;yet i just can't remember her name!!! (>___  ah~ i just love watching fireworks... so pretty. i love the way japanese call it too. "flower fire"~ haha. the fire really is pretty like a flower in bloom~ tho i dunno why, the whole time i was there watching the fireworks, i had only one thought in mind. that 花火＝愛情。 真夏の恋、本当に花火のように短く輝いて、気付く前にもう終わりを告げた…。 i really dunno why i kept thinking about that? as i was watching the fireworks going up blasting away, i realized that it's just like love, especially these sudden summer love, shining so beautifully for a few short moments and then it'd just all suddenly end, sometimes without even a slight warning...   坐在海灘上, 身於人海中, 看著美麗的煙火, 綻放著燦爛的光芒, 然而就在轉瞬間, 那璀璨就淹沒於黑暗中, 悄然地消失並墜落了...... 真的就像愛情一樣, 不是嗎? 短暫的夏日戀情, 當妳還沉醉在那美麗的快樂時光裡時, 它已然悄悄地結束了, 像是從來不曾發生過似的..... 徒留惆悵......

      read this other new jpn fashion mag there at chicco as well. and there's a report in which the topic is:  あなたの「快感体験」とは？  *LOL* have to say my absolute favorite word in japanese/chinese is 快感.. and of course the english one would be "pleasure" (^O^)&nbsp;i dunno why i love the word so much? maybe cuz it has that sexual connotation? *GRIN* even tho it doesn't always have to be...   but anywayz, the report listed rock concerts as one of the ways u can experience ultimate pleasure.&nbsp; 好きなアーティストがいる場合、一番の快感といえば、やっぱり生ライブをおいて他になし！ストレスも消えて吹き飛ぶ大音響のサウンドの中、しばしのトリップ。  and yes!!! now i finally know why i love rock concerts sooo much!!! that phrase summed it up all so well!!! (^O^) it's becuz my stress would all go away when i'm hyper crazy, and i'd get into this sort of trance / hallucination state of mind as if i'm on drugs!!! that's&nbsp;exactly it!!! the ultimate pleasure~~~   just heard on the fox today that they'd be presenting that fox free concert series this fri with the band "out of your mouth"!!! yay!!! finally!!! a band i know!!! they've been doing the free concerts thing for couple weeks now and i really wanna go to one but i didn't know the bands! now i can go~~~ they did an awesome job covering madonna's [music]. and i saw from the video that lead singer is kinda nice looking himself! haha! dunno why i'm finding that kinda visual guy with make-up on sexy these days tho... (^O^);;;   anywayz, so told yumiko about this, and we're really gonna go!!! YAY~~~ tho it's gonna be a busy day. i have to go to the airport to pick mom up around 7.30pm. the free concert's from 5.30-6pm i think?! leaves exactly some good time for dinner with yumiko, but then i'd have to rush afterwards~ oh well~ it's all good! can't wait for friday now~~~ lalala!!!

      had trouble calling mom on her cell last nite, well actually i think i kinda forgot how to call cells in twn using long distance. so had to call to home this morning when it's like nearly midnite in taiwan. just wanted to know where those beach mats are!!! i can't find them at all~ (>___  anywayz the interview was ok. oh it's at the rbc centre tho. find it very funny cuz it's like the only bldg i haven't been to in the downtown core business district around burrard and georgia. seriously, i've been to every other bldg in the area, just not the rbc one! now i've been to them all!!! haha~~ (^O^);;   went to holt renfrew again just to check out that juicy couture bag. i saw britney spears everytime video again, and the bag she wore in it, was really the juicy couture one!!! (*O*) cuz it had the golden heart-shaped mirror thingy!!! and apparently britney's a big fan of juicy couture anywayz so it really is the bag!!! yah... now that made me want the bag more (^O^);;; tried on the small one but the strap's too short and i'm too tall so it doesn't look good on me (>___  was reading my schedule book for last yr the other nite and realized that mom went to tokyo to visit me exactly the same time she's gonna come here! july 30th! and 3 days later tho i got my dior messenger bag... *lol* yah, let's see if she'd let me buy the juicy couture bag 3 days after she comes here this time... both bags actually cost around the same price too. haha... tho i think she wouldn't go crazy this time to give in to my desire... (^O^);;; well one can sure dream! holt renfrew's only got 2 of them tho, 1 big and 1 small. that's all. so yah.. if it's sold then nothing more!!! (>___  went to sears to get these dior skincare stuff. now the saleswoman there could recognize me too. and started to tell me about these dior makeover sessions they're gonna have in the end of sept for the new fall line-up called "the amethyst collection". love amethyst~ purple crystal~ (^O^) well, so in all my crazy addiction to dior, i agreed and signed up for the makeover sessions again... apparently if i buy enough stuff there at the session i could go do a dior skincare facial at their salon (*O*) damn... i have to think of some ways to limit myself not to go overboard for that session and end up buying things i don't need...   went to chicco for lunch. i've always wanted to try their panini but all the times i've gone before it was just too hot and so i ended up eating their parfait. so i finally tried the panini this time! and wow it's really good!!! just like i had thought cuz i've seen others had it before when i went in~ (^O^)  there's this half japanese guy i've seen twice at the store now already tho. he's cute!!! (*O*) haha.. and i dunno, both times he and his friends were there around 1pm, and they'd go to hapa izakaya and just wait around outside for a while then go in!!! but i thought hapa isn't open for lunch?! have no idea... must find out next time i go there! tho i dunno, if they're not there for lunch, i've never seen them when i went in for dinner, so they probably don't work there either! then what the hell were they doing there at noon anywayz?! *confused*   chicco's got the new tokyo walker mag with Teru on cover and it's got a special report on the upcoming Glay Expo. so i was reading it, and i finally realized why i love men in suits sooo much!!! it all started with Glay!!! remembering back the time when i first fell in love with them, and it was&nbsp;cuz they look sooo damn good in suits even tho they're a rock band!!! and now i'm sooo addicted to nice men in suits or trench coats... haha (^O^)

      ......and one day passed away just like that, fooling around... hahah (^O^);;;   woke up too late. so didn't get to do job hunting again. haha am really slacking off these days. went out for lunch and was in kerridale again. tho i took a long time in reading these twn mags while i was eating lunch that by the time i finished all i was gonna do in kerrisdale it was 2pm! and i wanted to see passions! it's sooo exciting these days so i went back home just to watch the soaps... (^O^);;;   as to why it took me so long in reading those twn mags? well, it had an interview on this actor i like. apparently the guy loves going to clubs to pick up girls and having one nite stands with them while he already has a hot&nbsp;gf!!! (O__O);;; was sooo shocked to know that about him. he said he has no morals when it comes to love and sex. as long as two ppl are not yet committed to each other in marriage, it's ok to have one nite stands with other ppl. jeeeeeez. what kinda logic is that?!?? i dunno, i guess in some ways it's true and i kinda agree too. but still, no, i think my conscience would dictate that once ur in a relationship (even tho not marriage) u should not have sex with other ppl! and i really wonder, does that actor let his gf go around sleeping with others&nbsp;as well?!? so he sleeps around himself, but i really wanna know if he'd still be ok if his gf does the same thing!   anywayz, apparently that guy used to be very very fat when he was young and so he had absolutely no luck in love. i guess that's why once he slimmed down and became all handsome he decided to be a player to go sleep around so he can make up for all the lost times?!? and apparently he calls himself "sex machine" and he and his buddies use a handle "suck my dick" to pick up girls at the club. eeeeeeh, i think that handle is quite lame... anywayz, was just sooo shocked to find out that he's like that. now my image of him totally changed. he said that since he's an actor and everything it's easy for him to pick up girls at the clubs cuz everyone can recognize him. hmm... yah all the fame that's associated with a celeb, i guess i would wanna sleep with someone like that as well? only if he's gorgeous tho. haha. dunno.. i sound like a groupie. but yah i guess i am... if there's a chance to do that i'd really jump on to it!!! (^O^) i have weird logic myself as well.   went to richmond to first pick up my sunglasses. can't believe i just left them in sami's car the other day when we went down to seattle! haha must be way too tired that day when we got back at like 1am so i totally forgot. then i had to go to yaohan to buy veggie.. have like no eggs and veggie in my fridge anymore! aaah! other stuff will just wait till mommy gets here to buy~ wala~ oh and i got these green tea caramel and cookies~~~ hahaha. god i'm such a maccha addict. whenever i see something green tea i'd immediately buy it! (^O^);;;   finally finished doing laundry today, so YAY! and frantically tried to finish doing pedicure/manicure too. tho now it's too late i have no time to paint all the nails... guess i'll have to do that tomorrow afternoon when i get back from interview to watch passions! and i still have to do research on the company... and it's already 11.40pm now... (^O^);;; the interview was booked like 2 weeks ago yet i still wait till the last moment to do research...   oooh yah and i still have to look for my beach mat!!! for tomorrow's fireworks~ damn.. i got this pretty pink rose kitty beach mat 3 summers ago in japan while i went down to fukuoka for the all nite GLAY expo. tho now i dunno where i put them?! have to ask mom.. and wanna ask her to buy comix for me too! yet while today's the day i have stuff to ask her it's just the one day she's not calling!!!

      ah ha.. went to sleep last nite at 2am?! but mom called at 2.30am to see if i'm back home yet and woke me up.. and so i ended up sleeping at 3am i think?! damn for the past week or so i've been having weird sleeping patterns. always sleep around 2-3am!!! i hardly ever sleep at that hr before!!! hope i can change back to my normal sleeping patterns once mom's here.   woke up at 10am. and just been fooling around the whole day. haha.. nah, actually i got a lot done today. did laundry, tho i'm still not totally finished yet. wrote down these restaurant lists for alyson so she can go eat when she goes to tokyo for a few days next month. apparently now i know sooo many of these nice places to eat in tokyo that ppl are all coming to me to ask for them~ *LOL* even my jpn aunt does that. but well, as i was writing down these recommendation lists, i start to miss the good food in tokyo myself... (*__*)   anywayz one funny thing today. was taking a walk in the neighbourhood again in the afternoon and i saw these 2 little girls coming towards me, and one was wearing the licking tongue tee!!! XD~~~ hahahaha. and i was wearing the linkin park tee at the time. so it's really funny, cuz we were walking towards each other, both looking at each other's shirt and smiling... (^O^)/ tho i dunno, the girl seems sooo young!!! probably just around 15?!? so it feels kinda weird wearing the same tee as a 15-yr-old when i'm like 23... haha (^O^);;;

      good thing i slept early at midnite so i could wake up at 8am this morning. went out at 9am and had breakfast with sami at mcdonald's around 10am. so we didn't leave as early as we had planned and ended up arriving at seattle a bit late at 1pm. met up with sami's friend aaliyah. and we all went shopping at bellevue nordstrom.  few days ago when we first decided we'll go down to seattle i had absolutely no idea what i'm gonna buy. just thought i'll go window shopping and if i see stuff i like i'll buy. but it turned out i went crazy and bought all these girly tops that required new bras! so then i figured i could go down to the states to get victoria's secret! haha! i've always wanted to try their stuff~  and so when i had dinner with alyson on fri nite and told her i'm going down to seattle to buy victoria's secret stuff, she said she did the exact same thing!!! hahah! and actually at the time she was wearing their bra too so she showed me and told me to go buy it! haha! she even said she has these victoria's secret catalogues too so when we later on went to her house she tried to find them out to show me. but then since she's packing and everything it's all just a huge mess in her condo and she couldn't find them.. said that she hid those catalogues cuz some of her pervert male students asked her for those... yah, i've heard that all guys love looking at victoria's secret catalogue (^O^);;;  so i finally got the victoria's secret bras and panties~ yay!!! haha~ crazy me! \(^O^)/ it just so happened that currently they're having this "pink collection"!!! such a good timing for a pink freak like me! (^O^) hehe~ so now when i wear these new girly tops i could show the straps of these nice bras. *LOL* but aaah so bad, those cost just over USD $100! so i can't believe i spent about $500 in less than 5 days buying all these new tops and sportswear and now lingerie! (>___  ah the funniest thing. i spent nearly 1 hr there in the victoria's secret shop and about half way thru sami and aaliyah came to the fitting room to find me, wanting to tell me that they'll go somewhere else and we'll catch up later. so they came in the fitting room, and the salesgirls were like "ooh~ r u looking for the girl trying on the sexy bras?" *LOL* and they're both like "hmm... sexy bras?! @_@ just the girl wearing the fcuk tee and who's got a huge bruise on her arm..." and the salesgirls were like, yap that's the one! yah they knew i wanna buy bras but they didn't know it's those supposedly "sexy" bras~ hahaha!!! i dunno why that line-up is called "Very Sexy"... so they're push-up bras with padding, big deal~ doesn't really mean they're sexy! (^O^);;; anywayz i think those are the ones alyson got too~ so yay! hehee~~  oh yah, and while we were in some other shop, this salesgirl saw my huge bruise too and was like "wow! how did u get the bruise?! it looks sooo painful!!!" (^O^);;; yah.. alyson said the same thing too the other day. basically nowadays just whoever's seen me would immediately ask about the bruise! it's getting all the attention! sooo funny!!! let's see, last yr when i got the huge bruise on my elbow from the linkin park concerts, it took 10 days for the bruise to fade away~ so now let's see how long it'll take this time for this bruise to heal! hehee! if it still hasn't faded away before mom comes, she'll be shocked to see that!!! *LOL*  bellevue nordstrom's sooo pretty~ oh! and they've got tully's coffee there! dunno why, when i first walked into the mall and saw that i felt sooo 懐かしい, just a little bit sentimental.. cuz there's one tully's coffee shop at meguro station and i had breakfast there almost every day when i was in japan last yr. i love their coffee and food~ (*o*) anywayz, there's this arts & crafts convention there outside the bellevue nordstrom mall too so we went to take a look. quite interesting~ saw some nice stuff tho can't afford, and well, no use anywayz... tho i did see this cutest little doggie painting with the words "Coffee Dog". sooo suitable for shannon and her lovely puppy coffee!!! aaah~~ tho damn, the small drawing costs like $40 so i hesitated.. i dunno.. the bras i bought each cost around that price too yet i bought them. but then i've been spending WAY too much money these days i really just can't afford to buy anymore stuff! (>___  went to downtown seattle afterwards. while we were walking around at one point these black men greeted us. we ignored them and kept walking and they went like "aaaw~~". later we started talking about it. sami was like there were these black men hitting on girls in roppongi clubs. yah... there were always these huge black men hitting on girls in harajuku too! sooo scary! and it's actually not flattering at all cuz they're all pretty ugly!!! (>___  well, so we stayed at pretty pacific place. wow, the malls in seattle are all sooo pretty!!! (*O*) not fair~ how come the ones in van are so dull looking?! come to think of it, i haven't been down in the states in 3 yrs!!! last time i went was in spring 2001 for disney world in florida! i haven't been down to seattle in more than 5 yrs i think?!? last time i went was around grade 10-11?! cuz i did remember very clearly i got this ck bag in bon marche...  had dinner at this nice italian restaurant called "il fornaio" inside pacific place. finally tried the famous angel hair pasta~ it really is quite good!!! (^O^) tho damn i think cuz today i didn't have anything to eat since 10am until dinner so now that i got home i'm getting kinda hungry somehow...  went to watch "i, robot" after dinner. i didn't really wanna see the movie cuz i don't like those sci-fi action films. maybe cuz i think it's too unrealistic?! but well, either one of us has seen the other movies showing at that theatre and that's the only one all of us haven't seen, so we ended up watching that one. there's just no other choice. then partly cuz i had really no interest in watching that movie and also partly cuz i was too tired, after seeing the trailers i just fell asleep... slept thru the beginning of the movie for like half an hr i think?! then woke up to wach the rest (^O^);;; it's an ok film i guess. the story's got a huge twist so that part's interesting~  yah, since we went to watch the movie from 8-10pm, we didn't leave seattle till 10.30pm! haha... ended up arriving back at van around 1am. sooo tired now my head's all dizzy. it's ok, i'll just slack off again tomorrow~ sleeping in and doing laundry~ and i have to re-do my manicure/pedicure... stupid toes got stepped on a lot at the hoobastank concert so the nail colours are all coming off! it's gonna be another busy week just doing random miscellaneous stuff before mom comes. and aaah i have to finish writing the summer greeting cards and send out debby's bday present before the end of the week!!!

      had a mini elementary reunion this morning at kerrisdale starbucks cuz jessica's back in town for a short 1-week vacation. and since she's leaving the next day she wanted to have the reunion at 9.30am (@__@) so she could spend the rest of the day with her family before she leaves. the funniest thing tho was that johnny overslept and didn't show up at all, while he was the one who had wanted to see jessica sooo much after some 13 yrs! (^O^);;; so it was only jessica, ellen and me.  i haven't seen jessica in like 10 yrs i think?! met when i first came here, but then afterwards we lost touch. still would hear her news tho since mom's old colleague knew jessica too with her daughter also in the same high school. but then again i didn't know ellen that well either even tho both of us were at ubc for the past 4 yrs. had english together in the first yr but then after that we lost touch too.  it's not so much like i don't wanna keep in touch with them. i mean, at reunions, we'd still all chat and everything and it was quite a lot of fun catching up. but since we're all grown up now and each having our own circle of friends, it's not that easy to get close anymore. still, i guess this way is nicer too, just catch up once in a long while, instead of meeting up so often with nothing much new to discuss.  jess said she might get another break around sept/oct to go back to taiwan. mom actually just booked the plane tickets and we're going back in mid-sept (unless i can find a job here before then...) so yah, if we both get to be in taiwan around the same time, i hope we'll host a reunion! it's sooo fun! haha~ tho damn, the opera tickets actually went on sale today and i had sooo wanted to go!!! now that i dun even know if/when i'd be coming back to van, i can't buy the tix!!! so now no operas for me~~~ aaah!!! (>____  mom asked godmom to come to van around late afternoon to take her to see the fireworks. can't believe she doesn't know about the fireworks after being here for yrs! god! so ppl who live in surrey/delta really know nothing about the fireworks?!?? (@__@);;; is unbelievable... they've all been here for 10 yrs!!! how can u not know?!??  anywayz, so mom also wanted to take her to go eat at "shiru-bay". godmom's family's the kind who only eats at those all u can eat places when they say they're going to eat japanese food. this morning had a similar chat too during reunion. jess and ellen apparently just eat at these all u can eat places too for japanese food.  but to me, that's not japanese food at all!!! not even slightly authentic! (>__  had a quite unpleasant chat during dinner there. i was telling both of them about the manager and his family owning this izakaya empire in tokyo. but there were 2 guys there that nite, one is the manager guy with chin ring, the other one is a cute mixed guy. i'm not sure if he's mixed or not, but he looks very much like asian. and because of that, my mom and godmom had a hard time figuring out who the manager guy is... cuz to them, both guys look the same and they couldn't really tell the other guy is mixed.  i finally tried to distinguish the two guys by telling them the manager is the one with spiky hair and a lot of rings and stuff. and godmom immediately went like "aaargh that's so bad, so bad". i was like no, that's really cool. good thing my mom has a slightly more open mind cuz she agreed that since the restaurant is pretty hip and trendy, it quite suits the image that the owner would look like that!  but then godmom started to keep dissing the guy saying things like guys like that, with a lot of rings on their bodies and tattoos and whatsoever are bad... and blah blah blah. and i started to sorta argue with her saying how i love guys like that cuz they are sooo cool. and somehow i blurted out i wanna get tattoos and stuff. and godmom was like "nono, that's not good that's not good"  (who the fuck cares how u think anywayz?!??)  mom was really surprised too so she tried declaring to godmom that it's the first time she's ever heard me say i wanna get tattoos. now why would i go tell u things like that when i know u wouldn't understand?!??  and it just got kinda ugly. cuz godmom kept dissing about it and since i've never liked her and well i like to shock ppl and i especially like to defy ppl, i'd keep saying how nice i think tattoos are. rite after the topic ended, mom left to go to the ladies room so i was left there alone with godmom. and immediately she asked me why i like tattoos. seriously, u don't have to have a reason when u like something!!!!!! u just like it!!!!!! not that i'd expect someone so old-fashioned and conservative to understand something like that tho...  and besides, aren't i allowed to have my own thoughts?!?? so u think tattoos and rings are "bad", fine, ur entitled to ur own opinions. but don't try to change mine by keep telling me that they're bad!!! we're all individuals capable of thinking on our own, and i'm an adult having my own reasons and can figure out perfectly what's "good" and what's "bad" on my own!!! i'm not really some 5-yr-old as u all think i am!!! jeeeeez!!!  i sooo wish she's not my godmom and would just remain as an auntie. now that the whole thing's done already, u can't undo it anymore!!! i mean, now that i'm calling her "godmom", i can't just go back to calling her "auntie" all of a sudden one day rite?! (>____  i really appreciate her friendship with my mom over the yrs, but i just don't like her!!! i don't like her whole family!!! they are nice ppl, i do know that, but something about their personalities just fucking bug the hell outta me!!! (>_____  oh yah, and she's kinda frugal / cheap too. they've never treated my family to nice restaurants while we always do that to them! i've never got nice stuff from her either. so yah, i'm materialistic, but that's also cuz i've seen some other ppl having really nice godmoms!!! aaargh!!! (>___  anywayz so went to watch the fireworks finale. sooo many ppl there today! and sooo many boats in false creek!!! can't believe sweden won tho! they suck!!! their show was sooo boring!!! (>____  whew. quite a tiring day since i had to wake up so early on a saturday for the reunion. and then had to walk around half of downtown for the fireworks. but eeeh, summer should be like this~ cuz very soon it's all gonna end...

       Covert bloggers enjoy a secret life    George Clooney has an online diary -- or not. No one knows for sure.    If you didn't know George Clooney keeps a secret online diary, don't feel bad. Until last week, neither did he.  An Internet journal said to belong to a famous actor has spawned a feeding frenzy of  wannabe detectives determined to "out" him . The mysterious diarist -- rumoured to be anyone from Clooney to Owen Wilson -- claims to value his anonymity, but takes every opportunity to fuel the guessing game about his identity.  Rance, as he calls himself, is just one of a growing number of  covert bloggers in cyberspace. Some are ordinary people pretending to be celebrities, some are celebrities pretending to be ordinary people .   The fun is in deciphering who's who .  "I am personally aware of a couple of minor celebrities who have blogs," says Robert Runte, a University of Lethbridge sociologist. " But because they wanted to do it without their fans drooling over their every word, they picked pseudonyms to write under ."  Last week, Howard Stern got in on the action when he made an offhand remark about keeping a secret blog. The American radio shock jock said he writes "as another character" and that only a handful of people know he's writing it.  Stern's comment sparked an immediate reaction on the Net that included numerous comparisons to Rance.  "Celebrities can project a character through their blog which seems immensely personal and intimate but is, of course, still a projection," Runte says. "It's not that much different than having a fan club, except  the fans feel they're more personally connected to the celebrity ."   If, that is, they can determine exactly whose blog they've been reading and whether or not it's part of a scheme .  "There's an inherent contradiction in keeping a secret blog in that it's a public presence that can be read by anybody," says Runte. "If someone says 'I'm a celebrity but I'm not going to tell you who I am,' I'm inclined to suspect the information is not credible and it's part of a marketing campaign."  Publicists of Clooney and Wilson recently denied their clients are behind the infamous Rance blog. And Melanie Nash, a noted expert on celebrity fandom, believes Rance isn't an actor at all.  But the fact so many people are attracted to reading and discussing secret blogs has her intrigued.  " The thrill of the chase, collecting clues, attempting to 'really know for sure' seems key ," Nash says. " Yes, many would probably suspect they're being had, but at the same time, there is the thrill of 'what if?' or even of detecting the fraud ."  The case for the existence of secret celebrity blogs is bolstered, however, by the fact so many stars maintain a web presence. Since everyone from Avril Lavigne to Anna Kournikova has a personal blog, the subversive -- and undoubtedly hip -- move is to operate in the shadows.   By giving people the impression they're on the inside track, Nash says the blog's effect on people is multiplied . This is similar to what happened during last year's invasion of Iraq, when an anonymous Baghdad blogger became so influential a news source that  The Times of London  dubbed the conflict the world's first hyperlink war.  "Blogging seems to be the Internet fashion du jour," says Paul Budra, an associate professor and pop culture expert at Simon Fraser University. "Everyone's going to jump on the bandwagon for the next years or two, then it'll fall by the wayside."  While people's collective desire to masquerade as someone else -- be it a celebrity or an ordinary person -- is of some academic interest, he thinks covert blogging represents something else.  "It's a publicity stunt," Budra says. "If you really wanted the anonymity, you wouldn't announce that you have a blog."  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  an article i read in van sun back in may. since i had a similar experience i find the article very interesting, in fact, sooo interesting that i cut it down to save it. (^O^);;;  i know the idea of "what if" seems really strong, just cuz practically everyone nowadays has internet access. and that's why the idea of celebs also blogging or a few yrs ago chatting in internet chatrooms seem quite possible. apparently it's said that celebs, whether rock stars or movie actors, would get bored sometimes during their rehearsal / film breaks, that they'd kill the time by coming online.  in the last month or so, it's reported that a lot of celebs in taiwan have signed up as members in these popular websites designed for making friends. the general idea would be that being in the show biz, it must be easy to meet new ppl and make friends. but the ones who were interviewed (and they are quite popular and famous there) said that's not that true at all since it's hard to make real friends in show biz, and that's why they resort to making friends online.  i have to disagree with the article tho, that's it's no fun in deciphering the covert celeb, absolutely no fun at all in trying to be a detective. yah, sure, so u'll always be wondering "what if... he really is the one?" but more so than that, the idea that he's just a fraud and it's all a scheme will forever loom deep in ur mind, which prevents u from completely trusting him... and in the end destroys the relationship.  anyhow, i think the article was what triggered me into wanting to keep a blog again~ why exactly tho, i don't really know...... (^O^);;;

      I hear the lonely words　初めて見せた貴女の 痩せてしまったその笑顔に　頬を寄せた   無限のこの宇宙で　 出逢う奇跡の様な… 大切なぬくもりが今　この腕を離れてゆく   揺れる陽射しに照らされ　歩いてた道 切なさに満ちた心　そっと包んでくれた  愛の言葉が足りないかわりに　歌えば それだけで　二人ひとつになれた気がしていた    I remember those days　おやすみ　愛しい貴女よ  傷つける事でしか愛せないままで　やがて別れた   『誰もが生きる事の痛みを抱きしめて　生きてゆくなら 　教えてくれ　俺はこれから何を　失ってゆくのか…』    ただ夜が明ける事を　祈っていた日々 悲しみに沈む夜も　 貴女が変えてくれた  恋と呼ぶには短い　あの夏の夢 別々の道を選んだ　貴女を忘れない   AH　夢に乗り込んで　すべてをかなえるその日までは AH　歩き続けてゆく　どこまでも　果てしなく  ただ夜が明ける事を　祈っていた日々 悲しみに沈む夜も　 貴女が変えてくれた  恋と呼ぶには短い　あの夏の夢 別々の道を選んだ　貴女を忘れない    ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥   I hear the lonely words　將我的臉頰挨近 你那第一次讓我看見　已然消瘦了的笑臉   在這無限的宇宙中　仿彿奇跡似的相逢… 那份重要的溫暖　如今正從這手腕中離去   步行在這條被搖曳的日光照射著的道路上 將原本充滿著苦悶的心　悄悄地隱藏起來  愛的言語是不夠的　如果用歌唱代替的話 光只是那樣　就會覺得兩人已合而為一了    I remember those days　再見了　我深愛著的你  不彼此傷害的話就無法相愛　　終究還是分手了   「如果每個人都將緊抱著生存的痛苦而活下去的話 有誰能夠告訴我　我今後還將會失去些什麼呢…」   那些只是不斷在祈求著天亮的日子 沉浸在悲傷的夜晚　是你改變了我  要把它稱為戀愛還太短暫了的　那段夏日夢想 即使已選擇了各自的前程　我還是不會忘了你   AH　承坐著夢想　　 直到一切都能實現的那天為止 AH　即使永無止境　直到最後都仍將持續地走下去  那些只是不斷在祈求著天亮的日子 沉浸在悲傷的夜晚　是你改變了我  要把它稱為戀愛還太短暫了的　那段夏日夢想 即使已選擇了各自的前程　我還是不會忘了你      I remember those days — Good-bye My Dear  That summer dream — too short to call it love Though we chose different paths — I'll never forget you 　　 "If everyone lives by hugging the pains of life, Then tell me, what am I going to lose after this..."   got the fan club mail the other day. exclusive membership pre-order Expo goods sheet. i was just saying the other day how i may end up buying everything if i could go to the Expo this time just cuz it's full of those lovely pirate mascots. and hmm, it turned out i'd have to spend a total of JPY $19000 for 7 items including 2 t-shirts, pamphlet, poster, wristband, cellphone strap, and sticker. (O___O);;;  now i dunno what to do. i really, really, *really* like their concert goods this time!!! sooo goddamn cute!!! (>o  i still have up to early sept to decide, but i think the chances aren't that good... (>__  i'm 23 now. apparently it's quite fascinating for others to see i'm still this obsessed with Glay. they all assume my fanaticism would fade out within 3 yrs or less. just cuz it's not that normal for some mid-20-yr-olds to be still this crazy about some band.  over the past yr i have realized it's about time for me to not see Glay as my whole life. and really, ever since the start of the yr i haven't thought about them as much as i used to! like for the 3 singles they've released this yr, i haven't even bought a single one of them yet!!! it used to be that i'd pre-order the singles and get them immediately when they're out!!! so i *have* really changed!!!  it's only these last few days with Glay Expo and whatnot that i've started to think more about them again. and now i have 2 decisions related to them to make within this month... aiyaiyai~  even tho most ppl in my life see me as this crazy little girl who chases after some band, and it sounds kinda pathetic in words to say that my life evolves around them, i have to say tho that the past 6 yrs have been the best times in my life (well, so far...). it's really quite fascinating to devote all ur energy and attention to one particular band. it really made life exciting. and that's what my life lacks now that i'm not so into them anymore, so that's kinda sad. and that's why when i think back on the past 6 yrs with Glay, i have absolutely no regret, since i truly treasure the fact that i had an icon during those times to focus my efforts.  maybe that's why, now that i'm trying to move on without them, i suddenly feel like there's a void in my life and i feel kinda passion-less...

      doing manicure (^--^) haha.. is sorta like a bad habit, cuz who the hell do their nails at midnite anywayz? but i always do this. probably been painting nails at midnite for like several yrs now~ dunno why, i just find this a good time to do manicure. i really do have weird logic (^O^);;  nothing too exciting these past 2 days. just back to job hunting. had a look over my blog the other day and i realized it started out so gloomy. haha. and those first few entries i posted saying my job hunting was on hold, even at that time, i didn't really stop job hunting! i still kept sending out applications! yet these last 2 weeks i really just slacked off cuz i didn't send out anything~ (^O^);;;  so, probably gonna be doing the same thing tomorrow daytime too, just send out more applications, in order to make up for the past 2 weeks lack of effort. and so far has nothing planned yet for the weekend. somehow friends all have got their parents visiting here these days so they're all really busy too. aaaaai~~~ but i wanna see movies!!! wonder when they'll be free to go catch some flicks with me...  anywayz, mom brought these twn newspapers job ads here for me to look at. and she's suggesting that i go back with her in mid-sept and then just stay there for couple months to try doing job hunting there as well. i had thought about going back with her in mid-sept before she came, cuz father kept asking when i'd go back to see him... so i thought i might as well just accompany her back. but i thought it'll just be another short visit. not like what she's suggesting now, to stay till maybe like the end of the yr and look for jobs there...  saw on those job ads of some big-name multinational companies like mckinsey (my dream company...), fujitsu, 20th century fox, disney, pepsico, sanrio, siemens, etc etc... *sigh* it's sooo goddamn complicated. i know it may be good for my future to go back to taiwan, just cuz it may be easier for me to find a job there seeing how i can better utilize my english / chinese / japanese there. here in van, even tho employers are all pretty impressed with my abilities, i find that i can't really fully apply the linguistic abilities here.  and other than that, van really is just too small. sure there are some global companies here, but not a lot. the ones i just said all don't have branches here. most management consulting firms all don't. taipei sure has a lot more multinational companies and the opportunities are just more there, seeing how it's a way bigger metropolitan city than van...  i know those things all along. but i just really don't like to go back to live in taiwan!!! (>___  i finally realized i'm already sooo accustomed to the lifestyle here. a big part of it is that i love the music and the tv shows here. i don't like chinese music cuz no rock.. and i don't like the popular teen dramas or talk shows there so i hardly watch chinese tv. i hate public washrooms in taiwan. and hmm maybe other things i'd be ok with.. well but those are really the most important things already.  and the biggest thing that's holding me back is the thought of living under the same roof with my father. short visits i'm ok, but with him, anything pass 2 weeks it'd drive me crazy. and if i really move back to work and live there, i'd have to face him every single day when i go home after work while i have nothing to say to him!  and the worst thing is, i'll lose my freedom. here in van, even when mom was here with me for all the yrs before, as long as she knew who i'm out with and to where, she'd be ok with me staying out late past midnite. it's a whole different story if i were to go back to live with father. i can't stay out on my own with friends at nite till past 9pm. so if i really start working in taiwan, i'll just never get to enjoy the nite life there at all and i'd be sitting at home with nothing i like to watch on tv! what kinda life would that be?  i know how every other relative and even my mom say i'm an irresponsible coward. i keep using his money yet i hide here in van to enjoy life and don't go back to face my obligations. it's like when u take something u should give something back. but no, i just take it and give nothing. sometimes i think of myself as this runaway fugitive... and i'm really just destined to keep running away forever, cuz i just know that if i go back to face him, my whole life will be ruined, and i'll just end up like him.  so it's just really really ironic and complicated. for the good of my future, i should go back cuz there're more opportunities there and i can find a job easier. yet if i really go back, my whole future would end up being destroyed by father.  it's just really pathetic. but i think i have to go back in mid-sept with mom and try job hunting there. just cuz i've been doing that for 4 months here now and i still haven't got a job. so if from now on till mid-sept the situation is still not changed, i will have to go back. hmm.. unless something happens with father and there's sudden change of plans.  mom's going to hk with auntie chie in early oct and i sooo want to tag along. i've never been to hk before, not even by transfer, even tho it's so close to taiwan. and then mom wanna go to australia too afterwards and wanna take me along. tho we're still thinking of ways to ask father... i don't really think the chances of him letting me go play are that big, but eeh with him it's hard to say.  so yah, rite now, from what i can see, the months ahead are just like a big fog... very unclear. i may be going to hk and australia. i may end up staying in taiwan for job hunting. as for my future and the consequence of me moving back to taiwan, i guess rite now i just can't think about that so much anymore, and just let fate have its way, see where it'll all lead. they all say i can't run away forever, and i guess in some way that is true. there's just no way u can ever run away from ur destiny......

      finally it rained a bit today. think it hasn't rained at all so far in the whole summer?! forecast predicts that it's gonna rain for the rest of the week or something tho (>__  had an interview at this other employment agency today. maybe it's cuz they're smaller or something so they're a lot nicer? even tho the client companies of hunt and angus one are usually very big and well-known, they are way too big and too many ppl register with them so they're not that friendly and are always sooo freaking slow!!! (>__  did 3 computer tests there and i got them all 90-100%. (^O^)v and my typing speed was 82 wpm today! there were 2 front desk clerks at the time and both were quite amazed i did so well. hmm yah when hunt hooked me up with a company before and i went in for interview, the lady there told me i did really well on the tests, but i didn't know exactly how well i did for the tests at hunt. but well, now i suppose i probably got about the same scores?! still, even tho i did that well on the tests, i didn't get picked!!! aaaargh~!!! (>___  went to aerobics today, after this 10-day break. haha~ am gonna try to keep it up for the rest of the month tho! hmm, looked into my schedule book and realized i wrote down something related to the aerobics last week when i was at the cafe in kerrisdale.   今日カフェでスケジュールを見ながら、ある驚くべき事実を発現した。確かにカレに出会ってからエアロビクスをするのが好きになっちゃったの。ギャ～でもどうしよう～ これどーゆー意味なの？  but then i started thinking more about this whole thing again today while i was going to the kerrisdale community centre, and i realized that's not true at all. i thought it's cuz i started to like some guy and so i got all hooked on to working out. but then he turned out to be a major jerk and i realized i didn't like him that much anywayz to begin with. it's all good tho, cuz i haven't really put in my feelings yet.  my mom was sooo curious as to how i'm suddenly so into doing aerobics. and to tell the truth, when i thought at first it's cuz i may be starting to like this guy, it freaked me out a bit too. but no, now that i think about it, it's really just becuz i've been thinking a lot lately of this same time last yr when i was in japan.  i thought about the times i'd spend walking along meguro river in the afternoon, and also about the fact that i'd walk at least 1hr everyday up and down all these hills... since i lived on the meguro hills and the school was on shibuya cherry blossom hills. no wonder i lost quite some weight there even tho i had a lot of japanese yummy food!!!  so that's why i've been going for walks on the mckenzie heights and to aerobics!!! oh, it's also cuz seeing how pretty the summer here is, i don't wanna sit at home all day long in front of the stupid pc. wanna go out more to enjoy the sunshine~!!! haha! so yay! i finally figured myself out~ (^O^)/

       urlLink     saw the report on Glay Expo in the newspapers today and also went to search online. seems like such a freaking awesome live... but then again, i'd known that already anywayz seeing how it's Expo afterall and not just some normal live show.  remembered that before the concert i went to check on the website and there's a warning about the approaching typhoon. i found it quite funny cuz everytime there's Expo, there's always a typhoon!!! (^O^);;; but Glay Magic's sooo strong all typhoons are no match for my lovely sunny boys~ \(^O^)/ cuz apparently rite before the start of Expo and rite after it ended, it rained for a bit. yet there was absolutely no rain at all during the whole 3hr live!!! now see, that's the proof of Glay Magic!!! hahaha~  they apparently tried a lot of cool stunts this time. Teru even did the bungee jumping! off this 40 metre high stage to start off the show!!! HOLY!!! (*O*) even got on the helicopter to sing at one point.. also the stage turned into a giant pirate ship! wow!!! いいなぁ～見たい！  and it said that they started off with the song 誘惑... they hardly ever started a live with that song so i was a bit surprised!!! cuz i would like to see them do that since it's one of my fave songs!!! just cuz that's the first single i heard after i started liking them and knew who they were! actually [Beloved] was the song i first heard, but at the time, i didn't know the band. well, but 誘惑 i like it sooo much cuz of the super tempting video and the rockish tune and Teru's super seductive voice all coupled by the sexual lyrics!!! XD~~~ have a thing for erotic rock songs... *LOL*  what absolutely knocked me out tho was the fact that Teru took off his shirt for the 2nd half of the show!!! AAAAAAH~~~!!!!!!!! (*O*) I WANNA SEE *THAT*!!!!!! TOPLESS TERU~~~ tried searching on the net for the pic but to no avail. fortunately the newspapers printed it out so i've got a real pic here in front of me... but i'm too lazy to go scan it. maybe i should go laminate it tho so the pic won't fade in time? and then i can just drool away staring at the pic... *GRIN*  it's actually kinda weird. as the years go by they start to wear less and less! only 2 yrs ago u wouldn't find them wearing sleeveless shirts. they'd just always wear tshirts or suits. but by last yr they started to all wear sleeveless and showing off all the nice arms!!! and what, now they're gonna go all topless?!?!?? i dunno, i guess it may be sorta due to the fact that they're all in their 30s now so they feel comfortable enough getting rid of the "idols" title? not that i ever consider them to be those, but just becuz they've all got pretty faces it's easy for the media to label them as such.  i do hope they keep the topless act going tho... cuz my biggest wish now is to go see them again in a live show and Teru better go topless!!!!!!! last summer i had just hope i'd see him sleeveless, but now seeing this, i'm becoming more greedy~~~ HAHAHA crazy me. all that flesh is just an added-on bonus... and i'm apparently somewhat muscle-obsessed.. (^O^);;;  after reading the article i was wondering what they're gonna do for the rest of the yr. thought maybe they'd finally go international or something and hopefully they can come to van too to perform at commodore like B'z did last yr! but then i realized they're gonna do an arena tour from oct to nov. now i wanna go to that!!! Expo is always fun, but it's too damn big!!! 100000 ppl!! i know i've said that i wish i could've gone to the Expo this yr, but frankly, i just know that even if that could've happened, i would never be near the stage!!! then i'd still have to see Teru topless on the screen and not close! so yah, arenas are not small, but compared to Expo, they're small enough...  maybe i have to wait another 5 yrs, until it's their 15th anniversary since debut, for them to do a north american tour and to perform here in commodore? cuz B'z did that for their debut celebration of 15 yrs. if they go do an asia tour, since they're pretty popular in taiwan too, they wouldn't do it in a small place either! so yah! come do one here! cuz here they'd go for small live house!!! i wanna see them again in a small club!!! that's the best experience yet!!!  have to wait till the end of sept for the fan club newsletter to read the complete report on Expo and see more pix. aah, and it's gonna be my last fan club newsletter. i decided sometime last yr while i was in japan that i'm not gonna be in their fan club anymore. since i'm not in japan anywayz it's not that useful to be in the fan club cuz i can't really use all the benefits. tho now i'm having a slight change of heart again. after seeing how awesome the Glay Expo was this yr... and seeing how really, without Glay, my life has absolutely no passion, i kinda wanna keep being in it? i dunno. i think i have to pay the membership fee before the end of the month... have been in it for exactly 6 yrs now. will have to decide whether or not i'm gonna continue the membership...  あ～やっぱり行きたかったんだなぁ～ *sigh* i guess i do feel a bit regret that i couldn't have gone to the Glay Expo this yr, especially when it's the celebration of their 10th anniversary since debut...... i wonder when will i get to see them again? probably not within the next 2 yrs... cuz apparently i go to japan every 2 yrs... since i always use sooo much money when i go over there, i don't have the heart to keep asking my mom to let me go... so well, i'll be patient and just wait then... wait for the day i'll be able to see Glay up close and personal again in live......

       睡在豌豆上的公主    「你聽過一個童話故事，書名是 『睡在豌豆上的公主』 嗎？」  這是我慣用的開場白。 看著他一臉茫然的樣子，我心中快速地閃過一絲罪惡感。 但是，我仍然用深情、無奈的眼光繼續注視著他，接著，我會將故事內容向他娓娓到來……  「從前有個王子，一心想要娶個真正的公主。 於是他遊歷全世界，去尋訪一個真正的公主。 他見過了很多很多的公主，可是都無法確定他們是不是真正的公主。 直到有一天晚上，風雨交加，有位自稱是公主的小姑娘站在門外。 天啊！她被雨淋得像是一隻落湯雞一樣，可是她堅持說，她是個真正的公主。」  我會在這裡暫停一下，表現出似乎不知不覺中已進入了沉思的樣子。 通常，對方會在這個時候輕聲地問：「然後呢？」  「嗯…… 老王后想了一個好法子。 她走進客房，掀開了所有的床單，放了一粒豌豆在床上。 接著，她拿了二十張床墊，把它們放在豌豆上面。 之後，她又拿了二十床羽毛被單，舖在那二十張床墊上面。 這就是今晚公主過夜的地方。」  「隔天早上，老王后問她：『昨晚睡得可好？』  『喔，難受極了！』 公主說：『幾乎整晚都睡不著。 天知道有什麼東西在我的床上，躺在這個硬東西上面，弄得我全身痠痛，真是糟糕透頂。』  於是他們全都明白，這是一個貨真價實的公主，就只有嬌生慣養的公主才能這麼敏感。」  我繼續深情地望向對方，接著說：「你是一個很好的人，是我心目中的王子。 在我最需要的時候，你也像那位遊遍全世界的王子一般，為我開了大門。 但是，我們間的相處，卻總是有一些問題，就好像是那一粒小豌豆…… 這不是誰的錯，也許是我的嬌生慣養，使我沒有辦法再和你繼續交往下去，因為我對感情的要求實在太高了……」  從來沒有人追問我這個故事的結局。 一個個在我這一套標準說辭下分手的男友們，都懷著歉疚且深情的眼神向我道別，謝謝我曾帶給他們珍貴的回憶，並祝福我有個舒適的夜晚。 我表現得有如公主一般，高貴地與他們款款細訴、道別著……  他們是如此地不捨與無奈，在隱隱含淚的眼神中向逝去的感情道別，彷彿仍沉浸在我為他們編織的角色中，就像是尚未能圓夢的悲情王子一般！  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  haha~ read this in the newspapers the other day. thought it's an absolutely skillful way to break up with someone. hehe, so gonna save it for future use, IF i'm ever gonna need it... (^--^);;;  on a slightly similar and related note, i finally uninstalled icq and removed the other msn account i signed up for net-friends. it's actually been like 2 weeks since i said i'm gonna do that.. just got too busy playing around and stuff so i haven't been able to do so. finally got the chance to chill this weekend so last nite i did all of that.  something about now u can't un-register ur icq # anymore from the icq main database. u can only erase ur info, but the # is still kept there... cuz they hope that one day u may still return and if so u can go back to using the old #.  and actually i can't remove the other msn account! (>__  there's that slight sense of irony in all of this. just cuz it's exactly 6 yrs since i've started using instant messengers and fell in love with him. it was a beautiful summer too. but now that i've finally figured out the truth and am more than ready to move on, i want to erase everything that's gonna even slightly remind me of him.  ainsi, au revoir~

      finally finished all my newspapers reading today! \(^O^)/ tho damn.. i didn't read them on time so i didn't know.. last wed van sun published a complete guide for all the orcas in the city!!! (>__  ooh ooh! gonna go to davie st to check out the new bus shelters too!!! newspapers said the city just put the new ones there and they're all hot pink!!! (*O*) wow!!! yah.. i'm gonna have to go take pix of the pink bus shelters too then~ hahaha!!! really suits the theme there too tho, for the gay st *grin* and so we were also reading about the van pride parade yesterday and i was like "aah, actually i had wanted to go..." and to my surprise my mom said "hell yah!!! we should've gone!!! i wanna see that too!!!" *LOL* totally didn't think she'd be interested in the gay parade!!! she said she wanna see it cuz well it's special and u don't get to see that all the time... haha, funny weird mom (^O^);;;  so i took her to "shiru-bay" tonite. tried the "zen cocktail" = green tea + vodka. u can hardly taste the alcohol tho (or it's just that i'm used to liquor so i find it too lite? ^O^;;;) so it's basically just like maccha. mom loves the place too (^O^)v haha~ i realized there tonite looking more carefully at the place, they have all these naked women pix!!! *LOL* brings a certain flair and trendiness to the place i guess~ hehe.  went to walk around yaletown and false creek after dinner. and GOD... i wanna live in yaletown!!!!!! it's such a lovely neighbourhood!!! has got everything. and the nice walk along the water... absolutely beautiful. mom and i were both sooo amazed... *sigh* so, my biggest dream so far, well at least for the next 5-10 yrs anywayz, is to be able to make a living that'll allow me to live as a white-collar single noble in trendy yaletown!!! (>o  came home at around 9pm and noticed that johnny had called me on cell. thought he was gonna ask about when to meet up with jessica and stuff, but instead he said he wanted to ask me where's "shiru-bay"! *LOL* very funny considering i was just there! he said he had wanted to go there tonite but couldn't find the place so went somewhere else instead. (^O^);;; sorry i missed the call! or else we could've met up at the place!  anywayz, there're so many movies i wanna watch this month! had wanted to see "the village" when it came on last fri, but then mom came that day and sami's busy too, so dunno yet when we're gonna go see it. it's the #1 movie this past weekend! wow! and i'm glad to find out from reading the newspapers that it's shown at tinseltown as well! hate that place's location, but love the seats there~ and well it's close to yaletown too, so yay! could go to "shiru-bay" again! (^O^)  then there's tom cruise's "collateral" this fri. and i just found out that colin farrell's new movie's also gonna show that day! something "at the end of the world"...?! but i'm confused tho. apparently that's the movie he's gonna have a nude scene! yet it's only rated as pg-13! so the director really cut off all the nude scenes?!?? (>__  lalala~ seems like it's gonna be another busy lovely month!!! \(^O^)/

      been going out with mom yesterday and today and also reading newspapers. finally finished like almost 2 weeks worth of newspapers! tho i still have 3 weekend van sun to read tomorrow... (^O^);;; she's like how can u not read the newspapers for sooo long and just keep piling them up? it takes only about 1 hr everyday to read it! true... but i guess for the past 2 weeks i went a bit crazy going out to play and then coming back to blog everything down so i used that hr i was supposed to read newspapers online instead... tho now that she's back and i'm trying to change my schedules back to normal again, it'll mean that i won't come online for that long anymore~ it's better this way, cuz i want to enjoy summer in van as much as possible seeing how i miss it here~ haha.  a very funny thing. while i was reading all the newspapers i realized somewhere on the table i had cut off this article before. and it's a review on that new izakaya "shiru-bay"!!! (^O^) i had already read about it in the newspapers like 3 weeks ago and thought it's quite interesting so i cut the article down! yet i totally didn't know before when alyson took me there that that was the one!!! hahaha!!! sooo surprised~  and the funnier thing was, on the article, there's a picture of that cute waiter!!! (*O*) the one with the chin ring!!! sooo easily recognizable~ apparently he's not the waiter, but the manager-chef!!! wow!!! i thought he's a waiter cuz he was running around all over the place carrying plates and talking to the customers! gonna take mom there tomorrow~ i told her about them hiring waitresses now, and of course she's like "u should go~!!!" she's been telling me to go try waitressing for a while now just cuz i'm quite spoiled and has never done that kinda stressful job before... (^O^);;;  anywayz, really nothing much for this bc day long weekend. i had kinda wanted to go see the van pride parade tho... but then she came and i decided to chill for the weekend after 2 crazy weeks so no seeing gays for me! hahaha. oh well there's always another time~

      day trip to victoria with mommy. we had wanted to go there for the afternoon tea at empress hotel for years, but i was just afraid to drive there on my own cuz i don't like to drive to unfamiliar places. so today's the first time i drove there by myself. it was indeed quite easy like everyone else said! (^O^) so yay! now i can drive there~!!!  took a freaking long time to get to victoria tho. we were gonna leave the house at 9am, but then my mom's friend who's drove there a lot of times recommended that we leave earlier as there may be long line-ups at the terminal. so we left at 8.30 and got to the terminal at 9am... and it's like what she said!!! even at such an early time on a saturday, there's a super long line-up!!! (>__  so we ended up waiting 2 hrs there at the terminal.. and finally got on the 11am one. but then that meant i had to change the reservation time cuz there was no way i could've been there at 12.15pm! and fortunately there's another spot left for the seating at 1.45pm, whew~ so, from the time we left the house, till the time we got to empress hotel, it was exactly 5 hrs!!! (>____  as for the famous victoria tradition, that afternoon tea at the empress hotel, i found it to be only ok tho... i guess it was cuz i had a pretty high expectation for it, seeing how it's $50 per person!!! i still find the one at secret garden to be better, and that one's about $25. after i had high tea there, i just had the strongest feeling of satisfaction. but for the empress one and some other ones i've had at other places, there was no particular satisfying feeling.  so i don't really know why the empress one's that expensive. it's worth twice as much as the secret garden's one, and i guess that other half is just the cost for the place huh... the hotel brand. but seriously, that hotel's sooo old i don't find it particularly pretty inside either! (^O^);;;  oh! and the empress one had time limit! only 1 hr!!! that's sooo short and i felt like we were sooo rushed. cuz aren't u supposed to take a long time to enjoy afternoon tea while u chat with others? the one at secret garden's 2 hrs and i already find it kinda short... but well, since the whole empress thing is a victoria tradition, it's still fun to try it once.. tho from now on i'll just go to secret garden for their high tea~ (^O^) cuz now i know they really are the best!!!  after the afternoon tea at 3pm, we went for orca watching! not being able to get on the 10am ferry did have its merits. cuz i had to go to the visitor info booth to ask for the empress hotel's phone number to change my reservation time, and while i was there, i found the walking guide for the victoria orcas!!!!!! (^O^)v  was sooo happy!!! cuz that was what i went to victoria for!!! before i was just gonna walk around randomly and try my luck in finding the orcas... now i have a map!!! yippee~!!! (^O^) ended up walking around half of downtown victoria in search of orcas and took 3 hrs.  there're 43 orcas in downtown victoria, 10 more scarttering across the whole vancouver island. outta those 43 orcas, i saw 23, and took pix of 12 of them that i thought were cute and unique enough worth taking pix (^O^) hehe! so it's not bad at all! at least i saw half of them!  mom was of course freakishly tired, having to run around half of downtown victoria in super hot weather with me. and of course she thought i was absolutely crazy to chase after the orcas like this... (^O^);;; ooh, and there was a lot of ppl around the harbour... we realized it was the 10th annual dragon boat competition this weekend...  apparently there's an orca in the butchart gardens too and i saw the picture of that one, it's sooo pretty!!! we had wanted to go there cuz it's their 10th anniversary this yr, and also there's fireworks during the summertime. oh! and they have afternoon tea there too! i wanna try that one as well! i absolutely love high tea~ (^O^);;;  but if we go there it'd mean we'd have to spend the nite... so we decided we won't go there today. hmm... but the orca and the tea~ (*O*) there's still some weeks left in the summer... maybe we should go there another saturday?! ooh but it costs a lot for the ferry ride tho. 1 car + 2 ppl = almost $60 one way already! aaaiya... so i dunno if we'll get to go there again this summer...  anyhow, we frantically got on the 7pm ferry like 10min beforehand... and finally got home at 9.30pm. just in time for me to watch this traditional chinese drama at 10pm that i've been following for some weeks!!! it's really exciting and i haven't missed one episode yet! haha! it's gonna end soon tho, probably 2-3 more episodes~  all in all, it's a really fun day! now that i'm finished with the victoria orcas, i'm gonna go chase after the van ones sometime before the end of this month and take lots of pix!!! since i got the walking guide for the victoria ones today, i saw on it there's an official website! and i already d/l the map for the van ones!!! yay!!! haha!!! crazy whale loving me~~~ (^O^)/   urlLink    (crazy me... i ended up buying 3 of those 4 posters... ^O^;;;)  ------>>  urlLink Orcas in the City

      sooo freaking hot today that i think i was a bit 中暑 (>o  took mommy to that famous korean restaurant for lunch. yummy cheap food~ and i actually like korean cuisine a lot cuz i'm into spicy food (^O^) oishii--- but was sooo full afterwards we went for a walk around the lost lagoon in stanley park~ haven't been there at all this summer! used to go there a lot in summertime before cuz i love the swans there~  had an interview at 2pm. the position was supposed to be a summer one that started in mid-june. i kept going in and calling them up at the time only to find the ceo always away. but i was really interested in the position since i think it really suits me, so i emailed the ceo himself twice. and so today of course he commented me on my persistence (^O^);; haha~  i think it went ok~ but i dunno how it'll end up... (@__@);;; ooh, this one was actually my 30th interview, after about 4 1/2 months. mom's saying these days that since i got rejected for all these interviews, maybe it's fate's way of telling me that i'm not supposed to work here, but in taiwan... (*__*);;  anywayz, so for the interview, i was in downtown in the early afternoon walking around and it was just the hottest time of the day. had to wait for almost 30min for the bus too. damn i must have just missed one... and then the air was sooo stuffy on the bus cuz it was just too hot, that's why i got the heat exhaustion.  missed passions today tho (>__  but well, i think this friday the 13th turned out ok for me~ other than the fact that i was suffering from the heat... (^O^);;;

      eric's getting married this morning in the kerrisdale church. told him i would go but at the time i didn't know it's on a weekday morning. when i finally realized that in the past few days i had still wanted to go. but then yesterday after i got the slightly disappointing reject call i got another call for an interview this morning. so couldn't attend the wedding... =(  interview went ok too i think?! but see, it's apparently quite misleading. sometimes u just know it's not that well when they're not that smiley. but other times even when they are all smiling and everything and u think it went great, still ended up getting rejected!!! so yah, i dunno anymore.  the lady today said the same thing like the one yesterday. i have all the required education and experience. my pc skills are pretty advanced too seeing how i got 90%+ on ms office applications. some other basic office stuff it's quick to learn. blah blah blah. yet still, why won't u pick me over the others?!??? (@___@);;;;; what does it take to get an entry-level office position?!?? aaargh.  anywayz, went to have dinner at the quay lounge in yaletown with mommy. it's exactly as good as the reviews said it is!!! the place only opened up last oct so it's not even a yr yet, but it's already a pretty popular hotspot! apparently a lot of local celebs love the place~ and i can totally see why! it's stylish, has great food and great location at yaletown, overlooking false creek! (^O^)  mom had the lamb rack. i don't eat lamb and i don't like to eat red meat at these western restaurants... so i always just have either pasta or seafood. tried their sea bass cuz it's said to be their most popular dish. and yah! it's really good! saw another couple sitting near-by who both had the sea bass! haha! mom said her lamb rack was really amazing too~  tried their fresh pear martini too. and it's tasty like the reviews said~ haha! loves martinis and cocktails (^O^) tried their signature dessert, the bread pudding too. and yum! it's only my 2nd time eating bread pudding. not a lot of places have that. 1st time i had it at bread garden and it sucked!!! but this one's truly amazing~ now i know what a real bread pudding is like! haha!  so this is only their first summer~ but i'm sure it'll have many more to come! and i'm definitely going back more to try other dishes! we only ordered entrees today cuz i wasn't sure how big theirs would be. and it turned out that the entrees portions aren't that big, so it's great cuz we could still have the stomach for dessert!  next time i wanna try their appetizers tho~ they have quite a few interesting ones but i didn't order any today cuz i didn't know how big those would be! some places have appetizers sooo big that u'd be sooo full u can hardly finish the entree! but at the quay, i saw others having appetizers and they're small! so yay! more points for the restaurant! (^O^)  so i missed the teen choice awards tonite for dining out. but eeh, not a big deal, i'll just wait for the re-runs. had wanted to watch it cuz heh it's hosted by paris hilton. i dunno exactly why i pay attention to the hilton sisters. i know about them from these japanese fashion magazines way before they got so famous in the states. but those were only one-dimensional from photos and stuff so i didn't know what they're like. after they got popular in their homeland i finally got to see what they're truly like in person, and of course i was quite surprised they're vulgar like that. but somehow i still find them interesting~ (^O^);;;  anyhow, another nice day~ lalalalala~!!! \(^O^)/

       According to a recent survey, 80% Canadians think Internet chatrooms and online dating services are dangerous, because they don't know who they're interacting with. 83% female and 77% male said they don't believe in Internet chatrooms.  69% said they refuse to use the Internet as a means to know others. 47% completely refused to know new people through the Internet (female 56% VS male 38%).  However, 65% Canadians said they think the Internet made it easier for them to know others, and between the ages of 25 to 34, 75% said they believe the Internet made it easier for them to get to know new people.  an article i read today in the papers. thought it's quite interesting to see such a high percentage of canadians who don't believe in chatrooms. so... i guess i really was stupid to have trusted ppl from there?! but then again, i was only 17ans at the time, and i had already tried to be as careful as possible... what more could i have done?!  it was also really interesting to see there's sort of this contradicting result from the survey. there're as many canadians who refused to use the internet to know new ppl while there're as many canadians who said the net made it easier for them to meet new ppl!!! quite frankly now tho, i dunno what's my stand on this issue anymore...  but i guess the main point of the survey is that there's a strong lack of trust on the internet. ppl just have a hard time trusting others online cuz they dunno who they're dealing with~

      測試: 你讓人有性衝動的指數到底有多高？  題目： 如果讓你跟魔鬼交換靈魂，你希望得到什麼利益？  1. 一輩子愛你的真愛 2. 一輩子沒煩惱的生活 3. 一輩子的好名聲 4. 一輩子花不完的財富   解析：  1. 選「一輩子愛你的真愛」的朋友: 說話甜死人的你，聽到你的聲音就會衝動。 讓人性衝動的指數80﹪ ： 這類型的人想法很感性浪漫，當人家跟他談話時就會有意無意的感受到他的溫柔跟體貼，另一半或者任何的異性聽到的話，自然而然久而久之就會產生性的衝動。  2. 選「一輩子沒煩惱的生活」的朋友: 身材太誘人的你，讓人忍不住想死盯著你看。 讓人性衝動的指數50﹪ ：這類型的人外型或者身材在團體中很容易就受到大家的屬目，最重要的是他會讓人家產生一個距離感，讓人只是會有欣賞的舉動。  3. 選「一輩子的好名聲」的朋友: 你太正派理性，異性最多在腦中閃一下不會有行動。 讓人性衝動的指數20﹪ ： 這類型的人屬於教官型，外表比較男人味，有獨特的魅力，雖然很正直很正派，但是給人家的印象還不錯，但是怕進一步被拒絕，或是被訓話，不如就僅止於欣賞就好了。  4. 選「一輩子花不完的財富」的朋友: 性魅力太強的你，動不動就勾起異性原始慾念。 讓人性衝動的指數99﹪ ： 這類型的人走實力路線，最重要的是他有自信心，他的自信心散發出來時，異性看到時就會覺得很有魅力。   well, seeing how materialistic i am, of course i chose 4~ if i could sell my soul to the devil, what i would like to have in return is definitely money!!! to have millions of dollars that one wouldn't be able to spend it all in a lifetime!!! HAHAHA!!! but that one turned out to be the one that'd arouse the strongest sexual drive in the opposite sex!!! 99%!!! *LOL* yah... like i wish that to be true... (^O^);;;  i was a bit leaning towards 1, selling my soul to the devil in exchange for true love. but in the end i still went for 4. yah... i'm sooo materialistic that i'd choose money over love~ (^O^);;; hahaha! but well, 1 turned out to be 80%, so that's not bad either. hearing the sweet voice would immediately arouse strong sexual drive in others... *LOL*  anywayz, what a funny little quiz~ (^O^)

      had an interview in the morning. was actually at a home office and it's sooo close to me. only 1 block away and 5 streets south! was for a mortgage broker assistant position. thought it's a pretty nice position and i could get to learn a lot of things. rite now, i'm pretty open to any interesting industries, and real estate is definitely one of them.  thought the interview went well. and she did say i have all the required education and experience and everything. and she's really nice and all that. so when i got home mom was like "how u think ur chances r?" and i'm always pretty hopeful... she's like "ur always so positive yet everytime it turned out to be nothing"  and it was true again this time. 5 hrs after the interview and i didn't even have a chance yet to send a thank-u email, she called me back saying she went with another candidate who's had banking experience, since for mortgages u'll have to be dealing with banks. (---___---);;; dunno what else to say......  and for some reason mom was even sadder than i was. well maybe i'm pretty much numb now after getting rejected for a couple of times?! (^O^);;;;;; so she was like "aren't u discouraged?" well, i really wasn't, just have to keep trying harder to look for more stuff... i guess in job hunting the most important thing is that u just have to stay positive.  anywayz, went to sun sui wah for lunch. could only go there now when mom's here cuz u can't eat dim sum by urself~ rite after we went in and were lead to our table, i noticed the lady sitting next to us was wearing this Hell's Belles tee!!! i just saw it last wed on the simple life!!! (*O*) when i saw paris hilton wearing that tee i already like it sooo much!!! cuz what a cool slogan!!!  Hell's Belles ~~~ hahaha!!!   urlLink     so i was quite surprised to see that lady wearing that tee!!! cuz it's like what a coincidence! i just saw it not even 1 week ago on tv!!! and well another reason i was surprised was cuz she didn't look that young.. probably in her 30s so i didn't think girls that age would wear something like that. (^O^);;; i ended up keep staring at her and i had sooo wanted to just go up to her to ask where she got the tee!!! mom was of course like "ur crazy!!!"  but i've had ppl come up to me to ask where i got my shirts a few times~ see just last nite at yaletown the same thing happened too! but i guess yah, all those times it's either at a mall or on the street, so it would be weird to do it in a restaurant~ and yah, i didn't go up to her to ask (^O^);;; just that i kept reminding myself to go back home and immediately search for it on net!!! i had already wanted to look for the tee online last wed after i watched the show but i just completely forgot about it!  so now i found the tee!!! yay!!! (^O^) it's only on one particular online shopping site tho~ so exclusive i dunno why?! anyhow, even tho i've never bought clothes online before, i like this tee sooo much i ended up buying it!!! haha!!! (^O^)v now i can't wait for it to arrive~~~ wheee!!!  the only thing i'm concerned about, and it's the reason i've never bought clothes online before, is that i'm not sure about the sizes. i have tshirts in all sizes ranging from s to xl!!! it's just really weird depending on the fabric. i've bought tshirts in japan in size s, and that's a country where clothes typically come in small sizes yet i could still get clothes! and the other day i got the rolling stones tee and these zodiac tees for friends and they're from the states, yet the fabric is sooo weird that it's still pretty small even in size xl!!! but well, usually size m works for me, so i hope this one will be ok~ (*__*)

      haven't gone to the movies in 2 weeks. so, went to watch tom cruise's new film with vivian around late afternoon at park theatre on cambie. first time there. thought it'd be crappy like the one on dunbar, which i haven't gone to in 6-7 yrs?! but it turned out to be quite ok!  as for the movie... eeh... all in all was ok i guess. was kinda boring and slow for the first half, and i remembered i was sitting there thinking "oh god... don't tell me the whole movie's so dead like this!!!" good thing it wasn't! the 2nd half was really exciting!!! so it made up for the 1st half's boredom~  tom cruise as the killer... really sexy. damn i do like evil guys... (^O^);;; tho his character was really too cold-blooded so it's kinda scary to see him just killing ppl like that. there were literally chills running down the spine~ yet somehow in a weird way i find pleasure in all of that *LOL* anywayz was quite a cool film~  and even tho i know all along that he's the bad guy in the movie cuz he's the killer and so he deserves to die and everything, i was kinda sad seeing him die at the end... (>___  i find it quite funny tho that they let him die so nicely. i mean, the scene still looks pretty good and he's not all bloodily scary or anything. i guess they still wanna maintain his image... and that's the funny part! u just can't let tom cruise die too ugly!!! (^O^);;;  so, took vivian to "shiru-bay" for dinner. the funniest thing is that now i'm exactly like alyson! she was telling me before when she brought me there that she's been going to the place to eat for 3 times in a week already! and that's exactly what i'm doing now! i've had dinners there for 3 times in 1 week too!!! hahaha~~~ (^O^)v  the manager wasn't there tonite tho. cool spiky hair guy with chin ring~ *GRIN* i'm not disappointed that he wasn't there and i didn't get to see him. it was actually a good thing, cuz yah it is kinda embarassing to keep going in there to eat... one of these days soon he's gonna recognize me (^O^);;;  and even tho i do find him really cool and everything, my heart rate didn't go up when i got him before tho, so yah i don't like him that way. haha... my heart's probably dying again tho seeing how i can't get excited by cute guys these days... (^O^);;;  i didn't make reservations for tonite but we were just lucky i guess, cuz when we went in at 7pm there were exactly 2 empty seats out on the patio!!! yay!!! i finally got to sit on their patio~ have been wanting to do that every time i went there but it's always full! the patio seats are first come first serve so it really just depends on ur luck that day! haha!  the reason i didn't make reservations was that i thought it's a monday nite, probably not gonna be so crowded anywayz. but wow, by about 8pm the place was completely full! and there were these groups of ppl waiting outside!!! when we left at 9pm, i saw the place was indeed packed cuz the big communal table was totally full!!! all the times i've gone in before, i've never seen it full! not even on a fri nite!!! so WOW~!!!  after dinner, we went for a short walk around yaletown. and then the funniest thing happened. these 2 guys on the patio yelled out to me saying i've got such a cool t-shirt and then asking me where i got it. *LOL*  it's that super lovers tee with the words "rock'n roll disco" on the front. it's really a pretty plain tee, just block letters on the front. the back is more interesting with the logo and stuff. so i said to them there's the backside too and turned around to show them *LOL* and they were really reading the words, cuz they said it out loud!!! hahaha~ and of course they were like "what's super lovers?" so i told them that's the brand.  i dunno, the whole thing wasn't like pick up or anything, and i think the guy may be a designer or something?! cuz he's just genuinely interested in the clothing itself! and after knowing the brand, he's like "so there's a website? like superlovers.com?" and i'm like yap! so haha.. now he's gonna go look for it online!!! (^O^) anywayz was a pretty interesting incident~  super lovers do have really cool t-shirts~ loves the brand!!! next time me gonna wear the other one with the slogan "love is the message" and see what kinda reactions i'd get there!!! *LOL* once i was around robson and some guy walking towards me just yelled out loud "LOVE IS THE MESSAGE~~!!!" (^O^) once in elevators ppl were joking and said "hey, so what's the message?" hahahaa~~~  anyhow, so vivian and i were peeking in at opus bar. had like no one in there since it's a weekday nite. but the place as always looks sooo nice! and since we don't like clubbing cuz we can't really dance, we said we'll go to opus bar next time to just sit on the sofas and chill to the music!!! and drink nice martinis... and hopefully go on a fri or sat nite and see if there're hotties!!! hahaha!!!  all in all, a pretty fun day~ \(^O^)/ ooh, tho now, the more times i go to yaletown, the more it makes me want to stay in van......

      mom got into a slight car accident yesterday around noon while she took godmom and her friends who are visiting from taiwan to kits beach. something about when they were gonna make a rite turn the car behind them didn't break in time and bumped into them a little bit. (O__O);;;  so it was nothing serious really and they were alright. the bumper is a bit twisted but the car's pretty ok too. tho we still had to take it to repair this morning cuz we filed a claim to icbc. we thought it's a pretty minor fix, but the repair shop said it's gonna take at least 2 days.. (*__*);;; it's ok tho, they gave us a car to drive around so at least we won't be stranded in our house.  by the time we finished doing all those bothersome things it's around noon. mom really didn't have the mind and the energy to cook lunch herself so we dined out again. took her to chianti's cafe cuz it's just nearby. and it's a great time to go there today too cuz they have this pasta frenzy event every mon/tues in which all pastas are discounted (^O^)  me tried their carbonara today. it's kinda hard to find original carbonara, or it's just that i didn't look hard enough?! cuz i've never had one here at all! i've had some in japan~ and while the ones there were pretty good too, the carbonara here's more authentic i think~ and the one at chianti is definitely amazing~ (^O^)   lalala~ i ♥ pasta~!!! （≧∀≦） haha! *crazy*     oh! tho i can't believe it's already mid-august!!! aaah~~!!! cuz i haven't finished writing all my summer greeting cards!!! (>___  it just takes me a long time to write in japanese these days so i kept stalling... must send them out before the end of the month tho!!! i already have to change it into 残暑見舞い now since it's almost the end of summer... (---__---);;; aiya~ me bad......    oh! and there's exactly 4 weeks left before mom and i go back to taiwan. that is of course, if i can't find a job by then... by now, i guess the outlooks don't look so good. just cuz i've been looking for 4 1/2 months now, and still nada. so what makes me think i'd find one in another 1 month?! (>___  going back creates a lot of problems tho. first and foremost, what's gonna happen to our cute little house here?!?? fall/winter's coming up soon, so there'd be lots of fallen leaves... and also it's gonna be dark for long hrs of the day so it's more dangerous for break-ins and whatnot... *sigh* i still wanna stay here sooo badly tho......  hmm... think i should go buy those albums that i've been wanting for some time already soon these days, so i can record them all onto minidiscs to bring back to taiwan. yah, these days now that mom's here, i'm not doing crazy shopping anymore so i haven't really spent money yet! which means i can go buy albums! whee~~ hehe!
