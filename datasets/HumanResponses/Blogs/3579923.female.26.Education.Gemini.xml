      Well, mine isn't - because I don't have one. I used to have an A & M corps t-shirt, which was inherited from the boyfriend of a friend's friend (long story). Anyways, the shirt said, "Old Cocks Never Die;" now that was some chicken memorablia to have. But, my boyfriend, the true longhorn that he is would not allow his girlfriend to own, much less wear such a t-shirt. So, alas it is long gone (the things you do for love). Anyways, we can all enjoy the antics of a  urlLink subservient chicken  at an internet site that one of my friend's told me about. It is great, and too funny. Type something bad and see what he does!

      that's today's Chevrolet. Yesterday, Richard, my sister's boyfriend won a  urlLink Chevy Colorado.  He played in a golf tournament in Waco with his grandpas. Apparently, there was a deal where if you got a hole in one, you won a truck - and...Richard got a hole in one. I just wanted to share because it is so exciting. Now, I ask...when do I get to win a car?

      So, I am naming my post after the new  urlLink Coke product: C2 . In doing so, I am going to discuss how you can’t always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you get what you need! (My friend  urlLink Rebecca  touched on this some in one of her past blogs.)  Anyways, why is it that the things we seem to want most in life are always so far out of reach? Is it because we truly want them; we really need them; or are we to blinded by the things that we already have that we think more would be better? The things I want aren’t always material; even though a pimp ride and few more G’s in my pocket would turn this rainy day bright. But a lot of the things I want aren’t physically tangible; for example, I would like peace of mind, less stress and maybe some of my relationships to be in different stages.  All of this aside..I am not complaining. I mean I have my health, a somewhat supportive family, friends, a cute cat (named Fletcher), an education, a (soon to be) amazing job, and a fabulous boyfriend…but I always think about what else I want. It is so bad, that my boyfriend  urlLink Jason  just tunes me out when he hears me say, “I want it;” because I say I want a lot of things. I also learned a trick from a relative of my sister’s boyfriend, Richard. A young cousin (I think) of Richards’ is three years old and she is a smart girl. In fact, at such a young age she has learned that it is not good enough to say “I want it!” but rather to move straight to saying “I need it!” when talking about a toy or candy or anything else she seems to want. I think this is now where I am at. I have resorted to acting like a toddler to try and make a point about what I need (or think that I need).  I mean if Coke can make us realize that we can now get what we need, rather than what we want in a soft drink...then why can't I carry that over to the other aspects of my life? I mean, I don't even drink soda!

      Hi everyone, as the title says, I am back. Sorry it has been awhile, I know several of you have emailed wanting to know where is an exciting story about one of my adventures. I have been off-line for a few days while  urlLink Jason  (my boyfriend for those that don't know..but who wouldn't know?!?) was visiting. Anyways, he had his digital camera here and photographed our time and adventures. I am sure he will be writing about it on his blog, so check it out. (www.jasonhunter.blogspot.com or click his name in the text)

      Les cochons, les cochons how I love les cochons! Just in case you didn't take a million years of French growing up like I did, a cochon is a pig. Funny enough, I learned the french names of farm animals in fifth grade; actually, I think the majority of french that I know I learned in elementary school...not my college classes - CRAZY! So, you are probably asking yourself, why is Ashley talking about pigs? Well, wild pigs have caused me much enjoyment over the past few days. During the past week wild pigs have invaded my street and ruined many a flower bed; while they hung for roots. These pigs come at night and in the morning all of the yards are torn up. I find humor in this because it is driving my parents and the neighbors insane. They are all scheming of different ways to rid our street of these animals - my Mom wants to sprinkle pepper in the yard, one neighbor is going to set traps, and another is going to bring some 'pig dogs' (what the hell is a pig dog?!?). Anyways, I have gotten the biggest kick out of watching these adults perseverate on pigs. I feel bad for the poor pigs. Because of the development of the area around our neighborhood, they have no where to go. Their homes are being torn down and their food source destroyed. I think before man contines to invade their territory, that we should atleast ask, "Little pig, little pig, let us in!"

      ...so are the  urlLink Days of our Lives . However, as the weeks of summer go by DAYS strays farther and farther away from the 'normalcy' of our lives.  For those of you, like myself, who watch the Soap you are probably asking yourselves, "what the hell is happening in Salem; or should I say the island?" And for those of you who just occasionally watch the show...well, I feel sorry for you having to keep up with the madness. However, you can  urlLink catch up  with Bo, Hope and the rest of the bunch online. It doesn't matter whether I watch DAYS during its' normal daytime slot or if I am catching up on SoapNet - I still am blown away by the current plot. To me, the current situation is more bizarre than years ago when Marlena was possessed. After 60 minutes of what my Grandma calls trash t.v. (she obviously has never seen  urlLink 'The Fifth Wheel' ), my head is filled with so many questions. For example, how did Marlena survive a gunshot wound through the chest with no medical care? Why is Victor there? Where is Tony? And the list could go on and on. My friend, Leslie A. Ketchup, has a theory that the folks on the island are clones of the deceased which have been programmed with the memories of their hosts. It could be possible. Then there is the notion that the Phoenix, that mean, mean, mean, Stefano DiMera, has risen (again). Who can say what the fate will be of the DAYS cast who are stuck on 'the island' - only the progression of summer will tell. For the time being, I hope that Celeste's psychic abilities will lead Bo & Hope to Sean Douglas and help him to escape from that nut job Jan Spears!

      Hey guys, my friend Tiffanie gave me this great idea of creating a birthday calendar for myself. This way I can seem like I have everything all together through out the year. I would really appreciate it if you would sign up so I can be reminded of your special day. Just check out  urlLink 'Birthday Alarm'  for more information. Don't worry it is quick, easy and you don't have to enter your year of birth! Let me know if you have questions.

      Now that I am back in Houston, I am part of the world of commuters - driving halfway across town just to go to class. Since my car does not have a cd player, I spend my morning drive flipping back and forth between 94.5 the BUZZ and "Houston's #1 hit music station 104 KRBE" (that is the phrase that pays, in case you ever need to know it).  Anyways, this morning on the BUZZ, Rod Ryan, the shows' host was discussing the ridiculousness of having to buy a wedding gift for someone when you are in the wedding. His argument was that, if you have to buy a plane ticket, pay for a hotel, rent a tux, etc.; that you have spent more than enough money - especially when the item you buy will probably end up in a garage sale in a few years.  However, he changed his tune after one of his co-hosts told him about the new craze of registering for your honeymoon. Now, being a girl who hopes to one day (soon) get married, I thought this was a brilliant idea - especially since the groom is supposed to pay for the honeymoon, but mine may be broke after buying the ring. The concept is that instead of or in addition to registering for tangible items, you can register for all or parts of your honeymoon. You can either register with a travel agent or online. You can select different items for people to pay for as gifts - such as airfare, hotel, room upgrades, meals, drinks, excursions or cash on the trip. According the radio show that I heard, once your loved one buys this item, then the agency sends you a card saying that your Aunt Edna bought an excursion for you and your new spouse to swim with the dolphins. This makes it easy for you to send thank you notes. In addition, folks can just add money to your honeymoon fund to pool together to cover the expenses. This is an amazing way to supplement your already existing registry and get a basically free honeymoon - who could ask for anything better?!?! Check out www.aruba.com , www.weddingregistry.com , or your local travel agent for details.

      So, as some of you may know, I accepted a pet-sitting job from one of my new bosses.  I originally thought that this would be a great way to get to know her and show my trustworthiness, as well as, make some extra money.  When I said YES, I was unaware of what the job entailed. I had previously dropped by my sister's house to feed her cat and spent a week mothering Po and Arthur, while my friend, Barbara, had surgery; but nothing compares to the pet-sitting experience that I have gotten myself into. This job, which pays $25/day involves feeding a 120 pound dog, 8 cats, 30 goats, 1 sheep, and a donkey - but not only do I feed them, the dog and the donkey require some TLC and lots of attention. Today was Day #1 of my duties as pet-sitter; and in true Houston form it began to pour on my way to the house. When I arrived at the house I changed clothes so that I would be in proper 'work' attire. I learned this from visiting MaryBeth's farm in kindergarten...a farm is no place for your Manolo Blahnik's. After I changed, I put on a large pair of boots and trampled through the rain and very tall grass to the barn. Feeding the cats and dog is a breeze, but feeding the livestock requires me to haul 50 pound bags of feed about a 100 feet - luckily, they have a cart so my lazy ass can push it. (Can you picture me in soaking wet clothes, boots that are 4 sizes to big, hauling 50 pound bags of feed?!?) Despite all of the odds, I enjoyed my time on the farm.  That is a good thing, since I have a few more days of service. Besides the downpouring rain, I felt like I was back in junior high playing tricks on 'goatie', MB's goat. Luckily for me, there were no gulleys to fall in, or horses to buck me off...only a lonely donkey and a million goats to make sure that I wasn't kidnapped (get it kidnapped..like goats have kids).

      So, this may seem like repetition..but it is. This weekend my good friend, Tiffanie Gomez and her boyfriend Arnel Gaspar got engaged. Hooray for Tiffanie and Arnel! So, if anyone is thinking of making plans with me next summer....you may have to schedule now. It is a wedding in May (MB and Diggums) and looks like 2 in July (Ketchup and Kenny, &amp; Tiffy and J'Arnel). Atleast I will get to head to SoCal for the 3rd one. PARTY - I can turn that into a super fun vacation. Ok, just wanted to let everyone know. Ciao!

      So, I was reading  urlLink Travis Richmond's blog  (he is one of Jasons' friends/Rebecca's ex for those who don't know) and he had a blog about 'how evil are you'? It is a website where you can take a quiz to find out your evilness. I scored a 43..pretty good - for me.  urlLink Jason  scored a 61 (the highest I have seen),  urlLink Rebecca  a 33, and Travis a 45 (the closest score to mine). I invite all of you to take the quiz and then leave me a comment stating how you did. Let the fun begin.  urlLink Check it out by clicking here!

      Working at Natural Wonders during undergrad. led to many interests of mine. First and for most, I met Jason there (I was his boss - HA)! And as I am sure some of you know, I developed a fascination for Koko (the gorilla who knows sign language). My friend, Matt and I would put on the Koko video every chance we got (well atleast until we started carrying the Croc Hunter tapes) - but that is besides the part. Anyways, I am always happy to hear updates about my good friend Koko and her partner Ndume. Recently Koko had a tooth ache and through the use of GSL (gorilla sign language) she was able to tell her friends (trainers) where it hurt. So, she had a dental and physical exam. It is a truly great story..check it out by clicking  urlLink HERE .

      Sorry it has been a while since I last posted. I have begun my new job - I am officially an LSSP intern with Klein ISD (north Houston); for those that don't know an LSSP is a Licensed Specialist in School Psychology. What fun. It is weird though because I am 26 (and almost a half) and have NEVER worked a full-time job before. Now before I get comments with criticism, let me add that I HAVE worked since I was 16 (just not full time; in fact I have worked 2 jobs at once while being in school) - and according to the government, I have 33 out of 40 credits needed to get benefits when I retire (does that make sense?)! However, according to my Mom, once my $ starts to go into TRS (some teacher retirement thing) then I won't get the other money that my 10 years of hard work has contributed to society - oh well. Anyways, back to my job. It is far better than folding shirts at Wet Seal, changing diapers at Headstart, cooking dinner at Brown Karhan, or grading countless protocals for one of my Professors'. I still don't know my salary (I should know soon), it will either be ok or really good for my first year (everyone keep your fingers crossed for the really good salary). I work with 2 other interns, one from Trinity and one from SHSU. I will tenatively work through 5 rotations this year - 1. Klein Oak High School, 2. Krahn Elementary, 3. Hildebrandt Intermediate, 4. PPCD (a preschool program - which I might add is where I want to end up working after this year), and 5. TEP (basically an alternative school for the really severe ED kids). Since each school has a diagnostician on staff, I will focus more on ED (emotionally disturbed), autism and other social/psych. issues and of course, counseling. I am really excited, but working this much makes me tired. It is hard trying to keep with everything; my cat who is like a baby during the night, my parents who think I am their personal assistant 24/7 (even when I am at work), talking to my boyfriend (who I love so much..but our schedules conflict greatly so at times I stay up way past my bedtime to talk to him), and then of course my job. But, atleast I have NO more classes (atleast until I do a Ph.D. - if I do). That is all to share for now, I am currently reading  Love's Executioner  it is a super great read and I will do a book report post on it once I finish. Until then, take care of yourself and each other.
