      Thursday I took a flyfishing course, and went fishing later that night. As most times I'm not were luck when It comes to catch fish.  Friday went by, but at the end of the day I tried to call Rocco about setting uo a meeting. Unfortunately his was in Stockholm editing his latest movie. Guess I'll call him again over the weekend.  Sunday we had my mom and grandparents over for a BBQ.

      To day I opened my mail and there was a brief note from Rocco. It said "this is VERY interesting. You can reach me at 414-xxx-xxx. Lets meet and talk about this." Wow, cool, I was so excited I called some friend to tell them what I just did. I was not surprised about not getting any negative response  actually they were all go nuts about how cool they thought this was... I promised to keep them updated.

      I worked most of the night, helping a customer getting his Mac up and running. Doing video on a fragmented disc is no success. Hi had tried to defrag. the disc himself, but It crashed. Turned out that the disc had Journaling enabled. So It worked out just fine, but the waiting took forever and a lot off coffee.  I got up early anyway and when to Apple Norway. The had a Post-NAB seminar for resellers. We went through all the new cool apps like Final Cut Pro HD, Shake, Motion and DVD Studio Pro. This apps rules! I'm really looking forward to them getting in the market.

      What!?! There's been alot in the news lately, about this dude Thomas "Rocco" Hansen, doing real Norwegian Porn-movies. A friend and I thought we might see what this was, so I went to check his site. I logged in at http://www.roccoporn.com and found that it was possible to preorder the upcoming movie.  So why was this shown any interessed by media any way? Well, the movie was made with acctuall graduates, called "Russ". The thing was that I saw this link that draw my attention, saying: Wanted Humm, whoo, whats this! The company wanted to get hold of editors, cameracrew, actors and more. So sitting there thinking back on all those times I had a big mouth about getting in to that kinda business, I thought: What the heck, Its now or never. So I filled out the form... Interessting to see what happens.

      Yesterday I gave Macromedia Contribute 2 a try. I'm not much into html coding, so I had to find something that worked for me. Take a look at  urlLink  www.flottumvp.no . It's still a work in progress but I think it is working.  Friday I'm going to Lillehammer to do system maintenance on two Macs.  Saturday and Sunday I'm on to the "Opus and Emil" pilot. I hope everything is set and ready. The mainstreet in Gran is big mess, after a lot of digging, but let's hope it turns out ok. More on that to come on Sunday. I think I also have fond out how to ad links and images, so this will be more interesting from now on  ;-)

      I called a friend in San Diego, the time difference was not on my mind, at 3AM local time in SD. Lucky I didn't wake him. He was awake cause of a new dog that kept him up. I promised to give him a call after the meeting. He was almost coming through the phone when I told him about my meeting. I think he almost got a boner just thinking of all this could lead to – grouse dude, grouse! (Hope your dog is ok  ;-)  I met Rocco in Oslo around 4PM. A really cool dude. We talked for about an hour. Turned out he was not only interested in a cameraman. He was also looking for a more local editor (as he did it in Stockholm). In my opinion the meeting went very well. To bad things wasn't all sorted out about how the Team Rocco was gonna work. So we had a positive dialog, and we would keep in touch. Rocco was soon of to a well earned holiday someplace by the Mediterranean. So I guess there's not gonna happen much until late July.   I know that PornIdol is up this Fall, so I have my hopes  ;-)

      Tomorrow I have a meeting about making a TV series about two dogs. The series is for children age 3-4 and up to 6-8. I've been chosen to do the pilot, and we well try to do as much as possible localy here in Hadeland "County".  Later on Friday I'm going out with colleagues from my old job. We were split in the summer of 2002, but manage to keep in touch. Occationaly we go out for dinner and ends usually up at some party. Friday is also the first weekend that there are no smoking AT ALL! As of Juni 1st there are probated to smoke at any public area where they serve, whether drinks or food. Like Irland, and some states in the US. I'm not gonna miss that awfully stinking smell from my clothes and the smell of nicotine being washed out when one hit the shower... da-ah... smokers: suck it up!

      Today I went over to a friend. We've marketing ourselves as weddingvideographers, and today we were gonna plan out how to make a reasonable webpage. Nothing expensive and fancy, but clean and well thought  "less is more".  I gave Rocco a new call. After a short talk we decided to meet at Bar 1, at Aker Brygge in Oslo the upcoming Saturday.
