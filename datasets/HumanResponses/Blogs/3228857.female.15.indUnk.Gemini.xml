       Questions that if u know me u know that only i would ask...    What hair color do they put on the driver's license of a bald man?   When dog food is new and improved tasting, who tests it?   Why didn't Noah swat those 2 mosquitos?   Why isn't phoenetic spelled like it sounds?   Why and How are there INTERSTATES in Hawaii?   Why are there flotation devices in the seats of planes instead of  parachutes?   How are u supposed to use the cushion of ur seat on an airplane as a flotation device when u prolly crapped all over it when the plane went down?   What do u call a male ladybug?   Why are cigarettes sold at gas stations where smoking is prohibited?   Why are there parking lots at bars when u arent allowed to drink and drive?   Is it OK to listen to an AM radio station after noon?   If we have AM stations why dont we have PM stations?   What do chickens think we taste like?   Why does everything taste like chicken?

      I read of a reverend who stood to speak   at the funeral of his friend.   He referred to the date   on her tombstone   from the beginning... to the end.   He noted that first came the date of her birth and spoke of the date with tears  but he said what mattered most of all  was the dash between those years.   For that dash represents all the time  that she spent alive on earth, and  now only those who loved her know  what that little line is worth.   For it matters not how much we own; the cars, the house, the cash.  What matters is how we live and loved and how we spend our dash.   So think about this long and hard, Are there things you'd like to change? For you never know how much time is left You could be at "dash mid-range"   If we could just slow down enough  to consider what's true and real, and always try to understand  the way other people feel, and  be less quick to anger, show appreciation more and love the people in our life like we've never loved before.   If we treat each other with respect,  more often wear a smile  remembering that this special dash  might only last a little while.   So when your eulogy is being read with your life's actions to rehash... would you be pleased with the things they say about how you spent YOUR DASH?

      Have you ever wondered  Have you ever wondered how You always wait for someone special to enter your life  And then when it seems like they never will,  They come when you least expect it? And how they then make your life so much better With just knowing that they exist And that they care about you?  Or how when something is wrong They are the only person that you want to run to And have them hold you in their arms And tell you that it will all be alright  How when you see them, Your stomach gets all those wild butterflies And you begin to think “wow’ they are really awesome” or “ I really hope they like me as much as I like them”, When in reality, they have liked you for o’ so long.  Have you ever wondered if it is really possible to control your feelings? Or if we are all lost,  And unable to control Those feelings of love?  Why, when. You are angry And all you want to do is yell That wonderful person comes and  No matter how angry you were at them You find a special place in your heart to forgive And you realize your not quite as mad as before  Eventually we all find That one special person That comes into our lives To fill that special spot in our hearts That was reserved just for them And they make life just a little more enjoyable And you never quite understand why, You just know that it is.

      If my parting has left a void Then fill it with remembered joy A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss, Ah yes, these things, I too, will miss. Be not burdened with times of sorrow I wish you the sunshine of tomorrow My life's been full, I savored much  Good Friends, good times, a Loved pne's touch. Perhaps my time  seemed to brief Don't lengthen it now with  undue grief Lift up your heart and  share with me God wanted me now, He set me free.

      Rule 1: If u pull up in the driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a package cause u sure aren't picking anything up. Rule 2: You do not touch my daughter in my presence. You may glance at her as long as your gaze doesnt travel below her neck! If you cannot keep ur hands or eyes off my daughter  i will gladly remove them. Rule 3: i am aware that it is fashionable to wear your trousers so loosely they appear to be falling off of your hips. Please dont take this as an insult, but u and all ur friends are idiots. Still i want to be fair and keep an open mind about this issue, so i propose a compromise: you may come to the door with your underwear hanging out and your pants 10 sizes to big, and i will not object. However, in order to insure that your clothes do not in fact come off during the course of the date with my daughter. I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in place at your waist. Rule 4: I'm sure you've been told that in today's society, sex without  utilizing a "Barrier Method" can kill you. Let me elaborate...when it comes to my daughter and sex i am the barrier and i will kill u.  Rule 5: It is usually understood that in order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports or politics or other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only information i require from you is an indication of what time u will have my daughter safely back at home, and the only word i need to here is "early". Rule 6: I have no doubt that u are a very popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out wiht my little girl you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with u. If u make her cry i will make u cry. Rule 7: As u stand in my home, waiting fo rmy daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process that can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why dont u make urself useful by, ohh changing the oil in my car?  Rule 8: The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter into wearing shorts, tanktops, midriff T's, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka zipped all of the way up. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which feature chainsaws are ok. Hockey games are ok. Old folks homes are better. Rule 9: Do not lie to me. I appear to be a potbelied, balding, middle-aged, dimwitted has-been. But on issues concerning my daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless God of your universe. If i ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a shove, and 5 acres behind the house do not trifle with me. Rule 10: Be afraid, be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice paddy near Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the voices in my head frequentl tell me to clean my guns as i wait for you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull in the driveway you whould exit the car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter home safely and early, then return to your car-there is no need for you to come inside. The camouflaged face you see in the windo is mine.

      *You know you're in love when you think about someone more times in a day than you think about yourself.*   *When I met you I knew it was fate, becoming your friend was a choice, but falling in love with you was beyond my control.*  *I love you not only because of who you are but also because of who I am when I'm with you.*   *They say you only fall in love once, it can't be true. Everytime I look at you, I fall in love all over again. **Someone out there is meant to be the love of your life, your best friend, your soul mate, the one who looks at u and smiles.He'll brush the hair out of your eyes and send you flowers when you least expect it. He'll call you in the middle of the night just because he was thinking about you~ he'll look into your eyes and tell you that you're the most beautiful girl he has ever seen, and for the first time in your life............you'll believe it.**

      Recently, when I went to McDonald's I saw on the menu that u could get an order of 6, 9 or 12 chicken nuggets. I asked for a halfdozen nuggets "We don't have halfdozen nuggets" said the person at the counter. "You don't?" i replied. "We only have 6, 9 or 12" was the reply. "So i can't have a halfdozen nuggets but i can have 6?" "Thats right." So I shook my head and ordered six McNuggets.  I was checking out at the local Foodland with just a few items and the women behind me put her things close to mine on the belt so I picked up one of those divider things so they wouldn't get mixed. After the girl had scanned all my items she picked up the divider and tried to find the barcode so she could scan it. Not finding one she asked me "Do you know how much this is?" I said to her "I changed my mind, I dont think i will buy that today." She said "OK" and i paid for my things and left. A women at work was seen putting her credit card into her floppy drive and pulling it out quickly. When shopping on the internet and they kept asking her for her credit card number, so she was using the ATM "thingy" I recently remember seeing a distraught young women weeping beside her car "Do you need some help?" I asked. She replied, "I knew i should have replaced the battery to this remote door unlocker. Now i cant get into my car. Do you think they(pointing to a distant convenient store" would have a battery that fits?" "Hmmmm, I duno. Do u have an alarm too?" I asked. "No, just this remote thingy." she answered, handing it and the keys to me. As i took the key and manually unlocked the door, i replied "Why dont u drive over to the store and check about the batteries. It's a long walk/" An intern who was none to swift. One day she was typing and turned to a secretary and said "i'm almost out of paper, what do i do?" "Just use copier paper," the secretary told her. With that the intern took her last remaining blank piece of paper, put it into the copier and made 5 blank copies. A large motorhome was taken into a repair shop. The whole thing looked as though it had been in the movie TWISTER. When asked what had happened the repairman said the driver had put the motorhome on cruise control and then went back to make a sandwich IDIOTS COMPUTERS...A guy works in the operations dept. in the central office of a large bank. Employees in the field call him when they have problems with their computers. One night he got a call from someone in one of the branches that had a question: "I've got smoke coming from the back of my computer. Do you guys have a fire downtown?" Police in Radnor, Pennsylvania interrogated a suspect by placing a metal colander on his head and connecting it with wires to a copier. The message "your lying" was placed on the copier, and police pressed the copy button everytime they thought he was lying. Believing the "lie detector" was working, the suspect confessed everything. Remember life is tough its tougher if you're stupid!!

      I want to go back to the time when...  Decisions were made by going eeny-meeny-miney-mo Mistakes were corrected by yelling DO OVER!! Race Issues meant arguing over who ran the fastest Money issues were handled by whoever was the banker of Monopoly Catching the fireflies could happily occupy an entire evening It wasn't odd to have 2 or 3 best friends Being old refered to anyone over 20 The net on a tennis court was perfect height to play volleyball and rules didnt matter The worst thing u could get from the opposite sex was cooties It was magic when dad would "remove his thumb" It was unbelievable that dodgeball wasnt an olympic sport Having a weapon in school meant that u got caught with a slingshot Scrapes and bruises were kissed and made better It was a big deal to finally be tall enough to ride the big people rides at the amusement park Getting a foot off snow was a dream come true Abilities were discovered because of a double-dog-dare Saturday morning cartoons weren't 30 minute ads for action figures No shopping trip was complete unless a new toy was brought home Oly-oly-oxen-free made perfect sense Spinning around, getting dizzy, and falling down was cause for giggles The worst embarrassment was getting picked last for a team War was a card game Water balloons were the ultimate weapon Baseball cards in the spokes transformed any bike into a motorcycle Taking drugs meant orange flavored chewable asprin Ice cream was considered a basic food group Older siblings were the worst tormentors, but also the fiercest protectors

      ok i took this colortest and the results are actually pretty true its kinda wierd!  Your Existing Situation... Works well with others buit is disinclined to take the leading role. Needs a personal life of mutual understanding and freedom without discord.  Your Stress Sources... Feels that life has far more to offer and that there arestill important things to be achieved--that life must be experienced to the fullest. As a result, she pursues her objectives wit a fierce intensity that will not let go of things. Becomes deeply involved and runs the risk of being unable to view things with sufficient objectivity, or calmly enough; is therefore in danger of becoming agitated and of exhausting her nervous energy. Can't leave things alone and feels she can only be at peace when she has finally reached her goal.  Your Restrained Characteristics... The situation is preventing her from establishing herself, but she must make the best of things as they are.  Desired Objective... Needs to feel identified with someone or something and wishes to win support by her charm and amiability. Sentimental and yearns for romantic tendencies.  Actual Problem... Has a fear that she maybe prevented from achieving the thing she wants. This leads her to employ great personal charm in her dealings with others hoping that this will make it easier for her to reach her objectives.

      ok i tried one of those personality tests or wateva and just thought id share the results with ya'll  You're open minded, extroverted, free-spirited, and independent. Chances are you're pretty liberal. You're like a magnet for love and affection. People adore you. And, thanks to that healthy dose of self-confidence, you're super-flexible.   Chances are, you're a great leader at work. You're also a self-starter and will always volunteer to take on a job. You're also an excellent communicator and tend to spread your enthusiasm to others.  And that's just scratching the surface!

Having your friends send you home-made cookies.   38. Holding hands with someone you care about.   39. Running into an old friend and realizing  that some things (good or bad) never change.   40. Watching the _expression on someone's face as they open a much-desired present from you.   41. Watching the sunrise.   42. Getting out of bed every morning and  being grateful for another beautiful day.   43. Knowing that somebody misses you.   44. Getting a hug from someone you care about deeply.   45. Knowing you've done the right thing,  no matter what other people think.    Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly

Hey! Honey, I'm home!  I broke a nail opening the mail I cursed out loud 'cause it hurt like hell This job's a pain-it's so mundane It sure don't stimulate my brain  This job ain't worth the pay Can't wait 'til the end of the day Honey, I'm on my way Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way Rub my feet, gimme something to eat Fix me up my favorite treat Honey, I'm back, my head's killing me I need to relax and watch TV Get off the phone-give the dog a bone Hey!

      The liquid inside young coconuts can be used as a  substitute for blood plasma.   No piece of paper can be folded in half more than  seven (7) times.   Donkeys kill more people annually than plane crashes.   You burn more calories sleeping than you do  watching television.   Oak trees do not produce acorns until they are fifty  (50) years of age or older.   The first product to have a bar code was Wrigley's  gum.   The king of hearts is the only king without a  mustache.   American Airlines saved $40,000 in 1987 by  eliminating one (1) olive from each salad served in  first-class.   Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise.   Apples, not caffeine, are more efficient at waking  you up in the morning.   Most dust particles in your house are made from  dead skin.   (No wonder my house is so DUSTY!)   The first owner of the Marlboro Company died of lung  cancer.  So did the first "MarlboroMan."   Walt Disney was afraid of mice.   Pearls melt in vinegar.   The three most valuable brand names on earth:  Marlboro,  Coca Cola, and Budweiser, in that order.   It is possible to lead a cow upstairs...but not  downstairs.   A duck's quack doesn't echo, and no one knows why.   Dentists have recommended that a toothbrush be kept at  least  six (6) feet away from a toilet to avoid airborne  particles resulting from the flush.   (I keep my toothbrush in the living room now!)  (What if u keep ur toothbrush in a drawer???)  Richard Millhouse Nixon was the first U.S. president  whose name contains all the letters from the word  "criminal." The second?  William Jefferson Clinton.  (Please don't tell me you're SURPRISED!?!!)   And the best for last.....   Turtles can breathe through their butts.   (I know some people like that; don't YOU?)   Now you know everything there is to know aren't u glad i passed this   AMAZING   knowledge onto you?

      If you yelled for 8 yrs, 7 months, and 6 days you would have produced enough energy to heat one cup of coffee.  (hardly seems worth it)  If you farted consistently for 6 yrs and 9 months, enough gas would be produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb  (now thats more like it!!)  The human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out to the body to squirt blood 30 ft.  (O.M.G.!!)  A pig's orgasim lasts 30 minutes  (In my next life i want to be a pig.)  A cockroach will live 9 days without its head b4 it starves to death.  (Creepy) (i'm still not over the pig)  Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hr.  (do not try this at home...maybe work)  The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is attached to its body. The female initiates sex by ripping the male's head off.  ("Honey, i'm home. What the...?!")  The flea can jump 350 times its body length. It;s like a human jumping the length of a football field.  (30 minutes...lucky pig...can you imagine??)  The catfish have over 27,000 taste buds.  (Who counts them?) (What could be so tasty on the bottom of a pond?)  Some lions mate over 50 times a day.  (I still wana be a pig in my next life..quality over quanity)  Butterflies taste with there feet.  (Something i always wanted to know)  The strongest muscle in the body is the tounge.  (Hmmmmmmmm.....)  Right-handed people live, on average, nine yrs longer than left-handed people.  (if your ambidextrous,do you split the difference?)  Elephants are the only animals that cant jump.  (Ok, so that would be a good thing....)  A cat's urine glows under a black light.  (I wonder who was paid to figure that out?)  An ostrichs eye is bigger than its brain.  (i know people like that)  Starfish have no brains  (I know people like that too)  Polar bears are left-handed  (If they switched theyd live longer)  Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure.  (What about that pig??)

      How to keep a healthy level of insanity: 1. At lunch time sit in your parked car with sunglasses on and point a hair dryer at passing cars. See if thye slow down. 2. Page yourself over the intercom. Don't disguise your voice. 3. Every time someone asks you to do something, ask if they would like fries with that. 4. Put your garbage container on your desk and label it "in" 5. Put decaf in the coffee maker for 3 weeks. Once everyone has gotten over their caffiene addictions, switch to espresso. 6. Finish all of your sentences with "in accordance with the prophecy" 7. Don't use any punctuation marks  8. As often as possible skip rather than walk  9. Ask people what sex they are and then laugh hysterically after they answer. 10. Specify that your drive-thru order is "to go" 11. Sing along at the opera 12. Go to a poetry recital and ask why the poems dont rhyme 13. Put mosquito netting around your work area. Play a tape of jungle sounds all day 14. 5 days in advance tell your friends you cant attend the party because you arent in the mood 15. Have your coworkers address you by your wrestling name 16. When the money comes out of the ATM scream "I WON!! I WON!!! 3rd time this week!!!" 17. When leaving the zoo, start running towards the parking lot screaming "run for your lives, they're loose!!!"  and finally, 18. Tell your children over dinner "due to the economy we are going to have to let one of you go"

No one on earth will ever give me the feeling of being truly loved and cherished and needed not my family, and they aren't allowing my friends to give it to me either. Do i have anyone here to turn to?

      Everything crashing down around me all at once where do i turn when my parents who claim they want to comfort me say that I should be over it by now, be USED TO IT by now. How are you ever able to become accustomed to death? Why would you ever want to become used to death? Then my parents wonder why i run to my friends for comfort instead of them.

      I dont understand is it coincidence that every 2 weeks we lose someone close to us?  Is it just by chance that every 14 days we prepare for another funeral another trip to the cemetery? I dont know i wish i did i would give anything to know just to prepare, just to have some chance to keep myself from falling apart. I need to just crumble but i cant now, i cant add my pain to everyone elses but i just need to help them and i cant do that if im hurting so i just can not hurt anymore. I have to put myself on teh back burner and take care of krystal, kerri, cory and everyone and anyone else who is hurting then i can help myself.  I just have to remember to always put others first.

      the pain builds inside me, wanting to break free. it wants to take the form of a knife... I want to spell out the grief in a way people might understand, might be able to help. No one understands here, i feel so alone, i am going to go crazy here. These imitators, these actors, they lie to me constantly they demand i act as if nothing were wrong. They couldnt imagine the pain they've never been in my shoes they've never experienced a day in my life and yet they claim to understand exactly how i feel.  HA ! Yeah sure of course they do yet when i show emotion they say not to they tell me to get over it, to cope well its a little late for that! the pain is starting to dissipate anger, blind rage, toward these people who call themselves my parents, takes it's place. I have to get rid of this anger i have to let it out if i dont i will surely explode! I cant do this anymore to many things are piling up on top of one another fear, pain, stress, anger, rage, need... oh the need, the need for love, comfort, someone who will accept me for who i truly am not the mask, someone who needs me, a purpose, someone to listen, an outlet. Everyone has there weakness this is mine, i need. i cant help it i have needs, most times i have learned to live without them, but sometimes they bubble back to the surface and i cant help it anymore. I need to be needed to be able to be there for someone!

      so what is the point of having feelings for someone who could die at anytime or of making friends who could leave you or die at anytime. I am so scared to get to close to someone and have my heart ripped out and run through a blender when i have to leave or when something happens to them. I am going to probably be feeling like i am now when we move the whole rip, puree thing. and i dont know if ill even be able to function when it all comes crashing down august 1st.

      if only...if only...oh what i wouldn't give just to be held just to be allowed to let it all out and just let all of the walls crumble around me, just once, but i cant  i will never be able to let the walls come down. I would give anything, anything for just a moment, one single moment when i could come completely clean and just fall into someones open arms! ALL of me, problems and all. No masks, No walls, No anything and be held for what feels like eternity and a day

      She fooled all of her friends into thinking she's so strong. but she still sleeps with the light on, as she smiles again her mother lies there with cancer, and her friends don't understand her. She's a question without answers, who feels like falling apart. she knows, she's so much more than worthless, but she needs to find her purpose, she wonders what she did to deserve this  she's calling out to you this is a call, this is a call out cause everytime i fall down i reach out to you and im losing all control now, and my hazard signs are all out im asking you to show me  what this life is all about... ...Have you ever felt this way before? cause i dont want to hide  here anymore, take me to a place where nothings wrong thanks for coming shut the door, they say someone out there sees us, well if you're real then save us Jesus, cause ive been this way for far to long i wasnt meant to feel alone...

      i cant help it ive been burned one to many times  i am beginning to shy away from the fire i love getting there but when i finally get what i have sought after for so long i no longer want it... wat is wrong with me?  is it because i crave the attention or is it just because the match doesnt work? i wish i didnt guard my heart so closely i wishi could trust yet im scared to open up because opening up leads to getting burned... i wish i could safely guard myself and yet still let people in but life isnt that easy it never will be

      I don't understand these dreams Are they dreams or are they actually visions with other people in them? I don't understand the one about jessica came true will these others come true as well? I don't want to lose anyone else  I'm sick of death  sick of funerals  sick of mourning  and sick of sadnes Why can't it just all be over? Why can't i just end it now? Take away all of the suffering  All of the pain

      "True friends are the people that are there for you unconditionally. They are the people that never question you and support you no matter what the circumstances are. They are the people worth living for." -unknown   “True friendship is when two friends can walk in opposite directions, yet remain side by side.”  "We will be friends until forever, just you wait see." - Pooh Bear  "Friends. A simple word isn't it? It's uttered everyday to almost every person imaginable. Who are your friends? I used to think that friends were the people that you could laugh and talk to. Now I know that friends aren't that, they're the people that touch ur heart. You could spend hours with them doing nothing at all and it can be the best time of your life, just becuase it was with them. They're the people you can share your secrets with, cry with, laugh with, and just have fun with. They don't judge you or make you change. They accept you exactly as you are. They look at you and they see a great person, one they love spending time with. You all share something in common and are tied together by memories, tears, laughs and smiles. You're tied together by love for the other. Friendship is the strangest but greatest thing in the world. I find my time with my friends, the best times of my life. My friends are my heart, my soul, my fun, my laughter, tears, love and my life." -Kate Tierney  "Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It's not something you learn in school. But if you haven't learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven't learned anything." -Muhammad Ali  "I hope we'll be friends forever, together we'll always be. I don't think you understand just how much you mean to me. And one day when we part our ways, we'll think back to the past and think about how happy we are 'cause our friendship will always last."  ---Bridget Davis   "We all take different paths in life, but no matter where we go, we take a little of each other everyhwere."  ---Tim McGraw   "It's the best feeling in the world when you meet new friends that you can't stand to be without. That you constantly want to impress to make them like you even more. They make you hope everyday that they won't leave you. Until that day when they actually do, and you're lost without them. You can't think about anything else but when you're going to see them again."  ---Unknown   "The friendship isn't worth the tears unless the friend is."  ---Kellina Filbin   "When it hurts to look back, and you're scared to look ahead, you can look beside you, and your best friend will be there."  ---Unknown   "When you look around and your world is crumbling, and when you think no one loves you, your best friend is the one to run to."  ---Meaghan West   Some people come into our lives and quickly go. Some stay for awhile and leave footprints on our hearts. And we are never, ever the same.-- Anonymous  A friend hears the song in my heart and sings it to me when my memory fails.-- Anonymous  "A friend loves at all times."  -- The Bible: Proverbs 17, 17.  It's the ones you can call up at 4:00 a.m. that really matter.-- Marlene Dietrich

      We all want to fall in love. Why? Because that experience makes us feel completely alive. Where every sense is heightened, every emotion is magnified, our everyday reality is shattered and we are flying into the heavens. It may only last a moment, an hour, an afternoon. But that doesn't diminish its value. Because we are left with memories that we treasure for the rest of our lives.

      well it's all but final, the move that is. the offer has come in and all my parents have to do is sign it and its all worked out. it'll be final we'll definately b moving and there'll be no way of stopping it. the final paper will only be a little while afterwards and the moving vans won't be far behind. the tears will flow soon unheaded and unstoppable. but why borrow trouble when you have enough trouble for the day already?

      well ive been thinkin back over the last few months and all of the events that have unfolded and it almost makes me wish that i had been the one to die so i wouldnt have to deal with all of the pain of the deaths and the pain that goes along with the deaths. i can put up a good front make everyone think im ok that everything inside me has gone back to b4 that im still carefree still happy. Thats only bcuz if i showed the truth feelings inside of me it would cause them more pain and i just cant do that i cant allow my friends to feel anymore pain i wish i could take everything they are feeling away so that they dont have to be sad anymore so that they dont have to question, "Why?". i feel like im being torn apart inside and yet im not allowed to let these emotions out not allowed to let them affect my everyday life. im barely pleasing him in the first place if i broke down and showed him the true me he wouldnt even b able to look at me. he would disown me. mayb i should define who he is, he is my father, the man who is supposed to protect me, supposed to provide and shelter me yet he is the one i am running from the most. I cant stand it i cant do this anymore i have to get out have to get away. i need a week, a day, even just an hr without someone looking over my shoulder telling me everything that i am doing wrong pointing out my every flaw and imperfection. just an hr when i will be excepted for who i truly am not for just the image i put up the mask i put on a place where i can let the wall crumble and have people there to hold me through the tough times and laugh with me through the good. and now that ive finally found that place i am being torn away from it and dragged across the country to a place where i will kno no one and will b  expected to put on my best mask and make new friends and convince them to except me when my own father wont. i dont think i can do this, i cant even go a week without talking to my best friend when she is only in iowa and thats only about 6 or 7 hrs away not 21. they say theyll visit me but will they really? it'll b too expensive, or everyone'll b too busy. i mean yeh for the first mayb yr or so some of us mite stay in contact but after that...i dont even want to think about it i dont wana even think about losing the people that have meant the most to me in my entire life for a life time. now the tears flow uninhibited and i wish they wouldnt bcuz then people wonder y and when u tell them they tell u to forget about it that thatll neva happen that of course ull see them again. YEH RITE OF COURSE cus u def kno wat im going through rite now when u have never had to do this b4!!!  well i honestly believe that i have vented enough so im gonna get outa here

'Cuz it hurst when you disapprove all doing  And now I try hard to make it I just want to make you proud I'm never gonna be good enough for you I can't pretend that I'm alright And you can't change me  'Cuz we lost it all Nothing lasts forever I'm sorry I can't be perfect Now it's just too late and We can't go back I'm sorry I can't be perfect  I try not to think About the pain I feel inside Did you know you used to be my hero? All the days you spend with me Now seem so far away And it feels like you don't care anymore  And now I try hard to make it I just want to make you proud I'm never gonna be good enough for you I can't stand another fight And nothing's alright  Nothing's gonna change the things that you said Nothing's gonna make this right again Please don't turn your back I can't believe it's hard Just to talk to you 'Cuz you don't understand

      Somtimes this house feels like a prison That I just can't leave behind There's so many rules I got to follow 'Cuz you can't let go  I don't wanna hear it And I just can't believe it All the stupid things you say but  One day I won't take this anymore One day I'll be old enough I won't have to run away And you won't be there to say I'm not allowed to One day  Sometimes I wonder if you know me Or if you just pretend to care Tell me are you on a mission to bring me down?  Go away Don't look at me 'Cuz we're not the same And you can't do nothing You can day That it's not okay But I'm not afraid And you can't do nothing Nanana... One day

      well thats what he says  but is it true? is it what i want? i tell myself it is, but... when i truly look at it  truly think about it is that what i want? do i have a choice? when im losing him forever, to a massive distance i dont know  should i even be caring? should this even matter? i dont know anymore im so confused thats what he says  but what would i have said? would i have said the opposite? would i have even responded? what will i do when i leave? give him up? ask him to remember me? what will b enough? will anything be enough? i dont know anymore  nothing makes sense anymore there isnt anymore time its now or never so... what am i going to do now?
