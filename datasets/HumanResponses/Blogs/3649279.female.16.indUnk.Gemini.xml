      sigh.i'm really very tired. i slept and slept. i haven't done anything related to red cross or school since yesterday afternoon. i'm happy. honestly, i love it when im sick. people understand. they give allowance for the period i don't feel like talking, the period i don't feel like making any decisions at all. the rare moments i can be happy. just lie in bed and read and sleep. so wonderful. it's probably due to my introverted nature. i'd like to go out and all. but not all the time. the energy is so consuming. so many problems, so many questions. no decision. no one wants to make decisions because they are scared people might question the decision and in turn question them. thats why i became the scapegoat. I guess leaders always put their heads on the line, and there's always bound to be people who try to chop it off. it's like a game played in the arcades, just that this time its real. I've been sick almost every month since december. i don't know what's happening to me, but i've read somewhere that its a symptom of stress. maybe i'm having it, but i really don't know how to get out of it. It's going in rounds.

      a fresh start. a new beginning. thatmailbox was not my top choice of  blog names..i wanted something to do with shine. haha. i have an obsession with that word. i have tried tucking my blogs away from the public's eye because of the apparent stereotyping that goes on with people reading my blog. But i guess its inevitable. OH well.  anyway..been surfing around the net the whole day..right now..andre's downloading my songs over msn so i have to wait till he finishes. maybe i should just leave the comp on and go and study. Our school has  been really slack with us this year...its weird. January we had chinese new year hols..February they brought us to Malacca..March they made us have a two-three day CIP thing which we did not have school but went around Bishan collecting newspapers and the like. April, we had sports day..and now..Its May and we don't have Mid years! The only gauge we have is our CAs and Prelims. I AM actually quite worried. I have not started any revision of any sort except trying to finish that everlasting pile of Homework. I have an idea where I am headed to...It's either RJC or SAJC. Although no matter how well I do, the odds goes to SAJC. I like the whole atmosphere of the school and how the school is just average. However I am quite worried of the whole environment and all.  Our bookstore dream is kinda like on hiatus..Because besides Grace and I..all our partners don't seem to be very enthusiastic about it. I guess it will change after 'O's right? It's gonna be fuN! the fund raising and all. If you want to help out..don't hestiate to email me! :) We will probably be having a flea market stall at Clarke Quay or anywhere to raise our funds..Don't really have any concrete plans yet but should come up with some soonn.. okay. i need to study. blog later!

      i can't believe it. this is the last week of the school holidays, and guess what. I don't think i even finished half of my revision at all. I have been living in dillusionment. I can't believe it. The rest of the week is spent on Red Cross camp, cell outing and i'm gonna pray that i'd finish my whole chem syllabus the last week too. Not forgetting readign all the lit stuff and the remaining homework. I hope i will accomplish that. I'd probably only finish my revision in..mid July if fortunate. There's no point droning away anyway. No more going out[even with parents] food will be delivered to my roomdoor. No more watching tv. and no more computer unless really neccessary or under my rest time. restrictions. restrictions. did i say i could be contained? Hang on.  ps. don't call me YING. i totally detest people calling me YING. yuck. if you really must, isn't Min nicer to call?   i crawled away from You. Now i'm crawling back. Seeking Your awesome presence once again. I want to feel You, know You, touch You Oh Lord, fill me with Your Spirit once again. That I may hunger for You. OH God, my spirit is willing but my flesh is weak. I am weak, but You are strong. Carry Me in Your Awesome splendour.

      i just watched simple life. pretty amazed that it was showing, i mean..i just switched the channel and stumbled on Paris Hilton and guessed it was the simple life and it was. Okay i must admit, it is really hilarious listening to what Paris says and the reaction of those people living there. At least  they din like scold them or anything. i mean likw.."What is a well?" or "What is Walmart?". don't their parents like give them tuition? I think the funniest was one a small black insect scared them out of their room and that little tyde went in with a swatter and killed the insect. haha so cute. Honestly, i feel quite sad for them. Not able to enjoy life as it is. Living on the high end with no regard to the world around them at all. Having a total disregard to what people consider normal becomes an insult to the people concerned. I mean, they were thrown into living a life of luxury,with a golden spoon in their mouth, shouldn't they like try to appreciate it more? maybe, there wasn't room to. i think trying to find out why would take a long time. all the people they know, how would you know whether they really like you for who you are or more like what you are. Isn't it scary? what people do for attention, for fame, fortune. The need to feel loved, wanted. Isn't that what God created us for? Terribly sheltered people. Painted faces. Plastic expressions. Scary. PS: it seems like the producers made the show to mock them. why do they want to do it anyway? MANS. theres a 2nd season too.

      hey charm! yay you posted..yes. i think we can both keep each other accountable. =] i can't believe it. I have not journaled for two days into my journal. Just because of that stupid illness that i had. My brain just died. All the thoughts I have just keeps running through my head to God only. I need to keep them. I feel so away from God when I'm sick. yes the frailty of man.

      don't know whats happening. i feel weird. haha my voice is husky. i seem to h ave lost all motivation to do any work. i sit here letting time pass me by. Hoping that time would freeze. but no it doesn't. it carries on. dragging me along with it. I can't seem to have that willpower to tell myself to start doing something. Instead of lazing around. can anything be done with effort? i don't think so. How do I want to revel in God's mighty presence and not work for it? How do I acknowledge it and not seek it so that it would grow bigger? What would i do next? start questioning His existence? This is crazy. my books has no flavour. Nothing has flavour right now. i need to go and take a walk. maybe i'd start liking this earth again. All the magnificent things God has created. soaking them in.

      its 12:36 and i'm wide awake. i'm getting sick again. bad sign. i don't know whats happening to me but its not normal to get sick almost every month. i don't know. i slept for 4 hours in the afternoon because of it and have not studied the whole day except going for Amath. I guess i shall try to pull through studying tomorrow along with feeling sick. have been reading friendster testimonials. don't know why. i'm so fascinated by those. maybe i crave for something more? to know another side of life that i've never experienced? somewhere that holds something so much more? i don't know. but to be contented. is a state of mind to be grasped.  i don't know how am i gonna be selfmotivated to study. I can't get to what Mrs Low's describe as a 10hour a day study plan. I know I have not reached the momentum I have wanted. Everytime i seem to be scaling up that curve..i get sick and everything drops down again. I h ave never escalated to the limit and stayed there yet. It's a scary feeling. But I rely on God's strength and not mine. I pray He will lift me up. God really leads me to realise so many things that I would have never done so. Thank You Lord so much. I really don't know what am I gonna do without You. Remember Last year..I think if you weren't there with me, I'd probably have committed suicide. No its not an exaggaration. At one point of time, I felt so hopeless and I felt so deep into the problem that I did not rely on God and wanted to just end my life. What a silly thought thinking back. Thank You Lord that You are always there. Watching over me.  Sorry if i don't make any sense and are drifting in and out of topics. My brain is in stagnant mode. REally painful. I can't think.

      oh Lord I pray I won't leave your presence. I don't want to. I pray I won't be satisfied. that i'd continue to hunger for more of you. That the more I press on, my hunger will grow bigger and bigger for you. Tear down any barriers that hinder me from reaching you. Tear down any pride, any fear, any anxieties. Tear them down. Oh Lord you are so wise. I spent the afternoon scouting for SKS bookstore. I went to Campus Crusade and they did not have the book i wanted so they told me to try SKS. With only a phone number, i called and asked for directions. He said it was behind concorde hotel and i could try taking 64 or 65. This is the first time iw ent somewhere without checking the street directory. So I just trusted the man and flagged a 65..but he said he din go to concorde so i took a 64. after about half an hour, i reached Concorde and walked one big round to find the entrance to the factory. I cupped my hands to my forehead and looked up to find the bookstore. Ninth storey! hurray. When i looked back. I realised thats how faith is.  You are not sure where you are going, but you were only given the endpoint, with a few clues along the way. THe thing is that you have to trust God(the SKS guy), and rely on his strength to  carry on. Affirmations on it comes like when i board the bus and asks if it goes to concorde. After that, you have to rely on God(sense of direction) and just walk. even if you took a very long walk just to reach there. I hope it makes sense. God You are so awesome! By You I'm purified. I love you so, my everything. Your grace never fails to amaze me.

      why is there no one to talk to just when i really want to talk the most? but during these times when i want to talk to people..no one would want to talk to me.I guess its one of my thinking periods which people start answering my questions by..why are you asking that? as if im intruding into their life. I don't know. I'm just intrigued at other people's lives. Want to talk..but theres no one there to. sigh. If only there was someone whom i can talk to at this point of time even when i can't sleep at 3am or something and didn't mind me calling. a sacrifice.         i wrote another poem today..but its in my journal. I pray the adult leaders won't ask me to go for interview again since they actually approved but because my parent din allow me to go for Lcell until after os..because my journal is growing increasingly personal. It's the place i pour everything out to God..my life and my soul. everything. To deny Him, is like to deny that Singapore ever existed, which i c an never do. I know Him. I can't deny Him. I will talk about Him to everyone who wants to hear about Him. I WANT to. I don't understand why people just don't understand. "Shes gonna start her Christian stuff again.." But its the truth. I speak the truth. Why can't i have the basic right to speak that truth. We weren't made to be lesbians and gays. Its true. I know it. Deep down YOU know it. You agree with me, yet you say i'm 'preaching' Sigh..God impaired people. My auntie, who went to the miracle thing in our church, told me(and my uncles,aunties and my parents) that she believes those people who came up crying when giving the testimonies did some job behind the scenes. Thats blatantly untrue. How can someone do some job behind the scenes if like they were ALWAYS deaf or have a dying illness?! how can you deny that HE healed them. If HE did not, who did? Someone used magic scotchtape and miraculously stopped the pain? [okay i have to realise that its an open blog and not my journal] sigh. I can see how God feels. Not only have you thought I lied. You thought my God lied. I believe Jasmine when she said the Indian boy got healed. I believe Michelle when she said her father was used to heal a man from a growth in the knee. I believe the articles I read about healing. I believe that my God is real. I can't lie. The thing i don't like about people is for them to think i lied. I don't like people to lie to me too. My auntie lied to me about only pork porridge but it had chicken and i knew the porridge had a funny taste. It's not that i'm complaining. but im really irked at the fact that someone lied to me. I don't like it when people aren't honest as well, or people who TRY to take advantage of me. I really don't like it when people claim that i lie. I know it if i ever did. When i'm tearing because of the utter disbelief that i'm not lying, no i am NOT.      You know i thought about it before..about eating chicken again. TO tell the truth, i think it was because i wanted to make a stand. I don't know what. maybe its to find an identity? i don't know. but after all these years. its really not because of the bad experience anymore. it's more because of conviction? its because if i were to touch another chicken. people will go..orh hor..Ying Min ate CHICKEN! and start spreading. My words won't be credible anymore. I don't want to risk that. I guess i'm just a terrible non-conformist.     I don't like it when people try to size me up into a square box. that i'm required to perform only within those restrictions. that i'm this this and this. i cannot ever be that that and that. i don't want to be stereotyped. i'm yingmin. i cant be categorized into a adjective. i like to do things that people don't require me to. i don't like to be 'so yingmin' or whatever. i can't be contained.

      Search me know me Try me and see Every worthless affection hidden in me All I’m asking for is that You’d cleanse me Lord  Create in me a heart that’s clean Conquer the power of secret shame Come wash away the guilty stain of all my sin  Clothe me in robes of righteousness Cover my nakedness with grace All of my life before You now I humbly bring - Search Me Know Me by Kathryn Scott  How apt. Cleanse me Lord. I want to submit everything of me unto You. Even as I carry me with all my filthy rags, You welcome me with open arms. All the legalistic rules and regulations are nothing compared to who I am in You. Thank You Lord. Your grace amazes me.

      I don't know why I seem to be drifting away again. Lord tear down all my boundaries and let me step in with You. I feel so tired but everytime I talk about God I get excited again..Today i missed out on an opportunity, which i might never get again. An opportunity to turn the conversation deeper. yet i left it there as it is. A friend of mine said she will donate to world vision to atone for killing the snails...How God prompted me to talk about Jesus. I stopped and laughed. Looked and turn to another Christian friend who din say anything so i left it as there. How silly of I to have disobeyed Christ like that. THe thing wa s..no amount of good deeds or charity work was gonna save you from where you are going. Only the sacrifice of the Lamb can. It IS logical. I took a test and the test said i was a (logical) person. so yes, i believe in it with all my heart, its logical. I remember a martyr said this..yes you cannot see God but there's no question in not knowing Him. (paraphased by me) How true. I know God because He has always been there. I feel Him. I see the miracles He has done. The things He gives that money cannot compare is tremendous. I thank you so much Lord. I remember i'm supposed to pray for Singapore in my cell near National Day. I really have been thanking God so much and I will continue to do so, how blessed is it to be in Singapore. ONe of the richest nations in SEA. While people are dying around us, we ha ve prosperity. Yet so many of us aren't satisfied. We sleep in air-conditioned rooms. That's a luxury. We have at least one computer at home..so mnay facts and figures in Human Geography tells us how fortunate we are to be in Singapore. That we don't get persecuted. JAILED TORTURED like those house church leaders in Singapore. WHy aren't we satisfied? We go through all the pains to be skinny no matter how skinny we are already. Buying the latest fashions. Why follow fashion? You won't end up anywhere. The world says the more you bare the better you look. Rubbish. I know. because the Bible doesn't tell me that. He says 'we are beautifully and wondefully made' and God doesn't lie. I am contented to live in this world, because He has given me all that I could ever wanted. I await that day where I will meet Him. =] PS: We got nine people to sponser the child from World Vision! yay! But i'm gonna be a debt collector adding to my other responsibilities as a daughter, student, etc. hahaha not tat i'm complaining. Thank God we have opportunities to help the people in the other nations. go to http://www.worldvision.org.sg God bless

      everytime i think of something i eagerly want to tell the world by placing it in my blog. Everything is just so clear in my head, i know God can tell and undestand. But i never got to put down into something visible. My brain was( and is! haha) where i stored everything, and therefore there were only two readers. God and me. I know I'm going to be honest to God..and to people. I have been putting up a front. I know God has placed wonderful people in my life like my cell. so that the wall can be taken away. I see the bricks of the wall slowly..taken down piece by piece. the wall of pride, WILL be taken down, by my Lord God Almighty. I don't care if i am a leader in my CCA anymore. i don't care if this is going to lose the forced respect people have for me.I am going to sing of God's praises for as long as I live. And here i have found the place. People think that once you have become a Christian, you are SUPPOSED to be perfect. They will be, hey why christians are like that one..etc. But no, Christians are NOT perfect. I should know. We are the misunderstood but not the confused. For I am proud to say, God has given me life, I have never lived until I knew Him. HE knows of the countless times I have sinned, i felt anger, i administered my own petty punishments. everything. But regardless of all, I know deep down in me, God still loves me very much, and thats all that matters.  When i was reading Job one day, I just felt God's love so strongly in me..that I somehow know that if Satan ever repented (although we already know his fate in Revelations) God will still forgive Him. For even God accepted the worst sinners on earth, He would have accepted Satan as well. That is how great God's love is. I hope I don't start an argument about it, but isn't a blog where you write your opinions?  one day i was so overwhelmed by God that i just wrote this. 3.6.04 MY GOD!  He is powerful, who can defeat Him? MY GOD!  He is wonderful, who can measure to Him? MY GOD!  He is faithful, who can carry that torch with Him? MY GOD! HE is with me, wo can be against me? MY GOD!  He loves me, keeps me safe in His arms His love for me endures forever. I love You LORD! :)  An unmeasurable hunger sets in me. His love for me cannot be put down purely in words. I can't wait to go to heaven. I came back from Festival of Praise yesterday quite late..my mother was quite upset with me because of that. But the real event of the night started after my dinner when i started to talk to my sister. She has been a great support over this year and last. Praying together and talking..praying for each other(okay more of me) It was quite rare after she started working and coming home after i slept but today was one of those nights. Talked to her about what has God been doing around me and vice versa. We started thinking about heaven..and of God's love. haha. if i were to say everything i might not be able to get off the comp. After going for Festival of Praise..seeing 10,000 people worshipping one God ON EARTH! How much more magnificent would it be in heaven? I can't wait..reallY! I want to run that race for God so much more..until the day I am welcomed into His kingdom and He welcomes me with open arms and say 'Welcome, my good and faithful servant!' Oh i await that day.

      Apart from Him, I can do Nothing I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.   It is not US who is perfect, Its GOD. and God will bring about that change in us. THROUGH Him we are 'perfect'. Theres no other  way.

      was reading Rachel Scotts journal entries today..one of the martyrs in the Columbine shootings.God prepared her..the Magnificent Creator. The more I read, the more I yearn to get close to God. I hunger for Him. I hunger to get into the place where my hunger grows bigger and bigger. That i'll know and hear every heart beat of His. He knew me, inside out. Since Day one, walked with me through the shadows, walked with me through the glistening skys. He sees me..everything. From today, I'm gonna be honest with God. No more silly religious lines which seems so cliche now. Often people are led to think that once you become a Christian, you shouldn't have any imperfection..and its abnormal to fall into temptation. But no, even David did so. Even I did. Even You did. But MY God is perfect. Thats why He wants to mould my inperfection with His nail-scarred hands so that at the day I meet Him, He will welcome me into the feast with the saints. I await that day. I don't know whether I will be martyred for my faith. The thought still scares me. But if that is God's will, i'm sure He will prepare me for it, just like He prepared Rachel Scott. I really thank God so much, for all that He has done in my life. As i trace back those footprints, I saw how HE safely guided my paths, how He carried me upon His shoulder and walk through everything. I might not be rich, but I thank God that I have all that I could have.  He sees through me, every imperfection, every secret, everything Yet He accepts me, He redeemed me with His blood.  He is the Perfect Father, the Father who loved me even before I was born. At every temptation, I walk away from His arms, He reaches out waiting for me to go back to Him.sobbing. When I come back to Him, even before I say a word, He says nevermind and hugs me. How amazing His love is Lord..I hunger for you..I want to go into a new dimension Lord..someplace I have never been before with You..I long for you God..Lord I want to be honest with everybody, for You I hang my hook on, for You know me and accept me, I need nobody else.

      i feel betrayed. open myself up. yet you took me and tear me into pieces. with your blank smile at my raging pleas. how would i know that my friendship meant nothing to you. how somebody elses one meant even more. dashed. how for the sake of that friendship..you forsake mine. you forsake my pride for your forgetful ways. you manipulated me around your thin fingers. used. dashed. torn. [i feel so torn yet, i know opening myself up to you is worth it. somehow. one day] anothing thing happened. i just came back from serene macs. sigh. how i thought to myself. the night should be quiet. and with the group of friends. just not them. theres nothing wrong with them. i really love them to bits. maybe its the values. i feel so horrible. i might have said things i didnt mean to say. yet. for the sake of that moment. thinking about it, i realised. how friends influence you so much. how much we need friends who share the same values and you know wouldnt put you down? i can't subject myself to such things anymore. next time, as with all other times. i'd rather go home. every week i sit in that bus. thinking of how the day went. and me. talking to God about how much i failed in every way. in how i wish so much to be like Him, yet fail in my never ever perfect ways. How much it is really about God of not the things of this world. How much i want to do yet do not. as what Paul said about how he wanted to do what is right yet do not? All the things i say..that may have hurt others. yet i daren't write a letter to them to say sorry. its my pride. Oh Lord, tear that down please. everytime all the thoughts that sweep through me. appearing so clearly in my mind. dissipates when i reach this screen. maybe its the thought of sharing it with the whole world. hmmm. i can't imagine us having a party at ghans or yakkys house after prom. thinking about seeing others get drunk turn me off. like the first time the unassuming me went. i just cannot allow myself to get influenced. i cannot allow myself to even show my face at where booze is freely given. i will not. despite how adorable my level is, i can't forget my values for a few hours of fun. I don't think i will go out anymore. Concert and thats it. If im goinmg somewhere to eat. please make it quiet, calm, no put me down words. no feelings of neglect. and hopelessness. THose feelings were so strangely familar quite a long time ago. But now, Jesus gave me hope. I know some of you wouldnt believe me, but you have to feel it yourself to know. My prayer is that Jesus will be so real in your life that you will know what im talking about after you have experienced the hope that is within all christians who hold on to it. I felt so hopeless. like bleahs. i felt so unfeeling. neglect. my presence didnt matter. even my classmates were more forthcoming. pushed to become a wallflower. with God, and all my wonderful brothers and sisters in Christ. an anassuming ease sets in. Like God breathed air and blessed tranquility. it made sense. suddenly. maybe i need a Barnabas. would you like to be my Barnabas? =]

      haha. blog deprived. no God deprived. I need more of You.  just a random thought. did you realise that every time you complain about someone even when you quite like that person initally. but because you complained about that person, somehow the mnore you dislike/hate that person even when you actually un feel that person? its strange. i try my best not to do so. i feel bad when i feel a certain dislike to someone whom i dont have any distaste for. and when i resolved not to hate anyone since p5.  the night should be quiet. the night is so beautiful when you are out with a group of friends. just sitting around and talking. not noisy talking but just saying how you feel at that moment. thats the best thing that can happen at night. not parties. not loud techno. its just so perfect. looking up to the stars at whim. the tranquility of it all. how beautiful indeed. care to join me? =]  my mom says i need to lighten up..i certainly hope so..on 6th of August. =] let loose.

      hellos! -with the most smiley face i have- =] i realised i typed my entries so fast that my english seems to have deteriorated. blah. haha. the day had been quite okay..i think the highlight would be seeing the portrait of the machine marked at recess for 17/25. like yay, finally somewhere near the grades ive been getting for Lit last year. sigh, ive been doing badly..yes. B4 i think. my best subject. oh well. nvm. Oh yes. and receiving that letter about Thi Tuyet yesterday. yay! haha. we are gonna write her a letter this sat i think and if i ever get the time i might download the thing on here. shes really cute! and jolene calls us mothers. like, hmm. i feel that the people of this nation has so much prosperity that it has numbed the people from feeling anything to the plight of all the others in this world that are suffering even more. Maybe, im still young. but i don't see how i cannot help them when i can.&nbsp;i don't mind eating 5 dolllars less of food every mth. i really wanna go and visit these people..den maybe ill undersand it better. then maybe all this will come clear. there are always two choices to make. following the glamour crowd or taking the plunge and against the grain to go to the other side of this earth. i always felt there were two choices..and both are enticing. its difficult to try to choose both. anyway. ending  the battle has start. let the pieces start moving.  Lord, let Your power and majesty reside in SCGS. Your presence be filled so abundant. Thank You. God bless everyone.  Ying Min ps. charmie..where are you?

      sigh..two more weeks to POC. once again, i have mixed feelings. I don't know how many times i have used that term in my essays already. hahahaha. i'm a mixed mixed girl. After all these years, and now in Sec 4...and still in Red Cross. It has been such a wonderful experience, although sometimes i really wanted to give up. Like, gah. i ha ve all my CCA points. Now why do i want to get myself all this extra trouble. PLanning stuff, coordinating and blahblahblah. Sometimes i just want to give up because people have the extra time to study while I am obligated to do these things. Like putting the FINAL adjustment to the EUA plan. THANKFULLY. today. taking about 2 hours plus. Sigh. i don't know why its so difficult to do it though. TWO weeks. Everyone's making me sad. But looking back at how the unit is getting along. I feel like a proud parent. I really felt like an old grandmother leading the unit all this while. A naggy one to some people in my level who needs to be nagged at in order for work to be done. But thankfully, "I" "trained" some naggy grandmothers in my level during the process to do the chasing for me. OKay no. hahaha. If this year has been counted a success in the eyes of the bystander, I would give all this honour and glory to GOD. He pulled me through. He gave me strength, whenever i wanted to give up He pushed me up. I know I'm not a good leader. But if anything was a success. It was because God worked through me. I'm nothing without Him. absolutely nothing. NExt in line would be my levelmates. I'm really so proud and happy to be in my level. Seriously. THey are so super cool and lovable. I get frustrated sometimes when i demand their attention and they crapping around b ecause of Short Attention Span Disorder (SAPS [discovered by me]) but overall, i think they have been a tremendous supportive lot. Never fail to carry out the tasks assign to them. Even if they ever complained, which i don't think they did much. They would still go out to do it. During camps, our level just had this uncanny ability to work together. It's very very weird. haha. Everything just falls into place. And the coolest part of it all is that. Everyone fits in. There isn't like a particular groupie or anything. At least i don't think so. I love everyone of them. Although sometimes they drive me nuts but who doesn't have their flaws? I don't think anyone can get stressed in an atmosphere like this. Crazy levelmates! :) It's exciting to see the purposes and plans for each level being fulfilled. To tell the truth, most 'nurturing' comes from the camps. It's just so wonderful when you see from the reports how the desired effect comes fulfilled. And seeing them grow stronger. I'd certainly miss them. they are so cute. oh well. i'd update again when i get my thoughts cleared out. haha bye.

      hellos. everyone must must read the article on Esther Mok on today's newspaper. I think its a very good testimony of God's goodness and grace. At how something like SARS can be used to glorfiy His Name! superly tired from yesterday. haha slept for 11 hours in total. I was so tired that i can't really remember what happened during service and cell. I only remembered Pete. and hitting it five times day. =]   the past week has been pretty tough. I hadn't had a good night's sleep..maybe because i din properly schedule everything. I'm gonna make sure i do so this week or i'd be so tired. But the good thing is I did all my work on time and did more work than like previous months, which was good. I pray God will continue to be with us and guide us along this crucial period! God has really been with the SC cell and I really Thank Him for that. it's been wonderful being in our cell.   Anyway..an interesting thing happened this week.   The place where i sit in class is fantastic. However, the people sitting around me would sometimes eat in class. But everytime they would asked me whether i wanted to eat in class, i would decline(its a school rule to NOT eat in class). So, every break, i would be the only person in the class who could go to the corridors to eat since my class didn't have any prefects. One day, a group of people offered me to eat again, and i said no. Then they started to say somethng like..why are you so guai(i think its another word. but i can't remember). they waited for me to answer. so i answered. because God is watching me. Immediately, they exploded in laughter, and someone replied, Why would Your God help you when there are so many people dying in Africa? so i said, because He's omnipresent. I wanted to continue, but the conversation died off. God is always there. Before Jesus returned to heaven, He promised "  I am with you always, even to the end of the age." (Mark 20:28 NLT) He is with me, He is with you, ALWAYS. He is not Satan(who uses minions because he cannot be everywhere at the same time) But GOD CAN. He created his earth, the stars, sky and the moon. GOD IS POWERFUL. I hope other Christians would be law-abiding people too. That we can set a new standard to please God and to indirectly display God's goodness in our lives that can be evidently seen on how much we want to praise Him and glorify Him. and I hope I would continue to do so as well. You are so powerful. King of all Kings.

      haven't blogged for so long..so many things happened that i don't have the time to type them all out. bleah. i have a terrible terrible crave to play tennnis. yes. i can't believe i stopped playing for a year over. Tennis gives me life. when i play it, all emotions and feelings come. With a racket, i feel like i can beat anybody. It's such a overwhelming sport. I can't wait for Olevels to end.  Currently waiting for the soccer match to start. I'm rooting for Portugal. definitely. I might shift my allegiance of England to Portugal =X It's really strange how I grew up watching sports. I remember watching all the Man U matches with my cousins and watching my cousin then swooning over David Beckham =X hope she doesn't read this. haha. then with cable came the NBA days. San Antonio Spurs! i still support them anyhow. and the tennis days. My supporting system is very simple. I support the black horses, unless of course they are my favourite teams/players like Man U. I'm super non-conformist. like it or not. I do not like Mushroom Swiss.  creeping in, silence a picture tells a thousand words. this is a solemn one. where responsibility reeks in, suffocating the user.

      I was doing my tawg today..den I came across this sentence in the bible that said. "the earth is full of His unfailing love" Psalm 33:5..then i started asking God..why is the earth fulled with Your unfailing love? As i asked God, He began to reveal to me...It was because everything that is on this earth has His fingerprints. It's because of all the things He created is unique in everyway. Even twins don't look completely alike. Everythign was done so differently and uniquely. Look at how many animals, trees everythign there are! If God did not have unfailing love in us, He woulod have just grown tired and created exact copies of each and every one of us. He could have just like what mich says..photocopied us. But HE didn't. Everything you see if different and unique. Thats why our earth is filled with His unfailing love. If His love wasn't unfailing, He would have not bothered. The most supreme example was to die on that cross. Who on earth would go accept punishment to the extent of death for something He did not commit. How majestic is the Lord! :) i've been getting headaches today. I don't know why. I just cannot study when i start getting these headaches. English orals are in two days time..oh well.

People that I didn't even invite. might as well. might as well.    ahh. can't stand it anymore. childish isn't me. you can't be childish all the time. i made up my mind to open up this blog, a view into my thoughts, i needed to be honest. i'm not going to tell you rubbish things that aren't true. i don't understand why i'm not coherent at all nowadays. choices. there are alot of choices to be made. i can't waste time online. all this extra time i have now needs to be put to studying. i can do it. i can make it. postive self talk helps. trust me.

      still quite tired from yesterday..oh wells..poc's over. I still cannot feel any difference. maybe i would when i don't come back to school on saturday mornings anymore. more saturday mornings would help. haha. i feel quite sad that the lunch reminded me of camp..i feel quite sad that the sabo was marred because of all the colourful ponchos and no one attacking anyone at all. But the performance..took it over. It wasn't expected that at sec 1, you would write a two page letter. It wasn't expected that the sec 2s were really just so united together and good and they started tearing. i think cara. hhaa. and xuewen just kept stoning. sec 3s..did our items over again. I tink they tried their best to emulate all our items. oh wells. i don't know whether my letter was my best to them. I mean..i don't even think i was tactful enough since i didn't have time to read it twice to make it good, and doing it all at once did not make me more coherent. and i decided to give tracts..since i wanted to give postcards and i din have enough money and we[grace and me] were at SKS already..and I didn't have time to go out again. by night, i needed to be alone. all that was too mcuh for me. Having to be aware of people watching me and scrutinizaing me was very tiring. Can't let my guard off anything. it was very very tiring. i'm glad its over. i don't have to care anymore. seeing the juniors bring jolly shandy made me crestfallen. Okay, but i don't have to care anymore. or do i? they run their own life. But i will have no part in it. the silliest thing was that i think i took ONE HOUR to get home because i tried flagging taxis like mad for like 20 mins before going to the bus stop and then meeting peopel goign to michelles house to drink jolly shandy and staying over. hahaha.  den later taking a  bus and tried to take taxi again. bleahs. in the end i just took a bus home. buses are more reliable. especially on a friday night. haha. =] anyway, i'm happy now. Able to concentrate totally and be self centred for a while. Albe to mug now and not get interrupted by phone calls and having to do things. Able to take this time to really be with God although He was with me always. I thank Him. I really thank Him so much that He was there all the while. I couldn't have led the unit without His help. i was less than ordinary. But God made it possible. Thank You so much. I know you were tryign to mould me and I know somehow this is part of your bigger purpose for me and I thank You. People think that God is not real because they cannot see Him, but there's no question about not feeling Him. There's no question that people get healed. There's no question that every leaf is unique every person is unique and there is not a Maker to be seen. it's over. i have mixed feelings. haha...they really improved alot is all i can say. I feel very priviledged to be able to watch them grow. Thank You for giving me that opportunity. take care everyone.
