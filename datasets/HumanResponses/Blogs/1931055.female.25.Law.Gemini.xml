      Egad.  I have nothing suitable to eat for breakfast.    Need to run over to the local Giant and get a bag of frozen berries.  Raspberries, strawberries, blueberries.  Yeah.  They are delightful to eat with angel food cake, shortcake or even by themselves.      Mmmm.  Going now.  I am mad. Mad for Berries.    OK.  Got the berries and some "no sugar added" AFC.  Already have some coffee, gracias a Dios.  So what am I up to these days, aside from jonesing for specific breakfast foods?  Well, my summer won't be spent on the Main Line.  I'm currently residing in Camp Hill and writing a casenote for the VLS Writing Competition.  Post-casenote (i.e. post-Memorial Day), however, I'll start work in York at the Pennsylvania Immigration Resources Center (PIRC).    http://www.pirclaw.org/home.html  (Note to self:  I need to drop by the Widener or Dickinson Law Library and make copies from an Immigration hornbook.  Ira Kurzban).

       urlLink    The Diamond at Citizen's Bank Park. Pat Burrell leading off.  Took in a Phillies game back on April 17th and loved it.  Enjoyed my first CBP hot dog -- it was actually an italian sausage.  Pardon me.  They're more substantial.  Don't you think?&nbsp; urlLink

      Today.  I sped through tunnels in the Allegheny, Blue, and Kittatinny Mountains -- during an Appalachian roadtrip spanning the rolling green landscape of the Laurel Highlands.    A most pleasant drive on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  The trip originated in Monroeville (Pittsburgh burb)and terminated in Camp Hill (Harrisburg burb).  I will be driving this route happily and often this summer.

      DAY SEVENTEEN at PIRC   It's been a while, folks. I'll update you bullet-style:   o I turned 25 on 06.17.04 -- a quarter century. For my birthday, I was treated to a weekend in Baltimore. Saw the Orioles v. SF Giants at Camden Yards (SF won & and Bonds hit his first CY homer). That night, we took a water taxi ride across the harbor to Fell's Point point for dinner. The view of the city lights and shimmering water was stunning, and the "brown sugar" breeze was sweet (Domino's is nearby). The meal was fabulous.  Bertha's is such a fine establishment. Yours truly can eat mussels like a machine!  o I decided not to compete in the VLS writing competition. I completed 7 pages of the casenote and realized that I, unlike many others, have no desire to footnote, citecheck and bluebook my way to first-year associate stardom (i.e. fat paycheck). Also, I don't think I can be on a jounal and manage my time well enough to stay sane. The VLS/ILS Quarterly Newsletter could be a forum in which I could write, plus I must nearly devote my *life* to PIFP board activities and the auction. And I'm actually delighted about that.   o Work at PIRC is wild. The last time we spoke, I mentioned 65 NTAs that I had to process. Well, that was the result of "Operation Removal," a government sting that ws executed on or about 05.25.04 throughout all 5 bouroghs of NYC. Turns out that NYC parole officers and the DHS conspired (legally, yet disgustingly) to round-up any undocumented immigrant that is or was on parole for a crime that amounts to an "aggrivated felony" or a "crime of moral turpitute." So, if "Jose" -- born in Santo Domingo, DR, but lives in the U.S. with a green card -- was arrested 15 years ago for selling coke, did his time, reformed, got a college degree, got married, and had two kids (citizens)--he was called in by his old Parole officer on 5/25 just "to chat" or "to catch up." When Jose arrives in his old P.O.'s office, DHS agents pounce. Jose must go to immigration court; he is likely his way back to D.R., without the option of returning to see his children for 10 to 20 years.  Yeah.  Thank your lucky stars if you are U.S. citizen.  The Constitution actually applies to *you*.  o Never told you about the 16 year old girl from China. She looks 12 and is cute as a button.  And check this out: because a DHS dental enamel exam suggested that she was over 18, she was detained at an adult prison. Not right. These dental exams are bogus and the American Dental Association has said so in a public statement. Anyway, shortly after she recieved her final order of removal (FOR) and was paroled out of YCP, Nevhitz, S.M. and I took her to Target, the Galleria Mall, and to dinner at Subway. She was so grateful. Before we dropped her off at the Friendship House (local shelter for former detainees) we gave her snacks, summer clothes, and a cute pink hat. At present, we're trying to get her Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. Stay Tuned.

      DAY TWO at PIRC  (06.01.04:  My first day involved a prison tour--breathing stagnant air, encountering a few utterly joyless inmates, meeting the INS/DHS staff, the prison staff--and viewing a video on the Eloy Model, an administrative model for non-profit immigration law organizations (501(c)(3)s) developed in Eloy, Arizona by the Florence Project.  PIRC is based on the Eloy Model.).    PRINCIPAL PLAYERS:     Ian : Managing Atty.  Runs the show.  Incommunicado this week.  On the Honeymoon.  Allison : Exec. Director.  Total Sarah Jessica Parker doppel.  Our moral compass.   SM  (F): Staff atty and VLS grad.  A real diamond.   Ben :  Our soon-to-be "Sease-oned" intern 3L from Temple.  A real even steven.    Ethan : Undergrad from F&M.  Out for the week.  Destined for our dirty work and odd jobs. Good dirty work and odd jobs, though.    Nehvitz (F): Our sparky Turkish 3L from Syracuse.  Likes to sing "Roses" by Outkast w/ me.    Sarvhas :  Der.  Me.  Fighting through the good fight.    INTERNS GET SOLO TIME IN THE OFFICE.  Nehvitz and I were in charge for the day while SM and Ben were at the Berks prison to check on a case there.  We had to run over to the YCP bright and early to pick-up a HUGE pile of Notices to Appear (NTAs).  There were 65 or so.  Granted, I ended up  calling the INS hotline 65 x to log all the upcoming hearing dates; protocol for NTAs prior to our "Know Your Rights" Presentations, one of which is tomorrow.  I'll report on that infra.    We had no problem gaining access to the INS/DHS compound.  They were lovely and cordial to us.  When we came back later, however, to enter the women's wing of the prison proper, the guards told us to leave--even though we were there to see the same client the day before to talk about appealing her final notice of removal.    Just a little red tape. Ian and Allison forgot to update the PIRC intern list and apparently, someone in prison admin caught the gaffe that morning and told them to deny anyone not on that list.  Right.  It was funny--we even showed them our names in the sign-in book from yesterday.  Didn't matter.  We promptly left.  Thought they were rude, we had to be professional b/c our work there is a "privildge," not a right.   Good relations w/ the YCP is a MUST for PIRC to have detainee access.    We were told this on DAY ONE.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Shameless Website Feature : ElegantCheesecakes.com  http://www.elegantcheesecakes.com/index.html  Dude.  They can make you a San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown cheesecake.  I'm particular to the grand piano cake. The dahlia flower cake is cute, too. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   DAY WHATEVER @ PIRC  On Friday, your very own MLS filed a parole request with the DHS for a woman who narrowly escaped an FGM (female genital mutilation) in Cameroon. It was the first time I had *ever* filed a legal document in my life. It was a watershed moment.  Today, however, I got a call from a DHS parole officer saying that he filed for "ISAP" on Thursday and that our girl had already been approved for the Philadelphia ISAP pilot program. More or less, my parole request was denied. A day late. Was it for the best? Is this ISAP crap a better alternative?  ISAP stands for Intensive Supervision Appearance Program.  http://www.ice.gov/text/news/newsrel/articles/061704det.htm  Really, our girl from Cameroon deserved parole. ISAP requires an illegal immigrant with pending legal proceedings (i.e. current appeal) to wear a GPS device on their ankle and may limit their time outside of their sponsor's residence to no more than 5 hours. Blech! To be eligible for the program, the person must be a low flight risk and have weaker social ties than someone who would be paroled, otherwise.  Sure, parole usually has limits and requires a parolee to report a P.O. But our girl had not one, but two family friends that were willing to take her in. Honestly, I think DHS simply wanted to use her as a guniea pig for ISAP because her sponser is close to Philly. Philly happens to be one of six or seven cities that just implemented the ISAP program.  Meh.

      An omission, while not a lie, is certainly deceitful.  And too much deceit (i.e. more than one instance) could turn a once-worthwhile endeavor into a real a waste of my time.  Gah.
