       urlLink    Ronald Reagan&nbsp; urlLink     Ronald "Dutch" Reagan, the 40th President of the United States (1981-89), died Saturday from complications of Alzheimer's-related pneumonia. Reagan, both the oldest president and the longest-living ex-prez in U.S. history, was 93. Or as Reagan himself would have said, "The 54th anniversary of my 39th birthday."  Reagan's death shows the true spirit of American politics; leaders from all sides are praising Reagan for his life as a visionary and as a positive role model. In a way, those praises are true; even I found Reagan to be genuinely hip and hilarious in his lighter moments.   For all his wit and charm, however, Reagan was a terrible president. Before Bush Deuce took the all-time title, Reagan set the standard for cluelessness in the Oval Office. The same positive qualities that he had refined as an actor (and had endeared him to so many average Americans) were the perfect front for a right-wing, feed-the-rich administration controlled by people who Reagan unfortunately trusted in that cheerful way of his. Poor people, the working class, the middle class, minorities, women and even most Republicans suffered considerably under his economic policies. Most of the time with a smile on their faces. Reagan gave us all something to take pride in, even if it was all bullshit. We wanted to BELIEVE. Many of us still do.  For all of our political differences, Reagan was a human being. Anyone dying is a tragedy, no matter who they are. And I will honor the dead just like I know the conservatives will when Bill Clinton dies. Reagan was a tough man who cheated death many, many times. He was also very open-minded; from his flirtation with the American Communist Party in the 1930s and his days as a liberal movie star to his McCarthyism and his eventual total shift to the right, Reagan never left a political stone unturned.  For a thorough account of the Ronald Reagan presidency and the 1980s, check out "The Clothes Have No Emperor" by Paul Slansky. It's a day-by-day account of the decade that brought us, well, the eighties.  Rest in Peace, Gipper. At least you weren't Nixon.

      My sister recently finished eighth grade. This is a yearbook picture of her school's 4-H Club. My sister's not in the club (and, fittingly, not in the picture). Still, this picture struck me for the students' appearances. Notice that every single one of them dutifully wears their uniform and ID as if they were in the deepest levels of NORAD. Guess there's much more going on at those livestock shows than I thought...   urlLink    test shot 2&nbsp; urlLink     I don't understand the point of having to wear ID cards and school uniforms. Administrators say that it's to foster a sense of security and to ease anxiety over clothing choices. Come on, does anyone really doubt that these kids are bona fide students and are not, in fact, criminals? Would keeping non-students out (the purpose of wearing IDs) have affected a thing at Columbine High School in 1999? As for the idea that uniforms equalize fashion, I have four words: jackets, shoes and jewelry.   The sad irony of all of this is that none of it works; having to pick up my sister early one day, I got lost on campus and walked through what turned out to be the girls' gym locker room. Between classes. When all the students were milling about. With no duty teachers asking me, a grown man, if I needed help. The solution to school security, I think, is simpler and more cost-effective: the use of intuition among teachers and personnel.  I never had to wear a school uniform and I didn't have to wear my ID until 10th grade. But I turned out fine!   urlLink    test shot 1&nbsp; urlLink     School officials should quit drooling over discipline and focus on the really important aspects of education, such as, uh, education.

       Next Wednesday's column, today...   Could anyone have imagined three years ago that we’d be where we are now? Well, just me and about 200 million other Americans. This year’s election cycle looks to be just as predictable. As crusty old Aunt Gertrude used to say to the Hardy Boys, “Mark my words!”   June 2004 —Turncoat Democrats Zell Miller and Joe Lieberman form a group called Baffled Americans Concerned Kerry’s Status Takes Away Believability. BACKSTAB is a coalition of Democrats who not only oppose John Kerry, but also actively seek out his death so that the Republicans win for at least the next 16 years. They intend to do this, Lieberman says, “For the health of the Democratic Party.”   July 2004 --Amid much infighting, the Democratic National Convention kicks off in Boston. Final toll: 26 dead, 164 injured. Kerry, the last one standing, accepts the nomination.   August 2004 —A Kerry advocacy group begins selling t-shirts with the infamous Abu Ghraib prison snapshots with “BUSH 2004—FOUR MORE WARS!” superimposed over them. The shirts, intended for Kerry supporters, nevertheless sell out with Republicans who are even prouder to wear them.   September 2004 —The Republican National Convention commences at Ground Zero in New York City. Toby Keith’s rousing opening performance of his new song, “Real Americans Ain’t Liberal or Brown,” brings down the house. John Ashcroft leads in the Pledge of Allegiance, repeating “Under God” 60 times before continuing with the rest of it.  Keynote speaker Karl Rove, standing at a lectern made from beams of the World Trade Center and with several New York firemen standing beside him, decries the Democrats for politicizing 9/11.   George W. Bush wins the nomination in a unanimous delegate vote. In his acceptance speech, he speaks of wanting “the world to come together in the ever-lasting crusade against terror,” though the words don’t necessarily come out in that order.   October 2004 —The third and final presidential debate pits a knowledgeable and relaxed Kerry against a smirking, hysterical Bush. Though Bush’s comments consist almost entirely of creative combinations of the words “terror,” “nuclear,” “fear,” “tax” and “cut,” he is considered to have won the debate. Analysts say Bush’s down-home folksy demeanor was a refreshing contrast to Kerry’s “superior intelligence and snobbishly correct pronunciations.”   10/28/04 —Simultaneous poll results from Gallup, Zogby, the Associated Press, the New York Times and ABC show Kerry ahead of Bush by between 85 and 90 percentage points.   10/29/04 —Matt Drudge reports that sources close to the janitors at the Pentagon might have heard something about them saying that Donald Rumsfeld is hinting that rebels supposedly caught Osama bin Laden. But he isn’t sure if that’s what he heard.   Ten minutes later —Fox News crawl: “DRUDGE REPORTS BIN LADEN CAUGHT! PRAISE BUSH!”   10/30/04 —October surprise! As it turns out, bin Laden’s been in custody of the Israeli Army since October 2001, but Cheney ordered them to hold him until the election. When this is discovered, Cheney is praised for his tough leadership.   10/31/04 —God pays a surprise visit to “The O’Reilly Factor,” telling host Bill O’Reilly that under no circumstances should anyone vote for Bush. Viewers take this as a test of faith, and Bush climbs in popularity.    11/1/04 —After months of careful and thoughtful consideration, Fox News endorses Bush for president.   11/2/04 —George W. Bush wins the election with 17 percent of the popular vote. Kerry comes in second with 81 percent. The steep spike in Bush’s votes is credited to the capture of bin Laden and God’s non-endorsement.   11/3/04 —Bush declares a permanent state of Armageddon, offsetting the need for his second inauguration or any future inaugurations.

       The following is from a book I've been writing for about five years. Not that you would know it from reading it...   My family hates grocery shopping with me. Hell, everyone does. This is totally understandable, for I am the biggest label freak alive. I’m not so much referring to the Nutrition Facts as I am to the list of ingredients. Personally, however, I can’t understand why anyone wouldn’t be. I mean, has anyone really thought about what goes into processed food? I didn’t until I was in college and had a food budget somewhere between starvation and the gross national product of Antarctica. Go figure. But the fact remains that processed food is infinitely bizarre. As a picky eater, I can’t imagine what I’d do in a country without a Food and Drug Administration. Because even in a place where the content of food is heavily regulated, we still eat a hell of a lot of trash. Take a look at just one example, chicken. Look how many different varieties exist!   BONELESS CHICKEN BREAST —The best, in my experience. Having this in the ingredient list assures you that the meat will be thick, juicy and—most importantly—identifiable.    CHICKEN BREAST WITH RIB MEAT —One step down from the above, this is superior chicken meat mixed with rib meat. Rib meat can best be described as wannabe breast meat. If chicken meat were Toyota cars, chicken breast would be the Corolla, whereas rib meat would be the Camry. Advice: just pretend rib meat is breast meat. That’s what the rib meat wants you to think anyway.   CHICKEN MEAT —So far we have looked at the high end of processed chicken. This is where the other end starts. Any time an ingredient list says “meat,” you are probably in deep shit. Not literal shit, of course—that’s further down the list. What you have with “chicken meat” is the politician’s answer to a turd: polish it. “Chicken meat” can be found most frequently in soups, frozen dinners and cheap cutlets. This is strictly chicken for those who don’t bother to read ingredient lists. Which is just as well, since this broad definition doesn’t rule out neck meat and other equally enticing nether regions. When you see “Chicken Meat” on your label, you know you’re in Toyota Tercel territory.   CHICKEN —This isn’t quite as specific as “chicken meat,” simply because this apparently doesn’t contain meat. For all we know, it could be nutria meat that got scared on its way to get stabbed.   CHICKEN BROTH —I have to say upfront that I enjoy chicken broth. This is a good thing, too, because do I really have a choice? It’s in damn near everything with chicken in it. When I was a kid, I asked my mom what chicken broth was; she assured me that it was just the stuff that drips from dead chickens. I would later find out that this was not true; what they do is take the unused parts of the chicken, MASH THEM TOGETHER and THEN collect the drippings. Cup of soup, anyone?   While we’re at it, who in the world decided that we had to use EVERY PART of the animal in the first place? Is this some kind of conservation measure? Out of respect for nature, you know, after killing the poor thing? Vultures don’t do that shit. They leave the rest for the food chain. It’s called fertilizer and mulch! Bury the beaks and noses and eyes and feet and spleens! Grow some vegetables so we can eat those too! But nooooo…we like to use everything when it comes to carcasses. We are nothing if not resourceful. Human ingenuity, then, is to thank for the chicken categories below:   CHICKEN FLAVOR —Not sure what this is, but it always seems to be accompanied by enough MSG to choke China, so I’m assuming it comes from chickens that ate a lot of Ramen noodles.   CHICKEN FAT —Literally, fat from the chicken. For some reason, found most often in processed food that already contains chicken meat and chicken broth. Somehow this flies in America. But for processed food supremacy, it’s hard to top the all-time, undisputed, underrated champion of bad nutrition:   MECHANICALLY SEPARATED CHICKEN —If chicken broth is the collective dripping of inedible chicken mashings, then mechanically separated chicken must BE the inedible chicken mashings. Found in hot dogs, vienna sausages, cheap jerky, chicken noodle soup and other fun foodstuffs we’d rather not associate with it. Were it not for that other Great American Made-Up Food, Artificial Coloring™, heaven only knows what color this “food” would be.   End excerpt...

      Can anyone explain to me what is so appealing about SUVs?   Is it the lousy gas mileage? Is it that it gives the driver the feeling that, not only are they invincible, but that they must also actively hunt down every smaller car on the road? Is it the massive hugeness that surely must compensate for some personal shortcoming? Surely there must be a reason that Excursions and Escalades still sell in the era of $2 gasoline! Help me out here...

      Some people have asked me about the Web sites I visit. Because these people tend to not wear badges (at least not where I can see them), I assume it's safe to give away my trade secrets. For offbeat news and opinions, you cannot beat the following sites that I visit daily:   urlLink bartcop.com  (liberal opinions with legit links)  urlLink dailyrotten.com  (REALLY offbeat news and daily history)  urlLink democraticunderground.com  (self-explanatory)  urlLink politicalstrikes.com  (photo toons with hilarious captions from a top comic letterer)  I also recommend  urlLink Yahoo!  and  urlLink MSN , because they (and a few of the other mainstream Net sources) generally play it straight.   If you're conservative, you'll like  urlLink Free Republic --the distant, inbred cousin of Democratic Underground. You'll also like  urlLink Newsmax  and  urlLink The Drudge Report , sources that get one right once in a blue moon. These three outlets put the "crap" in "crapshoot." Hey, just trying to be balanced just like  urlLink Fox News ! Oh wait...

      I am often asked why the conservative columnist, John Hinson, and myself don't do point-counterpoint in the  Vermilion  each week. This does seem tempting, considering we have side-by-side columns and almost completely bipolar positions on just about everything. While I'm not necessarily opposed to doing that, here's my reasons for not making a habit of it.  Back when I started writing for the Verm, the newly coronated editors decided that the then-conservative columnist and I would do point-counterpoint every week. But while it worked a couple of times, it ultimately failed for several reasons: 1) The choice of topic had to be agreed upon. This often took days. 2) What riles up one person might bore the hell out of the other. 3) When addressing the other side's points, the columns became too personal or outright unreadable on their own. 4) Not all issues are black-and-white, nor do I always want to write about straight politics. For example, I have also written about football, driving and school survival, just to name three.  I don't generally go for anything that limits the scope of a writer's columns. All columns should stand on their own and reflect the writer's most educated interests. It's how the pros work, or should.  By the way, if none of this makes any sense to you, then check out the opinion section of  urlLink http://vermilion.louisiana.edu

      Welcome to the site that is finally going to spark the Internet Revolution--Ian McGibboney: Not Right! You probably found this site one of two ways: 1) I begged you to visit or 2) you just happened to Google-search "McGibboney" and it led you here. Either way, sorry!  Who am I? I'm a graduate student in Louisiana currently trying to establish myself as a world-famous freelance writer. Which is kind of like aspiring to be a world-famous truck driver; but hey, it worked for Elvis, didn't it?  Since June 2002, I have written a weekly column for the University of Louisiana-Lafayette  Vermilion . I toil under the oh-so-imaginative title of "liberal columnist," so as you can probably guess I write about politics. Usually. Because of this column, I am very well-known around campus. Much like Monica Lewinsky is well-known around Washington DC. When I'm not sharing my wisdom (cough) or running late for class, I am a government-beat reporter for a state newspaper and work as a manager and videographer for two local sports teams.  This site, however, is not about me. True, I love myself and all, but I want to keep the topics limited to things to which we can all talk about and relate. I don't want this to turn into a badly self-indulgent version of livejournal; instead, I plan to throw an issue out as often as I can--anything that catches my eye.  In short, I established this blog because I am an information addict. And as you know, we live in bizarre and often-depressing times. I'll tell you upfront that I am very upset about the current state of American leadership. At a national level, we have leaders that use fear to tell you who to worship, what to believe, what to buy and who to support. This has led to disastrous decisions that have taken thousands of lives and have ruined countless others. I believe strongly in "live and let live," yet never have we been so far away from this ideal. So with this blog, my objective is to make sense of this big dirty trick we call life while keeping a happy face. Feel free to join in at any time!

       urlLink    "I'm Jesus, and I approved this message"&nbsp; urlLink     The rise of the religious right has brought with it a disturbing notion: that the President of the United States, in addition to being the political and economic leader of the free world, must also be morally infallible. The roots of this belief are not entirely unmerited; any good president should have some moral compass that prevents them, for example, from  urlLink acting out fantasies of a warmongering dictatorship . But in the eyes of the fanatics, presidents must also have an impossibly perfect personal record. In other words, they must be Jesus.  The Jesus in question is not the historical one revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews alike as a paragon of love, peace and tolerance. I’d vote for that man in a heartbeat. Instead, they refer to the divine messiah Jesus Christ, the omnipresent son of God, who can create and destroy universes with a wave of his hand. Their version of Jesus reads  urlLink Jack Chick pamphlets  and nods with ecstatic agreement. He is the artist of Armageddon who will wipe out Israel and those filthy pagans at midnight next Friday. Yes, the Jesus they believe in holds no bones about destroying the entire human race in the name of love.  Jesus for president! Wouldn’t he be such a perfect fit for this “Christian” country?  Not according to our laws! Isn’t it amazing how, theo-smackers’ arguments to the contrary, Jesus could not be the president under our Constitutional law? For one thing, the Constitution mandates that a President must be at least 35 years old. Legend has it that Jesus was 33 when he got double-crossed. Also, the president must be an American-born citizen and have lived on U.S. soil for a minimum of 14 years. Where was Jesus from, Bethlehem? Galilee? Nazareth? Steppenwolf? The Promised Land was somewhere east of America. It certainly was not in, say, Utah.  But let’s assume we did the Christian thing and gave Jesus a divine break from Constitutional law to allow him to run for president. Would he? Given his advocacy of humility, I doubt it. Assuming he did, however, his platform—peace on earth, good will toward men, love thy neighbor, don’t do bad things—would NEVER fly with  urlLink the conservative theocrats . They’d just accuse him of being a long-haired, hippie peacenik Jew who bucked the godly ideals of the United States of America. Imagine the top story on  urlLink The 700 Club : “Jesus: is he the anti-Christ?” Not even Jesus would be perfect enough for his most fervent followers to be President of the United States. No wonder they’ve settled for such guys as Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and Gary Bauer.  Again, I wouldn’t mind seeing Jesus as president. The religious right wants moral absolutes and Jesus is the perfect person to give it to them. Only, I think, Jesus would be (bad pun alert) a hell of a lot more forgiving than his self-proclaimed lobbying group. His tolerance for religions would be much closer to the ideals espoused by the Bill of Rights than the hellfire and damnation often preached in his name. And, as he notes in  urlLink Matthew 22:21 , he clearly supports the separation of church and state. Jesus is my kind of leader for sure!  On the other hand, I wonder if he could even grasp the idea of democracy, a concept completely absent from the Bible. Religion, in general, tends to favor an autocratic deity who rules with an iron fist over a terrified and appeasing populace. Then again,  urlLink our current leadership  has no grasp of democracy either, so why not give him a try? Jesus for President!

      All right now...I know that one of the most popular presidents in American history has died. And that we've had more than 10 years to prepare for this moment. But even I'm surprised at the unabashed worshiping of Ronald Reagan that's all over the media.  And as it often does,  urlLink The Daily Advertiser  is leading the pack with its tackiness. Check out the  urlLink opinion section  of today's issue:   "Reagan was responsible for setting Louisiana on a conservative path"  --And of course they are treating this like it's some kind of accomplishment! They trace the late 20th-century Republican torch as being handed off from Barry Goldwater to Reagan, conveniently leaving out a certain  urlLink not-a-crook  in between.  The always-frightening Kathleen Parker asserts in her column that  "Ronald Reagan gave nation a spirit of optimism, courage" ...not to mention a quadrupled deficit, a decimated environment, feed-the-rich economics and too many other things that can't be listed here without employing mind-altering drugs.  Rounding off this lovefest are two cartoons--one with a weeping, suit-clad elephant holding his hat to his heart with a button announcing Reagan's passing. The other one illustrates a cowboy-hat-clad Reagan wearing a pin that says, "Heaven is now Reagan country." Yikes. I find it funny that so many religious people are going ga-ga over the man as if he were Jesus incarnate when Reagan himself used religion and faith mainly as political tools. Oh well, none of that matters anymore. The man is dead. No one can ever criticize Reagan ever again.

      June 9 marks the first issue of the UL Lafayette  Vermilion  for the Summer semester 2004. The issue is the first of four that will come out this semester, being that it comes out every other Wednesday rather than weekly as it does during the year.  The paper is currently under new management, and the newly coronated dudes in charge are open to suggestions. Here are mine. Throughout the new issue, witty space fillers acknowledge the ongoing layout shifts. One I especially like says, "Please be patient while we edit our staff. Thanks,  Vermilion ." Which sounds eerily ominous of a series of layoffs, but I know that the excellent, highly competent and godlike editors of the paper would not do such a horrible thing to its most faithful sycophants, er, writers. Anyway, on with The List:   Strengths:   1)  The cover -- Kind of a compromise between the old newspaper layout and a tabloid. Once they get the flag fixed--way too much empty space, guys--and possibly a lettering that does the name justice, the cover will look tight.  2)  The cover story -- Extremely sad though it is that the cover story had to be about a mother's grief over a recently murdered student, it is good to see the Verm tackle something weighty. To my knowledge, this is the first pilot issue of a semester in years that didn't use the front page to honor the previous semester's outstanding graduate. The shift toward the controversial can only improve the content (not that they forgot the outstanding graduate--that's on page three). This content seems stronger throughout the paper.  3)  The masthead -- I have always strongly opposed the move by the Verm several years ago to eliminate staff writers' names from the masthead. When I started at the Vermilion back in 1998 (when gas was cheap and we walked to school in the snow), the masthead had the names of literally every person involved. This included the editors, staff writers, photographers, cartoonists, circulation people and business associates. Before I got to UL, I wanted to be on the Verm just to join that community of names. It gave me pride to belong to it. Then, for some bizarre reason, they just quit doing that and put only the editors' names in. This was the beginning of the editor-centric policy that has often caused friction. But I'm happy to say that this is now being reversed, bit by bit. Good. I like knowing who writes for the paper.  4)  More room for comics -- Does justice to the intricate strips.   Weaknesses:   1) I think that everyone involved with the paper deserves to be in the masthead. Yes, this is possible, and in much smaller space than is now being allotted for it. At least it would make us columnists and cartoonists feel less like lepers. As far as I can tell, those are the only two groups not listed. The outgoing editor-in-chief made us feel bad enough when she left us (and only us) out of her farewell letter.  2) The layout itself looks like it's going through growing pains. Headings look disjointed and are sometimes illegible. I don't think anyone's to blame for this; it appears to me that the printing plant's computer was missing the font for bylines and headings (which was a common occurrence when I ran my high school paper). Work on that and you're golden. Hopefully you'll choose a thicker font too.  3) One of the guys' names in "Sounding Off!" is what is known in journalistic terms as "not there." That section, additionally, looks like it was cut and pasted. Nas-tee.  4) We aren't world famous yet.  Overall, I think the  Vermilion  is moving in the direction in which it needs to move. I commend the new brass for its willingness to take a chance, as well as for putting up with my exceptionally picky ass. Thanks peeps! Can't wait for June 23!

       This entry and the one underneath it are two columns that I never published. They are rough drafts, often written in a single go. From time to time, I will write something long and at least halfway decent, but ultimately decide not to use it. This can happen for several reasons: the time might not be right or has passed, I can't finish it for whatever reason, I'll save bits and pieces for later columns, etc. My computer is packed with such loose ends, many of which have portions that will eventually see the light of day. I picked these two to share with my reader (not plural!) for two reasons: 1) they offer light into a writer's process and 2) they're as spent as they're going to be. This one is a distant forerunner to the 9/10/03 column "How to date like a Democrat." I wrote this draft between 8/30/03 and 9/1/03. Note the blunt language and sexual innuendo, two things that would have been instantly blanked from the Vermilion (motto: "The only family college newspaper in the United States"):   If you still harbor any doubt about how far we still have to go, think back to the 2000 “election.” If you had asked anyone then why they voted for Gore or Nader, they would say things like “I like his economic policies” or “The environment is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.” Perhaps they would refer to their chosen candidate as “the best candidate for protecting not just my rights, but the rights of all.”  Ask a Bush voter the same question and you’ll hear, “Bush is for beefing up the military, and I’m in the military.” Or, “I play the stock market and he’ll be good for my stocks.” Or even, “No reason except that Al Gore is such an asshole.” But most Bush supporters stick to the officially approved platitudes such as “he’ll make the economy grow” and “he’ll make America stand tall again.”  Standing tall. What is that shit all about? You hear it all the time from conservatives. “We need to stand tall. Candidate Blapadap will make America stand tall once again. Enough with this sitting down!” But what does it mean for a country to “stand tall?” The answer you might get from the standers will always be something along the lines of “Someone who gets things done.”  In my last year of high school, our school district got a new superintendent. He was an old-school Nazi straight from the Texas School of Stereotypes. One of my new classmates had fled from his school district only to find him right at her new school, a whole state away. The first thing he did was cut off funds for overseas abortion providers—whoops, wrong Nazi. Actually, he instituted rules about boys’ hair length that were so draconian that you’d get disciplined if a strand of hair fell out of your head and onto your shoulder.    TEACHER: Bobby, your hair is touching your shoulders. I’m going to have to write you up. BOBBY: Sorry. Smoking weed makes my hair fall out.   For girls, skirts couldn’t be six inches above the knee in a kneeling position. Why high school girls should ever be in a kneeling position in front of a school administrator is beyond me:   MALE TEACHER: Amanda, your skirt looks kind of short on you. On your knees! (GRABS ODDLY STICKY TAPE MEASURE) Hmm…five inches. That’s okay. I had a feeling it was long enough, just wanted to double check, you know? Don’t want chaos in this school. Anything over six inches can be hard to handle, if you know what I mean. (WINKS AT AMANDA, WHO BOLTS INTO THE HALLWAY)   And this was public school! I’d hate to know how the Catholic schools handled this.  In terms of real educational measures, however, the superintendent didn’t really do all that much. Still, he was praised because he was a man who “got things done.” Didn’t matter which things. I get things done in the bathroom. He did too, I’m sure. Maybe that’s what they meant.

       This wasn't so much a column as it was a skit; then again, I try to be unpredictable in print, so this may very well have been a column. It was written on 5/16/03, soon after Bush Deuce stuffed a sock in his fake flight suit and declared "mission accomplished" on an aircraft carrier near San Diego. Natch, it's all about the Iraq War. It may very well be the most naked satire ever written; but since when is nudity bad?   What if the War on Iraq was a typical gas-station holdup?  (Setting: A FUEL-N-FUN franchise, somewhere in America. A ROBBER storms in and guns down all but two of the store’s customers. The CLERK is an Arab-American male.)  ROBBER: All right, stick ’em up!  CLERK: Is this a robbery?  ROBBER: No, it’s a liberation.  CLERK: What?  ROBBER: A liberation! You know, I’m a liberator.  CLERK: And just what the hell are you liberating?  ROBBER: I’m liberating all of the food and beverages that have been held hostage here under your capitalistic tyranny! (Pause.) Now empty the register!  CLERK: You’re liberating the money too now?  ROBBER: Just do it! (CLERK swiftly empties money into bag and hands it to robber.) Now fill me up on pump one, please.  CLERK: You got it, buddy. (Pushes buttons on master pump board.) Thank you, and have a nice night.  ROBBER: You too. Appreciate it. (Runs out to car and begins pumping gas. CLERK stands stunned for a moment. ROBBER reenters store.) I almost forgot. One pack of Marlboro menthols, please. (CLERK hands over a carton of cigarettes. ROBBER heads toward door.)   CLERK: Hey, wait a minute…  ROBBER: (Turns head.) What?  CLERK: Didn’t you say you were here to liberate the merchandise?  ROBBER: Yeah, that’s what I’m here for.  CLERK: Well, then, how come you didn’t take any of that stuff? (Long silent pause. Then, in an accusatory voice:) It’s all about the gas, isn’t it?  ROBBER: No, the gas is just gravy. I’m really here because I care about the people who have to pay to get their food from you!  CLERK: Is that why you shot them all dead?  ROBBER: For their own good! But hey, you saw that one guy hug me and kiss me on the cheek. He’s happy that I have expelled you from the store!  CLERK: He only thanked you because you have a gun and you let him loot the store, dumbass!  ROBBER: Well, I’d love to stay and chat, but this store is sufficiently liberated. This store is now free to select a new clerk in a fully democratic job-application process.  CLERK: Heh.  ROBBER: Now it’s time to concentrate on Stop-N-Rob across the street. They need some serious upheaval. I mean, did you see the prices in that joint? Not only that, but they probably harbor the people that fled from here when I barreled in! Have a nice day.  CLERK: Well, hold on…I mean, you haven’t actually caught me. You just pushed me away from the register. Shouldn’t you nab me before you go across the street?  ROBBER: Nah! I got my gas, didn’t I? You’re irrelevant now.  CLERK: Gotcha. I’ll go call the police.  ROBBER: I already did.  CLERK: What?  ROBBER: I asked them for their help in this robbery to begin with, figuring they’d help me since they always have whenever I needed them. But when I want to commit one simple crime, they have the nerve to tell me no? Hah! Well, who’s the loser now? Ha ha ha! When you do see the police, tell them that sometimes you gotta act alone.  (Saddam Hussein portrayed the clerk. George W. Bush portrayed the robber. That Iraqi guy who shows up in every kissing-the-troops picture played one of the two store survivors. The United Nations performed as the police.)

       urlLink    All hail the red, white and blue!  And brown, orange, purple, teal... &nbsp; urlLink     In their endless quest to return America to the days of fictitious yore, the Religious Right has done everything short of replacing Old Glory. Well, at least until now. This new flag received national attention when it was the focus of a segment on  urlLink The 700 Club , a national TV program that is always on the forefront of today's trends.  "Our LORD's flag" was designed by Marcia Thompson Eldreth, who also calls her creation "The United States National Christian Flag 2003." This modern-day Betsy Ross wannabe is nothing if not an artist of the people; conscious of the fact that Joe Communion-Wafer might not be able to afford the flag, Eldreth has designed  urlLink a cheaper one  for us common folk. How nice of her! (Click link, then go to "description," cheapie.)  There's even  urlLink a special pledge  that our public-school kids can say every morning before learning about the Constitution in social-studies class. Click the link and read it, but only if you have an iron stomach, pilgrim.  As long as we're going to change the American flag, then we're going to need some  affectionate nicknames. Here are some possible options:  "Old Testament Glory" "The Stars and Stigmata" "The Union Jesus" "Passion of the Eagle" "The Cruciflag" "The North-Star-Spangled Banner"  Before I'm stoned to death, I just want to say that this is a free country; if you want to fly this flag, go for it. Part of what makes America great is that we can accommodate all theological leanings. But that also means that we aren't going to adopt a new national flag anytime soon. And if we do decide to adopt a theological banner, then I'll adopt a new flag as well--one with a maple leaf.  Ease your pain at  urlLink www.uschristianflag.com . And for the love of God, please don't tell them I sent you!

      From a blurb in the June 9   urlLink Times of Acadiana  :   The University of Louisiana at Lafayette launched its "Support Ragin' Cajuns" campaign with a bang last week...Hebert, athletic coordinator for UL, will be in charge of the campaign, which is accepting donations, though the signs are free.   "ALL MONIES DONATED WILL GO TO MAKING MORE SIGNS,"  Hebert says. "We believe that if the university thrives, the community will benefit."   Okay, so let me get this straight: we're launching a huge campaign to print signs to give away, and we're using the donations we do get to make more signs? How exactly is that supposed to raise money for us?  Oh, right. "It's good for business." My bad.

      I have a good friend who likes to forward prayers in her e-mail. She and I hang out a lot and have a lot of laughs, even if we are on nearly opposite ends of the whole religion thing. This excerpt is from her latest release; it's a prayer about what your five fingers remind you of and somesuch (insert your own joke here). I'm not a big prayer man, but I found this one compelling. The Five-Finger Prayer starts with the thumb and index finger, then goes to the middle finger:   3) The next finger is the tallest finger. It reminds us of our leaders. Pray for the president, leaders in business and industry, and administrators...These people shape our nation and guide public opinion...    Yes, whenever I see George W. Bush or any of his crew, my middle finger definitely comes into the equation. It's such an automatic reflex that the revival crowd would surely be impressed.

       urlLink    Say, George...how about a movie? &nbsp; urlLink     Usually I don't do personal posts, but this one is such a monumental event for me that I think it works. Tonight I saw " urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 " for the first time. I had high expectations which were not met--they were exceeded. If you have not yet seen it, GO! If you have gone, go again.  Lafayette didn't bother to show the film until yesterday, when at least one theater figured out that the number-one film in the nation might have at least a few fans here. I went to the theater this afternoon to buy a ticket for the 7:15 showing ($6.50, cheaper than the inflated $7.75 for "Passion of the Christ"). In front of me were a well-dressed middle-aged white man and a couple that looked fresh out of high school. They were both wearing shirts sporting Bible verses, and accordingly looked like the most innocent couple in this town. I began to feel afraid for my safety. To my surprise, all three were also there for "Fahrenheit 9/11"! That alone made me eager for 7:15.  In the lobby, presumably for the fourth, were girls and guys dressed in Uncle Sam and Statue of Liberty outfits, raising money with crafts and patriotic stars. I bought a $1 star from a sweetie dressed like Lady Liberty, who offered me a piece of cookie cake with flag-colored icing. Now that I think about it, she struck me like someone who represents everything that's right with America. Normally, I don't care much for people who go around peddling "America rocks!" t-shirts; but I got a feeling that this girl really meant it in the best way. Probably the most positive experience I've had around an American flag in awhile.  After getting my ticket torn, I followed three goth-ish hotties into the theater. They looked like the same kind of girls you see in college coffeehouses (though I saw them waiting for a ride afterwards--maybe they were younger than I thought). Even I didn't expect to see the diversity of the audience that I saw: people like me, of course, but also multiple ethnicities and ages. Perhaps most enlightening was the presence of a vast number of middle-aged white people. At first I thought they were there out of morbid curiosity; as the film progressed, however, that group was often the most vocal in their approval. Everyone seemed to be there in support of the film, which I didn't expect. The closest thing to opposition I heard was when two people behind me, before the film began, mentioned how some people were buying tickets for "Shrek 2" and sneaking into "F-9/11" so that Michael Moore wouldn't get any money. But those people were cheering later, so maybe they weren't referring to themselves. Another man made a snoring noise after a key allegation. But he could also have been clearing his throat.  The film was prefaced by the most commercials I've ever seen in a movie theater. Even odder, the commercials were for Nike, Coke and the U.S. Army (because nothing sparks a recruitment drive quite like a Michael Moore film). These were followed by previews for what must have been every Lion's Gate film coming out in 2004. But who can blame them? This is undoubtedly their biggest winner of the year and thus the best vehicle for cross-promotion.  The movie itself starts with with the Al Gore victory party in 2000. After showing footage of the reversal of the Florida call, the party is shown in reverse, with fireworks going back into the ground. "Was this all a dream?" Michael wonders.   Other highlights:   --Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, Rice and Powell get their makeup done before making TV appearances. We see Paul Wolfowitz spit on his comb and use it to slick back his hair!  --A clip from August 1992 of George W. Bush talking about the benefits of having his dad as president. He is very articulate and looks much younger.  --A clip of Bush throwing a horseshoe and then chugging a bottle of beer  --Footage of Bush taking his infamous August 2001 vacation, interspersed with the Go-Gos' "Vacation"  --Bush's May 2003 strut on the aircraft carrier in San Diego and his declaration of "Mission Accomplished" to the tune of "The Greatest American Hero" (best line: "It should have been somebody else")  --Michael Moore: "Do you have many problems at the Saudi embassy?"   Secret service agent: "I have no comment on that"   MM: "I'll take that as a yes"  --A guy in Michigan said he looked at news clips of a devastated Iraq and said, "That could have been shot here in Flint!"  --Two Marine recruiters who canvass a Wal-Mart, an urban mall and various parking lots, stopping literally everyone they see. One kid who isn't interested is asked for his personal information, supposedly to take him off the list. After he gives it and walks off one of them says, "Well, he's on the list."  --Powerful footage from the embedded journalistic team that Moore secretly sent at the beginning of the Iraq War  --Moore on the streets of D.C., first reading the Patriot Act from an ice-cream truck and later trying to get Congressmen to enlist their kids in the military  --A mother, whose military children are featured throughout, reading her dead son's last letter. Worth the price of admission alone.  --An ending that is officially the best use ever of a mangled Bush quote. Too witty for me to ruin here.   Coming out of the theater, I saw people talking like never before. Masses of them, including many who had apparently never met prior to tonight. I have not felt this good in a long time; knowing that this is going on several times a day, all over the United States, gives me the hope that we might actually defeat these bastards in 2004. Thank you, Michael. Thank you.

      James Dobson of the notorious  urlLink Focus on the Family  is back with another call to action. A very old one, apparently, with a twist that's only a year too late! Guess it all blurs when your agenda is to turn America into a gigantic church.   Apparently we are to be allowed to watch TV programs that use every foul word in the English Language, but not the word "God."    Guess they don't watch PAX TV!   CBS discontinued "Touched by an Angel" for using the word God in every program.   "Touched by an Angel" ran for NINE YEARS, from 1994-2003. That's a lot of God for such a supposedly decadent network. What probably happened is that this rare long-running show was nearing its logical end. Or maybe it had low ratings. I doubt its cancellation had a whit to do with CBS deciding that "Hey, what this network needs is too piss off James Dobson!" Though that, I admit, would be reason enough for me.   Madeline Murray O'Hare [sic], an atheist, successfully managed to eliminate the use of Bible reading from public schools a few years ago.   Um, no. First off, religious expression has never been illegal in public school. What O'Hair and many others petitioned for was the end of FORCED prayer. A huge difference! Second, this is not some new effort. O'Hair (along with her son and granddaughter) was kidnapped and killed in 1995, and the bodies weren't found until 2002. As happy as I'm sure you guys are about that, it proves that the effort to end forced religion is not just the by-product of an athiest-fringe group.   Now her organization has been granted a Federal Hearing on the same subject by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington, DC. Their petition, Number 2493, would ultimately pave the way to stop the reading of the gospel our Lord and Savior, on the airwaves of America. They got 287,000 signatures to back their stand! If this attempt is successful, all Sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by television will be stopped. This group is also campaigning to remove all Christmas programs and Christmas carols from public schools!!   If any one of you thousands of petition-signers bothered to do a Google-search on "Petition 2943," the first entry would tell you that it is an urban legend. This isn't even a new one; it's been around since  urlLink 1975 ! Proof positive that the religious right relies on half-truths and hysteria to further its agenda.   Together we can make a difference in our country while creating and for the lost to know the Lord.    Lost? Hey, I'm not the one stuck in 1975!   Please do not sign jointly, such as Mr. & Mrs. Each person should sign his/her own name.    Aw, isn't that so cute? If any wife I might have EVER refers to herself as "Mrs. Me," I will immediately get a divorce!

       This column will be in the 7-and-7 issue of  urlLink The Vermilion :   An interesting anecdote in a book about the Beatles (named, appropriately enough, “The Beatle Book”) tells about one of Paul McCartney’s childhood quirks. A left-hander, McCartney lived in a culture and age where being left-handed was some kind of stigma (this was before they were discovered to be far-superior people, of course). For the most part, McCartney adapted well enough, except when it came time for him to learn to ride a bicycle. See, young Paul insisted on pedaling backward.  Even in the face of numerous wipeouts and the frustrating lack of locomotion, McCartney was not deterred from his unique method of cycling. In fact, he went so far as to declare that everyone else was doing it wrong. Finally his father asked him why, if everyone else was pedaling wrong, they were staying on their bikes while he kept falling on his head. Paul got the message and changed his ways.  What compels a person to insist that what they are doing is correct even as common sense and physics prove them wrong? Is there never even a thought in the back of their minds that maybe they should question the wisdom of their actions? Fortunately for the Bush-Cheney campaign, the answer to that second question seems to be, “Yes, there is a thought!”  How will the Bush administration’s apparent admission of its errors be visible? Can we expect the beginning of the end of operations in Iraq? Will we see the end of a lopsided tax code? Will all Americans be guaranteed decent health care? Are big corporations finally going to pay a fraction of the taxes they should have been paying all these years?   Just joking! Actually, none of that has or will happen. So why do I think that Team Bush has seen the error of its ways?  The answer is in the nature of the Republicans’ new campaign materials. Because Bush’s term has been such a disaster, even they can’t sell themselves anymore.  Instead of focusing on the pertinent issues and on its man, the Bush “re”-election campaign has turned into “anybody but Kerry.” Look at  urlLink www.georgewbush.com ... “The Kerry Gas-Tax Calculator...The Kerry Travel Tracker...Kerry on the Patriot Act...Kerry: the Raw Deal...Kerry: Wacky...” I guess those third-party advocates were right after all; there really isn’t much difference between these two. Both are obsessed with the same candidate!  In debating numerous conservatives and libertarians over the past several months, I notice that one point comes up with regularity: that John Kerry is a man without a concrete message. Bush, they say, stands tall and firm on his principles. But they forget that there’s a line between being adamant in your views and just being damn hardheaded. Kerry showed that he is able to change his mind about Iraq in the face of revelations that the information was misleading in early 2003. For that he is being called a flip-flopper.   But that’s beside the point. The Bush apologists spend their debate energy harping on liberals liking Kerry only because they hate Bush. Because of the ongoing rift between liberals and moderate Democrats, this little anti-Kerry negativity works for conservatives in debates. The Bush campaign has caught onto this tactic and is now hoping that voters will pick Bush simply because, well, he’s not Kerry.  Like with everything else, Bush is steering the never-civil-to-start-with realm of campaigning (and, in turn, the national discourse) in a poisonous direction. Until we, as a nation, can garner the courage to stand up to Bush and say, “You’re doing it all wrong,” then Bush will continue to pedal us—backward—right into the ground.

       urlLink    Dammit! Lost my golf ball! &nbsp; urlLink     I have a year-end Lafayette High school newspaper from 1993 that has a story on the top 10 local events of 1992-93. One of these events was then-president George Bush visiting archrival Acadiana High School that October, complete with picture. Looking at the picture of the haggard Bush, with his hair disheveled and his face droopy, it's easy to see the defeat that he knew was imminent.  This picture is fresh from Bush's troubled NATO meeting this weekend. Judging by his facial expression, I'd say that NATO rejected his plan to launch a space-based incinerator to nuke all non-Americans. Bush sure looks like his daddy did in October 1992, except about 100 times worse. Pretty soon, flames will be shooting right out of his horns. Historically, presidents have aged considerably during their terms in office. If Bush Deuce is this stressed now, I'd hate to see how much worse he gets if we actually elect him president.

       urlLink    This cover just reeks of journalistic integrity! &nbsp; urlLink     Check out  urlLink this AP dispatch  on the anti-"Fahrenheit 9/11" criticism. The pattern that seems to be emerging is the same one that is currently pervading the presidential campaign: the right, faced with a lot of bad situations of its own and lacking answers, is turning its energy to discrediting the left. Specifically, conservatives are endlessly fixated on John Kerry, Michael Moore, et al. and trying to discredit them in ways that a middle-school bully would find lame (see cover, above). Whereas Al Franken did the same thing with Rush Limbaugh in 1995-96, his book was a meticulously researched volume with a lot of serious and verified information. Based on the above article, I don't foresee the likelihood of the same coming from the other side. (Excerpts from the AP article are in italics.)   On Tuesday, David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke will publish "Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White Man," in which the authors accuse Moore of "serial mendacity." The book is published by Regan Books, which also printed Moore's "Stupid White Men." Hardy and Clarke take issue with such matters as the timeline of economic events Moore presents surrounding General Motors plant closings in his home turf of Flint, Mich., in "Roger & Me"; the parallels Moore draws between the Ku Klux Klan and the National Rifle Association in "Bowling for Columbine"; and Moore's refutation in his book "Dude, Where's My Country?" of potential ties between Iraq and Osama bin Laden.   "Taking issue" with what Moore says is not the same thing as charging that he is a liar. They could simply object because they disagree. Many conservative books and videos (such as the obviously fake "Clinton Chronicles" from Pat Robertson) employ this rhetorical method to wink-wink-nudge-nudge readers into accepting things that are false. Meanwhile, they offer little of substance to prove that what Moore says is, in fact, false.   "He creates a false impression without ever uttering a word that is untrue," said Hardy, a former U.S. Interior Department attorney who runs the Web site mooreexposed.com. "Moore is a master of that."   As a former U.S. Interior Department attorney, Hardy would certainly know about splicing bits and pieces of half-facts together to make a case. As is noted at the end of this article, "Fahrenheit 9/11" underwent some of the most rigorous fact-checking audits undertaken this side of Watergate. Moore has a lot to lose by taking his work to such a massive level without making his case airtight.   Filmmaker Michael Wilson hopes to have his documentary "Michael Moore Hates America" in theaters late this summer as a rebuttal to "Fahrenheit 9/11." Wilson said he admired "Roger & Me" but found "Bowling for Columbine" troublesome.   Wilson's documentary, of course, will expertly rebut each and every untrue claim that Moore has allegedly made. With a title like "Michael Moore Hates America," how could it be anything else but a scholarly debate?   Moore's handling of a 6-year-old girl shot to death by a classmate in Flint particularly bothered Wilson. "Bowling for Columbine" implies welfare reform was to blame, detailing how the shooter's mother had to work two jobs and take a bus to another town to work, so she could not properly tend to her children, Wilson said. The mother had left her son at his uncle's home, which prosecutors described as a flophouse where occupants traded guns and drugs. The boy found the gun there and took it to school.  "All this stuff added up to her being a lousy mother. It had nothing to do with her having to work two jobs," Wilson said. "My mom had to work two jobs to make our lives better and guess what? I didn't shoot anybody. It felt like a slap in the face to all these people out there trying to make their lives better and live out the American dream."    What a smug prick! He missed Moore's point altogether. Moore was not implying that the boy shot and killed the girl because his mother worked two jobs; the segment in "Bowling for Columbine" shows that, because the mother had to work the two jobs, both of which required hours of commute, she had no choice but to leave her son in her uncle's house. Had she been able to work for anything more than welfare wages, and not had to spend so many hours in transit twice a day, maybe she could have stopped her naturally curious boy from making such a tragic mistake. But Wilson does use an interesting right-wing tactic: he resorts to using the old "slap-in-the-face-of-the-American-Dream" that's so popular among the haves of society. Besides...since when has welfare-to-work become the American dream?   Wilson, Hardy and Clarke, who say they are moderates with no political agenda against left-winger Moore, take a cue from Moore's approach, aiming to package their criticism in satiric humor.   In order for satiric humor to work, it must contain at least some kernel of truth. Clearly, the AP reporter was not impressed, having offered little example of this brilliant wit beyond an examination of the cover (likening it to the far-superior work of Terry Gilliam).   Moore declined an interview for this article, although he's previously said the film is "an op-ed piece," and not a work of journalism...   Moore only says this because he knows he will be crucified if he refers to any of his work as "journalism." His many critics will seize upon the first insignificant rift in anything he says and will try to discredit him forever. But, speaking from experience as both a journalist and an op-ed writer, I assert that Moore has done far more fact-checking and research than do most so-called "legit" reporters.

       Homeland Security anticipates terrorist attack right before election    urlLink Click here for full story and funny pic of Tom Ridge    WASHINGTON - There is an increased risk of a large-scale terrorist attack against the United States by al-Qaida prior to the Nov. 2 election “in an effort to disrupt our democratic process,” Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said Thursday,     More like, "An attempt to disrupt the Democrats' process."   citing “credible” but non-specific intelligence.   In other words, gossip.   Despite the new information, the government is not raising its color-coded terror alert status from "yellow," or elevated, because of the lack of specificity about possible targets, he said, adding that there is no evidence that the Democratic or Republican conventions are in the terrorists' crosshairs.    Okay, so who exactly is threatened? Don't we have a right to know?   Ridge said that in addition to the information, warning signs have been raised by the pre-election terror attack in Spain earlier this year...   Red light! Spain not only didn't suspend its upcoming election, but actually saw a new, more liberal party come into power. That, right there, shows me that GOP forces are definitely going to try to capitalize on this.   "This is sobering information about those who wish to do us harm," Ridge said. "But every day we strengthen the security of our nation."    By "security" they mean "destruction of rights."   Ridge denied any political motivation.    Rim shot, please!   “We are basically laying out before the general public the kind of information that we’ve received,” he said. “And it’s not us — these are not conjectures or mythical statements we are making. These are pieces of information that we could trace comfortably to sources that we deem to be credible.”    This is the second time in the article that Ridge has said this! Is Ridge repeating himself out of urgency? Or because pathological liars tend to repeat things in order to convince both the public and themselves? See "Kampf, Mein."   “ There’s, obviously, no reason for panic, or paralysis ,” Frist said...   Obviously!   “The country is at some increased risk between now and the time of the presidential election. It’s important for people to be aware of that.”   For all we know, Ridge could be talking about the GOP and PNAC setting booby traps to ensnare potential Kerry voters at the polls.   “What is clear is that law enforcement has generally been notified."   Generally. Except, perhaps, in the blue states.   And Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, who was briefed on the threat earlier in the day, told reporters that “ there’s, obviously, no reason for panic, or paralysis .”   Man, even the PRESS is repeating the BS on purpose!   Elaborate plans are already in the works to protect the Republican and Democratic party conventions in New York and Boston, which have been classified as National Security Special Events. With the designation — a concept that evolved from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta — comes federal funds, increased preparations and heightened security.   Wait a minute--didn't they just say that neither convention has been targeted for terrorism? That was almost the first thing Ridge said! It's good to know that they're looking out for themselves Frist, I mean, first.

       urlLink    "Look at all these rumors, just doggin' me every day..." &nbsp; urlLink     The  urlLink New York Post , the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid that once led its front page with John Lennon's morgue photo, reported in yesterday's issue that John Kerry had picked Richard Gephardt to be his running mate. The Post got it right, except for the whole Dick Gephardt thing. Kerry, in fact, chose John Edwards. But what else can you expect when newspapers are so desperate to scoop the competition?  I bet Murdoch's already got a cover set for Nov. 3, "BUSH DEFEATS KERRY," that Kerry can hoist above his head (a la Harry Truman) after he whips Bush.    urlLink    From  urlLink picturehistory.com  &nbsp; urlLink     Knock on serious wood.

I saw it for myself on Rush's site late yesterday, where the story around it had been changed. The photo's since been removed altogether from his home page.   Compare this photo to the real one in the entry below. The one above clearly shows evidence of photoshopping, and mediocre photoshopping at that (note Edwards' thumb and left shoulder)! I have done better manipulation work in two minutes. And what exactly was Rush trying to prove by having Edwards' hand in Kerry's face? Something, probably.

       urlLink    John-John is back!&nbsp; urlLink     From John Kerry's official e-mail, at 8:22 a.m. on 7/6/04:   In just a few minutes, I will announce that  Senator John Edwards   will join me as my running-mate on the Democratic ticket as a candidate for vice president of the United States. Teresa and I could not be more excited that John and Elizabeth Edwards will be our partners in our journey to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.     I want you to know why I'm excited about running for president with John Edwards by my side. John understands and defends the values of America. He has shown courage and conviction as a champion for middle class Americans and those struggling to reach the middle class. In the Senate, he worked to reform our intelligence, to combat bioterrorism, and keep our military strong. John reaches across party lines and speaks to the heart of America -- hope and optimism. Throughout his own campaign for President, John spoke about the great divide in this country -- the "Two Americas" -- that exists between those who are doing well today and those who are struggling to make it from day to day. And I am so proud that we're going to build one America together.    Long before I endorsed John Kerry or Wesley Clark for president, I pulled for John Edwards. The grapevine says that Edwards will be able to pull the southern vote; in the last seven elections, the winners have had southern connections:  1)  Jimmy Carter --Georgia 2)  Ronald Reagan --one-time Dixiecrat from California 3)  George Bush --Texan, however marginally 4)  Bill Clinton --Arkansas (VP Gore--Tennessee) 5)  George W. Bush --Texas  As much as that fact bugs me, I accept it as reality. And it is a shame that we won't get to see a Clark-Cheney debate. But in any case, John Edwards is still an exciting addition to this team. A fresh infusion of Edwards' left-of-center positions can only help the already-strong Democratic campaign. Kerry-Edwards 2004...it's got a nice ring to it!

      Independence Day represents the true essence of Americana. Whether it's celebrating a day off among family and friends, the excessive consumption of processed meats cooked over fossil fuels, and/or watching colorful low-level explosives rattle the night sky in our neighborhoods and Manhattan alike, July 4 is a full bucket of flag-waving nirvana!   I skipped most of that this year. True, I was technically with my family (most of us still share the same house). And I did eat hot dogs and hamburgers, being that I've been too broke lately to buy much else. But instead of seeking out a family party like I do every year, I decided to stay home and repair a flat tire on my bicycle.  I took my bike out to the driveway and laid out my toolbox and shoebox full of bike parts. Directly across the street, I noticed that my neighbor, a doctor, was having a massive get-together. Of the estimated 30 cars I saw in the big circular driveway, 28 were SUVs. The huge kind. The two other vehicles were an equally large redneck truck and a luxury car. You could smell the conservatism wafting like the barbecue aroma emanating from the backyard. I turned to glimpse my "John Kerry for president" bumper sticker, which was plainly visible to the party-goers. That would have been an enticing target for a sniper's scope. Still, I bravely hunched in the shade behind my truck to conduct the routine business of fixing a flat. The course of events that transpired made me wonder if life truly does have it in for us liberals:   1)  The tire tube, despite its lack of air, exhibited a different puncture every time I tested it.  2)  My patch kit was out of adhesive and I couldn't find the rubber cement that I see every day when I  don't  need it.  3)  My sister and dad were attempting to reinstall a computer, with about the same luck I was having with my bike. They called me every five seconds to fix problems...of course I can fix  other peoples'  problems...  4)  Once I found the cement and patched the tube, I tried to pump it with my hand pump. No dice. I tried my miniature electric air compressor, which worked the first time. When I put the tube back in the tire, however, the compressor suddenly failed to work.  5)  When I finally got the compressor back to work, the cigarette-lighter plug on it suddenly and inexplicably flew apart, thus completing my descent into Lucille Ball-esque slapstick. Mission aborted. Meanwhile, the presumably GOP celebrants across the street kept on partying unabated.  Guess Bush was right--it's apparently better to wave the flag and to fire up the coals than to try to fix things and save gas. Quite a moral for our times!

      You may have never heard of the  urlLink National American Football League .&nbsp;Formed in 1999, the NAFL's motto is "For the love of the game." More than 90 teams play in 22 separate divisions. Who plays on all of these teams? Anyone who wants to play football at some post-school level and has the drive to do so. The league offers inexpensive Saturday-night&nbsp;football action and a chance to support a genuine grassroots sports league. If you have a local team (and, chances are, you do),&nbsp;check them out! The NAFL offers opportunities to players and coaches that wouldn't&nbsp;otherwise be available&nbsp;in the age of multi-million-dollar salaries.  &nbsp;  My local team is the Louisiana Swamp Gators, who are in their inaugural season. They are&nbsp;coached by former UL Lafayette standout Keno Davis, and I am their videographer (an unbeatable combination!)  &nbsp;  Check out the NAFL  urlLink site &nbsp;and support community football. While you're there, stop by the discussion board. They even have  urlLink a thread on Fahrenheit 9/11 !  &nbsp; Tonight the Swamp Gators travel to New Orleans to play the Louisiana Hurricanes. See you on the field.

      Amid much speculation over the past few days, former NFL head coach Mike Ditka has officially decided  urlLink not  to run for the open U.S. Senate seat in Illinois. The seat had recently been abandoned by Jack Ryan (R-Ill.--an ill Republican) after polls showed that, in light of&nbsp;his  urlLink sexcapades ,&nbsp;even Osama bin Laden would beat him. &nbsp; I can't say I blame him; his last campaign wasn't all that good. Fellow New Orleans Saints fans know exactly what I mean. Remember when Ditka rolled in on a bus with a giant mural declaring, "Now it's made of IRON"? Remember how great we all felt in the summer of 1997 when Ditka announced that the Saints were going to the Super Bowl&nbsp;in his first&nbsp;year there? Damn, that was awesome. &nbsp; But then 1997 came. And 1998. And 1999. Then, about five minutes after the 1999 season ended, the Saints had a new coach--Jim Haslett. And Ditka had a new job at ESPN. Ditka's withdrawal is probably the best thing to happen both for himself and the people of Illinois. &nbsp; Oh, and he's supposedly not even registered to vote in Illinois. Oops. Oh well...that never stopped Rush Limbaugh (proud voter since 1986)!

       'Traditional marriage' amendment declared too unconstitutional to be in Constitution     urlLink     Marriage is bee-tween a man and a woman!  Even if she is mah daughter... &nbsp; urlLink      On July 14, the Senate finally put to sleep the lingering carcass that was the Defense of Marriage Amendment. Hopefully this is just the latest in a chain of common-sense rulings that will defuse the religious right's hostile takeover of the United States.   A few days ago, my good RR-aligned friend--whom I've mentioned before--sent out an e-mail forward to advise us to tell our Congresspeeps how we felt about the idea of gay marriage. I don't think she expected our mutual friend--a former conservative I helped convert, embarrassingly enough, while she was the conservative columnist at the Vermilion--to reply as she did. "Thanks for the heads up," she said, adding that she told all of our reps just how pissed she was over the continuing erosion of separation of church and state. Amen, sister. Uh, I mean, thanks.   And as my last few libidinally influenced pictures prove, I am a heterosexual. Do I think that gay marriage will destroy the sanctity of my wedding in a faraway decade? Nah. I'll leave that to Britney Spears.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For much more on this subject, visit the  urlLink Hot Abercrombie Chick&nbsp;

      I know, I know...Lately I've been beating to death the point that conservatives are namecalling jerks uncaring of any opinion but their own. But, almost daily, I find a new blog that just continues to prove me right in spades:  Today's link is to a particularly excremental blog. How excremental? For one thing, its name is " urlLink Face It. I'm Right. You're Wrong. End of Story. " This title is not tongue-in-cheek either; indeed, I failed to find even a trace of humor on this site. But that's not all! Its subtitle is "What more is there to say? Shut up, I don't even care." And true to that last statement, the blog does not allow comments. Nor is there any profile information; of course, who  would  take credit for this shitty blog?   But it's the entries that are the worst. They veer from agonizingly lenghty articles quoting hack right-wing think tanks to the usual "Michael Moore sucks because he's fat and unshaven" slop. He (too dumb to be a woman, for sure) apologizes for Bush's lack of intelligence by citing the lack of college degrees among liberal celebrities. One post even blames the popularity of file-sharing (and subsequent profit losses by those poor entertainment barons) on John Lennon!  To recap:  1) This site declares, "Face It. I'm Right. You're Wrong. End of Story." 2) The author says, "What more is there to say? Shut up, I don't even care."  3) No comments allowed 4) Posts are of the right-wing, fact-free, "liberals all suck" variety 5) The author is anonymous and apparently afraid to be held accountable  Yep, he's a good little conservative.   Note: The reason I'm mentioning this blog is because of my belief that you should always know your ideological enemy. I'm not about censorship, and I'm glad that blogs such as the one above exist. Yeah, I'm tearing him and his paranoid ways down; but I'm also linking to him twice. Furthermore, I wanted to preemptively declare that I did not set up that site as a joke, as much as it may seem like it. All hail freedom of speech!

      Yes, you read  urlLink right !  Ronald Prescott Reagan, son of the late Ronald Reagan, will be delivering a five-to-eight-minute speech at the Democratic National Convention on July 27, the second night of the event. Reagan also said that he would not attend the Republican National Convention's planned President Reagan orgy in September.  Through the years, Reagan has been known for his outspoken progressive views which completely oppose everything for which his father stood. By his own account, Reagan is doing all he can to get Bush out of office this year. Reagan, who says he did not vote for Bush in 2000, says that Bush's policies are a gross distortion of President Reagan's. Ron differs most publicly from the Republicans on the issue of stem-cell research. Stem-cell research might have allowed the elder Reagan to chat with Christopher Reeve on a morning jog, except that the religious right doesn't consider that to be pro-life.  A Reagan speaking at the Democratic Convention! In 2004! Opposing all of his father's tributes! Isn't politics fun?  [Exit Republicans, incredibly embarrassed.]

      This is from a thread on  urlLink IMAO , a popular right-wing blog that epitomizes the conservative style of debate these days. This thread, dated 6/7/04, is called  urlLink “Know Thy Greats: Ronald Reagan.”  Even for a Reagan tribute it is utterly sappy; if that were its worst attribute, it wouldn’t be such a big deal. But what makes this thread particularly interesting is the hatred and ugliness (or is it piss-poor satire?) that IMAO and his brethren apparently cannot avoid for more than one sentence at a time:   * As a lifeguard in his youth, Reagan saved 77 lives while letting 12 Communists drown. * Reagan's aides told Reagan not to call the Soviet Union an "Evil Empire", but Reagan couldn't help it. They were just that damn evil! * Now that Reagan is in Heaven, we can be assured that, once we get there, it will be free of Commies and hippies.   The following 40 responses were in the same vein. Usually I am content to let the sap run; after the 40th god-bless-Lord-Reagan-may-he-co-reign-in-heaven-with-God post, however, I had to break it up. These people were drowning in twin cesspools of sentiment and anti-progressive invective. So I wrote this:   Sorry to burst this big lovefest thread but... Reagan was a terrible president. He was the smiling face behind a jingostic, xenophobic, reactionary right-wing administration. Just because he is now deceased does not and will never change that fact. And despite what your boy Rush says, the 1980s were NOT a decade of robust and uninterrupted growth. In fact, two of the largest recessions since the Great Depression occurred in 1982 and 1987. Reagan championed the crackpot supply-side economics theory that even George Bush called "voodoo economics." Bush Deuce continues to destroy the economy with Reaganomics today. I guarantee that every single one of you posters were and are being screwed sideways by this insane thinking (unless, of course, you're in the top 25 percent). But I know that none of this is going to change any of your minds, not in this level of discourse. After all, Reagan was a champion of the right, and they can do no wrong. If you really want to be the kind of American that Reagan wanted us all to be, the first thing you'd do is recant his policies.   “That should start up a shitstorm,” I thought, grinning. To make a long story less long, here’s a sampling of the several posts that followed:    “Who let the dirty hippy in?”... “Ian, my taxes say you're wrong…Also, when I read your name, the first thing I thought of was a Gibbon (a primate). Gibbons are funny.”…“Ah yes, Ian is so much smarter than the rest of us knuckle-draggers. See, he was able to memorize all those words...hmmm...I wonder if he actually knows what they mean? Most liberals do not.”… “I also guess that it would be pointless to clue Ian”… “And I suppose that it would be a waste of breath to advise Ian”… “it would not be worthwhile to let Ian know”… “That was priceless truthspeak Ian.” … “Whaddda mook!” … “So says every book that Ian has read, and dagnabbit, he believes it.” … “all of us get our talking points from pundits like Ian does” … “Yeah Ian man”… “Looks like you and your lazy little socialist hippy buds are the only ones getting ‘screwed sideways’ by not moving out of your mom's basement and getting a job.” … “all of the lazy little bastards like yourself would be fertilizer in the killing fields when the next Pol Pot or Stalin steps up to the plate.” … “all you freakin' hippies” … “an old hippie econimist named John Maynard Keynes” … “all the freakin hippies” … “you mindless, ignorant, lemming.”    Wow! Of course, they offered more than just the intense Ian fetish; there was also the contempt for spelling! Most of them appeared in the few posts that actually attempted an informed argument (showing that they took the time to write), strengthening my belief that many hardcore conservatives look down on spelling as a sign of excess intellect. And I guess some of these words ARE pretty hard to spell:   “hippy”…“a Demon-cratically run congress broke it's promise to cut spending and instead… “respectible” … “the liberal icon B.J. Clinton… “they now critisize GWB”… “has exceeded explectations”… “the last report on job's”… “that underachiever John sKerry”… “attitute" … “sucess" … “attacts” … “Cristians” …“hippy”…    At least one dude, “Bill,” had my back. He richly cited death statistics from Reagan’s dealing with the contras and others in Central America. And what was the informed rebuttal that came his way?   “Bill, if I had the time, I'd disprove your words point by point, but I don't. Suffice to say, I remember. I was around then. And what you're saying is utter bullshit.”   Much like most right-wing debate these days.

       This new column, for the July 23   urlLink Vermilion ,  is a sharpened version of my July 3 blog entry. I don't know know if this a good or a bad writing trend. What do you think?    The 411 on ‘Fahrenheit 9/11’   The summer of 2004 has been a dynamite season for cinema. In any year, summer is the time to escape the heat and reality for a dose of escapism. However, one of the biggest movies of late dispenses with escapist cinematic elements in favor of a head-on collision with reality. That movie, of course, is Michael Moore’s “Fahrenheit 9/11.”  Lots of people, however, would dispute the notion that “Fahrenheit 9/11” is at all based on reality. The main criticism of the anti-war documentary is that it is not balanced. The bulk of this criticism comes from those who watch Fox News, MSNBC and CNN, and who thus know all about bias. Is “Fahrenheit 9/11” biased? Yes. Is it false? No.  My suggestion is that anyone who wishes to weigh in on the issue should see the movie and compare and contrast it with what they already know and believe. “Fahrenheit 9/11” is a delicious part of a balanced breakfast; complain about the cereal only after you’ve had a bite. Disney sought to deny us the opportunity when they refused to release the film, and Ray Bradbury publicly dissed Moore for copping the title “Fahrenheit 451” from his book about suppressing information. Talk about free publicity!  I saw "Fahrenheit 9/11" for the first time on July 3, an experience that exceeded my high expectations. What made the experience so special to me wasn’t so much the movie—well, that too—but the feeling I got just by being there. Like “The Passion of the Christ,” Moore’s flick is a major tug of the belief strings. But where “Passion” was a literal preaching to the choir, “Fahrenheit 9/11” aims to convert.  Lafayette didn't bother to show the film until a week after its release, when one theater figured out that the number-one film in the nation might have a few fans here. In line in front of me were a well-dressed man and a couple that looked fresh out of high school, both clad in shirts sporting Bible verses. The trio looked ready to pounce on me if I bought the wrong ticket. To my surprise, though, all three were also there for "Fahrenheit 9/11"!  In the lobby were people dressed in Uncle Sam and Statue of Liberty outfits, raising money with crafts and signature stars. This was a July 4 fundraiser for the troops, and I purchased a star from a very sweet girl. I was not the only one, proving that even critics of the war can and do support the soldiers.  I didn't expect to see the diversity of the audience that I saw; perhaps most enlightening was the presence of a number of middle-aged professionals. At first I thought they were there out of morbid curiosity; as the film progressed, however, they were often the most vocal in their approval. Everyone seemed to be there in support of the film, which I found surprising. The closest thing to opposition occurred before the film, when someone mentioned how some people had bought tickets for "Shrek 2" and then snuck into "Fahrenheit 9/11" so that Michael Moore wouldn't get paid. Amazingly, I didn’t hear one instance where anyone jeered what was being said.  Coming out of the theater, I saw people amassing and talking like never before. Whether they agreed or disagreed with certain issues, they at least were talking. Knowing that this is going on several times a day, all over the United States, is perhaps the most rewarding experience to come out of the film. Thank you, Michael. Thank you.

      For the latest developments in that burgeoning sovereign paradise we call Iraq, let's go to the tape!  Before:  -Saddam Hussein was on the loose -The Ba'ath Party ruled with a tight and tyrannical fist -Elections were a sham -The people were not permitted free expression -Basic necessities, such as food, water and shelter, were often in short supply -Thousands of innocent Iraqis were killed in the name of the country -Saddam's torture chamber was in full swing -At the onset of war, Saddam Hussein fled the country for his safety  Now:  -Saddam Hussein is out of U.S. custody -The Ba'ath Party looks to be back in power soon -Elections are a sham -The people are not permitted free expression -Basic necessities, such as food, water and shelter, are often in short supply -Tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis were killed in the name of freedom -Saddam's torture chamber, under new management, is in full swing -At the onset of sovereignty, Paul Bremer fled the country for his safety  Now THAT was $87 billion well spent!

       You know what bothers me?  People who, in the most&nbsp;loaded presidential election in history, are still clinging to third-party candidates. What bugs me even more is that the people who are the  most  third-partisan are left-leaning types who are determined to spit on John Kerry.   Are there really those who are so uncompromising in their ideas that they are going to take the time to visit their polling station and cast a vote for Ralph Nader or David Cobb? In 2004? As if that's going to accomplish anything else besides securing another vote for George W. Bush? And all because they think Kerry is just too mainstream!&nbsp;Do the Democrats&nbsp;not deserve votes because they want to appeal to a broad base of constituents, the United States? That's a strategy and-a-half there, Cochise. Maybe if&nbsp;these third-party&nbsp;voters force us into four more years of Bush, maybe then we'll see just how evil Kerry is. Thanks for the head-up!   Yeah,&nbsp;I know and understand that&nbsp;they don't like Bush.&nbsp;Neither do I. But why all the hatred for Kerry?&nbsp;Isn't this exactly the kind of in-fighting that the Republicans are counting on to whip us? After all, it was the GOP that recently managed to get Nader on the ballot in Michigan. Think about that!   Of course, maybe it's just because&nbsp;they want to make a statement. How's about this for a statement: "We don't like Bush. He's bad for the country, so we're going to vote in Kerry. He's not our favorite, but he's better than what we have now. We're&nbsp;paving the way for our pick for next time." Because if&nbsp;they blow this one, I don't think&nbsp;the third-party types are going to get the same level of respect&nbsp;they got&nbsp;after the 2000 election.    You know what bothers me?  Debating libertarians. It's easier to debate the most extremist political science professor than it is to debate the average libertarian.&nbsp;I have issues with the libertarian philosophy, which is basically two parts liberalism with a major dollop of right-wing  FUCK YOU  thrown in for good measure. I believe in self-sufficiency; however, I don't see the harm in helping another human being from time to time. Or the idea of community.   The reason I dislike debating libertarians is that they know everything.  Everything.  These people have so much historical text memorized and drown you in so many terms that even if you make a totally flawless point--one that would make Karl Rove fall on his knees and beg to the heavens for forgiveness--you'll get the stinging rejoinder, " urlLink  Within the context of my piece, your statement makes little sense and given the brevity of your reponse I'll try and extrapolate what it is you are in fact trying to say. Forgive me if I'm incorrect   ."  Then they'll ask you to define every word of your statement ("What exactly do you mean when you say, 'foreign policy?'") and inquire as to how your comment fits in with John Adams' interpretation of "The Leviathan."   What's most puzzling to me about all of this is that I have a degree in journalism with a minor in political science. I took  five classes alone  on political philosophy, and learned everything about men from Socrates to Hobbes to Machiavelli to de Tocqueville to St. Thomas Aquinas. And I don't know  one-tenth  of the shit that these guys spew! Of course, that's mostly the lousy libertarians; the really good ones actually have something to offer and don't cloud it as much. And at least they care, which brings me to my next point:    You know what bothers me?  People who are proud of their ignorance. I actually overheard a friend of mine at a party say, "Well, I don't agree with&nbsp;a lot of things that&nbsp;Bush does, but he's all about, 'God Bless America,' so he's all right with me." Good--um--God! When you know enough people like that, you begin to understand why Bush is such a lock with people who normally wouldn't associate with the antichrist. God, God, God. Say it loud and there's music playing! Say it soft and it's like--well, you get the picture. Of course, when  I  say God, somehow the mere mention of his name fails to elevate me among&nbsp;my fundie friends. Funny how that works; why is it&nbsp;Bush can get away with atrocities in the name of God, yet&nbsp;I'm the heretic for voicing a different opinion?   Another example of ignorance is the half of America that takes pride in not voting. Now granted, two-thirds of these people are probably doing the country a favor by staying away from the polls; still, why do people brag about it? And what is the deal with the politically active who chose not to vote in 2000, because no candidate appealed to them? In other words, no one running agreed with them 100 percent on all issues.&nbsp;How petty is that?    You know what bothers me?  That, in this new and improved Moral Murrika, Whoopi Goldberg lost her endorsement deal with Slim-Fast for making a Bush pun while that Master of Decency Dick Cheney can tell a Democrat "Go fuck yourself" and still keep  his  job.&nbsp;That, and&nbsp;the fact that Cheney&nbsp;has his job at all.

       urlLink     Hate in the name of love&nbsp; urlLink      A while back, I stumbled upon a blog from my hometown,  urlLink The Rock . It is the work of a twentysomething ex-felon who has found God. And while I'm for anything that gets you through the day, especially after some seriously hard times, I do take exception when that belief system turns into hate for anyone different.   Even in a predominantly Catholic area, I know a lot of&nbsp;people whom&nbsp;you might call "fundies": fundamentalist Christians of the Pat Robertson or Fred Phelps strain. Yep, the ones who just looove to endlessly harp on "the unsaved" and "those filthy sodomites." They're such good Christians that they even hate Catholics and other differently Christian sects!   I think&nbsp;that fundie Christianity is less about God or Jesus or adherence to morality as much as it is about pushing  religion . See, it's not enough to them&nbsp;that someone leads a moral existence, does good things for others, loves everyone, and attends church only twice a week.  YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HELL! In fact, you're&nbsp;WORSE than the worst filth rotting on death row! Why? Because you don't attend MY church and you haven't gotten on your hands and knees right here in the coffee shop to scream out your desire to be saved in front of everyone! It doesn't matter if you're the most perfect and faultless person in the world, because in my God's eyes you aren't fit to shine&nbsp;His shoes. But if you join my faith then you can gain a heart full of love just like mine, SINNER!    In the end, does all of this matter? Was it really necessary to fight thousands of years of wars over how someone gave a message of peace? To the fundies, apparently it is. Then again, many of them talk about how Jesus was filled with the war spirit, so at least they're consistent in their hatred, if not in their logic.   What does all of this have to do with The Rock? Well, I asked him a simple question. He had written&nbsp;a post that I reproduce here, with all caps and sloppy typing intact:    WHY IS IT THAT ALL THE LIBERAL MEDIA, THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SINNERS SUCH AS MADONNA ANDPAUL MCCARTNEY, & THE POPE ALL HAVE THE SAME THING IN COMMON: THEY ARE OPPOSED TO THE WAR IN IRAQ. COULD IT BE THAT THE SPIRIT THAT DRIVES THE ABOVE MENTIONED IS THE SAME SPIRIT WE REFER TO IN THE BIBLE AS THE god OF THIS WORLD IS THE SAME SPIRIT THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE GAYS MARRIED , AND ALL OF OUR CHILDREN ON DRUGS LIVING IN VIOLENCE WITH ONE ANOTHER. I AM NOT A BIG BUSH SUPPORTER, I AM NOT A PRO-WAR ACTIVIST. I DO AGREE WITH THE WAR HOWEVER BECAUSE I CAN TELL SATAN IS NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH IT.    My question, then, was this:    Whatever happened to "let he who is without sin cast the first stone?" What is Christian about indiscriminate killing? Or implying that people are demonic because they don't support a disastrous and utterly pointless war?    I had forgotten about my comment until I got this e-mail reply from The Man himself. Keep in mind that I asked him specifically about the Christian ethics of supporting the War in Iraq. What I got was the standard fundie template answer for everything:    Ian,  There is a time to have mercy on sinners. Like for example when I got saved. At the time I was 21 years old was a convicted felon, had spent all together 12 months of my life in rehabs and halfway houses trying to get straight and none of that had power to change me , then God came and had mercy on me the sinner. While it is true that no man is without sin there is one who came to earth as a man and he did live a sinless life. He was a perfect man a perfect sacrifice. The Bible says clearly without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. Jesus Christ came and shed his blood at the cross , died , and rose from the grave on the third day. He died so that we who put our faith in what he did on the cross would not only be forgiven of our sins, but have power over sin. The Bible is clear "he who has died is freed from sin" by faith we die on the cross with Christ our old life is buried and we are given new resurrection life. We are made whole in Christ.   Now anyone who is in opposition of this&nbsp;redeeming work of Christ is any ememy of the Cross of Christ ie. Militant Islamics, Liberal Media, Evolutionist, the Pope. Cathilocs are in strict oppositon of the gospel of Jesus Christ because they have no clue what it means to be born again of the Spirit through death to sin.   Now let me clarify myself I say I have power over sin , I do not mean I am sinless like Jesus Christ no what I mean is I no longer practice sin. I am no longer a slave to the sin of drug addiction, immorality, and rebellion. I will put it another way before I was saved I had 99% corrupted thoughts and maybe&nbsp;1% pure thoughts, now that I am saved I have 99% pure, righteous thoughts and maybe&nbsp;1&nbsp;% corrupted&nbsp;thoughts. Ian I noticed you live in the same town as me. I challange you to let me sit down with you and discuss this. I believe that I can prove to you that God is real and that not only are His commands very possible to obey but we must obey. I can prove it you given the chance. HIs Word is real and if it turned a son of iniquity like me who had no joy to&nbsp;a Son of God who is full of joy and peace it must be a very powerful thing.   respectfully,  Daniel    Well,  that  cleared up the issue, didn't it?  Another question: If it takes this guy 448 words to&nbsp;respond to&nbsp;my question without&nbsp;venturing anywhere near an answer, then how does he expect me to sit with him and be converted? I just hope he doesn't find out that I'm a liberal journalist who once considered himself Catholic. Would he shoot me on the spot?  This world will continue to destroy itself as long as people have no respect for the private beliefs of others. I respect Daniel the Rock; but if he cannot defend his beliefs without tearing down mine, than he is part of the problem.  On the other hand, anyone who can profess their deeply held beliefs in a reasonable and earnest manner; who can&nbsp;explain&nbsp;their faith's role&nbsp;in their understanding of&nbsp;world issues; and who can do all of this without resorting to vague platitudes, is certainly someone whose opinion I will value.

       New line of&nbsp;rations rehydrate with piss    urlLink   &nbsp;  Ahhhhh! That turkey's PLUMP!&nbsp;       &nbsp;   urlLink They're NOT kidding!    In an effort to do to the military what they're doing to America, private industry has introduced a cost-cutting method of providing portable food for soldiers. Just add urine!   The Combat Feeding Directorate, a branch of the US Army Soldier Systems Center in Natick, Mass., commissioned the product from Hydration Technologies of Albany, Ore. The main feature of these new, lighter rations is a filter pouch that supposedly&nbsp;removes 99.9 percent of all toxic chemicals in urine or dirty water.    "The pouch - containing chicken and rice - relies on osmosis to filter the water or urine," the New Scientist Magazine reported.   The liquid passes through a membrane, thin sheets of a cellulose-based plastic with gaps just 0.5 nanometres wide.   It means only clean water can reach the food, and the bacteria is left behind.  (Where?)   Of course, engineers at Hydration Technology recommend that soldiers use urine in their bladder banquets&nbsp;only as a last resort (a tip&nbsp;that I'm sure the soldiers&nbsp;will find most&nbsp;helpful). While the pouch allegedly filters 99.9 percent of harmful bacteria, it is incapable of removing urea. Urea is the pissy part of urine, chronic use of which can lead to severe kidney malfunction (!!) Besides, it tastes bad.   I once read a quote that summed up the K-rations of World War II: "The food serves the dual purpose of sustaining the soldier while making him angry enough to kill." Well, these new rations should piss them off pretty good.

      George W. Bush is fond of saying "Bring 'em on," except when it comes to ballots.   Just in time for the 10th anniversary of the infamously unplayed 1994 World Series comes this gem: the GOP push for a possible&nbsp; urlLink postponement of the November presidential election  is officially underway. Our baseball-lovin' White House squatter&nbsp;can certainly appreciate the timing.    urlLink Not that this is news or anything...    Of course, the plan is just a precaution, you know, in case something really bad just&nbsp;HAPPENS to happen between now and November (wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more)!    Between this and the terrorism-stock-market system that the Pentagon recently tried to implement, I'd have to say that the Republicans apparently really,&nbsp;really want another attack. They see terrorist attacks as a fun gamble. It's a much safer bet than the election, because war is something at which they might actually stand a chance of winning. That is, in the Dumb-and-Dumber, "one-in-a-million" sense of the word chance.   As bad as things are in Iraq (and, to a lesser extent, in Afghanistan), how can anyone even begin to justify the situation being bad enough to postpone an election?&nbsp;No American presidential election has EVER been rescheduled. Nor should it ever, as everyone's favorite president Abraham Lincoln noted at the only possible time when postponement might have been justified, the freaking breakup of the nation:    "The election is a necessity," Lincoln said. "We cannot have a free government without elections; and if the rebellion could force us to forgo, or postpone, a national election, it might fairly claim to have already conquered us."   urlLink BBC    I say, if Lincoln could hold an election in a country that was  HALFWAY TO MAD MAX  at the time, then&nbsp;we can&nbsp;certainly pull it off in 2004! After all, aren't we supposedly united like never before?&nbsp;Hell, we've faced numerous wars in&nbsp;the United States in election years, virtually all of which held far more immediately devastating consequences to the home turf than Bush's dual shitstorms:&nbsp;&nbsp;   The War of 1812 (1812, perhaps?)&nbsp;  The Civil War (1864)  The Spanish-American War (1896)&nbsp;&nbsp;  World War I (1916)  World War II (1944)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Korean War (1952)  Vietnam (1964, 1968, 1972)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Cold War (1945-1992)    I guess the Bush administration has a point, though; if they suspend the election, then any terrorist attack would simply be redundant.

       urlLink     A Bush-brained, uh, bird-brained, mistake&nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;   urlLink The Smoking Gun  reports that one of the commemorative signs along the fence of Ground Zero in New York City had an error. Actually, a serious error. Hell, a (dare I say it?) MONUMENTAL error! In short, the sign noted that the terrorist attacks happened on Sept. 11, 2002 instead of the more-popular 2001.  &nbsp;  The error was noticed July 10 by a 22-year-old guy who e-mailed notice of the mistake to the Port Authority. He was apparently the first person to notice it in the TWO YEARS that the sign had been up! Horrible, just horrible. The GOP's plan to make education uncool is almost complete.  &nbsp;  We're not talking some obscure grammatical error, either. It's the freaking date! And the way the Bush administration constantly reminds us of 9/11 like it's the best thing that ever happened to them (it is), surely someone would have noticed by now. Well, at least one person did. In this age of constant revisionist history, that's no small feat.&nbsp;

      Here's a look at some of the stories are changing our world, courtesy of the Polite Press and the Wire of United States Stories:  &nbsp;   Viewer discretion advised   &nbsp;  LOS ANGELES (PP)-- The Movie Channel advised parental discretion for&nbsp;the Kate Hudson movie "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" just prior to its 8 p.m. showing Monday.  &nbsp;  "The following movie is rated PG-13," an announcer said just before the feature presentation. "It contains adult language and adult content. Viewer discretion is advised."  &nbsp;  This marks the first advisory of viewer discretion since the network's&nbsp;showing of "Rob Roy" at 5:30 p.m.  &nbsp;   Seventies-music lover prefers eighties pussy     &nbsp;  SEATTLE (WUSS)--Rick Cole, a self-described "seventies-music fanatic," is&nbsp;also into eighties pussy, the 37-year-old mechanic declared Sunday.  &nbsp;  "Yes, I'm hugely into [Bruce]&nbsp;Springsteen, Foghat, Blue Oyster Cult, Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd and BTO," Cole said. "Not to mention the Jackson Five, Diana Ross, Parliament-Funkadelic and even Donna Summer. My musical taste runs all over the map.  &nbsp;  "And have you checked out that Jessica Biel?" Cole asked, referring to the 22-year-old former star of the TV series "7th-Heaven." "Not only is she hot and a great young actress, I heard that she even plays soccer at the college she attends. What else could a guy want?"  &nbsp;  Cole expressed similar affinity for a long list of 1980s pussy. "Let's see, there's Beyonce Knowles, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Paris Hilton, the Bush twins and too many others to count. Yep, just like the 1970s rocked for music, so did the 1980s rock for pussy."  &nbsp;  Cole recalled that his favorite concert experience was catching the Grateful Dead in&nbsp;California in the late 1970s.  &nbsp;  "Man, that Dead concert was a blast," Cole remembered. "A bunch of us dudes got together and drove all the way to Sacramento on impulse. That concert was the best ever. Not just a concert, but a life-changing event, you know?"  &nbsp;  Another date that Cole remembered with fondness was June 13, 2004.  &nbsp;  "That was the day the Olsen twins finally became legal,"&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;"Man, I tell you, eighties pussy is the greatest!"  &nbsp;   Garfield killed by jealous Heathcliff   &nbsp;  MUNCIE, IND. (PP)--Garfield, the orange cat known worldwide for his long-running series of mischief and misadventures, was killed Sunday night at the hands of Heathcliff.  &nbsp;  According to Muncie police reports, owner Jon Arbuckle found Garfield, 26, face-down in the pup tent he had used as a bed.  &nbsp;  "I passed by Garfield's pup tent and he was motionless and swaddled in his bedsheets," Arbuckle said. "Being that this is far from unusual, I went on and continued my day. When he failed to respond to the aroma of the lasagna I was cooking him for lunch, however, then I became alarmed."  &nbsp;  According to coroners, Garfield's official cause of death was listed as acute suffocation. A plastic grocery bag had been finagled onto his face without any evidence of foul play.  &nbsp;  "The manner in which the plastic bag was affixed to the victim's head immediately caused us to suspect Heathcliff," said Joseph Winkle, Muncie chief of police. "In order to accomplish that with so little interference, the assailant would have had to either be very&nbsp;quiet or have somehow convinced Garfield that there were groceries in the bag. Heathcliff knew that while no one should terrorize their neighborhood,&nbsp;he would not be outdone, playing pranks on everyone."  &nbsp;  Winkle further noted that&nbsp;Garfield had long been the target of Heathcliff, 31.  &nbsp;  "From 1973 to 1978, Heathcliff ruled over the orange-cat comics sphere," explained . "With Garfield's birth in 1978, however, the tide began to turn and Heathcliff presumably became jealous."  &nbsp;  While Heathcliff was the first to have his own cartoon show, in 1980, it sputtered through several incarnations and lacked the consistent success that "Garfield and Friends" enjoyed during the late 1980s and early 1990s. While both cats' strips continue in print to this day, Heathcliff never sustained the continued pop-culture presence of his victim.  &nbsp;  Garfield creator Jim Davis, Heathcliff cartoonist&nbsp;George Gately, Riff Raff and Odie were&nbsp;all unavailable for comment.

       urlLink    Putting the "shit" in "shirt"  urlLink     At last! The most honest Bush-Cheney shirt I've ever seen!  At last! A shirt that shows off the friendly face of compassionate America! Sure, that face looks like Skeletor, He-Man's old nemesis, but then again, Peace Isn't Pretty. And I'm sure that deep down he has a heart of gold. Or is that the flames?  At last! A shirt that shows the true meaning of compassionate conservatism and the importance of unity, not division. So  "Pansies, hippies, dirt bags and freaks, shut up and stay out of the way."   At last! A shirt that alerts us to the heretofore unknown fact that the War on Terror is a dirty job!  This shirt is available (for $18.99, because Freedom isn't Free) at  urlLink Metrospy , an online W-Mart that carries this odd disclaimer:   "Campaign finance law does not allow proceeds from this Site to benefit the Bush-Cheney campaign. This law applies to ALL political merchandise websites, INCLUDING   urlLink  THE OFFICIAL BUSH '04 STORE  .  If you support the President, one of the best places to buy t-shirts and buttons is right here, with METROSPY! :)"   With that doubletalk out of the way, Metrospy describes its shirt in a way that would make Bill O'Reilly nod with approval:   "If you listen to the nutty-left: People like Al Gore, Michael Moore, John Kerry, Howard Dean, Mad Donna, Jorge Soros and others, they expect Americans to roll over and cave in to terrorism. Fortunately, none of these screwballs run the country. The only way to stop terror is to fight terror. Terorrists  [sic]  must be hunted down and killed. - It's a dirty job. Thank God we have a President willing to do what has to be done."    urlLink Outside the Beltway  is raving about the shirt in ways I couldn't spoof if I tried:   "You've never seen a Bush-Cheney T-Shirt like this before. This historic piece of political swag is destined to incite near riots on every college campus in America. Be part of the action and order this amazing T-Shirt today! Click to Order the Greatest Bush-Cheney T-Shirt Ever Made."    "100% cotton" ...guaranteed to shrink in heat. Like Bush.  "Strong, durable and guaranteed to last."  Unlike Bush.

      The  urlLink Rotten Library , a site I highly recommend for trivial and serious information alike, has a  urlLink stellar timeline  on the events of September 11, 2001. It offers the known facts, minute-by-minute, a pretty remarkable feat when you think about it. The timeline is the clearest documentation I've yet seen regarding the intelligence failures of that tragic day. The page also features hard-hitting and compelling pictures, including footage of Mohammed Atta boarding a plane in Maine at 5:45 a.m., the planes crashing into the World Trade Center, Bush looking busy and damage at the Pentagon.  While you're at the library, check out some of the other great stuff. If only this had been around when I was making papers in high school...

       Report: Bush taking drugs to combat stress     No, this isn't some old news about Bush's numerous alleged substance trysts. This is  urlLink in the now :   The prescription drugs, administered by Col. Richard J. Tubb, the White House physician, can impair the President’s mental faculties and decrease both his physical capabilities and his ability to respond to a crisis, administration aides admit privately.    “It’s a double-edged sword,” says one aide. “We can’t have him flying off the handle at the slightest provocation but we also need a President who is alert mentally.”   Presidential protocol calls for all medical prescriptions to remain private. And thus the speculation begins. In an unintentionally hilarious development, the breaking point had to do with Kenny Boy!   Tubb prescribed the anti-depressants after a clearly-upset Bush stormed off stage on July 8, refusing to answer reporters' questions about his relationship with indicted Enron executive Kenneth J. Lay.    “Keep those motherfuckers away from me,” he screamed at an aide backstage. “If you can’t, I’ll find someone who can.”   Supposedly, Adolf Hitler had his aides injected him with methamphetamines several times a day during the crumbling of the Third Reich. If you know anything about meth, you know that it makes you really PARANOID (or, at the very least, wide awake). So that was probably a bad idea.   Disclaimer!  I'm not at all implying that Bush is on crystal meth, just that he evidently shares many of the traits that Hitler displayed as World War II slipped out of his outstretched hand. The article doesn't mention the Hitler connection, but does compare Bush's behavior to the late-term antics of Nixon (talking to presidential portraits) and Reagan (early-onset Alzheimer's).  As a human being, I feel bad for Bush. He's been dealt the addiction card and has played it more times in his life than has been good for him. Over time, he's cleaned up and allegedly relapsed numerous times. This bodes badly for him as a leader. If he handles the presidency this badly, then maybe we should seriously reconsider his position, for health reasons if nothing else. Then we could symbolically hand over the reins to Dick Cheney, whose health is...ah, forget it...  Read more about our fearless leader  urlLink here

      Supporters of the Bush administration (at least those in the blogosphere) are constantly coming up with new and unique insults to describe liberals. You've seen many upon many on this page, and you can see them of course on any right-wing blog.  The latest among these creative epithets is "muckadoo." In the last 48 hours alone, I've been called a "muckadoo" on  urlLink IMAO  almost as many times as Bush has IQ points. So, naturally, I've been wondering what it means. Lo and behold, I've finally been bestowed an answer by the fine folk at  urlLink Hello Infidels!  According to that site's introductory post, "muckadoo" has legitimate etmylogical roots:   "You sick little muckadoo, ("Monkey see, monkey do" -  urlLink  Frank J.    speak) don't you get it?!?!"   Aha! I KNEW it was a Frank term! In case you don't know, Frank is the almighty god of IMAO. He's the Rush Limbaugh of bloggers, a guy who can spawn off all manners of absurd terminology and who has a fawning fan base. If only I were that powerful! If Frank is the Rush of bloggers, then J.A. Olinger (the blogger behind  urlLink Hello Infidels ) is the Web's wannabe Michael Savage. His influences are quite obvious: urlLink     "I listen to the voice of sanity Mon-Fri,   urlLink  Michael Savage   . He is the man!"  [True fact: Michael Savage's last name is actually  urlLink Weiner !]  He also pimps for  "the lovely and talented   urlLink  Ann Coulter   ,"  as well as  "the real son of Ronald Reagan,   urlLink  Michael Reagan    (real because he embodies the former prez better than his son by the same name.) Though he was adopted, he is the true son of that great statesman, Ray-gun."     In the interest of fine grassroots debate, I'm always on the lookout for a true conservative weblog. If you are too, then check him out! You've been warned.

      Facing three million jobs lost since 2001, the Bush administration&nbsp;trotted out a helpful solution in a candid moment Thursday:     "Why don't they get new jobs if they're unhappy -- or go on Prozac?"     This bit of wisdom comes from Susan Sheybani, an&nbsp;aide to Bush campaign spokesperson Terry Holt. Of course, Sheybani didn't actually mean for her bold idea to actually be known; she was relaying her off-the-cuff comment to a coworker while on the phone with a reporter. Read all about it  urlLink here !   I don't know for sure, but I'd bet ten-to-one that Sheybani is either a college intern or a very young professional. I don't think she had any malicious intentions by saying what she did; besides, who among us hasn't said dumb things from time to time? But it does offer an interesting insight into the psyche of someone deemed worthy of employment by the Bush administration.   Sheybani reminds me of a friend of mine from college, an intelligent girl I liked immensely, but who despite her best efforts could not totally shake her pampered upbringing. One day, I went to eat at the restaurant where she worked. In the parking lot, I saw her car and noticed that her license plate had been expired for almost a year. When I went inside, I told her that she needed to renew her license plate. She looked at me and, with a totally straight face, replied, "License plates  expire ? Daddy never told me that!"   So, yeah, I'd say the Republicans are a little out-of-touch. Maybe they need some Prozac...

      Here's the latest in my ongoing effort to bring out the real and desperate face of conservatism, circa summer 2004:   At my favorite hangout  urlLink IMAO , they were going absolutely orgasmic over the picture of John Kerry in that silly green suit. Of course, the 126 comments there were the educated observations you would expect of such a fine conservative bastion. Pay particular note to the repeated references to colons, condoms and sperm (and, as always, the piss-poor spelling and grammar is untouched):    "Tuh-ray-zuh, i'm wearing my cute little PJs with the flap in the back..."  "Kerry dons an over-sized prophylactic, and gives a dramatic reenactment of how his little willie made him big millionare!"  "Kerry gets down on hands and knees, and demonstrates his "position" on foreign policy. He wears protective garments, so that "those UN guys don't get me all sloppy".  "Plaqued with questions about his manhood, democratic challenger John Kerry tours an oversized model uterus dressed as a sperm"  "John Kerry, what a homo."  "Nothing says Effiminate Douchebag like the latest in French jumpsuit fashion."  "Hey, what am I doing in Michael Moore's small intestine?"  "In Style News today, Senator Kerry, who served in Vietnam, models the latest in official DNC convention wear: color-coordinated prophylactic apparel designed to cleverly hide those unsightly liberal-moonbat circumcision scars."  "John Kerry suits up in preparation for Michael Moore's yearly cleansing"  "The Klingon can stay, but the leftist in the sperm suit has got to go!"  "The problem here was that the U-joints weren't greased enough, plus there was this (holds up Skeleton of Whole Moose) stuck in the Exsauhst, other than that Mr. Moore should be good for another 3,000 miles."  "No. Really. It's just this suit - I'm not an actual dickhead!"  "What? You found that in my colonoscopy?"  "I made a poopie...tee...hee...hee."  "John Kerry emerges from the exam room after performing a visual self-colonoscopy."  "Umpa, umpa, umpa di do, Michael Moore has another poopie for you."  "BikerMommy: instestinal virus! I love that! That is so right on, and not just for the picture! A virus is intrusive, vile, painful, untreatable, nauseating, and it cleans you out. Bravo!"  "The suppository goes in which way?"  "Hoping to gain the support of women voters, John Kerry dons his sperm suit."  "Mission accomplished! I stopped up the drain hole so they can't flush the Johns now!!"  "I made a poopie...tee...hee...hee."  "Turns out, it's not very funny at all when you fart in a spacesuit."  "ya know, seeing that big, dorky smile on his face it make one wonder where exactly that big white hose behind him leads to..."  "Wow, Michael Moore's rectum is REALLY big......."  "Kerry "When I was fighting in Vietnam, we didn't have the full-body condom like the one I'm demonstrating..as a matter of fact..what THE?? Glenn??? What are you doing back there?? Get offa me!"    "Poor 3 eyed mutant Bass Turd."    Of course, you just KNOW I had something to say…    Yeah, go ahead, attack his outfit! After all, your president knows better than to dress up in silly costumes (like, say, flight suits) and strut around...   Stick to the issues. Oh, wait, you can't...   Posted by Ian McGibboney at July 29, 2004 01:53 AM    Somewhere down the line, in between the John Kerry poopie jokes and the Michael Moore colon obsession, a few people called out the lone party pooper:    Dear Ian McGibboney,   Sure, I can stick to the issues. For example, just now I had this nearly uncontrollable urge to call you Ian McGibbon, but I didn't.   Posted by Paul at July 29, 2004 11:22 AM   Ian McGibbon-face,(see what I did there?)  It's probably not a good idea to come to a site with opposing views, and challenge them on what they're saying. Like, I just went to your website, totally not expecting it to have any logic or make any sense or be good at all, and you didn't let me down. I didn't go there and say, hey mr. dude, how about some actual facts here? Or how about you find out what the issues are so you can stick to them? So....IMAO is probably not the place for you....muckadoos...erm they're all the same.... In closing, righties rule, lefties drool.  Sincerely,  Moi  (See what I did there?? Threw in a little french to confuse him...LOL)   Posted by Jen at July 29, 2004 04:17 PM    Inspired by this oh-so-hilarious-and-inspirational political exchange, these people were courteous enough to visit my site! Not that they’d bother to, you know, tell me.    Jen, he admits at the top of his page that he's "not right about anything." At least he realizes it.  Posted by beo at July 29, 2004 04:36 PM    A common thread in IMAO posts is the propensity for major butt-kissing of the almighty god of the site, some guy named Frank. Many of the posts are of the “I humbly send this in for your consideration” strain. Apparently Big Frank’s standards allow only for the truth, for my favorite post of the whole thread shows a lot of inherent truth about conservatives in 2004:    And I see there was a muckadoo here earlier asking you to stick to the issues.... Someone needs to teach these muckadoos to respect their betters. LOL   Posted by Jen at July 29, 2004 01:28 PM    Just for fun, let’s dissect this comment:   1)  “And I see there was a muckadoo…”    What the hell is a “muckadoo?”   2)  “…here earlier asking you to stick to the issues....we're REPUBLICANS.”    Oops, my bad then…   3)  “we're REPUBLICANS. We can do whatever we wanna.”    Yes you can. And you do. Which is why you make Kerry in his space suit look studly.   4)  “Someone needs to teach these muckadoos to respect their betters.”    Their betters? The GOP? To that I have to say:   5)  "LOL"    Amen, Jen.   So the wingnuts on the right are name-calling, self-righteous, childish, issue-less morons hiding behind untraceable pseudonyms? Is this even news anymore? Rock the vote!!

       urlLink    Does this really  need  a caption?&nbsp; urlLink     What you are looking at is a very real piece of Clinton memorabilia. Sit down and let me tell you about it...  On October 27, 1992, a certain Arkansas governor named Bill Clinton came to Lafayette, LA to talk about running for some office or another.  His appearance was the culmination of a Cajun-dance party known in these parts as a "fais-do-do." "Fais-do-do" is a Cajun-French term that means, literally, "go to sleep," originating from the fact that these parties went on all night and made you sleepy. The featured band was Wayne Toups and Zydecajun (or was it Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys? I always get those two confused).  Anyway, because my father was working for the local Clinton campaign here, he was one of the main coordinators for the event. This allowed my mom and I to get special passes to stand directly in front of the lectern with the most fanatical Democrats that this Republican-leaning city could muster. We were all given miniature American flags to wave; I also managed to finagle a bumper sticker from an NEA representative. Much to my surprise, only a handful of protesters were there. Many of them blew duck whistles while displaying "Clinton ducked the draft" posters. Ha freaking ha.  Night had fallen by the time the big man arrived. I don't quite remember what he said, but I remember thinking that he had a hell of a lot more stage presence than George Bush (hell, he even upstaged the band, something that's very hard to do in the Cajun heartland!). Following the speech, I nearly met an early pre-voting death as described below in the Secret Service column. After shaking Clinton's very HUGE hand (and repeatedly banging my head for not bringing a camera), I watched as a representative handed him my NEA bumper sticker to autograph. I still have it in a secure location to this day, and will post it as soon as I can figure out just where that secure location is.  As for the tag shown above, it is the security pass my dad wore for the event. On the back is the Clinton-Gore logo along with the phrase "Laissez les bon temps rouler!" ("Let the good times roll!"). My dad says he designed the tag, which I think even Clinton's people had to wear. Naturally, Dad had his tag signed by the Big Dog for posterity. The two allegedly talked for awhile, and given both men's propensities for going on and on and on, I fully believe it.   On those days when Dad and I are trying to top each other, he can always screech me to a halt by saying, "Yeah, but have you ever talked to  the president ?"   "Yeah, Dad, but did you talk to New Orleans Saints head coach Jim Haslett and forget to tell him your name?"   urlLink    Me with Coach Haslett, 5/16/03 &nbsp; urlLink     "And don't forget that time I sat in Knight Rider!"   urlLink    Me, my brother and KITT, 1985 &nbsp; urlLink     As if I ever had a chance...Clinton's still the king!

       Here's a column that I hope to publish in the  urlLink Vermilion  closer to the election. Oyster expressed to me his support for the Electoral College, and so I promised him a look at this. I won't keep him hanging any longer (and I'm sure he was just holding his breath waiting...ha ha...). Oh yeah, I should probably mention that this is far from done. In fact, just to give you some insight into the writing process, I wrote much of the first paragraph probably a year before the rest of it. Sometimes you have tidbits that just don't fit with anything else, you know? But once you are finally able to connect it to a larger point, you get that warm sense of accomplishment. Kind of like when you pick up something with your toes.   The United States of America is a democracy only in theory. Very few institutions reflect this mode of government; the military, corporations, bureaucracies, churches and families operate under a structure of top-down management, with a few people or offices setting the agenda and using the bottom rungs as pawns to attain these means. Parents scream with fervor to their unruly kids, “This house is NOT a democracy!” Republicans and libertarians gladly remind us that “the United States is not a democracy but a republic,” as if that somehow justifies worship of our leaders. The people at the bottom of these pyramid schemes have no choice but to follow orders and have no voice whatsoever. All that’s left in terms of democracy is elections, and even those have come under scrutiny.   Still, we talk a good game about “the will of the people.” Except for the small fact that WE DO NOT VOTE FOR PRESIDENT! You think Election Day is on Nov. 2? Guess again! It’s actually on Jan. 6. And no, this is not one of those oh-so-hysterical Republican jokes about having all of the Democrats vote on Wednesday. No, this particular joke is called the Electoral College.  You have to love the Electoral College. We, the United States of America, supposedly the hallmark for free and fair elections by, of and for the people, hold tremendous support for a system that is in fact the least democratic or republican thing imaginable.  So, you might ask, what exactly are you doing in the voting booth? Look carefully. When you pull your lever for your chosen candidate, you are actually voting for the handful of names listed in fine print underneath. These people are called “electors” and they are more or less local; in fact, you may even know one or more of them. When you vote, you are voting for them to go to Baton Rouge on Jan. 6 and vote for your candidate. Only the electors for the winning candidate in your state will cast their votes.   Nationwide, there are 538 total votes, one for each member of Congress. Want to know the best part? THE ELECTOR IS NOT AT ALL OBLIGATED TO VOTE FOR THEIR PLEDGED CANDIDATE. Granted, most of the people who choose to serve in this position are so partisan that they make  me  look like a swing voter; however, change has been known to happen… “One man, one vote,” indeed. More like, “One state, one vote.”  What the Electoral College succeeds in doing is heightening the drama. Us Americans, we sure do like our drama! Remember that good old Reagan Revolution in 1980, when Ronald Reagan trounced incumbent Jimmy Carter 489-49 in the Electoral College? Man, you talk about a blowout! Except that it really wasn’t—the popular-vote count was much closer; Reagan amassed 43,898,770 votes to Carter’s 35,480,948. That’s 50.8 percent to 41 percent. Hardly a landslide. And those numbers shift depending on the source.  Likewise, Reagan whipped Walter Mondale in 1984 by the largest EC margin in history, tied with Richard Nixon over George McGovern in 1972. Of 538 electoral votes, Reagan nabbed 525, while Mondale grabbed a lucky 13. Not bad for a race Reagan really won 59 percent to 41 percent (54,450,603—37,573,761)!  Defenders of the Electoral College claim that it keeps the whims of the public in check. Yeah, wouldn’t want the public to decide, now would we? So much for the old adage that people get the leaders they deserve.  As a political-science professor once pointed out to me, “If you’re a conservative and you live in New York, your vote’s never going to count!” He did have a point. This works both ways and thus is yet a further argument for abolishing the diploma mill known as the Electoral College.  Fortunately, the Founding Fathers were smart enough to leave most elections to the popular vote. We only use the Electoral College for the frivolous presidential elections. Whew! I’d hate to see it being used on something important, such as on “American Idol.”

       This is a working column I might put in the  urlLink Vermilion  sometime in the future. I wrote it some time ago but I've held back on it (mainly because it's a little me-centric, something I usually try to avoid in my columns). And yes, it's 100-percent true. What do you think?   Ah, the Secret Service. It’s not secret, and it’s only a service to a couple of people. Despite its oddly ironic name, however, the Secret Service serves as a model of personal safety and security. Its thoroughness is not to be believed. If you doubt that, consider how this often-overlooked juggernaut of security has had Ian on the brain.  In late 1996, I was a junior staff writer for the Lafayette High Parlez Vous. Then-Vice Presidential candidate Jack Kemp was coming to visit and, well, we considered that somewhat important. The Secret Service called our staff about a week before the campaign stop and inquired as to the extent of our coverage. They told us that any photographers would have to submit their cameras and all other equipment for extensive scrutiny. Their rationale: certain chemicals within camera film can conceivably be used to make a toxic and dangerous bomb. With our staff at the time, they should not have worried about anyone expressing any less than serious ass-kissing toward the man. In the end, our paper made no mention whatsoever of the event. Too much hassle. Besides, it came out a month later anyway.  More recently, Dick Cheney’s Super-Duper beef-deluxe Secret Service swept the Lafayette area in October 2002 when Cheney dropped by the City Club to pander to rich people. As part of its apparently comprehensive sweep, agents stopped by the Vermilion office to inquire about a certain writer named Ian McGibboney. Editor in chief Amanda Guidry was asked about my beliefs, my disposition and even my whereabouts. Mandy and I have been friends for years; I am fortunate that she never told the SS about my tempers throughout journalism school. Those questions were all moot anyway. Why the hell would I go see Cheney wipe Terrell’s ass while Mike Foster looks on in shame? I get enough dirty looks just biking near the City Club, much less going inside the place.  Whoops! I bet the Secret Service will schedule another Republican visit very soon just so they can cite this column and throw me in jail with Big Buns Eddy.  I do have to admit, however, that the Secret Service pretty much saved my life in 1992. On Oct. 27 of that year, then-Gov. Bill Clinton came to Lafayette. In stark contrast to “Man of the Rich People” Cheney, Clinton held his bash at Girard Park, for free, with live music and dancing.  After his speech, Clinton came to the section where mom and I stood and greeted us. I shook his massive hand just after he hugged my mother (insert Monica joke here). Because of his rapid approach, the crowd swarmed around and enveloped us. Being a skinny 12-year-old boy in a crowd of hardcore adult Democrats, I could barely breathe. I noticed the CNN camera pointed at me, imagining how my internal organs were going to look to the world and to Wolf Blitzer. The SS stepped in quickly, however, and we all lived to cast our votes two weeks later. Not me, though; I couldn’t vote yet because I was 12.  Because my father worked diligently on the local campaign, the Secret Service enlisted him to help coordinate the event. This brought about one of my dad’s favorite anecdotes; after the event, he and an agent were talking over beers. The agent remarked about the Secret Service’s constant professionalism. Even after several beers, the agent still maintained an eerily straight face, despite a barrage of dad’s very funny comedy. You gotta admire that!  These are the people who are protecting the people who are not protecting us. Rock on, secret servers!

      The ever-civil Republican Party was in Boston Tuesday to hand out photos of John Kerry crawling through a NASA space shuttle orbiter. The best part of this photo is--get this--he's wearing a funny outfit!   urlLink    HAHAHAHAHA!!!&nbsp; urlLink     The GOP evidently hopes that, by portraying Kerry as a bumbling buffoon out of his element, they can do to him what they did to Michael Dukakis in 1988:    urlLink     NOOOOOOOO!!!!&nbsp; urlLink      If you ask me, though, Kerry looks more like Kup from the Transformers:   urlLink    Beat that Decepticon Bush! &nbsp; urlLink

      Here in Louisiana, we're barraged with daily news that paints us as a "conservative" state. That might be true, being that most of the state is, well, north Louisiana (think "Footloose") with New Orleans thrown in for balance. Lafayette, in the heart of south/Cajun Louisiana, is a bridge connecting the two polar-opposite regions, if such a thing can possibly exist. These conservative commentators often forget that Louisiana is probably the least cohesive state in the South and often swings the vote (LA went for Clinton in both 1992 and 1996).  (True story: on election night 1996, my friend--and, at the time, virtually my only outwardly liberal friend--attended a game of our local hockey team. At some point during the game, the announcer relayed the news that Clinton had taken Louisiana. My friend jumped up, pumped his fist, and screamed "YEAH!" while 11,000 other people ferociously booed. He said he was THE ONLY ONE who showed any support. I've always wondered how Louisiana made the smart choice with so many Republicans in the state...but anyway...)  So today I was not at all surprised to see a below-the-fold front-page story in our local newspaper entitled, " urlLink Bush builds on his lead in Louisiana ." Nothing shocking there. But I couldn't help but laugh/gasp when I saw this statement:   “Louisiana is listed as a battleground state, but it’s definitely a state that is leaning to Bush,” Kennedy said. “ Louisiana voters are just not likely to vote for someone from Massachusetts .”   Really? Well, we sure did vote in a  urlLink miserable failure  from New Haven, Connecticut! I mean, as long as we're doing the New England thing, let's at least do it  urlLink right !

      Well, I made history today...for the first time ever, I've been blocked from a blog!  (Update at 12:34 a.m.: I can still post there...)    The always open-minded guys at  urlLink antiprotester &nbsp;were apparently a little miffed at my responses to their  urlLink Kerry criticism . The second link will bring you to the conversation thread; just in case, I saved a screen capture.   Mad at what the dynamic duo saw as personal attacks on my part, they responded as anyone would, with a barrage of personal attacks--on&nbsp;their own blog--that define the word "overreaction" [emphases all mine]:    Rocco   said...    Ian McGibboney,  a young man who fancies himself a journalist  recently showed me disrespect by trashing me on his blog. Instead of having the cajones to continue challenging me on the subject matter at hand, he instead elected to insult me on the sly in his personal blog.  [?!!]  Tight fact-based argument frustrating you Ian? Nothing new, this is a classic leftist reaction.What's next?...What can I say besides stop aping others, find a "voice"(if that's possible in your case) and learn to think for yourself.  Ian, you acted like a little man.  You call yourself a journalist. You're nothing of the sort. In your lamo blog you wear your formal education on your sleeve, proving to me once again that some of the most formally educated people in the world can also be  the dullest, most insecure,rudderless, insincere unoriginal and untalented people on the planet . The hackneyed leftist tripe that is your blog is boring, derivative illogical nonsense delivered with about as much pizazz, originality and insight as a brain-damaged Michael Moore on Quaaludes, minus the brains.Grow up, kiddo or your journalistic career will end where it's stuck now, covering PTA meetings and interviewing Aunt Bertha about her prize winning tomatos in some backwater far from the spotlight you crave. You're now blocked from posting on my blog, jerk.   [um, no.]&nbsp;  Here's my question: if I'm not supposed to&nbsp;talk about these guys on my own blog (did I?), then how is being blocked from their blog helping things? In any case, I must be doing something right. Nothing worthwhile is ever met with a "ho-hum." Except, perhaps, a&nbsp;comfortable bed when you're tired.   What concerns me the most about this is that, at the beginning, we were all civil and we dished on the issues. I met&nbsp;Rocco's long, detailed rebuttals twice and then was rebutted again, the third time which I had not yet found time to answer. In that time, another response came from someone else, and then came the huge hatefest you just read. So, it would seem, without provoking him a third time, he suddenly found his fuse. This&nbsp;is nothing new, of course, but it's the first time that I've ever received correspondence quite so extreme from a total stranger.    12:06 AM    Ted said...  Ian, just one more thing: Your claim that there is no media bias is simply moronic, and the argument you construct to defend that claim is shockingly weak....     &nbsp;  As I was typing this, I received an e-mail from Ted (from a no-reply address) that read, in part:    Another thing, please: you have a very limited understanding of philosophy (and a much smaller mental capacity than you believe you have); so you should try to avoid the references to philosophical texts.    Now, I understand someone not agreeing with you; I understand taking issue with the logistics of a debate; I understand the futility of being unable to get someone to see things your way. But never will I understand someone's desire to attack a stranger's personal traits, careers and works with a fervor that goes far beyond anything that sparked such anger in the first place. On the other hand, debate in general seems to be going heavily in that direction.   Anyone had a similar experience in their blogging careers? I&nbsp;welcome&nbsp;any and all comments. Never have I blocked anyone, nor do I hope to.

      Did you see the opening speeches of the Democratic Convention tonight? Major League Baseball would turn green with a cliche over this all-star lineup!   *Al Gore  *Jimmy Carter  *Hillary Clinton  *Bill Clinton   Not to mention the other speeches from less-known, but equally compelling personalities. Though the speakers varied in speakability, they all would have trounced Joe Lieberman's lackluster performance in 2000, which can't possibly be&nbsp;a bad thing.   Watching Bill Clinton (who, along with Hillary, looked really healthy and vibrant) is, and always was, awesome. Watching him speak tonight reminded me what a real president is supposed to sound like. Damn, that dude can engage an audience! Anyone who needs a reason to support Kerry and the Democrats needs to get themselves a feed of this speech and WATCH IT!   Most importantly, I'm ecstatic that Bill Clinton is back as the&nbsp;elder statesman&nbsp;of the Democratic Party (though he's actually younger than both&nbsp;Carter and Kerry), because Gore's desire to distance himself from Clinton&nbsp;in 2000 really damaged the chances of a Gore presidency. Suffice to say, Clinton brought down the damn house...he definitely brought down my house. I hope this momentum will continue!   Best (approximate) Clinton line of the night: "Strength and wisdom are not mutually exclusive!" Just the WAY that he said it made you realize what a dumbass Bush really is. And just how much Clinton also thinks so.  As for Hillary? Clinton-Clark 2012, baby!

       urlLink     "Shove it"&nbsp;is an anagram for&nbsp;"His Veto"&nbsp; urlLink      Those crazy Democrats! First they get ripped for being too&nbsp;dull (Al Gore), then they're accused of being too uppity (Howard "YEE-HA!" Dean), then they're lambasted for being too dry (John Kerry), then they're decried for copping an attitude (Teresa Heinz Kerry). Damned if you do, damned of you don't, damned if neither one applies!  Teresa's comment to a repeatedly&nbsp;invasive right-leaning reporter--"You said something I didn't say. Now shove it"--mirrors the off-the-cuff comment uttered by George W. Bush in 2000, when he called a New York Times reporter a "major-league asshole." The difference is that Teresa said it on the record and had it reinforced by her husband, friends and colleagues. In fact, you can even  see  the whole incident  urlLink here !  This is the kind of unapologetic fire that I hope the Kerry campaign can refine and use when they need to. Don't listen to the inevitable Republican backlash--that just shows they're afraid! The whole Bush administration should heed her message.

      My best friends at  urlLink antiprotester  have  urlLink a nice comment thread  going. Ted and Rocco have nothing to do with it, as far as I can tell; instead, the floor goes to one Hanibal Anteportas, the poster-poster (Hey! A new term!) for religious faith gone totally amok.  Rarely does someone express such a concentrated body of jaw-dropping, dumbfounding sentences in a short space. But Hanibal does this. Like I always say, your religion, faith and moral values are your own business. But when you use such things to justify fascism and ignorance, then you need to take a refresher at the Constitution.   “It's clear that if Kerry was a true Christian, he would know in his heart that we had to go and pacify the Muslim insurgence.... It's a wave of brutality cast on our shores. We had to stem the black tide.”   You just KNOW where this is headed…   “And President Goeorge W. Bush  [sic]  did that. You think it's a war aginst  [sic]  terror. It's a war for our national soul.”   It IS a war for our national soul—the real soul of America versus the far-right fundamentalist fascists who want to destroy it from the top down.    “Freedom is just another word for living without clues.”    Is he an American? Because this is one of the most anti-American things I’ve ever heard.   “We have clues. We have guidance and leadership.”   But, but, but…is it GOOD guidance and leadership?    “The guidance America has received from its moral leader George W. Bush doesn't require freedom.”     Wow!    “It doesn't require analysis.”    Double wow!    “It doesn't require multiculture  [sic] .”    Triple wow!    “It doesn't require a free press.”    Wow with a cherry on top!    “It doesn't even require me or you.”    Ba-da-BING!   “It's sufficint  [sic]  in itself.”   At this point I’m just lost. And out of breath.   “It's benevolent even if it kills me.”   Heh. Your benevolence is killing me too!   “President George Bush has shown us the way of doing away with doubts. Doing away with second thoughts.”   Wait for it…wait for it…    “Doing even away with thought itself.”    No, no, no, it gets even BETTER!    “It's called blind trust.”    Can I get an amen? No? Then how about a rim-shot?   “It's called divine knowledge of the past, of what has been and came after that. It's called being first on the pasture. It's called being the stern shepherd.”   King George II is back with a vengeance! Looks like that American Revolution was a waste of time after all.   “It's called doing away with the wolly-minded sheep  [sic]  that call themselves Americans but are burners of our sacred flag, the haters of American preparedness to strike back first, the canibals  [sic]  of our history which was written with the blood of those we have lost.”   This may be nitpicking, but how does one “strike back first”?  This classic prose is followed by more responses of equally thoughtful tidbits. Just for brevity’s sake, I’ll share a few more of my favorite lines:   “I speak from the heart of the people.”   This from someone who said the people aren’t even important in the world!    “You should forget your smart words. Look at our president.”    Yeah, he’s forgotten all of his! Finally, a point Hanibal and I agree upon.  Hanibal’s all-time best quotes, though, seek to justify Bush’s stupidity. What WON’T people do to not allow themselves to change their minds?   “Do you think he is so dumb he can't utter a straight sentence ? Do you think his jumbled words are because his thinking is jumbeld  [sic]  ? No…he chooses to be meek also in his words. He stripped his thinking of all of your smarts … [Bush]    is past understanding.  While you are still questioning and try to make things look nonthreatening for those who still must wait, our president can act already not looking left not looking right, not looking behind his back, not looking where he is going.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't have to any more. He is already there.”   Why do so many fundies take pride in ignorance of what goes on the world? Some don’t, but too many do. I’ll never understand the virtue of ignoring the world and looking down on education and intelligence.  Aren’t questioning your beliefs supposed to make them stronger?

        The following is a story about vibrating furniture, the Olsen twins and sexually frustrated white guys. Well, okay,   urlLink  vibrating furniture   , mainly. But it's still a pulse-throbbing read.   This isn't from  urlLink The Onion , but it did make me cry tears of laughter:   "LONDON, England -- A British woman has been banned from owning a stereo or a television after playing music so loud that furniture in neighboring flats was moved by the vibrations.    Birmingham City Council welcomed the two-year  Anti-Social Behavior Order (ASBO)  against 33-year-old rap and karaoke fan Sharon McLoughlin, who is also being evicted from her flat.    She was also banned from causing harassment, alarm or distress anywhere in England and Wales for two years."    Unlike the legions of law-abiding Brits who can cause harassment, alarm or distress anywhere they want, McLoughlin is now reduced to doing all of these things in Ireland and on the Isle of Man. Bully!   "On one occasion, while speaking to witnesses in the property most affected, an officer from the Birmingham Anti-Social Behavior Unit (BASBU) could hardly hear what the residents were saying even though she was only around 6ft away from them, PA reported.     BASBU Manager Ian McGibbon  [not me]  told the UK news agency: "This is an excellent example of officers from different council departments working together to solve a problem effectively."   Wow, I'd never heard of ASBOs before! Imagine, a restraining order between annoying people and the technology that makes them annoying! Okay, maybe the loss of your house and stereo are severe punishments. But hey, can it be worse than what poor old Pee-Wee Herman got? Just imagine the possibilities:    Crime, annoyance down in 2005      WASHINGTON, Jan. 16, 2006 (PIMP) --Crime and annoyance rates both plunged in 2005, the FBI declared Monday in a new report.    Murder, rape, robbery and arson all dropped sharply in the first year of President Kerry's term, a statistic experts attribute to rising economic conditions.    "Historically, crime patterns escalate in times when domestic conditions are at their worst," explained FBI director William J. Clinton. "In the past few years, crime had risen sharply as the economy fell, people lost jobs and assistance venues dried up. Underfunded and understaffed law enforcement agencies also contributed to the problem.    "Thanks in part to the president's 'Put the Hit Out on Crime' and 'Let's Actually Help the Poor!' campaigns, people are less and less inclined to commit offenses."    Meanwhile, authorities are crediting the concurrent downturn in annoyance to Kerry's bold Anti-Social Swipe initative, a system that aims to reduce peace-disturbing violations. Clinton noted that the UK government had initiated its own version of the statute a couple of years earlier. In one now-famous case in 2004, a woman in Birmingham was evicted from her apartment and lost stereo privileges for blaring Eminem at a level that made neighbors' furniture vibrate.    "Just in the few months that we've done it in the States, the ASSwipe program has resulted in the reduction of annoyance rates in just about every category," Clinton said.    Among the categories in which annoyance has dropped are incidents of cars with trunk-vibrating bass; screaming street evangelists; use of "LOL" and "OMG" in Internet chat rooms; Austin Powers impersonators; boy bands; telemarketers; Olsen twins movies; users of the slang "hellz yeah"; and people who say "irregardless."    Clinton said that the primary success of ASSwipe lies in its power to separate offenders from the primary source of annoyance amplification. "Initially opposed by free-speech advocates, careful ASSwipe enforcement has proven to actually strengthen the American discourse," he said. He cited the current restraining order between Rush Limbaugh and any microphone or camera as the most visible example. Limbaugh has since found a new career path by sitting in a chair in Miami and whispering segments of his show to people in their ears for $2 or a pill.     Fox News remains the recipient of the largest ASSwipe yet, forcing the entire network to disband in July 2005. Pressed for comment, Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly said, "Mmmmmffff."    This story (c) 2006 the Personal Ian McGibboney Press   Seriously, though, I don't think this kind of thing would take off in America. We're all about the noise here! And free speech. Still, those damn rattling car trunks...especially those friggin' white guys...  Speaking of Eminem, I like how CNN  urlLink stuck his picture on the story , as if he had anything to do with her choice in music. I mean, I like the Naked Gun films with O.J. Simpson; does that make me an accomplice of his? If it's true that you're associated with who you watch, then I'm going to start watching the Cate Edwards speech over and over and over and over again...  It's like I say about everything: like it if you like it, but keep it to yourself unless others want to share it with you. If I want my furniture to vibrate, well...that's my business too!

       For once, a piece of firsthand local news...   While waiting to cover a council meeting last night, I overheard a guy behind me say that John Edwards ate lunch at a restaurant in my town earlier that day. From what I'm hearing (both from this guy and a friend of mine who met him here months ago), Edwards really likes lil' ol' Lafayette, LA! I hope he brings Cate next time he stops by...   urlLink    They're invited anytime  urlLink     This particular council meeting is one I cover regularly. And it's a bit different; for one thing, Louisiana doesn't have counties, it has parishes (took a while for separation of church and state to get here); for another, Acadia Parish doesn't have a council at all, but a "police jury." Don't ask me what a police jury is, because I don't know; all I know is that police juries are often compared unfavorably to Dick Cheney. But this particular police jury, at least, is not corrupt. If it were, that would make my 30-mile drive more worth it. Ah, well.  Last night was particularly notable because election season is in full swing! Three candidates visited the Jury and glad-handed everyone. They were Francine Bouillion and Jimmy Genovese for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and Donald Cravins for U.S. Congress. I was familiar with two of the three (Cravins because I had his wife as a teacher for about two weeks in 8th grade and Bouillion because my sister apprenticed under her as part of her 8th-grade project a few months ago). The third candidate was Genovese, a trial lawyer who is running against Bouillion. He handed me his campaign card, on which a phrase immediately drew my eye. Can  you  spot it?  Hint: look for the little white lightning bolts that I helpfully added.    urlLink    Should Genovese sue himself?  urlLink     Yep, Judge Jimmy is "fair and balanced!" Like Fox News! Just wait until Bill O'Reilly hears about this! He's gonna suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue! On the other hand, we're talking about a lawyer here. And quite a colorful one at that:   "You're probably wondering where I got a name like Genovese in south Louisiana. Well, my father is from Connecticut...I was born in Opelousas (LA) and I will die in Opelousas. I know you're probably asking, ' Who is that Italian dago with the funny name? '"   I do know this: it's not generally a good idea to ask that question to a Genovese in, say, New York. But this is Louisiana. And just to give you an idea of how rural my neighboring parish is, a candidate can actually get away with calling the relentlessly mid-sized Lafayette a big city!   "Do you want someone from  Lafayette  representing you? Do we need someone else from  Lafayette  who will forget you in a New York second? Bring the cup back to the country! I'm country!"    Too bad Bouillion didn't speak, because then I could have been more Fair and Balanced in my coverage. Oh well. At this point I'm inclined toward Bouillion, not because Genovese is unqualified or a bad guy, but simply because of that "fair and balanced" thing. I mean, isn't the balanced scale enough to drive that particular point home? He could be using the term in an Al Franken sense, but that irony would probably be lost on those who think Lafayette is the big city.  Whether you are in rural Louisiana or anywhere else in America, VOTE! Find out when your next elections are (we have elections Sept. 18 and Nov. 2) and get to the polls. Do it for Cate!

       Fearing terrorist attacks on financial centers in three American cities, Bush tries to scare people into voting for him in November   BBC reports the latest pick from the Bush collection of generic threats:     urlLink Bush warns of 'nation in danger'     US President George W Bush has described America as a "nation in danger", amid warnings of possible al-Qaeda attacks on US cities.   Wow! Sure does put the "new" in "news," doesn't it? Well, this story has at least one interesting element:   "The security alert was raised to orange - the second-highest level - in parts of Washington DC, New York and   Newark  , as evidence emerged that al-Qaeda had been meticulously planning attacks on several buildings."   Look out, Newark! That's what you get for being  urlLink blue , New Jersey! And what the hell are you laughing at, Delaware? Dover's next!!  Of course, this terror alert is based on solid evidence of new intelligence reports and the potential for election tampering. By al-Qaida, I mean.   National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice described the intelligence as being  extraordinarily detailed and "unlike anything that I have seen."    Yeah, because they usually don't look at the  detailed  threats...acting on the threat of Aug. 2 will never make up for the one ignored on Aug. 6...Aug. 6, 2001, that is.   "Washington Police Chief Charles Ramsey told BBC News Online that increased security could last until the elections in November as it appeared that al-Qaeda wanted to influence the US vote."   So Bush is worried about al-Qaida's impact on the election? Shoot, I figured that's the first connection he'd want! After all, we did valiantly destroy their terrorist base by attacking Iraq and didn't at all create a new hotbed of terrorism by...Hey look! Is that a terrorist over there?!!  Just do your part as a proud American and be scared.

       Moviemaker and homophobe Vincent Gallo comes out for Bush   Zac has  urlLink a great post  on the latest showbiz person ("star" might be too strong a word) to side with the Republicans and commit to their convention in September. And, as is the case with many conservatives, Vincent Gallo is an oddball with a serious hangup on gays.  So who is Vincent Gallo? He's the actor and director behind such gems as  urlLink Buffalo '66  (in which a would-be football-player killer kidnaps a dance student as a fake girlfriend, and she goes along with it),  urlLink The Brown Bunny  (in which a racer tries to forget his lost love by straddling a motorcycle),  urlLink If You Feel Froggy, Jump  and  urlLink The Gunlover  (no phallic undertones there). He's also appeared in an eclectic mix of films over the past few decades. He's no slouch in the motion-picture industry.  He's also no slouch when it comes to peppering nearly everything he says with gay sexual references. Gallo's obsession transcends that of even the most evangelical nuts of the GOP. After all, most Republicans (except perhaps for Fred Phelps), can speak about other topics from time to time. Take a look at this compilation of quotes from the 1998 Esquire Dubious Achievement Awards, with an appropriately ironic picture:   urlLink    From the January 1999 Esquire  urlLink     Add to it this quote from the 2003 Esquire Dubious Achievement Awards:   "After his new movie,   urlLink The Brown Bunny  , became one of the lowest-rated films in the history of the British trade paper  Screen International , Vincent Gallo said, 'I'm sorry I'm not gay or Jewish, so I don't have a special-interest group of journalists that support me.'"   Zac quotes Gallo's most-recent statements to the  urlLink New York News :   "Gallo is now in New York and says he will attend the Republican National Convention later this month.  'I'm here trying to help out in any way that I can. I have made it clear that I am open in any way to promote and protect the Republican administration,'  he said. 'Let’s talk about what a wonderful president George Bush has been so far. Let’s talk about how ridiculous handicap parking is. Let’s talk about why the Puertoricans think they need to have a parade down fifth avenue.  Or for that matter why the gays do too. Why isn’t the Veterans Day parade down fifth avenue? The people who secure our nation get a couple blocks in Brooklyn while the fags and spics get Fifth Avenue? "    I'm just counting the seconds to the Republican National Convention. I hope they go all out!

       U.S. military fired 770 gays during 2003   As thin as our great military is being spread all across the world in the quest for freedom and oil, Bush is reassuring us that there is no shortage of troops. Why, our military is so large and so moral that we can evidently spare several hundred valued soldiers! Who to thank? Major Homophobia, sir! Don't you feel safer already?!!  According to an AP report posted by Freep (no, not  that   urlLink Freep !  urlLink The Detroit Free Press ), the U.S. armed forces discharged 770 people in last year for being gay. Under the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, implemented in 1994, gay soldiers can serve in the military, provided that their sexual preference is kept private; displays of homosexual behavior are grounds for discharge. I'm not sure how Tailhook and Lynndie England factor into this, but I'm sure they fit somewhere.  In what is perhaps the most disturbing statistic, the 770 discharged in 2003 was actually DOWN from 2001. In Bush's first year, the god squad discharged a record 1,227 troops. Of course, that was under the same pretext in which Clinton released nearly 9,000 troops for the same reason under the infamous "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. And it was Bush's prerogative to continue discharging due to his unquestionable mandate. And anyway, Bush "won" in part because of his rhetoric about Clinton gutting the military, so...uh...you know, I can't even think of a sarcastic crack for that one. It's simply beyond parody.  So, to sum up: Bush is calling up reservists and ex-soldiers in a backdoor draft, yet we're discharging troops left and right because they're  GAY ? Didn't Bush learn anything from firing six of his best Arab-English translators for homosexuality? As I recall, we kind of had a translation problem after that.  They do have a point, though; look at what happens when sexuality is allowed to run rampant in the military!   urlLink    Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Tape  urlLink     Around the time the Clinton administration was debating "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," I remember reading a letter addressing the topic in  urlLink American Legion Magazine . The previous issue had covered the controversy, and a reader responded by expressing her disgust over not allowing gays in the military:   "I think we should REQUIRE all homosexual men and women to join the military, and go out and fight for the freedom that the rest of us value so much."   This is exactly why the religious right should never, ever,  ever  have power in politics.

       urlLink    Signs of insanity  urlLink     Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church was back at it again for the Democratic Convention, leading his protest team to protest the filthy sodomites who have the nerve to not be Fred Phelps. The Topeka-based preacher is known worldwide as America's most prolific protester against all things fabulous. When not traveling the country picketing gay funerals, school boards or picketing just for the hell of it, Phelps operates the ever-popular site  urlLink God Hates Fags . Doesn't this man ever have time for church?  Phelps exemplifies everything that I find absolutely NASTY about religion. First off is the holier-than-thou attitude. Here's a tip, not just for Phelps, but for any budding young person who strives to save my soul: before you get on your high horse and tell me that everything I do and support is evil, try to have an ALTERNATIVE. Or, at the very least, try to LOOK and/or ACT like someone I would want to emulate. At this point, there's nothing about Phelps, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Sun Myung Moon, etc. that makes me even REMOTELY hope that they are models of what awaits in heaven. How can heaven be paradise if it is full of holy rollers?  And another thing: what is with your obsession with gays? Okay, you hate them and you say God hates them. Fine, whatever you say, Lord Master. But damn, do you ever think about anything else? You harp endlessly about gays and their sexual practices, which you describe in lurid detail. Somewhere along the line you had to have researched this. At some point, you had that thought in your head: " So how exactly does gay sex work? What does it mean to 'pitch' and 'catch?' What angle is most realistic for two men engaged in anal sex? How can I draw a logo that combines the logistics of sodomy with the simple practicality of a school-crossing sign?"     urlLink    Penises censored for good taste  urlLink     Were rough drafts involved in the making of this sign? Did the final result go through committee? " Gee, Fred, I like the overall tone, but must you be so subtle? "  What really is up with those signs? "   Thank God for Sept. 11   ?" If that isn't Christian compassion at its finest, then I don't know what is! I dare say, I never was much for this Christianity until the blessing that was 9/11! Glory be to God! Such a forgiving, not to mention accurate, deity. Let's look at that first photo again:   urlLink    But who does God LOVE?  urlLink     I'd say that God has a little surprise of his own ready to unleash upon Phelps (His radiance soooo brings out the fashionable whiteness of Fred's macho cowboy hat). And I notice that at least two of them are football fans, what with the jerseys they're sporting. Mmmm....buff football players in tights! Hitting each other hard! Ooh, you like that, don't you?   urlLink    I sure do love my football!  urlLink     I worry about the long-term effect that Phelps' hateful actions are going to have, not just on the targets of the hatred and their families, but on his impressionable parishioners themselves. Won't anyone think of the children??   urlLink    Hell, never mind...   urlLink     If God hates gays, as Phelps says, then let it be decided in heaven. Meanwhile, some of us have lives to live down here and don't care how those of different mores, sexual or otherwise, live theirs.

       You are the first to see this brand-spanking-new column that I'm submitting for the first issue of   urlLink  The Vermilion    for Fall 2004. It's more localized than I generally veer; still, I'm interested in what my friends in the blogosphere think of it...     Hello friends! In light of the times we live in, we all have to stay safe. Because let’s face it: something will happen to you this semester. It might be great and it might be terrible. It might happen in the Quad or in Griffin Hall. Or somewhere else. At any time of day or night. You could be in a bar, or perhaps in your car. It might happen at the Keg. Or on your leg. It might happen in a box. It might happen with a fox. It might happen in a chair. It might happen when no one’s there. So damn, Sam! Don’t eat the green eggs and ham!  How can I be so certain that something will happen to you? Because things like these have happened before. What should you do in anticipation of something happening? Well, don’t let it affect your activities in any way. Go on with your life! Just make sure to be fully alert at all times. And watch what you say.  Keeping in line with our government’s guidelines for fighting terrorism, I have prepared a primer for you on how to prevent things from happening:  1) Don’t say or do anything even remotely controversial. Because of the diversity of this great nation, you are bound to affect someone; so it’s probably best that you stay in bed and never leave your room. But even that might annoy your roommate and anyone relying on you to perform some kind of job or go to class.  2) Don’t give out any identifying information. This includes, but is not limited to, any handwritten documents such as schoolwork and personal checks, no matter how much instructors or clerks demand it of you. Even typed work, cash and debit cards will have traces of your DNA on them. Avoid doing any assignment of any kind or buying stuff, and by all means DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING!  3) Avoid any and all personal contact. While college offers an incredible opportunity to meet people, it also provides for trouble. How do you know that the person to whom you’re talking isn’t a recruiter for a clandestine cult? If they’re upfront about it, avoid them. If they’re friendly, seem harmless and appear to belong to no organization of any kind, well, that’s even worse! This suspicion should extend beyond peers to include professors, UL staff, SGA, frat boys and the university police. Things happen around people.  4) Do not venture into uncertain territory. With such a multitude of prominent landmarks, Lafayette is rife with potential happenings. You’re better off in your designated living area, unless that happens to be in one of those prominent landmarks. Nightclubs are massive points for human convergence, as are local churches, Cajun Field, Dupre Library, the Student Union, the Cajundome, pedestrian crosswalks, Acadiana Mall and Borden’s. Avoid all of these areas at all costs. And don’t even  consider  the UL shuttle buses.  5) DO NOT HAVE FUN! Fun leads to the kind of things that can distract one from watching for something happening. These distractions include: drinking, partying, making friends, meeting a new lover, “going out” on “the weekends,” games, sports, movies, music, hobbies, the Internet, working out and reading. Such frivolous pursuits only allow for something to happen to you that might change the course of your life.  If you follow all of these tips, I guarantee you that you will have a safe experience during your college career. You will also minimize your risk of ever being the unwitting subject of something happening. Unless you picked up this paper, in which case you’ve already screwed up. Oops!

      Nick Bouterie,  urlLink The Conservative Cajun , and I have a semi-debate going over columns that each of us wrote. A quick bit of background: I have written the liberal column for the University of Louisiana  urlLink Vermilion  since June 2002. At one time (April-November 2003), Nick was the conservative columnist. The two columns run next to each other on the same page, tombstone style, with a political cartoon at the bottom illustrating one of our topics (usually mine, since the cartoonist aligns himself with me). This format would be perfect for a point-counterpoint; unfortunately, this proved to be really difficult when I tried it with Nick's predecessor.  In the October 15, 2003 issue, however, Nick and I coincidentally wrote on the hot-button issue of the time: Rush Limbaugh's racist remark and subsequent termination from ESPN. Both Nick and I are big football fans, so a lot of heart went into these columns.  Why am I bringing this up? Because of the debate mentioned above. Nick has posted  urlLink his column  on his  urlLink page  (scroll down to Aug. 7) and we're trading opinions on whose was better. Not that it matters to me, but he doesn't think I  urlLink link to him  enough  urlLink  ("-- Hey, Icon  [my nickname] , as much as I link you in my posts, how about returning the favor?? Jack-a**!!)  , so I'll humor  urlLink him  and publish my own column from that date. Again, you can read his take  urlLink here .    McNabb's Rush Attack    By Ian McGibboney Oct. 15, 2003    Many intellectuals are fond of trashing sports, arguing that they distract people from the real world. I don't understand this at all because sports and politics are so similar. Both are protecting your allies and fighting for justice.  I am fierce about loyalty when it comes to my teams. I liked Jake Delhomme as a Cajun and a Saint, but not as a Panther. I despise the Carolina Panthers--unless they're playing the tlanta Falcons, in which case Jake is my favorite player ever.  This also works in politics; right now, I am firmly behind Wesley Clark for the Democratic nomination; but, if Howard Dean or John Kerry were eventually nominated, I'd vote for them in a second against Bush.  [What foresight!]   Such is the case with Donovan McNabb. Although he has the coolest name in the NFL, the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback has always seemed to me like just another opponent. That was before Rush went after him, calling McNabb the creation of a media desperate for a black quarterback to succeed. Rush should know; he uses the same tactic every time he overrates George W. Bush   out of desperation for a Republican president to succeed.      For the record, this is exactly what Rush said on his segment of ESPNs pregame show  [NFL Sunday Countdown] : "I think what we have had here is a little social concern in the NFL. The media has been very desirous  [sic]  that a black quarterback do well. There is a little hope invested in McNabb, and he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he did not deserve."      The world of sports criticism isn't exactly the world's most civilized front. Any sports-radio show will net at least a few yahoos whose comments make Limbaugh's look downright polite. Still, national sports commentary is a very touchy field. It devoured its best ever, Howard Cosell, for calling a black wide receiver a "monkey" in 1983. Cosell, definitely not a racist, was known to use the word "monkey" as an affectionate term for his grandson. Regardless, he was shunned from the airwaves forever  [mainly by self-exile] . This was also the case with Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder, whose comment that blacks had better athletic genes from their days in the jungle got him fired from CBS in 1988.  [Actually, it was a comment about selective slave-breeding. But close.]   Rush should have known better than to broach the race topic. But ESPN knew exactly what to expect from its controversial new analyst. In fact, critics of ESPN's decision to hire him cited this as their number-one concern. Over the years, the broadcaster of disaster has talked endlessly about race on his radio show. And we're not talking about the playoff race. To wit:      "Have you ever noticed how all newspaper composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson?"      "Blacks are 12 percent of America. Who the hell cares what they think?"      McNabb is well-aware of Limbaugh's resonance with far too many people. "I'm sure he's not the only one who feels that way," he said. "But, it's shocking to actually hear that on national TV. An apology would do no good because he obviously thought about it before he said it."      Dead on, Donovan.      Rush has refused to apologize, saying that his comment has caused furor only because everyone knows he is right. By logical extension, Limbaugh must want us to think he resigned from ESPN on principle. But it's more likely that he resigned to cover his butt and spend more quality time with his OxyContin.      Meanwhile, in New Orleans, Aaron Brooks is basking in all of the adulation he is getting from the media for being a black quarterback.

       urlLink    Can't spell "crook" without "rock"  urlLink     Thirty years ago today, we no longer had President Richard Nixon to kick around anymore. Ten years ago on Apr. 22, we no longer had Nixon at all.  But what a legacy the man left! After all, no one stays in the political spotlight for 40 years without having left some kind of impression on the people. And, despite his well-deserved status as one of the most heinous and unethical men ever to hold high public office (a lofty accomplishment), Nixon did do a lot of things that would make today's Republicans vomit their caviar:   --Was the Vice President under Dwight Eisenhower, a decent Republican --Opened diplomatic and trade relations with China, closed since 1949 --Entered multiple worldwide treaties to curb the proliferation of nukes --Activated the Clean Air Act --Attempted to create a national minimum welfare wage --Changed the draft to a lottery system, later abolishing it altogether --Oversaw the drop in minimum voting age from 21 to 18 --Oversaw the beginning of the cease-fire process in Vietnam   Measures like the above compelled Michael Moore to call Nixon "the most liberal president of the last 30 years." Still, Nixon still has a reputation for being something of a bad guy:   --Achieved electoral success with his "Southern Strategy," which basically amounted to reaching out to pissed-off Dixiecrats, whose party was starting to treat blacks as human beings, and turning them on to the Republicans --Was elected partially on his empty promise that he had a "secret strategy" for winning the Vietnam War. Aside from having no discernible point, the "secret strategy" to stop the war apparently consisted of expanding the war into Cambodia and Laos and waiting years to broker any kind of withdrawal --Nominated William Rehnquist to the Supreme Court, a curse that still haunts us today --Was so insecure about the frightening prospect of facing George McGovern in the 1972 election that he hired five men to plant bugging devices in the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate Hotel. Nixon was such a big fan of bugging that he even  bugged his own office , providing much entertainment for haters for years to come --Was seen several times in the 1980s at circuses, where he was often photographed with clowns (some habits die hard) --Met Dan Quayle in 1988 and remarked, "I was surprised to find out that he is not the intellectual midget portrayed in the media."   Richard Milhous Nixon died from complications of a stroke suffered days before his death on April 22, 1994. He is survived by his two daughters, Tricia and Julie, and a Republican Party that has done everything to distance itself from this bad man by making themselves look even worse:   urlLink    The Three Stooges: Ho, Scary and Surly  urlLink     Rest in Peace, Nixon.

      August 9 seems to be a common denominator for  urlLink shit hitting the fan !  On this day in:   1945 --Because heavy cloudiness covered the military target of Kokura (and could have caused the bomb to stray off-course, thus killing the wrong set of innocent civilians), U.S. forces drop the 22-kiloton "Fat Boy" atomic bomb on Nagasaki instead. Just like that.  Incidentally, my grandfather was a Navy Seabee at this time, and he stumped on Nagasaki just after its destruction. He told of Japanese civilians wailing, burnt and dropping dead of radiation. He also marveled at the virtual eradication of most of the buildings in the area, while the roads and highways remained untouched. Shades of the Road Warrior. Still, he said was grateful for the bomb because "it shocked us back to reality." Whether it would have been the bomb or an invasion, he said, massive loss of life was inevitable. War is hell.   1960 --Timothy Leary, the professor-turned psychedelic icon who coined the phrase "tune in, turn on, drop out," takes his first trip next to a swimming pool by eating five (!!) psilocybin mushrooms. At some point, it apparently occurred to Leary to note the date of this occurrence. Whoa, dude.   1969 --Monkees-reject Charles Manson, pissed that Terry Melcher (the Simon Cowell of his day) would not let him on "American Idol," orders his cult to kill the inhabitants of one of Melcher's homes. Among the victims was the eight-months-pregnant actress Sharon Tate along with her friends (coffee heiress Abigail Folger, heiress gigolo Voytek Frykowski, hairstylist Jay Sebring and Steve Parent, some kid who just happened to be in the driveway).  Manson's rationale: he wanted to start a race war by hoping that white people would think that black people killed the white people. Nice try. It didn't help his cause that he chose the home of someone who had pissed him off personally, and that the killers had left words written all over the place that just  screamed  whitey, and that the Manson Family were constantly getting arrested and treated for the clap. Manson called his little planless plan "Helter Skelter," after the hit Beatles song that told him to do it. With lyrics such as, "Tell me, tell me the answer / May be a lover but you ain't no dancer," "Helter Skelter" is a very dangerous song indeed.   1974 --President Richard Nixon, not a crook, resigns for being a crook. Okay, so shit hitting the fan isn't always bad.   1995 --Head Deadhead Jerry Garcia dead from lack of heroin, causing fans everywhere to use even more drugs than usual to Get By.
