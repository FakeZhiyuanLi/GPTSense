       Below is a small list of capabilities that would be ideal for the Nintendo DS to support. Please feel free to comment criticise my list, and please also append any other vaguely realistic features you would like to see! 

 

 Dual Screens 

 While the ideas for the dual screens have already been flowing over from articles and message boards, there still are a few options which may not yet be obvious. Here are a few of them. 

 One of the big complaints nowadays with role playing games is the fact that cut-scenes, vital to the story and only playble once, are taking far too long and not skippable. Another major complaint is that these take a moment or so to load on disc-based systems. The advantage to using the DS in this case is that a player can watch a cut-scene on the upper, non-stylus screen, while the action takes place on the bottom screen simultaneously. Also, with the DS using traditional cartridges, loading times are very minimal, meaning that there is no "screen lag" in action leading up to a cut-scene. 

 For that matter, though, having one gigabit of memory to work with is quite generous. In fact, it does not seem that farfetched to make a compressed two-hour movie that still plays rather smoothly. Or, for something that is completely different, the same movie (or cut-scene, if that kind of thing appeals to you) could be made from two different angles. 

 Wireless Capabilities 

 The wireless capabilities of the DS extend some one hundred feet or so, and thus are perfect for crowded cities with lots of gamers. Funny how saying that conjures images of Tokyo and the like. Frankly, there aren't as many Nintendo buyers here in North America, and I can only assume the same for Europe and most other non-Japan locales. For us, then, the major selling point is 802.11--wireless play over Internet. As such, there are various things which would appear necessary for this feature. 

 In order to have successful online play, especially from a company such as Nintendo, there must be no significant monthly fee, if any. People play a handheld device from time to time, in general. Charging a fee seems to be excessive for someone who merely wants to play against a brother or sister a few states or continents away. Having said this, however, Nintendo misses a huge marketing opportunity if they don't provide a server with some sort of realtime list of online players. The cost will be on Nintendo, but the opportunities are interesting. Imagine the equivalent of a free Battle.net. This almost peer-to-peer system of online play could very well be a perfect online strategy for Nintendo--play online, pay no fee, huge community, and buy great games. In fact, Nintendo even gets game revenue, free advertising, and almost nonexistant server fees (compared to conventional online game servers). The maintenance on a page with a bunch of IP addresses is undoubtedly less than a server trying to track UT200x 

 Chat Function 

 While everyone has already seen text and pen messaging, there are a few features that either have not been confirmed or do not exist.  Firstly, and most importantly, is chat over 802.11b (or Wi-Fi). Since most people do not have a pen device at home, being able to connect to several people over the Internet for the price of a wireless router is very practical. 

 Next, having the option of attaching a keyboard to the DS would be useful for extended periods of text messaging. However, it would seem more useful to see how well the chat system is accepted before deciding on development for either a peripheral keyboard or a PS2/USB to Ext converter (PS2 being a method of connection from keyboard to computer). Alternatively, the DS could be used in conjunction with a Nintendo Chat client which merges pen messaging with text messages typed on a keyboard. 

 Thirdly, having the option to do voice chat over the Internet is appealing. Most people do have the option to do voice chat in their favourite instant messaging program, and a good portion of these people use this function. The DS, however, could take two audiences with voice chat. The people who already use voice chat may enjoy the ease of using a device such as the DS to chat; after all, holding a microphone and a speaker in one compact unit amounts to less desktop clutter from microphone stands and speakers. As for those who have not yet tried voice chat, the DS provides a unique, and potentially less intimidating, to talk to friends. With any luck, the DS could replace the telephone for any two gaming friends.
