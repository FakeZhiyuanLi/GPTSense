       Ugh i hate people from this town and all the towns around here. Why do people care what goes on in other peoples life? I mean if they are so intrested in other peoples maybe its a sign for them to get their own. People go out of their way to find out whats going on in someone elses life shooot just leave people alone.

       Why does it have to be so hard? I mean everyone looks everyday some just are afraid to admit it. We are all looking for our significant other or someone to pass the time. So many people think that they have found it when in reality they have just lowered their standards to avoid being alone. One of my bests... there he is so crazy about one girl and her "friends" are making her life miserable. So being the sweet, caring, wonderful guy that he is he is going to do whatever it takes to make her happy. And that means putting aside her emotions."Fall,with you i fall so fast.... i can hardly catch my breathe i hope it lasts." We all think we found that person and slowly but surely their faults come out and we either look past it or end it right there. WE all need to know that nobody is perfect and we need to get it through our head. Love is it all just an allusion.

        &nbsp;Well here i go.Friday night was freakin awesome! J.D.&nbsp;and me pulled&nbsp;it off!&nbsp;Robert had no idea. Those guys are like brothers to me there so cool and fun to be around. but anyways back to the real stuff...&nbsp;Ok what am i suppose to think? You tell me "every relationship is based on trust" "just trust me" but then i get all these mixed messages. Is she gone for good or is there something there? I know you aren't going to get over her that fast but i dont know if i should back off and leave you alone or not. What am i saying i dont even know if you care about me like that. Im just so tired of getting hurt relationship after relationship and honestly i dont know why i put myself out there like this. In the words of robert... why can't things be like 1993? Those days that was our childhood and things were so much easier.
