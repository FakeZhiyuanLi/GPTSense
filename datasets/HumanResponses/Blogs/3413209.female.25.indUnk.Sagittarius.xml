      So it's Thursday, meaning it's not Friday.  AHHHHHH!  Thursday are always killers for me because I have accomplished most of my weekly work and basically they aren't Fridays, meaning fun and sleep. Ahhhh sleep. So, I have the Thursday blues. I am not quite sure what to do with myself. I could email Celeste, but unfortunately for me and fortunately for her, she had a company sponsored event. And, Geoff is busy at work, so I can only bug him occasionally, and I can't bug him now because he signed off IM.  MMMMMM, I could email all of my friends, shop online, stare into space pretending like I am profoundly thinking, or I could just sit here and eat starbursts like I am doing. Yummy. I am eating the Tropical ones and they are tasty, although it is almost like eating flavored wax. Maybe I just enjoy having something in my mouth, or something to do. Chewing is very technical you know. You chew, you swirl and you swallow.  No sickos, you don't chew! So last night, I hung out with my man.  Two nights in a row for us must be some sort of record. It was nice. It is nice just to have him close by. Basically that's all I care about. So enough sappiness, as Geoff likes to say..... Back to reality and boredom.

      So this is the story of how Geoff and I met one fateful night.  It changed my whole life around.  If only I knew what I know now....... I had recently ended a ten month relationship and I was pretty devastated, so two weeks later and Valentine's weekend I hopped on a plane and headed out to San Francisco to visit my friend Celeste. If only I knew what I know now. So we decided to bail on Friday night, but head out big time on Saturday. We ended up at this bar called the red room. I have no idea why we ended up at this place of all places, but thank god for that. SO at this point, I am pretty drunk and on my way into the bag. I decide to sit down for awhile, and I glance around briefly, and at one point notice this fairly attractive guy, (nope not my man). Anyway, in the meantime, this annoying guy directly in front of me keeps uttering all of these brash comments to the point where I can't contain myself any longer. Therefore, I bust out with, "hey you, yeah cocky ass, shut up!" I not only say it once, but oh probably a handful of times. At this point he begins to get annoyed, and we start talking.  So his other friend, the cute one I had noticed previously, and who's name I discover is Jeff, no, not my Geoff, attempts to break it up, as does Celeste. Well, after everything is sorted out, Jeff introduces me to Geoff, who is in the corner talking to a handful of girls. No, not my guy!  Yeah that never ends. We end up sitting together and talking for the rest of the night. I wish I could tell you what it was about, but I have no idea unfortunately or fortunately. Apparently, at some point I follow him to the bathroom and plant one on him as well. I don't think he was complaining. After that in my drunken state I decide to invite him back to my friend's place where I am staying. Geoff decides to drive, and Celeste of course checks his credentials. Well on the way to Geoff's car, which is brand new by the way, I decide I need to urinate, and do so in an alley. Damn, I am hot! Now I know what he sees in me. Well we finally get to his car and while he is paying I attempt to drive it. Fortunately for Geoff, I am so drunk I can't figure anything out. Finally,  we get to Celeste's, and apparently I sit on Geoff's lap and pull him into Celeste's roommate's room who is out of town. I think Geoff is lying about this. I won't go into details about what happened next, but I fell off the bed and babbled on about my ex all night long.  Yup I am hot! However, Geoff was so intrigued by me that he left me his card (he is so classy) and asked for my number. Amazingly enough he called me later, but I departed the next day for Kansas City, and didn't think I would ever see that Geoff guy again. Seriously, I could hardly remember what he looked like. However when I got back to KC, I randomly found his card and decided to email him.  That was a year and a half ago. I moved out to California 6 months ago. Now, I can't even imagine him as a stranger or my life without him. The moral of the story is that you can meet an amazing person that can entirely change the course of your life when you least expect it.

      So Celeste asked me to write something personal, therefore I decided to include her.  I have known Celeste for about 20 years. We met in Wiscasset, Maine, where I am from, but she summers.  Yes, folks she is a summer person.  Not to be confused with being a snob though.  Well, one day in rec, which is a day camp for those of you that don't know, I was minding my own business sitting on the yellow school bus awaiting another outing, when  young Celeste (I would describe her but she hasn't changed one iota) approached me and said, "Hey do you want to play truth or Dare?" To which I replied, "sure, " not understanding the true implications of truth or dare with Celeste Fowles, which we recently revived on a long ass trip back from Santa Cruz.  So back to the story, truth or dare. Ok, we were not playing a nice little game of truth or dare, this girl dared me to do crazy things such as running naked outside of her house (which is on a busy street) to touch a tree or sitting around her house naked.  There was definitely a naked theme in our games. Ummmmm interesting. For those of you who know me, know I did these things too. Other memories of Celeste include her awesome voice, yes for those of you who know her understand that I am being extremely sarcastic. I mean she is worse then Geoff and that is saying something. Well, she used to walk around camp singing Bar Bar Bar Barbaran. It was lovely, especially when she sang it at such a high octave totally out of key.  Cover your ears folks.  Viet especially! Well, one summer in Wiscasset after another dull day of listening to 80's love songs, singing and discussing the loves of our lives, we decided we needed to pursue something a little different. WE decided to write our own dictionary.  Most people would imagine that this would be a little fun project,oh no we took this very seriously. We had words like extrbutfeeling, which would mean: sticking your finger in your butt due to boredom or something. That was an interesting dictionary.  I don't ever know what happened to it. Oh, note whenever you called Celeste's house, you had to be prepared to speak to every one of her family members before speaking to Celeste and you also had to be prepared to have people pick up the phone at any moment and ask you questions.  A lively group.  Therefore I had to come up with alias names. My names said in a interesting voice of course, would be things like Martha Washington and Betty Ford.  Well, that only lasted for so long because her family thought it was amusing and they wanted me to come up with other names. Well of course there was the monkey dance that I perfected for her family and that her brother asks me to do to this day. "Heya Mister you wanna buy a monkey." Then there was sneaking into her parent's room, putting her mom's bra on our heads and running around the house. I won't go into the rest. Celeste knows....... Most of all 4th of July rocked! Every 4th of July I went to Celeste's house to sit on the lawn with her family and catch the candy.  However, if any of you know Celeste she loves her candy and doesn't like to share it. SO damn, those 5 year olds were pushed and shoved out of the way as Celeste made a beeline for any candy in her site.  Typically I was laid up with an ankle problem, so at least I had crazy Celeste trying to get my candy.  The best pictures of us, are the one's where I have my awesome red high tops and Celeste is in her tight stretchy pants with one of her millions of colored matching head bands. She must of had 50. So the accumulation of 4th of July ended at the pier with the entire town, and us in search of cute boys to dance with.  Man we were boy crazy, Well, Celeste was until she started dating old man Riley! So as you all can ascertain, Celesters hasn't changed one iota.  Cheers to summer time in Wiscasset!

      I hate the copier at my work.  It seems to work well for everyone else, but for me it stinks! It is my Arch Nemesis.  Lately I have had the immense privilege of using it quite frequently due to the lay offs at work.  It is driving me insane in the membrane.  Not only does it NEVER do what I want it to do, it speaks to me in the words of beep beep beep beep and this obnoxious red blinking light. And, seriously when the paper gets stuck, who can ever locate where it went.  It is almost like the machine ate it up in one swift bite. I mean it has little blinking lights on where to locate the paper, but seriously where are those areas. I mean I would have to be a copier repair person to locate the damn paper. Then when you attempt to locate the paper and you are turning all of those stupid arrow thinga majiggies, you get ink all over your hands and then you touch the paper that you just copied and you have to begin the process all over again. I suppose I could never make it in this world as a copier repair person. Nope. Nor as a secretary for someone.  Wow that would be bad. I think I need my own secretary to make copies for me.  Jamison my coworker enjoys sitting there laughing as I scream and curse the stupid machine.  So what would take most intelligent people ummmm 10 mins, takes me 45 mins. I wonder if my boss ever wonders what's up? Probably not. Who knows what she is doing up there anyway. Also, the fax on this machine blows as well. I attempt to send a fax, but I swear it is never the correct number. Admittedly it is sometimes me confusing the number, oops, but other times it is the damn machine.  Once I attempted to fax this one number, oh I don't know 10 times or so, but it continually returned with a busy number. Eventually our department received a fax from this number that demanded we cease from trying to fax them anymore because I guess it was a number to some lawn care place.  Don't know how that happened. So that fax it now posted above the fax machine with my name on top. Ha ha ha ha.  My coworkers are so funny. Jaminson says he wonders how I can function on a daily basis because I can't run the copier machine.  But, I am telling you, the copier is my Arch Nemesis.  It has nothing to do with me!
