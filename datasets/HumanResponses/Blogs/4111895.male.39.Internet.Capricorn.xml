      Today I need to report the loss of long-time local aviator Bill Law. I was a student at Bill Law Aviation and I had just wrapped up ground school this week at his facility. My thoughts and prayers go out to Bill's family, friends and employees.  I had met and spoke with Bill several times. A month of Saturday's ago my sons met him and my youngest Nathan was more than happy to ask him questions...especially about "water planes". Bill was kind and tried to answer Nathan's inquisition as best he could.  Bill alerted flight controllers that there were engine problems and he was trying to reach an airstrip a few miles away (Ledgedale). The plane was traveling from Batavia to Rochester. Witnesses say the plane clipped several trees, breaking off branches, and then hit the ground a few hundred yards from a section of houses. Bill was flying his twin engine Piper Navajo, it burst into flames on impact.  If you have been following my Flight Log you know that I have been frustrated with my flight instructor recently. Because of this issue I had already met and scheduled my flight training at a new school with a new instructor. Sadly the school that I will be attending at Ledgedale Air Park is only a few miles from where Bill's plane went down.  As tragic as today's event is I still want to pursue my dream of soloing and then earn my pilot certificate. This event reminded me that bad things can happen to the best trained and most experienced pilots. Flying is as glorious as it is unforgiving.     High Flight   Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of earth And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings; Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth Of sun-split clouds - and done a hundred things You have not dreamed of - wheeled and soared and swung High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung My eager craft through footless halls of air. Up, up the long delirious, burning blue, I've topped the windswept heights with easy grace Where never lark, or even eagle flew - And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod The high untresspassed sanctity of space, Put out my hand and touched the face of God.

      Just as me and my crew chef were about to indulge in vanilla ice cream with real strawberries and blueberries, the tones at the base went off at 10:30pm. It was a priority 1 (RED = lights and sirens) to the same nursing home that were at last week....this time minus the panhandler. We were told of several injuries that they might have had, so we were planning ahead as to what we were going to need on scene. Once we got there we made sure that we brought a backboard, collars, and few other items to the location just in case.  The patient was in their mid-90's and injuries included a prior hip fracture. They were on the floor but aware and alert enough to answer questions. Apparently they fell and most likely re-injured the previous injury. Since they appeared stable I called in to dispatch to tell the ALS techs that were driving in from the city to go GREEN and not RED. After taking vitals and with a sign off from the ALS crew, we began the backboarding process. We were actually pretty well organized and the lifting and loading went nicely. After a 17 mile ride we made it to the hospital and the patient was still very stable.  Once in the hospital our patient began to hallucinate a little bit and I held their hand to relax them as much as I could. It was a little strange to get a call like this. Earlier in the shift we talked briefly about whether it was better to die with all of your faculties or age to the point of being dependent on others? Our patient had obviously chosen the latter...or at least this path was chosen for them. As time went by the hallucinations became more interesting. They were imagining all kinds of things such as opening bottles, falling, balloons on strings, drinking milkshakes, and eventually we made it to licking ice cream cones. Now the circle seemed complete...our ice cream was waiting for us back a the base where we thought about whether it was better to die with all of your faculties or age...well as far as I'm concerned...if I get to enjoy ice cream they way the patient was...I'm all for aging!  - Good Call -

      This past weekend I played the role of Superdad and took my 8 year old son to the Watkins Glen International - for the SIRIUS At The Glen Nascar race. We had a great view of the track from turn 2 and most importantly my son got to see his favorite racer... urlLink Jeff Gordon . It was our first time at any race so I figured why not make it a true event. It's always nice to see your child glow with excitement at seeing in person what he could only dream of before. It was definitely a dream come true for the both of us...and lots of fun. Win or Lose...just being there was all that mattered.      Jeff Gordon #24

      I noticed that I am writing way more than I intended in this blog. I'm torn between making this a personal log or a professional log since I had things happen that would cover both topics. No since wasting time...  Today I trained a client to use our product and conducted an interview for someone to back-fill for me as we move forward with expansion plans. This stuff burned up about two thirds of my day and the rest I spent hunting down product images and conducting page edits.  On a personal note...I did get to IM with a nice lady from Toronto named Anita. I spent some time doing that but couldn't afford to do it for a long time....too much stuff to do. I'd write more about her but I know she reads this...which is ok...I enjoyed our chat and want to learn more about her. She's 35 and doesn't need children of her own, but it's ok that I have mine since she likes kids anyway. This is a plus!!! My kids already have a mother so there is no pressure to fill that void.  That's all for now! - time to hit the shower and then bed.

      Tonight was the last class of flight school for me. I turned in my final and suffered through a badly taught class involving flight planning. My flight instructor is moving out of her place into a place of her own away from the husband. This really sucks. She can't fly this weekend because of this and I get to suffer for it. I'm beside myself. I'm going to PLAN B on this. I will get her sign off so that I can take the FAA Written Exam and move on...move on to a different school that is. She's already trying to get me to fly during the day, during the week...well I have a job and I just can't swing that. Always a road block...somewhere...she's really done downhill the last few weeks. Well now I get to say..."been there"..."done that"..."got the tee shirt"...since that was the level of support I received through my separation.  Blue skies and calm winds,  Barry

      This is my first "personal" blog log and it figures that I would wait until almost midnight to write it, so please excuse the typos.  I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I managed to renew my lease today during lunch. I made sure that it was a six-month lease just like the last one. I got the nerve to ask about carpeting since mine has had it! The good news is that my carpet is over 10 years old - in fact it's 14 years old and qualifies for replacement. On Friday they will come down and inspect it. Perhaps they are going to do some carbon dating on it just to confirm its age! The bad news is that if I'm really tired of running into the bat in the basement when I do laundry at night I should call 9-1-1. Yes, they told me to call 9-1-1 and ask for animal control so they can come down and remove it. Who's paying rent to whom here??? I say screw it. I'm going to keep the bat in the basement and if I get lucky I'll get a chance to beat the hell out of it as though it was the lady from the management of the complex! Why is it that for the mouse in the ceiling I call them, but for a bat I have to call 9-1-1. Is there a special book or something that I need to buy to lookup who to call depending on the phylum or species of the animal in the building?  On a sadder note...in 10 minutes it's going to be August 11th. This would have been my 14th wedding anniversary if only that damn divorced didn't get in the way. I leave a few pictures up around the apartment just so my boys can see that we use to be one whole family. Perhaps on the 15th anniversary I will remove them for good, destroy the champaign glasses and bury the memories deep in a dusty closet. Then years after I am dead and gone, when people find them, I won't have to worry about explaining what happened...they will see only the good and not the bad - and never be the wiser.  Sweet memories Flashing very quickly by Reminding me And giving me a reason why I know that My goal is more than a thought I'll be there When I teach what I've been taught And I've been taught...  End Transmission...

      So far I haven't written anything about my professional career due to time issues, fear not...here goes nothing:  I have been a professional web developer since 1995 and from that time to the present I have served as an Internet consultant and account manager for several Internet firms in the Rochester, New York area. I also own my own consulting firm called  urlLink Orlando Web Services .  As a consultant I have assisted many business executives and local marketing agencies in developing and supporting their web initiatives. My responsibilities generally include project planning, layout designing, content development, application training and ongoing site management and consulting.  I have assisted in developing web sites and email campaigns for nationally known companies such as Kodak, Xerox, MasterCard, Citizen Communications and Element K. In addition to these clients I was directly responsible for handling the daily support issues for approximately 70 clients using an Internet marketing suite called SMART Internet Marketing. I currently serve 41 accounts as the Lead Account Manager/Consultant for a complete Internet Marketing Solution known as  urlLink Cazbah . To date we have 60 accounts and are expanding our operations. I will become the Operations Manager as soon as I can train someone like myself to take over my responsibilities.  My professional goals include achieving franchise proto-type status with Cazbah, expanding my consulting business, improving my programming skills in the area of PHP and MySQL and gain more Internet marketing experience.  Again...I work too hard and need to get out and relax more....but I said that last year too.

      Well it's Monday night and I am at the base again for my normal shift. No calls...no waiting...free pizza and chicken fingers along with ice cream. I read through and quized myself on chapters 9 and 10 in preparation for a quiz that I don't need to take Wednesday night. I can use the study time. I don't want to blow off  anything  related to flying. I want to go solo as soon as I'm prepared mentally and from an education stand point. Dreams do come true...and they can happen to you...if you bust your butt!!!

      Bad day! I was scheduled to go flying in about an hour and a half, but my flight instructor just cancelled today AND Sunday. This is not cool, but I know she is going through issues at home so I will let it pass. I have PLAN B in my pocket if this continues....which I hope it won't. I know she loves flying as much as I do so I hope this is just a minor issue.  Plan B involves a newer plane at another field with a different instructor, it's just amazing how much you can do on an extended lunch. I will see her on 8/11 and will see if she can go flying this Saturday...if not...shame on her.

      Well ground school is finally wrapping up. I picked up the final exam to do at home and will turn it in on 8/11. The exam has 60 questions and I must get an 85% to get my instructors sign off so that I can take the FAA Written Exam. I have no doubt that I will pass and can't wait to get this the hell out of the way.

      I volunteer at least one day a week at a local volunteer ambulance corp. My shift runs from 6pm until 5am the following morning. It's insane that I volunteer at all, not because I don't want to...but because I already work 50+ hours a week as an internet consultant. This usually means home by 5:30 am and off to work by 7:30 am. For the record I volunteer between 50 - 60 hours a month which is what I mean by insane.  Generally...things are quiet because of where I volunteer, which is in a small village away from the big city...but of course last night (or I should say at 3 am today) we got the call. An elderly woman with chest pains...a red call...an ALS tech on route from the big city...we got the suction ready...we got the AED ready. When we arrived on scene the elderly woman was sitting upright in a wheel chair and was doing well. No breathing problems...slight discomfort in a few places, but this apparently was going on for days and she picked this morning to call it in.  Anyway, I called dispatch and told the ALS tech to go green instead of RED to the scene. We boarded the rig and headed up toward the main road so that the ALS tech could see us easily. A few minutes later she arrives and parks behind us. I get out to help her with her gear and out of nowhere a pan handler shows up on scene at 3 am to ask for change. What the heck???  When the guy asks for change I reply that it's 3am...and NO I don't have change, but I do have a patient who is more important that him. He finally got the hint and went about his nomad behavior through a store parking lot. We wrapped things up and headed into town with the patient safe and sound. Case closed! unreal...

      Yesterday I logged 1.7 hours of flight time...cost $214.20. I accidently charged it on the wrong credit card, so I will have to fix that mistake pronto!  Flight activity included 45 degree banking over Lakeville. I also did my favorite activity, which is power off stalls (...not really my favorite), power on stalls (...like simulating a shuttle take off), VOR navigation, and a somewhat shimmy free landing at KROC (Rochester).   Total Time Logged to Date:  9.90 hours   General Report  Well the day wasn't too bad. The weather was good and the wind was out of 310 at 8 knots. I taxied to runway 7 and did my usual run-up. I did a fairly good job with things up until that point. I'm still not very good at talking to ATC on the radio. As I started to down the runway I put in a little too much right rudder (which is a miracle since I am NOT known for my right rudder work) but got finally got straightened out and started to get airborn just shortly after feeling a little shimmy from the nose wheel. I was in N733CE (known as three, charlie, echo) which is turning into my favorite plane for some reason. I will have to take a picture of it for the blog sometime.  Anyway, my take off was good and I seemed to know what I was doing. It was around 5:55 pm and the sky was clear with hazy skies to the south...so naturally we headed south. Shortly at 4,500 feet we made it over the VOR near Avon and began a turn to Conesus Lake. Once we reached the lake we got STALL fever and decided that I needed to practice a few. I am getting a little better at dealing mentally with them, there is just something about intentionally stalling a plane that doesn't sit well with me. Power off stalls are done by setting full flaps, going about 55 knots, keeping the nose of the plane pitched up and reducing the power to idle while pulling back on the yoke. Think of it as pulling back on the rains of a horse while on the edge of a 100 story skyscraper and you will get the idea. Once the stall horn goes off you know you are close...then suddenly the plane goes down nose first. My task is to hold hard right rudder, throw carb heat and full throttle in at the same time, stay on course, and not turn the yoke. It basically simulates a roller coaster in the sky....but a roller coaster is much easier to handle.  Anyway, I hooked it to the right (much better that hooking it to the left...but still not good) and I got my instructors immediate attention. We did this a few times and then went on to power-on stalls (slightly better stuff) and then 45 degree turns. I think I nailed the 45 degree turns...in fact I know I did because I felt my own wing vortex turbulance as I pulled out of it...very cool. It's like making your own wave and surfing it too. In the end we headed back to KROC and called it a day. Very nice!  Since this is a new blog I will pass on the history of my past flight activity for now, but I will try to explain what I can for those interested in learning to fly. BTW...BEFORE you do any flying, be sure to get a medical physical so that you know that you are medically allowed to fly! No sense in spending money only to learn that you are grounded. I recommend joining AOPA (Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association)  urlLink www.aopa.org  - it would be well worth the $40 and will save you hundreds.
