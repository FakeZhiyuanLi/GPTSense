      tears run. feel the ache.   I thought that he was the perfect fit for me. For the first time in my life, all of my friends (except my boss) expect us to get married and have babies.  I think I wanted to do all that. I love him severely. He is compassionate, and stable, and fun. (Actually, he's a bit stodgy). We even got a puppy last month.   The bedroom. He's skilled. He just doesn't seem to have a very strong...drive. We go at it once or twice a week. I normally initiate. That worries me. I wonder if he's just distracted, or if I'm going to spend the rest of my life begging for action. I've never begged for nooky. I will not start, or plan on spending the rest of my life begging.   He makes major life decisions without me. One day he said he was out running errands and he came back with a new car. He almost never asks my opinion about things that matter.   He's generous. He aquires alot of stuff and gives it away to his friends and people who need it.   We've been dating for a year. He hasn't said the traditional gooey stuff like "Loving you forever" or other long term indications. Sometimes he says, "you're perfect", but I wish I knew whether he was waiting to run or whether I should be waiting for a ring.   The way he conducts business is very by the book. He works hard, and has the ability to attrack and motivate people. The people around him respect him.   Now, my boss thinks that my boy is sabotaging our little business by spreading negative information about my boss. Turns out, my boss has something of a rough history. Nothing criminal, just shady. such is life in politics. Granted, alot of stuff out there about my boss is false, but it fits perfectly with his reputation of edgy political tactics.  I don't know whether or not my boy did it. Sometimes I think it's impossible. Sometimes I think it's likely. And it's tearing me up.   Because if he has done this, I don't know what I'll do.

      warm bubbles trickle. fingers scratch and rub my head. goosebumps prickle.  i'll tell you: the world of money-grubbing penny-pinching fenaglers has a new dark lord. and she's a hairstylist.   i went in for a trim today. repeatedly the head stylist asked me in broken english "you wan hy-ly? hy-ly loo very goo... you shoo get hy-ly..." and on and on.   now, i like the place i go. i like the women that help me. they give a fierce shampoo, you know, the kind that brings up goosebumps. oh yeah. the shampoo only runs you "thlee dollah"   and you can get a mani AND a pedi for the bargain rate of $30. I'm not so valley girl that it's a weekly event. but every now and then when i've been a very good girl... you know...  but they fucked up my haircut. and now inner demon "a" is threatening to sing an encore.

      yesterday. sucky day. chemicals were off balance. bad cold.  it must have been conspicuous, because my boyfriend offered to go bring me back whatever i wanted from the grocery store. i asked for only one thing: oranges.  or-an-GEEZ. only oranges.   he brought back oranges. but they were  green  in places. and he brought me the wrong kind of knife to cut with.  he also brought back the wrong flavor of single serving pizzas and some weird novelty flavors of yogurt without asking my preference.     self-serving inner demon "a" reared her ugly head and stayed mad at that man for a full hour.    i tried to decide today whether my anger was rational. on one hand, anyone who's dated me for a year (which he has) should know how irrationally picky i am. but on the other hand, that pickiness is easily manageable: ask me what i want. i may be a borderline OCD selfish bitch, but i'm honest about it.  i didn't even eat the orange.

      I went to a little island that is part of Puerto Rico. Twenty miles long, four miles wide, it is such a  tiny  little portion of the world.  But oh, the wonder. Especially if you are accustomed to pretentious urban or suburban living.  This tiny island, where fleshy, curvy women dress themselves unabashedly in breezy fabrics that are bright as the vegetation surrounding them, this tiny island exudes energy, color, and life, life, life, everywhere.  One of their secret treasures is the bioluminescent bay: a mass of water that contains 70,000 dinoflagellites per gallon. Bioluminescent dinoflagellites, when agitated (by say, dragging one's finger or oar through the water)  glow . On a moonless night they are especially brilliant, and your kayak leaves a trail of stardust in the water. Swimming in the bay is especially magical, as the water rolls down your arms, it looks like tiny grains of glowing rice spilling over your body. Travel Tips on seeing this wonder as well.  Since the bombing ended, a full 90% of the island has been turned over to the National Wildlife Reserve, to remain undeveloped. To remain energetic. To remain alive.  Driving down ricketey roads, too narrow to be two way and yet they are, cars park or stop nonchalantly along the way. If you look around as your car lumbers along, you may notice the women who sit fanning themselves on porches that are painted the bleached, neon colors of a hawaiian postcard.  Dark, happy children play in dirty clothes or plaid school uniforms. Many children run for fun. Militaristically, groups of them, ages varying, can be spotted running at all times. If you drive for more than five minutes, you will see all of the following: a moped roaming groups of wild horses a native riding a horse bare-back a bicycler, a pot-hole of such a size as to make New York pot-holes jealous campaign signs, all of which feature primarily a full color photo of the candidate's face.  Most of their streets don't offer such luxuries as signs or pavement. So when you visit, you'll need a four-wheel drive SUV vehicle. More on travel tips below.  We stayed in a house right on the beach, with sand for a backyard. Wild horses, stray dogs, and natives would show up irregulary to swim in our little section of ocean. Little lizards skitter away from sight, and the sun sets in spectacular arrays of color. Cooking is more fun when you're trying to figure out directions in Spanish, and we consumed much MUCH rum. As in nearly 2 gallons between our little group of 5.  (After all, you don't make a Pina Colada any differently in Vieques than in Maine.)   Travel Tips if you go:   -BYOB  (Bring Your Own Bug-Repellant)  Make sure it has DEET so it will kill mousquitos so there will be fewer of the little bastards the next time I go.   And it's freakin' expensive there.  -Don't paint your car before you go.  Many roads cut through dense vegetation, and will inevitably wear down even the most sturdy of paint jobs.  -4 wheel drive.  If the rental company doesn't offer it, find one that does.  -SUV.  Seriously. You cannot begin to imagine the walk from your little accord that you just got stuck in a pot-hole. It may be a small island, but it's big enough to put a hurtin' on your feet.  -Get a house.  Exchange emails with the owner ahead of time.  -Don't eat at the Wyndham.  If you must indulge in snobby, over-priced meals, try the Inn on the Blue Horizon.  -Visit the Salmon and Sand  colored catholic church on the town square in Isabel II.  Sunday mass is at 7am & 11am. As you leave, ask the priest to pray for you.  -See the Bio Bay at night.  Use Blue Caribe guided tours. Comparably, they are very cheap, and the guides are excellent. You will want to wear water shoes, as the bottom of the bay is grassy and very icky to the feet.  -Navio.  This was our favorite beach. Clean for the adult in you, moderate waves for the child in you. Nearly abandoned, with clear water and white sand.  -Black Beans and Rice  can be purchased at a grocery store. It comes in a small black and gold bag. Prepare it as instructed, and then, mix in sour cream. A real island treat.   -Dramamine.  Rather than being an annoying snooty traveler, you must take the ferry to the little island. This will, however, require a dose of dramamine.  -Williams Pizza.  Enjoy a piece of pepperoni pizza. It is absolutely the best pizza, New York or elsewhere, that I have ever eaten.  Vieques. A tiny colorful piece of Heaven. Enjoy. I hope to again soon.

      It's really, really hard to describe, you know. All in one Thursday, I went from the ringing of cell phones, the irritation of irritated people demanding too many things, the hassle of "don't forget anything", and then I got in a car with Ashley, and drove to your house. Normally the drive to your house is a brief, mocking pause before I reconnect to wires and resume work. Working late into the night - certainly past your bedtime - only to finally close things down. By then, you're either asleep or we're both too exhausted to do anything but mumble tender words as we drift off to sleep. But on Thursday night, the drive was so charged. Almost palpable, Ashley and I could feel the tension, feel the exhilaration of going away. The drive up brought good news about an important race. A good way to start. I felt very nervous sitting next to you. Actually, I am usually nervous near you. I was so glad to be going away with you. I needed to have you all to myself, to have the chance to shamelessly - almost selfishly - hold onto you. Often I worry when I show that side. (Having dated more than one clinger, I know how quickly the person putting up with the clinginess finds that their passion turns to tolerance which in turn becomes annoyance. Incidentally, sometimes you seem to vacillate between subtle tolerance and subtle annoyance) All the same, as hectic and preoccupied as you and I normally are, I was sore and wanting you. Hungry in my heart, and almost as hungry in my body. Hunger in the heart is different than stomach hunger. With stomach hunger you can very quickly eat, and very quicly become full. That fullness can last for much much longer a period of time than it takes to eat. It is exactly opposite in matters of the heart, where it can sometimes take a very long time to become full, and one cool word can make it empty again. You are a very focused traveler. (You do not enjoy the experience, I think, and you are more about end goals than the process. How funny. I haven't had the chance to watch you in such extensive travel. I find it amusing how closely it parallels your professional agenda.) So we very quickly got off to Philadelphia. Perhaps I should rephrase that: you got off very quickly in Philadephia. So began the most relaxing week of my life: waking leisurely. taking turns cooking. beach swims in the morning. island exploration through the day. relaxed evenings of reading, smoking, drinking, star-watching, card-playing, bug swatting, cooking, eating out, being close, sunburns (that turned into more lotioned-back-massages than a group of non-swingers ought to have been privy to), suntans, drives through dense vegetation, seeing horses walking down the street. All of it set off - deeply accentuated - by being so close to you. Leaving there - actually walking out of the house - was very hard for me. See, I knew that the only thing waiting for me - for us - on the other side of 15 hours of travel was our old habits of hurry, annoyance, hiding, work, more work, and separation. Old routines like one and two sentence emails that we squeeze out between gargantuan workloads, short phone calls that say good night and little more, pretending around Tom that I didn't really spend the night and we didn't really do anything, but most of all, being lonely for your affection. It seems you, too, are an easy habit to get into. And I get the feeling that I may be an easy habit to get into, but I am an equally easy habit to break. And now that we're back and you've spent the whole night and day there and I've spent the whole night and day here, I opened my computer to talk to you. Because I miss you. Because I love you. Mostly because I just wanted to talk to you. The vacation in Vieques was absolutely the nicest thing that anyone has ever given me. (Except for a pair of gloves my dad gave me when I was very little, but that is a different story) You worked so hard to plan and plan everything. It was a perfect break for me. It was perfectly orchestrated. The location, the weather, the house, the company, the time with you. Everything. Except I'm afraid the trip may have spoiled me. Having been so content, so happy having unlimited access to you, it is going to be difficult, being back. So, this is my thank you note to you. Yes, thanking you for the vacation. Yes, thanking you for a great time. But mostly, love this is me thanking you for the pure, unfiltered happiness I feel when I bask in your presence, under your affection, glowing from your little tiny expressions of love. This is me thanking you for a perfect week of joy. I love you,
