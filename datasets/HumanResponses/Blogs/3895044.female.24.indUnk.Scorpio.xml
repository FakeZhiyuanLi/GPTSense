      i dunno y, but babies or toddlers enjoy my company.  Was asked to hold an ex-colleague's baby boy, but he's too active, im too scared to mishandle him, n having him fall out of my arms. but he is kinda cute, though lesmiz claims he is FAT...LOL....   I still remember the days when i had to carry babies ranging from 3mth old fragile newborn to giant size caucasian 1yr old Ben.(yes, its ben). Haven had the slightest problem making them stop crying.  Ok, back to my situps.... 31.......32........33......

      Partying over the weekend brought some surprises, n yet more laughter into my singlehood.  friday: went bala, n my dear mariah shared some interesting insight about blowjobs. so graphic to the extend the guys next table listen as attentively.  longbar was kinda fun. complimentary s'pore sling n lighthearted dancing.....throwing of peanuts! velvet as usual, v packed, so was zouk. highlight of the nite, was realising my new colleague has some connections to my 1st exbf....  sat: ken's bdae & tim's welcoming part 2 dinner. everyone was late as usual. but was ok...its good seeing my close frenz all getting together after few long yrs, everyone thrashing one another. i enjoyed the DUN START the ball rolling abt everyone's dirty/nasty deeds part. Hilarious... there's this long list of most embarrasing moments, shared specifically during massive drinking sessions.  Ken got pretty high n drunk eventually. alas, his new speakers still in my car ;p Oh manz, i oso found out my eye candy knows that KIWI guy. SHIT.

      1st dae was pretty much a mean feat. Y? coz i had only 2hrs of sleep, before charging the dae for more than 12hrs, exhausting all my energy. even when i was younger, i seriously dun recall abusing my body n leveraging it to this extend. no kidding. from the look that everyone seems to be already in their lil clicks, it was a pretty awkward n lonely day. However, im a loner, can pretty much survive in that environment.  as the week progress, from all the lil clusters, characters r more defined. managed to make a couple of closer working colleagues, at the same time, some strangely (or expectedly) jus grow even more distant ....  It is then i realised, as a person age, they tend not to b as open-minded as they use to be, fixated mindset. to me, dat's courting doom.   Oh yeah, not forgetting horning an obnoxious MAN in a public carpark for not letting me get out of my lot, n sickeningly taking his bloody own sweet time, parking his pseudo lexus. who saes women r terrible drivers? i fink men r worst, wif no proper manners n ultra useless big egos.   its been a strange week. a week of  lingering.........   i miss ya too....

      Was watching the news today. Mandarin News.  They featured a footage taken by those SPCA alikes, anti-globalisation, anti-animal cruelty bodies blah blah, hidden in a lil corner of a chicken farm. Expose they call it.... in it, u see white feathered fowls being thrown against the wall, those that could still struggle wud further experience the stomping feets of insane men.  so drama.... do u ever wonder, is this real?   even the footage of those iraqi killings seems bizaare....  RITE, no more TV for now....  p.s: yay! i can finally post a blog after so long! ;p

      A lil note to thank my fren Oma, for the flowers for some reasons, i din get to hold.  Even if its flowers conveniently plucked from the redbomb event, hey i appreciate it. The red daisies were really nice, n i mean it.   Despite having to deprive him further 3hrs of good cuddly long awaited connection wif his comforter, he still accompanied me & sat thru the movie. Mean gals...hahaha how apt.  Thank You. =)  On & On [haclyon,orbital] still ringing in my mind. that familiar feeling....

      Aloof? that was the impression my guy fren had when he 1st met me, 2 weeks ago, n now he saes, i seem different. SO, wad am i now? hmmmmm.......  ME,[n];[woman];[v, no this does not stand for virgin] = Quite animated, not drama(though at times i wud qualify for most of the auditions), chirpy, energetic, loves to haf endless fun, ambitious, occasionally gungho & i haf those mental abilities of men(when it comes to emotional needs, occasional aunt agony to many close guy pals)Living life to the fullest, its too short to waste. yes a tad mean, always short fusing on minor issues, but darn kewl when it comes to mega problems. Weird huh? Optimism.  I see myself evolving from the contended gal who nearly got married @20, to one who jus believe in endless wonderful experience being single. Kids? Having a kid alone is tuff, who is going to take care of the lil one when im out earning the dough? PLUS, i dunno whose male swimmer i wud really want, n adoption...(i will start a new post soon abt that issue).   Marriage used to b such a sacred thing. A legal promise to share n love each other dearly till the end of time, wif all faith n trust.   However, im so glad i pull the plug many yrs ago. Seeing so many unhappy marriages, divorce cases amg frenz, the cheating on spouse bit jus doesnt go very well with my ideal picture of wad it really shud be. they haf disillusionized my love paradise. Many pple get together, thinking of marriage at the end, moving towards that direction, is SO WRONG.  Being together, should be just happy sharing experiences, not for the sake of getting married eventually. Haven u seen enuff couples going lovey dovey, & then after 2 yrs or so, viola, getting married, jus becoz they think its the right thing to do. But wad's really rite? Wad's the future in relationship pple talk abt?  Have they thought about that? Wad's the real purpose or reproduction? The common excuse of, u like kids, carrying on the family name? Since when did they become adult playthings, novelty, or even proud family produce against another? Or is it becoz it's society, that shapes us, to be compelled to reproduce?  OK, i admit, i haf this immense curiosity towards pple's true intention, motives & thoughts/perception. Rite, the local term, KAYPOH.  Maybe, im jus being the new age group of irresponsible adult that my society now coins, who refuse to help out in the ageing population. Maybe, im jus jaded by the degrading moral values of humans these days.  Till the day i find the TRUE love. Love is a many splendid thing(oh i so enjoy mcgregor expressing it in moulin rouge)... i still believe in it....   Being human....hah...wad haf we become?

I'm home, but surprisingly, no one is.  suddenly, the fear of someone dear to me could be in trouble. the thought of losing daddy began to dawn on me like a nitemare.  then, i sms my brother. a reply came, thank god, it was someonelse in the family. Of coz, i wud b informed on the instance if its really my dad.  Daddy i love u, n hope u r safe, anywhere, every minute im alive.

      Partyin on fridays never seem complete without a drink or 2 @ velvet underground. i use to party hop alot, all over, always hanging out at zouk, grooving to the beats on the platform, feeling v superior, well the least bit, less crowded up there...LOL, not forgeting the occassional turf fighting with elbows n butts..charming...  Rite, as i age, i begin to progress to the more matured, dressy crowd 3 yrs ago. Fridays r always packed with executives, law & media crowd pouring in from winebar, & tons of the filthy rich bastards & cheapos like me wif the crew pass. The real reason, I prefer to groove to house musik.  Last nite was a blast, despite the having a turnout of only 3 pple, my lesbian kaki, a very sporting guy fren aka guiness boy of the nite, and ms swanky. Not forgetting the shortie who kept starring at our tiny group, my gf & my cleavage. Many will wonder, since u wore such a top, its meant to be viewed. Yes, BUT he was literally stalking us, until i threw him the 'F**K outta my sight' glare, but he came back shortly after to haunt us. grrrrr....... N there was this guy named KIWI. ok, he's either an ahbeng, if not he's jus trying too hard to act cute. i dun see how many gals he can hook wif the brown hairy, green fruit. or worse, was it some household cleaning agents' brandname? BTW, he wore this perpetual smile, that made me drag my gf somewhere, n alas! he appeared again! such a slut!  OK, the HIGHLIGHT of the nite, was us gals dishing some ice-cubes(or enuff ice to wet his pants) into our guiness boy's pants. We gals luffed so hard, hey my stomach was cramped up....*LOL* n it wasnt once, but TWICE! But being such a nice guy, he jus smiled (or maybe oredi intoxicated), trying to get the ice out. Hey, U get to see us gals French kiss ok... i dun fink its dat bad to haf ur pants wet once in a blue moon.  =p N i do enjoy kissing my gf, fare much better than most of the guys.   Finale, i stepped on my eye candy's shoe without apologising on my way out... so rude...   5 parts energy *beams*  n i still f**king HATE I*****S!!!!

      some food for thought after the so many yrs of dating.  1. If u love someone, or haf the fuzzy feeling/strange unexplainable feeling, make ur feelings known. there will b consequences, but life is too short for us to wait blindly. sometimes, when the moment is gone, its gone. of coz u can't hurry love, expressing urself doesn't grant u the rite to stalk the person from there onwards.  2. If u love someone, but there seem no outcome or possibility, move on.(i had one experience that took me 2yrs to realise this pt) The minimum, u still haf a fren. [ok i shall not start ranting abt this fat bitch who made me even lose a guyfren]  3. If that someone u love, who does not love u anymore, u shud wake up & learn to let go. Love dun wait, there r many fishes out there who deserve ur precious time.[this is oso one pt that same fat bitch shud understand, while her bioclock is ticking non-stop. She shud oso realised that she made everyone ard her miserable, including driving her bf to the wall. her own deeds]  Being happy is wad u make of out of life, experiencing interaction with pple, doing things that makes u happy, as in really heart-felt happiness rather than face-front look good shit.  Other than being a hypochondriac, I haf philophobia too....*LOL* & i normally do not haf reasons liking someone. its an unexplainable feeling.  OK, everyone knows how to rant, but in reality, im jus addicted to 'Mr Big' for now....kekekeke  (rite, i can sense lesmiz gng -_-)

      i bought 4 bras n one silicone nippies. wad's the latter? its some adhesive thingy to aid covering up the offensive, perky nips when women go braless. such an invention.  the more interesting part of the shopping was the assistant who cant answer my qs, pertaining to the difference in the range of bras they carry. me: wad's the difference btw this 2 range of products u haf? assistant: they r made of different materials. me: ok, wad so different, wad kinda material for the softer range? assistant: u can check the label n the product tab, it tells u wad it is made up of me: but u supposed to know, if i had done that, wud i bother asking u? assistant: [silent]  She so 'DUH',(found out she is part-timing there) n this reminds me of the experience i had on sundae when i was shopping wif my buddy for a jacket.  buddy: do u sell any thicker jackets here? assistant: no, but we do haf some on display. buddy: but i need some winter jacket.... assistant: but its summer now. me: we ask for WINTER jacket, we din ask for extra opinions to make u look 'smart', if u dun, its ok.  YES, those were exact words, or words similar to deliver the same ferocity.  a tad mean.... kekekeke sorry, ive learnt that if u dunno, its better to admit u dunch, n being a good salesperson, NEVER EVER make ur customers look stupid. its a lose lose situation u cant amend.

      im finally spotting a new haircut & some nice nails. No, its still long, but with a lil bit of layer. the fringe is the result of my bleak effort against the stylist's idea of shorter fringe. nothing wrong wif the fringe, but when u have seen the stylist china doll fringe, u wud wanna sae no too. Yes, mine is called the partial fringe, n my name is not china doll. it's frigging SGD90....where at? the usual suspect, toni&guys [u can see the parang knife hanging above their doorstep]  Ok the nails wasn't done as well as i thought they could, n as usual, im being conned into adding SGD10 for some aromatherapy thingy, which i din smell much, rather the paint fumes more...  Chanced upon an amazing invention that i always missed. Plastic shower flower [ok, its some mashy looking stuff]. Hey it works better than my shower mesh, or natural loofah[OUCH!], n got rid off all dirt n grime. =) To top it up, salt scrub finale.  not forgetting my usual 'mask' routine, scrub, clay mask, moisture mask, whitening mask.   Yes, my usual DIY, self-indulging pampering routines.

      i realised that no matter how hard i try, i jus dun seem to be able to work out those html codes at all.  Been trying to add pictures, links & so on. argh. no improvement except for that lil hit counter[hit me baby one more time.]N then i saw this kewl template, showing 2 gals kissing. but still i dunno how to get it on my blog.  Drift: an ex-bank customer has been calling me for the last few days, regarding her investments n so on. she is keen to invest, but im not so keen to talk to her for now. In fact i dun feel like starting work at all. sheesh  Rite, i shall embark on the 'new look' trip down town. A gf of mine commented that i dun look cute anymore & we both agreed its the hair and i oso need a decent pedicure!

      Rite, its 0140hrs.  I'm beginning to toy wif the idea of being my own boss.  It seems very alluring despite the daunting task of setting up the whole damn business.  To begin with, personally, I hate accounting. But that's wad tick.  Reading through a so-called entrepreneur guide off the govt website seems to give me a lil idea, but none of them seems to have the help i really wanted.  n then, the task of coming out with a company name not too corny. No, no padikoh as wad my beloved fren had suggested.  cr8blitz.vertigo.cactus.transbiz. Gawd help....  I have to come to terms now that my creative juices n my overwhelming optimisim is being clouded by the desire to hit the sack.   Zzzz

      Its a lazy boring monday. Public national holidae.  As im recouperating from my KL alcohol-infused party weekend, i decided to jus chill out at home, watching dvds. About schmidt is a movie abt a retiree, looking back at wad he had missed out, how he could haf communicated wif his love ones more, and about how life is such a waste & realising it only after 67yrs.  Everyone of us wants to make a difference, though we all know we all play such a small role in the big picture. Yes, strength of more than one will make the difference, but i still beliff in making that difference alone, even if im alone wif no followers. I guess, life is jus so short, u wudnt wanna short change urself for not making that move u wanted to.  end of the dae, when we die, we live in pple's memories. N when these pple die, u finally ceased to exist. forever.   wad does it matter... nothing, but living it, knowing that u, urself, made a difference before. n take the time to let the pple ard u know how much they mean n how much u love them.  dat's wad my life is.

      hey hey, petronas twin tower is so amazingly massive & breathtaking at nite!  jus got back from KL. Not that i hate the place, but it jus strengthens my beliff that im living in such fine country back home.  OK ok, other than the no sex & the city, six feet under shit back home....everythingelse is pretty alrite. u know, its kinda like taking for granted here, n whine whole dae.....wait till u get to places where there is no proper standards, unsafe roads, bumpy infrastructure, weird ninjas....(oh i f**king hate them). KL, being the most liberated muslim state in the world [i fink], is actually quite a fun weekend destination. As the damn shopping spree is now on wif huge bargains, i only bought a pair of cheap heels. Somehow, i haven really gotten into the spend now, pay later stance. The party scene's pretty huge, more responsive crowd. Not forgetting the hot gyrating chick at the bar counter who sent all my guy frenz drooling.  Drinks r pretty affordable, n the food ROCKS!  end of the dae, i still love my own country, for the safety factor & efficient systems. though i fink the service pple shud really wake up n stop finking that their job has no dignity.....  on that note, time to recoup, beauty sleep n a long week ahead! =)

      YAY! i pass my validation wif flying colors!!! haf never seen my test scores more than 90/100 since sec skool daes.  Its not really the test results, but the amt of trauma i had to go thru to attain this...manz....haha  n to congratulate my fantastic achievements, a drink of 2 at bala jus sums it all.  yes, being the 'devil', i still stick by the gut feel my gf shud jus leave the bf for everyone's sake.  I'm not a saint, but u hafta agree wif me, life is too short to waste on someone who will not be able to give u wad u want.   Well, if u wanna love that special someone n u fink its worth it, u go gal! but the risk is all u hafta take.  My gf commented that she forsees me a someone who will adopt a child at 40, coz i will b too bored being single, n wud need a companion. LOL! however, that option seems vividly close.....  alrite, some red wine can really make me blabber non-stop

Oh that note, i will pray to god(in wadever shape n size, or forms he mayb), to bless all my loves ones n friends ard me, not to suffer from the 1st 3 Ds. I cant bear to see them in bad shape. Its a terrible thought to begin wif.....  Wad abt deficit? well, i cant change pple's habit, if they dun manage $$ well.... that's where i come into play, invest wif me!!! =p Kidding.... im a BIG spendthrift too.
