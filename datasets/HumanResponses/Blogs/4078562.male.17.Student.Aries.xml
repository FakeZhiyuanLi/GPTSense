      Harold and Kumar: Go To White Castle was surprisingly funny, and it didnt just get you with cheap laughs.  Its not just about like sex and weed (while there is plenty of that) but goes into racial stereotypes, which, even if offensive some of the time, can always produce a laugh.  The white people in the movie are portrayed by A:a group of skater kids who drink mountain dew and eat  Extreme Doritoes  and B: Cops, and all this other stuff which i dont really wanna explain.  I found the white people the funniest part of the movie.  Recommendation to all under 30.  Hope to see The Village soon.  Didnt wake up till 1:30 today...pretty nifty.

      What is this??&nbsp; Are crictics really liking  urlLink Harold and Kumar  more than an  urlLink M. Night Shyamalan movie ?&nbsp; I plan to see both since they both look pretty good, but i never thought id see this....critics hated  urlLink Half-Baked  (which was pretty funny), disliked  urlLink Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back .&nbsp; They did love  urlLink Dazed and Confused , but i dont know how much you can consider that stoner  humor .

      sweet, its midnight on the nose....pretty cool stuff ya know?&nbsp; I was just imagining what if like Michigan, Wisconsin and all those mid north to north west states broke off from the union?&nbsp; But theres no motivation for them to have there own country really so i guess it wouldnt work.&nbsp; Or what if America joined the European Union, although that would never happen under Bush...maybe kerry.&nbsp; Has anyone ever realized how close alazka is to seattle?&nbsp; its really not that far but you think alaska and you think wow, thats far away, but really its like (looks at map) closer than salt lake city.&nbsp; And what up with athens?&nbsp; theyve sold like under  urlLink half of their total tickets .&nbsp; And they dont have security...its gonna be like rainbow 6, terrorists will try to kill everyone but a politically correct team of 6+ multi-ethnic people will save the day! w00t!

      I cant believe the catholic church.&nbsp; I mean cmon this is just ridiculous.&nbsp; They are alienating half of there members and taking opinionated views from one side.&nbsp; Being a catholic myself and going to an uber-conservative church, its sickening.&nbsp; I.e., last week at church there was a pamphlet handed out before mass.&nbsp; The pamphlet was titled,    A Catholics Guide to Moral Voting   .&nbsp; Inside, lo and behold, it read something like:&nbsp;   "Catholics are faced with a tough decision about who to vote for today....bla bla bla.... and for you, the moral, righteous standing catholic, we have created a guide on 5 things that are non-negotiable policies.&nbsp; These were Abortion, Cloning, Stem cell research, gay marriage"   and something else *EDIT:I think it was Euthanasia*,  cant remember.&nbsp; At the end of this law-laying section, it said   "Anyone who votes for a presidential candidate or other political figure who stands for these immoral actions is creating a sin on the same level as the man or woman who commits these sins themselves" &nbsp;   I mean, wtf?!.&nbsp;     The pope himself on the war in Iraq  "When war, like the one now in Iraq, threatens the fate of humanity, it is even more urgent for us to proclaim, with a firm and decisive voice, that only peace is the way of building a more just and caring society,"        The pope on the death penalty    "in cases of absolute necessity, in other words, when it would not be possible otherwise to defend society. Today, however, as a result of steady immprovement in the organization of the penal system, such cases are very rare, if not practically nonexistent."      I mean, I might be ok with the churchs standing if they didnt try to manipulate the people to vote for Bush.&nbsp; Its just disgusting and embarassing.     &nbsp;   PS.    And the man who baptised me (Bishop Michael J. Sheridan) is now the same man who wants to deny me and any other Kerry supporters communion.&nbsp; Cool connection huh
