      Ok, it's like 12:30 am, I have to work at 8 in the morning, and I leave to go to school at 1:30 tomorrow afternoon...yet somehow I find myself surfing the net, despite being tired as hell and being nowhere close to having everything packed.  Can you say ADD?  Since that's the deal I find myself facing right now, I'll keep this short, but the only cool thing to happen to me today was that I got to make a delivery to the same building that  urlLink TSN  is in.  That in itself is nothing special, but the receptionist working at the place I was dropping the order off at was super hot, and we had a fun 10 minutes chatting and stuff.  If I had half a brain I probably should've asked for her number, even though I'm heading off to school.  Hopefully I can ask the rep. at work to find out what her status is, cause she needs to be in my future already!  Hopefully I get to post again sooner rather than later, cause it looks like I'm going to be on my own for a few days down in dumpsville.  Audi 5000.

      As the school year rapidly approaches again, I look forward to going back to  urlLink Windsor  with great anticipation.  I am really hoping that this will be my last year, although an extra semester is probably more than likely.  One cool thing this year is that my brother, is going to get to experience the joy of not living with parents for the first time in his life, as he heads off in the opposite direction to the  urlLink University of Ottawa .  While getting to experience all kinds of new things for the first time is fun, college is definately a costly experience at the same time!  With that said, I've busily been helping him find a new computer in the last day or so, and I have forgotten how much work it is to look through every stores flyers in search of the best deal.  There was no way that I would let him end up getting a system from somewhere like Future Shop, or some other ripoff artist, even though going that route definately makes things easier if you're only looking for convenience.  I'm all about optimizing performance and price though, so I started hunting around  urlLink Mississauga  a little more.  It's kind of fun getting to do this for me since it'll probably be a while until I get my next system.  The only real place that Brad checked out was  urlLink MDG , who are quickly becoming a powerful player in Ontario.  Four years ago when I left for school, that's where I got mine from, back when they were about 15 stores smaller and not even close to being able to afford a full page ad in  urlLink The Star .  While I have to applaud them on their success and tremendous growth, they certainly aren't the company I remember them to be.  For starters, everyone in there appears to speak in a heavy, Eastern-European set accent, which can get on your nerves when you're constantly talking about computers parts.  Most parts' names involve various short combinations of letters and numbers, and someone who doesn't have a complete control of the English language can easily jumble products that all sound similar.  This can often lead to you unexpectedly paying for something more expensive or result in you getting an inferior product at a previously agreed upon set price.  Another thing that bothered me know is that there's no flexibility at all in negotiating price with these guys.  When you're making a $1500 purchase involving a highly specialized and customizable product, the sales people should have some leeway in being able to determine a fair deal for both sides.  I won't say that I know much about computers (maybe a bit more than the average guy), but there is no way a basic user should be charged an extra $50 for a network card, when tons of places often sell them for less than $10.  I wouldn't say the sales guy was totally innocent, but you could tell that they computer system he was working through had about the same price controls as their website, even though I found a NIC card on their site for $21, which is far better than any deal they offered me.  The last thing I'll mention is that I'm not sure how it's possible that with the growth of their company somehow terms of warranties on new computers has decreased.  Whereas, I got 1 year parts/3 years labor, they now only give you 1/1 which is very disappointing to me.  How is it that smaller computer stores are able to offer longer and more comprehensive warranties than say Dell, HP, IBM, or even MDG?  You would think those with a more extensive reputation and company history would be able to out-do small market local companies that often times have trouble even staying in business.  Hopefully Brad and I will get this sorted out tomorrow, cause I have a million other things to prepare before I leave on Friday.

      From what it sounded like,  urlLink United  played well again, against much better competition in the form of Newcastle at St. James Park.  Unfortunately,  urlLink Sportsnet  in their infinite wisdom decided that Tottenham-Leeds would be a much more entertaining game and decided to show that instead.  The game started early here (7 am) so I could've listened to it on the Internet, but figured I was too tired to turn the computer on and get it.  With the 2-1 win, United remain in first through week two, tied on points with Arsenal and Chelsea, but ahead on goal differential.  It was good for United to face a strong team like Newcastle early in the season to show they were up to the challenge, but you could also argue that given their preseason tour where they played Celtic, America, Juventus, and Barcelona they had already faced four good teams, handling them all convincingly.  I did end up watching part of the Chelsea-Leicester matchup, and as much as I hated to see Veron go, hopefully he's much better received at Stamford Bridge.  He got a bad deal from the British press for not showing up in domestic games, but they blow everything out of proportion.  While I have no doubt that they'll be fine again in the Premiership, I'm doubtful whether their form will allow them the same dominance in the Champions League without Beckham, but especially without Veron.  He single handedly controlled the flow of many of their games last season, and cut open defenses constantly with through balls to van Nistlerooy, Giggs, and Scholes.  As important a player Beckham was, Veron was more important to United's success at dictating the pace of the game.  I like Beckham, but he's definately not worthy of the amount of press he has gotten over the move to  urlLink Real  in comparison to the relative silence Veron got going from United to Chelsea.  Since I'm supposed to get up in 6 hours for  urlLink work , I'll leave it at that, but have no doubt that this isn't the last you'll hear from me on this subject.

      Ok, this is my first post, and I'm already having trouble of thinking of things to say- what opportune timing.  I just need a place to vent about shit going on in my life and the lives of others around me.  The great thing about this blog is that it allows me to discuss all the things important to me and hopefully will cater to everybody with the same interests-  although I'm sure it won't be long until I realize I'm the only person in this category.  Anyway, that's it for today.  I need to do other things before I can dedicate more time to yet what will no doubt turn out to be another large compulsion in my life.  Hopefully I'll have  urlLink this   urlLink one  shaken soon enough.  David

      Baseball season just ended, football just started, hockey is a few weeks away with basketball not far behind.  I am obsessed with sports to the detriment of many other things in my life.  I am really hoping to be able to change this pattern because it isn't feasable especially with school and eventually a career.  I feel like I'm really starting to wear out, despite the fact I'm only a month deep into school.  Every second I am not doing school work bothers me greatly, mainly because I've fallen behind on everything, and I'm starting the trend of giving excuses for not having things in on time.  With that said, I am freaking out that I'm going to fall back into a rut.  Balancing school with a social life is proving to be increasingly difficult this year, to the point where grades will start to slip once I'm being evaluated.  Even though I wish I could blog far more often than I've been doing, I just can't let myself get distracted with things like this despite their theraputic nature.  If I have another spaz out though, I'm sure I'll be back on here sooner rather than later.

      I swear to God, it's so difficult to get anything done in my house, it's like distraction city around here.  Obviously living with three other guys does not lean itself to a clean house, but you would think that people have some pride in where they live.  Having lived here for the better part of four weeks now, I'm having serious doubts.  I have known my roommates for the course of my four years in school, but I think I've learned more about them since I moved in than over that entire period.  Quite frankly, I think I've learned much more than I care to.  Luckily, I've gotten much more involved in campus life this year, so it hasn't been as much of a problem.  With that said, I'm going insane with the amount of work I have to do this year.  The funny thing is, I immersed myself in it with the knowledge that all these things I'm doing will be highly beneficial to my future.  To start, my classes the semester:  40-110 Pre-Production Planning and Design 40-200 Foundations in Communication History 40-216 Video Prouduction I 40-381 Advertising in a Social Context 40-434 Evaluation Research in Communication Studies  On top of that, I'm working on the department's newsletter, writing for the student newspaper (I got to interview  urlLink Martin Sheen  on Saturday, in town to accept an award), was just elected Communication Studies student rep, in the process of getting a part-time job in research, playing  urlLink soccer (Rude Boyz 2) , etc., etc., etc.  I had a lot of steam to put into this one, but after leaving it for a while to go have a couple beers at the bar, I think I'll save the drama for another day.

      I haven't updated in like 2 weeks, still getting settled in at school, and have a really busy schedule this year.  Once I get internet in my house then I'll be in business but until then this is what I'm stuck doing.

      Things I realize at this exact moment:  1) I have no money  2) I have a lot of work to do, in very little time  3) You're as powerful as you're able to convince people you are   I got promoted working at the school paper last week, now getting paid the big bucks.  Well, not really, I basically do the same job, but I'm not volunteering anymore.  I'm supposed to interview the new mayor this week, hopefully that goes well.   urlLink Man. United ,  urlLink Chelsea , &  urlLink Arsenal  are starting to pull away from the pack in the EPL, and United look pretty certain to advance to the next round of the Champions League.  Kleberson, Paul Scholes, and Ole Gunner Solskjaer should all be healthy again soon, and Wes Brown in a few months.  Tim Howard has done a great job so far this year.  I wouldn't say he's been particularly challenged yet, despite the fact that United are among the best defensive teams so far this year.  Roy, Nicky,  urlLink Quinton Fortune , Phil & Gary Neville are all playing the best football in the 3 years or so I've been following closely.  Roy has 3 goals already this year too!   urlLink Video Production  lab in 8 hours so I'm going to bed now, until I write again...   P.s. Always a great feeling when you find out your  urlLink mom is reading your blog . urlLink

      Hey, while I haven't posted in a while I think it's really interesting that more people seem to be visiting this site the less active it gets.  I wonder what my latest post will do for that.  So it has been some time since I've had time to get on here, I got a part time job doing research, and am now on my department's council, curriculum committee, and appointments committee.  I have a thirst for power and control, furthering my belief that I'll only able to ultimately work for one boss: me.  Sports imaging and marking image rights is the area I want to specialize in, but Windsor has nothing for that so I think I'm going to go elsewhere to get a Masters, if it comes to that.   urlLink Manchester United  is playing great these days, with the exception to a 3-1  urlLink Fulham  loss last week, hopefully they take care of  urlLink Rangers  today.  My team won 4-0 in intermurals on Sunday, I actually got to play forward in the second half too!  The playoffs start this week, so at most we have two games left.  I have played fairly average the past few games so it's time to pick it up and make some better saves in goal.  The roommates are okay, Drew is done his degree next month so hopefully he takes all his mess in the basement with him.  He's a good guy, just talks way too much shit.  That's the problem with communication majors, always love hearing themselves talk.  Coney is retarded as usual,  urlLink smoking a pack a day , on top of a half quarter at least twice a week.  That kid loves smoking- guess that's what happens when you drop all but two of your classes.  That's it for now, working at 5 so I gotta get some stuff done now.  Ciao!  P.S. for whatever reason if you want a link on this site to your blog or site, just send me an email, dma17@yahoo.com.  Take'er easy.

      It's been 4 months since I last posted something, happy 2004 by the way.  I came to the conclusion that I don't really want my family reading my blog, as some people have already gotten around to googling me.  I'm on spring break (in February no less), my brother's in Daytona, i should be at  urlLink Mardi Gras , but am stuck at home doing nothing.  Will update more regularly, starting tomorrow.

      I have nothing really to contribute here other than I noticed that they have the blogger toolbar on the computer I"m using at the library.  Guess it just goes to show how far technology has permeated our society, especially given the fact that this school is so far behind every technological curve known to man

      So it's been a few more days than 'tomorrow', but it's definately better than the gaps of months this blog had become. With that said...  Coming into this year, one of the most certain features of this team was its defenders.  Despite playing very well for the majority of the season, there were certainly times that tried the patience of both the fans and Sir Alex.  Here's a look at how it ranked them.   Gary Neville   Gary came through the season playing consistently both domestically, in Europe, and internationally.  Provided great coverage at right back to an often destabilized line.  Even scored 2 goals near the end of the season in course of a week having scored only 4 in 430+ appearences for United.   Rating: B+    Phil Neville   Phil featured 31 times both in defense and in central midfield in the holding role in place of Keane and/or Butt.  His work in midfield actually was far more noticeable than his contributions on the backline given the competition for places there.   Rating: B-    Rio Ferdinand   Rio, Rio, Rio...this name was seldomly mentioned in a positive relation to the team this year.  Having failed to complete a drug test, Rio managed to get himself suspended for 8 months (people who have failed tests such as Jaap Stam received only a 6 month suspension- how that works I'll never know.)  Now he'll miss Euro 2004, and the start of the season, which sucks.  Rio did manage to play until the middle of January, so he did get 20 games in.  In that time they won 15, tied 2, and lost 3.  Had they managed to replicate that performance in the second half of the season they would've retained their position of a year ago.  Anyhow, Rio provided the centre of defense with consistent play, and was a very big help in clearing balls away from new keeper Tim Howard.  You could certainly see how United faltered once he was missing.   Rating:  A for the time he played, C- for the entire season and how he let the team down by not being there in the end.    Wes Brown   The timing couldn't have been any better for Wes' return to the squad, but the results certainly could have.  As Rio was on his way out due to the aformentioned suspension.  Wes played his only game with Rio January 17, the day they inexplicably lost 1-0 to Wolves away.  It is never easy returning from such a long layoff as Wes did, especially given the fact he has been seriously injured in each of the last three seasons now.  On the whole Wes showed flashes of his ability, but mixed with the injury and several lapses of judgement in communicating with Howard/Carroll and his other defenders, his performance must improve next season, both in order to keep his place in the team as well as regain a spot in the England squad.   Rating: C-    John O'Shea   O'Shea got to play the majority of the season, including 33 Premiership games, to mixed results.  He played predominantly at left back, and was noticeably strong up that side with Ryan Giggs going forward.  John even put two goals in, which are always a bonus.  However, I found that a lot of mix-ups at the back involved him either not marking forwards, or letting players get by him on one-twos or crosses.  Not all were his fault, but he was always around the fire.  Didn't do anything noticeable in Europe this year either.  I like John, he has very good skills, and is only 23 still, however if wants to keep his place next year he's going to have to play much better, especially since Mikael Silvestre is expected to return to left back.   Rating: C    Mikael Silvestre   Mikael played alright, which is disappointing considering he was expected to fill a fairly big void when they lost Rio for the year.  He got switched back to the left side, and his inconsistent performances have left a question mark on his head for the '04-'05 season.  The erratic Euro 2004 performance not to mention Gabriel Heinze's arrival means he'll have to work hard to keep his spot, even after going back to his strongest position   Rating: C+

      With  urlLink Manchester United   urlLink beating   urlLink Millwall  3-1 last Saturday, the season has come to an end.  I wouldn't call this season successful by any means, but you can definately say it has not been a disaster like many have claimed.  To give the season some context, 5 new players were bought for the first team, and 2 of those can now be considered regulars for a place in the squad.  With the departure of one key player and two who had worn out their welcome, the chemistry of the squad came under threat for the first time in quite a while.  With the core still comprising of many from the Youth team of 92, it was easy to see how it would be difficult to adapt to new players entering the squad with such prominence.  For starters, the 5 players who were brought in came from 4 different continents, with a variety of playing styles and backgrounds from which they emerged.  With that said, here's my report card for the season for each member of the first team:    Goalies    Roy Carroll   Roy had a good albeit quiet year.  He filled in admirably for Tim Howard while he was struggling, and played a key role in securing United's place in the FA Cup final by holding Arsenal in the semis.  B+    Tim Howard   Given that a year ago 99% of United fans had not even heard of Tim, this season has marked a wonderful debut for the American.  Although he did stumble at the beginning of the year, Tim did an admirable job of providing quality keeping and assertive leadership from the back.  It was quite convincing of him to displace the now departed Fabien Barthez so easily to take the starting role and not relinquish it until late in the campaign.  Although it was his blunder that cost United their place in the Champions League (although I think that may even be debatable, the defenders in the area reacted slowly to the rebound and incoming forward), he deserves credit for working hard to regain his place and trust of the manager.   A-   Tomorrow I'll cover defenders...
