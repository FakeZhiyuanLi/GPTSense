      Yo!  Today my brother, Shelby, came back from my Uncle Andy's new house in Griffin. He had helped him move in. He brought a Playstation and some games back with him, so we had to run to town to get some adapter cables....it's kept us busy for a few hours now, because we hadn't played on a playstation in forever. I'm sitting here eating spaghettios.....I'm SO bored...Well, I shall be off then... -Afton

      Wednesday night...Tomorrow's trash day at my house!!! Yippee!!!!! Anyways, I've been pretty busy this week with practicing basketball. It's been pretty fun, though. Last night I went to the school and we scrimaged against Lanier County and lost like 30 to 13... It was pretty bad. It was still alot of fun though. Tomorrow night we're going to do the same thing, except that we're going to Lanier County's gym.... I hope that we break 20 points this time..... We'll just have to see. Besides that, I have a pretty busy schedule tomorrow. I plan on going jogging tomorrow morning, cleaning up my room again, washing up the clothes while my mom is at work, and going to get my FFA officer teams' shirts made (they're going to be so pretty: golden yellow with blue writing - can't wait!!). I think that I'm really picking up my pace in order to meet my goals. I am much happier than I was the other day...and I think it shows....except for when I go to Manor and practice basketball and work out. Everyone else has a partner to do stuff with when we work out - excluding me. Fortunately, whenever I bench press, there is always someone to spot me. That makes me feel slightly better. Still, I feel slightly unpopular. Maybe it's because I'm not really outgoing in the mornings. Sometimes I'm shy. Otherwise, once you get to know me, you know that I can be crazy and goofy and most likely make you laugh ;)...hehe! I want to be more popular...and I also want to feel better about myself. I want people to feel comfortable around me, like they can talk to me about anything. That's going to take some time, like everything else. Well, I shall be off. Peace out and adios, -Affy

      Tomorrow starts another week....and I pretty much feel crappy... It feels as though I'm not accomplishing all that I want to this summer, like I'm not reaching all my goals. On the last day of school, I promised myself that I wasn't going to sit around and waste my summer. I was supposed to make myself a better person (no matter how silly it sounds) - by reading, exercising, jogging, cleaning my room regularly, studying for my SATs, etc. But everything has just started going up in smoke....everything mentioned above, AND the hope of ever getting a new boyfriend. The days go by... I get more bored and lonely. I only wish to have a friend that's available one day to go to a movie or out to lunch or something. I need someone to hang out with and talk to - whether it be a friend,or even better, some LUCKY guy who would like to date me. I know that the only way to achieve my goals is to TRY, but sometimes...that just seems...so.....HARD. It sounds stupid, but I can almost predict that I will accomplish nothing this summer. I'll go back to school more depressed than ever, more unhappy than ever, and more lonely than ever. Sheesh..... I really need a friend right now. I need someone to talk to, laugh with. Everyone's busy. On a slightly better note, but still not a good one, I have decided to not play softball next year. I would rather just focus on basketball and getting into better shape. I think that this is a route to happiness for me. This way, I can play a sport that I love AND do a ton of after-school activities so that i can have a well-rounded college application and get my academic letterman jacket this year. Well look at that - another goal or two to add to my long list. I think that I'm going to go jogging tomorrow after I get back from practicing basketball and attempting to lift weights....hmmmmmm, sounds fun. Welp, I'm off to shower and get ready for bed. Peace out and adios,  -Affy

      Howdy ya'll!!! I haven't typed anything on here in days...oh well, it's not like anyone actually reads it... Welp, today I really feel like crap. I hope that I'm not coming down with anything because I need to go to basketball and softball practice tomorrow.....I was supposed to pay for basketball camp yesterday, but I wasn't there. So, I'm fixin to call Coach Wheeler to see if it will be too late to pay for it tomorrow. Hopefully it isn't :S....And if it is, oh well, I'll eventually get over it...I guess, hehe...Well, I'm going to go and take some asprin for my stupid headache, and ALSO (mom will be so proud of me) I'm going to ACTUALLY finish cleaning up my room... So, I'm outtie...Peace out and adios! - Affy
