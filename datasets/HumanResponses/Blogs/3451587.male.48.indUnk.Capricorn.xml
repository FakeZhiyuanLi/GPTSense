      A novel from the 70's. Part of a series that kept going and going and going... This first story seems the most thought provoking. The others probably just develop the theme. I don't remember them either. More after I read them again.  The theme is...machines are evolving much quicker than the biologicals (which create the machines then die out). The trend is helped along by the machines sending out recon ships that report back.  A visitor to our Solar system, called a Snark by Nigel Walmseley(sp?), comes and goes but leads Earthers to a crashed ship in the Moon which may have aided human evolution 1 million to 1/2 million years ago.  A plot twister though is there have been a series of novas on a direct line in the direction from which the Snark came...suggesting that something is blowing things up.

      Rock'em Sock'em book series here.  A universe where humans have split into Adamists, who are plain vanilla, tech users, and Edenists, who have geneered themselves into psychic connection with each other and their grown space habitats and grown ships, called voidhawks.  On a colony planet, Lalonde, something nasty has entered the universe, some evil energy, ooooh, that takes over people, yikes, and turns them into super bad guys,  whoa!  A ship captain, an Adamist, but with nanotech in his brain to connect him with computers, is a hero of sorts, name of Joshua Calvert.  His girlfriend is an Edenist, who is also a persona/human for a habitat called Tranquillity, her name is Ione Saldana.  By coincidence Ione and her scientists on Tranquility are studying the ruins of another alien habitat that self destructed, no doubt caused by the same bogies that are breaking out in this story.  Well written page turner with good characters.  This is part 1, the Emergence. A report on Part Two, the Expansion, will soon follow.  CCPL only has the second part, so I had to ILL the Emergence.

      Okay, Savannah made it through two time zones without major mishap.  Now, she just has to get through a week in a land ruled by the Terminator.  Of course when she returns, how will I know it is her and not some clone experiment dreamed up by some movie studio hack seeking plot lines for a new Candid Camera knockoff Fall program?  Hhhmmn. Maybe I will have to pinch her and see if she squeaks?

      Hey Bodine, Jenny Poo, and Barry Too,  What are you going to do with my daughter out there on the wrong coast?  Everybody is hoping you will take them all to lots of Museums!  Baaaannk!  Not!!  NO WAY Bodine! We got museums back home.  Savannah wants to get discovered by some Hollywood producer. Where do they go to do that?  Jennifer, maybe you can get Big Mom on the Tonight Show. That would be fun, eh?  No fishing Jeff. Nobody wants to go fishing.  What are ya'll going to do anyway?

      Hey...Last week I met with my first girlfriend from Middle School.  What can I say, my heart panged and my mind paused again.  Sigh. Even after more than 30 years away from the place, she stopped my heart again.  I wrote a poem.    35 Years Later   Yeah…I saw her at the reunion.  After more than 30 years, I saw her and my heart dropped, stopped 	and started again.   My life as I knew it was ended. The careful fiction built up all those years  	crumbled.  I turned back to the stumbling boy who lost his heart.  We talked of nothing.  What to say?  Even back then, she had gone on with her life. I tripped myself into a bounding farce of dope, drink, exuberance, 	ribald humor, and buried depression.  You can’t grieve what you won’t admit exists. You can’t grieve what isn’t there. Blah. Blah blah. Blah blah blah blah.  She didn’t remember the princess ring. Or the two rubber bands or the cork. Our Christmas.  Her mother liked me? She liked my mother? What?  She thought  I was…what? I never knew.  Now? What?

       Teachers make the worst students. I have given workshops for them, and they talk constantly during the presentation. They talk to each other, and talk and comment on what you say, if they pay attention to you at all.     &nbsp;   They don't listen well, they spend the whole time talking and laughing with each other. They ignore what you say, and ask each other how to do the activities. Often trading the wrong answer back and forth.        They come late; they leave early. &nbsp;   &nbsp;   And they Cheat! They look back and forth on each others papers, comparing answers and changing them&nbsp;as their whims direct.     &nbsp;   And they spend the whole time griping about their students, and cracking on&nbsp;the bad&nbsp;behavior of&nbsp; the kids.   &nbsp;   Ha! &nbsp;  &nbsp;
