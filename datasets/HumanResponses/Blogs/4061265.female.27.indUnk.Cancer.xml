      A SCANDAL might be brewing in  urlLink John Kerry's  camp over revelations that his biggest donor, billionaire playboy  urlLink Steve Bing , has close ties to a Mafia hitman. Bing, who inherited a $600 million real estate fortune courtesy of his grandfather, Leo Bing, has amassed over $16 million for the Democrats. He has donated $8.1 million to groups that are creating and airing anti-George Bush TV ads, according to  urlLink Variety .  Now,  urlLink ABC News  reports that one of Bing's close friends is  urlLink Dominic Montemarano, a.k.a. Donnie Shacks , a New York-based Mafia hit man who did 12 years in prison on racketeering charges and is currently serving four years for domestic violence.  urlLink The L.A. Times  has reported that Bing paid Montemarano's legal fees the last time he had a brush with the law. ABC described Montemarano as Bing's "business partner" and "employee" — although Bing's lawyer, Marty Singer, says that's not the case.  Former NYPD investigator Joe Coffey told ABC, "Donnie Shacks' main activity was murder, no question about it. That was his main function for the Colombo family and for organized crime in general. He was one of the top hit men in the New York area."  Bing was in Boston this week for the  urlLink Democratic convention , where he was lunching with vice-presidential nominee  urlLink John Edwards , when ABC confronted him with a photo of himself,  urlLink Elizabeth Hurley  and Montemarano. Bing refused to answer questions about his wise guy pal. Montemarano starred in 2002's " urlLink Night at the Golden Eagle ," a pulp fiction-style flick co-starring  urlLink Natasha Lyonne  about a career criminal. The picture, financed by Bing, was described by movie maven  urlLink Leonard Maltin  as a "grim, distasteful melodrama." Singer says that Bing and Montemarano are "friendly," but insists the movie was the extent of their business dealings. "That's the only business relationship they have," Singer says. "He was not an employee of Mr. Bing's. We are demanding a retraction and correction from ABC."  Bing, who has fathered children with Elizabeth Hurley and fellow billionaire  urlLink Kirk Kerkorian's  ex-wife  urlLink Lisa Bonder  (listed as Nastiest Divorce), has refused to discuss his donations. The Democrats have said they know nothing of the Montemarano connection.  From Page Six

      The Long Island Lolita has written a  urlLink book . Between the Baldwins and the Butt-a-few-co mess,  urlLink Massapequa  is quite an interesting place...

I interned there over the summer between my junior and senior year at  urlLink Stony Brook University . It was not interesting, but maybe if she wrote for it back then, it would have been.

       urlLink Paris Hilton  and  urlLink Nick Carter  conducted their relationship with such class and decorum that we must say we're shocked -- shocked! -- that their breakup is spiraling into a game of he said/she said. Just one week after issuing competing press releases announcing their PDA-filled days were over, the ex-lovebirds are separately explaining what went wrong. "Our relationship totally was based on distrust," Carter snips in an interview with  urlLink People . "She didn't trust me. I didn't trust her." As for reports they strayed on one another, the once and future boy-bander says, "The only comment I'm going to have to that is that I'm loyal to those who are loyal to me."  Paris, over to you in  urlLink Us Weekly : "I'm a faithful girlfriend. I never cheat. It's so wrong to do that when you're intimate with another person. The papers would say, 'Paris was with this actor, and they were kissing.' At first, he was upset, but at the end of the day, Nick knew the rumors weren't true."  Both parties agreed the breakup took place over the phone, with Paris getting bonus points for revealing her epiphany and subsequent unorthodox counsel. "I was getting my makeup done [for a photo shoot], and it just hit me: I love Nick, but I need time alone. I called my psychic, and I asked her opinion. She thought I should be alone, and I agreed with her." After the split, she went "straight to the  urlLink Kabbalah center" in L.A.  and picked up a new  urlLink red string bracelet  to  urlLink help her "deal."   Like many misguided young lovers, the twosome decided to pledge their love in permanent ink. "We got tattoos together three weeks ago," says Carter, who etched "Paris" on his wrist. He gallantly says he has no tattoo rue since his ex will "have a place in my heart, always." The " urlLink Simple Life " star is thrilled to be back on the market. "I'm happy, really happy," she tells the mag. "I've never been single in my life. I just want to be alone for once, so I can find out who I am." Ditto, says Nick, who proclaims, "I just want everybody to know that I'm single and ready to have fun again. I'm a wild and crazy guy."

      So  urlLink Catherine Zeta-Jones was being stalked  by a woman obsessed with her bag-o-bones husband, Michael Douglas. The woman is being tried now and this is pretty intense (from  urlLink MSN ):  "Dawnette Knight's infatuation with Douglas allegedly included making threatening phone calls and sending graphic letters, which, among other things, detailed a mock funeral for Zeta-Jones and referenced the Manson Family murders.  During her three hours of testimony, an emotional Zeta-Jones read aloud from the missives, which included such violent threats as, "We are going to slice her up like meat on a bone and feed her to the dogs," and "slash her throat like OJ did." One letter threatened it would be "the biggest murder ... in entertainment history.'"

      Can't I just shrink Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson down to Thumbellina sizes and carry them around with me in my pocket? They captured my heart with " urlLink Zoolander " and my love grew after seeing " urlLink Starsky & Hutch ." " urlLink Old School " would have been a&nbsp;lot better with Owen instead of Luke and if it included a cameo by Ben.   While on the topic of movies, I'm excited about seeing " urlLink The Village " tomorrow. I like Joaquin. I hope M. Night Shamalamalamalamalamalama doesn't disappoint.

      but why...WHY...do I still watch  urlLink The Ashlee Simpson Show ? From her self-indulgent whining to her sucky voice and ridiculous attempts at being cute, she really has no business being on my TV on Wednesdays at 10:30 pm. She's not punk, folks. Let me put it this way, she's about as punk as  urlLink Frankie  from  urlLink Real World San Diego  is when she claimed to be  urlLink too punk rock  to be on The Real World San Diego, while managing to take up episode after episode with her pseudo-teenage angst ways. Those kids gave  urlLink San Diego  a bad name...

      J-LO’S mum is said to be missing her daughter’s former fiancé BEN AFFLECK. Guadalupe Lopez was overheard saying how much she liked the actor, who split from Jennifer in January, and how she wasn’t fond of her new hubby Marc Anthony.   Hmmm...I wonder why&nbsp;you liked Ben so much more, Guadalupe...maybe it's because he would buy you and your daugther Bentleys and whatnot...   Including gem-encrusted toilets (from April 11, 2003):   AFFLECK BUYS GEM-STUDDED LOO FOR J.LO  Ben Affleck has bought fiancee Jennifer Lopez a $105,000 gem-studded toilet seat. The pop diva's new loo is encrusted with rubies, sapphires, pearls and a diamond. A source tells British newspaper the Daily Star, "The stones are set inside the plastic, so Jennifer's behind won't get scratched." Affleck, who is expected to marry his belle later this year, designed the seat himself. He told a friend, "Jennifer is my princess and she deserves only the best -- even when it comes to toilets."

      Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen's 2005 Calendars   It may only be the lazy days of summer, but MARY-KATE and&nbsp;ASHLEY OLSEN&nbsp;weren't caught snoozing. The twins already shot the photos for their saucy pinup calendars for 2005,&nbsp; one calendar is generic, the other is full of movie stills from their feature film, ' urlLink New York Minute .'  Needless to say, photos for both were taken before Mary-Kate began treatment for her eating disorder last June. On a happy note, last Friday, July 23, six weeks after she entered the clinic, Mary-Kate was discharged.   According to her spokesperson, "She is feeling very well and is looking forward to rejoining her family and friends and preparing for her freshman year at  urlLink New York University ."   The 5'1" Mary-Kate reportedly had put on eight to 10 pounds during her stay, and she is back on track to attend freshman orientation at NYU on Aug. 30 and 31. The representative for the twins also made it clear that there was no intervention. Mary-Kate entered the treatment center voluntarily as a proactive way of addressing the issue before starting college. Additionally, arrangements have already been made for follow-up counseling.   The 16-month Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen calendars will be priced at $12.99 apiece and available for purchase late summer. For more info, check their website www.marykateandashley.com at that time.

      It's been said everywhere that  urlLink Ken Jennings  is putting Jeopardy! back on the map and it's getting the highest number of viewers in the history the game. I know I was watching it everyday to see&nbsp;how Ken was going to do. But once he gets beat, I doubt I'll watch religiously again. And almost everyone watching won't watch religiously again. So Jeopardy! will slide back into oblivion and Alex will just have to be satisfied with mere memories of Ken...   Also, Ken is from Salt Lake City and it was revealed in&nbsp;one of the inane two-minute interviews before the second half of the Jeopardy! round begins that Ken is a  urlLink teetotaler ...all I have to say to that is  WOW!  I mean, people can do whatever they want, but abstaining   COMPLETELY   from  urlLink alcohol ??? Seriously, he can't be serious, right?

      **Kirsten Dunst apparently rebounded with a French fling shortly after breaking up with Jake Gyllenhaal. During the European press tour for "Spider-Man 2" earlier in the month, friends say Dunst enjoyed a little Parisian romance with an unidentified French actor. But Dunst is now single and stateside again, filming "Elizabethtown" in Kentucky.  **Tara Reid was well on her way to transforming herself into a Paris Hilton clone, but she's been ordered to rein it in by her unhappy management. Reid, who recently had breast implants, also had $2,500 hair extensions put in and dyed her hair white-blond at Vered, the same L.A. salon Hilton frequents.&nbsp;But apparently her agent didn't like the results and last Wednesday marched her back to the salon to have her hair dyed a more natural blond.  **Now that popular spinmaster DJ AM — Nicole Richie's boyfriend — has lost a ton of weight by a rumored stomach-stapling surgery, he's a lot cheaper to hire. At his heaviest, party planners had to book two first-class seats to fly him in for events. Now he's back to single-seat size and happily showing off his new bod on a Hawaiian vacation with his sweetie.  From the best: NY Post--Page 6

      Dentist Allegedly Injected Semen Into Patients' Mouths   Woman Said Substance Tasted Like Semen   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Former employees of a dentist claim the man made female patients unwittingly swallow his semen during visits to his office in Cornelius. Dr. John Hall is accused by the state dental board of violating dentistry's standard of care, engaging in immoral conduct, and committing sexual assault or battery. Six former patients -- including a 14-year-old -- say he tricked them into swallowing his semen. A seventh claims he jumped on top of her in the dental chair and "began to gyrate against her lower body in a sexual manner." The dental board suspended Hall's license Nov. 5, after police began investigating allegations by two former employees. In February, it conditionally restored his license, barring him from being alone with female patients. Hall's lawyers say the dentist has been falsely accused by disgruntled former employees. He was collecting his semen because he was taking Propecia, a drug to promote hair growth, and was concerned about potential side effects that include low sperm count and diminished semen, his lawyer, Emerson Thompson, said. The dental board heard testimony Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The hearing is to continue next weekend. The five-member panel will decide whether Hall can keep his license. The case is still being investigated by authorities in Charlotte, Cornelius and Mecklenburg County. Hall's former assistant Cheryl Lynn MacLeod testified Saturday that she found it odd that Hall began asking her to leave a patient's side to retrieve items that he never used. She also became suspicious when she overheard him tell patients to "swallow" something, and when she saw him take a syringe out of his lab coat pocket while working beside a patient. In May 2003, she and former office administrator Susie Hillman took the five syringes from office waste containers and Hall's lab coat pockets and gave them to police. Hall's lawyer, Thompson, suggested the substance Hall asked patients to swallow could have been a dental product. But in a sworn deposition read aloud Saturday, Hall's former dental assistant Rhonda Hamilton described several dental products used in Hall's office and none matched the patients' descriptions of what was put in their mouths. When Cornelius police searched Hall's office Nov. 5, they confiscated five more syringes with Hall's semen from his desk, according to the board and hearing testimony. Five of the six patients testified Friday. The first, a 40-year-old woman, said she objected when Hall began to put a substance from a syringe into her mouth during a procedure on Sept. 4, telling him: "That smells like sperm." She said Hall drew back and said, "You're crazy." She said she couldn't taste the substance because her mouth was numb. Another witness, a 33-year-old woman, said Hall asked his assistant to retrieve something from another room during her appointment in May 2003. While the assistant was gone, she said Hall told her to lie back, open her mouth and swallow. "When I swallowed I tasted it, and it was semen. ... He told me it was cleaning solution." She said she drove directly to her husband's office nearby and told him what happened, but he and a colleague dismissed the idea. She said she tried to convince herself she was wrong, and contacted police only after hearing about the investigation on the news.

       "Simpsons": A Gay Old Time       A  Simpsons  toon is coming out of the closet. Not that there's anything wrong with that.            Speaking during a weekend panel at San Diego's Comic-Con convention, show producers dropped a bomb: An upcoming  Simpsons  story line will focus on what happens when Springfield legalizes gay marriage.                        "We have a show where, to raise money, Springfield legalizes gay marriage," producer Al Jean told comic book fans. "Homer becomes a minister by going on the Internet and filling out a form. A longtime character comes out of the closet, but I'm not saying who."                        And with that,  Simpsons  aficionados got their gaydar on and began winnowing down the list of potential suspects.                         The early favorite appears to be billionaire Monty Burns' ever-devoted sidekick, Waylon Smithers, who--aside from being a yes-man--has been known to collect Malibu Stacy dolls, lives in the gay part of town (where Homer once shacked up with two gay guys), has a Mr. Burns screensaver and dreams of a naked Mr. Burns jumping out of a birthday cake.                        But that might be too easy. According to online fan scuttlebutt, there are other characters who might be secretly having a gay old time in Springfield, including Homer's regular-guy cohorts at the nuclear plant, Carl and Lenny, as well as Moe the bartender, the Reverend Lovejoy, Principal Skinner and Comic Book Guy. Of course, the producers didn't rule out a lesbian wedding, either.                         "It's Homer!" said a joking  Simpsons  creator Matt Groening to conventiongoers.                       The gay marriage-themed episode is scheduled to air in January.                       While the coming-out comments generated the most interest, the show's brain trust also outlined some other upcoming plots. For instance, Springfield residents will also have a cow over corrupt Mayor Quimby and seek to recall him from office--a riff on California recall election in which Arnold Schwarzenegger defeated then Governor Gray Davis. No word whether  The Simpsons ' Ah-nuld look-alike, Rainier Wolfcastle, will be leading the effort to replace Quimby.                       Meanwhile, celebs expected to lend their voices to the show next season include Kim Cattrall, Ray Romano, James Caan and rapper 50 Cent.                       Groening also addressed the long-talked about  Simpsons  animated movie. He said that plans are still underway, but work on a big screen version won't begin until the tube series takes its final bow.                       That could be awhile.                        Now heading into its 16th season,  The Simpsons  is still posting solid ratings and consistently ranks number one in its Sunday time slot for adults 18-49, the category coveted by advertisers. It has also become the longest running comedy series on the tube and has spawned a billion-dollar franchise for Fox, which after some protracted negotiations,  agreed to a new four-year deal with the show's six stars that gave each of them a whopping pay raise to $250,000 per episode.                        Plenty of d'oh, indeed.

       urlLink Public relation princess   urlLink Lizzie Grubman  is following in Paris Hilton's stilettos. The power publicist who rocketed to fame after ramming Hamptons revelers with her sport-utility vehicle a couple of summers ago has officially scored her own long-rumored reality show on MTV. No, she will not be milking cows or falling off horses, as Hilton did. Rather, she'll be doing what she does best - organizing and attending parties. "Power Girls," targeted for debut next spring, will follow Lizzie and "her girls" - the women who work for her at her SoHo public relations company. "I'm confident the people will enjoy the show," Grubman said yesterday. "The show is about a group of successful, smart, hardworking women in a very glamorous field. It's exciting, but it's all about how hard we work." But why would someone who has had such a tumultuous relationship with the media invite cameras to follow her? "What happened to me," Grubman said, "is in the past. I work with the media, and I understand that at that point in my life, the media had a job to do." Grubman said the show is not all about her. "The girls who work for me, they love it," Grubman said. "They're having a lot of fun with it. It's a great opportunity for everyone here." [ urlLink NYDN ]

       urlLink Heather Matarazzo , beloved by many for her role as abused geek Dawn "Wiener Dog" Wiener in " urlLink Welcome to the Dollhouse ," has matter-of-factly come out of the closet. The actress, out stumping for " urlLink The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement ," says the love of a good woman has transformed her life. "I'm not as angry anymore," Matarazzo tells the  urlLink New York Daily News . "I met the person I'm so madly in love with. She's not famous yet. She will be. She wants to do musical theater and stage, which is not as demoralizing as the movie business." For now, Heather is keeping mum on the name of her significant other. [ urlLink MSN ]

      Cindy Adams for the mother of all newspapers, the  urlLink NY Post , breaks it down:  FOREIGNERS, out-of- towners, bumpkins, yokels, aliens, visitors, GOPniks from the 'burbs, weirdsvilles from far-away galaxies like Minnesota and North Dakota will soon descend on us. In the interests of said strange beings, I hereby prep a how-to handbook, AKA a New York survival kit.  For a taxi: * Stand out in the street, in the road, off the curb, in the middle of traffic. Wave your hand. Wait politely on a curb or in a line or hunt for a taxi stand, and you'll still be waiting long after Hillary is president.  * If a cab comes toward you and another human grabs it, push him. Elbow him. Knee him. Screech: "Sicko, this is mine!" I mean, there are rules.  * Do not, absolutely do not, ask directions to any address on "Avenue of the Americas." Nobody, absolutely nobody, uses that name, and this includes those imbeciles who so named it. Even immigrants from downtown Albania know it's Sixth Avenue. New York goes uptown and downtown primarily by consecutive avenues such as Tenth, Ninth, Eighth, Seventh. There is also Fifth Avenue. Somewhere in between is something some wacko rechristened Avenue of the Americas. Lotsa luck. You want to get there, you ask for Sixth Avenue.  * It is not necessary to place your generally voluptuous-sized backsides in bright-orange shorts or hot-pink culottes. Despite being summertime, calmer, cooler colors are appreciated on city streets. We realize that pink is the black of Iowa, still it is not a fashion statement in New York City. Try gray, white, tan, black, navy. Try shrinking your behinds before coming here altogether.  The 11th Commandment: * Thou shalt not talk to people on the street. They will immediately have you arrested.  * And for God's sake, lose that camera that's always slung across your chest like The Order of the Garter.  * While we appreciate our skyline, take a tip: It is not smart to keep looking up. With almost as many beagles, bassets and bichons as we have Latin-Americans, African-Americans and Native Americans, it's smarter to keep looking down.  Walk briskly: * Forget sauntering or lolly- gagging. Even jobless New Yorkers rush. They maybe don't know why they're in a hurry, they only know they are. They could have no place to go other than the unemployment office — but they have to get there quickly.  Use your cellphone constantly: * No matter if someone's on the other end. Consider it a prop. Hold it in your hand as you eat, drink or shop. Talk into it ceaselessly. Stick it in your ear. If you don't have Krazy Glue, try plastic surgery. Get the thing permanently grafted onto your lobe. Very important to shout into it in restaurants and theaters, on street corners and buses.  Bitch about everything: * Your boss, your wife, your kid, your health, your sex life, your lot, your life, your lousy hotel room.  Buy off the street: * Bargain. However, examine the product. If purchasing something, say, for instance, like a gold chain, note if perfume's on it. As in, it might very recently have been on the neck of a passer-by two blocks down.  Food: * Eat a hot dog. Don't ask questions, just eat it.  * Buy a bagel. Request "a shmear."  * Do not cut your pizza slice with a knife and fork. Fold longways, shove it in your mouth and shut up.  * In a deli, when ordering a pastrami sandwich, it is not wise to ask for mayo. Also, lose the request for white bread.  * Don't fret over lack of time to finish your morning coffee leisurely at some counter. Nobody does. Sipping is for visitors. Schlepping is for New Yorkers. Carry it in a brown paper bag. Everybody does.  * Certain coffee-shop protocol is to be observed. The server hasn't taken your order? Shout: "What're ya blind? I been here an hour already." And, should his/her thumb be in the soup bowl as they bring it, best not to make a fuss because then it'll take another hour for the server to notice you.  Cross wherever and whenever: * If green isn't your favorite color, just make a mad, wild, frenetic dash.  Read The Post.  Welcome to The Greatest City on Earth.  Try our restaurants, try our shows. Just don't try our patience.

      Reporting in from Montreal... I'm doing the French Canadian thing up here, and I have one word of advice for all of you: Cajun style Alligator.  Fantastique.  And by the way, Canadien TV isn't nearly as prudish as American, as I watched a girl demonstrate how to masturbate a guy on basic cable last night. Again,  Fantastique.  Will report more later on French Stewardesses, The Shortness of Canada, The Homeless of the North, Another Reason to Avoid Starbucks, Canadian Eats, Canuck Coins and Contemporary Art.

      Paris and Nicky's Beverly Hills mansion was broken into a few days ago. A lot of bling-bling was stolen, but the Hiltons will have no problem replacing those. It's the other things that won't be able to be replaced. Supposedly a laptop was stolen, a laptop containing photos and video footage of Paris with Backstreeter Nick Carter.

      This morning I've just discovered that  urlLink Sephora  carries my most fave perfume:  urlLink Forever and Ever , by Dior. I was given a bottle of this by John's mom a couple of years ago for Xmas. She had gotten it on the ship while they were on a cruise. After eventually finishing the contents of the bottle, savoring every little drop that came out of it, I looked everywhere to find it. Nowhere was it to be found. I accepted the conditions of my situation and moved back to my other fave scent, a much more readily available one,  urlLink Gap Dream . But just a few moments ago, while surfing the Sephora site, I got reminded of Forever and Ever and looked to see if it was there...and it was. And so, I will be going to Sephora after work.

      Nothing brings down the quality of my day as eagerly going to  urlLink Costco  during lunch and finding a crappy sample spread. A few weeks ago, a coworker and I discovered that by going on two consecutive Thursdays, we scored mega-samples. I mean, there were spring rolls, raviolis, chips and dip, peach studels, fries, cream puffs, pitas--the place was like a freakin' buffet. We were so full, we didn't even need to buy lunch. So as trend would have it, we went last Thursday to score and let's say the offerings weren't up to par. Despite the waste-of-space sample stands: Joint Juice--which the name alone is enough to make me hurl, and some nasty Snapple/Ensure-type juice, we managed to get seconds and thirds of some BBQ chicken breast. With mustered faith, we made out way over there again today. And today was the worst ever. Even the Joint Juice wasn't there.

      So I've been hearing from various sources that Madonna's marriage is on the rocks. Supposedly  urlLink Guy Ritchie  is sick of being Mr. Madonna and is sick of her obsession with Kabbalah. I've heard she consults with her rabbi before making any sort of decision and he's constantly advising her on crap any other normal person would be able to think of on their own. I've also heard that Guy nearly punched out said rabbi at some function where he was doing his advising.  And so Madonna continues pimping Kabbalah by financing  urlLink her own Kabbalah school  to be opened in NYC with classes starting in December.

      A company in the Netherlands has created sporty alternatives to the traditional Muslim head coverings. They describe themselves as such: Capsters is a range of head-accessoiries that can be used for different purposes. It can be worn for different sports activities but it can also protect you against the wind or cold weather during outdoor activities. The concept is based on the idea to give Muslim girls and their gymteachers in the Netherlands a safe alternative for the traditional hijab to wear during gym-class. The designs are realised in close co-operation with Muslim girls and an Imam. Check out the stylish lids  urlLink here .

      How I love the guilty pleasure that is " urlLink Outback Jack ." How I love that these girls will catch baby alligators, ride on horses, canoe down the river, eat ants (the list goes on and on) in order to win the affection of our outdoorsy lad,  urlLink Jack , from East Melbourne, Australia. And the great thing is is that all the  urlLink girls are basically Barbies come-to-life . Yesterday, Jack got rid of one girl,  urlLink Maria , the contestant with the most potential for becoming his stalker and can easily be led to slashing her wrists based on her elimination. She cried and moaned and cried some more. "My heart is broken." Maria says. "And it's like you keep falling and you keep falling, and this time there's no parachute. You just hit smack dab on the ground. At first the view was nice and beautiful, but near the end you get nervous and you realize you're not going to make it."  urlLink Marissa  and  urlLink Natalie  are the two chickies remaining.  But what makes this looking for love-type reality show the greatest is the pain and tears that Jack exhibits everytime he has to eliminate one of the girls. He literally stands there as he tells each girl how special they are with tears streaming down his face, afflicted with the sniffles, and perpetually sullen eyes--the whole nine! It's truly remarkable.

I don't care if they take my photo - although I don't know why anyone needs another picture of me. I don't care if they Vanessa's photo, but when they take care of my kids, that I can't support. If I catch them I'll bite their noses off and swallow it."  From  urlLink IMDB

      People actually thought it would have ended in marriage???  Pop singer Nick Carter broke down in tears during a reunion with his  urlLink Backstreet Boy  bandmates in Los Angeles on Friday - after he was quizzed over ex-lover Paris Hilton's shocking bruises. The hitmaker has rubbished speculation that he was responsible for Hilton's injuries, which were discovered after she was spotted with a swollen lip and bruised arms at Hollywood's Concord Club last Wednesday. The couple split on July 22 following a seven month romance which many believed would end in marriage. Carter struggled to regain his composure as he and bandmates  urlLink AJ McLean ,  urlLink Howie Dorough  and  urlLink Kevin Richardson  worked on new material at a recording studio. He finally snapped after a passer-by berated him over the alleged incident. He ran to his car and was photographed sobbing with his head in his hands. One onlooker tells website Popstarinsider.Com: "Suddenly it got very intense. I won't go there with what happened, but the situation was sad. Next things we knew, Nick was in his car crying. I was about to cry too!" Hilton has refused to confirm Carter's explanation that she received the injuries during an S&M photo shoot.  From  urlLink IMDB

      A 60-foot black-and-white billboard showing Chloe Sevigny pleasuring Vincent Gallo was unveiled Saturday on Hollywood's Sunset Blvd. The steamy and controversial ad, plugging a notorious scene in the upcoming "X-Rated Adults Only" flick "The Brown Bunny," which opens next month, went up near the famed Chateau Marmont Hotel. Wonder what they'll charge for a room with a view. "The film is about a broken-down love, so I thought...this image represents a lot of conflict," Gallo told us. "I feel that there is an extremely complicated subtext to what they are doing."  Morning commuters might not be the only ones getting a shock from the picture. Gallo, who also wrote, produced and directed the film, said he "doesn't think Chloe has seen [the image]."  And Gallo thinks this should just be a start: "Chloe is one of the most beautiful and talented people in the world; she should be on 10 billboards on Sunset Blvd."  However, local leaders - many of whom view the billboard as pornographic - are threatening to protest the promo and are promising to bring it down.  Gallo is now in New York and says he will attend the Republican National Convention later this month. "I'm here trying to help out in any way that I can. I have made it clear that I am open in any way to promote and protect the Republican administration," he said. Well, the GOP, which openly supports and courts the Religious Right, might very well greet him with a chorus of: "Mr. Gallo, tear down that billboard!"
