      I just remembered that I have a free period tomorrow because I don't have to take the Driver's Ed final. So I get a full hour and a half of extra study time for my Geometry final!

      Good job Lakers in getting yourself beat by 18. Keep it up and you won't even get to have a chance at winning the championship. Heck, the Timberwolves are pretty cool and Kevin Garnett deserves it, so keep up the good work.

      Coming live from Mr. Alba's first period Driver's Ed. class it is me again. I have free time to study for finals tomorrow. It's always a lot of fun to have free time in Driver's Ed. Knock out a forgotten homework assingment for school or something else. Sometimes I get to chill and cruze the internet.

      Due to low ratings and my sudden lack of interest there will not be any Weekly Hater Day. It sounded fun but it was actually pretty boring after awhile.

        urlLink     urlLink     What the heck is up with LA basketball teams? The Clippers can never keep a player because they always trade and mess up the team. For example,  I thought Darius Miles was pretty good and he helped the team a lot,  but no   they just had to trade him. As for the Lakers, I don't know what it is but something about I dislike. The only reason  they deserve a championship this year is because of Payton and Malone.

      It is kind of weired how I am doing all of these blogs and probably no one has even seen it it. Not that it really matters but it is  kind of defeats the purpose of it all.

      Warning Reader! Never try and get a running start to touch the ceiling of your garage, because you may end up slipping on a random article of clothing and slamming into your dryer causing there to be a large dent in it. You know, just a suggestion. . .

I know Sunday sounds like a bad day, but hey the Bible says you can't work on Sunday and says nothing about hatin'. Besides hatin' now a days isn't much work anyway. . .

      New Orleans is a lot cooler then I thought it would be. There is a lot of cool things to do here and you get use to the 85 degree plus weather (plus a crap load of humidity)pretty fast. The food is awesome and the only thing I can complain about is the streets that smell like vomit every ten steps you walk. This time I will have pictures because I bought a couple of disposable cameras. Now it's off to the zoo. . .

      I'm back again, I have been to bored to update. I'm leaving for New Orleans in 3 days and I won't be back for 5 weeks. I'm not sure if I will be able to update. At least i finally get to do something. When I return I will only be here for like two days then I'm leaving for Montreal (it is in Canada) for two weeks.  Then school starts soon . . . At least I will know some French!

       Yesterday, much to my dislike I had a couple of suprises when I gotto my pictures. Suprise #1, you can't get a CD with 110 film so I can't get it on the computer. Suprise #2, I turned in two rolls of film guess how many pictures I got? Five! One  roll was blank which was the good roll and the other only had the five! I was really mad.

      I've kind of stopped posting since the summer began, but now I am back, and school is actually over. Things were getting pretty dull like the end of the track season, but now it is over and I can enjoy my time off. At least the last day of school was pretty interesting when everyone showed up to find the long hall (which holds like two thirds of the classrooms) trashed by the seniors. Sucks for them because they got grad night cancelled.

      Yesterday when I arrived at the airport after my five hour flight I discovered that my bag had gone missing. I ended up having to go through this whole process so they would look for my bag. Any way I had to go shopping for another outfit because I didn`t know when my bag would be found. The malls here in Montreal are huge. It`s basically five stories of clothes, tech, and shoe stores. Plus there was more then one connected to each other. The good news is they found my bag and it should be delivered. I`ll try and get some pictures of Montreal. By the way, French is way harder then I thought but almost everyone speaks English too.

      It seems my blog is still being ignored by everyone, but whatever. . . I`m in Montreal right now and I feel like an idiot because I don`t know any French. It`s basically impossible to understand the person who runs my homestay unless she speaks in&nbsp;English first. Other then that the other two guys here are cool. All I have to do is find my way to class tomorrow using the Metro. Until then. . .&nbsp;

      My time here at Stanford is coming to a close, but this Journalism camp was actually pretty fun. The only problem I had was my watche's alarm isn't very loud so this morning I woke up at 7:45 and we're supposed to be at class at 8:00. Luckily I had taken a shower the night before and class didn't start until 8:15. Anyway,my summer is finally starting to end, but at least I get to go to Canada first.

      It seems I have been forgotten by everybody, but whatever. I'm at Stanford right now and in the middle of a rather hard journalism camp. The Governator is supposed to be here tomorrow, and I am trying to find a way to see his speech. Other then that nothing new. Also an ASB update would be nice.

      I'm having problems with this but hopefully this works. . . Anyway I am still on vacation and I will be returning home for a short while in a short while. Right now I am in Monterey but I will be heading up to Stanford soon. I've noticed mostly been ignored lately but if anything interesting has happened feel free to comment.

         I'm back in California, but I won't be returning home for another two and a half weeks. I will only be there two days because I leave for Montreal right after. I just got back from Berkely and it was pretty interesting, but mostly just crowed. The track camp was kind of fun, but I pulled my groin so I couldn't do anything most of the time. At least I have some cool stories for when I get back like how some of the other resident campers tried to stuff me down the linen shoot from eight stories up.

       Note to New Readers(If I have any at all): Due to the fact that I know no one looks at my blog I don't edit or check for grammar mistakes. Some things may not make sense but it is okay because no one sees it anyway. It's like thinking only it is on the internet.   P.S. If anyone does look spend the extra two seconds and a comment. There's like a million things to choose from.

      It all started in  New Orleans, Louisiana ! First off, you would not believe how humid it is there. That plus the heat could suffocate most people. Anyway,  New Orleans  was an awesome city. The only I didn't like was trash day because it made the city stink horribly. The zoo was the best one I have ever been to. It actually had interesting things to see unlike some other zoos (the  Santa Barbara Zoo  for example). My favorite day included three very important things: going to the zoo, seeing Harry Potter on an Imax screen and seeing the  Mississippi River  for the first time.  Holy crap it's huge!  No matter what you read the Mississippi looks bigger when you see it in real life. I was shocked because just the part within my eye sight was bigger then most lakes I have seen(I'm working on getting a picture). It was annoying that so many people acted like it was  Mardi Gras  every day there.  Typical dumb American Tourist .   Tomorrow, Part II describes my adventures at USM and what happens when everyone on your hall breaks camp rules at 12:00 pm on the last night.

       News Flash! While the actual man himself has died the spirit of Rick James will live on forever in a very annoying joke. (Note: I thought about putting in a joke about St. Peter asking Rick James his name at the gates of Heaven, but I decided against it.)

       I am now back in Oxnard and all of my summer camps are over. If I feel up to it I might post blogs on different camps. I might have pictures but They may be ruined. Anyway I'm sure everyone wants to here about all the cool things that happened in Montreal while I was there. Coming soon the  edited story of my summer (the unedited version coming to a Santa Clara College Preparatory High School near you).
