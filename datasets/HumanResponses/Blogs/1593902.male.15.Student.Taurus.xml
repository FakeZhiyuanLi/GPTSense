      Freak and I aren't talking....  Yea...He was bringing me down again. Bitching about Eric and I.  Let me give you the gist of it: According to Freak, Eric and I will NEVER work out. He sucks and I'm worthy of more. He swears on his life this is going to be another Chris and I situation   But this isn't the first time he makes me doubt one of my relationships  Chris--that was the start of it. Then Esteban. I remember that one the best.  And now Eric. And you know what's funny? He didn't approve of Esteban till after I left him. Moreover, it's the same tactic each and everytime.   See this is how he does it: He fills your mind up with negative thoughts. Makes you think that it will never work 'cause the odds are against you.  Hell, he even relates back to Chris!  "Oh, tits and ass 24/7. You can't compete with that." Well, jee, thanks Freak!!! Nice to know that everything my boy.f says is a crock of shit and will go down the drain when he sees big double D boobs in high school. Oh, and you know what else ?!  He'll sit there and pick the guy apart.  He will find EVERY fault in him and make them seem 100 X's worst than what they are and completely unbearable. Even though we live in a world where no one is perfect, he makes it seem as if I've picked the most imperfect out of the bunch.    Like I told Laura: "This boy puts me on a pedestal, and Franco always tries to knock me off it."  You know what else really blows? I'm weak-hella weak actually, and I'm REALLY easily manipulated. And I miss Freak. I'll prob. unblock him soon... Damn this Big bro. I love you hate you thing. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ from brandy to me. ________________ Now here's my response, see i've had a good day and i have to stand for this shit?  1) i never liked Chrissy. To me he was an intelligent but acted stupid. However this was a boy who hit me for no reason.   2)i like eban...i didn't like him cause i didn't know him....now i know better, shit out fot eh last three maybe he was best, though personally in someways i still likie chris for j0o.  3) this is not a "boy". because even guys usually qualify for IQ's. (goerge bush and tony blair excluded)  4) unless brandy you have a guy in YOUR school next to YOU like you were in rub. it won't work out. TRUST ME. and this goes to any girl out there. and if your intelligent...don't date poles. and i don't mean Polacks.  5) i do break your guys down brandy. and i break EVERYone down. including you. including the bisggest fucking prick out there. me. deal with it  6) don't take shit out on me in public court, ican make you feel like shit in an instant. and you havent seen my bad side.   7)thanks for ruining a good day  8) let's not talk about midget boy anymore  9) i don't knock you off a pedestal...i tell you the truth, because i happen to be realistic

       da freak writes something reminscent of good?  It's winter and I'm late I lost this game Of white Russian roulette but I'm fine I'm quite ok, And she knows I'm royal loyal to lovers I'll die here with you when my veins lose their hue  Cause I never fixed my broken jaw That's why my words don't ever come out at all, So when you come out fix another for me One hand's itching the other's missing I wish I was missing...  Birthmarked my arms in vain out my mouth and down the drain Shooting bullets through my blood, the bullets barely missed my brain And fly for five days around my bedroom in a haze And then I'll crash straight in the ground I wish I was never ever here...  And I don't know what's buried here (I think) I'm buried here and barely here...  Raccoon eyed and skin whiter than heavens best fighter I'm thinking she needs me, well do you girl? I guess we'll see And I know she's perfect, a hostage in purple We'll tie up our arms with my cancer and your charm  Cause I'll never kiss a broken jaw Fist fight the light that bounces off my walls So when you come out fix another for me One leg's limping, the other's missing I wish I was missing...  Dodging broken down satellites Mending my beaten up jaw line Last night I stayed on call all night And I watched her die three times tonight

      Hello. Welcome to the world of da Freak. who is Freak? He is in reality OcnarF ZilaC.  He is now headed to towards his freshman year. He is a foolish, pathetic human. A hopeless romantic. He tries to please. He fails miserably. And it really and truly affects him.      He is a world of lies. He has no friends...and if he does, he is sure to lose them soon. He is a loner, always has been and until resently he cared not what anyone gave a fuck.   For the first two grades life was dandy. class president. grade representative. leader of everyone. loved by everyone. Then life took it's first twist on him.  Made him move. from 3-7th grade he was despised.  But first in 6th grade his life was changed forever. Fell for the fierst real time for a girl.  Fell hard. Fell fast.  And so it was. Went well long enough. 9 months of joy, happiness. Then came May 16, 2000. His love. His first grandiouse savior. Betrayed him.  Paid 100$ 6 people came up with a world of lies. His bestfriend would not lie.  His enemies did.  His love did.  They claimed he had stated he wanted to blow himself up and kill all jewish (whom he likes) and Catholics which he is one. He was forced out of Doral Academy Charter School. The day before his birthday. On his birthday he registered in his new school. Then came West Miami Middle School. The Falcons.  He had 16 days to fit in, learn a new system. To catch up on all the shit he hadn't learned in Doral Academy.  All 6 months of which he had lost.  It seemed impossible.  But in what became known as the "Miraculous Justice". And as a testament to his two brain cells he passed all his classes. With an A. The counselor called it "the luckiest most incredible thing she had seen in her 25 years of counseling."    But last year has changed his life. He was backstabbed in a way no one could predict. And thus he hid in an illusionary world. He hid in himself, threw a "front" , a character at people.  Hid in a world of cold-heartedness. Threw out an iron face at the world and hid in himself. Then he was rescued. A minor ray of light came through. He wanted to give her the world.  But in many a ways he never got the chance. She was nothing more than his false messiah.  He fought in vain. Gained nothing but pure pain. Soraya was a failure.  It represented his life perfectly. It had begun well enough and had since become a shell of what it was.  8th grade began.  He then earned the one best thing of his life. His first true friend.  Brandy Sky Martinez...a name of poetic firm and a character of incredible charm. She kept him alive in his harshest moments.  A year in which he was atleast finally semi-accepted in the school. One which he is proud to say he was not the loner he was used to being.  But he remains anti-social.  He heads to highschool knowing this. There are now people who care about him. But he will never open up as easily as he had before. He will not show his weaknesses in the home of the Rams.  Coral Park will be his shining point. He will keep his old friends. He will make new acquaintences. But he will not let people know the truth about anything. He will be cold. He will not feel like this on the inside.  But he will not be hurt by people again. He refuses to let this happen. He will show compassion to some. To the rest he will not succumb. And he will not make anyone a permanent resident of his heart. Unless their already in it. He is ready....and those whom he trust. the few. the losers.  Will be linked here. It will be his only source of telling people what he really feels and thinks. And he will not go through another Soraya. Another Anne Marie. He will never again be hurt. Quote the Raven nevermore. _____________________________________________________________ Initial Readers will be Meily, Brandy (of course), Laura, Kathy, Carmen, Sofy.

      ok i got you all some new ocnarF ZilaC writings, a bit of a bash on da T.v. a bit or of a rash bleeding first. and Brandy thank you for the template, for some reason we've all been stumped on how to see the posts but it's cool..... ___________________  " Pathetic"  Honestly I don't believe I've ever been this weary My thinking is really tearing my whole inside outside and in I wish I had the nerve to do just something firm about it I'm sure I could live without it but now it seems that we begin  To toss an eye exchange a smile from miles apart it seems And yet it's hard to tell what's really happing from dreams Is it just that we've both thinking is this stuff for real And what if in the midst of this all what if some would see  If this real it seems to me to be good ol' infatuation What if I am wrong and mix the facts with my imagination Knee deep in this mess no wonder I don't sleep too good at night Yes still I've never felt more all right  Hey, were you looking my way or was I standing in the way I'm like a moth hot for the flame I just can't help it  I've been thinking should you accept an invitation Can't help this fascination and yet if you were here I'd freexe I count the days 'til I'll see you again and wish you'll be there And yet if you would come near again I'd get those jelly knees  So we toss an eye exchange a smile but we never move too close And yet make sure to make it short we want no one to know Can I help that I am wondering is this for real Are you thinking much the same as I then you must feel like me Until the two of us have come to terms with how to act from now on We are gonna have to walk in quite wide circles 'round each other Can not wait until the day when you and I decide What to do 'til then I guess I'll be allright _____________________________________________  "Television"  Before that sacred holy flickering tv-screen You're served commercials day-time fakes and tv-priests You keep your VCR running almost constantly Afraid to miss out on something happening on channel three  You zap from channel one to two look what they have done to you You live from staged realities and fakes Channel three then four and five you double check your tv-guide Re-enacted lives to keep you awake  Life is served Here every taste will find our satisfaction guarantee On the never sleeping flickering screen  You keep watching this truly weird masquarade The flickering screen enchants you your truly all enslaved  Nostalgia sports and comedies, cops cartoons and tragedies Remote control at hand you sit enslaved Washing powder and apple pies re-runs soaps and Jesus Christ Anytime is time to zap the world away

      eh..things last night seem a bit more complicated with meily. she can change her mind quickly about things. all i want her to know is this. i love her. i'll fight for her. and i'll be by her side no matter how much time it takes, i can wait 4 more days. i can wait 4 more years. and i can't wait 40 more if she needs them. i'll be here waiting (like a stone, lol) ii don't care if all i get from her is a hug in the morning and a i love you at night online.... it would be enough to keep me going. see i need her to realize that...i'm here for her, i really have fallen for her and that as brandy said, once i love you , i love you forever. i'm willing to do anything for her.  any lenghts nec.  anything.

      Alone again tonight In this empty time The sound in my head The sight leaves me blind  I'll write a million words I'll sing until it hurts How far could this be Until it's seen  How long will I let this go I can't stand to spend another night alone  I stare at the empty walls I speak, no one hears I make every excuse And blame my fears  All these shadows come to rest In my head I can't see you I can't hear the things you said  There is a secret place You'll find a bloodstained fence It's there the future speaks And it spoke to me ___________________ I’m gonna close up to everyone cept brandy and carmen and  sofy of course. I’m tired of being hurt. Tired of  the world. Tired of believing only to be proved wrong. Brandy I know ‘m not wrong about her Carmen I know she’s a great person Sofia….gret in everyway  as well. So these three people are gonna have to carry me on through atleast another year. I’m weaker and more vulnerable than ever before. I’m tired of people dropping by for a month and fucking me up. It’s war upon humans now, and I can’t lsoe if I close up I was gonna wait till CP to do that…but it starts now. Thank you Meily….for being my inspiration behind this cause

      Well i followed brandy's advice opened up to Meily, and thanks to that shit fuck advice, she got pissed at me, then she calmed down and now we started talking and   " i love you, there is no question about that. but i cant love you completely while he is still in my heart" and "you have part of me, he has the other"  so i'm on suicidally depressed, while being a prick mode...so if i rip your head off and gouge your eyeballs, then eat them , sorry, i'm just being me.

      Wrote some more....this is my DArk Age in writing i've noticed....  I curse forgotten foreign worlds Evil landscapes of my mind Black horrors that I dread Fantastic to mankind One thousand fates await me Each points towards doom My sleep grows deep and lifeless The aching void looms Spirals of thorns shred my eyes War-gredy weapons unsheathed Sanguinary way -blinded path Congealing misfortunes decreed he who enters the blackness Shall soon not know what may be Nightmarish foreshadows- the future Abolish what nyctophobia pleads  A plague of dreams and visions That haunt (and lurk in) my mind Beneath the shroud of darkness These shadows come alive  Indeed I cannot escape this This pestilent torment of dreams My torturous sleep is imprisonment I moan an echoing scream...  Infectious fear It fabricates Weaves itself It procreates Cruel clutching strands It permeates Webs of Perdition One dreams the fate  Webs of Perdition One dreams the fate Webs of Perdition Asphyxiate  A face transfixed with horror Macabre is the weird A futile glimpse towards infinity Black thoughts- nightmare revealed This bedside shall be my resting place To capitulate toward the dark I gather the black in my eyes The rattle of death departs...

      hasnt been long at all since i last wrote but yet this is where my thoughts come out the clearest and most genuine.  sometimes.. i feel like.. BLAH. that's exactly how i feel sometimes. what do i mean by i feel BLAH? i'm sure you know that feeling. its definitely undescribable. the simplest (and only) way i can put it is in terms of BLAH-ness. i'm not very good with slang & etc. so dont mind me much. i think its also known as JADED. can't be too sure though you know? well let me see. i guess i can start by explain what BLAH is to me. well, it's when i feel not happy but not sad. i dont feel good but i dont feel bad either. i dont feel like dying but i dont feel like living. its right smack in the middle of all the opposites. the only way i can think of saying that is BLAH. like i'm sick of everything and there's nothing.. NOTHING i can do about it. it sucks QUITE a bit but hey.. what can i say? well anyways..   sports bum 55: i'm so very tired of life, that i've given up on it sports bum 55: i've decided i'll just go through the motions sports bum 55: and whatever happens happens  i dont feel like writing right now cause i'm sleepy. so maybe tomorrow   meily has officially given me a hella worry

      back! got home at 11:30:22  tonight, i'm gonna start by saying " it's good to have no attention, nothing is expected of you   Next i'll apologize to Meily....i did not call her today (i emailed)  Here's the whole reason why we went to orlando and i did call.... my parents are looking for houses.   In the end we bought some room at a Wyndham Resort it's gonna cost us over 13 grand or so but we can exhange the home one in orlando for anyone in the world because orlando's a hot spot, and it's great...it's 2 miles off of walt disney World and shit....so we were there till about 12 then to Sea world till 7, got on the bus FROM sea world and busted home....  So Meily, i read what you wrote and i really hope it's not written towards me. I love you princess. And Again we have to talk, not paranoia, this time it's just me having 50 year old memory lane moments  Anywho got to da place at about 9 in da mornin, checked in to Disney's Contemporary Resort and ate breakfast, this is why i want my kids to go to a disney resort, there, the breakfast, disney characters showed up and we had some blonde haired, blue eyed british 7 year old chick in fron of us going "LOOK MOMMY IT'S MINNIE! CAN I TAKE A PICTURE,PLEEEEEEAAAAAAASSSSSEEEEE" that's what i love, personally i think Magic kingdom isn't that great, i rather Epcot ( aahhh shut up!)...but for the little kids it's heaven on earth.  Thanks to me listening to Meily, i went on space mountain....that ride is  THE SHIT   Bye i gotta get gone, talk to you all tomorrow, i'm not burned but one more day and i'd be toasted, my neck stings, to a very minor degree but i'm cool... another thing, at Islands of Adventure on the first day at aoround 10, two little kids, no mroe than 6, see me as i'm about to get on the ride (that thing where Meily and her friends forced me to go, Dudley's some crap...you get soaked...no idea yet huh?, it like drops you)  kid number 1 :" L0ok mommy it's my new friend (staring at me) mother: huh? kid number 2: (to me) HI! YOUR COOL! kids as ride is leaving the gate:  Manchester....UNITED!  i was wearing the jersey, dude, that was the coolest thing since being able to piss in your own toilet (thyey had the blue jerseys on) of course my father ruined the moment by going ARSENAL AND MADRID!...stupid cunt headed shit fuck  So on Day One we went to Universal and from 9-10:30 islands ( went on four rides, no lines) Day Two: "Tire Kingdom" (my father's name for Magic Kingdom) till 7, then Epcot, then back to magic kingdom to see fireworks,  Day three: Buying the resort, condom (condo), thingy and then Sea World (still the coolest shiot in orland'oh!) even if we missed the 9 o' clock show(which Owns0rz j0o!)   On the bus, OMG, i hugged my meily pillow so tight, and i started crying but i had a jacket on so no one saw (cept the meily pillow)...and at Islands...i wanted her there so bad, i almost sat down crying, i've become very vulnerable lately, and that lsot post of hers hurts if it's what i think it's about, but that's ok, i wanted ehr there, to see the familes, how their so together, so close... and at disney i wanted brandy and Meily there, they woulda acted like the 7 year olds, i'm not gonna talk about the depressing moments...if i had gone with a brick wal on my back it would have been better than my parents, you have NO IDEA how bad things are at home for me, i felt like fucking leaving them and going in the parks by myself, they hurt me a lot, they proved a lot of things, anyways i'm going to go to sleep, and BTW, love you baby sis and angel (meily)

      Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary, System manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor, Longing for the warmth of bedsheets, Still I sat there, doing spreadsheets: Having reached the bottom line, I took a floppy from the drawer. Typing with a steady hand, I then invoked the SAVE command But got instead a reprimand: it read "Abort, Retry, Ignore".  Was this some occult illusion? Some maniacal intrusion? These were choices Solomon himself had never faced before. Carefully, I weighed my options. These three seemed to be the top ones. Clearly, I must now adopt one - Choose : "Abort, Retry, Ignore".   With my fingers pale and trembling, Slowly toward the keyboard bending, Longing for a happy ending, hoping all would be restored, Praying for some guarantee Finally I pressed a key -- But on the screen what did I see? Again: "Abort, Retry, Ignore".   I tried to catch the chips off-guard -- I pressed again, but twice as hard. Luck was just not in the cards, I saw what I had seen before. Now I typed in desperation, Trying random comninations. Still there came the incantation - Choose: "Abort, Retry, Ignore".   There I sat, distraught, exhausted, by my own machine accosted; Getting up, I turned away and paced across the office floor. And then I saw an awful sight, A bold and blinding flash of light, A lightning bolt that cut the night and shook me to my very core. The PC screen collapsed and died, "Oh no -- my database", I cried. I thought I heard a voice reply, "You'll see your data -- Nevermore!"   To this day I do not know The place to which our data goes Perhaps it goes to Heaven where the angels have it stored. But as for productivity - well, I fear that it goes straight to Hell. And that's the tale I have to tell - Your choice: Abort, Retry, Ignore.

       "It's like a scary version of Kiss" - Slipknot are THE noise of the new millennium and what better way to celebrate by forming your own tribute band. Don't put too much effort into it as by following these easy steps world domination will be yours.   1) Wear frankly ridiculous masks that are far more attractive than your own features complimented with a contrived stage uniform. Choose boiler suits - they are cheap and require minimum effort.  2) Recruit as many friends as your have - nine should do. In case you fall short, grab unsuspecting victims off the street. And of course, musical ability is inessential.  3) It doesn't matter if you can't play guitar, as the sound will be tinny and unrecognisable anyway. If you can't hear the bassist, all the better.  4) Don't forget to add annoying DJ scratching over the top of said noise. Why? Who cares! The kids will just love it?  5) Play the drums as if you are Animal from The Muppets, a sense of rhythm is not required.  6) Tape approximately four minutes of noise and give it a title. It doesn't matter if you cannot reproduce the noise onstage, as fans will be too overpowered by your "madcap" live show to realise.  7) Most important rule - get Ross Robinson to produce said noise. Why not jump on the bandwagon as everything Mr Robinson does is hailed as a masterpiece.  8) Swear constantly throughout interviews and state how F**KING INTENSE everything is (even if you're a nice homeboy really)  9) Make sure onstage entertainment is increased by getting band members to beat each other with some frozen cow heads, just for, you know, sheer delight.  10) Congratulations, you are now Slipknot!   * Mushroomhead were rumoured to have used these tips (or was it the other way round....!)  * Please note: This guide was written back in the year 2000 when Slipknot did carry a dead crow in a jar and bash each other on-stage with cow heads (fact). The band do not do this anymore! Also, Joey is a decent drummer, regardless of this guide ;)  )______________________________________________________________________________________  131 Ways To Tell You're A Mallcore Kid     1.

You never experienced the torture of "Headbangers' Ball" - sitting through 2 hours and 50 minutes of White Lion, Extreme, Enuff Z Nuff and Poison to see a Kreator video.  43. You think Kid Rock is the first person to combine rap with "heavy" guitars.  44. You actually like Staind. Enough to buy it on CD. Enough to see them live.

You say you hate the government yet can't name more than five people who actually work in the government, and one of those people is your aunt Irene that works at the DMV.  46. You don't find this rant amusing in the slightest. 47. You think your backpack goes nicely with your backwards baseball cap.  48. You think that the pictures of Coal Chamber are not at all silly, goofy, ugly, or stupid. In fact, you think at least one of the band members is really hot - even in these clothes.

You wear a red baseball cap that's somewhat furry.  60. You look like Eminem and actually think he's kEwL.  61. You know every lyric to all of Eminem's albums.  62. Before the Black Album got huge, you called Metallica "worship-Satan, kill-your-mother, rape-your-sister shit."  63. Hot Topic, Aeropostale and Gadzooks meet all of your clothing needs. (That's absically all of you) 64. You actually think Kid Rock is worth your spending money on.  65. When somebody mentions metal, you think Papa Roach instead of Motorhead.  66. You've heard real metal and you don't like it.  67. You refuse to acknowledge the fact that Slipknot's masks are just gimmicks.  68. You think Limp Bizkit and Crazy Town are "tight."  69. You call death metal boring but you've never actually listened to a death metal band.  70. You get confused in the metal chatroom as to why most people there are "dissing" your favorite band.  71. You've sent hatemail to webmasters of anti-mall metal sites(with bad grammar and obscene language, of course).  72. You dress in a gothic way, listen to stuff such as Marilyn Manson and Korn but have the nerve to call yourself a non-conformist.  73.

Your closet is full of Jncos and Korn/Slipknot/Mudvayne shirts, all with bleach stains and holes and fringed ends. 87. Your idea of a heavy guitar sound is an Ibanez RG7 tuned to Z flat. 88.

You say "y'all." 108. You think Tool is talented because they sound different from other mallcore bands. 109. Whenever your parents or other adults are around, you cough to hide the obscenities when you have a Korn CD on. 110.

When someone mentions Hellhammer, you think of the drummer of Kovenant. 122. Your only use for vinyl records is as a frisbee. 123. You like Primus, but don't know who Possessed were. 124. You would cream yourself if Ozzy autographed your copy of the Reunion CD. 125. You say anything you don't listen to must suck. 126. You think Ozzy is the godfather of all metal. 127. You think Brave New World is the best Maiden album.  128. You think "666" is a Satanic symbol.  129. You obstinately deny the influence of rap in mallcore even though many of them claim rap influence. 130. You've never heard 80s Sepultura. 131. Last, but not least the first time you hear of Meshuggah is when they play Ozzfest this summer.  __________________________________________ OK, I don't want to confirm whether or not the following e-mail was actually sent by the band addressing this guide and all the negative comments in "Feedback" section, so you have to decide for yourself.  I will certainly have to admit that a lot of you have some (sic) assed opinions about some crazy bands.  1. Anyone who ridicules a band by using an incorrect word (IE: slipknot fukkin sux) is incredibly ignorant and should seriously look up on getting a higher education.  2. Anyone who ridicules a band and doesn't have a thing to back their shit up (real facts and opinions), then you seriously need to read my recommended advise on #1!!  3. SOAD do not have lyrics in which over half of them are "ginuwinely" (correct spelling would be GENUINELY) non-sense. I respect SOAD mostly for their anti-war thinking! GOOD FOR THEM!  4. Knocking Slipknot, eh? Wow! That's a tough one! I didn't know it was even possible. Slipknot is one of those rare popular bands out there who actually have original sounds, looks, lyircs, attitudes, and they plain just don't give a shit who judges them, to be quite honest.I LOVE Slipknot for what/who they are! You need to recognize that knocking a band is NOT going to make them disappear, but it will piss you off in the end b/c all you are doing is wasting your pitiful a pathetic breath on your opinion which in no way is relevant to anything about a band. It is of non-importance, and your opinion shall stay that way.  5. Joey "1" Jordison - Slipkot's (sic) and excellent drummer. Who the hell said Joey has no talent, speed, or rythm? I would like to meet you and slap you with the harsh and cruel terms of reality! Wake up, my friend. Joey will never ever be beaten by ANY drummer in ANY band! EVER! My dad (you know how parents are) absolutely despises the music I listen to! I don't understand it, but, hey. . . I accept it. HOWEVER, he has told me - my dad is a drummer himself - that he has never seen a better drummer, or faster, than Joey 1" Jordison. This is coming from a guy who doesn't even like the band. I do reckon that is saying a lot!  5. For those of you who can defend your favorite band, and do it constructively and maturely without any name calling or mud-slinging, I respect you to the nth degree! It is more interesting to hear someone who may not like Slipknot, but explains in their own opinions why in a calm and collective way, than hearing someone say "nu-metal sux ass, and slipknot fukkin sux too"!  6. To the dude that made this "humor" section of the website. Bro, I am telling this to you as a friend to friend situation. In no way do I intend to criticise you in any way. This site was funny for about the first three paragraphs, then it went too far and it did get offensive. I found it quite offensive, but I am not having a conniption fit over it like most people would. I realize that you have warned us in advance to viewing the site that it was to be taken "in light of", but a lot of true fans are not going to sit there and laugh at the list, when it may pertain in a negative perception to their band. It just isn't funny, and I am just advising you to take a second thought on keeping this part of the site up. However, it's your choice.  I end with the note that I wish all my fellow maggots stay (sic), and may the 'Knot be your influence at all times! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Understand this: This has never been a popularity contest. The people we care for and work with know who they are and how we feel about them. Slipknot has never been into name-dropping. So, we dedicate this album to the ones that matter the most, our crazy fans and maggots all over the world. Stay (sic), fuckers!  - Slipknot (Iowa)

      hey i'm d.k. blog this so my posts may be shorter from now on love you kathy!  http://innergeek.us/geek.html- I am 37.27811% - Major Geek   ______________________________________________________ he cameras are already in place. The computer code is being developed at a dozen or more major companies and universities. And the trial runs have already been planned.   Everything is set for a new Pentagon program to become perhaps the federal government's widest reaching, most invasive mechanism yet for keeping us all under watch. Not in the far-off, dystopian future. But here, and soon.   The military is scheduled to issue contracts for Combat Zones That See, or CTS, as early as September. The first demonstration should take place before next summer, according to a spokesperson. Approach a checkpoint at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, during the test and CTS will spot you. Turn the wheel on this sprawling, 8,656-acre army encampment, and CTS will record your action. Your face and license plate will likely be matched to those on terrorist watch lists. Make a move considered suspicious, and CTS will instantly report you to the authorities.   Fort Belvoir is only the beginning for CTS. Its architects at the Pentagon say it will help protect our troops in cities like Baghdad, where for the past few weeks fleeting attackers have been picking off American fighters in ones and twos. But defense experts believe the surveillance effort has a second, more sinister, purpose: to keep entire cities under an omnipresent, unblinking eye.   This isn't some science fiction nightmare. Far from it. CTS depends on parts you could get, in a pinch, at Kmart.   "There's almost a 100 percent chance that it will work," said Jim Lewis, who heads the Technology and Public Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, "because it's just connecting things that already exist."   As currently configured, the old-line cameras speckled throughout every major city aren't that much of a privacy concern. Yes, there are lenses everywhere—several thousand just in Manhattan. But they see so much, it's almost impossible for snoops to sift through all the footage and find what's important.   CTS would coordinate the cameras, gathering their views in a single information storehouse. The goal, according to a recent Pentagon presentation to defense contractors, is to "track everything that moves."   "This gives the U.S. government capabilities Big Brother only pretended to have," said John Pike, director of Globalsecurity.org, a defense think tank. "Before, we said Big Brother's watching. But he really wasn't, because there was too much to watch."   CTS could help soldiers spot dangers as they navigate perilous urban areas, Pentagon researchers insist. That's not how defense analysts like Pike see it. The program "seems to have more to do with domestic surveillance than a foreign battlefield," he said, "and more to do with the Department of Homeland Security than the Department of Defense."   "Right now, this may be a military program," added Lewis. "But when it gets up and running, there's going to be a huge temptation to apply it to policing at home"—to keep tabs on ordinary citizens, whether or not they've done something wrong.     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Traditionally, the authorities have collected information only on people who might be connected to a crime. If there was a murder in the East Village, the cops didn't bring in all of St. Mark's Place; they interrogated only the people who might have information about the killer. Even the most extreme abuses of law enforcement power—like J. Edgar Hoover's domestic spying on political activists—homed in on very specific individuals, or groups, that he imagined as threats to the state. He didn't put the whole state under watch.   September 11 changed that. Now, the idea is to find out as much as possible about as many people as possible. After all, the logic goes, the country can't afford to sit back and wait to be attacked. Almost anyone could play a part in a terrorist plot. So the government has to keep tabs on almost everyone.   CTS, a $12 million, three-year program, is emerging as a potential centerpiece of that initiative.   "Before, it was 'let's catch the bad guys and bring them to trial after stuff happens,' " Lewis said. "Now it's 'let's look for patterns and stop [an attack] before it happens.' "   That's why Attorney General John Ashcroft pushed for a program to turn a million civilians into citizen-spies, snooping on their neighbors. That's why the USA Patriot Act now allows for wiretaps without warrants. And it's why the Pentagon has begun researching an array of high-tech tools to pry into average people's lives.   CTS is the brainchild of DARPA, the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. That's the group of minds behind the notoriously invasive Total (sorry, "Terrorism") Information Awareness über-database. TIA's backers say the project will be carefully targeted, but privacy advocates say it could compile in a single place an unprecedented amount of information about you—your school transcripts, medical records, credit card bills, e-mail, and so much more.   "LifeLog," currently in the early planning stage at DARPA, would twist all these bits into narrative "threads," giving officials a chance to watch events develop. Along the way, LifeLog's developers would like to capture the name of every TV show you watch, every magazine you read.   Still, watching your data trail just isn't the same as actually watching your physical tail. You can change your e-mail address, and start paying cash. But you can't run away from yourself. And that's the missing piece CTS could provide—an almost instant ability to track, moment by moment, where you are and what you're doing.   "Before, there was a reasonable expectation of privacy when you were walking down the street," Lewis said. "Now that's something that will have to be adjusted."   That's not all that will change. As everybody who's ever mugged for the camera knows, people act differently when they're being watched.   Sometimes, that's not such a bad thing. Web-surfing habits are monitored on the job, so you wait until you're home to download porn. On the street, you can be a little less skittish, knowing your neighbors, your beat cops, your corner store owners are keeping an eye on you.   But being watched by a faceless, inaccessible government minder, that's something altogether different.   In 1791, the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham proposed a jail, circular in shape. The warden would sit in a dark observation booth in the middle; the prisoners would sit in well-lit, inward-facing cells along the circumference. Under the constant threat of being watched, the jailed would change their behavior, Bentham theorized, bending their activities to the warden's rules.   Two centuries later, England has 2.5 million security cameras spread throughout the country, by some estimates. Several cities, like the port town of King's Lynn, are covered by the lenses.   "It's exactly what Bentham predicted," said Simon Davies, director of Privacy International, a British civil liberties group. "The kids there are giving up going onto the street. They say it's almost like being in a glass-paneled room, with their parents on the other side. They're forced into smaller and smaller areas so they can be kids in private."   Putting people under electronic watch induces a kind of split personality, said Bill Brown, who leads tours of Manhattan's spy cams as part of his duties with the Surveillance Camera Players. The authorities want people to obey the law, to behave rationally. But video surveillance does the exact opposite. It makes people feel—correctly—like they're constantly being watched, like they're paranoid.   "And that's not a rational state at all," Brown said. "It's a mental condition."     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Stalin and Saddam did their best. They tried hard to keep under surveillance as many of their citizens as they could. But these efforts could never succeed completely. There was always a "fundamental barrier—the ratio of watchers to the watched," said John Pike of Globalsecurity.org.   "You couldn't have everybody working for the secret police," he continued. "The thing that's so singularly seductive about automatic video surveillance is that it breaks that fundamental barrier down."   CTS will keep watch by equipping each camera with a processor, like the one in your computer. The chips will have programmed into them "video understanding algorithms" that can distinguish one car from another. At each checkpoint, the car's speed, time of arrival, color, size, license plate, and shape are all instantly passed on to a central server. If the early tests identifying cars go well, software that recognizes a person's face and style of walk could also be added.   By sharing only this refined data—instead of the raw video itself—CTS should keep fragile computer networks from becoming overloaded with hours and hours of meaningless footage. Everybody knows how much of a pain it can be to get a video clip in your e-mail inbox, instead of a simple text message. Now imagine how much worse the problem would get if thousands and thousands of such clips were being sent back and forth, all day, every day. CTS would help government networks avoid that burden, with each camera transmitting a mere 8 kilobits per second, instead of the 200 or so kilobits needed for high-resolution video.   CTS would also keep the snoops who stare at the monitors from being overwhelmed. "We have enough cameras, but not enough people to watch the video feeds," said Tom Strat, who's heading up CTS for DARPA's Information Exploitation Office.   If all's well, CTS cameras might send back to headquarters only basic data or the occasional low-resolution image. But when there's something fishy going down—like a car speeding away unexpectedly, or a briefcase left in a train station—the images could come sharper, and more quickly. Proto-CTS programs from contractors Northrop Grumman and the Sarnoff Corporation would interrupt the gray monotony of surveillance footage, setting red boxes aflash around the suspect person or object.   "It focuses your attention right there," said Bruce De Witte of Northrop.     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   But CTS would do more than change what investigators see. It would also give them a record of everything that happens in a city's public places, potential evidence for prosecutors and terrorist hunters.   In its presentation to industry, DARPA said it wanted CTS to be able to find the common threads between a shooting at a bus stop one month and a bombing at a disco the next.   In theory, CTS could take an inventory of all of the cars around the bus stop and near the disco immediately before and after the incidents. Then it could examine where those cars went, to see if there were any vehicles in common—or if a car acted as a sort of messenger between two others.   The forensic process could be further enhanced by one of DARPA's analysis programs, like LifeLog or Total Information Awareness. After mining license plate numbers from the footage, investigators could identify the car owners. And then dig into the owners' Web-surfing trails, to see if there were any visits to explosive-making sites. And scan e-mail accounts for virulent language. And plumb credit card receipts for big fertilizer purchases.   To the uninitiated, storing and sharing all this information might seem like insurmountably complex tasks. And according to Strat, the CTS manager, the ability to network surveillance cameras over a wide area is "not right around the corner."   Defense and technology analysts have a different view.   "(CTS) is pretty creepy. And the creepiest part about it is that it's not all that sophisticated," said Lee Tien, a senior staff attorney with the privacy-rights proponent Electronic Frontier Foundation.   DARPA has mandated that the CTS demonstrations be done only with readily available, "off the shelf" equipment—the kind of stuff you could get at Spyville.com. You could find slightly less diesel versions of the gear at Amazon.com.   So getting the cameras will be easy. What may be harder is handing off information—a description of a suspicious vehicle, say—from one camera to the next. These lenses will be separated by hundreds, even thousands, of meters. And "appearances can change dramatically" in those distances, Johns Hopkins University senior research scientist Chris Diehl said. Slight variations in light or in the camera's angle can make a car look very different to a mechanical eye. "If you read the literature, there really isn't a proven method" for solving this problem, he said.   Yet this obstacle seems surmountable. In a CTS simulation conducted by software developer Alphatech, a car could be tracked over 10 kilometers with accuracy of 90 percent or better with cameras placed 400 meters apart. The percentage went up, of course, as the cameras moved closer together.     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   CTS is but one of an array of private and public sector programs to sort through the ever expanding amount of surveillance imagery. University of California at San Diego's Computer Vision and Robotics Research lab just received a $600,000 grant from a Defense Department counterterror group for a CTS-like project. At Los Alamos National Laboratory, Stephen Brumby is using genetic algorithms—programs that are bred from smaller components of code—to automatically analyze satellite pictures.   At the Sarnoff Corporation, a project dubbed Video Flashlight would morph cameras' views into a single three-dimensional model. Using a joystick, a security officer could maneuver through this simulated world as though playing a game of Half Life or Grand Theft Auto.   In order for Video Flashlight to work, however, it would have to use stationary cameras. CTS doesn't have that limitation; it's supposed to function with drones and other battlefield sensors. That's one of the reasons Globalsecurity.org's John Pike thinks the program could have a legitimate military function—"to the extent that it is relevant to urban operations, as opposed to the running of a well-oiled police state."   Combat in cities "tends to quickly degenerate into small firefights," Pike explained. It's a lot harder to know what's happening in a crowded city than it is in an open desert. Radios cut out quicker; drones and satellites have a harder time peering through the concrete canyons and narrow passageways of urban life. CTS could restore some of that sight, giving U.S. generals a "broader situational awareness."   This assumes, of course, that CTS has anything to do with urban combat. If it does, it'd be a surprise to some of the businesses bidding for the CTS contract.   "The primary application is for homeland security," said Tom Lento, a spokesman for the Sarnoff Corporation.   "The whole theme here is homeland security," added Northrop Grumman's De Witte.   Strat disagreed. "DARPA's mission is not to do homeland security," he said.   In a presentation to industry, DARPA noted, "CTS technology will be demonstrated only within the observable boundaries of government installations where video surveillance is expressly permitted, and operational deployment areas outside the United States where it is consistent with all local laws."   But in an interview, Strat did admit that "there's a chance that some of this technology might work its way" into domestic surveillance programs.   In the test at Fort Belvoir this year the aim is to track 90 percent of all of cars within the target area for any given 30-minute period. The paths of 1 million vehicles should be stored and retrievable within three seconds. A year after that, CTS is supposed to move on to testing in an urban combat setting, where it will gather information from 100 mobile sensors, like drone spy planes and "video ropes" containing dozens of tiny cameras.   Shortly thereafter, CTS could be keeping tabs on a city near you.   "This is coming whether we like it or not," said Jim Lewis, with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It's not how do we stop the tidal wave. It's how do we manage it."     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- my comic of the year:  http://workingforchange.speedera.net/www.workingforchange.com/webgraphics/wfc/TMW030630.gif

      i got home expecting my inbox to say this "BYE" form meily..and it came true....but it wasn't the type of bye i expected...i expected a break up letter, let's jsut say that wasn't what i got, i have about a million things to say and i got all my paranoia back....but this is all i'm saying for now...i'm angry. i'm very angry. and i'm hurt. because she didn't have the balls (guts) to go and tell me the truth straight out. no she came up with a zillion bullshit lies, excuses, and she's playing games, and now i don't know what to do...but you know what i'm fucked up the ass either way and why's that? because i fucking love her, and it'd kill me to see her go.  So Meily, if you want to we can stay together, because i'm willing to....but right now you lost a whole lot of trust. You know, or atleast i hope you do, that you could have told me the damned truth, and you know what the saddest part or thing is? that i knew basic. exactly what was going on, and actually i was about to tell my baby sister last night you two were prolly dating.  that fucking makes me so damn angry, honey, tell me the truth, always, as i would and as i DO. Not some cockamanie bullshit lies.  and one last question exactly what did he do that made you "Realize" this?  i'm not sure whether i'm the rebound or whether i'm a new one....i know i'll never match up to him, but damnit i'm gonna try if you let me...but it's always and all up to you...night to all, and Sofy, don't you   EVER   invite me to the mall again...unless i can take someone (a la carmen)

      alright i've puked so much today i feel sick, carmen jsut went all mush wushy including the ever lating "Franco: you annoying twerp!!! my little brother! though we had a strange beginning, kinda rough too ... u kinda grew on me... and when i say i heart u as my little brother , believe it !!! You've become part of my life. And i know im a bitch, please know i dont mean it! its just my fucked up personality"  At this time last year i was really happy after being in Hell. I was about to  see brandy EVERY day of the year and still treat her like a bitch, despite the fact she was sweet to me. At this time last year i knew 4 (4 people from doral, Melisa, Soraya, Itzame (wazzaaaaaaaa), and Macarena. Well no, know i was in a beach, with sofia (sexah!), Laura (nerdah!)  from doral. I saw one sentence to both of them to sofia " do you liek have to flirt with every guy here!?" to laura after she had told me to omve my fatass: Waht the hell is wrong with you, bitch. yep fond memories  (edit)I just figured something out....i've been dying to meet the right girl, you knwo what i really ened though? i need hang out friends..i need some of those let's go to the movies and throw popcorn at people friends.....i need let's go to the fair and poke each other friends...i need a brandy at Cp.... i need to find someone like her whom i can trust about anything, because unless God serves me some sort of miracle, then...i'm not gonna have brandy around much longer....maybe a year or two, and i'm really carrying emotional baggage, so many times i've wanted to open up to ehr carmen or sofy, and haen't been able to so many times i've wanted to cry but i wouldn't let myself, i need someone, who can listen and help, and those poeple are called friends....  At thsi time last year, i was in comeplete love, slowly preparing for the bombshell explosion that would occur, my best friends were Franco (cervera)(no not some beer)soraya, Joanna, dear old unrusty Ps2, my computer, and Kazaa. I didn't have cell fone. I was hated by all at Ruben except brandy and Gary ( el gringonian!) I was replaying Highway to Hell by Ac/Dc and i was basically friendless, i was hapyp because fo Soraya, i had scars that hadn't gone away ( and many that never will)  I was a pathetic human, my knowledge extended only to HTML I was 110 percent into Dolphins/Canes ( now jsut 105, Manchester United) My idea of Family was Alonzo Mourning (traitor), Dan Marino (god), and a football.... My biggest concern was whether Fiedler was good enough to be a starting qb for the fins.  Well life flipped, brandy's now my life and joy, my one source of pride, we talk like idiots (still) and we're cool like that, and she's proven to understand, and i basically wouldn't be alive if not for ehr ( um thanks?)**huggy and kiss on forehead/cheek**  i have this stupid wife now, called sofia whom i love and adore, who has me constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown, but hey what the hell, her smile brightens my day, and she's got an incredible personality which makes you awnna protect her from ANYthing that may ever hurt her. and she's still the most beautiful woman on thsi planet.  There's some other big sister of mine called Carmen. now i don't know much about her other than, she's nice, she's not cool around PMS time, she's sexah! (it's a sis thing apparently), she's a party person, and i have to look out for her. I'm gonna start believeing she loves her lil bro when we're at CP. Maybe. If she decides to hang wit da losah known as franco(h shit it's ugly)!. I loev her, she's fantastically funny, smart and crazy, and overall a perfect sis, including humiliating me as much as possible  There's my other big sis Kathy, whom is hilarious, cool and thanks to her web cam is confirmed to look gorgeous in a dress, has a little sister that's adorable, is really coool overall.  There's meily, an Ex who has a ton of charm and is quite funny, is extremely intelligent  and then there's my favorite person on earth, brandy....wait fuck man i already wrote about her  anyways, i think love is real and exists, it's a piece of shit mostly, but it'll pay off, someday, jsut not for me, and and..i was going somewheer with this..FUCKING COMMECIALS!....you gelling, like a fellon! well now that my mental "prowess (think marshmellows) has been derailed, let em go do my traditions, Fifa (2000-2003) Madden (1996-2003 LONG LIVE THE KING)   anyways top ten hate list of countries let's go! 10.France Sounds like Franco, and has arrogant people   9. Spain  Just for being the home of Real Madrid, and for being were the Traitor (becks) went to, and cause this will surely annoy carmen   8. Iraq  Our soldiers are dying over there for no reason, well ok, i hear the got great poppys over there, can't live without our Soon-To-Be Heroin!   7. Puerto Rico  for having a shitty name, people who think R's are L's (like my mother, but that's jsut on headsets) and for having serious dental issues   6. Canada  Ok, they have nice, sweet, great people. I used to live, there, kill that motion, made it legal for homosexual marriages, that automatically gets you on my hate list, and for having funky bacon.   5. Malaysia   Because they are the definition of dumbasses, their inhabitants smoke more than breathe, their women are shite, and the smell funny.   4. Mexico  Where to fucking start?!ok let's see, they call everything La Revancha...they have a stereotypes which has been furtherly degraded latins (borrachos come mierdas...that's the stereotype) are imbecolic in their arguments, are too involved with their film stars ( man Jenna Jameson would be royalty..oh wait porn...ok nevermond..), and their too religious   3.Brazil   Ok, they have teeth that only horses comapre with, their all black, they talk a spanish that would make any gringo look good (our pres. is not inc.) and their portugese is fucked up. The women are gorgeous and the men had the whole ugly forest fall on them, their arrogant asswipes, they believe they have a right to be loved and adored, their so passionaet about soccer, they can't argue correctly...for example... me to my friend : i believe real madrid are the best team in the world, even without their  brazilieros  their better than the  verde-amarelho  and she went into denial mode....and if you want to see what all brazilians hold as their God go look at Ronaldinho.....but i'm warning you it amy cause facial paralysis.   2.Cuba  well brandy,Odie,Meily, Kathy are sharpening their knives, but the honest truth is that any country who sees Celia cruz as a godess ( puerto rico borrowed her sadly enough), who destroys the town ( elian anyone!?) when law and justice previaled ( i wanted him to stay, but legally it was RIGHT) and who eat as much shit (like me) in gen. should be number 1 right?! nope despite the fact that only the cubans in miami despise Castro, that they think like the Beverly Hillbillies (the 60+ year old ones) that they smoke cigars thatmake me turn ten shades of green and purple, and that's just the smell that sticks to them. Their all  chusmas  if their over 40 and housewives. the positives, a beautiful country, ruined by poverty (fidel i'm looking at you, no not that way man back off) and the women are up to about 22 years old dead gorgeous ( odie in a dress is the exception-forever)   1. USA  Ladies and gnetlemen, i'mma say like 2 words: George Bush. New York....nuff said _________________________________________________________________ Top 10 Drinking Symptoms  SYMPTOM: Drinking fails to give taste and satisfaction, beer is unusually pale and clear.

      Lately as i feel more disconnected from people than ever the knife's loking like a salvation tool, and that's NEVER a good sign.  that said i've had enough. i feel so fucking lonely, the one person that i know would be the one to help me through everything isn't in the same fucking state, the other one that more than likely could cheer me up isn't in this continent, and then there's sofia, who even when i try to to her things they don't get through to her, the last two nights i've gone to sleep listening over and over to this song......it's been my best friend lately...you guys know it too ___________________  I will never bother you  I will never promise to  I will never follow you  I will never bother you     Never speak a word again  I will crawl away for good     I will move away from here   You won't be afraid of fear  No thought was put in to this   I always knew it would come to this  Things have never been so swell  I have never failed to fail     Pain (x3) You know you're right (x3)   I'm so warm and calm inside  I no longer have to hide  Let's talk about someone else  Steaming soup against her mouth  Nothing really bothers her  She just wants to love herself   I will move away from here  You won't be afraid of fear  No thought was put into this  I always knew to come like this   Things have never been so swell  I have never failed to fail    Pain (x5) You know you're right (x17)  Pain

      ok well last night i went ot bed crying for the third night in a row. this time it was mostly due to some things brandy said, which kept echoing in my head well, w.e., she opened up to me and i thank God for that, it was about time. Love you baby sis, and um, Carmen, preparate! And Brandy baby sis, you can call me tonight!  ____________________________________________ edit! ____ i wrote something that i really like because it sucks but it's from the heart, not mushy shit,but w.e.....first off i want to post a song that let's you know how i feel __________________________  NIN-Hurt  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel I focus on the pain the only thing that's real the needle tears a hole the old familiar sting try to kill it all away but I remember everything what have I become? my sweetest friend everyone I know goes away in the end you could have it all my empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear my crown of shit on my liar's chair full of broken thoughts I cannot repair beneath the stain of time the feeling disappears you are someone else I am still right here what have I become? my sweetest friend everyone I know goes away in the end you could have it all my empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt if I could start again a million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way ____________________  "if you say you want to kill me inside your just a fucking liar everything inside me's already dead!"  I wish i could move away from here, alone maybe, perhaps with someone, Where i no longer have to hide in fear,  Where i no longer ahve to shed another tear I wish the pain from so many things  Rrom so many angles From so many places of loss  Would jsut leave.  I need someone to love me I need someone who won't turn their back on me. Need someone who won't attack me I need someone to tell me everythings gonna be fine again. I need a world in which i'm ok. I need a life and soul. I have failed all my goals  I shall die in peace, all alone My seat is freezing  The world is sleeping  As i turn slowly numb Is it truly me who's dumb Now that i found someone,  I feel all the more alone Than i ever have before I feel this damned fear of uncertainty stinging clear thorugh all my body, and mind So I cant help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer So far it has me beat To life i appeal Have you not hurt me nearly enough? Have your tentacles of hate and vulgarious death not risen? Is there a greater pain than one being terrified but by himslef? I need someone to reach down in their heart and pull out some hope for me they say nothing lasts forever even cold november rain then why is it pouring on me everyday? I feel like a ghost no one can do anything but laugh and snicker at Feel like no one relly notices me except as an impediment I've dodge their slings and arrows, misses , So damn narrow, But if they missed why do i feel shot? I'm not asking for pity and absolution, Before you come to a conclusion, just try to walk in my shoes I know you'll stumble in my footsteps, Be like me and bumble at the doorstep Fumble at the one yard line And in my life i need an addiction, to someone hooked on me What i need Is a fairy tale ending To compensate For all the shit life threw at me For all the times i fucked up For being a pain in the ass For causing pain nearly as much as i recieved it I can't be fixed But hopefully my life can and will Hopefully times will change,  And a sunny day of perfection Will allow me to show my affection

      I, I've been lonely And I, I've been blind And I, I've learned nothing So my hands are firmly tied To the sinking leadweight of failure  I've worked hard all my life Money slips through my hands My face in the mirror tells me It's no surprise that I'm Pushing the stone up the hill of failure  They tempt me with violence They punish me with ideals And they crush me with an image of my life that's nothing but unreal Except on the goddamned slaveship of failure  I'll drown here trying to get up for some air But each time I think I breathe I'm laid on with a double share of the punishing burden of failure  I don't deserve to be down here But I'll never leave And I've learned one thing You can't escape the beast In the null and void pit of failure  When I get my hands on some money I'll kiss it's green skin And I'll ask it's dirty face 'Where the hell have you been?' 'I am the fuel that fires the engine of failure.'  I'll be old and broken down I'll forget who and where I am I'll be senile or forgotten But I'll remember and understand You can bank your hard-earned money on failure  I saw my father crying I saw my mother break her hand On a wall that wouldn't weep But that certainly held in The mechanical moans of a dying man Who was a failure  My back hurts me when I bend Because I carry a load My brain hurts me like a knife-hole Because I've yet to be shown How to pull myself out from The sucking quicksand of failure  Some people live in hell Many bastards succeed But I, I've learned nothing I can't even elegantly bleed Out the poison blood of failure

      it's apparently the let's make franco a suicidal machine member time of the year. Well, Brandy called yesterday and i was crying to much to actually pick up the phone and i do regret that... i guess her owing me 2 nights is down to a night. i'll tell selected few why....  Monday was the franco is worth shit day.  and today was let's drop a bomb on franco day. I may not be going to CP. I may be going to DCS. no not A dade county school. Dade Christian School.  It's like the second best in miami, and it's halfway up the arse of hell but my dad wants me to go there because it's a fucking church school. My mothers against it because she'll know it'll make me get revenge and as it is i don't talk to them, today i spent the whole day in my room except to shower and breakfast then went back to the batcave. Man, this is ultra depressing, the good news is that my dads not happy that it's a Baptist school   and i'm roman catholic so for once in my life  THANK YOU RELIGION!  me mum says she doens't care about the religion as long as it's good conflict of interests. lol. why do i dislike this idea? is it because only preppy rich fags go there? no. is it because it's nerdy? it's a reason. then?! I have to take a religion class in which i'd wreck hell, it's a privy school meaniing tight rules and i think there all for uncool fools. And if punishment is going to pray a rosary, i'll  be suspended  Religion is great ebcause of Faith and what not but Faith is something i hold in very little amounts nowadays And my faith is divided in 4 things as goes ( i need to make a pie graph or something) 75% Brandy 20% Miami Hurricanes 2.5% Miami Dolphins 2.5% Marlins/Heat  so i'mma have to take an admissions test...i'm gonna get a -100 on it, and that's just for fun:P  sports bum 55: brb the nun, i mean my mom's claling me  http://www.dadechristian.org is the shcools site  sports bum 55: are you kidding me sports bum 55: it's gonna be hilarious sports bum 55: it's gonna be like sports bum 55: jesus said sports bum 55: me WHO GIVES A FUCK! i say i wanna read my book now shut up! sports bum 55: and i have to take religion class sports bum 55: lmao, that's gonna own sports bum 55: i'm gonna question every little bit of crap they throw at me ElvenFairy29: lol sports bum 55: how do we know somebody didn't jsut feel like writing this about some common crook!? sports bum 55: llol sports bum 55: franco caliz- hell bent on being a hell raiser sports bum 55: it's gonna be LG's time three ElvenFairy29: but wait jesus said....but the bible now says... ElvenFairy29: lol ElvenFairy29: daymn sports bum 55: lol sports bum 55: damien sports bum 55: lol ElvenFairy29: they'll call an exorcist ElvenFairy29: lmao sports bum 55: i'm gonna go after school sports bum 55: and like get a tatoo somewhere sports bum 55: 666 sports bum 55: lol sports bum 55: i'm gonna get that tatoo on my arm i've always wanted sports bum 55: smoking skull ElvenFairy29: lol sports bum 55: i'm gonna pierce myself sports bum 55: i'mma take like metallica and Ac/dc shirts (highway to hell!) sports bum 55: lol  and so i have to think of every satanic question i can think of later.

      ok this is the last time i speak on this issue. i've always called new york GAY. i've said they sucked.  Now with this new shcool (supportd by the "great" mayour bloomberg) that's only for lesbians and gays. It's gone beyond sports. it's a PUBLIC SCHOOL. that means you Fireman Ed ( the guy at the Jets games) are paying for a school for transgender,gay, lesbian, bisexual kids. now hold on...that sounds good, it so they don't get picked on. ok, 1) lesson of life you will always be picked on. no matter whether you straight or not.  2)ok, so these kids are the most harrased (and hell ill admit it, i've made jokes toward gay kids, there, call me a bigot, enjoy, i'll admit it.) but then wait! i personally know.....FAT KIDS ARE PICKED ON TOO! so you know what? let's open a school for them too! because it is not just that because we call you  homo, you get your school, and i get called butter ball (my cousin, haha) then i don't get one of my own!  And what about the people (who like ) me, pay taxes and don't agree with thsi school? what if your VERY much against the damn thing because you think it's illogical?!  yes, a school where people aren't called (jes i'm using majourly bad language now, sorry if i offend,not meant to, email me and i'll remove it if you want franco15@msn.com, links to it at end of my post, and bottom of page i believe.) Nigger,Spick,Faggot,  Gay, Wigga (jesus) and such, but you know what, then i'd be called a catholic bitch or something, jews wuold be laughed at because of the lil hat they were (sorry, don't know the name). If not, people again like me fat, acne, have all the musical ability of a dying cat are gonna be teased about that. I could tease about someone wiht less strenght or quickness than me.  it's silly. i say we have a school for gays and les'. for each different religion for fat kids. for kids with acne. for kids who's ass is too big for kids who's arms are a bit balcker than the rest.  coudl you know find a better way to use 3 million dollars a month!?!? If all else fial, give the valecdictorians a trip to Europe. Tell me That wouldn't enocourage a lot of people. Get an appearence by j-lo for them (they guys would rule for the next 3 years min.) Use it for drug awareness programs.  Don't waste the money by classification bcause if you told me that shcool people go directly to havard, then all of a sudden I would become "gay" as well.

      ok three day of total peace and nirvana, and now brandy, and sofia have just set the alarms off majorly, we're back to metallica and nirvana replacing bocelli and BsB  this is as furious shot as i'm gonna take at people in gen. listen to me CAREFULLY, i know listening is hard for you dumbasses but it's worth it. when i give you relationship advice LISTEN AND TAKE IT, IT'S ALWAYS RIGHT, IT'S ALWAYS GOOD, AND ESP. WHEN I KNOW I'M RIGHT. sometimes in life you have to throw feelings to the side, sometimes you have to become determined and brin up a plan for suces you have to be able to get what you want in many different ways.   if your still hung up on some guy that broke your heart, (sofia,brandy,and meily and even to some extent you soraya) GET THE FUCK OVER IT.  stop listening to your evanescence shit please...... your going to become furtherly depressed, you think it's helping you heal and it's just another form of thinking about teh guy and longing for times long gone, and past.  before you call me a sadistically cynically inspired asshole, listen.  how i got over soraya, the manual,  use a rebound, feel bad for the person, but do it, it helps.  listen to songs, that to make you remember the good times, remember the extreme pain you felt when he said bye. when you felt his arrow of pain smite you. Seether is a good starting point, songs that humiliate them do not work!songs that are made to make the person feel bad ( a la' going under) DON'T WORK.  write. let your emotions out.  vent. blow up, call me, bitch me out, bitch the other boy out. point out everything wrong with men, with me, with that guy. with your fathers, anyone that your angry out, let it out, scream, hit and let it take over you for awhile. blow up at a couple of people for no reason, sometimes its ok.  look for someone elese, not somone like them, let it be a guy compleetely against your normal style if you want, but think about it, but please no ghetto kids, i beg of you. and no refs. that's a law. make that person be a friend or something, someone who can help you, and you can help them in the process. and don't immidately look for either the perfect guy or one that makes you gddy happy, because those are the types that hurt yoyu once and they'll hurt you again. sometimes, their right under your nose, the only thing is that you can't see yourself with 'em! their not that bad! and if their nice and intelligent, you make me happy!   ah, intelligence....none o my friends are stupid, and if they are their not close (dynell).  DO NOT GIVE ME YOUR LITTLE BULLSHIT SPEACH ABOUT HE MADE ME SO HAPPY AND THERE'S MORE THAN WHAT MEETS THE EYE.  If he doesn't know what plagarize is, forget it. ex. of stupid to retarded match ups include Brandy with Eric Sofy with tubby and the #1 of all time, Meily with Chris When you start talking and he can't really follow or keep up, when the guy is in reg. and your in gift. i'm sorry, to say, forget it. intelligence has a lot to do with it, if you talk and he can't keep up then your gonna be mad. you'll soon be frustrated. If you too get serious, have jobs and one is in science and he's a garbage man, it looks damn bad, also, you'll run outof things to talk about, quickly.  use friends. they'll understand and try to get ya through, and if they don't know they'll encourage you however they can.  don't date someone that you cna't see yourself wiht in a year, min. if you couldn't dare hsow him to your parents, because they'd hate him, and so would/do i, leave him! don't waste time, what if your with someone, and then that guy comes along, sees you too kissing and leaves for someone else?!!?!?!?!?!!??Try to go into rel. that will last....and you'll be happy.sometimes using your head isn't bad. Long relationship's may end worse than short ones, but you knwo what, atleast they have a meaning to it!  don't date someone who you KNOW may barely leave a week/4 months from now  if you ain't got a chance to go n get married forget it.  and most importantly, don't look for another big one, jes i know there's something inside you that's not there anymore, but don't be a scout girl, don't always be looking around for someone, sometimes, though it hurts, being single is cool, i'm finally finding this out, don't always be looking for HIM....it's ok.  really.  well that said, love you all night. Go FINS!BTw we have 2,015 visitors, but i'm gonna change counter servers, so by ebye 2,015 hello 0.

       Natural Leader:yes or no?    Total  Congratulations, you're a real leader! Your leadership skills are quite strong, so don't be afraid to step up to the plate when problems need solving — you'll do great. You've got a solid combination of positive leadership traits — from organizational skills to communication ability. These talents make you a great resource in the workplace, someone people can look to for guidance and direction. Still, there are a few things you might need to work on. To brush up on the different components of leadership, check out your scores below:   Organization  Let's get it together! Your organizational skills need a little work. Keeping things in the right place means you can move more quickly, making you more efficient and productive at work. So no matter what kind of career you're pursuing, the ability to keep yourself (and your work space) organized lets you spend your time on what's really important — working   Efficiency  Stop spinning your wheels and get in gear! Your efficiency could use a little help. Take some time to really analyze the work process, and learn how to get things done. Basically, you need to work on spending your time wisely — just talking about something doesn't always make it happen. You've got to persevere and focus your effort in the right places. Being more efficient is a tried-and-true way to move forward at work.   Teamwork  Go, team, go! Your sense of teamwork is so strong you're practically out on the field doing cheers. Which is great — the ability to communicate and work closely with others is essential to good leadership. Team-building skills are the foundation of all interactions with your co-workers and can set the tone at work. So give yourself a pat on the back — your talent in this area gives you a real leadership edge.   Confidence  You could use a confidence boost! To move forward at work, it's essential that you be able to take on new roles and responsibilities. When you feel sure of yourself, you can concentrate on the task at hand instead of just worrying about potential failures. Keep all your strengths in mind, and use them to your advantage.

      "some poeple think this guy's a moron and by some peoplei mean everyone, here you go it's Tom Green"  then they fucked up on using him, idiots __________________________________  My dating skills (uh oh)    Etiquette   Although you are probably well-mannered on a first date, based on your responses, you could still afford to polish your etiquette a bit more. You might feel a little too comfortable on first dates, or possibly just too nervous to keep your cool. Being yourself and behaving in a considerate and respectful manner is a surefire way to reveal that you are a confident and classy person.   Sexual   It appears that you are a confident person and you do not feel the need to use your sexuality to get a date. You have probably found subtle ways to show your interest without acting too available, needy or desperate. Chances are that you do not regard sex as a way to manipulate your date into wanting to see you again. If, however, you choose to follow your sexual impulses, you probably do it for the right reasons -- not simply to please your date.    Content   You seem to have found the perfect balance between speaking and listening on a first date. You probably enjoy having a very natural give-and-take dialogue, and you are aware that there should be boundaries regarding how much is appropriate to reveal about yourself at such an early stage of a relationship. Chances are you do not try to please your date by always agreeing with them, and you probably don't take the spotlight off of them by always bringing the attention back to you. Continue to be yourself and you will soon find the right one!

Vern Troyer-Hilarious,adorable  Winner:Vern __________  my shoe type  Ahh, whether reclining poolside with a frosty iced tea or making the Sunday rounds at the neighborhood brunch spot, you're one of the lucky ones. You're like an Easygoing Flip-Flop. You exude a sense of comfort, style, and calm that rubs off on those around you. Sure, you do a good job at work, but when it's time to play, you play (or unwind) hard. People look to you to add color at any social gathering. In short, you mix well with others and don't mind taking it slow to get to the heart of matters. Racing ahead is for other people.

       i ahve cancer?    Brown  You're brown, a credible, stable color that's reminiscent of fine wood, rich leather, and wistful melancholy. Most likely, you're a logical, practical person ruled more by your head than your heart. With your inquisitive mind and insatiable curiosity, you're probably a great problem solver. And you always gather all of the facts before coming to a timely, informed decision. Easily intrigued, you're constantly finding new ways to challenge your mind, whether it's by reading the newspaper, playing a trivia game, or composing a piece of music. Brown is an impartial, neutral color, which means you tend to see the difference between fact and opinion easily and are open to many points of view. Trustworthy and steady, you really are a brown at heart.

       My Theme Song  With your elevated spirit and go-with-the-flow attitude, "All Star" is the theme song for you. It's the tune that you're humming when you decide to hop in your car and spend a weekend somewhere you've never been. And it's the song you blare on auto-repeat when you're getting lost (though you might call it "exploring") in that same new spot. You know life is sweetest when you live it to its fullest. The risks you take usually pay off, from starting your own business to relocating to another town. You aren't afraid to hit the brakes and speed off in a new direction. Your friends may scratch their heads and wonder when you're going to settle down. But you are definitely not your friends. And when exciting opportunities present themselves, "you'll never know if you don't go, you'll never shine if you don't glow." You only get one quarter to play this game, and with "All Star" as your inner beat, you're aiming for high score.  i don't mind

      My Dog self  No bones about it, you're a perky, loving Cocker Spaniel. (Think Lady from Lady and the Tramp.) Playful and energetic,  you're a real people person — er, dog. People can't help but fall hook, line, and sinker for your friendly, well-rounded personality and natural charm.  It's a subtle thing, though — being outgoing and flirtatious, not showy, is the name of your game.  Friends, co-workers, and potential dates can't help liking you. How could they not? Your winning-yet-humble ways make you popular, admired,  and a joy to be around. Woof!     bullshit    Romantic Fantasy  And to think it all started with Adam and Eve. What is it about forbidden love that dominates your Garden of Eden romantic fantasy?   Even if you'd never think of acting on it, it's ok to admit that you've been tempted (at least in your fantasy world) by a relationship that just can't be. Everybody has.   Maybe you've just seen The Graduate a few more times than the rest of your friends and "coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson" holds a little more meaning for you. Or maybe you just enjoy keeping your daydreams separate from your real life when it comes to looking for love.   Of course, it could be, that the naturalist in you is just thirsting for a romantic picnic in a secluded garden with that special someone. We'll let you take it from here...

        If We Must Die  If we must die, let it not be like hogs Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot, While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs, Marking their mock at our accursed lot. If we must die, O let us nobly die, So that our precious blood may not be shed In vain; then even the monsters we defy Shall be constrained to honor us though dead! O kinsmen! We must meet the common foe! Though far outnumbered let us show us brave, And for their thousand blows deal one deathblow! What though before us lies the open grave? Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack, Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!                                      Claude McKay, 1889-1948

       Katie Holmes (my celeb. match and i agree) We're not saying you're really the quiet, sensitive type. But you seem to have a touch of those qualities—enough to make Katie Holmes your celebrity match.   Despite her fame and complete cuteness, you're sure to notice her down-to-earth demeanor that demands friendship before romance. A product of catholic girls school and strict parents, Miss Holmes didn't have much time for boyfriends growing up. This probably explains why she's still a little shy and reserved.   But there's plenty of enthusiasm behind those deep blue eyes. Katie's idea of a good time is a night at the karaoke bar where she transforms herself in to a sing-along diva and then blushes about it afterward—so warm up your backup voice.   There's more substance than flash when it comes to this natural beauty. Katie Holmes is the innocent alternative to all those Hollywood bad girls out there. So even if you can't catch her, maybe you can find someone just like her

      Congratulations, franco! Your IQ score is 115   During the test, you answered four different types of questions — mathematical, visual-spatial, linguistic and logical. We were able to analyze how you did on of those questions, which reveals the way your brain processes information.  We also compared your answers with others who have taken the test, and according to the sorts of questions you got correct, we can tell your Intellectual Type is an Inventive Inquisitor.  You have the unusual distinction of being equally good at math and verbal skills. This means you are a creative thinker and are uniquely good at teaching others through experiences. You are also a great improviser and very good at handling change.    despite the fact that my IQ is higher than that i agree. because from #32-37 i clicked on w.e. cause i got tired lol, either way i think that's a nice round numbah     What is an IQ? The intelligence quotient (IQ) measures the ratio of a person's intellectual age to his/her chronological age. Most adult intelligence tests are designed for people who are at least 16 years old. For this reason, if you are younger than 16, your Emode IQ score might be slightly lower than your "true" IQ.     History of IQ Testing  One of the first scientific investigations into the concept of intelligence, came from nineteenth-century British scientist, Sir Francis Galton. Galton believed that mental traits, like physical traits, could be inherited. He published his ideas on hereditary intelligence in his book, Hereditary Genius.   Meanwhile in France, psychologist Alfred Binet was exploring ways of measuing childrens' intelligence. Like Galton, Binet was passionate about testing and measuring human capabilities. Binet worked with two groups of children — those who were average students, and those who were less mentally capable. He discovered that average students could complete certain tasks that less mentally capable students could not. Based on those findings, Binet calculated the "normal" abilities for students within different age groups. From there he could estimate how many years above, or below the norm a student's mental age was..

      talking to brandy has made me realize i'm never finding another vero. or soraya. so do you settle for less? do you search for perfection? and where do you search, a new face, or and old grace?   I guess we'll really know when we find that person, that's when you'll be able to say it. What i must learn is to stop analyzing things to fualt, to just realize i have someone by myside and please that person the most possible. Sometimes, i gotta learn to just not tell things to the girlf. and have that go to brandy.  And since she's been in my dreams now,it's true waht she said, wouldn't i tbe the most ironic piece of shit, if  while looking for the perfect person it ends up being the one under my nose(bradny lol). that would be the seriously most pathetic thing on earth. Saywe're 18 and then we noticed that would mean 4 years of opening up joys and pains to one another like fools, bitching about guys and girls to each other, and then praising some of them, telling each otehr our observatioons, we end up realizing it's each OTHER we need! that'd be like life slapping you in the face for being stupid lol. 0n the other hand for me that would work out nice, brandy's totally gnarly, so it'd be cool.   Speaking  of slaps in the face i have a huge migraine, so i'll blab about this later, i'm not feeling so well

      isn't it ironic how one song can vouch for so many diffferent things? last night the song below meant for my parents, now it's for Brandy. See the whole day i felt like the third wheel, but to me her and odie, it's perfectly ok, i really don't mind with them being third wheel, it's good.  what i mind is this i'm above you temperament/attitude Odette takes to use when i have see her in person. It's like W.T.F? dude, her fucking looks she shot m once or twice and her "watch the movie not brandy ( i was looking at the cat)" shit, i felt like smacking her. She holds out on you because she considers jsut about veryone not named brandy a shit fuck, well you know what i'm sorry i'm no where near her level, but atleast i fucking TRY. as for brandy: "You know what?I can always rely on you guys", yeah but apparently I can't satisfy you nearly enough.  But w.e. you know what despite my bitchings, i'm not gonna lie i had a lot of fuking fun, i thought it was cool, though brandy's mikey and joy syndrome pissed me off. it was i wonder where they are every five secs. It was cool, it was cute to see them hugging and stuff. It was like bein back in school, with a hella lot more freedom.  then Mikey got there, that's cool i have NO fucking problems with ihm whatsoever. He's a bit too perv for me but what the hell i can stand that, he's funny. What started to anger me was teh whole let's put a potato chip on our tongue for mikey shit....i felt like puking. Then it was let's go upstairs so we can do this better, listen you chumps i paly madden for two three reasons. It's a great game and one of my passions. It releases my thoughts out of whatever is going on that's fucking me up at the moment. It's a damn good excuse to get out of w.e. it is that's going on now.  So w.e. i go down to play madden, hoping and praying nothing was going on upstairs and that the raiders didn't get the first down. They sent Mikey down, cause brandy felt bad i was alone prolly.  w.e., i woulda preffered he stayed up there, in any case they go down, annoy me and disconcentrate me. Then about 5 minutes later, they go oh can we watch a movie instead? Whatever, suit yourself....this was the tenth time we tried watching a movie cause brandy kept being impatient. The movie was as stupid as staring at a dead rat. And what odie told me when brandy left ticked me off...and playing 4th wheel didn't settle to well.  So in the end she goes don't you know how to say goodbye? me: not to you i don't **leaves**  So the future rule bcomes insttituted, unless your my friend and i've met the person online, i don't go. if it's at a mall, it's me you, and if designated and agreed to, other people.  _________________________________________________________________  I spend my time  letting these hopeless thoughts run my life  force me to hide  just create a truth to all these lies   I will never be the same  so just leave me down while i'm seperating  I could never give anymore  all these lies have left me torn   it's only this way falling on my own  I made this mess now it's over  it was nobody's fault, it was all my own  everything's wasted forever   the only hand  that I know how to hold belongs to me  how it began  what I thought was right became my insecurity   I will never be the same  so just leave me down while i'm seperating  I could never give anymore  all these lies have left me torn   it's only this way falling on my own  I made this mess now it's over  it was nobody's fault, it was all my own  everything's wasted forever   it's my own  it's my own   weakness becomes me  my faults relieve me  my fear excludes me  turns it against me  my fault  my fear  turned it against me   it's only this way falling on my own  I made this mess now it's over  it was nobody's fault, it was all my own  everything's wasted forever   it's only this way falling on my own  it's only this way falling on my own  it's only this way falling on my own  it's only this way, it's only this way   it's on my own  it's on my own

      If you said that you could kill the things inside me  You're just a liar, everything inside me's dead  It's nice of you to think that I could ever be that  But I'm not, I'm just a failure instead   Don't preach a story of success and gifted thinking  Because in the end were gonna end up the same way  Keep on living your whole life on hands and knees  'Cause I'll be standing waiting, life ends the same way   Never wanted this life  Because it's meaningless  Gone away from me   The life you've given is a poorly painted picture  The colors running and it's staggering my life  A definition of the truth is all I wanted  Not mental beatings falling short of stupidity   Don't give a speech on your prolific ways of living  You speak in vain whether you think you do or not  Spreading infection of the truth that leads to sick lies  You are the shame inside of me, you mindrot   Never wanted this life  Because it's meaningless  Gone away from me   If you said that you could kill the things inside me  You're just a liar, everything inside me's dead  It's nice of you to think that I could ever be that  But I'm not, I'm just a failure instead   You're so mistaken on the life you think I wanted  I'll give you credit for the effort you put forth  'Cause as it ends you're gonna start to realize that  Your fuckin' prejudice and words of wisdom go unheard   Never wanted this life  Because it's meaningless  Gone away from me   Never wanted this life...

      you know what people bitch about their parents. they say theiy've got to put up with all their shit and bitch and bitch and whine.  And i'm one of them. my fucking father thinks because he's stronger he ownz the fucking world, and he's a brainless fucking monkey. he can't happen to think for himself, my mother has to do that for him. He listens only to what he wants to and never considers both sides of the story. He fucking promises you the fucking world and then NEVER EVER keeps up his shit. but atleast he's not asshole 24/7 and hes' relatively nice compared to it.  It is the piece  of shit that's called my mother. when i was younger would literally beat with whatever she could ifnd. one day i was about 7 an i accidentaly stepped on her foot, she had an umbrella and she nearly killed me. some woman in a fucking car drove by lowered her window and screamed "abusadora!". so she goes, is that what you like, is that what you want people to think?. i felt so bad. i wanted to die. i had let my mother down. she was mad at me, she had been insulted and then she put the blame on me. And that's how i worked till i was 13. finally   let me quote myself "having no parents is better than the dissapointment these people are". Strong yes. But true. Call me ungrateful, call me a spoiled brat whatever you want to spew off about, i don't care. My parents NEVER support me, no one except brandy has even an inkling of what i go through. The other day i was on the phone with jklurt in the car and i told him, i wanna go to AP English for 11th. my father just looked at me and said you'll be lucky to be alive or in school by then. that's what i live with. it doesn't seem like much. but for as long as i could remember i've wanted to please them. i wanted once to see them smile because of me. and for that i blame myself. because these are people who no matter how hard, how high you reach, they don't notice. they only notice the negative. they can't see that within the last year i've gotten a hell of a lot more organized, that my conduct in school has reached a B level. no thy notice every mistake i make, how i leave the towel crooked, the smallest shits on earth. and it's SICKENING. i don't think i've recieved in the last 3 years any praise except for, good your mouth is shut.  everyday is a new low, a new dissapointment....brandy tells me to jsut ignore them...and she's right...because if not i'd be dead now. my parents are the definition of the word imbeciles. i'm not gonna go much into details....today's blow was brought first by my mother, then my father.  First she bitches about how i never leave my room. what the fucking hell for?! so i can bond with her? i rather have my fucking cock ripped out with a dentist's drill, one tiny bit at a time, with no anesticia, while in an oven. As soon as i leave she starts to bitch. Before she showed me articles everyday, and i would read them and since we always agreed we'd be ok, then i found one article i was completely against, and she fucking told me everything, tht i was always trying to not show where i was from that i was wishing to be american (right.) and that i would never get to be considered one of them, that i was a barefooted, arrow weilding nica, this shit and the other...yadda yadda yadda. just because we didn't agree.  then she starts telling me she's not leaving work tomorrow to go bring me back from brandy's party, because i'm such a piece of shit, that i don't deserve to go, that i waste her time...w.e. then my father, who told me he could get out for an HOUR of his work...no, i can only take you, and that's if you go to work with me at 7 if not i can't. this after he RPOMISED EM HE'D TAKE ME AND COME BACK. kinda like he promised me and told me he'd take me to the bowling alley when i was 9, i got him in front of it, and he said no he was too tired. he always has a fucking excuse, and it's such fucking bullshit, that a first grader could see past it. Or when he promised me every year since i was 5 to take me to naples...i'm still fucking waiting.  my mother is jsut a whore who abused me physically, and now since she can't because last time she hit my face and then i got [pissed and held her arms and she couldn't move them, has resorted to verbal abuse, then she goes lik the fucking twat two year old she is and said everything to my dad and now she does it every fucking day.  This is a woman who has lived 16 years in this country, didn't learn how to drive till about a year ago, and speaks three words in half ass english. A woman who fucking is an assistant officer at some palce in doral, gets payed minimum wage and still has her ass in the air about how she USED to be this and that and how she was a high judge...W.E. your not any more ok!? your not in a fucking third world country, here the people are EDUCATED you fucking A.  My childhood was a thing of shit, and whenever i had a good chance to be happy my parents SHITTED on it.  Now my mother already told me at 16 i would drive her around. RIght. If i get payed per second.   The new one is they thought my cousin, wholeft to dominican republic, would take me, i've told them for two fucking months, now i cna't go cause i have no one to bring me back from there. you know what hat's IT. any patience i had wiht them is to hell.    "this isn't a house this is a jail cell with weapons tougher and better than guns"    STILL FUCING WONDER WHY I'M SO FUCKING DEFENSIVE? THERE YOU GO, HAPPY ASSHOLES?

      all people have faults, i have about thirty more than usual. however with women in gen. i think i have about 50 more than usual. oh wait sorry i meant 50,000,000. I think my paranoia alone is enough to kill a good 20% of my relationships. My annoying tendencies kill 10% more and my fucked up personality/ looks, is anohter 50%. The fact that any normal guy is more attractive does in another 10% Another 5 percent goes into the fact that i'm an oddball. 2.5% goes to the fact i hang around to0 many women. 2.4% more goes to the fact that i'm too nice, i'm too sweet i'm too overly good, i dedicate myself too much, and plenty of women rather have the other typ eof guy.  that .1% left is prolly non-existent

      Crush. i'm finally ruined. lol see brandy and sofia have made my once superior quality to like sheet metal walls turn into the equivalent of my fav. drink (zephryhills water bottle) fter it's in the ehat for 15 hours. (gas) So let's see, after 6th grade (ok 4th) mindset was piss them off, don't give a shit, just be good to those that are good to you, and be unnafacted. unnatached. now i feel like i gotta be a good person. WTF?! when the hell did i get morals!? So this years mindset is- have 4 god friends, treat meily and carmen and odie, like the queens (and odie-princess) they are. So with the guys i'm fucked. The chicks i'll be okie with. It's gonan be cool being a prick to some people again, people i haven't seen in 5-3 years. hehe. BTW i'm finally dong the last book, and it sucks majour ass. also.....something. lost train of thought. must talk to brandy about life. must make foot awake! anyways let me spinehsnank in p@eace! and if anyone needs me for anything (ok almost anything) IM, call me.

He wasn't terrific at reading;  He wasn't terrific at math;  But for him education was leading  Straight down a pretty good path.  He didn’t find school too exciting,  But he wanted to do pretty well,  And he did have some trouble with writing, And nobody had taught him to spell.  When doing arithmetic problems,  Pretty good was regarded as fine;  Five and five needn't always add to be 10,  A pretty good answer was nine.  The pretty good student was happy  With the standards that were in effect,  And nobody thought it was sappy  If his answers were not quite correct.  The pretty good class that he sat in  Was part of a pretty good school,  And the student was not an exception;  On the contrary, he was the rule.  The pretty good school that he went to  Was right there in a pretty go0d town,  And nobody there ever noticed  He could not tell a verb from a noun.  The pretty good student, in fact, was  A part of a pretty good mob.  And the first time he knew what he lacked was  When he looked for a pretty good job.  It was then, when he sought a positon,  He discovered that life can be tough,  And he soon had a sneaky suspicion  Pretty good might not be good enough.  The pretty good town in our story  Was part of a pretty good state  Which had pretty good aspirations  And prayed for a pretty good fate.  There once was a pretty good nation,  Pretty proud of the greatness it had,  But which learned much too late,  If you want to be great,  Pretty good is, in fact, pretty bad.    i love that.

      Something that I'm gonna make extremely clear, for the ones I link here. It's ok to have a boyfriend. I just have to approve of him. (which is like getting into Oxford) I'm usually pretty light about it actually, less I either really care for the person, distrust them in certain situations. but what I don't agree with is placing some little faggot you met three days ago on top of a friend that you've known for a year min.  Especially if you and me are "tight". (dawg) Seriously dude, it's ok, I apparently don't need the approval of anyone and if I did I'd get it cause I'm hormonally challenged (read: think with the upper head) for most males You can tell me "trust me on this one" ok I've done that a couple of times which each and EVERY one of you.  And to date I was wrong once, and yet in more than 56 ways (not that I've counted-57) I was right. This applies to EVERYONE I know.  I'm not managing your lives (I'm controlling, j.k.) I'm ok with that, I'm more than ok with various rule breaking (cause shit I done them too). But I don't agree with flagrant stupidity.  let me put it the way my math teacher told me. "IGNORANCE IS NOT AN EXCUSE".If I see a pattern (and it changes with every one, but I find one-usually it's positive!)  I just got the best excuse ever-"were 14" let me ask something. Can you legally drive? have you passed Calculus? have you been through half as tough shit as I have? And if you have did you need friends for the healing? Does it haunt you? yes your 14. You can't drink/drive. You can't go clubbing. You can't vote. Your a shit. Your a freshman/8th grader.  next person to tell me it's none of your bushiness gets my foot up their ass. see the little pig. On MSN? It shows my mood. The blacker the depressor. I have a tiger on now.  I had the black cobwebs.  figure out what that means. C'mon. jes, I'm officially on smartass prick who's pissed off mode and I'm willing to fight.  And with some people like Sofia, I refuse to have a battle of wits with someone who is unarmed. With others, if I make about 100 points straight and your best comeback is it's different. And I prove it's not. shush. Listen. Repeat. Perform action. (or get preview on! {bonus points to Franco for perversion}) To any who thinks IM mentally unwell because I refuse to sue the word SHITHOLE. I think that says enough about YOU. Read my last post and dig from it.  Theresa a difference and a fine line between protecting and obssesiveness, and I won't shit, I break it sometimes. But there's a major difference.  It's different. (like how that works eh?) how is it dif.?  I'm on mr.ANAL-yzation mode. I'm on smart times 15. And i'mma be like this for a good week. Prolly till Saturday. If you put your self in the position of an imbecolic idiot then prepare to be treated as one.  Odette I want you to notice how i'mma be different tomorrow.  see many people lately have been seeing social Franco. He's gone bye bye till someone can knock him OUT of me again. For a while I thought I dropped the Iron Curtain.  It's back with a vengeance (where have I heard that before....) It's not easy living my life and I think my bookbag alone weighs enough, but if you need to add more weight upon Atlas very. FRANCO. (atlas held the weight of the world on his soldiers) then bring it on. I'm ready.  And use purely logical arguments. No what you believe. No what you think. That's worth the paper it's written on. (shtiznecoff). If you have a streak of boyfriends whose IQ reaches at most 4 and they always seem to be in the same cat. As designated by Da Freak. Then that's a pattern. If they have a juvie record the size of my ass, then they can forget about getting near you.  My Situation of no one listening is getting worse by the day, so now i'mma do something tyrannically thati've never seriously meant. I'm threatening physical violence (CPers) and I'm threatening use of weapons of mass destructions (PARENTS) if needed to. And at this point I give three fucks who likes it and who don't. thank you to Laura for listening. She listens and she gains.  I'M BACK. WITH A POWER ATTACK,like a lightning flash across the black pit of Sky.   Two years work mostly down the drain, and now the asshole franco's back and I'm stronger, smarter, faster,sharper.  sitius,altius,fortius  And I part with some thought for you all maybe you mentally inept asses can learn.   "I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future."  "now I lay me down to sleep, pray the lord my should to keep"  "God does not exist, and if religion is an illusion that the majority of men cannot live without... Let men believe in the lies of religion since they cannot do without them, and let then a handful of sages, who know the truth and can live with it, keep it among themselves. Men are then divided into the wise and the foolish, the philosophers and the common men, and atheism becomes a guarded, esoteric doctrine -- for if the illusions of religion were to be discredited, there is no telling with what madness men would be seized, with what uncontrollable anguish.  "The Earth is degenerating these days. Bribery and corruption abound. Children no longer mind their parents, every man wants to write a book, and it is evident that the end of the world is fast approaching. "  ""You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese, the Swiss hold the America's Cup, France is accusing the U.S. of arrogance, Germany doesn't want to go to war, and the three most powerful men in America are named 'Bush', 'Dick', and 'Colon.' Need I say more?" - Chris Rock"  ""1. The first step to knowledge is knowing that we are ignorant" "2. An unexamined life is not worth living."  -Socrates' Two universal truths"  "What we do in life, echoes in eternity." - General Maximus, Gladiator"  "No poor bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making other bastards die for their country." - General George Patton"

      There was once a great apple tree and a little boy. They would spend hours and hours together. The boy would play in the tree's branches, sleep at her roots and eat of her apples. And the tree loved the boy.   One day, the boy came to the tree. The tree was delighted and beckoned, "Come and play!" But the boy was no longer a boy; he was now a young man, and he was interested in making a living, but he didn't know how.  "Here," the tree said, "take my apples and sell them." The young man did just that, and the tree was happy.  Years passed, and the tree was lonely without the young man. One day, he returned, and the tree was delighted, but he was now interested in settling down. He wanted to build a house.  "Here," the tree said, "Cut off my branches and build your house." The young man did just that, and the tree was happy.  Years passed, and the tree still missed her friend. One day, the man returned, and the tree was again overjoyed. But the man was now older and tired of life; he wanted to get away from it all.  "Here," the tree offered, "Cut me down. Make for yourself a boat, and sail the world in it." The man did just that, and the tree was happy.  Many years passed, seasons came and went, and the tree was very lonely. She missed her friend, and she often thought about the old days, when they had such fun. Finally, she saw her friend coming over the hill, and she was delighted.  But the boy was now an old man, no longer able to play or make money or to sail away. And he was tired.  "Here, my friend," the tree said, "I still have a pretty good stump left. Won't you sit and rest?" The old man did that, and the tree was happy.

Here's a breakdown of the range of options:  Agency adoptions   Through the local public agency Through licensed private agencies (includes both domestic and international programs)    Independent adoptions   Identified adoptions  Using attorneys or other intermediaries defined by state law Using adoption facilitators (allowed in only a few states)   Since adoption laws in the state where you live govern your options, it's essential that you know which types of placements are allowed in your state. If you pursue an adoption across state lines, you must comply with the laws in both states before the child can join your family. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have enacted legislation (called the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children) that governs how children can be placed across state lines.  Think about how much risk you can tolerate. Of the options listed above, agency adoptions provide the greatest assurance of monitoring and oversight since agencies are required to adhere to licensing and procedural standards. Independent adoptions by attorneys provide assurance that attorneys must adhere to the standards of the Bar Association, and some attorneys who specialize in adoption are members of the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, a professional membership organization with standards of ethical practice. Adoptive placements by facilitators offer the least amount of supervision and oversight. This doesn't mean that facilitators are not ethical professionals with good standards of practice! It simply means there are few or no oversight mechanisms in place at this time.  Agency Adoptions  There are both private and public adoption agencies. A private adoption agency is supported by private funds and should be licensed or approved by the state in which it operates. A public agency is the local branch of your state social service agency. Most public agencies handle only special-needs adoptions -- not infant or international adoptions.   Using a private agency  To obtain the names of local private agencies, look under "Adoption Agencies" or "Social Services" in the yellow pages. You can get a free copy of your state's agency listing from NAIC. (Visit the NAIC Web site at http://www.calib.com/naic to access the National Adoption Directory online.) Check with your state adoption specialist, the Better Business Bureau near the agency, and the state attorney general's office to see if other adoptive families have lodged any complaints. You can check with local adoptive parent support groups for their recommendations of reputable agencies.  Private agencies handle both domestic and international adoptions. You will need to decide which kind of child you want to join your family. Fees charged by private adoption agencies range from $5,000 to more than $30,000 for both domestic and international adoptions.  Ask any agency you might work with what its fees are and what the schedule is for paying them. You should also ask what services are and are not covered by the fees. Most will allow you to pay fees in installments due at particular points during the adoption process. If the fee policy is clear from the beginning, any misunderstandings about payment will be less likely.  Using a public agency  You can find an appropriate agency listed in your telephone book in the government section under a name such as "Department of Social Services" or "Department of Public Welfare." Each state organizes its agencies somewhat differently. They may be organized regionally or by county. To begin, call your county office and ask to speak to the adoption specialist. If the county office cannot help you, ask to be referred to the regional or state office.  In general, public agencies will accept adoption applications from families wanting to adopt older children, sibling groups, or children with special physical or psychological needs. Many of the children waiting for placement through public agencies are children of color. Adoption services through a public agency are usually free or available for a modest fee, since the services are funded through state and federal taxes. Federal or state subsidies are sometimes available to assist families adopting a child with special needs. Even if a child has no special needs, adoptive parents may only be asked to pay legal fees, which are often quite reasonable. In some cases, subsidies may even be available for the legal fees, too.  Children in the custody of a public agency were either abused, neglected, or abandoned by their birth parents. Abuse and neglect can leave physical and emotional scars. It's important to discuss all aspects of a child's history with the agency social workers and to discuss the availability of counseling or other services -- just in case they might be needed -- before deciding to adopt a child with a traumatic history.  Foster parenting  Another parenting option available through public agencies is foster parenting. Children are placed with foster parents to give birth parents a chance to improve their situations. Birth parents are offered counseling and services during this time. Foster parents receive a monthly stipend for a child's living expenses. In general, the goal of the foster care program is to reunite the child with his or her birth parents if at all possible. However, there is a growing trend toward freeing children for adoption (that is, terminating the parental rights of the birth parents) as quickly as possible to prevent years of drifting in foster care. Federal legislation has mandated courts to seek termination of parental rights when a child has been in foster care for 15 out of the past 22 months unless there are extenuating circumstances. More and more foster parents are adopting their foster children. This is particularly true for foster children of color or those with special needs. In almost all states, the vast majority of children adopted from the public foster care system were adopted by their foster parents or by their relatives.  Recently, some states have changed the way they organize their parenting programs. They consider foster parenting and adoption to be a continuum of service, rather than two separate functions. As a result, agency personnel may ask you at the time of application if you want to be only foster parents, only adoptive parents, or foster/adoptive parents. Foster/adoptive parents are willing to be foster parents while that is the child's need and understand that the agency will make all efforts to reunite the child with the birth parents. However, if the child is freed for adoption, the foster/adoptive parents may be given priority consideration as his or her potential adoptive parents.  It'll take some soul-searching on your part to decide whether foster parenting is a good option for you. If you can stand some uncertainty, it's a viable option, especially if you have your heart set on a young child and you don't have the funds for a private agency or independent adoption. You must be able to maturely face the prospect of a child being reunited with birth parents, feel sincerely that reunification is indeed in the best interest of the child at that time, and be prepared to handle the grief that would accompany such a loss.  If you're considering this option, discuss becoming a foster/adoptive parent with the agency social workers and other foster parents who have adopted their former foster children.  Independent Adoptions  Adoptions can sometimes be arranged without an agency. Initial contacts can be made directly between a pregnant woman and adoptive parents or by the pregnant woman and an attorney, depending on state law. Independent adoption is legal in all but a few states, but you'll need to find out about the specifics of the law in your own state.  If you pursue this approach, retain an experienced adoption attorney to explain your state's adoption laws. Talk to other adoptive parents. Become familiar with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), because in interstate adoptions you will be required to comply with the adoption laws of both states. You certainly don't want your adoption to be challenged because of failing to comply with the relevant adoption laws.  To initiate an independent adoption, you must first locate a birth mother interested in relinquishing her child. In the states where it's legal, advertising in the classified section of local newspapers has proven to be a successful method for bringing birth parents and adoptive parents together. You can advertise on your own or use a national adoption advertising consultant. Another way to locate a birth mother is to send an introductory letter, photo, and resume describing your family life, home, jobs, hobbies, and interests to crisis pregnancy centers, obstetricians, and all of your friends and colleagues who might possibly lead you to the right person. Some families have even advertised on the Internet.  Simply locating a birth mother is only the first step. You also need to know about the birth father. States have recognized the rights of birth fathers to be involved in decisions about their children, including adoptions. Many states have established registries (putative father registries) as a way for birth fathers to register their intention to support and be involved in their child's life. Several high-profile lawsuits have involved contested adoptions where birth fathers were not notified of the adoptive placement of the child and subsequently objected.  Expenses involved in an independent adoption vary. It's customary for adoptive parents to pay for the birth mother's medical and legal expenses, in addition to their own. Some states also require the adoptive parents to pay for counseling for the birth parents so that the court can be satisfied that they both fully comprehend what they are planning to do. A home study, for which there is a fee, conducted by a certified social worker or a licensed child-placing agency, is usually required. In some states, the adoptive parents may also help out with the birth mother's living or clothing expenses. Again, with each of these issues, you must know your state adoption laws and what they allow or prohibit in an adoption.  Identified adoption  Identified adoption is a form of independent adoption in which a birth mother and adoptive parents locate one another, but then go together to a licensed adoption agency. (In a few states, this is the only type of independent adoption allowed.) The agency conducts the home study for the adoptive parents and counsels the birth mother. All the parties know that the birth mother's baby will be placed with that couple. This process combines some of the positive elements of all types of adoption: the birth mother can feel confident that her child will have a future with an approved, loving family, and the adoptive parents can feel confident that the birth mother has thought carefully about her decision. As in any adoption, however, a birth mother may still change her mind about placing the child.  Many couples who have adopted infants independently found it was the right solution for them. It may be the solution for you; however, it's not for everyone. Some adoptive parents who have adopted independently say later that it might have been nice to have had the emotional support and thoughtful preparation for adoption that an adoption agency provides. Most parents want to be well prepared to help their children deal with adoption issues they will face at different points in their lives. Some parents seek support before and after adopting independently by joining adoptive parent support groups.  Adoption facilitators  A few states permit adoption facilitators to act as "matchmakers" who recruit and counsel birth parents and then make introductions to prospective adoptive families. The facilitators charge families for their services and allow the birth parents and the adoptive family to make the rest of the placement arrangements.  Each potential independent adoption situation is different, and this method can be expensive. It's not uncommon for the expenses in an independent adoption to equal those of a private agency adoption, unless the birth mother has health insurance or is covered by medical assistance. Since many birth parents change their minds after the child is born, prospective adoptive families must often deal with the loss of funds paid for the birth parents' expenses in addition to the loss of the anticipated baby. Some adoptive parents purchase adoption insurance as a way to guard against such financial risks; insurance underwriters require that families work with preapproved agencies or attorneys in order to purchase this insurance. ________________ ok that's really long.

      i jsut saw an extremely great movie, my friend from Canada brought it to me.  It's called "Bowling for Columbine"   Produced by  Kathleen Glynn & Jim Czarnecki  Producers  Charles Bishop & Michael Donovan  "Bowling for Columbine" is an alternately humourous and horrifying film about the United States. It is a film about the state of the Union, about the violent soul of America. Why do 11,000 people die in America each year at the hands of gun violence? The talking heads yelling from every TV camera blame everything from Satan to video games. But are we that much different from many other countries? What sets us apart? How have we become both the master and victim of such enormous amounts of violence? This is not a film about gun control. It is a film about the fearful heart and soul of the United States, and the 280 million Americans lucky enough to have the right to a constitutionally protected Uzi.  "Bowling for Columbine" was the first documentary film accepted into competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 46 years. The Cannes jury unanimously awarded it the 55th Anniversary Prize. From a look at the Columbine High School security camera tapes to the home of Oscar-winning NRA President Charlton Heston, from a young man who makes homemade napalm with The Anarchist's Cookbook to the murder of a six-year-old girl by another six-year-old, "Bowling for Columbine" is a journey through America, and through our past, hoping to discover why our pursuit of happiness is so riddled with violence.  ________________________________________________________________ It's a great unbiased movie. look at the clips they have their for more info.

       Hello, Moon Has America's low-rise obsession gone too far? By Amanda Fortini   America is in the throes of a crack epidemic. Sitting in a booth with a friend at an excruciatingly hip restaurant in downtown Manhattan a few weeks ago, I glanced up to see a fleshy forest of crevices and multiple folds of skin and G-strings that three women in their late 20s were displaying for the world. It was then that I knew: This low-rider style has gone too far.   On the street, on television, even in the office, women of all ages and sizes are wearing tight, low-slung, butt-hugging jeans and pants that hit at, or often far below, the hip. The trend isn't new—it began around '95 or so—but what is new are the unlovely depths to which the pants have now, as it were, sunk. The crotch-to-waist measurement, or rise, on a standard pair of jeans (the sort we haven't seen much of since the early '90s) is somewhere between 10 and 12 inches. Early low-riders had a rise of about 7 inches. Over the past couple of years, the rise has dipped as low as 3 or 4 inches. Low-rise, it seems, has become synonymous with no-rise. Gasoline, a Brazilian company, has even created Down2There jeans, which feature a bungee cord that allows the wearer to lower her pants as she sees fit, as though adjusting a set of Venetian blinds.   Usually paired with midriff-baring shirts—even tops that aren't cropped can't cover the exposed expanse of abdominal flesh—the jeans have redefined our collective understanding of cleavage. Then there's the oft-visible G-string that, like a bra strap, creates strange fleshy bulges as it strains against the body. But there are worse bulges yet. These are the love handles that materialize on even the thinnest women—models and anorexics excepted—because the jeans hit a woman's body at its fleshiest point, below the hips, just above the buttocks. Of course, the feminist in me wants to applaud the insouciance with which women of all shapes now flaunt their imperfections, but the aesthete in me objects. This is a style that suits only 12-year-olds and celebrities who have the luxury of devoting entire afternoons to sculpting their obliques. For the rest of us, wearing these jeans is like putting our hips and buttocks in some humiliating reality show.   Yet the real problem with extremely low-riding pants is that they're impractical. Sitting is difficult: If you can't find a chair with a closed back, you have to tie a shirt around your waist—always highly attractive—or risk scandalizing the room. If you drop something, or need to tie your shoe, abandon all hope; bending over with dignity is next to impossible. You must perfect the art of squatting, back straight, head up, as though preparing to curtsy. Low-riders also tend to slide down, requiring the wearer to hitch them up repeatedly. In their way, low-rider jeans bear a creepy similarity to Chinese foot-binding—they constrict a woman's action, rendering her ornamental. And like foot-binding, the jeans can have deleterious medical consequences. In 2001, the Canadian Medical Association Journal published a  urlLink doctors report  stating that low-rise jeans can cause a condition called meralgia paresthetica, characterized by numbness or tingling in the thighs, by pinching a nerve located at the hip. Left untreated, the numbness can become permanent. Forget the question of style: This is a human rights issue.   So, how did we go so low? In America, the first low-rise jeans, called hip-huggers, became popular during the late '60s, with the ascendance of the hippie counterculture and rock 'n' roll. Icons of rock like Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison helped to popularize the style. In the '70s, the pants went mainstream and became a staple of disco culture—people danced "The Hustle" in their Wrangler hip-huggers. In the late '70s and early '80s, waistlines moved higher as the culture, and fashion, grew increasingly conservative. Throughout the '80s and into the '90s, as more women entered the corporate workforce, the high waist continued to reign. Even Madonna, who arguably is responsible for today's exposed abdomens, didn't wear low-rise. In pictures of her from that decade, her hip bones are always covered by the waistband of her pants.   Then, around 1992, Alexander McQueen sent models down the runway in his shockingly low-slung "Bumsters." In 1995, Tom Ford's first (and wildly popular) collection for Gucci included his now-famous velvet hip-hugger suit, worn by Madonna, among other celebrities. By the mid-'90s, hip-huggers had infiltrated popular culture: Juliette Lewis wore a red pair in Natural Born Killers and Mark Wahlberg memorably peeled his off in Boogie Nights. But it took Britney, Christina, and Jennifer Lopez to bring the style, riding lower than ever, back into the mainstream over the past five years.    By the time a trend hits malls across America, high fashion is already calling it déclassé. Vogue declared low-rise pants over in May 2002, and that spring Tom Ford himself showed a trouser with a higher waist, wider legs, and dropped crotch. In spring 2003, several other designers showed high-waisted pants for fall. And in August 2003, Sarah Jessica Parker, an arbiter of style, told Vogue that she doesn't consider low-rise pants to be age-appropriate for a woman like herself.   It usually takes only a couple of months for a trend to go from the fashion magazines to the streets, and yet somehow, like the G-strings it popularized, this trend clings tenaciously on. It could be that the pants are a feminist statement, demanding as they do an ecumenical embrace of body type by wearer and viewer alike, and as such, women are loathe to abandon them. It could be that the dark fissures and peek-a-boo undies they reveal are physical emblems of our confessional culture, the sartorial equivalent of the tell-all memoir. It could simply be that letting your belly hang free is comfortable. Or that women, buying these pants for lack of choice, have unwittingly created a false sense of demand. But the strongest argument for the persistence of the trend might simply be that we want to dress like the '70s because we feel like we're starring in a reprise of that decade: Our economy is bad; we're entrenched in an occupation abroad; we mistrust our government at home.  I'm not advocating that we abandon this style in favor of Katharine Hepburn-type trousers belted just below the rib cage. As a fashionable friend recently said, low-slung trousers, with their rock 'n' roll connotations, simply look "groovier." But moderately low-rise pants can be worn with style and class. There's a famous photograph of Jackie Kennedy Onassis, taken by the celebrity photographer Ron Galella in the early '70s. In it, Jackie walks along a Manhattan street, holding only her keys. The wind musses her hair, and she looks over her shoulder at the camera. Perhaps surprisingly, she is wearing hip-huggers with a slim-fitting ribbed knit sweater. Not surprisingly, she bares no midriff. And a G-string is nowhere in sight.

ESPN is calling it Separation Saturday, because the great teams will separate themselves from the good.   The afternoon begins with No. 2 Miami at No. 5 Florida State. Continues with No. 1 Oklahoma playing archrival No. 11 Texas. Those games make up a doubleheader on ABC Sports. The night features No. 3 Ohio State at No. 22 Wisconsin, and No. 10 Georgia at No. 14 Tennessee, which will determine the leader in the SEC East. In the SEC West, the winner of Auburn at No. 8 Arkansas will join No 6 LSU at the top of the division. __________________________________________________________   Saturday, October 11   MIAMI AT FLORIDA STATE    No. 2 Miami (5-0)   AT No. 5 Florida State (5-0)    Time: 12:00 PM ET  Tallahassee Forecast: Thunderstorms 65-80°F   _______________________________________  Is this heaven?

      you've been asking WTF i have so here you go    What Are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder causes dramatic mood swings—from overly "high" and/or irritable to sad and hopeless, and then back again, often with periods of normal mood in between. Severe changes in energy and behavior go along with these changes in mood. The periods of highs and lows are called episodes of mania and depression.  Signs and symptoms of mania (or a manic episode) include:  -Increased energy, activity, and restlessness  -Excessively "high," overly good, euphoric mood  -Extreme irritability  -Racing thoughts and talking very fast, jumping from one idea to another  -Distractibility, can't concentrate well  -Little sleep needed  -Unrealistic beliefs in one's abilities and powers  -Poor judgment  -Spending sprees  -A lasting period of behavior that is different from usual  -Increased sexual drive  -Abuse of drugs, particularly cocaine, alcohol, and sleeping medications  -Provocative, intrusive, or aggressive behavior  -Denial that anything is wrong   A manic episode is diagnosed if elevated mood occurs with 3 or more of the other symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for 1 week or longer. If the mood is irritable, 4 additional symptoms must be present.  Signs and symptoms of depression (or a depressive episode) include:  -Lasting sad, anxious, or empty mood  -Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism  -Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness  -Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed, including sex  -Decreased energy, a feeling of fatigue or of being "slowed down"  -Difficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions  -Restlessness or irritability  -Sleeping too much, or can't sleep  -Change in appetite and/or unintended weight loss or gain  -Chronic pain or other persistent bodily symptoms that are not caused by physical illness or injury  -Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts  -A depressive episode is diagnosed if 5 or more of these symptoms last most of the day, nearly every day, for a period of 2 weeks or longer.  A mild to moderate level of mania is called hypomania. Hypomania may feel good to the person who experiences it and may even be associated with good functioning and enhanced productivity. Thus even when family and friends learn to recognize the mood swings as possible bipolar disorder, the person may deny that anything is wrong. Without proper treatment, however, hypomania can become severe mania in some people or can switch into depression.  Sometimes, severe episodes of mania or depression include symptoms of psychosis (or psychotic symptoms). Common psychotic symptoms are hallucinations (hearing, seeing, or otherwise sensing the presence of things not actually there) and delusions (false, strongly held beliefs not influenced by logical reasoning or explained by a person's usual cultural concepts). Psychotic symptoms in bipolar disorder tend to reflect the extreme mood state at the time. For example, delusions of grandiosity, such as believing one is the President or has special powers or wealth, may occur during mania; delusions of guilt or worthlessness, such as believing that one is ruined and penniless or has committed some terrible crime, may appear during depression. People with bipolar disorder who have these symptoms are sometimes incorrectly diagnosed as having schizophrenia, another severe mental illness.  It may be helpful to think of the various mood states in bipolar disorder as a spectrum or continuous range. At one end is severe depression, above which is moderate depression and then mild low mood, which many people call "the blues" when it is short-lived but is termed "dysthymia" when it is chronic. Then there is normal or balanced mood, above which comes hypomania (mild to moderate mania), and then severe mania.  In some people, however, symptoms of mania and depression may occur together in what is called a mixed bipolar state. Symptoms of a mixed state often include agitation, trouble sleeping, significant change in appetite, psychosis, and suicidal thinking. A person may have a very sad, hopeless mood while at the same time feeling extremely energized.  Bipolar disorder may appear to be a problem other than mental illness—for instance, alcohol or drug abuse, poor school or work performance, or strained interpersonal relationships. Such problems in fact may be signs of an underlying mood disorder.

       Game 7 of the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium.  The Red Sox against the Yankees.  Pedro Martinez vs. Roger Clemens.  The winner going to the World Series.   Will anybody be watching "Friends" tonight?  ______________________________________________   It isn't about curses. It isn't about goats. It isn't about fans with long arms. It isn't about fate.  Sometimes, it's actually about baseball. What a concept   What folks often forget at times like this is that there are two teams playing in these games. And due to circumstances beyond the control of Bud Selig, the FOX television network, Wood, Prior, Dusty Baker, Bill Murray, Bernie Mac, the Illinois Confederation of Goat Farmers and collectors of red ivy, one of those teams happened to be the Florida Marlins.  If you let them play, it's trouble for everybody. The Giants found that out. The Phillies found that out. All those teams chasing them in the wild-card free-for-all found that out.  And Wednesday night at Wrigley Field, the Marlins delivered that message one more time, with a 9-6 pounding of Wood and the Cubs in Game 7 of an NLCS it will take a long while to forget.  So the Florida Marlins are going to the World Series. They understand they've screwed up about a zillion romantic plot lines. They understand they're about the last team on earth that the poets, the historians and the ratings counters wanted to see show up at that World Series. But that's a problem only for the poets, the historians and the ratings counters  The Marlins' national profile is closer to the Peoria Chiefs than it is to the Cubs, Red Sox or Yankees. But somehow, while we were all busy watching other games and making other World Series plans, the Marlins were winning more games than any of those teams since we finished firing up the Memorial Day barbecues.   On the national airwaves, they aren't the big story in this series, even now. Even after winning it. Even after becoming the fourth team in history to wriggle out of a 3-games-to-1 snakepit in the League Championship Series. Even now that they have a chance to become the first team since the 1914 Miracle Braves to win a World Series in a season in which they were once 10 games below .500.  But that's because this series isn't going to be remembered as the series the Marlins won. It's going to be remembered as the series the Cubs couldn't lose -- but did. That's how this media game works  The World Series. Featuring the Florida Marlins.   (congrats marlins, gooo0o0o0 fish!)

      When it comes to speeches that inspire, there isn't a coach in the world who can compete with Hollywood. Here are my favorite speeches from the silver screen.  _____________________________ Bluto in "Animal House"    Admit it. . .Everyone wanted to be Bluto when they were in college.   My  take: Still one of the single-greatest speeches ever made. That's why Bluto had a great career in politics following his days at Delta House.   D-Day: War's over, man. Wormer dropped the big one. Bluto: Over? Did you say "over"? Nothing is over until we decide it is! Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!  Otter: Germans?  Boon: Forget it, he's rolling.  Bluto: And it ain't over now. 'Cause when the goin' gets tough...  (Bluto pauses, thinking) Bluto: ...the tough get goin'! Who's with me? Let's go! AAAAARRRGH!! (Bluto runs out, alone; then returns) Bluto: What the *#%* happened to the Delta I used to know? Where's the spirit? Where's the guts, huh? "Ooh, we're afraid to go with you Bluto, we might get in trouble." Well just kiss my ass from now on! Not me! I'm not gonna take this. Wormer, he's a dead man! Marmalard, dead! Niedermeyer... Otter: ...Dead! Bluto's right. Psychotic, but absolutely right. We gotta take these bastards. Now we could do it with conventional weapons that could take years and cost millions of lives. No, I think we have to go all out. I think that this situation absolutely requires a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody's part.  Bluto: We're just the guys to do it.  D-Day: Let's do it. Bluto: LET'S DO IT!  ________________________  Sir William Wallace in "Braveheart" My take: If this doesn't get you ready to go to war, nothing will.    Wallace: Sons of Scotland! I am William Wallace! Scotsman: William Wallace is seven feet tall! Wallace: Yes, I've heard! Kills men by the hundreds! And if he were here, he'd consume the English with fireballs from his eyes...and bolts of lightning from his arse! (laughter) I AM William Wallace! And I see, a whole army of my countrymen, here in defiance of tyranny. You've come to fight as free men, and free men you are. What will you do with that freedom? Will you fight? Scotsman: Fight? Against that? No, we will run, and we will live. Wallace: Aye, fight and you may die. Run, and you'll live. At least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that...for one chance...just ONE CHANCE to come back here to tell our enemy that they may take out lives, but they will never take OUR FREEDOM!!!   _____________________________ Col. Jessep in "A Few Good Men"    "You want me on that wall. You need me there."  My take: How great was this? Jessep is that hard-ass coach you loved and hated at the same time.   Jessep: You want answers? Kaffee: I think I'm entitled to them.  Jessep: You want answers?!  Kaffee: I want the truth.  Jessep: You can't handle the truth!   Jessep: Son, we live in a world that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lt. Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You don't want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me there. We use words like honor, code, loyalty... we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use 'em as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it. I'd prefer you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to.  _________________________________  Terence Mann in "Field of Dreams" MY take: A speech to remember and one that was only surpassed in the movie by the line "Dad, wanna have a catch?" Guys everywhere cried much to their girlfriends/wives delight. Who says the best motivational speeches can't make you cry?   Terence Mann: Ray, people will come Ray. They'll come to Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom. They'll turn up your driveway not knowing for sure why they're doing it. They'll arrive at your door as innocent as children, longing for the past. Of course, we won't mind if you look around, you'll say. It's only $20 per person. They'll pass over the money without even thinking about it: for it's money they have and peace they lack. And they'll walk out to the bleachers; sit in shirtsleeves on a perfect afternoon. They'll find they have reserved seats somewhere along one of the baselines, where they sat when they were children and cheered they're heroes. And they'll watch the game and it'll be as if they dipped themselves in magic waters. And the memories will be so thick they'll have to brush them away from their faces. People will come Ray. The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers. It has been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field, this game: it's a part of our past, Ray. It reminds of us of all that once was good and it could be again. Oh,.. people will come Ray. People will most definitely come.  ________________________________  Tony D'Amato in "Any Given Sunday" My take: Tough to pick just one speech from this movie -- or one Al Pacino speech from his career (Scarface, Scent of a Woman, Godfather series). But since this is tied to football, I had to go here.   Tony D'Amato: You find out life's this game of inches, so is football. Because in either game -- life or football -- the margin for error is so small. I mean, one half a step too late or too early and you don't quite make it. One half second too slow, too fast and you don't quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around us. They're in every break of the game, every minute, every second. On this team we fight for that inch. On this team we tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that inch. We claw with our fingernails for that inch. Because we know when add up all those inches, that's gonna make the &*#$-ing difference between winning and losing! Between living and dying!   ___________________________ Sylvester Stallone in Rocky My take: With apologies to the "Just Win" scene in Rocky II, this is the one that gets you. This is the one that keeps teams fighting even when it's 73-7. Gotta like that attitude.   Rocky: Ah come on, Adrian, it's true. I was nobody. But that don't matter either, you know? 'Cause I was thinkin', it really don't matter if I lose this fight. It really don't matter if this guy opens my head, either. 'Cause all I wanna do is go the distance. Nobody's ever gone the distance with Creed, and if I can go that distance, you see, and that bell rings and I'm still standin', I'm gonna know for the first time in my life, see, that I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood.  ______________________________  Jake and Elwood in "Blues Brothers" My take: Come on. . .You didn't think I'd leave this out did you?    Jake Blues: First you trade the Cadillac for a microphone. Then you lie to me about the band. Now you're gonna put me right back in the joint!  Elwood Blues: They're not gonna catch us. We're on a mission from God!  ___________________________________________  Jefferson Smith in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" My take: Surprised? See, I love the classics as well. If you haven't seen this one, go rent it.   Jefferson Smith: (His voice very hoarse) Just get up off the ground, that's all I ask. Get up there with that lady that's up on top of this Capitol dome, that lady that stands for liberty. Take a look at this country through her eyes if you really want to see something. And you won't just see scenery; you'll see the whole parade of what Man's carved out for himself, after centuries of fighting. Fighting for something better than just jungle law, fighting so's he can stand on his own two feet, free and decent, like he was created, no matter what his race, color, or creed. That's what you'd see. There's no place out there for graft, or greed, or lies, or compromise with human liberties. And, uh, if that's what the grownups have done with this world that was given to them, then we'd better get those boys' camps started fast and see what the kids can do. And it's not too late, because this country is bigger than the Taylors, or you, or me, or anything else. Great principles don't get lost once they come to light. They're right here; you just have to see them again!  _____________________________________  Monty Python "The Holy Grail" My take: Ah, the best of the "never say die" attitude.   King Arthur: There I've won. Black Knight: 'Tis but a scratch. King Arthur: What are you talking about, your arm's off.  Black Knight: No it isn't.  King Arthur: What do you call that then? Black night: (Pauses) I've had worse! King Arthur: You liar! Black Knight: Come on ya pansy! King Arthur: You are indeed brave, sir knight, but the fight is mine. Black Knight: Oh, had enough eh? King Arthur: Look, you stupid bastard. You've got no arms left! Black Knight: Yes I have. King Arthur: Look! Black Knight: Just a flesh wound!

      Ok, a l0ng time ago Brandy asked me how i felt. Back then i felt in Heaven, i had a good close core group of people who i cared about and vice versa and we were all close. I felt awwesome cuase i knew i could always turn to her. It's like, finally I had paid my dues since 3rd grade and i got my reward, from December to August really, were the best months of my life. I mean the had lows but ihad my friends the whole time...now it's ...well look here, i wrote this last night at 2 A.M  "I...........   I can't xee what i'm writing. it's late night, early mornin, i'm crushed. Every night i'm thinking about how my parents are such a shit. About how my friends have just, left like rats from a sinking ship. I'm on teh verge of crying, yet again.Due in part to Brandy. I understand she wants to distance herself but w.e. I think it's unjust to me. I suffer thinking about her everyday and night, wishing for her to be near, to have one of the old conversation where i could tell her anything and everything. Carmen and Sofy, Laura they've become aquaintences, me and sofy used to be real close even in diff. schools and now... she's basically gone. And Meily, because of her going back to Chris twice, i trust but, the "I love yous" seem sorta forced out of her and, I feel like she's hiding something from me, i don't know what though. Odie, she jsut bitches at me, tries to avoid me. I know i'm annoying but it's to get your attention and say  LOOK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME! ASK ME WHAT IT IS! "  That's all i could write before i got tired. i'm putting on a happy front at school, i haven't had to do that for two years. i don't care what ahppens now, if i get one more month in my life of the hapiness i've felt over the last couple of months, i'd be terribly happy. I just....if nobody else i wish i ahd brandy and odie back. Meily i ahve, but i don't know to what degree, but i do love her.    Brandy, i miss ehr friendship, her warmness, and her advice. the fact that i don't even get a five minute phone call from her like i used to at teh beggining of the year a week. I haven't heard from Brandy for two weeks. It's depressing, and I'm supoer sensitive when it comes to those i care about, and i'm sorry if i offend but there's NO ONE i care for as much as her. I also feel horrid that i make her feel like shit by critisizing, but even she said it "schools easing up". I wouldn't mind hearing her from time to time. It's oo painful to lose her, especially so slowly, inch by inch.  Odette, she can't tell when somethings wrong, she doesn't care about me enough to hold me in her arms and just go "hey, big guy it'll be alright". That would mean so much to me. but odie......She gets too caught up in other things, and hell i understand and i get that Robert is her love or w.e., but have some time for the others, i don't ask for 24 hours a week, i ask for 1.   Meily,  i love her, and she's def. real best freind material, and if it weren't for the fact that i like her (again) then...i'd be content with that. But sometimes i wonder if she leads me on for fun,or whether she really cares about me. And maybe it's jsut the previous paranoia form the whole chris affair hurting the present but.... my psyche is messedup by that past, and its in my mind when i talk to her, especially seeing as in person she's rather jsut like an aquaintance with me. w.e., maybe i'm just eating shit.  Incredible how i'm a really strong person, physically and mentally-emotionally... yet when it comes to those closest to me, i'm so damned fragile, i've got to grow up some in this respect, but i think i've just been scarred so horribly by the past that the present seems impossible to survive, so i guess i have nothing to look foward to except the future. And if it's anything like what i've gone through, then it's not too bright, anyways, mom walked into the ro0m....will continue in a later post, sad how my long posts are depressing, the best ones too.

      Another day, another post.   The Inferiority Complex  and  The need for Social Approval     The two basic needs that a child has to master, if possible, are the inferiority complex and the need for social approval. The child cannot separate them (nor can many adults), and so these two needs often react on each other. The two needs exist because the child is both an individual and a social person.  The idea of the inferiority complex was put forward by Alfred Adler in the early 20th century. Ideas about the hidden aspects of the mind were in their infancy. What Adler appears to have done was to mix the two needs together - he only recognised the existence of one need. What I have done is to improve on Adler's idea by separating the two needs. In my understanding, the inferiority complex refers to the need to be an individual.  The idea of a distinct social need came later, with R D Laing's concept of 'confirmation'. 'Confirmation' is too abstract a concept for popular use. I prefer to use the concept of 'social approval'.     If a person is subject to humiliation from another person and made to feel inferior, the person thinks that it is the inferiority complex that is aroused in him. This is not always the case. More often, it is the need for social approval that has been activated.     The child may focus on his individuality. He may desire to attain something that he likes and is willing to put in the necessary effort long-term. If this desire is over-emphasised, he is likely to lose friends and become a loner. On the other hand, if he desires friends, he will put friendship and social attainments above personal attainments. He is likely to become a very sociable person. If this desire is over-emphasised, his individuality becomes eclipsed.  Now if circumstances frustrate his ability to attain his dreams, and he compares himself unfavourably to other people who have succeeded, then he will develop an inferiority complex. And if his attempts to be sociable are frustrated, he will develop the need for social approval.  At school these needs inter-twine. If he is bottom of the class in some subject that he likes, his inferiority complex will spur him to better himself. If he is bottom of the class in some subject that he does not like, he will not develop an inferiority complex (for that subject). Instead, he is likely to focus on his need for social approval by getting a name for himself, even if it is only as a trouble-maker.  If he does not have many friends, but has a close friendship with one or two others, he does not intensify his need for social approval. But if he does not have friends, then he does intensify his need for social approval. Since he does not have friends, he lacks social skills and feels awkward in the presence of his peers. It becomes difficult to make friends with the opposite sex. He becomes very lonely.     There are two tests for separating one need from the other.  First.  To understand the basic difference between the two needs, it will help if you can understand the difference between two terms : loneliness and aloneness. A person who focuses on individuality will at sometime feel aloneness ; at this moment he is a loner. Whilst a person who focuses on social approval will sometimes feel loneliness.  Second.  Your views about yourself can belittle you, and the criticisms of other people can also belittle you. This can make you dislike someone. The decisive test for separating the two needs is what person is your dislike directed to. Who do you dislike ?  If you dislike yourself, then this implies the inferiority complex is dominant at that moment.  If you dislike the other person, then the need for social approval is uppermost at that moment (if it were not uppermost, then what that person said to us would not bother us).     These two needs can inter-twine. So sometimes you can dislike yourself, and at other times you can dislike other people.     Some children try to get round their problems with sociability by becoming brilliant at some particular subject in order to attract friends. But they fail in this. What they discover is that becoming brilliant in something (that is, being motivated by the inferiority complex) does not enable them to develop social skills. So overcoming the inferiority complex will not enable the child to get friends. The child gets friends by overcoming his need for social approval.     The inferiority complex is most problematic for youths, which is the prime time of narcissism. Most people don't know what narcissism means, but this does not stop them from experiencing it. Everytime you go to a party, feel excited, dance and have a good time, you are in a mood of narcissism. So the teenage years and early 20s are the prime years of narcissistic experience for everyone, and the prime years of bearing the burden of inferiority.

      The question before us is if the sporting arena is the proper venue for airing social protest, whether athletes involved in sports are proper messengers of political conscience.  It depends on who you are. If you're just a jock, looking to maintain that comfortable, peculiar but undeniable societal status that goes along with being a jock, then you don't want that peculiar status threatened. If you're a fan, you come to sports not to think about "stuff like that." But if you're an actual living, breathing human being, on whom education was not wasted, you follow your conscience.     Quiet protest: Toni Smith turns her back to the flag as the pregame anthem is played.    In the end, it's not important what others think of you.  It's what you think of yourself.  There are no rules about how to express this, except, one hopes, that you'd do it lawfully, peacefully and effectively.   I'd say Toni Smith has figured this out better than most.  Two million hits on a once-lonely Manhattanville College Web site in response says the Quiet War of Toni Smith has been effectively transmitted out to the world. This was not her intent, to become TV programming, to become debate material for the rest of us. She is a 21-year-old sociology major who stands facing away from the American flag during the playing of the pregame National Anthem before her collegiate games. Big deal. She did not begin doing this for notoriety. It was her quiet, private expression to herself of her own thoughts, her own ideas and moral judgments.  Things you'd want your own 21-year-old daughter to do.   What do you think?    Toni Smith has made her stand. Now tell us what you think about protests made in the sports arena by voting in our polls at SportsNation.     Her statement has been picked up, not by her, but by us, as the latest "controversy," cause celebre, political football; it makes her a pariah in some quarters, as the nation careens towards war. Reminds me in a way of 1968, a volatile year in which Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were killed, the body bags were coming back to Dover en masse as the war in Vietnam was going full tilt -- and we still held the Olympics in Mexico City anyway, late that summer.  So where else would you protest? Wherever you are.  We've all seen the pictures of Tommie Smith and John Carlos standing on the medal podium in black-stockinged feet, with their fists raised in a black-gloved salute. They were saying essentially what Toni Smith is saying -- people have died, people are dying, not all of them by noble means or for noble ends, and when will it end?    It must all end.   Mustn't it?      During a recent game, Vietnam vet Jerry Kiley stormed the court to confront Smith.    Well, actually, it doesn't have to, it never does, and social progress is made grudgingly, if at all, a precious inch at a time, just as the envelope of human endeavor is stretched in athletics, an inch at a time. When you are young, you want it to change all at once. It never does. Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord.    But what Toni Smith doesn't know, and I hope to God she never does, is that very often these protests end with the ostracizing of the protestors rather than the evils they protest. It is a testimony to Tommie Smith and John Carlos that they managed to survive being "blacklisted" from any work, a simple job, for the next 25 years, much less being tossed from the Olympic Games.   Toni Smith doesn't deserve that, nor, frankly, is she likely to have to endure it. She'll move on, and maybe she'll change and grow to accept Status Quo.  I hope to God she doesn't. I hope she always remembers.  Young people who major in sociology ask questions about historical matters like the 1968 Olympic Games, or the 1936 Olympic Games, or the 1972 Olympic Games, or the Trail of Tears, or any of a thousand atrocities, and the many wars that continue to occur. Young people who major in sociology are given pause once they learn and process the bloody history of this or any other "civilized" country.     Even a part-time player at little Manhattanville College can make her voice heard.    We live, love, learn. Even if we are athletes. Imagine that. To say athletes and sports are precluded from this process is, in fact, insulting, that a Tommie or a Toni Smith are like cattle and should just give their milk and moo and shut up and not have their own feelings. We should be proud of them. What they are doing is actually an act of love.   But we're not proud of them. I shouldn't say "we," because some of us are proud of them, or at least tolerant of their opinions. That's what all those people died for; freedom, tolerance, not cloth flags.    Just Tuesday in Orlando, Florida, a fossil of a man named Pete Barr, an out-and-out bigot known for spewing invective against blacks, Jews, women and everybody else within maximum effective range, without a mention of any of them ever being American, or patriots, lost in the city's mayoral race, but by only 5,000 votes. Over 17,000 people voted for his opponent, Buddy Dyer -- but over 12,000 voted for Barr. That's Sociology 101, too.  Yes, Toni, at times it's enough to make you turn away. But we all, including Toni Smith, have the precious right to vote; and the vote is the greatest social protest -- and right -- of them all. On some issues you don't get to post a ballot. In that case, you use the only bullet that should be used on another person -- one's own conscious act of social protest.     Kiley got booted from the gym after running onto the court.    But most of us seem to despise athletes for even thinking in the first place. So a grey-haired man named Jerry Kiley, who said he was a Vietnam veteran, ran onto the court with an American flag, ran right up to Toni Smith, seemingly as if to make her flinch, shrink away, to scream at her, to tell her she, not him, was a disgrace, to intimidate her.  Now was that admirable? Why? Who seemed cowardly? Who's the real red-blooded American in that picture, the athletic girl with a questioning mind and big heart who put her hands on her hips and stood there unafraid, or the old man running up to a young girl to try and bully her, his true intentions, his inner motivations, all covered up, wrapped inside and hidden away in an American flag? You tell me.  Toni Smith's statement was brief. To acknowledge those who have died for the country, you have to acknowledge those who died to claim it, then build it up. Agree or disagree with her method of illustration, her point is still lucid, logical, well-taken, and at the end of the day, irrefutable. Life will teach her its lessons. But she was born with the freedom to speak up. To tell her to shut up because she's "wrong," or because she's an athlete, or because this isn't the proper venue or time only increases the hypocrisy.  She's a smart girl. She knows this.  It's people like quiet Toni Smith, or quiet Tommie Smith, or quiet tennis champion Arthur Ashe, picketing outside of a South African embassy during the reign of apartheid, who give us the conscience and the respect we so often lack.  I don't feel Toni Smith isn't patriotic, or doesn't love America ... in fact ... well, my own words and talents are inadequate to explain what I sense here, so I will leave it to a better essayist than me. James Baldwin once wrote this:   "Societies never know it, but the war of an (artist or athlete) with a society is a lover's war, and (s)he does, at (her) best, what lovers do, which is to reveal the beloved to himself, and, with that revelation, to make freedom real ..."

      They were arguing in the car, as sons and mothers do, something about household responsibilities.    After years of hiding from his past, Ricky Williams is looking to confront his future.   Sandy Williams was 26 and recently divorced. Ricky was 6.  "It's not easy being the man of the house," said the son in a rare complaint to his mother, "when you're sish."  Sish? Too young to even pronounce his age. That hit Sandy right in the heart.  "You're just a little boy," she told him, "You don't have to be the man."  But, in the twisted scheme of things, he did.  While Sandy was working days and going to school nights in San Diego, Ricky took care of his twin sister Cassandra and Nisey, who was two years younger. Technically, Cassie was a minute older, but it was Ricky who had them ready every morning for the magnet school bus at the corner. He knew how to lock up the house and who to call in an emergency. He often cooked dinner -- noodles, mac and cheese, hot dogs and pork and beans -- he was a bear on homework and could really work those math flashcards. He was the one who taught Nesie how to read. He tucked the girls into bed, too, then waited up past 10 for his mother.  That was 20 years ago.  Today, Ricky Williams is still very much the man. His sense of duty and responsibility, forged so early in life, seems to know no bounds. There are nine NFL running backs with more yards than Errick Lynne Williams Jr., but none with more heart.  On Sunday night, all eyes will be on the Baltimore Ravens' Jamal Lewis, who can break Eric Dickerson's single-season record of 2,105 yards set 20 seasons ago. Earlier Sunday, Williams will labor in the relative obscurity of Pro Player Stadium, where his Miami Dolphins meet the New York Jets in an essentially meaningless game. The Dolphins' season is over -- the Denver Broncos snatched their playoff spot last week -- but Williams is expected to start his 48th consecutive game.  Williams has been beaten, bludgeoned and battered this season; he has touched the ball 418 times in the Dolphins' 911 plays (draw your own symbolic conclusions), which works out to nearly 46 percent of their plays.  It is an accepted maxim of sport that, in terms of degree of difficulty, hitting major-league pitching is at the top of the list. Consider, instead, the job of the NFL's featured running back. The real estate on the roughly 48,000-square-foot field is more precious than anything in midtown Manhattan or Beverley Hills. And that there are 11 rabid defenders intent on maiming the running back.  Williams' left shoulder is on fire, his knees throb, his ankles and hips ache. His back isn't feeling so hot, either. After 15 regular-season games, his psyche seems weary. His overmatched offensive line is, well, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. His average-per-carry is a meager 3.5 yards, the lowest figure among the league's top 17 running backs, but he has a chance to run away with a small piece of history. Williams has 372 carries through 15 games and if he gets the ball 28 times on Sunday against the Jets -- a realistic possibility -- he would become only the fifth NFL running back in 83 seasons of the league's existence to cross the threshold of 400 carries.  No one else in today's game -- not Deuce McAllister, Clinton Portis, Ahman Green, LaDanian Tomlinson or Priest Holmes -- can say that.  Dave Wannstedt, whose job as the Dolphins' head coach is tenuous at best, said on Wednesday that Williams would play Sunday against the Jets.  "We want to try to win this football game," Wannstedt said. "There's not a player on this team that says, `You guys win it, I'm going to watch.' That just doesn't compute in a guy's mind that's as competitive as Ricky is."  After he ran the ball 31 times on Thanksgiving against the Cowboys, Williams had amassed 54 carries in a two-game span over four days, which has to approach the threshold of human pain and suffering. Miami-area reporters asked Williams about the enormous load he was carrying.  "That's what I have to do and I realize that," Williams explained with a matter-of-fact tone. "This is my forte, what I'm known for in my career, that I can take a pounding. We'll see how much I can take. That's what I get paid to do."  An apt metaphor for his 26-year-old life: Taking a pounding. How much can he take? How much has he taken to reach his current destination?   See Ricky run. Run, Ricky, run. Seriously, that's the name of his web site: www.RunRickyRun.com.  Running to what? Running from what?  He comes wheeling, dreadlocks swinging wildly, across the line of scrimmage, 5 feet, 10 inches and 226 pounds of fury in choppy, clipped strides that belie his speed. What he's thinking, it is impossible to know. A helmet with a formidable cage is wrapped around his head and a dark shield covers his eyes. It is a mask few people penetrate.  Barry Bonds can be moody. Nomar Garciaparra is not always media-friendly. Alan Iverson has had his moments. Still, Williams is in a whole different dimension.  When asked if Williams would grant an interview for this story, Harvey Greene, the affable Dolphins senior vice president of media relations, responded this way: "I'll be happy to ask him, but getting Ricky on the phone is about as hard as trying to tackle him."  Sure enough, the answer was no.  "He was interested in the [rushing attempts] record, he knew about it," Greene said. "But the answer is no. I can't say I'm surprised."  Does anybody really know the enigma-wrapped-in-a-riddle that is Ricky Williams? Is it possible he is the least understood professional athlete of his remarkable ability?  "I'll call him and call him and he'll call back and say, "Ma, I haven't heard from you in so long,' " his mother, Sandy, says from her home in Austin, Texas. "He has this very dry sense of humor. You're never sure if he's kidding or not. I always ask, 'Rick, are you serious?'  "You have to ask, because most of the time he's not."  Shouldering the load  Back a few days ago, when the Dolphins' playoff chances were still viable, team doctor George Caldwell administered two injections of painkillers into Williams' painful left shoulder -- the first before last Sunday's game at Buffalo and the second during the first quarter after he fell on it.     Ricky Williams has taken his lickings over his career, but mostly has stayed a step ahead of opposing defenders.   A week earlier, he had been thrown to the ground after a season-high 45-yard gain against the Eagles and the pain in the shoulder that was surgically repaired last February had been immediate and intense. He received an injection and finished that game. Now, he would try to carry the Dolphins' thin hopes at Ralph Wilson Stadium.  "I've been doing it all year pretty much, and parts of last year," Williams said later. "It is something I have learned to [play with].  "It is not the funnest thing, but it is part of the game."  Williams ran the ball 29 times for 111 yards. He also caught three passes -- more than any other Dolphins player -- for three yards. Those 32 touches, in 57 plays, allowed Miami to control the ball in a 20-3 victory that, for the fleeting moment, left the Dolphins alive for the postseason with a 9-6 record.  "And he hates getting shots," Sandy said. "But he says, 'Ma, I need to do what I need to do to do my job.' People ask me if I like watching Ricky run. As a parent, I say I enjoy watching Ricky get up."  Cassie, speaking from her Oakland home, supported that notion.  "I definitely think he's just a persevering person, in all the things he does," his sister said. "Even growing up, he took on all those responsibilities -- and embraced them. Not only does he love the sport of football, but it's his profession. He's true to that."  The performance in Buffalo was the 17th 100-yard game for Williams in less than two seasons -- two better than the previous record of 15 by fullback Larry Csonka, who played in Miami for eight seasons.  In his 31 games with the Dolphins, Williams has touched the ball 848 times. Factoring his last two years in New Orleans into the equation, his production has bordered on the implausible:   Miami has run 1,921 plays over the last two seasons, which means Williams has gotten the ball, one way or another, 44 percent of the time.  Over the past four seasons, only Green Bay's Ahman Green has rushed for more yards (5,467) than Williams, who has gained 5,391 yards -- more than Priest Holmes (5,128) and Curtis Martin (5,027).  Only Green has more combined yards from scrimmage over the past four season (7,371) than Williams (6,959). Marshall Faulk, one of the most explosive offensive weapons in league history, has a total of 6,859 yards in that time. For all his success -- he won the Heisman Trophy in 1998 -- Williams has had little playoff success in five seasons in the NFL. The New Orleans Saints were 3-13 his rookie year of 1999. When the 10-6 Saints made the playoffs a year later, Williams missed the last six regular-season games and returned in a reserve role. He carried six times for 14 yards and caught one pass for two yards in a loss to the Minnesota Vikings. It has been his only playoff appearance.  When he was traded to the Dolphins after the 2001 season, it seemed Williams was the perfect fit on a team destined for great things. But Miami failed to make the playoffs last year and, again, this season. The last time the Dolphins missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons was when Williams was 12 years old and growing up in San Diego.  Miami Herald columnist Dan Le Batard, the media member who enjoys the closest relationship with Williams, started asking the "big, hard" questions after the Broncos defeated the Colts to eliminate the Dolphins from playoff contention.  "Will Ricky Williams, carrying the ball too much, taking too many hits and too many needles," Le Batard wrote, "suffer the same fate as Dan Marino, his excellence alone to always make the Dolphins relevant but never quite enough to end a three-decade drought?"  Hardly ideal  Childhood is rarely the idyllic experience we would like it to be.  To end her August 2002 profile of Williams in the Palm Beach Post, Karen Crouse used this quote:  "My mom taught me don't expect anything from anyone. That's reality. When people are whining that it's not fair, well, life's not fair. It's not supposed to be.  "I don't think fair is even a word. It's just an ideal."  It is a haunting world view, but that was his reality. For the public record does not pull any punches when it comes to the childhood of Ricky Williams.  He was born on May 21, 1977 in San Diego to Sandy and Errick Lynne Williams, Sr. In September 1983, when Ricky was 6 years old, his parents divorced. The beginning of the end came when Ricky told his mother something his father had insisted stay a secret between the two of them.  According to divorce papers filed in California, Errick Williams was accused of "inappropriate sexual stimulation" of the twins. Ultimately, the divorce settlement stipulated that Sandy be awarded primary custody of the three children. Visitation rights of the father were to be limited and supervised by the wife due to the fact that "the children are undergoing psycho-social assessment and treatment for suspected child abuse."  Errick Williams became a registered sex offender in California, based on a 1984 misdemeanor charge of annoying and molesting children. Victims are not listed on the registry, and court records were destroyed, as is practice, 10 years later.  In August of 1999, he pleaded guilty to felony theft after embezzling more than $20,000 from a Houston health-care facility. Williams served 90 days in jail, performed 350 hours of community service and was given 10 years probation.  "I've spent a lot of time trying to protect Ricky from that man," Sandy said.  Does Ricky's sometimes erratic behavior and social shyness stem from those alleged early episodes?  There was a long pause.  "I don't know," Sandy said, her voice very low. "I was talking to my ex-mother-in-law the other day, she's a psychologist. I mean, a kid that age can't go through that kind of trauma without some effect. It'll snowball.  "The counselors said they'd never, ever lead a normal life, that anything that happened would follow them the rest of their lives. My goal in life was to teach them to lead as normal a life as possible."  Errick Williams Sr. has remarried and has lived in recent years at addresses in both Houston and Spring Valley, Calif. He could not be reached for this story, but in 1998 he told Sports Illustrated, "Yes, there's a court record that says I sexually molested my children, but that record isn't true. When a woman gets up in front of a judge and says her husband abused the children, the judge is going to believe her.  "But I can stand before God and say that I didn't verbally, physically or sexually assault my children. This has devastated me."  In that story, Ricky Williams said: "I don't remember anything. That's the truth. I don't know what happened, because I don't remember. He's my dad. We get along OK."  Williams, according to those close to him, has renewed a cautious friendship with his father.  Proving them wrong  While there was often rage and confusion in his life, Williams was a different person in the arena of athletics. Sport was his gift, his source of confidence.  He ran for 2,099 yards and 25 touchdowns as a senior at Patrick Henry High School in San Diego. He played outfield and batted .340 and stole 26 bases. He wrestled as a heavyweight and qualified for the state finals in the 400-meter relay.     Williams set 30 NCAA records during his college career, but was unable to lead Texas to a national title.   As a freshman running back at the University of Texas, he was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies; he was two years younger than Deion Sanders and Bo Jackson when they went bi-sport. His coaches at Texas said he couldn't pull it off, but Williams said he could. He went on to play four summer seasons for the Phillies' Class A team.  When he had visited Austin on a recruiting trip, he gazed at Earl Campbell's Heisman Trophy behind glass and told then-head coach John Mackovic he better make some more room for his Heisman. His e-mail address at Texas as a freshman? Why, Heisman@UT.edu.  Naturally, he turned out to be as good as his World Wide Web address.  He finished with 6,279 rushing yards, 72 touchdowns and 20 NCAA records. He won the Heisman Trophy in 1998. He had dreamed of a national championship, but that was something the best player in the country couldn't control.  The New Orleans Saints essentially traded their entire draft to select him with the fifth pick overall in 1999. Even his bizarre, incentive-laced contract reeked of confidence. Negotiated by rapper Master P's No Limit Sports firm, it was a seven-year deal worth $68.4 million. That looked good in the newspapers, but $5 million of the $8.84 million signing bonus was deferred. Williams' annual salary was the rookie minimum, a paltry $175,000. He was sure he could gain 100 yards a game, so he put it in writing.  It only happened twice that first year, and so he reached only one of the 25 incentive clauses in his contract.  He was miserable in New Orleans. His behavior was often mocked in the media. For a time, he actually conducted interviews behind the shield of his helmet.  Early in 2001, when Williams saw something on television about social anxiety disorder, he saw himself. He had always struggled in social settings and now, he discovered, he wasn't alone. With help from counseling and the anti-depressant drug Paxil, Williams has grown less uncomfortable in those awkward settings.  When the Dolphins traded for him before the 2002 season, he was thrilled. The pieces seemed to be in place for an NFL title, his ultimate goal. Williams carried 383 times for 1,853 yards to lead the league in those categories. The rushing total was the eighth-highest in history, placing him among the greats -- Eric Dickerson, Barry Sanders, Terrell Davis, O.J. Simpson, Jim Brown and Campbell. He even made the Pro Bowl.  The playoffs, however, eluded the Dolphins.  Williams, ever the dreamer, looked ahead to the 2003 season. The Dolphins would add Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau in the offseason. The defense, already featuring Jason Taylor and Zack Thomas, would be suffocating. The offense had a chance to be better.  His mother could see the scenario: Super Bowl XXXVIII would be played at Reliant Stadium in Houston, just a 2#189;-hour drive from Austin. The Dolphins were a logical choice.  "Hey, I thought the Dolphins were going 15-1," Sandy said. "I blew it, didn't I? I pulled a Ricky. I believed it was going to happen."  Exacting a toll  Carrying the ball in the NFL hurts. Watch one play closely this weekend, close your eyes and imagine yourself taking the blow. Physics experts liken the violent impact of running back-linebacker collisions to cars crashing at 10-to-15 miles an hour -- without the car.  In 1998, Jamal Anderson carried the ball 410 times for the Atlanta Falcons, which stands as the NFL record.  "You go through everything," Anderson said this week. "I had a sprained ankle, a bad wrist that I jacked up with a brace, turf toe, hip pointers on both sides, (sore) shoulders.  "I took care of myself, sat in the ice bucket and got massages. I was lucky to stay healthy all season long."  Last year, Williams' total of 383 carries was 11th on the all-time list. With a typical load of 25 carries, his average this season, Williams would equal Gerald Riggs' fifth-place total of 397, posted in 1985 with the Falcons.  "He's doing a good job, trying to do his thing," Anderson said. "It's hard when everybody knows he has to run for them to be successful. Man, when everybody's coming at you ... We're the only guys on the football team where we get the ball and it's 11 guys converging."  After he set the record, Anderson suffered several knee injuries and played only 21 more games. James Wilder, No. 2 on the all-time list with 407 carries for Tampa Bay in 1984, suffered a similar end. His carries declined in each of his last six years: From 365 (1985), to 190 (1986) to 106 (1987) to 86 (1988) to 70 (1989) and 11 in 1990.     Williams knows 400 carries is a physical burden.  People are already wondering if Williams will follow the career trajectory of his fellow Longhorn, Earl Campbell. Campbell led the NFL in rushing his first three seasons, then slowly crept into obscurity. After averaging 313 carries in his first six seasons, he averaged 113 in his last four. Today he can barely walk.  Williams, interestingly, has averaged 313 carries in his first five seasons.  "He's a professional," Sandy said. "He takes care of himself through workouts and nutrition, the massages, and he does the chiropractor thing. When his body had had enough and tells his head, he'll say he's had enough.  "I would be surprised if it happened any other way."  Sister Cassie, too, is concerned.  "He's a resilient person, but, yeah, I worry about it. I'm always praying when I see him playing," she said. "When he stops playing football, I hope it's his decision, not because he needs two knee replacements or back surgery."  Sandy, searching for a story that will underline Ricky's capacity to dream, tells this one:  "He was 2 years old and we were watching the Padres on TV. He said, 'Mommy, when I'm big I'm going to be a baseball player and buy you a house and a truck.' "  Twenty-four years later, that's exactly how it happened. Her son bought her a house in Austin, a Dodge Ram truck -- and a Mercedes SUV. Sometimes, Sandy said, she just walks through the house with tears in her eyes at the wonder of how it has all turned out.  There are still times when Williams does not exercise the best judgment; sometimes he's still that 6-year-old kid. There was that magazine cover in the wedding dress with Mike Ditka. There was an arrest in Louisiana when he was clocked driving 126 miles an hour.  But make no mistake, he handles his responsibilities like a man.   "He's continued his role," Sandy said. "I say, 'Hey, I'm the mom -- you're not the daddy.'"  But, of course, he is.    He supports his two young children, daughter Marley and son Prince. He takes care of his mother. When Cassie wanted to pursue her Masters degree in fashion design in San Francisco, Ricky wrote the check. Same thing when little sister Nisey wanted to move to Orlando. He even supports his father and his new family of six. His goal is to still win a Super Bowl ring, but he has learned that some things are even larger than he is.  "If he doesn't win the Super Bowl in the next few years, I don't think it's happening," Sandy said. "He always gives his best and when it's time to go, he'll go, knowing that, no matter what happens.  "I'm not giving up on my Dolphins. The difference in my son, as bad as I want to win, is I'm happy to see him happy and progressing.  "As a mother, that's everything you could hope for."

      i love Breckenridge (and Dener newstation)  i'm here waiting for dinner and they run a report about cuba on the international news channel. I was about to flip it off, cuase i was amazed that even outside Miami people care abotu Cuba. But it was a damn good report.  It showed people inside Cuba giving realy opinions on how tehy feel about the Cuban REv. and Castro. they interviewed 5 people and 3 were pro castro, two aainst. one of the against was the guy who turned his truck into a boat.  The report had a lot of good points about Cuba, overall they did a 100 people survery and resutls were 61% Pro Castro,38% Con Castro, and the one loser who was undecided.  Again both sides said good points, including not being able to support yorself. but the oen thing that stuck in my mind was a 25 year old saying "The only people who complain arethose who jsut hang out or whatever, those with no jobs. thos that work have no problem." Ouch. Furthermore a 64 year old saying  " I remember when we had capitalismbefore Castro, it was such *beep* there was no point to it, now we can buy things at better prices and we're bette protected (From?)". Also "If i had to go and risk my babies life along with mine again i'd do it"  As always sopmeone is against the system, but teh amjority are ok wiht it.   Thsi is further proof that the idiots in Miami want to kill Catro, while people on the island, who actually live there are ok with it. Miami Cubans should calm down. When the man is hated IN the island it will be the end of him. The people are bigger than the government everywhere. It does not take another country to come in and kill him. If the cuban people wnated him out, he'd be gone. But they don't Same as the Iraquis.   Oh. And i just remembered this "People see the movies andonly see the good about the U.S. and tehy think everything is perfect, they need to come to reality" from teh 25 year old. i completely agree with that. Also if your in Miami there's no unbiased reporting it's all against Castro. If you look at it through nuetral eyes (and i'm nto saying i am) he's been a decent leader who in many ways has helped and in thres hurt hsi country. as all leaders do. Cubans need to learn that if Capitalism was around in Cuba, Castro would Still be in power. A Frightening thought indeed is it not? NOW CALM DOWN , I'M OFF TO THE SLOPES AGAIN! MEWWY X-MAS

      10) Miami (FL) vs. (9) Florida State  Brandy Read HERE  ORANGE BOWL PREVIEW  For the first time in six years, neither Florida State nor Miami is playing for a chance to win the national title. There is still plenty of incentive for the Seminoles to win the bowl game they are in.  The No. 9 Seminoles try to snap a four-game losing streak against their in-state and future conference rivals when they meet the No. 10 Hurricanes on New Year's night in the 70th Orange Bowl.   When Miami (10-2) beat Florida State (10-2) 22-14 on Oct. 11, the Seminoles' seniors became the school's first class in 15 years to lose four consecutive years to Miami.   If the Seminoles don't win Thursday, they will take that losing streak into next September's meeting, which will be their first as Atlantic Coast Conference rivals.   ``We're going to do whatever it's going to take to beat them,'' senior linebacker Kendyll Pope said. ``I've got to get at least one win before I graduate.''    Both teams are used to playing with more at stake. Florida State played in three straight national title games, winning one of them, from 1999-2001, while Miami won in 2002 and lost to Ohio State while trying to defend its title last year.   When the Hurricanes suffered back-to-back losses earlier this season, they hardly resembled that team, which won 34 straight games before its Fiesta Bowl loss.   The low point for Miami came in November losses to Virginia Tech and then-No. 7 Tennessee. Coach Larry Coker benched Brock Berlin after the junior threw 14 interceptions, fumbled three times and lost twice in the first nine games.   Berlin, who started as a freshman for Florida in the 2002 Orange Bowl, eventually regained his starting job and completed 61 percent of his passes and threw 12 touchdowns this season.   A season-ending injury to running back Frank Gore in October contributed to the decline in Miami's offense, as Coker had to rely on backups Jarrett Payton and freshman Tyrone Moss. Payton went on to lead the team with 876 rushing yards and seven TDs.   While the offense struggled, the Hurricanes relied on their superior defense, ranked third in the nation in total yards and fifth in scoring. Junior defensive back Sean Taylor's nine interceptions were tied for second in the country this season.   Miami regrouped to finish the regular season with a three-game winning streak and a share of the Big East title in its final year in the league.   ``It looks like they corrected whatever they needed to correct,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said.   The Seminoles also suffered injuries, including receiver Craphonso Thorpe's broken right leg Nov. 15 against North Carolina State. Thorpe had 51 receptions for 994 yards and 11 touchdowns before the injury. Without him, the Seminoles turned to P.K. Sam and Dominic Robinson.   ``They've lost an outstanding receiver, but they've had an opportunity to groom other players and get comfortable with their other players,'' Coker said.   Another favorite target of quarterback Chris Rix is receiver Chauncey Stovall, who caught a pair of touchdowns and averaged more than 17 yards per catch in 12 games this season.   Rix threw for 3,011 yards and 22 touchdowns this season and his 140.92 quarterback rating was third in the ACC. However, his two interceptions were part of Florida State's five turnovers in the regular-season loss to Miami.   Florida State was held to just 296 yards, well below its season average of 419.4.   ``I think we are a lot better now. We are playing more together as a team,'' Seminoles center David Castillo said. ``We made a lot of mistakes during the season and I think we have corrected those mistakes. We have guys at some key positions that have stepped up to the challenge.   ``Hopefully ... we will be able to show them we are a lot better team than we were in October.''   This will be the 48th meeting between the rivals, but the first in a bowl despite the Hurricanes appearing in their 30th and the Seminoles in their 33rd.   Miami leads the all-time series 27-20.  ______________________   (4) Michigan vs. (1) USC  ROSE BOWL!!!!   The Bowl Championship Series was supposed to end any chance of a split national title.  Then again, No. 1 Southern California wasn't supposed to go 11-1 after losing the Heisman Trophy winner, either.   But the loss of Carson Palmer couldn't stop the Trojans' run toward a national title, and a computer system won't be able to either if USC beats Michigan on Thursday in the Rose Bowl.   After three split titles from 1990-97, things were supposed to change with the start of the BCS. Yet, the No. 1 team in the polls didn't end up in this season's BCS title game, setting up the possibility of a split.   ``We're playing in the Rose Bowl with a shot at the national championship,'' USC coach Pete Carroll said Wednesday. ``You can't ask for more than that. I'm not frustrated at all.''      The Trojans, who have had an outstanding season despite the loss of Palmer to the NFL, are in good position to finish atop the AP Top 25 poll with a win over Michigan (10-2) because the top team has never fallen after winning its bowl game.   But USC has no shot at being voted first in the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, which is obligated to make the winner of the Sugar Bowl between second-ranked LSU and third-ranked Oklahoma its No. 1 team. The Sugar Bowl will be played on Sunday.   That sets up the possibility of college football's 11th split national championship -- something that was supposed to be eliminated when the BCS started in 1998.   A split title isn't quite the same as the outright one USC lost the chance to win when the BCS computers kept the Trojans out of the Sugar Bowl.   ``After playing 15 weeks you don't want to share the championship with anybody,'' said Kenechi Udeze, USC's All-American defensive lineman. ``I'm a firm believer that the championship should be decided on the field.''   The Trojans have won 26 of their past 30 games. They finished fourth in the nation last year and can win a national title for the first time in 25 years with a win against Michigan.   ``This is the granddaddy of them all,'' USC cornerback Will Poole said. ``We get to stay at home, our fans are here, and it's a great game against a great Michigan team. Whatever happened with the BCS happened. It was out of our control.''   It's a matchup of two of the most storied teams in the history of the bowl. This will be the seventh meeting between the teams in the Rose Bowl, with Michigan having won four of the contests. This is the first time the Trojans and Wolverines have met in the Rose Bowl since 1990, when USC won 17-10. Each team has won four games in the all-time series, including Rose Bowls.   With all the talk of a split national championship, some of the players for fourth-ranked Michigan believe they're being written off before the game even begins.   ``We take it personally,'' Michigan receiver Braylon Edwards said. ``I understand that a lot of people don't give us a chance to beat USC. They think it will be a cakewalk and we were lucky to be in this game. We're out to get some respect.''   When the game starts, the talk of the BCS and split titles will be overshadowed by the matchup between two of the most high-powered offenses in the nation.   Led by efficient quarterback Matt Leinart and game-breaking receiver Mike Williams, USC has topped 40 points in seven straight games and is sixth in the nation in scoring at 42.2 points per game.   Williams doesn't have breakaway speed, but uses his 6-foot-5 frame, basketball skills and strong hands to shield off defenders and make acrobatic catches. Williams has 87 receptions for 1,226 yards and 16 touchdowns.   Freshman LenDale White, a burly 6-2, 227-pound running back, leads USC with 738 yards and 13 touchdowns in his first year while sharing duty with Hershel Dennis and Reggie Bush.   Leinart said White's rapid development helped provide USC what it lacked -- a rushing game to balance the passing.   ``That was when we seemed to really start rolling, started to run the ball well, which helped the passing game, and started to score a lot of points,'' Leinart said.   Michigan has a similar offense led by quarterback John Navarre, Heisman finalist running back Chris Perry and a deep receiving corps. The Wolverines have scored at least 27 points every game this year and are ninth in the country in scoring at 37.2 points per game.   While he doesn't get the attention of some of the nation's more heralded receivers, Edwards had 75 catches for 1,031 yards and 14 scores this season.   Edwards looks to take advantage of a Trojans team that has been susceptible to the pass, allowing 276.7 yards a game, including 485 in the regular season finale against Oregon State.   Another day, another post.

KillerHurricanes: still dosern't hang up KillerHurricanes: keeps blabbling and laughing...i had to hang up shadowlight2002: lmao! KillerHurricanes: Fireworks    Christ they piss me off!   What the hell is the point. Apart from disturbing people who wanted to spend the night in the dry watching a ppv movie.   wankers wankers wankers   KillerHurricanes: Do you mean an organised display of a bunch of 15 year olds letting them off in the street?   KillerHurricanes: Neither oddly enough. Its a neighbour a street away. They seem to have a firework display for the opening of a bag of crisps.   They've just let off about 40 (I kid you not) identical shells one after another. Oh, as I type the second barrage is going off.   They seem to do it every couple of months all year round. KillerHurricanes: It's like Baghdad around here at present.   the heavy rain is obviously not putting them off. (must be the lack of cable tv!)   Sounds like WW3 here. Why don't they sod off?

       ABC   Abramovich: One day Chelsea were spectators looking on at a two-horse race, the next a billionaire Russian was buying them spanking-new bridles and bits so they could join the fun. Roman Abramovich spent over £100m, Chelsea became Chelski and the rest of the Premiership got worried.  Beckham: It was the year that Golden Balls finally left Old Trafford, hurried along his way by a flying boot kicked by Sir Alex Ferguson. He flaunted the scar and his club flaunted their prize asset around Europe. Real Madrid were the buyers, the medical was televised and the circus finally settled into a football show.  Cookie: The managerial revelation of the year, few gave Chris 'Cookie' Coleman much chance of keeping Fulham up or keeping his job. Instead, the Cottage-less Cottagers end 2003 in the top six and with their coterie of stars pledging to stay and keep them there. And he’s called Cookie. Which is cool.  Departures: Hailed as the Second Coming on his arrival at Spurs, Glenn Hoddle quickly proved he knew not whether he was coming or going. He was the highest-profile departure in a year that saw Leeds lose several and the very poor likes of Graham Taylor and Glenn Roeder being kicked into touch.  Elbow?: Sol Campbell swung his arm, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer went to ground like the proverbial sack of taties and the western world debated for what seemed like forever whether Sol had made contact or whether Ole was auditioning for a part in Falling Down II. The FA decided on the former and Sol's ban was cited as a major factor in Arsenal missing out on the Premiership trophy.  Forgetfulness: Rio Ferdinand skipped training without taking a drugs test. His excuse? 'I forgot'. Some saw this as proof of his drugs guilt while others saw it as proof that his ego was always far bigger than his brain. Cheating or just plain daft? An eight-month ban proved that the FA veered towards the former theory.  Goldfish: The horrible/tremendous excesses of Peter Ridsdale's disastrous reign at Leeds were revealed when debts of almost £80m were announced when Professor John McKenzie took over the chairmanship. Money had been frittered away on private jets, luxury cars and, most wonderfully, the leasing of goldfish for the directors' offices.  Handbags: The newspapers called it the Battle of Old Trafford but it was hardly worthy of the name. In September the Premiership's biggest rivals met and had a little falling-out. No punches were thrown (just a giant monkey leap) but Arsenal ended the year £275,000 and nine matches poorer for their part in the scuffle.  Istanbul: Would England get out alive? Would the fans be allowed to get in alive? They needed a single point to get to Euro 2004 and a single point is what they got. But it didn't end there - there was some nastiness from Alpay, some tunnel shenanigans shown on grainy footage and enough xenophobia to keep Prince Phillip in after-dinner conversation for a year.  Jay-Jay: One of the players of 2003, Big Sam Allardyce looked like he'd lost his mind as well as his moustache when he made the Nigerian his captain. The year ended with Sam begging (in vain) for him not to hotfoot it to the African Nations Cup. And Hoddle had turned him down for Spurs. Of course.  Kewell runnings: Despite talk of Arsenal and Manchester United, the Aussie winger was only ever going to join one club - Liverpool. But not before the player touted for £25m just two years ago had ensured that crisis club Leeds could only collect fourpence after percentages had gone to him, his agent and possibly the goldfish.   Liverpool: They won something in 2003, you know.  Monkey Heid: We knew Peter Reid was bad but his tenure at Leeds was nothing short of disastrous. After keeping them in the Premiership with fire, brimstone and hard graft, he proceeded to bring in a raft of players who could not give a monkey's. Frankly, they were rubbish. And Eddie Gray's successful tactic of getting rid of them all proves exactly that.  Number eight: That's what ManYoo were claiming in May - an eighth Premiership title of the 11 on offer since football began in 1992 (sorry, we've been watching too much Sky). It hadn't looked likely six months before but what's that old adage about form and class? Read it and weep, Arsenal.  Oval ball: England won the Rugby World Cup and were terribly polite in doing so - prompting a thousand articles entitled 'What football can learn from rugby' which handily forgot to mention that rugby could learn from football to be a little bit more, well, interesting.  Penalties: The only way an absolutely dire Champions League final was going to be decided. It was a game that prompted a re-think about goalkeepers coming off their lines at penalties after AC Milan's Dida was clearly halfway towards the opposition player every single time. But it helped his team be crowned champions of Europe. Was any team ever less deserving?  Qualification: The be-all-and-end-all for European countries this year as they bid to reach Euro 2004. England managed it but Wales and Scotland fell at the final play-off hurdle - the Welsh failing to perform against Russia and the Scots getting an absolute thwhacking by Holland after predictably getting all excited about beating them at home.  Roasting: It was the year of the roast. The new season brought a new term, which came to light after the alleged rape of a 17-year-old schoolgirl by Premiership footballers. Suddenly we heard and read nothing but tales of young girls lured into three, four, five, six, who-knows-how-many-in-a-bed romps with footballers. Called roasting, apparently.  Strike: Led by Citizen Neville, the England players stood up for the forgetful/stupid Rio Ferdinand and even took a vote on whether they should miss the vital clash with Turkey. Thankfully, common sense prevailed and they played in the game - but their relationship with the FA has taken a seemingly-permanent battering.  Turning the corner: According to Gerard Houllier, Liverpool have been on the verge of doing so all year - the Frenchman's stuck record not actually getting them any closer to greatness. They're still mediocre, still inconsistent and the fans are still calling for his head. The rest of us just got dizzy.   Unbeaten: Arsenal end 2003 without a defeat in the Premiership. Just be careful about predicting it will stay that way, Arsene.  Va Va Voom: Undoubtedly the best player in England in 2003, Thierry Henry is close to being the best in the world. At times he has been just beautiful to watch and almost impossible to play against. Only ManYoo fans can possibly find a reason to dislike him.  White lines: The year began with Bozzer being sacked by Chelsea for a positive drugs test and despite preposterous claims that his drink had been spiked by a nasty lady he was handed a nine-month ban by the FA. It ended with a fat Bozzer smoking cigars and claiming to be fighting an addiction while trying to sell videos of his naked supermodel ex-girlfriend. Lovely feller.  X-Rated: A challenge on Jamie Carragher from Lucas Neill that Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier described as 'cowardly' - conveniently forgetting some real horror 'tackles' by Steven Gerrard. Other culprits included Muzzy Izzet, Ashley Cole and the Russian bloke who floored Ryan Giggs.  Yellow: The future’s bright, and it might well be yellow. In a division with the likes of West Ham, West Brom, Ipswich and Sunderland, it is Norwich at the head of the pack. Not since the days of Jeremy Goss have things looked so good in Norfolk…  Zinedine Zidane: The best player in the world, apparently. Gooners tend to disagree.

      recap of my week Canes won have been very happy for myself the couple of days Last night i started doing research on this man, an i found him he's amazin,and as i reat hat i felt things start to change in me. I've noticed how already my thoughts from before have been backed up and how am starting to think a lot better. I'm thinking so clearly i've never seen things better than this but my advice is rejected NOW MORE THAN EVER.  My mother is been worse than ever out of nowhere for no reason, and somethings are changing my thought's are completely re arranging the case and trial of his man i've never felt anything like this i feel it in my hear tof hearts i feel it in my bones i feel such compassion for him   and i've never met him, let alone heard his voice.   I feel like Neo when he realizes the humans are just the batteries for the machines....The world you know is not as it seems, what you thought you understood is not true and anything you say do or view will be used against you. It's a world where right and wrong doesn't matter, only $$ and ambition. Corruption rules the world. Everything i've studied so meticulously has been true, and yet it's had so many more aspects that i haven't beeen able to see. My knowledge of people is the same, i can still predict 100% correct but i can no longer understand the system...for the system is nothing but buearocratic lies.  "They saw themselves as others had seen them. They had been formed by the images made of them by those who had the deepest necessity to despise them." -- James Baldwin, *Notes of a Native Son*   And no it's not James Baldwin but....Wow, if every American researched this and pulled out the true stats looks at why things are done as tehy are one would die.  Of course other than to get bitched at it's been impossible to contact brandy and her and my cousin are the only two whom i can sdiscuss things liek this with ___ i'm realizsing the more you analyze and think for yourself the more depressed you become, you see america's false propaganda on one side and the reality of it and then you see the complete darkness on the other. You realize how many problems you have and all of a sudden you feel like you need something, anything to cling on it. Everyone has one person/thing to use, but what do i have? I feel like i've lost everything, feel as if i was stillborn, all devoid of knowledge only with feelings but it's been a while since feelings told me something good  But they've always been right and am seldom incorrect..about 2.4% of them be incorrect actually.  anywyas this isn't about me feeligns, it's about this...how much injustice and rascism must be hidden by the U.S.? The people are kept ignorant and though our great nation is full of ignorant people we consider ourselves better than Cuba, USSR back in the day. I'd say we're just as bad.

      Right now, the American Empire is girding its loins for a War, based, at least in part on the alleged 'threat' posed by a Third World adversary - Iraq. Few seriously view the Ba'ath state a threat, but that's the rationale advanced to the American people.   What if there *was* a nation; one which was relatively close, and which was, not only, an avowed enemy, but which had staged traceable acts of war against your people, that resulted in considerable loss of life, and human suffering?   Well, the Cubans don't need to look far. Their 'avowed enemy' is the Collossus to the North -- the United States, which has not only threatened to do harm, but has done so, for virtually half a century!   The United States has admitted trying to kill the Cuban head-of-state, Dr. Fidel Castro, at least 11 times. It has invaded the nation, it has sown its soil with poisons, and spread contagion among its livestock (again, this is what the U.S. HAS ADMITTED TO DOING!).   Recently 5 Cuban nationalists were imprisoned in Miami, and charged with spying for Havana. In fact, the 5 were actively exposing and working to stop terrorist acts launched by Cuban exiles in Miami against their homeland. When they saw plots against their nation, they monitored them, and reported back to their people what was happening. The Cuban government promptly passed on the reports to the U.S. government, in a bid to stop the terrorism that has cost over 3,000 Cuban lives since the 1959 Revolution and until 1999. The U.S. responded to their reports, by rounding up the 5, and charging them, and treating them as spies.   They have been convicted of charges relating to their monitoring, and have been sentenced to terms of 15-years to life for defending their nation from terroristic attacks!   The U.S. insists that it has the right to stage a preemptive strike against a nation that has not attacked it (Iraq), and yet, it is wrong to defend one's homeland from further terroristic attack. That is illogical.   So, for over 33 months now, 5 Cubans, have languished in U.S. jails, separated like wheat from the chaff, all around the nation. They are more than the rallying cry, 'The Cuban 5': They are real human beings: Gerardo Hernandez, Fernando Gonzalez, Ramon Labanino, Antonio Guerrero and Rene Gonzalez. They committed no acts against the United States, nor monitored any American secrets. They entered the Miami exile community and observed the planning of acts of terrorism against the nation of their birth, and reported it. That is their 'crime.' Despite never participating in any terroristic acts, and indeed, preventing over 170 terrorist acts against the land of their birth, they have been consigned to U.S. Gulags. One wonders, is there really a War against Terrorism? For, if there is, how can it be furthered by the imprisonment of those who fought to stop it?   As for those in the Miami Mafia, the 'rabiblancos', as they are called (rabid anti-Castro Cubans), they have actively engaged in terror against the Cuban populace, but they have nothing to fear from the Americans, for the U.S. government indirectly supports and indeed funds their efforts.   People are organizing, around the nation to demand Freedom for the Cuban 5. Please contact them, and help give life to this effort. By so doing, you will be opposing terrorism, for real, and supporting an anti-terrorist group of people, who only want to defend their nation from foreign-backed aggression.   Free the Five!

        You're Most Like The Season Winter ...  You're often depicted as the cold, distant season. But you're incredibly intelligent, mature and Independant. You have an air of power around you - and that can sometimes scare people off. You're complex, and get hurt easily - so you rarely let people in if you can help it. You can be somewhat of a loner, but just as easily you could be the leader of many. You Tend to be negative, and hard to relate to, but you give off a relaxed image despite being insecure - and secretly many people long to be like you, not knowing how deep the Winter season really is.  Well done... You're the most inspirational of seasons :)    urlLink   ?? Which Season Are You ??     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Once again the Bush administration, speaking through a complacent media, is launching verbal bombs at a foreign country. This time it's Cuba.   In this age of media megamergers and sole superpower status, the media sometimes is a safe signal of underlying public policy. In other words, word wars sometimes become shooting wars. The media attack on Cuba is just the latest of the corporate media's disservice to its consumers. Therefore, while the media is most often used as a megaphone to amplify and project the voices of the wealthy and politically powerful, rarely does this same media honestly inform Americans of contemporary history.   Because of this, millions of Americans lack the context through which to analyze and understand the basis for confrontations between states. They're conditioned by the press to look at complex political and social issues through the lens of simplistic personalities. Therefore we speak of "Castro's Cuba" in the same breath as "Saddam's Iraq."   This is silliness. Conflicts between states are not personal, they're economic. The U.S. supported a brutal Batista dictatorship there for almost a decade before Cuban rebels drove the regime out. The U.S., which loves to boast about its "human rights campaign," has supported the most brutal butchers and dictators in the world.   Why? Because dictators use their police and armed forces to oppress their own people, to insure that the U.S. had free reign of the nation's natural resources. Is there any other reason why the U.S. would support butchers like Batista? Did they give a damn about human rights then?   In Africa, the first Bush administration didn't support Nelson Mandela. It was General Mobutu, who named himself Zairian president for life, whom papa Bush called, "Our best friend in Africa." Human rights?   What is a human right? The right to an education? In the United States over 20 million people are functionally illiterate. Higher education is available for those who can afford it, but for millions of people college is far too expensive. In Cuba, the right to an education is free, from kindergarten to a doctoral degree.   Education for millions of children in American inner cities is a scandal, as reported by Jonathan Kozel in his book, "Amazing Grace." Buildings are literally falling down. Windows are broken. Teachers are ill paid and badly prepared. For millions of children in the wealthiest nation on earth, education is an unobtainable illusion.   What about the human right to health care? In the U.S., you can obtain excellent health care if you can afford it. Cuba, meanwhile, boasts the largest number of doctors per capita on earth. They provide medical care to people all around the world. Indeed, there are more Cuban doctors working in other countries than the UN's World Health Organization. Millions of men, women and children in this country have no medical insurance and no real prospect for decent medical care.   And what about the human right of freedom? When the racist regime in South Africa was waging terrorist attacks on the so-called front-line states in the region, Namibia suffered numerous incursions and cross-border attacks. Cuba sent her soldiers thousands of miles to fight the South Africans and stop them at Cuito Cuanavale. That battle proved a turning point, and paved the way for the demise of the apartheid government, the unbanning of the African National Congress, and the freedom of Dr. Nelson Mandela.   Whom did the U.S. support during this conflict? The racist government in South Africa. Where was American concern for the human rights of millions of Africans, both inside and outside of South Africa?   That said, this commentator opposes the use of the death penalty. It is barbaric and oppressive. But there is a world of difference between how the Americans have used it, as a legalized form of lynching, and how Cuba has had to resist U.S. economic, political and media terrorism. The U.S. uses it to repress, Cuba uses it in self defense. The U.S. uses it to preserve white privilege, Cuba to survive as a state against U.S. aggression.

      If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days you would have produced enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee.  (Hardly seems worth it.)    If you farted consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough gas is produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb.  (Now that's more like it!)    The human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out to the body to squirt blood 30 feet.  (O.M.G.!)    A pig's orgasm lasts 30 minutes.  (In my next life, I want to be a pig.)     A cockroach will live nine days without its head before it starves to death. (Creepy.)  (I'm still not over the pig.)    Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour.  (Do ! not try this at home...... maybe at work.)    The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is attached to its body. The female initiates sex by ripping the male's head! off.  ("Honey, I'm home. What the....?!")    The flea can jump 350 times its body length. It's like a human jumping the length of a football field.  (30 minutes... lucky pig... can you imagine??)     The catfish has over 27,000 taste buds.  (What could be so tasty on the bottom of a pond?)   Some lions mate over 50 times a day.  (I still want to be a pig in my next life...quality over quantity)    Butterflies taste with their feet.  (Something I always wanted to know.)    The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.  (Hmmmmmm........)    Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer  than left-handed people.  (If you're ambidextrous, do you split the difference?)   Elephants are the only animals that cannot jump.  (OK, so that would be a good thing....)    A cat's urine glows under a black light.  (I wonder who was paid to figure that out?)   An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain.  (I know some people like that.)   Starfish have no brains.  (I know some people like that too.)   Polar bears are left-handed.  (If they switch, they'll live a lot longer.)   Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure.  (What about that pig??)  When you lick a stamp, you burn 0,1 calory. That means you have to lick 5134 stamps to burn a bigmac.

      One day in the great forest a magical frog was walking down to a  water hole. This forest was so big that the frog had never seen  another animal in all his life. By chance today a bear was  chasing after a rabbit to have for dinner.   The frog called for the two to stop. The frog said, "Because you  are the only two animals I have seen, I will grant you both  three wishes. Bear, you go first." The bear thought for a  minute, and being the male he was, said, "I wish for all the  bears in this forest, besides me, to be female."   For his wish, the rabbit asked for a crash helmet, and  immediately put it on. The bear was amazed at the stupidity of  the rabbit, wasting his wish like that.   It was the bear's second turn for a wish. "Well, I wish that all  the bears in the next forest were female as well."   The rabbit asked for a motorcycle and immediately hopped on it  and gunned the engine. The bear was shocked that the rabbit was  asking for these stupid things, after all, he could have asked  for money and bought the motorcycle.   For the last wish the bear thought for awhile and then said, "I  wish that all the bears in the world, besides me, were female."   The rabbit grinned, gunned the engine, and said, "I wish that  the bear was gay."   _________________________________ how do u fit 4 gay guys on a bar stool? - turn it up-side-down ______________________________________________________________________ 3 blondes are on a desert island.

      We are all different. We all have different tastes in music, women, men and trousers. We all support different teams. We are utterly and totally divided politically, socially and financially. Splintered into a million shards of antagonistic and opposed perceptions and  attitudes, a lot of them uninformed and based entirely on assumption and bigotry. And that's just the BBC.   For example, I know people who worship at the alter of Kylie's beauty but to me she's like a sexless boy. No stirring in the loins here.  There are people who don't like a good bhindi bhaji but they are insane to me. How can you not like any form of curry?   A recent poll of the best albums of all time included something by Robbie Williams in the top 10 - how could anyone be some dumb to think that? Haven&rsquo;t they heard any Van Der Graaf Generator albums?   However, I have discovered the one thing which binds us all together. The thing that everyone likes. That no one dislikes. That everyone is happy to see on a daily basis. It comforting, flexible and has universal appeal.  It is of course, the potato.   No one hates potatoes. No one is allergic to them. Everyone loves the humble spud. There's nothing not to like about potatoes. They come in all shapes, sizes and colours - those haemorroidal purple ones are especially good fun. Eating them releases calming, relaxing endorphins. And of course if you're going on the piss, the very best thing to consume before doing so is a huge pan of buttery mashed spud. It will soak up all everything you throw down your neck and make you able to drink as much beer as the proper big men.  You can do so many things with them. They're the ultimate compromise vegetable. When in doubt, serve potatoes. Even those strange people with the breath of dragons that will eat no vegetables, will still find room for a tattie. Geese even love them. As do dogs and blackbirds. And then of course, there is poccine which has made many a man actually blind.  'He's writing about potatoes' I hear you thinking. What's he telling me about potatoes for? Where does the interface between football and a maris piper lie?   Well, here it is. I'm searching for the football equivalent of the potato. Something which we can all agree we like. I was listening to someone slagging off Houllier and Ferguson on the radio in such extreme terms that it was as though they were war criminals. It sounded like he was laying off all the pressure and angst in his own life onto these two blokes who he doesn&rsquo;t know and probably will never even meet. He was using them like an emotional sponge to absorb all his own inadequacies and fears.  This can't be the only way can it?  It all seemed so inappropriate and extreme. Surely we're not so divided are we? There must be something that unites the football fraternity. Something we can all rejoice in. Some thing that gives us all pleasure.  But you know what? I can&rsquo;t find anything at all. Think about it. Anything specific to a team divides supporters straight away. Anything to do with national teams likewise.   Even specific players are controversial. I love Paolo DiCanio but I know others who think he's a waste of good sideburns and self-indulgence personified.   A lot of people think Henry is the best player in the world but I'm not so sure. I'd like to see him playing for a couple of years in Spain and Italy before saying that. Wearing gloves and doing crap goal celebrations after you knock a few in past Wolves or Middlesbrough is no qualification of greatness.  The play-offs - I like them. They're great for keeping the season alive. I'd like to see them extended. Others hate them because you can finish 30 points off the lead and still get promoted.  The Home Internationals. Doesn't everyone want them brought back? No. They'd clog up the fixture list. Clubs wouldn't want to release their best players, they'd be devalued and anyway who wants all the violence, ginger wigs and Burberry caps that the Scotland/England match brings.  High scoring games are great aren&rsquo;t they? Yeah, sometimes but watching Arsenal stick six past Southampton gets boring after the 4th goal because it&rsquo;s all so predictable and inevitable.  It's right that the National Stadium should be in the capital city. No it bloody isn't, we don&rsquo;t even need one and if we did, it should be near to most of the people which means somewhere off the M69 not in that open air toilet off the North Circular called Wembley?  Referees are useless prima donnas. True, but would you really want to be the one to spot the difference between a genuine trip and a Pires dive in the box in front of 35,000 people?  So what are we left with that we all agree on? What can we unite around.  This is it. The Ball is round.    What else is there? Nothing. Football separates us on almost every level. A non-football lover said to me today that one of the reasons she couldn&rsquo;t enjoy football was because everyone seemed to hate everyone else so much. The whole thing is so full of bad vibes and antagonism and tension.   I couldn't disagree and then suddenly I realized that it was exactly this fact that is our collective potato dinner. The only thing we agree on is that was disagree on everything. And it&rsquo;s this factor which binds all of us football crazies together. Perversely, it is only in disharmony that we find unity.   Which is a bit confusing but kind of far out really, isn't it?

      Claim:   The Tommy Tutone song "Jenny (867-5309)" drove the phone companies (and their customers) nuts.  Status:   True.   Origins:   The   1980s produced a number of one-hit wonders, including the infamous Tommy Tutone and its 1982 hit song "Jenny (867-5309)." This San Francisco band led by Tommy Heath and Jim Keller doesn't appear to have made much of a mark on the music world, and it likely wouldn't now be remembered were it not for the furor raised by its use of a phone number in its one memorable song.   In "Jenny," a young man laments not having the courage to dial a number found scribbled on a wall but finds  some comfort in the notion that he can someday call this girl and sweep her off her feet. Though not explicitly stated in the lyrics, it's strongly implied the name and number were harvested from a bathroom wall, which also implies "Jenny" is a gal of easy virtue and is to be had for the price of a phone call.   "Jenny (867-5309)" caused nothing but grief for telephone customers unlucky enough to have that combination of numbers as their own. Its relentless chorus, "Jenny don't change your number - eight six seven five three oh nah-eeh-ah-ine," pounded the phone number into the minds of teenagers everywhere, resulting in waves of kids dialing it and asking for Jenny. The joke quickly became old for those who had the number and weren't interested in talking to horny teens.   Even as recently as 1999, phone customers unlucky enough to have been assigned an 867-5309 number were still getting plenty of crank calls. An article from Brown University's newspaper explained what happened when the school added an 867 exchange in the fall of 1999:    The biggest complaints about the new phone exchange come from Nina Clemente '03 and Jahanaz Mirza '03, the two students with the telephone number 867-5309.  "It's so annoying," Nina said. "It's the worst number to have in the world."   The girls receive an average of five "stupid" messages every day on their machine, in addition to a slew of hang-ups.   "It's as if they are really expecting Jenny to pick up the phone," Clemente said.   Unfortunately, the problem is not getting better, and people just keep calling. Some ask for Jenny, some play the Tommy Tutone song on the girls' answering machine, and some males even leave their phone numbers in hopes of finding a date.       Whether there was a real Jenny with that very phone number is debatable. Those who attempt to dial 867-5309 on a touch-tone phone will quickly discover that this seemingly random combination of seven digits forms a consistent pattern as tapped out on the pad. The upward diagonal of "8-6" is followed by "7-5-3," the upward diagonal to the left of it, which in turn is followed by "0-9," yet another upward diagonal, this one to the right of the original starting sequence.   The song gave rise to its own lore, which asserted that the "Jenny" in the song was the lead singer's real-life girlfriend (or ex-girlfriend):    [Collected on the Internet, 2000]  I heard a more elaborate story that the number actually belonged to one of the band member's ex-girlfriends (named Jenny, of course) and that he wrote the song to get back at her for dumping him. She supposedly got a restraining order taken out against him and won a court order to have the song pulled from the airwaves for a while, etc. etc.       Other explanations leave off her suing the songwriter but have her becoming angry with him and changing her number (which, ironically, is the one thing the song begged her not to do). In another flavor of the tale, the band is sued by a sheriff who had both a daughter named Jenny and the notorious 867-5309 as his home number.    "Jenny" has had a breath of new life breathed into it by the Goo Goo Dolls, a popular band who debuted in 1987 but only began to hit their stride in 1998. Though they've yet to record a cover of "Jenny," the Goo Goo Dolls have often included a rendition of it in club appearances.   Barbara "jenny, they done dizzied you up" Mikkelson   Sightings:   "867-5309 (Jenny)" serves as the centerpiece for a 2004 Cingular television ad touting number portability.

      I've noticed it's back. The swagger. The Hell raiser. The 3:16, cause sonte cold said so in me is back, and I have a more expanded vocabulary this time to abuse people with. It shall come into plain view soon, my violent side is back, i think that's what Hanson did to me. I'm gonna drive my points home, Odette said something that caught my attention yest, well a pair of them.  1. Brandy really loves you, you can tell how? Well when i'm bitching about you, cuase i'm your big sister of cuorse (Me:whore) i go, he's such a pain int he ass (Me: i know i am) and Brandy goes "i know but i love him either way". that kinda is stuck on the back of my mind  and then 2. is   O:Brandy's parents like you, asshole Me: how do you know O: Cause her mom goes, we should invite Franco over...blah blah Me: and what does Brandy say? O: well Brandy goes, no i talk to ihm everyday, and i never get to see Odette.  odie later went on to say how her dad likes me too. that pissed me off some more. not htat her parents like me (they all do damnit) but that Brandy has enough balls to say some stupid shit like that. Yeah you talk to me everyday, and you talk to odie, every two days? You never see Odie?You see her almost every fucking weekend you fucking cunt, pull that shit out of your ass. When did you last see me? Aug. 19. 03, 7:21 P.M. yeah that's right i still remember. Do You know how much that fucking hurt? How much sting that zapped out of me? Do you care? Odette couldn't tell because of course i'm the greatest actor this fookin planet has ever known. I nearly broke down crying on teh phone when odie said that, a= just as when i called brandy to scream at her, i was already tearing apart.  But of course they don't recognize that because their not use to it. well too bad jackass.   and a third thing brandy related stuck to me:  O:It's funny how when everyone's leaving Brandy or moving awway from her a little even me, there coming to you.  this emphasizes two points  One something is turning Brandy into some asshole, or asomethings turning her screw loose, but she's even pushing odie away a bit (also said  by Odie : "I agree with you but i don't want to tell her anything because i've never really had a fight with her and i don't want to."  To leave in fear and quietly is to not live at all .)  And it just proves, exactly how alike am I to Brandy, seriously? it pisses me off, i've turned into the leader in a lot of cases of peoples lives.  When did I begin to be so damned trusted? as soon as Brandy left, do i seem to be the Male Brandy?  W.e. people are going to start smelling my new attitude and as soon as they get a whiff their gonna eitehr stick around for the long haul or bail. An angered freak is not one to fuck with, from 3rd to 7th they found hout and in 9th i remind.

        Cunning. Through use of many of life's faculties, you've managed to suceed greatly. It may not seem so to many, but isn't the the point most times? It's only a matter of knowing more then the others, right? I'm scared of people like you, but in the same time, admire the ability to see more then just the big picture; you see yourself in it every time. You survived the end by knowing who to knock down so you got that last spot in the bunker... nicely done.    urlLink   How would you survive the end of the world?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I need a strategy for this one and i'm not thinking in the right frame of mind, i feel like killing someone, anyone and there's not muhc (sofia) holding me back from killing myself...not a good show, but i won't, because i'm angry and i'll be strapped to apole and ass fucked by micheal jackson before i die angry.  I think me and Elga are correct, i shouldn't have to stand this shit from Brandy everytime she likes a different guy, and yet again i go on this stupid shit angry because 1. she won't listen 2. i know i'm right and 3. she decides to put the other person over me. She did it with piggy, mike, and now esteban, and i won't stand for it, i won't let this one happen again. I've heard some cgruesome crap abuot this asshole and i shall never let her date this one. By then i will have beaten him to a pulp of his life and i will put a bullet through my sad pathetic little brain. I'm pissed as few times before, because i'm back to where i was in 8th in many ways...I'm ignoring Brandy, i'm ignoring Naty, and i'm barely talking to odie, that's the set of action i've decided to uptake for now, ni fact i think i'm jsut going to block brandy out from anything in general. The faster i get rid of ehr the better, her memory is quickly turning this into a mini anne, and a mini soraya, i'm headed for that path and i won't let it. funny how the people i care the msot about go away, mostly because of some shit fuck ...... error?.....Money,  Distance and in this one Distance/Personality. I love her but i could give a shit now.  Odette and me are maybe as lose as ever before, i need tos eperate from there too, and I have to find a new set, a better one than i had before, judging as how i've spent two years over seeing this people, three somewhat looking out for Brandy and i get treated like some fourth class bitch? I shall not allow it. change is neccessary. It has begun

       urlLink YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS     Like Watching A Plane Land  To anyone who wonders how Sky Sports News fill 24 hours of television, witness their ten-minute long, interminable coverage of the Middlesbrough plane landing at the airport on Sunday night: "And there you can see that light in the sky and it's getting bigger and nearer all the time..."  And then when it finally did land: "That's the sweet sound of success."  No, that's the sound of desperation.    Beckham: A Cultural Exchange  Sky Sports presenter after Real Madrid's 4-2 win over Celta Vigo: "What did the manager say to you at half-time?"   David Beckham: "I didn't understand most of it - it was in Spanish."

      Tokyo, Japan (HLN) – Nokia Corp., the world’s largest mobile phone maker, announced it will release a cell phone that doubles as a stun gun.  The Protector 9600, which will run on both the GSM and CDMA networks, is being hailed by the Finnish cell phone giant as the next evolution in smartphones.  “Not only will you be able to talk to people, take pictures and send text messages,” said Nokia chief executive Jorma Ollila, “now you will be able to protect yourself in a humane and legal way.”  The gun part of the phone disables offenders with a 50,000-volt shock and fires a cartridge with two probes that attach to skin or clothing from five to 10 away, discharging a shock that incapacitates the recipient, but has no long-term effect.  The Protector will run on the Symbian OS, an open-standard system for date-enabled mobile phones. In mid-February, Nokia became the majority stockholder in Symbian, the leading smartphone OS.  “We have no problem with the Protector running our software,” said Symbian chief executive David Levin, after controversy erupted after the debut of the phone at the 3GSM world congress in Cannes, France. “If a consumer can be responsible with a cameraphone, I see no reason why they can’t handle a stun gun.”  But not everyone feels the same.  The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says it is studying whether or not the device is safe for consumers to use without a license. According to their website, the phone is currently being tested on people of various height and weight, including children and animals.   “If people want to talk on the phone and stun people at the same time, that’s their business,” said CPSC commissioner Mary Sheila Gail, “We just want to make sure [the phone gun] is safe, and if that means requiring the consumer to get a license, then so be it.”  The cell phone will be available in Japan just in time for the 2004 holiday season, says Nokia Corp. Pending government approval from both communication and product safety agencies, the phone will debut in Europe and North America some time in 2005.

      ok this pisses me off. I'll be the first to admit Evanscence lyrics are good. But does eery girl circa my age have to lsiten to sucha  shit band withs uch pussy music, such average vocals?! Jsut becauser the lead singer is a chick (with the name of a hick) doesn't mean their the "geratest band in like history!" Let me get somethign straight  Their riffs are shit, their drummer si crap, their bass is the only decent sound. The songs are mirror images of one another with the sound variation being very minimal, the guys in the band are all gay. Their hooks are horrid, despite their lyircs being the best of the pop rock scene. This was a band made to appeal straight out to that 11-15 year old audience who are reaching or beginning puberty, have found an interest in guys and have been crushed. This is the basic ploy attempted by ALL their songs, with a sound that's limited at times to obnoxiously bad  guitar solos, they retrack some of their songs because their not skilled enough to go a full 5 minutes wihtout fucking up. Their CRAP. Thank you.

      KillerHurricanes: me to my friend : "Marriage" is for a man and woman, so they should the gay version something else like "Garriage." That'll settle it for both sides.  shadowlight2002: lmao KillerHurricanes: more of me: "  Talking of Jesus (earlier) he only used to hang out with men. He loved his mother, who according to him was a virgin.  Oh and he never married.    All sounds a little gay to me.  " shadowlight2002: lmao KillerHurricanes: Franco Caliz: Man Of Genius

      Just when you thought Mel Gibson couldn't make a bigger turd than "Lethal Weapon IV",  he drops this one.  And all of the Jews are pissed off because he's telling everybody that they killed God.  Now let's think about it.  That's not so bad is it?  I would think the Jews would want this movie highly circulated in the Muslim world, with the obvious threat being, "If you guys don't back off, we'll kill your God, too.  Then you get no 70 virgins, no paradise, no nothing." Anyone who can kill God is one bad mother fucker.  But let's not forget that Jesus rose from the dead AND ascended to a throne in heaven.  Not too shabby.  So in essence, nobody really "killed" Jesus; it was more like a fraternity hazing, or an early version of "Fear Factor" where you endure all kinds of shit to win a valuable prize.  Way to go Jesus, and way to go Jews for  helping him keep it real.  The President wants to make a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage?  Hey Georgie, I think you've got enough on your plate right now... what with the war, and the economy.  Why don't you leave those nice people alone and let them pick out their china patterns (and ass fuck) in peace.

      Oh yea, I lost a sock doing laundry...I wonder where they go. It's one of those big mysteries of life. I WILL find out where socks run off to when people do their laundry before I die; I shall do an investigative report. It would be cool if I can use one of those tracking devices the police use in movies and put it on a sock and then discover where the sock goes and then I picture it will lead me into this sub-world of SOCKS! and all the socks ever lost would be piled up in mounds like the gold in the caves of Aladdin and then I could play in the socks as if they were big heaps of leaves, which I've always wanted to do! Ahh...only in my dreams.  For now, I have a lonely, solitary sock. If anyone has seen him, let me know. He's big, long and white (lol...IT'S A SOCK PEOPLE, remember that) and she needs her mate!

      Something strange happened after Super Bowl XXXVIII. Apparently, I became a Yankee fan.   There weren't any overt signs. I didn't grow a wispy mustache. My IQ didn't drop 45 points. I wasn't buddies with anyone named Vinny or Joey Z. I didn't think Mattingly was a biblical figure. I wasn't dating anyone who chewed Jolly Ranchers and looked like Paula Jones.      Are Patriots fans starting to become spoiled like Yankees fans?   But I sounded like a Yankee fan. At least that's what everyone was saying after my post-game column on ESPN.com. This was different than the first Super Bowl. Like most Patriots fans, I was more relieved than euphoric. That's what happens when your team improbably emerges as the favorite. You just hope they don't screw things up. But now I was thinking "big picture," even getting a little greedy. Here's what I wrote: "You want to keep winning. You want to make history. You want everyone to remember this team, this particular group of guys. You want to protect your turf. Every time someone tries to come along and take it, you want to fight back. You won't lose. You can't lose." And then: "Anyone can win one championship. Few teams can keep coming back for more. And that's what I want -- for the Patriots to reach that point. I want true greatness. I want immortality."    I liked the column when it posted. Captured my feelings to a T. Then the e-mails started pouring in: hundreds and hundreds of them, mostly from Yankee fans, all saying the same things: Welcome to the club. Now you know how we feel. Do you realize you just described what it's like to be a Yankee fan?  After the 500th e-mail, I started to lose the sight in my right eye. My god, they were right. I read the column again. I read it three times. I read the offending passages. Made me sick to my stomach. I sounded like an insatiable bastard. I sounded like a Yankee fan. I mean, I sounded just like a Yankee fan. I felt like I had just inadvertently joined Al Qaeda.   I immediately called my father, who felt just like me: giddy about No. 2, hungry for more. I asked him if we were turning into Yankee fans. Was Bob Kraft a kinder, friendlier Steinbrenner? Was Brady our version of Jeter, the poster-boy superstar everyone envied? Would we become spoiled, lose any and all perspective, become obnoxious and overbearing? Would other football fans instinctively band against us? Was it possible -- just asking, but was it possible -- that Yankee fans weren't that bad, that we were just jealous of their good fortune? Dad thought about it for a second.   "I don't know," he said finally. "Yankee fans are pretty awful."   As always, he was right. For instance, my Uncle Ricky is the resident Yankee fan in my family. He's my mom's brother, but we're pretty sure he was adopted. Anyway, he sent me a Christmas present this year, a framed "Curse of the Bambino" montage with pictures of Dent's home run, the ball rolling through Buckner's legs and Boone's homer against Wakefield. It was either funny or evil, depending on your mood. Merry Christmas. Right now it's sitting in my closet, next to my signed Buckner-Mookie baseball, another holiday gift from Uncle Ricky. These are the things Yankee fans do.   Here's my point: I would never do something like that. And that's the difference between Yankee fans and everyone else. They delight in tweaking their rivals, seeing other fans miserable, pushing everyone's buttons. They honestly believe that supporting a champion makes them better than everyone else. They are never happy, no matter how well the Yankees are doing. And they talk so much smack, you root against them almost as much as you root for your own team. Not only are they the resident bully, they like it that way, as their insufferable chest-thumping after the A-Rod trade proved once again.   One of my readers once compared rooting for the Yankees to rooting for the house in blackjack. We obviously have not reached that point with the Pats. If they capture 15 Super Bowls over the next 40 years, maybe things will change for me. Maybe winning isn't enough. Maybe you even get bored. Maybe you have to mess with everyone else just to stay interested. In a weird way, I hope I never find out what it feels like.

       'Happy' The New Good?  Having tried out (and succeeded with) the triumvirate of 'good', 'great' and 'honour', Beckham  has added to his vocabulary...  "I wouldn't have thought that I'd leave Manchester United. But to be where I am now and to be playing the football I am now and to be happy...I had so many happy years at Manchester United and now I've had a happy six months in Madrid and, I hope, a happy few more years there........ But he's [Michael Owen] a Liverpool player and as long as he's happy there and scoring goals, then he'll stay there."  But is he happy?   that was yesterday, now today. ____________________________  After trying out 'happy', David Beckham reverted to his tried-and-tested favourite 'good' in a post-match interview with Sky Sports on Wednesday night...  "...we played some good football at times. They've got some very skilful players and we've had a good workout. It's another good result really - but the important games come in the summer. We played some good football..."  Good.

      I want to go into politics....  looky...i'm researching stuff and...  http://elections.co.miami-dade.fl.us/qualinfosum.pdf  all the qualificatios for florida _________________________ What are the residency requirements for candidates?   Representatives in Congress -- need to be residents of the state when elected. State Legislators -- need to be residents of the district when elected. County offices -- see DEO 94-04.   I am registered as a Democrat or Republican. Must I register without party affiliation to be a nonpartisan candidate?   No. Any registered elector may have his name placed on the ballot at the general election without party affiliation (Section 99.0955(1), F.S.).   Must I appoint a campaign treasurer and designate a depository before I make public my intention to run for office?   No. Section 106.021, F.S., provides that a person must appoint a treasurer and designate a depository prior to qualifying for office, obtaining petitions, accepting contributions or making expenditures. Nothing in this section prohibits a person from announcing his intention to become a candidate prior to appointing a treasurer, so long as no expenditures are made in connection with that announcement and no contribution is received.   I am a candidate for County Court Judge. Where must I file my appointment of campaign treasurer, and where must I qualify?   You must file the appointment of campaign treasurer and designation of campaign depository with the local supervisor of elections in the county where you reside. You must also qualify with your local supervisor of elections during the qualifying period (Section 105.031, F.S.).

Any time after the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January of the year in which the first primary is held, but prior to the 21st day preceding the first day of the qualifying period for the office sought, once the oath is filed (DS-DE 15) Affidavit of Alternative Method.    That's for florida

      You are a Scouser, An ugly Scouser, You're only happy, On Giro day. Your mum's out thieving, Your dad's drug-dealing, So please don't take my hubcaps away.       You look in the dustbin for something to eat, You find a dead rat and you think it's a treat, In your Liverpool slums In your Liverpool slums, You shit on the carpet, you piss in the bath, You finger your grandma, and think its a laugh, In your Liverpool slums. In your Liverpool slums, You speak in an accent exceedingly rare, You wear a pink tracksuit and have curly hair, In your Liverpool slums. In your Liverpool slums, Your mum's on the game and your dad's in the nick, You can't get a job 'cos you're too fucking thick, In your Liverpool slums.

      For Brandy and Odie ______________________  You had to be there.  Had to be a kid.   Had to care about sports.   Had to be a dreamer.   Had to feel like it changed your life.    No hockey game should have that kind of effect, right? Well, this one did. The 1980 Olympic Team changed the course of my life. Validated every reason I ever had for liking sports. Made me believe I could accomplish anything. Kept me watching all kinds of games, hoping for the next miracle. Think it's coincidence I do this for a living?     Now they've made a movie about it. This baby could be a cross between "Hoosiers," "Slap Shot" and "Rocky IV." I'm not going. Believe me, I remember everything just fine. The boys getting reamed in that exhibition at MSG. The crazy-low expectations heading into Lake Placid. All those "That's Incredible!" promos. Our hockey team was barely a blip on the radar.   Then everything changed.  Imagine life without computers, cable, the Internet and video games. Imagine killing time every day, hoping for snow just so you'd have something to do. Imagine pinning your hopes on a ragtag group of college kids and minor leaguers, just because you happened to love hockey. In bed on a school night, you listen to the Sweden game on your clock radio. They're down 2-1, and they pull the goalie, but you keep listening, and you keep hoping ... and then Billy Baker scores with 27 seconds left. Euphoria. Until you get in trouble because you're supposed to be sleeping.   They own you after that. And when they play the evil Soviets on Friday, you know two things: they're the best, and we might see them again in WW III. They're Drago, Shute, Clubber, and the Nazis in Victory rolled into one. No way the kids hang with them. But you never stop hoping. ABC tape-delays the game for prime time, so you're dying all afternoon. Something's happening. At the supermarket with Mom, someone in frozen foods says, "Just heard it's 2-2 in the second." You feel like you might pass out.    You wait and wait, and finally, Jim McKay comes on. You study his face -- every smirk and eyebrow raise. He says, you definitely want to stick around for this one. What does that mean? Your heart starts doing 360s. And for two periods, they hang with the Russians, just like the supermarket guy said. When Johnson scores a fluke off a ricochet, you leap up and down. You just -- you can't even believe it. The crowd makes a noise you've never heard -- one that combines utter disbelief and palpable joy, a constant shriek that keeps getting louder. The most magnificent sound.   Third period, halfway through ... Eruzione scores. 4-3, USA. Indescribable. If you could be anywhere for five minutes, wouldn't you pick Lake Placid at that moment? Flags wave everywhere. Chants of "U-S-A!" cascade down. Players rush the ice to jump on their captain, because you could do that back then. The Soviets skate around in shock. We're beating the Russians. We are beating the Russians.   The next 10 minutes feel like 10 days, kind of like those last few minutes on a treadmill. The Russians keep coming, and coming. They take about 600 shots. Jimmy Craig stops them all. You may as well be watching someone walk a tightrope while dodging a barrage of bullets. That final minute comes, and the Russians stage one last, furious thrust, but we clear it out of there ... and Michaels is screaming, "Do you believe in miracles?" and you do, you really do. Sticks fly in the air. Strangers hug. Flags bob. The Russians stand dazed, destroyed. Players roll around in glee.   U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!   And you didn't wonder how much Craig was going to make in endorsements or who was winning your Olympic roto league. You just cheered for your country, on tape delay, and you felt liberated.   If none of this makes sense ... well, see the movie. I'm staying home. I didn't want a videographer at my wedding, either. I can't imagine any movie topping the real thing.   (By the way, I'm seeing it on Friday.)  __________________________________  (Making of a Mircale on Ice)  Sure, they were just costumes in a movie. But pulling on those 1980 USA Olympic hockey sweaters for Disney's new movie "Miracle'' was a little more inspiring than, say, putting on a pair of Hobbit pants.    "I remember when we were auditioning,'' said Patrick O'Brien Demsey, who portrays Mike Eruzione. "We were standing in the hallway at the last audition and I said, 'I hope I get the part because I can't wait to put on that USA sweater.' And Mike Mantenuto just looked at me and said, 'You are Eruzione.'   "Miracle" director Gavin O'Connor giving -- what else-- directions on set."In the two months we were doing those scenes, I must have put it on a thousand times, and every time it was special. When I got to put on the sweater everyday,'' recalled Mantenuto, "forget that I was filming a movie, that was a dream of mine since I was a boy playing hockey.''   That the USA sweaters held such appeal to Demsey, Mantenuto (who portrays Jack O'Callahan) and the rest of the cast is not surprising. Director Gavin O'Connor insisted on using real hockey players for the movie.   "There was no other way I was going to do it,'' O'Connor said. "I told the studio that. I didn't want to cast actors. You can't get actors to play hockey at the level required. I thought the way to go was to get hockey players born with the acting gene but who didn't know it and teach them how to act.''   O'Connor held tryouts with approximately 4,000 players in six cities to find his players, even holding a combine before finally settling on 80-some players to portray the U.S. and European teams. Almost every actor played hockey in college or the minor leagues (Demsey played college hockey in Boston while Mantenuto played at the University of Maine). For further authenticity, the production team also plotted the actual games on a computer, diagramming the movement of each play and player, then recreating them as closely as possible in front of the cameras at an old rink in Vancouver, B.C.   The result of this attention to hockey detail? Forty enthusiastic thumbs up from the 20 members of the 1980 team. When the movie was screened for several members of the team last month, they regularly burst into applause when goals were scored.   "The hockey scenes are fantastic,'' O'Callahan said. "These guys are real hockey players, the Russians are really good players, the hits, the on-ice action, the body contact -- there is even real blood in this movie if you can believe -- the fisticuffs, the passion, it's all through the movie at every level.''   Actor Eddie Cahill celebrates at the "Miracle" premiere with real-life 1980 team member Jim Craig .The interesting thing is that in re-creating perhaps the biggest moment in American sports history, the player-actors found themselves living their roles more than even Robert DeNiro would attempt.   "We visited the set and we went out together afterwards, and these guys would talk to each other and refer to each and they would use our names,'' O'Callahan said. "Someone would say, 'Hey O.C., what time are you getting up tomorrow?' and we would both say at the same instant, 'About 8.'   "That was the weirdest part for us, to see these guys really take on our roles and personalities.''   Of course, one actor had a long time to study for his role. Billy Schneider portrays his father, Buzz. "I put it on a couple times,'' Schneider says. "We had one of the Russian's jerseys, too, and my brother and I would throw those on and play games. One of us would be dad and the other would be the Russian.''   Not only the players had hockey roots. Kurt Russell, who gives a superb portrayal of coach Herb Brooks, is a former pro athlete whose son, Wyatt, is a promising goalie in Vancouver's youth leagues.   The cast was together almost as long as the actual team was, playing, rehearsing and filming for about half a year in Vancouver. By the end of production, they say, they were more than a cast, they were a team. "We all bonded,'' adds Schneider. "We practiced for a month before filming, just skating and playing hockey, and afterward we went out every night. We wanted to be friends and get the same bonding as a team that they had.''   "Our team of 20 guys has expanded now,'' O'Callahan said. "These guys have connected in such a way, and the fact that Billy Schneider played his dad might have something to do with it, but there is this sort of connection over the generations now that is pretty cool.''   ___________________________________________________________________  We all know Kurt Russell has starred in dozens of movies since he started as a child actor more than four decades ago (playing everyone from Elvis to Snake Plissken to the Computer Who Wore Tennis Shoes) and also is the partner of Goldie Hawn. Less well-known are his sports connections. He was a minor league second baseman in the early '70s, his father, Bing, was a prominent minor league team owner and his 17-year-old son, Wyatt, is a promising goaltender in British Columbia.  Russell was honored to have portrayed Herb Brooks, a man of greatness.Russell also currently stars as Herb Brooks in Disney's new movie about the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team, "Miracle.''  During the course of two interviews, one last June on the set of "Miracle'' and one last month, Russell talks about what Brooks and Elvis had in common, what he learned from Jim Bouton and how not to turn a doubleplay ...  1. You portrayed both Elvis and Herb Brooks in movies. Whose clothes would you least like to wear in public, Elvis' gear or Herb's plaid sports coats and pants?  Kurt Russell: You've got that right. They're both cut from the same mold, they both had the same greatness.   2. Where were you when you heard Herb was killed?  I don't remember where I was, I just remember being shocked. I really liked him.   When I first met Herb, he asked me, "Do you have a son named Wyatt? I'm going to see him play.'' Herb was still doing hockey, he was a hockey guy. And I was a hockey dad. That was how we originated our relationship. We knew we would get to talking about the movie experience and how he was feeling about it, but neither one of us cared as much about that as about what was going on right now in real life with a real hockey player -- and one who might be a good one.   And then I spent a couple days with him, talking and researching and trying to recapture him as much as possible and what he was thinking at the time and who he was. I'm glad I had the experience.   3. How was he able to take that team to the gold medal?    Herb Brooks inspired many youngsters to play the game.What he did was put the right guys together. He put a group together that became a team. They were not an all-star team. There were better guys available. But those were the best guys for his approach to the game, which was a hybrid of the Soviet school, the Canadian school and the North American style of hockey. He had to get players with abilities in areas that wouldn't have gotten picked by other coaches. And the players didn't like each other, so he had to give them a common enemy -- which was him. And he had them long enough to get his game through to him and they learned to play it.   They also had the skill level to do it. They gave themselves the opportunity to play well against a great team. In that game against the Soviets, they played fantastic and they were lucky. They were close enough (in ability) that if they got the bounces, they could upset them. And the bounces did go their way.  I think Herb put all those pieces together and made that happen. He drove the players way past any point they had been before, or thought they could get to. He just kept driving them, and they hated him, but they all got to wear gold medals because of him. He literally forced them, against their will much of the time, to be the best they could be.  Herb said to me that it was the loneliest year of his life. I find that interesting, and devastating. We all think of the gold medal and the boys standing on the podium and all that, and then here's Herb, who's relishing the victory and realizing it has changed his life forever, but he's also relieved that the worst, loneliest year of his life has finally come to an end.  4. The real players give your portrayal of Herb the big thumbs up of approval. Were you satisfied?    I'm anxious to hear what his wife, Patty, thinks. My thing is I wanted Herb to see it. And that's not going to happen now. I'll take what everyone else says but I would love to have heard what Herb thought. He was hard to please.   5. Living the role of Brooks, does it make you start coaching your own son?  No, he's playing real hockey. I'm just acting.  6. You were an athlete yourself. You played minor league baseball for several seasons before a rotator cuff injury ended your baseball career. How serious were you about baseball?   I was serious enough to be leading the Texas League (in hitting) when I got hurt. Sandy Alomar was hitting .138 and I was in the middle of a pretty good year. I made the All-Star team and I was a second baseman who could turn the doubleplay and hit. It was what I did. The fun part of my life was that everyone in baseball knew me from baseball. They didn't understand what I was doing with the acting thing. The acting was what was strange to them.   I played ball from when I was a kid. It's just always been in my family. My dad had minor league teams. My great grandfather was a great ballplayer. I played it as long as I could. And I always thought I could do both. I wasn't really serious about acting -- I was serious about baseball. I don't know if it was more important to me than acting but I was a young man, 22, and I had geared up to play pro ball from the time I was 13 or 14. The acting was something that just came along. But I made good money acting, so it wasn't something that I was just going to put aside and pretend it didn't exist.   7. How did you injure the shoulder?   Kurt Russell and Patricia Clarkson showed off their chemistry on screen.It was a couple things. I used to throw batting practice a lot, and with some injuries on the team, I was playing all the time which I hadn't been earlier, and with throwing batting practice, I think my arm was somewhat tired. But I got hit high on a doubleplay just as I turned it, and it surprised me because we were way ahead in the game and I thought the runner would turn off to right field. So it was my fault. I kind of lackadaisically came across the base and he hit me high. I didn't know what happened but the next thing I knew I was laying flat on my back.   It didn't really hit me how bad it was hurt at the time. I went out that night and played air hockey and I began to feel my arm bothering me. The next day throwing batting practice it didn't feel right and over the next week it just got worse. Frank Tanana told me, "I think you've torn your rotator cuff." I said, "What are you talking about?'' I didn't know what a rotator cuff was, it wasn't that well known back then. Frank said, "Yeah, I know what that is. I think you've torn it and I think you might be done.'' And I was like, yeah, sure.  I went back to L.A. a couple days later and went to the Jobe clinic and the doctor did an arthrogram on me and he looked at the arthrogram and he looked at me and he said, "Aren't you also an actor?'' And I said, Yeah. And he said, "Well, you're an actor all the time now.''   8. Ballplayers being ballplayers, did they give you any grief about your film career?  Most of the ballplayers that I played with, knew me from baseball. The acting thing to them was like, 'Yeah, I don't know why he does that.' Ballplayers used to say, 'You must meet a lot of girls in movies. Can you get me into that?' They always wanted me to get them into it.   Whenever I went to play somewhere where they didn't know me as a player, me and my teammates would get a kick out of watching them, because the other team would be like, 'Hey, that guy can really play.'' I got a kick out of the stands when they would heckle me and I would take the energy from that.  I watched that a little bit with Wyatt this year. I'd ask him if he got any crap out there and he'd say, yeah a little bit. But I taught him to just use it, use it against them, and it gives you a competitive edge. The first year they ran him hard and they realized he could play and it wasn't working, and that he was just another player.   I always realized that it was a unique situation, though. For me, if I was playing for El Paso today and Leonardo DiCaprio was playing second base, I'd go, "What's going on here?''   9. Is there anything in acting that recaptures the thrill of sports competition?   Russell with his longtime love Goldie Hawn at the "Miracle" premiere. No. This is a different world. You're trying to create a show, to recreate reality, you're inventing. It's creativity. It's like painting, it's fun. But for any guys playing sports at a high level -- playing it for money -- well, I can't put my finger on it, but in a man's world of sport, there is something visceral to beating another man.   10. What was your best moment as a ballplayer?   There were two, really. One was in 1977 when I was in Portland with my dad's team (the Mavericks), a couple years after the injury and I was done playing ball, and I was just up there finishing out the year as a DH. Jim Bouton was on the team and it was the final game of the season, and it was in the seventh or eighth inning of a close game and we were both in the dugout and I was getting ready to hit. And I remember turning to Bouton, and I said, "This is great." And looking at him, I could see he was really enjoying himself. And he said, "Is there any other place you would like to be right now?'' And I said, "I know, what you mean. But you pitched in the World Series.'' And he said, "It doesn't make any difference. This is just as good as anything I ever did. Because it counts. Because it's right now." I remember thinking, "Yeah, it doesn't matter, it's just whatever importance you place on it."  And I've always taken that with me. Even if I was just playing golf by myself and having a really good round, or if I could break my personal best, that moment would become just as meaningful to me as anything else.  There was another moment earlier in my career when I struck out four times in a game, and I knew, I just KNEW that was the last game I would ever play in. I went to the ballpark the next day and I was in the lineup. And I said, "Well, hell, THIS is the last time. They're tossing me a bone here but this is the last game." So I went out to take infield and BP and then the national anthem started to play and I said to myself, "I'm just going to enjoy this. I'm not going to think about the future or the past. I'm just going to go out there and enjoy myself.'' And literally, something went through me and I got three hits that day and things turned around. But I remember realizing right then. THAT'S what they know. THAT'S what the good players know. That you have to just stand back and enjoy it. And I never had a bad day after that. If I had an oh-fer or something, it didn't mean anything because tomorrow was always another day.   I sort of learned an important lesson that I would like to pass on to my son or anyone else who wants to play sports for a living. Whenever the opportunity comes, whatever it is, enjoy it. Just enjoy it. Whatever the outcome may be, it's going to be, but as long as you're enjoying it, you're giving yourself a chance to perform at your best level.

      I must've dreamed a thousand dreams Been haunted by a million screams But I can hear the marching feet They're moving into the street.  Now did you read the news today They say the danger's gone away But I can see the fire's still alight There burning into the night.  There's too many men Too many people Making too many problems And not much love to go round Can't you see This is a land of confusion.  This is the world we live in And these are the hands we're given Use them and let's start trying To make it a place worth living in.  Ooh Superman where are you now When everything's gone wrong somehow The men of steel, the men of power Are losing control by the hour.  This is the time This is the place So we look for the future But there's not much love to go round Tell me why, this is a land of confusion.  This is the world we live in And these are the hands we're given Use them and let's start trying To make it a place worth living in.  I remember long ago - Ooh when the sun was shining Yes and the stars were bright All through the night And the sound of your laughter As I held you tight So long ago -  I won't be coming home tonight My generation will put it right We're not just making promises That we know, we'll never keep.  Too many men There's too many people Making too many problems And not much love to go round Can't you see This is a land of confusion.  Now this is the world we live in And these are the hands we're given Use them and let's start trying To make it a place worth fighting for.  This is the world we live in And these are the names we're given Stand up and let's start showing Just where our lives are going to.

       All the hype is over and it is time for the game to be played.   It's the Super Bowl and you know you'll watch. Doesn't matter if it's the Dolphins and the Cowboys of old or today's Patriots and Panthers. You'll watch. You can't help it -- unless the dip runs out at halftime.  Acknowledge that the Super Bowl is a guilty pleasure and INDULGE.  Feel free.  Do not pretend like you might not watch on Sunday because New England Patriots vs. Carolina Panthers does not interest you.  Because you know you will.  Who are you talking to?  Who are you kidding?  The matchup could be Arizona Cardinals vs. San Diego Chargers.  You'd watch.  The game could be played in the middle of a cornfield in Dubuque.  You'd watch.  The announcers could be Carrot Top and your mother-in-law.  You'd watch.  Especially if you had money on the game, but that's another story.  If it's the Super Bowl, and there's a Roman numeral on it, you WILL watch.  Some people claim they DON'T watch the Super Bowl, but they cannot be trusted. They are the same people who try to seem superior to you by bugling the fact they do not own a TV. The kind of people who take insane pleasure in claiming they have ne ver heard of Clay Aiken.  Ya feel me?  The Super Bowl is the Super Bowl, whenever, wherever, whomever.  The Super Bowl is bigger than you, bigger than me, bigger than a dull matchup, bigger than a rotten game, bigger than Refrigerator Perry after a big meal.  Sunday's game will be seen in 229 countries and territories, by a worldwide audience of around 1 billion.  You want to know how big the Super Bowl is?  Picture a woman in Botswana, second-guessing that call on third-and-8.  Picture a man in Papua New Guinea, remarking how cute Tom Brady is.  The U.S. television audience alone on Sunday will top 130 million.  Fathom that number.  President Bush marrying Elvis on the last episode of Friends wouldn't draw 130 million.  A 2003 study named the NFL as the world's fourth-largest brand in terms of licensing at $3.1 billion per year. (First: Disney.) Hallmark determined that the Super Bowl has officially surpassed New Year's Eve as America's biggest excuse for a party. The food industry ranks only Thanksgiving as a day when more grub will be consumed nationally than on Super Bowl Sunday. Houston's economic impact from hosting this year's game is expected to exceed $300 million.  By any measurement, the NFL and its Super Bowl are King Sport.       Panthers Over Patriots By 3. 24-21

      When the trumpet sounded, everything was prepared on earth, and Jehovah gave the world  to Coca-Cola Inc. Anaconda  Ford Motors, and other corporations.  The United Fruit Company  reserved for itself the most juicy  piece, the central coast of my world,  the delicate waste of America    It rebaptized these countries Banana Republics,  and over the sleeping dead,  over the unquiet heroes  who won greatness,  liberty, and banners,  it established an opera buffa:  it abolished free will,  gave out imperial crowns,  encouraged envy, attracted  the dictatorship of flies.    Trujillo flies, Tachos flies  Carias flies, Martinez flies,  Ubico flies, flies sticky with  submissive blood and marmalade,  drunken flies that buzz over  the tombs of the people  circus flies, wise flies  expert at tyranny    With the bloodthirsty flies  came the Fruit Company,  amassed coffee and fruit  in ships which put to sea like  overloaded trays with the treasures  from our sunken lands.    Meanwhile the Indians fall  into the angry depths of the  harbors and are buried in the  morning mists,  a corpse rolls, a thing without  name, a discarded number,  a bunch of rotten fruit  thrown on the garbage heap.

      A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a big event, the girl tells him that after dinner, she would like to have sex with him for the first time.  The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacy to get some condoms. The pharmacist helps the boy for about half an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy a 3-pack, 10-pack or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.   That night, the boy shows up at the girls parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. "Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents! Come on in!"   The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down 10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, "I had no idea you were this religious."   The boy turns, and whispers back, "I had no idea your father was a pharmacist!"

       urlLink The Roaring Lions     1946 film.....for brandy  As film ages, it often becomes context and with Jean Cocteau's "Le Belle et la Bete," context is almost all that is left. One must consider that the film was made on a small budget in post-war France in 1946, and judge much of its acting and story and visuals by this point. Also to be considered is how more recent versions of the story have drawn upon this telling. One must see it within the context of its nation of origin. And one must see it within the context of Cocteau's life and work.   The most important aspect of the film which remains intact is its visual sense. In reinventing the story, Cocteau began with a simple titles sequence where words were written on a blackboard. Cocteau even stops these proceedings for a moment, to remind us that we are seeing a film and that we are about to see a story that he is interpreting in his own inimitable style.   For much of the film's beginning, it is fairly straight- forward story telling. Belle is living in near-poverty with mean sisters and valiant suitors in what seems to be the 1700's. She places her love of her father above her own happiness and gets placed in the hands of the beast for her troubles.   The film delves into fantasy and, by extension, expressionism when Belle's father accidentally wonders through the forest at night and ends up in the clutches of the beast. Here we begin to sees Cocteau's beautiful imagery. The Beast's palace is weird, eerie and unique. Human arms jut from the wall, their hands holding candles to light the way; Silent, ashen faces peer from the wall, sculptures come to life which leer wordlessly at the proceedings; Doors open majestically by themselves. Cocteau creates these images masterfully and the film breathes with a silent-era beauty and imagination that recalls early German silent expressionism while it also anticipates CGI by numerous decades. It also seems vaguely reminiscent of a little Disney film in the early 90's where teacups and grandfather clocks came to life.   When the Beast appears, he too is a marvelous creation of new and innovative techniques. The make-up and appearance of the character dwarfs the special effects of the era immensely. In the context of the year it was released, movie audiences had probably never seen a more stunning and awesome creature on the screen. It looks amazing.   Cocteau wanted to reveal poetic beauty utilizing film and numerous moments in "La Belle et la Bete" point to this. Cocteau's poetic ideals worked well with film and it seemed the perfect starting point for the artist to begin his cinematic exposition of the ideal. This film and this began a string of four films in the late 1940's which worked within the context of this thesis and culminated with the masterful "Orphee" (AKA "Orpheus") in 1949.   While uniquely Cocteau and therefore somewhat uniquely French, "La Belle et la Bete" suffers in modern day screenings from its stylistic yet modest approach to story and character. Every character is rather simplistically drawn and, since this is an adult re-telling, seems quite one- dimensional. We never understand the reasons behind Belle's affections for the father, her suitor or the beast. In fact, she seems a bit of a hypocrite at times. Within these same characterizations, we also find it rather difficult to accept the love story here The Beast never does anything that we find romantic but, by the same token, Belle never does anything that seems to warrant his desire. Much of this ruins what is a fascinating and visually stunning film.   As it stands, in 2002, Cocteau's "La Belle et la Bete" is a interesting document, a period piece that only piques interest in a talented artist embarking on a short but extremely important career as a filmmaker.

      hahahahahah...Franco Caliz- making a difference while barely trying. Email from  urlLink the Miami Herald  in reply to my email:     Franco,     What’s your phone number? We are interested in publishing your comment as a letter to the editor but need to ask a couple of questions.     Thanks,      Susana Barciela  The Miami Herald  Editorial Board        -----Original Message----- From: Franco Caliz [mailto:franco15@msn.com] Sent: Thursday, March 04, 2004 4:04 PM To: Alberto Ibarguen Subject: A total disrespect to the families of 9/11     "As a 14 year old, I'm never taken seriously by adults. Yet exactly how is it people can say President Bush was great in 9/11 and not see how he has betrayed those very families by not giving some of them one third of what he promised.   The latest clear example of politics being his major concern in life and not the well being of America is how he once promised families of 9/11 that he would never involve them in politics,as well as he shouldn't because the event was perhaps the single biggest event in American history. President Bush stated "I have no ambition whatsoever to use this as a political issue." That raises the question; why is it that he has involved images of the World Trade Center in one ad, and in another using the funeral of a firefighter? Have you noticed that the Republican Convention just so happens to be in the first week of September, near the third anniversary of the attacks.     To me it seems like Sen. Kerry is not the only one flip flopping.         Sincerely,  Franco Caliz"

      Mania: An abnormally elevated mood state characterized by such symptoms as inappropriate elation, increased irritability, severe insomnia, grandiose notions, increased speed and/or volume of speech, disconnected and racing thoughts, increased sexual desire, markedly increased energy and activity level, poor judgment, and inappropriate social behavior. A mild form in mania that does not require hospitalization is termed hypomania. Mania that also features symptoms of depression ("agitated depression") is called mixed mania.   Mania is the Greek word for madness. It is derived from mainmai, to rave in anger. The Maniai in Greek mythology were the Furies who pursued those who had done unavenged crimes and drove them to madness.   yay.

        You are Sloth! Lazy huh ?? You're a bit slow in getting going -  and tend not to do anything unless it is absolutely necessary. You'd rather sit around, watch TV/Sleep then go out and about with friends, or take part in a sporting event. On the positive side, you tend to be quite smart, as you spend a lot of time watching the News (!!) or on the computer, Also by conserving your energy, it's right there waiting for you when it's vitally important to get going. Consider possibly moving out of the room once in a while - and perhaps once a week trade watching TV for half an hour with a walk - and you'll be back on track.

      for me:  Line Up:  Daniel Svensson -drums Peter Iwers -bass Björn Gellote -guitars Jesper Strömblad -guitars Anders Fridén -vocals  1. F(r)iend  As they all felt the fire  They turned me into an outsider I never heard from them again So ironic when you called for a favor today  It's always easy to judge But takes a lot to be specific 'cause as you preach you're opening the door  To your egos past  There was a day when I could forget I could forgive but those days are gone I see them fade  Filth runs in every new day  I learned to mute the anger I never thought I would be there again A moment, a dead end I lost myself in here I ran as I saw the end Should I've joined the fight instead? Hope you're listening 'cause now times have changed  I take a look around Say this moment's mine Flee all the weak minds Feel my missed hidden rage  2. The Quiet Place  Spinning further, deeper I know you're out to try me I'm not in this to be a slave Push the dirt Make me feel Locate what swallows life Night bird you build my world  ...and then I close my eyes  Judge me now Used to be afraid to let it show Bow down I'm in a much better place now Everything's in place So much brighter from today A king in my own mind  Drown the monster Make all bad dreams go away Whatever it takes to keep your hands free Open scars The quiet place All the bridges fall to the ground And you say you sacrificed  3. Dead Alone   I'll always belong to the shadow Don't show me new results I'll never enter your heaven Make the most out of my dirty cell  Creeps infected by control That's what put me in here Dig deep don't think you ever get To the place where they buried me The last glimpse that I have Fragments, pieces of some things valuable even though it doesn't make sense anymore I release my last tear  My frustration My conversation Why are we even here? the abuse That we use I do not longer care  The cold worms and me We are all right We are free The dead light inside Fuel to new seed New world I hide  When there are only my bones Please put them in use Want to be part of a new dawn The day darkness disappears Don't release these chains Never been closer to myself All your mistakes run through As I realize what we become The end is here to bid farewell I'll turn to ash and hear them sing Songs about my emotions dead and alone Don't make an effort You don't know me anyway  4. Touch Of Red  Reaching depths of clarity I'm not supposed to be like this I should be on the top of the world Is anybode out there like me?  I followed - something's missing Self control - forcing me down Whispers consume the air Above her I'm endless  When the rain comes falling I'll freeze, I'm so afraid When things start to flood me I'll drown in seconds  Fear - there's a way out Touch of red Break away Nothing has it all Bury the place I've been I fear there's a way out  As if I ever had a choice All in the hands of the energy Once again I feel the quicksand Swallow me, tonight I won't struggle  The weak in me should know I'm as sober as I could be  5. Like You Better Dead   I can be as angry as I want to be  Just watch me burn (need to be motivated)  I think you're way too cold  Just watch and learn   I'll never sleep here anymore  My house is not my home  I like you better dead  I'm better off alone   Destiny, will you cure me?  Trust, will you age with me?  Hear me scream as I face tomorrow   Your vision may be in colour, but you look all pale  In these times we should be learning but with you I'll always fail   I need to save myself before I drown  It took so long to see  The world your mind creates  It pushes me under  6. My Sweet Shadow   I'm selling heavenly sketches  A world out of my mind  Ready to explode in purity  To fill the wholes inside   An ever moving stream  With glowing rays of light  Emotions tied to past lies  And I know I should let go   I found a flame in the burnt out ashes... burn out, burn out  Tamed with confidence of a brighter future   Fueled these new shores burn  Dark past lies cold  Shadow, my sweet shadow  To you I look no more   Another dawn collapses  Do I need to be reminded?  A glimpse of my safe home  A path to hide all anger   In circles I catch  A torch carried by the immortal  From depths that I created  In vain ecoes fade  7. Evil In A Closet   We were one in words  You finished my sentences  The answer to my puzzle  I can never attract tomorrow  It pushes me aside  I sink in waters deep  Your presence kept me floating  Far from depths where secrets lie  Maybe in another lifetime  I could be the first you meet   I once read a poem  Held my breath  But that moment's gone  First time I felt life somewhat hurts  Need an option and some hope   Yell at me, i want to be your light that shines  But my ground's shaking and I might fall  I wish that I could say... I wish I could be your evil in a closet  8. In Search For I   It hurts to think  Can't get the sums together  Would you draw my bitterness  Make the pictures fade   Could it be that I see  What's beneath when we fall  The truth in ever  I'm scared that I'll be   Will time open my vault  New solution, I'm begging  Break the fuse that holds me back   The I is lost in me  But I'm ready to give you  The m, it might even be the e  As I begin to search for I   Distract, push me in another direction  This wall that I stare into  It's getting old  Give me faith to reach for the new  Pull me apart and do me all over  I'll need a re-make  To make up for my mistakes   What if I stop to care?  What if I let you fall?  9. Borders And Shading  Take a knife and carve it in Want to see your faults As a part of your pretty skin Everyone has a tragedy I want you to wear yours in pain  Oblivion can no longer shade you Tattered tissue as a reminder  Bleak silence Errors stigmatized in you A weak worn out friend There's nothing left for me Again and again Your face reminds me of a bleak future Despite the absence of hope I give you this sacrifice  You're so far behind Be my hero Drift away Save yourself Don't end up zero Your world inside slowly redesigned  I deny any reminisce of us  I'm on a new mission I find myself in the future A trace of the past cannot be found  10. Superhero Of The Computer Rage  I am the past Future I've been chosen You think it's over But I'm ready to go I am what you fear  I've been chosen The world as you know it just died It's the end of all time  I am a surprise Even to myself I'm a genious Superhero of the computer rage In plastic I'll bury I am what you fear I've been chosen The world as you know it just died It's the end of all time  Everything you say is denied I'll be the devil on this ride  Dark clouds in your heaven Your end has only begun You can scream but the re's no rescue I promise I'll make you sure you die in time  I am the maggot In your infected life No matter how hard you try I'll leave without a scar I am a legend In your infotainment life It's when I say "it's over" It's you who's been chosen  11. Dial 595-Escape  Could it be a new day? Fear in me so deep  You push me out, I feel far The absence, close to me The otherside I crawl You push me out, I fall  Heal my wounds with everything Away you complicate me Sick of cycles, drop to zero A while just like last times My least favourite re-run Sick of cycles, I bounce in grey  Escape familiar home Memories remains alone Reality trapped inside The wicked descend - I hide  Testing higher mentality I conquer myself through this A furious path to walk New space does exist beyond In silence I dwell Displeased Remain with the seed of unfulfilment  "Try to remove obstacles as they appear" my master said "Don't look too far, you'll stumble before you're even there"  12. Bottled   I really don't have anything to say  Just pass me by  Don't ask me the same questions  Just deny I'm there   Like the time around me  This room is filled with nothing  Fell awkward in a place with many  Leave this space to me   I channel the pain through this  The paper, the pen, your eyes  To stare into what's next  It frightens me  No control, no reward  I'm in circles again   Still and breathless  I don't care what's behind  To you I look for energy  To catch my breath again   The world looks old to me  Tonight I drink myself sober  Soon this could be over  Tale a picture of the pale   New morning knocking  Feels just like always  Pen down my regrets  I reach to you again

      Fantasia or Diana? Diana or Fantasia ... I didn't care.   Once "American Idol" eliminated the red-headed John Stevens, I deemed the show sexist and refused to ever watch it again. Compared to Ruben and Clay, Fantasia versus Diana was like pitting a Kimmel-Corolla episode against the newer Rogan-Stanhope set-up on the "Man Show." No contest. There are more important things going on this week than anything in which Ryan Seacrest is involved.   Disney's "Miracle" came out on DVD this week. The story of the 1980 United States Olympic hockey squad; it is a wonderful tale of overcoming the odds, working as a team and making dreams come true. Along with "Finding Nemo" and the news that Omarosa from the "The Apprentice" is considering an appearance in Playboy, "Miracle" was one of the few things that brought tears to my eyes this year. The hockey action is great; Al Michaels is on top of his game and Kurt Russell plays a superb Herb Brooks.  However, this wasn't the first time the folks over at Disney put together such a formula. In fact, as much of a "miracle" as the 1980 Olympic team's conquest was, it doesn't hold a candle to the one that occurred in District Five of Minneapolis's Midget Hockey League in 1992. That's right, the fairy-tale story of Gordon Bombay's troops in Disney's "The Mighty Ducks" is the possibly the greatest miracle story of all. Where my father's generation sees "Slapshot" as the premier hockey movie of all time, my era looks no further than this Disney classic.   First, let's just look at exactly what this team did. After starting the season 0-11, they went on to, not only win the league championship, but defeat the Hawks -- a squad that won the last eighteen straight years -- in the finals  Tom Kelly's 1991 Twins may have gone from worst to first, but it had nothing on these mighty Ducks. Sure, Anna Nicole Smith's turnaround after TrimSpa is impressive, but the kids of D-5 were 0-11! Hell, the Ducks story was so phenomenal, it spawned an actual NHL Franchise!  This team was truly a ragtag bunch. It consisted of an obese goaltender scared of pucks named Goldberg, multiple "cake-eaters" and a pair of figure-skating siblings. The Ducks' original uniforms included football helmets, shin guards made of newspaper and names written in Sharpee marker over strips of masking tape. Even the Atlanta Hawks lime-green retro jerseys the team wore this year weren't as bad as these.   Emilio Estevez plays hotshot lawyer Gordon Bombay, who, after getting hit with a driving under the influence charge, is forced by his boss to take some time off and coach a youth hockey team. Bombay, while fighting his own personal hockey demons, learns the meaning of teamwork, "fair play" and love through his experience with the Ducks.  But, the beauty of this movie lies in its wonderful oddities. First off, the Ducks make the playoffs only because the entire Panthers team is stricken with measles.   Next, their main scorer is Fulton Reed, a man-child off the streets who makes Danny Almonte look like a baby. Here we are in an under-12 league, and this kid has more absurd facial hair than a wolf. Reed had a slapshot like Al Macinnis, and broke multiple car windows with his power.   However, the most intriguing subplot of "The Mighty Ducks" possibly lies within the romance between Bombay and team captain Charlie Conway's mother. How does Conway, a fragile kid as it is, focus on mastering the "triple deke" when his beloved coach is out trying to score his mother?   Of course, "The Mighty Ducks" also introduced the world to the wonder that is better known as Joshua Jackson.   Yes, the same young man who would later star as Pacey Witter in "Dawson's Creek," originally was a Mighty Duck. This raises some necessary questions: If Charlie Conway missed that final penalty shot in the movie, would Jackson end up kissing Katie Holmes? Would his face be on that "Seventeen" cover? So many questions left unanswered.   The "Flying V," the "Adam Banks Controversy" and a Mike Modano cameo all make "The Mighty Ducks" a fixture in any sports fan's DVD collection. This week, I plan add "Miracle" to my personal stash. But, I won't lose sight of the other "miracle." The one that occurred in Minnesota, not Lake Placid.

So if that sounds like I'm okay, then you can tell them I'm okay,  okay?"   Rachel:"Oh, my, god. I'm exactly like my father! I've been trying so  hard not to be my mother, I didn't see this coming!"   Rachel:"You know what else I'm not gonna miss? 'Hi, I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17  times a day, even if people are on it!' " Monica:" 'Hi, I'm rachel. is my sweater too tight? No! oh, I better wash it and shrink it!" Rachel:" 'I'm monica.

Unless--Did I? I haven't slept in 47 hours, and it does sound like something i would do."   Ross:(to Chandler while reading Chandler's wedding vows her wrote for Monica): "Dude, how did you come up with this?" Chandler:"I Stole monica's, and changed the name". Ross:"Dude, you can't do that!" Joey:"If he goes first, he can!"    Monica:(to Ben) It's no big deal. We all do it, all the time. Monica bang, Ben bang, Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel, bang!           Rachel:(Rachel bangs her head along with Monica against the wall.) okay, I'm stoping. Monica:"You okay?" Rachel:"Yeah, you know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it."   Chandler:" Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian....Did I say that out loud?"   Joey:(about how they cured Monica's jellyfish sting): Well, I had seen this thing on the discovery channel..." Ross:"Wait a minute! I saw that! On the discovery channel, yeah. About jellyfish and how if you...(looks at Monica) Ewwww! you peed on yourself?!" Phoebe/Rachel:"Ewwwwwww!" Monica:"you can't say that, you don't know! I thought I would pass out from the pain. Anyways, I-I tried but, I-I couldn't... bend that way. So....(looks at Joey)" Phoebe/Rachel:"Ewwwwwww!" Joey:"That's right! I stepped up! She's my friend, and she needed help. If I had to, I'd pee on any one of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got stage fright. I wanted to help but, there was just to much pressure. So, I turned to Chandler. Chandler:(Loudly wails into his hands): He kept screaming, "do it now, do it, do it, do it now!" Sometimes, late at night, I can still hear the screaming." Joey:"That's because, sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out."   Monica(pretending to be Rachel):"Yeah,um, i was supposed to get married but, I left the guy at the altar. Yeah, pretty selfish, I know. But, hey, that's me! Why don't you try the hummus?   Monica(pretending to be Rachel):(laughs) Oh  god. I'm so spoiled! That's it! Rachel(pretending to be Monica):"Oh and have I mentioned that in high school, I was a cow!"

Phoebe:(looks at the floor):"You see it is stuff like this which is why you're BURNING IN HELL!"   Monica:(pulls a wax strip off her leg and screams) Phoebe: "What? It wasn't painless?" Monica:"No, it was painfull! They should call it "Painxine, now with a little wax!"   Phoebe(on the phone with emily's Mom):"Hello, this is Ross's doctor, Dr. Filange. and, I just wanted to tell you that,um, Ross forgot to take his brain medicine today. Wthout it, in the brain of Ross, women's names become interchangable. Mrs. Walthom: "Phoebes?" Phoebe: "No, Dr. Filange. Oh, no! You have it too!"   Chandler: "Put on your tie. Monica is gonna be here an minute now." Joey: "It hurts my Joey's apple" Chandler: "For the last time, it's not named after each individual man."

       urlLink    A young boy went up to his father and asked him, "Dad, what is the difference between potentially and realistically?"  The father thought for a moment, then answered, "Go ask your mother if she would sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars. Then ask your sister if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars, and ask your brother if he'd sleep with Tom Cruise for a million dollars. Come back and tell me what you learn from that."   So the boy went to his mother and asked, "Would you sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars?"   The mother replied, "Of course I would. I wouldn't pass up an opportunity like that."   The boy then went to his sister and asked, "Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?"   The girl replied, "Would I? I would just love to do that! I would be nuts to pass up that opportunity!"   The boy then went to his brother and asked, "Would you sleep with Tom Cruise for a million dollars?"   "Of course," the brother replied. "Do you know how much a million could buy?"   His father asked him, "Did you find out the difference between potentially and realistically?"   The boy pondered that for a few days, then went back to his dad.   The boy replied, "Yes, sir. Potentially, we're sitting on three million dollars, but realistically, we're living with two sluts and a fag." _______________________________________________________________________________________  Your Personal Day of Death is...

       GARFIELD AND FRIENDS- WHO WERE THE FRIENDS   When we were kids, the only reason to really look at the newspapers was the comic section. Really, I think that's what they were there for, to entertain us kids who had no use for the other 4,500 pages of the Local Tribune. There were a lot of comics to choose from. I seemed to like Wizard of Id more than anyone else I knew. I hated Cathy, and I never got the Family Circus. For all of us, however, there has been one comic that stood above all others, one we could always turn to it. Of course, I'm talking about Garfield...  Many may debate that Peanuts topped Garfield, and I, in my more mature and thoughtful self, would agree with you, BUT when a five-year old reads a comic, chances are they'll get the jokes in Garfield ten times more than Snoopy's trips to shoot down the Red Baron. Yes, we could laugh at Garfield's gluttony, Garfield's violent acts to a dumb dog and a hopeless owner, and while some of us didn't get it, we still chuckled with the orange cat got pied on Mondays.  Some complain that Garfield's not funny anymore, that it's run it's course of jokes. Well, I'd like to see you try to make a new joke every day for over twenty years. Yeah, Garfield's rerunning some old gags, but I like to think of it as showing some generations what they missed the first time around.  On that note, I really hope they bring back Garfield & Friends. You know, so other generations can see it.    .   Garfield's probably the 2nd successful comic strip to be turned into a cartoon, the first being Peanuts. You'd be surprised how many actually tried. Yeah, you had Beetle Baily and For Better or Worse, and yes, even fricken Cathy, but only Peanuts and Garfield made the ranks. Made in 1988, it's been rerunned so many times, chances are you could be nine and still remember it. Still, I feel like I had to make a tribute to such a great show. They picked the perfect voice for Garfield, and the segments were generally funny.  However, Garfield was not alone is caring the burden of trying to keep the interest of three thousand kids every Saturday Morning. No. Remember, this show's called Garfield and FRIENDS!     They were known as U.S. Acres, and they owned one-third of the show. Could the tales of a wacky barnyard bunch help hold up the torch the fat cat was carrying into syndicated television? In short, was U.S. Acres any good? The jury has been a bit split by that, but in my personal opinion, they hold a shining light for the show. They don't beat Garfield, but I still enjoyed watching them. Maybe you will too. So let's take a look back at the days of U.S. Acres.       The style of U.S. Acres was pretty sweet. Not a single straight line in sight, and even though the colors are technically correct, you still can't help but to think you're in some kind of farmyard wonderland. It helps that at any moment, one of the animals was going to pull out a pizza or a rocket ship completely at random. What could have been a boring day at the farm ended up becoming one hell of a field trip.  Our lead character is Orson, the pig. He sort of took a fatherly role in the farm, being the general rule enforcer, the good-advice giver, and the all-around nice guy... Or, at least he tries to. Fact is, things are so out of control on this farm, there is no amount of control that could contain it, and Orson generally ends up blowing his top. Problems tend to fix themselves, though, so Orson ain't dead and on a skillet.  Most of his care goes to two little chicks, which he unofficially adopted. On the right, you see Booker, a mean-tempered chick always after the super-intellegent worm that happens to be the size of a poodle. That's big in worm terms. I always imagined Booker as a more modern, more American Chicken Hawk from the Foghorn Leghorn cartoons, except that Booker never actually got anywhere. Oh well. On the left, listening to a story with Orson, is my personal favorite character, Sheldon. The dude's afraid to come out of his egg because the world is scary. Never mind he seems to function well in it without vision, the ability to eat, or to use a restroom. That egg's really stinky.       That's Roy on the left. He's the rooster, and his job it to make sure you get up in the morning. Does a crappy job of it, too. Roy is the closest thing to a villainy element in U.S. Acres, apting to play a few practical jokes here and there, but he wasn't close to evil, just annoying. Hmm... lazy, annoying, and an animal.. sounds like they wanted Roy to be as close enough to Garfield as they could safely get. Didn't work though. We always giggled when we saw Garfield slurp up a bowl of pasta. Roy doesn't like the French.  Most of Roy's attempts at putting people down was directed to the most down person on the entire farm, Wade the duck. Wade's scared of about everything, including his own shadow, dirt, and hormones, but then again, I don't know anyone who isn't. Scared of their shadow, I mean. Being scared of hormones is stupid. Hey, remember Krang's robot body from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? Remember how it's face changed everytime Krang had a new emotion? Well, Wade's got something similar. See that life preserver Wade's got wrapped around his waist? Well, on that pool donut is a smaller, rubber Wade head. It's not just a pool decoration, though. No, it's a magic rubber head. Everytime Wade shows an emotion on his face, the rubber head imitates that expression. And seeing as Wade wears it everywhere, we see it's doppleganging gaze everywhere... and everywhere... and everywhere... I bet you could feel it's eyes on you always, like the eyes of that kid in the coffin in 'Salem's Lot.     Rounding off the cast is Bo and Lanolin, the brother-sister sheep duo. Bo's sort of a hippy/surfer/punkish kind of sheep, and tends to say such complicated words like 'like' and 'whoa' and 'cool' and 'man.' He's the kind of cool cat you wouldn't mind hanging out with with a beer, and that's hard to do, seeing as he's not a cat but a cutesy-wootsy sheep. His sister is a completely opposite, though. High-strung, snappy, unforgiving, and most of the time inconsiderate, Lanolin was the character we all wanted to hate, but we couldn't, because she was a sheep, and all sheep are JUST SO CUTE! The two siblings were generally in conflict, but all in all, it was mostly in fun.  In conclusion, U.S. Acres was a fun little ditty. It probably wouldn't have survived a solo-run away from the cat of orange, but it most certainty added variety to Garfield's shtick.  You know. I feel really good today.

      I was watching Dora the Explorer (which a top ten all time most annoying show in history contender). My god, JUMP! JUMP!  i felt like jumping on top of the TV. Blues Clues was cute, funny, intuitive. This crap is well, crap.  ya know, every generation has their shows. Shows they grew up with.  the three shows i remember the most are  Full House (olsen twins alert!Their legal now! YES!) Family Matters (URCLE!) AND Boy Meets World. (Corey is the man)  Other day i got all nostalgic with Shayan (though she didn't realize it) looking at other shows.  The Journey of Allen Strange on Nick (notice that most of these shows are on Nick, its not until NOW that Disney has gotten good) The secret World of Allen Mack. hell look what i found from nick.com   On her first day of junior high, Alexandra Mack was accidentally doused with a mysterious chemical called GC-161 and it changed her life forever. Now Alex is the only high schooler she knows who can zap electricity from her fingertips, morph into an oozing blob of goo, and even make other people morph just by touching them. But having superpowers isn't all just fun and games—the company bigwigs that make GC-161 know that some kid was sprayed with the stuff and they'll stop at nothing to find her, so Alex has to keep the powers secret. And Alex's powers aren't easy to hide—especially when they make her glow unexpectedly. But with the help of her best friend, Ray, and her genius sister, Annie, Alex manages to avoid being discovered and keep away from that truck that keeps following her around.    THAT'S CLASS!  One of the funniest shows i EVER saw was the angry beavers..  I remember with the first girlfriend i ever had, leticia nuñez :-D at lunch (remember iw as cute AND funny and likeable when i was little) always getting stuck as danny Tamborelli(sp) the red haired kid from Nick who all the kids liked during lunch aorund our group of friends. I also used to be the black duded that went WITH YOUR HOST SUMMMMMMERRRRR SANDERSSSS! HE was awesome!  Danny Tamberelli was also in the erm, movies Mighty Ducks. I can still see those movies (and yes i'm one of the few losers who still screams QUACK QUACK!   I just read this and agree 100%   "I myself thought that "All That" was great when it started. It had an array of funny cast members (especially Lori Beth Denberg, Kenan Thompson, Kel Mitchell, and Katrina I forget her last name), and funny sketches too for that matter. But then in its 2nd season we would soon learn that a cast member would leave the show every year when it was clear Angelique Bates left, and was replaced by that annoying, and unfunny Amanda Bynes. Man she sucks. Her Ask Ashley sketch was bad, and she was lousy from the day she appeared. Soon Katrina, and Alsyse Reyes left, (I think this was around the 3rd season) and they get replaced with the unfunny Leon Fryerson, and Christy Knowings. However Danny Tambereli was the only good new cast member that arrived during the show's run. He was good in his "Detective Dan" sketch, but he was bad as Lori Beth's replacement for "Vital Information" which now leads us to the 4th season. In this season Lori Beth Denberg, and Kel Mitchell leave, and are replaced with that loser Mark Saul, and that unfunny, and annoying Nick Cannon. By now Kenan Thompson, and Josh Server are the only remaining original cast members. The show went downhill at this point because of the departure of Lori Beth, and Kel and it only got worse from there. Kenan leaves prior to the 1999-2000 season, and is replaced by Gabriel Iglasias (who wasn't that amusing at all). By then I had given up on "All That for good. It just wasn't fuuny anymore. The humor was more aimed at a younger age around that time, which of course to Nickelodeon is bad.  Unfortuantly, "All That" premiered its 7th season last night on the now mediocre new "Snick" (which sucks as bad as Snick House.) with an all new cast of kids. These kids are terribly unfunny, and the sketches are lame, and dumb (Toy E.R. is example of how lame the sketches are. A doctor fixing toys? What's up with that?). I only saw a bit of the episode, and I had completly had enough of it very quickly. Why did Nickelodeon decide to make an all new season with an all new cast? Especially since this show went downhill? They should have just just killed this show off when Lori Beth left. Seriosly they should've. This show just isn't "All That" anymore. "   All that USED to be the shiznit, Lori beth i remember was that fat chick who was hilarious, she wasn't that good but she was funny. Now these new kids suck. The humor on the show is absolute shit. NICK CANNON? WHAT I WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR THEM?  Nickolodeons going the way of the dodo really, i when I was growing up (earlier growing up:p) They would never have thrown somethign like that.   and you guys remember Wild and Crazy Kids? and the one with the temple....erm.... FUCK what was it called. the Temple of doom! is all i remember not waht it was called, erm...Secrets of teh hiden legend? Now i'm on a mission, brb  back, Legends of the Hidden Temple!  urlLink HAAHAHAHAH!  or  urlLink here   Guts! Guts was great too, man, i remember dreaming i was one of them. Ah well. I'm off to school i'll finsih this as i come back

      Ok so around 6 i go to Sunset to meet up with Kurt, Cait,and Michelle. Needless to say it rocked.  Cait and I were alone in the kids section of Barnes n Noble, and she finds some lush of a turtle hooked on some book and a lonely cat and introduced them, quality. Cait and Michelle acting like morons, forthose of you that don't know them is like having like 9 natalies around ya. (attractive too!)  So me and Kurt act like we don't know them while reading ( Sports Illustrated).  So while thier acting like a zoo and we're reading a litte kid who's like....4? comes up to us and goes, football! (he's wearing a canes cap, like me-for ahir reasons bleh) tw'as funny, he notices michelle and cait and sits down to listen to them (so they go from going i'm dead sexah for a tutrtle! to kindergarden language, then some little girl sits down, this was the enterainment for a good half an hour till we go see the movie.   The terminal was damn good. Me and michelle fucked around the hole time (and Kurt and Cait). Then the damn women turn on us, I whisper some rude comment about C. Zeta Jones in Kurt's ear and Mich busts out with "AWWWWW what a cute couple!" for the rest of the night we got called gay by some guy behind us. So kurt, being the CAit pleasing foo that he is ;p HOLDS MY HAND, right in front of the dude as we're leaving. Class jokes followed after that including this exhange:  Cait: Awwwwww Kurt: Shut up turtle Franco: I feel abused and wrong Michelle: Why are me and caitlyn intruding on you boys. Kurt: Look it's the green pussy connection   After that movie, me and kurt argue. Why? Because we went to the bathroom in two's to make fun of the two girls, and i stupidly go you and cait should date. he gets angry (and all the erason goes to him) Cause hes liked cait for years, and yet me and her dated, and hes trying NOT to cross that line of "dating best friends ex". Then he dropped the bomb on us, While we're eating at Johnny Rockets ( I pulled a Brandy and snuck a couple of fries off of Cait) and a milkshake, he tells us he's moving to Broward.  Fuck, there goes that then.   Me and my boyfriend have broken up shit.  Kurt, Cait shut up lol  Damn, that means it's gonna be a lot more of Aventura mall for me.   Whic is awesome cause i've been annoying you people for like a year to let's go hang out at the rain forest cafe thing over there  anyways, i had fun, the ride back was awesome, cait didn't fit so she lays down on all three of our laps, and we all hold her and tickle her, woman almost pissed herself and her dad kept shooting me and kurt "DON'T YOU DARE!" looks the whole time. Her sister was screaming o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o sexy! (she's 11, why does hse soudn like me!) for like 5 mins.   I love hanging out wiht these people, the only time i don't feel like the third wheel is with them, i mean look at the group, my ex, another ex, and my longest guy friend (cait shush lol).  **thinsk about michelle and her turtle turtle deal**  Twas a good night.   Shayan- I'm not gay.   Seriously.  Cait- shut up.

      Was outside at a FIFA tournament, and one TV had the Holland-Sweden match,and other TV we were playing, and Ernie makes fun of Robert for calling Carroll "CD" (Caroll Dawson) .This whole "initials/name-shortening thing" has to be the most annoying TV development-that caught on in real life- of the last 10 years. FC hates it it drives F-Cal insane.

        FROZEN QUEEN/ KING You dont want love to come through to you. You like it the way you are. To be unreachable, no need to show feelings. Hiding everything inside you. You are already used to it. You say yourself that you dont need anyone, that you stand on your own two feet or that you dont have time for these things. But in reality you are scared to get hurt. You feel save where you are: by yourself, nobody can hurt you there. You invent your own relationship in your dreams. You just need to know that you COULD get a partner. Thats it.   urlLink   	~THE big LOVE TEST!! What do you need? With PICS! For girls and boys!~     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     cannae believe the greeks knocked out FRANCE!

      I'm selling heavenly sketches  A world out of my mind  Ready to explode in purity  To fill the wholes inside  An ever moving stream  With glowing rays of light  Emotions tied to past lies  And I know I should let go  I found a flame in the burnt out ashes... burn out, burn out  Tamed with confidence of a brighter future  Fueled these new shores burn  Dark past lies cold  Shadow, my sweet shadow  To you I look no more  Another dawn collapses  Do I need to be reminded?  A glimpse of my safe home  A path to hide all anger  In circles I catch  A torch carried by the immortal  From depths that I created

      Ok this is the French lyricsl second page= English lyircs  Avec le temps... Avec le temps, va tout s'en va On oublie le visage et l'on oublie la voix Le cœur, quand ça bat plus, c'est pas la peine d'aller Chercher plus loin, faut laisser faire et c'est très bien Avec le temps...   Avec le temps, va, tout s'en va L'autre qu'on adorait, qu'on cherchait sous la pluie L'autre qu'on devinait au détour d'un regard Entre les mots, entre les lignes et sous le fard D'un serment maquillé qui s'en va faire sa nuit   Avec le temps tout s'évanouit  Avec le temps... Avec le temps, va, tout s'en va Même les plus chouett's souvenirs ça t'as un' de ces gueules  À la Gal'rie j' Farfouille dans les rayons d' la mort  Le samedi soir quand la tendresse s'en va tout' seule  Avec le temps...   Avec le temps, va, tout s'en va L'autre à qui l'on croyait pour un rhume, pour un rien L'autre à qui l'on donnait du vent et des bijoux Pour qui l'on eût vendu son âme pour quelques sous Devant quoi l'on s' traînait comme traînent les chiens   Avec le temps, va, tout va bien  Avec le temps... Avec le temps, va, tout s'en va On oublie les passions et l'on oublie les voix Qui vous disaient tout bas les mots des pauvres gens Ne rentre pas trop tard, surtout ne prends pas froid Avec le temps...   Avec le temps, va, tout s'en va Et l'on se sent blanchi comme un cheval fourbu Et l'on se sent glacé dans un lit de hasard Et l'on se sent tout seul peut-être mais peinard Et l'on se sent floué par les années perdues  Alors vraiment Avec le temps on n'aime plus   With the time  With the time...  With the time, goes all leaves  One forgets the face and one forgets voice  The cœur, when that beats more, this is not the penalty To Be  Going To Look for more far, is necessary to leave to do and this is very well With the time...    With the time, goes, all leaves  THE OTHER that one loved, that one looked for under rain  THE OTHER that one guessed to the detour of a look Between the words, between the lines and under the fard OF A serment made up that some will be done his night  With the time all faints  With the time...   With the time, goes, all leaves  Even the more chouett's remember that have you a' of these mouths to the Gal'rie j's'  Rummages around in the rays d' the death The Saturday evening when the kindness leaves all' alone With the time...    With the time, goes, all leaves THE OTHER to that one believed for a cold,  for a nothing THE OTHER to that one gave wind and jewels  For that one sold eût his soul for some under In front of what one s' led as lead the dogs  With the time, goes, all is well  With the time...  With the time, goes, all leaves  One forgets the passions and one forgets the voices  That said you all bottom the words of the poor people does not return too late, especially does not take cold With the time...    With the time, goes, all leaves  And one feels whitened as an exhausted horse  And one feels frozen in a chance bed  And one feels all alone maybe but cushy  And one feels cheated by the lost years  Then really  With the time one does not like anymore

      (my british friends asked me to describe the day so here ya go)  9/11/01  jesus that was three years ago?  Amazing how time flies. I still remember, that I was listening to sports radio 560 WQAM, listening o someone bitch about the dolphins, and the host "Orlando Alsagueri"(mispelled) or the Big O, jsut goes, Folks, there's news that a plane has hit the WTC, We'll let you know if anything else happens, and went back to regular programming. Bell rings, 8:50, i take myself up there, and i tell the Home room teacher, she sees it, and just changes the channel to the next one for our usual "morning anouncements".  Next period, I walk in and their showing the 2nd plane slam into the damn trade center at that moment it hits me.   Ya know what pisses me off? The coonts in my class jsut laughed, some stared hardyl believeing, and the other ones started kidding playing around, acting like imbeciles. I jsut stared and tlaked with my friend about it. What is it? It's the most important thing in NYC financially besides Wall street, etc. etc.   Then we're there and we see the damn things fall, and some kids were LAUGHING. Cuban kids, who thought it was funny,s ome sort of big jokes, i got damn angry as my cousin once worked at the WTC, punched him and go, there could be 50,000 people in those towers. In Each tower. And my family member could be one you prick. Only time in my life where the teacher stared point blank at me saw me hit someone and not do anything.   Then we got word the Pentagon was hit. At that point the teacher starts sobbing insanely, and THAT's when it hits the class. That's when Everyone really woke up, and then we hear about car bombs in LA, just panic and chaos. Then our electricity (which was being tested that day fittingly) went out briefly, for 2 minutes. We were shocked, we went to our next class, the idiot sub wouldn't let us touch the TV, until finally someone convinced him. Lunch was amaizng, all teh guuards and personnel were eating with their students, half the cafeteria was empty and we all jsut sat there staring.  By last class we saw the rest of it and we were basically numb. Quiet, no one saying anythign (this was the gifted class). the Teacher jsut tried to explain to us what it might be, why things like that.   There were like 5 students left.   Why would ya take ya kid outa the class?   scholls prolly the safest place in america at that point.   Anyways,I get home and watch it for the rest of the day. Next day at school we recieved a message formt eh superintendant and what not, but it was somber. It felt like we'd been shot. Mind you, people here know i'm not the patriotic flag waving idiot, and in some ways, america deserved A PORTION of what it got, but not those 3-4k people that died. Innocent civilians, living their lives like normal. No need for that. Scary part was my cousin had to go to work that day at noon. We in miami were afraid that the might bomb Homestead Air Base in the north, or the airport (which is less than a mile form me house).   The scariest part about everything was that Miami has a branch of the WTC. It's exactly 2 miles from my house, as part of the Radisson complex. And i was on me own till about 7. Amazing stuff.

      Utterly depressed. Fooked if i know why.  right now it's 1 AM. I'm fecking angry.  Brandy hangs up at 6 or so. :i'll call ya back" by 7:35 i knew she wouldn't call back. this was like on Friday.   pulls the SAMe shit today. at 10:45 hung up on michelle, in CASE she might call. fell asleep around 11:45, and woke up at 12:45 in case she called at 1 like last year. which would abeen genius since she would only had to talk to me five minutes, say i'm tired and i got to_________ tomorrow. Night.  Stupidly, i even checked me texts and voice mails.   Nothing.Nno, now i don't even get that bullshit excuse.  Now it's i'll say i'll call ya later and that's that until next time you call em, cause i'm too lazy to lift my five fucking fingers outta me ass and and pick up and dial a number that i've fucking memorized, and talk for a minute, only if to say , thanks for for trying to keep the friendship alive, though i have no fucking interest in you, goodbye, burn in hell.   Or maybe it's just that she doesn't wanna talk. Fair enough. Seems I only annoy her now. And if not go call me some other day!  What kind of fucking friend does this shit?  Bet ya the house i live on if that was odie that said that, at 8 i'd have been on the phone with her again. And should she read this she'll go "but that's odette". So waht ya fucking mong. It's Franco. Ya don't like it, tell me to fuck off and that's that.  And this applies for any of you assholes.   Let's not be a total ass, kill my sleeping habits, because I'm a complete fuckwit. Because i still have a ton of belief in ya and abuse that. Then when i act like an ass with you, you act like a dick.  Brandy, for once let's try NOT to let me down, i'm depressed enough as it is, it would help if ya ACTED like ya gave a flying shit, as a charitable gift to me. Your good deed of the day for a fucking loser like me.  I don't know if that's too much to ask for though, so i'm sorry if i'm asking for too much.

      "I'm rightly tired of the pain I hear and feel, boss. I'm tired of bein on the road, lonely as a robin in the rain. Not never havin no buddy to go on with or tell me where we's comin from or goin to or why. I'm tired of people bein ugly to each other. It feels like pieces of glass in my head. I'm tired of all the times I've wanted to help and couldn't. I'm tired of bein in the dark. Mostly it's the pain. There's too much. If I could end it, I would. But I cain't."   Well let's see I'm a first degree asshole right?  Goddamn it, Nat wakes me up, i start reading and I read this.  And tomorrow I have to watch the movie.  FFS, If reading that, thinking about it, and questioning my life as I know it, and being depressed for like the last 15 mins ain't enough I still have to suck in the movie tomorrow, and hell there goes a tear.  Yeah, Tomorrow's gonna be alove fest for me ain't it.  Jaysus dun think i've ever ever cried&nbsp;about a&nbsp;movie AND a book both.  Painful.

      THE FREAKS FILES PROUDLY PRESENTS  TOP TEN CEREAL CHARACTERS.  Breakfast cereal is a kid's crack. We not only eat it for breakfast, but for snacks and for lunch. Cereal for supper is awesome. Sugar puff, chunky marshmallows, and peanut butter pieces are children's other food groups. But then again, it wasn't always the cereal itself. It was the neat little box it came with. The back contained fun games and puzzles. The sides contain recipes, coupons, and nutrition facts that nobody can read even today.  How a cereal is discovered is by it's advertising, and what's important in advertising is what it's trademark character is. How can we relate to him? How likeable is he? The characters on the cereal boxes have become icons of our childhood, and today, we count down the top 10 cereal box characters.  Before we get into it, I just want to guarantee that all of the really stupid characters aren't on the list. These include that Honeycomb Monster, the Coco Puffs Bird, the Cocoa Crisps Monkey, the Corn Pops Porcupine and Wendell. I have excluded the Flintstones as well, mainly because kids loved them before they had a cereal. Now, on with the list:     Ah, yes. The good Cap'n. He led kids into sea with promise of peanut butter corn puffs, taking them on wild adventures with dinosaurs, pirates, and icky, icky monsters. Cap'n Crunch cereal is pretty much terrible, with hard, jagged edges that torn up the top of your mouth. Still, I kept eating it in thinking that I would get crunchitized by the Cap'n.  In the last ten years, the Cap'n has dealt with quite a bit. A while ago, he had this whole big adventure where he had to protect this island from evil monster-things-monsters. You got this CD game with a couple of proofs of purchases, where you played against the monsters in skateboarding compitions. How drugged out was that? The Cap'n would get a higher standing if his cereal didn't suck so much, but remember, we'll always love the Cap'n.     We don't know much about the bee, other then he always has a bowl of his cereal on him. In fact, he constantly persuades people with that same bowl, which usually means that the person has to stop what he's doing to eat the honey-honey-yum-yum. We've seen the bee stop the Big Bad Wolf from eating Little Red Riding Hood, stop a barber from giving a man a haircut, and stop a princess from kissing a frog.  What gives the bee such power of persuasion? We might never know. What we do know is that the bastard is rich. He's got his own Marcy's balloon, his own race car, and his own airplane. In our early childhood, rich means good, so we all loved him. His may do questionable things, but that doesn't stop us.     Three guys that live with each other, making cereal, that talks when covered in milk. Riiiiight... Well, these guys are pretty well known. One's a chef, another's a band leader, and the third is a, um.. sailor, I think.They all look equally gay. The "Three Men In A Tub" of the cereal world, these guys are never seen apart. Their cereal is alright, almost melting in your mouth. And. Yeah. Rabbit. Stuff. What else can I say about them. Um....  Rice Krispie Treats. That's why I put them in the list at all. Rice Krispie Treats rock. Suger-packed rice cakes. Yeah     These guys were the villains of the cereal world, going out of their way to steal those boxes of delicious cookie goodness. Their actions were justified, of course. Who wouldn't want to eat bowls upon bowls of tiny chocolate chip cookies? We were always rooting for them, and unlike the Trix Rabbit, they even managed to get some cereal. Their main obstacle was the Cookie Cop, your standard Keystone Cop stereotype, only he protected the world's biggest vault of mini-cookies in cereal boxes.  Today, only the dog is around, trying his hardest to spread the "COOOOOKIE CRISP!" around. Where the bandit and the cop is is unknown, but some expect their still going at it past the Mexico border.     He was the bird that taught us to follow our noses, which, according to this tropical bird, would either lead you to great fruit or great adventure. Tucan Sam was the #1 exposure of tropical wildlife to any standard city kid. I wouldn't know what a tucan is if it wasn't for him. His cereal wasn't so great. Like Cap'n Crunch, Froot Loops were sharp like frickers. I swear, if I could properly see the top of my mouth, it would have more scars then Michael Jackson's face.  Tucan Sam also had his own set of kids/nephews or something like that, making him sort of an Uncle Donald to them. They weren't as misbehaved as Huey, Dewy and Lewy, so Tucan Sam is soft inside, but's he's still a cool guy, and the top bird of cereal.     Ladies and Gentlemen, the scariest cereal logo in the world. Who here hasn't had nightmares about him? I still have dreams of being eaten by the guy. But then again, I have dreams about getting eaten by everything. So, why does such a scary man get such a high spot on my list? He made scary relatives look harmless. Hey, if a picture of a scary quaker man can improve the relationship among families, then it's all good with me.     Out of all the guys we've looked at today, Lucky had the best cereal. Of course, there was the whole matter of getting the cereal. Lucky is a crafty little devil with magic up his sleeves. It takes an effort, but those kids almost always gets the Lucky Charms. Even though he tried to avoid people, we all loved Lucky. Lucky was Lucky was Lucky.  He was never angry. In fact, even while he was being chased by hordes of stupid animated kids, he had a smile on his face. He showed us how to "Don't Worry, Be Happy Now!" Plus, my ex-girlfriend is of irish decent, thus I have to promote him highly. I guess that's why they call him Lucky.     Count Chocula is by far the coolest monster to come out of Planet Cereal. While he was teamed up with such guys and Boo Berry and Frankenberry, he was the obvious leader of the pack. While his later reincarnation made him a goofy guy, his first version was intended to scare off kids, which didn't work. In fact, kids were drawn to him by the truckload. Maybe it was because he had no proper fangs. Or maybe because he ate chocolate.  Count Chocula is not only on my top 3 cereal character list, but also on the top 3 most lovable vampires, right up there with The Count and Duckula. Making two lists makes the world go round.  (Note that I've spelt things pretty good so far!)     Heeeee's GRRRRRRRREEEEAT! Tony has been an icon for all kids. He's shown us how to work our best at sports, how to become strong and fast, and how to beat your fellow friends at everything you do: By giving you bowls of stereotype-packed Frosted Flakes. Who needs exercise and a good diet when you got those surgery paper-thin flakes. Even the fattest, clumsiest kids could become gold medal winners with just a single bowl of the great stuff.  Tony the Tiger believed in sharing his mighty cereal of the gods, and that's why he gets my #2 spot. Congrats, Tony!     And, coming in first place is the trickster of Trix himself, the Trix Rabbit. Nobody knows his real name. All they know is that he wants one thing: Trix. He's got to get his Trix. Nobody knows for sure why he wanted it originally. Maybe it was the great taste, maybe for it's wide range of colors. Whatever the reason was then, his motivation now isn't to get the Trix anymore. It's to get those damn kids to shut up.  "Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids." This is the sentence that haunts the rabbit everywhere he goes. When he walks down the street, kids beat the quote into his brain. "Trix are for kid, Trix are for kids, TRIX ARE FOR KIDS!!!!!" There is only one way to prove them wrong: by getting the Trix. Recently, he's left his kid-tricking ways and have been entering contests to win the cereal fair and square, and several times, he's succeeded, but THOSE KIDS. THOSE KIDS STOLE THE TRIX FROM HIM! THOSE BASTARDS!  I feel for the rabbit. I believe he should get his Trix and live in peace. I'd deliver the Trix to him myself if I knew where he lived. People, help a guy out, and give a rabbit some cereal.

       The question has been asked for decades.    How many licks DOES it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?   In the 60s (or was it the 70s) this matter was brought to people worldwide through a commercial that featured a strange little boy, a senior-turtle, and the wisest owl alive. None of them could get to the center without biting. Recently, the issue was risen again by a badly-done CGI commercial with a giant monster and a robot. Yet, the question has been given no solid answer.   .   A few days ago, 2 days after my birthday to be exact, I was given two large things of Tootsie Pops, two of each flavor available in the market today. This opened up a door of possibilities.. Ok, just one. I took it upon myself to find out once and for all how many licks it really did take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop. (Of course, I used Kurts older brother for the test, I'm never going to be pictured)   .  Now, there are some things that must be taken into consideration before we start. You just can't pick a random Pop and start sucking. Different flavors will decide different outcomes. Flavors one doesn't like takes longer to whittle down, since you produce less saliva. That nocks off grape and raspberry for him. I also have to eliminate chocolate. Since Tootsie Rolls themselves are chocolate, it becomes difficult to tell exactly when the Tootsie Pop hits the outside air.     To produce the proper amount of saliva, I decided he'd consume my favorite flavor, orange. I personally will eat anything orange. Just by looking at this picture, I become hungry for an orange soda or one of those chocolate oranges you have to bash on a table to break apart. So, you can guess how much I wanted to get my lips on that orb of orange. Or at least I think it's colored orange. I'm color blind.But it was for science, so he got it.     To record proper data,we marked it after every lick. I was holding the camera, and  holding a cup full of milk in case he choked. Since I only have two hands, taking pictures of the paper all the time would become inconvenient.      Another matter that has to be considered is the way the Tootsie Pop is licked. Some like to shove the entire thing in their mouths and have the juices run down their throats. Others like the 30s style, where you give one side tiny little puppy licks. For scientific reasons, we decided to bring the best of both worlds and give giant licks outside of his mouth that cover the pop like a shroud. This way, he's technically licking it, but he's using the full capacity of his tongue as well.     50 licks down the road, and the Pop showed signs of shrinkage, but no major changes were made. We decided to limit the time between licking, because I did not know how the sun may have affected the chemicals inside. There's probably a reason Tootsie Pops are wrapped the way they are.     Licking went surprisingly faster then I thought it would, and at 100 licks, you could tell the the Tootsie Pop was already getting close to the end point. The Tootsie Roll inside was visible, and he said he could taste it through the layer of orange goodness. The end was near....     Or so I thought. At the 150 lick mark, the Pop has shown great some great resistance. It seemed that it was fighting back at us, and while it was a losing battle for this particular piece of candy, I couldn't help but be impressed by it's will power. It even tried to scare us by showing an odd piece of white mass, which we assumed was just a piece of the stick that came off during processing. None the less, the Tootsie Roll would be ours.  Then, finally, it came.      180 licks, and the Tootsie Roll came through. 180 licks, my friend. Now, while some may assume that the mystery is solved, I believe it's far from over. Different factors effect the overall outcome. We've already discussed the flavor factor and the licking factor. Other things to consider include temperature, the chemical formula of the Pop, how big it is, how big one's tongue is, ect. I'll tell you, this experiment was a lot tougher then one would think. The temptation to bite down was indeed great for him. But, now that we've got our answer...     YUMMY MUNCH YUMMY MUNCH YUMMY MUNCH CRUNCH!     That concludes our little experiment. While it truthly didn't take much too do, just a Tootsie Pop and some will power, it has become a major step in finding out what the hell the deal is with Tootsie Pops.

      shit i just read my first post...depressing shit. ___________________________________________________________  Hello. Welcome to the world of da Freak. who is Freak? He is in reality OcnarF ZilaC.  He is now headed to towards his freshman year. He is a foolish, pathetic human. A hopeless romantic. He tries to please. He fails miserably. And it really and truly affects him.  He is a world of lies. He has no friends...and if he does, he is sure to lose them soon. He is a loner, always has been and until resently he cared not what anyone gave a fuck.   For the first two grades life was dandy. class president. grade representative. leader of everyone. loved by everyone. Then life took it's first twist on him.  Made him move. from 3-7th grade he was despised.  But first in 6th grade his life was changed forever. Fell for the fierst real time for a girl.  Fell hard. Fell fast.  And so it was. Went well long enough. 9 months of joy, happiness. Then came May 16, 2000. His love. His first grandiouse savior. Betrayed him.  Paid 100$ 6 people came up with a world of lies. His bestfriend would not lie.  His enemies did.  His love did.  They claimed he had stated he wanted to blow himself up and kill all jewish (whom he likes) and Catholics which he is one. He was forced out of Doral Academy Charter School. The day before his birthday. On his birthday he registered in his new school. Then came West Miami Middle School. The Falcons.  He had 16 days to fit in, learn a new system. To catch up on all the shit he hadn't learned in Doral Academy.  All 6 months of which he had lost.  It seemed impossible.  But in what became known as the "Miraculous Justice". And as a testament to his two brain cells he passed all his classes. With an A. The counselor called it "the luckiest most incredible thing she had seen in her 25 years of counseling."   But last year has changed his life. He was backstabbed in a way no one could predict. And thus he hid in an illusionary world. He hid in himself, threw a "front" , a character at people.  Hid in a world of cold-heartedness. Threw out an iron face at the world and hid in himself. Then he was rescued. A minor ray of light came through. He wanted to give her the world.  But in many a ways he never got the chance. She was nothing more than his false messiah.  He fought in vain. Gained nothing but pure pain. Soraya was a failure.  It represented his life perfectly. It had begun well enough and had since become a shell of what it was.  8th grade began.  He then earned the one best thing of his life. His first true friend.  Brandy Sky Martinez...a name of poetic firm and a character of incredible charm. She kept him alive in his harshest moments.  A year in which he was atleast finally semi-accepted in the school. One which he is proud to say he was not the loner he was used to being.  But he remains anti-social.  He heads to highschool knowing this. There are now people who care about him. But he will never open up as easily as he had before. He will not show his weaknesses in the home of the Rams.   Coral Park will be his shining point.   He will keep his old friends. He will make new acquaintences. But he will not let people know the truth about anything. He will be cold. He will not feel like this on the inside.  But he will not be hurt by people again. He refuses to let this happen. He will show compassion to some. To the rest he will not succumb.  And he will not make anyone a permanent resident of his heart. Unless their already in it. He is ready....and those whom he trust. the few. the losers.  Will be linked here. It will be his only source of telling people what he really feels and thinks. And he will not go through another Soraya. Another Anne Marie. He will never again be hurt. Quote the Raven nevermore. _____________________________________________________________ Initial Readers will be Meily, Brandy (of course), Laura, Kathy, Carmen, Sofy.

      WANTED TO POINT OUT, 32 HOURS AND NO SLEEP! MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. but i'm dead tired at 33 so laters.  Happy 3rd of July everybody! On this monumental day a few hundred years ago, America threw off the oppressive shackles of the tyrannical English overlords, and won her freedom by throwing sacks of tea into the ocean, and setting traps just like the ones the Ewoks made in Return of the Jedi. We celebrate this great day by drinking a lot of beer, getting sunburned, shooting off dangerous fireworks into the sky and sometimes at each other, depending on how intoxicated we are. Unfortunately, many Americans don't even know why they are lighting those snakes on the sidewalk and sticking flags in their ears. Most of the public is ignorant when it comes to the history of this great nation. Even in rotten old rainy England, when they are not too busy ejaculating over Harry Potter, they teach about how they got totally owned by the colonists, big time. It's really a shame and I think knowing about the American Revolution should be required for a citizenship, driver’s license, and forklift certification. Today on this most holy of days, I will give a small history lesson to you little assholes, since you were probably raised in public schools. No talking or chewing gum during this update or you'll get the paddle.   The English have always been more than happy to spread their seed around the globe, like in the New World, South Africa, and India. They also sent all their criminals to Australia where they would flourish and make the adorable Crocodile Hunter and Russell Crowe. Once Columbus discovered the New World, and Spain started plundering Aztec gold and giving away free smallpox samples in boxes of Tide, the British started getting pretty jealous of their wealth. They sent their own dudes over to this unknown land, but much farther to the north to a place called Roanoke. Unfortunately for them, there was no gold to be found, only swampland and death. They tried to settle the colony three times but failed every time because they forgot matches. Meanwhile, the French founded the city of Quebec and built the first strip club in the New World, bringing trappers and tourists from afar. Fast-forward a few hundred years, and England finally gets it right and has many profitable American colonies that pay taxes. But then England fucks it all up.  The colonists in early America were clever, industrious, and inventive, while the snooty royal English sat on their powdered bums and taxed the daylights out of the poor citizens. A young farmer named George Washington worked under the yoke of the Brits, and had a secret romance with a beautiful girl he was smitten with. The evil local royal magistrate caught wind of the affair and had her throat cut for breaking the "British dudes get to boff the bride first" rule. Washington was devastated, and turned into a vengeful soul whose only goal was to see England in ruins and his people free; kind of like the Punisher, but with wooden teeth. Meanwhile, things in Boston were heating up. The British had taxed the tea so harshly that it prompted the citizens to throw it into the harbor, making the fish caffeine addicts and destroying the English fish and chips market back home. Then a group of rabble-rousers conducted a public protest and a gaggle of British solders opened fire, killing a few of them. This was known as the "shot heard ‘round the world", and woke up over a million Chinamen in the middle of the night, causing the Boxer Rebellions. War was on the horizon, but who will win? You will have to read the rest of the update to find out.  We will now take an unscheduled intermission break for some unbridled patriotism.   America is #1! But how did we become the most powerful and radical nation on the planet? Slavery is the correct answer, but right now we are focusing on the birth of a nation through bloodshed and firecrackers. Soon Washington had assembled some of the greatest minds and best fighters in the land. With these special individuals together, he formed The Founding Fathers, a super group of which the likes the world had never seen.    Thomas Jefferson   This master of disguise was a 007 before his time. A man who works well while in extreme peril, Jefferson was vital behind enemy lines for his intelligence gathering and assassinations. He was also known as a ladies man, and planted the seeds of freedom in more than one womb in his day, no matter the color. He worked best on his own, but enjoyed the company of his fellow Founding Fathers.  Special Attack: Mist of illusion    Benjamin Franklin  His codename is "the wild turkey" and he is a whiz at technology and contraptions. Without Franklin, the American resistance would've been lost for he supplied them with many secret weapons of his own invention. One such gizmo was something called the electricity ball that he discovered one day while flying a kite and eating a watermelon. Once the bolt hit his kite, it electrified the seeds in his mouth, and he spit them out with such velocity that it destroyed a nearby granary. After that he formed the Kite Squad, the most elite and dangerous troops in the colonial forces. One English commander was once overheard saying, " Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Benjamin Franklin."  Special Attack: Power Bolt     Samuel Adams  A man of fiery disputation and temperament, Samuel Adams was a judge by day and an explosives expert by night, just like the show Dark Justice that was on TNT. He experimented with anything with a wick or gunpowder, and is known to have invented the first bottle rocket. Soon, larger versions of the rocket were used effectively to drive the British out of Pennsylvania. He rode a large wild hog into battle usually with two roman candles under his arms, screaming his battle cry "Heeey youuu guuuuuys!". Adams’ use of these explosive devices for securing our freedom is one of the main reasons we celebrate using fireworks every year. He also created a popular beer after his namesake. I don't care much for the Cherry Wheat myself.Special   Special Attack: Bottle Rocket   These talented fighters, along with many other founding fathers, drafted the Declaration of Independence bringing about a full-scale war with England. When the English ships full of troops were in sight, a foppish tart by the name of Paul Revere road through all the towns screaming at the top of his lungs until he was arrested by the constable for disturbing the peace, and is remembered by the Beastie Boys song of the same name. The battle did not go well at the start for the colonists because most of the men were just simple craftsmen and farmers. Some were so keen on independence and freedom that they didn't even listen to the American commanders and just went back home to collect welfare.    If you ever want to know about the true history of America, rent the Patriot.  The English were super evil, like shown in the extremely realistic movie "The Patriot" with Mel Gibson. Gibson plays an old fighter who wants nothing of the war but his son is shot for being a spy, so he turns into a ninja and kills like, 10 British dudes while his infant sons shoot rapid fire muzzle loading rifles. The final battle for America was at Helms Deep where the British breached the wall with an orc bearing explosives. All seemed lost, but then an old friend returned to America to help them in their time of need. Steve Perry mounted a cannonball that sailed over the heads of the British hordes, as he held an American flag under his right arm. He steered towards the British command tent, leaping forward and impaling the King of England with the flag, and then blew up all the rest of the guys in the tent too. Victory was ours, and America was free! Soon after the founding fathers drafted the constitution, ensuring the God-given rights of all men to be free, they enslaved a bunch of black people from Africa to make this country the great economic powerhouse it is today. Hooray for America!  I hope you all learned a little something today. I know I did. Never put your penis in an electrical socket WHILE standing in a tub of water. That second part always gets me. Go on now and get drunk, BBQ some flesh, and blow up some pretty explosives. It's what this country is all about.    (This update is dedicated to the men and women who fought and died at the Alamo. Mexicans are not to be trusted, especially Spokker Jones.)

        You are GUTS.  You love to be "xtreme" and you love peril.  You probably enjoy a good sip of Gatorade now and then, too.    urlLink   Which old school Nickelodeon show are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       Heavy metal!  You rock!  It's mostly about the music instead of lyrics for you...but you channel most of the emotion through the lyrics! Mosh pit for you!  Just be careful you don't give yourself a concussion with so much headbanging...    urlLink   What genre of rock are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      I've been thinking...(a dangerous past time I knowwwww-Beauty and the Beast)  I've made an intelligent decision. I'm not dating anyone for a year unless a majour change is needed. And to be honest I'm happy right now. I've got a core group of close friends, i've got a second tier of friends who are cool.  I'm happy with focusing on studying and chilling wiht these people.  I've adopted a Que Sera, Sera (whatever will be, will be) mentality.   I've got enough stuff going on to entertain me and to divulge me time in, enoughs tudies to drown most people will follow soon (England, you better live up to expectations asshole, cause i need a break)  I'm cool though, I'm pretty happy, i won't deny the fact that everyone once in a while i need to hug someone, but having three Ap classes- having to plan out two summers now, and basically work my ass off cause i don't have no option anymore (which is good, i believe that the best of me is brought out under pressure, and this is like sitting on a hot stove for me right now) should take my mind off of any hormones.   And amazingly, today on FRIDAY JULY THE 2ND AS OF 3:53 P.M. I'd like to say that i'm happy, sleep deprived, and that i'm looking foward to the future.  Don't feel like saying much more than that right now, don't feel ike typing mroe to the point, but i'm gonna post pone my  MY GENERATION: IT'S MUSICAL LEGACY  until Saturday.  So to keep you entertained i'm brining up an old draft i've had kicking around here in the Blogosphere for a while.... CAMERA, LIGHTS ACTIONA  "This special report brought to you by Franco...." **insert wayne's world TUTUTUTUTUTU TUUUUTUTUTU TUUTUTUTUTU in here*** _________________________________________________ Girl Scouts. Myth or Mystic? You rarely hear much about the little girls in the green clothes making works of art with pasta shells anymore. Sure, their the butt of the jokes of many a cartoon. I swear, I haven't seen a cartoon with an episode were Girl Scouts were not involved. However, I have only seen a handful of Girl Scouts in real life.  Most of those sightings were this morning. I was out shopping for some whipped cream and some wasp traps, and in front of the store was this little booth being run by five little girls dressed in normal garb. I didn't think anything of it till I left the store. One of the ten-year old girls pulled me over and asked if I could buy some cookies. Girl Scout cookies! 1+1=2, and Girls+Girl Scout Cookies=Girl Scouts. My eyes were fogging over. Here there were. Actual Girl Scouts. Tears were in my eyes as I went home. After about ten minutes of intense crying, I suddenly relized that I had bought two boxes of Girl Scout Cookies.   .   Yes, I finally had the mysterious Girl Scout Cookies. I have heard many things about them, but I had never had them in my possesion to this day. I've seen all kinds of mixed reviews. Some people think that these discount factory-chrurned discs are pure pieces of crap. Others think the cookies are a balanced part of a healthy breakfest. I just knew I had to open these things right away and find out for myself, but I forced myself a few moments to find my camera.  Are you ready?  You sure?  Becuase, you know, who knows what we'll find.     First up is  Double Dutch , the unholy combination of chocolate cookies and chocolate chips. Sort of a self-defeating concept, don't cha' think? Also, did the Dutch actually invent these cookies? Not exactly a hard concept to concieve, I'm sure children who get their hands on some mixing tools and some flour tried to make their own chocolate cookies with chocolate chips, and probably expected chocolaty heaven.  I probably think that those kids would have made better cookies, though. These things suck.     But first... NUTRITION! Before I dwelled into the field of cookies distributed by little girls, I had to make sure they at least were not too far tracking from my diet plan, which consists of only one rule:   1. Don't eat 10-year old sushi that's been left out in the sun. Everything else is fine.   Based on both the boxes, these cookies contain more ingrediants then a nine-piece dinner at a five-star bed and breakfest, yet contains almost nothing in terms of vitamins and minerals.110 calories, but no Vitamin C. Things are like giant crunchy heart attack disks that don't even taste that great... But I'm getting ahead of myself. By the way, there is not a single date on this box. The only thing to place it within an age range is the fact that the Girl Scout Website is printed on it. I just checked it out, and it states there is 3.8 million Girl Scouts in the U.S.A. and that they've been at it for 90 years. And I've only seen five of them, all of them today. Where are the rest of these millions of Girl Scouts? I smell conspiracy.     Before we get to the cookies themselves, I should mention the list of things the box advertises the different things you'll be helping if you buy a box of Girl Scout Cookies, each with it's own bit of clip art. Here's the lowdown:  1.  Strong Community : A picture of three houses. Big whooping community. 2.  Strong Leadership:  A picture of the Lady Libery's torch. Doesn't that symbolize freedom instead of leadership? Hmm.  3.  Strong Skills:  A computer, which in twenty years will have replaced all of us in jobs. Sort of "Lack of Skills" right?  4.  Strong Friendship:  Thing from the Addams Family clasped to the evil hand from Evil Dead II.  5.  Strong Spirit:  A heart, cause you have to have a heart in order to be alive and actually gave a spirit.  6.  Strong Minds:  An exploding lightbulb. I blew it up with my mind.  7.  Strong Values:  The Girls Scout logo. Cause Girl Scouts are all the values you'll ever need.   Now, for some Double Dutch cookies...     I wasn't going for this effect, but those cookies do look like a string of crap, right? Am I just perverted? But really, they do look like poo. The plastic wrap was a pain to open, and I finally just opted for some sharp objects. If we were to cover Fort Knox in Girl Scout plastic wrap, I'm sure there would be a lot of lay offs for security guards.     They look like poo, but these cookies were as hard as crystal. I had to put all my strength into breaking it in half. Chewing took twenty minutes. My mouth had turned into a literal rock tumbler, crushing only remotly-flavored bits of cookie. This cookie made me hate the Dutch. I refused to even touch the rest of them and buried them next to the rabbit pen. Don't worry, they'll last forever.     In contrast, Samoas cookies are everything Double Dutch isn't: It's extremly soft and full of taste. And there is a girl wearing a fireman's hat. Double Dutch doesn't have that. All they have are airplanes on the box. Firemen are cooler then airplanes. HAHA!     Also, the plastic wrap was easier to open. These cookies are like night n day, baby.     There is one problem, though... The cookie is of 100% coconut. It's all just coconut in different colors. If you don't like coconuts, well, tough luck, sucker. Frankly, I love coconut, so I did not bury these cookies. I didn't eat any more, though, cause it's Cait's birthday, and I wanted to save room for some chocolate pie. The only person I know that chooses pie over cake.  So, in review, be very careful when picking out Girl Scout Cookies. They ain't healthy, and half of them taste like dirt. Tread with caution.  Yeah. I met some Girl Scouts.

      WHO IS YOUR INNER FRIEND? Chandler  Could you be any more like Chandler? The most lovable wiseguy around, you've got more than a little Bing inside you, don't 'cha? Front and center in your Chandler-ness is that unstoppable wit, keeping everyone in stitches (or at least deflecting uncomfortable situations). And like the Chan-Chan man, you'd never leave your pals out in the cold. But your generosity is so inconspicuous that people often don't even notice it.   Romantically, a soft, sweet, heart and charming, insecurity rule. You might, however, be held back from love by that nagging little fear of, well, growing up. Ya think? But, like the adorable Mr. Bing himself, it's just because you care so much and don't want to let anyone down.  ____________________________________ WHAT'S YOUR THEME SONG?!(OH FUCK YEAH) Back in Black  You're a hard-core guy who knows what he wants and intends to get it. That's why your theme song is "Back in Black." Whether you're pumping iron, shooting pick-up hoops, or rounding up the boys for a night of havoc, AC/DC's metal classic is the perfect tune to get you fired up and blow your speakers out in the process. Your friends might think you're a little reckless sometimes, but you know where the limit is. If you're the loudest one in the room, or spill someone's drink with a fearless air guitar, it's nothing to be ashamed of. What's fun without a little mayhem thrown into the mix? So grab something leather, play drums on your desk, and yell at the moon. You've got some hell to raise and head banging to do. Let "Back in Black" accompany you to the edge and back.  ____________________________ What Emoticon are you?  Sticking-Tongue-Out Face  What's so funny? You are! That's why the emoticon that represents you best is as good-humored as you. No matter if knock-knock jokes, sarcasm, or slapstick get you going, it's clear that you've got more than a couple funny bones in your body.  Getting a laugh out of people isn't always easy, but it seems second nature to you. You're not one to take life too seriously, and you know firsthand that laughter really is the best medicine. It's no wonder people know to look no further than you when they want to have a laugh. Late-night TV had better look out. A hilarious new comic could be on the rise!  :-p

      aye, continuing that last post  I've seperated mself from peopel enough to have plenty of time for myself, i've enjoyed myself (and been a bit bored).  I got an A in the class which is what I wanted, I've met a lot of new friends, i've reaquainted with people, Meli and Joanna mostly, I've spent time thinking, lots of it.  I feel I understand meself a ton better.  I'm one hundred percent sure that i'll be fine now.  I haven't been able to say that for about 4 years.  I'm gonna be cool, and i'm gonna own.  I have that new attitude, about somethings i'm the same, mostly caus that's me (and i'm always right).  I've figured things out that i prolly wouldnae have before.  It's good.  Life is calm it's fun, it's intriguin but it's SAFE.  One developement i don't like is the fact that me two closest friends i barely talked to, but that's life, one's busy with her boyfriend whom she "loves" (i'm using quotations for this love cause she got over her last love, in approx. a week. lol. (exxaggeration)).  THe other decided she'd go to venezuela and spend most the summer there, the cunt. But I'm ok with it cause i've talked to her in bits and pieces. and i've seen her a couple of time  (web cams own).  The main thing is i'm comfy with myself now. Am I social? no. Do i like social gatherings? no. Will I go to the mall more? Priolly.  I'm also cool with weaing make up.   When i'm forced by three girls to do so!  and yes I may date, once school starts, depending on how school goes.  A well.  One thing that's made me TOTALLY HAPPY. that's not Gisselle is.   NCAA football 2005. It's brought me back to 6th grade, when i CRIED for the hurricanes. It's brought back memories, mostly positive, and iunno.  Life equals good.  People equal=okie.  Video games = good.  and another thing.  Jonh Kerry was fookin brilliat (and Obama).  I saw it that night, and i'm hoping he'll keep it going. If he wins i will officially run aroundnaked to Shakira.  Well maybe not teh Shakira part.
