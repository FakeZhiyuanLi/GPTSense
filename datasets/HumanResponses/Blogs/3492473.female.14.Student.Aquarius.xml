      Right now, I'm "pissed off." I put pissed off in quotations because in a way I am but in another way, I'm not. The reason why I'm "pissed off" you ask? Here I am just typing a post to you guys and watching some music videos and the damn computer freezes! So, there I am trying to somehow open the page and save this but I couldn't so I just restarted the thing... go figure . Do any of you ever feel like these types of things only happen to you? I look around @ all my friends and wonder why everything is (or just seems) so  great  with them  and not me ... Throughout the last few years,  a lot  has changed. Once again,  go figure . But when I say a lot has changed, I don't mean things like I've gotten taller and that stuff.  I mean mentally  a lot has changed. These days, it seems like I can hardly get through a day without bawling my eyes out, flipping out at a member of my family, or just being a bitch. I always ask myself why people consider me a "preppy bitch" but in a sense I can understand why people would ever say such things. I'll admit, I'm not the nicest but neither is the majority of my grade  so why should they be the ones to call me names  when I kept my mouth shut about them?  And I hate it how people tell you it doesn't matter what others think of you.  Because to me,  it does ! People have such an influence on the other people in their life that they hardly realize. I know many people who are bulemic and anerexic(spelling?)  because their friends call them fat . I know a few people who  cut  themselves because they feel like the pain they feel on the outside can be eliminated by the pain they inflict on themselves. I know people who drink their problems away and think they don't have a problem. I know people who smoke only because older siblings smoke so it automatically makes them  "cool."  Our world is so screwed up and  it seems like a waste of time just to image how I can make a difference.  Right now I feel so lazy. I should be working out, finishing my health test, or writing poetry. But here I am...being a complete computer geek and recording my thoughts on a website that probably only a few people will just "glance" at. Life is so sucky that sometimes it doesn't even seem worthwhile. Yesterday while I was at Annie's, we got to talking about how we'd kill ourselves if we ever decided we were going to. I can't even remember how we started talking about it. The fact that we were is just a little scary. I mean everyone has suicidal thoughts a few times in their life, am I right?  I mean, I'll admit it. I have thought a few times that  death would be a lot better than living.  But luckily, I have some really good friends who remind me that it wouldn't be. Ya know something else I hate? How adults think being a teen is  so easy ... BULL SHIT! I don't know how it was for them but now it's a lot different.  If you're at a party and people are smoking and you don't, you're a loser.  That's what I hate about this culture, you can't make your own choices without being so heavily judged. And I mean, why would teens wanna do things such as smoking or drugs? If they really think it'll solve some problems in their life, they really need to go see a therapist or someone who'll help them. Ah...I think I'm gonna save this one and start another...

      I'm a very deep person and I'm always consumed in thoughts on the "whole picture," even when it seems like I'm just another teen. So this afternoon when I woke up @ 2 *yes,  2 in the afternoon , do you have a problem with that? I haven't had a day to sleep in for about  2 weeks ...now what was I saying?* I decided I was gonna spend the night at home. Okay, for a 14 year old, I'm out a lot, not as much as I really want, but according to my parents, a lot. And I am. And there's nothing wrong with that. Other than the fact that I haven't written a poem for a while. Like I wrote the one for Mrs. Laboda, but that was for the school's video and I had my reasons for wanting that out of the way. And the poems I was writing in algebra and science don't count because I had nothing to do. I haven't been home, that's why I haven't written a poem in a while! I just sleep and get ready at this house I call a home and that's it! Tonight, I wanted to work on my book *the details of which I am keeping a secret because it could mess up a lot of shit!* but I worked out and just ate. Which is really weird because all this week I haven't ate breakfast, ate a little lunch, some dinner, and that was about it. But today it was like junk food overload! Uh...and damn! It was all after working out! Which I couldn't finish because my legs hurt so bad...oh well there's always tomorrow. Believe me, if I could stop eating and stay healthy, I would but obviously, I can't. I've tried to not eat before and I get to lunch, and it's done. I know I'm not fat or anything, it's just that you have those models and shit to live up to and it's just hard to love your body. Even though soccer is my favorite sport, in ways I hate way it's done to my body. My thighs are like seriously HUGE! And everything I do just makes 'em bigger, it's not like there's tons of fat there, it's mainly muscle but my inner thighs are the problem! I'm just starting to think that I don't know who's gonna read this and what they're gonna think but please whoever you are, don't judge me, you don't know me. I really don't wanna lie anymore and pretend to love my body! I like my calves and that's about it. In a way, I'm scared to let my friends read this because as I know some talk enough smack about me already so why give them more reasons to talk shit about me? I don't know, I really don't. But I know this is a sense of therapy to me and I can really use it! I mean, Mike can only be my counselor for so long, ya know? Speaking of counseling, this whole career shit at school is really screwing me up. I wanna major in psychology and minor in journalism. But to get places in psychology I have to get a masters' (4 yrs of college) and pretty much NEED a P.H.D. (I don't know how the whole periods go w/ that "label." Oh well, I tried.) which is 2-3 more yrs! Number 1, I don't wanna go to school for 7 more years after high school. Number 2, the school I wanna go to is  a lot of money ! And to make my parents pay that amount for  7  years is gonna be hell for us both! But you don't know how bad I wanna get out of Wickliffe. Another thing that scares me is what happens if my parents find some way to pay for college and  then I don't get accepted...  I'd seriously be heart broken and like cry for weeks. I'm soo scared failing at anything and everything. That's what I hate about myself, I'm so worried what other think and I'm so freaked about what people will think when/if I suck @ something. I don't understand why some people think of me as an overachiever or this is extreme perfectionist. If you want the truth, yeah I  REALLY  use to wanna be perfect. Like less than a year ago I felt this way. What made me stop you ask? What others were saying about the people who were pretty close to "perfect." I don't understand how people get by on not caring what others think. It just doesn't make sense to me. I don't know when I started to care. In 5th grade, I sure didn't. I was anti-school spirit and "punkish" but got straight A's and was a pretty good student, if I do say so myself. But in 6th grade, it just changed. I think I know what changed...maybe it was because I got my period that summer? Seriously! I was first of my friends to get it, maybe that's what happened? Well, I have no clue...now that I've ranted on for about a half hour, I'm gonna go take a shower and go to bed. I probably won't add another posting til Monday nite, so see ya then! Muah!

      Hey guys!  I've got my own website!  Wait, does this count as my "own?" Too bad if it doesn't because I'm still calling it my own! Since this is my first posting, I'm not gonna get in too deep and talk a lot about the  BIG  stuff in my life...I'll save that for Posting Number  2 ! I'm still getting used to all this "stuff." Right now, I'm waiting for Candy to sign back on and ask her how to fill in my "personal profile" or whatever it's called! Well, I'm off like a prom dress *as my sister says, which makes a lot of sense* to mess around with these setting and maybe figure out how to work some stuff!

      Why you ask? Because my so called "friends" are too lazy to invite me anywhere. Well, maybe they're not. Maybe they  just don't want me there.  The last time I hung out w/ any of my friends (and soccer does not count) was Saturday at the festival. If that really even counts as hanging out. They ditched me pretty much the whole night. Even at soccer, I feel like a loser. And soccer is suppose to be one of my "escapes." I mean obviously I know my friends do things and hang out w/ other people. So when they  surprisingly  call me, it's stupid of them to act like they did nothing and all this. I hate when people have to get all sneaky about shit. Just proves to me that there's no person in this entire world I can trust  completely.   I just wish one person would come into my life and make me happier, care about me, not hurt me...I just wish I didn't have to feel like this...

      Okay, so I was looking at Julia's profile and I came across this link to some guy's website. I clicked on it and on the site, there are a bunch of quizzes. I took 'em all. Check out www.emojoe.com for all the quizzes and other fun stuff. Here are the results!  -How Emo Are You? First of all, I never knew emo was short for "emotional." I always thought emo's were a different form of punk rockers but I was wrong. Turns out I'm 55% Emo!!  -I am 10% Hardcore Emo.  -I'm 5% Punk.  -I'm 5% Hardcore Punk.  -I'm 30% Punk Poser.  -I'm 5% Ska. I have no idea what the fuck ska is! The only reason I got a 5% was because I have long curly hair, is that my problem?!  -I'm 20% Skate Poser! Matt would be proud!  -I'm 65% Prep! YAY FOR PREPS! Sorry, I'm a prep guys...  -I'm 20% Loser! YAY FOR LOSERS! My parents named me Lauren for a reason...L is for Loser!  -I'm 40% Kaitis...whatever that is...  -I'm 10% Freak.  -I'm 20% Smob only because I like shiny objects and listen to MTV and all that.

      So the last two nights I've been spending a few hours just writing. And this morning I was like, "Wow. This feels good. I'm getting these feelings out in a healthy way. And I don't feel depressed about them anymore." But later in the day, because of  one  person, I felt miserable again. All the feelings I thought I had gotten out from writing, rushed back in and made me feel like shit. And what feeling decides to come back and be just as strong as before?  My feelings for Chris.  He said sorry, we're friends, yeah, end of story, right? Wrong. I'm still upset about a lot of things and my heart is still broken. Being friends doesn't replace the emotional attachments we had together. Lately, I've been in one of those stages  where everything reminds me of him!  Especially this song, (So Much For) My Happy Endings by Avril Lavigne. Check out the lyrics:  So much for my happy ending  oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh Oh oh, oh oh, oh...  Let's talk this over  It's not like we're dead   Was it something I did?  Was it something You said?   Don't leave me hanging  In a city so dead  Held up so high  On such a breakable thread    You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be    CHORUS   You were everything, everything that I wanted  We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it  All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away  All this time you were pretending  So much for my happy ending   oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh Oh oh, oh oh  You've got your dumb friends  I know what they say  They tell you I'm difficult  But so are they  But they don't know me  Do they even know you?  All the things you hide from me  All the shit that you do   You were all the things I thought I knew  And I thought we could be   CHORUS    It's nice to know that you were there  Thanks for acting like you cared  And making me feel like I was the only one  It's nice to know we had it all  Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done    CHORUS X 2   oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh...  All the bold parts are parts that describe how I feel... "Was it something I did? Was it something You said?" It's like, Why did we break up? What happened? "You were all the things I thought I knew, And I thought we could be" I thought we'd last. "You were everything, everything that I wanted, We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it. All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away. All this time you were pretending. So much for my happy ending"  He was everything I wanted.  And now the memories are gone... Whether or not he was actually pretending, it sure as hell felt like it when he dumped me. "It's nice to know that you were there. Thanks for acting like you cared. And making me feel like I was the only one. It's nice to know we had it all. Thanks for watching as I fall, And letting me know we were done." I really thought he cared, I really felt like the only one, we really did have it all. He did watch me as I fell and just kept on watching...

      Well with my blood blister increasing in size about everyday, I decided to  pop it  last nite. I figured one good poke from the pin and  all  the blood would come out.  Boy, was I wrong.  I sat there poking it for like 10 minutes. At the end of those 10 minutes, not even  half  the blood was gone. Not even  3/4  of the blood was gone. So then I figured I might as well pull off the whole skin that covers the blood! And that worked! GO ME!  Saturday when Alex told me to write, I was too lazy so I just went to bed. Then last night, I actually got to it. I wrote I think 4 or 5 whole poems and I'm still working on two others. But it's so awesome because when I'm writing, hidden away in my room, my music blasting, and paper all over the floor is when I get into this  zone . It's just me and my words. I could never write a poem in a crowd of 200 people at a concert, like ones I write when I'm all by myself. Writing is such an amazing thing to me. It makes me so much happier. Even if I write a depressing poem, I'm soo happy because I got those depressed feelings  out of me.  And the music I listen to while writing, heavily influences my ability. Like when I first started writing last night, I was listening to the radio. I can't handle people talking [on the radio] because it messes up my concentration. Even listening to the music on the radio is hard because it all varies so much. And I try to stick to one type of music so I'm relaxed throughout the entire period of my writing. Usually I listen to Jimmy Eat World. I dunno, it's just  something  about their music. I love them! When I write all that matters is what I'm writing about. I don't care about everything else that's going wrong until I finish the poem I'm working on. And that's cool. I get like that in soccer too. When I'm playing, the only thing that matters is the game. When I'm pushing myself to the point of me wanting to die, I don't feel it until after I'm done pushing myself. I dunno, it's really cool to think that those two things (writing and soccer) are my escape from the real world. The things that I can run to when I'm in need. But I know that they quickly become things to  run from  when people put such  pressure  of them so they don't feel like escapes, they feel like  chores .

      AHHH! I'm soo confused! I don't know what to do! I'm so torn... Mike tried helping me but we both know that neither of us have control over this situation. A person has no control over how they feel inside. I mean, I guess you do. But deep down, you can tell your mind you don't like something, but really your heart decides whether it does or not... not you.  I just wish life wasn't so damn complicated...but as Margaret says, "what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger." But doesn't a person ever get scared  that it will kill them?  Oh well, I'm gonna go write some (Alex told me it would help me deal with my feelings...), maybe I'll post the stuff I write...good nite! sweet dreams~

      Lately everyone knows that I haven't been myself and that I've been sorta depressed. And a lot of it has to do with Chris. I've been holding out on telling you guys what's been bugging me because the last time I wrote about Chris and me in here,  he flipped out . When he found out I put our convo in here, it wasn't good. That night we had a big fight and he said some pretty mean things that I would have never expected him to say.  Ever.  And I'm just so sick of hiding this from you guys that I'm just gonna tell you. And if Chris gets even more mad at me, so be it. He can't hurt me much more than he already did. People say kids don't know what true love is but whatever I felt, I considered it love. I loved Chris more than any other guy I've ever dated, more than any other person I ever liked, or ever wanted to date. Together, we had so many good times, jokes, and fun. And now... now it's all gone.  Now every time our song comes on the radio, I just wanna cry. I listen to the lyrics and think of how true they really were.   Hoobastank -- "The Reason"  I'm not a perfect person There are many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new  and the reason is you   It seems like now that we're broken up, our song is on the radio a lot more. It's almost like the radio station knows that I want to hear it but then I don't. Every time I go to call someone a jackass now, I stop. Because I called Chris a jackass and it was one of those "us" things. Every time we hang out, I have to stop myself from going up to him and hugging him or holding his hand. Because  things aren't like that anymore . Every time I think about everything he said to me, I get upset. It's like he  never  meant it.  Any of it.  Every time I think about one of my friends saying, "I can never see you two breaking up...you're like the  perfect  couple," I think about how I believed them. And every time I go back and listen to the promises he made, I just wanna cry. Because  he didn't keep them . It's hard living with a broken heart and I am trying my best. I don't like dwelling in the past but I don't have much hope in the future so it keeps me in the past. I never thought he'd be one of those boys to break my heart,  but I guess I was wrong.

      Where do you turn when the past is all you need but the future is nothing to look forward to?  Between holding hands and falling in love, you begin to learn that: kisses don't always mean something, promises can be broken (just as quickly as they were made), and  sometimes, goodbyes really are forever.   What's the point in smiling if you have  no one  to smile for?  *I'm not supposed to love you, I'm not supposed to care, I'm not supposed to live my life, wishing you were there. I'm not supposed to wonder where you are or what you do, I'm sorry I just can't help myself, I fell in love with you*  When you fall into love, be prepared for the other person to fall out...most relationships  DON'T  last a lifetime!!  I'm gonna smile like nothing's wrong, talk like everything's perfect, act like it's just a dream, and pretend he's not hurting me.  *Not All Scars Show* *Not All Wounds Heal* *Sometimes You Can't Always See* *The Pain Someone Feels*   The closer we grow, the further away we get.

      I think it's more like "just one of those  weeks ..." I've been so out of it and messed up for like a week. I'm biting my nails all the time now. I'm hardly hungry. And I just feel like  shit . I have a lot of reasons why. Some I just can't say and others I just don't wanna get into. But I keep thinking, "why do I even do this? it's not like you guys care..." A few days ago someone told me that you just have to realize people aren't always gonna care if you're miserable. I dunno if you only enjoy my "happy" posts, all my posts *happy and sad*, or  if you even like this to begin with? ? Sometimes I don't even see a point in life. Sometimes I don't even see why I should try so hard to be everyone's friend, to get some guy to like me, to make people happy, to make myself happy, succeed, anything. I just don't see the point recently. Especially in this. I wanna write so much to you guys but people are holding me back from what I really need to say. But I guess half the stuff I need to say, I wouldn't say in here anyways. I guess you'll just have to rely on these quotes to describe how I feel.  -Sometimes, people build you up, just to knock you down.-  -Before you are accepted by your peers, you must accept yourself.-  -You break my heart into a thousand pieces and you say it's because I deserve better?-  -I think I'm afraid of being happy because every time I'm happy something bad always happens...-  Later guys...

      So my uncle just called and I answered the phone. He said, "Hi  LAUREN ." OMG! He got my name right! Most of the time he calls me Margaret or thinks I'm my mom. Everyone (like older family members) always confuses my voice with Margaret's or mom's. YAY!

      Okay so it's like 1 PM and I'm still in my PJ's. I got up around 12ish okay, that's why. The sky was acting all weird and stuff and you know it's gonna storm so I'm like, "Mom, our garbage cans are in the street." The wind blew 'em there. So she says, "Wanna go put them back on the lawn and take the dogs out?" So I'm like fine whatever and I go outside to do that. I wasn't wearing a bra though! (I sleep without a bra on) I hate walking around without a bra. It feels weird! I like my breasts to be supported, thank you very much! I feel very naked without a bra. Just felt like sharing.

      I feel  so alone  right now. All my friends are out and here I am, sitting at home, writing in this, and listening to music. God, I'm seriously such a loser. I hate how my emotions always go from one extreme to the next. And it seems that whenever I'm happy, something gets screwed up and I get really upset so it's like I don't even benefit from being happy. Josh calls me crazy, I know I have problems but who doesn't? I admitted I wanna go to therapy to several people and that's one of my reasons for wanting to be a psychologist. So I can help teens who have problems like me and need help or just someone to talk to. I can't write and I dunno why. It sucks because I have so much to write about but nothing comes out. I really wanna try writing a song but it always turns into a poem. I wanna write a book, I have it all in my head, but when I try to put it on paper it's  not good enough.  I've always had that problem... you have the perfect image of something in your head and when you try to make it real, it just looks like  shit . God, and I try soo hard to have a good and close relationship with my mom but I can't. I can't tell her anything because she's always has some "mom" crap to say. She doesn't back up her word and she's way too protective of me. She thinks I only like things because my sister likes them. But if she knew me, then she'd know how different Margaret and I are. Sure, we have things in common but it's not because I wanna be like Margaret so I like it, M's made her fair share of mistakes that I feel I'll never make. The piercings, tattoos, and dyed hair I want have nothing to do with M's piercing, tattoos, or dyed hair. It's all because that's who I am and that's what I want. I want my mom to let me experiment now so that when I go off to college and she only sees me at Christmas, she won't be surprised when I come home with red hair, a pierced nose, and a tattoo.  I guess I just wanna make sure she'll still love me even with the "changes" I'll do to myself.  I don't feel like my mom really listens, ya know?  I mean she listens but doesn't LISTENS...  Like when I'm walking around the house miserable and saying I'm fine whenever someone asks me if I'm okay, she should know I'm not fine and ask me if I wanna talk about it or try to find out what's up, ya know? I've never really been best friends with my mom. And I get so jealous when I hear people say their mom is their best friend or when I see my friends treat their moms like crap. If my mom tried to be half as involved in my life as my friends moms did, I'd be so happy. Don't get me wrong, she's a good mom and all that...it's just I want more. I guess that's why I feel soo alone in life because despite the few good friends I have and the family, I still don't feel like I can tell them everything so I guess that's why I write so much poetry and why I write so much in here. (Chris if you're reading this, this should explain some things) I was never good with speaking words. I'm  very  emotional. I cry like three times a day. Sometimes over fights or friends or ex-boyfriends...sometimes over  nothing . Written words are something I'm good at. I can write something and post it and not know people's instant reaction. Not knowing is good for me. When I say things aloud to a person I can see the sorrow or pain or anger, and I'm sure as hell not good at that. Because I'm not good with face to face conflict. So writing in this blog and writing my poems is like a real conversation with myself. I am telling myself what's wrong, what happened, how I feel, and all that. And when other people read it, they can sorta see how my brain works and why I feel a certain way. I'm not sure if I'm making sense but I hope someone understands. I dunno if this is true but I feel like I'm saying the things you guys all feel but are afraid to say. That's what I want this to do. Make you guys know that you're not the only one who feels like this and talking about it is okay. Sure, it can cause problems and cause people to get mad at you but this is a risk I'm willing to take. I have soo much built up anger and pain and fears that I'm sick of holding in it. I feel like most of you hate me anyways so why keep it locked inside much longer? Like my sister told me in May, " at the end of the day, you only have yourself ...but you also have me, so make  yourself  happy!" Chris got mad at me for putting our exact convo in one of my old posts and I truly feel bad but I lost him anyways so why should it matter? I thought about editing that post and changing what it said but I thought to myself,  "why? you've always changed yourself to please people, you've always hid how you felt to make sure people didn't think differently of you, you've always made sure to be like everyone else."  And I'm sick of that. There are a zillion things I could tell you guys right now that I bet none of you could ever imagine me doing or thinking. I guess this is a good time for those... I've tried starving myself *didn't work* I've tried making myself throw up *didn't worked* I tried cutting myself. And this worked. Yup, that's right, I  was  a cutter. But luckily I told the right two people and they were there for me the whole damn way. Cutting helped me deal with the pain I felt on the outside. I don't know what made me do it that first night but I did it and it helped the pain. So I just kept doing it. Like I say below, the last two times hurt like hell, I had the scabs for a few weeks and had to hide under sweatshirts for the first few days of it.  I've been clean for 6 weeks and one day.  It's so strange, the whole time of me cutting myself, Chris was the only one who ever noticed the cuts. I never told the rest of you because I knew how you'd react and I was scared that those reactions would lead to you not wanting to be around me because I was "weird" or something but I guess this is the time for you to know. Sorry guys...

      You guys I'm seriously so stressed out and frustrated. Today I went to go running so I used my inhaler. I was running for less than  2 minutes  when I started having trouble breathing! I was like  HELL NO!  The inhaler helped me everywhere else but running! And running is really what I need it for! I play soccer and run track, I need to be able to run! God, if I can't play soccer, I swear,  I'll go crazy . Now I have to go to my doctor and do all these because they thought I had sports-induced asthma but I guess I don't or I wouldn't have felt that bad within 2 minutes...

       So hard to gain and so easy to lose.  It takes months for someone to gain your full trust (or your almost full trust) but it only requires a few minutes to  lose it all.  Yup, that's how it usually goes. I've had this happen so many times. I would be fighting with a person and they would know exactly what to say to piss me off and hit me the hardest. And the people you least expected to ever say the one thing that would hurt the hardest,  always do ... Another thing, I hate how people speak out of anger. Because usually speaking out of anger leads then to people saying the worst possible things. Also, I hate it when you give people a second chance and they  throw it right back at you ...

      Guess what guys? 3 apparently isn't a charm because  Chris just broke up w/ me.   Again.  WoW... Last night when everyone went to Lacy's, I don't think Chris was going to even tell me he was, more or less invite me to go w/ him. So I was all like, "what's up w/ that?" Then today, he was being really weird and mean to me and Annie on the phone. I went to a few minutes of his game and then swimming with Annie. So when I came home I went online and started talking to him.  He was acting " cold " ya know? So I was like, "are you mad @ me or something?" (him) "no i dono its just  weird ..." (me) "what's weird?" (him) " i dono like this time we started going out i didnt like u as much as i did the last 2 times its weird" (me) "ooo, when did that happen?" (him) "???? i dono im trying to talk it out and not like do stuff right away" (me) well what's different (him) "i dono i dont like u as much as i use to and i dont wana hurt u" (me) "well what now?" (him) "wat u mean by wat now?" (me) "well u said u don't like me as much n it seems like  ur setting me up to prepare for u breaking up w/ me  is that what ur trying to do?" (him) "like i dono i think it would be easyr as u said to wait to school starts back up and sorrry 4 that im reallly srry 4 blowing away that chance u gave but i think we should be friends till school starts back up srtrrry g2g srrrrrry"  WTF? Okay,  twice  in  one  fucking week? No, I don't play these games. I hope you're reading this Chris b/c this is for you. Tried talking it out how? You call saying you don't like me as much anymore as talking it out? That's not how it works. I'm very, very pissed off. Once again, you broke up w/ me and hardly told me why. What happened this time? You were sure as hell fine Sunday when we were  making out  and all that. Monday, yeah you were fine at the pool. But then you didn't seem to care to mention to me about Lacy's, I don't think I would have even known you were going unless I IMed you. I recall you telling me that you'd never hurt me again, well guess what you just did. I don't wanna spend my time liking you if all you're gonna do is let me down and hurt me. I loved you more than any boyfriend I've ever had and I thought you felt the same way...  I'm really pissed off and upset at the world at this point...

      Okay, so I was just watching this movie on Lifetime. Yeah, yeah... Lifetime, I know!  But every once in awhile there's nothing good on and they'll have on a movie that sounds good. Tonight it was called "Painful Secrets" or something like that. It was about a girl who cuts herself because of all the crap in her life. And I can relate, I know a few people (very close to them) who cut themselves. The movie, in my opinion, was a bull shit look at a cutter's life. First of all, the girl in the movie didn't really have problems. Like  big  ones... Her parents frought a little in the beginning and she had no friends but her parents didn't scream their lungs out or beat each other. And no one actually made fun of her in a terrible way, it was bearable. Cutters don't really cut for the above reasons. They have  more intense  excuses. They feel like they have so much pain in their life that the pain they cause on themselves makes it feel like they have control over at least one thing. How much they bleed, how deep the cut, how long the cut, how many cuts...those types of things they have control over. Some, they do the first cut and then they just zone out until they're done, and  THEN  they realize what they just did and how bad or how much and so on. Most of them know what they're doing is wrong and harmful but it helps them and some aren't as extreme as others so it doesn't bother them. I know a lot of people will disagree w/ me but whatever: I feel if a person is causing harm to themselves in a small amount yet feels better after they do whatever is "their thing" then so be it. They're not soo extreme where they're gonna kill themselves so just let 'em be. But watch out for them to make sure they don't hurt themselves. I believe that if you know a person with a problem such as cutting or an eating disorder if you make it clear that they can come to talk to you anytime about anything, especially their problem, and if they talk to you, you can give them the help they need to stop and realize new ways of dealing with pain. sigh. The movie was just bad. It didn't even show how the girl really felt or how she started and why she kept going deeper and deeper. And her therapy sessions were nothing...  Lifetime, your movies suck!  Or at least do some research on the topic before you make a movie on it! Great, more drama, fill ya in later!

      I have a bunch I could tell you but I don't really feel like it. Why? I just don't feel good. And I am very sure that I'm not up for partying. Some of my friends want me to go to Lacy's (one of my friends) but I just don't feel good. So when I tell them that they're all like, "Well, Chris is going...you should too..." Okay, I understand my boyfriend will be there but that doesn't change how I feel. And plus, no offense, I don't wanna go to a party where the hostess will be all over every single guy. I think I'm just in a crappy mood.  PMS maybe?  A bowl of  ice cream  might fix it! Last night I went to Chris' and there were a bunch of people there. We were outside and stuff, blah blah blah... Then it starts like storming and for awhile it's only thundering (no rain or lightning) then it starts to drizzle and soon it's pouring. So Chris and I went into the garage and slowly everyone in there left. We just sat there talking and stuff and then we're like, "Everyone's probly out front." Wrong! Everyone went to the park down the street and was like soaking wet! Then Chris was like, "Let's jump on the trampoline!" Remember, this is when it's still storming and not so warm anymore. Yeah so by the end of the night we were soaked! And I had white shorts on so they were  see through  after behind pushed down/pinned to the trampoline by several people!  At least Chris was happy...  It was fun! Well, I don't feel good so I'm gonna go lay down and watch a movie! Muah~

      Seriously...tears of  joy  for once! Wanna know why? Here's the story... My friends were invited to Kristin's birthday party and I wasn't (which is cool because we don't really hang out) so I was gonna have Chris over. But Chris told me Anthony invited him to his bro's grad party and I was like, "Go, you know why..." Then Maura asked me to go baby sit w/ her and sleep over after but the 'rents didn't want me to because I'd hardly been home the past 2-3 days. I was pretty bummed thinking it was gonna be one of those nights  doing nothing . Around 9, I was soo flipping bored! There was nothing good on TV, no one good online, everyone was at some party, I was home alone, I mean come on! So Eddie (my brother) comes home from work around 9:30 and calls my cousin who's up from Columbus because I told Eddie he had called. Like 10 minutes later my brother comes out of his room and he's like, "Hey, what are you doing tonight?" (me) "Nothing." (him) "Wanna come to Matt's w/ me? They're having a big cook out and Uncle Pat and  DAD  should be there..." For those of you who don't know, my parents have been divorced since I was 6.  The last real conversation I had with my Dad was Valentine's Day '97. The last time I saw him was around Memorial Day in 6th grade but all he said was, "Hey, how you guys doing?"  I jumped at the chance to (one) leave this house and do something (two) see my family! I was ready in like 5 minutes...which is pretty quick if you ask me! I even beat Eddie! When I was putting on my mascara I was  shaking soo much ! It was crazy! So yeah, we finally get there. Eddie and I just got out of the car and someone is walking towards us. It was really dark (by the way, we left at 10pm) and this guy (it was either my dad or my uncle) comes up and hugs us and says, "God, I love you guys." I realized it was my dad. You guys, it took me more than 7 years to get that fucking hug. So then I see my Uncle Pat and he says hi and all that. I was the only girl but I was cool with that. There was a bunch of small talk and lots of pictures. You guys don't know how good it feels to be with someone you haven't spent "quality" time with in  7 years ! My dad and my uncle were cooking out and after stuffing ourselves, we started a fire. (I'm leaving out lots of details but it's 1:31 AM and I just got home and I'll tell you the ones I left out in the next post) So I was just sitting in a chair by myself and my dad comes over and starts talking to me. We were talking about his job and then it got kinda intense. He's like, "Hold this flashlight right here." He takes out his wallet and opens it up...inside is a Christmas photo (like the professional, "everyone dress up!" kinda one) of Margaret, Eddie, and me. He's like, "I never stopped thinking about you guys...I missed you soo much." That right there... After all these years I've spent thinking my dad hated me and didn't wanna be a part of my life. That's why I wanted to be perfect, I thought it was I was soo good at everything, he'd wanna stick around and get to know me. This was one of the greatest nights,  ever.  With one hug, everything came together. One hug and I forgave him for all the shit he put me through. He started asking me how school was and what I did and stuff. I told him I was class president and he's like, "That kicks ass!" I told him how I write and have gotten published. "You have to bring me some of those poems! I'll pay ya, seriously..."  Just to have my dad care like that , it was enough to make me cry. I can't say I remember ever crying tears of joy. But this was totally a time for those. Just saying the words "dad" and knowing that I was saying it to my dad! OMG, when he was showing me the picture of me and my sibs @ Xmas time, he started crying! I was like, omg!  He really does love us , he's not just making small talk... OMG! Thank you soo much Kristin for having your party tonight, Chris for going to a grad party, and the 'rents for not letting me go b-sitting w/ Maura!  You guys...I am seriously the happiest I've been in years...no lie.  Good night, more details tomorrow, love ya!

      Yup,  two days ...I guess that was a long enough break for me. I feel like I'm a bitch for making such a big deal about needing a break and then two days later, I'm going back out w/ Chris. I seriously thought a break would require more than two days. And I was so worried about losing Chris during that break... But yesterday, Annie, her siblings, and me all went to his baseball game. It was so hard for me because I didn't know how to act or whether or not to cheer for him. I'm not good with the "Do's and Don'ts" of break ups, okay? Then we went back to Annie's and she decided to call him and ask him to come over. And to my delight, he did! See, I still liked him, it was just I figured if we were apart for awhile people would stop saying shit and trying to break us up... but I guess the love I had for him over powered the desire to satisfy everyone else . And I think I'm learning to not care what other people think. So he came over and we were watching the MTV Movie Awards. I was so mad because he was sitting in the chair which left the couch to Annie and me. I wanted to sit by him! It was all so frustrating! I just wanted to hold his hand  but I knew I screwed up and I couldn't do that . So I got to the point where I decided to ask him out  myself . Two days was a break enough for me at that moment. I pulled Annie into her room and discussed it with her...so she sent him a text message saying, "will you go out w/ Lauren?"  I was so scared he'd say no...   So I'm sitting there and he didn't say anything for awhile and Annie asked him if he was playing a game. Go figure, he was. So here I go trying to hit the end button so he can see the message... I put the message on the screen, he read it, and  nodded!!!  Big sigh of relief!! Major thanks go out to Annie, who seriously has to be one the greatest friends ever! See this is the  third  time Chris and me have gone out...and every time Annie is involved in a big way.  Ann , thank you so much for doing this and always being there for me! I love ya with all my heart!  Air , thanks for always being so supportive of my dreams and always being such a great friend!  Kristina , my twin...12 years...so many memories, it's hard to remember them all. We have our little fights but in the end we always come out closer!   , Thanks for giving me yet another chance...you're the greatest boyfriend I could ask for... I'm sorry for being a bitch!  Remember, three's a charm!!   I LOVE YOU ALWAYS n FOREVER!   Maura , sweetie, you know I'm always here for you! Thanks for always being so understanding of my many problems!!   Mike  , thanks for being like one of the girls and for all the hours of advice. And thanks for me getting me to quit and find new ways of dealing with pain.  Gretchen , despite the miles of difference in our lives, you have always been so supportive and understanding!  Alecia , my other half! Hun, I'm so glad I have you! You're sooo awesome! We both have two boyfriends again! YaY! These eight people are the ones who have been so awesome and made such a difference in my life. Each in their own unique way. These eight are the people I can count on, believe, and trust with  anything . It feels good to finally realize, I may not have many friends but the ones I do have are the greatest ones anyone could ask for! I love you all! But I can't forget Candy, Gen, Sheryl, Britt, Kevin, Erin, Reea, Jamie, Tracy, and Ceili...

      This is just for the record, I realized last nite that  I do  need a break from guys more than anything else at this time. And if I lose Chris to taking a break,  then I guess it wasn't meant to be.  Sigh... I still have to deal w/ the people who stab me in the back quite often yet call themselves my friends... One, for example, told everyone at VASJ to hate me if I decide to go there. Two were in on trying to break Chris and me up. (and one of them blamed it all on the one who I hate) Someone asked the one I hate to convince Chris to break up w/ me. So I guess what happened, really  made everyone else happy .

      So I talked to Chris last nite... I found out what really happened and Carly is pretty much to blame. Go figure...I mean she hates me and would do anything to see me miserable! I'm just totally confused now because I think I still like him but I mean, he broke up w/ me w/out even trying to talk it out! He believed a girl that hates me! I feel like I sorta lost his trust or something. I dunno, this is all very complex. I had something great and now I don't.  Do I want it back?  I dunno...  I just can't believe how fast it ended.  We were together for like 5 months! (from the two times we went out) That's almost half a year! Is that too long for two 14 year olds relationship? I dunno... In high school, I'm gonna be soo busy. I mean soccer, school work, class president duties, trying to have a life, probly student council, I mean do I really wanna throw a boyfriend in there? I mean, sure, it'd be nice but it'd be hard to juggle everything... I guess whatever happens, happens... but for right now I think  I'm gonna try to be single ... Sorry Chris, hope we can still be friends...

      So it's later in the day and I talked to Chris... he thinks "we're better off as friends."  I didn't cry then...but when I first started realizing things I did. It's depressing and I'm  very  pissed off.  His reasons are bull shit  and he didn't even try talking this out. Yet he told me he loved me more than any other girlfriend. Whatever, I guess guys change how they feel. It hurts to know that our relationship ended  just like that . Yesterday at his game everything was fine but then something went wrong by the end of the night. Whatever, if he wants to be like that then fine. I'm probly going to the Cos Friday so  I'll just hook up with a few guys . Love is one thing ((meaning, it's special)) but flirting is a completely different story! Wink, Wink! I guess my way of dealing with pain now, is just forgetting about it and moving on. It's not like I can do  what I used  to...I've been clean for 6 wks... YAY!

      I lied to someone. And in my eyes, it was a  big lie.  I mean I should probly use names because the people that this includes would never bother to read this but I'm not going to. I can't tell you exactly what happened and what I lied about because I'm afraid it would ruin everything that's left. But I'm admitting to you guys that I screwed up and lied to certain people.   I woke up early compared to usual. Ate breakfast, attempted to do crunches but my body wasn't awake enough yet, and then came online. I wish I didn't. That's when it all went downhill. So I have this little habit of reading everyone's a/m's and profiles when I have nothing else to do. So I hit the "Guys" list on my BL and who's first? Chris, obviously. Who those of you who don't know, Chris is my boyfriend. I read his a/m and then glance down at his profile.  BIG MISTAKE.  For the past, I dunno, but it's been awhile, he's had "!!!I LOVE LOR!!!"  But today, he didn't.  Me, being, the type of person who freaks out at tiny things, (go figure) started freaking out. I IMed Erica to talk. I thought maybe I was being too worried. Once I told Air what happened, she said, "Sorry, I don't wanna lie but Chris was talking to me about you last nite... you should talk to him and not me ." Then I was telling Alecia what happened. For those of you who don't know, Alecia is like my sister, we call ourselves, "other halves." She was like, "TALK TO HIM!" So I'm waiting until I talk to Annie to call Chris. And guess what? I realized something else that sends me more downhill.  He has a Buddyprofile.  So I went and read it, seeing if he took out everything about me. And guess what?  He did.  My birthday was out of the count down area but most importantly, he took out something in his "Me" page. It used to say "but most importantly I love Lor more than anything."  Now it says, "I love football and wrestling more than anything else."  Yeah, pain... a lot of it ... I'm gonna go call Annie and then I'm gonna call Chris. (gulp) I'll fill ya in later.

      Ever charming...ha ha! I'm such a good liar! At least I don't consider myself anything near charming. So last night I decided I was putting off writing my book for long enough. I wrote like ten different beginnings. Being honest,   I didn't expect it to be this hard.   I really wanna get a head start on writing it and be done by the time I'm out of high school but it seems like it's gonna take so much longer! Go figure. Well, listen to this! All year in algebra I've gotten B's. The B in the first quarter was such a shocker because in 5th grade, I only got one B. In 6th and 7th I got straight A's all year. So to come into 8th grade and have a teacher I didn't like at all (at the time) and get a B,  I was pissed.  Second quarter, I didn't really care because what was the point in getting an A now, ya know? 3rd quarter, I was slipping to almost a C, luckily I kept the B. Now, I'm am this damn close to an A. What's different now that I really want the A? To prove to my parents that I can! And I feel like if I get it, it'll be a gateway for me to get my belly button pierced. Tomorrow is our last quiz. aka the last chance I have to get that damn A! So I was "calcutating" my grade today in Mazer's (my math teacher) room. I found out that even if I got 100% on the quiz that I'd still have a B. So I went and told Mr. Mazer that. He told me that if I get a 100% on the quiz tomorrow that he'll give me an A for the quarter. I have this thing where I can never believe in myself and I don't think I'm gonna get the A. It feels like I've worked my ass off just to have it all thrown away. I mean I have my reasons for not believing in myself. (1) I've only gotten one 100% this year. That was on the Cedar Point quiz which I felt was quite easy.  (2) The pressure of knowing that I  have  to get an A will prevent me from doing so. RR! Stress! Well, I really don't have anything to talk about so I'm gonna go read my book which is very addicting...Oh by the way, Laboda is having a huge end of the year party Friday at his house, anyone can come! Don't know the times yet but just keep it in mind! Jules, that means you!

      Here's the deal. I was on student council these last two years at WMS. 7th grade, I was on the spirit committee and this year, I was the spirit chairman. So I was all for running for class president. I figured Jessica would want to run for president too because in 7th grade she decided against running against me for spirit chairman. But Kristina told me Jess was just gonna run for VP because she knew I'd beat her. THOSE ARE NOT MY WORDS! So that's what I thought. Then it came time to find people to run for all the positions. A bunch of my guy friends took papers and were like, "Yeah Lor, I'm gonna beat you!" And those things upset me because I'd count on votes from them for me to win, ya know? But obviously in the end none of them ran. So what does the ballot say for all the positions? Candy, the only one running for treasurer. Gen, the only one running for sectary. (spellingon those two positions??) Erica, the only one running for vice president. For president, me (well duh!) and guess who? Jessica. It's not that I was mad, I just wish the girl would have told me other than pretty much lying to me. She told me like a week before the due date of who was running, that she was going for VP and she wouldn't run against me. But hey! She didn't try to tell me she changed her mind! That right there, I didn't respected. So yeah, it was pretty tense with the two of us the week of campaigning. I mean I didn't really like her to begin with but throw in her whining about me stealing her idea to hand out suckers (for which I didn't! and my god,  they're fucking suckers!)  I was ready to just slap her! And then the speeches came. I completely  hate  any form of public speaking. I can write the speech and I could even read it if I didn't have to look up. See, it's the eye contact thing that scares me. I don't know exactly why but I just don't like "eye contact." I messed up on my speech and cut things out and stumbled over my own writing. I kept losing my place. Those are the types of things I always do. But I felt like I did "okay." Jess was after me. And if I do say so myself, she had a really good speech. A lot better than mine I know! At that point I was getting a little nervous. So then we all went back to home room and voted. I didn't know one person who voted for Jess until today. And even now I only know two. I'm not saying it in a mean way, I'm just telling you guys. So we didn't find out until today who won...and guess what?  I WON!  I was really happy about that! I just hate the whole election and campaigning process. And guess what?  Chris is the first man!  Oh and my face isn't all black and blue. It's somewhat discolored and it hurts like a mother! So hopefully it'll feel better in a few days! Well, I'm gonna go eat! I'll probly be back after to write some more because I'm such a loser!

      Damn it! Why does the world make such a big deal over a competition or an election or a football game? I know a lot of it is spirit but there is a possibility of  too much spirit.  Especially at school! Take today as an example. The whole 8th grade split up into two teams for "capture the flag." So here I am thinking, "YAY! This is gonna be awesome! No classes, just fun." Boy was I wrong! See, no one told me we'd be running...that was very bad and it pissed me off. Why you ask? Because I have an inhaler that I have to use 20 minutes before any running activity in order to breathe easily. And I didn't use it so obviously, I couldn't breathe very easy. So we start the "game."  Within 2 minutes ,  I already ran into 2 people and hurt my knee.   A few minutes later, guess what? Ran into someone else and hurt my shin! Yeah, so I was having LOTS of fun! (BULL SHIT!) We were also losing so I was even happier about that! So here I am running towards the damn red flag trying to tag it (don't ask, the teachers changed the rules and we had to tag the flag 30 times before we could run with it) and  I just get smacked in the face with someone's shoulder!  It was someone from my team and it was an accident but it pissed me off because I seriously flew and landed on the ground, not moving. All of this happened in front of a teacher. A teacher whom didn't even bother to ask if I was okay. I was on the ground, laying on my tummy,  fucking crying!  Okay, people don't see me cry much so, yes, it was a big deal! And I was on the ground for like 3 minutes and walking around by the teacher for like 5 more minutes. You would think they'd care. That's the funny thing...in the beginning they set all these rules (especially about hitting/tagging people) but once the game started they didn't really care! RR! I was so pissed! And if I go to school tomorrow with a black eye and bruised cheek and one of them asks me how that happens,  I'm gonna scream!  Now that I got that off my chest, I'm gonna go  ice my face  and read a book! Damn world...

       So just a little bit ago, I signed into my email and I was happy to see that someone commented on my blog. I have it set so I get an email every time someone comments. I've only gotten 1 or 2  bad comments  in the past and I think they were about my use of swear words and how I'm not the only one with problems. So I was a little surprised to see I got a  third  bad comment. Not truly terrible but not exactly sweet. The person just said I don't need to tell everyone my whole life and I'm not the only one with problems.  Well, ya think?  I know I'm not the only one with problems. The thing that gets me upset the most about this comment is that  no one is being forced to read this website. No one is standing next to you and making your hand click on the link to this from my profile. If you have a problem with it, then don't read it. It's that easy.   But people just need something to bitch about so they choose to bitch about this. Well fuck you then.  One day when I'm rich and famous for this kind of writing, you're gonna think back to tonight and say to yourself,  "Wow. That was the girl who told us her whole life. Now she's making millions for it."    People today.  Any who. I went to bed at around 4:30. It was crazy because my whole family (except for my sister) was up. It felt like 11 to me. I dunno, I think  I was on some sort of high last night.  I woke up around 12ish, ate, got dressed, watched some of Office Space. Eddie always told me it was freaking hilarious, I just never got around to watching it. Turns out, it is pretty good.  Damn straight.  LoL! That's funny! So then I read some, cleaned, went through magazines for articles that I wanna save, and wrote.  I'm really proud of myself for everything I've written.  Now I'm here. LoL. I'm no longer sore from soccer but I have practice tomorrow. Then conditioning starts again on Monday. OH! Carly told me  Hummel are really good soccer cleats  so I might get pink Hummel ones. I haven't decided yet. The people finally moved in the house across from me. I think they already lived in Wickliffe because I think I've seen the boy around school. Oh well. I'm on major TP watch tonight since Eddie is working late. Well, here's a poem. It's about how friends tell you what to do and how it always seems to back fire. This is one of my only poems that's suppose to be taken as a joke. Like, people seriously say those things but when I need them they're not there, so to me, it's funny.        You Say  You say, "Eat ice cream, it'll make you feel better."  You say, "Talk to me, that's why I'm here."  You say, "Write about it... it's what you're great at."  So I eat the ice cream, and gain ten pounds.  I try to talk to you about my sudden weight change, but you just snap and say I'm "beautiful."  There goes talking to you, so here I am, doing what I'm great at.  One bit of advice,

JUST UNDERSTAND THAT I'M IN A STATE OF AWE AT THIS MOMENT AND PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMAZED FOR A FEW DAYS... WOW...

       Ok, I'm really pissed. I had  half of my post done  and my fucking computer decided to freeze. So I lost the damn post... Well, I'm making myself sick. Not on purpose of course. It's just that  every time  I eat, I get feel so terribly sick. I get  horribly, intense stomach cramps  that make me feel like I'm gonna throw up. I have them for 10-15 minutes and then they just go away. So that's strange and doesn't make much sense. Any who. I went to bed around 4 and got up at around noon. Once again, woke up with no voice and a sore throat. Chest pains continued throughout the day.  It makes it hard to breath. Even if I'm just sitting around. So I ate breakfast (which makes me feel so awful that I've only been eating one bowl compared to the usual two or three), read my soccer mag,  I'm in search for pink soccer cleats!  Adidas doesn't have any and I prefer Adidas cleats (or anything really for that matter) so I'm kinda in a sticky situation. Fila and Hummel have some though. But I've never heard of Hummel so I'm weary on whether they'll be good. I've heard of Fila but I want pink  Adidas  cleats not pink  Fila  cleats. Then I watched some TV, went online, and decided to go get dressed and eat. I ate lunch with Eddie.  It was nice.  We were talking and somehow the conversation changed to Jessica and Ashlee Simpson. I think it was because I had my radio on really loud (in my room) which we could hear in the kitchen and Jessica's "Angels" was playing. So I asked him if he thought I looked like Jessica because Margaret always says I do. He said no. So I asked, "Am I prettier?" And he said, " Yes, a lot prettier."   It was so cute.    I went and watched TV and painted my toe nails. I watched a lot of TV the rest of the afternoon. Tonight basically did nothing. Crunches and more TV. Ate some ice cream and chocolate chips. It's not my fault, I had cravings. Oh, funny story. Anyone that was on track with me this year (the girls especially) remember that one event where I ran out of tampons and Annie had to give me a Pearl one? And how I was complaining the whole way to the high school about  how it was falling out?  It's not my fault, I've used the same kind of tampons my whole life and the Pearl ones and Tampax Compact were the only ones I'd ever tried other than my usual kind. And I screamed at all the boys,  "THESE DAMN TAMPONS SUCK!"  Well, today I decided to use a few of those Pearl ones and they're not too bad. So I take back all the hurtful things I said about them. But I still prefer my  "slender"  tampons.  Yes, I'm the girl with the tiny tampons.  LoL, Gabby was making fun of my tampons on our Columbus trip. Just because she needs four of mine to equal her one. Anyways, I'll change the subject just in case any guys are reading this. So today I was sitting in my living room. With the way my computer is, if you walk down the street and the door is open and I'm on the computer, you can see me. So today I heard some kids walking by my house and I was on the computer. So I turned to look to see if I knew them and sorry for saying this but it was  three punk kids.  Like all black, dyed hair, that kinda thing. I don't have a problem with that though so don't think I do. So I looked and realized I didn't know them but the one kid saw me looking and yelled,  "BITCH!"  I mean, come on.  That was totally uncalled for.  That little asshole. So today we didn't have soccer because we worked hard yesterday. I was happy about it. But I still like conditioning because it's getting me in shape. Sunday is the next day I have soccer. It's just practice scrimmaging so I'll see if I got any better with my ball skills. Then I have conditioning Monday-Friday again. So yay. Alrite. New story. See my brothers and his friends started this whole joke TPing their other friends houses. That led to displays of furniture in their front lawns and more TPing but all of this was a joke. Until, they found out the people who supposedly they were cool with, weren't so cool after all. So now it's this  big  war going on.  And our house is the one that's suppose to be the next to get trashed.  Little do those guys know we have our little plan of our own and plus someone is always up at all hours of the day. I'm in the living room til usually 4 where I have a clear view of the street, Eddie goes to bed at 5 or 6 and has super sonic hearing, and then my step dad is always up around 5. So they better watch out!  No one screws with McGrath's ...(wink, wink!)  And if they do, they get their asses kicked so keep that in mind.

       Here's my  wonderful  day.  (ha, yeah right...)  Went to bed around 3:30 and woke up at 1ish. For the past few days when I wake up, my throat really hurts and I have no voice. But throughout the day, it goes away. Although, for the past few days, my chest has been really tight (which hurts) and that  hasn't gone away.  I thought I might just be getting sick. But I was telling Carly about it and she told me it's probably from my asthma and all the running at soccer conditioning. So that's just dandy.  My asthma is making me sick.  Or feel like it at least. Today I finished Lord of the Flies. Personally,  I think it totally sucked.  The ending was so bad. After everything that happened in the book, it's like, " That's all? " Kristina, if you're reading this, I'll go to her house this weekend and give you the book. Now I just gotta read Tom Sawyer. I'm hoping it's better than LOTF. Then I finished my Seventeen magazine. Did some crunches, went online, ate ice cream (first time I've ate junk food in 2 weeks and 5 days so I think you know why), and just got ready for soccer. I didn't wanna go  at all.  I was seriously about to curl up in a ball and cry. I was in such pain. But I went anyways thinking the running would help. So we did our warm up mile. Also didn't walk. God, I'm getting good at this! Did our crazy sprints and line exercises, wasn't too bad. I think it was better today because I started carrying my inhaler as I ran those. I&nbsp; didn't wanna carry it during the mile because if I needed to use it, I'd have to stop and I didn't wanna stop. See? Will power! (wink, wink!) Then we did the ladder with the cones which means a  LONG  break so we were all happy! Plus, I actually like the cone ladder for your information. After that we played keep away for a little bit. I think all&nbsp;this conditioning is actually working already. See during keep away, I think I did really good. Then we did degressions. No cool down mile!! YAY! And because we worked so hard (I don't think it was a really tough day of practice though) we don't have practice tomorrow.  So I'm all smiles about that!  I came home, watered flowers, and now I'm here. I was in a bad mood before but I think I'm better!  YaY!

        Alrite, my night was better. I could actually sleep and I slept til noon-ish like a normal  "me."  I called Annie once I got up because her and I had some sort of conversation last night and we needed to continue it. So we talked for awhile but I had to get off the phone because my uncle came over and I was just sitting there in my pajamas and on the phone. He needed some glasses my bro had in his glove compartment for work so my mom gave him the keys and he went to get them. Now, he doesn't like animals at all.  Especially not dogs.  But I have two  lovely  dogs who like jumping on everyone so I had fun watching my uncle trying to get my dogs off of him. And Sandy is pretty tall when she stands on her back legs! LoL! So then he asked if he could call my grandpa and my mom said to use my use that was next to the computer, upside down. And my uncle being the  smart  one he is, asked if it was a cell phone! I was like WTF? And he tried pulling up the antena but there was none. He asked me how to turn it on but he changed his mind and went to use the normal phone in the kitchen.  Oh well.  So then I just sat online talking to people til 4. Then I read CH 11 of LOTF. One more chapter left! Fuck yeah! LoL! But then I still gotta read Tom Sawyer.  Lucky me.  Then I ate and got ready for soccer. Soccer wasn't too bad tonight. I ran the warm up mile without stopping again!  So yay to me.  Then we did the normal crap except we usually have 3 men teams but today we have 2 men&nbsp; teams. Which means you go faster and don't get much of a break.&nbsp; Later we did these crazy cone things. Coach lined the cones up on their sides like a ladder. We had to jump over them in different ways. But it was so funny because everyone kept doing the one way completely different. And Mr. Willis would like tease someone if they hit a cone and say, "Stop kicking my cones." I dunno, to me,  that seemed like the first time I felt comfortable with everyone.  I dunno why it was then, it's just what I felt. And thank god, we didn't do our cool down mile. We just did de-gessions. Which weren't bad. Came home and read Seventeen. Then I watched Newlyweds and the Ashlee Simpson show. I really like Ashlee and her show. She's really pretty. Now I'm here. I'm sorta sore from soccer so I can't wait til tomorrow. LoL, well it's not that bad. The miles are the worst and when my chest tightens up and I only get a little oxygen. And soccer is the only time that I seem to stop thinking about  *something*  So that's good because I can't stop thinking of that thing at all through the day.  Even my dreams are about it.  Any who, here's a good quote:  "When you're happy on the inside, you're beautiful on the outside."  Don't you like that? I do! And here's a poem. Hope you like. The poem is just about liking someone again and the events that go with it.  HEY! START COMMENTING! I WANNA KNOW WHAT YOU THINK!        &nbsp;     Up to You   my memory is starting to fade, as the feeling is slipping way. so where are you now? why aren't you here? i want you back, and i think you want me too. my friends say you do, but it's something i need to hear for myself. so take the next step,

         I'm am so fucking proud of myself right now.   (HUGE SMILE)  Here's my day. I was really pissed because I thought I'd have an amazing night of sleep just because of everything that happened yesterday but it was a damned restless night. I could hardly fall asleep and I kept waking up or just become really hot or uncomfortable. But I went to bed at 3:30am and got up before 11.  That has never happened before.  Well, it probably has but the point of this is I  voluntarily got up at before 11  and I don't think that has happened recently. So I ate, got ready, and just sat online because I didn't feel like doing anything else. Then I went to my Grandpa's.&nbsp;I was going crazy because I couldn't find his newspaper or his watch and he wanted them both! And I looked all over the freaking house! Everywhere! Eventually, we found the newspaper hidden between old newspapers and the watch was stuck in his bed sheets. So that was a relief. After that, Eddie, my mom, and me went to the Richmond mall. Eddie got  *CUTE*  clothes for once! I'm happy with him! And I ended up getting shorts and a tank top. I almost got this really cute black skirt but,  no surprise , my mom thought it was too short. And it wasn't even short!  But my mom didn't see me try&nbsp;what I got&nbsp;on and she always likes to see it so she knows if I look like a hoe or not.&nbsp; So when we got home, she said, "Uh, those both look a little small.  If you look like a whore with them on, you're not leaving the house! " So I tried them both on and my mom was like, "Okay!" See? I'm a good girl.  At times.  (wink!) So then I came home. Cleaned, did crunches, read Chapter 10 of LOTF!  Only two more fucking chapters and I'm done with that bitch!  But then I have Tom Sawyer...uh! So I ate and got ready for soccer. Uh, soccer. Enough said!  Well, let's just say, I'm damn proud of myself because of soccer!  We did our warm up mile, no surprise, Nicole and I were in the back! But it was so amazing, Nicole just kept saying she refused to walk and  she kept giving me the strength to keep running and not walk.  So we finished and Coach Gamire mumbled, "Under 7, good job!" to the whole team. And I'm like WTF?! "What was Nicole and my time?" "Under 7 minutes." First off, I've  never  ran a whole mile without walking. So that in itself is an accomplishment. And then, I've  never  ran a mile in 6 minutes and how ever many seconds!  And now I did!   I was soo happy about that!  But later we did some crazy ass sprints and I had the worst asthma attack  I've ever had.  I was just wheezing so much and my breathing was so heavy and my chest was soo tight. I thought I was gonna pass out. But I kept going and I finished. And for the cool down mile, I didn't walk any. Wow! And even if Nicole and I came in last, we gave it our best, we didn't walk, and we finished. I say that's good enough. And if someone disagrees,  FUCK YOU!  I'm getting good. And it's only the second&nbsp;day of practice.  I better be hot by the end of this season  with all the hard work I'm putting in. But I'm gonna hurt like a mother fucker tomorrow. Today I was hardly sore. But we did double the amount of lundges and even more running and I'm already hurting so I can't wait til tomorrow! I came home and just like fell on my bed.  It's never&nbsp;felt that good before. &nbsp;And then I watched America's Next Top Model. I was totally surprised the one girl won. I wanted her to win but the other girl she was against was like Miss All American. But I'm glad she didn't. And now I'm here.

       See, I never really liked that saying because I mean then you're always expecting the unexpected so the unexpected turns into the expected. Did that make sense to anyone? But that saying does come true.&nbsp;  The unexpected always seems to happen.  And I've learned that those  unexpected things are one of the best things out there.  I've also learned that pain eventually fades and happiness and love will find you  again.  And maybe second chances really are the greatest kind of chance.&nbsp;It gives you a chance to relive what you once had. And it's at the times when you're ready to let go of all this shit that something happens and *they* pull you up and made you hold on even tighter...

       So,  wow , here's my day. Woke up, got ready, went to the store. Came home, talked to Alecia, read Chapter 9 of LOTF, talked to Annie.&nbsp;Chris was having a surprise party for Ree since it was her birthday today. So after soccer I was planning on going to the party. Before soccer I must have had some panic or anxiety attack because I was shaking really bad and my heart was beating really fast. I guess I was worried about conditioning. It wasn't too bad. Which surprised me. The only thing I really had a problem with was the first warm up mile we did. I was started wheezing and I couldn't handle anymore so with one lap to go, I had to quit and go get my inhaler. I don't like using my asthma  as an excuse . I feel like I should be able to finish that mile. But the cool down one we did, I did pretty good. I came home and got ready for the party.  That was a disaster in it's self.  My hair wouldn't do anything and I just kept throwing everything. And my room is  ALWAYS  clean so it was a mess after I finished. But I got to the party and well, I don't wanna go into too many details but parts were bad (pretty much everyone was drinking and a lot of people were smoking) but some parts were really good! Like seeing Alecia! God, I missed her! I hadn't seen like any of my friends since the festival which was a month ago! Everyone was like, "OMG! I haven't seen you in forever!" Even the guys.  So yeah, uh, I'm going to bed one happy girl.  Sweet dreams!

       why can't you see everything is pointing to  me ? oh, maybe it's because  she's  blocking your vision...    &nbsp;  what's preventing you from feeling the things i've felt for all these  years ?    &nbsp;  sometimes i have to hold myself back from running into your arms... because you're not mine to hold...       &nbsp;  what does  she  have that  i   lack ?    &nbsp;  did you ever,  just once , have feelings for me?    &nbsp;  is there anything i can do to  change your mind ?    &nbsp;  did you know you're the  only  reason i quit? and that you're the  only  person stopping me from doing it any further?    &nbsp;  why does everyone else get their chances but i don't?    &nbsp;  did i  EVER  have a chance?    &nbsp;  how can i make you  love me ?

        I should have counted all the times I almost cried today.  It was a lot!  Uh...let's get with the  *great*  details.  Oh joy.  I woke up at like 11 something to go to my grandpa's. Ate, (only one bowl of cereal! Usually, it's two or three...What? I'm a hungry girl!), got ready, and left. First, I was in pants and my mom made me change into shorts because she said I'd be hot. Then, as we about to leave, my step dad was like, "I'm gonna need your help in the garden today..." I was pissed! I was not in any mood to work  in the garden I planted.  (about 100 tomato plants and like 25 pepper plants...) I wanted to just read and relax there today! So I had to go and change into crappy clothes really quick and change my shoes. We had to take two cars because both my mom and brother had work afterwards so Eddie needed his car. So I went with Eddie in his car and my mom, step dad, and pups went in the other car. So we went to the Mini Mart, got a newspaper (for my grandpa of course), and got on the freeway.&nbsp;I guess the part we usually take to my grandpa's house was being worked on because there was a detour. Eddie didn't wanna follow it so we turned around, went back to Wick, and took 84 there.&nbsp;When we got there, my mom was like,  "OMG! Where were you?!&nbsp;I was soo worried!"  It was funny. So I went to slave in the garden while Dave (my step dad) tried making Eddie help but Eddie refused because he had work right after and because the damn tomato ties kept ripping. We were tying the tomato plants by the way. He went inside and fell asleep on the couch. At the beginning, Dave tried showing me how to tie a tomato to a stake so I was like, "I already know how to...I've done this before." I mean, come on, I'm the girl who grew up around this garden. But Dave flipped and started yelling at me. First instant where I wanted to cry today. Whenever he yells at me, I always wanna cry. He just has the ability  of breaking a person down.  But later he said sorry for that and the only reason he flipped was because he just wanted one chance to explain something.&nbsp;I miss my real dad...  But I always do.  No one could ever replace him. But anyways, later, he's like, "Want some of my pop?" "HELLO! I DON'T DRINK POP!" Really starting to annoy me that my parents don't know that. So, when I was done in the garden, my arms were soo dirty.&nbsp;It looked like they were covered in blood, so some thoughts ran through my head, but I washed 'em and I wasn't bleeding.  I think I murdered some tomato plants but that's what they get!  But I did get three mosquito bites around my right knee. And I kept itching 'em and Dave was like, "STOP!" I hate when people tell me to stop itching bites or something. It's not your body so back off! So I left and went home. Cleaned, did crunches, read, talked to Alecia, Margaret,&nbsp;and Sheryl, and ate. I felt pretty sick afterwards. But that seems to happen a lot.&nbsp;Got ready for soccer and left. Uh, soccer was just a mess today. I was horrible. Felt like crying  a lot  during soccer. I was seriously horrible. I missed easy shots and everything. Uh... Well, everyone has bad days...&nbsp;Let's not talk about that anymore! Margaret was suppose to be there @ 8 to pick me but as usual she forgot...well, actually she fell asleep so that pissed me off even more. Came home, complained to Eddie about Margaret, watered neighbors flowers, (the ones in the front are dying or something... they look bad!  but the ones in the back are really good), Kevin came over, did Mark. with Margaret, (spending money&nbsp;always cheers me up or something), had more drama with Dave (the guy thinks he's dying as soon as he gets low blood sugar...he's a diabetic n a drama queen), Eddie went out with friends, and I finished reading Chapter 8 of LOTF. Only four more fucking chapters...  Now I'm here. Wow. What a life.

       It seems like everything is turning upside down for other people...friend problems, drinking problems, relationship probs... Not to sound bitchy, but for once, everyone else has problems and I'm okay.  Most of the time, I'm the one with the issues.  It's kind of nice to have the roles reversed. I have a goal for myself. I have to read one&nbsp;chapter of Lord of the Flies each day. So I should finish Thursday but if that fails, my&nbsp;other goal is by Saturday. Then I get to spend  the rest of my summer reading  Tom Sawyer. Oh joy! Gosh,  school is coming up so quick.  It's almost August. Isn't it all crazy? In ways, I'm super excited for high school. In others, I'm super frightened. Everyone is gonna change and I'm worried it's gonna be  for the worst.  I'm concerned people will make the  wrong choices  and bad shit will happen...  I worry too much...  Oh and you wanna know something? I think it's funny how I always give people such amazing advice and then when it comes to me, myself, needing advice,  I don't even take my own advice.  How screwed up is that? Well, I already know I'm one crazy chick. New topic... I got the Ashlee Simpson CD. It's cool. I like her. Sorry to you people out there who think she sucks and she's only famous because of Jessica. You're entitled to your opinion and I'm entitled to the same thing. Well, it's 12:25 am and I need to shower and shave and finish reading Chapter 7 of LOTF and do Mark. orders....  Exciting how I spend my nights huh?  Well Annie called me tonight and we were talking about stuff. Then she asked, "Why didn't you go to Chris'?" me: "I was reading..." I have no life! Well, sweet dreams! I hope everyone's problems turn out okay! And as usual, I'm here for advice, someone to vent on, or just someone to listen! Happy Birthday's go out to Kevin Dowd and May Vigil!

         July 23, 2004 ...Woke up, ate, got ready for sitting around the house, all those sorts of things. But I cleaned  a lot.  I was in some sort of cleaning mode.   Read a good amount of Lord of the Flies, which I am now about half way through. Annie called me around 8 and asked if I wanted to sleep over so I got ready and went over there. Her cousin, Teri, was there. She's cool. So we all just hung out and talked. Teri's really funny. She has some pretty out there stories. We were talking about Hooters&nbsp; and how someone's mom works there and Annie says, "Now when the boy is asked what his mom does, he gets to say, '  MY MOM WORKS AT HOOTERS!  ' Isn't that funny?" Yes, it was funny. Annie made fun of me because I need to wash my face and all that *exciting stuff* morning&nbsp; AND  night&nbsp;because unlike her, I break out. And then she was making fun of me because  I was too short  to turn off her light. (from the fan...I hope you know what I'm referring to...) So blah, blah, blah.  July 24, 2004 ...Then I came home today. Didn't do much. Cleaned, watered flowers, did some crunches, and now here I am blogging. Then I'm going to do more crunches and read Lord of the Flies. Hopefully I'll work out some afterwards...OH! Guess what?  I've gone two weeks without junk food!  GO ME! If ya'll (LoL, my mom said that the other day) didn't know, I'm on a diet. Don't freak out. Not starvation diet. More of only eating three healthy meals a day and healthy snacks. I already don't drink pop so that's good too. Well, here's a poem. I've been kind of neglecting to put one in here for awhile so here ya go! Enjoy...      &nbsp;    We  Were...   &nbsp;  We  were  prefect together,  Why'd you have to go and ruin such a great thing?   We  were  in love,  How could you break my heart?   We  were  so close,  Where'd you get the guts to tear us apart?   We  were  so happy,  When did you decide to make me cry?   We  were  always together,  Who am I suppose to be with now?   We  were  suppose to last,  What were you thinking?   We  were  meant for each other,  So now, how do you live with yourself at night?

       I have  soo  much to write about so I should get started now. Sorry I didn't write last night. I came home&nbsp;at 1:30ish (yes, in the morning) and I was just way  too tired  to take the time and post. So let me start off with yesterday. I woke up @ 8 am once again but yesterday I had such a hard time getting up. I had @ least 5 and a half hours of sleep which was more than&nbsp;Monday night. But got up, ate breakfast, got ready, went to Kevin's, and then went to my grandpa's. My grandpa seemed better yesterday than Tuesday so that's good. I'm still worried but I mean when haven't I been worried about him? I kinda fell asleep on my grandpa's couch watching the news for an hour or so. But I woke up just in time to watch the  WHOLE hour  of the Price is Right... Ironic huh? Then I went outside and hung with my grandpa. Eddie and Kevin told me how my uncle was busy  re -priming what they already primed... Does that make sense to any of you? Yeah, it didn't make much sense to me. My grandpa needed new stakes for the tomato plants in the garden so Eddie, my mom, and Kevin took my baby (my grandpa's car that will be mine) to Home Depot or wherever to get 'em and I just read my magazine and talked with my grandpa while they were gone. When they came back, it was so funny. My uncle was being so stupid. He couldn't even get the stakes out of the trunk! Hello, wasn't rocket science!&nbsp;If you can't tell, I don't like him very much. And I have plenty of reasons but those are more personal and family related than I'd like to share. So then my uncle ordered pizza. Is it bad that I had McDonald's on&nbsp;Tuesday and pizza on Wednesday?  And does pizza count as fast food?  I had three pieces. Eddie had like  6  and Kevin had  8  I think. A little after that we left. We got there at like 9 am and stayed til 3 pm so don't think I was only there for an hour! I love my grandpa more than that!! Then we had to drop off Kevin and&nbsp;go to the store. It was crazy. I looked terrible because I fell asleep on the couch and Eddie was covered in paint. And his shirt was ripped so people were probably wondering about us. I finally got home @ 4ish. It was the first time I was home all day. But I had to clean, do crunches, water flowers, get ready for soccer, get ready for going out afterwards... So at around 6:30, I left for soccer. Yesterday at soccer I just felt so moody. Like I was getting mad at Nicole for not even trying while passing the ball. I mean it was fucking passing not something difficult. And then we did our usual drills for Wednesday practices. I was proud of myself for that time because they weren't as hard (breathing wise) as the other times. But then we began to scrimmage. I was actually picked before Nicole for once and even before a bunch of boys!! I felt good about that. But then there's the little voice in my head.  It keeps telling me, "Why are you trying? You're not even good. Look at how much the other boys beat you. It was your fault they scored... You're never gonna be on Varsity and the only reason you even have a shot @ JV is because the freshman team was cut..."  So soccer wasn't that great. And then we found out instead of one week of soccer conditioning, we'd have  two!  That really worried me. Because I started thinking, "What happens if I'm&nbsp;really&nbsp;terrible?" I have bad asthma so I can't run as much as other people but I hate to use asthma for my excuse. I hate to be the only one who has to stop because they can't breath.  I wanna prove myself soo bad  but I'm afraid I'm gonna do so terrible that everyone thinks less of me. I knew we ran a mile for a warm up but then I figured we did drills just like on Wednesday's. Little did I know&nbsp;that there's &nbsp;a state law preventing us from using any equipment (soccer balls included) during conditioning... So that means however long practice is, that's how long we RUN! Just run...no ball drills or scrimmaging or anything. Now I'm so worried. Today I told my step dad how all we do is run for those two weeks and he says, "If I was you, I'd qu... Never mind I'm not gonna say it." So I say, "If you were me, you'd quit. I'm not dumb, I hear you." He says, "Well, it's up to you..."  Like he expects me to quit!  After practice, my sis came and picked me up and took me out to Mentor to see my cousin who's up from Columbus. Eddie was already did because he had to install some neons in his car. I was hoping my dad would be there but he wasn't. So I just hung out there with my three cousins and uncle and bro til 1ish am. I love that family so much. They are soo close and open and everything. I also discovered my brother drinks.&nbsp;I was talking to my cousin Matt about it and he's like, "Lauren, come on! He's 17, what do you expect?" Eddie did a sweet job installing the neons and I actually stayed awake the whole time. I was falling asleep at like 10 but my uncle came and talked to me. It was cool because he asked me if I knew what I wanted to do for a career and I told him a writer and psychologist and he's like, "Wow. Yeah. I can totally see that fitting you." And I was just like, "Wow." But guess what my step dad said to me the other day? We were talking about college and all this and I was explaining how Columbia is like the top psychology school in the US and he's like, "You? A psychologist? HA!" And he started laughing. "I always thought you wanted to be a lawyer or doctor or nurse  or something more important. " I was just crushed. The fucking guy has been in my life since I was 6! And I've been writing my whole life! My uncle who didn't even knew I wrote thought that'd be a good choice for me. But my step dad didn't realize that even after all the times I've been published. sigh. So I came home, ate, showered, and went straight to bed. Finally, I got to sleep in. But I had the craziest dream. Some guys were over my house and I was the only girl. I was in my room when one of them came in and  started making out with me  but I sorta pushed him away for some reason. I think it was because he was this girls ex and I was good friends with the girl. Then I went into the kitchen and "Eric" (I remembered his name!) was making Mac&nbsp;& Cheese (he was like 17) &nbsp;and I was explaining what just happened with "Jon" (I think that was his name or Jason) and he's like, "It's just the way he is." Then I went into my brothers room where all the other guys were and Jon/Jason like came and pushed me up against the bed and tried making out with me again. Then suddenly I was in a pool and learning how to do back handsprings  in the water.  It was crazy because first they made you do some on the ground and then they taught you in the water. Tracy K and Annie were in the dream and they didn't even do anything close to a back handspring but the two teachers were like, "AMAZING!" So I go to do mine and the lady teacher is like, "Oh wow, Lauren! I never thought you'd really try this!" And I'm like, "Well,&nbsp; I did gymnastics when I was younger but then I started soccer so I quit." And she just nodded. There was some thing you had to stand up on and then it went towards the water and you were suppose to do a round off off it but I just fell and did some crazy shit and the guy teacher was like, "Well..." And then I woke up. I read some of Lord of the Flies today, I'm a little weary to admit it  but I think I sorta like it.  I wanna finish it by August 1st and then concentrate on Tom Sawyer all August. Uh, I'm being craving brownies and ice cream soo much lately. But I can't pig out til I get my period. And it's pissing me off because I should have gotten it already. No, I'm  not  pregnant for you crazy people out there. Oh and guess what Margaret is up to lately? Well, today she was an hour late to work where she was suppose to open the store at 10 (she works at the mall) but she didn't open it/get there til 11. So the district manager was called but they couldn't get a hold of her right away so they called the  VICE PRESIDENT  of the store and now the manager has to talk to M on Monday. And if she gets fired, let's just say a lot of bad shit is gonna go down. May I add that she was only late because she didn't get up? And that's why she was late all the other times she was. Oh and she's pretty&nbsp; much  cheating  on her boyfriend. It's hard to explain. Like she hasn't done anything with this other guy but they also  haven't even met!  She talked to the guy online and on the phone (for like&nbsp;3 hours the other night...) (he's lives in Canada by the way) and I'm just worried for her other boyfriend because the last time this happened, a lot of shit happened (me included) and I'm not sure if I'm physically up for any games again...

         It's 1:30 am and here I am bawling my eyes out.  It's pretty much a dominos effect.  One domino falls and the rest of them just seem to follow.  I was in a pretty good mood. But then I  "fell"  again. I knew I shouldn't have listened, I knew I wasn't good enough,  but part of me wanted to believe that someone actually wanted me.  Then I got upset because I want a boyfriend so bad.  I just want someone to love me  and&nbsp;be there for me and give me advice and let me cry on their shoulder as they kiss my head and tell me everything will be okay. I want someone to tell me I'm&nbsp;beautiful even though I sure as hell don't feel like it. I always listen to everyone talking about boyfriends and guys they like and how the guys like 'em back and here I am,&nbsp;lonely, as usual. Like I don't&nbsp;understand why&nbsp;guys don't like me. If you're a&nbsp;guy and reading this,&nbsp;please&nbsp;leave a comment on why you or other&nbsp;guys don't like me. Thanks. But&nbsp;it's not like any guys read this anyways.  Like what do I lack that all those other girls have? &nbsp;Why can't you&nbsp;just give me  ONE  fucking chance?&nbsp;There's a lot more to me&nbsp;than&nbsp;what you see. I only like being alone and I'm horribly impatient. And what's the point in being positive when no one's gonna&nbsp;pop&nbsp;up and fall in love me with?&nbsp;Anyways, anyone&nbsp;who falls for me&nbsp;hurts me... Life is&nbsp;just such&nbsp;bull shit.&nbsp;Why are people hurt so much? I've been so confused lately...&nbsp;&nbsp;And then someone started talking about Homecoming. Uh... I probly won't even end up going. No one's gonna ask me. And there's no way in hell I'm gonna ask someone  because there are only two possible outcomes.  (one) they'd say no and I'd be really embarrassed and depressed (two) they'd say yes out of pity. I can't go to the dance by myself either because I'd just break down anyways and ruin all my make up crying. And I mean it's not like I'd look pretty or anything. Then the next thing in line to fall was something with one of my "friends." I think they are keeping something big from me.&nbsp;I sense it. And if they really are then great. It's just what I need. There's only one way I can think to solve this all but half of me knows better than that and the other half  just wants to make one person happy...     And here I am, a half hour later, still bawling...isn't this nice? Leave a comment please...

       Ok, something kinda big happened earlier today and it bought back memories and feelings  and I think I like it.  I don't know if it is true or if I'm just setting myself up to fall down  again.  But there is one  big  reason to say no. Although, it's not seeming to bother others. I'm sorry, I wish I could explain in detail but then&nbsp;things would get&nbsp;pretty screwed up. So today I decided to clean out my closet and get rid of all the stuff that I didn't want anymore or didn't wear anymore or didn't fit in anymore. Everything was going pretty well... until the end , that is. I went to go try on this awesome skirt I have and I had the hardest fucking time getting it over my legs. The thing that upset me most about that was  because it fit me two months ago.  So within two months my legs got bigger. I know it's not fat and that it's muscle from soccer and running but it really frustrates me because I have the hardest fucking time looking for clothes with the way my body is. Ah... And I'll upset and worried because my grandpa isn't doing too well. So all of my family is just really cautious and scared for what&nbsp;could happen next.  Oh god please don't...I don't know if I could handle losing him... I'm just in a bad state and I'm too worked up to even add a poem...sorry guys...

        *somehow I messed up the original color so the normal color is this post is white! my bad...*       &nbsp;     Surprising I went to bed early last nite.  At 3 am.  That's early for me. I got up at 8 am to get ready and go to my Grandpa's with my mom, Eddie, his friend, (their painting my grandpa's house) and my dogs. So as we were leaving I was going to get into my brother's car and I ran into the corner end and cut open my leg. It hurt  really  bad! Today just a   blonde   day for me. Pretty much everything I said and did was blonde. Once we got to my grandpa's, we stayed hung out with him and made him breakfast. Then Eddie and Kevin went to get McDonald's for all of us. I'm kinda disappointed in myself because I know I shouldn't be eating fast food. Last Saturday I had fast food and then today. That's too much for me. But I got chicken nuggets and fries so they aren't that bad rite? After they came back from Mickey D's, my mom and I went to Richmond Mall. My grandpa lives right next to it. So we went into JC Penny's (it was the entrance) and my mom bought two purses she liked. I was glad to see her getting herself something because she is always so busy with the rest of the family that she puts herself last a lot. So then I went to the Juniors department and was looking at shirts. I found this yellow one I really liked but my mom didn't like it so I didn't get it. That was the only shirt I really liked there. Next, I was looking at jeans. I always have such big problems finding jeans so I was scared I'd end up crying. I tried on like 20 pairs...I could only get three all the way on. And I ended up getting two of them. One are regular jeans.    My mom told me they make my butt look really cute so I'm super excited for them!    They are really cute, they have neon pink and neon green trim...aww!    jeans...you hate to love 'em but you love to hate 'em!   Then I got sweatpants which are really comfy. They are black with white stripes. After that I went to Old Navy. They had a bunch of comfy clothes but I ended up getting: two skirts, (one is all black camo and the other is like fringy jean) a pair of tan cord shorts, two tank tops, (a white and a black one) and a white t-shirt. Sorry, I just felt like sharing. Then I came home and went to Tina's a little to see Bella, her birdy. Well, I'm gonna go, more later! muah~

       WoW! It has been one  lllooonnnggg  day. First of all I went to bed @ 4 am and had to get up @ 8:30 to go do some crap. When I first got up my jaw was locked, which happens a lot when I get up so I just thought it'd go away after a few minutes. But I went to go eat breakfast and it wouldn't move. Everyone knows I have a  huge  mouth and that I can stick my fist in it. But this morning I could hardly stick a spoon in there! And I had a huge bowl of some cinnamon things that I really liked. So I was pissed that I couldn't stick the fucking spoon in my mouth. I was on the verge of&nbsp; tears, seriously. And then Margaret was pissing me off. So I was doing the best I could of yelling at her for being a bitch.&nbsp;Then she was making fun of my for the way I was talking...ah, stress.&nbsp;So I had to go get my new inhaler (the one I have is a tester but this is a  *true*  inhaler now so wow! go me!) and I found out my doctor changed my prescription from 2 puffs 20 minutes before exercise to 2 puffs 2 times a day. Which is screwed up because I only need it for sports! Then I bunched into my mom's friendly and very pregnant friend who's a teacher and she's like, "Is this the writer?" Referring to me, which was weird because I'd never think my mom to tell people I write. Then I came home @ around 11 and watched the  Price Is Right  for the first time this summer! That show kicks some serious ass! And the one guy played Plinko! I love that game! But I kept falling asleep during commercials so I turned off the TV and switched positions. I had my head at the foot of the bed and I wanted to lay under my covers. But I forgot I had taken my glasses off and placed them on the bed so when I went to go under the covers, you hear my glasses go hit the wall and fall some place. So it took me like 3 minutes to hide them and in the end, I had to crawl under my damn bad.  So then I took a nap til 2 pm.  That was nice. OMG! I have to tell you about my crazy ass dream! So I was at my cousin's house. My cousin Chris was there and the other kid was suppose to be my cousin Tim but he didn't look like him and he called himself Dan. Dan was trying to lock me in some stone cave with stone bleachers but I wouldn't let him because I have a fear of small spaces. Then he was trying to get me to eat some soup crap  with eye balls.  I took a big bite and ended up spitting it out. I spit one of the eye balls like 20 feet across the room into a mug. Next, Chris gave me a purring seal,   yes, a purring seal,   on a leash to hold and it was soo cute. And he added, "You'll&nbsp;have so much fun babysitting tomorrow." I was like, WHOA! WTF?&nbsp;Suddenly, I was at some amusement park. I was on some ride with Maura, my mom, and a bunch of other people. We were about to go up the big hill to go down at like a 90 degree angle when I realized I  wasn't  buckled in so I freaked out and jumped out of my seat. At this point Maura started screaming her head off because she was sitting next to me. But little did I know the ride was so close to the ground. So as the ride went up the hill,  I was nearly killed by feet!  That's how close it was to the ground. Then I was in a car with my cousin going to his house to babysit the little seal.&nbsp;So I get out of the car and I'm in my sister's awesome black pants with my huge red Gap shirt and my Sesame Street socks!  I didn't even have shoes on!  So I get in the house and it's all crazy. My cousin Matt looked just like my friend Chris and he was making breakfast for his girlfriend and a bunch of her friends. Then my Aunt Sue was like HUGE! And she kept giving me hugs which is strange because she pretty much hates me. And there was a garage in the back of the house with no door separating the rooms. And my dad was in there working on a car. And then my mom was there and they saw each other and were like, yeah? Then the dream ended. Oh! I'm getting my  own  celly finally. I had to kinda give mine up to Eddie when he could drive and he nevers lets me use it other than soccer so yeah. I'm excited. So later Eddie asked me if I wanted to go to some stores to look for his lights that he wanted for his cars. I agreed and we went. None of the stores had them so he was bummed. Then I was talking about Dairy Queen and he's like, "Wanna go get some ice cream?" "Uh, I've been trying to cut down on all that..." "Party pooper!" So we ended up going to Dunkin Donuts for some fruit smoothies, which were really good. I got a strawberry banana one and he got peach.  It was really nice of him to hang out with me.  Earlier, he was like talking to me about one of his friends and I thought it was really cool how he was telling me stuff. We've been getting along really good lately and I'm super happy about that. Then I got a letter from Gretchen today and that always cheers me up! But it's really weird b/c I check my bro's blog every day to see if he updates it and I read everything. It's like I know a new side of him. And he wrote about me in his post&nbsp;tonight. He said said he's been trying to hang out with me more because I've been fighting with my friends and he talked about the smoothies. I don't know, it's just strange for him to be acting like this now. He never cared before like to hang out with me before. But I'm glad he did...Ah, tears are forming... Sorry, you guys will have to wait for a poem til tomorrow...

       I'm really bored. I have nothing to put in here really. I was just so bored I decided to at least make a post so you  hooked readers  out there wouldn't freak out if I didn't post one today. I got up at 2 PM today, yes,   2 PM   because&nbsp;I went to bed around 4 AM. And I didn't have to go to my Grandpa's today (I'm going Tuesday) so I could sleep in.&nbsp;Then I just cleaned and watched the Bug Juice marathon on Disney til it was time for soccer. It was really weird, I hardly ever watch Disney. All I watch is MTV except on Tuesdays for America's Next Top Model. That show is  really  good! And it made me really miss camp and all of my friends there. I won't see them til next summer. And it sucks because I live so far from them when&nbsp;a bunch of them all live in Boardman and one lives in PA by this one girl's dad so they can see each other. Then&nbsp;I went to soccer. It was fun, as usual. I mean it's one of my  "escapes,"  it better be fun. But while we were scrimmaging I was cheering because John had the ball and you knew he was gonna score, and Dave was like,&nbsp;"Why are you screaming?" He was on the other team so I don't know if that's why he asked me or what. But I didn't wanna say I was cheering so I just mumbled, "I have a tendency to scream like that..." It's so hard going from captain of the middle school team to some freshman nothing. At the beginning I was scared to even talk! I never called the ball or said good job or anything.  And you all know how outgoing I am.  That's how  intimidated  I was. I'm coming out of my shell now but I'm still in there a little. It's just I don't wanna say the wrong thing because I don't want the rest of the team to think badly of me. I guess I'm just out there to prove myself. But people frustrate me on the team sometimes. Like some people think they're the best at the game and others get big headed. But it's part of the game. I hope I do well this season. I hope I get to play a lot. I didn't play much in 8th grade because Sobul made me C team captain because "I'm good with the kids." Well, damn me. But today at practice I got hit in the face with the ball from like a foot away. I really don't know what happened. It didn't hurt, my contact just got screwed it and it was hard to see. But it's good to know that Nicole, Carly, and I are all getting along good. We're " the " girls who play with the  big boys.  And we wouldn't want it any other way!! It's good to be a girl sometimes. But for the record, John Gulden is   NOT   hot! Sorry Car!

       Okay, so tonight my step dad wanted to bond with me. How funny. Serious. I don't really like talking to my parents about anything because they always miss the point. Even when I try to explain how I feel, they don't understand so I try to steer clear of personal conversations with them. So we went out to eat at some bar and grill place. I got this thing that was pretty much the same as a Roman burger and fries with pink lemonade. I was soo full! I felt like a pig. I couldn't even finish. The sandwich was so freaking  HUGE!  Oh that reminds me. Every time I go to the store my mom asks me what kind of pop I want.  I DON'T DRINK POP MOM!  Geez, I've been like this for a year and a half and she still hasn't caught on. So back to tonight, we were on our way to Blockbuster when we realized neither of us had a Blockbuster card so we had to go to Bob Evans to get Eddie's. Cuz he works there.&nbsp;So we went to Blockbuster and we rented the Secret Window. I thought it was gonna be super scary but it was only a tad bit errie. But the ending didn't make sense. It was so out&nbsp;there. Oh well. I expected more from Johnny Dep. Like I said before, here's a poem.  &nbsp;  This poem is a little out there. Don't ask me why I wrote it, I was just bored one day. But I love it! It's not really about drugs and drinking. It's about being in love with&nbsp;someone so much that it feels like you're drunk or high. And the preview&nbsp;part&nbsp;means like getting the chance to show the person that you'd make a good&nbsp;couple and they'd come back to&nbsp;you and realize&nbsp;they love&nbsp;you too.  &nbsp;     Thrill  &nbsp;  It felt like I overdosed,  Was my vision just blurry or did I really see ghosts?  I was so high, it was difficult to think,  &nbsp;Let’s not get started on everything I had to drink…  &nbsp;  You were my addiction,  These drugs make the world seem like fiction.  Hours passed in a daze,  My brain was clouded like a haze.  &nbsp;  Did you slip me some sort of pill?  &nbsp;Just to get with me? Baby, I’m one hell of a thrill!  I’ll give you a preview and you’ll come back, begging for more…     Because as you know, I’m to die for…

       Okay, if someone can solve this problem of mine&nbsp;I'd be really grateful. My hair is naturally really curly.&nbsp;But when it comes time for me to curl my hair, I have to wet it and let it air dry. If I try and use a curler my hair goes flat in less than an hour. How does that make sense? Especially when my hair  IS  curly... Crazy world!

       Last nite I ended up going to bed around 3ish. Guess when I woke up? At like 6:30! And I laid in bed til 7 something and eventually fell asleep again which was good. So at 8 I wake up and realize it's raining pretty good. Once I ate breakfast, I went to straighten my hair. The only I straightened it was because I was bored and I knew it was just gonna curl right back when I went to out. (because of the rain since my hair is naturally curly) But my hair was all, I don't know, greasy perhaps is the word? Like it didn't make any sense! I took a shower and put in my shine stuff that I've been using for a few weeks so it's just strange that it got nasty this morning. So blah, blah, blah. I go to wake up Eddie because he was going to my Grandpa's with his friend to prime and re-paint his whole house (outside) but Eddie was like, "It's raining, I can't paint if it's raining." And I felt bad because I know how much sleep he's been missing out on while painting my Grandpa's house but I was like, "Eddie, you still have to get up, you have to take me to City Hall." And he was whining, "But I don't wanna!" He still did though!  Aww, isn't he so cute?!  LoL! So I get to City Hall and a few people are there. The reason I had to go was because the Board of Education wanted the fall activities to pass out booklets on the Levy in August to all the houses in Wickliffe. So I was paired with Matt, Nicole, and this Devin kid. We were the first to leave and it only took us a half hour to do a whole street. But Nicole and I went back and did one more street. It's wasn't&nbsp;long so that was good.&nbsp;I was so wet when I came home. Like my pants from being attacked by flowers and bushes. And I was sweating so much! It was funny. I think I burned a good amount of calories because I was starving once I came home. LoL, and it seemed like I always got the crazy part of the street. The first street, like my drive ways were like 50 yards long! Then the next street, it seemed like all the houses had dogs.  Evil dogs.  At this one house the dogs were like ready to break the door down and eat me! So when I came home I ate, read some of my magazine that I've been ignoring because I've actually been reading Lord of the Flies, and then I went online to check my email. Since no one was on, I just signed off, and went to go see what was good on TV. Go figure, nothing was good. So I laid in bed and tried to read my magazine. I read like one page and then I decided to go back to sleep. Which is really weird for me because I never take naps. So I fell asleep with my cat for almost 2 hours. Now that I'm up, I still feel a little tired. Oh well. My eyes hurt pretty bad too because I was too lazy to take out my contacts before I went to sleep. But now I took 'em out. I just need to go get my glasses. It's weird, I need my glasses or contacts for everything really but when I wear my glasses and I'm on the computer it's makes it harder for me to see. Maybe because I'm near sighted and my glasses make the print bigger and it bugs me. Oh well, just felt like sharing my strange experiences.   I'm a dork!   I'll post a poem later or something like that.

       Okay, so it's 1:30 am right now. And I'm not even tired. Which isn't really good.&nbsp;See I have be at City Hall (well behind City Hall) by 10 am for soccer crap so I'm getting up around 8. And knowing me I won't fall asleep til like 4 am. Ahh, I can't wait til I go back to school. Gosh, that should be fun changing my sleeping habits completely.  I'm gonna die.  I go to bed @ like 4 every night and for school I'm getting up around 5:30 so that's a big leap. God knows when I'll actually fall asleep for school. But I can function pretty well without sleep. And make up can always make a person look like they got a full ten hours of sleep.  :)  But I always thought it was funny how studies say most kids who get less than like nine hours a sleep a night do worst in school. I get like&nbsp;six hours during school,&nbsp;seven if I'm lucky. And I'm an almost straight A student. Oh well. I guess I'm   *special.*   Hey, my mom was calling me special today. Well, my PMS and cramps have subsided. For now at least. But OMG!  I want Double Fudge Brownie ice cream SOO BAD! &nbsp;I was just talking to Gretchen about stuff and she said the coolest thing. "wrinkles will be ironed out soon." Ha Ha! I love ya hunni! Well, I'm off to do whatever and maybe fall asleep...night, night!

       Ok, I  pray  it's that time of the month. Why? Because this morning I was just soo emotional!&nbsp;I was at the store with my mom and brother and I was like ready to burst into tears. I mean I had reasons why I&nbsp;felt that way but&nbsp;they were all just so...out there. And now I have terrible cramps. But another reason I hope it is  that , so I can eat junk food again! Yeah, I'm on a diet. I can only eat junk food on holidays and when I have my period. And I'm sure as hell craving from Double Fudge Brownie ice cream... Ahh, it's good to&nbsp;be a woman sometimes... LoL! Just felt like sharing!

       Hey! OMG! Funny thing just happened. So I just hopped out of the shower and I went into the kitchen to get some orange juice. As I looked in the fridge, I saw we have this corn beef sandwich meat, so I took a piece. I was still chewing as I went into my brother's room to get headphones. Eddie was like, "What are you eating?"&nbsp;I just smiled and said, "Nothing."&nbsp;Eddie: "It better&nbsp;not be my chicken nuggets!" I stick my tongue out so he can see it's not. "No, it's the roast beef stuff." At the time, I forgot it was corn beef. "See it's not&nbsp;white meat, it's&nbsp; RED &nbsp;meat!"&nbsp;Ya know&nbsp;b/c the nuggets at Mickey D's&nbsp;are made with all white meat. Well, after I said that I realized something. The corn beef was BEEF not RED MEAT! And I felt like the biggest idiot...oh well! That's me! Then&nbsp;earlier I got this email with dirty and clean jokes. And this one is REALLY funny!&nbsp;   &nbsp;     Dad has two!      &nbsp;   One day, the teacher was teaching a health class on sex education. He pulled down a chart of the male anatomy and asked if anyone knows what this is? Little Johnny raised his hand excitedly and blurted proudly, "I don't know its&nbsp;name but my dad has two of them." The professor said, "Johnny, you must be mistaken, your daddy doesn't have two." Johnny insisted, "Yes he does. He has a little one he uses to pee with, and a big one that mom uses to brush her teeth!"     &nbsp;   check out  urlLink http://www.aarons-jokes.com/ &nbsp;for more jokes!

      About my post earlier. I was just so frustrated because my parents have been fighting  a lot  lately. And I don't do well with that kinda drama. So it upset me pretty bad. Now with my "friends" pretty much avoiding me, all I do is sit at home. Sunday's and Wednesday's are pretty much the only days I go out and that's only for soccer. I have no life. No one calls me. Not even to talk. It makes me miserable but I'm also cool with it. I finally have a break from all the things that were holding me back from my passion before. Writing. I hardly wrote when I was always out and it made me a hell of a lot crazier than I am now. Because now I can get my feelings out by writing a poem and before I had to cut myself... And that didn't even help too much.  I was just crazy enough to think it did.  It's a bitter sweet kinda feeling. Next, I'm not even going to camp this summer. Which really pisses me off. Because now I'm stuck in this damn town all fucking summer  with no escape  from my family or all my problems. That one week was always the highlight of my summer. And I don't even go on vacation til December. And even then, I'm with my family which doesn't make the greatest vacation. Oh and people from camp have to ask me "which one are you?" like they totally forgot about me. So that's really sweet. Arr...it's just so irritating going through this shit. Okay, I know I like giving advice and having people seem to need me. It's a nice feeling. But sometimes, I just get overwhelmed with it all. Like I'm suppose to be the one who solves their problems. As much as I would like to, I can't and I'm sorry.  I'm not God.  I just wish people would realize that.

      But don't we all? Ah, I'm so frustrated and confused and alone and depressed. I have so much going on in my life. And it's one of those times that everything just keeps building up. Soccer was good so it has nothing to do with how I feel. It's pretty much family and friends. I'll explain more later...

      I just had two things to write about and I'll post a poem too so it's pretty much just a quickie. (1) This morning my mom, brother, and I all had breakfast together. Granted it was almost noon, it was still breakfast. It was so nice. I mean we hadn't ate breakfast together as a family in like  months ! And I mean we hardly eat dinner together as a family so it was just cool. It's the simple things in life! (2) I really hope it stops raining because I wanna go to soccer practice tonight. I don't even mind that it's a work out day. I just need something to do. Soccer is my highlight of my week since my friends to seem to have forgotten about me. But it's cool. Pay back is a bitch. (wink, wink) I'm not even sure if soccer is canceled if it's raining. I hope it's not. It just keeps drizzling on and off so I hope that's all. I wanna play soccer!!  waaah!  Poem time...  Slowly Falling  "I love you too." I wish you meant it the same way I do. "I miss you." I want to believe that. "What would I do without you?" Think of her perhaps? "You’re my best friend." Then prove it.  I'm there to do your science project, And help you get the girl. You're there to help me up, And learn how to succeed. I'm too selfless, To think you care. You're too blind, To see how much I truly care. Lost without each other, Meant to be, Slowly falling, One harder than the other, And that's  me…

       DISCLAIMER: THIS POST IS EXTREMELY HARSH SO BE PREPARED. A LOT OF PERSONAL STUFF.   A few days ago I was in my brother's room and we were talking. I was sitting on the floor next to his computer and he was in the computer chair. He had the screen on but as I came in, he turned it off. I caught a glipse of it and it was  his own blog!  So a few days ago I tried searching for it. Ya know, to see what really happens in my brother's "crazy" life. I needed to make a user name to search and I wasn't in the mood to do all that fun stuff so I didn't. But today I was in the mood. Ha. I found it and read the  whole  thing. First of all, I would never picture my brother sitting in his room and typing in his own blog. I mean he was always the electronic one. Margaret (my sister) and I were always the artistic ones. I'm not saying Eddie can't be but it's just a big shocker. And a lot of the things I read totally hit home with me. Like I understand what he meant and how he felt. Hell, I'm his little sister, and I've known him my whole freaking life. What he goes through and what he feels are pretty much the same for me. But once I was done reading every single post,  I cried.  It was just all so emotional for me. And right now I'm still crying over it. Maybe it was because the first/last post (his first ever but the last one I read) was about my dad. And like just now I realized how much my brother was like a dad for me growing up. He taught me my first word, he always took care of me, we always got along... Now he's teaching me to drive, watching out for me, and now he always tells me if someone messes with me he'll kick their ass. I mean, they're things a dad should do... But I feel like I ruined his life. When he was younger, he could never go out and hang out with his friends because he always had to babysit me. And I feel like he missed out on so much because of me. Family is just a really emotional topic for me. I think the hand I was dealt was a pretty crappy one. I feel like I've had to rise above more shit than half the people in my life will ever have to deal with. And fuck. I'm only 14! How am I suppose to live life and be happy knowing my own father didn't want me to be born? How am I suppose to be Miss Always Smiles when my own dad tried killing me before I was even born? My life has been so screwed up. I have so many memories of running away, jumping out of my window, and just running... I was always scared of cops when I was younger because I saw them so much.  Like at my house.  I have so many memories of all the fights there were, of all the times my dad got drunk, of when I felt like I couldn't go on. This is what confuses me about God. I believe in Him, don't get me wrong.  But how can He just sit and watch all the shit that goes on in this world?  I believe He has control over all the bad shit that happens. I mean He has control over who dies and go to Heaven, so why doesn't He do something about all the crap in this world? Sometimes I'm just so confused by the world. One thing I've always did from when I was little but never told anyone... Have you ever just stood still, closed your eyes, and just saw yourself? As in an out of the body experience. And realized, wow, I'm really a person. I'm living this. This isn't a show, it's real. That doesn't really describe how I feel when I have this trip but I guess words can't describe how I feel. You might think I'm crazy but I already know I  am  crazy. And another reason that prevents me from ever being completely happy...I was an accident. I wasn't planned by my parents. I mean my mom told me most children are accidents but it doesn't change how I feel. Because I know how bad I screwed things up for them. Sometimes I think the world would be so much better off without me here. I feel like I'm just a useless person taking up space on Earth. And I know many people fell that way. Hell, for as many props people give me on my writing, I don't have  half  that  confidence in  myself!  I guess most of the time, my  true  friends are the reason I stay alive. And I mean  true  friends. As in Gretchen, Maria, Kristina, Erica, Mike, and Alecia. And I recently saw the true colors of some people. So that changes my opinion of them. I've had trouble with trust all my life and when people who know how I feel about friendships go and do the shit that kills me inside, I just get this WTF attitude. I don't wanna be friends with people who treat me like a back up person. I'm so sick of people expecting so much out of me and not allowing me to expect anything out of them. You'd be surprise at how much you can find in a person's room or cell phone or purse. Just a warning. You might wanna check some of the shit you have. And OMG! Never lie to my face. Just fucking tell me the truth. I'd prefer the truth soo much more than a lie. I'll be more pissed if you lie to me. But most of the time I can see through the lies. It's my sixth sense. Ah, before I ever become a psychologist, I better go to therapy for a  LONG  time. I sure as hell need it. I mean, look through all my poems. There are probably like 10 or less "happy" poems. And I have more than 150 poems. The majority of my poems are about dying, pain, heart break, cutting, all that. And you'd be surprise at how easily I lie to you all. I hide a lot of shit. But here's my therapist skills going to work. The reason I hide so much is so as to put a shield around myself.  To try to protect myself from ever being hurt.  I've been hurt too many times in life. And if certain people hurt me, I'd pretty much just melt because they are the people who keep me strong. I hope God has some plan where I come out on top in the end after all the shit I've been through. I have things threating my life at 14. I have more than a 75% chance of getting breast cancer. My mom has been complaining of a lump in her breasts. Breast cancer already took both my grandmother's lives. And omg, if my mom was added to that,  I would die.  My mom has done so much for me my whole life. I mean she's great. But I'm a perfectionist and the flaws that she has had in my life sometimes cause me to hate her for them. Then I have the chance of becoming an alcoholic. And alcoholism  increases the chance of breast cancer?  Isn't that ironic? I know I have a much better life compared to many people in the world and I should be grateful for what I have. I am grateful and I do realize that I have it good. But other people have it better and that's what I want. Perfectionist again. I get it from my dad if you can believe that. And abortions... I really don't know where I stand on that issue. Abortions have effected my life in several ways. Well, actually two (and a miscarriage, so now it's three). But I'd prefer not to talk about it. Like I know people who've had abortions and one in particular...she really benefited from it. Like I'm totally against killing a baby who has no control over anything but I feel like it is ultimately the woman's choice. Why does life have to be so confusing? Ahh, I just hope I die happy...Don't worry, this whole post was just a healthy way of getting things off my chest. I'm honestly fine. A little upset but I mean when you think back on your life, wouldn't  you  get upset too?  In the next post I'll put another poem in. Erica was the only one to say anything about it and she said she loved it so that means I can keep adding poems until  you  complain about 'em! Sweet dreams~  Hey. Do me a favor? Start commenting on my posts. I really wanna know what you guys think.

      Guess what I did all by myself tonight? I cooked Mac & Cheese! Alrite, it was the second time I ever attempted to make it. And the first time, I was with someone who had cooked it before so it wasn't like  I  did all the work. And I know all of you are thinking, "WTF? She's never made Mac & Cheese before?" And yeah, I know, it's freaking retarded but you have to understand, I'm not a cook. I don't know how to do anything fancy. Whatever, make fun of me if you will, but I'm extremely ectastic! On another note, I decided I should get back to reading my horrible books for summer reading for high school Honors English. Don't get me wrong, I love English/Language Arts, but I hate being told what to read! I started reading Lord of The Flies awhile back but I stopped because I couldn't stand it anymore and I wanted to read my Gossip Girl books. (See the post "Read This" if you don't understand) But sadly, I finished the rest of the Gossip Girl novels and now I'm stuck with summer reading bull shit. Before I read like 60 pages into it but I decided to re-read those 60 pages. And it took me awhile to read them so I must be crazy. I guess it's not insanity, it's just I wanna do really well in high school so I can get into college. See, I wanna go to Columbia University in New York. And that's an Ivy League college. I don't know many graduates of WHS who attended an Ivy League, do you? My point exactly. And I  REALLY  wanna get in there. Columbia is like  "the"  college for psychology. And that's what I wanna be. A psychologist and a writer of course. I had always planned on majoring in journalism since that's my main focus but then I realized, who ever said you  need  a major in journalism to write a book? I mean, of course, it'd help, but it's not required. So I might as well perfect something else in case my books suck. But I mean, where's the chance in that? LoL! That's just me being cocky. I'm so  scared  of failing. Failing meaning not getting into Columbia, failing meaning everyone hates my books, failing meaning I would at McDonald's the rest of my life... I have  huge  dreams and I just want them all to come true. Ya know? And god, I'm only 14 and I'm worrying about all of this now. Wait til I'm 17. I'll be a wreck then. Oh geez... New subject. The poem I posted a few days ago. Well, no one commented on it so I'm hoping you all liked it. Well in case ya did, here's another one. And  PLEASE  post a comment so I know if you guys like my writing and for me to continue to post them or just to stop. Thanks!  Fell Out  Falling in love is one thing, falling out is another. I kept slipping under,  as you hit the cold, hard ground. I was in love, and I thought you were too. But somewhere between the parties and the dates, you fell out. You left me here to drown in my own affection, while you could breath easily on your own. I hope you like it alone, because the air in my lungs is finally running out..

      Do you like to read? Well, if you do, then you should totally read the  Gossip Girl  series by Cecily von Ziegesar. They are really good.

It includes: sex, drugs, drinking, parties, and a lot more. So check it out. There's a website too. www.gossipgirl.net

      Okay so today my mom asked me to go to the mini mart down the street and get pop. I agreed and set out on my journey. As I was venturing down the humid street, I heard my name faintly being called. I stopped out of confusion and searched for the voice who summoned me. It was next door neighbor. She informed me that her and her husband were going out of town for two weeks and she'd love it if I could water her beautiful flowers while they were away. I agreed since I've done little jobs like this for them before. She wandered in the house and put $5 in my hand and said, "$5 now and $5 when I get back." So that was cool, I was just going to the store and got $10! YaY! And I was only writing with weird words because it sounded cool. I'm not crazy. But speaking of money. People always say money can't buy happiness. But I honestly think it can. You can't really buy  good  friends but you can certainly meet lots of new people. You buy the house you always wanted, the car, everything. I know that's materialism but then maybe I'm materialistic because money could buy me happiness...

      Wow, it just occurred to me that in the almost two months that I've been "blogging" that I've never posted any of my poems. And my poems are like...me! If that even made any sense to you. Well, I was bored out of my mind a few minutes ago so I turned on my Avril Lavinge CD and went to "(So Much For)My Happy Ending." I dunno why, I just clicked a track, and it was that one. And I started writing. And I got this. Tell me what you think or if you want me to post more. Thanks!   You Never Knew Me   You never knew me, Bits and pieces were just scattered on the ground, Picked 'em up and put them together. Wasn't too difficult, It was just fill in the blanks. You never saw through the lies, Always believed the fake smiles. Never knew what was hidden beneath, Almost caught me once. But you thought you knew me, So you believed me after I put up a fight. If you knew me, you should have known. I've been in love with him from the start... It wasn't your fault, I loved you too. But the love I had for him just came first, Because he was everything I ever wanted...

      Lately I've been so amazed with how people can say one thing to your face and do the complete opposite 10 minutes later. I guess that whole "actions speak louder than words" saying is true. I never really believed it before but now I do. And the people who say the things to my face are people who I thought I could count on. Good friends. But with every passing day, I've realizing how much people lie. And how much people use me for advice, phone numbers, and everything else. It's just disgusting. And I'm getting so sick of being nice to the people who treat me like crap. Another thing that pisses me off: how one person can trash another person so bad and the next day they're hanging out and being best friends again, the one person acting like they never trashed the other. It's like what the fuck? I'm so sick of all these people. It's getting to the point where I can only stand a few of them. Screw it, I really don't care about being popular or having everyone like me anymore, if my so-called "friends" are gonna treat me like shit, then fuck them! Honestly. I mean I've tried to see if it's just a faze they're going through but too many people care about being popular, impressing the guys, and being little whores, that they don't include me in any outings. I'm sorry but I can only tolerate so much bull shit. So keep up with your games and you could lose a friend. Seriously. I'm not into games. I think you know who you are. Sooner or later, guys are gonna start realizing personalities are more important than how much skin you show so yeah... fuck this all...

      I guess not putting a new post up for three days causes some of you to freak out! coughcough ERICA coughcough Actually, it kinda makes me feel special. So many people are like, "OMG! I read your website  all the time !" So thanks to all of you who always read this! Anyway, the reason I haven't posted in awhile is because I've been busy starting this buddyprofile. OMG! It's awesome! Ask Erica! It's so much better than a SubProfile. You can change everything so it's all colorful and everything! Here, check it out:  urlLink   http://www2.buddy4u.com/index.php And if you wanna look at my profile, check out my AIM profile for it!

      For the last few weeks, I've really been thinking a lot about myself and my life. It sounds really crazy for me to say that when I'm only 14 years old. But a lot of adults really don't understand what it's like to be 14 these days. They always assume it's the same from when they were 14. I mean I know there are similarities  but there are so many differences  and that's what they fail to see. These days, I don't really think the world is too accepting towards teens. Times change, I wish people would realize that. Just because there is  one  druggie-thief teenager  doesn't mean the rest of us are all druggie-thieves.  And then they play this whole thing on us about how the future is in our hands. Adults...uh! They just piss me off. Then again, most people piss me off but adults more because they are so oblivious by anything. Okay but back to what I was saying. So I've been thinking a lot and I realized a lot of things. One thing kinda became clear.... How many poets are actually ALIVE and famous? Silverstein was the only one and then he died... That's the only one I can think of! And that's not good! So I was thinking there's only a slim chance of me becoming this famous and well known poet in my lifetime. I mean Poe and Dickinson all became famous AFTER they died, and I don't want that. So I'm thinking about taking a different route. I believe a lot of writers have to do this at one point or another. I'm considering trying to write a book or series before I try to write a poetry book. I imagine that will be enough to get me "known." And then who knows? I might be the next Poe...or better yet please let me be the next  me...  Also, I think I'm starting to get over the whole caring what other people think of me thing. Which makes me very ectastic!

      Today was the first day that I ever drove a car by myself.  Snaps for Lauren!  See Eddie (my older brother) and I went to the high school to go work out this afternoon. As we were leaving, he did a donut and got out of the car. So I followed him and got out too. Then he was like, "Go ahead, get in," motioning me to get in the drivers' seat. I was like WHAT? While we were working out, I was talking about him teaching me to drive but I didn't expect him to take me right then! So I was driving! Honestly, I was scared. Like I'm always freaked out about car accidents so I was driving like super slow in the parking lot. Even though I was the only moving car. The first time I hit the gas, I gave it way too much, and I sorta screamed. But I feel like I did a very good job and I just think I need a lot of practice for when I'm 16! I'm counting down the days! 1 year, 6 months, and 23 days! And only 1 year and 23 days til I can get my tempts! I can't wait...although, I'm a little frightened. But that can all be fixed with a lot of practice!

       WARNING: This is my opinion and this is about my school so don't flip out if it's different for you!   Yup, that's right. Sex. I wanna talk about  sex.  (Hey! That's a song! Just throw in the "baby" part.) In school, they teach you all that Sex Ed. But I personally think it's not as detailed as it should be. In Sex Ed, they teach you all the reasons  NOT  to have sex. They don't tell you anything about HOW to have sex or where to get the morning after pill in case we decide to or we get drunk one night and make a mistake. I bet half the people in my grade don't even know what the morning after pill is or what it does or what EC is. Or where to get it more importantly. Just the other day, one of my friends was like, "OMG, did you know they have  female  condoms?" She said it like it was so amazing. Our school's sexual education classes should teach us  about  sex and about all the forms of protection that can be used and all the details about those forms of protection.  My magazines are doing a better job informing me about sex and protection and statistics then my own freaking school.  Now do you think that's right? I don't. As much as they stress sex in school, the things they teach us,  SUCK!  Okay, they cover STD's pretty well and HIV's and AID's. But I mean, it's not like in Mean Girls where the Sex Ed teacher is like, "Don't have sex. You  will  get an STD and you  will  DIE!" It's not as drastic. And they make it out to be that way. They don't give us a comfortable environment to talk about it or make themselves (the teachers) approachable in case we have really private questions we're too afraid to mention in class. Also, stop shoving the whole "stay a virgin til marriage" thing down our throats. I understand why they do that and I agree with them that it's the best choice, but stop making it sound like if we have sex before we get married we're trash. It's our decision. You can add your two cents but don't MAKE us agree. Staying a virgin until marriage these days, seems completely pointless to me. Once again, this is my opinion so don't flip at me. To me, it feels like the person I'm gonna fall in love with and marry is not gonna be a virgin. And I waited my whole life to give him this great "gift" of mine when he gave his away so long ago. Ironic, now isn't it? That's what I feel will happen to  a lot  of us when we get older. So I don't see the point in waiting to give that person something so special that hardly means anything anymore. I mean seriously, it's all over the place. Sex. I mean, God knows most of the celebrities weren't virgins til marriage. Except for Jessica Simpson. Most of them have kids with all different dads or moms! Sex is everywhere! If you look up lyrics to songs, most of them refer to sex and 12 year old kids go around singing it acting cool. The media is to blame for this. They take something that should be special and break it down into the "cool" thing to do. But I'm not even sure if sex really should be considered something special between two people. I dunno, it's just my opinion. I'm not saying it's okay to run around and get pregnant when you're 14 but follow your heart and if you feel your ready (physically and emotionally) then go ahead. Talk to your parents, get protection, and go ahead. You have one life to live. And you never know exactly how long it's gonna last.

      Wow. It's so funny how people can react when you begin to fight and the things they say. It's so funny how they believe they  just know  what you feel or think or any of that. I admit, I'm guilty of that too so sorry! But I just got into this "big discussion" with an this person and  I could really care less.  I guess when you have two days to just sit around because you're burnt to a crisp (did I tell you guys I have horrid sun burn? oh well, I do...), you have nothing better to do but lay in bed and think (and read, which I did a lot of that too!). And let me tell you, I thought about a lot of shit. And here I am just smiling...

      Piercings. I have five. Doubles and cartilage. I plan on getting three more. Belly button, nose, and another cartilage. This summer I was suppose to get my second cartilage but it's sorta too late for that because I have soccer in August where I'll have to take it out so I might as well just wait til after the season. But the other day, I realized I could play soccer with my belly button pierced... So I brought up that idea with my mom. At first, she seemed like she was considering it and it could be a possibility but then she got all mad at me for asking. She was like, "Why do you always bring this up?" That was the second time I ever asked her about my belly button! I just want a good reason from her and I can handle waiting. But my mom's so called "good" reason: "I don't wanna be responsible for a major infection." But she was willing to be responsible for a major infection in my cartilage. Which did happen by the way and she was the one freaking out. Sigh. I don't see what's so bad about it. She even told me I had to wait til I'm 18 to get it pierced. And that pissed me off. I work my ass off in school, I'm fucking class president, I play a bunch of sports, I don't smoke, I don't have sex...it my opinion, I'm a pretty good kid. And I feel I should be rewarded for those things. God knows, my parents hardly say how proud of me they are and I'm by far the best child academically. I'm counting down the years until I can go away to college. I can't wait. I'm only coming back for Christmas and that's it. I don't wanna live here the rest of my life. This isn't the place for me. I don't belong here. My mom doesn't understand that I need to experiment with things and find out who I really am. She's too busy worrying about images. That's why she won't let me dye my hair. Piercings, hello, they come out. No one has to know what you have pierced. I wish I could talk to you about stuff in my life but every time I try she either ignores me, doesn't remember, or lectures me about it rather than being supportive. Oh and another thing. I feel like the biggest loser. The only person that ever invites me to do anything is Annie. Everyone else? It's like I'm non-existent to them. It's quite ridiculous in my opinion. Because then I feel used because people always call me to get other people's phone numbers, or doing school they just use me to get homework, or rides home when we go out. It's so crazy. I mean, since when does everyone hate me and why? What did I ever do to them? Margaret says they're just jealous of me but I feel like there's not much to be jealous of. But she admitted to feeling jealous of me at times. I don't know it's a screwed up world. And I hate when people act like they know you and know things inside of you, like why you act the way you do. And tell me you know your right and you don't have to tell me because I already know. Sorry if that doesn't make much sense to you guys but I don't feel like explaining the whole situation. I just hate that someone thinks they know me so well as to know how I'm feeling at this very moment. Ya never know, I might just surprise ya...

      Family...a few months ago, I felt like I hardly needed them. After all the pain they put me through my whole life, what was the point in giving them more and more chances to just let me down? See my sister moved back home last June. Back then, we were never really close as kids or when she lived with my dad or her boyfriend but once we got into the groove of things at home, it was great. Now we're we're best friends, we can trust each other with anything, and it feels good. We both have a whole new set of clothes and make up and everything! We share it all! Everything is up for grabs! Most of you who know me, know that I didn't have the best dad or the best childhood growing up. There was a lot of problems and a hell of a lot of fights. And that my dad wasn't a part of my life for  more than 7 years...  But I'm happy to say my dad is back in my life. He's soo much better than what he was those seven years ago. He's really matured and gotten serious. It's soo nice to see the "new" him. I've seen him twice in the past three weeks. It's really nice to just hang out with him and my other family. Like seriously, I never knew how close everyone was until now. My McGrath side of the family is so close. My uncle and my dad cheer me on for burping! I mean, wow! I was doing things in front of my dad that other people would kill me for. And it was cool because last time we hung out, he asked me to give him some of my poems and this time I did. I gave him three, Time Flies, Death, and Stay, Don't Go. I'm really nervous about what he'll think because that's how I am about my writing but I think he'll like em. And I've realized my family is so supportive! Like my uncle was saying I'm so beautiful and that I'm gonna be a great driver, despite what my older brother says. He even got mad when my brother kicked me out of a convo. It seems like everyone is always there for each other. Like they just walk around and say, "I love ya man" or "I love ya bro!" This is everything I've ever wanted but never gotten. A note to everyone else: Every situation is different, I know that but please, all of you try to stay close with your family and form a really good bond with them. Let me tell you, it sure as hell feels good to just be able to say, "My dad thinks I'm awesome for burping..."  Just always give them another chance to let you down because you never know, they might just surprise you, and bring you up...

      So I'm just sitting here, pondering what to write about for my newest post, and just looking around. All of a sudden, I see this note from my brother. When I woke up this morning and walked into the living room, I glanced at the computer and found this note: "I unplugged the pc in the back so just plug it back in 2 use.... because it kept turning on by itself.... I'm NOT kidding. ~Eddie" Creepy huh? Well, I believed it because just yesterday morning I was sitting on the couch reading when the computer started making all these noises and turned on. I asked Eddie if there was anywhere he could turn on my computer from his computer in his room. He said no. This isn't the first time anything like this has ever happened before. One time I walked out through my back door and was going in the back yard as I heard footsteps coming up the stairs. I figured it was my sister because her room is in the basement and my mom and brother were both on the other side of the house. When I got back in, I asked where my sister was and my mom said she was still sleeping. So then I asked who went downstairs and my mom said no one... And it wasn't like I was just hearing things, it was loud, big, footsteps... This other time, I was home alone and it was about midnight. I was in my room, listening to music pretty loud and I had to pee, so I went across the hall to the bathroom. When I got in the bathroom, I heard noise in the basement and footsteps in the hall... Suddenly, the volume of my music went down  a lot!  And no one was home to do it! All my family members have experienced some weird situation at our house...which led us to believe that a  ghost lives here too.  So what do you guys think? Do you believe in ghosts? Have you ever had anything freaky happen to you? I'd love to hear about it, use the comment-thing to get your stories to me! Thanks~

      Last night I went to bed super early. At 1:30! Geez, I haven't went to bed before 1:30 all summer! I didn't really have anything to do and I was pretty upset. So I went to bed and  just cried  for awhile. It started raining so I just listened to that and eventually I fell asleep. I woke up around 11:30, just as Eddie was leaving to go to my grandpa's to paint. It felt good to get to sleep in for once. And to get 10 hours of sleep. During school I'm lucky if I get seven. So I went to eat breakfast and then after I just went online for an hour or so. I talked to Gretchen so that made me happy. She's still in Mexico. She comes back Friday. It's quite depressing. She's been going out with her boyfriend for 9 months now. I mean, come on,  why don't I have a boyfriend?  Being single has been good for me and I enjoy being able to do whatever the hell I wanna but  it's still lonely.  Later I read some Tom Sawyer then and I finished the CosmoGIRL I've had for like a week. I always read my Cosmo's like the day I get them but since I've had to read Tom, I had to take a break from CG. Then I read some more Tom Sawyer and went online.  I just don't know anymore.  People are just so confusing. Like I don't know what's going on anymore. And I'm ready to scream. It's just so frustrating. Especially how people say crap to me thinking they're being sweet but they really have no idea what's going on.  Hell, I don't even know.  So don't say things that are just gonna make me sigh and be like, " I wish ..." I planned on staying in my PJ's til I left for soccer and I'm proud to say it happened. Ha ha. I was comfy, so I didn't wanna change. Eddie told me his friend Greg was coming over to mess around with his car so I was like, "Alright, just stay outside. I'm not changing and I look like shit." Well, actually, I looked cute in a way! And I even had to go outside a few times so yeah. Greg's kinda cute! :) It was five and I realized I hadn't even been drinking water and I still had to ice my foot and everything. See, I try to drink at least three glasses of water everyday before practice. So I started to freak out. I don't know, just a billion things were happening at once. I was trying to carry on convos with certain people but it wasn't working out. I was trying to get some info out of one person but that wasn't working out either. But I did find out my cousin Chris is coming up this Friday for the day and part of Saturday. So that made me happy! He was suppose to come up last weekend but his plans changed so he didn't. I'm guessing we're gonna hang out Friday night so yay! And I get to Matt so that's all good! Maybe I'll see my dad?  Hopefully.  So I went to change into my soccer clothes and since Eddie and Greg were both outside, I walked out of my room in just my sports bra (which isn't a big deal in the first place,  it's not like the damn thing is skimpy ) and I ran into Eddie. And I was like, "Whoa!" Just because he scared me. I didn't expect to run into him. And he's like, "God. You know I'm home so just put a shirt on." He thought I was whoa-ing because I was in a sports bra. Whatever. I used to take baths with the boy. And plus, he's my bro, so too bad. So then I went to soccer. Soccer was the same. Me yelling at people, my foot hurting like a bitch, but today I was ready to kill Donny. Ok, I can't sprint at full speed because of my foot. Even the coach knows that. I'm not gonna push myself at practice and just hurt it more. If I need to sprint full speed at tomorrow's scrimmage then I will. It's totally different then. But Donny just kept yelling at me because I wasn't going full sprint and all this bull shit. And I told him about my foot but he just said some crap and I'm like, "Screw it. Say what you wanna, but I'm not gonna do it. I know when to push myself and when not to." Geez. Then I had to go to Giant Eagle w/ my mom and Eddie. I saw some of the guys there so I waved.  I looked like a dork  in my cleats and shin guards and my hair was a mess. Oh well. Mark was the only hot one there. And I don't even like him so it's not like it matters. Nicole and I were talking about the hot people on the soccer team and what not today at practice. It was quite funny. I was limping all through the store. My foot hurt so bad. I started to feel sick too because I hadn't ate in 6 hours so I was happy to get home and eat some pizza. I filled a bucket with ice and water and have been icing both my feet all night. I'm nervous for tomorrow.  Tomorrow is my first high school soccer scrimmage ever!  Go figure. I don't know what to expect.  I just wanna prove myself . I don't wanna go and screw up and have everyone think that I suck. I just wanna play good. All of you should come and cheer the team on!! So I've just been chilling all night. No one called me or anything. But I don't really care. I wouldn't have wanted to do anything anyways. I'm thinking about going to bed really soon too. Mr. Willis told us to get a good night's sleep so yeah. I have to be at the school by 4:15ish.  So for all you losers who don't go , I'll tell you all the wonderful details tomorrow. I really wanna talk to someone though. So I'm waiting to see if they come online. I don't wanna call them at midnight just to discuss crap. I wanted to paint my nails but I'm too lazy. I found out my "grandma's" (Rosie) husband (George) is pretty much helpless. Like the doctors can't do anything to him so it's just a matter of time til he dies. At least my mom put it that way. God, that's gonna hard. Especially for Rose. Ah, why do people have to die? I'm kinda mad at Margaret too. Like lately, I've been telling her stuff about what's been going on with me  and she doesn't really care.  Which is weird for her. I don't know. She's in some weird phase. But it annoys me because I can't really talk to her now and I can  never  talk to my mom. My God, I was on the phone w/ Tina today and I was in the kitchen and my mom was in there too. I started talking about this one person and my mom's like, "Tell Kristina to hold on. Now who is this person?" She's so nosy and she expects me to tell her shit. Ha. Like that's gonna happen. I don't like telling her crap.  She can never be happy for me.  She always has something  bad  to say about what I tell her. So I just try to avoid these types of conversations altogether. That doesn't mean I don't wish I could talk to her. Because I  really  wish I could. I guess I was just always closer to my dad.  I don't wanna think about this now but whatever.  It really upsets me how he's been gone for most of my life.  I never understood why he didn't call or write a letter or anything. He had our number and he knew where we lived. And if he forgot, my cousins all knew.  It just sucks for me because Eddie's been the father figure for me all my life.  I just wish I had  my dad as the father figure  and Eddie as the older brother figure. It sucks because  what does my dad really know about me?  I don't even know. It just pisses me off because I think if given the time and all that, I could tell my dad everything. And I could ask him for advice and all that.  I think the two of us have a connection  that would allow that. And it still gets me how my dad has never seen me play soccer, seen me at a track meet or at a basketball game. It's just I hardly get through the pain, how can he go through that pain multiplied by three? (meaning my sis and bro) I'm not sure if this is okay to say but I'll say it anyways.  I think he missed me the most.  I mean Margaret lived with him til she was 18 and Eddie saw him a lot more than me. Part of me is still my daddy's little girl. I don't care how much I've grown up.  I wanna be that little girl again.  And the stupidest thing is I can hardly write about this. I mean I have a few poems about my dad but nothing I could ever give him.  They're all so mean.  And they blame him for everything that went wrong in my life. Granted, he was the main reason of it all. It's just hard to look around at these daughters and fathers and see them all so happy. I dunno when I'll be able to get over this all. I get in these stages where I care so much for awhile and then I just get depressed and don't even bother. Although it's really hard to not care. I mean I have this guys blood. I look just like him. I mean without him, I wouldn't be here. But then I think about when I saw him.  And I think about that hug.  And it's those kind of feelings  that keep me holding on.   I'm so happy around him.  And all of this seems to brings me to tear  every single  time. My family is so screwed up. I mean seriously. And I'm a perfectionist. (How did I become one anyways?) I don't know how anything fits together. But I'm hoping as I get older, all the pieces will just fall into place...Well, I'm out. Night night. I'm just pissed because I still need to talk to someone. Whatever.  I'm used to people letting me down...    HAPPY 13TH BIRTHDAY TO JENNY!! LOVE YA BABE AND MISS YOU SOO MUCH!

       If you're wondering about my title, well, it' s because I was on the phone with Annie. I couldn't think of a title so I told her to give me a word and she told me "hi." She asked why I needed a word and I told her it was for my title and she's asked if she could say another word. So she said sexy and I was like okay. But then I decided to put them together. Just felt like sharing that little story with ya. So today I woke up at around 10:30. I ate, got ready, and went to my grandpa's. I was pissed because my uncle was there and he's such an ass. I was worried because as Eddie, my mom, and I were driving down the street my grandpa is in the middle of the road going to the house across the street. My grandpa isn't good at walking anymore, he broke his hip awhile back. So I was like what the hell Grandpa?! But he was just putting some lady's newspaper on her front steps so it as a sweet thought but stuff like that was why he broke his hip in the first place. He was being thoughtful and taking out some lady's garbage and he slipped on ice and broke his hip. So we stayed there for awhile. It was kinda funny, my uncle lost his wallet and he was going crazy looking for it.  Sadly , he found it. So then I came home and fell asleep on the couch for awhile. I was being bitchy for awhile. I'm not sure why but I just was. I think I was just stressed about stuff. So then I woke up and went to paint a second coat on the trim of my big window. Then I came online. I got upset because I was talking to Maura about shit and what I asked her to find out for me  wasn't  good. I got pissed at myself because it was  my  fault. I couldn't blame anyone else for my screw up. And it just got me really depressed because I felt like I screwed up something really good. So then I went to soccer kinda upset. But with soccer, once I start practicing,  everything  fades from my mind. And I mean everything! Soccer wasn't too hard. But my foot hurt  sooo  bad. And my left one began to hurt to because I've been putting all my pressure on that foot. And in addition to this all, my shin splints are coming back so that's  just great!  Then I came home and ate and talked to people. Congrats go out to all the people who made volleyball. I'm am soo sorry to Lauren, Annie, Tracy, and whoever else didn't make the team. The coach is on crack! I  totally  forgot Chris asked me to come over so sorry Chris! So I just sat around relaxing. I tried to have a big convo with Eddie but he just didn't wanna talk about it. I dunno if he didn't like the topic or if it was because he was about to go out. I dunno, I just wish all he cared about  was if I was happy.  Not the other things he's worrying about. And my mom is no help either. She favors him. I know she does because he's the only boy. So we're gonna continue the convo once he gets home or tomorrow. Ah. Parents and siblings. Oh and Margaret had like a nervous breakdown tonight. She found out some shit and started bawling her eyes out. I laughed so she hit me. But I mean, come on.  The reason she was crying was fucking bull shit.  I really wish I could explain this one but people who are involved, read this so I can't. I just think it's crazy what she was saying and why she's crying. Oh well. Maybe I really was suppose to be the  big  sister. God knows, I act like it enough. No poem tonight. Too lazy.  Way  too lazy. I'm so tired. I might be going to bed really soon. Night night

       I woke up at 8 today because my mom and sister needed to do crap and I was being dragged along. I'll admit it, I was being whiney and bitchy because I was nervous to go get my foot checked out. It's not like I was snapping at my mom or sis. My mom was actually the one who snapped at me so then I got super quiet and pouty. But Margaret was in a good mood so she was being a bitch to me and making fun of me and everything immature you could imagine! So we went to the bank and grocery shopping so I was having a  blast.  After that, we headed up to the high school. The football team had their doubles. I had to go inside to talk to the sports doctor. Her name was Jen. Jen was helping one of my brother's friends who hurt his neck or shoulders just before in pratice and then we went back outside to the field so we could talk about my foot. I explained what happened, how it happened, what hurt, and so on. She put pressure on different parts of my foot and asked me if any of them hurt. The only part that really hurt was the part coming down from the toe next to my big toe. I'm not sure what it's called. Jen told me nothing was broken or sprained or fractured but I probably  bruised the bone.  So she gave me a patch, wrap, and tape for my foot. She also told me to ice it before and after practice, to not walk on it much, to not tighten my laces so much, and to always put up my ankle. I did ice it before and after practice but I have to walk, I can't help it. I don'e like not being able to get up. I laced my cleats a little less tight but I still can't help that either. I like to make sure their on and they don't come undone. About putting my ankle up, well, it worked for a little bit of today. Other than that, I've had my ankle down. Ah, this is difficult. I wish it was easier.  I wish my foot was okay to begin with.  So then we went home and I turned on the computer because I wanted to make a quick little post about my foot. But Margaret was like, "Please can I just go on for two minutes to check something about my bank?" I  baby her. That's what I do.  I said yes.  Forty  minutes later, I read some Tom Sawyer and began to doze off on my bed as Margaret continued to play on the computer. Ah! She's pissing me off. So then we went to Target. I love that store. I really needed to go bra shopping so that's what I was doing. OMG!  I got two sports bras!  Typical for the rest of you girls but I don't do sports bras. Well, I do now. Let me tell you one thing: Running a mile in soccer with your period (my boobs hurt like fuck then), is just  hell.  They just bounce everywhere. Other than that, normal bras work fine for me but the bras I got are really comfy so I'm happy. And another thing. Sports bras flatten my boobs. (sad face) I don't like that. I ended up getting another bra. It was some 5-way bra because I really needed a strapless one since I'm always stealing Margaret's. I also got a pair of white ( !! ) shorts, black, white, and blue flip flops, and hair bands. So yeah that was really exciting. But the funniest thing was I was looking at something and I go to find my mom and Margaret. If you didn't know or forgot, Margaret is  23.  She acts like a two year though. I'm not even joking. She always says how  I'm  the one who acts like the big sis, not her. So I find my mom and guess what I see?  Margaret is sitting in the cart.  Yes. In the cart. I took a picture of it too. I always carry my camera, don't ask. So she sat in there the whole time and was acting very childish. But at least this was just a show. So we came home and no surprise, that girl ran to the computer. I mean, come on, I'm 14 and have no life. She's 23, she has a life. Doesn't she have anything better to do than sit around online all day? I read some more Tom Sawyer and cleaned a little and did some crunches. So I finally got online because my mom and Maggie left to go get something. But as soon as they get back, Marge begins t fight w/ me because her internet boyfriend IMed her and I didn't want her to go on the computer. So I made the mistake of letting her type whatever to him as she just sat next to me. Let's just say, I saw  a lot  of things I didn't wanna. Then I had a few interesting conversations. One is a lot more upsetting than the other because it really does mess with my head and the other one is just fucked up.  Now, I'm super confused and upset and worried and I don't know how to handle either one.  Well, I sorta just came up with a solution to the fucked up one but it's more of an excuse not a solution. So I was pretty much crying over those two things. I got ready for soccer. Yes, I iced my foot. I bandaged it all up which made it a little difficult to walk and run. So I go to soccer. I knew I had to watch myself but  I'm  very  stubborn.  I'm play through the pain. Even if I'm ready to die. I will. That's just how I am. I don't like giving in to pain. I was waiting to talk to Mr. Willis when Steve comes up to me and  smacks my butt and says "good game"  and I just laugh and say thanks. Later, he was rubbing my shoulders for a minute, he's cool. He's funny so he makes the running easier. It was alright. My breathing was cool. It was my foot slowing me down this time. We did three on a ball and then we did trapping drills. My one was  really  good so I was proud of myself. Then we did trapping with another person so one person takes the ball and the other defends or "contains" them. The first one me and Nicole did was  really  good! But then the next one, I tripped in a whole and scratched Nicole. What can I say?  We have crappy fields.  Then the next one, she went to switch sides while I was trying to contain her and she hit my hand and my inhaler went flying. I didn't know whether to keep going or get the inhaler but I decided to top and find my inhaler because I didn't wanna lose it, ya know? Then we did some flag, square, and kill drills. Those weren't that bad. Overall the main problems of the day were my foot and the field. The grass is super high and there are holes  everywhere.  But I guess it prepares us for situations like this ya know? I felt like I did a good job. Then we went to go hand out uniforms in the locker room. I asked for 13 and got it! I was soo happy!  13 is my number!  But then we were handing out the away jersey's and the coach didn't call 13. So I was like WTF? In the end there wasn't an away jersery with a 13 so I had to switch numbers. I ended up picking...number 1!!  I'm number 1!!  Lol! I can walk around and say that and know that I am! I guess it was good that I got 1 because 13 was an extra large and 1 was a medium. My shorts are a large so that's cool. But the socks I got...well, let's just say, I need to get other ones because my calves are too big for them. Then I came home and ate and watched TV.  Good luck to everyone with volleyball try outs tomorrow.  OMG! By the way, my brother went on a date tonight! Awww... LOl! I don't know the girl. She went to South. I think she graduated this summer. But my mom said she's really pretty and sweet. So that's good. Ah, I'm freaking out. I wanna get my cartilage pierced again now! Or my belly button! But I have to wait to get my cartilage til after soccer and I think I'm getting my belly button for my 15th birthday. Maybe. Oh well. I'm really tired and I gotta wake up around 10. So I'll talk to you later. Sorry no times for poems lately. Soon I promise!  I'm just praying my foot gets better really soon...       By the way the song "Somebody Told Me" by the Killers is awesome! I'm totally in love with it.

       Okay, so here are the details I sorta left out from yesterday's post. Saturday's details are just boring so it's not like they matter. But Sunday. Let's focus on Sunday. The beach. The beach was awesome. I had so much fun. Surprisingly, I didn't get burned. At all. Even after being there for 6 hours. I'm red around my boobs and my face but it's not painful. My back is peeling from the other trip to the beach but it's not like Tracy's! About Machy and Tim now because some funny stuff was said. But I just realized I said Machy was 6 in my last post, I forgot the one. Machy is 16. I didn't believe them when they said Tim was 19 because I asked him and he's like, "I'm 18..." pause "No, I'm 19." It was just weird, ya know? Originall, Tracy and I both saw Tim and we thought he was cute and we were gonna go talk to him but us girls were having too much fun. And then suddenly a very large football came and landed by us. Obviously, they did it on purpose because it was far behind the one kid so Car and me went and got the football and she threw it back to him. Then we started playing catch and talking. We were talking about lesbians and making fun of Carly for going to Beaumont. It's funny because they had no idea what VASj, Regina, Beaumont, and so was. We were talking about drinking and Machy was like, "You guys should come to a party at my friend Brendan's house tonight." Ha ha. Yeah right.  Like I'm gonna go to a party with people I just met and probably get drugged and raped. Yes, that's my favorite way to spend my Sunday night.  They were both really nice though. We were all playing volleyball but we had to leave so we said bye. I can't remember who but one of the girls wanted their numbers and  I was the only one with enough balls to go get it.  But I had to run which bothered my foot. So I got both their numbers. I just think it's funny I had to run after them because they were walking away. So then I came home, got ready for soccer, and left. I was talking to Carly about her hair because she got it "relaxed." Or whatever it's called. It looked really good. I had to talk to Mr. Willis about my foot. Today when I was at the beach I called my mom nearly crying because it hurt so bad. I told her I needed a doctor's appointment asap and that I couldn't run at soccer. So I told the coach this and he told me to come see a sports doctor at the football doubles Monday morning because my doctor would just say to stay off of it for 2 weeks. So details on that later. Then I got to dig up dirt to fill the holes in the field. But it was hard to decide what was a hole or not because the grass was like a foot high. Peter took the land mower and mowed "Peter" in the grass pretty big so that was funny. After that we could pretty much leave but people wanted to play keep away so they stayed. I would have played but I my foot hurt and I was like, "Ah, just go home and figure out what you're doing tonight." Annie, Reea, and Carly were at Chris' and wanted me to go but at that time I didn't really want to. I was in a really weird mood. Like I was totally confused about things and I thought I just needed time to lay down and think. So I came home and ate and just sat around for awhile. I was sorta waiting to talk to my brother. We needed to have a "heart to heart." It was very calm but Eddie got his point across  very  loud and clear. A lot of the time, he asks things of me that are simple but what we were talking about that night was a big deal. At that point, he was kinda telling me what to do and I was just like, "Oh, come on." I just wanted everyone to be happy and not have this problem. I didn't really say anything to my brother about my view but he knows I don't agree and didn't follow his wishes. Well, he didn't know  to what extreme  I didn't follow them. But I think he realizes it's pretty much up to me so he can have his two cents but ultimately, it's my life so it's my choice. Anyways, I called Annie and decided to go to Chris' so I got ready and went there. No one answered the door so I just went in the house and out back. Carly, Reea, Annie, and Urban were the only people there who I knew. And then it was Shawn and his friends. Shawn is Chris' brother. As soon I get there, Carly is calling Alex and telling him to come get us all because  I'm  hungry and wanna go to Wendy's. My god. The girl was the one who wanted Wendy's, not me! So Alex came and we went and got  Carly's  Wendy's. Then we went back to Chris' and watched Urban and Shawn's friends play poker. I'm not sure who won now that I think of it. I know it as between Urban and someone else. Eventually, we left, dropped Carly off, and the four of us went to Taco Bell, and then we all went home. I went to bed around 2ish or 3ish. I was exhausted. So exhausted I didn't even clean my room like I normally do on Sunday's. I didn't even do it today. Oh well. I'm gonna do another post for today so see ya soon! Yes and boys surely have an odd obsession with Taco Bell. Whatever floats their boat I guess. Oh yeah. An update on an old and current problem. Every time I eat,  I  still  feel sick afterways.  No matter how hungry I was. If I was starving or if I was stuffed or everything inbetween. And Tom Sawyer is a good book. I mean I'm not in love with it but it's not too bad to read after all.

       My god. Do you know how  hard  it is for me to go a day without blogging? The main reason I do this is because writing in a journal just doesn't work for me. I think it has to do with actually having to write it out and then having to hide it. But with this, I just type (and I'm a quick typer if I do say so myself) and I can be online talking to people at the same time. Call it lazy if you want but I think this is a lot better than writing in a journal. And plus, you guys get a pretty good view at my life. Any who, I have a damn lot to tell you and a damn lot  not  to tell you so let's get on with it.      Friday night I went to bed at 5am. I would have stayed up later but Eddie was going to take a shower and told me to go to sleep. So I went to bed. I got up at around 11 because there were these strange girls knocking on my door, (my parents and sis weren't home and Eddie was sleeping) trying to sell some crap but I didn't answer the door so they left. Then I ate breakfast and Annie called me and asked me if I wanted to come over and I said sure so I got ready and left. Carly, Cook, and Ree were already there. As I walked in their all like, "Wow.  She's all dressed up.  She's wearing make up and she has her hair done and we're just like blah." They were like "scrubby." I was only wearing capris and a yellow tank top. How is that dressed up? Then we just sat around, being dumb, and hanging out. Then Annie mentioned calling Alex so we called Alex and he was like, "Where are you at? We'll be there in a few." So Alex, Jeremy, and Dominik came over Annie's. They took Carly and Annie's little brother for a ride around the block so yeah. I wasn't in the car so I don't know how that went. Later, they left and I went home to shower and get my stuff because I was gonna sleep over and then we were all gonna go to the beach in the morning. So I get there again and Alex, Dominik, Sam, and Jeremy are all there. I was caught off guard. They went to Wendy's for a minute and came back to eat. They stayed for awhile after that. Yeah. Some things happened. I was a little stressed out over one thing because I felt something was  blown way out of proportion.  And I pretty much became uncomfortable. I tried calling Katie but she wasn't home so I was pretty much ready to  bawl my eyes out  but then Chris came over so I didn't. I was miserable and confused for a lot of the night. Then some how I became  "me"  again and was asking stupid questions such as " Are a boner and being hard the same thing?  Because I think they are but I'm just asking" and beating Chris up. We were talking about masturbating and all that have fun stuff. We were pretty much harassing Chris with dumb questions. Then Mrs. Laboda came to pick him up and we all ended up in her van listening to music and talking. Tracy looked at a Kleenex box and thought it was donuts and everyone was like, "Whoa...donuts." Well, everyone except for me. You know me, my diet. So then this idea of going to get donuts popped in our heads. It was like 1am but we all left to go to Dunkin Donuts. Well, let's just say there was  a whole lot of drama  surrounding that issue and in the end, we didn't get any donuts.  Or anything else for that matter.  Carly straight up flipped at us and we weren't really fighting but she wasn't talking to us. So Carly slept in the living room that night. The rest of us stayed up til god knows when but we were pretty much bouncing off the walls. We were eating junk, Tracy and I were trying to read Tom Sawyer but that wasn't working out for me so I quit, and just being retarded. I slowly became tired and then we all went to bed. It was a bitch! I slept in the bed with Annie and we had to share a blanket because Reea and Tracy needed the other so we had to share. And let's just say, Annie was cold last night and I didn't get too much of the blanket. I just remembered some of my dream from last night but it's hard to explain so don't worry about it.      Today I woke up around 9:30. Yes, 9:30.  No, I'm not crazy.  I was going to the beach. So we all got up and got ready. I didn't wanna burn my back even more so I actually put sun screen on it for once. Alex told us to call him before we left for the beach so I did. At first he said he didn't think he had a car but then he called back to say he was going. So yeah. The beach.  I love the beach.  We played a lot of volleyball and swam and we went to the pier. Then Alex, Dominik, and Jeremy came up there. They were playing football and we wanted to eat so we just watched them for a little bit and then went and played with them. Everyone else went in the water but me and Alex just stayed out and played "soccer" for a little bit. It was with a volleyball so it wasn't really soccer but whatever. Then we all started playing a volleyball game. I was disappointed that I was on Carly's team. LoL!  I love her  but the girl doesn't pay attention sometimes. So blah, blah, blah. Eventually they left and we made friends with two guys (one of whom was really cute) and were talking to them and playing football in the water. Oh yeah, I can't believe I forgot.  My foot.  My foot was still hurting me. I think the worst it's ever hurt. I was on  the verge of tears  at that point. It hurt like a bitch just to walk on it. So yeah, it continued throughout the whole day and even now it still hurts. Any who. Tim and Machy were their names. Tim I guess was 19, although I don't believe it. He was the  hot  one. Machy was 6 and sweet. Machy goes to Fairport Harbor for school. The one team we actually beat for track this year!  Go us!  We were talking about drinking and things and they invited us to their friends part for that night. We all knew we wouldn't go but it was cool to be invited. So yeah. We tanned, played volleyball, had a pretty good time. By the way, I got Tim and Machy's numbers. LoL. I'm not exactly sure why I did but people wanted me to so I did. We were   there for like 6 hours! So we went back to Annie's, got our stuff, and went home. I came home, unpacked, sorta cleaned my room, took a shower, and got ready for soccer. I wasn't going to be running so I was like yeah, I'll just shower now. So then I went to soccer. We just patched the field and crap. But then I talked to the coach about my foot. See, I was going to go see my doctor but he told me to go see the trainer for the football team since she's a "sports" doctor. I just hope it feels better really soon because I have a scrimmage against South  on Thursday ! Then they were playing keep away so I left. Annie, Carly, and Ree were at Chris' and wanted me to go but I wasn't sure if I wanted to or not. In the end, I went at 10ish. Alex came and took us to Wendy's. All Carly there. Then we were just chilling for awhile and left to go to Taco Bell and then he dropped us all off. And now I'm here. I'm skipping a lot of things because I'm sooo super tired and I have to get up around 8 and I'm out. There's a lot more but whatever. That can wait.    By the way, guys have some weird obsession with Taco Bell.

       Wow...I just finished reading my brother's website and gosh... Obviously, I know we're brother and sister...we've gone through everything together. But it's crazy because he feels the same way I do about our family. The less we see of them, the less we care. And it's really strange for my brother to say that or talk about growing up and everything else he was writing about. I guess the thing that separates me from my brother is that  I have hope.  Hope that everything will one day be as good as it was. Hell, I know my parents are never gonna get back together. But that doesn't mean I can't pray every night that my mom allows us to see my dad or the rest of my family. Like I was telling Maura, once I'm 16 and I can drive, I'm not gonna be hanging out w/ my friends every chance I get.  I'm gonna be with my family.  Hanging out w/ Katie and going to see my dad. Catching up on all the years I lost. I mean when it comes down to it, family means a lot. I used to think I didn't need any of my family. Boy was I wrong. There's something about losing the ones you loved for years and wondering what you did wrong that they don't wanna be in your life, that's makes you realize,  you do need them!  7 years is a really long time and let me tell you...I cried a lot during those 7 years. I was angry at the beginning and didn't care but then, as I got older, I looked at the "big" picture. And I realized I was angry because he wasn't there. I missed him and wanted him and loved him and needed him to be there for me. I feel the farthest from my dad compared to Eddie and Margaret. I mean Margaret lived with him for 2 years (when she was 16-18) and Eddie had a longer time with him than I did. I mean I was 6 when my parents got divorced. How was I suppose to have a solid relationship with my dad then? My parents are two completely different people and I love them both. Despite major flaws. I forgive but I don't forget. I guess part of me is scared to face reality. I honestly don't know if my dad has fixed his drinking problem. Both times I saw him he just kept throwing back beers but he didn't seem fazed by them... I dunno, my dad is a sensitive subject with me. Forgetting all the bad crap,  he really was a great dad.  And, here I am crying over him again, because I want to be his little girl again. I still wonder if he'll be at my graduation or if he'll see me go to Prom. I just wanna know if he's gonna be there for me. I just wanna know for sure so I can stop killing myself worrying about this. I just want to be make everything better. I just want to be a happy family again...

       It's funny how often I change my mood. I feel stupid when I look back at my "depressing" posts but I guess it's just life. People have mood swings. Any who, I went to bed around 2ish. Once again early. I didn't cry myself to sleep but it did take awhile to actually fall asleep. My mom woke me up around noonish so we could paint the other windowstill. So I changed and started painting. Usually I enjoy painting but today it was just like why the fuck am I doing this? I was doing a half ass job and my mom was like, "Wow Lauren, you're doing a great job." I got white paint all over the blue walls but I really didn't care. I just wanted it to be over with. And somehow I got the paint over my calves. Which didn't make sense because I was wearing pants and I didn't roll them up or anything. So yeah that was fun.  Not really.  Then I just sorta sat online and tried calling people. But no one was home or wouldn't answer theirs cells so I was starting to get pissed. I really needed to talk to Maura too! And pretty much everyone else that I called. So yeah, eventually Alecia called and I thought it was Julia and I was like, "This is Julia right?" And all I hear is Alecia flipping out!  Oops!  I felt bad! I love Alecia w/ all my heart! And half of hers!! LoL! So Alecia and I talked for awhile, pretty much about my "situation" and all that. God, I love talking to Alecia. She always cheers me up. So then I called Julia and that was fun in itself. I haven't talked to her in forever other than online. So we were talking about what's been going on with each other's lives and my mom's sex talk with me and strawberry flavored condoms and keeping my pants on and all that fun stuff. So then I was on the phone with Alecia again and Dave came home from work. So him and Eddie had to go wherever with the motorcycle to get new tires. Then came the fun part of the night. Getting Dave to okay me to go get ice cream and hanging out with Alex. It's funny how protective the men in my life are. Well really, my real dad isn't protective, he's trusting very trusting and open towards me b  ut we're not talking about him. I was just kinda smiling at him and he's like, "Don't tell me anything about that Alex kid coming to pick you up." Despite his IQ, he's pretty good at reading people. And I just started rambling and he's like, "Call your mother." So I'm like, "Mom's gonna be totally fine with it. You're the one I need permission from!" So eventually I talked to my mom and she just like why'd you call me for this? Dave wasn't too happy with the idea but there wasn't much he could do about it   and when Eddie found out, he looked like he was ready to have a heartattack. He started asking me a bunch of questions.   Aww, the baby sis is growing up! So I went to go get ready and Eddie left to go somewhere and Magaret came home. When Eddie got home,  all  I was wearing was boxers and a tshirt and I went to go outside and Eddie looks at me and says, "You're not wearing   that   are you?" I'm like, "Yeah Eddie...hell no!" So then I got ready and tried calling Tina but she wouldn't answer her celly. I talked to Maura so I was happy. As I was getting ready, I got this really sharp pain in my side. It was really weird. It just came out of no where and hurt like a bitch.   But I took whatever and I felt better. (happy face) So I finished getting ready and Eddie tried giving me a lecture. I do have to give him props for taking over the dad position all my life though. I didn't get bitchy about it or anything, I understood why he was saying what he was saying so I just agreed. So Alex came and picked me up and we went to Cold Stone for ice cream. While we were there, I found out  Lauren  is the  number 1 hoochie name.  I was like WTF? It's quite funny though. Oh! And congrats go out to Gretchen's Aunt Kandy on having her healthy baby girl on August 4th. 6 pounds and 11 ounces. And guess what her name is?  Lauren  Ann. Aww... Now that's gonna be a hell of a baby. OMG. Rick James died today. : /  Yes, Rick James is dead bitch.  My bro told me that some radio station was playing a voice clip of the actual Rick James saying, "I'm dead bitch." and whoever was called number X won a DVD of Dave Chapelle Uncensored. Kinda weird for a radio station to do that once someone dies, ya know? So Alex and I got ice cream and went back to his house to watch Billy Madison. It was cool. I love that movie. Adam Sandler is hilarious. Then I came home and tried calling Annie and Maura because they both told me to call them once I got home. Annie was a dumbass for that   because it was like 11:20 and her dad answered and I was like damn it and she wasn't even home. So I called her cell. Then I called Maura. She said she'd be online later but she isn't. Oh well. So I cleaned my room. *clean freak* I expected everyone to be home but Margaret was the only one home. And she was passed out on the couch. Eddie and Dave were both out and my mom was still at work so it was good to be able to "breath" ya know? So I ate and read Tom Sawyer some. It's pretty good. And the questions are so straight forward. With Lord of the Flies, the answers weren't right there, you had to "search" for them. So, yeah, everything's good. I'm happy, other than the fact that I  really  miss my dad and wanna see my McGrath family. Chris isn't coming up this weekend like I thought because his plans changed but he is gonna be up next weekend so we're gonna hang then. I'm probably gonna call Katie tomorrow, I was gonna call her tonight but it was after midnight so I didn't. She was online so I was talking to her and she said she was gonna call me once she got off but we talked online instead. Eddie was talking about how   my cousin Matt is pretty much depressed. And I feel terrible. Matt is like my bro. I tell him a lot of shit.   The boy is 16 and all he does is work. I mean he has a hell of a lot of money but that doesn't replace never seeing your friends or family. And my other cousin Tim is partying it up in Canada for awhile so yeah. Well, I'm gonna go try to write and look up some quotes. I'll post a poem tomorrow, I don't feel like looking through them right now. Night night~

       [ BIG  sigh] I'm not really happy right now but I'll get to that later. I went to bed surprisingly early at around 2. I tried watching American Wedding but my DVD player was being gay and didn't wanna play it. I was too lazy to go downstairs to Margaret's room and use her DVD player. She was on her way home so she probably wouldn't have wanted me in her room watching a DVD anyways. I was  really  upset with her though. I talked to her around 5ish yesterday and she said she'd be home between 8-9 for us to watch Uptown Girls. Well, finally  at 11  when she wasn't home yet, I called her and she told me  she fell asleep  at Kevin's. (her boyfriend's) I figured but it was just like, "What's new? I'm used to you blowing me off." I was gonna try to do these ab things but I didn't wanna wake my mom up. My mom was the one who gave me the magazine with the work out in it in the first place. I dunno why she did it though. Whenever I complain about myself, she always yells at me and says I'm beautiful the way I am. Well, geez.  I wish I felt beautiful.  Or I wish   someone else   could do that for me. So I just gave up and went to bed. It took me awhile to go to sleep because I had a lot on my mind. I  still  have a lot on my mind. I got up around 1:30 and painted the trim around my window with my mom. Then as I was getting dressed, I stepped in the paint stirrer thing so that was just great. I had a   blue   foot. Just after that I was in the kitchen with Eddie. I went to go give him a hug and he put me in a headlock. So I started pinching his sides and he didn't mean to but he jabbed his watch into my mouth. He let me go and I went to go look in the mirror. I saw my gums were bleeding but I was cool with it. I went to tell Eddie that my gums were bleeding and he's like, "Maybe you shouldn't brush your teeth so hard then..." He was just being a smartass but I still love him! After that I went down the street and delivered some pictures to people for Mrs. Laboda. Hey, easy work and I get a service hour for it. I came home, read CH 5 of Tom Sawyer, and then started reading Cosmogirl. So I decided to eat something before soccer. Eddie wanted to eat before work too so we just ended up eating together. As usual, I was just talking aimlessly and Eddie shakes his head and says, "I just wanted to relax and have everything silent before work." And I say, "Then why'd you eat w/ me? You know I don't shut up." So we just joked around and he left for work. I got ready for soccer and left. I went to the high school because that's where practice was (at least I was told that) but no one was there. So I started getting my panic attack feelings and I went to Orlando.  Luckily , everyone was there. So I started to breath easier. But then I realized I was the  only  girl. And the panic came back. If Cody wasn't so nice and easy to talk to I would have just stood off to the side by  myself  and not talked to anyone. Eventually, Carly and Nikki both came so that was good. Mr. Willis wasn't there for awhile but when he got there, he didn't say anything to us and just sat on a swing. It was strange. Then we ran our warm up lap, stretched, and did three on a ball. For some reason, it wasn't that hard today. But I felt like I couldn't sprint. It felt like I was just jogging but I was running my hardest. Next, we found out that there was some  random  guy in the parking lot with papers in his lap,  just watching us.  So we couldn't touch the balls because it would have been illegal and we all would have gotten into  a lot  of trouble I guess. So we couldn't scrimmage or anything with the ball. Then we had a little chat. We talked about the levying failing and the rules that had changed and all that fun stuff. Practice ended early but I stayed with most of the team to scrimmage and mess around. It kinda sucked because  I wasn't even picked  for a team. They threw me on a team. And then I know the two guys were saying shit about me because they kept saying "she" and looking at me. Ah. It sucks. I feel so  worthless  sometimes. Sometimes I just wonder  why I even try in the first place...  There's no point. After most of the people left, we played World Cup. In the beginning it sucked because I had no one to be on a team with, so I asked Lucas to be my partner and he wouldn't answer me. He had no partner either! And everyone else was paired up so it was like WTF? Why can't you just be my partner? I'm starting to not like him very much. Towards the end of World Cup it got better. I was doing better. I even scored. And it was a good kick if I do say so myself. (happy face) But then Matt stepped on my foot. The foot that has been hurting like a mother for the past week. It's strange. It's just the top of my foot. It hurts when I walk and even sometimes when I'm not moving it at all. But it's hurt even more when I run. So after Matt stepping on it, it was pretty numb. And then Nick or Anthony ( I CAN'T TELL EM APART!)  kicked it. So that was just great. A little later Alex came to give Carly, Dominik, and me a ride home since he got his license. I came home and talked to Margaret about my foot and she said it looked swollen. (sad face) Then she said, "That's what happened to me. I fractured two bones in the top of my foot. I had to wear one of those crazy shoes and I could  never  run again. It hurt too much to." She was like  a star  cross country girl. So me being  the worrier I am , I began to freak out. If I had to stop running all together, I'd go crazy. Not being able to play soccer  would kill me.  So that lead me to lock myself in the bathroom and cry for a little bit. Among other things. I kept hinting towards Margaret that I wanted to talk about  "it"  but she was too busy to pay attention. I was dropping clues all night but she never picked up on them. So I'm just gonna talk to Maura about it all tomorrow. While I was at soccer, I talked to Margaret and she asked me if it was okay if Kevin joined in on the  girls'  night. I  acted  like I was totally fine with it but it upset me. I wanted to hang out  with her  and watch a movie  with her.  Not with Kevin too. Don't get me wrong. I love Kevin. It's just I love my sister too and sometimes I like to spend quality alone time with her. Which we haven't done in a  long, long time.  So the three of us ended up watching it. The two of them cuddled up on the couch and me  all alone  on the other one. That's what  killed  me. Seeing the two of them snuggling up together,  so happy.  All I want is that. I  just want to be in love and have someone love me again.  I mean, is that so much to ask? I'm a very impatient girl so don't tell me, eventually I'll find the one. I know that, I just wish he'd hurry up already. Uptown Girls, it was cute. But I didn't really like it. It just  ended . No explanation. Nothing. I don't like those kind of things that don't explain the endings. Then I came upstairs and showered. I feel like crap. I have a terrible headache. My tummy hurts. All I hate today was fruit loops for breakfast, some taco crap before soccer, a muffin, and some rice when I got home. Okay, so I ate like a half a bag of chips, it's not healthy... I didn't even to my crunches today because I've been so blah. There's nothing to do online and no one is really on to talk to so I guess I'm gonna go to bed. It's gonna take me  a long time  to fall asleep.  I might cry  my way to sleep or I might now. Right now, I'm leaning towards it. But just let me remind you, I have the hardest time trying to sleep when I have  all these thoughts running through my head...  One last thought: Figure out what you want because I don't like playing your games. You should know who you are. Good night~      P.S. I wish I would have went to PA for the week. God, it would have been better than dealing with this shit...

       Last night was a disaster in itself. I was miserable and then happy again. I finally went to bed around 4:30. I eventually got up around 1ish this afternoon. Ate, went online, read Tom Sawyer...all that fun stuff. Tom Sawyer isn't that bad but I'd rather be reading other books. You know what I mean? I didn't really do anything today. I still have to do my crunches. I'm waiting for Margaret to get home so we can watch Uptown Girls. At 10, I'm gonna watch Newlyweds and the Ashlee Simpson show. Exciting life don't ya think? I'm kinda disappointed that it's the last espoidse of the Ashlee Simpson show. I really liked it. But oh well. I guess all good things eventually end, right? I feel like shit. I dunno why. I keep getting really cold and then really warm. My head feels like everything is moving around. My throat is sore. Not as bad as the last few days though so that's good. My chest is a little tight so my breathing is just a little difficult. Uh, I wanna eat but I'm not even hungry. My mom got this ice cream with cake chunks and sprinkles, it seems good and I wanna try it but it's like I have no cravings. And it's like the last day I can eat junk food so I should eat it! And I'm so confused about this one situation. Maura knows exactly what I'm talking about. One minute everything is good and the next everything is about someone else. I know I'm not making sense. But let's just put it this way,  I don't like playing games!  I might write later. I'll put in a poem sometime soon. I'm out~

       Well, I talked things out. I think I overreacted  a lot.  I solved the main cause of my pain so that's good. It's just the minor ones I need to work out now. Or just ignore them because the one person is just gonna babble and not make sense and the other person, well he already cleared shit up but it's still just strange to me. Sorry guys, I don't like using names. I would explain more but I can't. And I can't just change names because the person would know if it was about them or not. But I have faith again. I didn't do anything stupid. I worked on my communication skills.  And I'm happy again! WHOA!  I'm very proud of myself for this all. YAY! Talk to you all tomorrow. It's funny how I'm back to normal after crying all night. Alex told me I'm just a teenage girl so I guess it all makes sense. But it would have been funnier if I was PMSing...Oh well! Sweet dreams~

       Yeah, I really do. I  was  happy. I  was .  Then tonight happened.  All this shit just popped out of  nowhere.  I've been bawling my eyes out  for hours.  When am I gonna run out of tears? Will I  ever ? I'm  sooo  sick of pretending. I'm  so  sick of acting like I don't care. You have  no idea  how the fuck I feel right now. Earlier today I was sitting in my room  smiling  to myself over life. Smiling to myself because everything was  PERFECT.  Then everything  fell to pieces  in front of my eyes. I wanna die. I  feel like I am  anyways. And this fucking blog is a reason in this all. Two times tonight it led to things I didn't want it to lead to. And ya know what? Don't say you're gonna be there  if you're not.   I don't need to have my hopes up only to come crashing down.  You don't know  how bad  I wanna talk to you about this. You have  no idea  how you made me feel. You have  no clue  how bad my heart is hurting... I dunno what else to say. If you ask me what's wrong, I'm not gonna explain so don't even say it.  And no, you don't understand...

       A few late night updates. Number one. See, my mom's mom (so my grandma) died when my mom was  three.  Then my grandpa got remarried to  some bitch  (seriously) and she became my mom's step mother. She also died. When my mom was sixteen. So when my mom started working at this restaurant when she about sixteen she met this older woman who was  amazing.  I don't know all the details but almost forty years later that woman is still in my mother and my life. Her name is Rosie. My mom always called Rosie  "mom"  and Rosie always looked out for my mom. She's always been really close to my family so I think of her as my grandma or something like that. But recently Rosie's husband found our he has like  three different cancers.  And it's freaking horrible. He has like liver, lung, and heart cancer. I know lung cancer for sure but the two I'm weary on. I saw them a few weeks ago and George looked awesome. And I was relieved in a sense. But today Rosie called and said  George is in the hospital  and I'm just upset because it sucks. Number two. Yesterday when I went to the library we rented a bunch of DVD's. I decided to get What a Girl Wants with Amanda Bynes because I wanted to see it when it came out but never did and thought what the heck. So tonight I decided to watch it since there was nothing else to do. I thought it was gonna be corny but I was sooo wrong. It is now  one of my favorite  movies. I cried  so  much! The movie was so awesome. And I understood what the main character (Amanda) went through with always wondering if she'd be able to dance with her dance at her wedding.  Like I dunno how many nights I cried myself to sleep wondering if my dad was ever gonna see me before Prom or be at my graduation.  Although my dad is back in my life, it's not like the movie where the parents get back together. Despite everything and forgetting the reasons my parents got divorced,  part of me has always wished they'd get back together.  Just so we could all be happy again, ya know? But it's for the best that they are apart. And it was crazy! Just the other day, Jules sent me all these quotes and she sent me one that made so much sense that I fell in love with it.  "Why are you trying to fit in when you were born to stand out?"  I think that I was born to stand out.  All my life  I've tried fitting in and everything like that but for some reason,  none of it felt right.  So I guess I sorta live my that quote now since I feel it describes how I feel so perfectly. So as I'm watching the movie Amanda is on a date with some very cute and super sweet boy she met. And they're laying in the boat as the boy asks Amanda,  "Why are you trying so hard to fit in when you were born to stand out?"  I was like, "WTF?!" That's fucking awesome! My new favorite quote is in my favorite movie! So that made me love the movie even more. And oh my lord! It was so cute. The whole relationship with Amanda and the kid in the movie was totally "awe" worthy. Number three. I hate it how people have to say certain things that upset you but they don't even know it. Like this person said all this shit to me and  acted like I was suppose to be the happiest person in the world.  But in reality, the crap they said,  pretty much made me cry.  It was just like,  "Why now? Why? I don't understand..."  And then I tried to talk to someone about it and he just said "oh" and the other person I wanna talk to, I can't. So right now I'm just really confused and in need of talking to  one  person...I hate it. Whenever I need someone, they're not there or don't even try...And then they wonder why...

       So last night my cousin, Katie signed online and we were talking. See, the last time I saw her was  in January  so it's good when we talk online. I'm just a few months older than her so in reality, we're  really close.  I was telling her how I was confused about stuff and we were talking about it. She said she had to go but for me to call her. I was like OMG! Yes! My mom doesn't want me to see or talk to my my dad's side of the family other than three of my cousins who I'm also super close with. So my mom has no idea I hung out w/ Katie and other members of my family. I was extremely happy to talk to her though. We were discussing my problems, talking about our grandma moving up to Ohio, our sports, music, boys, Ashlee Simpson! LoL, it's so amazing.  We're really alike.  She loves Ashlee Simpson too. But it's also kinda depressing. I just found out her sister so my cousin,  Jen is engaged!  It's just like...wow. She's the first kid of the family to get married so I guess it's pretty big for us all. Katie was talking about going dress shopping with Jen and Meghan (other sister/cousin) today and  how she wished I could go with them.  Yeah, I wish I could too. It's so hard lying to my mom about this all but I mean, it's for the best. My mom wouldn't allow me to see them if she knew so the only way I can see my family  is to lie.  Don't get me wrong.  I hate doing it.  And it's not the easiest thing in the world. It's quite difficult because  my mom always knows everything.  Anyways, that made me cheery. So then I went online and talked to people til 2ish. I went to bed by 3 am and woke up around 9ish to get ready to go to my Grandpa's. So I ate, got ready, and we left to go get Kevin. Eddie and Kevin painted. And guess what I did?!  I WASHED MY GRANDPA'S CAR ALL BY MYSELF!  He asked me to clean his back window because he couldn't see out of it and I realized the car was really dirty so I offered to wash it. At first he said it'd be too much work but Eddie just pulled the car out of the garage and I started.  I've never done that before.  So it was cool. I got really dirty and wet but it was all good. He paid me in the end so that's always nice. My grandpa is  loaded . Like seriously. He retired from GE before I was born and still gets paid!!! A good amount too! So then we left to go home. I tried to read some Tom Sawyer but I went online. Then I read some more Tom Sawyer and ended up falling asleep on the couch. During this time,  my mom took pictures of me  so I can't wait to see those. Once I woke up, I went back online for a minute and went to read some more. I wouldn't say Tom Sawyer is good but I think it's funny. Just like the stuff that happens.  So I'm liking this book so far.  It's sure as hell better than LOTF.  A lot  better. Then I ate dinner. Recently, my sister and mom have been using  sexual references  to talk about things and I've been thinking, "Oh lord..." So tonight at dinner it was no different. But this time we started talking about their first times and everything and let's just say it was a little  too  much. My sister said something as I was chewing my salad and I started choking! I couldn't stop laughing and then I started crying because it was so funny. Oh well. My family is out there! But I love them despite it all. And now I'm here. I just wanted to clue you guys in on stuff! ; ) So now I'm gonna go watch a DVD so talk to you guys later. By the way, 21 days/3 weeks, until school starts... good or bad?  Mixture. I'll explain later! muah~

       I'm just in this super great mood today. I'm not just happy,  it's more than that.  Surprisingly, I went to bed  early  last night. I went online around 2 am and Carly was like the only person online so we chatted for a bit and she went to bed. So I got bored and went to bed too. At that time it was like a quarter to three. My mom came and woke me up at like 9. It was hell. I didn't wanna get up at all. And  my body hurt like a bitch  so I was having trouble moving around, sitting, and what not. I ate, got ready, and left to go to the mall and other places with my sister and my mom. OMG! My hair is  really light.  I started using Sun-In like a week ago and it's already made my hair super lighter than what it was. First, the three of us went to the library because my mom needed to return some books and get some more and I had to get Tom Sawyer to read. I wasn't too excited about that. I didn't know where to look so I asked a lady for help. She led me into the  children's section  as I was thinking to myself,  "Why would a kid wanna read Tom Sawyer?"  She found it and I walked away once I thanked her. A few minutes later I was looking through the book  only to find extremely large print and pictures.  That's when I realized it was an adapted version. So I had to go back and ask her to help me find the real copy. She looked but said they didn't have any. I got pissed and my mom was looking through the adult section for it. In the end, she wound up finding it. So that's good. I haven't started it yet. Everyone says it's really boring so I can't wait. My mom got the Da Vinci Code and Gretchen suggested I read it so I'm gonna read that once I finish Tom Sawyer and the other book I started a few days ago. It seems good. It's a murder mystery I guess.  It's just really long.  If you haven't realized, I love reading. I ended up getting some movies too so it's all good. After that, we went to the mall. All I got was " panties " (Margaret always calls them that so I thought I'd try it. I like "underwear" better) from Victoria's Secret and lunch at that chicken place.  It was really good.  Margaret and I were like totally crazy today. We were  trying the underwear on over our clothes  so see if it'd fit and just acting completely stupid. Oh well, it was fun and it was a real womanly bonding day. I came home and Annie called so I called her back. I was gonna ask her to come over but she called me and asked me to go over her house so I was like whatever.  I was all pimped out in a Papa Joe's Subs t-shirt and athletic sports. I was one sexy bitch!  LoL. But I did look cute! I was only wearing baggy clothes because it made my sun burn feel even worse if tight clothes were rubbing against it. So I went to her house and we chilled. Tracy came over a little later. They were gonna go up to Orlando but I didn't feel up to it so I just went home. It was nice because Tracy said, "Well we want you to go." On my way home I saw my soccer coach and I was like shit! Then he told me I shouldn't be walking, I should be running and I was like I was seriously gonna do it but I think I'm getting my shin splints back so I'm giving them a break. Seriously. My shins hurt soo bad. LoL, so here I am. Talking online. I'm gonna go watch Road Rules at ten so I'll be back later! muah~

       Oh yeah. I got a   fourth   bad comment last night. Actually, it didn't piss me off or anything.  I was laughing.  The person said I should talk about my life.  Uh, hello?  That's what I do, is it not? Maybe it's just because you don't know me so you can't read inbetween the lines. But I know I talk about my problems for sure. Like I said before, if you have a problem with it,  no one is making you read this.  Carly, thank you very much for backing me up. And whoever left a comment after Car, thanks to you too. See, that person thinks I talk about my problems too. Alrite, get ready, because this is gonna be one hell of a post. Last night I went to bed at 4:30ish and Dave (my step dad) woke me up at 9ish to ask if I wanted to go to the beach. I told my mom last night that I'd go so I told Dave and he said I could sleep til 10. So I finally got up around 10 with a lot of trouble.  I just wanted to sleep.  So I got up, ate, got ready, and left. It was crazy because for the first time in  a while , my whole family was up by 10. We're the type of family who stays up all night and sleeps all afternoon. When we first got to the beach, there weren't many people so it was nice. Last time I went to the beach, it was like the 3rd of July, I got  burnt   sooo  bad.  I was even better than the Coppertone kid!  So today, I actually put on sun screen. That's something new for me. I know it's really bad that I usually don't wear any but  sometimes you just don't care.  I was gonna try to put it on before we left (like you're supposed to so it has time to absorb into your skin) but my parents wanted to leave so I had to wait til I got to the beach. After that, I went to look for water glass with my mom. She's like crazy for that stuff so every time I go to the beach, I look for a bunch and give her what I find. She gets all  happy .  I  used  to be like that.  In like 2nd or 3rd grade  I had some phase I went through.  I was like crazy about rocks.  They were so fascinating to me.  But I guess I just grew out of it. Although, I still find some pleasure in looking for water glass and other strange rocks. After awhile, I got tired so I went to lay down and tan for a bit. I guess I fell asleep because I remembered having a dream that seemed soo real but my parents came back (they went on a walk to look for some water glass and rocks) and were like, "Maybe you should turn?"  It brought me back to reality.  The beach seemed so  unreal  when I was first waking up. It was like the beach was the dream. But it was the opposite. I wish I could remember that dream. It felt so weird. And I haven't had a dream that felt so real for a few months. So I switched sides and once again fell asleep. But I didn't have a dream that time. I ended up getting up and looking for more water glass with my mom. Ya wanna know something I've always wanted to do? I always wanted to walk the  whole  beach. Like from one end to the other. I think it'd be really cool, especially if I went with a guy.   Romantic?   I say. Every time I go to the beach,  I get disappointed.  There are  never  any cute guys. And if I do get hit on, it's by  younger  kids. It's like,  where are the hot guys  and  what's wrong with me that the little ones hit on me?  So I didn't think I got too burnt. Turns out, I was wrong.  Very wrong.  The back of my legs are all burnt, the bottom of my back, part of my top, my chest, my tummy...  All burnt.  Oh well, it doesn't hurt.   Yet.   I came home and called Kristina to see if she wanted me to give her LOTF and if she wanted to hang out for a little bit but I forgot she went to Splash Lagoon with the twins.  So I was pretty bummed about that.  Then I took a walk down the street because I had to deliver something for Mrs. Laboda but the people weren't home so I'll just try again tomorrow. Then I came home, cleaned and did some crunches. If you didn't realize, I clean  a lot.  I'm pretty much a clean freak. I say my room is a mess if I have  a few  things of clothes out of place. I know, I'm  very  anal about my room. After that, I went online and talked to people. Julia sent me a bunch of quotes so that was cool.  I'm quote crazy.  I seriously think they're amazing. I've been a little confused lately because I think I like someone but that's what my head is telling me.  My heart isn't.  My heart is telling me to like someone else. So I don't know what to do or even how I really feel. I read something where it said to try to solve your problems  in the back of your mind.  Meaning, don't make them your priority. Because, eventually,  everything will be solved.  I believe that, so that's what I'm trying to do. But it's weird.  For the first time in awhile, it just feels good to be me. To be single, to be alone, to think clearly, to breath freely. It felt as if I was trapped before.  If I have to write a paper once I get back to school about what I did this summer, I know exactly what I'm gonna say.  "It's more what I  didn't  do this summer."  I seriously thought this was gonna be  the  summer. Where I was out partying every night, never home, always with my friends. But it's almost the complete  opposite.  It was like that in the beginning but then things just changed. At first I was upset about it all but  now I take it all as a   blessing.  Like when was the last time I've had  more than a month to do whatever I wanted?  To sit around reading all day, to sleep in, to give my face a break from all the make up, to give me hair a break from all that styling? It feels so good. And I think because of this,  I'm happy.   I've kind of found part of me I lost awhile back.  So then I got ready for soccer. I was waiting for practice all day. I wanted to see if all that conditioning was gonna help my game. When I got there, we were taking shots on the goal but I wasn't in the mood so I just talked to Nicole. After that, we did our warm up lap and stretched. Next, we did three on a ball. Which is weird because it was Sunday and we do that on Wednesday's. Oh well. So I was doing alright. It was really hot though. So we got to the ball dribbling part. Instead of waiting to go as a team like we usually do, everyone was just going when they got the ball. Lucas was going really slow so I was the last one to get the ball. I'm not too clear on what happened but I was dribbling and I was the last one and I guess the rest of the team was waiting for me and  I just tripped.  Quite embarrassing  but I was laughing.  So it was all good. I fell a lot today. Not little trips. But   BOOM   falls where I got grass strains on my shirt and I rolled over a bunch. I think conditioning did help my game. I think I was doing pretty well. Then there was some drama with Matt and coach and we had to stop scrimmaging and all listen and stuff. What Matt was saying, pissed me off, and I think the majority of the team. And I just thought it was ridiculous that he was acting so immature and freaking out over nothing. Then we started scrimmaging again. Soon it was time to go so we were all talking and I guess we don't have conditioning this week. I'm torn on whether that's good or not.  Like part of me wants to go because it was such a great work out and the other lazy half of me is glad to have a break.  So we have soccer Thursday. Although having practicing today and Thursday is  illegal.  I don't know why. It's just some state law that says you can't practice the first week of August. Oh well. I already break enough laws, what's wrong with adding a few more? So Eddie came and picked me up and we went home. My mom didn't make dinner because she wasn't in the mood so we got McDonald's.  I was craving my Big Mac soo bad.  So I started getting my food when Eddie called me in his room to see some pictures of his car. I didn't want to because I wanted to eat and I didn't wanna just leave my food on the table unprotected. My dogs have a tendency to get up on the table and steal food.  I know, bad dogs.  But I still went in his room thinking it'd be okay. I mean, there's been so many times where my dogs didn't steal my food. But  go figure  as we're looking at pictures, you hear something fall. You all know what's coming. Rascal (my newest and  most evil  dog) pulled my Big Mac down on the floor and started to eat it.  At that point, I lost it.  I went crazy. I started screaming at the dog. Screaming at my brother.  Just being a huge drama queen and bitch.  But I mean haven't you guys ever experienced a time when you wanted something so bad but somehow it got screwed up and you didn't? Well, that's how I felt.  All I wanted was that damn Big Mac.  But I couldn't eat it anymore.  I was on the verge of tears . I know that's very dramatic but I think I get overly sensitive and emotional when I'm on my period. I was just pissed after that. All I had left were my fries. And I kind threw half of those on the ground out of anger.  It wasn't a pretty sight.  I was being so mean to Eddie and he was being equally mean back to me and laughing at me. That's what I hate. When I throw those kind of fits,  he just laughs at me.  And he makes it worse if he didn't realize. The best thing to do is just agree with me and give me a hug. So then I took my fries and went into my room to blast Ashlee Simpson. I finally have her back! ha ha. I gave Carly my CD Thursday night so she could burn it and then we ended up not having practice til tonight so I was lonely with out her. Ya know what else really bugs me? This is my website and I can write whatever I want.  But in a way, I can't.  I know certain people read this on a daily basis so it sorta prevents me from writing some specific events that occur. Like in the past week, I've kept  so much  from you guys. And  it's driving me crazy  because I can't write about it so I have to talk to my one of my friends about it. Whatever.  You didn't think I was gonna tell you everything anyways right?  Ya wanna know something else that bugs me?   urlLink  www.poetry.com    I thought it was some awesome site when I came across it in 6th grade. I posted a bunch of my poems and continued throughout 8th grade. Some of my other friends and family members even came across it too. I always thought it was just a place to post poetry. I didn't know the poetry you posted was being judged and could be published. I didn't know that until I got a letter form them saying that they wanted to publish one of my poems. I was all excited and told my cousin. Surprisingly, he told me how he was once published from them and it was nothing special because they kept sending him stuff.  I refused to lose my happiness over his comments so I didn't think anything of it until later.  I started getting all these emails and letters for conventions and how I was chosen to be  a possible winner of Poet of the Year.  Like part of me still considers this flattering. But now I'm just sick of it all. I think it's just a bunch of bull shit. I haven't posted anything on that site in months but I still get shit for conventions and get letters about how they wanna publish my poems from like 6th grade. I'm sorry, I just think it's not a very good and true website. Oh well, here's a poem. I think it explains itself. It's about giving your heart away and having it broken. Hope you like.      Key   You broke my heart, Yes, you broke it in two. I gave you the key... You opened me up. You took your own hands, And ripped my heart apart. So now I'm lying on the floor, As my breathing is beginning to slow. I shouldn't have given you that key,
