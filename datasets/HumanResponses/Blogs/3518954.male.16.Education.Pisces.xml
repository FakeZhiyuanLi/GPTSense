      I was going to do some extravagant entry today but it seems I have to go to a memorial service for a nice old lady who went on the Cuba trip with us.  Think of this as a small reprieve from posting everyday.  Which I am finding difficult even when my entries are less than a paragraph long... Sigh.

      Today I went to the movies for Chemistry.  We went under the pretense that The Day After Tomorrow (the movie we saw) had enough to do with chemistry to warrant a field trip. The movie was interesting; although forgivably inaccurate (global warming will not cause an ice age) it really was trying to get the message out.  Seeing a Dick Chaney look-alike apologize to the world really warms the heart, and getting out of three classes helped keep the movie good. It had ups (like watching American immigrants fleeing to Mexico) and its downs (they killed Ian Holmes the bastards), still it is fairly good and there are worse things you could do in an hour.  Note that this entry is shaky and has no real point, I am trying to get used to writing everyday and this means a lot of my entries could come out like this until my writing improves a little.  Thanks for bearing with me nonexistent reader.

      If you are reading this it probably means you have input the wrong domain name... Try again they're tricky little buggers domain names... Still reading... Oh.  Well as this is my first blog I guess I should introduce myself.  My name is Adrian I live in Portland Oregon (pronounced OR-eh-GIN you east coast shmucks *ruminates*).  I'm not quite sure why I just started a blog.  I have very strong opinions and such but I tend to be bad at winning arguments.  I doubt I'll be doing much more than posting meaningless stuff at odd hours of the night and well when typing I lose my train of thought so... I may do little short stories and I've always wanted to do a web comic.  I'll probably try to get some deep opinions out and I hope someone will read them.  I suppose I'll get to practice my writing skills.  So here it goes my first blog... Ever... Enjoy ^^  Post script: I might even blog twice today... The second one will probably be more like a journal though.  So think of this as my introduction nonexistent reader.
