      Jessica Broke up with camron last night though he doesnt know yet she told me to tell him but im not going to call him or walk down the street to tell him if hes my friend he shall call than i shall tell him but he cant blame jessica because its his fault he never called her or made efforts to spend time with her or to see her that sounds like his last realationship with mindy what im trying to say is both brakeups are his fault but it seems as always i am stuck in the middle so this is my advice for me friend camron grow the fuck up and be a man and dont blame them for your mistakes!!!!!!!!!!!! As for me today bored as hell waiting to die lol jp but i am bored just sitting here singing songs and downloading away im bout to finally go the fuck home peace yall  TONY BUBEN OUT

      This Poem is A poem from one of my friends who u say im not tellin u   Forgotten Sitting here not intouch with the real world Trying to understand what went wrong Constantly wondering my mistakes What did i do for you to treat ne this way Ever time I told you to go ,Why exactly did u stay? Was it a test to see if Id give in, take all the things I said back and let you win? Inside I feel like giving up I cant take the stress that comes with this love stuff No longer will I sit here wondering what went wrong I will learn from my mistakes and everything I have I will appreciate Sitting here knowing my future and wishing that you'd be gone......... Author  I shall not tell

      Hey this song i like  alot if u dont ohh  well violent j: Ive Lived one hell of a life, if your to take it tonight, Ive lived the life of a king, but so much to darkin my light Shaggy 2 dope: Looking 300 degrees, two hundread thousand desease, how can I lay back and chill, so many down on there knees j: But then who again who am I, Im just one Typical guy, I aint no fuckin hero, I Just been wondering  why..... Chorus: I seen some children crossing the bridge, what kind of life did they get to live? What kind of choice do they get to make, what if it was a childs mistake? J: I'll never question the book, but lets say i lived by the book, i never ate meat on tuesdays, how much bigger would my wings look Shaggs: I try to pray everyday, but sometimes get lost on the way, I seen the holiest spirt, so much to misslead the way J: i gave visions I got, Ive been told im gonna rot, inside the devils intestines, im still holding my spot, Ive just been wondering why..... Chorus: I seen some children crossing the bridge, what kind of life did they get to live? What kind of choice do they get to make, what if it was a childs mistake? Break down: COME ON UP AND OPEN UP YOUR DOOR, WHAT IF ITS A DERAGHTORY DOOR, COME ON UP AND OPEN UP YOUR DOOR, WHAT IF ITS A DERAGHTORY DOOR, fuckin take me instead! Chorus: I seen some children crossing the bridge, what kind of life did they get to live? What kind of choice do they get to make, what if it was a childs mistake? I seen some children crossing the bridge, what kind of life did they get to live? What kind of choice do they get to make, what if it was a childs mistake? I seen some children crossing the bridge, what kind of life did they get to live? What kind of choice do they get to make, what if it was a childs mistake?
