       Last weekend, Saturday night, the 21st of august ... a gathering of D7G (a name we call our drinking squad, reason for which you'll never know unless you become one of us) ... SML, Red Horse, Cuervo and Stolichnaya were the hosts ...  Main event: Anton and I were going to do the Boracay 15 shots in commemoration of the departure of our Los Angeles Chapter, Riza. Yes, this would be mourning in the D7G way ... also with us, Top Gun (identity left unknown for reasons to be seen later on), was attempting to once again battle her way in our alcoholic event and hopefully emerge as the only woman to ever emerge victorious, despite our continous discouragements, ... I quote: "why do you even try?" and "oh well, it was never a sin to dream" ... a quest she began september a year ago, which i presume will be commemorated the upcoming month ...  I personally have never drank 15 shots or more except for the two most drunken nights of my life (or at least never counted that much) ... my first time ... and some inanely insane night PG and I decided to bet shots on a night of billiards ... one shot for the winner, 2 for the loser, 2 per scratch, PER game ... looking back, i laugh at the realization of how stupid we must have been, however, memories like that are engraved forever in time, binding friendship, and are thus, priceless, so that's that (at least that’s my present juistification) ... the funny thing though is, contrary to what expected, after the 15 shots which we made sure we finished in an hour and a half, i was surprisingly alright! … not even a headache, dizziness or pukey-tendency … just a slight giddiness and a stomach ache, … trust me, even i was shocked! It must have been one of those so-called “good days”, but hey, I’ll take it anyway.  and so, born out of such night are these realizations:  1) Anton though vaguely a lookalike of Miguel, is like him when tipsy ~ they both talk to the shotglasses  2) If Helen of Troy could launch a thousand ships with her beauty, "Top Gun" (identity not given) can paralyze 10 men in state of shock and panic when drunk with her fits of crying.  3) Ean can actually lick salt, shoot WATER, &amp; suck a lemon, and actually enjoy it.  4) "Top Gun" shold never drink that much again ...  5) It must be true that regular intake of alcohol does increase your tolerance throughout the years, hence, the 15 shots and still standing ... and still generally alright. There must be truth to that medical term, "accomodation".  6) "Top Gun" should never drink that much again ...  7) Ean LOVES food, as proven by the donut-shaped glob of jelly around his waist, and may one day potentially gobble all of us in one night, emerge as the new godfather of D7G, and potential bring about the apocalype and rule the world, as his voracious appetite and belly exceed all rational explanation when he's hungry. (The Nutty Professor comes to mind ...)  8) Did i say "Top Gun" should never drink that much again ...?  9) Photo-editing and multimedia arts graphic designers can be both great friends or dangerous enemies, as a consequnce of bthe power they hold over the manipulation of photgraphy. (rationale for this is confidential)  10) You actually DO get your yellowcab pizza free if they deliver it later than the time allocated.  11) "Mother Superior" is reallyv our lifesaving mother, and without her, we'd all probably be on the street, naked, alone and helpless.  12) After a moderate intake of alcohol, some people people can actually do handstands and cartwheels, ... while others, can ... "attempt".  13) I can probably go on and on with this list so i'll quit while I'm ahead.   D7G ROCKS!!! Peace Brothas!

       So why did i choose the name "artful dodger" as my domain name anyways people ask ...  this should suffice for the well-minded ...  Taken from the novel by Charles Dickens, "Oliver Twist", on the Artful Dodger:  'The boy was about his age, but one of the queerest-looking fellows Oliver had ever seen. He was snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough, and as dirty as one would wish to see! but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man. He was short of his age, with rather bow legs, and sharp eyes. His hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every moment- and would have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which brought it back to its old place again. He wore a man's coat, which reached nearly to his heels. He had turned the cuffs back, halfway up his arm, to get his hands out of the sleeves, apparently with the ultimate view of thursting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers, for there he kept them. He was altogether as roystering and swaggering young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less, in his shoes.'  Go figure ... Some explanations are better left unspoken ... There is depth in the interpretation of my rationale for this, and such depth will be reflected in the way you perceive it. I leave you with nothing but this piece of original text, and the heaven-born intellect that lies within you. The manner of perception is in your hands. Free your mind.  Use thy wit wisely, for that which leaves thy thought, is but a mere reflection of what lies within your soul.

       And so today, i have finally succumbed to the consequences of the path i have chose to tread, namely one of long-distance love, pressure-filled career, and independent travel through the journey of life, and have resorted to something i told myself i would not ever see myself do ... which is to make a blog... a window into your soul through which you place yourself as prey to the criticism-filled eyes of the world that they may reach in and taste the marrow of your soul to their heart's content. sadistic thought? yes ... but true. And for what purpose i ask myself, well maybe for lack of a mindless project that is self-entertaining, engrossing and maybe for the slight tinge of companionship it gives knowing that i share a part of myself with people i hardly see ... consequence being i share it with the rest of the damn world as well. On the lighter side, its pretty much also for the need to do something unimportant and undemanding on which i can vent out my inhibited artistic frustrations, as everything i do at this point of my life seems to be so imjportant with the impending pressure that "a mistake will change your future". Funny how we find doing thoughts we never thought we'd bring ourselves to do in response to the situations that life puts us in. But such is life, we do what we must ... maybe not only to survive, but also to keep our sanity .. or even, to keep the quality of our existence at a level where fulfillment may still be felt.  As for myself, it has been a very interesting twisting road that has brought me here ... to this moment ... today ... to the very manipulative thought in my subconscious that wrestled with my rationalizing mind and convinced me to begin this. If I narrated my complete life to you, well, ... let's just say ... NO ONE knows everything except that all powerful One who created me ... and i may intend to keep it that way. who knows. all i know is, right now, i find myself in a long distance relationship, after swearing i'd never get in one again, ... i find myself in a career that absolutely utilizes all my weaknesses and none of my strengths ... i find myself with certain, how do i say this, physical conditions that are curable only by my Creator, and that is ironic since I'm in the medical field ... i find myself living alone in an apartment most of the week, when i'm a guy who aptly lives the saying "no man is an island" ...  HOWEVER, ironically, despite all such, i also find myself lying down at night happier about where i am in life and where i'm headed. Yes, a lot of things are not as i prefer. In a lot of ways, things are more complicated than i could've wanted. But, such must be done in order to reach the place in life i've always hoped for myself, or at least, give me a chance at it.  Nothing great comes easy, and when it does, there's always a catch. Every great treasure has involved a task-filled journey and multitude of trials. I make this journal as i pursue the road that lies before me, joys and sorrows, trials and successes, ... in pursuit of hope ... redemption ... personal legend ... legacy ...    And thus my title : "There are no shortcuts to glory".
