      I'll say it again: if you draw Saxsma for TOK, change your name and move to Canada. If you spend a lot of time on that end of semester project, as Solomon, Ryan and I did, and aren't in the&nbsp; half that passes ready yourself for this speech: "Well&nbsp;I thought it was good, but&nbsp; [suck&nbsp; air through fake smile ]&nbsp;you're going to half to&nbsp;do it again." (I'm of course hypothesizing,&nbsp;I don't have her for TOK and have no real idea how many times she may suck air through her teeth). Thankfully&nbsp;&nbsp;my second project is looking good and the class ends on Friday. I also got to watch on PBS (since the networks didn't think it was important enough) Barack Obama address the Democratic National Convention. He is my new hero. Look him up:  urlLink www.obamablog.com . Tonight&nbsp;I watched my other hero the Rev. Al Sharpton go 14 minutes over his limit in an amazing&nbsp;speech.&nbsp; I still can't understand why he lost (yes&nbsp;I can).

      I went to the dentist today for my first ever real surgery. That numbness is the weirdest thing Iâ€™ve ever felt. I think I screwed up in telling him that I needed more because I can't breathe out of one nostril and holding liquids in my mouth is still a problem after a four hours. I can't even see what he did which I guess is a good thing. The dentist is good though because his TV gets the channels we don't so I could watch Lance Armstrong beat the crap out of Jan Ullrich whilst having my teeth drilled. Overall this dentist visit gets a 6 on a scale from 1 to acceptable.

      It was a relatively full weekend, Friday after TOK everybody got Thai food and we resolved to play tennis. Sadly, upon reaching the courts at Lasher we found the nets weren't up. We sat around and talked about the nets not being up until we realized there was a snake very close to where we were sitting. This had a detrimental effect on our wanting to say there, so we left. A few hours I had the honor of attending The Doobie Brothers Live at DTE. They were, of course, amazing (even more so due to the incredible seats we had) and a good time was had by all. Saturday, I drove myself to Farmington to be in their Founders Parade for State representing Gilda Jacobs, handing out candy and the like. I think our message was well received especially since the Republican candied in front of us only had stickers. Ryan, Kirk and myself rented "The Borne Identity" and I judged it to be of fair quality. I think we're going to see the sequel this week, which promises to be "action filled" and what not.

      I saw Eric Clapton this week and it was the closest I've ever felt to a  true religious experience. Seeing Eric Clapton live is like every good  thing in this world condensed into musical form. Its difficult to place  into words the way that man produces sound. There's no sense in even  trying, you have to hear it to believe it. "Layla" in particular  is impossible to compare to recorded versions. When you see the guitar  work up close its a completely different song. Absolute beyond  comprehension. Other developments this week:   -Summer TOK started: generally good. The hours are terrible but, I'm  glad this means&nbsp;I have zero chance of having the class with Saxsma.   -I saw "Anchorman": below "Dodgeball" in quality but I liked Tim Robbins as the Public TV guy.   -Also saw "Napoleon dynamite" with Aggie, Mona, and Blair: weird film,  but hilarious (I still don't get the part about the "delicious bass").   -Doobie Brothers tickets arrived: concert should be good.  &nbsp;  -And I discovered "When I Paint My Masterpiece" by The Band and found it to rival "The Weight" in terms of overall quality.

      It has been a busy week. I've been conflicted about writing because I think it is kinda stupid but then I remembered that I have this because its stupid (hence the secretly ironic). Anyway here's the past few days in quasi-chronological order. 1) Crosby, Stills, and Nash Concert: My whole family came to this one and it was good. Very Good. I saw Neil Young last winter and he was amazing and CSN was on par with that show. They messed with "love the one you're with" which was weird but the organ solo was still incredible and as it turned out much better live. "southern cross" was good enjoyable as was the general anti-bush/Enron/ken lay rant the band had the whole time. 2) Ryan got back from France and we saw Spiderman 2 (good) and King Arthur (not so good).  3) I spent two days and the Democratic offices in Roseville stuffing envelopes. On the second day we had to label four thousand postcards before the post office stopped taking our mail, which turned out to be kinda fun just because everyone was yelling the entire time, we did it in time which was cause for celebration. 4) I got to see the 1982 Cal-Stanford game twice on ESPN Classic which, if you have a mild interest in college football or general greatness, I strongly recommend you see.  Next week TOK starts and I'm attending the Doobie Brothers concert, both of which should be interesting, to say the least.

      HUNTINGTON WOODS 7/5/04- Tired of the significant lack of Christopher Reade based publishing on the Internet, local Christopher Reade expert Christopher Reade has started a Internet journal devoted solely to the events surrounding Christopher Reade. "I think a large percentage of the general population will agree that there is a definite void of Christopher Reade on the net right now" Reade said today from his home in Huntington Woods. Reade hopes he can keep up with the large volume of things Christopher Reade is involved with on a daily basis: "Christopher Reade is no lazy man. Far from it"
