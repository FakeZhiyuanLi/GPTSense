       Im a bit confused at the moment. My boyfriend of almost two years broke up with me, about a month or two ago. i finally got over him a few weeks ago but i feel like i need to write this.      He was my closest friend who i could confide in and have fun with. I loved him, but it was not to be. About two months before he broke up with, he started to have a crush on another girl, i shouldn't have dismissed it, but we're young, we have hormones, i guess thats why i didn't think it would happen. but it did. he broke up with me for her, and then he still sat in the same place where i do, but with her. i couldn't stand to see them, so i would walk off and play sport with the boys. now im over it and ive started talking to my friends who sit near them, but there is more distance now. they dont really talk to me, and walk off without me. Im isolated once again......it doesn't feel that great. but i should be used to it, ive been treated like this all my life.      a few weeks ago, he said he got over me when he dumped me, and that he didn't think he ever loved me, he just said it. i feel like tearing him limb from limb. the stuff i told him, ill know he'll keep it a secret, but i doubt i would have told him it.      Now i am confused, im going through a moment of finding myself but my friends don't understand. i don't know how to act, how to look, or even what to say. im falling asleep in classes and sometimes i have no interest in life at all.      not all of this is because of him, it was there before he asked me out. i guess it has just manifested over the years.      not likely anyone will read this, but if you do...let me know

       Ok, so nothings new. this is my first blog and wow. what fun.      i am a real girl and i go to Emmaus College. Thats in rocky. I had a boyfriend but he broke up with me for another girl, surprisingly im still friends with him. i cried about it twice, and that was a week and a half after it happened.       I have great friends, but id rather read books then socialize. Talking about drinking isn't one of my favorite topics. i wish i could talk more to them, but i don't know how. this is one of the first times ive actually got friends.       i was bullied during primary school because i had a problems with my nose, it kept on running, also because id be out playing sport with the boys, then sitting down bitching.       this isn't really much but at least its a start. ive got to go, but ill add a more meaningful blog later....      till then
