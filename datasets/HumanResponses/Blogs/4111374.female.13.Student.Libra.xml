       Ok, now I might be wrong here, but I am just wondering why the OC is called the OC   I mean obviously wee all know that it stands for Orange County, but um, ex-ca-use me, is there anything orange about where they live???   NO   But I still love the OC more than any other show (yes yes yes its true, Home&amp;Away is now second on the list of my favourite shows of all time)   And yes yes yes yes yes im so bored now     OHMIGOSH I JUST HAD A BREAKTHROUGH

       Yes yes yes Beth I read your comment on natural bloggers and I sort of understand...I blog alot about embarrasing moments, because they happen to me alot...but does that make me natural??   I dont know...do you have to blog about relevant things to be a Natural Blogger...because if that is the case, then my hope is forever lost lol.

       Guess what??   Its that time of the week again...yes yes yes thats right...its time for another one of JACKIS EMBARRASING MOMENTS!!! (one posted every monday)   Ok, so I went to the movies with Julia and Kiera, and then Julias mummy picked us up, and you know that carpark on the like top floor bit??  And you can walk around the corner of the box office to get to it???  Well yes yes yes, she parked there....and it was summer, so I was wearing a skirt that was made of material that wasnt heavy...IT WAS LIGHT, OH YES, OH YES OH YES IT WAS LIGHT MATERIAL EASILY BLOWN UP BY THE WIND BUT THATS NOT ALL!!!!!   So yes yes yes you can guess guess guess what happened (well actually you probably cant because if this happened to anyone else they would probably die of shame and then there would be no one to tell the story of embarrasment, so it has never been told so you have never heard of it) so we were walking out the door into the carpark to get to the CAR and then we walked out the door and suprise suprise my skirt blew right up and now my bright pink (and  ever-so-slightly  see through undies were now visible to the whole world, BUT THATS NOT ALL....   The amusing part is that I didnt notice that my skirt had even blown up until we had walked halfway across the carpark.   ba-doom-cha!!      (and to all those people who are wondering if  "the wind between your legs" really feels as good as they say, I am here to tell you..................yes, yes it does.

       Is that how you spell woes???  WHAT THE HELL ARE WOES???   That doesnt matter because my legs hurt so much because this morning my bus didnt stop for me so i had to walk 3km to get to the train station and then this afternoon i was waiting for my mummy to pik me up and she NEVER CAME so i called her and she said she had to take Cathe to the doctor and so I HAD TO WALK ALL THE WAY HOME, YES, YES THAT IS RIGHT I HAD TO WALK LIKE 6KM IN ONE DAY (MAYBE MORE IF YOU COUNT WALKING DOWN TO SCHOOL AND ALL THE WALKING I DO IN BETWEEN CLASSES I AM SO ENRAGED RIGHT NOW.            actually no, I so cant be bothered to be enraged right now, so I'll just be quietly fuming in the corner.               on second thoughts, I cant even be bothered to do that.   Screw this being angry thing, Im going to get some ice-cream.

       Ok, I've just had a thought....wot is with the word kankle, ok???   I mean, seriously. We all know what a kankle is, right? Well its like when you have no ankles becoz your legs are so like, fat, that your bottom-leggy-bit just goes straight into your foot...not a pretty site.   So the first thing I noticed about this word is that it has the word 'ankle' in it...WHY??? why should ankle be part of the word if it isnt even part of the body part....people who have kankles have NO ankles. If there's no ankle on the leg, there shouldn't be an ankle in the word...should there??   The second thing I noticed was that the bit in front of the 'ankle' bit was a 'k'. WHY??? There is no 'k' in fat...there is no 'k' in obese...there is no 'k' in overweight....I AM SO CONFUSED!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?????   Who invented the word kankle becoz whoever it was i am going to smack their bottom.

      This is VERY INTERESTING so listen up I will TELL you how to make a home-made g-string you need two things: an old pair of undies a large dumpster (bin) with a hook on the side. now, this is another embarrasing story that has happened to me (note: ALL the stories on this blog are COMPLETELY and UTTERLY TRUE!!! I promise) I was waiting for my bus, and there was like this dumpster so I decided to stand on the side of it, like just randomly. So I was wearing pants, and they got caught on this hook on the side of the dumpster and then when I tried to get off, I was left hanging in mid-air (like 1.5 m off the ground) and then my pants finally gave way, and ripped. So there was a big hole in the back of my pants BUT THATS NOT ALL. My fabulous pink floral undies had ALSO become cought on the hook, and had ALSO ripped, but the tear was SO XTREME that it split the seams on my undies, so that only one side remained...that may be hard to understand so ill make it easier... THE REMAINING SEAM SLID SIDEWAYS AND I WAS LEFT WITH A HOME-MADE G-STRING. WOW!!!! Be amazed All of you people out there remember I BELIEVE IN YOU you CAN make your own g-string and I am living proof that it IS POSSIBLE!!!!! MORE EMBARRASING MOMENTS SOON!!!

      Well just because I am so CRAZY I would like 2 tell you about my most embarrasing moments. Ok one is when I was in year two, and we had to have swimming lessons at lane cove pool and then so ok, i was like ill do backstroke and so you know how you like sit on the wall??? I would draw a picture but I cant so like, yeh. So anyway, im in year two so I was wearing a one-piece cozzi and I push of from the wall and the straps came off my arms and I shot back so fast that my cozzi flew off and I was left wading NAKED in the pool in front of the WHOLE YEAR!!! as you can tell it was very embarrasing but also strangely comfortable... MORE EMBARRASING MOMENTS COMING SOON...(if i can be bothered)

WE WILL NEVER KNOW until they tell us...which will probably be in like 4 minutes but oh well yes so ta-ta-for-now
