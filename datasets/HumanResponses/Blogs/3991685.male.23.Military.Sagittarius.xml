      Okay, I just got finished telling you all in the previous post that I love my m750 Ducati Monster. But I now covet another...I just got back from the dealership, because my sister was interested in a bike. We didn't quite find one she immediately liked, but my heart has been stolen by another. It's still a monster, so maybe it's not really too bad. I was lookng at the 2004 monster 620ie. Yes, it's a smaller engine. My M750 is a 2001...the very next year ducati intorduced fuel injection to all the monster engines. The next year after that, all the engines got upped. At the time, 600's couldn't be found in California (our bikes are litterally different than other states' bikes....our emissions standards see to that...as such, many makers don't introduce certain models to CA...for example the retro-cool Kawi ZRX1100 wasn't initially here either). I got a 750. But the dry clutch is a bitch. It's been a couple years, and I still think it's a bitch. It's heavy as hell. You need to be some super forearmed freak to think nothing of such a heavy lever. It really makes the bike not as fun to ride as it should be.  The 620ie is fuel injected...and its performance is almost identical to my 750. The wet clutch is smooth and light. The one I saw was a yellow standard model. Mine's a "dark." Meaning it's sans fairing, seat cowl and shiny paint. I like the 620ie I saw. It looks sleek, shiny. The seat cowl and bikini fairing just make it look faster. But there's somthing badass about the flat primer black that my m750 is in. I'm torn aesthetically. But I like the 620 in ride. Oh well, I have no money anyway.  But I still hate the clutch. I hear I should go get an aftermarket slave clutch cylinder...it'll make the lever a lot lighter. But it doesn't sound like something I can easily install. eh.  Sorry for boring you. This post sucks, I know. I still have that paper to write...and a powerpoint presentation to accompany it. eh. I still blame  urlLink naval aviators .

      Yes, I said I wouldn't post for a while because of schoolwork. This post says I lied. A wise man told me once that "If you wait until the last minute to do something, it will only take a minute."  A friendly visitor posted a comment (in the  urlLink Great American Novel  post) concerning that picture of my Para-Ordnance P-13 over there on the side, as my blogger avatar. The comenter was relieved I didn't turn out to be a lunatic. I posted a reply:  well, I don't shoot *people* with that gun. heh. Just stray dogs...defenseless animals...that sort of thing. No, I'm kidding. Really. I don't kick poor old ladies down stairs, either. I think the previous picture I had up there in its place was creepier. I used to have a self portrait up there. Someone asked what happened to the "artsy" self portrait after I had replaced it. I have a growing boat-load of pictures that I have been taking like a madman since I got my digital camera a few months ago. After art school, I had decided I would never pick up charcoal or guoache ever again. One early picture I took that I liked was that one you see to your right.  I don't want to come off as an even bigger nut than I truly am. But I like machinery. The lines, the idea of human ingeneuity. I ride a ducati monster. it's a "naked" bike, meaning the engine is exposed, as opposed to those spiffy riceburners and the like with the fairings. It's naked because everything is exposed--the engine, the trellis frame. If you've ever seen a ducati monster you'd know what I was talking about. 999's get all the attention--and yes, they are better bikes. But there's something very beautiful about bikes like the monster. Something flat out attractive about the fact it doesn't try to hide the hoses, the cylinders, the pipes. My dad rides an Indian. A big honkin' American cruiser (he likes to call my little bike a "pasta burner"). I can sit there for hours just staring at that shiny v-twin. The exposed push-rods, gleaming exhaust. I like the forms. There are sharp lines. There are long smooth, curving lines. There are relfections of faces, of the environment. There are flat areas which seem to absorb light. Parts are scalding. Other parts are cool to the touch. Cruisers and naked bikes revell in the breaking of the lines. They both embrace and shun the speed form. It's beautiful. It's mechanical.  Poets greater than I have commented on the firearm as "the great equalizer"--that which is the culmination of brains over brawn. In times past, the bigger, stronger, faster caveman dictated all. The big, hairy giant of the group chose where to sleep, where to go, when to eat. To the victor the spoils...and the victor was the man who could swing the club better, throw the spear farther. Skill became part of the equation, but it was all still based on physical ability. Later, the cultured nobleman who afforded fencing lessons and cultivated the art of swordsmanship, was always the superior over the peasant. Swords required greater skill and practice than the average joe could afford. The industrial, mechanical instrument in projectile-throwin' changed that. The firearm paved way for greater egalitarianism. Armored knights, landed gentry, no longer had the monopoly on power. The backpacker could brave wilds, venture off self-sufficient. Such things ultimately allowed a backwards, uncouth, upstart of a nation like ours to forge ahead, to make a mark, to set a place among the lineage, brawn-driven old world powers. (As an aside, though, they often easily counter with the idea that our "brain" isn't necesarily  intellectualism )  But all of that is beside the point of my fascination.  There's something very...beautiful...of mechanical objects to me. I went on a very short rant somewhere below on how there are plenty of engineering students nowadays that have no passion for the art (and it is an art). There is a generation of engineers that are merely white collar number-crunchers. They seem so completely indifferent to it all.  The Para-Ordnance on the right is a derivative of a design by John Moses Browning, a Mormon from Utah. In fact it is mechanically identical to Browning's original Model 1911. It wasn't the first self-loading pistol in existence, but it is arguably the finest design to have been machined. Better writers can translate the mechanical into words. I sadly can't--and will have to leave this as a "take my word for it." I'm fascinated in the same way by those old steam engine locomotives. And radial-engined biplanes. And the sprockets on a bicycle. It goes beyond the classic or historical nature of it all (though I love that aspect as well)...it's the sounds, the sights. It's the fact that, yes, internal combustion engines should drip oil. The fact that there's something neat about seeing a carbeurator in action, and not fuel injectors buried under plastic. I like the chiseled, definite  forms,  the shapes.  I like the ingenious nature of harnessing the escaping gasses building pressure, pushing back the 1911's slide. This in turn is ejecting a spent cartridge out and loading a fresh one on its way back. I like the idea that during the controlled explosion of the whole process, a simple little metal link is all that's keeping the pressure bleeding off slow enough to prevent the slide from simply flying off into an operator's face. I like the heft of metal. I love the arrogance of us simple monkey-like beings--how we don't simply accept that we weren't born with a sabretooth tiger's claws, a bird of prey's talons. I like that we don't accept that water must flow this direcetion or that we cannot live in a dry desert like the spot Los Angeles sits in. I like the process, the reasoned thought in the culmination of  design . I like the ability to take problems and solve them through Rube Goldberg methods of interaction. But I also I like the specific simplicity of operation. The effeciency of every action having a role in a process.  I'm not someone who craves violence or anything. I have some misgivings of branching a combat arms branch when I graduate...so I'm not one of those folks that wants to "killl, kill, kill," or anything. I'm not against it though (a big part of me would count myself lucky to branch something hooah like Armor)...I just don't want the impression out there that being fascinated by something like a gun is necesarily linked to the desire to hurt. It isn't. I've never shot at anyone. I've never been shot at. I don't hurt small animals. I don't want to rob a liquor store. When someone cuts me off on the highway, I have  never  considered pulling out a gun and blowing them away. I wait in the same long lines at the DMV as you do. I am frustrated all the same. Maybe there's a lot of projection going on. People think  they themselves  would go postal. But no one has ever been frightened that a disturbed driver on the highway would intentionally plow into a crowd because he was cut-off. The object in that equation is a car. The gun (irrationally?) has a different connotation to a number of folks. But when is an object an object? We're not talking "destructive devices" here. They are not volitile in nature as virgin explosives are. A gun can't spontaneously shoot a bullet without an operator's usage or negligence. It simply cannot.  I like cars. I like bikes. I like guns. I even like raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens. Don't get me started on brown paper packages tied up in string, I just might go into a song and dance.

      I posted the following in a response to some comments in the previous post. Just to let you all know, but...    I may not be posting as much the folowing days. I got a medium-sized paper to write that I've procrastinated on (as always). It says 'grad student' over on the side there....but I'm actually finishing up my very last undergrad class at this very moment. There's so much of me that just wants to say screw the paper and hope for a C. I hope i didn't jinx anything by writing that. eh. I'm not superstitious. I don't think. But then again, maybe I'm tempting the superstition gods by saying I'm not superstitious. Like, "AHA! That young man is not in fear of us! We shall teach him a lesson!"

      So have you read this particluar one of my previous posts below:  urlLink Forgetting Failures ? That's the direct link (it'll open a new window), though you can simply scroll down, I posted it up on Saturday. You really should read it. Anyway, about that Army CPT in that post. I was curious and typed up her name in google. (I do that a lot. Strangers and aquantences alike, beware!) It seems she wrote a book and published it via instantpublisher.com. It seems to have been a graduate school project. I was thinking of buying it. I think I would have bought it immediately, if it wasn't for the fact instantpublisher is a self-selling sorta site. If you publish via instantpublisher, you basically buy quantities of your own book, so that you can in turn sell it yourself. Which means I'd have to go through the writer. What if she asks, "Hey, how'd you know I wrote this? What's that, you looked me up on the internet?" That seems creepy. It would seem fairly stalkerish to me. I wonder if stalkers ask themselves if they're being too stalkerish.  Anyway. I've always been looking into selfpublishing and stuff. I figured it was neat. Not that I think I'm ready to write anything like a book or anything (my skills as a pro writer are obviously lacking)...I just like the anti-elitist idea of it all: how any joe can go publish a book. Neat. So, I'm from a storytelling family. We carry on the oral tradition. Particularly on my father's side, accuracy is no obstacle to a great story. I think it's why I liked  urlLink Big Fish . It's my favorite Tim Burton movie. Well, I always had this idea to take down all the stories of my grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, etc. They'd all together make an outstanding picture of the American experience. My mom said I really should do this...frankly, my great-aunts, great-uncles and my last grandmother aren't going to be around another 30 years.  My great-uncle, Uncle Jesse, brother of my father's mother arrived in California at the age of 15. Sometime in the 1920's or 30's. He was by himself. He was 15 years old and sailed an ocean to work in some foreign field. Uncle Jesse alone had stories to fill books. He has been in prison for stabbing someone. He was a bootlegger. He's been a driver for...unscrupulous types...in Chicago. He was a "commando" (his words!) in the Army during the war, though spent much of it in a hospital (he loves telling his shot in the ass story...aparently, everyone has those). He vividly remembers the depression. He finally settled in Stockton, where he had first spent his early years in America (look up California history to see why Stockton has a significance). No one seems to know what happened to him the last two decades...but we still have plenty of second hand accounts.  My Uncle Frank on my father's father's side, also came to California on similar accounts. But by most measures that's where the similarities end. He had leading man good looks, by classic movie standards: litterally tall, dark and handsome. By most accounts, he was a matinee idol. Oddly enough, uncle Jesse, completely unrelated, and unaware his sister married my grandfather halfway around the world, knew this "guy named Frank." There's a certain timeless clash between leading-man-types and rough-and-tumble-types. Uncle Frank eventuually married a white woman, no easy feat considering people could get killed for interracial courtship at the time.  My grandfather spent the war years in the Philippines. He hadn't seen his older brother Frank since they were both children and he left for California. My grandfather was sorta drafted on December 7. He was visitng a friend on post, and well...the Japanese attacked. Rememeber on December 7, Japan was bombing Hawaii, but around the same time was  invading  the Philippines. (There are some ignorant folk that don't remember the Philippines was our little experiment with extracontinental imperialism...it was a territory of ours until 1947). Anyway, my grandfather, a newlywed and merely 21, found himself a "Third Lieutenant" in the US Army. He had some college under his belt and they figured he'd be an okay quasi-officer. The stories he had. He obviously didn't want to talk about the death and destruction that veterans as himself had seen. But he has seen much. He recalls images of Japanese grenades being rolled down hills to chilling effect.  When things basically went to hell, everything was disbanded. My grandfather told his men to disperse, evade, and try and get to thier homes safely. My grandfather then walked home himself. My grandmother took his uniform and threw it in a burning house. Women were yelling that the Japanese were killing anyone in a uniform. The Philippines was occupied territory. I have relatives that continued the fight, as insurgents. My grandfather's youngest brother, Pedro, was killed by the Japanese as a guerilla. He was 17.  My mother's father was too young to play the partisan or soldier. He recalls selling cigarettes to Jap soldiers.  My grandmother on my mother's side was looking for her young sister near the end of the war. She was still calling her name when she found herself near a hospital and bombs were dropping. She was hit, fell and lie there bleeding. She eventually got to safety by tugging on the pant leg of a passing GI. She still has a sliver of shrapnel in her lip.  My great-aunt, this grandmother's older sister, was lined up in front of a firing squad. She dropped like dead weight when she heard the shots. Miraculously she survived. The Japanese had even bayonetted the piles of bodies. Miraculously she survived this as well. She was an eyewitness in the war crimes trials. She testified to this, as well as the often heard story that Japanese soldiers threw babies in the air and caought them on bayonets. She was a first-hand witness.  Near the end of the war, my grandfather was reissued his US Army uniform. They were training to take the fight to Japan, and the units were getting reorganized. They were expecting plenty of casualties, but were training hard with the tactics learned throughout the war. He was in the middle of training, comitting plans to memory, when  the  bombs were dropped.  Uncle Frank, having not been in his native Philippines in more than ten years, visited his brother, my grandfather. He was a visitor in his American uniform. My grandparents thought he was some spit-and-polish, dashing white man when he pulled up in a jeep. Imagine thier surprise.  My dad and his siblings had a remarkably "To Kill a Mockingbird" like upbringing in the relative-boonies. He used to go hunting with his dad and the best darn hunting dog in the world, Kelly. He used to play in the fields and jungle, once finding old rusted Japanese Arisaka rifles and a samurai sword. My aunts have stories of beating up bullies that picked on thier younger brother, my future dad--the same man who would later clear my closets of boogeymen. My aunts and uncle have stories of ghosts and monsters haunting the roads and fields. My father recalls my grandfather waiting on the front porch all night in a rocking chair with a shotgun across his lap. The neighbors swore they had seen an evil, though beautiful, appiration of a woman in white at night. My grandfather wanted to see for himself. He was angry the following morning when he never saw anything.  My grandfather was a professor at the university and was well respected. The zoo had lost a crocodile. My grandfather, the best shot in the province, put a bullet straight through its eyes while it was crossing a road. He was also in the reserves, so every so often he'd go drill. The Muslim problem in the southern Philippines has been around before the Spanish got there in the 1400's. The 1950's was no different. But my grandfther, a man not afraid of anything, the best shot in the province, the sharpest professor at the university, and an officer in the reserves, was well respected by muslims and christians alike.  My grandfather had written a letter to President Johnson asking for citizenship, citing his service in the US Army. The response, signed by the president, is still framed, one of my grandfather's prized posessions.  My father went to highschool in central Los Angeles at Belmont High. The name would mean something to you if you are southern Californian. It wasn't the greatest of schools.  He enlisted as a 17 year old in the Navy. He wasn't even a US citizen yet. My grandfather had to sign a waiver, as he wasn't 18 yet either. My grandfather disagreed with his decision, but couldn't dissuade his stubborn son. He was his father's son, after all. He was an airman in the V-4 division on the Saratoga (the purple-shirt guys running around on the flight deck). On the Vietnam cruise, the Saratoga swung by the Philippines, and my dad visited my grandmother and aunt(immigration is a piece-meal deal; folks across oceans can't simply run accross borders--besides, they were taking the legal route). My father, the visiting "American" in the uniform, was almost as unrecognizable to my grandmother as her brother-in-law, Uncle Frank, had been so many years before. My aunt told him to be careful because of the war. My grandmother, in a rather amusing spontaneous lack of sense, said, "War? What war? The Japs are long gone..." As part of Operation Linebacker II (pick up a book), certain V-4 sailors aboard the Saratoga, in an unreported near-scandal, were getting antsy having not eaten for more than 24 hours. My father single-handedly, though probably unintentionally, averted a mutiny.  In college, using his GI Bill, my father was sitting at the student union at Cal State LA. They were looking for extras for  urlLink MacArthur . In the film he had a closeup, firing an antiaircraft gun, right before getting blown up by a Jap bomb. He and his pal "Greg" Peck hit it off (ok, that was surely exageration). He was part of the Screen Actors Guild, until they kicked him out for not paying dues. He was an Air Force reservist in an air refueling squadron for a while. The flight sergeant would often call to ask if he'd show up for drill " this  week."  My grandfather was a teacher for the LA Unified School District. He taught in a pretty rough school. Everyday, with a terrible accent, he'd proceed to tell his math classroom filled with angry black kids that they were "idiots." One day, my father brings my grandfather his reading glasses to this classroom, because he had left them at home. My grandfather stopped the class, and introduced his son, "the engineer." "He goes to college, unlike the rest of you idiots...he is very intelligent, my son here, Junior." My father, embarrassed, left the room.  My grandfather died estranged from my imediate family. He was close to all my aunts' and uncle's families. But my father, my grandfather's very own oldest son, was never the same to his dad after a bitter divorce. My grandfather was a womanizer even as a senior citizen. My grandfather's own "Junior" was the sole person angry among his siblings. My dad remembers his dad bringing him to register for high school. He remembers the first pair of American pants and shoes he got, bought by his dad at a Sears in downtown LA. He remembers the dad that picked him up from the airport after leaving the Navy. But he also couldn't forget the dad that left his mother in another country. He would remember the dad that cursed when he found his would-be-ex-wife there in America; as a "surprise" from his adult children, they paid for a plane ticket for thier mother. He remembers, though, the dad that was so happy at his first American-born grandson's birth. He remembers the dad that got drunk with his son's father-in-law at the hospital handing out cigars. He remembers the veteran, the man not afraid of any neighborhood appiritions, the best shot in the province, his first hunting buddy, the dying old man in a nursing home.  My father's family was a relatively "off-the-land" type of people. My mother's side was decidedly urban bourgious, just shy of blueblood. When my mom came to America she wasn't particularly fond of the move. She had a perfectly alright life where she was, she figured. Before California, they had two maids. And a driver. She recalls a haughty fit when she was very young where she asked her parents why the maids didn't call her "seniorita." As a very young kid, my father remembers  painting  his shoes because they needed to be black for a formal affair.  They met in college. Truth be told, had both my parents been Filipinos and not the  Americans  they were, they probably would not have married. Class distinctions as it is. Imagine, a simple provincial boy who went fishing in his backyard, with a city girl who went to private schools her entire life. My mother remembers a trip to the province as a very young girl where she took a ferry and felt mildly sorry for the folks on the deck roasting in the sun. They smelled. Her family had a stateroom. My father, as a youngster, took a similar boat, possibly at the same place. He was on the deck with his brother and sisters. Lord knows if they were there at the same time, same place, by some funny twist of fate.  My father was from central LA. My mother from West. He was loud and uncouth. She was quiet and shy, though studious. My father's first car was a Dodge Colt in which he had to use his hands, hanging out the window, to wipe the windshield in the event of rain. He had bought the Colt in lime green, with the money he saved from several jobs and from what he gained from selling his little Honda dual-sport motorcycle. With the car, my mother wasn't relegated to clinging for life behind my father on the back of a tiny Japanese bike.  My mother considers herself the "Jan" to her older sister's "Marcia." This Jan was the overachiever, the good student which every teacher adored. Marcia still came out ahead in attention, though. My mother's younger sister suffers from Down's Syndrome and is thus still the baby. She's still my grandmother's "special child." My mother's brother was the favorite—beneficiary of college cars and allowances. He could get away with murder, so says my mother. My grandfather taught his children to drive stick going up and down a single road in west Los Angeles. My mother remembers the 8-Ball shifter.  My mother's father was a disciplinarian. Though he was a loving father, he had a stern demeanor. He died in his 50's, an American for merely a handful of years. Though he lived a relatively healthy life without cigarettes, lung cancer consumed him barely past 50. He would be there to give away his daughter, my future-mother. He died the very year I was born, the first and only grandson he would know. We lived in their home as I was a newborn. He had worked feverishly to complete a fireplace and wood &amp; mirror wall, desperately hammering with a delicate touch to avoid waking the baby. They picked out a grave, he lay on the ground where he would rest for eternity. He taught my grandmother to drive, she had never driven a car before. He drove himself as per routine for chemotherapy, until my mother insisted he was too weak. He died in his sleep.  Stories actually weave here and there. Relatives that weren't relatives at the time had crossed paths and so forth. The stories told are countless and it's really too bad this American son is too lazy to put it all down.

      So I wrote before how my sister went to school at the Coast Guard Academy.&nbsp; I just find it really neat that my little sister is a fresh little butterbar ensign. Big woolychested chiefs call her "ma'am." heh. Imagine that. All 5 foot 2 of leadership excellence (oh, wait...that's AROTC's motto).   I wanted to get her a present before she went off to her first cutter. I wanted to get her a stuffed parrot, eyepatch and plastic "wooden" peg leg. I settled for a book. But I like what I had in mind first.   "ARRGH!" says she.   "Welcome aboard, ma'am," says aforementioned woolychested, 6 foot 5, 250 pound, head-to-toe tatooed Chief Petty Officer. He'd be just at home on an 18th century whaling ship.   "Hop on one leg, ye blisterin' sea dog!" yells the little ensign--a cute as a button 21 year old, commanding authority (because of the wooden peg leg...don't you watch pirate movies?).   "...uh....ma'am?"   "I said ONE LEG! Petey, me parrot, don't take kindly to yer wasting my time!"   "Aye aye, ma'am." See 6 foot 5,&nbsp; 250 pounds of tatoos hop on one leg.   Ok, I'm not some salty newenglander. I'm a Californian. As you can tell we don't sail much here. We like cars. And surfboards, I guess. But I'm from the Inland Empire. So, if you listen to the folks from Orange County (not "the OC." Don't parrot anything you hear on TV) or Los Angeles, us folks in the Inland Empire hang out at WalMart, in between cruising around in our El Caminos (only because my IROC Z is up on blocks in the front yard).&nbsp; That's all, of course, only&nbsp;if there ain't a NASCAR race on.  To many, what the Inland Empire is to the rest of southern California, the Coast Guard is to the rest of the US military.&nbsp; It's too bad the Coast Guard has kinda been the poor red-haired stepchild of the Armed Forces. Poor thing. It doesn't get the groupies that the Marines get. (They get male groupies, even. It scares me. the next time I see someone say something how Marines are 7 feet tall and can blow fire from thier asses, I'm gonna throw a manly hissy fit).&nbsp; The Coast Guard doesn't get the ridiculous amounts of female enlistees or cushy posts that the Air Force has.&nbsp; The Coast Guard doesn't get the street cred that the Navy has with massive air wings of fighter jets, nuclear powered aircraft carriers or balistic missile submarines (Tom Clancy's wet dreams don't include the Coast Guard...wouldn't be interesting if Jack Ryan hitched a ride on a cutter...378' or otherwise). I'm not even going to compare it to my beloved Army.   All that said, I'd like to take the time to note the Coast Guard could probably wipe the floor with any NAVY that any single other nation can put to sea.&nbsp; All this is unsubstantiated and highly the product of boastful imagination, but in my opinion the US Coast Guard could single-handedly kick the ass of the British Royal Navy (please see disclaimer at top of page).&nbsp; Up until relatively recently, the high endurance cutters were armed with Harpoon anti-ship missiles. How's that for bad ass? They still got point defense phalanx guns (I don't remember what they call'em...that's what the Navy called them), so they can shoot down incoming missiles. The 378's got Mk92 Fire Control Systems, with good ol' fashinioned 76mm guns (they replaced the old 5"). They got all that and a whole lotta gumption!   No really, though. I really think the Coast Guard is neat. And it doesn't get the attention or respect it deserves.&nbsp; They participate in all our wars, get shot up as well as the Navy does, and contribute in proportion that dwarfs their actual size. Rememeber Saving Private Ryan, all you folks who must link everything to experiences from movies? Guess who drove most of those Higgins boats? Heck, go ask an in-the-know (fire-spewin' even) Marine about  urlLink Signalman First Class Douglas Munro . Concerning the Marines he was protecting with his own body, his last words were, "Did they get off?" The Coast Guard is in Iraq. They've had boots on the ground (they're not somehow just floating around in the Gulf). It's had its reservists deployed--pulled from the same American families and civilian lives as that of any highspeed 11B's. Consider the scrappiness of the little service: the New York Fire and Police Departments combined is bigger than the entire US Coast Guard.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Coast Guard's&nbsp;not nearly as well funded as its higher profile DOD brothers are, and what little attention it gets is in the idea that they save folks caught in storms. Yes, they do that...but they do a whole lot more.

      I was exploring this blogspot thing further today. I left the following comment on another person's site.   I happened by because I clicked "John Denver" on my "music" list on the blogger profile thing...just to see if there are any other folks out there that would admit it. [...] It creeps me out you listed Jim Croce and John Denver, consecutively, in the same order as me. I was looking at other people's profile pages and it amazes me to no end that that wasn't the only coincidence I found. Who'd have thunk (yes, not a word) that folks could list stuff like skynyrd, linkin park and gordon lightfoot together as well. They're actually out there. Imagine my surprise. Maybe it's not much of a coincidence...more like monkeys pushing random keys...I guess it just shows I'm not a real music fan...merely eccentrically eclectic.

      I'm a pretty slow runner. Granted, since high school, I've gotten a lot worse. I'm at my peak, so far, at the moment...but it was a long road to regain this ground.   I wanted to be a fighter pilot since as far back as I could remember. Every asshole says this...but I meant it. I live and breathe aviation. I had a plan and it consisted of Annapolis and eventually goldwings. Somewhere along the way my eyes didn't get the memo. My prescription right now is absolutely terrible. I think in the end, I sort of sabotaged myself subconsciously in high school because I knew I'd never be a pilot (for the military anyway). So my grades were pretty sucky. (I graduated with a 3.10 GPA...but that's only because AP classes were weighted). I got my nomination from my congressman, but I still think it's only because the&nbsp;Naval Academy&nbsp;guy on the review board liked underdogs.&nbsp; It didn't surprise me&nbsp;when I wasn't accepted by the school. (I got on a wait-list for the Merchant Marine Academy, though) Looking back, I guess I could have tried for NAPS (prep school)...but I think I just felt rejected by it all.   So I went with what I was good at. I went to art school. I think it worked out well enough, but someone forgot to tell me that talent is only half the equation to be completely successful in art. Passion is paramount. Engineers can get by without it. Biology majors, etc. But not art. So I got plenty of C's and I wasn't terribly happy with it all. (not  because  of my grades...they were only indicators)   Anyway, I ended up at Art Center College of Design (in Pasadena). Great school. The service bug never left, though. Heinlein saw to that. He's influenced me since I was 10. After about 2 years of art school, I tried calling up USC's Air Force ROTC detachment.&nbsp; They couldn't cross-enroll me, though, from the school I was attending--so I figured I'd just apply for Air Force OTS after college.   Then September 11 happened. I think I wanted to hasten my involvement. I transferred to the nearest public university so I could cross-enroll for ROTC. (I posted about this before somewhere below) I decided to drop art because I just came from the best dang art school in the country only to find myself in a mediocre one at a public university. So I finished off a BA in political science instead, because I don't write half-bad...and I have a bigger passion for government and politics than art. Guess I should have started with Poli-Sci to begin with. I figured at the time I was a better artist than writer. heh.   Anyway. I was just about to call up USC's AFROTC detachment again when I noticed they had ROTC on campus at my school. But it was Army. eh.   Traditionally, my family has had ties to the Army. Most guys in my family had served in it at one capacity or another. But I never figured it for me. Mainly because I was intimidated by the running.   My first PT test I ran&nbsp;a 25 minute 2 mile&nbsp;(again, I slacked off immensely after high school, and it had been 3 years since I had run any distance). People can walk faster than that. Retarded folks can walk backwards faster than that.&nbsp; I think my one mistake was not signing up for PT my first semester. It ain't mandatory if you're not contracted, and at the time I was just testing the waters.&nbsp; I finally passed a PT test just a couple weeks ago. Oddly enough, my score actually decreased, because my grader was being a lot more picky about my pushups.   I still have a long way to go. My score right now is only 214. It's out of 300. The APFT consists of a 2mile run, pushups and sit-ups. Each event is 100 points possible (though, there is an extended scale for the PT studs).&nbsp; My last score was actually 224. But it wasn't passing because a score under 60 in any one&nbsp;event is failure.&nbsp; Even if you get 100 in, say, pushups and sit-ups each, yet only get 59 in your run (that's 259 total), you will fail.&nbsp; Technically you can pass with 180 points by getting 60 all around. My first passing score was 214...a full 10 points under my highest score (which was failing). heh.   Anyway. My running still ain't where I want it to be...but it is where it  needed  to be. I want enough of a buffer so that even on a terrible day, with a dang bone sticking out of my skin, I can pass a PT test.   I remember the final APFT during the spring I felt so terrible that I failed. The funny thing is,&nbsp;I felt terrible mostly because I let down my teacher, an Army captain, who helped me during the semester. She was also the enrollment/recruiting officer in addition to being cadre member and instructor of my class. Furthermore, she wrote a letter of reference for me in my graduate school applications.&nbsp; I felt bad I failed myself, but worse ( absolutely godawful) that I let her down.&nbsp;She had run with me during the semester and paced me during the actual test. She was leaving us this summer. That was my last chance.   It was the final APFT, and the CPT was running alongside,&nbsp;pacing me. Every once and a while I slowed down along the 2mile route, and she'd slow to quicktime, making me realize I was "running" slower than her walking.   "Damn it, let's go...Push. Make it hurt."   "Keep up with me."   "You need to want this."   This went on for a good fourteen minutes. Until finally:   "Start running like an officer in the US Army."   As a I crossed the finish line and heard the time called out, I wasn't sure exactly what it meant.&nbsp; The time keeper was calling out seconds.&nbsp; What minute was it? As I was trying to focus and regain enough strength to not vomit out  everything  in my system, I found out. I failed. I was short 20 seconds.   I'm probably never going to see the CPT again. The move wasn't a normal Army change-of-post thing.&nbsp; She was leaving the Army altogether because, in a seriously poetic irony that only fate could think of, she married a Naval Aviator.&nbsp;   I finally passed another test a mere week after she left. &nbsp;She will probably never know. I felt good that I finally passed the other week, but I can't shake the idea that the last test she would see me run I had failed.&nbsp;   She won't remember me years from now, I'm sure I'm just one of the infinite number of people&nbsp;that have been filtered through her eyes. But I think my failure will stick with me.&nbsp; Hauntingly,  she  will stick with me.&nbsp; I will never forget her.

      Spike TV (the channel) has nonstop car-related TV shows on Saturday and Sunday mornings. (sidenote: I'm shocked that Saturday morning cartoons have lost thier allure on me...I'm not sure if it's whether today's cartoons just suck, or I'm "growing up."&nbsp; I think it's the former.&nbsp; I've been just as likely not to pick up anything when I drop by Toys R Us the last few years. I'm spending more money picking up old toys on ebay. I think toys, like cartoons,&nbsp;suck now too. Poor kids these days...they got crap).   Anyway. Cars. There's this show called "redline tv" and I was watching it and there's this Japanese guy "teaching" us Americans how to "drift."&nbsp; He said somethin like we Americans are progressing and we're "almost" to the level the Japanese are.&nbsp; I can't help but think this&nbsp;would be like some Brazilian telling us that we're "almost" as good as them in soccer. Well...duh...red blooded Americans couldn't give a rat's ass about soccer.   I'm exagerating. I don't want homebrewed soccer-hooligans showing up at my house. (aww...how cute...an itty bitty American soccer hooligan).   Anyway. I hate Vin Diesel. It's his silly movie that brought the whole Honda fixation back. I'm from California...at the time that silly movie came out, the whole "I-can-take-a-Jap-four-banger-and-play-pretend-muscle-car" thing was already on a a slight fad-ish downturn (at least to the average non-fanatic). bleh.   I had a Honda Prelude in highschool. I wasn't delusional about what it was...a Japanese econobox. As an undergrad, I was looking into something british...I was thinking Triumph or an MG. They were cheap, and looked spiffy. And the history. The Datsun 240z was an impulse buy.&nbsp; $2500 of all the cash I ever had in my entire life.&nbsp; What better car to get than the one that pretty much served the death knell to the British car industry in America? A timeless sportscar that rivaled anything of its day, for the price of the best Europe had to offer, without the unreliablilty burdened on anything British.   I've always&nbsp;loved the Z. I was never a fan of what happened post-1973 to the line...they just got uglier as the generations progreessed. There's something timeless about the original 240z--and something dated about all its offspring. Even the 300zx, by most measures a great car, will be perpetually stuck in a 90's rut. Look at it. It can be argued its an atractive car, but I don't think you can argue its a timelss car.&nbsp; I think the 350z will be dated in a few years as well. It looks tied to today's lines.   So I was selling my dad's truck on ebay last year (actually, a few months ago). I had listed it at just shy of $2k to get bidders inteerested...I was already getting calls about it and interest was decently high.&nbsp; My dad earlier agreed to let me sell it and keep the proceeds...he just didn't want the truck anymore. Well, I wasn't around and he picked up the phone one time only to find a potential buyer on the other end. Long story short, the next time I came by the house, the truck wasn't there anymore. Pops had sold it. For $2000.&nbsp; I had bidders up past $5000.   I've never seen my father genuinely sorry for anything.&nbsp; He's the stubborn, decisive type.&nbsp; God bless him for it. But here he was, after I told him, near tears. Sorry.   Anyway. Guilt is funny.&nbsp; I got the proceeds of $2000...coupled with about $3000 of previously hoarded cash. By impulse (coupled with guilt) I found myself the owner of a 3rd gen RX-7. It had cost $10k, a steal because it had a salvaged title. As far as we could tell the seller was honest when he said it was a salvage "theft"--rather than it being totaled or anything. Pops put up half of the price. I found myself the owner of 2 cars. Me, a fulltime student without a job...two&nbsp;gas-guzzling sportscars.&nbsp; (Most of my cash came from my student loans...I was surprised to learn that you get checks sent to you concerning the balance of the loans past tuition.&nbsp; heh. I used your taxpayer subsisized federal student loans on a silly sportscar)   I could go on into 3rd Generation RX-7's, but I'll leave that off for another day. Suffice it to say, they're damn beautiful (yes, in a timeless way).&nbsp; They're relatively rare. They could beat the Corvette c4's of thier day...probably even the ZR1's. Sucker handles like slot car.

       Okay, maybe everyone has seen this already, and I'm hopping on this bandwagon way too late. But darn it all to heck if this ain't one of the funniest things I've seen. I really love being American...especially after seeing this. (click the picture)   This Land...     urlLink   &nbsp;    While we're on the topic of neat stuff that you've probably already seen...   Here's somthing else brought to my attention a long while ago. Check out one example showing that our schools are just stifling genius.&nbsp; This kid is genius, truly genius. I'm not even being sarcastic...do you realize the thought it takes to make someone laugh like this? I present, El Nino.  urlLink CLICK HERE    Tears me up seeing such untapped potential...

      To preface this, I must note you probably won't find anything terribly profound here. Just jotting down some thoughts.   I think I have a problem with a lot of these leftist bloggers. "Problem" is too strong a word. I think there's just a lot of closemindedness over there. Ironic, much? There's a tendency for a lot of them to marginalize others with competing viewpoints. There was this one comment I saw in one blog by a soldier. The blogger noted that he bought  urlLink Tigerland  on DVD.&nbsp; The comment poster said something along the lines of "I hope you get ideas from that movie."&nbsp; As if soldiers are too inept to form their own ideas...or are such a complete separate class of folks that cannot possibly watch the same movies as "oh-so-enlightened" types.&nbsp; Soldiers must be saved from the error of thier ways by the cleansing powers of God...err...filmmakers. (besides, the commenter said that that was Schumacer's only good movie...what about  urlLink Falling Down ? or  urlLink Phone Booth ? I liked  urlLink Flatliners  too)&nbsp; Likewise, I've often found outgoing links from these guys' own blogs linking to milblogs. But they almost always carry a disclaimer attached to them...like they must somehow justify linking to an "evil stormtrooper" or else they'd be intellectually black listed from thier "oh-so-smart" colleagues.&nbsp; "This link is to someone who isn't a socialist..." gasp! the horror. (socialist, again, ain't a pejorative)   I'm still hesitant to use the word "liberal" when talking about today's leftists. I almost feel they hijacked the term. Yes, you can go on all day about how John Rawls linked today's liberals with classical liberalism...but that's supposing one accepts Rawls.   I'm a Liberal. I think most on the left today (so-called modern/postmodern liberals) would call me something else. I'd be a "conservative" but I have no religious/Christian morality sorta segment on my politcal compass. Don't get me wrong, I have a strong, unwavering&nbsp;faith in the man upstairs, but God never told me to smite down the purple teletubby.&nbsp; Jerry Falwell ain't my god.   In reality, I'm a classical Liberal.   Why must we Americans be separated by these inaccurate lines?&nbsp; I wish there was some multiparty system out here. Maybe there would be the "Christan-democrats" (read: Catholics). Maybe then we can diffrentiate bettween social-democrats (or socialists) from true Liberals. Or Christian moralists from other conservatives...And so forth.&nbsp; As it stands, I can't possibly be labeled a Democrat according to thier current platform.&nbsp; And Republican as a label has its problems sticking to me as well.&nbsp; As far as Left/Right goes...does left equal liberty or socialism (they aren't the same)? I think it's fair to equate  extreme  Right with authoritarianism.&nbsp; But why is it&nbsp;big government has a closer friend in the Democrats? Why do social-democrats like calling Libertarians "Far-Right"?&nbsp; True Libertarians are&nbsp;on the extreme polar opposite of rightwing, authoritarian, fascist government.&nbsp; I've met plenty of registered Republicans who don't have burdens of "moral majorites" foisting government to regulate purple teletubbies. But I've yet to meet a Democrat that would agree to the idea that less government, the better.&nbsp; It's a necesary tool for big stuff like defense, etc, says I. Nope, says them.&nbsp; Joe Lieberman is the biggest boogeyman to videogamers in American history.&nbsp; Here's a Democrat senator&nbsp;who wants to federally censor videogames.   I remember in  urlLink Tommy Boy  where Chris Farley is defending himself saying, "there are some people who&nbsp;spend seven years in college..." David Spade says, "yeah, they're called  doctors ." Heh. I've been in academia for a long while. (and I'm not a doctor) I think it would be a lot better place if it was closer to the ideal of free exchange of ideas.&nbsp; As it stands, closemindedness is in terrible disguises out here. Under false labels. And not where you'd ideally expect them to be. I've never seen flyers decrying "evil" Leftist guys speaking at symposiums.&nbsp; But how many times have we seen flyers about some "fascist" or "racist", etc? I'm not against the idea of letting people know about these speakers...but there's a certain tactic here that certain groups are employing to marginalize certain ideas.&nbsp; Yes, it can be on all sides...but which side should be fundamentally about liberty? No, it's a question...not a statement...I'm truly confused.   Blahblahblah. no more typey.      **UPDATE**:2135 23JUL04. I re-edited some words regarding definiton of "liberal" above, because I have one commenter (see comments) noting that I can be construed as an "Independent". I wouldn't call myself one...I think "Independent" has been code-word nowadays for Democrats that are just "too-cool-for-school."

      About that profile page. I hate the way they limit the amount of space under "movies" in my profile thing. I love movies...there's no way the short list even comes close to a snapshot of my tastes. The movies listed probably aren't even the "TOP" of the list.&nbsp; It's so hard to rank 'em all. I probably wouldn't have room if I were to list them here. So I won't even try.   As for music. I'm not nuts over music. I don't dislike it in the least, but as often as the radio is on or a CD is playing, the chances are the same that it's all off.&nbsp; I like driving (depends on the car...you honda drivers are probably fairly apatehtic about the whole thing).&nbsp; I like road trips.&nbsp;Even on&nbsp;interstate ones, I can go hundreds of miles without music.&nbsp;I like winding canyons. Oddly enough, I don't like riding the same canyons on a motorcycle...I'm not a confident rider.   Back to music. I don't hate anything in particular, genre-wise. So my list in that profile page is not exhaustive--but unlike the movie list, it's not a long list because I love too many.&nbsp; It's more of a "what-popped-in-my-head-that-particular-moment" list.&nbsp; I love all that's listed, but I'm not fanatic about it.   Here's the thing...I don't like concerts or anything. I love live music. But somewhere along the way in my life I realized I'm not a huge fan of crowds. I'd never want to live in Manhattan. I want to see skies. I don't want to be dependent on public transportation. I lived in the bay area for 2 years and took the BART daily. I hated it. I'm a southern Californian...I like my car, thank you very much.&nbsp; I think I'm simply enamored with at least the  idea  of self-reliance. I'm pretty darn Liberal politcally speaking. But we're talking classical liberal...not modern US social democrat liberal. Think John Locke...less John Rawls. (socialist, by the way, is not a pejorative). I guess I'd be a Libertarian, I'm just not a fan of the American Libertarian party. I'm a registered Republican. I (like most of us Americans historically)&nbsp;have a healthy distrust of big government...the Republicans at least pay lip service to that.   As far as my book list, I think I wanted to stick with the "story" stuff. I didn't want to sound too pretentious by listing intellectual crap. I'm not an intellectual.&nbsp; I won't have to explain my hatred for Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers" movie for anyone who has read the book.&nbsp; Anyone who has helped thier community in any way (by joing the peace corps, enlisting in the military, or even pickin up a piece of trash) should find Verhoeven's treatment of the source material absolutely maddening. I rememebr when&nbsp;I first watched it, and felt so angry...Another guy, who's laziness doesn't approach mine apparently, wrote almost all my thoughts verbatim...I thought he was psychic or something. Of course, he's much smarter than me. Regarding Starship Troopers, his discussion is outstanding:  urlLink Thoughts on Starship Troopers  by Chris W. A must read for anyone who watched that trashy movie.   Here's another link about the false claim Verhoeven was apparently making about Starship Troopers (i.e. that it was Fascist):    urlLink HEINLEIN, VERHOEVEN, AND THE FASCISTS  by one Jim Hull   How can Robert Heinlein, the very man who wrote "Stranger In a Strange Land" (the dang free-love, hippie handbook, fer cryin out loud), be called Fascist is beyond me.   Anyway. That's the end of today's stream of consciousness.&nbsp; Good night!

      ...this is my fist day posting, and here I am...mere hours after saying I wasn't gonna be using it much and I'm posting another frivolous post. whoopee.   So I just watched  urlLink In America . Neat movie. I was thinking about racism and immigration. I wonder if I would have thought it a different movie if it were about a Hatian or Mexican family rather than an Irish one. I'm not gonna post anything thought-provokingly substantial here, because I'm lazy...my mind goes way too fast for my crummy typing skills.&nbsp; But it's those sweet little girls that make that movie. Sweet little Irish girls. I wonder if they were ugly...maybe it doesn't even have to be about skin color. What if they were these little ugly, obnoxious girls? I mean, really...what's the difference between obnoxious and precocious? I think it's in how the kid looks. Anyway.   It was a great movie.&nbsp; It was less about a "coming to America"/American dream sorta story as I thought it was going to be, and more of a traditional family sorta thing.&nbsp; It was a really great movie, again.&nbsp; The preformances were great all around, and I really liked the arc of the dad.&nbsp; I really, really liked the carnival-game scene.&nbsp; Dads (all of 'em) are, by definiton, providers. How far they go--and how successful they are at it--that's what make them the dads they are. Maybe not all of our fathers carried an air conditioner flights of stairs in the middle of a heat wave, but they have all done something equivalent, or even more. The movie really hits the mark.   And of course, those little kids are just great. I can't get "Desperado" out of my head again. That song has been in my head for days at a time (off and on)&nbsp;since before I could remember (though "Hotel California" pops up now and again as well...and darn the "take it easy" Travis Tritt cover). But that little girl's rendition at the little talent show in the movie was neat. And it's stuck in my head again. But it has a slight Irish accent now...   I think I'll go find that Eagles CD of mine...it's got to be around here somewhere.

      In my first post I wrote how I signed up for this blog account only because I wanted to post a comment in someone else's. So here are those silly comments. I decided to put em up because they tell ya about me. For some reason I was absolutely giddy about learning this guy, a stranger, was from New London, CT...my sister went to school at the Coast Guard Academy (which is in New London).    urlLink spaceCADETzoom  said...  NEW LONDON! NEAT. My sister went to the Coast Guard Academy...she's a fresh butterbar right now. heh...i signed up for a silly blog account just to post that here. heh.And I'm a grad student right now too (MA political science)... and an Army ROTC cadet. I'm just absolutely flabergasted about the New London thing...I don't know why. heh.  8:32 AM    Oh, the blog owner was a political science student for his undergrad. and said somthing about how BA's in PoliSci are a dime a dozen.    urlLink spaceCADETzoom  said...   oh. and thanks for belittling my own BA in political science as a dime/dozen. just kidding. honestly though...I was supposed to be a third-generation mechanical engineer. but boy, have you talked to engineerin' students? I always figured there'd be more of them with a passion for aviation and whatnot...with heroes like Kelly Johnson, etc...It seems most of the "kids" now are just majoring in it because they're under the misconception they'll be rich (good luck finding a job in the brave new *offshoring* world). I spent 3 years as an art student because it was a talent (still owe the bank plenty for them loans)...but after finding I couldn't cross-enroll for ROTC from an art school, I transferred over to the nearest public university. I decided to drop art because I just came from the best dang art school in the country only to find myself in a mediocre one at a public university. So i finished off a BA in political science instead, because I don't write half-bad (save this incoherent post) :)that's my dime/dozen story.NEW LONDON! neat.  8:43 AM          urlLink spaceCADETzoom  said... Oh yeah...13B ! that's neat too. FA runs in my family (just like mechanical engineering)...in fact, my cousin got back from being a battery commander in korea last year. I'm seriously considering branching FA, too. eh. enough coincidence from this complete stranger...  8:53 AM       Oh, a 13bravo, which the blog owner said he was during the first Gulf War, is an artillery soldier in the US Army, in case you wanted to know. He was a cannon crewman guy. Field Artillery runs in my family...  In fact, that fresh ensign sister of mine..? She's now a fire control officer on a cutter. It seems even those of us not in Army are gunbunnies.   Artillery...here's the thing about branch. I like FA and all. But I can't get those darn John Ford cavalry movies outta my head. *You* try watchin' em and not want to branch armor. And then there's the more rational side of me that thinks MI would fit me better with my background. And then there's Engineers. Maybe I should just stay away from those combart arms, says me, since I don't think them soldiers would appreciate the fact the new LT runs too slow. Then again...finance soldiers may think I run too slow, too. eh.

      So I'm a video game nut.&nbsp; I don't want to sound like those freaks that listen to indie music and complain about artists selling out and that somehow only they're allowed to listen to their own crap.&nbsp; Like how they abhor "derivative" pop shit, not realizing thier emo shit is jsut as derivative...   I don't want to sound like some elitist "i'm-th-only-one-allowed-to-like-video-games" types. I'm not the first to play video games...I don't hold the monoply on the hobby.&nbsp; I am nowhere near a good player (at any game), nor do I know every single fascinating bit of trivia about the development of Pong.&nbsp; But here I am...   So my cousin wants to be a videogame maker when he grows up (ok, I said "grow up" he said something like "after college") I didn't actually break it to him... but he ain't a videogame guy. just cuz you play em...this&nbsp;doesn't mean anything.&nbsp; He's terrible at math.&nbsp; Not a computer guy. Has no interest in coding anything ever. Couldn't be a programmer.&nbsp; He's not an artist. No crative bone in his body.&nbsp; No technical artistic ability. So I ask...what could he possibly contribute to making a video game.&nbsp; Blank look.&nbsp; He plays them.   Heck...HE DOESN'T even play them.&nbsp; He has a gamecube (doesn't play on the PC...has never had any other system save the PS1).&nbsp; He has never played Pac Man.&nbsp; Doesn't know the siginificance of Pong. ("what's that?")&nbsp;   I think videogames have gotten to a point where everyone says they like'em.&nbsp; Kinda like in the post below...blogs are everywhere.&nbsp; Videogamers are everythwere now.&nbsp; It's not just for the dungeons/dragons crowd anymore. I think that's a good thing. But I don't like casual players getting too carried away with it is all.   (what's neat about blogs is that I'm not obligated to make a complete statement...no silly message, moral, or anything. And I'm ending the post here. woooppppeeee!)

      I don't know how this works.&nbsp; I'm just checking this sucker out. I only singned up for this silly thing because I wanted to post a comment on someone's blog...so I figured I can at least try this out. I may find it useful.   I used to have a website way back when, circa 1997. I think. Well before this whole "blog" scene popped up (everyone and thier mom now, I tell ya!)... I had a section which amounted to what is called today a web log. Me ranting, jotting stuff&nbsp;down about the day...but mostly ranting. I was a dork (still am).&nbsp; Now every ass thinks it's cool to do this. eh.   I don't think I'll put much use in this here "blog" (it still amazes me how mainstream it has become that it even has a cool name now).   It's a heck of alot easier now with these templates. I used notepad...and did html. It was a hassle, and I had frames (!) and everything. I'm not some ubercomputer guy, so I was happy with what I had. Anyway. At one point I had a shirt/mug selling thing going on. But no one bought anything. I think I sold a total of 2 stuff.   So there's been plenty of milblogs since we invaded Iraq. They're neat. Great insight in most of 'em.   I'm an army cadet. A real nobody in military terms (not a relative nobody, a REAL nobody). Theres this one politcal blog out there run by an army cadet too...and not to insult the kid but it seems he has certain delusions of grandeur concerning his ties to the army. Technically, yes, if contracted, us cadets are "in" the army. We even got the little ID card to prove it. We get miltary discounts at stores, or whatnot, and can even fly space-A (though you're in the better-to-walk-then-wait-for-a-chance-in-hell-to-get-a-seat category). But I don't think I'm a soldier yet. It's even in our creed...we're "apprentice soldiers". We're kinda in an odd spot...it's like the recruits in basic training...they're not yet fully trained soldiers. Only for ROTC cadets, our transition phase is FOUR YEARS, not nine or so&nbsp;weeks.&nbsp; (For the sake of discussion let's just squeeze by the prior service or SMP folks...in which case they got a couple years pplus thier enlisted training)   Don't get me wrong...I don't want to belittle it all. It still amazes me there are folks out there who are confused about ROTC. There' plenty that confuse it with JROTC...think we're just playing soldier. Think we're highschool students or something...or boyscouts or something. I was reading this book at the bookstore (because I'm cheap) about some former Air Force officer who served in the Clinton whitehouse (he was a fighter pilot before this) and it kinda amounted to how Clinton so completely did not understand the military. Didn't know what to do with it...and like most of America today, just kinda didn't want to underrstand it.&nbsp; The ignorance isn't malicious necesarily.&nbsp;   So there was this Coast Guard officer in the book who was talking to a white house staffer, and the staffer was completely surpsied that this officer had a Bachelor's degree.&nbsp; (he went to the Coast Guard Academy) Somehow the staffer figured that servicemen couldn't have degrees. Completely ignorant, even, of the difference between officer and enlisted. (officers, with rare exceptions, have at least a bachelor's...in fact, plenty of the enlisted have higher ed. degrees)&nbsp;   I was listening to a radio talk show (I tend to avoid them) and the host was absoutely surprised to learn you earn a bachelor's degrees at West Point. Did he somethow think cadets just wasted 4 years there or something?&nbsp; That the NCAA made a special exception to the Army and Navy teams for ol' pity's sake to get'em somehow in college Division I sports? I dunno...   There's plenty out there that's been written about the huge, growing divide between the military and civilian America.&nbsp; If you really look at it, it's ignorance on the civilian half.&nbsp; Why? because the American military is *made* of citizens...of civilians themselves.&nbsp; non-military civilans watch too much TV, they somehow think the military breeds itself via magical reproduction or something.&nbsp; The military has seen (and been a part of)&nbsp;the other side...and to them it may not be "the other side" at all.&nbsp; Non-military civilians, on the other hand, see the military as the delineated "other side".&nbsp; They've never been "there" themselves...to them it's Rambo, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket.&nbsp; To them, soldiers are cliche warrior-types.&nbsp; Or worse...soldiers aren't regular people to them, but are tied to some politcal agenda, or are robots at the command of others, devoid of thought.&nbsp;   I don't know what the point of any of this is. I had more. My brain is faster than my typing.

      So  urlLink Lucas  is on AMC right now. I know it's part of the cliche that is a teen movie, but it really pisses me off how Corey Haim is lusting after that chick from  urlLink the Goonies  not realizing Winona Ryder is right there lusting after him. I mean, really. I never really understood that overrated  urlLink Molly Ringwald  pining after Jake Ryan, hoping that "someway, somehow" he'd drop the cheerleader and look at her...when she won't dang look at frikkin Anthony Michael Hall the same damn way (yes, I know the irony of what happened between the two beyond the sets of John Hughes movies). I mean, if her damn standards or so damn high, why the hell does she expect someone else's to be low?  Hell, the cliche doesn't even work in  urlLink Lucas . Winona Ryder is hot. And her character is sweet. Not that  urlLink the Goonies  chick is bad (and her  urlLink Lucas  character is sweet and well-intentioned as well)...I'm just saying, if dang Winona Ryder is throwin herself at you...  ...I wonder where that  urlLink Goonies  chick ended up. I looked her up on  urlLink imdb . She kinda  urlLink didn't do much  outside of these two movies. She's probably a soccermom now. For all I know she lives on my street.  We know what happened to Corey Haim...  You know, this post sucks. I rant about cliche, all the while sidestepping the fact that this very rant is of the same tree...eh.

      John of ARRGHH! has posted  urlLink a quick note  concerning the treatment of the Darby family after the whistle blowing of the Abu Ghraib problems. He links the ABCnews story  urlLink here  (all links in my posts open a new window). SPC Darby (now SGT) was the soldier who blew the whistle. His family has been harassed by neighbors since the incident.  Obviously, the jerks messing with the Darby's are a buncha idiots. SGT Darby did the right thing, he should be applauded. Most sane soldiers would agree with that...  The backlash against his family, I would suspect, are from the "well-meaning" couch commandos and armchair generals that wave flags on their cars (or SUV's) and thus think they've "done their part." Those folks don't realize they're worse than the nuts calling soldiers "baby-killers." What, the American fighting man shouldn't be held to high standards? We should look the other way when gross injustices like Abu Ghraib are committed? Those idiots screwing with the Darby family think they're "for" the troops...not realizing how patronizing they are.  What SGT Darby did was what was expected of him as an NCO in the US Army (even if he wasn't officially one at the time). What the harassing neighbors don't realize is that the US Army is the most potent, powerful fighting force the world has ever seen. But it is also the most compassionate, and professional. Aberrant behavior as that depicted by the sickos at Abu Ghraib should not be tolerated. And as an enlisted man in this professional fighting force, it was Darby's duty to not tolerate such crap. It's like the oft-heard honor code cadets recite: future officers do not lie, cheat, steal, commit any act of intentional dishonesty, or  tolerate those who do .  To expect anything less is to not accept that our US Army is indeed the finest display of service in the world. A brief anecdote I remember hearing (I think I saw it on the History Channel), recalls a tanker in the TC hatch of an Abrams rolling by destroyed Iraqi vehicles during the first Gulf War. Iraqis had dropped their weapons and had their arms in the air.They were screaming and begging, "Don't shoot me! Don't shoot me!" waving white flags and wearing soiled uniforms. The tanker said perplexed, "What? We're  Americans ...we don't shoot our prisoners."  Have atrocities been committed under the American flag? Sadly, yes they have. But in any way should they be tolerated or even written off as "normal" stuff that happens in war? Not in this Army.  I remember another article I was reading in the LA Times a month ago or so. I'm sorry I don't have the specific reference. But in it, there were soldiers being prosecuted for pocketing large sums of cash. In a  urlLink Three Kings -esque episode, the soldiers had found ammo boxes filled with  millions  of American dollars in several buildings after the road to Baghdad. Apparently they had stumbled onto a large money cache of Saddam's. Everyone was joking, throwing around the loose bills. The platoon leader and First Sergeant came by (a fresh college-grad LT and a company's veteran NCO, respectively). A soldier threw a wad of cash at the LT and joked, "Here ya go, sir..." The LT and First Sergeant themselves did not pocket anything, but joked along and generally turned away at the suggestion cash be pocketed.  Higher had the ammo boxes of cash rounded up, though it was revealed there were missing ones. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were pocketed. Certain cans were buried to hide evidence. Thoughts of mortgages, car payments, and babies on the way had filled these soldiers minds. But it is argued that Saddam's cache of millions was obviously stolen, if indirectly, from the Iraqi peoples. Later, a soldier, now stateside, out of Iraq and consumed with guilt, confessed. Several soldiers were prosecuted. The LT and First Sergeant were among those disciplined. As an upstart 21 year old middle management type, would you have had the fortitude to step up and take control in such a tempting situation? It is  expected  in the role of an average platoon leader. It is  prosecutable  if he fails in this regard. Leadership, as shown in this case, is different than management.  Or let's take this beyond leadership: as a young family-man with a wife and a newborn baby, would you have confessed to pocketing the cash of a despotic dictator? Knowing full well it was a prosecutable offense, and that your sole household income was the average junior enlisted man's yearly base pay of less than $18,000 a year?  In a related note, there's been numerous cases of DEA and police corruption in the "war on drugs." In one example, of countless others: on average, half of all cops convicted as a result of FBI-led corruption cases between 1993 and 1997 were convicted for drug-related offenses. ( urlLink source )  Yet, have you ever asked yourself why there hasn't been one such case within the US Coast Guard? The US Coast Guard, for one example, seized 55,000 kilos of cocaine in 2000 (and it has increased in recent years). ( urlLink source ) This branch of the US military has acquitted itself professionally--from the enlisted men and NCO's boarding ships, to the commissioned officers leading the way. I mean, imagine: they fight pirates. Pirates! In the 21st century! Despite such novelty of purpose, their professionalism is held to standard. The Coast Guard, the small, under-funded,  urlLink red-haired stepbrother of the Armed Forces , holds the line. Know that its professionalism isn't something to be necessarily applauded...it is to be  expected  of them, as with any branch of our US military.  I think, again, this goes into the divide between civilian and military that is growing in our world. It is not necessarily one borne of animosity, but is detrimental in ignorance as well. The flag waving "Rah, rah rah!" types can be just as guilty as the "baby-killer" finger pointers. This also ties into my  urlLink professionalism/officership discussion  from before. Similar in illustration, when my grandfather was a "Third Lieutenant," he was responsible for his men, even as the quasi-officer he was (see my family stories post:  urlLink The Great American Novel ). When things were dire, when every thing was disbanded and the realities of Japanese occupation were solid, the "Third Lieutenant" walked home straight from the battlefield,  after  addressing his men.  What SGT Darby did was what other NCO's and officers failed at in that MP company. Many see the idea that the Abu Ghraib problem as "institutional" or a case of "bad apples" as mutually exclusive arguments. They aren't. But unlike what some would lead you to believe, the breakdown in the "institutional" side wasn't because of the evils of the US Army, but that of the failure of this specific chain of command. The problem was that these bad apples also had bad leadership--in the US Army, the leadership is responsible for it all. The " urlLink task, conditions and standards " were not in place. The task was not emphasized. The conditions were incompetently bereft. But most of all, the  standards  were not set. This was all a failure in leadership. And, yes, every 21-year old, fresh college grad LT in the US military is responsible for this.  The CO in this MP company had a history of "conduct unbecoming" an officer (in few other fields outside the commissioned officer corps is such a thing legally prosecutable: can you lose  your  job for adultery, lying or even fraternization?). Yet beyond the disgraceful conduct of this CPT, while PFC England was posing with naked prisoners, where was the platoon sergeant? Where was the LT? All of these are/were prosecuted, even if they weren't present. Indeed, there were NCO's present in the damning pictures themselves. Darby, a  specialist , not even an NCO at the time, stood up and did the right thing.  Duty is not easy. Sacrifice is inherent in service. And there are high standards in our US military that civilians often do not understand. Don't fault SGT Darby, the  one  American soldier who did his job.

      There's been a debate going on about the relevance of videogames. Recently, in  urlLink CBFTW's blog  (I don't think I need to tell you about that site. It's very popular, and one of the most interesting viewpoints of any war ever put in words), the author remarked on  urlLink his surprise  about a computer game that simulated the events of a particular firefight he was in. There were comments made concerning "disrespect" of videogames, et cetera. It offers some interesting discusion:    urlLink spaceCADETzoom  said... kumawar [the game in question] has been around a while now. The original idea was to release mission/levels periodically to mirror "real life" events. But the game engine sucks, and it is genertally seen as a failure.  This debate about "disrespect" of videogame topics has been around for a while now too. How you look at it really depends on how you look at interactive media. If you respect it as an artform, you realize it's no different than movies based on real events. No one saw Saving Pricvate Ryan as being dirsrespectful...but did anyone feel guilty when their adrenaline was pumping when Tom Hanks stormed the beach? The audience was living vicariously through a celuloid character in an event that really happened.  The problem in interactive media is if you see the medium as childish and imamture. But remember, movies themselves were (and often still are) considered lowbrow and for the uncultured.  I don't want to bore you all with statistics...but the average PC gamer is well into his 20's or 30's, and has a bachelor's degree. Hardly the whiny 8 year old who dpeneds on soccormoms to buy thier pokemon game. The console market (ie playstation, et al) is another story, though...  True, there are a lot of childish video games out there, targeted for kids. But there are also childish movies...Please don't lump together all forms of interactive media as childish or irrelevant.  11:39 PM    urlLink spaceCADETzoom said... Oh, in case I was too ambiguous...kumawar sucks...and they're rippin you off if you try and buy anything from them.  I don't necesarily doubt the makers are armchair-generals, with not a one veteran on the dev team (there could be, but statistically, there probably aren't). Overall, the kumawar example is a shoddy product, and many have complained it's exploitive.  That said, there are also plenty of couch-commandos that are products of seeing the Blackhawk Down movie, or reading too many Tom Clancy novels. I don't think Spielberg was being exploitve with Saving PVT ryan, but there are game developers out there that are similarly respectful, as well.  11:50 PM     The comments piled up, until there was one relevant comment by a poster named Bane:   urlLink BANE  said... CBFTW, I didn't get an impression as to whether you enjoyed the game, or whether you thought it was crap. I can't play a war game myself, until they allow collateral damage and the full-on craziness that goes on. The 'Black Hawk Down' game was totally worthless, because it penalized you for shooting civilians...heck, we stacked em up like cordwood.  8:13 AM  I replied, and the conversation continued:      urlLink spaceCADETzoom  said... Bane,You've just single-handedly destroyed my argument about maturity in interactive media. heh.  Of course, what I said about couch-commandos and armchair-generals, though....  Thanks.  9:35 AM      urlLink BANE  said... space, don't you get it? If you want to have a realistic WW2 sim, and you leave out the fire-bombing, the ovens and camps, and the A-Bomb, you're just playing 'Mario With A Machine Gun'. If you go all PC, then you can't call it a sim. My son who is a Marine recruiter, shows his prospects dread-violent video from the 'net to scare them off. If they can hang, THEN they talk. The Marines only need a few Good Men.  10:57 AM      urlLink spaceCADETzoom  said... Bane, That's a sound enough argument. But you were complaining about getting "penalized for shooting civilians" in the Black Hawk Down game. Did you somehow think that shooting civilians gets you a pat on the back in the real world? I can assure you the penalty is much more than "reducing one's hi-score," but there's a penalty all the same. There are games out there that simulate your fire bombing and A-bombs. One of the finist simulations of all time, Steal BEasts, simulates the M1A1 Abrams on the battlefield. It's all rather sterile...there aren't any body parts flying through the air, no babies to shoot your coax at. In fact, I don't even rememebr seeing any dismounts in the game. Is this game politically correct, in your opinion, not worthy of your approval? Granted, tank warfare has changed some in the urban streets of Iraq, for example, but by and large, COld War era tank battles are sterile by your standards...  When I was talking about maturity or accuracy in interactive media, I wasn't necesarilly talking baout the Medal of HOnor series, or Black Hawk Down. Judging from your comments, I think we can agree Black Hawk Down the game wasn't that great a game. I found it fairly immature (but certainly not for the "civilian penalty" you noted). Interactive media isn't limited to run-and-gun gameplay. Novalogic's Black Hawk Down game is the equivalent of Rambo or any summer-action flick...not the book it took its name from. Medal of HOnor games are the equivalent of Dirtty Dozen or other action movies *set* in WWII, not documentaries about WWII.  Maybe you're thinking war is always like Full Metal Jacket or Platoon. Or maybe all conflicts end up like My Lai. But they're really not most of the time. ANd we certainly shouldn't applaud and feel cheated when we can't shoot the civilians in games. Because in the real world, at least in our military (yes, even Marines), we can't go shooting civilians either...  Your son shows potentials a violent video? Well, I'm sorry, sir, but it takes a lot more than being shown violent video to make a fine rifleman. I'm sure your son will attest to that.  Thanks for the discussion. I don't mean to be confrontational, it's not my intention to be argumentative.  8:07 PM      urlLink spaceCADETzoom  said... Oh, oops, I left you on the hook there about games that feature A-bombs and firebombing, huh? Sorry. For the A-bomb, there's a relatively recent flight sim out theere whose name I can't think of right now. Again, it's rather sterile, if you're looking for blood &amp; guts...well, it's basically drop the bomb, high-tail it out of there, big flash...  As for firebombing, pick up any ol' WWII flight sim. There was a Mighty 8th B-17 sim a while back that has held up nicely to today's graphic standards. It's certainly tough, and gives you some respect for those bomber crews. You can be a gunner, the pilot, bombadier, etc.  One of my favorite games of all time was 1942: Pacific Air War. It was this game that took my ambivalence towards Geroge HW Bush (senior) and made hime one of my fave presidents...anyone who piloted a torpedo bomber in WWII has my respect. Try and find 1942, get yourself in a seat of a TBF Avenger and take off, navigate, and line-'er-up to a Jap carrier...great game.  All in all, you're not gonna find "frebombinbg or a-bombs" in first-person shooters...in run-and-gun gameplay. A-Bombs are certainly not close air support options. If you see an A-Bomb dropping, umm...I think it's safe to say you are "danger close". heh.  8:27 PM      I think overall, interactive media ain't quite there yet in the eyes of many. As long as those soccermoms are buying up Pokemon or whatever thier brats find fashionable nowadays, those soccermoms will consistently believe that it is crap. Every once and awhile they'll buy little Timmy the latest iteration of Mortal Kombat or Doom, be utterly shocked about the violence, and complain to CT's own fine Joe Lieberman...but that's another story. Violent...games...must fight urge....to blow away my classmates....arrgh. Bad company, 'till the day I die. All and all, heads up asses...   [UPDATE 4:54PM]  Bane has responded further on the comments section of CBFTW's blog. Here's the exchange:      urlLink Bane  said... You may have misread me. Marines (all the ones I know, anyway) pass around photos and videos all of the time to each other, PC to PC. The author of this blog mentioned the cameras they all carry, and there is quite a collection of gore and war building up out there. My son shows these videos to his more gung ho prospects who may have never seen a db and wondered how the heck so much blood could be in there, or had someone talking to them with a mouth wound pouring out a constant stream down their chin. We've seen that, but these kids haven't. He never lies to them, and they are joining up in bunches. My son makes a relationship with their families, too. He is brutally frank and honest, and I would like to think the glimpses of war he's shown some of the less stout hearted kept someone from going in who couldn't hack.  As to games, and the 'shooting civilians' bit, if some gunner rips a civilian by accident in real life, does everything stop? That's what I meant...and the line between civ and combatant is pretty fucking thin in the sandy parts of the world.  And I've pulled triggers as an 11B and as a cop...cop games suck, too.  12:21 AM      urlLink spaceCADETzoom  said... Fair enough, bane.  ...but...you will realize I am slightly frightened by the your "shooting civilans" bit with reference to your claim that you were were a cop. I'm particularly frightened you've noted you have "pulled triggers" as a cop. umm... :)  And I've also read some stuff on your blog (it's linked to your profile). I hope you don't think I'm some PC pussy or anything, but boy...you were a cop, you say?  Forgive me, I tend to be paranoid. Got a crazy gun-nut in me that stocks up on .45 and .223 (cops in certain states tend not to like us uppity civilans carrying rifles that shoot itty-bitty .223). So don't mind me if I'm scared silly of cops who are ticked they can't shoot civilans in videogames...  Peace be to you, brother  4:24 AM      urlLink Bane  said... Son, I am very drunk at this moment...dude, there are people in your neighborhood you would pay me big bucks to shoot...tonight. If you read their rap sheets and knew what they have been CONVICTED of already...you wouldn't let them watch your dog, let alone live within 50 miles of your kid. Trust me.  9:00 AM   I'm not quite sure what to make about being keen on pictures about death. Though, I can understand the Marine recruiter's actions trying to dissuade the gung-ho types that may not actually want to see the realities of war.  But about the cops lamenting they can't shoot noncombatants...that's kinda creepy, no? I think this goes into my discussion about  urlLink guns  in a previous post. At the end of that post I make reference to the idea that we ought to be scared of madmen, not guns necesarily. These madmen could have axes, chainsaws, anthrax, be behind the wheels of cars, or...have guns (or even have a police badge). It ain't the gun itself (nor, I guess, the police badge).  I don't care if I'm some squared away steel-chested tanker or SF officer in the future, cops like that scare me. I'd rather get AK's shooting in my general direction than find a cop pissed they can't shoot digital civilians. Bad company, 'till the day I die, sure...but you'll forgive me if I see trigger-happy cops and run scared like a sissy.

      I found a comment in my  urlLink An Officer And A Gentleman  post from an interesting individual. He is a professor (though, maybe he isn't truly a "professor," and in fact he meant the moniker in an unofficial way…I'm truly dense, so I'm not sure). Anyway, he has one  urlLink post  on his very interesting  urlLink blog  that got me thinking.. . He begins the post with: Welcome back. I see the rows are still empty, but thankfully, this is a lecture that others can come back to review prior to any exam.  I've always wondered if Profs actually do realize I'm not there. I've often wondered if the lectures are the same between those in empty auditoriums or packed classrooms. Do you college professors feel hurt, ambivalent, proud, happy or sad when you have all the seats full or empty? Are the lectures more engaging if the Prof feels the class is insterested? Does he care? I find my undergrad classes over the years have been rather impersonal. I wonder if they take it personally when we students don't show up. We often don't show up because we have the notion that the professors don't notice. Obviously, this can be taken to an extreme…it boggles the mind how blatant some undergrads are about having never shown up an entire term and wondering why they have poor test scores. (of course, I've seen the opposite as well…folks passing with A's in courses they've never been to. This is more possible in freshmen classes: I've literally been to only one lecture in a Biology 101 class…finishing off with an A in the course)  Well, the Bryan Singer  urlLink movies  have catapulted the X-Men to mainstream (read: non-comic geek) appeal, so I feel alright in discussing the following in an open forum.  I've always wondered what Professor X's background was. Really. Here's Professor Xavier, the big cheese at some New England prep school. Sure, the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters has extracurricular programs regarding those spiffy superpowers, but the basis of it all is a solid education. Graduates have gone on to colleges and universities and so forth. But what were Professor X's degrees in?  Charles Xavier must have had an interesting time as a student. He's the world's most powerful telepath. I've often assumed this was the basis for the fortune and technology that his X-Men rely on…how can the most powerful telepath not be rich? I'm not necessarily talking about nefarious maneuverings to unfairly become rich…but surely, the reading/controlling minds thing must have had some play in bankrolling the neat costumes, facilities, the hypersonic jet that launches from an underground runway. Tuition of a hundred or so odd kids (plenty of them from non-rich families and thier tuitions waived or from some financial aid program) can't possibly go that far, can it? Telepathy and idea "borrowing" had to have been in play there, no? I mean, it's a hypersonic jet that has stealth capabilities, can outperform F-16s and carry a boatload of people at the same time(!).  So what were Charles Xavier's school years like? I don't think he was a cheater…it's not in his character. Plagiarism is one of the most serious crimes in academia…and I'm sure that's not a road the future pusher of the "peaceful coexistence of Homosapiens and Homosapiens Superior" dream would have taken. But one wonders how such an ability to read minds played out then.  According to the movie's continuity, Jean Grey is a doctor (Not in the comic books! I was  this  close to walking out the theater in a huffy geek fit). I'm not sure if she's a medical doctor or that of something else. It's implied she has some genetic background, though. Anyway, she went through Xavier's school, and went off to higher learning. One would assume that's what Xavier's contribution is: helping young mutants adjust to the often hateful world and become productive citizens (outside of the fighting evil thing, of course).  Anyway, what am I getting at? Well, here's probably the most frightening professor of all time, Charles Xavier…HE CAN READ YOUR MIND! I don't think I'd like to be a student of his… Though, I have found experience of tenured professors has often been adequate enough for them to rather "telepathically" know things about thier students. Then again, perhaps this is a gauge of the individual professors. There are profs that you like or dislike, ones that are detatched, ones that are engaging...ones that grade way too easy ("I pulled off an A? What? Does he realize how stupid I am?")...Anyway. Some Professors rock. Some, not so much. But like Professor X, they are "helping young mutants adjust to the often hateful world and become productive citizens (outside of the fighting evil thing, of course)."  Maybe I'm talking about teachers in general. Or maybe it ain't that idealistic. Particularly in higher learning academia and specifically the research universities. But the effect is there.  Okay, now that I have totally and completely nerded out your computer screens…

      I stumbled by an interesting blog yesterday of a  urlLink young lady from North Carolina . The girl is dating a West Point cadet. She's keen on Z28's too...rock on.  I posted previously on my  urlLink Annapolis aspirations . And as much as us "other" cadets would say we made the "right choice" and may even find ringthumpers particularly snobby...I must say there is still a tinge of envy. Envy is too strong a word. But it is there. Then again, maybe the Brown or Harvard students who're ROTC cadets don't see it at all. heh.  By the way, I said this in my officership discussion  urlLink below ...but it holds particular relevancy to the topic at hand as well: You should really go read  urlLink Absolutely American by David Lipsky . I could say it's about West Point, but that would describe the book in smaller terms than what it is actually about. Even if you're not interested...read the book anyway, it's a great book regardless of what any preconceptions you may have about it. If you really look at it, it isn't about the military at all. It says some stuff about officership and leadership, but it also says plenty about life in general.  Anyway, it's pretty common knowldedge the military has had retention problems of its officers at O-3 levels. It's also pretty common to find West Point grads having the highest attrition rate among these separations. ROTC grads have a significantly smaller attrition rate and OCS folks even less. This isn't all too surprising. I have my theories.  For one, ringthumpers (don't worry, my sister is one as well, so this ain't coming from thin air) can have a tendency to be all hooah'ed out by graduation. They've spent 4 years in garison, and unlike any other garison-time the world over, one can superficially conclude it's all terribly frat-like at these Academies (I'm sure it ain't, but hey, such are outsider conclusions). Regardless, there seems to be a higher cynic rating in the process. ROTC cadets, on the other hand, are "normal" college kids. Outside of PT, we probably wear a uniform once a week. We only really have one big summer exercise the four years (unless you wanna go to Airborne school, et al.), an FTX or two per semester, and training pretty much one day a week. We have a chance to refresh, and get away for a while from the military thing. Even the operational, non-cadet Army isn't as structured in one's personal life as the Academies. Academy kids, for 4 years they  live  military. Though life-encompassing and much more exhaustive in its complexity, thier experience is like basic training...only cadets are cadets for four years.   What I find funny is that MI has pretty high consistent atrition of its O-3's. Also, Field Artillery. heh. You want my theory on FA attrition? I think it's because it has all the tough work that the other combat arms have...but less of the glamour and esprit de corps. It's still got more esprit de corps than most the other branches of the Army, but combat arms is a particularly taxing field (get deployed plenty, get the boots muddy more often, separated from the family more, etc). As for MI, I think most intelligence folks have BA's in government or business or other such fields. They get wooed easier by the private sector as they're the talkers...they think they can get jobs easier. That, and plenty branch MI thinking it as a stepping stone into civilian-sector stuff like the CIA or Gestap....errr....I mean FBI. The private sector is a siren call for the sharp kids and consistent high school high-achievers (i.e. Academy cadets). What surprises me is the high retention rate of AG and Chem Corps officers. heh. My guess? Private sector ain't so receptive to these folks.  Anyway, OCS folks, particularly in the Army, are very often folks with years as prior enlisted. Thus, they're a different kind of dedication.  You know, I wanted to discuss this further. With particular emphasis on my thoughts on West Point (flattering, I assure you). But i think my ADD is kicking in. Or ADHD. Or whatever it's called. I think maybe the folks who made up the title of Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder were a bunch a nuts who couldn't makeup thier minds. heh. Later.

      So I ordered that clutch slave cylinder for my Ducati Monster that I mentioned the other week. The installation was simple enough. But the bleeding was a bitch. I've never bled a clutch before, and the instructions that came in the box wasn't the best in the world...it kinda assumed anyone who'd buy an aftermarket clutch slave cylinder must be some gearhead and thus doesn't need clear instructions on bleeding. My father helped me out. Actually, he pretended he knew more than he did, generally made a mess, cursed profusely and was in the process of quitting. I fixed it. He pushed me aside again, and now says he fixed it himself. God bless my pops, and all the great dads out there.  The pressure wasn't strong enough. The problem was that we missed a simple little bolt tightening. I caught it pretty quickly, but pops...well, idiot sons can't possibly know more than thier fathers.  It turned out well enough.  I bought a Garand last year through the CMP. It needed some cleaning and whatnot when it arrived in the box...  By the way, if you want a piece of history, I highly suggest you all look into the Civilan Marksmanship Program for thier M1 Garands. You can choose to get an actual WWII issue Garand. The surplus rifle you get may very well have had played a role in liberating the world from Fascism. All you need is to be a member of some shooting club (the NRA doesn't count...but there are clubs out there you can get in for free). If you're a veteran or currently in the military (DD-214 or even an active military ID will suffice as proof) you can waive the target shooting activity requirement. Otherwise you can simply go on down to a local range, ask around about any target shooting...In fact, the club you join would probably have information on how to get with fellow members and put a couple rounds of .30-06 in some paper for you to qualify. The Garand is only around 500 bucks. A great deal considering Springfield Armory has one for over a thousand bucks (it's a ripoff, you ask me...even thier M1As...I wish the CMP sold M14's). And those Springfield Armory's ain't got the history. Nutcases and felons need not apply, but the CMP sends the Garand to you straight to your doorstep...no need for an FFL or even a Curio &amp; Relic license (background check still done, obviously). Not to bore you, but the CMP was created way back when by the government to keep the skills up of us citizen-soldiers. I'm trying to save up for an 1903 Springfield, as they sell those too.  Anyway, pops "helped" me out cleaning it too. Guess whose cabinet the Garand is in now. Hint: it ain't in mine.  eh. What are you gonna do?  It was a good day. My mom says I'll probably look back fondly on this day ten years from now or so. heh.

      This ain't a political blog. I've refrained from telling you all to vote for a particular candidate not because I have some deep commitment for balance or have the all-too-American ideal of political apathy. I just don't think I'll change anyone's mind is all. And I'm not arrogant enough to think I'm the guy to be telling you anything...I'm not some star of some movie, or anything. heh. Honestly though, the following is not a strike or cheer for any of the candidates. I'm not making a statement on the issue of the election in November. Enough text has been typed about that worldwide. (Besides, my relationship with the Army, or rather specifically, my continued  future  relationship with the Army would preclude me from such overt political displays of endorsement) This discussion is merely on "officership." And responsibility.  That said, there's been plenty debate about the whole Kerry swiftboat stuff. If you don't know what I'm talking about, skip this post and continue onto another post of another date below (I promise you'll be entertained somewhere beyond today's...I'm particularly fond of my  urlLink family stories  post and  urlLink top gun  post)  I think  urlLink John of ARRGHHH! on his blog  has a very interesting viewpoint of the whole thing, that is definitely worth a read. (Go ahead and read it first. The link opens up a new window. I'll wait. I swear.) I've visited his blog for a while now. It doesn't hurt he's got a Field Artillery background and that he's a gun-nut like me (I guess that's being redundant, huh?) hooah. King of Battle!  Also take a gander at the comments section of the link I provided...he has some interesting things about the Bush's Air Guard time that I've always had but never got around to voicing. It's uncannily verbatim of what I've said in the past, aloud. Some choice stuff:  What does it matter if Bush went to combat or not? Most people in uniform, did not. Draftees were over-represented in the combat elements, to be sure. Still, most people in uniform did not see much, if any combat. He joined the Air Guard. He learned to fly a dangerous aircraft, the Convair F102 fighter, which, by the way, carried nuke missiles, the Douglas MB-1 Genie. I know something about nukes, having been in nuke-capable artillery units and in the 'special weapons' business. Slugs don't stay in the PRP, the Personnel Reliability Program.  The F102 is I believe the only aircraft Bush was signed off on to fly. It's an aircraft that was designed to get up fast, go high fast, and nuke incoming Soviet bomber formations. It's not a fighter as we think of fighters, much less a fighter-bomber. It's mission (and this is why the Guard had most of them) was the air defense of the United States. The AF experimented with either the F102 or it's follow-on, the F106, and found them useless in Vietnam-style warfare. You don't just hop from the cockpit of an F102 into an F4, and go bombing in the Central Highlands. There is at least a six-month transition phase between aircraft of those types - as the pilots not only have to learn how to fly the new aircraft, they have to learn how to use it, tactically. First in straight pilot stuff, and then in two ship formations, then in larger formations. It's not a simple process. At the same time - believe it or not - the war was winding down, the AF had all the F4, Skyhawk, Skyraider, and Thud-drivers it needed. The mission to defend the US was still considered important. The AF is looking ahead to an impending draw-down. Okay, so Bush didn't get to go to combat, even if he asked - the AF simply didn't need him badly enough to want to spend the effort to retrain him. The situation is analgous to an Army Air Defense Artilleryman. There was no credible air threat in South Vietnam. Does that mean the Duck Hunters are somehow tainted for not 'getting into combat'? No. Last I heard, no nuke submariners served in combat positions during Vietnam. They were too busy stooging around under the polar ice caps. Chicken? I don't think so.  Another point - not everyone who asks for a combat billet, gets one. I sat out Desert Storm because the Chief of Staff, Army, decided that the Observer-Controllers at the National Training Center were too valuable in their current capacity than adding them as 'padding' to the deploying force. All requests for assignment overseas were denied. I tried working a few angles. It didn't work. I am also getting tired (because I apparently just don't get it) at the DID NOT SERVE and DID NOT SEE COMBAT theme.  [...]Most people in uniform did not see combat. Less than 3% of the total population of the United States was in uniform, and maybe 30% of those saw sustained combat. In the target population of draft age, what, 15% actually got called to the colors? This ain't up for you all to give three big cheers for Bush or anything. I'm just tired of folks who've never been in the miltary talk about the Air National Guard like it's somehow not the Air Force. I'm sure there are vets out there that may have stuff to say about it all, but I find, most often, the opposite kind of folks comment on this most viciously. You see some Marine in Oceanside walking down the street...do you spit at him because he's not in Iraq at this very moment? Or, let's go on over to Los Al...there's a "weekend warrior" past the gate...he's not a "real" soldier, right?  John of ARRGHHH! has brought up some interesting issues that have been bugging me about the bigger issue at hand. I posted a comment in another person's blog in which I defended the ideal of comissioned officers in the US military. A very many people are ignorant about what a comission is, and many confuse it with simple soldierin.' In my very  urlLink very first post  (you'll have to wade down thorough it) I went off on the whole military/civilian growing divide. One issue is that people confuse what an officer is. I think there's a bit of word inflation going around that is contributing to the confusion (i.e. police "officers", et al.). Thus true comissioned officership is not held in high regard by the ignorant. Among the ideas of inherent professionalism in the officer corps ("Professional" is seeing quite of bit of word inflation as well, by the way), John of ARRGHHH! notes:  In this republic and in any republic that does not want to be a banana republic, the officer corps of the military must be as deferent to the civil authority as law and custom provide. Which means, we don't get to pick our wars, and just go home when we want to. Or serve when we want to. We go when we're sent. Where we're sent. For the reason we are sent...(Ibid.) He goes on into stuff that's irrelevant to our discussion. Folks don't especially understand this one point John has made about officer's duties and responsibilities. I said something like that before also. I swear that guy is channeling (down to the "banana republic" line...are there bugs in here?). But, I posted the following comment in another blog where folks were commenting on the whole Kerry swiftboat issue:      urlLink spaceCADETzoom  said... I got nothing to contribute about this debate. I don't care one way or another about these swiftboat vets "outing" Kerry. For the purpose of this comment, I am not for or against Kerry or Bush.  But I take note with rab's comment. rab said: "Even if I believed that Kerry committed war crimes when he was following orders as a United States soldier...the fact that he came back to congress and testified about it and marched against the war would and should override it."  Kerry wasn't a merely a soldier. (He was a sailor...but semantics ain't the problem). He was a comissioned officer. "Following orders" may fly if you're a private or seaman (emphasis on *MAY*), but it certainly doesn't stand for jack as an officer. 21 year old ensigns (or 2LT's) are responsible for thier men. Everyone from generals to 0-1's have responsibilities beyond themselves or thier peers. Non-military folk don't get the whole "responsibility" thing involved with officers. Comissioned officers can be prosecuted for things they did, things they didn't do, things they didn't prevent, and things they didn't even know about, but should have.  Read up on Japanese war crimes. With specific examination of the fact those prosecuted were almost without exception officers. Even if it was enlisted soldiers doing the specific crime in question...the officers had responsibilty. Even the specific crimes my great-aunt was a sworn witness to in the trials...an officer was prosecuted, not necesarily the Japanese soldier who comited the act. (I had a huge post about old family stories on my blog the other week)If Kerry was part of some war crime, he should be sent to jail. Protesting war after the fact doesn't "override" anything. He doesn't have to be prosecuted for taking part of a crime itself, but if he knew about it, as an officer in the US Navy, he had a responsibilty to do somehting about it. *That's* prosecutable itself  I'm not saying he was involved in any war crimes (in fact, I doubt he saw one).  I guess it's hard to explain what comissioned officers are. I'm sorry if I'm not clear. Just, please, don't go off spouting about what negligible and/or criminal acts are permissible or what can be "overriden." It cheapens it all, and is ignorant in general  Thanks. No disrespect intended to you. This all goes into responsibility. And tellingly, for example, a comissioned officer's responsibilities to his soldiers does not end when the whistle blows. Is this the way middle management works in the corporate world? Of course not.  "Rab," the person who I was addressing, responded. I replied to his response. I post it below.  Rab said, "just because Kerry was an officer...doesn't mean that he didn't follow orders during the war. How absurd. Do you really think each and every officer determines their own war plans?"  spaceCADETzoom said...  I didn't say that. Re-read please, and lose the defensiveness chip on your shoulder. I wasn't tearing into Kerry. I was tearing into misconceptions of officership.  Shooting civilians is not "war plans". I think you think that officers are somehow incapable of making moral decisions...when in fact, that is thier job. If some 4-star general were to say "shoot that baby." The 21 year old Lieutenant platoon leader is responsible if one of his privates does so. (as is the general, et al.) There was nothing "absurd" in officer responsibility other than your ignorance of it.  Keep in mind I never said Kerry comited any war crimes. My contention was in your wrong conlusion "if he had".  Rab, to make use a better hypothetical example:  A 22 year old 2LT platoon leader is on trial because one of the soldiers in his platoon killed a baby. For the sake of illustration let's make the killer a 30 year old sergeant named Doe. The defense attorney for the officer (the LT) has limited choices in defense. One defense: the LT was incapable of knowing or preventing the act. This would require the LT to be completely new...having just rotated in, and is new to the platoon...for example, he just got to the platoon as the act was taking place. "Captain so-and-so, the company commander, said to kill the baby," is NOT a defense for this LT. Neither is an adequate defense that "SGT Doe killed the baby without my order." Indeed, even the "new to the platoon" argument may not work. Japanese General Yamashita was hung even though most of the atrocities that he was prosecuted for happened *before* he arrived.  If the LT *should* have been able to prevent the crime, he is guilty. Such is the responsibility of officership.  Furhtermore, cases like that have happened. To keep using the Japanese examples...young 20-seomethings, Japanese junior officers, were sent to jail for the beheading of American POW airmen. Even though they were "ordered" to. There are cases where junior officers in the same position, having been ordered to behead a POW, being sent to jail even if they hadn't the stomach for doing the beheading themselves. Some MAJ or COL wanted a beheaded POW, the LT doesn't want to do it...some NCO does it. The LT is still cashiered as a criminal all the same. You should really go read  urlLink Absolutely American by David Lipsky . I could say it's about West Point, but that would describe the book in smaller terms than what it is actually about. Keep your eye on LTC Keirsey in the narrative for this "responsibilty" ideal, in play. Even if you're not interested...read the book anyway, it's a great book regardless of what any preconceptions you may have about it. If you really look at it, it isn't about the military at all. It says some stuff about officership and leadership, but it also says plenty about life in general.  Anyway, all of this, again, wasn't about Kerry or Bush necesarily...but more about the military. I just think the whole topic is fascinating and most are just ignorant of it all...the growing and lamentable divide. This wasn't the first, and this probably won't be the  last  time I ramble on about it.  I don't think I have to go into too much why this is important to me. It has implications in a lot of the ignorant things I've heard about "what's wrong" with the military in regard to Abu Ghraib and My Lai. Though, this topic holds the most importance for me because, if you recall, I am an Army cadet.  I am an Army Cadet. Soon I will take an oath to become Army Officer committed to defending the values which make this nation great. Honor is my touchstone. I understand mission first and people always.  I am the past -- the spirit of those warriors who have made the final sacrifice.  I am the present -- the scholar and apprentice soldier enhancing my skills in the science of warfare and the art of leadership.  But above all, I am the future -- the future warrior leader of the United States Army. May God give me the compassion and judgment to lead and the gallantry in battle to win.  I will do my duty Crap. Here comes Richard Gere in his dress whites and goldwings (dang  urlLink fighter pilots , they get all the chicks). Now, cue the 80's soundtrack....  Love lift us up where we belong, Where the eagles cry On a mountain high Love lift us up where we belong, Far from the world we know, Up where the clear winds blow...  Darn you naval aviators! I got that crap song in my head now. (Yes, I know I'm a dork. Stop making fun of me, I can hear you)

      So there's this guy I knew from high school that took a job in Japan. I was reading some of the thoughts he put down in his blog and he made the coment on something about the place being: "Peaceful. Beautiful. Quiet. Too quiet."  I know someone else currently in Europe. I've known a handful of people who've gone to Europe. It's the over-educated, privaleged thing to do. I'm not demeaning the idea of going abroad. But I can't help but feel there are so many of us rich kids out there that are so keen on going out there, seeing the world, seeing something exotic, that we forget how truly sheltered a lot of our lives are (ironically and paradoxically). It seems in this elitist quest to broaden our horizons, many fail to realize they haven't even explored thier own country let alone another's. It's this snobbery that one must partake in...to experience culture one must look at another's. The irony is there's this urban California bubble. "This culture," in such eyes, is north Orange, LA culture. These folk don't even know all of California, let alone America.  (As an aside, by "rich" I'm not referring to silver spoons necesarily...we Americans have a funny scale of things. Everyone assumes they're in the middle class. Not true.)  I was in a politcal philosphy class and the topic is not relevant to our discussion, but along came the everyday "flyover country" quip so often heard in the halls of academia. "I don't vacation in Branson, Missouri," laughs the professor.  How many of those kids backpacking in Europe have been to Branson, Missouri? I know Californians who've never been to Stockton or Bakersfield (these aren't "small towns" by any stretch). There are Californians who've never been to Yosemite, or even our own capitol, Sacramento. Heck, in a previous post I made a passing self-depricating remark about the common conception that we have a predeliction for IROC Z's and El Caminos in the Inland Empire. There are Californians who scoff at flyover country, not realizing "foreign cultures" that they've traveled halfway around the world for have been in thier backyards all along. In many ways, there are American folks out there that would be more lost in Montana than Luxembourg.  A lot has been said about the red state/blue state divide. Heck, I've written a handful of undergrad papers about it myself. But are the opposite sides of the red/blue wall so terribly far apart that we dismiss each other? Maybe it's not both ways. I've seen plenty of tourists from Podunk in Times Square. Have you seen many Manhattanites in Podunk?  There seems to be a lack of acknowledgement of it all. Maybe it's just me. There are American folks that find the concept of plinking at cans with a .22 on open land as foreign as eating a Japanese pizza that has squid as a topping. There are Americans that watch the bull fights in Spain, but have never been to a rodeo before.  I've been to Europe. As a spoiled college kid myself (backpack and all). I liked it immensely. The people, the cultures, the sights. The history. It was all different, and was an experience I would trade for little else. But I've also been on a road trip that brought me from the Pacific to the Atlantic. Those are memories just as memorable.  So back to this guy I know in Japan now. He's living in a house outside the city. He said it was all "Peaceful. Beautiful. Quiet. Too quiet." I find it funny that he had to go halfway around the world, to a nation that is virtually 100% urban, crowded, overpopulated and congested, in order to find an unsettling "quiet." In a nation that is virtually 0% agrarian, he found a "rural" quiet. California has a world class farming industry. The city we come from alone is the dairy capital of southern California (we have a rodeo every year). All of this is lost on the foreigner in the strange land of "rural" Japan.
