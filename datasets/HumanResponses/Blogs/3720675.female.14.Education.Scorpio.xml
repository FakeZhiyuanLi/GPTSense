      Today was awesome day. To start my day off, I woke up at 7:00 to clean my room. It actually took me 3 1/2 hours to clean it. Then I got ready and walked to the high school to pick up Dan Shyles at 11:30. We watched Disturbing Behavior, hung out in my room listening to music, and walked to Rita's.  Here comes the only bad part of my day. I was forced to go on a walk with CJ and her friend Chelsea. With them being how they are, it was really nasty. They were really huggy and tickled each other a lot. I got over it with paying attention to the passing cars....and the guys driving them.  Here comes the really good part. I went over to Mike's house since I promised Becca that I'd come over. Mike and I decided to go on a walk. I told him everything, and were friends again! YAY! He's even talking to me on the computer again!  All in all, it was a wonderful day. Tomorrow is off to work again. At least its only a 4 hour day. Then to Dann's house to talk to his mom. That will be all for now. Lots of love.

      Let's start with last night. I was outside making Swirl(my hermit crab) a ladder to climb on. Meaghan saw me and when I was done I went down to her house. By the way, that would be Mike's house too. He didnt know I was there, only knew that David wanted him to come out. Not really, it was all me. He saw me, and didnt say a word, the whole night. If I was on the porch, he went over to David's house. If I was over there, then he went to his house. I was going to talk to him, but I was afraid to. So, I got nowhere last night. Besides his other sister, Becca, knowing everything. Do you really hate me that much Mike? Why? Fuck. I'm gonna start crying. Listening to "So" by Static-X isnt helping much either.  Today was a 8 hour work day, 11-7. It was so dead I was sitting in the back room for hours. Easy 40 bucks though. Great thing was that I sold $100.75 in product today. Michele, the other receptionist, is happy to get that in a week! Tracy D., the assistant manager, had me take out her client's foils then wash her hair. It's only the first day into my second week and I've already washed someone's hair! Michele has been working for over a month and she hasnt gotten to yet. I feel special kind of :)  Once I was done my shift, Ashley was going to dye my hair, but it picked up a lot so she didnt have time. I was hoping she would since Dan is coming over tomorrow, I wanted him to see it. We're screwed, as in my mom, brother, and I. My father cant pay the rent, Meenan Oil, Peco, or Verizon. So, our landlord is taking us to court and we may be evicted. Fun, aint it?  Oh, and this girl that I never want to talk to,(long story, dont ask), is trying to talk to me again. She wants me to go on a walk with her tomorrow. Usually, if I want to go on a walk, I actually like to ENJOY it.  Dan Shyles is coming over tomorrow to watch a movie....this should be interesting.  Dude, I think I'm going to have to make my "list" again. This should be tons of fun. Why must being 14 suck so badly? <---Question of the day

          ^----Dann thought of the title. That's how he's feeling today since I couldnt come up with a title/feelings for myself.     All the way back to Friday, I found out that "he" is still watching my conversations on AIM. I found a few torn up on my bed. Really, really sucks. I want to terminate the spyware program thing.      Dann's mom took me to work on Saturday morning. She's so kind. My mom and I are going over to her house on Wednesday night to talk about stuff, since they're a lot alike.      The interview yesterday with the College Partnership program went really well. I like it a lot. They said that they'd really like me to join in with them. It costs $1600, but you save a few more thousands of dollars when it comes time to go to college.     Amy was supposed to come over today or me go over to her house, but my mom left her keys in "his" car last night. So no transportation whatsoever. We're planning on hopefully Saturday to hang out. So, I ended up cleaning the house and watching Armageddon. That movie always makes me cry. Also, the song "Dont Wanna Miss a Thing" by Aerosmith makes me cry all the time. Obviously, that means its a great movie and a great song.      As I failed to mention in my last entry, Mike, although, I guess, you're....whatever....with Ava, I dont care. I still miss you, and I wish that you would at least talk to me long enough to work something out.      Love you people, whoever happens to read this. Stay wonderful. *HUGS*

          I figure that as of the time I get off of work on Saturday, I will have worked 27-28 hours this week. Ain't that just lovely?! Honestly, I absolutely hate this. Its a great job, good pay, and wonderful freebies, but I miss out on so much! Cameron and Amy seem to be having a blast spending all this time together without me. Am I even asked if I'll be off work? No. This is the price I pay, my best friend, Amy. We haven't talked in days. Before I go to work, it's too early to call her. After I get back from work, it's either too late or no one answers. She hasnt even called back. I miss my friends so much. I knew this was going to happen way before I was even applying for jobs, but I didnt know it would still affect me this harshly.     As for my opinion on my "friend" (i dunno if we are anymore), Mike, I'm really disgusted. He's hanging out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend/my enemy, Ava. I know he can do what he wants, but the last time I checked up on it, he hated her. And now he's going to the mall with her on Friday?! He's also subscribed to her online journal. Even though he doesnt want to be friends, it still pisses me off.     I have nothing else to say....for now. Goodbye.

          I really wanted my friend Dan to come over today, but he couldnt get a ride. So, I watched a movie by myself. It's called Double Jeopardy with Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones. Then I got ready for work.     Can you believe that I walked to work?! It took me an hour. Luckily, I wasnt late. Tracy actually said I was early. My feet felt like they were disconnected to my legs when I got there. On the way there, I ran into James. He walked with me about half way there. He said that Casey still wants to go out with me, I said no to that. Then he asked if I would consider going out with him. All I could do was flashback to three summers ago when he asked that. He hasnt changed any, so, again, I said no. Then he was "joking" around and kept touching my boobs. I didnt want to push him onto the highway, so I just kept telling him to stop. Of course he thought it was funny.     Anywho, work was fun. It went by really quickly. I finally got my schedual today. Tomorrow is 1-7, Friday 1-7, and Saturday 9-5. Sunday I have off. That's just for now though. My regular schedual will be Sunday 9-5, Monday off, Tuesday 11-7, Wednesday off, Thursday 11-3, Friday 1-7 or 8, and Saturday off. I figure that's 26 hours a week, which is $133.90 a week, which is $267.80 a paycheck, which is $535.60 a month. So I'll be getting an average of $400.00+ a month. Yay!      Supposedly the county still has to come to the house to investigate to see if it is sexual abuse or not. I thought that was already figured out. Guess not.     My father has to pay a $400.00+ bill by this Saturday or else we wont have power by then. That's when I'll go to a friend's house or my mom is taking my brother and I to a hotel. Oh goodie goodie gumdrops....     I miss....I dont know. :/

          Yes, I'm new. Woohoo. Nothing really to say except HI!      Today was a pretty good day. Woke up, at left-over waffles, got on the computer, and went back to bed. The minute I start falling asleep my friend Eddie calls me telling me to meet him at Rita's. I told him that I was still in my pajamas and that I was just about to fall asleep. He screamed "I dont care! Get dressed and out of bed and be at Rita's in 15 minutes!" He's so funny. So we walked around town until 2.      I come home and take a shower. My boss calls me and says that I DO have to come in tomorrow. I have to work from 5 pm to 8 pm. By the way, I work at the Hair Cuttery. She also changed my hours for Thursday. Now I have to work from 1 pm to 7 pm. That means I'll have to walk to work.     At 4:30 my mom drives me to my best friend Dann's house. We hang out until 5:30 when his mom picks us up and I go with them to the Chiropractor. Not much of a story there. It was just great to see him again. He hates people coming to his house, so I dont get to see him much. Honestly, I still like him a little, I'm trying to ignore it though. I have to move on, its my only choice.      I found my favorite author's website. Its great.  urlLink Amelia Atwater-Rhodes      That will be all for now. Love you lots.

      Let me just get this out of the way. UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ah, much better. I havent talked to Dann since Wednesday, and now its Sunday! I guess the weekend doesnt count since he's gone, somewhere, that he didnt tell me, which I dont know why. Friday I worked for what it seemed forever. Guess what? I got a "nice" little visit from my father, grandmother, and brother too. I cant believe they came on a day I worked. I went to the back room and screamed. On the good side, I got three bucks from Whitney because I washed one of her client's hair. I feel so bad because she cut her finger on her scissors on Tuesday and had to get stitches. Plus, I got my first paycheck! With the budget I figured out, I should have around $15.00 left + or -. That means journal time! Online journals suck. So I'll get that journal with the cool paper and picture of the vampire and wolf on the front from Hot Topic, hopefully. On Saturday, just a few hours ago, I went to my friend Amy's house finally. We watched Scream with her man Skeet Ulrich and my man Matthew Lillard. Yes, we like the psycopaths. ;) At least I have the psyco with the long tongue. Haha. Oh yeah! Sidetracking, supposedly I have a long tongue too. Is that a good thing? After the movie we went to Good Neighbor Day. We saw a ton of people that we absolutely hate. Some that even think that Amy is the one stalking them when it's Luke and is friend that pranks them all the time. Then those few that we actually like. Like the girls from my work, Luke, and all the hott guys we saw. We both got sundaes and our face painted. Only this was sprayed on. Definetly worth the $6. Of course, FIREWORKS! I under estimated Downingtown. The grand finale was great. By the time I got home it was around 9:30-10 and I went outside to hang out with Meaghan, Becca, Erika, and David. Mike wasnt home, or I should say still isnt home. Guess I'm all caught up now. Only a few more entries and then I'm changing over to a non-online journal. Woot! Woot! Cant wait for the day.

      Yesterday was....interesting. Went to work, of course. Worked 4 1/2 hours. Came home and watched this movie with Ryan Merriman in it. The movie was about Ryan going to his aunt's and uncle's over the summer, but he had a school assignment, to make a goal and accomplish it. His was to "witness a act of love" aka in his other words "watch people fucking". Sad thing was that I didnt get to see the end. At 6:30 my mom and I went to Dann's house. Turns out Kathy had forgotten and went to the house next to mine. So we drove back over and talked to her and Jack for 2 hours. That was our little "tea party". They had wine while I had Pepsi and a scoop of coffee ice cream, very good. It feels like I'm practically related to Dann because his mom treats me like her own. She said I wear my eyeliner too thick and need more sun. So when I go over to her house again, she's giving me a makeover. What sucked was that I didnt get to see Dann at all, or talk to him on the computer. Which, I really wanted to tell him something. After that Meaghan and Becca came up to get me. Mike didnt come out at all so I dont know why I wasted my time getting bit up by mosquitoes. Went in at 10:00, read for a half hour of Sleepers, then watched My So-Called Life. Funny thing is, I cant really remember any of it. By then, it was 1:00. Went to sleep, got up this morning, and now I have to go to work for 7 hours. I'll write again tonight hopefully. I'm thinking of just keeping a journal that's NOT online so I can really spill my guts. On the computer, whatever I write will at least disappoint one person. I asked myself, whats the point then? So people can hear my thoughts and get angry? Pretty messed up to me.
