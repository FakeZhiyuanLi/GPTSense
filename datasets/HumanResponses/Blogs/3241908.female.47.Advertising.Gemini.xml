      From the moment when Mary conceived the Son of God, filled with the Holy Spirit, wherever she went, there is also the presence of Jesus and the Spirit. Just look at what Elizabeth immediately experienced as soon as her very young cousin set foot in her house and greeted her. I have no idea of the timbre of Mary's voice, but I know well the efficacy of her presence. And this is not the only first for Elizabeth who has had many others: she is the first who, in the presence of Mary, is filled with the Holy Spirit; she is the first to exalt Mary on account of her maternity: "Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb!"; she is the first to recognize in Mary the Mother of God, calling her "the mother of my Lord"; she is the first to announce an evangelical beatitude: "Blessed is she who has believed."...  About Mary - She is the true and enduring Ark of the Covenant, that is, the dwelling place of God; actually she is more, because it is she from whom god assumed our human nature to live in our midst as our brother. To welcome Mary is the way to receive Jesus and the Holy Spirit. The first beatitude of the Gospel, "Blessed is she who has believed" is the beatitude of faith; to it corresponds well the last beatitude proclaimed by the risen Christ to Thomas: "Because you have seen and yet believed!" (Jn 20:29). Mary is the model of those who believe without having first seen.  About us - Perhaps we have not yet understood who Mary is; the various firsts of Elizabeth are our help and guide. To delude ourselves into thinking we can have Jesus and the Holy Spirit without going through Mary is not in conformity with the way established by God. Faith, not sensibility, tells us that salvation begins by welcoming Mary.   Father Gabriele Amorth, via Magnificat magazine. Father Amorth is the Chief Exorcist of Rome, Italy, and the author of four books about the Blessed Virgin Mary.

      Today's reading from  urlLink In Conversation with God  is amazingly timely what with various Catholic politicians loudly patting themselves on the back for distancing themselves from Church teachings in their jobs. It discusses what having Jesus as the cornerstone really means in our everyday lives. As most of us already know the cornerstone actually is what we would call a keystone ... the essential point that everything is built around and without which a building would collapse. All our actions and decisions should be enlightened by Christ. "What would Jesus do?" is a worn out cliche right now but essentially it is how Christians are to live. No excuses. Period.  It is Christ who gives meaning to the way his followers think and live. Thus it would not makes sense at all if we set aside the supervening and determining fact that we are Christians whenever we have to judge a work of art or a political programme, whenever we have to carry out some business deal or plan our holidays ...  Error is often presented decked out in the noble garments or art, science or freedom ... But faith has to be, indeed is, stronger than error. It is the powerful light that enables us to see, lurking behind what appears to be good, the evil that lies hidden beneath the surface of an otherwise good literary work, of a beauty that conceals ugliness. It is Christ who must be the cornerstone of every building...  In this way we will never think of our faith as a limiting factor -  I can't do this, I can't go there.  Rather it will be a light that enables us to recognize the reality of things and events,without ever forgetting that the devil will try to make an ally of human ignorance (which cannot see the complete reality contained in this literary work or in that doctrine) and of the pride and concupiscence that all of us drag along behind us. Christ is the crucible that assays the gold there is in all human things. Anything that does not stand up to the testing clarity of his teaching is a lie and deceptive, even though it may be adorned with the appearance of some attractive good or perfection.

      Oswald Sobrino at Catholic Analysis always is thought provoking but never more so than in his Memorial Day Weekend essay  urlLink Defeatism, Original Sin, and Emotional Pacifism . Sobrino considers the war in Iraq, the media's defeatist attitude and the penchant for pacifism when the need is to actively fight evil. The entire piece is wonderful and well worth reading. The capper comes with this quote by C.S. Lewis from a radio broadcast in Great Britain during World War II. It is revealing that we face the same moral issues today that were being addressed then in the heat of a great war. We have not advanced the way some would like to believe.  Does loving your enemy mean not punishing him? No, for loving myself does not mean that I ought not to subject myself to punishment-- even to death. If one had committed a murder, the right Christian thing to do would be to give yourself to the police and be hanged. It is, therefore, in my opinion, perfectly right for a Christian judge to sentence a man to death or a Christian soldier to kill an enemy. I always have thought so, ever since I became a Christian, and long before the war. There's no good quoting "Thou shalt not kill." There are two Greek words: the ordinary word to kill and the word to murder. And when Christ quotes that commandment He uses the murder one in all three accounts, Matthew, Mark, and Luke. And I am told there is the same distinction in Hebrew. All killing is not murder any more than all sexual intercourse is adultery. When soldiers came to John the Baptist asking what to do, he never remotely suggested that they ought to leave the army: nor did Christ when He met a Roman sergeant-major--what they called a centurion. The idea of the knight--the Christian in arms for the defence of a good cause--is one of the great Christian ideas. War is a dreadful thing, and I can respect an honest pacifist, though I think he is entirely mistaken.  What I cannot understand is this sort of half pacifism you get nowadays which gives people the idea that though you have got to fight, you ought to do it with a long face and as if you were ashamed of it.  It is that feeling that robs lots of magnificent young Christians in the Services of something they have a right to, something which is the natural accompaniment of courage--a kind of gaiety and whole-heartedness.   C.S. Lewis, Christian Behaviour: A Further Series of Broadcast Talks (N.Y.: Macmillan, 1950), pp. 41-42 (originally published in 1943)(bold emphasis added).

       HOLIDAY WEEKEND ENTERTAINMENT  A couple of the cleverest  urlLink movie shorts  you'll ever see. Jerry Seinfeld and Superman (animated) are hanging out and taking a road trip together. Patrick Warburton provides Superman's voice. He was the live action "Tick" also for any fans of that show so it ties in perfectly with Superman here. Be sure to watch them in order as the second one has a lot of referential tie-ins to the first.

       urlLink  TOKYO GODFATHERS   It may seem as if the only movies I ever see are anime. Not so. However, they often are fresh and original in a way that Western animation does not even consider. Such is the case of "Tokyo Godfathers." This Japanese tribute to John Ford's western "Three Godfathers" centers on three homeless people: a middle aged drag queen, an alcoholic former bicycle racer, and a teenage runaway girl. Their discovery of a baby in a trash dump sends them off to find the baby's parents. Along the way they grow, chiefly by confronting each other and themselves about the lies they've told each other about the past. Hana, the drag queen, names the abandoned infant Grace and  insists that she has been sent by God. Coincidences and miracles happen increasingly throughout and seem surprisingly Christian for a Japanese film.  The juxtaposition of humor and drama are deft and play off each other in unexpected ways. At one point Hana is dramatically describing how he will commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. We have been primed by this time to find Hana's pronouncements quietly comic. Then the viewer realizes that someone in the background is taking the exact measures that Hana describes. Both humor and drama are in play as they also realize it a beat later and rush to stop the person from jumping. We never were disappointed. Although one expects an overall happy ending the plot twists on the way were original and unexpected. It is rated PG-13 and some of the material is not suitable for children.

       by Rose Davis, Valedictorian   Good evening. Before we honor ourselves, let us honor those around us. First, thank you to Father Libone who, with Mrs. Lucas, has nicely finished off our well-rounded religious education by treating us to Mass twice a week and Confession four times a year. You have single-handedly saved us from half an hour of Science and History every Monday. Next, thank you to Mrs. Frauenheim, the staff, and our teachers, past and present, especially Ms. Tharp and Mr. Rogers who managed to fit an extra half-hour of class in on Tuesday. Thank you to all the parents, who have not only brought us into the world, but have threatened to take us out of it, ensuring our success and obedience.  Thank you lastly to the coaches, for although I do not know you personally, I have heard you are quite good.  Tonight we are being honored for what we have achieved here, for what can be recognized and printed on to paper. But every one of us here has done great things that may never be recognized, even by ourselves. Each one of those great things has touched someone in a way we cannot see. Those who are not receiving their recognition now, it will come later when it is most important.  There are many conflicting feelings about the future and about the past, about what will happen and about what has happened. When we leave here we will think wistfully about our memories, good and bad, and then turn to the future. But as long as we have the memories we will never truly leave.    Our lives are filled with stories. Sometimes, they mean nothing and sometimes they mean everything. But no matter how insignificant the story may seem, it is a part of us. It makes us who we are. Every experience, every person that touches our lives leaves their own individual mark, even those that are not here with us today. And though we may not remember them twenty years from now, they’re still there.   Now it is time for things to change. Even in the loneliest times we will still be there for each other through what we have shared over the years. Our memories are intertwined and parts of our stories are the same, but to dwell in the past will bring nothing but sorrow. We are still writing our stories.

      Oswald Sobrino at  Catholic Analysis  takes a long, hard look at the blog as an economic model in  urlLink Blogs: Economic Theory at its Best . His conclusion? They are very close to being "the economist's ideal of perfect competition in which the consumer rules." The article is a fascinating look at economic principles applied to something that requires only time as the unit of economy.  One of the most interesting ideas is found when the focus turns to the connection between economics and Catholic analysis. There is a clear reminder that the honest pursuit of truth is one of the most Catholic of all endeavors. This is contrary to the way the Catholic Church often is portrayed nowadays so it is well worth noting. And, although Sobrino does not specifically mention it, most Catholic blogs are generated from that very pursuit of truth. They either share the truth with others or are an open invitation to share the blogger's journey of discovery.    But what does this economics excursion have to do with Catholic analysis? The Catholic view is that truth is one and that all truth reflects the Creator who is Truth. So when we use our rational nature as persons created in the image of God to shed light on God's universe, whether in economics or physics, we are approaching, however imperfectly, the perfect Truth who is God.  Nothing genuinely intellectual is alien to Catholicism. The Council of Trent made this clear:  Though faith is above reason, there can never be any real discrepancy between faith and reason. Since the same God who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the human mind, God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever contradict truth." Source: Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 159.  Vatican II reaffirmed this Catholic outlook on human knowledge:  Consequently, methodical research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with faith, because the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same God. The humble and persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led, as it were, by the hand of God in spite of himself, for it is God, the conserver of all things, who made them what they are.

       IT'S A MATTER OF HONESTY: TO RECEIVE COMMUNION, WE NEED TO BE IN COMMUNION   Archbishop Chaput isn't one to dodge the tricky questions. In this  urlLink column  he applies the question of receiving Communion to all Catholics, not just the politicians who challenge the Church. He is a master at showing how Church teachings apply to our personal lives.   Claiming to be Catholic and then rejecting Catholic teaching is an act of dishonesty and a lack of personal integrity. Worse, if we then receive Communion, we violate every Catholic who does believe and does strive to live the faith fully and unselfishly. And that compounds a sin against honesty with a sin against justice and charity. Again, as Justin Martyr said: "No one may take part (in the Eucharist) unless he believes what we teach is true.  Chaput also makes the point that having the Communion question become so prominent actually is a blessing in disguise.    One of the ironies of an already strange election year is the number of non-Catholics, ex-Catholics and anti-Catholics who have developed a sudden piety about who should receive Communion and when. We should thank God for them. Whenever the Church is criticized, she understands herself better and is purified. And when she's purified, then she better serves the Lord.

       "KEEP THEM FROM THE EVIL ONE"   There is nothing which gives greater security to our actions, or more effectively cuts the snares the devil lays for us, than to follow another person's will, rather than our own, in doing good...When the devil has failed in making man fall, he puts forward all his energies to create distrust between the penitent and the confessor, and so little by little he gains his end at last...Obedience is the true holocaust which we sacrifice to God on the altar of our hearts... The good works which we do of our own will are not so meritorious as those that are done under obedience... When tribulations, infirmities, and contradictions come, we must not run away in a fright, but vanquish them like men. It is not enough to see that God wishes the good we aim at, but that he wishes it through our instrumentality, in our manner and in our time; and we may come to discern all this by true obedience.

       At times, you will be able to speak about eternity, when present trials will be transformed into glory; but it isn't very often that you will be able to speak so directly. By keeping in the bottom of your heart, however this intention of leading these souls to God, you can at least try to give some human hope ...  Know how to stress the least disadvantageous side. Know how to emphasize what is pleasant. Point out those things that are better than they were the day before. In short, don't let the day go by without bringing your provision of comfort. You know very well that a friendly voice is enough to set restless and troubled minds at ease. Be one of those who notice when the thermometer is rising, and not one of those who is always pointing out that it's getting colder ...  Finally this spirit of blessing, of praising, the actions of grace that your belonging to Christ should give you, will be translated practically into good humor: unaffected good humor, penetrating sweetness, and true simplicity; no artificial jesting which breaks forth like laughter, but allows the spirits to plunge again into gloom. No, you are going to be the little smile which, though delicate, on certain winter afternoons reminds people of the springtime, and is its foreshadowing, and shows that life and the joys of living are things that are still possible and not dead and buried.  There are enough people who bury every budding hope. You, you be one who brings hope out into the light.   Mother Marie des Douleurs, via Magnificat magazine

      The Salvation Army is in a showdown with New York City reports the New York Post in  urlLink Army Girds for Gay War    If the organization leaves town, it would give up $70 million a year in city funding.  The loss of public financing - half the Army's yearly budget in the city - would cripple its programs, which serve 5 million New Yorkers, the group says.  Salvation Army insiders said they will refuse to comply with the proposed law because it goes against one of the organization's core beliefs - that marriage is for straight couples only.  "The Army will not change its policy," said one official, who declined to be named.  "You cannot change theological views. Those are so deeply embedded, they form the root of the faith itself."  The result could be a nightmare scenario for needy New Yorkers.  Kudos to the Salvation Army for not waffling on their beliefs. Now if only Catholic Charities would follow suit in California.

      We near the end of our family festival month with my birthday. Normally this would the be glorious conclusion but we have the 8th grade Tribute and then Graduation later this week. I had a great start to the day when Hannah's friend Susan was openly amazed that I am 47 ... and amazed in the right direction, I might add. So nice to start off knowing that you look younger than you are to a 16-year-old. They are uncompromising in their honesty. So I guess I don't need Mayor Quimby's clinic ... yet!

      Martha is a chef who has a great deal of discipline, an obsession with food although she never seems to eat, and little joy in her life. When her sister dies, Martha is forced into facing unknown situations after her orphaned niece comes to live with her. Then a new chef is added to the staff and Martha's loss of control seems complete. Suddenly Martha's life is no longer under control at all with the expected growth of character resulting.  This is a slow and deliberate movie but the acting and dialogue are great and a lot of the scenes are very funny. Naturally, as this is about a chef, it is a major "foodie" film.  urlLink  Mostly Martha  is a German movie with subtitles but don't let that scare you. Actually we liked listening to the German and picking out words that were almost the same as in English ... but that's the kind of thing our family does for fun. We all enjoyed it. In fact, Rose enjoyed  Mostly Martha  so much that she bought the DVD.

        urlLink GAY MARRIAGE - AND MARRIAGE  BY SAM SHULMAN   Following the debate in the comments boxes (Bravo Linda Gray Kelly post, May 19) is this article which examines the arguments for and against gay marriage. Sam Shulman covers all angles to the issue without resorting to emotion or religion which is refreshing. I especially welcome this because the Church's teachings do not make compelling debate material when talking to people who do not subscribe to those beliefs.  Shulman takes the entire issue back to basics by considering what constitutes the essence of marriage. His writing has a resonance of logic which I have sorely missed in other reasoning and is something that I will remember for future conversations. He also makes a compelling case that women will be the main victims of the destruction of traditional marriage, which is the eventual result of the legalization of gay marriage.   This article is required reading for anyone who honestly wants to consider what marriage is ... and is not. He also states what has been one of my main thoughts on the subject from a strictly secular point of view but which I have not seen expressed elsewhere:  Insofar as I care for my homosexual friend as a friend, I am required to say to him that, if a lifelong monogamous relationship is what you want, I wish you that felicity, just as I hope you would wish me the same. But insofar as our lives as citizens are concerned, or even as human beings, your monogamy and the durability of your relationship are, to be blunt about it, matters of complete indifference...  That is not because you are gay. It is because, in choosing to conduct your life as you have every right to do, you have stepped out of the area of shared social concern in the same sense as has anyone, of whatever sexuality, who chooses not to marry.  Thanks to John for the heads up on this article which originally appeared in the November 2003  Commentary  magazine.

      Rose is co-Valedictorian for her 8th grade class. She and another girl tied for the honor so both will give speeches at the class tribute the day before graduation. Needless to say, Tom and I are as proud as peacocks. There's nothing better than bragging about our wonderful girl ... unless its bragging about our  other  wonderful girl! As Tom said, he's never even known anyone who could be considered a contender for valedictorian before, much less actually achieve it. What a great way to finish the school year.

        urlLink DAY ONE   Even though the feast of the Ascension is being celebrated on Sunday in most U.S. dioceses, the traditional "Ascension Thursday" was yesterday. That is the signal to begin the Novena to the Holy Spirit the next day. According to  urlLink Novena: The Power of Prayer :  This is the oldest novena, dating back to the very birth of the church and its importance cannot be underestimated. When Christ first appeared to the apostles forty days after the crucifixion, he sent them to Jerusalem to await the Holy spirit and instructed them to pray for nine days. This novena, written in the Middle Ages, is said for nine days prior to Pentecost, the fiftieth day after Easter, and is still the only novena officially prescribed by the Church. Addressed to the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity, it is a powerful plea for the light, strength, love, and wisdom needed by all.

      Now I understand why Levi (Matthew) was such a surprising choice as a disciple. I knew that it was easy for tax collectors back then to skim off the top but had no idea how they were such thorough thieves. Continuing through Luke, William Barclay shows how many opportunities there were for an enterprising fellow to line his pockets and how despised he would be for doing so.   A tax was payable for using the main road, the harbors, the markets. A tax was payable on a cart, on each wheel of it, and on the animal which drew it. There was purchase tax on certain articles, and there were import and export duties. A tax-collector could bid a man stop on the road and unpack his bundles and charge him well night what he liked. If a man could not pay, sometimes the tax-collector would offer to lend him money at an exorbitant rate of interest and so get him further into his clutches.  Robbers, murderers and tax-collectors were classed together. A tax-collector was barred from the synagogue. A Roman writer tells us that he once saw a monument to an honest tax collector. An honest specimen of this renegade profession was so rare that he received a monument.

        urlLink AJA  by Steely Dan  Listening to John Mayer with Hannah in the car I found myself with a powerful craving for music that had something more ... edginess, spark, funk ... personality. Yeah, that's it, personality. I found myself wishing I had Steely Dan on CD.  I couldn't wait to get home and play Aja for Hannah. She's a pleasure to play old music for because she's always more interested in the quality of the guitar playing than how current the CD is. We may never know what Hannah thought of it because an art project got in the way. I, however, was surprised and pleased to find it much better than I remembered. You can't live with an eclectic music lover like Tom for so many years and not soak up an inadvertent education in listening to music. I was able to appreciate it in a way I never did those many years ago on the car radio or as background music in my dorm room (yes  that's  how old it is).  If you haven't heard Steely Dan before I'm not sure exactly how to describe their music. Funky. Soulful. Fusion. Progressive. Jazz. Rock. Whatever ... its refreshing after listening to the likes of John Mayer and Norah Jones. It certainly won't put you to sleep. The only unwelcome surprise was that we merely own Aja out of all the Steely Dan albums. Time to hit the music store.

      Yesterday's post about Linda Kelly prompted an interesting conversation in the comments boxes. It echoes those I have found myself in during the last few weeks thanks to the gay marriage laws. What I liked about the comments discussion is that it covered most of the points of view that I have heard.  This morning I read the  urlLink Navarre Bible's  commentary about Luke 6:36 which is Jesus saying, "Be merciful, even as your father is merciful." It perfectly summarizes how to show compassion while not losing sight of error which I think is something that is too easy to forget from both sides of the argument. People tend to go all the way in either direction, either with all encompassing tolerance that allows no fault or laying down the letter of the law with no compassion for personal struggles. This is a good reminder of how to tread that fine line.  We should also show understanding towards people who are in error: "Love and courtesy of this kind should not, of course, make us indifferent to truth and goodness. Love, in fact, impels the followers of Christ to proclaim to all men the truth which saves. But we must distinguish between the error (which must always be rejected) and the person in error, who never loses his dignity as a person even though he flounders amid false or inadequate religious ideas. God alone is the judge and the searcher of hearts; he forbids us to pass judgment on the inner guilt of others: (Vatican II,  Gaudium et spes , 28).

        urlLink Candyfreak: A Journey Through the Chocolate Underbelly of America  by Steve Almond   I heard rave reviews about this book but didn't expect to find myself constantly apologizing to Tom for all the  giggling while reading it in bed. Steve Almond is not only literally crazy about candy but a hilarious and talented writer. His quest to find his favorite candy of yesteryear takes him around America to the last of the independent candy manufacturers. Even when mentioning his personal political or environmental views, Almond never really dwells on them or seems to take anything too seriously ... except candy, of course. Its a quick read that left me with a desire to look for 5 Star Bars, Peanut Chews, Big Hunks ... all that candy that I never heard of before but now long to experience.

      These animes are by the same director as My Neighbor Totoro. All are original stories and each is a treasure in its own right. {Note to anime fans: I am aware of Princess Mononoke but don't think it is in the same league as these.}   urlLink Kiki's Delivery Service  is about a plucky 13-year-old girl who is spending her first year soloing as an apprentice witch. Kiki is still inexperienced but  that is offset by her resourcefulness, imagination, and determination. With her trusty cat Jiji by her side she's ready to make her mark in the village she's chosen as her new home. This is sweet and charming in the same way that My Neighbor Totoro was.   urlLink The Castle of Cagliostro  delivers plenty of adventure in this caper flick. The mysterious adventurer Lupin III and his faithful sidekick, Jigen encounter a runaway bride, a magical ring, an evil count with a dastardly plan, an inspector bent on catching Lupin, perilous rooftop chases, ninjas with superhuman powers, a counterfeiting scheme, and an ancient mystery. This is full of wise cracks and off handed wit in the same way as hard boiled mysteries of the 1930s were.   urlLink Spirited Away  is my personal favorite. More complex than the other movies mentioned, it combines Japanese and Russian folklore in a fascinating fantasy. On the way to their new home, Chihiro and her parents find what they think is a deserted amusement park. Her parents stuff themselves until they turn into pigs, and Chihiro discovers they're trapped in a resort for traditional Japanese gods and spirits. Naturally Chihiro must save them and does so with pluck and determination.

      Mark Shea has a great article on Catholic Exchange,  urlLink The Benefits of Belief , that examines the  popular cultural idea that true Christianity is for boring, self sacrificing "losers" or that Christians are merely checking off "requirements" to earn rewards in Heaven. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.  But Jesus, in the passage above, essentially says the people who want Heaven are like people who marry for love. It is not wrong or cynical for them to do so. For self-denial is not the goal; rather, it is the means to the goal.

      Its hard to believe that Tom and I have been married 20 years. That is such a serious number! And serious is not our style as you can see from our special anniversary quote in the sidebar. The whole family agreed this was the perfect sentiment for this special day. As anyone can see we're making sure the kids have the proper perspective on things too.  I will be serious about one thing though. I've always believed that everybody has one person who was created to be their perfect match. I am blessed beyond words to have spent the last 20 years with my "perfect" husband. Here's to another 20 ... or 30 ... dare I say 40?

      Barbara Nicolosi (Church of the Masses) is having a wonderful time in Spain. Read about it in  urlLink Ah Valencia . Included is this hilarious, yet telling, exchange.  I met my first European aristocrat (EA), and the experience went a long way towards helping me understand why my ancestors would have fled everything they knew and owned to come to America. This fellow was a filmmaker from a country which shall go unnamed, and he had barely sat down at the table before he started insulting America, Hollywood, Americans in general and me in particular. The exchanges between courses went something like this…  EA: So, you have sixty writers who teach for your Act One? BN: Yes. EA: (sniff) I am amazed that there are sixty writers in Hollywood who have something to teach. EA: So what are the movies that some of your Act One instructors have worked on?  I named five or six films like X-Men, X2, Hoosiers, Rudy, What Women Want, Where the Heart Is, Remember the Titans, Batman Forever, Return to Me. None of which were known to the EA. Finally, I mentioned Braveheart…  EA: Ah, at last a film of some note.  So, - okay, a little wickedly – I asked him to name the movies had made. He noted that he had collaborated on one project with Maia Morgenstern who plays Mary in TPOTC. He asked if I had seen that project.  BN: No, I haven't seen that. EA: (looking away with disgust) Americans! BN: (with growing annoyance) When you didn't know the films I mentioned, I did not say, “Europeans!” like you were ignorant. EA: Because that I have not seen those Hollywood films is a reason for pride.

      In his Dallas Morning News editorial,  urlLink Bishops Ignore Their Burning Houses  (requires free registration), Rod Dreher takes bishops to task for not preaching about Church teachings or encouraging priests to do so.  The results of such policies are put in a nutshell in this quote from an article by Fr. J. Wilson for  The Wanderer .   "They may come to Mass, but they are, sadly, never really fed, never really formed in the Catholic faith," the priest says. "And their attitudes and values morph into what we would expect of amiable pagans."   This is exactly what I have seen. I have attended the same parish for 10 years, the last 4 of which I have been Catholic. I have quite a few friends who wish we had more Church teachings in homilies. Partly they would like it as support and partly they would like it so they have help in how to actually live them in the various situations that arise. They don't say it very loud because they love our priest and don't want to seem disloyal. I think he would be surprised at how many people wish for it though.  If we heard more about Church teachings and how they relate to our every day lives from the pulpit perhaps my 8th grader wouldn't be the only one who knows and  defends  them at recess. Yes, Catholic school kids actually do talk about things like abortion, gay marriage and sex before marriage on the playground. My daughter is the only one who ever states any view opposite to popular culture. This is not the fault of the religion teacher or classes. It is because their parents, the biggest influence in their lives, either do not believe or do not know what the Church teaches.  This problem goes beyond problems in living our lives within the context of popular culture. I was dumbfounded recently when about one-third of a large group of young, faithful Catholic women didn't know that Mary always stayed a virgin and Jesus didn't have siblings. This might not seem like much to non-Catholics but it is a major belief about Mary. The two who did the most explaining and defense of the teaching were converts ... people who had to actively go out and seek the information. What is worse, several of the uninformed had deliberately helped with RCIA classes so they would know more about their faith. One friend said that was where Bible study came in handy. How many people are going to sit down and start reading up on Church teachings? Not many and certainly not if they are young women with more to do, as most of these were.  We need to hear what the Church teaches and how it relates to our lives. Thanks to Rod Dreher for bringing this into the public forum in Dallas.

      May is Mary's month and what better way to celebrate it than getting a better understanding of Our Blessed Mother? This excerpt from chapter 6 of "Adventures in Orthodoxy" discusses the common idea of "virgin" versus the real meaning as applied to "Virgin Mary." As a bonus, this explains something I always wondered: why didn't Mary and Jesus (and possibly Joseph) stand out as unusual? The comments in brackets are my own for clarification of points the author discussed earlier in the chapter.  "... born of the Virgin Mary"  ...Mary, the mother of Jesus, is an icon of beauty and purity because she is a virgin. But I'm aware that this term, too, [like the term "purity"] has been misunderstood and maligned. We think of a virgin simply as a person who hasn't had sexual intercourse. This is the shallowest of definitions. Defining a "virgin" as someone who hasn't had sexual intercourse is like defining a person from Idaho as "a person who has never been to Paris." It may be true that most Idahoans haven't been to Paris, but to define an untraveled Idahoan by that simple negative definition is too small. Even the most stay-at-home fellow from Idaho is bigger than a negative definition.  What were the early Christians thinking when they honored the Virgin Mary? Was it simply their form of goddess worship? [as some nonbelievers would say] If so, why the emphasis on virginity? When you look at what they believed about Mary, it turns out that they were honoring her for far more than the biological fact that a maiden remained intact. For them the Virgin wasn't just an untouched woman. Her physical virginity was a sign of something far more. It was an indication of her whole character. In her they sensed a kind of virginity that was a positive and powerful virtue. Mary represented all that was natural, abundant, positive, and free. Mary was a virgin in the same way that we call a forest "virgin": she was fresh and natural, majestic and mysterious. Mary's virginity wasn't simply the natural beauty and innocence of a teenage girl. It held the primeval purity of Eden and the awesome innocence of Eve...  You might imagine that such total innocence and goodness would make Mary a sort of Galilean wonderwoman. It's true that her innocence was extraordinary, but it was also very ordinary. That is to say that while it was momentous, it didn't seem remarkable at the same time. There is a curious twist to real goodness. It's summed up by the observation that what is natural isn't unusual. If a person is really good, he is humble; and if he is humble, he is simply who he should be. There is nothing bizarre or egotistical or eccentric about him. There is therefore nothing about him that calls attention to him. Truly good people blend in. They are at home with themselves, and no one is out of place when they are at home. In the same way, Mary wasn't noticed in Nazareth. Because she was natural, she didn't stand out. Mary fit in because she was simply and wholly who she was created to be. Because she was perfectly natural, she was perfectly ordinary. Therefore, she was both as marvelous and as unremarkable as a morning in May.

       urlLink Yahoo News  gives details of the six new saints that were named on Saturday, including Gianna Beretta Molla ...  ... an Italian pediatrician who died in 1962 at the age of 39 — a week after giving birth to her fourth child. Doctors had told her it was dangerous to proceed with the pregnancy because she had a tumor in her uterus, but she insisted on carrying the baby to term.  In proclaiming her a saint, John Paul praised her "extreme sacrifice" and her simple but profound message.  "May our era rediscover, by the example of Gianna Beretta Molla, the pure, chaste and fertile beauty of conjugal love, lived as a response to the divine calling," he said.    Thanks to Alicia at  urlLink Fructus Ventris  for the heads up.

My buddy and I were wondering if you would settle a dispute we're having. Do you think the word should be pronounced HOMEschooling, or homeSCHOOLing?  8. Sorry, but I couldn't help but noticing how cute you look in that ankle-length, shapeless, plaid jumper.  7. What's a nice girl like you doing at a First Saturday Rosary Cenacle like this?  6. You don't like the culture of death either? Wow! We have so much in common!  5. Let's get out of here. I know a much cozier little Catholic bookstore downtown.  4. I bet I can guess your confirmation name.  3. You've got stunning scapular-brown eyes.  2. Did you feel what I felt when we reached into the holy water font at the same time?  1. Confess here often?

      That is the question raised by  GetReligion  in their story  urlLink Preparing for the future of the Kerry and communion story" . They have a good overview of reaction by bishops and media to the entire situation which no doubt will come to a head in Denver. Kerry is planning fundraising events Aspen and Denver which will fall at the same time as a U.S. Catholic Bishops gathering in Denver, June 14-19. The Chuch and her teachings are going to be under public scrutiny as never before given the way the media can whip up a frenzy. Read the whole thing at GetReligion.

      Yesterday I read about Our Lady of Fatima saying that we should do constant penance in atonement for our sins, the sins or others and conversion of souls. A worthy cause indeed but I instantly had visions of constant fasting and denying myself everything I enjoy. Suddenly my future looks very bleak! This reading from  In Conversation With God  reminds us that we are offered boundless opportunities for penance in ordinary living. When I am itching to hit the snooze button, forcing myself to get up when the alarm sounds becomes a moment of supreme sacrifice, a "heroic minute." Now that is something I can offer to God every day.    The virtue of penance has to be present, to some degree, in all the everyday actions of life: in fulfilling exactly the timetable you have fixed for yourself, even thought your body resists. Penance is getting up on time and also not leaving for later, without any real reason, that particular job that you find harder or most difficult to begin and finish.  Penance is knowing how to reconcile your duties to God, to others and to yourself, by making demands on yourself so that you find enough time for each of your tasks. You are practicing penance when you lovingly keep to your schedule of prayer, despite feeling worn out, listless or cold...  Penance consists in putting up good-humoredly with the thousand and one little pinpricks of every day; in not abandoning your task, although you have momentarily lost the enthusiasm with which you started it; in eating gladly whatever is served without being fussy...  A spirit of penance keeps us from becoming too attached to the vast imaginative blueprints we have made for our future projects, where we have already foreseen our master-strokes and brilliant successes. What joy we give to God when we are happy to lay aside our third-rate painting efforts and let him put in the features and colors of his choice! (St. J. Escriva, Friends of God)

       ADVENTURES IN ORTHODOXY  The Marvels of the Christian Creed and the Audacity of Belief by Dwight Longenecker  This book compellingly conveys the joy and excitement that is present in our faith and in God. Longenecker does this by following G.K. Chesterton's technique of looking at familiar ideas differently by "standing them on their heads." Each chapter looks at the  Apostles' Creed line by line and shows us that it is not simply a comfortable recitation of beliefs but a launching point for an exhilarating encounter with God.  Below is an excerpt from the first chapter which looks at the Creed's opening phrase "I believe..." This is written as a contrast to the person who must have everything proven as fact, often scientifically, before they will believe it..   Even since Cain, we have found it difficult to believe. The reason has nothing to do with science. Quite simply, it's difficult to believe because it's difficult to obey. Belief is never simply an intellectual exercise. As rational beings, we know that to acknowledge something as true means that it must change our life. If something is true - really, utterly, and radiantly true - it demands our total allegiance. If something is eternally and magnificently true, it was here before I was and it must change me; I can't change it. No matter who the person is, or in what age he has lived, belief that demands obedience is, and always will be, a terrifying and exhilarating prospect.  Even the mere word obedience is a shock to the heart. It's enough to make you throw a book across the room. The word makes us think of pursed-lipped old nuns ready to thrash timid children into submission. We see hordes of jackbooted thugs goose-stepping to the commands of their demonic overlords. We imagine gullible religious devotees submitting to bizarre beliefs. We think of the young automatons of religious sects and the quivering woman shielding her children from the demands of an outrageous husband.  These are examples, not of obedience, but of domination and subservience. The obedience that goes with belief is something different. It's an inquisitive, open-ended, and youthful virtue. The word obedience comes from the Latin  obedire , which means "listen to." True obedience is a kind of curiosity. It's a fresh alertness, a childlike eagerness to listen and learn. It's the voice of deep calling to deep. It is a human heart open to the drawing and calling of a timeless and universal power that the ancients could only call Love ...  ... The first step is not to believe all the specifics, but simply to believe. To Be. To Live. To Be Alive. To Believe.  To believe in all things seen and unseen is to accept all that is real, both in the natural and in the supernatural realms. It means embracing every morsel of matter, from each grain of sand to each gargantuan star. It means being full of wonder at all things invisible - from atoms and angels to molecules and miracles. To believe in all things seen and unseen means accepting that the visible and invisible realms are intermingled in a marvelous and mysterious way. It means gasping with delight at the wonderful and frightening realization that all things are possible. This is the innocent, unembarrassed, and blessed state of the believer: His heart is open to everything on earth and in Heaven, and he plunges in to be overwhelmed by it all, crying, "I believe!"

       urlLink GetReligion  has a horrifying reminder that Christian martyrs are being created every day. As with many of these incidents this is being reported in very few places.   Anjum was apparently kidnapped when he stopped to get a drink of water and was tortured for five days in an attempt to force his conversion. When his condition worsened he was taken to the police and kept in custody for two days. Finally, he was taken to a hospital, where he died.

      Our Friday family movie night featured this sweet Australian movie which I almost had forgotten.  urlLink The Castle  is an understated comedy about a man whose home truly is his castle. When the local airport wants to buy the property, which any normal person would jump at as it sits at the end of an airport runway and directly under gigantic power lines, he fights in court for the right to keep his home.  The main thing I remembered from seeing it long ago was the father's unconditional love and approval of every person in his family. Watching it as a family I was reminded that the entire family reciprocated those feelings. Watching the local news the father turns to his daughter, the only family member with a "college degree" (from hairdresser school), and tells her that they have "ripping bodies" but their hair really could use fixing up to be like hers. Needless to say, the daughter's hair is horrendous but her pleased and loving reaction underscores the family's complete happiness. If they think about the outside world at all it is to be sorry that the world doesn't have a share in their contentment and "riches".  Hannah and Rose loved it and both said that if more families were like this one the world would be a better place. Very true. A word of caution: this movie is rated "R". The only reason I could see for that rating was language. "F***" was heard occasionally, especially whenever the lawyer was trying to fix his copier (I had much sympathy for his situation!).

      Continuing through the historical backup for Luke, William Barclay gives some vivid examples of just how nitpicking the Pharisees were about sin. The modern equivalent of this is "more Catholic than the Pope." We all know people like this and we are lucky if we are not one of them. It is a natural human tendency to want it to be easy to know what to do and what to avoid. Unfortunately, it becomes all too easy to focus on the letter of the law and forget the big picture that led to it in the first place. That leads to hard hearts and lack of forgiveness. No wonder Jesus kept placing such emphasis on prayer and living our faith from the heart.    The basis of the law was the Ten Commandments. These commandments are principles for life. They are not rules and regulations; they do not legislate for each event and for every circumstance. For a certain section of the Jews that was not enough...From the Ten Commandments they proceeded to develop and elaborate these rules...  To heal on the Sabbath was to work. It was laid down that only if life was in actual danger could healing be done; and then steps could be taken only to keep the sufferer from getting worse, not to improve his condition. A plain bandage could be put on a wound, but not any ointment; plain wadding could be put into a sore ear, but not medicated. It is easy to see that there was no limit to this...  The name Pharisee means "The Separated One"; and the Pharisees were those who had separated themselves from ordinary people and ordinary life in order to keep these rules and regulations. Note two things. First for the scribes and Pharisees these rules were a matter of life and death; to break one of them was a deadly sin. Second, only people desperately in earnest would ever have tried to keep them, for they must have made life supremely uncomfortable. It was only the best people who would even make the attempt.  Jesus had no use for rules and regulations like that. For him, the cry of human need superseded all such things. But to the scribes and Pharisees he was a law-breaker, a bad man who broke the law and taught others to do the same...the tragedy of the life of Jesus was that those who were most in earnest about their religion drove him to the Cross...

      Moloch muses on the "The Women's March for Life" and just how successful it was for him as a human hating demon in this  urlLink post . He also takes this opportunity for a few kudos to Terri Schiavo's husband and the judges on her case for their dedication to his cause. For those who have not visited  Moloch Now , it is a pro-life site written with a wicked sense of humor from the demon Moloch's point of view (think  Screwtape Letters  by C.S. Lewis). Here's a sample of the demonic reaction to the March:   Demons love irony and the irony of this event was delicious. Thousands of women marching to celebrate the death of at least 22 million women in abortion is just demonic, and that is a good thing. I so enjoy seeing husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends marching together to keep the right to kill their own progeny. I haven't seen such displays of the promotion of promiscuous sex since the days of the pagans.

       Recommended Reading for Every Mood, Moment, and Reason    "When I get a little money, I buy books. And if there is any left over, I buy food."  — Desiderius Erasmus  This pretty much sums up my approach to books. I love them with a passion. I can't wait to read good ones I've heard about. So I was interested to take a look at  urlLink Book Lust . Librarian Nancy Pearl has turned a lifetime love of books into lists of recommendations in over 175 categories. There is something for everyone: Dinosaur Hunting, Academia: The Joke, Road Novels, Kitchen-Sink Poetry. Each of her suggestions is accompanied by a few of her thoughts on it and a succinct plot summary. She also has highlighted a few authors that are relatively unknown and "Too Good to Miss". I was pleased to see two of my favorite "unknown" authors, Connie Willis and Ross Thomas, were included.  I usually don't wind up with many recommendations from this sort of book because I'm a fairly low brow reader, sticking to mysteries, science fiction, and memoirs ... and none of them had better be too sad or serious. I was surprised to find myself with a list of over 60 books to try. Eventually, I'd put the book down to do something and when I came back it had disappeared. Hannah now has a large list of books to try also. Thank heavens for the public library!

He is the sole Christian in his own family who are are Taoists. Read the whole article to get the flavor of a most different environment. (Found through Dale Price,  urlLink SecretAgentMan's Dossier )   in our sunny island, one can choose from a wide selection of religions, such as Christianity (Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Protestantism, and maybe even the heretical Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses [who are banned in Singapore, so you can't really find them and convert, but they like knocking on your doors when you least expect it] and sundry nuts), Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Hinduism, even Judaism. of course, you can be a free-thinker (does that mean one is "free from thinking"?), atheist, or maybe the passive agnostic who don't bother to make the effort to decide whether God exists or not.

       VAN HELSING   Werewolves, vampires, and Frankenstein ... oh my! Van Helsing is like the Vatican's 007 complete with an underground cavern where the friar equivalent of "Q" invents monster killing equipment. They thrown in practically every type of monster that ever has been in a movie except zombies. Why no zombies? Perhaps because they don't have that "Transylvanian" story behind them. I'd say more but there's no point. Its a summer spectacular which was just about what I thought it would be from the previews: a mishmash of monsters and over-the-top special effects with way too little plot. Sadly, even the obligatory one liners weren't that good. And I don't understand why Kate Beckinsall was dressed like a dominatrix (probably the guys at the movie understood that just fine). It wasn't a complete loss. Hugh Jackman always is a treat although he spent most of the movie with a turtle neck sweater on. Staying home with one or both of the X-Men movies is a much better way to get a dose of him than going to this.  Of course, the whole point of going to the movie was that it was Rose's birthday party. On that score it was a HUGE success. Everyone loved the movie although it does take a car full of good Catholic girls to puzzle half way home about a plot point involving the Archangel Gabriel, which cracked me up. Even more hilarious was that Tom said his car full of girls was doing the exact same thing. I love it! I was reminded that I am lucky that Rose has good friends who are such great kids. Listening to the laughing and hilarity before and after made the whole movie worthwhile.

      For anyone who ever thought that Catholics don't know all the crazy misconceptions that people have, Mark Shea at  Catholic and Enjoying It  has a hilarious post from a reader,  urlLink Another Satisfied Catholic . He follows up with his own riff on the subject. Be sure to sample the comments boxes (145 comments to date) that add their favorites.   A really cool part of Catholicism is that now I can commit all of my favorite sins and then go to Confession right before I go out and do them again!! Actually, while I was Protestant, I guess I did that too, but without the Confession part. But sitting in that little room just feels so holy, especially with the statues nearby.

      After finding out how much I didn't know about Galilee I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised to find out that Nazareth wasn't the tiny burg I pictured. More from William Barclay:   One of Jesus' very early visits was to Nazareth, his home town. Nazareth was not a village. It is called a  polis  which means a town or city; and it may well have had as many as 20,000 inhabitants. It stood in a little hollow in the hills on the lower slopes of Galilee near the Plain of Jezreel. But a boy had only to climb the hilltop above the town and he could see an amazing panorama for miles around.  Sir George Adam Smith described the scene from the hilltop. The history of Israel stretched out before the watcher's eye. There was the plain of Esdraelon where Deborah and Barak had fought; where Gideon had won his victories; where Saul had crashed to disaster and Josiah had been killed in battle; there was Naboth's vineyard and the place where Jehu slaughtered Jezebel; there was Shunem where Elisha had lived, there was Carmel where Elijah had fought his epic battle with the prophets of Baal; and, blue in the distance, there was the Mediterranean and the isles of the sea.  Not only the history of Israel was there; the world unfolded itself from the hilltop above Nazareth. Three great roads skirted it. There was the road from the south carrying pilgrims to Jerusalem. There was the great Way of the Sea which led from Egypt to Damascus with laden caravans moving along it. There was the great road to the east bearing caravans from Arabia and Roman legions marching out to the eastern frontiers of the Empire. It is wrong to think of Jesus being brought up in a backwater; he was brought up in a town in sight of history and with the traffic of the world almost at its doors.

      Patty Bonds at  Envoy Encore  hits the nail on the head with  urlLink The Most Important Thing About Me is That I Am Catholic .   The most important thing about me is that I am Catholic.  All other titles, roles, and forms of identity fall subordinately under that word.  Everything that I am or do is ordered by that allegiance.  By that single word I declare what creed I believe and live by.  By that word I declare how I work, spend my free time, train my children, spend my money, decorate my house, drive my car, treat my neighbor, choose my clothing, pay my taxes, and live a chaste life.   Amen, sister!

       Sometimes the Truth Hurts   I constantly am surprised by people who are furious that their pro-choice stance is equated to being pro-abortion. Before I converted and began reading Church teachings, I also was pro-choice. I knew it meant supporting abortion but I didn't have any problem with that. I wasn't sure if God existed much less if that little cluster of cells had a soul. What was a soul anyway? How could anyone really know the truth? I saw it as support for personal freedom.  Now I am a Catholic and have a better understanding of freedom. After a  lot  of reading how this issue goes back to God's commandments I am solidly pro-life. Why this sudden declaration of belief? I read letter to the  Dallas Morning News  titled  Not Pro-abortion . The author was upset that the March for Women's Lives was presented as a "pro-abortion rally" by the  DMN . He gave a rundown of the varying types of people who accompanied him on the March. He had a none too logical but spirited list of other issues pro-choice people support. The problem is that his list was full of things like contraception and family planning. To a pro-lifer, these are just code for abortion in different forms.  First I got angry. Then I reread that letter and began to see that he just didn't know how to read the code. No wonder the poor guy was so upset. The real issue has been so blurred and obscured that pro-choice people often haven't got a clue just what they really  are  supporting. The "Father of All Lies" has done a great job on this one. They hear the truth and they don't like what they hear. Either they are fanatically devoted to "the cause" because it is all they have or they have been duped. Neither is pleasant to discover.  I have friends on all sides of this issue. The difference between my pro-choice friends and the letter writer is that they generally are open to questioning and discussing various matters. When this is done in friendship and charity on both sides it often opens people's eyes. If nothing else it can plant those seeds of knowledge for later growth.  Never have I better understood the power of truth. I have met Him and He has set me free. I am glad I read that letter. I now have a new compassion for the angry pro-choice supporters. Certainly I will be praying for that letter writer and all those like him.

        urlLink My Neighbor Totoro   Ok, your kids  might  have seen this but chances are if they have it is because you know my kids. Thanks to Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z my girls got attached to Japanese animation (anime) when they were little. Then they moved on to kids' manga (Japanese graphic novels) which is where Sailor Moon, etc. actually began.  Anime usually doesn't have much of a U.S. following, except among true movie lovers, because they don't follow the expected pattern. For one thing, they are animated but aren't produced by Disney (or Dreamworks). For another, they tend to show in art houses which also are unfamiliar to a lot of folks.  We heard of My Neighbor Totoro and were surprised to find it available for rental. Eventually we had to buy our own copy, which my daughters now take with them when baby sitting. This delights the kids and annoys the parents because then their children start pestering them to buy the movie.  My Neighbor Totoro is a charming, original story by a famous Japanese filmmaker. It is the story of two young girls and their father moving to a new home in the forest. The girls go exploring and come across Totoro, a giant forest spirit. Check out the reviews at Amazon for the full story. Or borrow it from me!

       The Fifth Column  has a great article about the  urlLink Original Intent  of the framers of the Constitution. It examines what has been wrought by intent based on "faith alone" or "reason alone" and draws some insightful conclusions. Its well worth a read.   Ultimately, the question of responsibility lies at the heart of the founders’ concerns precisely because it lies at the heart of everyone’s concerns. In this, the founding fathers were not particularly insightful. We all want people to be responsible. We just have different ideas of what that means.

      Our Sunday night ritual is for the girls and me to watch Alias. Sometimes Tom joins us while working on his laptop, looking up just long enough to point out gaping plot holes. Hey, we can handle the plot holes as long as we get Sydney's fab aliases and kick-boxing. Sure, there's some gross violence but that's balanced out by the fact that Jack and Sloane are the coolest old guys on TV, while Vaughn and Sark are some of the cutest young ones. However, this season has been a distinct disappointment. The first half was a long, boring soap opera while Syd tried to regain her memory and the last half has turned into some kind of X-files wanna-be. This just becomes more apparent as we have been watching the 1st and 2nd season DVDs. It is so bad that the girls finally have gotten to the point of vowing to skip next season if the first few shows aren't improved. Believe me, if those devoted fans are swearing off, the show has nowhere to go but down.  Alias has enriched our lives beyond just Sunday night bonding, though. I actually was declared "cool" by both daughters AND their friends after putting together an outfit for Hannah's birthday at Urban Outfitters based on what Sydney would wear. That's never been a goal of mine but was gratifying just the same! (The only other time that's happened was when I started this blog ... although I'm sure they will rarely read it.)

      Now for some of that very interesting info I came across studying Luke. It never would have occurred to me to question why Jesus began his ministry in Galilee. It was home, he already was there, etc. It seems there were other good reasons for starting out there. William Barclay says Galilee was incredibly fertile and supported a large population. The Galileans were famous for accepting new ideas and revolutionary changes. Basically, Galilee was jammed full of open-minded folks who understood the context of everything Jesus said. I suddenly started imagining Jesus speaking to the multitudes in California today. No wonder the orthodox types had a problem, especially once you threw in Jesus' radical message. Here's what Barclay says:   Galilee was an area in the north of Palestine about fifty miles from north to south and twenty-five miles from east to west. The name itself means a circle and comes from the Hebrew word  Galil.  It was so called because it was encircled by non-Jewish nations. Because of that, new influences had always played upon Galilee and it was the most forward-looking and least conservative part of Palestine. It was extraordinarily densely populated. Josephus, who was himself at one time governor of the area, says that it had 204 villages or towns, none with a population less than 15,000. It seems incredible that there could be some 3,000,000 people congregated in Galilee.  It was a land of extraordinary fertility. There was a proverb which said that,  "It is easier to raise a legion of olive trees in Galilee than to bring up one child in Judaea."  The wonderful climate and the superb water supply made it the garden of Palestine ...  The Galileans themselves were the Highlanders of Palestine. Josephus says of them,  "They were ever fond of innovations and by nature disposed to changes, and delighted in seditions. They were ever ready to follow a leader who would begin an insurrection. They were quick in temper and given to quarreling." "The Galileans,"  it was said,  "have never been destitute of courage." "They were ever more anxious for honor than for gain."   This is the land in which Jesus began. It was his own land; and it would give him, at least in the beginning, an audience who would listen and kindle at his message.

      I didn't really mean to drag everyone along with me through my study of Luke, but I'm coming across some amazing facts about life and times back then. First I must stop for a moment to qualify a few things about William Barclay, who is the source of a lot of this "wow!" material in his Daily Bible Study Series. He was recommended by my friend, Mary G., who is a Bible study veteran. On Amazon I repeatedly saw reviewers mention that he was really great as long as you watched out for his theology. No kidding.  My jaw literally dropped when reading about the Nativity and seeing how many alternatives Barclay offered that would allow Jesus' birth to be called "virgin" but yet really have Joseph as his fully natural father.   So why use his commentary? Barclay's strengths are his phenomenal knowledge of the Greek language, the Jewish culture and religion, and the Roman occupation during the New Testament era. He is wonderful at conveying this knowledge in a way that simple and easily understandable. He puts it in context so that you can understand what events meant to the people to whom Jesus spoke to 2,000 years ago.  His application of those events to modern lives is less successful. Sometimes it works, as we saw with Jesus' temptation in the wilderness (May 3), and sometimes it doesn't. Regardless, the historical context is so wonderful that I am willing to suffer the other parts of his writing.

      The girls and I went to see "The Alamo" this weekend. I didn't go in expecting a "feel good" movie. As a transplanted Texan I know the story much better than I did growing up in Kansas. I came out of it feeling the same way I did after watching "The Patriot" ... war is brutal, cruel, and, ok I'll say it, hell. It was really well done and found that delicate balance between real characters and legend. Certainly the filmmakers made us understand that both sides suffer and people of all sorts are caught up in the conflict. I also really admired the performances, especially Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett. I suppose that is nothing that we haven't read in reviews already. My two realizations were:    As we watched the Mexican Army swarm the Alamo from all sides, familiar defenders began to die. I suddenly realized that in most movies like this I expect to lose a few favorite characters but we always know that some will live and prevail in the end. That wasn't going to happen here. I mentally compared it to the "Lord of the Rings" movies which I loved. Suddenly all those battle scenes seemed clean and sanitized, fangs and gore notwithstanding. "The Alamo" didn't follow that formula because it was following real life. (Just one of those mental head-slap moments.)    Our 13-year-old, Rose, and I know WAY too much about Goliad. I helped her with a research project last year and we both became "experts." Discussing this movie, we discovered that we also are devoted to making sure Goliad isn't forgotten. I'm sure there were a zillion historical details wrong but we only cared about the fact that no one ever bothered to explain why Fannin never came from Goliad with aid. Santa Anna's army already had executed Fannin and his army after they surrendered. That's one reason the Alamo defenders didn't surrender. They'd heard the news from Goliad. That's why the battle cry at San Jacinto was,  "Remember Goliad! Remember the Alamo!"  [courtesy of the "Remember Goliad" research committee, J Davis and R Davis]     Van Helsing Anyone?  Next up is "Van Helsing." You'd think that Rose would choose "13 Going On 30" for a birthday party movie, right? No such luck. I'll get to take 9 girls to see a monster movie. Granted, Hugh Jackman is looking mighty fine from what I could see in the trailers. I'm not sure that is enough to get me through 2 hours and 20 minutes!

      The May issue of Crisis has a fantastic article by Archbishop John J. Myers,  The Church vs. the Culture: The Score Thus Far . It is one of the best and most even handed pieces I've ever read on the culture war. I have read Peter Kreeft's  How to Win the Culture War  and  Ecumenical Jihaad . I liked both books and especially appreciated the passion and immediacy brought to the subject. However, this article pulls back from that stance to offer historical perspective while reminding us of the necessary solution.  Archbishop Myers states the problem in a nutshell.   The process of secularization has reduced many people's view of religion. God is seen only as a source of personal comfort. Any claims beyond this (there is truth, there is right and wrong, God will judge how we act, etc.) impinge upon absolute freedom and thus are illegitimate.  If liberty defined as license is the chief value ("to do what I want whenever I want to do it"), whatever God is understood to be, He cannot make any real demands on us. If God does have power over us and makes demands on us, then we are in fact not "free."  ...But God is not a threat to freedom. In fact, true freedom can only be found in Him. For in, with, and through Jesus, we discover who we really are. We discover our supreme vocation and ourselves. We become sons and daughters in the Son. We discover our Father and our true home. We are changed by His power. But to believe that change is possible and desirable, one must reject the insipid mantra of the therapeutic society: "I'm OK; you're OK." I am most definitely  not  OK. You are not OK. We are all sinners in need of a Savior.   Then he reminds us that we are the solution to the problem by quoting the Holy Father's apostolic letter  Novo Millennio Ineunte .    It is not a matter of inventing a "new program". The program already exists: it is the plan found in the Gospel and the living Tradition; it is the same as ever. Ultimately, it has its center in Christ himself, who is to be known, loved and imitated, so that in him we may live the life of the Trinity, and with him transform history until its fulfillment in the heavenly Jerusalem. This is a program which does not change with shifts of time and cultures, even though it takes account of time and culture for the sake of true dialogue and effective communication.   We still have to figure out how to apply this personally to each situation that we encounter daily. However, that always is the case. It is heartening to have these reminders that we are not facing anything that has not been faced by Christians since the beginning.

      Thanks to the members of St. Blog's who made me feel welcome. Special thanks to Dom at Bettnet for his kind words that directed people my way. It was a wonderful way to begin blogging.  On another note, I must say that this is even better than playing Baldur's Gate. I never expected so many quests, all with their own temptations to stray and rewards for right behavior. Whether to take a few minutes to figure out comments boxes or to get to the school at the promised time to help my daughter prepare for May Crowning? Should I try figuring out how to add all those sidebar goodies or wash the dishes? So far, so good, I'm still on the side of right because as everyone can see I've barely got the basics going.

      This is from my brother who is in Baghdad right now. After reading this e-mail, I am prouder than ever of him and our soldiers.    News from the field...the REAL deal   The 1st AD soldiers, who were extended by 4 months after spending a year in this hellhole of a dustpit called Iraq that nobody in their right mind would want, are responding as you would expect soldiers and true Americans to respond.  The first three days or so after they were told of the extension they complained and grumbled.  This is after they were both just days away from leaving Iraq or were in Kuwait cleaning their vehicles for the ship to go home to Germany.  Some of them had a couple of weeks leave during the last year to go and "visit" their families.  But even so, after the three days of complaints, they dusted themselves off (as much as is possible) and got back on their steel horses and continued the mission.  In the chow hall tonight I had the opportunity to talk with two of these fine troops.  One was a Specialist (E4) and the other was a Private First Class (E3).  They took it all in stride and told me simply that it was their mission, and that they accept it and of course, they wish they could have left, but there is still work to do and they would do it.  This was from two guys who were probably no more than 21 years old (if that.)  How many of the youth you have dealt with in the last two days or weeks would be up to as much?  Probably more than you would think.  There are a couple of points I want to make here.  The Army is not a last resort for the lower classes who have no education or motivation and are looking for "legitimized" welfare.  The soldiers who are here are committed to YOUR security.  By fighting the terrorist on their home turf, we don't have to fight them on ours. These guys know what commitment is and are ready to stand by their word.  These are YOUR Americans.  They do this for YOU and for our families.  I doubt that I would have been as good as these guys, were I 20 and in their position.  I would ask that you take a look at yourself, and make sure that you enjoy your way of life so that soldiers willing to commit time away from their homes for the security of ours are not doing it in vain.  When you have a problem that just makes you mad or scared, remember us in Iraq, and know that you can just take a breath, and maybe your problems won't look so horrible after all.  In the end it is all about us, Americans, and how we respond to adversity.  On a closing note to my ranting here, I recently had a bite to eat with a very high ranking British officer who said that out of all the things he has seen here in Iraq, he is most impressed with the manner in which the American soldiers carry themselves, especially the ones who were extended while on their way home.  Time magazine finally picked the right people of the year...

      I'm Julie Davis, living in Dallas, married with two teenage daughters. I converted in 2000 and, like most converts, have a deep love for the Catholic faith. I'd love to be one of those deep thinkers who write long and insightful articles. However, my "talents" lie more in reading what everyone else writes and passing their insights on to everyone I know, along with a few comments of my own. That's what I'll be doing here, whether the sources are other blogs, books, friends, etc.  Of course, I also love books, movies, cooking, music and ... oh yes ... my family. So I'll no doubt have comments about those from time to time also.  I'm just getting started so will be adding links to other blogs and all those other nifty little features as I get them figured out.

       PART II  When I read William Barclay's commentary about Jesus' temptation I couldn't believe how it all tied in with recent conversations about politicians, truth, etc. Its like a manual of how to follow God closely while living a public life.   ... At this time Jesus was just about to begin his campaign. Before a man begins a campaign he must choose his methods. The temptation story shows us Jesus choosing once and for all the method by which he proposed to win men to God. It shows him rejecting the way of power and glory and accepting the way of suffering and the cross.   ... this is the most sacred of stories, for it can have come from no other source than his own lips. At some time he must have himself told his disciples about this most intimate experience of his soul.  ... The first temptation was to turn stones into bread ... The tempter said to Jesus,  "If you want people to follow you, use your wonderful powers to give them material things."  He was suggesting that Jesus should bribe people into following him.  The task of Christianity is not to produce new conditions, although the weight and voice of the church must be behind all efforts to make life better for men. Its real task is to produce new men; and given the new men, the new conditions will follow.  [The second temptation] is the temptation to compromise. The devil said,  "I have got people in my grip. Don't set your standards so high. Strike a bargain with me. Just compromise a little with evil and men will follow you."   It is a constant temptation to seek to win men by compromising with the standards of the world. G.K. Chesterton said that the tendency of the world is to see things in terms of an indeterminate grey; but the duty of the Christian is to see things in terms of black and white. As Carlyle said,  "The Christian must be consumed by the conviction of the infinite beauty of holiness and the infinite damnability of sin."    I had never thought before that the only one who could have told that story to anyone was Jesus. The rest of the Gospels are eyewitness accounts but that was from the Lord Himself. Wow!

       PART I  In working my way through Luke, I was reading commentaries about Jesus in the wilderness being tempted by satan. I was really struck by what the Navarre Bible says:   Our Lord's temptations sum up every kind of temptation man can experience:  "Scripture would not have said,"  St. Thomas comments,  "that once all the temptation ended the devil departed from him, unless the matter of all sins were included in the three temptations already related. For the cause of temptation are the causes of desires - namely, lust of the flesh, desire for glory, eagerness for power."   By conquering every kind of temptation, Jesus shows us how to deal with the snares of the devil. It was as a man that he was tempted and as a man that he resisted:  "He did not act as God, bringing his power into play; if he had done so, how could we have availed of his example? Rather, as man he made use of the resources which he has in common with us."  (St. Ambrose)  He wanted to show us the methods to use to defeat the devil - prayer, fasting, watchfulness, not dialoguing with temptation, having the words of God's Scripture on our lips and putting our trust in the Lord.   I looked at that and thought how it made that part of the Gospel come alive in my daily life. Those are all things that I can remember and use ... and need!

      Yesterday was the feast of St. Joseph the Worker and this reading from Magnificat was simple but perfect. It has the basic reminder I need I am slogging through my day ... all work has meaning.    Saint Joseph the Worker  by Monsignor Lorenzo Albacete  It seems to me, though, that such corporate efforts are misguided. There is no need to add "spirituality" to work; human work itself is already a spiritual act. It is a form of spirituality. It is only by confronting the daily demands of work that we deepen our interior dynamism. Upon impact with the world that is "other," our dynamism configures the demands or needs that define our human identity, such as the quest for justice, truth, beauty, and fulfillment. It is this that links us with the Infinite. This is the realm of an authentic human spirituality. Therefore, it is not that spirituality "adds" something to work, or improves performance, or makes it barely tolerable. Instead, work itself is meant to become a spiritual act and this happens when it is experienced as being at the service of the quest for the Infinite.  We are often called upon to do "mindless" work. But our spiritual task is to transform it. Emptying the trash can be considered mindless, but if I see it as a contribution to the well-being of my family, it can be immensely significant for me.

      WHEN ITS BY BADLY DRAWN BOY The  urlLink About  a Boy  soundtrack achieves that supremely difficult goal of evoking the movie while standing on its own musically. Snippets of short instrumental pieces are interspersed between many standout original songs that cover the gamut of musical styles from old pop to techno. Surprisingly it seems to be universally pleasing. Several of the kids' friends have asked what the CD was so they could buy it. There's no way they'd even acknowledge something was playing unless it was cool. I hear that Badly Drawn Boy's usual style is more experimental and adventurous, which is what you'd expect. A good soundtrack can't be too eclectic or it doesn't do its job. So what I need to find out ... which to try? The Hour of Bewilderbeast or Have You Fed the Fish?

       urlLink This  is a good overview of the origins of priestly celibacy. Especially interesting to me is that although advocates of a married priesthood always use the early Church as an example, in actuality they were expected to cease marital life upon achieving the priesthood.    Based on solid documentation, these authors show that although one cannot speak of celibacy in the strict sense of the word (not being married), it is certain that since apostolic times the Church had as a norm that men elevated to the deaconate, priesthood and the episcopate should observe continence. If candidates happened to be married - a very common occurrence in the early Church - they were supposed to cease, with the consent of their spouses, not only marital life but even cohabitation under the same roof...  Moreover, Church officials believed a person in those conditions would hardly have sufficient strength to halt marital relations and live under the same roof. Cardinal Stickler emphasizes that because of the mutually self-giving nature of matrimony; a separation would always take place only with the full consent the wife, who, for her part, would make a commitment to live in chastity in a community of women religious.

      Actually, I'd take this as marching orders from  urlLink Catholic Ragemonkey . So let's get busy!  If you love your pastor, whatever the reason, stop tomorrow, write a note, phone him up, or get in touch somehow and tell him. Give him the reasons and tell him you are praying for him. If you hate your pastor, spend a half an hour in front of the Blessed Sacrament, and pray for both of your conversions.

      This is from the book  urlLink Beginning to Pray  by Anthony Bloom. Its an amazing book because it is so simple and easy to read but contains such theological depth and wisdom about prayer. The excerpt below is just the kind of thing I have to learn over and over again. Also, it has one of those classic saint tales that remind us no one is perfect ... so there is hope for each of us.  It is absolutely pointless to ask God for something which we ourselves are not prepared to do. If we say "O God, make me free from this or that temptation" while at the same time seeking every possible way of falling to just such a temptation, hoping now that God is in control, that He will get us out of it, then we do not stand much chance. God gives us strength but we must use it. When, in our prayers, we ask God to give us strength to do something in His Name, we are not asking Him to do it instead of us because we are too feeble to be willing to do it for ourselves.  The lives of the saints are enlightening in this respect, and in the life of St. Philip Neri just such an occasion is described. He was an irascible man who quarreled easily and had violent outbursts of anger and of course endured violent outbursts from his brothers. One day he felt that it could not go on. Whether it was virtue or whether he could no longer endure his brothers his Vita does not tell us. The fact is that he ran to the chapel, fell down before a statue of Christ and begged Him to free him of his anger. He then walked out full of hope. The first person he met was one of the brothers who had never aroused the slightest anger in him, but for the first time in his life this brother was offensive and unpleasant to him. So Philip burst out with anger and went on, full of rage, to meet another of his brothers, who had always been a source of consolation and happiness to him. Yet even this man answered him gruffly. So Philip ran back to the chapel, cast himself before the statue of Christ and said "O Lord have I not asked you to free me from this anger?" And the Lord answered "Yes, Philip, and for this reason I am multiplying the occasions for you to learn."  I think it is very important for us to realize that God will act in this way. He is not going to be crucified for you every day. There is a moment when you must take up your own cross. We must each take up our own cross, and when we ask something in our prayers, we undertake by implication to do it with all our strength, all our intelligence and all the enthusiasm we can put into our actions, and with all the courage and energy we have. In addition, we do it with all the power which God will give us. If we do not do this, we are wasting our time praying.

A good reminder for all of us.  And so these working-class Midwestern Mexicans taught me theology. They taught me that attending Mass has value even without receiving the Eucharist. They taught me that the future of American Catholicism will likely contain many who reverence the Eucharist enough to know when not to receive. Their example also exposes the churlish and spoiled outlook of many American Catholics who consider attending Mass and not receiving the Eucharist an unacceptable and foolish option.

       urlLink TWO BROTHERS  First of all, you should know that I really wasn't interested in seeing this movie. It looked like a simple story watching cute tiger cubs go through some not very dangerous crises. However, St. Francis of Dallas (a.k.a. Hannah the animal lover) chose it and I'm in her debt because it was excellent.   This story of two tiger brothers who are separated from their parents and each other in captivity is a much more interesting and complex movie than I anticipated. It is not just a kid's film in my opinion. It was set in the 1930's in Thailand and showed a very realistic picture of how many people thought of animals. No actual brutality is shown but the implications led to several small children having to leave the film. Of course, there were sympathetic characters also. However it was VERY INTENSE. Late into the film I realized that the packed theater was very quiet (except for a few parents whispering explanations into kids' ears) and that was unusual because there were a ton of little kids there. The screen was bright and I could see all the faces. Everyone was intently watching. The difference was that many of the adults were showing signs of stress in how they were sitting. One dad in particular was repeatedly rubbing his face. I felt the same way. A couple of times I actually was reminding myself that this is a children's movie and therefore the happy ending would come ... naturally, it did.  This  urlLink Decent Films review  says most of what I felt much better than I could myself and is a more thorough look at the movie. I always have heard that  urlLink The Bear  by the same director is a great movie so now I'm going to have to rent it.

      Today's Mass reading is of Abraham bargaining with God for the lives of the people in Sodom and Gomorrah. In this case God promised the if 10 good men are found, He will spare thousands. As "In Conversation with God" points out, this is a glimpse of the solidarity of good. God sees our struggles to be faithful and it gives Him joy and delight.   God sets great store by those who struggle for sanctity.  God's delight is in the saints;  it is for their sake that He pours our his mercy and his forgiveness on others who may have done nothing themselves to merit it. It is a wonderful but at the same time a real mystery, that God so delights in those who journey towards sanctity.  Just as God allowed Abraham to bargain for those good men, He will listen to us when we ask Him for favors for those we love.   For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.  Ten just men would have been enough! People who are really holy more than make up for all the crimes, the abuse, envy, lack of loyalty, betrayal, injustice, selfishness ... of all the inhabitants of a great city. If we are united with the redeeming sacrifice of Jesus Christ, god will look with special compassion on our relatives, friends, acquaintances ... who have perhaps strayed from the path out ignorance, or error, or weakness ... or because they did not receive the graces that we have received. ... "Look, Lord" - we will say to him - "this person is better than he seems. He has good intentions. Help him!" And Jesus, who nevertheless knows the real situation, will move that person with his grace out of regard for our friendship with him ... Those who strive to be united to Christ truly sustain the world.

      I've been accused of seeing God's hand in everything (guilty as charged) and this just supports my case. What an amazing story.   urlLink FRIENDLY DOG PREVENTS KILLING SPREE  A Canadian man, driving a car packed with weapons and ammunition, was intent on killing as many people as possible in a Toronto neighbourhood but gave up the plan at the last minute when he encountered a friendly dog, police say ...  He had set himself up in an east-end park to load his weapons and then planned to drive around shooting. He later told police that a dog then approached and started playing with him.  The encounter melted the man's heart, and he then went in search of police to give himself up, police said.

      From  urlLink The Age .  The American author Ray Bradbury has demanded that Michael Moore return the title of his classic novel Fahrenheit 451.  Bradbury, whose science-fiction tome Fahrenheit 451 was published in 1953, blasted Moore, whose politically explosive film Fahrenheit 9/11 opened in North America this weekend, for using the title without permission and asked for an apology and for the film's name to be changed. "It's not a nice thing he has done," Bradbury, 83, said. "My book is known all over the world and that title is my title."  Bradbury said he wanted a public apology from director and author...

      1. God was all-complete, all-blessed in Himself; but it was His will to create a world for His glory. He is Almighty, and might have done all things Himself, but it has been His will to bring about His purposes by the beings He has created. We are all created to His glory --- we are created to do His will. I am created to do something or to be something for which no one else is created; I have a place in God's counsels, in God's world, which no one else has; whether I be rich or poor, despised or esteemed by man, God knows me and calls me by my name.  2. God has created me to do Him some definite service; He has committed some work to me which He has not committed to another. I have my mission --- I never may know it in this life, but I shall be told it in the next. Somehow I am necessary for His purposes, as necessary in my place as an Archangel in his --- if, indeed, I fail, He can raise another, as He could make the stones children of Abraham. Yet I have a part in this great work; I am a link in a chain, a bond of connexion between persons. He has not created me for naught. I shall do good, I shall do His work; I shall be an angel of peace, a preacher of truth in my own place, while not intending it, if I do but keep His commandments and serve Him in my calling.  3. Therefore I will trust Him. Whatever, wherever I am, I can never be thrown away. If I am in sickness, my sickness may serve Him; in perplexity, my perplexity may serve Him; if I am in sorrow, my sorrow may serve Him. My sickness, or perplexity, or sorrow may be necessary causes of some great end, which is quite beyond us. He does nothing in vain; He may prolong my life, He may shorten it; He knows what He is about. He may take away my friends, He may throw me among strangers, He may make me feel desolate, make my spirits sink, hide the future from me --- still He knows what He is about.  O Adonai, O Ruler of Israel, Thou that guidest Joseph like a flock, O Emmanuel, O Sapientia, I give myself to Thee. I trust Thee wholly. Thou art wiser than I --- more loving to me than I myself. Deign to fulfil Thy high purposes in me whatever they be --- work in and through me. I am born to serve Thee, to be Thine, to be Thy instrument. Let me be Thy blind instrument. I ask not to see --- I ask not to know --- I ask simply to be used.  Venerable John Henry Newman

      First they pass on distributing  Fahrenheit 9/11 . Then they are giving out free Bible study guides when tickets are prepurchased to  urlLink Heart and Soul . There are several instances in the film where people refer to their faith in God, answered prayers, a miracle of Jesus and Providential sovereignty. I remember reading a highly favorable review of this at  urlLink Church of the Masses .  The feature length documentary ... is still a wonderful, visually stunning glimpse into the lives of "average" Americans from coast to coast, quietly doing interesting and individualistic things. There are profiles of rugweavers in the Appalachians, the last real cowboy in Telluride, Co, cliff dancers in California, a Gospel choir in Mississippi, a metal junk artist in the Pacific Northwest, and many more ... The film defines Americans as people of great passion for life, and for realizing big dreams.  Via  urlLink Bettnet .

      LUKE 9:59-60 This is one of those bits when Jesus sounded amazingly uncaring. He asks a young man to follow him, the young man wants to go bury his father first and Jesus tells him no way. William Barclay points out that it could have been a common expression that was an easy way to put off immediate action.  Jesus' words to the second man sound harsh, but they need not be so. In all probability the man's father was not dead, and not even nearly dead. His saying most likely meant, "I will follow you after my father has died." An English official in the East tells of a very brilliant young Arab who was offered a scholarship to Oxford or Cambridge. His answer was, "I will take it after I have buried my father." At the time his father was not much more than forty years of age.  The point Jesus was making was that in everything there is a crucial moment; if that moment is missed the thing most likely will never be done at all. The man in the story had stirrings to get out of his spiritually dead surroundings; if he missed that moment he would never get out.

      Let me count the ways ... that I love my iPod, of course!   It holds 1,000 songs and if you think that is a ludicrous amount let me tell you that it is not.   It resumes playing  exactly  where it stopped, something that annoyed me no end when my CD player would not do it.   It has a sound equalizer that is pretty good at playing all songs at the same volume.   You can listen not only by artist or album but also by playlist (one of my specialties) and music genre.   Listening with the ear buds has made some old songs seem new because you hear all sorts of little details that are lost in regular speakers.   Did I mention that its cute? And very cool? And PINK?   Oh yeah, its crass materialism but I love my iPod!

       urlLink The Heart of the Matter  from Catholic Ragemonkey  During the discussion of the Catechism, the topic came up about whether or not other religions are going to go to Heaven. Of course, I reiterated the Church's teaching concerning there being no salvation outside the Church, adding the notes about invincible and inculpable ignorance. This really bothered several people in the class. One woman in particular was just horrified that the Church could teach this. That all of these well-meaning people could be excluded from Heaven just because they don't hold the full picture of faith. And the rest of the class trotted out the same tired arguments, like a God of Love wouldn't send someone to Hell, e.g. That was when what was bothering me finally had a face.  For most folks, faith equals someone's opinion. If the revelation of God amongst Christians of every stripe can be confused into a galamafrey of different creeds, then that's okay as long as you are sincere. But that's the problem. Just because you sincerely believe something doesn't make it true. If I sincerely believe that arsenic is not poisonous, that doesn't mean I will be spared a trip to the emergency room, depending on how much I ingest...  If you spotted your child about to down the whole bottle of arsenic, although why you would have a bottle of arsenic lying about is beyond me, what would your reaction be? I suspect, hopefully correctly, that you would leap across the room and knock the bottle out of his hand, even before the word "STOP!" would be on your lips. And if this is a teenager we are talking about, you know that the little charmer would have an argument about how old-fashioned it is to think that arsenic is poisonous and anyway, everyone is doing it ...

      There's a new translation of the Bible out that the Archbishop of Canterbury is praising for its "extraordinary power." Well, its extraordinary all right ... extraordinarily funny and heretical, which is no small accomplishment. Its the  Good as New  Bible (or as Dom at  urlLink Bettnet  puts it "Satan's Bible") and here are a few samples. For one thing John the Baptist is now called the Dipper, Peter is Rocky (get it?), and Jesus isn't the Son of Man because he's actually The Complete Person.  MARK 1:10-11  Authorized version:  "And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him. And there came a voice from the heaven saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."  New:  "As he was climbing up the bank again, the sun shone through a gap in the clouds. At the same time a pigeon flew down and perched on him. Jesus took this as a sign that God's spirit was with him. A voice from overhead was heard saying, 'That's my boy! You're doing fine!'"  1 CORINTHIANS 7:1-2  KJV:  "Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, [to avoid] fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."  New:  "Some of you think the best way to cope with sex is for men and women to keep right away from each other. That is more likely to lead to sexual offences. My advice is for everyone to have a regular partner."  No it really isn't a joke ... well, ok, it  is  a joke but these people are dead serious. Read more about it on  urlLink Catholic and Enjoying It . Be sure to look at the comments because they're almost as good as the story itself.

      Remember a day or two ago when people were debating about why bother to write the  Dallas Morning News  series on "Runaway Priests" if no one would get excited over it?  Well guess who got excited after all. The Samoan government. They're taking steps to deport the fugutive priest who was "featured" in the first story. He'll be going back to Australia where he will face charges. A second priest is under investigation as well. Its nice to see that someone in authority cares, even if it is as far away from us as Samoa. See the story  urlLink here  (requires free registration). Via  urlLink Off The Record

      I didn't even know that there was an evacuation at the Reagan funeral but  urlLink Peggy Noonan  does her usual excellent job of making us feel the moment.  I heard reports later of pushing and shoving and people falling as the evacuation from the Capitol began. I saw none of this. I saw people running. And I saw Capitol Police standing their ground, directing people toward what they thought was the safe area, and I saw them running toward the Capitol to help people who needed them. I saw nothing but excellence. If these people had been at Pearl Harbor they would have manned the guns. I'll tell you who else stood their ground: the photographers for the news services and newspapers. Those crazy bastards took pictures of us running and then moved closer to where we were running from to get more dramatic pictures of the last to leave. Shooters, they are something.

      When watching our bishop's various shenanigans, I often have remarked to my husband that I wouldn't mind as much that our bishop doesn't show us any love if only he was a halfway decent business manager. But its pretty obvious that he can't run a business very well either. Yes, I know that's a very simple take on it but so often the truth is very simple.  The recent DMN expose about moving priests who are sexual predators gave rise to an intense comments boxes discussion over at  urlLink Catholic and Enjoying It . Father Shane Tharp ( urlLink Catholic Ragemonkey ) unwittingly supported my long-held "bad business manager" theory about American bishops. He also had some very interesting observations about the behavior of offender priests. I quote his comment in its entirety here but it is well worth reading the entire conversation thread.  In many cases, the offender priest tends to isolate himself from his brother clerics, hence he never shows up for diocesan functions, etc. If the offending priest did, then he might accountable to someone or at least, he runs the risk of being noticed as being up to something, i.e. strange behavior. This applies to priests struggling with alcoholism and a host of other problems. But in their parishes or particular assignments, they are adored. That charism Amy referred to comes shining through.  So what you have is a guy who doesn't let those who could help him or expose his problem see him, while those he can bamboozle are left in the dark.  Yes, I recognize that this is a gross simplification, but what can I do? I have only limited time.  I think that for the most part, we have to chalk up a lot of this to a lack of episcopal identity. The bishop thought he was a middle manager. So long as problems could be kept quiet or he didn't hear about it, then he didn't have to act. This attitude stands in marked contrast to the NT vision which makes him overseer and captain of the ship.  Again, I recognize it's a vast oversimplification. Take it for what it's worth.

      The moment when you hear God's call is a moment of recognition, a moment of receptivity and of deep openness. It is the moment when all we have to do is realize that we are creatures, and that it is God who calls us.  What is he calling us to? He is calling us to what each of us most deeply desires. He is calling us to a life that will bear fruit, for sterility is the most tragic thing that can happen to us. Remember the parable of the fig tree? God offers us fertility. He offers us a life of unimaginable fruitfulness...  We crave greatness for our lives, and God asks us to become little. To pass through the door that leads to his kingdom, we must go down on our knees. Paradoxically, if we do so, we will find ourselves growing in stature, for "eye has not seen and ear has not heard what God has reserved for those who love him."  This is a moment of choice. It is one of many such moments, for we will be called to choose every day of our lives until we die. But the fantastic thing about it is our freedom. We are utterly free to turn back from this power that draws us on. We are free to loose ourselves from the bonds of a love that demands our total surrender. Nothing prevents us from saying no. Nothing except God's love.   Servant of God Catherine de Hueck Doherty, via Magnificat magazine

      This is classic.  There is a rumor going around that I am the sort of person who kicks a man when he is down.  It is true.  I say that if a man needs kicking, it is best to take a good shot at him when he is most vulnerable. The best objection that I have heard to kicking a man when he is down is that it is not quite sporting. I hold that to kick a man for sport is bad. If he needs kicking, then he obviously poses some serious threat to the common good, and that a well-placed kick when he is down will probably keep him down longer, or at least will dissuade him from the behavior that required his kicking to begin with.

      SYNESTHESIA I was at out with my daughters, Hannah and Rose, recently when Hannah suddenly turned to us and said, "When I hear words it means a kind of food in my head." We said, "Huh?" (so eloquent). It turns out that ever since she can remember most words link to a food texture and image in her head. For example "also" is pretzels, "mother" is chocolate milk, "listen" is orange Triaminic. It isn't always food and it doesn't happen with every single word (for instance "squirrel" is just a squirrel) but it happens for practically every word she hears.  Luckily, Rose had heard something recently on the radio about people who see colors when they hear words. Thank heavens! I was seriously wondering what was wrong with Hannah.  Like most people in similar situations, Hannah knew this wasn't normal. After mentioning it once to a friend and her mother in the second grade, she kept it to herself. She only brought it up now because for some reason she told one of her friends at school. The friend "tested" her for a while and then said, "That is weird because for me every word means a number and a square or circle." The one person Hannah elects to confide in after all this time and she has a form of synesthesia too. What are the odds of that?  It has turned into a parlor trick where she will suddenly say, "'Julie' is pecan pie" or "'lady' is heavy folds of a skirt." There are little details that make it even more interesting (to me anyway). There are some words she simply will not use because they "link" to very unpleasant things. Also, Hannah told me today that the sensation is much stronger when she says the word than when she hears it. She said that is why she won't talk very much when she's sick. Even stranger is when she'll say that a certain word is a food but she can't describe it. She thinks it is something she hasn't had yet. She told us that a few years ago I suddenly started making this hamburger-gravy thing and that was when she knew what was in her head for a certain word. It always had been there but she hadn't eaten it before.  Anyway, I looked it up on the internet. You wouldn't believe how many word combinations I had to use to get a description but finally I found "synesthesia." It is a recognized condition of several senses being linked together. The most common variation is people who see colors when they hear words or sounds. It is genetically linked. I started wondering who else had this but never said anything because it is so strange. I told eight people over the next couple of days and always got one of two different reactions. Either no one had heard of it and had trouble understanding the concept OR they suddenly got a funny look on their faces and would admit to some sort of the same thing. One friend sees people's names as colors, one sees abstract art shapes when she hears loud music, and so on. I found a person on each side of our family who had a version of it. Hannah felt very free after hearing there actually was a scientific definition and started talking about it at school. Yep. She found a couple more people with different types.  So what is synesthesia? Most of the research about synesthesia has been done by Richard Cytowic who wrote a book about his findings,  urlLink The Man Who Tasted Shapes . As he is a neurologist it has a lot of science but it is interspersed with chapters that are easy to read about the people he worked with in studying this condition. The first thing I found that was understandable and remains the easiest to read was a transcript of an interview with Cytowic done on  urlLink ABC Radio National .   Richard Cytowic:  You know the word 'anesthesia' which means no sensation; well 'synesthesia' means joined sensation. And what is joined is two, three, or all five senses together. So that my voice, for example, to a synesthete is not just something that they hear, but also something that they see, or smell, or touch.  Music for example is not just a sound and a melody, but it's like a visual fireworks that they see in front of them on a little screen, rather than in the mind's eye.  ...we don't know why some people get it any more than we know why some people get migraine headaches or why some people are left-handed. They just are. And synesthesia is fairly rare; it happens in about one in 25,000 individuals world-wide. My initial estimate was like one in a million, but as people made themselves known to me over the course of 15 years, the incidence has dropped down, and we might find that in fact it's more common.  It occurs in women more than men; women are twice as likely to be synesthetic than men, and it also runs in families. So most synesthetes are surprised to discover as children that their playmates and families don't perceive the world in the same way. And they might make some innocent comment like, 'Oh Mummy, look I've drawn an airplane sound, or a helicopter sound' or they might talk about the colors of the individual letters - that 'A' is red and 'C' is blue, and things like that. And then they'll get a strange response like 'Are you crazy?' and then they'll learn to not talk about it for a long, long time, not quite sure about the reality of it themselves. But it is quite real.  Finding out that such a thing exists has left me full of wonder at the world we live in. Once again, God's creation has me laughing at the sense of possibility, surprise and playfulness that is all around us. It reminds me that our ways are not His ways and our thoughts are not His thoughts. Who would want to be boxed in by mere human imagination when we can have something like synesthesia lurking to jump out and add a whole new dimension to life?

      GetReligion is wondering why the lack of excitement in media and Catholic blogs over the DMN  urlLink series . There are a variety of answers, the most cogent of which can be found at  urlLink Bettnet  and  urlLink GetReligion  in the comments boxes. For one thing, I'm not so sure that the series isn't stirring comments from those who won't admit it ... the American bishops. They hate this sort of thing ... they are so misunderstood, dontcha know?  So if no one is getting excited then why do the story? I think that Rod Dreher nailed it in this comment. Its funny to think that DMN may be sowing the seeds that God ultimately will harvest as Church reform.  I think the ultimate value in what the DMN is doing with this series is simply bearing witness. One of these days, the rotten system we have that coddles and protects child-molesting clergy will shamble on will collapse of its own rottenness, and the Holy Spirit will send us true reform. Until that day comes, the Church will be told what it is doing. Somebody has to record these things, and let it be known to the bishops and archbishops and leaders of religious orders, the whole sorry lot of them, that We Are On to Them.  That's worth something, innit?  Yes it is.

       Heart, Mind & Strength  has some great thoughts from  urlLink Rachel Watkins  about God's endless creativity in reaching out to us and Satan's limits in doing the same. I hadn't thought about that before ... praise the Lord for Satan's limits!   I was thinking about that song as I was contemplating the myriad of ways God seeks to draw us back to ourselves.  He reaches out through the Church, friends, family, Scripture, saints and, yes, cheesy songs.  God has a limitless amount of mercy and an infinite arsenal of tools ready at his hand to draw us home to Him.  ... I've always believed that Satan cannot create, that is reserved for God alone.  God is the only Creator.  So, is Satan limited in how he can attack??  If so, it makes the spin on sin different for me.  It doesn't make me any less a sinner but it is a cause for praise to God that as I have gotten older certain tools used by Satan no longer have any appeal ...   Now, that isn't to say that there are 'new to me' sins that come with maturity but I am spending some time in grateful praise and thanksgiving that I have outgrown a good number of Satan's weapons.  And if Satan has a limited number of weapons to use against me, I just have to stay alive long enough to have all of them be rendered useless and I can die a saint!

      I have been catching up on the news, specifically the  Dallas Morning News   urlLink series  that is exposing how priests accused of sexually abusing children were deliberately reassigned, internationally if necessary, in order to hide them from the law. Often they are working in church ministries that put them in a position to commit the same crime again.  I wish I were more shocked but I can easily believe it after living in Dallas and watching our bishop. After all, it was fairly recently that he assigned Rev. Ernesto C. Villaroya to a Frisco parish and then was shocked when parishioners dared to protest his choice. Rev. Villaroya had been accused of raping a nun 20 years ago and fathering her child. This is just one of a long string of indignities that have been visited upon our diocese.  I applaud the DMN stories because until light is let into every dark corner there will be no healing. A Church with its head in the sand is not worthy to be Our Lord's bride. We will stumble and undoubtedly fall but at the very least we should be striving to do our honest best. I am seeing evidence of that from very few American bishops.

      WE'RE BACK FROM MONTREAL It was a great vacation and Montreal was very enjoyable if a bit hard for us to get used to.  I guess our problem can be summed up by Rose's and my reactions to it. Rose was bothered because it didn't seem right for somewhere that seemed so basically American (including the people) to have people speaking French in casual conversation. I was bothered because the French seemed right but it was too familiar, too American, to be a foreign country. However we got past all that. Montreal is a beautiful city and the weather was fantastic, although all the natives kept darkly mentioning the long, hard, terribly cold winters.  We really hit vacation mode once we got our Metro passes. It seems that our best vacations always take place when we can use the subway to get around. We took all but 3 of our 150 photos on the digital camera card and visited everything we could find, which mainly consisted of large, gorgeous churches. Montreal, like so much of the U.S. doesn't tend to have a lot of the monuments and memorials of the sort that we like to visit. What better for a bunch of "happy Catholics" to do than drop in on a lot of churches? My favorite was one we didn't plan to visit but wound up going to first because it was near the hotel ... Marie Reine du Monde (Mary, Queen of the World). It is a one-quarter size replica of St. Peter's in Rome, light, airy and a fitting tribute to Our Blessed Mother and Our Lord. We'll be posting photos later but for now a few of my favorite memories are:   Hannah saying a prayer on each of the 300 steps up to l'Oratoire St-Joseph while climbing on her knees ... yes, on her  knees . Somewhere in Japan her photo is going to be shown to everyone because one gentleman just couldn't believe it and took a long time getting just the right shot.   Rose saying a prayer on each step while  walking  up them and then sitting at the top of each flight to lend her sister moral support.   Visiting Basilique Notre Dame and talking to a young couple. The man kept repeating over and over in awestruck tones, "This is incredible." Then the woman turned to him and asked if he was ok. He had tears in his eyes and said, "I'm fine. I'm just having a moment."   Attending the Mass in French at Marie Reine du Monde. I looked sideways halfway through and realized that we were in the "crossfire" so to speak of the magnificent shrines to Mary and Jesus. Really a perfect moment.   Our whole family being convulsed with laughter while fighting over the only chair we could find, halfway through the McCord Museum. I was reminded then of why we take vacations ... to enjoy being with each other in a unique way that is our family's alone.   The entire vacation being punctuated by one-liners from The Simpsons, Futurama and This is Spinal Tap, thanks to Hannah and Rose. Again, its a family thing.   "The Name Game" which was played all over Montreal, with Tom and me supplying various options whenever someone got stuck, which happened more and more as our brains got more disconnected from "reality."

       urlLink THE EYRE AFFAIR  by Jasper Fforde Set in an alternate history, this novel not only has a good mystery but is hilariously funny to anyone who loves literature or the genre that Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams have made so popular. Set in Great Britain around 1985, the Crimean War is still going on after 131 years, Wales has become The People's Republic of Wales and literature and art are the most popular fads of the day. Thursday Next is a detective in the Literary Ops department. She is assigned to recover the Martin Chuzzlewit manuscript which has been stolen by arch-villain Archeron Hades. Hades kidnaps Thursday's uncle who has invented a portal that allows people to enter books. After a minor character from Chuzzlewit is found murdered (and subsequently missing from every published book), the pressure heats up when Jane Eyre's manuscript is stolen next. This book not only has mystery and humor but a denied romance based around the angst of old war experiences. In other words, it has everything but somehow Fforde makes it all come together for a totally enjoyable experience.  My favorite parts were the ones that showed how thoroughly literature was part of the overall culture ... kids trading Henry Fielding bubble gum cards, a live performance of Richard III with audience participation a la the Rocky Horror Picture Show, the fact that everyone Thursday meets has their own theory about who wrote Shakespeare's plays and is conversant with all the details of the other theories as well. It didn't hurt that Jane Eyre is one of my all time favorite books and it was delightful watching the manuscript's original wrong ending get turned by the story into the ending we all know in this history.

      IN SUNDAY'S DALLAS MORNING NEWS  urlLink Dom Bettinelli  has this breaking news which came from Rod Dreher. Head over there and take a look. The comments are just getting started on this one.  On Sunday, The Dallas Morning News will begin publishing the results of a major yearlong investigation into a largely uncovered aspect of the Catholic sex abuse scandal. The series of stories are international in scope, and will make headlines nationally and overseas. I’m not at liberty to disclose details yet, but I’ve seen advanced copies of the articles, and they are devastating. I believe at this point, more details will be available on Friday morning, when one of the reporters on the series does an interview on National Public Radio’s “Morning Edition.” The stories will be available on the dallasnews.com website starting either late Saturday night or early Sunday morning.  Just my luck, I'll be out of town until late Monday. I guess if its really huge news I'll see it in Canada. I believe Rod on this one. Maybe this is what it will take to bring the bishops to the point where they have to face the consequences of so many years of neglect and inaction in their duties. Or maybe this is what it will take for the Vatican to finally step in and clean things up.    My guess  is this is to do with the scandalous way that I've heard a lot of seminaries are run ... lavendar mafia anyone? If so, it is about time that these stories are splashed everywhere. No true change will happen without that being exposed and cleaned up.

      AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE  Holland's Minister of Public Health, Mrs. Borst, recently spoke about a handicapped child who was killed after being born. (By the way, "borst is a Dutch word for "breast," but in the minister's case, she seems to have no heart beating in hers.) She said that, according to penal law, it is murder, but the Officer of Justice will not prosecute in this case because the mortal injection was given by the doctor after consultation with the parents. In any case, she declared this child had little chance of "achieving an acceptable level of value of human life."  I saw some of this quote on  urlLink Fiat Mihi  when I was cruising the blogosphere today. The blog deliberately didn't list a source, which is just about as good a way as declaring it invalid as any I know of. Given the horrific nature of what I read, I was intensely curious so I went a "Googling" and found it on the first try in an article,  urlLink Hellish Holland , written by a priest chronicling his experiences in minstering to a society where euthanasia and suicide basically are lifestyle choices. Possibly the reason no source was given was because it was in a Society of St. Pius X newsletter. I know they are out of communion with the Roman Catholic Church but that does not have anything to do with the validity of this priest's experiences.  Further research turned up a plethora of articles about the nature of euthanasia and suicide in Holland. I had a vague idea that things were bad there but had no idea how bad. An  urlLink interview  with the Dutch Minister of Health reveals that she views euthanasia and suicide as quality of life decisions. It was chilling to read about the grandmotherly figure speaking of helping out 95 year olds who had no health problems but were "bored with life."  Holland is like the test case for how it will go for the Terri Schiavos of the world and anyone else who is inconvenient to those who have any power over them. After looking through a lot of those articles I would be willing to say that God has been bringing good from Terri Schiavo's sad situation by using it to bring public awareness of what a slippery slope we are poised on. Perhaps this is something that everyone else is well informed about but I had no idea. Once again, I have to ask the question ... why isn't the media telling us about this?  If you want to read more,  urlLink International Task Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide  is a good place to get started.  An excellent book that addresses the issue of quality of life is  urlLink The Power of the Powerless: A Brother's Legacy of Love  by Christopher De Vinck. This book together with the prominence of the Terri Shiavo case are what have had the greatest influence on my opinions about our utter lack of ability to really judge the quality of life for another person.

      Oswald Sobrino at  urlLink Catholic Analysis  does it again with some very powerful thoughts on how best to turn the other cheek. As he points out, obviously there are times when we must act but what is the best way to do it when keeping in mind Jesus' command? This is something I'll come back to again and again as I struggle with how to communicate the truth.  A powerful way to change the game of hostility is to state the truth. Not shouting the truth, not pushing the truth, but simply and calmly stating the truth about what our enemies have really said.And so what the enemy is met with is not the same aggression they have meted out, but with a challenge to think about what they are saying or doing. The goal of trying something different from conventional tit-for-tat is to transform the enemy. That transformation recognizes that the enemy is created in the image of God with a rational nature that is vulnerable to the truth. Saying the truth is fruitful. It never returns empty. It is the mustard seed that should never be underestimated.

      LUKE 9:52-53 We're always hearing about deep hostility between the Samaritans and the Jews. I'd forgotten all about this incident when a Samaritan village tells Jesus' messengers that He can just keep on walking. James and John want to call down fire on the village (got to love those Sons of Thunder) but Jesus says no and they move on. Of course, a little later in Luke there comes the story of the good Samaritan and again we hear about that hostility. The Navarre Bible points out that the Samaritans aren't just another pagan tribe, which would be easy to ignore. Based on this description, I can easily see the hatred between them because the Samaritans would see the Jews as "holier than thou" while the Jews would despise the Samaritans for not "keeping the faith."  The Samaritans were hostile towards the Jews. This enmity derived from the fact that the Samaritans were descendants of marriages of Jews with Gentiles who repopulated the region of Samaria at the time of the Assyrian captivity (in the eighth century before Christ). There were also religious differences: the Samaritans had mixed the religion of Moses with various superstitious practices, and did not accept the temple of Jerusalem as the only place where sacrifices could properly be offered. They built their own temple on Mount Gerezim, in opposition to Jerusalem (cf. Jn 4:20); this was why, when they realized Jesus was headed for the Holy city, they refused him hospitality.

      There's a great interview in  urlLink Godspy  with Randall Sullivan, author of The Miracle Detective.  I don't see how any Catholic, or any Christian, for that matter, can sincerely reject a belief in private revelations. My understanding of faith is that it always results from a revelation - in whatever form that may take - of the love of God. We know that love only when we allow ourselves to be touched by it, when we choose to accept the gift that is perpetually being offered to us. I don't say this to advocate the sort of sappy credulity that supports cultism, but simply to affirm what my own experiences tell me - that intrusions of a supernatural force into the natural world are intended to remind us that what remains invisible nevertheless exists.

      Clay Randall at  urlLink Mental Pompeii  has a fabulous post about Stem Cell research. As a doctor on his hospital's Ethics Committee he has the opportunity to live his convictions.  Note how NIH tries to minimize the fact that you're taking stem cells from an unborn person while at the same time trying to make the artificial distinction between fertilization occuring through sexual intercourse and fertilization occurring in the lab which is...well.....artificial. Perhaps they're hoping the the terms "trophoblast", "blastocoel", and "blastocyst" will disguise the fact that we're talking about a human being? While there is indeed "potential" in these embryonic stem cells, there is also potential in adult stem cells (umbilical cord, bone marrow, etc) which do not carry with it the same ethical considerations. Is it coincidence that rarely does the media discuss the problem of stem cell rejection by the immune system or the malignancies that can result?  Here are two wonderful articles that Randall linked to which point out what I had read elsewhere but couldn't find lately ... adult stem cells are getting good results in research while embryonic stem cells have major problems, like a tendency to cause cancerous tumors. I have to echo Randall's questions on this. Why don't we ever hear this from major media?    urlLink The Stem Cell Cover-Up  by Michael Fumento    urlLink The Wrong Tree: Embryonic stem cells are not all that  by Wesley J.

      LUKE 8:22-25 Reading about Jesus calming the waters I always imagine a little boat full of people and some high waves. I tend to think more of the metaphors that always are trotted out in homily after homily. I rarely think about what being in an actual storm in a small boat would be like. Again William Barclay adds some historic perspective that makes the scene come alive, both in imagination and in application to all those metaphors. This is not just about some high waves or tough times of life. It is about those times when you're not sure if the boat is upside down or right-side-up and you're hanging on for dear life.  Then the storm came down. The Sea of Galilee is famous for its sudden squalls. A traveler says, "The sun had scarcely set when the wind began to rush down towards the lake, and it continued all night long with increasing violence, so that when we reached the shore next morning the face of the lake was like a huge boiling cauldron." The reason is this. The Sea of Galilee is more than six hundred feet below sea level. It is surrounded by table lands beyond which the great mountains rise. The rivers have cut deep ravines through the table lands down into the sea. These ravines act like great funnels to draw down the cold winds from the mountains; and thus the storms arise. The same traveler tells how they tried to pitch their tents in such a gale. "We had to double-pin all the tent-ropes, and frequently were obliged to hang on with our whole weight upon them to keep the quivering tabernacle from being carried up bodily into the air."

       urlLink THE MIRACLE DETECTIVE: An Investigation of Holy Visions  by Randall Sullivan I was intrigued because this book is about Medjugorje which I hear friends mention in awestruck tones but never see mentioned when reading about places where Mary has appeared. I picked up the 448-page book from the library intending to glance at the first chapter and see if it looked worth reading. To say that I found this story gripping is an understatement. I read it in 24 hours. This was facilitated by the fact that I had hurt my back and was forced to do nothing but sit around the house but that couldn't account for my fascination.  Randall Sullivan became fascinated with religious apparitions when a local family began seeing the Virgin Mary appear in a painting hanging in their trailer.  He thought this would be a great subject for a book and started on a journey that would take him to Rome, Medjugorje, Scottsdale (AZ) and New York City. Along the way, he unexpectedly began a personal, spiritual journey of discovery. In the process, Sullivan uses an even handed approach to give a lot of information including describing the Catholic Church's process for investigating and approving miracles; detailing the apparitions at a variety of places including Lourdes, Fatima and Medjugorje; and giving an in depth history of Bosnia including the fighting that was going on while he was there. Some reviewers disapproved of these "side trips" but I liked having so much information about most of the subjects. The step by step look at discovery of apparitions at various holy sites was fascinating and more detailed than anything I had been able to find anywhere else. Certainly I had no idea that a group of people had claimed to experience apparitions of Mary and Jesus in Scottsdale, Arizona.  I found the interspersing of factual reporting and personal story of discovery worked very well. Because Sullivan is sorting out what he thinks of all this, as well as coming to terms with God personally, we see all sides. I especially appreciated the reminder that most priests are not welcoming of apparitions as they can come from a variety of things: the person is faking, the person is crazy, the apparitions are demonic or they are true. As Father Benedict Groeschel reminds Sullivan, they can come from a combination of those things also. For me, Groeschel's inclusion in the book, albeit brief, was one of the things that pointed to an honest effort at truth seeking. The first book I ever read about apparitions was his  urlLink A Small, Still Voice: A Practical Guide on Reported Revelations   which reminded the reader that the first thing anyone is supposed to do is to reject an apparition as it is too easy to fool yourself or be fooled by outside influences. That advice made a strong impression on me and added a note of verisimilitude as it was repeated throughout the book by priests on both sides of any given apparition sighting.  I also liked the fact that emphasis is made toward the end of the book that the Church depends on time to help reveal whether apparitions are truly from God. Not only does it help calm the attendant public hysteria that may accompany revelations, it gives enough time to properly evaluate the theology of any messages, etc. The only revelation that we are required to believe is entirely public ... the Scriptures. As to all others it does not hurt to reserve judgment. There is a famous case of a well accepted series of "revelations" made to a nun long ago only to have her make a deathbed confession that she had sold her soul to the devil in exchange for her supernatural abilities. No wonder the Church is cautious.  On a personal level the most endearing thing I found was that the author's personal revelations of God always were accompanied by hilarity, as if God and he were laughing at a huge joke together as Sullivan would suddenly "get it." This went along perfectly with someone in the book who said that she had found Jesus has a great sense of humor and always was making jokes. It sounds so silly, so corny and, as it is just what I have experienced myself, so true.  Needless to say, I highly recommend this book. Also highly recommended for anyone interested in apparitions are  A Small Still Voice  mentioned earlier and  urlLink Apparitions: Mystic Phenomena and What They Mean  by Kevin Orlin Johnson.

      Mark Shea gets a more public forum than usual in today's  Dallas Morning News editorial,   urlLink Don't use Reagan's passing to push a ghastly program  (free registration required). He's saying what many in St. Blog's have been pointing out since Nancy Reagan started talking about stem cells this week. Adult stem cells or those from the umbilical cord are just as viable as those from embryos and harm no one in the "harvesting."  Stem cells have other sources besides artificially created children. For instance, they can be harvested from umbilical cord blood without taking innocent life. Those who push for stem cells that involve the taking of innocent human life do so not because of some sort of medical necessity but because there is gold in them thar hills to be had from the creation of an immense, wealth-generating industry dedicated to the manufacture and destruction of innocent human life. It is ironic that those most critical of Mr. Reagan and his "Decade of Greed" are those most staunchly in favor of the creation of a system that is entirely (and needlessly) about the exploitation of innocent human life for the sake of Mammon.   As Shea says, he already can "feel the love" as hostile responses started coming in.

       HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN  The girls and I saw the new Harry Potter movie and gave it three thumbs up. Best Harry Potter movie yet. The first movie looked picture perfect but we were distinctly disenchanted because it lacked heart and soul. Perhaps this was emphasized by the fact that the first Lord of the Rings movie came out at the same time and proved that the story didn't have to be told in every detail (no Tom Bombadil, I know, get over it) to capture the essence that made the book great. We didn't bother with the second HP movie for that very reason.  This movie, however, looked different just from the trailers. More real. More interesting. Different from the first two. What an improvement this was. Yes, this movie is missing some plot points but nothing that leaves huge holes in the story. Ok, it would have been nice to get the back story on the map, thus showing why Snape is so awful all the time, but big deal. The acting was better, the kids actually got dirty in their adventures, the scenery was fabulous and you felt as if this was a real place not just movie sets. The Leaky Cauldron especially felt like one of those British places that's been in use for 400 years. I'm actually looking forward to the next HP movie.  Just to add to my enjoyment, Rose found that Cleolinda had finished  urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in Fifteen Minutes . The perfect top off to the movie.

      How fitting that after all we have been hearing about controversy over who should receive the Eucharist, the Holy Father is convoking the  urlLink The Year of the Eucharist  from October 2004 to  October 2005.  In the Eucharist, "Christ gives his Body and Blood for the life of humanity. And all those who nourish themselves worthily at his table, become living instruments of his presence of love, mercy and peace," the Pope explained.  The Eucharist isn't a symbol. It isn't a "right". We strive to be worthy of it as I was reminded when watching one of my daughters be blessed instead of take communion because she hadn't been to confession lately. Such a thing hadn't ever occurred to me before but this was one of those times when I was instructed by my children. Would that the Year of the Eucharist will continue that instruction for us all.

I don't know if it is a full moon or misplaced zeal, or what... but it happens. A wild idea will come to my mind and, presuming it is not contrary to divine and civil law, I go for it.

       urlLink Belesarious queritat hic  says, "I think that  music  is proof that God wants us to be happy!"  I couldn't agree more. Evidence like that is all around us if we only take the time to notice it. Yesterday I was wandering around a bead store while the girls got jewelry making supplies (a nice cheap hobby, of course!). I started looking at the vast array of textures, colors, weights, etc. of all the things the beads were made of ... coral, turquoise, topaz, pearls, quartz ... the list goes on and on. I thought about how small minded we are not to notice God all around. He is so generous that He gave all that extravagant variety  and most of it is buried where we can't even see it! These pleasures may be fleeting like live music or buried like gems but they are everywhere. We just have to open our eyes and recognize it.

      I finally have gotten the chance to read the Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial,  urlLink Catholics must make a choice , that has been mentioned around St. Blog's Parish. Talk about laying it on the line. That editorial was succinct and pithy, lauding the few bishops who have spoken up to defend Communion from people whose public actions don't support their talk of "personal faith." If its even that obvious to this secular newspaper then how far in the sand do some of these politicians and bishops have their heads buried? Or, perhaps more to the point, who do they think they're fooling?   Now a few brave bishops have wearied of these Pontius Pilate imitations remember, he voted for Jesus before he voted against him, and personally, he still didn't see anything wrong with the poor guy as he sent him up the hill to be crucified. These bishops are demanding that Catholics make a grown-up choice: Is Catholicism your faith or just your label? It's a fair question and, yes, indeed, it applies to every Catholic, not just the politicians...   Politicians, rationalize as you will. But if you're not voting according to your personal beliefs, you're subordinating your own wisdom to the demands of people with whom you disagree. Think about how little sense that makes, and how little respect that deserves.  Catholic voters, vote as you wish. No bishop will be looking over your shoulder. But if your political beliefs lead you to reject the religious or moral teachings of the church, go in peace.  In fact, what these bishops are saying is: You're already gone.

      I remember when I read the  Envoy  article  urlLink Looking for God in all the wrong places ... like KOLOB . An expose of true Mormon beliefs, it seemed so outrageous that I really had a hard time believing that Mormons were very well educated in their faith. How could you really believe that we are the "spirit children" of God who lives with his wife on the planet Kolob? Or that, if you live a devout life you'll get your own planet and "spirit children" when you die? Along comes Bob McCue, a former Mormon, to tell us what it is really like. Lo and behold, that article was true.  urlLink Bob McCue's Website  has the very open and honest writing of a man who thought long and hard before leaving his religion. I have not read everything there but plan to go back and look at all the entries. Most interesting to me is that McCue has posted not only post-Mormon writings but also those he wrote when he was a devout believer.  First, I began to break the Mormon rule that everything not supportive of the Mormon faith should be avoided. This led me to Mormon history as the professional historians write it - incredibly, at age 45 with three university degrees, a new genre for me. I quickly realized that I had been misled as to how Mormonism started, and hence what it was. I saw a pattern of Mormon leadership deception going back to Mormonism's beginnings with Joseph Smith, and was physically ill for months as I adjusted to this reality.  The suppressed aspects of Mormon history that most troubled me indicated many instances in which Mormon leaders deceived their followers and the public about important matters. Joseph Smith was the worst in this regard. His tendency to lie when in a tight spot bears a striking resemblance to the habits of shady stock promoters I have met in my legal practice.  I was particularly distressed by Smith's practice of using his authority as a religious leader to persuade women, including many who were married as well as young teenagers, to have sex with him. Smith denied the rumours that swirled around him in this regard for well over a decade, and indicated that God instructed him to lie because the people were not ready to hear the "truth" - that polygamy was God's eternal law and that all who wished salvation must obey it.  The main features of this sordid chapter in Mormon history are not disputed by knowledgeable Mormon leaders or scholars, when put on the spot. The facts are confirmed by multiple reliable sources, including affidavits given by many of Smith's "spiritual wives" that the Church itself collected shortly after he died. Mormons, at that time, were proud of polygamy. These affidavits settled a dispute with a splinter group as to when, how and by whom, polygamy was initially practiced. Mormon scripture today teaches that polygamy will be required of those who dwell with God in the highest realm of heaven, all of whom will be Mormon. Ironically, throughout most of Smith's life while he practiced polygamy, Mormon scripture expressly forbade it. This was part of the "people are not ready for the truth yet" public relations program Smith was running in those days.  Second, I was told by the Mormon leadership that I could believe what I wanted and remain a member of the Mormon Church. However, I could not speak to anyone outside of my immediate family about what I had discovered, regardless of their historical legitimacy.  And third, I thought that in spite of its untrustworthy beginning Mormonism perhaps had become worthwhile. So, I carefully considered the various significant teachings that distinguish Mormonism from other religions and wisdom traditions. This persuaded me that my family and I would likely be much better off without the advice of Mormon leaders.  Via  urlLink Bene Diction Blogs On  by way of  urlLink blogs4God

      Maybe its just me or (more likely) its the times we are living in ... it seems as if every time I read indictments from Jesus about being lukewarm, etc. It seems to apply directly to Catholic politicians or a lot of bishops. This morning's reading from  urlLink In Conversation with God  could have been written directly to those groups. But they are not the only ones Christ was talking to. He was talking to His followers ... us. Even more important is the need for self examination in light of this reading. Each of us is that shake of salt that makes a big difference as we lead our lives in the midst of our increasingly secular society. It is up to us to not become useless.  The first Christians were true  salt of the earth,  and they preserved people and institutions - the whole of society from corruption. What can it be that has happened in so many nations? Why is it that Christians should now be giving the sad impression that they are unable to slow down and halt that wave of corruption that is bursting in on the family, on schools and on institutions ...? The Faith is still the same. And Christ lives among us now just as He did previously. His power is still infinite - divine.  Only the lukewarmness of so many thousands, indeed millions, of Christians, explains how we can offer to the world the spectacle of a Christianity that allows all kinds of heresies and stupidities to be propounded within itself. Lukewarmness destroys the strength and endurance of the Faith, and is the soulmate, in both a personal and a collective way, of compromise and of a spirit of comfort-seeking  (P. Rodriguez,  Faith and Life of Faith ). It is difficult to explain many of the things that happen nowadays at a personal and at a public level if we do not bear in mind that so many people who should be awake, watchful and attentive have allowed their Faith to fall asleep; love has been snuffed out in so very many hearts. In many spheres, the "normal Christian" now generally means someone who is lukewarm and mediocre. Among the first Christians the "normal Christian" meant one who lived the  heroism of each day,  and when the occasion presented itself, accepted martyrdom itself: it could and did mean very often the surrender of one's very life in defense of the Faith...  Love was, and is, the moving force in the life of the saints. It is the whole  raison d'etre  of every life dedicated to God. Love makes us unyielding when confronted by setbacks. Lukewarmness gives up at the slightest difficulty (a visit, a conversation, the lack of some material means...) It makes mountains out of molehills. Love for God, on the other hand, makes a molehill out of a mountain; it transforms the soul, gives it new lights and opens up new horizons for it; it makes the soul capable of achieving its highest desires and gives it capacities it had never as much as dreamed of possessing.

      Andrew at Shrine of the Holy Whapping demystifies Mary for a Protestant friend in  urlLink  Mary, Luther, and Paul: Offering the Hail Mary to Protestants . This is a concise, beautifully written letter that encapsulates all the reasons Mary has been honored through the ages. I have never seen it put better or more understandably in such a short and readable piece.  It is therefore impossible to praise Mary without praising Christ more. If we honor Mary as the Mother of God, it praises Christ as God, who choose Mary to be the mother of His flesh. If we honor Mary as the Mother of Mercy, we honor Christ as Mercy Itself, to Whom Mary gave birth. If we honor Mary as Font of Grace, we honor Christ as Grace incarnate. When we honor her as our mother, we affirm that we, by the grace of God, have been made the Body of Christ. In other words, honoring Mary is a powerful way of honoring Christ, and can be nothing more.  And for this reason, honoring Mary is not specific to Catholics or to Catholic beliefs, and should not be. Anyone who can affirm St. Paul, anyone who can recognize the value of God’s work in the soul, anyone who worships God alone, can honor Mary as Christ honored Mary and love Mary as Christ loved Mary. In fact, even Martin Luther, who led a markedly tormented life up to its very end, found an unending source of consolation in Mary. One of his criticisms of the Catholic Church, which he included in a letter he wrote to a German prince long after the Reformation, was that Catholics covered up statues of Mary during Lent, depriving him of a reminder of his “heavenly mother.”

        urlLink BRIDE OF THE RAT GOD  by Barbara Hambly  This is one of those guilty pleasures that is totally legitimate but would make me blush if anyone caught me reading it in public. The title alone is bad enough. Repeating the plot doesn't redeem it much: an ancient cursed necklace worn by a 1923 Hollywood movie star condemns her to death by a demon (the Rat God itself). She must deal with this and much more ... explosions, cryptic omens, people who refuse to die even when their skulls are cracked open, and a mysterious Chinese wizard. This combines the hokiest elements of an old Hollywood movie with the great writing and characterizations that Barbara Hambly is known for. The characters are clever enough to know the story they are living is totally unrealistic but realize that doesn't matter much when being stalked by a giant rat-demon.  This is the kind of light reading that is perfect for the beach or just to forget a hard day at the office, which is why I pick it up time and again. Hambly has written many other great books but they don't hit that "guilty pleasure" meter by virtue of being set in parallel universes. You might not take this out of the house but you will thoroughly forget where you are and enjoy every second spent with Chrysande Flamande eluding the Rat-God.

       RONALD REAGAN, 1911-2004  Ronald Reagan was a great man whose like is not often seen. I will be praying for his soul.  It is very sad that he came to such an end. My beloved grandmother suffered from Alzheimer's disease for many years just as Reagan did. It was a terrible trial for our family. I think of what the last ten years must have been like for his family and how grateful they must be now that he has been released from the prison that his mind became. I remember when I heard my grandmother had died. It was one of the happiest moments I can recall. No more confusion. No more suffering. Just a joyous homecoming. She was free. She was happy. I feel sure that anyone who undergoes such pain on earth skips right over Purgatory straight to the arms of Jesus. I'm sure that is where Ronald Reagan is now.

      (from  urlLink Catholicity )  How many does it take to change a light bulb?  PRESBYTERIANS: None. Lights will go on and off at predestined times.  PENTACOSTALS: Six. One to change it, and five to pray against the spirit of darkness.  UNITARIANS: We choose not to make statement either in favor of or against light-bulb changing. If, on your own journey, you find light bulb changing works for you, fine. You are invited to write a poem or compose a modern dance to express your own light bulb changing reality at our next service, if you decide to come, not that it matters either way.  ZEN BUDDHISTS: Two. One to change the light bulb, and one to not change the light bulb.  AGNOSTICS. Two. One to change the light bulb, and one to doubt whether the power company really exists.  PANTHEISTS. Two. One to change the light bulb, and one to pray to it.  CATHOLICS: None. Candles only.  AMISH: What's a light bulb?

        urlLink HARRY POTTER VS. GANDALF  An in-depth analysis of the literary use of magic in the works of J. K. Rowling, J. R. R. Tolkien, and C. S. Lewis by Steven D. Greydanus  This came up as a topic of conversation the other day as the third Harry Potter movie is set to hit the screens. I was trying to dredge up the reasons that Christians see Harry Potter's magic as dangerous while having no problem with the magic in The Lord of the Rings and wound up going back to this excellent article. I have printed it out to reread as most of it has faded but thought I'd link to it here for anyone else who is interested. I stand by my defense of the Harry Potter books but I actually have read them (unlike many nay-sayers of the books), or at least the first four which is all my children were interested in. They have moved on but I think that the distinctions made in this article are of value to keep in mind.  In fact, I have below outlined seven specific literary characteristics common to Tolkien’s and Lewis’s fiction — above and beyond the fantasy nature of the magic itself — that have the net effect of limiting and restricting the role of magic in their fantasy worlds, essentially acting as barricades or hedges between magic and the reader, in effect saying: "Magic is not for the likes of us." Any reader of these books who might be at risk for developing a dangerous attraction to the idea of magic would find in these literary barricades, these hedges, a strong corrective for that temptation. Furthermore, none of these "hedges" are found in "Buffy" or The Craft — or the Harry Potter books...  At the very least, then, these seven "hedges" disprove the claim of some Harry Potter fans that parents cannot consistently disapprove of the magic in Harry Potter while approving of Tolkien and Lewis. There is no slippery slope here, but a substantial differentiation. One may still choose to accept Harry Potter as well as Tolkien and Lewis — or one may choose to reject them all — but at any rate there’s no arguing that acceptance of Tolkien and Lewis is inconsistent with rejection of Harry Potter

      Last week I read Peggy Noonan's weekly column and had a immediate identification with her comments about daily living in New York City during this time of terrorist alerts. That was not the main thrust of the article but it made me realize that on a subconscious level the threat of a terrorist attack is never far from my mind. I always have "Just in case..." running through my head. When my gas tank gets down to a quarter of a tank I fill up thinking, "Just in case of an attack and a run on the gas pumps." When a prescription runs low I don't wait until there is just one pill left before getting it refilled. Planning for a family vacation out of town I think of what extras we'd need in case transportation got shut down and we couldn't return until a few days later than planned. I've always been a planner and, like  urlLink Noonan , I don't dwell on it but it always underlies everything.  In New York right now we are planning our Memorial Day weekends. We know we are in a difficult historical time, but we do not dwell on it. We don't always even think. We free-associate, like this:  I should get a new dress for the graduation at the Saks sale. They could blow up the Lincoln Tunnel. Meg would love one of those little Chanel knockoffs from the street vender. If New York is bombed while we're in Boston, where will we stay? If Boston is bombed while we're at the graduation, how will we get home? Bring cousin Holly's number in northern Connecticut. Pick up mascara.   From the dire to the banal. No, not from one to another but both interweaved. Having the jits and planning the party. People are dieting because summer's coming and wondering if an al Qaeda hit on New York would trigger a food shortage.

       LUKE 8:4-15   In the familiar parable of the seeds that fall on four types of ground my mental picture always was very literal. The stony ground had lots of little rocks sticking though the soil, weedy ground had scattered tiny plants growing in it, etc. You have to think what an idiot that sower was not to avoid those bad conditions. William Barclay's commentary enlightened me again by pointing out that, knowing sowers and soil as they did, Jesus' listeners understood the key element to His parable quite well. All the types of soil probably looked very similar ... so we don't know what type of soil the seeds are falling on until the test of time makes it clear.  It is in fact quite likely that he (Jesus) was looking at some sower sowing his seed as he spoke. The parable speaks of four kinds of ground.  (i) The common ground in Palestine was split into long narrow strips; between the strips there were paths which were rights of way; when the seed fell on these paths, which were beaten as hard as the road, it had no chance of getting in.  (ii)There was the rocky ground. This does not mean ground that was full of stones but ground which was only a think skin of earth over a shelf of limestone rock. In such ground there was no moisture or nourishment, and the growing plant was bound to wither and die.  (iii)The ground which was full of thorns was ground which at the moment looked clean enough It is possible to make any bit of ground  look  clean simply by turning it over. But the seeds of the weeds and the fibrous roots of the wild grasses had been left in it. The good seed and the weeds grew together, but the weeds grew more strongly; and so the life was choked out of the good seed.  (iv) The good ground was ground that was deep and clean and well prepared.  Barclay also suggests a reason for Jesus telling this parable that goes beyond the common interpretation that I have heard before. I like it and think that, as in many other situtations, it is perfectly likely Jesus would use this teaching opportunity for a dual purpose.  It is suggested that the parable is really a counsel against despair. Think of the situation. Jesus has been banished from the synagogues. The scribes and the Pharisees and the religious leaders are up against him. Inevitably the disciples would be disheartened. It is to them Jesus speaks this parable...

       urlLink  VALOMILK   This will make you very happy, whether you are Catholic or not! After reading  CandyFreak  I have been eyeing the candy racks by the Central Market check out stands. I realized that they carry a lot of the old fashioned candy praised in the book. Yesterday I picked up a Valomilk. Think of a peanut butter cup but with a "flowing" marshmallow center ... and about a thousand times better. The chocolate is thick and excellent quality. I don't like marshmallow but this didn't seem like marshmallow at all. It was delicious. Rose and I shared the package and then wished for more. If you happen across one of these grab it and prepare for a little taste of heaven.

       LUKE 8:1-3   One of the things that always delights me about reading the Bible is how much is said in very few words if you know the "code." That is why William Barclay's commentaries hold such charm. Oftentimes something that I would skip over as a "throw away line" hold a wealth of meaning. In this case, describing the women who accompanied Jesus on his travels reemphasizes what we learned through watching him choose disciples. They are a varied and diverse group from all walks of life who normally would never be associated with each other.  There was Mary Magdalene, that is Mary from the town of Magdala, out of whom he had cast seven devils. Clearly she had a past that was a dark and terrible thing. There was Joanna. She was the wife of Chuza, Herod's  epitropos.  A king had many perquisites and much private property; his  epitropos  was the official who looked after the king's financial interests. In the Roman Empire, even in provinces which were governed by proconsuls appointed by the senate, the Emperor still had his  epitropos  to safeguard his interests. There could be no more trusted and important official. It is an amazing thing to find Mary Magdalene, with the dark past, and Joanna, the lady of the court, in one company.  It is one of the supreme achievements of Jesus that he can enable the most diverse people to live together without in the least losing their own personalities or qualities.

      One of the things I come up against in conversations about Church teachings is the refusal of a many people to admit that sin exists or has any application to modern life. If they don't believe in sin, it follows that they absolutely refuse to accept the concept that sin has consequences in their lives regardless of their belief.  It isn't a matter of condemnation although a lot of people think that is what I am doing. It is a matter of seeing reality clearly so one can make the proper choices. Whether or not someone believes in the law of gravity, they will still plummet to the bottom of the cliff if they step off. I certainly was gratified to see the Holy Father talking about having to deal personally with that very same problem.  This passage in  Crossing the Threshold of Hope  by Pope John Paul II perfectly summarizes the whole conflict of modern thought with the reality of sin. It emphasizes what is seen repeatedly in Jesus' and, consequently, the Church's teachings. We must accept the reality of sin. However, the reason for that acceptance is not for condemnation but so that we can fully accept God's redemptive love. The italics are the Pope's emphasis.  This is another point that is absolutely unacceptable to post-Enlightenment thought.  It refuses to accept the reality of sin and, in particular, it refuses to accept original sin.   When during my last visit to Poland, I chose the Decalogue and the commandment of love as a theme for the homilies, all the Polish followers of the "enlightened agenda" were upset. For such people, the Pope becomes  persona non grata  when he tries to convince the world of human sin...What else can the Church do? Nevertheless, convincing the world of the existence of sin is not the same as condemning it for sinning. "God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him."  Convincing the world of sin means creating the conditions for its salvation.  Awareness of our own sinfulness, including that which is inherited, is the first condition for salvation; the next is the confession of this sin before God, who desires only to receive this confession so that He can save man.  To save means to embrace and life up with redemptive love,  with love that is  always greater  than any sin.

      Rod Dreher's  Dallas Morning News  editorial yesterday,  urlLink Q. What's wrong with this picture? , highlighted the fact that good news from Iraq isn't worth covering to most media organizations. Thus we are left with the general idea that nothing good is happening at all which is totally untrue.  Following up over at  urlLink The Corner on National Review Online , Dreher reported that among the many responses to his editorial was a correspondent who sent  urlLink Gallup Poll results  released yesterday. They show that, despite the recent scandals, the military is still the top rated institution with a 75% confidence rating. How did the media fare? Not nearly so well with a 30% rating which is down 5% from the year before. Television news is   at its lowest rate since 1993.     Confidence in television news, at 30%, is down five points compared with last year, and is the lowest recorded in Gallup's trends for this item dating back to 1993. The previous low for television news was 33% in April 1995. Newspapers also dropped slightly over the past year -- from 33% to 30% -- almost tying the all-time low for this institution, 29%, previously recorded in March 1994.   Its nice to see that we're not as stupid as the media seems to think we are. The next question is, "Will the media do anything about their falling numbers?" They may give it a shot but probably not because they don't understand the average American which is their problem in the first place. If they worried about simply reporting the news rather than influencing it they would be better off ... and so would we.

       LUKE 7:36-50   Wiliam Barclay describes the basic courtesies extended to guests in Jesus' day in commentary on this familiar reading. Simon the Pharisee invites Jesus to eat with him but doesn't extend the basic courtesies that normally would be offered to a guest. As always this additional information about daily life lends insight and richness to the Scripture message.  The scene is the courtyard of the house of Simon the Pharisee. The houses of well-to-do people were built round an open courtyard in the form of a hollow square. Often in the courtyard there would be a garden and a fountain; and there in the warm weather meals were eaten. It was the custom that when a Rabbi was at a meal in such a house, all kinds of people came in - they were quite free to do so - to listen to the pearls of wisdom which fell from his lips. That explains the presence of the woman.  When a guest entered such a house three things were always done. The host placed his hand on the guest's shoulder and gave him the kiss of peace. That was a mark of respect which was never omitted in the case of a distinguished Rabbi. The roads were only dust tracks, and shoes were merely soles held in place by straps across the foot. So always cool water was poured over the guest's feet to cleanse and comfort them. Either a pinch of sweet-smelling incense was burned or a drop of attar of roses was placed on the guest's head. These things good manners demanded, and in this case not one of them was done.  In the east the guests did not sit, but reclined, at table. They lay on low couches, resting on the left elbow, leaving the right arm free, with the feet stretched out behind; and during the meal the sandals were taken off. That explains how the woman was standing at Jesus' feet.  A woman at the feast washes Jesus' feet with her tears, dries them with her hair and annoints them with perfume. Barclay also elaborates on the significance of the woman's actions in regard to common behavior.  The woman was a bad woman, and a notoriously bad woman, a prostitute. No doubt she had listened to Jesus speak from the edge of the crowd and had glimpsed in him the hand with which could lift her from the mire of her ways. Round her neck she wore, like all Jewish women, a little phial of concentrated perfume; they were called alabasters; and they were very costly. She wished to pour it on his feet, for it was all she had to offer. But as she saw him the tears came and fell upon his feet. For a Jewish woman to appear with hair unbound was an act of the gravest immodesty. On her wedding day a girl bound up her hair and never would she appear with it unbound again. The fact that this woman loosed her long hair in public showed how she had forgotten everyone except Jesus.  Scriptures, and the Gospels in particular, delight in emphasizing important points by using obvious contrasts. Knowing these customs makes it abundantly clear that we are being shown the desirability of losing ourselves in Jesus versus caring about ourselves so much we barely acknowledge his presence.

       urlLink LONE STAR NATION  How a Ragged Army of Volunteers Won the Battle for Texas Independence - and Changed America by H.W. Brands  After seeing  urlLink The Alamo  I was curious about its historical accuracy. It says a lot about just how curious I was that I actually checked out  Lone Star Nation  from the library and read all 527 pages. I  never  read this sort of historical book, preferring instead to rely on Tom for interesting historical tidbits from whatever book he is reading. However, I found this book riveting.  Brands' treatment of all involved in the conflict is very even handed. As with all good histories, there is no side or person that is entirely good or bad as all are flawed in some way. The story is told not only through the larger than life figures of Austin, Houston, Crockett, Bowie, Santa Anna, Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams but also by a host of lesser figures on both sides whose stories also were intertwined with the battle for independence. I really enjoyed seeing the appearance of small characters whose names now loom large in Texas history ... Lamar, Seguin, and Fannin being just a few.  I had no idea that Stephen Austin's fight to establish and defend his colony came as the result of a deathbed request by his father, the original conceiver of a colony in Texas. Also I had no idea that Sam Houston's long retreat before Santa Anna was an overall strategy of getting close to existing U.S. borders where President Andrew Jackson had the U.S. Army standing by to come to their rescue by claiming that Santa Anna was trying to invade the country. Needless to say, this book sheds light on the motivation for all sorts of events during this time in Texas history such as why Santa Anna sacrificed 600 soldiers in the final attack on the Alamo, Fannin's fatal flaw that caused the capture of the Goliad defenders, and much more.  What about the question that started me on this quest? Was  The Alamo  historically accurate? I found it surprisingly so although some of the character motivations were tweaked ... which was no surprise at all.

       urlLink THE MUMMY   Now I know why "Van Helsing" didn't have any mummies in it. The director used them all up making the infinitely superior movie  The Mummy  a few years ago. It was recommended by such diverse people as the antidote to "Van Helsing" that we took a flyer on it for our Friday Family Movie Night.  The Mummy  is everything that a summer movie is supposed to be ... great special effects, good looking stars (Brendan Fraser for me, the chief of the Pharaoh's bodyguards for Rose), semi-rational plot, quips, funny side kicks, and disgusting creatures ... in this case flesh-eating scarab beetles. I know that most of America already saw this movie but maybe its time to check it out again or if you inexplicably missed, it as we did, give it a whirl.

      The church is always God hung between two thieves. Thus, no one should be surprised or shocked at how badly the church has betrayed the gospel and how much it continues to do so today. It has never done very well. Conversely, however, nobody should deny the good the church has done either. It has carried grace, produced saints, morally challenged the planet, and made, however imperfectly, a house for God to dwell in on this earth.  To be connected with the church is to be associated with scoundrels, warmongers, fakes, child-molesters, murderers, adulterers and hypocrites of every description. It also, at the same time, identifies you with saints and the finest persons of heroic soul within every time, country, race and gender. To be a member of the church is to carry the mantle of both the worst sin and the finest heroism of the soul ... because the church always looks exactly as it looked at the original crucifixion, God hung among thieves.

      The book and the movie have three things in common: robots, the three laws of robotics, and their quality ... not great but pretty good. (I speak as a long-time Asimov reader. I am not talking about the two "robot" mysteries he wrote ... just the "I, Robot" book of short stories.) It was a typical big-budget, action movie with the plot twist at the end, albeit with robots instead of monsters or men as enemies. Will Smith and his female costar (name?) were both effective. Sonny was a viable third character and not a bad action hero either, all things considered. The girls and I really enjoyed Will's love for his pie-baking GG and the way he saved that cat when the house was being demolished all around him. Hey, what do you want me to say ... we're a bunch of girlie-girls here!

      Mary at  urlLink Ever New  has the best shirt designs I've seen in response to Planned Parenthood's dreadful "I had an abortion" shirt. Mary's are positive rather than angry. She also makes the excellent point that, although abortion rights are presented as the result of a struggle between women and society, the whole issue is about something much more personal.  Isn't the struggle really between woman and child and not between women and society? The conception of a baby (or another baby) brings with it a load of unavoidable demands - unless the woman takes back her (apparent) control, that is. A baby changes the life of a women forever.  ... having a baby is a scary thing and perhaps the the thing that sits at the heart of the issue. Freedom, independence, plans, stomach, breasts, relationships...just about everything...changes for a pregnant woman and the changes do not go away.

      Padre Pio is one of my favorite saints and I see that I'm in good company.  urlLink John Allen  reports that Italian devotion to Padre Pio is reflected by three Italian hostages who were freed by U.S. Special Forces in Iraq on June 8.  On June 23, all three men, accompanied by their families, made a pilgrimage to San Giovanni Rotondo, the chief national shrine to Padre Pio, in order to give thanks to the Capuchin saint ... The three told reporters they had prayed to Padre Pio during their captivity and promised to make this pilgrimage if they survived.  "I'm very devoted to Padre Pio and I prayed often during our imprisonment," Cupertino said. "They too," pointing to Agliana and Stefio, "were united with me in prayer because they know Padre Pio."  In another twist, Cupertino's 10-year-old cousin Carmelina, after going with her parents to San Giovanni Rotondo on May 31, apparently returned home and wrote "freed" on a calendar hanging above the family telephone on the date of June 8 - exactly the day the Italians were liberated. She says the date came to her in a dream.

      We bought Rose's new uniforms a couple of days ago. The girls went to the dentist today (five cavities for Rose? eeek!). Schoolbooks have been arriving for days from used book sellers around the country. Rose's friends are asking Hannah nervous questions about starting high school. Complaining has begun about the terrible choices for required summer reading (Of Mice and Men, My Antonia ... ick!). The girls are getting glummer every day. This year our summer ends August 16 when the dioscean schools start.  This has been a great summer. Not only have we had wonderful travels but there are those lazy evenings of card games (although you can't call our card games lazy ... they're frenetic) or walking the dogs or watching a movie a week or having Alias watching parties when so much talking is going on that there is no way anyone could hear the TV. Certainly I'm going to miss having the dishes washed by someone else every evening. That's my summer treat because usually there is too much homework to force "my slaves" to do such things.  Two more summer weeks to treasure ... that almost makes me look forward to seeing "I Robot" today!

      Sheryl Patterson has earned my admiration for sending a very honest and personal response to a pro-abortion editorial in the  Dallas Morning News . It must have taken sheer courage and determination to write this but she puts it all out there for us to see.    urlLink  The worst decision I ever made    Re: "Reasons for Abortion – Don't think yours is better than others'," by Barbara Ehrenreich, Saturday Viewpoints.  When I read Ms. Ehrenreich's column on the responsibility women have to speak up about the abortions they have had, I concurred 100 percent. For far too long I have been silent, and I wish to have my name added to the growing throng of women electing to terminate their pregnancies. I can state unequivocally that having an abortion was the worst decision I have ever made and I would do anything (short of taking another life) to undo it.  I did not have an abortion because my health was endangered, or because I was raped or because I was devastated to learn my child would have brown eyes instead of blue. I had an abortion because I was "not ready to be a parent." Funny that I don't think the fetus was ready to be aborted either. Perhaps the silent 70 percent of women, whom Ms. Ehrenreich laments, are those who have had abortions and regretted it.  As for rescinding my reproductive rights? Rescind away, baby.

       urlLink DEAR CATASTROPHE WAITRESS  by Belle & Sebastian This showed up yesterday from Amazon. Hey, the kids were ordering their schoolbooks and with an order of $700+ I figured I should get  something  out of the deal. I can see why it shows up as a recommendation whenever I look up Badly Drawn Boy. So far this sounds like a combination of Badly Drawn Boy and The Beatles White Album (a la Bungalow Bill). I'll keep listening because I remember I didn't like Smash Mouth for a while either but my first impression is that it all sounds kind of the same ...   urlLink ALL THE POPE'S MEN: The Inside Story of How the Vatican Really Thinks  by John L. Allen Jr. I just got this from the library yesterday so I'm only on page 90 but I wanted to give folks a heads-up on this great book. Allen explains that the Vatican's psychology and culture are difficult for people, even most Catholics, to grasp, resulting in miscommunication and animosity toward the church. So far, he's very even handed and it is fascinating. I especially enjoyed his debunking of the top 5 myths of the Vatican.

       urlLink Catholic Analysis  raises an interesting point. Kerry's much vaunted military service doesn't necessarily show strength of character. It never occurred to me to look at it from that angle.   We commonly consider courageous military service honorable because it confirms an unselfish character that is self-sacrificial. But if there is evidence that the character behind the courageous service is focused on vainglory, then the service does not merit our unchecked admiration. In fact, such service may instead raise troubling questions about character and future leadership.  And, in Kerry's case, the evidence indicates that the intention behind his military exploits was focused on vainglory with an eye to a future political career. News reports confirm that, in Vietnam, Kerry would  reenact  on video his military exploits for future use.

      Today is the feast day of St. Martha, the sister of Lazarus and Mary, and my patron. I picked her because she's the patron saint of homemakers and also because I identified with that "foot in mouth" tendency (Jesus, why don't you make Mary help me? Oh.). As time has gone by I have come to discover that these went hand in hand with her great faith and true friendship with Jesus. She's been a great help and guide for me. I only hope that with her guidance I can mirror her faith, friendship, and love for Our Lord.

      LUKE 14:15-24 Jesus tells the parable about the man who invited a lot of people to a banquet only to find that they all had lame excuses for not attending when his servants showed up to fetch them. The man then told the servants to go out and invite every downtrodden person they found. Obviously this is a parable about the nation of Israel declining God's invitation to Heaven. Therefore, God opens everything up to sinners, outcasts, and gentiles.  Why Jesus tells this parable is not obvious until we have a greater understanding of mindset of the Jews in Jesus' time. The parable is prompted by a statement made by another guest.  One of his fellow guests on hearing this said to him, "Blessed is the one who will dine in the kingdom of God."  William Barclay tells why this comment made Jesus start talking about the kingdom of Heaven.  The Jews had a series of ever-recurring conventional pictures of what would happen when God broke into history and when the golden days of the new age arrived. One of these was the picture of the Messianic banquet. On that day God would give a great feast to his own people ... It is of this banquet that the man who spoke to Jesus was thinking. When he spoke of the happiness of those who would be guests at that banquet he was thinking of Jews, and of Jews only, for the average, orthodox Jew would never have dreamed that gentiles and sinners would find a place at the feast of God. That is why Jesus spoke this parable.

        The people who hate science   To date there have been zero-- that's 0-- successful medical experiments using embryonic stem cells. There have been quite a few successful experiments using stem cells obtained from adult bone marrow.  With that in mind, turn your attention to the American political scene, where two sides are engaged in a heated, emotional debate. One side says that we must continue and subsidize research on embryonic stem cells; the other says that we should concentrate on what works: the bone-marrow option.  Which side, in your view, is trying to ignore the scientific evidence?   Phil Lawler at Catholic World News'  urlLink Off The Record

      I read an interview in which the director of The Last Samurai was bemoaning the movie's "R" rating. He said that if there was any consistency the Lord of the Rings movies would have an "R" rating also instead of "PG-13." No kidding. There was just as much graphic slicing and dicing in one as in the others.  Just like anyone with kids, I have known about the inconsistency of "PG-13" ratings for a long time. Its really hard to tell without a lot of research if a "PG-13" is for a little bad language or if it is for sexuality that actually deserves an "R". Having seen The Last Samurai ("R") and King Arthur ("PG-13") within a few days of each other really drove this point home. I don't really care if The Last Samurai was "R" but then so should have been King Arthur and all three of the Lord of the Rings movies.  I don't know why this is so hard for whoever does the ratings. However, until they get it cleared up I'll go on using my double-checking for amounts of sex and violence in  urlLink Decent Films  and  urlLink ScreenIt . They aren't fool-proof but its certainly better than depending on Hollywood.

       urlLink THE AMAZING RACE  - WEEK FOUR There wasn't much of note in "The Amazing Race" last week except that Mirna got increasingly unpleasant and pretty much earned the "drive-by expletive" that got shouted at her. This week Mirna continued to show the mean streak that surfaced last week and we actually were rooting for them to be eliminated. How the race reveals character as time goes by, eh?  The real character revealing moment was when teams were faced with  two pounds  of caviar that had to be eaten by one of them before they could go on to the next step. Chip earned everyone's admiration by shoveling it in and leaving. When Christie cratered, gagging, and couldn't take another bite, Colin was nice at first but then frustration made him really impatient and mean. On the other hand, Brandon was consistently nice and caring when Nicole was lying on the floor because it made her so sick ... even though other teams were catching up and passing them. The same faith that made him pass up the vodka challenge really showed as he took care of Nicole without a trace of impatience.  This group seems to have a preponderance of good people in the teams ... Chip and Kim, the bowling moms, Brandon and Nicole. There still are folks with plenty to dislike. My first choice for elimination ... Mirna. Too bad about Charla but she's not stopping Mirna whenever she chooses the worst way to act.

       urlLink Catholic Analysis  brings an inspirational story of what the Salesians are doing in Africa. Be sure to read the whole thing. This is the kind of missionary work that I read about in Acts, with miracles and conversions abounding. We need to remember that we are called to be fearless in the same way in our works and in our expectations.  This Indian Salesian, like many Third World Christians, believes that God's miracles are not just for the pages of the Bible. In contrast to our Western skepticism based on decades of being immersed in a science-worshipping society, these Christians still have the biblical faith in divine intervention. Having that biblical faith is alone enough to make this priest noteworthy to a Westerner.

       urlLink Things of Infinite Importance  has reprinted a Boston Globe editorial by Bono, of all people. Written from a very positive note, Bono points out all the implications a U.S. presidential election holds from a world perspective ... and all the good that we can do. Usually I'd just roll my eyes and move on but he's self aware, articulate, and brings a new perspective to the jaded political convention coverage. An interesting read.  I know this doesn't look good -- I'm a rich Irish rock star, not even a rich American rock star. It makes people wince, including myself. But there's a real opportunity for America to lead an adventure, and the adventure is this: We are the first generation that really can do something about the kind of "stupid" poverty that sees children dying of hunger in a world of plenty or mothers dying for lack of a 20-cent drug that we take for granted. We have the science, we have the resources, what we don't seem to have is the will.

       urlLink KING ARTHUR  It wasn't a  bad  movie but it wasn't one of the greats either. Realizing that no one really knows the legend of King Arthur, the movie makers lifted a few names, put their story in England and named it "King Arthur." The "R" rating saved me from having to take Rose to see "Troy" and if there was any consistency in the rating system, this would have been "R" too, if only for Arthur and Guinivere's little triste. I thought the one redeeming thing it had was some pretty good looking guys ... until I watched Tom Cruise in the Last Samurai and realized I was settling for way too little in that department. Clive Owen, eat your heart out.  These excerpts from  urlLink King Arthur in 15 Minutes  (registration with livejournal.com required) take care of my review (which says a lot right there).  Historical? No.  VERY SERIOUS TEXT: Recent historical evidence suggests that Arthur was actually some Roman guy named Arturius. This, therefore, is a completely historically accurate movie, because God knows you can count on a Bruckheimer flick for your history lessons.  Predictable? Yes.  LANCELOT: Whatever. Clearly I'm going to die in battle, and I'm really hoping it's not going to be this one, but when I die, don't bury me on this stinking island. Burn me and cast my ashes to the wind.  ARTHUR: Awww, dude! Look what you went and did!  LANCELOT: What?  ARTHUR: Now you're totally going to have to die, so we can dispose of your body in that precise manner. It's like, a rule.  "PG-13?" No way. Try "R".  GUINEVEIRA: *pulls up her skirt and pushes Arthur's hand under*  ARTHUR: Baby, I'm Clive Owen. I think I know where it is.  MOTHERS IN THE AUDIENCE: OMG this movie is so not PG-13!  DAUGHTERS IN THE AUDIENCE: SHUT UP, THIS IS THE GOOD PART.  SOMEONE IN THE MUSIC DEPARTMENT: *actually digs up a Celtic porno sax*  Thanks to  urlLink Cleolinda Jones , genius writer of the 15 Minute Movies, for making this review so easy. 'Nuff said.

      Because Al-Qaeda is violent ... slaughtering innocents ... wants to force Islam down our throats? Puhleez. No, some Muslim leaders are upset because Al-Qaeda woke up the West to the ongoing peaceful takeover of our culture by Islam.  urlLink Get Religion  has a very enlightening story about the Islamic mindset.   I bring this up because Browne goes on to make some other rather blunt statements about modern Islam, and Saudi Arabia in particular. One of his most interesting points is that some outspoken Muslim leaders are quite mad at al Qaeda's terrorism tactics for a unique and disturbing reason -- they believe that terrorism may awaken the West to the threat of Islamic takeover by other, more peaceful means.  In other words, if evangelism, high birthrates and immigration are doing the job, why bomb cities? Why not be patient and allow the West to collapse into a spiritual void that will cry out for rescue? Besides, there is evidence that Americans will surrender certain cultural institutions -- such as the military -- quite willingly...  It's crucial for journalists to realize that these concepts are central to Islam in its normative, orthodox forms, especially in settings such as Saudi Arabia and in the waves of mosques being built in the West with oil money. This is simple logic and there is a word for modernized Muslims who do not hold these beliefs -- "infidels."

      Dan at  urlLink Working It Out  does a good quick summary of the culture of death and satan's ultimate end game. Considering the "me, me, me" attitude that leads to this culture, its no surprise that it is the exact opposite of sacrificial love. The ultimate example of that all-powerful, all-encompassing love is Jesus who fasted and prayed ... and told us to imitate Him. Most thought provoking of all is the answer to all this.  Our culture may have passed the point of no return. Is there no hope? There is always hope. But those of faith will need to repent, fast, and pray like never before. We live in perilous and exciting times. Are we up for the challenge?  There's a question that makes me stop and think. I despise the culture of death and pray for its victims. But is that enough? Am I up to the challenge of showing self sacrifice for them?  I have opportunities every day to hop out of bed when the alarm rings, pass up that snack between meals, cheerfully let someone barge in front of me ... to offer up obedience and sacrifice in so many ways during the day. Do I take them? Sometimes yes, sometimes I just don't feel like it. That's not good enough. These are not big things but it is in the little things of every day that we learn how to die to self.  It is in times like these that God sends us great saints. Where will they come from if we do not let Him use us as He will?

      A CHEERFUL HEART IS GOOD MEDICINE A new pastor was visiting in the homes of his parishioners. At one house it seemed obvious that someone was at home, but no answer came to his repeated knocks at the door. Therefore, he took out a card and wrote "Revelation 3:20 on the back of it and stuck it in the door.  When the offering was processed the following Sunday, he found that his card had been returned. Added to it was this cryptic message,  "Genesis 3:10." Reaching for his Bible to check out the citation, he broke up in gales of laughter.  Revelation 3:20 begins "Behold, I stand at the door and knock." Genesis 3:10 reads, "I heard your voice in the garden and I was afraid for I was naked."

      Following up on  urlLink Annie Jacobson's  story, the  urlLink Washington Post  unearthed many similar stories of terrorists probing security and making dry runs to test attacks. That's scary enough but what is just as disturbing is that there is no "central clearinghouse" to notify flight crews of suspicious incidents or resolutions.  A second pilot said that, on one of his recent flights, an air marshal forced his way into the lavatory at the front of his plane after a man of Middle Eastern descent locked himself in for a long period.  The marshal found the mirror had been removed and the man was attempting to break through the wall. The cockpit was on the other side.  The second pilot said terrorists are "absolutely" testing security ...  "It's a probe. They are probing us," said a second air marshal, who confirmed that Middle Eastern men try to flush out marshals by rushing the cockpit and stopping suddenly.  Face it, we're at war. We'd better get this figured out and soon. Via  urlLink Bettnet .

      There is something so special about the bond between a father and daughter. Not only is it important on a personal level but how will tomorrow's women know what a good man is unless they spend time with one? Like any hard-working father, Tom has to make a significant effort to squeeze in the time so that he really knows the girls. For some time now, he has been driving Hannah to school every morning just to get some of that one-on-one time. When he runs errands on the weekends, he makes sure Rose is invited as she just loves riding in the car and that becomes "their" time.  Tom and Hannah are in San Francisco right now for a special father-daughter celebration of her 16th birthday. We had a lot of AAdvantage miles so she got to pick anywhere in the continental U.S. Wise girl, she chose San Francisco.  They have been scouring the DK Eyewitness book for the perfect activities ... our St. Francine (aka Hannah) is hoping to see sea lions on Fisherman's Wharf, as a long time lover of all things Asian she wants to scour Chinatown's alleys for the really authentic shops, Tom has planned a drive to Bodega Bay and along High 1, reservations have been made to tour Alcatraz.  It touches my heart to think of the special memories they are making, memories that I hope last a lifetime ... which is the  real  perfect activity of this trip.

       urlLink Catholic Analysis  reports on a fascinating new brochure by the Catholic Medical Association entitled  urlLink Homosexuality and Hope . It asserts that homosexuality is NOT genetically based, despite society's best efforts to convince us of that fact. Usually environmental factors contribute to traits that society has labeled as homosexual. In today's environment that person then is virtually railroaded into same-sex attraction when what actually may be needed is therapy to help with the base problems. It is important to note that this brochure is a regular medical report based on case studies that are referenced, not a mere ideological statement. Once more, what "everyone knows" turns out not to be true at all.  Early identification (Hadden 1967[53]) and proper professional intervention, if supported by parents, can often overcome the gender identity disorder. (Rekers 1974[54]; Newman 1976) Unfortunately, many parents who report these concerns to their pediatricians are told not to worry about them. In some cases the symptoms and parental concerns may appear to lessen when the child enters the second or third grade, but unless adequately dealt with, the symptoms may reappear at puberty as intense, same-sex attraction. This attraction appears to be the result of a failure to identify positively with one's own sex.  It is important that those involved in child care and education become aware of the signs of gender identity disorder and chronic juvenile unmasculinity and have access the resources available to find appropriate help for these children. (Bradley 1998; Brown 1963[55]; Acosta 1975[56]) Once convinced that same-sex attraction is not a genetically determined disorder, one is able to hope for prevention and a therapeutic model to greatly mitigate, if not eliminate, same-sex attractions.

      This was Magnificat's meditation of the day for yesterday. I really loved the way this was phrased ... that we render thanks to God by using His blessings to bear fruit.  Our souls are like earth sown with good seed, maintained with diligent care. Now we must produce; the seed must become a plant and bear fruit. Very often we ask the Lord for his blessing; we must also render thanks; and we will do this by using his blessings and making them bear fruit. We must perform good works, and the slightest act of self-renunciation, of mastery of our instincts and reform of our bad habits, will give great glory to God.  Now we are going to prove that we have understood Christian life. We always want to receive; let us also think of what God has the right to demand of his chosen vine that he has cherished with so much love. We have so much to give thanks for; and so little time in which to do so. It is most urgent that our lives produce something, and that we finally prove ourselves to be Christians. An ancient described the Christians as "Christ in bloom." Do we truly show Christ visibly, or are our branches dead or poisonous thorns?  Let's resolve to take action. Even if our activities be modest, that doesn't matter. But let our decision to make the divine graces visible be more energetic and more loving -- let our lives not be spent merely in tempest.   Mother Marie des Douleurs

      Kelly Clark, The Lady in the Pew, shows her usual good sense when considering the Communion controversy in  urlLink PLAYING "THE FLOAT GAME" (or, "Sinner, Sink Thyself!") . I never would have thought of comparing floating a check to taking Communion when in a state of grave sin but it is a perfect way of looking at the basics.  It seems to me that relying on the prayer we recite just prior to receiving Holy Communion can be construed as a way of "playing the float" with the Lord.  Like the check floating game, it's wrong. It's just plain wrong to presume that it takes the place of repentance, reconciliation, and penance.  And also like the check floating game, it's risky as hell, if you don't mind my saying so. If not arrogant in the extreme. Even if the prayer took the place of proper Reconciliation (which is most emphatically does not), what the bleep happens if one dies beforehand? Duh!  Finally, given the Lord's Infinite Mercy, it seems to me to be in the poorest taste imaginable to rely on it only before receiving Him in the Eucharist!  "Yes, Lord, I want to receive You right now. I mean, I'm here, after all. So, what the heck: I'm sorry. You know, for, well, whatever. See ya next week."

      Tom was in Houston this weekend so the girls and I took the opportunity to have our own Numb-Butt-A-Thon (a la  urlLink Ain't It Cool ). Hey, its Texas in late July ... we're gonna stay inside anyway. Surprisingly, everything we chose to try was old. I'm assuming most everyone knows the premise for all these; if not, check the link for a basic description.   urlLink GODSPELL  Watching "groovy Jesus" in The Gospel of John, made me think of "Godspell", the original groovy Jesus movie. I saw part of this musical based on the Gospel of Matthew when I was in high school on late night TV and figured it probably didn't age well with the "flower children" disciples and music dating it beyond belief. Then the girls discovered that Jesus was portrayed by Victor Garber, the much admired "coolest old guy on TV" as Jack Bristow in Alias. Now we  had  to see it. I figured that it only would take half an hour before they gave up were laughing hysterically and quit watching. Not so. We watched it twice because we all liked it so much.  It is dated, but when you get past that to the basic show, "Godspell" is a wonderful entertainment. First, and most often mentioned by everyone, is the amazing location photography. You have to see it to appreciate it. Next is the music which is really good, a little 70's musical style but that's no big deal. Best of all was the joyfulness and exuberance which gets lost in way too many religious movies. Young Victor Garber showed that he was a great actor even 30 years ago. The second viewing made it easier to get "Jack Bristow" out of our heads, although Rose delighted in pointing out the same sensitive expressions she's seen on Alias ("Sydney, I'm sorry about involving you in Project Christmas. I was trying to protect you..."). This was the surprise movie favorite of the weekend.   urlLink EDWARD SCISSORHANDS  I like Tim Burton's movies but never was interested in seeing this one. I really had a hard time watching it because I was filled with such pity for Edward the entire time. Not only was he stuck with those scissorhands but it was all too clear where the story was going. The story was really one dimensional with a sad ending that did nothing to redeem it ... and no one really learned much. Oh, Edward and Kim both learned what it is to love and lose but it was handled so superficially that there seemed to be no point to it. Rose liked it better than I did but agreed it seemed unredeemably sad.  It was interesting to watch as an early Tim Burton movie, though. I could see elements that he used in Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Big Fish. Any of those movies were better and more complete than this one, though. Johnny Depp was excellent, as were the rest of the cast, but that wasn't any surprise. Certainly it was not worth the agony that it was for me to sit through this movie.   urlLink LA FEMME NIKITA  I always heard this was a great series but we don't have cable (yes, our house is in the Stone Ages). We rented the first two DVD's from the first season and set out to see if Nikita can hold a candle to Alias' Sydney Bristow. Pffft! Of course not!  However, "La Femme Nikita" does have a charm of its own. It is much more of a "typical" TV show with each plot ending within each show however it shows a little more reality than Alias. I liked the fact that Nikita had a run in her stocking halfway through her first shootout ... that her hand shook so much on her first few times to try to kill someone ... that her across the hall neighbor is astute enough to notice that Nikita has to take off each time she answers the phone.  Also, the level of angst is handled a little more quietly, with Nikita having wet eyes rather than being as dramatic as Sydney over her problems. I was relieved to see that, although it was created for cable, there wasn't an extreme level or sex or violence. In fact, it was tamer than many regular network thrillers. We also kept reminding each other that this series is from 1997 and probably  influenced Alias creator J.J. Abrams. We liked it enough to watch 6 in a row (numb butts for sure!) and definitely will keep renting and watching Nikita's adventures.   urlLink THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN  Actually, we watched "The Magnificent Seven" a couple of weeks ago so we rented "The Seven Samurai" to see how close the two movies were to each other. Unfortunately, the DVD was so scratched that we didn't get very far into it before it would freeze up. So we will watch it another weekend when Tom can see it with us. However, just a word about "The Magnificent Seven". I had forgotten what a really great, classic movie this is. Westerns just don't get much better than this. How can you not love watching something that has the Magnificent Four in it? Of course, I'm talking about Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn. Oh, right, there were other magnificent  actors  but that's not the kind of magnificence I'm talking about ...

       urlLink Jordan's lists  have inspired me, although I'm going to go the more spontaneous route. I'll give daily thanks for something in the sidebar. This is with the understanding of the underlying thankfulness that I never can express enough ... that God kept pushing and pushing and pushing until I realized that He was there and that He was calling me to the Catholic Church. That defines everything that I am and all that I try to accomplish. Hallelujah!

      LUKE 13:31-35 In this section of Luke, Jesus is warned by some Pharisees of Herod's plan to kill him. Until going through Luke bit by bit I never noticed this part. It is surprising to see that not all the Pharisees hated Jesus. Except for Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea we always get a very one dimensional picture of the Pharisees. There were both good and bad among the Pharisees in Jesus' time ... and the people knew it well. William Barclay tells us more.  The Jews themselves knew very well that there were good and bad Pharisees. They divided them into seven different classes.   The Shoulder Pharisees . These wore their good deeds on their shoulder and performed them to be seen of men.   The Wait-a-little Pharisees . They could always find a good excuse for putting off a good deed until tomorrow.   The Bruised or Bleeding Pharisees . No Jewish rabbi could be seen talking to any woman on the street, not even his wife or mother or sister. But certain of the Pharisees went further. They would not even look at a woman on the street; they even shut their eyes to avoid seeing a woman; they, therefore, knocked into walls and houses and bruised themselves; and then exhibited their bruises as special badges of extraordinary piety.   The Pestle-and-Mortar or Hump-backed Pharisees . They were ever reckoning up their good deeds and, as it were, striking a balance-sheet of profit and loss with God.   The Timid or Fearing Pharisees . They went ever in fear of the wrath of God. They were ... not helped but haunted by their religion.   The God-loving Pharisees . They were copies of Abraham and lived in faith and charity.  There may have been six bad Pharisees for every good one; but this passage shows that even amongst the Pharisees there were those who admired and respected Jesus.  Once again I am reminded that people are much the same no matter what day and age they live in. There always are the nitpickers, the hypocrites, the judgmental, the bad ... the people who drive us crazy. In most cases, they're not fooling anyone but themselves. We can see what's going on just like the people who came up with those great nicknames for the types of Pharisees. That just makes me all the more grateful when I see the many priests who are God-loving and good.

      Simple things like pie crust. Yes, you heard me ... pie crust. Its always a touchy subject among cooks and I can't blame anyone for using the pre-made ones in the red box (Pillsbury?). I have to admit they really are the best commercial alternative to homemade.    However, (you knew there  had  to be a "however", right?), in response to the comments for  urlLink Apple Pie  last week I had to post this recipe, which is the easiest and most foolproof I've ever found. When Rose was making it, she accidentally added an extra 1/4 cup of water and wound up with something like a thick batter. We improvised by sprinkling extra flour in until it looked right and ... voila! A delicious, flaky pie crust with no problem. Now that's hard to beat.  It is from  urlLink  The Man Who Ate Everything  by Jeffry Steingarten. Marion Cunningham, baker extraordinaire, made about a zillion pie crusts while detailing every step along the way so Steingarten could get it just right. The beauty of it is that this makes a lot more dough than you need so you don't have to worry about scrimping to get the crust just perfect when rolling it out.   I have posted it  urlLink here . It looks intimidating but that's because it details every step needed. Rose was a first time pie maker and had no problem. I also put a bonus recipe in the same spot for a Sour Cream Pound Cake. Enjoy!

      More to the point, "Will my cat, Puff, be there?"  This question is one that comes up time and again, especially with teenage animal-lovers around. This answer from Peter Kreeft's  urlLink Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Heaven  makes sense to me. He doesn't look at it from the "immortal soul" angle that usually is raised, but from the promise of a "new earth" that is made in the book of Revelation.  The simplest answer is: Why not? ... Much more reasonable is C.S. Lewis' speculation that we will be "between the angels who are our elder brothers and the beasts who are our jesters, servants, and playfellows" (That Hideous Strength). Scripture seems to confirm this: "thy judgments are like the great deep; man and beast thou savest, O Lord" (Psalm 36:6). Animals belong in the "new earth" (Revelation 21:1) as much as trees.  C.S. Lewis supposes that animals are saved "in" their masters, as part of their extended family (The Problem of Pain). Only tamed animals would be saved in this way. It would seem more likely that wild animals are in Heaven too, since wildness, otherness, not-mine-ness, is a proper pleasure for us. The very fact that the seagull takes no notice of me when it utters its remote, lonely call is part of its glory.  Would the same animals be in Heaven as on earth? "Is my dead cat in Heaven?" Again, why not? ... Though the blessed have better things to do than play with pets, the better does not exclude the lesser. We were meant from the beginning to have stewardship over the animals (Genesis 1:28); we have not fulfilled that divine plan yet on earth; therefore it seems likely that the right relationship with animals will be part of Heaven: proper "petship". And what better place to begin than with already petted pets?  UPDATE: There is a discussion going on over this at  urlLink Catholic and Enjoying It  where, interestingly enough, Mark Shea posed exactly the same question. Its worth taking a look at if you're interested in the subject.

      We didn't create our children, nor do we own them. This is good news. We don't need to blame ourselves for all our problems nor should we claim for ourselves their successes.  Children are gifts from God. They are given to us so we can offer them a safe, loving place to grow to inner and outer freedom. They are like strangers who ask for hospitality, become good friends, and then leave again to continue their journey. They bring immense joy and immense sorrow precisely because they are gifts. And a good gift, as a proverb says, is "twice given." the gift we receive, we have to give again ... They do not belong to us. They belong to God, and one of the greatest acts of trust in God is letting our children make their own choices and find their way.   Henri Nouwen

      Here's the best news I've read in a while, which says something about how dedicated I am to Alias. J.J. Abrams looked at Season 3 and couldn't believe his eyes when he saw how badly the show had lost its way. He now is dedicated to bringing it back to its former  urlLink glory .    "I can tell you my mission statement: Go back to what works about the show," Abrams announces. "Go back to character first. Go back to Sydney and Vaughn as a relationship that you rooted for. Go back to Sydney and Jack as a conflict of parent and child. I don't want to say too much, because I don't want to give away where it's going, but go back the dynamics that made the show absolutely function. The irony is that I felt the show was at its best.. when SD-6 existed and that's sortta the biggest hint that I will give in that storyline."   Hey, news like that makes it a lot easier to wait for the show to start again ...  in January!  Via  urlLink Aint It Cool .

      Read this chilling account by  urlLink Annie Jacobson  at "Women's Wall Street." While flying together, she and her family witnessed what was either a dry run for 14 terrorists practicing making a bomb in the airplane bathroom ... or an aborted bombing attempt, which I consider more probable.  On June 29, 2004, at 12:28 p.m., I flew on Northwest Airlines flight #327 from Detroit to Los Angeles with my husband and our young son. Also on our flight were 14 Middle Eastern men between the ages of approximately 20 and 50 years old. What I experienced during that flight has caused me to question whether the United States of America can realistically uphold the civil liberties of every individual, even non-citizens, and protect its citizens from terrorist threats.  ... The take-off was uneventful. But once we were in the air and the seatbelt sign was turned off, the unusual activity began. The man in the yellow T-shirt got out of his seat and went to the lavatory at the front of coach -- taking his full McDonald's bag with him. When he came out of the lavatory he still had the McDonald's bag, but it was now almost empty. He walked down the aisle to the back of the plane, still holding the bag. When he passed two of the men sitting mid-cabin, he gave a thumbs-up sign. When he returned to his seat, he no longer had the McDonald's bag.  Then another man from the group stood up and took something from his carry-on in the overhead bin. It was about a foot long and was rolled in cloth. He headed toward the back of the cabin with the object. Five minutes later, several more of the Middle Eastern men began using the forward lavatory consecutively. In the back, several of the men stood up and used the back lavatory consecutively as well.  For the next hour, the men congregated in groups of two and three at the back of the plane for varying periods of time. Meanwhile, in the first class cabin, just a foot or so from the cockpit door, the man with the dark suit - still wearing sunglasses - was also standing. Not one of the flight crew members suggested that any of these men take their seats  Watching all of this, my husband was now beyond anxious...    There is no doubt in my mind that racial profiling  must  be used to keep us safe. I didn't doubt this right after Sept. 11 and this article just makes it more imperative in my mind.   Also a  must read  about this whole incident is  urlLink The Mighty Barrister , whose always excellent commentary fleshes out the whole picture. That is where I saw this story. Thanks Mighty B!

      Protestant Elliot Bougis writes a thought provoking article,  urlLink Praying with the Enemy? Anti-Catholicism in the United States .    Anna Antonio hardly stands out. She is no political radical. She is no class clown. A friendly and diligent math major at the University of Florida, Anna is also a devout Christian. As she enters her junior year, Anna is just starting to fit in, to find her niche. Unfortunately, though, one of the craggiest niches for Anna to occupy is among her Christian friends.    No matter how quiet or friendly Anna is, she eventually faces a chilling question from her Christian peers. To an outsider, the question seems as harmless as a hand-grenade looks to a two-year-old. But to Anna, it rolls into a conversation with as much destructive power as a live grenade tossed into a barracks.    "So, Anna, what's your faith background?"      "Oh, I'm Catholic."      Stunned silence. Suspicious stares. Words are unnecessary. Their faces say enough: "Catholic? I thought you were a Christian. Don't you love God enough to...?"    I haven't experienced this personally although there is ample evidence in the media of general anti-Catholicism. Its surprising how many jokes or comments are routinely reported without comment that would cause an outraged outcry if made about any other group. I have long wanted to read  urlLink The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice  by Philip Jenkins. This article may be the impetus I need to finally spend that money at Amazon.    In addition to his own site, Elliot Bougis is the guest blogger at  urlLink Catholic and Enjoying It  which is where I saw this.

      I have been on a cooking moratorium for about a year now ... just doing what I must to get by. That's not what my family is accustomed to because I always have cooked a lot, stocked the freezer, etc. I think that my Christ Renews His Parish involvement took the extra energy and interest that I used to put into spaghetti sauce, homemade rolls, and salad dressings, to name just a few things.  Anyway, Rose made apple pie yesterday. She loves it and loves cooking so I found the recipes for her and she launched in. Other than a little faux pas with the pie crust ... which we recovered from gracefully ... it all went smoothly. She did everything but I hung around for instruction and tips. Tom has never been interested in cooking so I have gotten used to it as a solitary affair, although my parents liked to cook together when I was young. We rediscover this every so often, Rose and I, that cooking together is fun. So we're doing it again tonight ... making Spicy Dan Dan noodles.  The pie was great by the way. Oh, the apples weren't quite cooked in the middle and it was  really  runny. But it tasted good and the crust was better than anything you can buy. We ate it a la mode and talked about how we would adjust the recipe next time. Right after we make a peach pie ...

      Every time I read something new about Michael Moore it gets more unbelievable. According to a story in  urlLink Townhall.com , Moore included funeral footage of U.S. Air Force Maj. Gregory Stone without getting permission from the family.  It's been a big shock, and we are not very happy about it, to say the least," Kandi Gallagher, Stone's aunt and family spokeswoman, tells Washington Times reporter Audrey Hudson.  We are furious that Greg was in that casket and cannot defend himself, and my sister, Greg's mother, is just beside herself," Gallagher said. "She is furious. She called him a 'maggot that eats off the dead.'"  ...She described her nephew as a "totally conservative Republican" and said he would have found the film to be "putrid."

      I remember really surprising a good friend when I said that Jesus is a jokester with a really great sense of humor. Personal experience aside, its pretty easy to find proof of it in the Gospels where Jesus constantly uses humor to make points. And, as He told us over and over, we only can know the Father through the Son, so God must have the best jokes ever. Of course, if you don't know someone well there is a good chance of greatly offending fellow Christians with religious humor as Steve Tompkins aptly points  out in  urlLink Get them rolling in the aisles .  A perfect example is The Life of Brian. Few films can have been more picketed, thanks to its "blasphemous mockery of Christ". But the butt of the religious jokes are really Christ's painfully true-to-life followers, divided over whether to adore his unwanted gourd or his lost sandal. They manufacture miracles ("He's gone! He's been taken up!" "Oh no, there he is. Over there"), and are too busy being religious to hear his criticisms. Naturally, it was the ones at whom it was directed who failed to see the message of the satire.  ...And Jesus himself made fun of those whose zeal for the letter of the law blinded them to what it was actually about: they strained their drink to ensure they didn't break their fast by inadvertently swallowing a gnat, and overlooked the camel bobbing around in the cup. Probably loses something in translation, but I bet it was funny.  Via  urlLink connexions .

       urlLink Adult Children Speak Out About Same-Sex Parents   ...This week, as the Senate is expected to begin debate on a constitutional amendment to protect marriage, many voices will try to convince you that people like Cassidy are, as Cheryl Jacque, head of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, put it in a recent letter, "hate-filled people who will stop at nothing to achieve their discriminatory, offensive goals."  But Cassidy knows better: She is one of the first generation of "gayby boom" babies, raised by two moms. Adult children of same-sex parents are rare.  ...Why does she oppose same-sex marriage? "It's not something that a seal of approval should be stamped on: We shouldn't say it is a great and wonderful thing and then you have all these kids who later in life will turn around and realize they've been cheated. The adults choose to have that lifestyle and then have a kid. They are fulfilling their emotional needs -- they want to have a child -- and they are not taking into account how that's going to feel to the child; there's a clear difference between having same-sex parents and a mom and a dad."

       urlLink THE AMAZING RACE  - WEEK TWO I wasn't going to blog about this every week but "lower case julie" (lcj) and I carried on team evaluation in the comments box from last week's Amazing Race post so ...  Never was a more unpleasant couple eliminated than Alison and Donny. Just when you thought one person couldn't possibly be meaner to another, the other person would pop back with something even worse. If they get nothing else from this experience, I certainly hope they  never  get back together.  The girls and I still like Charla and Mirna's team best. lcj mentioned that she dislikes seeing Charla use her "little person" stature to get ahead. Usually I'd agree but in this case I just see it as evening the odds since Charla can't run very fast, etc. Mostly I like her attitude. When Mirna was second guessing herself over choosing the tango instead of walking eight dogs (yes, that's the kind of show it is) because of possible lost time, Charla just said, "Who knows what would have happened?" and let any bad choices blow away. No blame, just moving forward ... I liked that.  The real fascination is watching the combination of outrageous game show and soap opera. The stresses of the game bring out really interesting character strengths and flaws. The group dynamics are addictive. Even Tom stopped working on his laptop to watch and laugh when a twin herded a cow into a corner only to have Chip pluck off it's bandanna ... you only could appreciate that moment fully if you had seen the bad blood between them after the taxi stand-off earlier.

      Karen Marie Knapp at From the Anchor Hold highlights 37 posts about Scripture, Church governance, politics, culture and much more in her  urlLink 26th Christian Carnival . I haven't read all of them but the ones I have seen are really good.  Start with this one from the Curt Jester who thinks about  urlLink  Prayer and Punditry , specifically the need to pray first and criticize second. This excellent post is the one that alerted me to the existence of the carnival in the first place so I'm doubly thankful to have read it.  Prayer is the very foundation that has to be built first if we truly want to evangelize others and to spread the truth. I am no prayer warrior (still in prayer boot camp actually) but I know the dangers of punditry without prayer. When you are not praying and meditating daily it is too easy to become uncharitable. First reflect on your own sin before raising your gaze to others.

      We'll never know. And I don't really care because  urlLink Things My Girlfriend And I Have Argued About  is just too funny.  That's not to say that she's a bad driver. She's a better driver than I am, certainly. But a better driver in, um, well, by the "male" definition of better, let's say. If we were in a rally, Margret would leave me in the dust. She is never more alive than when reversing into a tight space. Gears matter to her. However, I've only had one crash, and that was indisputably not my fault (someone drove through a red light into the side of me). Margret has hit countless things. Hit them in England. Hit them in Germany. (I was in a car with Margret in Germany once, when she'd been back and forth between there and England quite frequently. She's racing along the centre of a country road. A car appears heading straight for us, and Margret shouts at me, 'Which side should I be on!?' A nice moment. If I'd been out to score points I'd have remarked that, if you're asking that question, then perhaps slowing down at all might be a thing to do also. I didn't say anything, however, as at that point I was busy finding religion.)  Via  urlLink Short Attention Span Theater .

      Following up on Pete Townshend's complaints that Michael Moore "bullied and slurred" him, the  urlLink Washington Post  found international reaction to Moore is less than favorable. What's hilarious is that while Americans who disapprove of Moore call him anti-American, overseas he's seen as all too typical. They don't think too much of his logic either.  He is more than occasionally described as a stereotypical "ugly American" -- overbearing to people of different cultures, oblivious to nuance, unsophisticated in politics and arrogant in temperament.  ..."Moore may or may not affect the election," Ibish concluded. "But he has certainly succeeding [sic] in bringing to a great many Americans the most powerful critique of US foreign policy they have ever heard, albeit one that rests on a bizarre and incoherent conspiracy theory and which confuses at least as much as it enlightens."

      Yikes! It is one thing for my mother to think that anyone who has religious faith is an "anti-modernist" or directly opposed to "science, reason and logic." It is another to read this quote from a former U.S. Labor Secretary who I would hope would be a little more open minded about such things.  Terrorism is a tactic, not a belief," he writes. The true battle will be between modern civilization and anti-modernists; between those who believe in the primacy of the individual and those who believe that human beings owe their allegiance and identity to a higher authority; between those who give priority to life in this world and those who believe that human life is mere preparation for an existence beyond life; between those who believe in science, reason, and logic and those who believe that truth is revealed through Scripture and religious dogma. Terrorism will disrupt and destroy lives. But terrorism itself is not the greatest danger we face.  Reich's remarks appeared in  urlLink The American Prospect . Commentary on the article appears in such diverse publications as  urlLink Christianity Today  and  urlLink National Review Online . Both come to the same conclusion. Reich's commentary is tantamount to declaring a war on the religious. I understand not liking how someone else's point of view but this is ridiculous. Ramesh Ponnaru's reaction is the best, nay the only one, for either a person of faith or an American.   I will not reciprocate the sentiment. Reich is not my enemy, although I certainly want most of what he stands for politically not to prevail. I don't think we have to have the battle he forecasts. I hope we don't. In fact, I pray we don't.  Via guest blogger Elliot Bougis at  urlLink Catholic and Enjoying It .

      LUKE 11:5-13, THE PARABLE OF THE PERSISTENT HOUSEHOLDER In this parable Jesus presents us with the householder who has had a late guest show up. They are out of bread and have to go to great lengths to wake up a neighbor for bread. Jesus then points out that we do not have to go to these extreme lengths to get what we need. God is our generous, loving father who will not make us beg. What is not clear to the modern mind is just what extremes of "shameless persistence" Jesus was presenting to Jews of that time. I was amazed at the degree of trouble that these few sentences represent. William Barclay tells us exactly what the hapless householder had to go through to borrow that bread.  Travelers often journeyed late in the evening to avoid the heat of the midday sun. In Jesus' story just such a traveler had arrived towards midnight at his friend's house. In the east hospitality is a sacred duty; it was not enough to set before a man a bare sufficiency; the guest had to be confronted with an ample abundance. In the villages bread was baked at home. Only enough for the day's needs was baked because, if it was kept and became stale, no one would wish to eat it.   The late arrival of the traveler confronted the householder with an embarrassing situation, because his larder was empty and he could not fulfill the sacred obligations of hospitality. Late as it was, he went out to borrow from a friend. The friend's door was shut. In the east no one would knock on the shut door of a house unless the need was imperative. In the morning the door was opened and remained open all day, for there was little privacy; but if the door was shut, that was a definite sign that the householder did not wish to be disturbed. But the seeking householder was not deterred. He knocked, and kept on knocking.  The poorer Palestinian house consisted of one room with only one little window. The floor was simply of beaten earth covered with dried reeds and rushes. The room was divided into two parts, not by a partition but by a low platform. Two-thirds of it were on ground level. The other third was slightly raised. On the raised part the charcoal stove burned all night, and round it the whole family slept, not on raised beds but on sleeping mats. Families were large and they slept close together for warmth. For one to rise was inevitably to disturb the whole family. Further, in the villages it was the custom to bring the livestock, the hens and the cocks and the goats, into the house at night.  Is there any wonder that the man who was in bed did not want to rise. But the determined borrower knocked on with shameless persistence - that is what the Greek word means - until at last the householder, knowing that by this time the whole family was disturbed, arose and gave him what he needed.

      This movie was so satisfying on so many levels. It has all the action, color and outrageousness expected from a comic book/super hero movie. Spider-Man is even more like a spider in this movie than the first right down to the various "resting" poses as he perches above people. The characters are properly fleshed out. Doc Ock isn't given just a couple of throw away lines so that we know he begins as a decent human being. He has several scenes to establish him as a likeable, caring humanitarian. All this and more has been written about by reviewers much more competent than I. The  urlLink Decent Films review  is probably my favorite of the ones I've read.  However, I don't think that Decent Films takes it far enough in the struggle that Peter Parker faces. This movie also is about the next step to becoming great, the day-to-day reality of being a super hero. The first movie showed Peter learning the reality of his uncle's favorite phrase, "With great power comes great responsibility." This movie is about just what must be sacrificed to achieve greatness. It is not just about the sacrifices (even of our hopes and dreams) that we must make when taking up great responsibility. It also is about the process of discerning our path and that the sacrifice must be whole hearted.  Peter Parker is miserable because being Spider-Man is forcing him to be less than whole hearted at the other things that he loves in his life. We learn later that he has taken up this responsibility because he felt it as a debt to his uncle; these were his uncle's ideals he was living out. It is only when Spider-Man faces the sacrifice squarely in the face and  then  still wholeheartedly embraces the responsibility, that he can truly be great. Some think that the fact that he still gains his heart's desire in the end is a cop out but I don't agree. Often it is just when we have made the effort necessary to embrace what we think is a sacrifice that we find our greatest rewards. This is a Catholic concept and I think this movie shows it perfectly.  Heavy stuff for a comic book movie? Yeah, but its handled well in an action packed, lighthearted package, full of eye candy, so go anyway.

      Pete Vere gives us the scoop on what's happening with the  urlLink Kerry heresy case  and a rough draft of an  urlLink article  he hopes to submit to "The Wanderer." One thing he makes clear is something that I didn't fully understand myself.  On this note, it is important to remember that the heresy is not that they frequent Holy Communion, as has been misunderstood by some acting in good faith on our side.  This is a separate problem.  The heresy in question is that the topic of abortion is one of private morality, and that one can legitimately be privately opposed to abortion while defending and promoting a public "right" to dismember and butcher a child in the womb.

       urlLink MARCH UPCOUNTRY  BY DAVID WEBER & JOHN RINGO "Travel to distant lands, meet strange and exotic native peoples, and kill them."   That's military science fiction for you, although in this case it also is the slogan of the Bronze Battalion of the Empress' Own Regiment.  After terrorist sabotage, Prince Roger MacClintock and the Bronze Battalion space marines are stranded in the wilderness of the planet Marduk, noted for high mountains, high temperatures, low technology and the short tempers of its nine-foot, four-armed, slime-covered natives. They must march halfway around the planet to get to the nearest spaceport. Along the way, they must make allies and battle barbarian tribes who are out to destroy everything in their path. All this turns the prince from a spoiled brat into a valuable member of the company and a true leader.   Great storytelling and plot, deceptively deep characterization, and a sneaky sense of humor all contribute to make this a thoroughly enjoyable read. Unlike most military science fiction and indeed, other works by the two authors separately, these books don't get too bogged down in technical details or battle descriptions. In fact, the battles scenes are handled so skillfully that I actually read all of them instead of skipping them as I might in other books. History buffs might recognize this as a takeoff on the story of  urlLink Xenophon .  This is the first of a series continued in  urlLink March to the Sea  and  urlLink March to the Stars . Fans are awaiting the next installment to see where Prince Roger will march to next.

      When Pete Townshend wouldn't allow Michael Moore to use one of his songs in Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore started bad-mouthing Townshend according to a story in  urlLink Ireland On Line .   I greatly resent being bullied and slurred by him just because he didn't get what he wanted from me. It seems to me that this aspect of his nature is not unlike that of the powerful and willful man at the centre of his documentary.  That sounds about right. I've never been interested in documentaries so I haven't seen any of Michael Moore's movies. Even if I was interested, I don't think I'd pick Moore to inform me. Ken Burns he ain't. Even Moore's admirers have to admit that often there are gaping logic holes in his work. From what I can tell he has an ego that won't quit, something else that won't make me want to support him by paying for a movie. The only admirable thing I've ever seen about him is that when he was laid off, he didn't just sit around collecting unemployment, he actually created a job for himself. Too bad that job consists of being a whining, complaining bully.  Thanks to Tom for seeing this on  urlLink Google News .

      There's a woman who is embroidering. Her son, seated on a low stool, sees her work, but in reverse. He sees the knots of the embroidery, the tangled threads. He says, "Mother, what are you doing? I can't make out what you are doing!" Then mother lowers the embroidery hoop and shows the good part of the work. Each color is in place and the various threads form a harmonious design. So, we see the reverse side of the embroidery because we are seated on the low stool.   St. Pio

      This time of year I am reminded why Tom and I love Bishop Lynch High School. I remember before Hannah's freshman year we went to a parent-hosted party that was jammed full of gung-ho parents who all "loved" Bishop Lynch. Oh, sure. These parents had to be the top 10% who never look below the surface, right? What school, Catholic or not, could merit that kind of praise?  Well, they were right. Sure there have been a few bad teachers, a few less than ideal situations. That is unavoidable. Those situations are training in making things work out ... lessons in people skills for the future. What makes this school so great? The academics are top notch but that can be found at a lot of schools. The difference is that Bishop Lynch (BL) has the most Catholic attitude I've ever seen ... and they make the kids live it.  It shows first of all in their acceptance policy. They'll pass up a straight A student with a bad discipline record for a well behaved one with a C average. If you have school aged kids, I don't have to tell you how unusual that is, especially for a college prep school that regularly turns away half the applicants for lack of space. They can have their pick and they pick character.  The first pep rally Hannah ever attended had one of those goofy contests to see which class could cheer the loudest. The freshman class cheered and then the senior class booed them as a joke. Guess what? That's not the BL way. The seniors stayed behind for a huge lecture, the class president read a letter of apology on "BL Live" (the school morning news show) the next morning, and for the next two weeks every freshman was talked to and hugged by seniors making amends for not being welcoming. That made a huge impact on the freshman class ... and on us because most people would take a little good natured booing in stride as a joke.  What brought all this to mind was the letter we received from the school yesterday. The Dean of Students was writing to compliment Hannah on her perfect conduct record for the second year running. She's a good kid but it isn't unusual to get a detention when they can be given out for unbuttoning one too many shirt buttons or wearing the wrong shoes. What  is  unusual is for the school to take the time to find these kids and specifically write to compliment their behavior.  These all are the sorts of things we looked for in vain at the girls' Catholic grade school. We finally decided that it was too idealistic to expect them. In this day and age, who holds to such standards of character? What a pleasure to be proven wrong.

      LUKE 10:25-37, THE GOOD SAMARITAN There isn't anyone in Western culture who doesn't know the classic story of the good Samaritan rescuing the half-dead traveler. It adds a whole new depth of understanding and nuance to know the importance of the scene in which Jesus placed this story. As always, William Barclay is of great assistance in this.  ... The road from Jerusalem to Jericho was a notoriously dangerous road. Jerusalem is 2,300 feet above sea-level; the Dead Sea, near which Jericho stood, is 1,300 feet below sea-level. So then, in somewhat less than 20 miles, this road dropped 3,600 feet. It was a road of narrow, rocky defiles, and of sudden turnings which made it the happy hunting-ground of brigands. In the fifth century Jerome tells us that it was still called "The Red, or Bloody Way." In the 19th century it was still necessary to pay safety money to the local Sheiks before one could travel on it. As late as the early 1930s H.V. Morton tells us that he was warned to get home before dark, if he intended to use the road, because a certain Abu Jildah was an adept at holding up cars and robbing travelers and tourists, and escaping to the hills before the police could arrive.  What becomes more obvious is that the traveler not only is badly injured but is that way because of his own reckless behavior. The lesson is more pointed when we realize that it does not matter if the person needs help because of their own deliberately foolish actions. They still need help and we are the ones called upon to give it should we happen across them. Translated into the types of situations I come across in my own life that means no self righteousness allowed. Ouch!

       urlLink THE AMAZING RACE  Ahhhh, life is good. The Amazing Race is back on the air ... the only "reality" show I ever cared about. Ok, it isn't a reality show at all but at least it doesn't pretend to be. It is just the best game show ever. All the challenges of the game bring out the best and worst in everyone.  The girls and I have evaluated all the pairs ... not from their possibility of winning, but from those that we like the best. You know, the ones who  should  win. Yeah, its girlie, so sue us ... we're girls and its  fun!  Charla definitely is the coolest person of the entire bunch. We thought that she'd never be able to keep up with the running. Turns out that she more than compensates for that by being the smartest, savviest, and calmest under pressure. It doesn't hurt that she knows exactly how to get extra help from bystanders as a "little person" and that she sees everything from a different angle. Her cousin is pretty lucky to have a partner like that. The top pairs: little person Charla and her cousin Mirna; the moms who are best friends, Linda and Karen; dating couple Brandon and Nicole; married couple Chip and Kim.  Everyone else has a fatal mean/selfish streak in either one or both people so we cross our fingers that they will be eliminated. It figures that the pair we hated most, Alison and Donny, nipped into first place. Oh well, we'll see what next week brings.

      The July/August issue of  urlLink Crisis  is out and it really has some great articles ... "Breaking Vows: When Faithful Catholics Divorce," "The Death of Morality," a surprising column by Colleen Carroll Campbell about the joy her father brings others even though he is in the throes of Alzheimer's.  The article that struck me most, though, was "After the Council: Living Vatican II," which discusses how to fully implement the council teachings. In these days when every Church problem is blamed on Vatican II and American Catholics wonder if there will ever be a time without strife within the Church, it is nice to see that this is not an anomaly in Church history. It gives me great hope.  But history has even more important lessons. Christopher Dawson once identified six great periods of Church history, and each one begins with a crisis. Nearly all of the 21 ecumenical councils have upset the church's equilibrium. The aftermaths of Nicea and Chalcedon shook the Church to the foundations in a way that makes recent decades look like a tea party. That most of the Church didn't immediately "get" the teachings of Vatican II also has ample precedent. The same thing happened after the Council of Trent, whose decrees were ignored in France for almost a century. St. Augustine reminds us that the work of the Holy Spirit in the church is slow, often imperceptible, but without interruption.  And just as the Council of Trent was implemented - in fact, rescued - by a few great popes, especially St. Pius V, we now have in the pontificate of John Paul II the council's definitive interpretation. One reason for Wojtyla's election in 1978 was the conclave's awareness of his vigorous promotion of the council's decrees in the Archdiocese of Krakow.  ...This pope has taken the documents of Vatican II for what they are: marching orders for the new millennium. And he has expanded their richness and application. Whoever the next pope may be, he won't have to do much writing ... They have touched enough intelligent Catholics, especially among the laity, to change the church in the long run. This is how the Holy Spirit works. Two thousand years have taught us the Church's remarkable recuperative powers. And whether it was the sixth or the 16th century, spiritual renewal has always been a matter of grassroots movements inspired by and working with the papacy. The difference now is that whereas for Gregory the Great and Pius V the agents of evangelization were monks or Jesuits, for John Paul II it will be the laity.  Get a copy of "Crisis" now or check out the article when it is posted on their website after the next issue comes out.

It doesn't hurt that I love subways but DART helps immeasurably in moving teenagers and their friends around without crippling the families with hours of "taxi" time. There are slight adaptations made among this circle of friends for safety reasons (calling ahead when leaving, calling parents on arrival, etc.) but all in all DART is a great, world class feature of living in Dallas.

      Islam is something that all of us are going to wind up knowing more about. The question is what type of information will help form our opinions? I recently came across material from three independent sources. Although all took very even handed looks at Islam, the conclusion reached was at odds with the picture I have gotten from the general media ... you know, the religion of peace that practically goes hand-in-hand with Judaism and Christianity except for a few glitches.   First I read an article in the May  urlLink Commentary  magazine that examines Islam from a strictly secular point of view to see what sort of a religion it really is. The conclusion is that, contrary to what we usually hear from many official Church spokesman, it is  not  grounded in divine revelation. The article is doubly interesting because in the process the author also examines the development of the Catholic Church's two stated opinions about Islam. The first opinion was agreed upon by St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas who both outright rejected it.  ...Aquinas argues that Muhammad was a seducer of men whose commandments appeal only to the carnal appetites; that the truths he taught are of the lower variety, suited to vulgar minds; that mixed in with these truths are teachings of a fabulous nature that utterly compromise them; and that the plausibility of his doctrines rested on the power of his weapons - a characteristic he shared with brigands and tyrants. As for Muhammad's use of the Old and New Testaments, he disfigured them both with mythical concoctions while forbidding his followers to read the originals. In sum, "those who place their faith in his word believe mindlessly."  What Kind of Religion is Islam? Alain Besancon   The second opinion arose from an effort to meet Muslims in such a way that they would accept the Church's arguments. As early as 1390 a new style of debating with Muslims arose that avoided discussions assuming Christianity's basic assurance that it is the right way to reach God ... through Jesus Christ. This essentially put both religions on equal footing and led the way for the more politically correct emphasis seen in modern times.  I was very interested to see that the conclusions of this secular article were practically identical to one I had read soon after September 11 from the apologetics magazine, Envoy,  urlLink ISLAM: A Religion of Peace?  This article went into more details about the basics of Islamic belief as it was helping set up the basis for any discussions readers might find themselves in with Muslims. Certainly it supported the idea that Islam has differences from Christianity on a very basic level.  The Qur'an states that Jesus never died on the Cross. Muslims claim that crucifixion is not fitting for a prophet of Allah. Islam teaches that God has no Son and that the Incarnation is a blasphemous offense against the unity of God. Just as significantly, Islam cannot account for suffering and sacrifice, and that is the crucial difference between it and Christianity. It is the choice between humble self-sacrifice and dominating power. It is the difference between peace and violence.  Imagine my surprise when recently I read what Pope John Paul II wrote about Islam in  urlLink Crossing the Threshold of Hope . This book has been amazing overall because it showed me that the Pope has his finger on the pulse of the average person, something that is hard for me to imagine as I always think of him being closeted away from average folk. Having read those articles was very helpful because I could recognize that not only did Our Holy Father know all that they had written about but he could express it succinctly and wisely. The heart of the matter is shown here.  Whoever knows the Old and New Testaments, and then reads the Koran, clearly sees the  process by which it completely reduces Divine Revelation.  It is impossible not to note the movement away from what God said about Himself, first in the Old Testament through the Prophets, and then finally in the New Testament through His Son. In Islam all the richness of God's self-revelation, which constitutes the heritage of the Old and New Testaments, has definitely been set aside.  Some of the most beautiful names in the human language are given to the God of the Koran, but He is ultimately a God outside of the world, a god who is  only Majesty, never Emmanuel,  God-with-us.  Islam is not a religion of redemption.  There is no room for the Cross and the Resurrection. Jesus is mentioned, but only as a prophet who prepares for the last prophet, Muhammad. There is also mention of Mary, His virgin Mother, but the tragedy of redemption is completely absent. For this reason not only the theology but also the anthropology of Islam is very distant from Christianity. ( Crossing the Threshold of Hope  by Pope John Paul II, pages 92-93.)  All this is a rather cursory look at an obviously complex issue. However, it has become clear that I need to read more. The question is where to go from here?

When these precautionary measures have not had their effect...and the person in question, with obstinate persistence, still presents himself to receive the Holy Eucharist, the minister of Holy Communion must refuse to distribute it.  As practically everyone in St. Blog's already has pointed out, this is very far from Cardinal McCarrick's lukewarm version of what they were told. I'd say more but Domenico Bettinelli says it so much better. Go read about it at  urlLink Bettnet .  IF IT QUACKS LIKE A DUCK...  urlLink Erik's Rants and Recipes  has a few choice words for people who don't like labels.  I don't trust people who make a big deal of not liking labels. You know the type:  "Oh, I don't like labels, it just simplifies what I believe, etc., etc."  In the matter of how one lives one's faith, a professed avoidance of labels invariably means that the label-hater is a heretic.  BRINGING THE GOSPEL TO THE WORLD Nominated for my "worst homily ever" award is the one we heard in Austin ... a mishmash of social concerns which I believe the priest thought was appropriate because it was a patriotic day. If only he had related any of it to the Gospel or given any practical advice on how to do it beyond telling us to vote.  urlLink Catholic Analysis'  thoughts about Sunday's readings did a much better job.  Today, we have the tendency to be much more accepting of those rejecting the Gospel. We tend to be too accepting of a secular society with the result that our witness becomes muted. In authentic Christianity, there will always be an element of judgment and of separation. There is indeed an element of exclusion which is the result of free decisions. In modern America, one of the greatest secular sins is to be "exclusive." Exclusivity is indeed bad if it is closed to the conversion of the other through a pre-judgment. But exclusivity that results from the free rejection of the Gospel is not bad in itself, but merely the accurate reflection of the free decision of one rejecting the Gospel. One way in which we avoid committing the secular sin of excluding anyone even if he or she rejects the Gospel is to fail to preach the authentic Gospel in the first place. Instead, we preach something quite contrary to the Gospel: that no decision need be made for or against the Gospel.

      I  vaguely remember that Mother Teresa spoke to the National Prayer Breakfast. What I didn't realize was what she said and how she said it. Peggy Noonan's eye witness account  urlLink Still, Small Voice  made me think of one of God's prophets appearing. Mother Teresa didn't follow the standard speech giving "rules." No hand shaking or chatting or sitting on the dias with the powerful. No jokes or putting everyone at ease. Just saying what everyone needed to hear and not necessarily the way everyone wanted to hear it. Also surprising in that account is the reaction of those who didn't agree with her.  It was something, the silence and surprise with which her words were received. Perhaps she didn't know that we don't talk about birth control in speeches in America. Perhaps she didn't know, or care, that her words were, as they say, not "healing" but “divisive," dividing not only Protestant from Catholic but Catholic from Catholic. It was all so unhappily unadorned, explicit, impolitic. And it was wonderful, like a big fresh drink of water, bracing in its directness and its uncompromising tone.  And of course it was startling, too, as if someone had spoken in favor of the Volsted Act  (ed. note: Prohibition) . And indeed the Clintons and Gores looked, by the end, as if they’d heard someone promise to outlaw Merlot.  And Mother Teresa seemed neither to notice nor to care. She finished her speech to a standing ovation and left as she had entered, silently, through a parted curtain, in a flash of blue and white.  Read the entire  urlLink speech  for yourself. Both it and Noonan's article are classics. Via  urlLink Being or Nothingness .

      We just got back from Austin where a Davis family mini-reunion was going on. We all met in Austin and then trekked out to Round Top in the middle of the countryside for their annual parade. My kids were pretty sure we'd finally reached the official Middle of Nowhere but I loved it. Round Top is set in the middle of rolling hills and lots of trees. Not exactly the picture of Texas that we have been left with by the movies, its on the edge of the hill country.  The parade has grown from the days when the Davis family had a farm in nearby Giddings but in essence it was still the same sweet, country parade we expected. Various patriotic speeches were made and the cannon was set off to signal the start. Floats with politicians, veterans and pretty girls went by; groups rode horses, miniature horses pulled buggies, boys even rode longhorn steers ... it was the kind of event that you think doesn't happen any more except it still happens all over the country, I'd venture to say.  I think that a lot of people in the media and Hollywood would have been surprised at how the speeches were used to emphatically approve of God and religion being mixed in with politics and daily life. Certainly, they would have been surprised at the wholehearted approval with which such sentiments were met. This is the heart of America that is not understood by a lot of the people who run the country ... with love of God and family values at the center of it.  I have had certain sophisticated people tell me that my values are simplistic and most of America doesn't think like that any more. They need to spend a little time someplace like Round Top. It certainly would open their eyes ... and wouldn't take more than the time to watch a parade.

      That your enemies have been created is God's doing; that they hate you and wish to ruin you is their own doing. What should you say about them in your mind? "Lord be merciful to them, forgive them their sins, put the fear of God in them, change them!" You are loving in them not what they are, but what you would have them to become.   St. Augustine

      This is one of the most satisfying movies I have ever seen, possibly because it is true to life. In the southern Gobi Desert families of nomads raise camels. A camel has a long and painful delivery and refuses to let her baby near her. It will die unless she can be persuaded to take it back. That will happen after she weeps when listening to a traditional song played on the violin. This is a simple story but one that is much more cheerful that the subject would sound. In the process we see how the family lives and, when the two boys are sent to town to fetch a musician, we see how modernization is creeping in. It fascinates the younger boy who loves to watch television but, interestingly to me, the older boy does not seem tempted by it. As painful as it was to watch the baby camel cry for his mother and run to catch her, it was equally joyful when the music worked its charms and she relented. Watching the "reunited" pair was really unbelievable and it is undeniable that the music is what did the trick.  I discovered when reading Roger Ebert's  urlLink review  that this was not strictly filmed as it happened but that makes it a no less valid look at these people and their way of life.  The movie has been made in the same way that Robert Flaherty made such documentaries as "Nanook of the North," "Men of Aran" and "Louisiana Story." It uses real people in real places and essentially has them play themselves in a story inspired by their lives. That makes it a "narrative documentary," according to the filmmakers. A great many documentaries are closer to this model than their makers will admit; even "cinema verite" must pick and choose from the available footage and reflect a point of view.

      Yippee! I'm Augustine ... my hero!  "God will not suffer man to have the knowledge of things to come; for if he had prescience of his prosperity he would be careless; and understanding of his adversity he would be senseless."   You are Augustine! You love to study tough issues and don't mind it if you lose sleep over them. Everyone loves you and wants to talk to you and hear your views, you even get things like "nice debating with you." Yep, you are super smart, even if you are still trying to figure it all out. You're also very honest, something people admire, even when you do stupid things.  Find out which Christian theologian you are with this  urlLink quiz .

      The story of God ordering Abraham to sacrifice Isaac usually is used to point out Abraham's total obedience and trust in God. Those of us who are parents can't imagine just saying, "Sure thing, Lord." and picking up the knife. That kind of thing usually leads to lengthy insanity hearings later. However, there is another side that I've never heard mentioned ... Isaac's role.  I was blown away the first time I realized that Isaac knew exactly what was going on. After all he grew up watching his father make animal sacrifices. True, he asks where the sacrifice will come from but that still leaves him lying on that altar watching his father brandish the knife over him without any recorded protest. How's that for obedience and trust? What I didn't realize until reading it yesterday was that Isaac's significance goes far beyond underscoring trust. He is a "type," a forerunner of Christ, as  urlLink In Conversation with God  points out. Very cool.  Origen points out that the sacrifice of Isaac makes us more clearly understand the mystery of the Redemption. "The fact that Isaac was compelled to carry the wood for the holocaust is a figure of Christ who was made to carry his cross on his shoulders. But at the same time, carrying the wood for the holocaust is the task of a priest. So Isaac was both victim and priest... Christ is at one and the same time Victim and High Priest. Indeed, according to the spirit, He offers the victim to his Father; according to the flesh, He himself is offered on the altar of the Cross.  In Conversation with God, Vol. 4  (Origen, Homilies on the Book of Genesis, 8, 6, 9)]

      THE GOSPEL AND THE MOVIE Our learned Deacon Ken is doing a Bible study of the Gospel of John that features watching part of the  urlLink  movie  after we discuss the chapters. DK knows his stuff and its all very illuminating. Of course, its not really fair to judge a movie that you watch in pieces but it seems like a typical "Bible" movie to me ... in other words, not the best "movie" I've ever seen although an interesting accompaniment to studying the gospel.  It does have a lot of great stuff though. So far my favorite is John the Baptist. Now this guy really looks like he's been living on locusts and honey in the desert, dressed in a skin ... the stuff crazy prophets are made of. When the Pharisees asked why he was baptizing, he jumped up and started waving his arms around and wailing about being the voice in the wilderness. You could just see the Pharisees edging away, not daring to turn their backs on this nut in case he jumped them. Perfect.  As for the other actors, they all are about what you'd expect. Except Mary. She looks like a dowager duchess who is slumming without her diamond necklace and formal gown. I could handle an old Mary who looks like she might have ever set foot in the Middle East but what were they thinking to cast this woman? She looks as if she's about to call Jeeves over to discuss the wine list. I can't wait to see how she handles the crucifixion scene.  Jesus is ok although I understood what Tom meant when he said that Jesus was a little too "groovy" for him. Well, Jim Caviezel set that bar pretty high in "The Passion of the Christ" so I can live with a "groovy" Jesus even if he does have the obligatory English accent. As Hannah says, doesn't everyone know that Jesus spoke with an American accent?

       urlLink THE TERMINAL  The girls and I saw The Terminal yesterday. It was funny but fell short of being a great comedy. Just like Victor Naborsky, stranded in the terminal, I kept waiting for the character development that would have taken this movie past the "ok for rental" point but unfortunately its not there. We saw very little of anyone's motivation and none of the characters really learned anything.  All the characters were treated much the same as the villain, who was merely a villain. We never knew why he was so awful. He repeatedly was given examples and specifically told how he needed to change but never made any attempt. It would have moved him past being such a two-dimensional character if we had been told what made him unable to change. Of course, minor characters don't need this but in this movie it was if all of the characters were minor in that sense. Wonderful acting from the great cast can't save a movie in that case.   It would be far more satisfying to rent  urlLink Moscow on the Hudson  which deals humorously and well with similar themes of a foreigner stranded in this country learning our culture. Too bad I seem to remember some "R" rated material or I'd get that to show the girls.

       urlLink Astro Lounge   urlLink Smash Mouth   urlLink Get the Picture  How do you describe Smash Mouth? They're listed under alternative rock but that tends to send out a foreboding image, at least to someone like me, that just can't describe how much fun it is listening to them. They have songs about little green men, how wonderful life on Earth is, and then take on social and personal problems that would drag you down forever ... if they weren't just so darn happy and irreverent about it all at the same time. In other words, they're unpredictable. Just take "All Star", the song most people have heard because it was featured in Shrek. In the midst of all that bouncy "only shooting stars break the mold" there's a little message about global warming. The music is all over the place, 60's and 70's sounds, reggae, punk, psychedelic, surfer rock ... and a drummer that works overtime even on the slow songs. They're the summer music of choice at our house ... and just plain fun.

      Oswald Sobrino at Catholic Analysis looks at the analysis of recent employment figures and points out what a  urlLink spoiled nation  we are. Be sure to read the whole thing because he covers much more than just statistical figures.  So when news comes in that, according to  one  of the Labor Department's statistical measures on employment, "only" 32,000 jobs were created, the media reaction is that the employment situation is "dismal." That reaction is a sign of a spoiled and weak culture that lives in a fantasy world. What nation in the world would not trade their economy for ours? How many emigrate from the United States to settle in other countries?  What makes the "spoiled nation" syndrome even more absurd is that another official statistical measure of job growth shows that jobs grew in July by  629,000.    I welcome Sobrino's common sense especially because these doomsday pronouncements always seem to come just when all the business people I know are giving each other reports of "We're doing better bit by bit if only the government won't make one of their  statements ." You'd be surprised how many people  check in  with each other on business progress; even some executives from large companies will discuss this with us in our little three-person company. Now if we could just get the  talking heads  to use some of the same common sense we'd be ok.

      THE ROAD OF LIFE At first, I saw God as my observer, my judge, keeping track of the things I did wrong, so as to know whether I merited heaven or hell when I die. He was out there sort of like a president. I recognized His picture when I saw it, but I really didn't know Him. But later on when I met Christ, it seemed as though life were rather like a bike ride, but it was a tandem bike, and I noticed that Christ was in the back helping me pedal. I don't know just when it was that He suggested we change places, but life has not been the same since.  When I had control, I knew the way. It was rather boring, but predictable it was the shortest distance between two points. But when He took the lead, He knew delightful long cuts, up mountains, and through rocky places at breakneck speeds. It was all I could do to hang on!  Even though it looked like madness, He said, "Pedal!" I worried and was anxious and asked, "Where are you taking me?" He laughed and didn't answer, and I started to learn to trust. I forgot my boring life and entered into the adventure, and when I'd say, "I'm scared," He'd lean back and touch my hand. I gained love, peace, acceptance and joy; gifts to take on my journey, My Lord's and mine. And we were off again.  He said, "Give the gifts away. They're extra baggage, too much weight." So I did, to the people we met, and I found that in giving I received, and still our burden was light.  I did not trust Him, at first, in control of my life. I thought He'd wreck it; but he knows bike secrets, knows how to make it bend to take sharp corners, knows how to jump to clear high rocks, knows how to fly to shorten, scary passages. And I am learning to shut up and pedal in the strangest places, and I'm beginning to enjoy the view and the cool breeze on my face with my delightful constant companion, Jesus Christ.  And when I'm sure I just can't do it anymore, He just smiles and says..."Pedal."

      Karen Marie at  urlLink From The Anchor Hold  reminds us that today is both the feast of the Transfiguration and the commemoration of the destruction of Hiroshima.  Those two cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were not chosen because they were the heart of Japanese Catholicism; that was accidental.  So, we celebrate this feast of our Lord, and remember our brothers and sisters who were doing the same in the Hiroshima Cathedral when they themselves were transformed in a single instant, to see the Lord for eternity as he truly is.  May the perpetual Light, which we celebrate especially on this day, shine upon them all.  Lord hear our prayer.

      Mecandes at   urlLink Mere Catholics  feels that if we can just answer this question then we'll all be safe.  When the U.S. can truthfully answer the question, "Why does the rest of the world hate us?" -- and come up with a concrete plan of action to change that -- then, and only then, will they really be able to say, "We're safer from terrorists today than we were yesterday."  This seemed to me to be a rather simplistic way to view the problem and certainly not justified in terms of the terrorism problem. I have yet to see a time when U.S. policy has pleased all countries. Certainly, we are highly unlikely to please Muslim countries ... unless, perhaps we had a mass conversion to Islam and changed everything about our culture. I don't know about Mecandes, but I  like  being an American, however little I may approve of certain aspects of our popular culture.  In our politically correct times it is easy to forget that pleasing (or appeasing) other countries is not our purpose. Our purpose as a nation is to protect our own national interests. Hopefully we can do this while others see the logic behind our actions and without giving offense. But if not, well, c'est la vie.  Jayman at  urlLink Illuminated Obscurity  has a much more thorough and well thought out response in which he answers Mecandes (and Steve, a commenter) point by point. Here's one of my favorites.   “Against the will of the United Nations”  – I, as an American, don’t really give a damn if the U.N. doesn’t want my country to take measures to ensure the safety of not only our own people, but also the people of the Middle East. I have no confidence in an organization that, among several other problems, appoints despot leaders to enforce laws that concern crimes against humanity...

      Last night it was too hot to take a walk, even by 8:30. So we did something radical ... all four of us wound up in the living room, playing with the dogs and talking! It almost was like our own little cocktail party as conversations between the four of us wound together and split off depending on the subjects. Sometimes, we'd have to stop just to laugh at the dogs' antics playing with Tom and Hannah. All this was after a rousing game of Clue in which Rose trumped us all with an educated guess, based on Tom's wrong accusation.  Yes, we're still facing the dreariness of preparing for the school year ... skirts wait to be hemmed, supplies must be bought, that last missing school book must be found ... and there is fun planned for the future (Hannah's actual birthday party ... taking carloads of friends to see "Noises Off" in a couple of weeks). However, this was about the "here and now." It reminds us of why summer vacation is so long. Sometimes it takes months to relax and be able to enjoy the moment.

      Peter Kreeft has an interesting answer to yesterday's question. It is one of intertwined goals. Not only does it make sense, but he even makes it sound like something I'd look forward to; like a giant house party where everyone is having the most fascinating conversations. This is heavily edited to make a readable length for the blog but I highly recommend reading the whole thing for yourself in  urlLink Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Heaven, but Never Dreamed of Asking .   ... First we review our past life with divine understanding and appreciation of our past life with divine understanding and appreciation of every single experience, good and evil: we milk all our meaning dry. Then we do the same to others' lives from within. We know them more intimately and completely than we could ever know our most intimate friend on earth because we share God's knowledge of each one. When these two preliminary lessons are complete - when we know, love, understand, and appreciate completely by inner experience everything we and everyone else have ever experienced - only then we are spiritually mature enough to begin the endless and endlessly fascinating task of exploring, learning, and loving the facets of infinity, the inexhaustible nature of God.  The idea is not new, for it corresponds to three traditional doctrines: Purgatory, the Communion of Saints, and the Beatific Vision. But each is given new life by being related to the others in this sequence. Purgatory turns out be part of Heaven rather than a distinct place, and consists of moral reeducation rather than mere punishment, rehabilitation rather than retribution. The communion of Saints is rescued from a vague, philanthropic goodwill and made as interesting as human love and communion on earth; getting to know people is in one way or another the only thing we find inexhaustible here as well as there. Finally, the contemplation of God is not boring because it is done with souls matured by the first two tasks. The difference this maturing makes is as great as the difference between a dying saint and a newborn baby...

       In the past four years I have written about and given advice to both parties in this column. But a week ago, while watching the Democratic convention, I made a decision.  I am going to take three months' unpaid leave from The Wall Street Journal and attempt to support the Republican Party in the coming and crucial election. (Every four years everyone says "this is the most important election of my lifetime," but this year I believe it is true.) I'm going to give whatever advice and encouragement I have in terms of strategy, approach, message--I hate that word--and issues. No one has asked me to do this, and I do it as a volunteer, not for a salary but simply to give my time to help what I think is the more helpful side. This will take a bite out of my finances but I can do it. Actually most of us, when we die, wind up with a few thousand dollars in the bank. We should have spent it! I am going to spend mine now.  This is a very impressive commitment on Noonan's part. Read the whole story in her  urlLink WSJ column .

      Here's a common question. First of all, why do we care? Isn't it supposed to be perfect? Secondly, there's never a really satisfying sounding answer. Peter Kreeft tackles this in  urlLink Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Heaven, but Never Dreamed of Asking .  Nevertheless, though the question "What do you do?" is not primary, it is important: first, because what we do flows from and reveals what we are; second, because what we do also flows  into  what we are, helps construct our selves. Third, creative work is a primary human need, and our conventional pictures of heaven are boring partly because they do not fulfill that need. Playing harps and polishing halos is an obviously bad answer to a good question. A second answer, the more philosophical alternative of an eternity of abstract contemplation of changeless truth, moves only philosophers (and even among them only the minority). The third, biblical answer, the enjoyment of God (Psalm 27:4), is true but must be fleshed out by the imagination. The mere words "the enjoyment of God" make sense only to those who already enjoy God; the vast majority of us seem to enjoy the vast majority of things vastly more than we enjoy God. (In fact, it is only God  in  these things that we enjoy, but we do not recognize that.)  We may even fear Heaven, consciously or unconsciously, because we fear boredom. Then death is truly terrible, for it offers only the two hellish alternatives of boredom or agony. Earth seems much more interesting than Heaven because there seems to be nothing to do in Heaven. What work needs to be done in a world of eternal perfection? Yet how can we be happy without creative work?  The answer to what we'll do coming in Part II.

      Kenneth L. Woodward's Review of  THE CHURCH THAT FORGOT CHRIST by Jimmy Breslin I'm not sure I've ever read a book review as scornful as this one. Woodward finds nothing to like in this book and uses his considerable skill to spank Breslin for writing that is chock full of errors and ego. Along the way, Woodward tosses in some education on Church teachings and practices.  I won't be reading Breslin's book but the review was a delight.   Ostensibly, this is a book about the clergy abuse scandal in the Roman Catholic Church. But like everything Breslin writes, it is really about himself. Or rather, it is about him writing a book about clergy abuse. He wants us to know that he has lost faith in the church of his childhood. "I need no person wearing vestments to stand between God and me," he proclaims up front, as if that were the clergy's function. Still, he wants us to believe that writing this book has caused him considerable pain. Having been taught by nuns in grade school to believe everything the church says is true, he now finds he can believe nothing that the pope and the bishops have to say.  Who cares? Breslin has produced an incoherent rant that tells us nothing new about the abuse crisis, much that is demonstrably false and more than anyone would want to know about his loss of a very literal and childish faith.  Woodward wrote  urlLink Making Saints: How the Catholic Church Determines Who Becomes a Saint, Who Doesn't, and Why  and  that  is the book I want to read.

       urlLink THE AMAZING RACE  - WEEK FIVE Mirna continues on her downward spiral to be the most hateful person ever known, both to competitors and to her own teammate, Charla. Chip amazes us with his kind nature as he stopped to help both Brandon & Nicole and then the twins, who have tried to do him dirt more than once. The best part of this segment was watching teams move hundred pound blocks across sand in the way that ancient Egyptians did to build the pyramids.  I can't wait to see how the bowling moms do next week. They came in last but weren't eliminated. However, in a new game twist, all their money was taken from them and they won't be given any more next week. The previews showed them begging on the streets of Cairo ... my assumption as that is where they ended the game.

       urlLink THE STEPHANIE PLUM SERIES  by Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum, a laid-off lingerie buyer in Trenton, becomes a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinny. She always is in the wrong place at the right time. This makes her one of the luckiest and funniest characters to come along in a long time. Evanovich has a definite formula for these books, a mixture of serious crime fighting and 30's screwball comedy, but somehow she keeps each book fresh and funny. These books have enough suspense to keep me reading past bedtime while making me actually laugh out loud.  You know that each book will have Stephanie stubbornly pursuing a very serious criminal while filling in time tracking down a host of quirky small-time criminals. She'll be stopping by her long-suffering parents' house at least once a week for Sunday dinner ("They're hiring at the button factory, Stephanie") and taking Grandma Mazur to a viewing at Stiva's Funeral Home. Lula, an errant file clerk, has become her gun-toting side kick as the series has developed. Watching them try to take down a criminal is something like watching Abbott and Costello. One of the main suspenseful elements is watching Stephanie trying to decide between Italian cop, Joe Morelli, and exotic bounty hunter, Ranger. I have been somewhat tired by Stephanie's indecision recently. However, Evanovich seems to have put some of that to rest in the latest installment,  urlLink Ten Big Ones .  If you haven't read these, you are in for a treat. Pick up  urlLink One for the Money  and get ready for a wild and hilarious ride.

       When some priests spoke in favor of optional celibacy at a Los Angeles priest assembly last year — a position supported by most American Catholics today — Gonzalez booed in dissent. In premarital counseling, he tells couples to remain chaste until marriage, plunging into delicate territory some priests prefer to avoid.  ..."If I had 10 different lifetimes, I would choose every one to be a priest," he told the students.  Gonzalez seems to meld modernity and tradition in the same way he wears hip wraparound sunglasses with an old-fashioned cassock.  Its a long  urlLink article  but well worth reading.

      We're starting to see the comparison of abortion to slavery become more common. It makes sense. Slavery is another moral issue that only Christians cared about at first, divided families and friends, was legal until enough people put their feet down, and destroyed people in the name of "ownership." Recently I have seen it specifically mentioned in two places.  Patrick Madrid at Envoy magazine's blog,  urlLink Envoy Encore  briefly discusses Biblical principles against abortion and opens the article with this reminder.  NOT SINCE THE CIVIL WAR crisis over slavery has a controversial moral issue so divided Americans and roiled society as has abortion. The deliberate killing of an unborn child through an abortion, though currently enjoying the "legitimacy" of legality in this country (just as slavery was once also legal), is, nonetheless, a grave evil that must be opposed.  The  urlLink Mighty Barrister  dissects a recent interview of John Kerry by Peter Jennings with his usual style and pointedly makes us aware of the parallels.  There was a period of time in the life of this country when another group of human beings were not considered persons. See, for example,  Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. 393 U.S., 1856, where the Supreme Court announced that slaves were not "men" as defined in the Declaration of Independence, and were not "people" as declared in the Constitution, stating, "When the Constitution was adopted, they (blacks) were not regarded in any of the States as members of the community which constituted the State, and were not numbered among its 'people or citizens.' Consequently, the special rights and immunities guarantied to citizens do not apply to them."  You can't ignore the obvious parallels between the way the unborn are treated today, and the way Americans of African lineage were treated 150 years ago. And you can't ignore the fact that John Kerry uses practically the same language to describe the unborn as white racists used to describe blacks -- they're not "people."  This may be the startling idea that is needed to shock sense back into pro-abortion people. The same sorts of arguments were used to support slavery as to support abortion. If nothing else, these comparisons should give renewed energy to pro-life supporters. Slavery was big business and entrenched in Western civilization at one time. It was only by tenacity and sticking to what they  knew  was true in the face of any other arguments that Christians got the ball rolling for stopping slavery. We can do the same.   An excellent resource for finding out about the role of Christians in ending slavery (and other positive impacts of Christianity on our society) is  urlLink Christianity on Trial: Arguments Against Anti-Religious Bigotry  by Vincent Carroll and David Shiflett.   UPDATE: I can't believe I missed this as I am a dedicated Catholic Analysis fan but Oswald Sobrino wrote a fabulous  urlLink article  about this just yesterday. He points out all the parallels between the struggles faced by Abraham Lincoln and George Bush. Thanks to Jeff Miller for pointing this out.

      LUKE 14:15-24 The common way that people were invited to banquets in Jesus' time would be hard to handle today. It required the person to hold themselves in constant readiness on the day of the party. That in itself is an interesting commentary on how we are expected to hold ourselves ready for God.  In Palestine, when a man made a feast, the day was announced long beforehand and the invitations were sent out and accepted; but the hour was not announced; and when the day came and all things were ready, servants were sent out to summon the already invited guests. To accept the invitation beforehand and then to refuse it when the day came was a grave insult.  Something that never occurred to me is the type of excuse that the invited guests are offering for skipping the party. They can be viewed as broad categories and then it is easy to see that they are exactly the sort of reasons we give today for not leaving any time for God. In fact, one is a totally legitimate excuse but still not good enough. Nothing must get in the way of God. We have to keep the proper perspective and not let the things of the world crowd God from our lives.  The first man said that he had bought a field and was going to see it. He allowed the claims of business to usurp the claims of God. It is still possible for a man to be so immersed in this world that he has no time to worship, and even no time to pray.  The second man said that he had bought five yoke of oxen and that he was going to try them out. He let the claims of novelty usurp the claims of Christ. It often happens that when people enter into new possessions they become so taken up with them that the claims of worship and of God get crowded out ...  The third man said, with even more finality than the others, "I have married a wife and I cannot come." One of the wonderful merciful laws of the Old Testament laid it down, "when a man is newly married, he shall not go out with the army o be charged with any business; he shall be free at home one year, to be happy with his wife whom he has taken." No doubt that very law was in this man's mind. It is one of the tragedies of life when good things crowd out the claims of God. There is no lovelier thing than a home and yet a home was never meant to be used selfishly.

      ... and her cousins and my brother and a bunch of other soldiers I know who feel the same way.    urlLink Dem's Marine Misfire  ... Kerry was treating running mate Sen. John Edwards and his wife, Elizabeth, to a Wendy's lunch in Newburgh, N.Y., for their 27th wedding anniversary — an Edwards family tradition — when the candidate approached four Marines and asked them questions.  The Marines — two in uniform and two off-duty — were polite but curt while chatting with Kerry, answering most of his questions with a "yes, sir" or "no, sir."  But they turned downright nasty after the Massachusetts senator thanked them "for their service" and left.  "He imposed on us and I disagree with him coming over here shaking our hands," one Marine said, adding, "I'm 100 percent against [him]."  A sergeant with 10 years of service under his belt said, "I speak for all of us. We think that we are doing the right thing in Iraq," before saying he is to be deployed there in a few weeks and is "eager" to go and serve.  Via  urlLink The Drudge Report .

      But I guess a whole lotta others didn't get turned on by Kerry last week either. I pay little attention to political conventions because, as we tell the girls, they're preaching to the choir.  Of course,  everyone's going to get all excited.  I did see a little of Kerry's big speech (big problem, the camera does  not  love him and he isn't a scintillating speech giver) and scanned the text on the internet. My reaction was, he says we can do better but how? He didn't  tell  us anything that matters. So maybe the  urlLink Gallup survey results  shouldn't be surprising ... Kerry lost some points and Bush actually got the bounce. Interesting.  Compared with the last CNN/USA Today/Gallup survey conducted before the convention (July 19-21), this post-convention poll shows that among likely voters, Kerry's support is actually two points lower than it was pre-convention, while Bush's support is three points higher.

      Let me just say that if anyone has a chance to try a Flavor Burst Pluot they should grab it. They are well named ... the closest thing to a Sweet Tart in a crisp, fruit form that I've ever had. Ours came from the Central Market but I'd bet they can be found at places like Whole Foods also.  UPDATE: I just remembered these actually are called Flavor Grenade Pluots ... all the more reason to try one, eh?

      ... to say that our air conditioner broke last night (2 months after the warranty ran out on the compressor) thus allowing us to really get in touch with today's homily about not counting on yourself or your belongings ... but to put your trust in God. I'm gonna remember all that when we plunk down that $2,000 for the new AC that won't be ready to turn on until 2:30  tomorrow afternoon.  So I have two things to be thankful for  ... temperatures are low in Texas for this time of year (only in the 90's today)  and  we have a window unit in a hard-to-cool spot ... the spot with the TV (woohoo!) Guess where we'll be spending our time today. Thank Heaven for small favors (and I ain't kidding)!
