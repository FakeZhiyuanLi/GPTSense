						   Well, well, well! Here I am in college. Wow! I am so excited! (A little homesick, but who isn't?) So, nothing much new yet. I hope to get my books tomorrow. My roommate is awesome! Anyway, hi to hutch (cause I know you'll read this) and hi to anyone else. I miss y'all! See you at my play! Notre Dame Theater September 4th 7:30pm $7/ticket (steep, yes, but worth it? I think so! Hey, who could miss an opportunity to see me? hee hee hee!) Classes start next week! Oh, you know what's such a bummer? The wireless internet does not work in the dorms! Stupid money grubbing companies!!!!!! Blah. Oh well. I can always use the lab or chill in the library. S'all well and good. So, until next time, spay or neuter your pets! (j/k!) Night all!

						   I just do not know what to do. I want to go to college, but I feel so empty inside. Why?

						   I'm off to college in 3 days and any slow, emotional song makes me start sobbing (example: Immortal by Evanescence). I'm gonna miss everyone, but as I wrote in one of my poems (see below) this is not farewell. . .  Alone with my thoughts Pondering out goodbye One embrace A long gaze Few words in hushed tones Do not cry, you tell yourself Walk away Look back once more But you are gone.  Tears flow freely now The soft rain mingles with them How fitting The heavens are crying with me Feeling my pain This is not farewell We will meet again But it feels like forever Until then, I will hold it in And cry when I am Alone with my thoughts

						   Artist: Terri Clark Song: Girls Lie Too  Lyrics :  So she can’t go out tonight again Her sister’s sick, she’s gotta baby-sit Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good excuse  Now you didn’t hear any of this from me But things aren’t always what they seem Brace yourself, this may come as a shock to you  Girls lie, too We don’t care how much money you make What you drive or what you weigh Size don’t matter anyway Girls lie, too Don’t think you’re the only ones Who bend it, break it, stretch it some We learn from you Girls lie, too  We can’t wait to hear about your round of golf We love to see deer heads hanging on the wall And we like Hooter’s for their hotwings too Other guys never cross our minds We don’t wonder what it might be like How could it be any better than it is with you  (Repeat Chorus)  Yeah, girls lie, too We always forgive and forget The cards and flowers you never sent Will never be brought up again Girls lie, too Old gray sweatpants turn us on We like your friends and we love your mom And that's the truth Girls lie, too Yeah that’s the truth Girls lie, too  [No, we don’t care how much hair you have Yeah, that looks good Comb it over like that...  Talk amongst yourselves. This is a good song and very true.

						   So, here I am just sitting here. I think it was just a bad day yesterday. Anywho, I finally got ammo and caps for my new .50 cal black powder rifle! wOOt! (Oh I guess I better explain. See, I shoot competitivly, or used to, anyway, I asked my dad for a .50 cal black powder rifle for graduation and I got it!) So tonite I get to go to the range and try it out! I also have to coach one of my fellow ventures in her shooting requirement for ranger. She's never shot before so it might be a challenge, but we'll see. Until next time.

						   I dunno, maybe it's me. I guess it's easier to blame myself but geez-us! Can't I just be left alone? Ever since like last week, it's been hella tense in our house. I know it is because I'm leaving for college in a week, but I can't take it anymore! I want to just pull out my hair and run screaming throught the streets! I need to hit something! Grrrrrrr! I can't take it! I try and I try, but nothing seems to please them! Then they yell for not helping out. What am I, a fucking mind reader????!!!?!?!?! I don't know what they are thinking! If you want help you better damn well ask instead of being such a pain in the ass! I think it is time for me to leave. Yes, it is about time for me to prove to them that I can manage on my own because I know I can! I know I can! Another thing is my dad is really getting to me. I do love him more than any one in the world, but he's trying to get me to choose sides in this so-called stupid "IC/Venture War" that is currently brewing. I don't think he is trying to intentionally, but enough is enough! I don't want to pick a side. I don't care. I am not pro-Venture. I am not anti-IC. I am neutral! Whatever beliefs I have are mine. I can have my opinions and frankly this is all petty rivary. It is bull shit! Who cares where the older boys go? Let them decide, but don't go bashing one organization in hopes that the boy will join the other! We are a partnership. If the ICs would just open their narrow minds (generalization, yes, but easier) they could find a very resourceful ally! Oh well. I have a headache and I don't want to talk about this anymore. Until next time.

						   I was standing at a window of a dark, musty tavern. As I looked out, I saw a woman, clad in black, embracing a man. He was passionately kissing her neck. She looked up at me and smiled. Then, grasping his head in her hands, sank her teeth into his neck. My throat closed, but could not back away. When she was finished, he fell to the ground, chest heaving, mouth gasping for air. She stepped over his body and retrieved her long, leather trench coat. She slipped it on and glanced back at me. Then she disappeared. I waited a moment then went out to find my own victim.  I walked out into the dark night and began my hunt. The town was still. Every so often I could hear the sounds of parties, the music, the talking. I came to the end of a block and around the corner came stumbling a drunk mortal. "Hey Baby." he slurred. I raised a brow as he came towards me. I turned and went down a nearby alleyway. As predicted, he followed. "Hey, slow down." he laughed. I looked back at him and before he knew what was happening, I was on him.  He cried out in pain as I sunk my razor sharp teeth into his neck. The blood filled my mouth and coursed through my veins. Bliss. Shear bliss. His body began to go limp and I had to hold him up. When I could drink no more, I gasped in air and let his drained body whither to the ground. My adrenaline was rising. I pushed off the pavement and climbed up the brick wall of the alley. I landed on the roof. Looking back, I could still see him there, motionless. He had ceased living so I could live on. Three hours to sunrise. I must find a place to rest. Vaulting from building to building, I swiftly made my way back into the night.  “You like to play with fire.” My sire sat in an armchair in the old parlor. “Yes, but I have enough sense not to get burnt.” I knelt in front of him. He stared at the antique scroll wallpaper that was beginning to peel, “Anything interesting tonight?” “Nothing of grave importance. Did you feed?”  “Yes.” Nothing more was said. I rose and went to the next room where the caskets were. I opened mine and lay back on the plush lining. I waited until I heard my sire move into his and close down the lid. Only then did I close mine and begin my sleep. Right as the sun began to rise.  Night came all too quickly. I pushed open the lid of my casket to find my sire waiting for me. "We are going to visit an old friend of mine." He turned and began to exit the room. I jumped up and followed. We went to a rarely travelled part of London. I had never been there before. Even on my nightly feeds, I never came into this part of town. I glanced around as I trailed my sire. He walked with urgency and confidence. Soon, we came to a small corner pub. We went inside and straight to a secluded table near the back. "Hello old friend." The voice came from a man sitting there, "Who is this?" "My fledgling." He looked to me, "My dear, this is my sire, Lestat.”  Lestat. That name resounded in my ears. I knew who he was. The infamous vampire Lestat. I had heard about his performance in Death Valley that resulted in the deaths of so many vampires. “A pretty thing.” Lestat studied me, “You have done well in choosing a companion Louis.”
