      We are sometimes a victim of our own success & sales growth in the UK at this time is significant. Managing and sustaining this growth is of the upmost importance, but how to do it and be able to manage customer expectations  etc..?  You can force greater responsibility on your field sales team, getting them more and more involved in the sales handover, producing a bit of a  project plan, managing the customer after the sale. This in my view is a problem. Salesmen that do exactly what they say on the tin (Close Business) are, in my opinion, not even slightly interested in any kind of admin work, and the last thing we need is a de-motivated successful salesman. Give them opportunities, opportunities, opportunities!  Therefore we're going to create a formal Sales Administration role, a job function which has been informally done by a number of people, but now the number of orders is reaching  a point where someone needs to own that role and take responsibility for it (While also working to do the sales related tasks not really admired by our besuited sales execs).  On a more interesting note, a trip to the Cinema last night was a great evening - Van Helsing - totally over the top horror flick, which didn't take itself too seriously - great fun and thoroughly recommended if you're into that kind of thing.

      AlphaCAM Insights is a quick view into the world of CAD/CAM, and software development.  I work for Licom Systems -  urlLink http://www.licom.com  Licom are a world wide player in the CAM marketplace, we supply software which powers many types of CNC cutting machines for applications such as   Milling Routing Laser Waterjet Wire EDM Lathe Stonecutting  As well as producing several production automation solutions for our customer base.   My role at Licom is operations Manager, which basically involves everything which is not:  Finance & Accounting Development / R & D Sales  Although being an experienced software developer myself, I do from time to time get involved in development, and have also been known to get involved in sales meetings from time to time (mainly to nag and moan about procedures).  The main objectives of this Blog is to act as an ongoing diary for myself, perhaps make a little social commentary while hopefully giving a little insight into how Licom work, and to maintain a bit of history for how things are developing here.  Anyone interested Licom and would like further information on anything in these Blogs in particular, please do not hesitate to drop me a line. I guess the key to these things is to keep them going as regularly as possible, so hopefully this is the first of many.  Chris.
