      i didn't think i'd feel this way about someone so soon after my last relationship. to be honest i didn't think i'd ever feel this way again. but i do. ever since we met  b  has been, and continues to be a constant surprise, and my feelings for him are proving to be the same.

      i recently heard that  lemur  is getting married, this news has received mixed reviews by the old crew from our days in university. most reactions have been rather cynical given  lemurs  track record, but it has also made me wonder if perhaps we are too hard on each other. we have all known for years what  lemur  is like but have chosen to remain in contact with her despite her flighty nature. should we just stop kidding ourselves and call it quits? or should we stop being so uppity and start accepting our friends for who they are?

      ok so the wurst site brought back memories of a song i learned in public school, i managed to find the lyrics (oh internet how do i love thee, let me count the ways 01010011110111000000100011100) anyhow here goes:  There was a fat old Dutch man, his name was Gunderback He like to eat his sausages with sauerkraut and fat He openened up a sausage store the finest ever seen He named it and patentened it the Gunderback machine     Oh Gunderback oh Gunderback how could you be so mean To ever have invented such a horrible machine Oh pussy cats and long tailed rats are never more to be seen Their all ground up to sausage meat in Gunderbacks machine     One day a little Dutch boy came walking in the shop He ordered up some sausages and half a case of pop While waiting for his order he whistled up a tune And all the little sausages came dancing 'round the room    Chorus    Well late one night it happened, the machine it would not go So Gunderback he crawled inside the reason for to know His wife while having a nightmare was walking in her sleep She gave the crank a heck of a yank and Gunderback was meat    Chorus

      so i found out today that my  ex  is still keeping in touch with my best friend (and a previous ex)  trouble . i guess  the ex  found an x-men comic (v. punny)that was written by an author he thought  trouble  would be interested in, so  the ex  put it in inter-office mail, even though he only works one floor down from trouble and i. at first it just seemed odd that  the ex  wouldn't just walk up a flight of stairs and give the comic to  trouble  himself, but now i'm finding it odd that  the ex  would talk to  trouble  at all, it's not like they were ever close.  so there are two interpretations of the above situation:  1.  the ex  was just being nice, and figured it wouldn't be a big deal to contact  trouble , but still had to be a bit weird to maintain his rep. of being neurotic and strange, so he sent it through inter-office mail to go up one floor.  2.  the ex  is looking for ways to insinuate himself into my life, and is using trouble to do it.  i'm not entirely sure what to think of it. i guess it bothers me more than i'd like to admit b/c i just want to put that entire segment of my life behind me and having him seemingly try to maintain a bond with trouble throws a bit of a wrench into that plan.

      so the other day my boss came into my cube and told me that they are thinking of reclassifying my job, which would significantly increase my annual salary. aaarrggghh! why is it that every time i'm ready to move to toronto, something comes along that makes it more difficult?!

      i thought i was dealing with this better, but after going to a wedding with  b &nbsp;this weekend, perhaps i am not.   we ended up missing the ceremony because  b  was meeting my p-units for the first time.&nbsp;we got to the reception and everything seemed to be going well, i was getting along with everyone, despite never having met them before, and during the speeches when when people were talking about the happy couple  b  and i held hands and were being cute.   then it came time for the boquet toss.   the last thing i wanted to do was get up and try to catch the damn thing b/c i'm in the middle of a divorce and felt like i didn't really belong up there with all the single ladies so i didn't get up. then  b  turns to me and says 'go up', so i made an excuse, told him 'it should be one of the couples friends that catches it', i didn't really want to bring up le divorce at a wedding esp in front of a bunch of  bs  friends who don't know. then everyone else at the table starts in on me. so i went up and hid at the back of the group praying&nbsp;i wouldn't get hit in the head with the symbol of&nbsp;impending matrimony. afterward  b  commented on my standing in the back, i again restated my excuse. oh well it was over.   and then came the garter toss.    b  was playin around with the other single guys while waiting for the groom to remove the metaphor from the bride's thigh. and then it was tossed,  b  was front and centre, and litterally jumped for it, guess that's what i get for dating a volley ball player&nbsp;he caught it mid-air. so of course the mc points me out as the lucky lady there with  b .   i felt awful. on the one hand i was really uncomfortable, i know it's only a silly ritual that means nothing, but i'm really not in a place where i can even joke around about getting married again, let alone have it right in front of me. but a part of me also feels like i'm ruining it for  b , this is his first serious relationship and i feel like my issues darken the feelings for him.   &nbsp;

      last night at the mall i decided it was time to get a new bra, or five. given that i have lost 26 pounds since i last went bra shopping i figured i should get measured first. so rather than have a strange department store denizen do it for me i figured i'd ask how one measured oneself for bra size, go home and measure and return another day. according to her method of measuring from the nipple to the base i am a C cup, this perplexes me as i currently wear a B cup, and it's.... well lets just say i'm not exactly 'busting' out of it.  so today, thanks to the internet i have been trying to find an accurate method of measurement.  1) Victoria's secret (they know what they're doing right?)   Band Size:   Using a soft tape-measure, measure around the ribcage directly under the bust. The tape should rest on the lower band of your bra. Be sure the tape is snug, smooth across the back and level with the front. Add 5 to this measurement to obtain your band size. For example, if your ribcage measurement is 29" + (5) = 34" band size. If the resulting band size is an odd number like 33", you can usually go to the next even band size (34"), but you may also want to try the next lower band size (32").   ok that's a 31 for me plus 5 = 36   Cup Size   Measure completely around the bust at the fullest point, holding the tape measure straight but not tight. The difference between this measurement and your BAND size is your cup size. Each inch of difference is equal to one cup size. For example, if your band size is 34" and your bust measurement is 35", you wear an "A" cup.     ok that's a 35 minus 36 wait a minute.... -1 ?! how can i have negative boobs?  on to the next method  2)  urlLink http://www.afraidtoask.com/breast/breastmeasuringcup.html   excellent i just plug in my numbers and out comes.... 36C ?! again currently in a 34B that has a little extra living space  3) courtesy of  urlLink http://www.fittingtips.com      Taking the Proper Measurements To determine your bra size you will need to take three measurements. Put on the best fitting bra you own. If necessary pin the straps up to bring the breasts to the correct level. The diagrams to not show a bra so you can see exactly where to take the measurements    1: Under Bust . Hold the tape snugly, but not tight and take the circumference under the bust. Add either 4" or 5" to this measurement to make it an even number.  Under Bust Measurement Plus 4" if Upper Bust is an even number Plus 5" if Upper Bust is an odd number 36 = Band Size    2: Upper Bust. Measure the circumference above the bust under the arms. 34  3: Full Bust. Measure the full bust circumference. Do not let the tape droop in back. You may need help to take this measurement correctly.  35  Determine the difference between Measurement 2, the upper bust, and Measurement 3, the full bust. 3: Full Bust: 35  2: Upper Bust: 34  Difference: 1    This chart determines the cup size using the difference between the Full Bust Measurement and the Upper Bust Measurement. Difference Equals Cup Size Less than 1 inch AA, 1"A, 2"B, 3"C, 4"D     ok so according to this i'm an A36  time to go shopping!
