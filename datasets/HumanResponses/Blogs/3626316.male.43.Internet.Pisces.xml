						   As quoted to me by a friend:  Calling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable because no matter how  legitimate my illness, I always sense my boss thinks I am lying. On one  occasion, I had a valid reason but lied anyway because the truth was too  humiliating to reveal. I simply mentioned that I had sustained a head injury  and I hoped I would feel up to coming in the next day. By then, I could  think up a dozy to explain the bandage on my crown. In this case, the truth  hurt.   I mean it really hurt in the place men feel the most pain. The accident  occurred mainly because I conceded to my wife's wishes to adopt a cute  little kitty. As the daily routine prescribes, I was taking my shower after  breakfast when I heard my wife, Deb, call out to me from the kitchen. "Ed!"  she hearkened. "The garbage disposal is dead. Come reset it." "You know  where the button is." I protested through the shower pitter-patter. "Reset  it yourself!" "I am scared!" She pleaded. "What if it starts going and sucks  me in?" Pause. "C'mon, it'll only take a second." No logical assurance about  how a disposal can't start itself will calm the fears of a person who  suffers from "Big-ol- scary-machinephobia," a condition brought on by  watching too many Stephen King movies.   It is futile to argue or explain. And if a poltergeist did, in fact, possess  the disposal, and she was ground into round, I'd have to live with that the  rest of my life. So out I came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping to make  a statement about how her cowardly behavior was not without consequence but  it was I who would suffer.   I crouched down and stuck my head under the sink to find the button. It is  the last action I remember performing. It struck without warning, without  respect to my circumstances. Nay, it wasn't a hexed disposal, drawing me  into its gnashing metal teeth. it was our new kitty, clawing playfully at  the dangling objects she spied between my legs. She ("Buttons" aka "the  Grater) had been poised around the corner and stalked me as I took the bait  under the sink. At precisely the second I was most vulnerable, she leapt at  the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged them with her needle-like claws.  Now when men feel pain or even sense danger anywhere close to their  masculine region, they lose all rational thought to control orderly bodily  movements. Instinctively, their nerves compel the body to contort inwardly,  while rising upwardly at a violent rate of speed. Not even a well trained  monk could calmly stand with his groin supporting the full weight of a  kitten and rectify the situation in a step-by-step procedure. Wild animals  are sometimes faced with a "fight or flight" syndrome; men, in this  predicament, choose only the "flight" option.   Fleeing straight up, I knew at that moment how a cat feels when it is  alarmed. It was a dismal irony. But, whereas cats seek great heights to  escape, I never made it that far. The sink and cabinet bluntly impeded my  ascent; the impact knocked me out cold. When I awoke, my wife and the  paramedics stood over me. Having been fully briefed by my wife, the  paramedics snorted as they tried to conduct their work while suppressing  their hysterical laughter. My wife told me I should be flattered. At the  office, colleagues tried to coax an explanation out of me. I kept silent,  claiming it was too painful to talk. "What's the matter, cat got your  tongue?" If they had only known.

						   So the stats prove that a litte advertising actually does help. What a major drop-off of traffic! Mind you I am not confusing traffic with sales, but I do feel better knowing someone IS coming to my web site versus it going un-noticed. So I turned Google back on since it seems to be less of a drain and I am looking at working with one of the options on B2Central.  I am open to suggestions on ranking better on search engines and getting more advertising bang for my buck. If you have any suggestions, ideas or thoughts feel free to e:mal me: at presents4pet(@)softhome.net (remove the brackets from around the @ symbol.  Anyway, we have a chace to advertise in a Dog Travel Magazine and are looking itno the pet magazines also, such as Cat Fancy, Cats & Kittens, Dog Fancy and the like.  One of these will lead to opening the right door to make this thing take on a life of it's own.

						   Well, I decided to test a theory tonight by shutting off all advertising. Google adwords, overture, etc. I am curious to find out if that is bringing in the lookie-loos only and if traffic will drop off to an extreme or if I am listed in the search engines enough on my own to sustain traffic. Mind you, I don't equate traffic with customers. Not yet at least... Since we have just opened up I think the majority of our traffic is curiosity seekers not valid customers actually looking to make a purchase.  I am seeking a means to bringing in paying traffic versus people just browsing, I have yet to come up with a unique way.. Though I am leaning towards having a contest to attract people versus paying for the advertising. Adwords seems to be draining my money but not as fast as overture and neither one is bringing in paying traffic. Granted I have to have patience as I stated in an earlier post but when it comes to spending money that is easier said than done.  What to do? Originally I was happy with the way the site looked but now I am feeling like it is just not friendly and inviting enough. Do I need to save some money up and have a site done professionals? Is that what it needs> I mean I have unique products and that IS a plus and drawing power right there... But like they say it isn't "...If you build it they will come." any more. Those days are over.  I am not about to quit and I guess I am in the same position a person just starting a diet is in... At first, you notice a big change and then you level off and don't see much happening. And I think I am at the leveling off stage, so I need to sit tight and let things ride.  We will see if there is any noticeable change in traffic by tomorrow at this time!

						   Last year I discovered a website for networking, in the old sense of the word. Nothing to do with computers, except you need one to get to the site, but meeting and greeting new people.  Originally, I got started to help promote my business, as it was originally, the pet gift baskets, also to get information on, for and about how to better it. Even if you don't have a business I say you should drop by because there are a lot of good things going on there.  Thinking about going into business? Like to write blogs or ezines? Are you a WAH (work at home) person? Like animals or just like to meet other people? Then Ryze  ( www.ryze.com )is the place!  If you own a business and want and want to get help, suggestions and information, I suggest also visiting Business Owners Idea Cafe ( www.businessownersideacafe.com ) you will meet other's in the same situation as you and your business or those that have been there and done that. Another place with lot's of information available to help you better your business.

						   I am doing what I can to get some attention to our web site and so I wrote a press release. If this is something you wish to do you can do it also for free at  urlLink   It simple to do and since it doesn't cost a thing then it should be a must!  So I posted my little pr piece on the site and actually got picked up by Doggie News!  urlLink   It isn't much and probably few will see it but it is a step forward.  Adwords and pay-per-clicks are bringing in traffic but not many are buying. With little money I have to do what it takes for trying to get the buying publics attention. I have done a gazillion free submit sites and will do almost anything to try and get my business up and on it's own two feet. Believe me, anything, except for banner exchanges and the like.  I know it's not high prices nor have the same thing as every other site out there! I am trying to be realistic and not get impatient, I need to understand that it can take a couple of three months for the looky-loos to come back and actually buy one they have been to the site. So I will bide my time.  Good thing about all this is I do have another job I can survive on. Bad thing is I do have another job!

						   (In no way do I encourage nor endorse any of this. It is purely for reasons of humor that I post this.)                      How to Give a Cat a Bath    1. Know that although the kitty cat has the advantage of quickness and lack of concern for human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize on that advantage by selecting the battlefield. Don't try to bathe him in an open area where he can force you to chase him. Pick a very small bathroom. If your bathroom is more than four feet square, we recommend that you get in the tub with the cat and close the sliding-glass doors as if you were about to take a shower. (A simple shower curtain will not do. A berserk cat can shred a three-ply rubber shower curtain quicker than a politician can shift positions.)     2. Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the skin from your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and know how to dress to protect yourself. We recommend canvas overalls tucked into high-top construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army helmet, a hockey face-mask, and a long-sleeved flak jacket.    3. Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if to simply carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not usually notice your strange attire. They have little or no interest in fashion as a rule.)     4. Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival. In a single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub enclosure, slide the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt him with shampoo. You have now begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life.     5. Cats have no handles. Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and the problem is radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him for more than two or three seconds at a time. When you have him, however, you must remember to give him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy. He'll then spring free and fall back into the water, thereby rinsing himself off. (The national record for cats is three latherings, so don't expect too much.)     6. Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always  assume this part will be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this point and the cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the drying is simple compared with what you have just been through. That's because by now the cat is semi-permanently affixed to your right leg.     You simply pop the drain plug with your foot, reach for your towel and wait. (Occasionally, however, the cat will end up clinging to the top of your army helmet. If this happens, the best thing you can do is to shake him loose and to encourage him toward your leg.) After all the water is drained from the tub, it is a simple matter to just reach down and dry the cat.     In a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg. He will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend a lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become psychoceramic and develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine.     You will be tempted to assume he is angry. This isn't usually the case. As a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your defenses and injure you for life the next time you decide to give him a bath. But at least now he smells a lot better.

						   1 - Law of Cat Inertia A cat at rest will tend to remain at rest, unless acted upon by some outside force - such as the opening of cat food, or a nearby scurrying mouse.  2 - Law of Cat Motion A cat will move in a straight line, unless there is a really good reason to change direction.   3 - Law of Cat Magnetism All blue blazers and black sweaters attract cat hair in direct proportion to the darkness of the fabric.   4 - Law of Cat Thermodynamics Heat flows from a warmer to a cooler body, except in the case of a cat, in which case all heat flows to the cat.   5 - Law of Cat Stretching A cat will stretch to a distance proportional to the length of the nap just taken.   6 - Law of Cat Sleeping All cats must sleep with people whenever possible, in a position as uncomfortable for the people involved as is possible for the cat.   7 - Law of Cat Elongation A cat can make her body long enough to reach just about any counter top that has anything remotely interesting on it.   8 - Law of Cat Acceleration A cat will accelerate at a constant rate, until he gets good and ready to stop.   9 - Law of Dinner Table Attendance Cats must attend all meals when anything good is served.   10 - Law of Rug Configuration No rug may remain in its naturally flat state for very long.   11 - Law of Obedience Resistance A cat's resistance varies in proportion to a human's desire for her to do something.   12 - First Law of Energy Conservation Cats know that energy can neither be created nor destroyed and will, therefore, use as little energy as possible.   13 - Second Law of Energy Conservation Cats also know that energy can only be stored by a lot of napping.   14 - Law of Refrigerator Observation If a cat watches a refrigerator long enough, someone will come along and take out something good to eat.   15 - Law of Electric Blanket Attraction Turn on an electric blanket and a cat will jump into bed at the speed of light.   16 - Law of Random Comfort Seeking A cat will always seek, and usually take over, the most comfortable spot in any given room.   17 - Law of Bag / Box Occupancy All bags and boxes in a given room must contain a cat within the earliest possible nanosecond.   18 - Law of Cat Embarrassment A cat's irritation rises in direct proportion to her embarrassment times the amount of human laughter.   19 - Law of Milk Consumption A cat will drink his weight in milk, squared, just to show you he can.   20 - Law of Furniture Replacement A cat's desire to scratch furniture is directly proportional to the cost of the furniture.   21 - Law of Cat Landing A cat will always land in the softest place possible.   22 - Law of Fluid Displacement A cat immersed in milk will displace her own volume, minus the amount of milk consumed.   23 - Law of Cat Disinterest A cat's interest level will vary in inverse proportion to the amount of effort a human expends in trying to interest him.   24 - Law of Pill Rejection Any pill given to a cat has the potential energy to reach escape velocity.   25 - Law of Cat Composition A cat is composed of Matter + Anti-Matter + It Doesn't Matter.

						   When I say to move, it means go someplace else, not switch positions with each other so there are still two of you in the way.  The dishes with the paw prints are yours and contain your food. The other dishes are mine and contain my food. (Please note, placing a paw print in the middle of my plate & food does not stake a claim for it becoming your food & dish, nor do I find that aesthetically pleasing in the slightest.)  The stairway was not designed by NASCAR and is not a racetrack. Beating me to the bottom is not the object. Tripping me doesn't help because I fall faster than you can run.  I cannot buy anything bigger than a king size bed. I am very sorry about this. Do not think I will continue to sleep on the couch to ensure your comfort. Look at videos of dogs and cats sleeping. They can actually curl up in a ball. It is not necessary to sleep perpendicular to each other stretched out to the fullest extent possible (I also know that sticking tails straight out and having tongues hanging out the other end to maximize space used is nothing but sarcasm.)  My compact discs are not miniature! Frisbee s.  For the last time, there is not a secret exit from the bathroom. If by some miracle I beat you there and manage to get the door shut, it is not necessary to claw, whine, meow, try to turn the knob, or get your paw under the edge and try to pull the door open. I must exit through the same door I entered. (In addition, I have been using the bathroom for years...canine or feline attendance is not mandatory.)  The proper order is kiss me, then go smell the other dogs or cats' butt. I cannot stress this enough. It would be such a simple change for you.  To pacify you I have posted the following message on our front door.....  Rules for Non-pet owners who visit and like to complain about our pets:  1. They live here; you don't.  2 If you don't want their hair on your clothes, stay off the furniture.  3. I like my pet better than I like most people.  4. To you it's an animal. To me he and/or she is an adopted son and/or daughter who is short, hairy, walks on all fours and is speech challenged.  Dogs and cats are better than kids. They eat less, don't ask for money all the time, are easier to train, usually come when called, never drive your car, don't hang out with drug using friends, don't drink or smoke, don't worry about buying the latest fashions, don't wear your clothes, don't need a gazillion dollars for college, and if they get pregnant, you can sell the results.

						   1: If you have to throw up, get into a chair quickly. If you cannot manage this in time, get to an Oriental rug. Shag is good.  2: Determine quickly which guest hates cats. Sit on that lap during the evening. He won't dare push you off and will even call you "nice kitty." If you can arrange to have cat food on your breath, so much the better.   3: For sitting on laps or rubbing against trouser legs, select colors which contrast with your own.   4: Always accompany guests to the bathroom. It is not necessary to do anything. Just sit and stare.   5: For guests who say, "I love kitties," be ready with aloof disdain, claws applied to stockings or a quick nip on the ankles.   6: Do not allow closed doors in any room. To get one open, stand on hind legs and hammer with forepaws. Once the door is opened for you, it is not necessary to use it. You can change your mind. When you have ordered an outside door opened, stand half in and half out and think about several things. This is particularly important during very cold weather or mosquito season.   7: If one person is busy and the other is idle, sit with the busy one. For book readers, get in close under the chin, unless you can lie across the book itself.   8: For ladies knitting, curl quietly into lap and pretend to doze. Then reach out and slap knitting needles sharply. This is what she calls a dropped stitch. She will try to distract you. Ignore it.   9: For people doing homework, sit on the paper being worked on. After being removed for the second time, push anything movable off the table -- pens, pencils, stamps -- one at a time.   10: Get enough sleep during the daytime so that you are fresh for playing at night between 2 and 4 a.m.

						   1. First .... dress for the occasion. A 4-ply rubber wet suit is suggested, along with a helmet, face mask and welders gloves.  2. A Bathtub with a glass enclosure is preferred to the one with a shower curtain. A frenzied cat can shred one of these in about 2.5 seconds.  3. Have the Kitty Bubbles and towel in the enclosed bathtub area before hand. No ... blow drying the cat after the bath is not suggested.  4. Draw the water, making it a little warmer than needed as you still need to find the cat. Position everything strategically in the shower, so you can reach it even if you are face down or prone in the tub.  5. Find your cat. Use the element of surprise. Pick the cat up, nonchalantly as if you were simply carrying him/her to the supper dish. No need to worry about the cat noticing your strange attire... the cat barely notices you anyway.  6. Once you and the cat are inside the bathroom ... speed is essential. In one single liquid motion shut the door to the bathroom, step into the shower, close the sliding doors, and drop the cat into the water. While the cat is still in a state of shock, locate the Kitty Bubbles and squirt whatever part of him is above the water line. You have just begun the wildest 45 seconds of your life. Remember that cats have no handles and add the fact that he now has soapy fur. His state of shock has worn off and he's madder than a wet hornet.  7. As best, you can, wearing welder's gloves, try to field his body as he catapults through the air toward the ceiling. If possible, give another squirt of Kitty Bubbles with his body now fully exposed.  8. During the 5 seconds you are able to hold onto him, rub vigorously. No need to worry about rinsing. As he slide down the glass enclosure into the tub, he will fall back into the water, rinsing himself in the process.  9. Only attempt the lather and rinse process about 3 times. The cat will realize the lack of traction on the glass by then and will use the next attempt on the first available part of you.  10. Next, the cat must be dried. No...this is NOT the easiest part. By this stage, you are worn out and the cat has just become semi-permanently affixed to your right leg. We suggest here that you drain the tub and in full view of your cat  reach for the bottle of Kitty Bubbles.  11. If you have done step 10 correctly, the cat will be off your leg and hanging precariously from your helmet. Although this view of the cat is most disgusting, he will be in a much better position for wrapping the towel around him.  12. Be sure cat is firmly wrapped in towel before opening tub enclosure. Open bathroom door ... put towel wrapped cat on floor and step back quickly. Into tub, if possible, and do not open enclosure until all you can see is the shredded towel.  13. In about 2 hours .... it will be safe to exit the bathroom. Your cat will be sitting out there somewhere looking like a small hedgehog while plotting revenge.

						   If you have been here before you will see a change. We had another logo created for us. Professionallyn this time, worth every bit of what we paid! What did we pay? $50.00! What did we get? We got web and print ready logo, black and white logo for faxes and trademarking and an EPS file the logo came in small, medium and regular jpg and tif file. Not bad for that amount. They did it quick and painless.  For the money they give you up to four choices you can pick on and then have 1 free re-adjustment made. Every adjustment after is only $10.00. They actually did not charge us $10 and gave us the second adjustment free.  So I am here to sing the praises of this Company, though they are located in the UK don't be hesitant about using their services, they were prompt, professional and very good.  So take a bow The Logo Company http://thelogocompany.net/logo-design-example.htm you did great work. I have yet to hear one negative comment about it and that is saying something. Our past logo's have drawn some criticism but mainly the clarity of them.   If you need a logo done and cheaply. You get more than your money's worth from these people.   So post your comments about our logo... tell me what you think!
