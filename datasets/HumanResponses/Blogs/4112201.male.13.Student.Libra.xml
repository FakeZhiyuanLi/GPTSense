      인천공항에서 에어차이나 의 비행기를 탄지 2시간후 우리는 북경에 도착했다.   입국심사를 받기전에 비자가 그룹비자인 관계로 모두 비자에 써있는 순서되로 줄을 섯다. (한국에서 출국심사 받을때는 순서되로 줄안서도 됫었는데;)   여기가 입국심사를 하는 곳이다. 자리에 앉아있는 아저씨의 얼굴이 너무 무서웠었다.   짐을 챙기고나서 없어진 짐이 있어서 1~2시간 동안 서서 기다렸었다. 계속 번호를 확인하더니 분실신고를 하고 드디어 출발이다! 밖으로 나가기 위해서(버스를 타기위해) 에스칼레이터를 타고 올라왔다.   에스칼레이터를 타고 올라오자 마자 보이는 기아차의 광고 저차를 어떻게 가져다가 놨는지가 의문이다.   밖으로 나와서 버스를 타기위해 주차장으로 가는 육교를 건너다가 찍은 사진이다. 빨간색의 자동차가 중국의 택시이다. 요즘에는 중국의 택시는 거의다 소나타라고 한다.   버스를 타고 무심코 밖을 내다봤을때 있었던 건물.. 아마도 외교부 건물이었었던것 같다. 하지만 중국에는 전부 건물이 이정도 였었던것 같다. (중국의 신동아백화점(?동아백화점 이었나? 아무튼 우리나라 백화점은 아니었다.) 만 하더라도 현대백화점 3~4개 정도를 합쳐놓은 크기였다.(실제로 다리까지 있었다.) 중국에서 신세계 백화점이 고급백화점이라고 하던데 그건 도로에 육교를 설치해서 백화점을 서로 연결하고 있을만큼 컸었다) 그리고 버스정류장도 한꺼번에 3개가 있었고, 제일 많이 보이는 광고가 LG전자 광고였다.  그후 중민대하 라는 4성 호텔에 들어가서 잠을 잤다.

         urlLink               Koreans have developed and use a unique alphabet called Hangeul. It            is considered to be one of the most efficient alphabets in the world            and has garnered unanimous praise from language experts for its scientific            design and excellence.                         Hangeul was created under King Sejong during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910).            In 1446, the first Korean alphabet was proclaimed under the name Hunminjeongeum,            which literally meant "the Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the            People."                         King Sejong, the motivating force behind Hangeul, is considered to be            one of the greatest rulers in the history of Korea. Highly respected            for his benevolent disposition and diligence, King Sejong was also a            passionate scholar whose knowledge and natural talent in all fields            of study astounded even the most learned experts.                          urlLink               When King Sejong was not performing his official duties, he enjoyed            reading and meditating. He could also be very tenacious at times and            would never yield on what he thought was right. Love for the people            was the cornerstone of his reign (1418-1450), and he was always ready            to listen to the voices of the common folk. He was a ruler of virtue,            with the welfare of the people dictating all policy formulations.                         King Sejong also established the Jiphyeonjeon, an academic research            institute, inside the palace. Noted scholars from all academic disciplines            gathered here to engage in lively discussions and also to publish a            variety of scholarly books.                          urlLink               During his reign, King Sejong always deplored the fact that the common            people, ignorant of the complicated Chinese characters that were being            used by the educated, were not able to read and write. He understood            their frustration in not being able to read or to communicate their            thoughts and feelings in written words.                          urlLink               The Chinese script was used by the intelligentsia of the country, but            being of foreign origin, it could not fully express the words and meaning            of Korean thoughts and spoken language. Therefore, common people with            legitimate complaints had no way of submitting their grievances to the            appropriate authorities, other than through oral communication, and            they had no way to record for posterity the agricultural wisdom and            knowledge they had gained through years of experience.                         King Sejong felt great sympathy for the people. As a wise ruler strongly            dedicated to national identity and cultural independence, he immediately            searched for solutions. What he envisioned was an alphabet that was            uniquely Korean and easily learnable, rendering it accessible and usable            for the common people.                          urlLink                Thus, the Hunminjeongeum was born. In the preface of its proclamation,            King Sejong states as follows:                         "Being of foreign origin, Chinese characters are incapable of capturing            uniquely Korean meanings. Therefore, many common people have no way            to express their thoughts and feelings. Out of my sympathy for their            difficulties, I have invented a set of 28 letters. The letters are very            easy to learn, and it is my fervent hope that they improve the quality            of life of all people." The statement captures the essence of King Sejong's            determination and dedication to cultural independence and commitment            to the welfare of the people.                         When first proclaimed by King Sejong, Hunminjeongeum had 28 letters            in all, of which only 24 are in use today. The 24 letters are as follows.       urlLink
