      i don't know.  is that a good name for this blog?  i look at others and they all seem so creative in comparison.  this blog isn't only going to be about her and i.  it isn't only about d/s. that would get boring and old for me.  maybe in time i will change it or if some good ideas come in.  today is my last day at work in this organization.  on monday i am hopping into the uhaul and going cross country to start a new job.  it should be a good adventure.  a new job.  that i am looking forward to.  i have been looking for a job for about a year.  it takes time.  i work in the hierarchy of mgmt.  there is only one of me in each organization.  it isn't an easy to get the opportunity you are looking for.  the search isn't about finding a job with a great organization.  it is about finding a job with an organization with the right cultural match.  i interviewed at some places that i would have been miserable at.  some were in great shape financially.  working with people that have the same priorities and goals is more important.  i want to put something on my resume that shows that i can make change.  turn around a place.  the one that i found is going to be a challenge. it looses money.  lots of money.  when i was at the place i though, "uhg".  afterwards i kept becoming more and more intrigued about the challenge.  so much that i took the job.    i am going to miss contacting my Sub while on this trip.  she is wonderful and a joy to me.  hopefully my absence she will miss me greater.

      the beginning of this relationship was over a couple of months ago.  since then we chat a little almost each day, shoot emails back and forth, and have spoken to each other on the phone a couple of times.  she is 22, beautiful (i have seen a picture), sweet, full of love and passion to give, she does not like the person she is, and is full of emotional pain.  she has been going through a very difficult time the past few months dealing with the death of a parent.  it breaks my heart.  i don't think that is the beginnings of her pain.  there is more to it.  the pain has been there for a much longer time.  when we first met i asked her why she wanted to be a Sub.  she thought that she would do better emotionally and be happier if she answered to a Master.  i do think she is right.  since we have met she does seem to be doing better.  it is strange how you can see the emotion in a personâ€™s writings.  there is not as much sadness in her life.    it is my belief that with as much pain as she holds inside, she wants to feel pain on the outside to release it or counterbalance it.  she doesn't want to be hit or abused.  nor do i have the desire.  she does want to feel teeth making marks on her skin, have her body be overpowered with the weight of a man, be forced to do any sexual act i desire, have her body be used by me.  i can tell she wants marks of many kinds left on her in her submissive role.  my impression is that they would serve as memories of her time with me.  she is like a flower to me.  i don't want her only as a sex toy.  i will not be her true love and have her bear my children.  i do care for her greatly.  even love her.  i want to see her blossom and grow.  give her joy.  watch her have a fulfilled life.   i could go on about her.  maybe there could be a part II to this.  i am going to be moving the next couple of weeks.  this might be my last blog for a week or so.  the trip requires a 5 day drive.  there is a lot going on now in my life.  tomorrow will be my last blog for a while.

      a couple of months ago while on business trip i started surfing the yahoo chat rooms looking for some entertainment.  odd as it seems, i've never done it before.  it didn't take long before i met someone.  can't really remember our conversation.  soon enough she asked me if she could where my collar.  i am not very astute in the d/s lifestyle, but i said yes thinking what the heck this is just for fun.  little did i know what it would evolve into.

      it is very disapointing to me.  with the new job, the move, & buying a new house i do not have enough time to spend any quality time with my sub.  i am sure that with time things will change.  i desire to use her for my needs so much.  leave myself in her.  leave marks on her.  have her serve me.  serve my needs.  in time things will change.  she understands and is doing well.

      the move is over.  i have started in my new job.  this is very overwhelming.  all the new names and faces to remember.  then to develop the role that i am to play within the organization.  it is too much to think about at times.  by the end of the day i am entirely exhausted.  i know it won't last forever and it will come to an end.  i just have to give it time.  my Sub contacted me.  she says that she is not doing well.  that she needs her Master.  i hope that does not mean she has started "cutting" again.  she is full of so much pain inside at times she want to actually feel it.  it hurts me to know that she does it.  in time we will work on this and put an end to it.

      i have been missing my Sub a great deal lately. it has been a couple of weeks since we last chatted.  since the begining she has been keeping a diary online.  i have told her multiple times that i want her to add to it on a regular basis.  it gives me a diferent insite into her and what is going on in her head.  i feel that the more i know and understand about her the better Master i can be to her.  the problem i am having is she is not keeping up on her duties.  i believe i am going to have to put my foot down on this.  tell her a minimum amount of times she is going to have to publish per week.  she truely is a beautiful writer.  it brings me pleasure to read it.  it draws me to her.
