        »-(¯` £éóVYN ´¯)-»™    Lessons in Logic:     Practice makes perfect.....   No one's perfect.....   so why practice?    I was born intelligent -    education ruined me.    If it's true that we are here to help others,    then what exactly are the others here for?    Since light travels faster than sound,   people appear bright until you hear them speak.    How come "abbreviated" is such a long word?    Money is not everything.   There's Mastercard & Visa.      One should love animals.   They are so tasty.      Behind every successful man, there is a woman   And behind every unsuccessful man, there are two.    Every man should marry.   After all, happiness is not the only thing in life.      The wise never marry.   and when they marry they become otherwise.      Success is a relative term.   It brings so many relatives.    Never put off the work till tomorrow   what you can put off today.    "Your future depends on your dreams"   So go to sleep      There should be a better way to start a day   Than waking up every morning      "Hard work never killed anybody"   But why take the risk      "Work fascinates me"   I can look at it for hours    God made relatives;   Thank God we can choose our friends.    The more you learn, the more you know,   The more you know, the more you forget   The more you forget, the less you know   So.. why learn.    A bus station is where a bus stops. A train station is where a train stops. On my desk, I have a work station....what more can I say........      If your father is a poor man,it is your fate but,if your father-in-law is a poor man,it's your stupidity                 X D    Now      this      is what I call LOGICAL sentences!     ©2004 LeoVYN.

Anyway, I'm the one in the centre and beside me are two of my best friends, the one on the right is my "jie"~   We took this picture and wrote friends forever coz we want to stay together 4EVA~   As for the background, unfortunately we were only given 100 seconds to choose, otherwise we'd have chosen another *DUH*, but I still think it's quite nice =P...     All the red T-shirts are worn on National day in school, so we took the chance after school to go to Tampinese Mall to take this pic~   Nice? From Japan~     Anyway, yesterday was National day and I forgot to wish it a Happie Birthdae... So...   Singapore~ Happie National DAE~! Woot~!    urlLink     ©2004 LeoVYN.

       »-(¯` £éóVYN ´¯)-»™      Phua Chu Kang was asked to make a sentence using 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10. Not only did he do it 1 to 10, he did it again from 10 back to 1.

So I go into  7  eleven and grab some   8   to throw at him.   Then I took a   9   and try to stab him.   10   God he run away. So, I put the   9   back and pay for the   8   and left   7   eleven. Next day, I call my boss and say I am   6 .  He said   5  , tomorrow also no need to come back  4  work. He also ask me to climb a   3   and jump down. I don't understand, I so nice   2   him but I dont know what he   1  ".

      »-(¯` £éóVYN ´¯)-»™  SMS  SMSing is such a wonderful form of   communication. Like when you wanna say, "I had always liked you." or "Go ahead, make my day, go and die if you want to, migrate, change school or what lar..." Okay... Maybe SMSes have their bad points... as in coz they can allow one to talk all sorts of mushy crap or harsh crap without making facial contact~! Whee...      Today...   ...I was sent to the "detention room" (well, not the detention room itself coz there were no girls, only boys in there, and things can be dangerous in those situations, if you know what I mean) and I had to spend 2 hours in there doin' nothin' at all... Boring... Yeah, I know it really doesn't seem like girls get into much trouble, but I guess I'm different in a (-ve) aspect *dratz!*... I kept lookin' at my watch, counting each second as the clock went on tickin' and I just kept starin' and starin' and starin'...... and stari.... n'.... *snore*... I got so bored at slept awhile, I guess... Then I woke up and it was still an hour more to go *>.   5... 4... 3... 2... 1... YES! =D 2 hours completed! I almost tripped myself from jumpin' outta the "detention room"~ I still had to wait... CO [Chinese Orchestra] wasn't over... and I sorta promised my "jie" that I was going to wait for her until CO finished (don't ask, I was bored)... bo liao or whatever... that's me...   And so, there I was waiting for "the Chinese Orchestra room" *There's no such thing, it's the Art Room. Chinese Orchestra doesn't even HAVE their own room XD unlike band!* door to open wide so that I could go home with my dear Jie who's hands were so painful, they probably were about to drop off, literally (Ahhh!!! Drop-hand girl! Nooo, the hand is wriggling!!! Argh! *pukes*). Anyway, so there I was, minding my own business when so many ppl passed by me and I was so paiseh, standing there doin' nothin' at all (///O///O/// *blush*)...   At around 6 they were released and my "jie" came lookin' for me (so touched!! *Jie: Eh, it was u hu ask me 2 look for you leh... -.-; lll  ) and we both left the place, the dreadful, dreadful place called school...And that's just about it... =)       ©2004 LeoVYN.

      »-(¯` £éóVYN ´¯)-»™   Today was a nice day, with all the performance and all... I was performing on stage for with my fellow Chinese Orchestra peeps... and something terrible happened (see la, go and make me do detention on a day with such an important practice!!! Haiyo... Wrong timing leh, 'cher)!! I forgot I was supposed to come in after 4 beats (or was it eight? see, s2pid 'cher, make me serve detetion on such a crucial day!), but I go and come in so much earlier... So damn paiseh! Sheesh, crap lar...      Anyway, the better parts came after CO was over *whew*. Me and my Didi had plans to go to Bishan to buy a present for my birthday. I came out of the school building and hopped on a bus (after waiting for such a long time) to Bedok MRT. Ever so strangely, the escalator going up to the platform had broken down (*sobs* too bad) and so I took the long way up and boarded a cabin that I usually don't choose due to laziness issues~. I boarded a train and that's when it started. My Didi SMSed me saying that he was on a train from Buona Vista coming down to City Hall, and I was at Aljunied then.   Just about the same number of stops until City Hall... When I got out of the train to change over to City Hall, the North South line (I think that's what it's called anyway... The red line on the MRT? Which goes Dhoby Ghaut, Summerset, Orchard, Newton, Novena, Toa Payoh, Braddel and finally Bishan, where we had originally planned to meet...) train had just arrived and the doors were open. I rushed over to the train and found one of the cabins less full compared to the others. Running in, I managed to take the earlier train *Yay!*. Little did I know that my Didi was in the same cabin as me... When he said that he assumed that I had missed this train, I told him that I had managed to board it, but didn't know where I was. I could've seen him, really, I could. But apparently my eyesight isn't the best in the world, somehow I didn't notice him sitting down diagonally "quite-beside" me (whattheheck)! Well, that's just about it on the whole coincidental thing... as I was about to alight the train at Bishan, I saw him standing up, but I couldn't call him coz even if I did, he probably couldn't come over to where I was coz there were, like, so many people... I decided to see if he would run to play catch up with me~ [Don't get angry, k, di?] So I just walked towards the escalator and up I went~ Of course, yeah, he did catch up~!     Didi bought me a set of nice earrings~ I love 'em, too bad I can't take out the earrings I used to pierce through my ears... not 'til next Wednesday anyway... so sad! Otherwise I'd wear it now... Well, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my didi *Er Hem!* Thanks~!!!       ©2004 LeoVYN. All rights reserved

      »-(¯` £éóVYN ´¯)-»™   M  y   f  r  i  e  n  d  s   and the   Y  e   B  r  o  t  h  e  r  s ...     M  y   f  r  i  e  n  d  s  ' reactions were simply priceless... maybe I'm evul, but I can't help laughing out loud...       The other day [the performance was held, in which I played the song way earlier than I as supposed to], I was walking alongside to my Jie, looking down from the second floor once in a while... then I spotted one of the  Y  e   b  r  o  t  h  e  r  s . How I got to know the  Y  e   b  r  o  t  h  e  r  s  is still kinda like a mystery to me still... Anyway, the elder of the  Y  e   b  r  o  t  h  e  r  s  was walking towards his classroom, unaware that I was looking down at him. My Jie was sure to have known that I had seen him, and yet, she did not expect what came next...      ..."[name of elder  Y  e   b  r  o  t  h  e  r ]!" I shouted, and I ducked so that he could see no one other than Jie. She was so paiseh that she laughed... LoL... Then she came after me... Haha, my cute Jie~      That was the first incident which involved the elder brother... no big deal, after all, it  was  still within the school grounds and school hours...      But today, I went to celebrate my birthday at The Cafe' Cartel or something with  m  y   f  r  i  e  n  d  s . We ate many things, pasta and pizza and stuff, and I ate a cake while the other 3 of my friends ate ice-cream. Straight after, my Jie and another indian friend left the restaurant, leaving the both of us [me and my other friend] inside. Later we saw her again, but that's not important anywayz...       M  y   f  r  i  e  n  d  and I went to Tampinese Mall, got off bus no. 10 and walked on..........until McDonalds, which isn't very far from the bus interchange. I wasn't paying much attention to the surrounding area and was just talking on and on about the younger of the two  Y  e   b  r  o  t  h  e  r  s  [I DID NOT start the conversation...well, I don't think so] when my friend suddenly pointed to my left. A guy in a Temasek Dragon House T-shirt was walking the opposite direction of where I was going. It was the person I was talking on and on about... Coincidence? (dumb luck?)... There was only one thing to do...........................................................      ................................."[name of younger  Y  e   b  r  o  t  h  e  r ]!".......................Then I ran ahead, leaving him to turn around, searching for the source of the voice which called him... and there  m  y   f  r  i  e  n  d  was, just waving her hand at him and saying "hi"... I guess she couldn't think of much to say then...   But I still can't really believe the piece of luck I had... Meeting him there... I don't go there often and neither does he, and yet, we passed each other, I saw him and I  think  he saw me...        Well, that's about all that happened... So... er... BYE~! *smilez*      ©2004 LeoVYN. All rights reserved
