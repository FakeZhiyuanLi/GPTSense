      I GOT TO SEE BEATIFUL FISHES AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM. I THINK IT COULD HAVE IMPROVED BY GOING ON GROUPS OF 5 OR EITHER JUST EXPLORING ON YOUR OWN. I DIDNT REALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE WHAT I WANTED TO SEE. I ALSO THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FUN TO EXPLORE ON MY OWN. NEXT YEAR FOR THE NEXT THEME I WOULD WANT TO GO TO MOODY GARDENS. THAT TELLS YOU BOTH ABOUT ANIMALS AND FISH.

      When we went to the Aquarium, we had a tour and explored about the many fish of the deep blue sea. We looked at an electric eel, red snapper, nurse shark, and had a chance to touch a stingray! After we completed the tour, we hopped on a train and did some more research on shark. We went inside a tunnel thatcontained 7 tons of water held up only by 5 inches of thick glass! We seen several different types of sharks. I  learned about so many fish and what may happen if you weren't careful with certain fish. When we went there, we weren't able to ride anything, I would like it if we could have did something to enjoy. Maybe they can go to a kind of zoo where they can feed the animals. They can see how they are bred and mantained.

         On our field trip to the Aquarium it was very nice. it could have been better it there were more things to do. The wide variety is wonderful. All the colors of the fish mixed into one tank was reallly preety. i wouldnt mind goin again as long as there are more things to do.The train ride was nice also. Some of the sharks were huge, then there were others that were kinda of small.It was kinda of scary that the train was urrounded by water. I would hate to imagine the water tank breaking with a train inside of the tunnel.Next year i wouls like to go to moody gardens.No matter how many times you go it is still educational and fun.

      I believed that the crew in the story " The Crew That Vanished" did in fact actually vanish. Although they had some insurance money saved up, they left some of their most favorite things in that boat. They left the girl's, Sophia's, toys all on the bed and hung up all their laundry very tidily.Even though they may think they ditched the boat for money because the Lifeboat was not anywhere in sight, but like they said, many ships were sailing around that time and not one ship reported a lifeboat sailing around...

      The story that I am doing is called "Gentle Rue." This is a story about an old woman who has haunted a light house for many years. Some visitors and tourists have either heard or seen her footsteps on the floor.

      The relative that I am more closed to is my cousin. He was very hardworking, easy to get along with, had the build to intimidate anyone, and taught me many things I learned today, He graduated two years ago, and then enlisted into the Marines and was shipped off in November of 2002. I haven't talked to him since but when he calls he always seems to ask about me. I really look up to him and also plan to enlist in the Marines. The last I heard, he was in Japan and tried to call during the day over there, but was like 4:00 in the morning over here! Well thats pretty much it, the bond between me and my cousin.

      Traditions, this is a word that describes how one culture endures a certain act as a ritual or usual activity. In my culture, as a Mexican, the women have a certain tradition, or party rather, called a quinceneara. This is a tradition where a young girl has entered her mature stage and transforms into a young lady. The word quince means 15, so this also can be called a 15 to many other people. Every so often, there is a cross over where the young boy changes to a man and is still labeled as a 15 as well. The party will consist of presents, a dance, and an ever so popular toast to young woman. There is also another form of ritual that is becoming very popular called the "Running of The Bulls." This is where many men run away from wild, untamed bulls. This is very dangerous, but the adrenaline rush is what you can't fight. People travel from all over the world to see this event. In the years, you have also seen woman in the run as well. So you see where the cross over is in this tradition.
