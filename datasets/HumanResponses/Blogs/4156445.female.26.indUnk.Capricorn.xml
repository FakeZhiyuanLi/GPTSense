      A 6 or 7 year old girl from Gilmore was kidnapped on Sunday.  Yesterday they arrested and charged her babysitter with kidnapping.  They sitll have not found the little girl, but they did find her bike and her shoes.  Gilmore is about 6 miles from Tyronza, where I used to live.  I feel so bad for the family.  I hope and pray that they find her alive.  I can't imagine anything worse than losing a child.

      Not a lot going on here.  I have had a few job interviews in the last few days.  I have another one this afternoon.  I am hoping to be able to work enough to afford to put Bethanie in day care.  She wanted to ride the bus with Michael this morning!  We went to meet the bus and she insisted on taking her backpack.  So cute.  She has a Dora backpack and she is so proud of it.  It has a lunchbox that attaches to it too.  She thinks that she is something with that!  I got a letter in the mail yesterday.  It's about me teaching PRE (Sunday School).  I have to go to training for that on a Tuesday night, and on a Saturday.  At the bottom, it says that I have been assigned to 2nd-D grade, and that I am a Catechist, which is the head teacher.  I had expected to be an assistant since I haven't taught PRE in 8 years, but that is where they put me.  I am assuming that they have more than one 2nd grade class.  I hope so, Michael will DIE if I am his teacher!  Hehehehe!  I asked him if I can come eat lunch with him one day and he was like, ummmmmm, no.  What was I thinking?  They had curriculum night Tuesday night.  I was impressed by what they were going to learn this year.  They have 4 textbooks, 2 of them are new and the other 2 have only been used last year.  He has several workbooks too.  I think that he will learn a lot.  He school is supposed to be one of the best in the district.  The wesite for the school is  urlLink www.sycamoreschool.com .  I have heard rumors that they are going to post grades there too.  It's not updated yet, but if you click on IntraNet Teacher's Web Pages, then go to Mrs. Poole, you can see what all he is doing.  She is going to do that next week I believe she said.

      Michael loved his school!  He rode the bus home, with no problems.  He did say that it was a little late, but other than that he was fine.  He really enjoyed it.  He wanted to ride this morning, but it came way early (8 minutes) so he missed it.  He was so disappointed that he started crying.  I felt bad for him.  I went into the office and asked what time it will come, and they gave me a number to call.  I'll call them later and find out.  On a sadder note, a baby was left in a car yesterday and died.  The father was a youth minister at a church and left the kid in the backseat, rather than taking her into the daycare there, which is where she usually stayed. How can someone forget their own kid?  I just don't get it!  I always check my car for stuff that I need to take in when I get out.  My children fall under the catagory fo things I need to take in.  If you aren't intelligent enough to take your child out of the car, then you aren't intelligent enough to have kids.  Just my opinion, what do I know?

      Well Michael started school today. I think it was harder on me than on him. This is his first year in public school, and it was a shocker to see how many kids there were this morning. We parked about a half a mile away from the school so I could walk him in, with all his supplies. He also didn't know where his classroom was. We found it easily enough though. He is so nervous poor kid. But he did say that he wants to ride the bus home. So he is doing that. He will be here about 4 this after noon. His teacher seems nice. She looks old enough to have experience, but young enough to keep up with a bunch of 2nd graders. It seems so late in the morning, and I feel like it should be about 8 since I just dropped him off. We get to sleep in!

      This is my first attempt at this, so pardon my mistakes.  I decided to blog since everyone else is doing it.  Not that I really consider myself a sheep, but I do like to be "in."  So here I am  Here's an idea.  Maybe I can send this link to the in laws so they can keep up with our lives.  Then again, maybe they don't care.  On the up side, school starts on Monday!  We have school supplies and clothes.  Just need to find out who Michael's teacher is going to be and where the class room is.  I am working on getting Bethanie in school.  She needs it so bad.  I submitted her papers to get into the special ed program, but I didn't do it in time.  The fact that they never called me back had nothing to do with that I suppose.  I'd put her in daycare, but sheesh!  That costs an arm and a leg around here!  Average is $125 PER WEEK!  That is $500 per month.  Michael's Catholic school was half that last year.  Oh well, gotta do laundry and take Michael's Arkansas shot record to the health unit and get it put on a Tennessee form.
