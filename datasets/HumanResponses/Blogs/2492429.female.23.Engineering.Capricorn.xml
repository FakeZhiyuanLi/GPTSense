      I saw him standing across the sitting area, local Coffee house, I expected CrÃ¨me Brulee and a hot Expresso. I looked straight into his eyes and I knew I could love this man for a longtime II forgot all about the Expresso and ignored the craving for CrÃ¨me Brulee. In stead, he said hello and took me to the back of the Klatch, the mentioned local coffee house. He said he had something to show me. He walked me to his car and right there and then he gave me a daughter and I didn't eve have to wait nine months! We named her Natalya. She's an adorable redhead with gorgeous blue eyes. My relationship with him started the very same night.  Being the neurotic, depressive person [ that I hate to admit, am ] he's been there with me; to carry me when I trip and fall. He's been coaching me for hours on the phone when I can't stop crying. He's made me smile even when everything inside me feels shattered and broken. When the sadness gets to the core and annuls every breath in my lungs, he's been there to fill me with love. Some days, when I wake up and find no reason to keep going on, I think of him and realize that I  need  to go on, because he needs me with him. I don't understand however, how it is that he needs me. He's given so much to me and I feel I've come short. I know I have a lifetime to repay and that he does have all my love. I know he knows this. I know he sees it in my eyes.  Even when I've felt empty handed and had no arms around me, he's come to my rescue, to put his arms around me and make it all better for me. I never did admit to anyone my deep black hole. He knows about it and pulls me out when I do fall in it. Not only can I tell him about falling in the hole but he's the one to fix me with all his love.  Depression is really not a good friend, I can assure you this. My father always said that there's nothing love wouldn't cure. He was right. Taking meds for depression is not something I've ever looked forward to, therefore I avoid it. When things get bad and when I can't stay put together, I know I need a fix. I ask for a hug. Never before did I know the power a hug would have. I didn't really understand a kiss until he kissed me.  He's gone beyond expectations. I don't know how he does it. But I'm glad he's done it. I never knew anyone could love me so much.  I never knew love could mean so much in a person's life. I know it now. It's a big deal in my life.  He rocks!  And I don't have the words to explain. I wish you could dance with me to the same tune...   But I highly recommend that you find one of your own.

      I always told myself that strong women  don't cry , that strong women  don't ask for help , that strong women  don't need a man , that strong women  aren't hurt . How wrong was I.   In this last few years, I've learned that women become strong when they cry because they let the hurt out and allow themselves to learn from it, next time it will take more than that to get bent.  I also learned that  strong women ask for help , it only shows that one is mature enough to recognize one has limitations but seeks for the paths to outgrow them and become better, succeed.   Strong women need a man . You can only grow so much without a real man. Growing also means sharing your knowledge and interchanging it with others. Men and women eventually become one. How can you be strong if you're missing one of your elements?   Strong women are hurt  when they see their loved ones hurt. They hurt whey they happen to be in pain. You can't be a strong woman and not feel pain. How would you know you're strong if you're not proved to resist pain? I'm not talking about physical pain, please don't go for the twisted way... I talk about the hurt one finds inside when the things outside just seem wrong and one strives to make them all better.  I always thought I was a strong woman. Today, I know I'm not. It's taken me years to realize it. I'm not so tough.

      In the search of a home that feels comfortable, I keep looking for a new home. I just can't seem to get the feeling of belonging.  I don't expect anyone to understand. I just need to make sense of myself.

      So I&nbsp;laugh at my self and&nbsp;smile in the shadows.  Run around in circles and dance in the rain.  Yeah... I've been hoping for a rainy day.   I also need a drink.  I guess I could use a good buzz.  Haven't had one in A WHILE.   I didn't go to the gym this morning.  My ass feels big. I'm afraid I'm becoming  a fitness whore. I ate a cheese burger for lunch and repentance is  here. I have to go redeem my sins and run a mile.   I need my fix of endorphines. I need it more  than I could need a cigarette in a time of despair.   I look at myself in the mirror and I can't believe  this is me. When did I let go so much? How did I get so big?  I refuse to live like this. I'm going back to the gym.  I spend an average of 4 hours per day there.  I come home and I miss being there.  My body aches. It feels great.   I really would like to dance in the rain.
