      I wake up shaking, sweating and sick to my stomache. A pool of saliva has collected on my pillow and my knees are tucked up under my chin with my arms wrapped around them. The feelings sweeping over me are terror, panic, then a little confusion. I sit up and take a few deep breaths and assure myself that it was in fact just a nightmare. I look at the clock and it reads 4:16 am. I have to get up for work in 45 minutes. Now the feeling consuming me is anger. Being pissed off that I had to be awoken now and not closer, much closer, to my alarm is enough to put me right back to sleep.  Here's the thing, the dream really wasn't very scary. A breif recap for your enjoyment. In the dream, my friend Sheldon lured me into an abandoned wharehouse where a stage was set up against the far wall. On the stage was a bed with black bed posts and white sheets. After a few minutes, a little girl walked out onto the stage and sat on the bed. The lights (yes, as in theatre lights) went down and a moment passed. Scilence. Then, the lights dimmed up a bit and the little girl was lying down. She began to sound as though she was in distress. I looked to Sheldon and asked what was happening, he  repsonded "just watch" and looked onward. The little girl started to cry and scream, then her voice deepened and became ruff and cold. She then began to levitate and spin around slowly. Very afraid inside my dreamI again turned to Sheldon. "Just Watch" he insisted. The little girl was now turning upright, floating high in the air as if standing on nothing. She looked into my eyes and her face began to transform into a sickly green colour and started to crack open. Her eyes widened considerably with a look of pure evil. She then screamed a blood boiling, ruff, low grumbly scream and I was filling my shorts. This is when I woke up with the above described symptoms of post nightmare.  So yes, I have told you that a theatrical presentation of 'The Excorcist' would nearly kill me. But so what, I don't kow anybody who wasn't afraid of that movie, even the people who loved it, feared it. But the thing is, I have never seen it, not in it's entirety anyhow, only the first twenty minutes or so. That was enough for me. I only dreamt of it because two guys from work are always raving about it, and so it was on my mind. The play thing came from thinking about play writes and scripts. However, the idea of the dream, excluding it's details, was really dumb. I feel like an idiot for beeing so afraid, but thats life I guess. It's like being afraid of a moth or a grass hopper, it can't hurt you no matter what, but still, like nightmares, their creepy little buggers!

      Out of the boredom and confinement of my own apartment, I put on my chucks and wondered over to the video store to see what I could see. After gazing through the aisles of oldies but goodies and sparking no interest in anything available, I undertook a brave new passage, the New Releases!  You see, I like to rent movies that I have seen a bajillion times so I can watch the commentaries and know exactly what diaolouge is happening, and understand everything that is being said about the film in proper context and relavence. Why don't I  just watch the commentary after I see the new movie for the first time? Well, I have a pretty limited memory, so, things slip easily. Okay, with 'Melvin Goes To Dinner' I tried to watch the commentary after the first time I saw the film and I remembered enough to get what they were saying about it all. But trust me, I have that bad a memory that I will forget something I saw only a short while before. Let me put it to you this way, have you ever seen 'Momento'?  The premise is this; a guy named Melvin accidentaly calls an old friend on his cell phone speed dial. His friend, Joey, is in the middle of a business meeting which he is glad to be excused from. They agree to meet for dinner later that night to catch up as it had been four months since their last time together. Melvin is reluctant to go for contradictory reasons, but gives in. Upon arriving at the restaraunt he is greeted by Joey, who is accompanied by two strange women, Alex and Sarah. The foursome disscuss everything unethical to discuss at a dinner table between strangers. From a heated debate about religion and beliefs, ghosts, infedelity and sexual fetishes, the conversation lacks only in small talk. Each character gives their own two bits with outspoken opinions and unapologetic defensive stands. Secrets and confessions are passed around the table as easily and often as the wine bottles. The evening runs late, the waitress' shift ends, and the conversation is ended only by these means. Each Character has his/her own back story which plays relavence to the discussions, and the twists and tie-ins of each characters autobiographies are clever and unpredictable. The story wraps itself together in a way that upon seing the film a second time around seems much to obvious, but being none the wiser the first time around is brilliantly disguised. The characters are all enjoyable to watch and a general sympathy is directed towards each persons life crisis. By the end of the film, you are left feeling compelled to go out and meet three strangers and discover a strange conversation that could not have happened any other way. Although the ever increasing 'twist ending' is present in this film, it is not one that leaves you feeling manipulated or tricked, just something that you didn't see coming, and kinda like after all is said and done.  I say this is a really awesome film. A cast of unknowns, sprinkled with some delightful cameos by well-knowns, makes for the characters to be believable. I think it was well put together and as for what you learn about it's history from the commentaries, it was an extraordinary transition from stage to film. The movie steps out of chronilogical order to better tell the story, and succeeds in allowing you to figure it out on your own, slightly before it's revealed in itself. A good film, and inspiring to get off my own butt and do something soon.  So thats it. I think you should check it out, and let me know what you thought of it.

       August 15, 2004      As this is my first post, I feel compelled to write something truly amazing. Something with the magnitude and dignity of a novelist, but the sweetness and heart of a poet. A post so remarkable it would staple me as one of the most diverse and thoughtful writers of the 21st century. However, it seems that the only thing I am able to conjure up from the vastness of my intellect is this; hello, welcome to my blog, I hope you read it lots.       That about sums up my ability as a writer. I guess it shouldn't surprise anyone who has received this blog from me personally. If you are reading this and you do not know me and you should choose to frequent this page, I give you thanks and apologies for what you will have to endure. Firstly, my spelling is at an equal level to that of a six year old. My grammer can sometimes cause a person to re-read a sentence four to five times. And there is the complete lack of a thoughtful vocabulary. You will probably grow tired of reading posts from my blog and eventualy stop checking in. But to my friends, you will be periodicly tested, at random of course, on the subject matter to which I am publishing here. So be on the look out, and stay updated.       Please feel free to comment as often as you like, whether it relates to the post or not. I look forward to reading your responses and sharing in on your posts. Also, it would make me feel appreciated and reaffirm the fact that I do have a few friends in this world. (sniff sniff)      Okay, there it is. I will have some links and interesting things put up within the next while. I don't know about a profile picture (sorry ladies) but I may include some stuff about me that maybe you didn't already know. Alright, have fun!
