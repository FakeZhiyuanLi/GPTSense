      Before I get on a soap box, here's a few things about today. I had fun a Jen's folks place.  Learning a new card game just about everytime makes it even more fun.  Good grillin too.  Was fun to take a mini-nap with my baby girl.  she's so adorable sometimes.  it's even more great when it rains.  TV cool stuff: On June 6th two shows will be coming back that I love!  MONK and The Dead Zone.  Sad news: Jerry Orbach is leaving Law & Order.  I guess he's done like 12 seasons.  He started with the show.  It's going to be weird without him on it.  I'll so miss him.  Thank god he'll be on another new spin off tho.  Now for the soap box.  Remember I warned ya.  I whole-heartly believe that if the USA will get their head out of their ass AND out of everyone else's business we might actually be able to get out of our Trillion/zillion dollar debt. As the quote is going around lately:  "The war is only over for those that have died."  I say get a Woman as president and this shit wouldn't even be happening!  I find it really great that our own weapons are being used against us.  Also finding out that we trained most of them here in the States and now the training is being used against us as well.  WTF!  Info gathering question:  Have you ever fell in love or loved someone and not told them?  Salute to all those that have served, to those that are currently serving, and to those that will choose to serve in the future.  A huge thank you to those that have fallen.  You will not be forgotten.

      I'm finally getting a ceiling fan in my apt! I was only told about 2 yrs ago that they would put one in.  I didn't push the issue since I was fine about having a warm apt almost all year round.  Warm good.  COLD bad, very bad.   It only sucked when it was REALLY warm.  The room with the wall airconditioner was cool but the bedroom would be warmer than toast.  Some nights that was hell but w/o covers it's not too bad.  So any, it should be installed this weekend or next week sometime.  Had fun making a cheese cake last night.  It baked pretty well.  New recipe that i've been wanting to try.  Tried it this morning.  WAY chocolatey sweet.  Awesome for those chocolate chravings.  Helped out a friend this morning.  Never knew ripping up carpeting would help in getting out so much agression.  Thanks buddy.  Anytime you need help again I'm more than willing.  OK now about the class w/ no license.  I was under the terrible impression that after taking this class I would be a licensed bartender.  Nope.  Now it looks like I have to go to the city and pay 45 bucks to get the damn thing.  I thought paying the 25 bucks for class meant that I get the license after or something close to that. I suppose I was having a major blonde moment when Jen told me the other part of the deal but I so don't remember hearing the other part.  The really hard part is finding the time to get downtown or whereever I have to go to get the damn thing.  I mean the fees paid out isn't a biggy since those can be made up with one night of working.  I guess another mental health day is needed. hehe  Few major fun things coming up.   urlLink Summerfest   Going at least 3 or 4 times.  25th to see  urlLink Rufus Wainwright    urlLink Joan Jett  on the 28th.  4th has  urlLink Indigo Girls .  29th  urlLink Kenny Wayne Shepherd .  Also on the 4th -  urlLink Fuel .   urlLink Tantric  on the 26th.  Seen them before so I might go.  Baby, 29th has  urlLink Saliva .  Oh man!   urlLink Tesla  is also going to be there- 30th.  OK before I link the whole awesome free lineup on the different stages, I'll just mention a few other cool acts.  Love Monkeys, Phil Vasser, Clarence Clemons, Kool and the Gang, and Morris Day and the Time.  Check it out.  Want to go any of the ones I linked, let me know.  Other fun events:   urlLink Dining out  night - June 10th.  Heading out with Jen, best friend from High School and her hubby, and a mutual friend of us all.  We just haven't picked a place yet.  Well after a full day of events I was really beat.  Took a great nap and woke back up around 830.  Damn cell phone.  Did anyone ever say that power tools were a great reviving tool?  I just did! :)  The question for the posting is this:  Did you ever leave a gathering cause the conversation weirded you out?

      Ballet tonight was great.....more than that, awesome!  I loved the music, costumes, and the dancing.  Dancing is one of the reasons I'm a season subscriber.  I really recommend it for everyone!  Next season (sept '04 - may '05) is going to be really cool.  It will open with The Hunchback of Notre Dame and end with The Flute.  Either way the costumes and dancing will just make me gush with great pride that we have such a terrific ballet.  I'd like to see a show in NYC one day.  I also love dressing up for such events.  Sometimes it's a drag but I mostly enjoy it.  Memorial weekend coming and I get tomorrow night and Sunday to myself.  I get to be with the babies the whole time.  I kinda can't wait.  I don't know what it is but I just can't wait to be home and have them around me.  I love it most when they chase each other and to calm down they come by me for some lovin'.  They then crash on me but I love it all.  Love having them purr and holding their head or paws in my hand as they fall asleep.  It's so awesome!  I think I'm having trouble with the word awesome tonight.  I haven't even had any booze either!!    Summer is coming and so are alot of events.  I'm a bit excited about that too.   Ok this is getting lengthy.  Ponder this batman:  If there was one event you could take back, what would it be and why?

      List of stuff for the day. boss was off today - way cool i was off friday which made me ultra happy; however, being off doesn't always have it's rewards.  spent half the day catching up on the paperwork from friday and the other half doing desktop support. i don't mind desktop support but there are so many other things in the lab that i have to do or catchup on and would rather do those.  that's so sad since .... wait it's not really all that sad.  i rather be doing break/fix than desktop support.  more i'm away from users the happier i am. :D o this part is fun.... around here they are weeding out the folks that have been here a long time and bringing in "new and improved".  i think some folks that have been here since the beginning should stay but if they are hampering more than helping, don't let the door hit you on the ass on the way out brother! also part of this fun day was:   *i was expecting about 50 laptops to appear, since i requested that delivery date 2 seconds after we ordered 100 of 'em - i received zero. *i was expecting other things to get done, i received zero on that as well. yes that did not make for a productive day.  i wanted to have about 15 machines go out today but only 7 did.  someone didn't have their game on this afternoon while i was out of the lab.  can we say, i'm not pleased?  anywho, i was thinking of proposing a question and hope to get responses from anyone that is aware of the site.  the question is this:  Ever have a kiss so satisfying that it quenches your hunger for sex? I'm not exactly looking for details, a yes or no will do but i would like some comment or two added to yes or no. :)   ON THE WAY TO COOL SIDE... I have "reserved" my costs for FIJI.  It looks like it will be about 3k for an all inclusive week w/ flight out of milwaukee or chitown.  Ok i'm a tad bit excited about it....i so can't wait to be out of the states and somewhere completely new, different, across the international date line!

      Due to a boss that's a complete ass, I have to work today and post my time as yesterday.  I had the choice of doing it either Friday (day off) or yesterday but I choose to do it today.  Not sure why. I have two cats and they are awesome.  I mean I really like coming home to them very similar to those that like going home to their kids.  Mostly because these are my kids. Since work normally has me sooooo busy I go online about every two days or so.  Mostly to check my email and that's about it.  If someone starts chatting with me then I'll be on a bit longer.  As long as I can chat and check stuff out then I'll be online.  Otherwise; I'd get offline. A little later on I'll be heading over to the grandfolks place and help dad get his van from stinking and loading up fishing gear.  I guess he'll go fishing sometime this week with some folks or something.  At least he can still do that.

      Quick note on the Summerfest deal so far: Night Ranger started late but did a little over an hour show.  They had the keyboard player from WhiteSnake playin.  Did a song or two from them.  Also did a Damn Yankees tone as well.  Pretty cool in my view. Rufus was awesome per usual.  Jen, Brenda, and I got guess passes so we did get to met him after the show.  Real sweetheart of a dude.  He is willing to play at Pridefest next year.  Now I just have to get my friend Todd to get him at the Gig. Tonight is Joan Jett.  See ya down there if you are there.  I was reading both the Fiji books that I have and trying to determine if the Island I select was the one I would really want to be on for the monies I have.  It's come down to a point where I'm thinkin Fiji is just not for a Single Chicka traveler.  Maybe  urlLink Palm Island  is the best spot for me or  urlLink Sanibel Island  is better.   I know there are several thousand islands out there but I'm not a money bags kinda girl.  Thoughts?

      Can you believe it?! Two posts in a row!  It was nice to leave work early and not have to use vacation or other time for the break.:)  Funny how after I left no one wanted to do my job for those 4 hours.  I love it.  Sometimes working with boys is just pure entertainment for myself.  3 weeks time and I'll be up north w/ the fam.  It will be cool to hang with the niece and nephew for a week.  Hoping allergies don't kill my days that are loaded with sun.  Hit the doc for annual checkup type o'thing.  I have tennis elbow!  I haven't played Tennis in years.  I guess working is/can be hazardous to one's health. hehe  I will just have to take it a bit easier at work.  Yeah right.  If I don't do it it will just be there for me to do either later or tomorrow.  Aren't I just a lucky one.  Now for those that know me, I'm not complaining, I'm just stating fact.  If my helper-dude was in today, he would be working his nuts off this afternoon.  Glad he'll be workin' Help Desk soon.  They need a real huge brain child there and I want the ref bonus. :D  About a month ago we had an office/practice close and all their equipment was sent back to corp.  I was expecting about 30 computer; however, I got about that many little portable printers and only 5 laptops.  Wonder what the heck happened there.  Well that got me on one of my rampages.  Many are not happy when I start to go off.  Most/sometimes it makes financial sense and I think that ticks people off.  Gee a company that was hurting about a year ago, not to mention is an auditing firm, now doesn't seem to want to tighten that belt again.  Call me silly but just cause we literally land a huge client doesn't mean we can just buy on whims.  Mad some proposals to the boss today with the purchasing person but they still don't see the big ka-ching.  I'm trying to get a bigger bonus outta them but hell if anyone else sees that.  Damn boys.  Trying to get the Fiji stuff finalized and I talked to the agent a bit ago.  Not sure I like the airheaded-ness or the way she doesn't have all my info there in front of her when I call.  I found that a bit strange.  If the whole thing is on hold, wouldn't it all be there together and one try options to any and all of it?  Maybe it's me and the power of the web when I book flights for myself or fam.  Maybe I'll take some time next year, later in the year, and learn how to do all that and giving myself all kinds of discounts. hehe  Well I have to get my act together and get down to Summerfest before it rains again.  Like I can avoid it when I'm down there.  Ah well.  Here it is:  Pleasure of self or Pleasure of Life, more fun?

      Hidalgo was a good movie.  So glad there wasn't a love interest and all that BS to get in the way of a decent story.  Love watching good movies at the cheap.  Maybe there should be more than one movie at the north budget. :p  It's so sad that going to see all these great movies lately that I know the commercials and previews that will be showing.  One benie is that you do hear/see about new movies like Collateral with Tom Cruise.  It looked interesting.  Can remember when it's out so please don't ask.  For those that wanna know, I'm heading to Summerfest the following days to see the following: Thursday - Night Ranger, Friday - Rufus Wainwright, Saturday - Tantric, Monday - Joan Jett and The Blackhearts, Tuesday - Kenny Wayne Shepherd/Saliva, Wednesday - Tesla, Sunday (4th) - Fuel.  Figured the fireworks will be the 3rd per usual.  Figures the night that I want to check email and do a post there are Tornado warnings.  That's my luck.  Going on vacation with the fam in about three weeks.  Won't be posting then so get your fill now. :)  I'll be lucky to get a signal in the great up-north.  As for the other great vacation, seriously if anyone does want to join me in Fiji, let me know now.  I'll be actually booking/ticketing the great wide adventure Sunday or Monday the latest.  Any questions,  urlLink email me .  I can almost not wait.  I'm just about ready to pack just for Fiji. I bought a new piece of luggage.  It has a detachable front backpack and the entire piece is on rollers and can become a med/lg backpack.  It's very cool.  Ok I have to go and do more magazine reading so I don't fall too far behind on that.  Like I'm near getting caught up, yeah right!  QUESTION of fun o'rama:  What non-sexual things do you do to make the day/minute/moment fun for yourself?

      Got home around 10 from a long day at work.  Left at 930.  Can we all say OT big time?!  Many might not think that is too bad since I normally leave at 6p; however, I started at 730 today.  Yeah.  Too many hours at work.  No planet for me this Friday.  Maybe next after a few hrs at Summerfest.  Next Tues - 6/22 - It will be budget movie night.  Feature that I'll be watching - Hidalgo.  Gotta see that hot, sexy Viggo. :D ;)  Night all and have a great weekend.

      The up coming events for me. Tomorrow night is Pizza Man with the College friends.  I get my best friends wedding pics, finally. :)  Friday might do Planet.  In the mood to shake my groovy thing.  Plus it's free to get in. ;D  Saturday is  urlLink Lakefront Festival of the Arts .  I get a reduced rate since I'm a Museum member.  Sunday is Dad day.  Toast one up to John's dad and for those that are no longer with us.  I'll be with my crazy fam.  We'll also be celebrating my mom's b-day.  It's normally the 22nd but my bro doesn't have the kids that week.  Other good news: FIJI island has been picked!!  urlLink Here  read all about it.  Here's the layout of the  urlLink resort .  Looks like the dates will be: Oct 21st until 29th.  Isn't that totally awesome?!  Work is getting more heated in the HD area.  Too much to post here.  Thinking someone there or USED to work there, checks this out and reports to their somewhat spy.  It will not matter too much longer.  Lucky if the spy lasts til Friday with the way things are going there.  We're doing IT Email Moratorium for two weeks.  That will be interesting.  It will force people to talk to one another and get the different tones of their emotions across clearly. LOL  Question of fun:  What is more fun, an actual act of sex or the cat and mouse game of flirting with the intended/wanted person?

      Ok so I had this pass to see Around the World in 80 Days. When I got there it was entirely sold out.  They were sold out around 6 or 6:15.  WTH? Well Nate showed up and we saw Troy.  Ok I was willing to see it cause of the semi-accurate history behind the legend.  And well I wanted to see Orlando Bloom too.  Man was I shocked. I saw so much V and treasure trails! .... YUMMY!!  I barely remember how sexy it was to see men in leather, men putting on their armor, and eyes that are a bit piercing.  DAMN! Orlando had such great locks that I could just play with the curls for hours.  I've not see so much chest at one time in a movie, I almost forgot what a site that is.  The major muscle stuff can go but the rest of the movie, well.... It has hollywood-ized the story of course. It's great blood and guts kinda film.  Acting was good.  The  urlLink actor  playing Hector did an awesome job.  Brad Pitt did very well in here also.  Orlando was so not right for the part of Paris.  I'd see it again for the battle scenes.  I would say they are better than the LOTR scenes - all of them.  Preview of an interesting  urlLink movie  I think it comes out in fall.  I'd see it just 'cause of Keanu.  Not major fan of his.  Only like three of his movies that he's been in.  It looks interesting so I'll have to see when it comes out.  Thanks for all the email, those folks that I haven't emailed back or talked to in awhile.  Hope to year from you more or see you at summerfest. :)

      It's the weekend once again.  So much to do and a nap is waiting so I'll make this quick.  Asian Moon is this weekend and I'll be hitting it with Jen and Her mom.  That should be cool.  Today I will probably be doing some work related stuff.  We are trying to figure out how to make the lab (aka my office) more efficient the way it is before we get an imaging tool.  Yeah I know, it doesn't make sense but either way we have to do something before we get the tool cause it can still be awhile before the tool is tuned up.  Dinner didn't happen on Thurs with all the old college buddies but it will happen this coming Thurs.  Still Pizza Man as the destination.  Jen and I hit Pallermo Villa for Dinner Out night.  Love their food.  They made the best ever Fetticini Allfredo that night.  I emailed a few friends the site link.  I haven't talked or emailed many of them in a long time.  It's good to kinda chat and get re-connected with them.  Hit the theatre 3 times this week.  That's outrageous for me anyway.  Monday night was Harry Potter 3, Tues was The Whole 10 Yards, and last night: The Chronicles of Riddick.  I really need to stop having popcorn for dinner. hehe Chronicles wasn't too bad.  A little more story of how Riddick became such a wanted dude would help.  Maybe it was in there but who can tell when someone is always kicking the back of your chair.  Well that's all for me.  Nap is calling.  Oh yeah, the question is:  Isn't the real person the reason you want to get to know someone or is it due to the shape of their body?

      I have preview tixs to see "Around the World in 80 days".  I'm not sure if it's just two tixs or more but if anyone is interested let me know.  I think it's for Monday night at the Ridge around 7 or 730.  I also have one extra Asian Moon tix for someone if there is an interested party.  I'm going on Sunday the 13th w/ Jen.  Again,if someone is interested, cool.  Received an email about my airline confirmation for Fiji.  I almost cried.  I'm so filled with excitement that I wish it to be the beginning of October now but then I would miss a few of my favorite things like the music at Summerfest, Irishfest, a week with the niece and nephew, and the start of fall here.  The later is close to my ultimate fav.  Thanks to those that are posting some responses to my questions.  I do apprec!  Also thanks to those folks reading.  I don't have a count of how many visit (yet!) but I know there is more than myself and one other reading this blog.  Thanks!!  OK what is the big hubbub about a now dead president?  Does the fucking world stop cause he's dead?  Hell no.  We are still fighting for every damn dollar earned.  I agree with some that he was a good pres but good gravy so were some that are still living.  Do we need to spend more tax dollars on a 21 canon salute for the man?  Wouldn't that money be spent better on research on stem cells, on cancer, on AIDs for christ's sake!  TV stations are going to interrupt current programming to cover the parade of the coffin and military pomp.  Is that really necessary?  Is this really generating enough revenue to help the deficit or just the DC area?  Another big question, will another president, currently living, get this kind of fanfare when they die?  I doubt it.  News even mentioned that we haven't done this since Lyndon Johnson.  Why is that?!  Does a president have to have some building or room named after them to get this kind of recognition when dead?  Fuck that!  Maybe they should honor Reagan by not having political commercials for the entire week or so until he's buried.  I could live with that.  On for more fun news and other good stuff.  This is a bit self titled cause I can. hehe  Here's another rampage, you are now warned.  What is with self titled music albums?  Are they supposed to be incites into the person?  Incites on what is going on with them about 6 to 9 months ago?  I'm curious but then again if you've gotten this far, you would have gathered that by now. :)  Should also have gathered that I question just about everything too.  Sometimes I also notice the little stuff and question that too.  I feel questions give incite into the person asking and answering.  Some ask questions just to have those same questions asked back.  OK I am guilty of that as well.  Eh, I'm human, deal with it.   Now for the tough question:  On your list of resolutions, how many, if any, have you started, finished or completed by now? (check the comments for my answer ;)  )

      Well today will be an interesting day.  Friend of mine quit today.  Looks like there is another Help Desk job open.  I believe the top two canidates will now get hired to fill the posted open position and the recently open spot.  The HD team needs a good boost/shot in the arm.  Too much bad past blood in there and new favoritism is not helping the situation either.  Anothre fun moment about the situation today; the part-timer, AKA: The Princess, is so far, AWOL.  She's almost outta here as well.  If not on her own according then theirs.  Good thing I'm in an isolate spot and pretty free to do what I want when I want. Love the size of my office too.  If anyone is in the area and wants to do lunch, let me know.  Call the cell it's on during the day.  I can go almost any time I want too. :D  Another fun part of my day is sending out 10 laptops to the UK to get there by Friday.  Let's see if this goes better than last week's did.  They did get the machines, a day late thanks to airborne cause they can not read but they did get 'em.  Strange out of the 700+ machines I have shipped out of here in approximately 4 months, I have only "lost" 3.  I say "lost" cause 2 were scanned as being on the truck but funny how they never made it to the airborne hub. hmmmm.  The third made it onto the truck, into the hub, shipped to the state but never made onto the truck or to our office in NC.  I find it a big odd and humorous at the same time.  Now I'm not perfect by no means.  I have done my share of miss shipments but I have not lost a laptop on my own accord.  Budget Movie night tonight.  I have one friend that is available wants to go.  Not sure if I so much up for it but we'll see how the day goes and how my back holds out from a crazy busy day.  Question:  Is life an adventure or something to get thru?

      Friday was nice and relaxing.  Left work a bit freaking.  Shipped 6 laptops to England on Thursday and the Client was contacting me due to DHL wanting some IPR information.  Hell if I know what the heck IPR is.  I've shipped all kinds of computer equipment to England in the past and was never asked for IPR before.  Of course, I called Airborne/DHL.  They didn't even show it was in Midlands, England as of yet.  GREAT.  Well as of this morning, at 6 am our time, it's showing up there as out for delivery.  The site doesn't but when I called, it was.  Ah.  Received the DVD I was waiting for.  Dinner for Five.  I can't wait to have a Dinner for Five night.  For those that know about the show are more than welcome and for those that don't, you can come too.  Now I just have to figure out when I'm going to have the party.  Suggestions?  Sat was a long day for me.  My boy woke me around 4 am. Yeah I was not happy but I couldn't exactly roll over and fall back asleep either. :( So I was up.  It was also bad day due to allergies.   Got up and did my normal dosage of allergy meds.  So glad that they are not a prescript one.  Did the dutiful oil change on the car.  Granted it was 1k over the recommended 3k limit but at least I got it done.  Had a changed to watch my cute little nephew play baseball.  He's pretty good when he pays attention.  He was being a bit of a slug going on and coming off the field.  Daddy you better start training with that boy! hehe  And yes I took a nap.  It was longer than usual but then again I normally don't get up at 4am on Sat.  Went to Pridefest Sunday.  Yeah this was a day where Summer showed up.  It was bloddy hot!  I wanted to go earlier but shit, there was no way I was going near the lake before 3pm.  OMG was there a ton of goodlooking boys.  Granted most of them were with other boys but it was good eye-candy for me.  Um...Most of the girls had all kinds of face piercings. Yuck!  Was cool to just walk around and see what they all have there for food and goods being sold.  Thanks to my friend Todd for the tixs!  So that's the weekend in a nut shell.  Now I look forward to the Dinner on Thursday.  It will be at PizzaMan.  I hope that is a groovy place for everyone.  Remember to eat out that day - it's Dining Out for Life night so find a  urlLink restaurant .  Now the question de'jour:  Ever want to talk to someone cause you like the sound of their voice?

      Cool that there is a full moon for the next couple of days.  It's a bit shitty cause it screws with my sleep.  ah well.  ok enough questions of how/why this got started.  Here are some of the answers you have been looking for. I started cause I had to have an id to make comments on a friends site.  Since I was creating an ID and et al, might as well start something.  I wasn't digging the livejournal stuff. I don't have time right now to learn php or research all that to just start something.  I'm all about finding the free stuff and not re-inventing the wheel.  So there it is.  For those that actually read this, Waiken is going on a road trip adventure and ending in the city of sin.  Wish you good travels friend and hope for some great pics of everywhere you go.  Too much political BS and stupid people at work.  I've already told you about my great boss, right?  Well he's up to the same shit, different day crap.  He very much lives up to his nickname of "The Blackhole".  Getting tired of folks coming up to me asking if Scott told me or fwded the email to me about this or that thing.  I guess I have to take time out from actually doing my work to bitching about my boss and the overload of work. I have this part-time dude and he's been really great.  Introduced me to Knoppix and a few other new toys.  Some of the hardware toys I actually got approved and have now, like a 4 port usb hub.  That is so tiny it's really smaller than my phone. Still working to get some imaging tool since he really doesn't want it to be ghost.  Found  urlLink Epirium Pro   made by some  urlLink german company .  All I know is this shit is a bomb and would so help in a ton of areas at work.  Of course I was told to have the pick of software yesterday but I guess getting yesterday is not really an option. :(  Ok now for the Question you've all been waiting for. hehe If you had the power to fire those that you feel are incompetent for any reason, would you really fire your boss?

      Hitting Flannery's tonight for some food and drinks w/ a friend of mine that doesn't work at JWI anymore.&nbsp; Anyone is welcome to join us after 8p.&nbsp; Give a ring if you want to come down and don't see us there.&nbsp; We might hit Taylor's for a bit if the waitress at Flannery's starts giving us the "get outta here" look.

      Ah a week without the g-folks was kinda nice.  No calls at times when I'm trying to watch a show that I cannot pause.  YES!  I slowly unpacked all the stuff...wait I'm still dragging my feet on some stuff.  Ah well that is what a single girl can do. It was totally sweet to come home to a clean apt.  I so love it.  Did I already mention my babies missed me terribly?  Well they did and I loved every second of it.  Also found out that the helper dude that I had (yes that's past tense there) missed me as well.  He wasn't used to doing all of it.  He just did the imaging and reimaging and I took care of everything else.  He did most of the job most of the time.  My "backup" would tell him that he was too busy.  Yeah right!  He's too busy doing his schoolwork on company time.  I'm all for screwing around now and then but get the work done first.  Leaves more time for screwing around.  As for more work info, my boss decided to bring in a guy while I was out.  The person has his MCSA.  Only to find out later, not to my happiness, that he's a paper mcsa.  The best part was his first day.  Helper dude was showing him the ropes.  When he opened a laptop he asked where the power button was.  I knew I was in trouble from that moment on.  It took the combination of my helper dude and myself to convince my boss that this is not the time to give someone a chance to learn.  So now I have a new helper dude starting Monday.  He's done this work before. Finally a bright person so I can get something done around there.  This week was quiet and I like that.  Not sure how this week will end up but I hope to have din w/ a friend I haven't seen since she quit.    Well it's off to get dinner in my humble pad.  What's in your bathroom? (The one closest to the bedroom)

      Here's a little something I saw at way to early this morning for me to be up but there http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/amchopper/photogalleries/irobot/irobot.html it is.  Nothing like seeing chrome in HDTV baby!  The up north deal is that I had to ride up w/ the g-folks and ride back home w/ the bro, my mom and the niece and nephew.  Figured the ride back wouldn't be so bad but of course the ride up will kill me.  At well it almost did.  G-folks like to preach and are major control freaks.  They suggested, before I moved into my small apt, I should move in with them.  Um...yeah, hell no!  They thought it would be a great money saving move.  I'm thinking ... NO FUCKING FREEDOM.  They try to reassure me that I can come and go as I please.  Yeah, right.  That's why they call every other day to find out what I've been up to.  Oops...that was a side rant, sorry.  Anyway, they complained about the bro and his icky g-friend.  Oh what they don't know.  So most of the ride was that then it was where I might travel and I shouldn't go alone or I should go to Aussie instead.  How does "parking my butt on a beach and chilling out" convert into I should go to Aussie?  I figure if I go to Aus then I really can't park my butt on the beach.  I have to check out the towns, shopping, museums, and people.  Well we get to the cottage, my stomach is upset, I'm going to puke, and I have to help unload all the crap.  All I want to do is change into jammies and relax.  Nope almost everyone else wants to do something.  After a few minutes no one but the kids want to do something.  For the week we caught about 150 fish.  Mostly Blue Gills, a few small mouth bass and sunfish.  Bro cleaned ‘em up and fried a small amt of ‘em on Friday.  It was very cool!  Kids had a great time too.  They actually wanted to stay up there for another week.  Ride down, my stomach was upset again.  Can’t anyone understand that taking turns and hills faster than 10 mph is bad on this girl?!  What the hell.  I’ve only told them for the last two years about it.  I slept most of the way back cause of the tummy.  The kids were fine watching their DVDs, well until they fell asleep too, from Rhinelander to the meeting of I-94 and Hwy 39.  I was the first to be dropped off.  Cool with me.  I didn’t do anything when I got home anyway, other than eat some junk food to settle my tummy.  Babies were very happy to see me.  I now had cat appendages the rest of the weekend.  It was pretty cool.  Next Room:  Kitchen – What do you have in there and what color is everything?

      OK... here it is: I learned that the Ex actually grew up a tad.  He learned that it isn't the size of the physical girl that makes her a Woman.  He also realizes that he made a HUGE mistake in letting this awesome Chick go for some psycho crazed baby-wanting nut.  It only took him over six years to get there.  Maybe it was turning 40 that did it.  Found that to be interesting when he told me all that.  Doesn't mean that I have any feelings for a human suit container for water, tho. :D  Other thing I learned was that Todd L was damn cool!  He watched my babies while I was in the Great White w/ the fam.  He also gave me 4 tixs to Irish Fest.  Now I just have to find 3 other folks that want to go, not on that Sat night.  I have a bit of time for that, so put it on your calendar.  Todd came over every night and spent time w/ Midnight.  He (Midnight) is such a social pig but I'm glad he's back to being nice to folks.  Little girl...well maybe she'll follow her brother on this like she has so many others of his good/bad habits.  Thanks Todd!  Learning that I can type 3 different types of directions in a total one days' time can happen.  Yikes that was so not fun.  I still have to document more of what I do.  Man that sucks most days.  The upside, well that I can do that and get all the details in w/o too many revisions.  Damn I'm good! ;)  South Pacific is just so vast, beautiful, and loaded with possibilities of all sorts.  Sorry I keep bringing up the SP but man...until I book something, I'm pumped and ready to just fly there tomorrow.  Ah..deal with it, as some friends would say. :)  My dad (g-dad that is) was reading some of the books I brought up and he couldn't figure out what island HE would go to.  Agreed w/ me that Fiji might not be the place for a single girl to go at any time, unless it's one of the more exclusive/expensive resorts.   Family, I believe, should be taken in small doses of less than a week.  Especially when there are kids involved.  Don't get me wrong.  I love kids, niece and nephew included but there is something to be said for quiet nights, peaceful fishing times, and sleeping in late.  Well the above leads me into the fam vacation week of well...last week.  I'll give you the doses of that at another time.  Trust me there's more.  Lots more. :)  Here's what I want to know.  Was thinking lately what others might decorate room with as in furniture, paint and wall hangings.  Let's start with the most used room - the Bedroom.  What?!  We sleep most of our lives say the stats anyway.  So what's in your room?  (details please)

      So much has happened since Summerfest started and vacation ended. Let's just say that some folks at work really missed me and don't want me to leave again any time soon.  Like hearing that.  I know they would have trouble w/o me so far.  Read some rumors that the Batchelor party wasn't too bad; but then again, "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas".  I still want to know the "dirt" cause I'm just so damn nosy.  The Grid was great.  It's very fast paced but worth telling so much in so little time.  It is pretty disturbing like it warns.  Julianne is so damn pretty in there and plays her character well.  Dylan well.... he's just hot and not good at this puppy role they gave him.  He should be commanding people or someone around.  He was pretty good at that on The Practice the few times I watched snippets.  Like when he's doing a strong character.  So the museum's special feature: The Quest for Immortality will be ending soon.  I went once already, near the time it opened.  I will be going again hopefully this sat morning.  I should be going one more time after that; if not, ah well.  There is a lot to see, you get all the time you want, BUT remember there are children there too AND inconsiderate people.  I hear that Mornings are better, not Free Mondays tho.  Next big exhibit should be "Pearls".  Don't know the details of that one yet since the Wings mag has yet to mention it.  Pearls might not run as long as Quest tho.  Well it's late/early.  I had a great question all lined up for you folks but it seems to have left this taxed brain.  For another day then.  I might just do a mini-time line of events from Summerfest til end o'vacation as not to bore you all at once. heh

      I'll be out of reachable connection from tomorrow night until the 20th, at least.  Will hit Bastille Days Friday night.  Anyone willing to join, give a ring.  Don't forget to watch  urlLink The Grid  on the 19th.  Julianna Margulies is so pretty.  She should have left ER a season or two before she did.  Saw the musical Cats last night.  There is something to be said for distance when watching one's favorite musical.  Third row from the stage does not hide much.  They have changed some things but the actress that played Grizabella, had an awesome voice.  Well then anyone that can sing Memory with a strong tone gets me everytime.  Scenery hasn't changed in years nor should it really.  Costumes have a bit.  So have some of the shapes of the cast.   While in the great white north woods I'll be doing all kinds of reading, playing with the kids, and cross-stitch.  Have fun ya'll!

      Bonsoir Monsieur’s and Mesdemoiselles, Ok a couple of things to get off my chest.  Summer was supposed to be here already.  I'm cold and it feels like 50 degrees around this town tonight, WTF!!  I want my well deserved warm weather.  Second thing, never have a person that loves to travel, live nears an airport.  It's f'in torture I tell ya!!  Also Summerfest is over and those semi-free concerts I will sorely miss.  Consolation prize - Cats tomorrow night!  This will be a busy week since I have to get all the documentation done so that someone can come into my lab and work.  Well most of it will be done cause there is just too much to document and not enough of my willingness to do it all.  Maybe while I'm gone for a week I'll be able to decide where in the South Pacific I wanna go. I'm still hung up on Fiji but it might not be as remote as I like.  We'll see.  Maybe I'll head for the Cook Islands instead or American Samoa.  Check out The Rock's home.  Wouldn't that be something? :)  Other good news.... My babies got their Lion haircuts and look adorable per usual.  Did I mention HDTV is damn awesome?!  Well it is and HDTV/Cable is damn good too.   Craig if you're reading this, you look damn handsome with those gray-distinguishing highlights.  Just thought I would mention it.  Sorry it wasn't in person but it looks like it will be awhile before the group gets together for dinner again.  Ren faire starts soon so go and have fun somewhat living in the past.   W, keep on truckin' safe.  OK the question is:  Shopping for decorating the home alone or with friends, fun or just something you have to do?

      I've been to quite a few movies lately so here are the reviews.  Wed night:  urlLink The Village . Not as scary as I thought it was going to be or suspenseful. There were a few "ah" spots and I love the exposition at the end. Won't tell you much here so that it gives it away - like 6th Sense. I will say that Adrien Brody plays a great nutcase in this one. Oh yeah, when Joaquin Phoenix goes off - almost every girl would like to hear that one day and yes, He had her at hello - smart ass (you know who you are! :P )  Thurs night:  urlLink Little Black Book . Curiosity didn't kill the cat in this movie but did kill the current relationship. Cute-type story line and it doesn't hurt that Ron Livingston is in the movie either. The girl doesn't get the guy in the end. It's sad but ya know that isn't such a bad thing sometimes either. One can do all right without a boyfriend or lover in one's life. Brittany Murphy doesn't do so badly in this one. Her character was pretty good. More entertaining was the famous person that shows up in the end. Commitment can be scary from a guy's point of view or so the movie let us see.   Remember "Kippy Kan Do!!"  Fri night:  urlLink Anchorman . Of course the humor was loaded thru and thru this movie. Had no idea the following folks were going to be in it at all: Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, and Christina Applegate. She looks great! Ben actually didn't look so bad either. Vince well he's still very very tall. 70's stuff threaded in the movie like no one's business. Helps make it a ton of laughs. Never knew that an Anchoman's job was so tough. lol  Sun night:  urlLink Kumar &amp; Harold/White Castle . OMG! Talk about teenage humor. It's "caked" with crazy pre-college hijinks. I completely understand their drive to get food satisfaction and have nothing butt distractions. Power to the oppressed kid!  Movie to wait for  urlLink Blade 3  - Dec 22nd.  Have a quiet time at the movies!  Question o'rama: How many alternate online or life personalities do you have?

      Yes yes.....SP 2 is on it's way and already the fun has begun. It's currently available for download from MS site with all the fancy dancy white papers. We have actually started doing some testing - can you believe it?! It has crashed about 3 machines so far. What does the MGR say about that - we'll just send an email out to our folks telling them not to install it since we have it set to download automatically. Yeah that sounds like the most terrific idea anyone in IT every had for warning folks not to install something.  No seriously that is what the boss just told me. I of course shrugged and said, "Yeah I told ya it's not going to be a good one." What else could I say? Ok I guess I could have said - "Told ya so!" But I'm trying to be the better person here. Hey we all have to do some self improvement.  As Jen would say, "Nope, never bitter."  Now go back to screwing off while at work. :)

      I'm so tired from work.  There's so much to do and pretty much just me to do it all.  I have part-time help but it's not enough.  There's enough work for 2 other people in the lab.  There might not be enough room for that many folks but there's enough work for it.  I'll be calling in dead instead of tired soon cause I'm just beat tired.  So I'll call in dead. LOL  Hence the plan. hehe  Plan:  work slow.  Be behind in almost everything.  Terrible I know but I have to do something during this growth spurt.  I'm done ranting again about that place.  John was sweet enough to call and join him and others to see The Village.  Not as spooky as I would have thought or seen in all the previews.  There were surprises tho.  The exposition is towards the end of the film, which is very different from others; similar to Sixth Sense. (Not seen signs so I can really say.)  The only thing I can say that won't spoil it - Adrian Brody plays a great nut case.  Seeing Little Black Book tonight.  Ron Livingston is in this one.  He's hot, in my opinion.  Enough rant - question time:  If you were terminally ill, would you stay were you are, deal w/ the treatments or move to be isolated?

      My friend Todd is pretty awesome.  He just handed me 6 tixs for the Arab Fest this coming weekend.  Who wants to go and what day? Also have 4 tixs for Irish fest the weekend of the 20th.  Who wants to go to that as well and when?

      Had a fun time Friday night at Planet.  Awesome to see Mack, Doro and Waiken again.  I so miss the days of Hoolies or BBCs for drinks and the occasional BS sessions.  I love hanging with the guys.  I'd like to do that more often.  Too bad many are taken and aren't allowed out to play. Only part I didn't like was having it all end so early.  Unfortunately when Jen or I work we have to be there until 3 before we get to leave.  Saturday was such a lazy day.  Slept most of the day due to being up almost 24hrs yesterday.  Did get up for a bit and was online.  Today isn't looking too much more energy producing but then again it really doesn't have to.  No kids and cats love to sleep on hot days. Have a great nap everyone.   For those that do not wish to read sexual content - stop now.     Those that are married and keep hitting on me - please stop it.  As much as I like "fun" I also like to have a person that can be with me instead of having to go home to another.  Here's a clue for anyone:  I want to be with someone that loves to have fun, likes the outdoors, loves to travel and be adventurous.  First and foremost, the person has to already be single.  Not married. Not in the process of a divorce.  Not engaged to another.  Current status has to be:  completely single.  I know it can be annoying but deal with. It's what I want and I almost always get what I want.   Question:  What irks you the most?
