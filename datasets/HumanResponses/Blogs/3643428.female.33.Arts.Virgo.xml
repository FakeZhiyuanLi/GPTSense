      Recently I came to the revelation that my glass is half full. Half full of piss. Well at least I'm still seeing it as half full. I gave up Coke a cola and my favorite extra extra strong, super sweet iced coffee.  I've taken up caffeine pills, and I miss sugar.  Something had to be done, I am simply too fat for my own comfort. It makes it easier to forsake something (someone) when it's for your own benefit. So good-bye soda and sweets hello water and healthy food, I'm hoping I'll feel like exercising when some weight comes off. I certainly feel no energy to do it now. I'm hoping it's just the caffeine and sugar withdrawal cause I haven't felt this lazy in years. I think I'll take a shower and see if I can shake this malaise.

      "Thank You for not yelling at me or calling me names tonight," this comes out of my mouth? His reply "I don't ever want to be like that again" He goes on to tell me "We saw a movie on domestic violence today" I look at him, what is he going to say. "I realize how close I came." Well, I think, that's a start.  "Did you see you could have ended up in jail?"  I asked "Yeah" he sighed. I waited for I'm sorry. Waited. Waited. He's not going to apologize. I'll start it off "I think I'm to blame partially my mom was abusive so that's why I 'm more comfortable in abusive relationships"  "He relates a story of a really beautiful women he knew who had once told him the same thing about her husband. "She egged him on." "I feel you sometimes egg me on" I want to scream, "No! You are the problem asshole." I don't. I have learned that I am encouraging this abuse, even if it is unconscious. I think back to the 5 serious relationships I'd been in before we met.  They were jerks, excluding one, and I lost interest. I didn't know how to function not being called names and "punished". It's so masochistic. I couldnâ€™t get away fast enough. "That's why I want to go to a counselor," there I said it.  He gets nervous when I mention a counselor. No fear I continue, "Yeah, and I'll have to go at night so you can watch our child."  He doesn't argue.  I need to schedule an appointment.  I am skeptically hopeful.

      I've been pondering getting away from it all. It seems so romantic-dramatic. A women and her son on their own. Leaving town and running away. I have fantasies all the time of leaving him. Unfortunately I am too much of a realist and I know that these are just pipe dreams. I have no job, no car, no drivers license, no form of picture id, no birth certificate but, i still have a social security card, halalulah. No money. No family either. 2 friends I could rely on except, they are going through their own messes.  i am fat and ugly and dumb, dumb, dumb. i feel like such an ass, all these regrets and i know regretting doesn't do a damn bit of good. Regrets I have a few and here they are for you to peruse. Now keep in mind I did it my way....  1. When my husband was saying our son wasn't his after i delivered. It must have been the drugs but I argued and insisted he was the father. Mistake, Big mistake. I wish I would have said "You're right this isn't your baby. I screwed so many guys I'll never know who my baby's daddy is."   2. Marrying my husband. Enough said  3. Being scared of said husband.  4. Not moving out for good the night he pulled a knife on one of my friends.  I may list more regrets later, I have to stop now I'm getting depressed.

      My husband calls me names and I don't even hear them anymore but, my son does. He's calling me the same names; dumb bitch, stupid bitch, and fat bitch. He's only two, soon his vocabulary will expand and he'll learn more. I can't wash his words away it's not his fault, so what can I do? Well, I've already figured out that I'm attracted to abusers, thanks mom. But what can I do to keep the pattern from repeating? I must keep my son away from abusers.   I think of my own father and what shelter he offered me against my mothers abuse, what advice had my dear sweet father given me. He had told me repeatedly... "Don't argue with your mother, she'll never admit she's wrong" "It doesn't matter what other people think, it matters what you think" "Don't try to reason with ignorance, stupidity or insanity" "If you debate someone they migtht change your opinion but, nine outta ten times, you won't change their mind." That's what you said when I came to you frustrated, wanting you to stand up for me, but you didn't. You're a turn the other cheek type dad. I'm turning daddy, but I keep getting slapped.   I'm looking for an old testament daddy now

      I was feeling so sad and desperate, so very lonely. There was no one to talk to, so I got on my knees and prayed. Asking God to expand my social circle, asking him to deliver me from loneliness. And I heard Him say "I give you the world".    God's will has brought me to you all.  Be forewarned I like all people am different.  My views, ideas, and language choices may perhaps offend. Eso no fue mi intencion. I can assure you if I was privy to your deepest thoughts and feelings surely some of those ideas I'd find vile and reprehensible as well.  But, since we all have sterling intentions, we can hopefully try not to judge each other too harshly.
