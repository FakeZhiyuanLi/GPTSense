         Strider's Thoughts...    Re: Jaymee's tag -   jme: dear SH, this blog seems like it's just 4 boys... where are all the girls?    Dear  Jaymee ,  In response to your question, " where are all the girls?" ...I ask myself the same question every time I set foot in prayer meeting, or at St. Pius, for that matter. I think they are all at other communities that are  not  named 'Servant's Heart'. Stop me if I'm lying...   Strider's favorite SH moment(s):    #1 - At the mission trip (circa 2002 A.D.), the boys of UPRM formed MEGAROOM. While I was down and out, they came over me like guardian angels for a savage group hug. You just had to be there...  #2 - Holy Spirit Saturday (Youth Alpha circa 2003 A.D.), during lunch break, the boys in the band were playing cover tunes for fun. Then, several teenie boppers of the female variety (dudes don't count) came over to hear us play. They were groovin' to the music. They said we were tight. That was my first time experiencing "groupies" or "backstage betties" of any sort. Playing for the SOL Spirit Rally (circa 2003 A.D.) was the other time.

         Dear Abby. . .err. . Robby Column    DEAR  robby :   I am in my early teens and have mood swings. I assume everybody has them, but I have had mine nearly every day for the past five months. One minute I will be laughing about something, the next minute I get "down in the dumps." I can feel happy and sad at the same time.   I haven't told anybody about how I feel -- not even my parents. I need to know if this is a real problem, or if this is a part of "growing up." Please help.   --  CONFUSED  TEEN   Dear  CONFUSED TEEN :  wow you really are a teenager with all your mood swings.  let me tell you this though. . .  it's not healthy to have mood swings all the time.  if i were u, i'd talk to someone close to you about issues that make u happy or sad.    and how can u be happy and sad at the same time?  my my u must really have a problem.    i'll tell u one thing though. . . GROW UP!  suck it up, and don't be emo!  it's just full of negative energy and frankly, i'm getting it! YUCK!  freakin contagious!  bottom line, don't be emo. .  and watch a lot of politics.  -- robby    if you would like to write to 'dear robby', e-mail him at robbymoya@hotmail.com

          "Guess what? I heard that...."     Hello  SH ,  This is my first entry to the community blog. Thanks for having me. I'm now one of the columnists for  "so what do you think about..."  I hope to give you readers the good stuff to keep you entertained. You are already familiar with my writing style in my daily column,  urlLink "The Daily Mishaps of Strider the Ranger" . I reserve my daily banter and wit for my blog. For  this  blog, I have been assigned by the administrator to be the beat writer for the latest  SH  gossip. Fred Perdito,  SH  Gossip Columnist...I like the sound of that. From now on, I will title each entry   "Did you hear?"   That way, the readers will recognize right off the bat that it's a juicy entry.  Since I now have DSL, I can give you the scoop any time, anywhere, so watch out! There's always a good story to be had out there, you just have to look for it. In some cases, you just have to stretch the truth a little. Remember this saying? ..."It may not be entirely true...but hey, it makes for a better story!"  I can't be in two places at the same time, so I'm going to need all of your help. This is a community effort. If you have a juicy story, then email me, call me, or chat with me online. I will keep your identity anonymous, if need be. In a show of good will, I will kick off my new column with the scoop on myself...    "DID YOU HEAR?"   -  Fred  is going to the YFC "prom" this Friday. He's been hanging out with this girl named  Julie  lately, but he has a blind date for the "prom".  Julie  actually set him up with this date. What's that all about? All I gotta say is, come "prom" time, watch out! Something may go down, and it ain't the Titanic!  Fred's  friend,  Analie , is trying to get him to meet her coworker,  Kristel . I heard she is active at St. Lucy. Hmm, I don't know. What's up with all these blind dates? This could lead to trouble. But you know what, I ain't hatin'. That's all the scoop I have on  Fred  today.

       hi everyone, and welcome to iservantsheart.blogspot.com.  there's not much to write about right now, so i'll leave you a letter from Maurice King.  it's a message about his convertion to our catholic faith.  have fun reading it!  March 27, 2001     Dear Friend,     I find myself writing this letter because I have come to a point in my life where I am making a big step and want to share my good news with you.  On April 14th of this year I will be fully welcomed into the Catholic Church.  It is amazing where God leads because this is the last place I thought I would be.  I never thought I would be the kind of guy to look forward to mass every Sunday, or attend more than once a week.  I never expected to be active in the church and part of different ministries to help serve my community.  I believe in the Catholic Church, I believe in the sacraments of the Catholic Church.              For years I denounced the faith and its teachings.  Three years ago I would have told you Catholics were very ritualistic and out of touch in today’s society.  But, when I look back at the past few years I realize God has put circumstances and people in my life to bring me where I am today.  I have been going to Saint Pius V the last five years.  This was merely out of convenience.  It was ten minutes away, and one hour long—coming up in a Baptist faith where it was one or more hours, that was fine with me.  I didn’t care.  I believed you didn’t have to go to church to talk to God.  I was just as good as someone who attended every Sunday.  I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior that was enough.              Last year, on a Tuesday night, I went to a prayer meeting through the invitation of Emeline Soratorio (who previously asked 15 times before).  My intention was to go that one night only and say, “Emeline, I went.”  The focus of that prayer meeting was the assumption of our Blessed Mother.  God really convicted me that night by opening my heart and allowing me to listen to the words of the speakers.  The reverence that Catholics had for Mother Mary was explained so eloquently and sparked my curiosity on other questions I had about the Catholic Church.  I began to read books, I listened to tapes, and I also asked other Catholics about their faith.  As I continued to go to mass I began to see the devotion of the parishioners there.  For the first time in my life, church became crucial to me and I had to find out the reason for their devotion.              I wish I could say at that moment my eyes were opened and I saw God staring at me.  I would love to tell you that I told God I chose Him and will now follow Him from that point on.  But the truth is, I fought Him every step of the way. I would ignore conversations about the Catholic faith and put off invitations by priests to be initiated into it.  One night a friend of mine (Robby), invited me to attend an apologetics program.  The focus of that program was to attain a better knowledge of Catholicism and its doctrines.  His dad, who was and is a crucial part of my conversion (praise God for you, Tito Jess), taught the course.              When the invitation was first offered I declined.  I made excuses and prioritized everything else (I even put playing softball with friends before apologetics).  A part of me did not want to accept the Catholic faith because of my pride for my Baptist roots.  But God had other plans.  His first act gave me a work schedule with split days off (Sunday for mass and Thursday for apologetics).  His second act canceled my commitment to softball, by canceling my league.  And without anymore valid excuses I found myself accepting the invitation.  God really spoke to me through Tito Jess in that course.  My questions were answered and my doubts were calmed.  My heart was really humbled and my outlook changed.  Which inspired me to fully join the Catholic Church.              As I look back I can see how God led me to Him.  I don’t think it was a coincidence that when I moved out here six years ago, the Lord placed me to live with my Catholic aunt, that I met a Catholic girl who brought me to mass almost every Sunday for the past five years.  I don’t think it was a coincidence that I attended the Alpha course in ’98 to rebuild my faith in Jesus.  And through that course I met the priest who not only married me, but also leads me through my initiation into the faith.  I believe the Lord led me to these things and to the prayer meeting which explained our love for our Holy Mother Mary.              Writing this letter is emotionally gratifying for me because I am able to thank those who helped me along the way.  Thank you to my mom, my grandma and my aunts and uncles.  For instilling Christianity in me and planting the seed that has grown tremendously through the past two years.   Also, thank you to the Lopez family for your compassion, love, patience and support during my search for the truth.  To all my friends, thank you for being there for me, for allowing me to be myself and accepting me for who I am and who I have become.  I would like to extend my gratitude to my SPV family, for your guidance, wisdom, and love; you truly are an inspiration!  Special thanks to Father Fogarty for giving me the tools to strengthen my faith.  Thank you Jaymee for your constant prayers for my soul.  Thank you Emeline for always inviting me to church.  Thank you Fred and Robby for walking with me and holding my hand.  Tito Jess, thank you for answering God’s call, so that my soul may be saved.  For the many I didn't mention, I have not forgotten you, and will be eternally grateful for the many blessings you all have placed on me.              Above all, Thank you Father God for calling me home to the true church; for sending Ahlauna to teach us to love as you love—unconditionally.  Thank you Lord Jesus for dying for me, for saving my soul, taking my sins, so that I may come to know God.  Thank you Holy Spirit for embracing me with your love and warmth.  Thank you Holy Spirit for your gifts.  Mother Mary; thank you for your example of extraordinary faith and many endless prayers.  Thank you all the martyrs and saints for exemplifying to me what true Christianity is.               On April 14, 2001 when I receive the rites for communion, I do not see it as the end of my journey, but as the beginning; the start of my new life, with Christ as the head, leading me into the glory of Heaven.  I write this letter to you not to praise myself or so that I may be praised, but to emphasize the power of God almighty.  He had made changes in me I would never have foreseen.  My testimony is a great example of God’s love for sinners.  April 14th will be very important to me and I would like to share it with those I love.  If you can attend the Mass on Saturday at 8 p.m., I would be extremely honored, if you are unable to, please remember me in your prayers.     May the Lord bless you and keep you close to Him always,     Maurice D. King         GO SERVANT'S HEART!!!!    i'm outs. . .

           (L-R: Jay Casteneda, Michael Tandiama, Fred Perdito)   On behalf of New Line Cinema and the cast of LOTR, we wish SH a very Merry Christmas from Middle-Earth!   Yes! I'm the first person to wish the community a Merry Christmas on the SH blog! I'm sure some of you are either at midnight Mass or coming back from church. I just came back from 10pm Mass at St. Barnabas. Sorry to say, the "mystery girl" wasn't there. But there  will  be a next time, and I must do something about it, or else  Rob  will kick my you know what. I hope everyone is doing well this Christmas season. Have a great time with family on Christmas day. I may not see most of you in quite a long time, so be safe and merry. Wait for my return on the eve of February. Look towards the west...

       Food for thought...  As people of God we have a claim to the joy and the peace that the birth of Christ brings to the world. But how do I personally enter into this "great joy" of Christmas? Christmas rings out "joy to the world," yes, but how do I make this joy my own? This is an important question, for, even though God has declared joy to the whole world, there are still many among us who do not flow in this joy, man among us who do not know how to claim this joy and make it their own personally. J.O.Y.=Jesus Others You, so let us do wha we can to put Jesus before ourselves!

       hey sh peeps. . .  today is the feast day for  Our Lady of Guadalupe .  so here's something for you to read.        Our Lady of Guadalupe  December 12 (USA) When we reflect on the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe we learn two important lessons, one of faith and one of understanding.   Missionaries who first came to Mexico with the conquistadors had little success in the beginning. After nearly a generation, only a few hundred Native Mexicans had converted to the Christian faith. Whether they simply did not understand what the missionaries had to offer or whether they resented these people who made them slaves, Christianity was not popular among the native people.   Then in 1531 miracles began to happen. Jesus' own mother appeared to humble Juan Diego. The signs -- of the roses, of the uncle miraculously cured of a deadly illness, and especially of her beautiful image on Juan's mantle -- convinced the people there was something to be considered in Christianity. Within a short time, six million Native Mexicans had themselves baptized as Christians.   The first lesson is that God has chosen Mary to lead us to Jesus. No matter what critics may say of the devotion of Mexicans (and Mexican descendants) to Our Lady of Guadalupe, they owe their Christianity to her influence. If it were not for her, they would not know her son, and so they are eternally grateful. The second lesson we take from Mary herself. Mary appeared to Juan Diego not as a European madonna but as a beautiful Aztec princess speaking to him in his own Aztec language. If we want to help someone appreciate the gospel we bring, we must appreciate the culture and the mentality in which they live their lives. By understanding them, we can help them to understand and know Christ. Our Lady of Guadalupe is patron of the Americas.

           "...by the power of a spirit, and through the ministry of some church, I absolve you of all your V2 sins..."    Ah yes, V2. Good times, good times. BTW, my V2 site is up and running again. Just look in my  urlLink blog  for the link. This pic was taken Sunday morning. We made a makeshift confessional with chairs. We used towels for the screen. As you can see,  Rob  is making a good confession to me.  Jeanne  and  JFish  did as well. As a matter of fact,  JFish  and  Jeanne  did a group confession. They all needed the sacrament of reconciliation because of the V2 weekend shenanigans. Praise  God , they were all able to take communion later on that morning at Mass. Just another precious SH moment. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did...

           PRAYER NATION     I must give credit to  Elliot  for coining the term for SH's "Prayer Nation". I find it very clever. It is analagous to the "Raider Nation". Let me explain...The Oakland Raiders have a loyal fan base arcoss the nation. It seems like there are Raider fans anywhere you go, sporting the silver and black. Maybe it's the Raider  mystique , maybe it's the cool colors, I don't know. In any case, all Raider fans come together to form the nation. So it is with SH. Anywhere we go, we are part of the Prayer  Nation . Kudos to  Elliot  for his literary creativity. Kudos to  Rob  for hiring him as one of SH's columnists. (BTW, nice plug for the CreamyCenter...)   YOU KNOW WHAAATTT?!?!  I was at the SH meeting to see the return of  Tito Tom . I don't agree that saying "Happy Holidays" is as politically correct or secular as he makes it out to be. Think about the phrase...Happy  Holidays . The word, "holiday" is derived from the words  "holy day" . We are celebrating a holy day of Christmas, are we not? The most "PC" and secular way to bastardize Christmas is to say,  "Season's Greetings" . Why? Because you are just telling people how happy you are that it's winter. Well la dee freakin' da!    ~PRAYER ALERT!~   Congrats to  Elliot  on landing that job. His  "Prayer Alert"  to the  Nation  worked wonders. I've noticed that various people in the community have asked the  Nation  to pray for on their behalf as of late, and  God  has come through on those prayers. I have a few prayers of my own. It's time to put the  Nation  to the test. Here I go...   I pray for decent full-time work. I prefer it to be in education, business, or technology. That way, I can afford to get that Cadillac Escalade with the chromed-out nose and 22-inch wheels spinnin', although the ride has stopped. Okay, n/m, I just want decent work.  I pray for a hot babe by my side, to compl e ment (not to be confused with  compl i ment , which has a different definition. Look it up...) my rugged handsomeness, athletecism, wit, and charm. It would be nice if she was musically inclined, so she could sing/play for me. If that's asking too much, then her being absolutely hot would suffice.  I pray that  God  send more musicians of the female variety to our ministry. Other communities have them, why can't we??  All we can do now is wait and see the results of my prayers, with the intercession of the  Nation . Come on, baby!

       Greetings, Prayer Nation.  Elliot here to give you Part II of my  Annual ChristmasTime Blog .  Yesterday I was at the SPV prayer meeting and played along with Fred in front of a whopping  12 people .  Those of you who weren't there missed a big one, as it marked  The Return of Tito Tom  (good to see him back).  He did bring up a very interesting point that suggests that we go against political correctness and wish  Everybody  this season a  Merry Christmas  instead of  Happy Holidays , which somehow became the PC way of greeting people.  I stopped to think about this, and I realized just how silly it really is to label  Merry Christmas  as un-PC.  SO WHAT if you're Jewish, Muslim, Bhuddist, Scientologist, or Atheist and I tell you  Merry Christmas , a greeting with a good-willed sentiment.  If you find offense in something as harmless as that, then maybe you should consider the following:  * If you have a job and you take a day off on Dec.25 while you accept Holiday pay from your employer.  Or if you do work that day, but accept the time-and-a-half pay rate that's standard with working on holidays, then you are observing Christmas Day.  Therefore  Merry Christmas  would be a valid greeting, regardless of your faith.  * If you have experienced any of the joy that goes with the overall Christmas spirit, then  Merry Christmas  applies to you as well.  A few examples; when you watch a Christmas themed movie or TV show and enjoyed it, when a previously estranged relative or friend gathers enough heart and courage to call you this time of year, or if you're a recepient of any random act of kindness.  * Even if the above mentioned points don't apply to you, keep in mind that Christmas Day  is  December 25.  Therefore, at the very least, when someone says  Merry Christmas  they're basically just wishing that you  Have a Nice Day  on December 25.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Likewise, if a Jewish person says to me  Happy Hanukkah  I won't have any problem with that.  Hanukkah is eight days, and if someone wants to wish that those eight days would be GOOD to me, then let em.  God forbid someone wishes for me to have eight BAD days! AGH!  So with that said, have a  Merry Christmas!   [This is Part II of my ChristmasTime blog.  Part I is in my main blogsite, which you can see by clicking  urlLink here ]

Mayerline suffers from Wegner's disease and because of that illness, she has lost both of her kidneys and currently she is on dialysis and chemo. She is very depressed and feeling blue as the Holidays are approaching...Mayerline was working part-time, but now due to chemo she is no longer working. Money is pretty scarce. She has a years old boy, Cris. Mayerline does not like to ask for anything, but i know she will be very happy if you suprise her w/something.  God bless you,  Please keep this family in your prayers, please pray for healing and peace for mayerline. If youd like to help the family out the mom of mayerline also gave me mayerline's address.   Thanks! Rossana

       food for thought. . .   u know i was just thinking about how much fun i had this weekend caroling with SH.  for the past 6 years that i've been with this group, i have to say that caroling in december has always been a time to look foward to.    back in '98, we would extend our services to the buena park convalescent home (western and crescent).  now it's like we go to different households and sing and stuff.  my my how things evolve.  praise God that He gave us the talents to show others what He gave us as a community.    i wonder if the boys can do a special song number entitled 'let it snow'  by Boyz II Men haha!  though it's not really a christmas christian song, it does boost up ratings.  haha!

We thank you for all your support. You fans have been great. In return, we want to show our appreciation by inviting your community to an advanced screening of the last film in the series,  Return of the King . We spent 4 years filming in New Zealand in fantastic locations. When we finished shooting this year, it was time to say goodbye to fellow cast members and crew.

Come join us at the red carpet viewing of  Return of the King  on Wednesday, December 17th at Cerritos Towne Centre. All SH members get free admission and souvenir gifts. Showtime starts at 7pm.

              ~~Prayer Alert!!~~Prayer Alert!!~~Prayer Alert!!~~Prayer Alert!!~~Prayer Alert!!~~Prayer Alert!!~~Prayer Alert!!~~Prayer Alert!!~~Prayer Alert!!   Hey everybody, Elliot here.  I hope nobody minds me borrowing the Prayer Alert marquee thingy.  But anyway, tomorrow in the afternoon I have a job interview with Contiki Holidays in Anaheim for a staff accoutant position.  I've been out of work for some time now, and landing this job during this time of year would be MOST EXCELLENT.  Also, obtaining this job might lead to a possible migration for me to  The O.C.  (I'm talking aboot the actual county, not that silly TV drama on FOX).  Therefore if you all can take a few seconds tonight to pray for me and for God to carry me to a five-star interview, then I'll really appreciate it.  I'd figure that with the SH community and their prayers on my side, then I won't be needing no stinkin' luck.  Thanks in advance.

       the mission trip to sd was one of my most favorite sh moments.  u know when i was looking at the sh website, i was reminiscing of how powerful this picture was. . .        i loved how sh came together and started to genuflect on the statue of Mother Mary holding Jesus.  what makes this special to me?  well, being a protestant for many years, u were told not to genuflect on statues since it's nothing more but stone, in this case bronze.  nevertheless, i saw the hearts of a faithful catholic community come together to reflect on the statue and be 'in the moment' with our blessed Mother and Lord.  pictures may only tell a fragment of the story, i guess u had to be there to understand the power of the sculpture.  u had to just feel Jesus' and Mama Mary's face with your hands. . u had to just stare at the eyes of Mama Mary to see the agony that her son died, but the understanding and submission in her expression that this was the only way to save us from sin.  u had to see the tired look of Jesus' face, having the appearance that truly, 'it is finished'.  it makes me cry to see that picture and reflect on it, but it was even more emotional when everyone was around that.  it just makes u wanna do good u know?  in any case, that was one of the best moments!!  i liked fred's moment too (scroll down).  i love mission trips because there's always something to gain from each one that we go to!  goooooooo mission trip!!!!        mission trip + sh = ratings!!&nbsp;

I've been asked to speak at Youth Alpha this coming Tuesday. I think I'm the first guest speaker in the series. My mind knows what to say, but my spirit is far behind. Please pray that  God  gives me just enough to get by that night. More to come...  - Fred Perdito SH Minister of Music Defense

         Gondor calls...    Hey folks. Some of you may already know that I'm leading prayer meeting for the first time this coming TUE Feb 3. Obviously, I'll be playing music at the same time. I don't know how well it's going to work out, so I'm asking for help. I need the help of any musicians and singers. I would like to have your prayers for that night as well. I will let the Spirit guide me that night. That's about as simple as I can make it. I knew this day would come. I knew I had to lead a prayer meeting at some point, just didn't know exactly when. The beacons are lit. Gondor calls for aid once again. Who will answer?

       thought u guys would find this interesting...   Aide: Pope did not endorse Gibson film   ROME, Italy (Reuters) -- In the latest twist in a saga involving the Vatican and Mel Gibson's controversial film about the death of Christ, Pope John Paul II's closest aide has denied reports the pontiff had praised the film's Biblical accuracy.   Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, the pope's long-time private secretary, told the Catholic News Service Monday: "The Holy Father told no one of his opinion of this film."   In the past seven weeks, major world media organizations have written reports based on Church sources saying the pope liked the film and that he told aides that it was an accurate portrayal of Biblical accounts of Christ's final hours.   "The Passion of the Christ" is based on Gospel narratives and contains dialogue only in Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic, the vernacular of ancient Palestine. It opens on Ash Wednesday, February 25.   The movie, which covers the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ, has come under fire from some Jewish groups that fear its story could foment anti-Semitism because it portrays Jewish authorities as largely responsible for Christ's death.   Dziwisz issued his denial after weeks of reports that the pope had told aides after seeing the film: "It is as it was."   Dziwisz told Catholic News Service: "The Holy Father saw the film privately in his apartment, but gave no declaration to anyone. He does not make judgments on art of this kind. He leaves that to others, to experts."   Supporters had seen the words attributed to the pope as an endorsement of the film's Biblical accuracy, but some Jews worried that they could harm Roman Catholic-Jewish relations.   On Sunday, columnist Frank Rich of the New York Times, who is Jewish, accused the film's producers of "roping him (the pope) into a publicity campaign to sell a movie."   Vatican spokesmen have repeatedly declined officially to confirm or deny the numerous reports over the past month.   Some Catholic and other Christian groups have defended the film, saying it sticks closely to accounts of the crucifixion as told in the New Testament.   The film has been shown to a select audience of Catholic officials in several private screenings in recent weeks.   Many Vatican officials have seen it in whole or part and have rejected charges that it is anti-Semitic.   Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos, head of the Vatican department in charge of priests, said in September: "I would gladly trade some of the homilies that I have given about the passion of Christ for even a few of the scenes of his film."   Gibson reportedly paid $20 million to $25 million of his own money to make the movie, but despite his status as a top box office draw and Oscar winner, Hollywood's major studios shied away from distributing it because of the controversy.   Gibson is a member of a traditionalist Roman Catholic group that rejects some of the reforms of the Second Vatican Council and still uses the old-style Latin Mass.

          The Ranger Returns     I haven't written here in a while. Nice to be back. I'm excited for SH this coming year. After talking with JFish, I believe NOW is the time to start the SH rebuilding process. It starts with the Church history talks with Tito Jess.  FYI:  I'm going to lead prayer meeting for the first time on February 3rd. Mark your calendars for the return of the ranger. March has a Spirit Rally from Liwanag AND Rivendell (SOL). It can be argued that Liwanag could be Rivendell as well, with their abundance of "elves". Then in April/May, we will have a youth/young-adult LSS...finally! I think the numbers will be greater than our last youth LSS. JFish has done good work in contacting other communities. I've been along for the ride, and it's just getting started. Then June is the month of birthdays. A lot of the Church's catechists were born in June: Tito Jess, Rob, Maurice, and myself. July is of course the great white wedding in Maui. Can we sneak in a V3 trip somewhere. Okay, I'll stop looking too far ahead. We have much to do. The beacons are lit. Gondor calls. ROHIRRIM!

       u know i was just watching heaven sent doing the turn around (suicide) skit last nite, and i have to say, everytime i see it i can't help but reflect on how Jesus is so awesome.  the last scene is always the best when he takes all the sins away from the girl and puts it on himself.  dude, that is LOVE in action right there.   jason  has this awesome bible diary book that he carries all the time.  i want one, but he said he's not going to give me one.  so now, i can't learn about God, and get closer to Him.  how sad, God will surely keep him accountable since he's not going to buy me one.  kawawa meeeeeeee! hahahaha! =)

       hey u all, here's an article from the la times about the church. FYI   90% of Dioceses Meet New Rules  By Larry B. Stammer and and Richard Winton, Times Staff Writers  All but 10% of the nation's 194 Roman Catholic dioceses have fully complied with rules and safeguards to prevent sexual abuse of minors by priests, the church's watchdog office reported today in the aftermath of a scandal that has rocked the U.S. church for the last two years.  The much-anticipated report said that bishops have made significant progress in implementing "zero tolerance" regulations as required under a national church charter on sexual abuse adopted in June 2002.  But the document declared that 20 Catholic dioceses and Eastern Rite Catholic districts, all outside of California, had not made enough changes, and urged the nation's bishops to take corrective action there.  In most cases, those 20 dioceses, including Anchorage, Honolulu, Omaha and New York, had not established formal codes of conduct, not developed classes for parents on how to spot signs of sexual abuse, or not properly started background checks for priests and other church employees, according to the report.  Leaders of sexual abuse victims' support groups said they were skeptical about what they believed would be the report's mainly upbeat conclusions, although they had not yet seen it.  At a news conference Monday in Los Angeles and in a statement issued in St. Louis, leaders of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests alleged that the audit would be "fundamentally flawed." They said few victims were interviewed by auditors.  The audit was conducted by 54 investigators — many of them former FBI agents — employed by the Gavin Group Inc. of Boston, headed by retired FBI official William Gavin. Undertaken at a cost to the church of $1.8.million, the audits were carried out primarily from June 23 to Oct. 31.  A separate investigation is seeking to determine the number of sexual abuse cases and abusive clergy around the country since 1950. Those results, which could be far more explosive as the church seeks to restore its credibility, are scheduled to be announced next month by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.  This week's report called for annual audits of the nation's Catholic dioceses and their similar Eastern Rite jurisdictions, known as eparchies, and a yearly up-to-date accounting of the number of priests and deacons accused of sexually molesting minors. It also called for greater efforts by the church to track down and help bring to justice priests who have fled after accusations of sexual abuse.  "Neither this audit process nor the full and complete implementation of the charter will provide a total guarantee that there will never be another case of child or youth sexual abuse committed by a member of the Catholic clergy," the report states. "However, the continuous efforts of bishops, eparches, clergy, religious, and the laity to address this problem will foster a greater degree of confidence that children and young people will be safe and secure in environments in the Catholic Church of the United States."  Katheen McChesney, executive director of the national Catholic Church's Office of Child and Youth Protection and a former high-ranking FBI official, said in a letter accompanying the report that bishops had done much since the charter was adopted in Dallas. But she served notice that "there are many ways to more effectively and efficiently implement the charter."  Victims and prosecutors, however, said the report would give an unmerited positive impression at a time when many lawsuits alleging sex abuse by priests are awaiting trials.  "We have one simple question: Where is the truth? Every diocese was asked to report on sexual abuse. Wouldn't it make sense to ask us, the victims, to help create and augment the data the auditors are submitting to the council of bishops? Only three of us were included," Joelle CasteixÖ, a former member of a board that reviewed sexual abuse cases in the Orange County diocese, told reporters at a news conference outside the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles.  The report, while not specifying how many victims were interviewed, urged that more be involved in the reforms in the future. The charter forbids a diocese to transfer an abusive priest to another diocese. But the report said auditors were unable to view personnel files to verify that every diocese was following that mandate. Instead, auditors "relied primarily on the information provided by the diocese/eparchy."  That requirement is one that has attracted special interest in Boston and San Bernardino. In the Boston archdiocese, the late former priest John J. Geoghan was transferred from parish to parish while he continued to molest boys. Geoghan's transfers became public in 2002, and eventually forced Cardinal Bernard Law to resign as archbishop of Boston. Geoghan was later convicted of abusing a boy and sent to prison, where he was murdered killed by another inmate last year.  The Boston archdiocese also transferred another accused priest, Paul R. Shanley, to the San Bernardino diocese. Instead of warning the Southern California church about Shanley's background, it gave him a glowing recommendation.  The charter is built around a "zero tolerance" policy on sexual abuse, and requires the removal of abusive priests and deacons from the Catholic ministry. Among its mandatory safeguards are local review boards, composed of lay members and clergy. Initially, 57 dioceses were said to be out of compliance with the charter. By Dec. 12, all but 20 had made enough improvements, according to the report. It commended 129 dioceses, or 68% of the total, including Los Angeles, for their efforts in addressing sexual abuse.  The Los Angeles archdiocese, which faces an estimated 500 civil lawsuits brought by alleged victims and is the subject of a criminal grand jury investigation, got high marks in the new report for putting a sexual abuse prevention policy in place years before the national scandal broke in January 2001.  The report also applauded the Los Angeles archdiocese for creating a sexual abuse advisory board in 1994, although victims said that it was an ineffective body. The report noted, however, that the Los Angeles archdiocese needed a written policy on how to "properly report and record allegations of sexual abuse of minors to public authorities."  Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, the Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles, said Monday that he agreed with that recommendation, and had implemented it in September. He insisted that the archdiocese had "always complied fully" with mandatory reporting laws, but that the reporting was "informal" and no central records were kept. Since September, he said there has been a central log, maintained by the archdiocese's general counsel.  Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said Monday that his office had spent months in court using subpoenas to obtain archdiocese records on priests accused of abuse.  The grand jury-based proceedings are not public, but are ongoing by Cooley's account. "We are still in litigation with the archdiocese," he said. "Cooperation has not been genuine to date. We are still trying to obtain records relevant to criminality."  The archdiocese said it has turned over all the record to a judge, who is to decide which can be properly forwarded to Cooley.  Mahony said Monday that the audit and report had vindicated the archdiocese. He said its priorities are "are to make sure the church is safe for children and young people and, secondly, that we are committed to reaching out to all victims of sexual abuse and to assist them with pastoral counseling, whatever they need. I think those two priorities are confirmed in this audit report."  Bishop Wilton D. Gregory of Belleville, Ill., president of the U.S. bishops conference, said his organization had made "a tremendous effort" to protect children from predator priests. "This is a challenge that we must face with complete commitment," he said in written remarks accompanying the report. "For children to be harmed by ministers of the church is directly contrary to the command of Christ himself while he walked the face of the Earth "  Of the 194 dioceses, three were not audited. The Diocese of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands and the Armenian Exarchate of New York had scheduling conflicts. The Diocese of Davenport, Iowa, was not audited because it is involved in ongoing litigation.

       Okay, SHers and fellow bloggers, I have to come out of my blog-world hiatus and make an exception because I ran across this beautiful meditation in my Magnificat tonight before going to sleep.  It goes hand in hand with Jay's UPRM picture and the greatest Beatitude of all...   THE GREAT LIGHT   Now eyes see better in the light of love.   Ubi amor ibi oculus .  Charity, the supernatural love of God and neighbor that perfects the will, refines and elevates the natural seeing of the mind.  The self-absorbed man will glimpse nothing but reflections of himself in the waters of reality, but the self-giving man, the man taken out of himself, and plunged into the charity of the Trinity, will let things have their own light and delight.  A man without the spiritual beauty of temperance will be too blinded by his passions to perceive the many-splendored thing; he will tend, for example, to see the body, not as a sacrament, the expressive incarnation of the spiritual soul and thus of the person, but as a machine for obtaining pleasure.  By contrast, the pure in heart will have eyes that are clear and unclouded.  The poet must gaze on God's world with wonder and humility.  He must be, or become again, a little child.  The man of the world, who has "seen and done it all" and lost his capacity for hope and surprise, cannot be a poet.  Or rather, to be a poet, he must first be reborn.  The emptiness of the experience must be filled up with the richness of restored innocence.   - John Saward   May God carry out in us what is pleasing to Him through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever.  Amen.

       happy new year sh!!!  you guys are awesome, and i can't wait to see all u all this thuesday in pg.  hey  jay , that was an awesome post on what a servants heart person is suppose to be.  i think that's a great way to start the new year.   u know me and  emeline  went to st. irenaus yesterday for mass.  i have to admit, it was an awesome mass.  ok, first off, i didn't know that there was a 'life teen' mass every sunday @ 5 thurr.  it was really kool, the band was awesome (emeline said they usually sound better on other days, which i'm sure is true).  the best part was when all the teenagers came together on the alter and surrounded the priest as he concecrated the host.  it was a site to see that these young people get to be closest to Christ at the most important time.  i guess u need to go one time to exp that.   well new year's is great because it's renewal (haha hey boys 'renewal'! haha).  it's time to refocus and concentrate on Jesus even more.    ok all, i'll see u tomorrow.  start posting up again hurr and give it ratings.   jaymee  and  maurice , i don't know why it's not sending u the invite to write hurr.  i've done it countless times, and i'll try it again right now.  hopefully it works this time out.   i'm outs. . .

Let it begin with a "Yes" and I pray, no, we pray that it may never end.   Random Thought:  We all know that when we pray, it is having a conversation with Our Lord.  Just like you and I talk to each other on the phone, prayer is our "telephone" to God.  Many of us, including myself, at one time or another, have came before Our Lord asking Him, begging Him, crying to Him to give us a reason for the trials we go through, the daily crosses He asks us to carry.  We do our talking from the end of our "phone," but do we open not our ears but our hearts to hear His reply? Do we hang up the "phone" before He answers?  My co-worker told me a few months ago that worrying is a sin.  Now, to me, that's a little rough because we, as humans, worry all the time.  However, I do agree when he puts worrying and sin in the same category.  Worrying, anxiety, doubt etc. are not from God, just as sin.  Thus we seek, in prayer, to counter these by praying for His Grace, for His Patience, for His Humility and His Love.  In today's Homily, the priest spoke of friendship and how Jesus considered His disciples friends not servants.  Whether you are a spouse, boyfriend/girlfriend, friend, sibling, co-worker....in any relationship, it takes COMMUNICATION, openness, being able to think aloud and say what's on your mind, being willing to help the best way you can...and there are many, many, many other things that is what takes to make relationship work.  Prayer is our "communication" to God; our "cell phone", if you will, since we can take prayer wherever we go.  In conclusion, since we are children and closest friends of God let us do our part to know, love and serve Him. "I do not know what tomorrow holds, but I will always smile because I know who holds tomorrow"   How will I know when God's talking to me?:  A week ago, my co-worker showed me this book that she thought I might be interested in.  I was one of those daily prayer/meditation books.  As she was telling me more about it, I looked at the back cover and skimmed through the pages. I looked up at her to ask her a question. When I looked back down I saw this:   July 3  A Servant's Heart ...with goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men (Ephesians 6:7)   Death-dealing sorrows encompass me as the aggravations of hell assault us.  Give me the heart of a servant, Lord, when my wants to run away.  Help me to act, not react. Make me a channel of Your Love.   A servant's heart seeks nothing for itself, and does not resent receiving nothing.  In exchange for the moodiness, depression, and criticism of others, give love...being thankful for the opportunity to overcome.  As you triumph over yourself, your enemy, and the circumstances, you actually defeat satan's evil pleasure.  But you must keep your eyes off yourself and on Me...to give freely.  Open your mouth with wisdom and let the law of kindness be in your tongue.   Those who persevere and overcome will have Me.  Run to Me. Hide in Me. Praise Me in all things.  My Presence is ever with you.   "...Without cost you have received; without cost you are to give." - Matthew 10:8

       and this is the reason why i love republicans...   Bush calls for same-sex marriage-ban amendment         WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush said Tuesday that he supports a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage to "prevent the meaning of marriage from being changed forever."    His comments were swiftly condemned by Democratic Party leaders as an attempt "to write discrimination into the U.S. Constitution."   Criticizing San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, judges of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and county officials in New Mexico who moved to let same-sex couples receive marriage licenses, Bush said that in recent months "some activist judges and local officials have made an aggressive attempt to redefine marriage.   "And unless action is taken, we can expect more arbitrary court decisions, more litigation, more defiance of the law by local officials, all of which adds to uncertainty. (Transcript of Bush comments)   "After more than two centuries of American jurisprudence and millennia of human experience, a few judges and local authorities are presuming to change the most fundamental institution of civilization. Their actions have created confusion on an issue that requires clarity."   Bush said states might be forced to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states that allow them.   "On a matter of such importance, the voice of the people must be heard. Activist courts have left the people with one recourse. If we're to prevent the meaning of marriage from being changed forever, our nation must enact a constitutional amendment to protect marriage in America. Decisive and democratic action is needed because attempts to redefine marriage in a single state or city could have serious consequences throughout the country."   He called on Congress to "promptly pass and send to the states for ratification" an amendment that would specifically define marriage as the union of a "husband and wife."   But Bush also said state legislatures should be left to define "legal arrangements other than marriage," suggesting that such an amendment would do nothing to stop states from allowing civil unions for same-sex couples.   "Our government should respect every person and protect the institution of marriage," he said. "There is not a contradiction between these responsibilities."    Democratic reaction   Democrats quickly accused Bush of using the issue for political gain and of trying to draw attention from what they characterize as his failed record as president.   "The Democratic Party is opposed to this amendment," said the Democratic National Committee's chairman, Terry McAuliffe.   "It is wrong to write discrimination into the U.S. Constitution and it is shameful to use attacks against gay and lesbian families as an election strategy. It appears that the conservative compassion he promised to deliver in 2000 has now officially run out."   Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry's campaign spokeswoman, Stephanie Cutter, said Tuesday's announcement makes it clear that Bush's re-election strategy is to "use wedge issues and the politics of fear to divide the nation."   Kerry has said he supports civil unions and equal protection for homosexuals, but opposes marriage. He also said he believes it should be a state issue.    A call for civil debate   Bush called for a civil debate on the controversial issue.   "We should also conduct this difficult debate in a matter worthy of our country, without bitterness or anger. In all that lies ahead, let us match strong convictions with kindness and good will and decency."   Bush said the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act and laws banning same-sex marriage in 38 states "express an overwhelming consensus in our country for protecting the institution of marriage."   But, he said, "There is no assurance that the Defense of Marriage Act will not itself be struck down by activist courts. In that event, every state would be forced to recognize any relationship that judges in Boston or officials in San Francisco choose to call a marriage."   As recently as last week, Bush repeated his belief that marriage should be restricted to heterosexual couples. (Full story)   He added that he was "troubled" by legal decisions in Massachusetts that could clear the way for same-sex marriage -- and the decision by San Francisco's Newsom this month to defy state law and order the county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.   Thousands of couples have taken advantage. (California high court may get same-sex marriage)   Last week, Bush said he was paying close attention to what was taking place in San Francisco and Massachusetts.   "I have watched carefully what's happening in San Francisco, where licenses were being issued, even though the law states otherwise," Bush said. "I have consistently stated that I'll support law to protect marriage between a man and a woman. Obviously these events are influencing my decision."   "I am watching very carefully, but I am troubled by what I've seen," Bush said.   In his State of the Union speech last month, Bush has addressed same-sex marriage, saying, "our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage." (Full story)   He stopped short of endorsing a constitutional amendment that would ban marriages for gay and lesbian couples, as social conservative groups had hoped.   Instead, Bush said, "if judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process."

           2004 Lenten Message  Pope John Paul II   WHOEVER RECEIVES ONE SUCH CHILD IN MY NAME RECEIVES ME. The following is the Message of His Holiness Pope John Paul II for the holy season of Lent, dated 8 December 2003, solemnity of the Immaculate Conception.   Dear Brothers and Sisters!   1. The evocative rite of the imposition of ashes marks the beginning of the holy season of Lent, when the Liturgy once more calls the faithful to radical conversion and trust in God's mercy.  This year's theme — "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me" (Mt 18:5) — invites us to reflect on the condition of children. Today Jesus continues to call them to himself and to set them as an example to all those who wish to be his disciples. Jesus' words call upon us to see how children are treated in our families, in civil society and in the Church. They are also an incentive to rediscover the simplicity and trust which believers must cultivate in imitation of the Son of God, who shared the lot of the little ones and the poor. Saint Clare of Assisi loved to say that Christ "lay in a manger, lived in poverty on the earth and died naked on the Cross" (Testament, Franciscan Sources, n. 2841).  Jesus had a particular love for children because of "their simplicity, their joy of life, their spontaneity and their faith filled with wonder" (Angelus Message, 18 December 1994). For this reason he wishes the community to open its arms and its heart to them, even as he did: "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me" (Mt 18:5). Alongside children Jesus sets the "very least of the brethren": the suffering, the needy, the hungry and thirsty, strangers, the naked, the sick and the imprisoned. In welcoming them and loving them, or in treating them with indifference and contempt, we show our attitude towards him, for it is in them that he is particularly present.  Learn to follow the Master with childlike docility  2. The Gospel recounts the childhood of Jesus in the simple home of Nazareth, where he was obedient to his parents and "increased in wisdom and in years, and in favour with God and man" (Lk 2:52). By becoming himself a child, he wished to share our human experience. "He emptied himself", writes the Apostle Paul, "taking the form of a slave, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a Cross" (Phil 2:7-8). When at 12 years old he remained in the Temple in Jerusalem, he said to his parents who anxiously looked for him: "How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?" (Lk 2:49). Indeed, his whole life was marked by a trusting and filial obedience to his heavenly Father. "My food", he said, "is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work" (Jn 4:34).  In the years of his public life Jesus often insisted that only those who become like children will enter the Kingdom of Heaven (cf. Mt 18:3; Mk 10:15; Lk 18:17; Jn 3:3). In his teaching, young children become a striking image of the disciple who is called to follow the divine Master with childlike docility: "Whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven" (Mt 18:4).  "To become" one of the least and "to receive" the little ones: these are two aspects of a single teaching which the Lord repeats to his disciples in our time. Only the one who makes himself one of the "least" is able to receive with love the "least" of our brothers and sisters.  Combat the many forms of injustice present in the world  3. Many believers strive faithfully to follow these teachings of the Lord. Here I would mention those parents who willingly take on the responsibility of a large family, mothers and fathers who, rather than considering success in their profession and career as the highest value, make every effort to pass on to their children those human and religious values that give true meaning to life.  With great admiration I also think of all those committed to caring for underprivileged children and those who alleviate the sufferings of children and their families resulting from war and violence, inadequate food and water, forced immigration and the many forms of injustice present : in the world.  Together with such great generosity, however, a word must be said about the selfishness of those who do not "receive" children. There are young people who have been profoundly hurt by the violence of adults: sexual abuse, forced prostitution, involvement in the sale and use of drugs; children forced to work or enlisted for combat; young children scarred forever by the break-up of the family; little ones caught up in the obscene trafficking of organs and persons. What too of the tragedy of AIDS and its devastating consequences in Africa? It is said that millions of persons are now afflicted by this scourge, many of whom were infected from birth. Humanity cannot close its, eyes in the face of so appalling a tragedy.  We need a greater concern for the needs of children  4. What evil have these children done to merit such suffering? From a human standpoint it is not easy, indeed it may be impossible, to answer this disturbing question. Only faith can make us begin to understand so profound an abyss of suffering. By becoming "obedient unto death, even death on a Cross" (Phil 2:8), Jesus took human suffering upon himself and illuminated it with the radiant light of his resurrection. By his death, he conquered death once for all.  During Lent, we prepare to relive the Paschal Mystery, which sheds the light of hope upon the whole of our existence, even its most complex and painful aspects. Holy Week will again set before us this mystery of salvation in the suggestive rites of the Easter Triduum.  Dear Brothers and Sisters, let us set out with trust on our Lenten journey, sustained by fervent prayer, penance and concern for those in need. In particular, may this Lent be a time of ever greater concern for the needs of children, in our own families and in society as a whole: for they are the future of humanity.  With childlike simplicity pray to the Father  5. With childlike simplicity let us turn to God and call him, as Jesus taught us in the prayer of the "Our Father", "Abba", "Father".  Our Father! Let us repeat this prayer often during Lent; let us repeat it with deep emotion. By calling God "Our Father", we will better realize that we are his children and feel that we are brothers and sisters of one another. Thus, it will be easier for us to open our hearts to the little ones, following the invitation of Jesus: "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me" (Mt 18:5).  In this hope, I invoke upon each of you God's Blessings, through the intercession of Mary, Mother of the Word of God made man and Mother of all humanity.

        The World is Mine   Today, upon a bus, I saw a very beautiful woman and wished I were as beautiful. When suddenly she rose to leave, I saw her hobble down the aisle. She had one leg and wore a crutch. But as she passed, she passed a smile. Oh, God, forgive me when I whine. I have two legs; the world is mine. I stopped to buy some candy. The lad who sold it had such charm. I talked with him, he seemed so glad. If I were late, it'd do no harm.  And as I left, he said to me, "I thank you, you've been so kind. It's nice to talk with folks like you. You see," he said, "I'm blind." Oh, God, forgive me when I whine. I have two eyes; the world is mine. Later while walking down the street, I saw a child I knew. He stood and watched the others play, but he did not know what to do. I stopped a moment and then I said, "Why don't you join them dear?" He looked ahead without a word. I forgot, he couldn't hear. Oh, God, forgive me when I whine. I have two ears; the world is mine. With feet to take me where I'd go. With eyes to see the sunset's glow. With ears to hear what I'd know. Oh, God, forgive me when I whine. I've been blessed indeed, the world is mine.    Be Blessed!

       So i found this poem that i thought was really cool. Its about a young girl who decides to give life and not abort. Happy Valentines Day!  Her Anointed Appointment by Connie Ambrecht  A young girl enters, for her we did pray. God sent her to us. He sent her today.  He sent her today, it isn't by chance In HIS perfect time, in this circumstance.  From the person who greets her as she enters in To the counselor so precious who shares from within.  She finds the right words within her own heart, God's Word she has hidden, from her lips they impart.  The ultrasound images confirm her test. We show her life, God does the rest.  Each person a vessel, God's hands on earth. If she doesn't know, we share spiritual rebirth.  The commitment we've made, it's the truth she will hear,  We desire her to know the truth we hold dear.  God's truth we can stand on and never waver, To be His in His will, to be in His favor.  His truth can free her, show her the way. He changes lives, let Him start today.  Thank you dear Jesus for sharing with me, The life of this woman, I again see victory.

        The Nail   As the story goes, they built a new church building and people came from far and wide to see it. They admired its beauty! Up on the roof, a little nail heard the people praising everything about the lovely structure except the nail! No one even knew he was there, and he became angry and jealous.  "If I am that insignificant, nobody will miss me if I quit!" so the nail then released its hold, slid down the roof, and fell in the mud. That night it rained and rained. Soon, the shingle that had no nail blew away, and the roof began to leak. The water streaked the walls and beautiful murals. The plaster began to fall, the carpet was stained, and the pulpit Bible was ruined by water. All this because a little nail decided to quit!  But what of the nail? While holding the shingle it was obscure but it was useful. Buried in the mud it was just obscure, but now it was useless and soon would be eaten by rust!   The moral of the story    EVERY MEMBER IS IMPORTANT TO THE CHURCH!   You may feel like the nail, feel obscure at times, but just like the nail, your absence is felt.  When you're not present for worship, in some way the Body of Christ hurts.   We are all a part of the Lord's ministry.

           I thought i'd post some reflections on suffering from Mother Angelica. Rather then posting one huge long one, ill do it day by day.   We often look at Jesus with an attitude of predestination - a cold, hard-hearted acceptance of His sufferings and pain. We think, at least in our subconscious, that somehow He had to do what He did and so we sluff it all off with a shrug of our shoulders, without a thought of the awesome wonder of a suffering God. We cannot comprehend a love that desires to feel our misery. The only love we understand is the kind that warms our heart and affects our emotions. We prefer that our love feels pity or sympathy, but not the actual pain of the one we love.  We may see someone with cancer, but we would never desire to actually feel every sharp, throbbing pain. We often say we would rather suffer than see those we love suffer, but this is for the most part, a mere expression of sympathy.  Our meditations on His sufferings are shallow and distant - expressions of pity if we have any devotion or an acceptance of an historical fact that He came, suffered and died. We laboriously try to remember this reality during Lent and quickly forget it at Easter. We joyfully set aside His sufferings and don our Easter clothes as if to shed some disagreeable event by starting anew. Yes, the joy of His resurrection should always be in our hearts and give us that hope that knows no sadness. But do we not lose the one element of Easter that assures our hope of a never ending source of joy? "See My Hands and My Feet," Jesus told the doubting Thomas. His risen, glorious body continues to carry wounds, but these wounds provide our greatest consolation, our deepest joy and our assuring hope. These wounds open to us the secrets of His Love and give us a confident trust in His mercy. We can no longer doubt His love for us - we can no longer chide Him for permitting injustice in our lives while He never felt this painful sting.  Before redemption we may well have asked Him, "How do You know what it means to suffer, Oh God? Did You ever feel hungry or thirsty? Have Your nights ever been full of fears and Your days long hours of painful endurance? Have You ever felt lonely or rejected? Has anyone treated You unjustly and have You ever cried? Has the powerful wind You created ever pierced Your bones and made You shiver with cold? Have you ever needed a friend and then, when he came along, watched him turn against You?"  His answer to all these questions would have been, "No." But now, we can no longer wonder, because His love has answered our unasked questions - has desired to feel what our nature feels - endure our weaknesses and limitations of our sinner condition - shouldered our yoke and shuddered from the cold wind.  "The birds have nests and the foxes dens," He told His disciples, "but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His Head." (Luke 9:58) The realization that the love of Jesus shared and continues to share in our sorrows and pain, gives us that joy "no man can take away." Our continual Easter joy is mysteriously woven and interwoven with the cross.  The Christian experiences and lives a paradox. He possesses joy in sorrow, fulfillment in exile, light in darkness, peace in turmoil, consolation in dryness, contentment in pain and hope in desolation. A dedicated Christian has the ability to take the present moment, look at it head on, recall the spirit of Jesus under similar circumstances and act accordingly. It is difficult, but He told us it would be, for the happiness He promised is beyond this life. We are given the opportunity to condition ourselves to live forever with Holiness Itself. Let us see how our daily lives and the life of Jesus parallel. Perhaps then it will be easier to change our lives accordingly.

       hey guys, i have a controversial article for your reading pleasure.  i'll tell u this much, i wouldn't be suprise if God destroys us pretty soon.  have mercy on us and the world... jesu ufam tobie...        Scientists say they've cloned human embryos    SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korean researchers reported Thursday they have created human embryos through cloning and extracted embryonic stem cells, the universal cells that scientists expect will result in breakthroughs in medical research.     Hanyang University professor Hwang Yoon-Young said, "Our research team has successfully culled stem cells from a cloned human embryo through mature growing process in a test tube."   The findings by a team of researchers led by Dr. Hwang Woo Suk of Seoul National University were presented to South Korean scientists and will be published in the U.S. journal Science.   The paper describes a detailed process of how to create human embryos by cloning, saying the scientists used the eggs donated by Korean women.   The technique, scientists said, was not designed to make babies but to further understanding of the process known as therapeutic cloning, a possible treatment for a multitude of diseases.   Advances in stem-cell technology have been hailed as holding potential cures for many crippling illnesses, such as diabetes, spinal cord injuries and Parkinson's disease.   According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, stem cells can be manipulated by scientists to develop into many other human cells.   While they can be found in adults, those found in days-old embryos are far more prevalent and more easily manipulated into specialized cells, which then could be used to create cures or even grow replacement organs, the NIH reports.   Stem cell researcher Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, told The Associated Press the experiment proved the cloning technique was possible using human cells.   "That's an important point to prove," he told the AP.   Still, "it's not of practical use at this point," Jaenisch told the AP, stressing that years of additional research were required.   Opponents have said using embryos, even ones just several minutes old, is destroying a human life.   The new report already has sparked a renewal of the debate over whether all forms of human cloning should be banned.   "The result of our research proves it is possible scientifically for human cloning, and we are likely to revive the controversy over human cloning," Hwang said.   Scientists also caution it could take years of further research before stem cell science turns into actual therapies.   Last year, a ban on human cloning passed the U.S. House of Representatives but failed to get approval by the Senate over questions of whether cloning for research purposes could be allowed.   The United Nations decided at the end of last year to delay any decision on a human cloning ban for two years.

         MEDITATION OF THE DAY    The Heart of the Pure         "My own concerns no longer concern me: from now on I must belong entirely to God, and God alone. Never to myself.       Mary sacrificed all, and God alone took the place of all. Following her example, from now on, the Lord alone will be my lot. Why have I come here, if not to love our Lord with all my heart. As a proof of my love for him, I must follow the example of Mary, suffer and generously sacrifice all to him. Courage, my soul, prayer is all powerful, the heart of Jesus is there, let us knock.       O Divine Jesus, engrave in my heart the love of your cross and let me imitate that love of your cross, like him who said that, if after having served you for a hundred years you would grant him to suffer just one hour for love of you, he would believe all his services well rewarded.       O virtue little known, but how sure!        O Jesus and Mary, grant that all my consolation in this world may be to love you, serve you, and suffer for sinners.        O Jesus, teach me to understand how exclusive is heavenly love. Free, draw, and raise all my affections. May my crucified heart be buried forever in yours, in the mysterious wound opened by the sword.        O Jesus, I would rather die a thousand times than be unfaithful to you.        O Mary Immaculate! O glorious Saint Joseph, and you Saint John, beloved disciple of the Divine Heart, teach me the great science of love. May I be strongly drawn towards it. That I may take flight and lose myself, be united and hidden in the adorable heart of Jesus, Jesus crucified, source of charity, of purity, of annihilation, and of perfect submission.       Continually dying to myself, peacefully supporting trials, I work, I suffer, and I wish to have no other witness but his heart. He who is not prepared to suffer all for the beloved and do his holy will in all things, is not worthy of the sweet name of friend.       For here on earth, love cannot live without suffering. It is through loving the cross that we discover his heart, for divine love never lives without loving.        It is through loving the cross that we discover his heart, for divine love never lies without loving." - ST. BERNADETTE SOUBIROUS   Saint Bernadette (1844-1879) was favored with eighteen visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Lourdes in 1858.  Her body remains INCORRUPT in the House of the Sisters of Charty of Nevers.

       So all of a sudden i felt a strong conviction to record this, so that i will...    So be imitators of God, as beloved children, and live in love, as Christ loved us  and handed himself over for us as a sacraficial offering to God for a fragrant aroma. Immortality or any impurity or greed must not even be mentioned among you, as is fitting among holy ones, no obscenity or silly or suggestive talk, which is out of place, but instead, thanksgiving. Be sure of this, that no immoral or impure or greedy person, that is, an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. - Ephesians 5:1-5   "I will sing of your mercy that leads me through valleys of sorrow to rivers of joy..."im done, im out GOd bless!

       BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IN A FEW SHORT DAYS IT WILL BE ASH WEDNESDAY AGAIN. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?  DESPITE ITS REAL RIGORS, LENT IS A GENUINE RESPITE FROM THE NOTHINGNESS THAT ENVELOPS US.  THINK OF THE WAY THAT OLD-TIME MOVIES LIKE TO DEPICT PEOPLE CAUGHT IN QUICKSAND.  THE QUICKSAND TOTALLY ENGULFS THE UNWARY, YET THE MORE HE STRUGGLES, THE DEEPER HE SINKS INTO THE PIT, TRAPPED.  THE VICTIM'S ONLY HOPE IS FOR SOMEONE TO COME ALONG AND, FROM THE PURCHASE OF SECURE GROUND, PULL HIM OUT.  FOR THIS REASON, ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO LIVE LENT IS TO BEGIN AT THE END.  THE NIGHT BEFORE HE DIES, JESUS SAYS, "I CALL YOU FRIENDS."  THE LORD INTENDS THE BEING-TOGETHER OF THE LAST SUPPER AS A PATTERN FOR THE ENTIRE LIFE OF EVERY CHRISTIAN.  LENT IS A GRACED TIME TO RENEW THIS PATTERN.  WE COME TOGETHER IN THE COMMUNION OF THE CHURCH IN ORDER TO TEAR OUT FROM OUR FRIENDS THE NOTHINGNESS THAT ENMESHES US.

                      THE EUCHARIST AS MOLDING US INTO COMMUNITY   by Rev. Ron Rolheiser, OMI  There is a story told about a Jewish farmer who, because he was carelessness, had to spend a Sabbath day in his field. Preoccupied with his work, he had let the sun go down without going home. Now, being a pious believer, he was not allowed to travel until sunset the next day. So he spend the day in the field, by himself, missing both the Seder meal with his family and the services at the synagogue. When he finally did return home the next evening, he was met by an irate wife and an equally upset Rabbi. The Rabbi chided him for his carelessness and asked him: "What did you do in the field by yourself all day? Did you at least pray?"   "Rabbi," the farmer answered, "I'm not a very smart man and I don't know many prayers. All the prayers I knew, I said in five minutes. What I did the rest of the day was simply recite the alphabet. I left it up to God to make some words out of all those letters."   We leave it to God to make the words out of the alphabet of our lives. There are few better ways to describe how the Eucharist works in terms of forming us into one heart in Christ. The Eucharist, as we know, is meant to form us into one body in a way that takes us beyond the differences and divisions of personality, ideology, theology, gender, ethnicity, history, social status, pre-occupation, privatized agenda, and jealousy. Often times it alone has the power to do this. Why? Why does the Eucharist have such unique power?   The Eucharist creates community in a way that cannot be explained in terms of normal group-process. Only the language of ritual sheds any light here. What happens at the Eucharist cannot be extrapolated and explained in terms of simple psychological dynamics. It transcends the purely psychological, as does all powerful ritual process. How? An analogy might be helpful in trying to understand this:   I entered the Oblate seminary in my late teens as part of a group of nearly fifty young men (with an average age of under twenty-five). We were housed in one small, over-crowded building which also served us for classrooms, library, cafeteria, and recreation. I lived in that situation, a potential psychological hot-bed, for six years and, overall, it was a wonderful experience. Despite our differences in background and personality and our youthful immaturities, we basically got on quite well with each other. Very few left the seminary, in those years, over relational difficulties with other seminarians.   However, one of the linchpins within our daily program was something we called "Oraison". It worked this way: For half an hour each morning and for another half-hour each night, we would sit together, all of us, in complete silence in the chapel. No words were exchanged among us and nothing was expected of anyone except his silent presence. Looking back now, I see that this particular practice of sitting together in silence, in prayer, for an hour each day, did more to bring us together and keep us together than did all the community-building exercises we did at other times. It created a ritual container that held us together in a way that no purely psychological or emotional container ever can. What we had each day was akin to a "Quaker silence"; we sat together, before God, and asked God to give us something that we could not give to ourselves, namely, community beyond our differences. We asked God to make a single word out of the different letters of our lives.   And it wasn't anything romantic, you can be sure of that! We sat in a chapel, which itself was no aesthetic prize, as a group of immature, young men, and we fought sleep, boredom, our hormones, tiredness, low-sugar, irritation with each other, full moons, growling stomachs, homesickness, emotional obsessions, scars from our sporting events, and jealousies. This wasn't the holy family, not by a long shot. But it worked - marvellously so. God gave us, daily, something we couldn't give to ourselves, a common heart and common spirit. So too, in Eucharist.   Recently I saw a satirical version of Leonardo de Vinci's famous Last Supper. Mostly it looked like the original, except, in this updated version, one of the disciples is making a phone call on a mobile phone, just as Jesus is lifting the bread and wine to God for consecration. Not far off the mark at all!   One of our deepest, congenital longings is for community. But we come together, seeking each other, carrying huge differences: our wounds, our separate histories, our preoccupations, our sexual and emotional obsessions, our jealousies, our boredom, and (far too often) our cellular telephones. Such is our alphabet. On our own we cannot form ourselves into a single prayer or into a single heart. Only God can make those words. God does this for us in the Eucharist.

          Feast Day of St. Joseph   March 19     Everything we know about the husband of Mary and the foster father of Jesus comes from Scripture and that has seemed too little for those who made up legends about him.   We know he was a carpenter, a working man, for the skeptical Nazarenes ask about Jesus, "Is this not the carpenter's son?" (Matthew 13:55). He wasn't rich for when he took Jesus to the Temple to be circumcised and Mary to be purified he offered the sacrifice of two turtledoves or a pair of pigeons, allowed only for those who could not afford a lamb (Luke 2:24).   Despite his humble work and means, Joseph came from a royal lineage. Luke and Matthew disagree some about the details of Joseph's genealogy but they both mark his descent from David, the greatest king of Israel (Matthew 1:1-16 and Luke 3:23-38). Indeed the angel who first tells Joseph about Jesus greets him as "son of David," a royal title used also for Jesus.   We know Joseph was a compassionate, caring man. When he discovered Mary was pregnant after they had been betrothed, he knew the child was not his but was as yet unaware that she was carrying the Son of God. He planned to divorce Mary according to the law but he was concerned for her suffering and safety. He knew that women accused to adultery could be stoned to death, so he decided to divorce her quietly and not expose her to shame or cruelty (Matthew 1:19-25).   We know Joseph was man of faith, obedient to whatever God asked of him without knowing the outcome. When the angel came to Joseph in a dream and told him the truth about the child Mary was carrying, Joseph immediately and without question or concern for gossip, took Mary as his wife. When the angel came again to tell him that his family was in danger, he immediately left everything he owned, all his family and friends, and fled to a strange country with his young wife and the baby. He waited in Egypt without question until the angel told him it was safe to go back (Matthew 2:13-23).   We know Joseph loved Jesus. His one concern was for the safety of this child entrusted to him. Not only did he leave his home to protect Jesus, but upon his return settled in the obscure town of Nazareth out of fear for his life. When Jesus stayed in the Temple we are told Joseph (along with Mary) searched with great anxiety for three days for him (Luke 2:48). We also know that Joseph treated Jesus as his own son for over and over the people of Nazareth say of Jesus, "Is this not the son of Joseph?" (Luke 4:22)   We know Joseph respected God. He followed God's commands in handling the situation with Mary and going to Jerusalem to have Jesus circumcised and Mary purified after Jesus' birth. We are told that he took his family to Jerusalem every year for Passover, something that could not have been easy for a working man.   Since Joseph does not appear in Jesus' public life, at his death, or resurrection, many historians believe Joseph probably had died before Jesus entered public ministry.   Joseph is the patron of the dying because, assuming he died before Jesus' public life, he died with Jesus and Mary close to him, the way we all would like to leave this earth.   Joseph is also patron of the universal Church, fathers, carpenters, and social justice.   We celebrate two feast days for Joseph: March 19 for Joseph the Husband of Mary and May 1 for Joseph the Worker.   There is much we wish we could know about Joseph -- where and when he was born, how he spent his days, when and how he died. But Scripture has left us with the most important knowledge: who he was -- "a righteous man" (Matthew 1:18).   In His Footsteps:  Joseph was foster father to Jesus. There are many children separated from families and parents who need foster parents. Please consider contacting your local Catholic Charities or Division of Family Services about becoming a foster parent.   Prayer:  Saint Joseph, patron of the universal Church, watch over the Church as carefully as you watched over Jesus, help protect it and guide it as you did with your adopted son. Amen   Memorare: Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who implored your help and sought your intercession was left unassisted. Full of confidence in your power, I fly to you, and beg your protection. Despise not, O foster-father of the Redeemer, my humble supplication, but in your bounty, hear and answer me. Amen. .

           FEAST DAY OF ST. PETER CHANEL & ST. LOUIS DE MONFORT       St. Peter Chanel (1803-1841)        As a young priest he revived a parish in a "bad" district by the simple method of showing great devotion to the sick. Wanting to be a missionary, he joined the Society of Mary (Marists) at 28. Obediently, he taught in the seminary for five years. Then, as superior of seven Marists, he traveled to Western Oceania where he was entrusted with a vicariate. The bishop accompanying the missionaries left Peter and a brother on Futuna Island in the New Hebrides, promising to return in six months. The interval lasted five years.  Meanwhile he struggled with this new language and mastered it, making the difficult adjustment to life with whalers, traders and warring natives. Despite little apparent success and severe want, he maintained a serene and gentle spirit and endless patience and courage. A few natives had been baptized, a few more were being instructed. When the chieftain's son asked to be baptized, persecution by the chieftain reached a climax. Father Chanel was clubbed to death, his body cut to pieces.  Within two years after his death, the whole island became Catholic and has remained so. Peter Chanel is the first martyr of Oceania and its patron.    Comment:   Suffering for Christ means suffering because we are like Christ. Very often the opposition we meet is the result of our own selfishness or imprudence. We are not martyrs when we are "persecuted" by those who merely treat us as we treat them. A Christian martyr is one who, like Christ, is simply a witness to God's love, and brings out of human hearts the good or evil that is already there.   Quote:    "No one is a martyr for a conclusion, no one is a martyr for an opinion; it is faith that makes martyrs" (Cardinal Newman, Discourses to Mixed Congregations).      St. Louis de Montfort  (1673-1716)        Louis's life is inseparable from his efforts to promote genuine devotion to Mary, the mother of Jesus and mother of the Church. Totus tuus(completely yours) was Louis's personal motto; Karol Wojtyla chose it as his episcopal motto.  Born in the Breton village of Montfort, close to Rennes (France), as an adult Louis identified himself by the place of his Baptism instead of his family name, Grignion. After being educated by the Jesuits and the Sulpicians, he was ordained as a diocesan priest in 1700.  Soon he began preaching parish missions throughout western France. His years of ministering to the poor prompted him to travel and live very simply, sometimes getting him into trouble with Church authorities. In his preaching, which attracted thousands of people back to the faith, Father Louis recommended frequent, even daily, Holy Communion (not the custom then!) and imitation of the Virgin Mary's ongoing acceptance of God's will for her life.  Louis founded the Missionaries of the Company of Mary (for priests and brothers) and the Daughters of Wisdom, who cared especially for the sick. His book, True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin, has become a classic explanation of Marian devotion.  Louis died in Saint-Laurent-sur-Sèvre, where a basilica has been erected in his honor. He was canonized in 1947.    Comment:   Like Mary, Louis experienced challenges in his efforts to follow Jesus. Opposed at times in his preaching and in his other ministries, Louis knew with St. Paul, “Neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who causes the growth” (1 Corinthians 3:7). Any attempt to succeed by worldly standards runs the risk of betraying the Good News of Jesus. Mary is “the first and most perfect disciple,” as the late Raymond Brown, S.S., described her.   Quote:    “Mary is the fruitful Virgin, and in all the souls in which she comes to dwell she causes to flourish purity of heart and body, rightness of intention and abundance of good works. Do not imagine that Mary, the most fruitful of creatures who gave birth to a God, remains barren in a faithful soul. It will be she who makes the soul live incessantly for Jesus Christ, and will make Jesus live in the soul” (True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin).

                 FOLLOWING JESUS - BE READY FOR SOME SURPRISES    by Rev. Ron Rolheiser, OMI   Following Jesus is not without its surprises. It's best to be forewarned. Here's fair warning:   Soren Kierkegaard once said that what Jesus wants is followers not admirers. He's right. To admire Jesus without trying to change our lives does nothing for Jesus or for us. Yet how exactly does one follow Jesus? Classically we have said that we do this by trying to imitate him. But that posits a further question: How do we imitate Jesus?   A negative example might be useful here: Many of us remember the "Jesus people" of the late 1960s, with their rather raw, literal approach to following Jesus. They tried to look like he looked. They put on flowing white robes, grew beards, walked bare- foot, and tried, in appearance and dress, to imitate the Jesus that centuries of Western artists painted for us. Obviously this is not what discipleship means, not only because we don't know what Jesus looked like (although we do know that he was not the fair-skinned, fair-haired young man of Western art), but, more importantly, because attempts to mimic Jesus' physical appearance miss the point of discipleship entirely.   More subtle is the attempt to imitate Jesus by trying to copy his actions. The algebra here works this way: Jesus did certain things, so we should do them too. He taught, healed, consoled the downtrodden, went off into the desert by himself, stayed up all night occasionally and prayed, and visited the homes of sinners. So we should do the same things: We should become teachers, nurses, preachers, counsellors, monks, social workers, and non-judgemental friends to the less-than-pious. In this view, imitation is carrying on the actions of Jesus.   This kind of imitation, however valuable as ministry, still is not quite what is required in terms of real discipleship. In the end, it too misses the point because one can be preacher of the gospel and not really be imitating Jesus, just as one can be a truck driver (not something Jesus did) and be imitating him. True imitation is not a question of trying to look like Jesus, nor of trying to duplicate his actions. What is it?   Perhaps one of the better answers to that question is given by John of the Cross, the great Spanish mystic. In his view, we imitate Jesus when we try to imitate his motivation, when we try to do things for the same reason he did. For him, that is how one "puts on Christ". We enter real discipleship when, like Jesus, we have as our motivation the desire ("proper regnum Dei") to draw all things into one - into one unity of heart, one family of love.   John of the Cross then offers some advice regarding how this can be done. We should begin, he says, by reading the scriptures and meditating the life on Jesus. Then we should pray to Christ and ask him to instill in us his desire, longing, and motivation. In essence, we should pray to Jesus and ask him to make us feel the way he felt while he was on earth.   Some surprises await us however, he points out, if we do this. Initially, when we first begin seriously to pray for this, we will fill with fervour, good feelings, a passion for goodness, and a warm sense of God's presence. We will feel that we feel like Jesus - and that will be a very good feeling indeed. However, if we persevere in our prayer and desire to imitate him, things will eventually change, and in a way that we least expect. The warm feelings, fervour, and passion - that snug feeling that we feel like Jesus - will disappear and be replaced by something infinitely less pleasant. We will begin to feel sterile, dispassionate, dry. God's presence will feel neither warm nor steady and we will be left wondering: "What's wrong? How did I lose the way?"   However, as John of the Cross assures us, nothing is wrong. Rather our prayer has been answered. We prayed to Jesus, asking him to let us feel like he felt, and he granted our request. Exactly. For a large part of his life and ministry Jesus felt exactly as we are now feeling - dry, sterile, and not buoyed up by any warm feelings of God, even as he remained faithful in that darkness. Strange how it can feel, feeling like Jesus.   There's a fervour that comes from the wetness of fertility that can make the soul swell with feelings of creativity, warmth, and immortality. God is in that. But there is also an aridity the comes from a deeper place, a heat that threatens to dry out the very marrow of the soul, a dryness that shrinks all swelling, especially pride, and leaves us vulnerable and mortal by bringing the soul to kindling temperature. God is in that dryness no less than in the wetness of fertility because in that painful longing we feel the eros of God and the motivation of Christ.

       THought id shurr this artcile w/you...let us pray for our mother church in brazil!  In the world's largest Roman Catholic country, indifference is visible. Now, priests and bishops are responding. SAO PAULO - For the first time in 500 years, Brazil's Roman Catholic Church is fighting for its turf. Materialism is one rival, an energized evangelical movement another. But the worst enemy is growing indifference. ''Something happened over the past decade and, yes, it worries us,'' says Bishop Odilo Scherer, secretary general of Brazil's Catholic Bishops Conference.  What happened, according to the Brazilian Census Bureau, was a major decline in the percentage of Catholics in Brazil's population -- which fell from 84 percent in 1991 to 74 percent in 2000. While Brazil, with 178 million inhabitants, is nominally the world's largest Catholic country, its fervor can be less than overwhelming. In 2001, a survey by The Religious and Social Studies Center, a Rio de Janeiro academic group, found that 33% of declared Catholics in Brazilian cities practiced their religion.  TENSION ON DOCTRINE The survey also found tensions familiar in the United States. More than 70 percent of Brazilian Catholics disagreed with church opposition to contraception, and 63 percent favored divorce as an option for troubled couples.  Domingos Santos, 50, who sells flowers in front of a Catholic church in Sao Paulo, echoes many: "I don't attend Mass very often because I work all the time. My main concern is my wife and children. When I pray, it's for more customers.'' Says theologian Fernando Altemeyer of the Catholic University of Sao Paulo: "The Catholic Church is not giving people what they want. For those who want hope, excitement or, in some cases, wealth, the evangelical movement was made to order.'' Evangelical Protestants grew from 9 percent of Brazil's population in 1991 to 15 percent in 2000, the census bureau reported. ''People are troubled in today's world by drugs, divorce, violence and alcohol, but when they go to the Catholic Church for succor, all they get is dogma; when they come to us, they get a sense of community,'' said José Luiz Lopes, a pastor for the Assembly of God, Brazil's largest evangelical church, with about 8 million members.  Part of the evangelical appeal is theatrical. Faith healing, speaking in tongues and, in the case of one church -- The Universal Kingdom of God -- frank prayers for personal wealth lend an excitement absent from Catholic rites. ''It's easy for new churches to make such an appeal,'' Altemeyer said. ``They are unburdened by centuries of doctrine.''  But religion in Brazil has always been a garment loosely worn. Many Catholics dabble in other religions, especially Umbanda, a cult that includes contact with the dead. Brazil's Catholic Church is unaccustomed to competition. Catholicism was the state religion from 1500 until a republic was declared in 1889. Even in the 20th century, it was largely unchallenged. So now, how does such an entrenched institution fight back?  New blood is one answer.  YOUNGER PRELATES In January, Pope John Paul II accepted resignations of three powerful cardinals: Serafim de Araujo, 80, of Brazil's third-largest city of Belo Horizonte; Jose Freire Falcao, 79, of the capital of Brasilia; and, Aloisio Lorscheider, 79, of the shrine city of Aparecida. The pope replaced the three with experienced bishops in their 40s and 50s. The Brazilian church is now led by men such as Scherer, 55; Walmor de Azevedo, 49, the new archbishop of Belo Horizonte and a Biblical scholar; and 69-year-old Cardinal Claudio Hummes, head of the country's largest archdiocese -- Sao Paulo.  Hummes speaks five languages and seems a decade younger than his years. He projects cool authority.   ''We are taking a missionary approach,'' he said. ``We are reaching out to the poor, especially in big cities. We are combating cynicism with the Gospel.''  New practices also help. Catholic ''charismatics,'' for example, seek the same direct experience of the Holy Spirit as many evangelicals. And another powerful strain also animates Brazilian Catholicism -- protest. The bishops' conference is doctrinally conservative but ''socially aware,'' Altemeyer says. Adds Scherer: ``There is a consensus now incorporating sensitivity to social issues, but rejecting Marxism.''

          Prayer to the Holy Spirit   (in preparation for Pentecost)  Come, Holy Spirit, fill my heart with your holy gifts.  Let my weakness be penetrated with your strength this very day that I may fulfill the duties of my state in life conscientiously, that I may do what is right and just.  Let my charity be such as to offend no one and hurt no one's feeling; so generous as to pardon sincerely any wrong done to me.  Assist me in all the trials of life, enlighten me in my doubts, strengthen my weakness, help me in all needs and embarrassment, protect me in temptations and console me in all afflictions.  Graciously hear me, O Holy Spirit, and pour your light into my heart, my soul and my mind.  Assist me to live a holy life and to grow in goodness and grace. Amen.

        "There will be a time when you believe everything is finished. That will be the begining..."    Something to ponder on:   I do not look forward to the trials and crosses of this life with dread and fear; rather i look to them with full confidence that as they arise God to whom i belong will deliver me from them.  He has guided me and guarded me this far in life. I do but hold fast to his dear hand and he leads me safely throughout all the trials. Whenever i cannot stand, He carries me lovingly in His arms.  I do not look forward to what may happen tomorrow. The same Eternal Father who cares for me today, will take of me tomorrow, and everyday of my life. Either He will shield me from suffering or give me the unfailing strength to bear it. I am at peace. I put aside all useless thoughts, vain dreads and anxious imaginings.

       This question comes at you, compliments of Brother Fred & Sister Therese.  I overheard (not to be confused with "eavesdropped") them talking.  Brother Fred brought forth this question to Sister Therese.  I wasn't able to hear the rest, but it got me to thinking.  So I pose this question to   ALL  .  I'll be back with my thoughts.  Gotta get some ZZZzzz's. God bless.       Question of the Day     "Why does God allow suffering?"

       good memories in sh...     i was just thinking back last summer when we went to vegas..  that was good times!!  i love going to sh events and trips.  i think the one thing we haven't done in forever long is go to a mission trip!  i remember when we visited the ones in san diego, oh and the one in ventura and san fernando..  and pretty much that's how a lot of us got closer.  i swear those are good memories.   i was just thinking, i've been in the group since 1998, which is about 6 years!  i've seen people come and go, i've seen people stay and grow...  ...i remember when  fred  first came to prayer meeting.  he was quiet and not quite sure about the group... praise God where he is in his stage with God...  ...i remember  mike t's  first time.  that was great!  he was wearing a beanie, and i thought he looked so kool haha.  ...i remember  aela's  first time in pg, that was when  me  and  maurice  and  fred  (the og boys) had to do pg by ourselves.  ...i remember  banne's  first time in pg.  wow has she grown in the spirit.  ...i remember  jay's  first time in pg, we prayed for his open heart and now he's grown in the spirit.  i have to say that i've seen a lot of people grow in this group, and to me that's a blessing.  that's how i KNOW that God truly answers prayers, when i see all these awesome people come together to worship our Lord, and fellowship.  what was your first memory of sh pg!?!    so who wants to be a 'contributor' to iservantsheart?  the only requirement is that you give me your email address and you're an active member of sh (don't worry i know who is and who's not hehe)  until then God bless...

        A Mother's Love...   For those who are fortunate to still be blessed with your Mom this is beautiful. For those who aren't, this is even more beautiful. The young mother set her foot on the path of life. "Is this the long way?" she asked. And the guide said "Yes, and the way is hard. And you will be old before you reach the end of it. But the end will be better than the beginning."  But the young mother was happy, and she would not believe that anything could be better than these years. So she played with her children, she fed them and bathed them, and taught them how to tie their shoes and ride a bike and reminded them to feed the dog and do their homework and brush their teeth.  The sun shone on them, and the young Mother cried, "Nothing will ever be lovelier than this." Then the nights came, and the storms, and the path was sometimes dark, and the children shook with fear and cold, and the mother drew them close and covered them with her arms, and the children said, "Mother, we are not afraid, for you are near, and no harm can come."  And the morning came, and there was a hill ahead, and the children climbed and grew weary, and the mother was weary. But at all times she said to the children, A little patience and we are there."So the children climbed, and as they climbed they learned to weather the storms. And with this, she gave them strength to face the world. Year after year, she showed them compassion, understanding, hope, but most of all...unconditional love.   And when they reached the top they said, "Mother, we would not have done it without you." The days went on, and the weeks and the months and the years, and the mother grew old and she became little and bent. But her children were tall and strong, and walked with courage. And the mother, when she lay down at night, looked up at the stars and said, "This is a better day than the last, for my children have learned so much and are now passing these traits on to their children."  And when the way became rough for her, they lifted her, and gave her their strength, just as she had given them hers. One day they came to a hill, and beyond the hill, they could see a shining road and golden gates flung wide. And mother said: "I have reached the end of my journey. And now I know the end is better than the beginning, for my children can walk with dignity and pride, with their heads held high, and so can their children after them."  And the children said, " You will always walk with us, Mother, even when you have gone through the gates." And they stood and watched her as she went on alone, and the gates closed after her. And they said: "We cannot see her, but she is with us still. A Mother like ours is more than a memory. She is a living presence."  Your Mother is always with you. She's the whisper of the leaves a you walk down the street, she's the smell of certain foods you remember, lowers you pick and perfume that she wore, she's the cool hand on your brow when you're not feeling well, she's your breath in the air on a cold winter's day. She is the sound of the rain that lulls you to sleep, the colors of a rainbow, she is Christmas morning.  Your Mother lives inside your laughter. And she's crystallized in every tear drop. A mother shows every emotion...happiness, sadness, fear, jealousy, love, hate, anger, helplessness, excitement, joy, sorrow....and all the while, hoping and praying you will only know the good feelings in life. She's the place you came from, your first home, and she's the map you follow with every step you take. She's your first love, your first friend, even your first enemy, but nothing on earth can separate you. Not time, not space....not even death!

         God said...   If you never felt pain, Then how would you know that I'm a Healer?  If you never went through difficulties, Then how would you know that I'm a Deliverer?  If you never had a trial, Then how could you call yourself an overcomer?  If you never felt sadness, Then how would you know that I'm a Comforter?  If you never made a mistake, Then how would you know that I'm forgiving?  If you knew all, Then how would you know that I will answer your questions?  If you never were in trouble, Then how would you know that I will come to your rescue?  If you never were broken, Then how would know that I can make you whole?  If you never had a problem, Then how would you know that I can solve them?  If you never had any suffering, Then how would you know what Jesus went through?  If you never went through the fire, Then how would you become pure?  If I gave you all things, Then how would you appreciate them?  If I never corrected you, Then how would you know that I love you?  If you had all power, Then how would you learn to depend on me?  If your life was perfect, Then what would you need Me for?

           DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE?  (Meditation for Corpus Christi)        "When Jesus told His disciples that He was going to give them His Body and Blood - and that they must eat and drink of it - many of them thought He was crazy and they left Him.  It wasn't as if Jesus was expecting them to believe Him solely on the basis of His word.  The many miracles He had performed should have convinced them of His divine power.  Jesus always fulfilled His promises, and He fulfilled this one.  On the night of the Last Supper He turned bread and wine into His Body and Blood and gave it to His apostles to eat and drink.  He commanded them to do the same thing in His memory.  For almost two thousand years the Church has been doing what Our Lord commanded Her to do - changing bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ at the Mass, and with it feeding the faithful.       Unfortunately, there are still many people who do not believe in the Eucharist, ie. Jesus is truly present under the appearances of bread and wine.  Most unfortunate of all are the Catholics who do not believe.  At least, they give the impression of not believing.  According to liberal estimates only about 33% of Catholics attend Mass every Sunday.  It's hard to imagine anyone - who really believed that the Eucharist was the Body and Blood of Christ - ever willingly missing Sunday Mass.  Not even the proverbial wild horses would keep him away.  In fact, he would try to go to Mass even daily if possible.  And if it weren't possible, he would eagerly await each Sunday so that he might be able to receive the Body and Blood of Jesus.  How careful he would be not to commit a mortal sin so that he might be able to receive his Lord.  How quickly he would go to confession if he did have the misfortune to commit a mortal sin, so that he might be forgiven and be again able to receive Holy Communion.   Jesus said that He Himself was the Bread of Life.  He warned that those who did not eat of this Bread would not possess eternal life.  Do you wish to live forever with Jesus in paradise?  Then you must begin now, if you have not already done so, and you are able to do so, to receive Our Eucharistic Lord as often and as worthily as you can.  Receiving Jesus is not a burden.  For those who truly believe, it is their greatest delight." - Fr. John Lyons OMV

      the talk of the town...  The Passion of The Christ   i just thought i'd write up on what this movie means to me.  i hear all this talk about it, which to me, doesn't really pertain to what it is...which is, a film.  sparking anti-semetism, mel gibson being 'traditional catholic', too gory/bloody...all that doesn't matter.  all this criticism is about what   might    happen after viewing the movie, as if we're not allowed to feel a certain way.  critics need to be concerned with what it means to them as opposed to what others might think.  just enjoy the movie, you know what you're getting into.  most that are going to see it pretty much know what it's about.  its not meant to convert, convict, or judge anyone.  if it does any of that or leaves you with any sort of feeling, good or bad, it becomes your personal issue. it's not the directors' fault, he didn't make you go see it.  this film is intended to be a work of art, depicting what Jesus Christ sacrificed for us.  it's part of the gospel in movie format.  thats it, take it for what it's worth.

       bad timing...   well as some know i had an interview on wednesday.  it went well and it seemed like the day was going really good....until night time.  it felt like i was going to be sick.  so i drank lots of fluids and rested up pretty early (well, earlier than usual).  but when i woke up, i just felt it.  i was sick.  so i'm trying to get over it right now, hopefully it'll go away by the end of the weekend b/c i have my 2nd interview on either monday or tuesday.  if you have any leftover prayers (b/c i know you guys have been praying for me and i can't thank you enough), it would be really appreciated. thanks =)

      i don't mean to hate or blast anyone.  nor do i want to send negative vibes to the public.  take this as an eye opener.  i found this article when searching for a track name.  i really like this artist's music, but this made me think twice about supporting her.   musicNEWS: Lauryn Hill Disses The Catholic Church   12-15-03 Keavin  Update: The Vatican got an earful from Lauryn Hill when she blasted the Catholic Church from the stage during a Christmas Concert on Saturday.  Hill was invited to participate in the Christmas Concert at the Vatican which was filmed for Italian TV. Hill took the opportunity to accuse the church of exploitation and moral corruption, alluding to sexual abuse of children by U.S. priests and challenged them to repent.  Instead of taking to the stage and performing as planned, Hill instead stood before the microphone and read a lengthy statement criticizing the Church for failing to crack down on priests who abuse children.  "I'm not here to celebrate, like you, the birth of Christ, but to ask you why you are not in mourning for his death in this place," Hill said.  "Holy God has witnessed the corruption of your leadership of the exploitation and abuses which are the minimum that can be said for the clergy."  "I realize some of you may be offended by what I'm saying, but what do you say to the families who were betrayed by the people in whom they believed?"  The Church was not pleased with the outburst. Cardinal Camillo Ruini, a senior member of the Holy Sea attended the concert.  Ruini is the Pope's vicar for Rome and the head of the Italian Bishops Conference, although he and Church did not have an official comment on Hill's statement, Allhiphop.com reports that his aid accused the singer of disrespecting "the place she was in and for those who invited her."  Hill reportedly did not perform the song she was scheduled to sing but instead performed a protest song.  According to that same report, Hill's statement and performance are expected to be edited out of the concert when it is broadcast on Italian television on Christmas Eve.   *please no 'hate mail' comments towards her on TagBoard.  Thanks.

      i'm gonna piggyback on  urlLink b.anne's  blog and give props to this author, Joshua Harris and his book  Not Even a Hint .  now as a guy being exposed to practically everything that's 'socially acceptable', i've had my share of troubles with morality.  i still do.  being a guy living in this society,  we're exposed to false expectations to what a 'man' is supposed to be like.  some good, some bad, some just ridiculously obsurd.   one trouble i, and most guys, have is when noticing a beautiful female, knowing how to control emotions.  especially in this world where sex is totally accepted and encouraged.  i was guilty of 'checking out' girls and thinking thoughts i'm not supposed to.  but i really want to get over that, and when seeing this book in the bookstore, i think it would really help me overcome that emotion.  even thinking unnecessary thoughts about my girlfriend i want to get over.  i know that beauty comes from within, its just being predisposed to a way of thinking is hard to get over, but it is possible to overcome.  i hope it helps you guys, and girls, that have this issue also.  where as we can respect each other's physical appearances and not defy what God wants us to think of each other.  so here's what the book looks like, its one of the coolest book covers i've seen, it was that which actually brought me to picking up the book, i didnt even know what it was about, when i started reading it i thought it was awesome!  i have just skimmed through it, i have yet to get it, but i've read good reviews about it.   urlLink     my personal review will be posted later. =)

       Happy Birthday Love!   today is LynLyn(Roselynn)'s birthday!  I feel very blessed to have her in my life.  I've never had anyone love me as much as she does.  I still can't figure out why, but I'm just glad I have that and I appreciate it very much.  I try my best to show it back, in hopes she see's the love I have for her.  so far, so good. =)  What i love best about our relationship is the sense of reality.  It never was the 'storybook' relationship where its all lovey-dovey fairy tale  we're going to live happily ever after -type.  From the beginning, we knew it wouldn't be easy or smooth sailing.  We just knew we had a love for each other.  We don't go out of our way to buy stuff for each other to win each other's affection (b/c we're both broke).  Nor do we expect things like that from each other.  We dont try to impress each other with the way we look.  It relies heavily by the grace of God to guide our lives  together .  I'm glad she's not the "you don't get me flowers, cards, etc..." or "if you love me, you'd do this" type.  (cuz i wont have any of that to begin with.)  I just love her for who she is, and she just loves me for who i am.  we both share a common understanding.  it's just that simple.  we have to live life simple because of complex factors in our relationship.  Praise God for guiding our love. =)

       Praise you LORD!   thank you all for your prayers for my aunt.  as some know she had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer.  she's my favorite aunt because of so many reasons.  it hit me pretty hard when i heard the news.  its really hard for me to talk about it.  but i know i should remember that the Lord is taking care of her, which is truly evident that He is.  it's such a blessing to witness a  miracle.   i bear good news:   From my cousin Kristine: "...My mom's surgery yesterday was successful.  The surgeon completed a mastectomy and a removal  of a lymphnode.  While in surgery, he sliced the lymphnode in half and viewed it under a microscope.... HE DID NOT FIND ANY CANCER CELLS!"   "...When my brother and I talked to her last night, she told us that prior to the surgery, she was not really taking any pain medication even though she was in pain.  She said that every time she felt the piercing pain, she would proclaim "Bow down!" and the pain would go away!  This is so ironic because a few verses prior to the one I've been meditating upon has to do with bowing down:  "The Lord upholds all who fall, And raises us all who are bowed down." (Psalm 145:14)  God works in mysterious ways....As big as His Book is, He managed to bring my mom and I to the same place...Thank you God!  Our God is an awesome God!  I just wanted to thank each and every one of you for your cries....God heard them!  There are even those who told us that they don't know how to pray but that they will try to pray for her.  Please continue to lift my mom up in your prayers as she still has a long road ahead of her.  Please also lift my family, especially my dad, up in your prayers because it is so evident that this has taken a toll on him.  But, for now, with this promising news, we can all rest...."    Thank you Jesus.

      I just wanna get some things out that have been on my mind lately:  I know personally, i haven't been the greatest representative of any sort.  be it servants heart or upper room, or just a follower of Christ.  so i'd like to apologize for some of those things. - if in any way, i have disrespected you by words or action, even if i was just kidding,  i'm sorry.  - if i have made someone look down on a group that i represented because of my actions or words,  i'm sorry.  - if i, in any way, have disrespected others, through jokes or words,  i'm sorry.  - if i, in any way, have disrespected women, through jokes, words, actions, or entertaining the thoughts of others,  i'm sorry.   i guess what i'm trying to get across is that, i want to rid of the negativity in my life as much as possible.  i'm truly sorry for any offense to anyone.  i really dont want to entertain what the world views as 'socially acceptable'; things that defy morality but yet are acceptable in the world.  it doesnt help that i entertain certain conversations, have jokes towards others, or just have inappropriate jokes.   i hope to be of better representation, and just be a positive source to those who cross my path.  from now on, i hope to have my actions and words be more of a reflection of Jesus Christ.   thanks for your time and pardon.    p.s. if it sounds like i'm being a party pooper...well, i guess i'm pooping on a party i dont want to be a part of.   =)

      ..for a jobby job. i've spent the past 2 weeks sending out my resumes to companies looking for a graphic designer.  there were more openings out there than i thought.  i'm glad that they're there, i'll be even gladder if they call me in for an interview.  so far i've sent out to 17 companies/organizations.  i'm really hoping for a dream job situation at places i've applied at such as Quiksilver, Vans, and O'Neill.   but, only time and God will tell.  thanks for all your continuing support and prayers.  thanks B.anne for the job openings you found for me.  thanks to all of you who go on AIM in the morning so my work day at La Mirada is less dreadful.   PEACE!

      the news...  well, as some of you guys know, i wasn't offered the full time Graphics Specialist position at La Mirada.  the director of the department told me it was a difficult decision because the top 3 candiates (myself, an older guy and an older lady) were all qualified to handle the job, so it came down to years of experience.  for myself, i'm the youngest candidate to make it to the 3, so i would be the one with least number of years of experience.  not the least amount of talent, knowledge, people skills, work ethic, adaptability, etc., which were  not  considered heavily in making the final decision.  what a shame.    well, i'm not going to complain about how i did so much work for the organization and now i get nothing, because hey, theres' nothing i can do about it now.  here's an interesting story i've learned, when the director was talking to me on monday morning, he was telling me that they were just going to give me an interview anyways.  he candycoated it so much that in reality what it really came down to was a 'pitty interview'.  where as they would give me an interview regardless because i'm with the organization already.  and he was telling me that as he was looking through the other apps and samples, that my stuff was really competative.  like he was surprised that i could  actually  hang with other applicants.  the way he was saying it, what i got out of it was that he didn't expect me to get past the first round.  so when i did, and after i did well with the 2nd interview, i'm assuming he didn't expect to be put in the position where the 3 were all top candidates, not one of us stood out more than the other, except for experience.  its something that i like to call  proving others wrong .  even though i didn't land the job, i came pretty darn close...2nd or 3rd place out of 120 proven graphic designers.  i'll take it for what its worth.  which leads to something you guys  might  be wondering...where my AIM screen name came from: shoeshine80Y (shoeshine boy).  if you guys remember the cartoon 'underdog', he was a super hero similar to superman, and his alter ego's name was shoeshine boy.  (superman:clark kent as underdog:shoeshine boy).  in 1995 i played in a bball league with my friends and our team name was the underdogs....we ended up winning the championship.  the term 'underdog' is very relative to my personality.  from the outside, what you see is just a regular guy that from first appearance, doesnt seem like he has anything exceptional about him.  but whenever i get the chance to prove myself, i'll take that opportunity to just show what i can do.  its of my nature to kinda keep what i'm able to do to myself, and just present itself when necessary.  i'm not one to talk about what i do or what i'm capable of doing.  its just who i am, i dont think i can change that about me.  thats why i consider myself an 'underdog'; proving to others that their assumptions about me are wrong.  thank you to those that have supported me and prayed that i may get a full time job.  thanks especially to Robby, whos been giving me sound advice, and to Antonio who's been trying hard to get me into the QS company.  i know it'll all happen in God's time...which i hope is soon. =)  God bless!

      wow! i so agree with this article.  especially this paragraph: The news gets worse. The best employees are the newbies--the ones who have been on the payroll less than six months. They aren't jaded and are still trying their best. The worst workers are the ones who have been with the company a long time. "The longer employees stay with a company, the more disengaged they become," Coffman told The Denver Post.    urlLink 71 percent of U.S. workers are slackers.

       career opportunity/dilema     vs.    sorry if i haven't been around lately, i've just been preparing for what lies ahead for my future.  hope you guys understand.  well here's my dilema, i've been busting my butt here in La Mirada as the graphics aide for the past 1/4 of the year (3..going on 3 1/2 months now).  anxiously waiting for my opportunity to become the full time graphics specialist. but due to some circustances, that hasn't come about til recently.  i really want this job, i know i can handle it, and it pays very well.  but some people make it hard for me by lagging on what they have to do to 'seal the deal'. so i had no other choice but to seek other options just in case it doesn't fall through.  so my option was asking other friends if they knew of any openings.  so i get a call from antonio, on a day that i was 'supposed' to get a call for an interview for the la mirada job (ironic yes?).  and he tells me of an opening for a T-shirt designer at Quiksilver.  so i give him my resume, and i feel very blessed to have him refer me to the people in charge of hiring the designer.  so with that job, i'm guessing its a better work environment, go to work in comfortable clothing(shorts, t-shirts, sandals are acceptable there), and i get to do what i love doing (which you all know is designing shirts), but i'm sure it pays less.  so now i'm just waiting for my 2nd interview(which is said to be this wednesday) and preparing for a Quiksilver interview.  it requires a lot of work on my part because the portfolios i show can't be the same.  in the design/art biz, its all about your portfolio...degrees dont hold much weight, it only means something to your momma and poppa.  La Mirada is looking for a certain style, so i gear my portfolio towards what they want...and Quiksilver wants practically the opposite style, so i have to arrange my portfolio consistent to the style they like.  i feel very blessed to have both of these opportunities, and blessed to have all of you that have been supporting and praying for me.  nothing's written in stone yet, so we'll just see how things turn out.  i'll keep you guys updated. Thanks and God bless!

        When it all falls down who you gonna call now?    -kanye west   once in a great while there'll be an artist that'll strike interest in me because they believe in what they're doing so much that they'll keep doing it until they get their dues.  Kanye West is an example of that.  I haven't been intrigued by someone like that in a while, probably since my early college years when i got into  urlLink Living Legends .  Now what Kanye did was just stick to his formula of making music.  He raps about stuff people wouldn't normally dare to rap about or put out there in the industry (i.e. 'Jesus Walks' was one of his earliest songs he was trying to push before signing with rocafella records).  I admire peeps who just work their way up to get to where they want to be.  as opposed to 'one hit wonders' that think of making a hit song that will catch everyone's attention then die down because they lack heart in their music.  Even now that Kanye's a big star, he said in an interview he can't forget about being on the same level as the fans because he himself is a fan of hip hop and knows the struggles of the everyday man.  And you can see that in his music.  Not all of his songs are about 'pushin a benz' or 'rockin a chain'.  although he has some of those songs, its because he earned it.  but he doesnt forget about what people go through and even what he goes through (i.e. songs like 'all falls down', 'never let me down', 'family business').  His first big single, 'Through the Wire'  was genius when i first heard it because it was so real. real in the sense that he didn't hold back and just told the world what he went through.  Now probably some of your favorite songs right now have been produced by mr. k.west and you probably didn't know (i.e. Janet Jackson's 'i want you' and 'my baby', Dilated Peoples 'this way', Alicia Keys 'you dont know my name', etc..)  If you haven't already, pick up the Kanye West album  urlLink "The College Dropout" .  i'm out...

       "its a shame the attitude i have to present to prevent these pungent liars from causing chaos / its as if every time i open my mouth they're poking about with another fallacy to spray us."   urlLink  - 3MG   - Your Business  i always liked that song for its honesty.  i feel the same way as the artist sometimes when i feel like i'm being judged.  now everyone may not agree with what i have to say or write.  people can think whatever they want, thats fine with me.  its when people express their feelings to others that dont know where i'm coming is what irks me.  this is why, for the most part, i'm a quiet guy.  it seems like when i do try to say something or have an opinion about something, its not always expressed as the 'politically correct' way of thinking.  now i think i'm a very open minded person, thats why some of my views may differ from most.  but in the end of it all, i allow my actions to speak for itself.  i think i'm liberal in thought and conservative in action.  which could spell disaster if not controlled properly, but i think i'm doing alright.  sorry if i'm just rambling...give me a song with meaning and my mind will spin whirlwinds of thoughts.  that was hella random.

        Biggest Laker fans:   Filipino moms!    ever since we got direcTV, my mom would ask me if there's a laker game tonite, so i'd check for her.  she would ask more than my dad would!  my aunt (wendell's mom) is the same way, she gets crazy while watching their games.  Mao (tita emmy mejia) also drops everything when a laker game is on. and even tita norma (velasco) loves the lakers!  its a crazy phenomena where the mom is more of a fanatic than anyone in the family.  but its always a joy to watch them get crazy over the game of basketball.  they also use the 'reverse psychology' tactic while watching (robby knows of this well, haha!). my mom would say when they're down by a few points 'talo nanaman' (they're going to lose again) and sure enough, kobe will hit the winning shot or something of that nature.  its funny when that happens, its like they're mad at them, but really they want them to win.  i think i found out how i can be a laker fan...which has been the biggest hang up of mine.  i cant get why i cant like the hometown team.  i think i need to go to a game to feel the excitement of the team.  i dunno, for me watching them on tv seems like its scripted...because they're so good.  like the last game of the season, i knew kobe would go for 3 when they were down by 2.  i just know when i see a team, or band live... i like them more, so maybe that'll do the trick for the lakers. save me a seat jack!

      the talk of the blogworld:  "Lurkers"   now i can see how some people might expect someone who reads their entry to respond to it.  but not everyone has an opinion on what you write.  yes, people do like to just read.  for every website we visit, are we expected by them to respond to the content of their webpage?  if someone were to do that to me, i'd be turned off by it due to the fact that they expect me to respond. so if ever i'd think their content is crap, i'd be obligated to post some bs just to let them know i read it and not offend them (ie: a 'there i tagged, happy now?' tag; also refered to as pity tag).  but if it's good (personally speaking) on the other hand, i'll be more than willing to post something truthful.  by even having a site that you've allowed to posts personal things about yourself on the internet, you're opening up doors to the whole world to see and know about you.  so you're basically setting yourself up if you're posting something personal and then someone reads it, in turn having an opinion about it.  some might be good, some might not.  not everyone will agree with you.   if you can't stand the heat, don't play with fire   bottomline: if you're posting something, you cant go on doing so thinking only a certain few will see it...EVERYONE with internet access has access to your site.  they will post a tag if its in their interest. people don't usually tag for the sake of the writer knowing they've visited the site.  so you cant expect everyone to tag just because they've read what you've written.  by even coining readers as a 'lurker' would turn them off from your site. why degrade your readers to that term when all they've done is become interested in what you write and now just because they don't tag, you're calling them out and calling them 'lurkers'?? thats sad...

        Face it, it's real bebeeh!     Scientists Find New Face on Back of Turin Shroud  By Dominique Vidalon   MILAN (Reuters) - Italian scientists have found a matching image of a man's face and possibly his hands on the back of the Turin shroud, believed by many to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, one of the researchers said on Thursday.  The discovery that the ghostly image on the back of the linen cloth matches the face that adorns the front is likely to reignite debate over whether the shroud is genuine or a skilful medieval fraud.   "The fact that the image is two-sided makes any forgery difficult," Professor Giulio Fanti of the University of Padua told Reuters.  The findings of Fanti and Roberto Maggiolo, both from the university's department of mechanical engineering, were published this week by a journal of the Institute of Physics in London.  Fanti said the discovery would support those who maintain the cloth is genuine.   The shroud, one of Christianity's most sacred but most disputed relics, is a piece of linen some 4.4 meters (14 feet) long and 1.1 meters (3 feet 7 inches) wide.   It first appeared in France in the 14th century and has been held in the Italian city of Turin since 1578.   For over 600 years the debate has raged over the origin of the image of a tall, bearded man bearing the marks of crucifixion that can be seen on the front of the shroud.   Experts over the years say they have found traces of blood, pollen or soil typical of Jerusalem, where Christians believe Jesus was crucified.   But 15 years ago three separate laboratories said carbon dating indicated the shroud was no older than the 13th or 14th century. Researchers concluded the shroud was a hoax created for the hugely profitable medieval pilgrimage business.   While the front of the shroud has been studied intensively over the years, the back had remained hidden under a piece of Holland cloth which was sewn by nuns to cover up damage caused by a fire.   That protective layer was removed in 2002 for restoration and the back of the cloth was photographed.   The two scientists said they studied these photographs and used mathematical and optical techniques to process the images.   They found that the face that can be seen on the reverse of the shroud matches that of the front.   "We can detect the presence of a nose, eyes, hair, beard and mustache on the back surface that correspond in place, form, position and scale to those of the front," Fanti said.   Speculation has also grown over who created the image. One theory maintains it was the work of Leonardo da Vinci, who pioneered an early photograph technique and put his own face on the shroud.

      praise God for this holiday.  the reassurance that our souls have been saved through Jesus Christ as long as we do as Jesus did and follow our Father's will.  Its great to know life doesn't end after our physical self dies.  how priveledged we(humans) are!  an interesting attendee was at mass today.  i've seen the show a few times but i'm not too fond of the 'nationwide karaoke contest'.  the hawaii native  Jasmine Trias  of the American Idol finalists was with her family at Holy Family parish in Artesia celebrating Easter.  my sister loves the show so she went up to her and received her autograph.  Good luck to ms. jasmine.  well thats all for now, thanks to everyone who's been praying for me.  the cross keeps getting heavier as days pass without any call backs, but i have confidence that God will provide so long as i do all i can do.  nine resumes were sent out this past weekend, hopefully one will provide.  God bless!

      this entry is inspired by the words expressed from my bro's fred and robby. thanks fellas.  How quick we are as humans to look out for #1 (ourselves).  It is a trait passed on from society since earliest of times (re: survival of the fittest).  We're ALL selfconscious of this trait in ourselves, wether we want to or not.  I'll be first in line to say that I am.  As much as we would like to give our all, there's always something in our heads saying "is it worth it?", "will i just end up getting hurt?", "does this person deserve to have all of me?", etc.  Believe me I know the feeling of giving my ALL to someone and end up being hurt in the end of it all.  But I have no regrets.  I have given to those what I can, and that is all i can offer to people i come across.  I get advice from friends to be careful.  I question it by thinking "what for?"  If i was meant to have certain feelings at a time in my life, i would rather not hold them back for the sake of being hurt or possibly losing someone in my life.  I would want them to know how special they are to me and they deserve to know that.  If i dont get the same response back, so be it.  All i know is that i want to give back the love i've recieved from them, wether they knew of it or not.  I'm so glad to say that i can't change that part of me, and even so blessed that i've found out this...   i have something to share with you all.  We all (well, at least most of the readers of my blog i know of) know and obey the ten commandments given by God through Moses, right?  and as soon as we know we've broken one of them, our hearts hold heavy until the chance to reconcile our mistakes.  now, i dunno why a particular commandment is overlooked.  maybe its because Charlton Heston hasn't starred in a movie about it yet.  but here we are, knowing the 10 that Moses spoke of...but yet we tend to forget to obey what our Lord, our Savior, came down to Earth and spoke of this new commandment:   "I give you a new commandment: love one another.  As I have loved you, so you also should love one another.  This is how all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."  (John 13:34-35)  Here He is,  OUR LORD HIMSELF , proclaiming words that we must follow, how he wants us all to be.  We've all felt the Lord's love, we know what it's like.  Sure the feeling doesn't last til forever, but we've all had a taste of it.  Why are we hesitant to share it with others?  I believe we owe it to God to try to show the love He has given us.  especially to others that aren't open to Jesus' love just yet...but rather your love.  one they can physically see and feel, and from there it'll all happen in God's time.  A simple smile, compliment or encouragement radiates Jesus within us to others.   I understand the heartache of giving your all to someone and not recieving it in return.  It hurts, physically it hurts our heart to even think about what was went through.  But was Jesus ever "careful"?    Even when he knew people would not follow him, he would offer them opportunity to do so: A rich young man came to Jesus and asked Him, "Teacher, what good must i do to gain eternal life?" Jesus replied.   "If you wish to be perfect, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.  Then come, follow me." (matt 19:21)  Now Jesus, I'm sure, knew the young man would not give up all his riches to join Him.  and i'm sure His human side felt heartache for someone chose material things over being with Him.  But yet he still showed love to the young man and gave him the opportunity to become a disciple.  Jesus did not get mad at the young man for not understanding at the time.  Thats something only God's love would be able to get you through.  Are there times we feel like being there for someone but dont because we know the person well enough that they won't appreciate you being there for them?  Believe me i've had my conficts and hesitations with that.  but you know i'll tell you guys personally...going for it is worth it.  you may not get to them now, but at least you know that you've tried all you can and someday, it'll register to them.  might not be through you exactly, but once they come to the realization that you've shown them love at a difficult time, they'll appreciate it so much then. and i'm pretty sure God will be happy that you've obeyed what He has told us before He physically left Earth.  even if they never come to appreciate it, just know that you were able to show Jesus through you by doing so.  i have been trying my best to LOVE everyone, through whatever means they're able understand.  it's really hard because everyone has a different personality and take things differently.  Just try to find Jesus in you to lead his LOVE and it'll come out.  don't expect it to be in abundance either, something so little from you could mean a whole lot to them.  please don't hold back, its not worth it.  we never know when our last day on Earth will be, show the world our all before its too late.  Pain is temporary.   LOVE IS FOREVER .  peace be with you.

       woo hoo!  you guys got the 'secret' (your prize is revealed when you click on today's title)  since i want to get into designing clothes and other artsyfartsy stuff, i can't help but notice what's out there and which brands are successful.  but here's a list of brands/products that puzzle me on how they  ever  became over with consumers with such a ridiculous name. here goes:     Banana Republic  - a government of a fruit?   Dada  - are we marketing to babies here?   Abercrombie & Fitch  - how many of us could pronounce that the first time we saw it?   Big Dog  - spoofing pop culture with dogs will get you nowhere my friend   Any fashion designer (Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karen, etc) that puts their name across T-shirts ( T-shirts for cryin out loud !!)  - just in case you forget your name or wash clothes mixed with other peoples, no worries, you got your name labeled all over it. or people can think they're fashionably 'hip' with your name all over their clothes as if they knew you personally.   Pimp Juice  - Nelly, the song sucks, and so why make a drink out of it? oh thats right, ladies swarm all over a guy when they see him drinking 'pimp juice'   Pogs  - a round piece cardboard with a design on it, and kids would spend a week's worth of allowance on them..   Pet Rock  - how this guy managed to have America go out and buy a rock and treat it as a pet is pure GENIUS    well those are just a few, that came to mind.  i know i have more.  so next time you're at the mall and you hear yourself say 'i gotta get that shirt from Banana Republic' ...think about it. or you might as well be the next lucky consumer to represent the ever so prestigious government of bananas.  peace.

       n.  To be confident; hope.  there are a lot of things in my life i wish i could have control over.  but of course, as much as we want to, we can't fully control our destiny.  we can work hard to obtain what we want or to be at where we would want to be in life, but nothing has 100% certainty to it.  this is where trust would come into our lives.  trust in others, trust in family and most importantly trust in God, is the only way we can get through situations that seem 'impossible'.  trusting in others allows us to keep grounded.  as friends, co-workers, and advisors ,if we can trust them enough, can give us their insight on their thoughts of us, they see our situation from the outside and can tell us things that we might not see when we're caught up being in that certain situation.  putting trust in them helps relieve the burden of personal struggle because in just talking to them and sharing your thoughts and feelings, comfort is attained by knowing there's someone to talk to about anything.  knowing we dont have to go through things alone.  thank you to my friends for allowing me to put my trust in you.  no matter what, love them or hate them, family will always be there.  even at times that may seem hard, ulitmately they want the best for you and WILL do anything for you.  by allowing yourself to put trust in them, you'll see  LOVE  in the light only a family member can give you. they may not express it in words as much as we would like, but their actions make up for it.  and they  do  speak louder than words ever will.  thank you to my family who get me through everything in life.  to the One who created me and is the only one who  KNOWS  my purpose in life, my God, i want to put my  full  trust in you.  there were times in my life where i thought i was the one on the driver's seat.  times where i thought there was 100% certainty.  and coming to the realization that what i had planned isn't what Jesus has planned for me, its hard to take in.  many dreams disappeared, and in the sadness in that, i, and we, should be able to rejoice in it because trusting fully in Him, He will open new doors that possibly at one time, seemed impossible to happen in our lives.  in all honesty, i wish i could have what i want, what i planned for, and obtain things that i think i deserve...but i know its not on me, when it comes down to it all, its not up to me.  its up to Him who created me.  and in that, i must put full trust in Him in order to really know what i'm destined for.  thank you Lord for taking care of me and my brothers and sisters that have totall trust in you.  to whoever reads this, friend, family member, acquaintance, or stranger:  I LOVE YOU.  (its what the Lord is telling me to express to all my brothers and sisters from here on out, in words and in action)    trust  n. To have or place reliance; depend:   Trust in the Lord. Trust to destiny .

      praise God for the newly tagged organization,  C-LIFE  (Catholic Leadership Institute For Evangelization)!  I had a chance to meet with the group through an opportunity created by jeanne, nick and anthony.  They had enough confidence in me to help them come up with a logo for the group that would be featured on their shirts, website, letterheads, etc.  So of course when opportunity presents itself where i could showcase the blessings God has bestowed upon me, i'd take it, especially for a group that i have confidence in to succeed in their mission to train the leaders of various Catholic communities.  the meeting was such a blessing because i got a chance to see what goes on during their meetings, and i really didnt know what i was getting into.  i dont see myself mentally nor spiritually prepared to consider myself a leader, but i got a taste of what one should do in order to cater to a community.  even though i have been in core for the past 2 years, i consider myself as more a service to the community rather than me being a leader of it.  not to downplay the core in SH (who by the way is an awesome group...one that doesn't get the recoginition and praise they deserve and thats what i love about them, they dont expect the praises that are due to them, they just serve God and His community with ..well... a 'servant's heart'), but i'm just saying personally speaking, being at where i'm at in my mindset and spirituality today.  so it was an honor to be part of a leadership formation team, even just for one day.  it was great seeing leaders of different communities work together (similar to the Justice League...btw, when did the green lantern get a tan?).  ang going throug their activities and exercises, it was wonderful to be a part of despite my lack of experience catering spiritually to others.  they have a weekend seminar(?) of some sort coming up on the 22-23rd of this month.  the talks seem great and i encourage those who are current community leaders, past community leaders and even people who are considering being on a core group next year to attend at least one of the talks.  spiritual growth never hurts. now i'm not really sure who reads this other than my close friends but just wanted to relay that message just in case people i dont know too well read it...if anyone wants the details of it, feel free to  urlLink email  me anytime.  i'll send you the details that were sent to me by fred.  anyways, thanks for reading.  have a blessed week!

      i haven't blogged in a while because i wanted to post this.  i just didn't have time til now to scan it and share it with you all.          that was given to me by Leilani on Father's Day.  its something her and her class made in preschool.  i am so thankful and honored to be considered a father figure to her.  she didn't have to do that.  it came as such a surprise because i felt like i'm not even worthy of recieving something like that.  i'm not even her dad!  but i thank her for being a blessing in my life that i didn't ask to have.  i'll admit, it scared me to have to be a role model/father figure already if i wanted to be with Roselynn.  i was scared that she wouldn't accept me or that she even might hate me because i'm not her real father.  i thank God everyday for giving me the strength, patience and courage to do so.  i thank Roselynn for loving me and putting trust in me that i can be a postitive influence to Leilani. i thank the Soratorio family (that includes you rob, hehe) for accepting me.  and i thank her 'uncles' that have also been father figures to her.  she needs that positive influence of a father figure to guide her in her life.  and i know she's very thankful of everyone that is in her life.  thank you Leilani for loving me and wanting me to be your 'daddy'.  i can't wait either!          What a great weekend this past one was!  LSS was such a blessing to be in.  All the talks were so wonderful and touching.  i missed one talk that i was looking forward to hearing, which was jay's. i'm sure he did an awesome job as always. i love his point of view on things.  i thank God for the many people that attended, helped out and put together the seminar.  i thank Him for the experience i went through.  i've never experienced an LSS quite like i did this past weekend.  i won't go into detail because it was so overwhelming (i probably cant even put it into words that would make sense), but i will say the experience just makes me want to trust in the Lord even more and allow him to work through me always. i'll elaborate more later, i'm tired right now. i just wanted to say how thankful i am to GOD and to EVERYONE for making LSS weekend my most exciting, sorrowful, joyful, humbling experience ever!!!

      I got my first taste of what next weekend will be like last night.  i've been so busy taking care of stuff that it hasn't really hit me yet.  I've heard from others that all the talks are great and from what i've heard so far, its true.  although, i didn't feel like i'm in the position to evaluate any of the talks because i still take them as a learning experience for me.  to me, my peers that do volunteer to do a talk is 'up there' in spirituality.  i admire what they have to say and teach, a level at which i feel i'm not ready for.  it's so great to hear what they say and i feel like i'm an attendee of the seminar all over again.  i wish that everyone in the world could attend the seminar, but i know we dont have that many fliers to hand out.  so to those that recieved one, have gotten an email and/or visited the servant's heart website, i hope you can come by the weekend of june 26-27.  i'd love to see you there.   urlLink click here for Life in the Spirit Seminar info   Peace be with you.

      as some of you know, i am a los angeles clipper fan.  i had faith in them when they were rebuilding with alvin gentry as coach and acquiring young and rising stars.  now its safe to say i WAS a LA clipper fan, here are my reasons: - traded darius miles (a player that i liked) for andre miller, who then left after a year. so what are the clips left with after the trade? NOTHING. - all the free agents that they didn't care to re-sign last year, are on teams that made the playoffs this year! michael olowokandi: minnesota timberwolves lamar odom: miami heat andre miller: denver nuggets(!) eric piatkowski: houston rockets which means they had the talent, but for some reason they couldn't achieve playoff status while playing for the clippers. - their top draft picks of the past 2-3 years have done nothing to turn the team around. - they could've been the new exciting young team with the lineup of mcinnis, richardson, maggette, miles & brand. but that is now non-existant.  so now the clippers have the #2 draft pick for this years draft.  sadly, i feel bad for that pick b/c as much talent as he has, the team will still be mediocre at best. quit dissappointing me clips! oh wait, you already have...  i was a big fan of the seattle supersonics in the 90's during the kemp/payton era.  and i still am partial to the sonics, but i think they're on the same path as the clips.  i liked desmond mason, but he got shipped to miluakee for ray allen.  so they're not as exciting to watch anymore.  so for the playoff's, i've began to start trying to like the lakers.  not to jump on the bandwagon or anything, but after seeing what the team has went through this past season, especially with kobe, i felt for him.  it takes a man to admit his faults, esp. to the public, go to court in colorado, then play a stellar basketball game hours later. he'd probably be considered as my favorite bballer right now.  its amazing.  you'd think he'd be too emotionally drained to even play, but to me, he seems to not worry about it and he plays with the confidence of an innocent man.  i hope thats the final verdict in his case.  also seeing my mom's love for the team is such a joy to watch.  she watches every game (...and every game she asks if its the "championship").  and its just fun to see her root for a team like that.  you cant help but smile to see your mom be excited about a basketball game.  so i guess i'm a 'lukewarm' laker fan(hahah).  dont hate.  if you do, i'll play you one-on-one.  i dunno why i've been bloggin so much about basketball lately.  i guess the playoffs have got me on a bball high. lets go play this weekend everybody!

I'll support you any way i can. I'm already excited to see what you've come up with. MT: any way you can right? just kidding.  your support is enough and i'm glad i have people like you to back me up and actually like what i come up with.  game: i got your back, bro! lets do this! thats would be so cool. although i dont have the $ either. MT: yes! lets do this buddhist, i mean.. catholic (but that doesnt rhyme with 'do this', doh!)  banne: His will lies in the deepest recesses of your heart...go where your passion lies, and if you can glorify God thru it, GO FOR IT...God will make a way... MT: yea, i really feel that i want/need to do this.  it is my passion and i do want to glorify God through it, its just starting it that's hard.  but it will start after hawaii vacation. slowly but surely.   Fred: Mikey, if u pursue this dream, I wanna be one of ur male models! MT: definitly man! (sorry, i'm not designing underwear though)  burr: u are always in my prayers man! we talked about this b4 about your 'could be' venture.. and i still think it's great!! u should def pursue it because i think u have the talent for it! go for it brah! i got yo' back!! we'll talk more when i see u   MT: thanks braaah! you've been supporting me through all my talk of this.  i hope to do this soon and not dissappoint.  i support you fully with your entropy thing also!  lets make this happen!

      thanks to all that have been praying for me to get a full time job.  i know God hears our prayers loud and clear, and if it is His will, it will be done.  and its at times where its is not that make life seem difficult.  i haven't recieved final word on a decision yet but it doesnt look too good.  i talk to giselle (my friend that referred me) a lot and she said that they're interviewing more people, when i was told they were to make a decision by last friday.  so logically thinking, i came to the assumption that they didn't really like any of the candidates (present company included) so they're looking to interview more.  althought the pay is nice and the benefits, i really began to think if it was really for me.  maybe God's trying to tell me that KB Home isn't where he wants me to be.  maybe it wont challenge me enough (its basically coloring drafts of homes from architects).  although, i have been challenged with something...  recently, i've been more convicted to start my own production "company".  producing apparel, posters, art, books,etc.  all catholic based design to where that would be my form of evangelization.  you all know i'm not much of a speaker/preacher type so i would like to express what i feel through my art.  and as of late, i've been coming up with concepts that i havent seen been done before...and when the final product is made, i'm not saying this to be conceeded or anything, but i think it'll turn heads.  its more than your typical christian shirt with a mock of an existing product (i.e. abercrombie & fitch : abreadcrumb & fish).  although those are neat, they're not really creative or convicting.  the challenged is posed in the form of investing in what i want to do, and taking the risk in doing so.  so whats holding me back is the uncertainty of it all.  i dont have the money to do this all at once, so patience is required.  in no way is my intention to be filthy rich off 'God', its just i want to express myself and my beliefs through art, just as any artist wants to do.  i want to 'work' for the glory of God.  just as anyone who works in a catholic organization.  i have recieved the support from those i have spoken to about this (lynlyn, robby, jay, b.anne..thank you).  starting it is the hard part.  i will discern this further.  thanks for reading.

If ever I can inspire any one of my brothers or sisters, I will do so through my love for them.  banne: wow, your entry was so inspiring...thanks, mike...i really needed that. i also loved the rescuing heart picture...God truly speaks thru you, my friend  MT : It’s all inspired by the One(God) and one’s(people) who have shown me love throughout my life.  It’s all I can really offer to my friends. (b/c I’m broke, hehe jk)  isda: thanks for though motivational thoughts! praise God for you  MT : agh! Praise God for you!  rangeles: YEAHHHH MIKE ... I know how you feel bro ... I know how it feels to give your all and then get hurt in the end ... But it was worth it because when that door closed another one and a better one opened… And the room that I'm currently in right now is like a dream that has become reality ... Always give your all ... because you will get someones all sooner or later. But what sucks is that when you don't see and are blinded that the other person is giving their all jus as much as you are ... how selfish is that ... Jus remember that there will be a time when someone will give their all jus as much as you will ... they will sacrifice jus as much as u would sacrifice and love jus as much as you would love  MT : Dude, who is this? haha jk bro.  I appreciate what you have to say and am privileged to be someone you can talk to about stuff like this.  Arisa: thank you for that beautiful entry, mike...it really moves rangele to say some pretty wonderful things...   MT : thank you for reading it.  rangeles is a good man (but i'm sure you already know that by now)  game: good insight, man! God is love unconitional...God is in us, thus we need 2 reflect love unconditionally. (side note: tight tron pic !)  MT : Amen!  Tron : what’s the square root of this apartment? ahahahha  crispy: beautiful entry...  MT : thank you.  archNME: such beautiful words coming from a beautiful person. i surely see JESUS in you. well said bro!  ah yes..i know..it's me. i rarely respond to blogs, but now i have to. from these words that i read, i've never been so proud to call mike as DEFINITELY..my best friend.  MT : you’re beautiful! Thanks for responding even though I already know how you feel.  Ah yes.  lyn lyn: you have shown so much love in your life and have helped me to love and accept myself more through God's mercy shining through you.  MT : you’re the one who inspires me by being a walking example of unconditional love.  Fred: ur a good man and a great example  MT : so are you my friend.  mo : good stuff. love is risky, love requires action. mike, can you imagine if we all loved everyone without fear.....  MT : yea, love is risky. But you know, sometimes we gotta take that risk in order for others to truly feel what love is.  re:  imagine if we all loved w/o fear...  I imagine that’s what heaven is all about (abundant love)  Em: You have very insightful thoughts...please continue so I can become insightful also!  MT : thanks em! You’re already insightful without me writing.  MG: Its alway better to love and be loved and get your heart broken...rather than not knowing what love is.  MT : I’m with you on that.  What doesn’t kill us only makes us stronger.  Fred: Dave Chapelle is genius... "Hey, baby, wut u doin out here?" hahaha!!!  BABY : I got kids to feed!  jme: It is easier for me to love when I take out the "feeling" aspect of it and focus on the commitment. Love = always wanting the best for someone.  MT : I like that equation.  We all have different ways to show love, I’m glad you can express yours in a way that’s comfortable for you.  Arisa: Arisa thinks its time for Mike to blog again!!!  MT : I know! Mike’s such a lagger…  game: gr8 job last night! i wish i could see what was goin on outside. ah well.  MT : gr8 job with the lights! There is no play if there is no light.  Em: Missed you at the picnic!  MT : I missed you too! Cousin Mike says hi to all of SH!  I'll be posting something new in the next few days. definitly with some news by the weekend, thanks to all who have been praying for me! i really appreciate it.  thanks to  urlLink FRED  for granting me  sponsor of the week .  i can now retire from blog jeopardy so others that aren't on the computer 24/7 get a chance to become fred's SOTW.   Happy Birthday to all the JUNEbugs!

       Holy Family parish priests.   I went to mass yesterday with my fam because it was my parents 25th wedding anniversary (woo hoo!).  and it so happend to be Monsenior(sp?) Mac's last celebration before heading out to st. barnabas in the LBC.  it was nice to see him one last time, although LB isn't that far, i could see him do his thing there anytime.  the priest from that parish that i will definitly miss is Fr. Alex.  before hearing of him being relocated, i was really considering him to be my spiritual director.  i admire his peace, humor and sincere nature.  what was weird (possibly coincidence?..) was that the past 3 weeks before LSS, i attended his last masses 3 weeks straight!  they were all at different times and 3 times i heard him say "this is the last mass i will be celebrating at (5:30, 12:15, 11:00)."  so i heard him say his goodbye's three times, and it was nice to see him a lot before he goes to do his thing at a parish near oxnard.  its quite a drive if i ever want to see him again... but maybe one day i will.  I haven't met the new priests yet, their first day on duty is today.   i can't wait for hawaii!  i'm in dire need of a vacation. after months of a heavy work load, i finally caught up and done with all the stuff that needed to be done before taking 2 weeks off.  (thats why i'm blogging here at work..hehe)   i just need to get a few things for the trip and i'll be good to go.  thanks Rob and Em for the invitation to share your wedding with you in hawaii!  and in a month i'll be headed out to sea-town (that's seattle for you non-hip folks..jk) for another wedding! its my cousin's wedding, cousin mike's little sister, tina.  i love my fam up there b/c they treat me sooo good.  i'm kinda scared b/c this is the first time i'll be flying by myself.  i'm sorry, but if i see a middle eastern group of guys, i'll be hella paranoid. i know i shouldn't, but hey... if it wasn't for 9/11, i wouldn't feel this way.  i'm sure it'll be ok.  God bless everyone!
