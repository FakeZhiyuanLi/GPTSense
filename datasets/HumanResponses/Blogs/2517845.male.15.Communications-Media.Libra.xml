      Woo! A blog! I always wanted one of these, and I first fooled myself into thinking I could host it on my long-since-defunct website,  www.mrpwase.com . Well, now I have a place into which I can spill my thoughts. And also a few songs, if I'm in a musical/destructive mood.  Maybe a little about myself. I go by the name of mrpwase, a strange name created in the depths of my early childhood. I'm 15, I live in England, and have a tendancy to act strangely in a sensible way. C'mon, you must have heard of that type of person. Calm and serious one minute, kicking you in the groin while reciting Metallica lyrics the next. That's me (around my friends only, of course). I don't know how I ended up like this...honest.  Anyway, less about my personality. I go to a school that shall yet remain nameless, but is meant to be very good (in an academic way, not aesthetic or anything), blah blah. There are some good teachers. There are a few good people to talk to. The sixth form is pretty good. The only differences from any other school are the mad decisions the head makes (building an £11,500 sundial...gah!) and that it's a grammar school. Which might explain my cultured tones. *snort*  I'm quite musically minded (as of late, anyway) to the extent of being in a (thrash metal) band in which I play rhythm (spelt right!) guitar with two of my homies/mates/friends, both of whom are much the same as me, but more popular. *sigh* There's Miles, who is obsessed with constantly acting 'non-conformist', but I guess means well, and listens to old 70's rock (instead of 80's rock! Bleh!) as well as Metallica, Black Sabbath, Iced Earth etcetera. He plays bass. There's also Crem, who is more of a Led Zeppelin/The Darkness kinda person, who plays lead. At the moment, we're deciding on a genre other than thrash metal (for some reason), but we've decided on a name -  Ammut-Kha , some kind of Egyptian thing to do with soul-devourers. 'Rock on! We're non-conformists!' And so on.  I'm also into computer games, especially monthly-fee MMOGs (massively multiplayer online games) like Planetside and, to a lesser extent, Laser Squad Nemesis. I got a massive gaming PC for Christmas last year, and while it's now kinda out of date, it still runs everything quite well. The only problem with my love for online games is that I live in a remote village light years from a broadband area, and so am stuck with 56K. Drat.  I might not be particularly active over the first few months due to extensive GCSE mocks revision, but I'll try and find time to devote my scribblings to you all.  Anyway...that's me! I hope this time I can update this blog enough to gain it some kind of warped respect/disgust from other people - the last time I tried, I just stopped. Got bored, I guess. Now I'm (ever so slightly) more mature and so am confident in holding down  something .  Ta-da! mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Gah, how I hate revision. My school broke up yesterday, so I now have to start revising for my mock exams in January. It hasn't been  too  bad so far - I got some good marks on the tests on the BBC's  urlLink Bitesize Revision  Biology section - but I've got  Latin  to do next, and I just don't feel like memorizing 60 lines of Orpheus and bloody Eurydice. I might just skip it and do an online test at  urlLink Demodocus , a Latin test site (which has a mythology test, something I'm vaguely good at).  Anyway...I should be getting a Laser Squad Nemesis yearly subscription for Christmas, if all goes well. I've already started the LSN division of my online game clan, the TLF (The Liberated Front,  urlLink website is here ), and have got some good response, so soon I'll be happy, alternating between hard work and hard play during the days to come. And then there's Christmas...  Heh. Blogs are pretty cool.  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      So, you want more of my online exploits, eh? Well, how about  this ?  I recently found a copy of 'Laser Squad Nemesis' on one of the cover discs on PC Gamer. I'd heard good things about it before, and it didn't seem to need broadband to play it properly (:cough:PLANETSIDE:cough:), so I gave it a go.  I was amazed. Laser Squad Nemesis is the best online game I have ever played (Planetside doesn't count, it has too much lag).  The basis of the game is this: You are the commander of one of four armies, each of different race and different tactics. You play against people (once you've subscribed) by putting in their email address and waiting. The other person gets an email inviting them to play, and then either downloads LSN and starts playing, or runs the game found in the attachment if they already have LSN. Once you both finish giving orders, you both send them by email to the LSN servers, which calculates the outcome and sends it to you both. You then give more orders, etc. until someone wins.  The game itself is a turn-based strategy from an isometric view. You control a force measured in force points (or FPs), which you select before deploying, with which you have to use to either wipe out the enemy forces or destroy their HQ, depending on the missions. Each race has six unit types, ranging from the standard grunt-type character to commandos, tanks, and walking bombs in the case of the alien force, the Spawn. The maps (of which there are many) range from tight city-fights to wide open forests, and while the graphics aren't overwhelmingly impressive, they're good enough to please the eye if you stop to look. Most of the time you're more likely to be concentrating on the tactical implications of the scenery - will that sniper be able to see my grunt through that window? Will that wall give me enough cover against that grenade (all scenery is destructible to the right weaponry, like missiles or grenades)?  So, the races - Marines are the obligatory fragile but very mobile army, with no tanks, but several powerful infantry units (commanders with powerful anti-tank guns, grenadiers, snipers) and grunts that can shoot very fast. They can't take much damage, but in the right hands can give out a lot of it. They also have medics which can heal friendly troops.  Machina (or Mechs) are the 'advance slowly, guns blazing' race - not surprising considering they're machines. Their basic infantry unit, the Exterminator, is superior to the Marine grunt, and they have a fast scout unit called the Hunter, but the rest of the Mech army is vehicles. There's the scanner, which is like a mobile radar - but very slow and no weapons. There's the AI, a large battletank with a slow-firing but deadly plasma cannon and a robotic repairing arm to repair friendly forces. The only real weakness of the Machina is that they are very slow, and so are vulnerable to rear attacks or flanking. With a rearguard, they are practically unstoppable.  Spawn are aliens that excel at close combat (naturally). They only have two ranged units - the Spiker, which fires spikes from its tail before dying when they run out of ammunition, and the Goo Spitter, which...spits goo grenades, that immobilise enemy troops. The rest of the Spawn are close combat units - the Drone, relatively slow but massive damage for each bite, the Buzzer, small bat-like thing that can fly through windows, and the Queen, a large, fat worm-like alien that can eat corpses and then lay eggs which hatch into new Spawn, and can also kill Marines in one bite. Then, of course, there's the Splatter, a walking natural bomb, very useful for taking out entrenched enemies.  The latest addition to the army roster is the Greys - stereotypical little grey aliens with bug-eyes, skinny arms and very destructive weaponry. I haven't played much as these guys yet, but I know a bit about them - in addition to the grunt-like Sentry, they have a Guardian which can create forcefields, a Warp-Gunner (like a futuristic rocket launcher that creates explosions out of thin air at range), and a Saucer that moves fast and has large lasers for weapons.  All this, however, is at a price. There is a monthly fee for subscription (under £2 a month, around £25 a year) although it pales in comparison to Planetside's fee. Subscription lets you choose any army (non-subscribers can only play as Marines) and challenge anyone, and also enter leagues and tournaments (non-subscribers can only play 'free email challenges', or they can be challenged by a subscriber by requesting it on the forums.  All in all, LSN is a great game for anyone who wants cheap, easy-to-learn-hard-to-master gameplay within a friendly community, and also wants to get on with work while the orders are being processed. =D  And that, in other words, is what I've been up to. Laser Squad Nemesis. I haven't subscribed  yet , but Father Christmas might have a suitable credit card and...  [TRANSMISSION ENDED! GRR!]  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      H'okay. After a long absence, I finally returned to the Square Ultima forums ( urlLink which are here ) and started postin' a-plenty. The guys there are really fun to talk to, and we have some really good discussions there. The forums have lots of features too, like a battle hack and wall market. Yup, I recommend you going there - and they might make me a mod like last time...hehe. Having power over people and using it wisely is fun.  Keep rocking, mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Throughout my life, I had a feeling that the phrase 'devourer of souls' would be a part of my life. I thought it might have been by ex-girlfriend's nickname, but I finally discovered it's the name of the band I'm in. Kha is Ancient Egyptian for soul, and Ammut was the Egyptian god that devoured souls if they were impure. Search for Ammut Kha on Google and choose the second website, and you'll see my words are truth.  The whole part about believing 'devourer of souls' being a part of my life was bullshit, but the rest was pretty much true - my band's name is Ammut-Kha, my ex's nickname was devourer of souls, and as far as I know, Google still works.  So...  This may seem a little unrelated to my daily life...oh, no, wait, I already explained about my band in my first post. H'okay...  My band has been invited to play at the Embassy Club in Stratford upon Avon about two or so months. Nothing extensive, just a few songs, maybe a cover or two, just backing another band from my school. I'm friends with 4/5s of that band, y'see, so we get priority (not that it's much sought after).  We were both ecstatic and worried. Sure, someone's offering us a gig in a small place, quite a few people but the only ones that will really care are our friends anyway, so it seems like the ideal beginner gig - if something goes wrong, everyone will laugh with us and not laugh at us (or even boo) - but we're not exactly coordinated at the moment, and we all have mocks in January, so we won't have much time to practice.  Still...it is a great chance to get ourselves noticed, and I can now play one of our songs and two covers all the way through and of a reasonable standard. We're probably going to play one of our songs,  For Whom The Bell Tolls  by Metallica, and  One , again by Metallica, all of which I can play pretty well.   THERE'S JUST ONE MASSIVE PROBLEM . We have no drummer. :'(   I don't know how we overlooked it when we started in August last year, but we didn't get a drummer and we still don't have one. It's all well and good having someone fill for you, but you have to know them, know their playing style etc, before you can really play properly IMHO. This applies more to guitarists or other musicians than to drummers, but still...I have a terrible feeling something's going to go wrong. It might not even be our drummer - I'm not one for doing anything in front of large groups of attentive people, and Miles (the bassist) doesn't sound too sure...but then again, we haven't got much to lose. We're probably the second from last 'popularity group' in our year, so no-one will think any less of us - and some might admire us for having the guts to perform (but then again, they  are  a pretty callous lot) - but even in our circle of friends we're not appreciated as such - more kind of...er...laughed at. Even though most of them can't even hold a guitar the right way round...>:(  Ah well. At least we get to play music..which is good, although I'd rather have an audience of close friends that I can 'beat up' when they laugh than a dimly lit leering peer group that I can't even insult back.  Please, please, email me, I'm lonely. mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Eheh...I've been slacking off quite a bit these past few days to play LSN matches against my field instructor, Ruby. As a result, my dad made me draw up a list of things I'd done in each subject over the time I've been revising. Needless to say there were many 'nothings', which made Dad 'give up'. So now I'm just getting advice, not orders, which is what I've been looking for all along.  I've had this problem for a long time. If I'm revising on the internet (GCSE Bitesize, naturally), then my parents get suspicious and get it into their heads that I'm a) spending the time looking at porn b) spending the time on 'forums' I tell them so much about ( urlLink this is a good example ) or c) playing on Habbo Hotel, which I've been going on out of sheer boredom.  The thing is, unlike most 15 year olds, I don't find it fun to play football constantly, and play on consoles in between. I do play football (and badminton, and tennis, etc etc), but I only do it to keep fit, not for a hobby - there's not much I can see in football that I could spend hours a day doing. I prefer playing PC games or surfing the net - and when I say surfing the net, I mean spending hours on it.  So why do people laugh when I go to the IT room at school to check my email? Most people in the school have a Hotmail account (I have their addresses on my MSN contacts list), and some of them do the same, but somehow they've figured out that instead of going to band websites (which I do - Metallica!) or MxTabs (which I do - more Metallica!), in the end I prefer going to the Planetside forums, or the LSN forums, or some other online game I don't get enough of at home.   They find it harder to believe that I pay a monthly fee to play some of these games - Planetside is £10 a month - and when I try to point out that a single-player game like, say, Mario Sunshine on the Gamecube costs around £30-40 to buy, and gives you what...a month of playing time? So £40 a month, possibly more if you buy another game. Yet when I was playing Planetside all the time, it had cost me £30 which got me three free months subscription, and then it was £8 a month (they've raised it since - ooh, £2, I'm going skint). Planetside shunted all other games to the side and yelled 'PLAY ME!', so I did. And it was awesome - much better than any single player game I've played on a console.  Let's do the maths:  First month: Mario Sunshine: Input: £40 Output: One month's worth of game Planetside: Input: £30 Output: Three months of a game that is twice as fun as Mario Sunshine Second month: Mario Sunshine: Input: £0 Output: Collecting dust in a cupboard Planetside: Input: £0 Output: Two months left, and it's still twice as fun Third month: Mario Sunshine: Input: £0 Output: Collecting dust in a cupboard Planetside: Input: £0 Output: One month left, and it's still twice as fun Fourth month: Mario Sunshine: Input: £0 Output: On the rubbish tip Planetside: £8 Output: Now that you're gaining experience and in a good clan, it's four times as fun as Mario Sunshine ever could be  So where does that leave Mario Sunshine? £40 for about 6-7 hours of gaming pleasure. What about Planetside? £30 for three months, during which you will be hooked and playing as much as possible, and then £8 for each extra month, and trust me, you'll still be hooked. I only left the game because I got too much lag.  The verdict: Consoles are cheap bits of rubbish for people who have no time to enjoy video games properly. PCs, on the other hand, require time and effort, which in my opinion, is better than a quick go on a outdated toy.  [/rant] Phew. Email me if you disagree, flame me if you want, but  please  be civilised about it.  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Well...that certainly was good. Among my presents were:  Metallica: S&M DVD with added documentary Metallica: Live Sh*t - Binge and Purge 2 DVDs and 3 CDs all live Metallica: Garage Inc. Iron Maiden: Edward the Great (the best of, in other words) Sony C333NT (or whatever) Hi-Fi with two 75W speakers, MD, CD and tape drives, and ability to record MD onto CD and vice versa, Tape onto both, MD onto Tape, you get the idea, plus 5 blank MDs with a case and some extra money to buy the MD player of my choice - oh, and Net MD software for my computer which enables me to transfer any WMAs, MP3s or WAVs onto a CD, MD or Tape (I hear a Strong Bad compilation...) Lots of chocolate! 4 Monty Python Movies  I am gonna be having some  fun  over the next couple of weeks...  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      [/rant] I got Call of Duty today. It's pretty good. Factors on my progress in the single-player campaign were roughly outweighed: I'd already played 'Burnville' and 'Dawnville' (the two Ste. Marie Eglise missions) on the demos, but I had to do GCSE History coursework, so I got stopped somewhere in Austria, rescuing a certain Major Ingram of the RAF. :D  Also, I've re-established my understanding of Macromedia Fireworks MX, meaning I can now start making signature pictures again.  H'okay, that's all for today.  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Despite the obvious incentive of playing games for a living, games journalism is more than that - for a start, you have to play the whole game through on as many difficulty levels as you can in a short time period, and evaluate almost all of the game at least (in most cases,  everything  about the game). It's a tough job.  I've written a review on Laser Squad Nemesis, and am due to send it in to the 'Uncensored' section of PC Gamer, a section for readers to send in their own reviews (no duh), and eagerly await its inevitable printing and ascention to glory. Or words to that effect.  Wish me luck. Someday I'll be a games journalist...someday...  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Ok, this time it's sorted. I'll sit down every day for 25 minutes a time and do revision while my mum sits and does several crosswords/reads books, so I don't feel tempted not to do anything at all. Then I get about an hour break after a few such sessions, during which I go on Call of Duty, and then back to the studying. In the evenings I either do History coursework or anything I want if the History's finished.  One of my friends mailed me the questions to the History coursework this morning, so now I can properly  do  my coursework - what I've done up til now is a 3 page essay on nothing at all. Rather silly, if you ask me.  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Ok, ok, I know I said I'd keep this updated in the first post, but you know how it is with mock exams (or maybe you don't, you lucky dog, you), and I've been revising maybe just a bit too hard. I apologize for any suicides caused by my absense...oh my, aren't I arrogant today. PFFRT!  Anyway...Metallica still rock, and now Diamond Head do too. Iced Earth are good, Iron Maiden rock too, etcetera. Not much more I can say on the musical front, other than the bad news that the 5th string on my guitar broke (no G-string jokes please, I've had enough already), so no practicing for me. Drat.   The Sims 2  is out in two months, which should be pretty fun. Finally, I can recreate television's famous Mullet Man. Ehehe.  Combat Mission  and almost all the addon packs are pretty damn good too - like Call of Duty, but turn-based! And not first person, although that's a good idea...  English Literature and Maths (second maths exam) tomorrow morning. Send me your electronic love...I mean, luck. Heh.  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Slightly above average results on average in my mock exams! Here's the list (from best to worst, naturally)  English Language: A History: A English Literature: B Geography: B Biology: B Physics: B Chemistry: B Mathmatics: C Spanish: C Religious Studies: D Latin: U  Not too bad, eh? All the results below B I have reasons for: Maths is not a very good subject  para mi , Spanish was a C because I messed up on the speaking (the teacher is scary!), RS was because I spent half the exam answering what I later realised was a 2 mark question, and Latin I just suck at.  But if I improve my RS grade, and then either keep or improve on my grades in Geography, History and English Literature, then I'm into the Sixth Form with the A-level courses I want to do - Geography, History, English and Philisophy.

      Well, that month didn't go too well.  Sorry I haven't been updating this as I promised, but I just went through a kinda strange phase. A friend and I managed to reset James McCarthy's (weez's) Hotmail password, and I then sent an email to randomly selected members of his address book. Guess what the email was about. A bit obscene, I'm afraid. >_  It turns out that one of the members of his address book was the editor (or something important and similar) of the  Birmingham Post , and he was understandably confused and angry when someone who had been on work experience at his newspaper was sending him emails to the tune of 'I shageed Linda'. Also, because this was sent from a school computer, apparently '[my school] and its pupils have been brought into disrepute'. Bad stuff, overall. I haven't been punished at all, however (I may still be suspended or whatever though).  So. Other than that, it's been great. Lots of playing Combat Mission, which I will write about at a later date.  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      A few short ones first:  Criminally stupid and talentless people rule our music industry (or appear to rule it), while on-the-whole ruthless greed-infested scum represent mankind’s destruction of the environment. That’s an important one.  What the US spends on cosmetics every year could be use to pretty much turn around all the problems in third world countries regarding food shortages.  Our social structure generally rewards people who can insult others (Little Britain, most comedians, Miles).  Little or no work has been done towards preventing global warming, despite sound scientific evidence and a danger to, heaven of heavens, NEW YORK! Surely the Americans don’t want to lose the Rotten Apple?  Although I was born into the more-or-less MTV generation, I still take the viewpoint that people should say thank you when a door is held open for them. The very people that are criticised for this (generally teenagers and young adults) are the ones that I find are most polite (with notable exceptions), wheras in my experience older people are ruder (again, with notable exceptions – hello Grandma!).  People never to listen to teenagers. I know, it’s been said often enough, but firstly, anytime I mention the words ‘Metallica’, ‘computer’ (or any I.T. related jargon), or ‘paintballing’ to my parents they immediately go into ‘That’s interesting dear’ mode, and secondly, when was the last time you saw a teenager say anything of importance on TV or radio when not in a play or soap or whatever? This second point may be the fault  of any of the following three: Linkin Park, skateboarding, MTV.  Now a big one or two:  On pop music: Popular culture will be the death of real culture. In fact, it may have already done the deed. Now in a strictly definitional sense, I’ve nothing against pop music per sé, but look at the state of it now. The charts are full of talentless canaries that can dance and mime, the majority of which cannot play an instrument and cannot tell you the first thing about music theory. Ask Peter André to play you, say, Beethoven’s 5th on, say, a violin, and he’d probably scratch his head and say something dumb like ‘Beethoven?’ or ‘Violin?’, before following up with some quickly made-up phrase, which together with some crappy cover will make him millions. And what does poor Beethoven get? Well, quite a lot actually, but he actually worked for it. All Peter does is stand, sing, smile, and make sure his hair is in place. Or rather, pays other people to make sure his hair is in place.  On videogames: Videogames are going much the same way as music went in the 80’s, and it is almost entirely EA’s fault (with a bit of Sony maybe). Why? Because they’re making the industry into a new Hollywood – ‘Hey, get rid of the clever stuff, we just want something we don’t have to think about at all! Let Stephen Hawking or someone do it for us. Loser!’ Take a look at Call of Duty. Yeah, sure, great graphics, and hey look, you can work with your teammates! Then how do you explain the Tiger being the sole type of tank in the game (the half tracks don’t count, they don’t actually do anything), and furthermore how do you explain a Tiger getting blown up by a fuckin’ Panzerfaust-30K, an anti-tank weapon that was meant to be used against LIGHT VEHICLES, not some hulking great Tiger tank with nigh on inpenetratable armour, FROM ANY ANGLE? When I see a Tiger getting blown up from 8 shots to its front turret armour (the strongest point) from a frickin’ anti tank rifle, I know something’s gone wrong. Realism? Why have that when you can have EXPLOSIONS and AMAZINGLY CRAP AND BLATANT SCRIPTING? Y’know, the kind of situation when the enemy won’t attack til you (yes, you!) have walked through a door, regardless of the position of your squad, and where it’s obvious that something bad is about to happen when the game autosaves. It’s enough to make a grown teenager cry. And don’t get me started on the overblown melodrama, because you’ll never hear the end of it.  Back to the short ones:  Despite increasingly bad riots, conflicts and terrorist attacks, people still like violence in almost everything.  Despite scientific proof (probably around somewhere) that it does not make you indescribably cool, people still swear without any reason. I admit that it’s fine to swear when you’re angry or you drop a brick on your foot or something, but swearing for the fun of it is entertainment for morons – and you, god bless you, are NOT a moron – because you are computer literate, you lucky dog, you.  Football is just a game. Get over it.  Despite repeated warnings, threats, pleas etc, some people will just not quit. And in most cases involving people with angry eyebrows and bricks, quitting is the best way.  TV is nowhere near as good as: reading, the Internet, sport, writing, talking, playing or listening to (decent) music, watching plays/films (not made in Hollywood), and last and probably least, studying (I’m serious – The Simpsons is not a suitable alternative to my education). Please, please, please wrench yourself from your comfy chair and go live your life before you’re ALL brainwashed into thinking Britney Spears is actually in fact quite a good singer. Sorry, you’re not, so please don’t argue – and here’s some advice, go get yourself a proper job – or maybe you could just take a Music GCSE, that would get you started. :sigh:  Teenagers: your friends will almost always hate you more than they hate your average rapist or murderer if you  1. have a mullet 2. listen to Metallica or similar 3. go on the Internet for more than an hour each day 4. play any strategy game beyond Command and Conquer (which, may I point out, is in fact just an interactive version of maths, but with graphics and guns – ‘If I send five guys here and they kill those four guys and I lose two guys, the remaining…er…three guys can go and kill the two guys over there and…’) 5. don’t watch TV 6. laugh at unpopular people’s jokes  But don’t despair: instead you can 1. have a couiff 2. listen to Linkin Park 3. scorn anyone who does anything that you didn’t think of 4. play Mario Sunshine for 5 seconds a day and think it is the pinnacle of gaming technology 5. watch TV and then talk endlessly about the things you see on TV, effectively excluding those who don’t watch TV from any conversation 6. beat unpopular people up to impress your friends, who you may notice are now either remarkably like you, or your role models. Either way, they will be your masters and you will be theirs. Scary. Stick to proper people.   Thank you for reading this week’s edition of Things Wrong With The World. Please go fix it, for the love of God, before I have to get off my ass and do it myself.   mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Sorry about the title, I wanted to see what reaction it would provoke. I still can't see, of course, but what the hell.  The world is kinda alright at the moment, if you block out pop music, murders etc. I can play guitar much better than I could seven months ago, I'm on the verge of buying Combat Mission, I'm getting better at writing/typing stuff in general. In the past month I have:      - done 3 English courseworks (which are all As, I think)      - wrote a few opinions on 'dooyoo', a find-out-about-before-you-buy type of site      - maintained a blog pretty well and posted some amusing (I hope) articles on life and stuff messed up  in it      - written a few good new songs  Of course, songs are nothing without a band to play them - and (insert whatever our name is now here) is really screwed up - mostly because of Miles. I'm doing fine, Crem can still solo really well - but Miles is off playing  guitar  when he's meant to be playing  bass , listening solely to Megadeth and nothing else, writing extremely bad music etc. Although Miles and Crem used to be Metallica fans, they now listen to something else and shun Metallica as though they never liked them - and deride me for even singing one line of 'Fuel' because they take the popular view and say it is crap.   And they call themselves non-conformists.  So, back to playing Mercyful Fate and Diamond Head...on my own. :( Well, it's better than the Darkness,  Crem .  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Remember when I said Diamond Head 'rock'? They now   ROCK!  , because I just got the greatest hits album. Sucking My Love Helplessly, I will discover that The Lights are Electric and so will try to Shoot them Out, before getting someone to Call Me In The Heat Of The Night, and discover I Am in fact Bringing Evil Lightning To The Nations. :D  So, anyway...revision day today, since I missed quite a lot last week. Also, I had a fantastical idea for Combat Mission involving a map about 30km square and with massive armies, more like a war than a battle. Alas, some enquiries on the Battlefront forums informed me that this was impossible.  Ah well. The next CM game, maybe. >_  mrpwase@hotmail.com

       Things wrong with the world    A few short ones to start us off:   Somehow, despite the standing of British television in the world (i.e. better than American TV), Pop Idol manages to be popular – and American Idol even more so.  Mercantilism (buying cheaply from the Third World, refining the materials we buy and then selling the manufactured goods back a high prices) still continues, even though the economies of most more economically developed countries (MEDCs) are stronger than ever, and Third World countries have a debt they can’t even pay the interest on.  Fashion exists. Now I have nothing against looking smart, but the extent that the fashion industry has grown to is ridiculous. For God’s sake, just wear comfortable clothes, no matter how they look – only philistines and trend-riders (my collective Enemy Number One) will care.   Rolling out the big guns:   On appearance: Right, first things first, as I have already said, I have nothing against looking smart, but I am appalled at the lengths people go to to make themselves look as good as they can. I can understand wanting to look their best, but who came up the idea of hair gel? It looks hideous and is a pain to put on (I imagine), without any visible benefit. Maybe people think it’s good for their health? Eat some fresh fruit, you poor, moronic people.  Now that’s out of the way, straight to the point: someone doesn’t like my hair. In a perfect world one of us (probably me) could be sent far away so they never actually have to look at my hair, but this is a far from perfect world (I wouldn’t be writing this if it was), and because my hair is, I admit, currently far from perfect, someone has to do something about it.  OR DO THEY?  What is the significance of hair? In the days before insulation, central heating etc. it was a kind of insulator. Sometimes it adds to people’s appearance – if you have healthy-looking hair, people can assume that you’re pretty healthy. But what does hair add to your character? At the very least, hair can be a channel of your personality (crazy big afro for energetic people, sensible short hair for ‘average’ people, mullets for metal heads, combovers for accountants…woah! Must cut back on sterotypes), but reflections are only reflections, remember. My hair is currently a cross between the first two on my list, what is known in the trade as a ‘frullet’ – an afromullet. Big at the front, long-ish at the back. When I comb it, it looks respectable. At weekends I don’t comb it unless I’m going out somewhere, because I don’t see the point in making it smart when the only one that’s going to see it is my dog, and I am certain that my dog shares my view that appearance is a minor factor of character. I urge you to think the same. Grow a mullet! It’s fun to have – you can swing it, you can comb it with a garden fork (a sterilised one, of course – I’m angry at over-appearance, not cleanliness), and at the right moment you can use it as an impromptu weapon.  On religion: 	 Touchy subject, eh? I assure you that, as always, I do not intend to offend anyone (except you, dear Mr André), and that includes their beliefs. I respect all religious figures and all religious people (except for suicide bombers – I just pity them), because on the whole they always have something good to say or do, more so than atheists, agnostics etc.  Now that’s said, I can get down to giving people my view.  My view is: religion is superstition, hokum, lies, fairy stories, bull, and last but not least, opium (thank you Karl Marx).  I simply cannot fathom how global religions with kasquillions of followers can believe every word of books supposedly written two thousand years ago. Even that fact is astounding, and that’s before you consider that it could have been written in the Middle Ages to appease the peasants and serfs (taking the Bible for an example – purely for convenience, I hasten to add). That so much of humanity’s resources and time were/are spent on building churches, mosques, synagogues, gurdwaras, temples etc. when we cannot be anywhere near sure whether there is a God/Allah/whatever, leaves me with my mouth drooping a mile to the floor (no, my legs are not that long, it’s an expression). In this way the only feasible religion is Buddhism, but can you easily follow a religious leader that was supposedly born out of his mother’s side, and who then proceeded to walk and plant lotus flowers with his FEET. Forgive me for being sceptical, but when fairy stories are included in holy books that are supposedly all completely and utterly true, I begin to wonder what crazy mind(s) spawned the concept of religion. Go Dalai Lama!  This is why, like most atheists (surely you’ve gathered I’m an atheist by now), I simply hold all the teachings made by all these religious leaders in high regard. Jesus’ pep talks (again taking the Bible as a purely convenient example), while supposedly taking place two thousand years ago, still apply today, almost down to washing each others’ feet…I think. Jesus doesn’t need to be the ALMIGHTY SON OF GOD. All he needs is a mouth and someone willing to make notes, and hey presto, it’s a way of life that would put most Westerners to shame. Thank you, Coach Jesus.  Thank you for reading this week’s edition of Things Wrong With The World. Please go fix it, for the love of God, before I have to get off my ass and do it myself.  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      ...might as well get some Smirnoff Ice...  lalala...etc.  How come everyone wants to get drunk when they're 15, only to realise (well, not everyone then) that it's a waste of time?  Ignore me, it's late. The Diamond Head is starting to jar on my brain, and my sister is talking to me on MSN. And I'm dreaming, right?  If this makes sense, I deserve an award. Help DNA's film today!

      I think this will help explain my custom title on MSN...Sucking My Love is a song by Diamond Head on the aforementioned 'Best Of Diamond Head' album. Here are the lyrics:   Sucking My Love  Over and under, do you go down to the sea Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Sweet and timely caress, dear babe fulfillin' me I can feel her heart, it is beating down inside Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Tasty, tasty, tasty, tasty Into her valley, all her charms taste of love Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Fragrance of my dreams, yeah go down, take my love Oh yeah, yeah Taste my bitter wine, cos there's something boiling up inside Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Tasty, tasty, tasty, tasty Faster......love.... Make me go..... Shoot me Faster, faster Love, sucking my love Oh Lord, sucking my love Oh Lord, sucking my love  ...strike you as odd at all? Here's another clue; the 'Faster...love...make me go....shoot me...' part (i.e. the bridge) is about 4 minutes long and consists of a long solo,  assorted melodic pieces from some kind of guitar, and Sean Harris moaning and saying 'faster, faster'.  Still haven't guessed? It's a song about  blowjobs . And that, my friends, is one of the reasons why I'm going insane (the other reasons are mainly other people's insanity).  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      A friend of mine came up with a theory that goes something like 'cheese is not everything, and not everything is everything, so everything is cheese.' It's a load of bull, but at the moment humanity is really pissing me off, so it's my motto of the month. The one I carry around in the picture holder in my wallet.  Dictionary.com's definition of a friend: n.  A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.  A person whom one knows; an acquaintance.  A person with whom one is allied in a struggle or cause; a comrade.  One who supports, sympathizes with, or patronizes a group, cause, or movement: friends of the clean air movement.  Friend A member of the Society of Friends; a Quaker.   What my friends are like: 'friend' (of Hollers), noun, someone who constantly insults Hollers, undermines his achievements and laughs at/exploits his flaws.  That's a big part of why humanity is evil at the moment. mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Look, a song about Greeks! Kinda.  The Task  Shadows dancing Higher and higher Painting black pictures on the wall Demented laughs echo In the night air Victims moan, their faces pall Knife clashes On the stone Sharpening for the strike Logs add to The growing fire Cultists stand, laughing alike  Breaking the barrier to a higher plane Contact the master, struggle in vain Receive the orders, do the deed To the last defend the demons’ seed Smash and grab, raid and steal Make their followers bend and kneel Bring back victims to the altar Sacrifice to god of slaughter  Bringing pain to a new frontier…yeah Enclose them in chains and encloak them with death Make their lives hell with your steel’s mercy Convert them to evil with their last breath  Burn down their temples, deface their false gods Shout out my name make them answer with nods Flatten their will and make them your slaves Bring them all back to the hallowed enclaves  Bringing pain to a new frontier…yeah Enclose them in chains and encloak them with death Make their lives hell with your steel’s mercy Convert them to evil with their last breath  Stand in the circle, utter the words Offer the dust to circling birds Chant the mantra, block the light Bring in the victim, besieged with blight Prepare the slab, lay him on it cold Guard him with care lest he be bold Bring in the priest, give him the knife Only beginning, ages of strife  One last raid Before the end There are others Free wills to bend Set fire to their tents Topple the towers Despatch the defence Slay their powers Rush to the fort Batter with stones Slaughter their lord Bring back their bones  Now your task is complete The demon will arise again   Pretty satanic, eh? I wrote it last month or so, but I was in a dark age (so to speak), so it hasn't seen the light of day until now. Enjoy - and no stealing! mrpwase@hotmail.com

      ...which is why I'm posting another song today.   Endless Road  (quite slow, without distortion) Trudging down this endless road Carrying my mental load Cannot stop; though I see the end Hidden behind every bend No companion none to see None to witness my misery None to help with my fight No-one can help my helpless plight  (fill)  Landmarks pass; yet unknown For no map of death I own Alone, I overcome each hill Moving while time has stood still Every time I try to rest Horrors come back to molest Is this what my life is to be? Fatigue is slowly killing me  (fill, solo with distortion a la Nothing Else Matters)  (drums stop) What is this; do I see the end Of journey still with heart to rend Renewed hope restores my might I run to the receding light…  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Awright, now I have a guestbook up, so you can actually respond - if anyone is reading, which I seriously doubt they are. Ah well...I've got site stats up as well, so I know exactly (to the nearest million :P) how many people are reading. Thank you, Bravenet.  I just head part of 'Evil' by Mercyful Fate, and decided it sounded awful, so from now on I respect MF only in their music-writing ability,  not  in their playing ability - sure, they can play, but they make it sound awful. It's sad when Metallica can do things better than the original - without trying.  Ah well...back to my 'Into the Coven' cover!  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      I'd forgotten what sleeping till 11am was like. Bliss...  Anyway...I have a great idea for a new 'massively multiplayer online first person shooter' or MMOFPS (like Planetside, not Everquest, that's an MMORPG), and I...won't be posting the details up here any time soon because it's simply too big to fit on one page. Or something.  My sister's wedding on Thursday - that's why I had to cut my hair. I cry for my lack of free will and expression.  My friends got more and more lenient towards the end of term, and they were almost  laughing at my jokes  by the time school was over. Must be the haircut. GRR!

      Revision + me = GCSE pass + unhappy me  Or something like that - I guess I can't be unhappy with passing exams, unless they're a medical exam for some disease or something.  Anyway...I can't give you any excuses beyond 'revision', which isn't really an excuse. But things are moving along with the band very well (we've made 1/2 songs over the past few weeks) and I finally bought Combat Mission, which is a truly excellent game. So...good times. Gimultlichite. Stillgestanden, gefreiter!*  That's about it. I now have about three more-or-less regular readers, which isn't bad, all things considered.

      And so I renew my campaign against the trendriders with vigour and the backing of my power metal band, my Flying V at my side and a bandana around my head. DEATH TO NU-METAL!  I've just been to a charity gig at my school, and apart from one vaguely good band with some kind of solo and proper rhythm (not just the same chord over and over), the rest were UTTER CRAP (sorry Jason, your drumming was the single redeeming feature of The Red Army). I went into a trance after the first two songs, and only got relief when my band assembled outside to show them some PROPER music. Unfortunately, the only person that watched was our bassist, who didn't have his bass. The rest of the people there were teachers pretending to be punk rockers and 'yoof' pretending to be cool by copying EVERYONE ELSE  EXACTLY . We were the only scrap of originality left in the room. Whatever happened to the music? Where did all this nu-shit come from? Why have Metallica started playing it? Has the world gone crazy?  So our band is regrouping for another assault on the trendriders, a 'metal up your ass!' kinda assault (but not literally - who do you think we are?). We have three songs penned and have a fourth to be finished this Monday Bank Holiday, so sometime next year we'll be rockin' our little cotton socks off on the same stage we watched those talentless fools prance around and scream on.  Wish us luck - and lots of riffing will be sent your way.  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      So I neglected the blog. It's not MY fault. Grr.  I got shoved off the internet and back onto a Half-Life binge (not necessarily a bad thing...) because of my GCSEs - my parents thought this was a cunning move because it would get me to do more revision. It didn't work. When I'm not playing Half-Life or composing on Sibelius (borrowed from Crem), I'm watching TV or reading. No revision for me unless I want to. But I still do revision before the exams start at school - it's all I really need at this stage, after all the revision I did over the past few months.  So how am I on the internet? I'm banned at school after I hacked Weez's account and sent some rude emails to his dad's business associates (purely by mistake), so I've found a modem extension lead and have locked my parents out of the house...or maybe just waited until they went out. Win!  The exams have been going great so far (that sentence must be quite rare), although I have developed the worrying habit of finishing about 10 minutes into each exam - which everyone else has taken as a sure sign that I'm going to fail - but the I'm 99% sure that the answers I've written are mostly correct, which means at least a B in everything, right? That's exactly what I'm aiming for. At least a B in everything, along with As in History, English, Spanish and RS, so I can continue them in the Sixth Form. Life is good - which is strange, because usually in exam periods I feel suicidal. Maybe it's Pizza Hut lunches every day, and the fact that Black Ice now have a whole TWO SONGS fully written out (minus lyrics), and all we need now is a drummer and a...metronome...  Awright, enough of my bludgeoning. We leave you with news that Upton is a gnome, Weez had manboobs but then sold them to dodgy American CEOs, and Simon is still one big Mancunian pidgeon. I am master! Master of...in-jokes!  Don't expect to understand any of that.  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Today was a  great  day. My RS GCSE was easy, and included a lot of essay style questions, which I seem to excel at. Excellent - I'm hoping to take English, History, Spanish and Philosophy for AS/A level, and three of those are 'essay' subjects.  The morning was dominated by a band practice, during which we effectively finished half of 'Judgemaster', one of Miles' songs. I played drums, since we still don't have a drummer, but other than that - the song sounded amazing, if I do say so myself.  And to top it all off, I saw two of my old friends from primary school in Pizza Hut - who recognised me instantly, despite my drastic hair changes since Year 6. Woo!  The only downside is that no-one's on MSN Messenger to share it with. Why is no-one else ever online? Grr!  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Last Saturday I started my new 'job' at one of my dad's friend's plant nurseries. I get £3.50 an hour for doing assorted gardening jobs, like weeding and watering plants. The only problem I've had so far is that the guy that runs the place asked me if I wanted any coffee while I was weeding this morning. When I accepted, he asked if I wanted milk or sugar. Concentrating on the weeding, I said neither, but once I had thought about it I yelled after him, 'Milk, please!'. But of course he didn't hear, and so I got some black coffee. It's a shame I'm not an American, or I would have actually drunk it, but as it happens I took a few sips and then poured it on a plant. Let's just hope the plant doesn't like milk...  Anyway...last night I finally managed to challenge Upton to a game of Combat Mission (CMBB to be precise) through direct connection (i.e. data is sent directly from computer to computer). It was remarkably fast, but then again both our computers are very fast, and Upton has broadband, so all the data is processed on his computer. Unfortunately, he left after 3 (out of 20) turns, so I didn't get to thrash him.  That's all that's happened today. Que va!  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      After several months of refurbishment, our house's study is now recarpeted and now contains the beginnings of...some organisation and tidiness! Before, in the 'old' version of the study, my part was tidy (pffrt), and my dad's part was...well, let's just say that you couldn't see the computer without shifting several piles of old brochures. Now we've cleaned it out and recarpeted it, it actually looks nice. All I need now is a desk lamp, some drawing pins/Rawlplugs for my big Master of Puppets flag, and broadband - all of which shall be granted after my GCSEs. Win!  Rise of Nations is the game of the moment - I've always been a big fan of Age of Empires, and Rise of Nations adds all the things that were inherently  missing  from the original AoE, while keeping the stuff that made it great. If you don't know much about RoN, you can get some more information at some kind of website somewhere (get it yourself, you lazy sod!) but it's basically AoE with national borders and generals and stuff. Eetsa grood. Great and good.  I keep having really astoundingly great ideas for games (an MMOFPS where players start out as soldiers in one of four empires, but can break away and found their own mini empires, build more structures, make more tanks and guns, capture more territory, and basically play a MMOG version of Risk, but with the combat modelled by individual soldiers controlled by different players), but I have to face up to the reality that none of them will ever get made.  Ah well...roll on The Sims 2!  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Today was a typically  awesome  day, at least by my standards - and crazily enough, it included a History GCSE, which was quite easy. The questions were on the NHS, which was the last topic I happened to revise before I went to bed last night. As a result, I found I knew a load about the introduction of the NHS, blah blah, I'm sure you don't want to hear this but I'll tell you anyway, and in the end I (quite confidently and a tad arrogantly) predict myself...at least a B. Which is good for my chances of getting into the Sixth Form, since I've got a feeling I've got at least a B in the four subjects I want to do for AS level - History, English (language more than literature), Spanish, and Philosophy (for which I need a B or more in Religious Studies).  After our exam, Crem and I restarted our musical steamroller heading towards worldwide domination (what a cool metaphor) by practicing 'Judgemaster' and parts of 'Devil's Knights' - all of which you can find, lyricwise, at  urlLink this grotto of musical mastery . After a lunch of...chips, we launched an documentary on tourism in Stratford by touring the streets with Crem's camcorder and recording anyone we could see - whether or not they were tourists. Eventually we made our way to the Music Shop to get Crem some new plectrums, and on the way back ran into some girls who wanted to touch Crem's hair and claimed they were tourists and so were entitled to be included on the video, and would they be famous?   I don't know why I'm telling you this.  Anyway, we eventually ended up making some short Monty-Python style sketches with a drum machine and Crem's guitar, which were firmly in the zany madcap humour genre, before departing our seperate ways to travel home and write to our blogs. Only I went to my guitar lesson first and learnt three whole Iron Maiden riffs and how to gallop in sets of three!  So there we are. My perfect day. And a far from perfect blog post, I know. Hey, once the exams are over I'll get back to my moaning about the world and stuff that inhabits it, but until then, you can just gripe to me.

      Today was very strange. We had a band practice schedueled for midday today, but since Miles didn't turn up we went into town to record a 'tourist documentary' (basically walking around with Crem's camcorder recording random people that look like tourists. We'd encountered two girls (both 15, I think) yesterday who were talking to another guy in our year (I may have already mentioned them, I can't remember), but we saw them walking around again today (from now on they're the 'camera girls'. Crem hatched an ingenious scheme to impersonate Russian intelligence officers (well, actually that was me) obtaining incriminating evidence using a camcorder, but our thick Russian accents and our threats to have the secret police 'summarily execute anyone who gets in the way' didn't fool the camera girls, and they just walked up and started saying they wanted to find 'the shop'.   We were understandably confused - which shop, we asked? 'Y'know, the shop!' 'Oh, what's it called...it's in like a little alley...' They explained that they were staying in Stratford as part of a 'religious retreat' program (don't ask me what the hell that is), and that they wanted a present for their 'prayer buddy', who was apparently a gangster that smoked and took drugs and 'all kinds of cool stuff'. Crem suggested Party Pzazz, a little gift/balloon shop in a shopping arcade called The Minories, which seemed to be the right place, so we started walking there - while the girls asked about all our personal details, apologised for following us around yesterday, and asked why we were following them around. Crem managed to dodge the question (I don't think KGB interrogations would have gone down too well), and eventually we found the shop, where one of the girls bought a small teddy bear on a keychain. A teddy bear that had a spliff in its mouth. Good grief.  The other girl protested that she wanted to go the toilet, so we went off in search of some toilets - eventually reaching the cinema, which was the only place we could think of that had toilets. We had a chance to make a clean getaway to actually get something done (like a practice, or a sketch), but Crem was worried that we might offend them. Before I could argue back, the girls came out again. We finally went to HMV, because the girls claimed they were bored, but we finally left them looking at hip-hop singles. The last quote: 'We'll remember you forever!', to which I shouted back, 'and I'll have forgotten you in five minutes!'  So, all in all, a very strange day. We never found out their names, their ages, anything - just that they were from Coventry and they were 'religious freaks'. A warning to all sane people: never go to Coventry without an armoured car, a barbed wit or a big baseball bat.  Tune in next time for more: mrpwase@gmail.com

      Nah, I do have some stuff to include in the fun-filled update. :sigh:  If you check the archives you will find a post or two where you can learn all about Planetside. If you can't be bothered: Planetside is a  M assivly  M ultiplayer  O nline  F irst  P erson  S hooter, basically a very large online futuristic sci-fi war, that I used to play. Great fun 'n' all, but in the end I had to leave because I only had (and still have) 56K, and that ain't good for a game with thousands of players online at once in such a complicated game as Planetside. Basically, I got  MONSTER LAG , to the point where it got unbearable. So I left, vowing never to return.  Four months later and I just wanna go back on...so I've made a plan. Once I get broadband (which won't be long now), I'll bring back my Planetside subscription (the characters are still there) and start a new outfit, the Sturmoviks, which consists almost entirely of Reaver pilots (Reavers are like a cross between a fighter jet and an Apache helicopter i.e. vertical take off and landing + impressive speed + rockets and machine guns for ground attack), with a few Mosquito scout fighters. I've already set up an 'Avid Gamers' community, which you can visit  urlLink here  if you really want to. Hopefully before long I'll be on Planetside binges before the holidays are up.  One last thing...Stats exam (also last exam) tomorrow. And since I've had this blog for a long time, I get a free GMail account, which you can contact at  urlLink mrpwase@gmail.com , if you so wish.  mrpwase@gmail.com

      BIG change of plan with regards to Planetside. I've just been talking to Loxy, my old clan's leader. I told him about the Sturmovik outfit, but he asked why I didn't just restart  urlLink TLF's  PS section (everyone left a while ago because they got bored). A bit of a tricky decision - after all, I'd only just set the damn thing up - but I've just deleted the Sturmovik community, and Loxy's getting the TLF:PS forums back up again. With any luck, Auriel (my second in command) won't get  too  mad. Hehe.  Also, I've now fully set my mic up, and it's working brilliantly - even on 56K! This may just be because of MSN Messenger being very good at its job, but I have downloaded Teamspeak 2, which works quite well on 56K too. Imagine what it'll be like on broadband!  Awright, see you/read me in the morning.   urlLink mrpwase@gmail.com

      Today was my last exam, Statistics. I spent last night revising (for once), and I managed to learn what standard deviation and Spearman's rank were much faster than I did in school. Hooray for revision guides!  The exam istelf wasn't too bad, although one question really confused me - it asked me for the distribution of some data, but I didn't have a clue how to even start that, so I left it. That's the only question I left, thank god.  Now, to business - my old TLF teammate UPLiNX (aka Auriel) has set up a TS server, meaning that the Sturmovik outfit for Planetside is now just about ready to go. I've got the Avid Gamers community all set up ( http://sturmovik.avidgamers.com ), we have all of three members (a prospective fourth is trying to secure a credit card to pay the subscription fee for Planetside), and I've come up with a really good SOP (standard operating procedure) for flying our Reavers - basically just flying in pairs rather than in one big group. That way, both Reavers can cover the other guy in that pair, and two Reavers are always better (and have more firepower) than one. Lastly, one Reaver can distract the enemy while the other sneaks up behind them and rocket spams them (fires a lot of rockets continuously until the target is destroyed).  Sounds like fun? I yearn for the open battlefield again - despite its drawbacks, Planetside is the only (and therefore best) of its genre (Neocron doesn't count), and the times I had with the TLF (my old clan) are unforgettable - like that time I crashlanded a Reaver into that tower, taking enemies with me - or when I was the Galaxy dropship pilot, and we managed to drop into an enemy base without anyone noticing and capture it while people were still defending it - or the time when...   urlLink mrpwase@gmail.com

      Has anyone got a random title generator out there? Preferably one that makes sense? Any generator would make more sense than my titles.  Enough of this gay banter. I have to go to my step-cousin's 21st birthday tonight, which I percieve as grossly unfair. I mean, I'd go anyway - no problem, I'd feel a little uncomfortable around all these people in a family where teenagers don't exist, but doesn't that happen everyday anyway? No, my problem with it is that I was forced to go, even before I had a chance to say that I'd go anyway. Now, politeness defines that you should accept every offer and invitation to avoid the risk of offending the person on the other end, but that's the one part of politeness I don't get. If people get offended when people don't come to their party, then why don't they get the message and stop trying to talk to those people? It's not as if I feel I have the same obligation to my step-relatives as to my real relatives. I really couldn't care less that my step-cousin is celebrating her 21st birthday - send her a card and forget about it. Leave the people who actually want to go to her party, go to it.  That's the problem with families - they often force you into relationships with people you don't like. And the people you  do  like get offended when you don't take a shine to their friends. The same thing applies to in-laws, I'm told.  Anyway...it scares me slightly that I'm so cold-hearted I'd rather play Planetside than visit a relative. I mean, anyone would visit a relative if they were sick or something, but if they don't really need anything, why bother them? I keep to myself unless people want something. My social life is my band, my close friends, some of my family (most of my dad's side of the family are great), and occasionally a semi-social life with online friends (but what's the difference? You're still talking to them, right?). I don't feel a particular need to talk to anyone else, unless they're an offical, the police, a shopkeeper, etc.  What I mean is, the people I don't want to talk to should leave me alone unless there is something genuinely meaningful they want to do or say that involves me. Meanwhile, I can spend time with the people I want to talk to. It's a win-win situation. I find it hard to believe that anyone would be genuinely 100% interested in what I have to say. In fact, thinking through my mental list of people I know, the only people I can think of that would listen are my sister and my dad. I mean, if something really was important, even the man/woman on the street would listen (i.e. "My house is on fire and I lost my mobile, can I borrow yours!?"), but when it's something not as urgent, 99% of people simply wouldn't listen properly.  Enough gloom and doom. I found a great little webcomic (little in the sense of not being mainstream - it's been going since 1998) called Ozy and Millie ( http://www.ozyandmillie.org ), which contains cutesy animals-dressed-as-humans-and-acting-like-humans tackling the issues of conformity and morality in American/Americanised society (i.e. everywhere but Tibet). I recommend you go there now and download the whole back-catalogue (for free, of course), then sit back with a cup of tea (I insist on tea, no coffee or beer) and read through the whole thing. You will laugh, you will punch the air in delight ("one in the eye for the corporate profit whores!" etc.), you will be touched/moved to tears, you will love it - unless you're a conformist. In which case, what the hell are you doing reading my blog? Get out of my office! *mumble mumble must fix that anti-conformity hack mumble mumble*  I'll post again if I survive the celebrations of my much-loved step-cousin, but be warned, I will probably never be the same again...   urlLink mrpwase@gmail.com

      Finally! A disposable title template. 'The Zen of...' Thank you, oh ye gods of inspiration.  No thanks, however, to the gods of making me go to parties which I obviously will not fit in at, will hate, and will inevitably have to go back to the car to maintain a last outpost against the crap the band were playing with '...And Justice For All' playing on full. At midnight. Phew.  The party, as I predicted, was awful - like all other social functions not involving headbangers like me. I spent the whole frickin' time either sitting down on a bale of straw and cursing the band (which played a lot of Beach Boys etc.) or cutting bagguettes in half with a knife so other people could eat them. I didn't have time to get one myself - result, I had to have a big breakfast this morning, then go and work for four hours.  The problem, I think, with that party was that I was the problem. I mean, there were a total of four people there, and I was the joint-oldest. What does that tell you? There was my cousin Jack (who's 9, I think) and some people who are probably distinctly related to me (but if they aren't, the girl was pretty hot), but the rest were either conformist emo-goons or hopelessly old people still trying to be 'hip' by dancing. I was probably the solely  original  person there, which is not a good thing.  So, anyway...my work this morning was great. I'm finally getting the hang of things, and today's work was easy - pick up branches and brambles and stuff them on the back of a trailer. I even got to drive a Land Rover. I consider that an achievement.  So, anyway...here's an Ozy and Mille strip for you (I think they're the best thing since sliced 8-Bit Theatre)...   I plan to steal this strip's thunder...I mean, promote it further, by including all the strips (in order) with every day's posting for your further viewing enjoyment.  No, seriously, this strip is the best thing I've found on the Internet for ages. It renews my hope that someone, somewhere, must understand that crass commericalism and conformity are destroying humanity and making us frickin' robots.   urlLink mrpwase@gmail.com

      Today was awright. We had to go into school (and we have to go back again tomorrow, but after that we're free...) to sort out some stuff regarding the Sixth Form at KES, like our possible tutor and subject groups. I was really interested in the Philosophy meeting (I'm starting to get a lot more interested in philosophy, especially since I've been reading  urlLink Ozy and Millie ), but it does require me to start buying a lot of books to read (since the teacher's a stingy git who can't buy them from his budget, but instead thinks that buying himself a new laptop is more important). So...that was good.  There are a  lot  of new people that might be in the Sixth Form, which hopefully includes some form of metalhead, instead of another wave of pathetic nu-metal conformists. Grr.  So, anyway...I've decided, since yesterday's post was kinda screwed up by the direct posting of the Ozy and Millie comic, I'm just going to link to the next comic, ad infitum. But I want you to promise you'll read it, because it deserves a larger audience than I guess it already has.    urlLink This is that link.     urlLink mrpwase@gmail.com

      Crazy! Crem's camcorder is truely a blessing. We've been making hilarious..recordings, rather than sketches. If you've seen the 'Confuse-a-Cat' sequence from Monty Python's Flying Circus, you'll understand what I'm about to try and explain. If you haven't you're pretty much screwed. I'm not famed for my powers of explanation (gotta write that one down :D).  So...what we did was filmed one of us (out of Crem and I) doing something like jumping up and over a sofa, then stopping the recording while the other guy was in midjump, and then switching roles and starting the recording from where the other guy 'left off'. For example; I run and kick the door, run up to the sofa and launch off it (which is where Crem stops recording). Then I pick up the camcorder and watch Crem do the same thing I did, only I start recording just as he's launching off. When you playback the tape, it looks as if the person jumping has changed in mid-air. It's great!  Not only that, but you can do crazy stuff like having people lie down on the floor, then 'move them around' by filming them in one place, then slightly to the left, then more to the left, etc. We managed to make me (and occasionally Crem, if that makes sense) jump over the sofa, land on my face, do a twist while still flat on my stomach, zoom towards a row of tables and then mount the table without moving a muscle, then stand up, turn to face along the row of table, jump and slide along the tables, stop at the end suddenly, then jump (changing person in mid-air of course) and crash through the door.  Then I walked back in, 'transformed' into Crem, who walked up to an empty space and started to fall backwards, then transform into me and land on a magically appearing sofa - which then disappears, leaving Crem to fall to the floor. I know it may take some thinking about to work out what the hell I'm on about, but if you see the video we're making, you'll know what I mean - and with any luck you'll be laughing so hard you'll be crying. Crem and I were.  So, anyway...no more school til sixth form! 8 weeks of band practice, crazy sketches and Planetside - and mowing the lawn, doing odd garden  work as my job, and other such chores/bores. But no matter - there's no frickin' homework! Woo!  No Ozy and Millie this time. If you wanna see it (and you do), the address can be found  urlLink here . I'm currently trying to work out how to draw Millie properly. I can do a decent Ozy having his feet superglued to the floor.   urlLink mrpwase@gmail.com

      I'm not sure he has any. 'I show my appreciation for Kuwait by invading it.' It doesn't work.  So anyway... urlLink Saddam Hussein, trial, big hoo-hah , he says he's innocent and that George Bush is the real villain (in my opinion they both are). I don't really care, so long as it's just over and done with and various Western countries stop attacking small countries, and those small countries stop insulting/threatening the said Western countries. Alright, say you hate America. A lot of people do, but that's no reason to start killing Americans. What are you trying to achieve? They'll just keep makin' more in that lovable way of theirs.  You can't expect to take on America with anything less than Nuclear ICBMs, and if you have those I'm not supporting you in any way until you get rid of them and stop fucking up the world. That goes for America too. Take Switzerland's example (or is it Sweden? I forget). They simply haven't got an army - they don't need one. No-one thinks of attacking Switzerland, despite their being an extremely easy target. Geneva remains the place where everyone holds their peace talks. Switzerland is the land of peace and harmony that's not meant to exist. Imagine how much better the world would be if everyone just became Switzerland. I wouldn't mind having a Swiss world state - free Army Knives for all!  So, anyway...more sketch madness tomorrow with Crem and Miles and a camcorder (and possibly my dog in a hat). In the meantime, you'll just have to...wait some more. I may or may not post some proper artistic sketches based on  urlLink Ozy and Millie  at the weekend, although the probability that I post them will be in direct proportion to the amount of adoring emails and guestbook signs I get in the next 48 hours.   urlLink mrpwase@gmail.com

      No, really. Today is a day of rest. I can't go on Planetside, since I still haven't reactivated my account. I don't want to play guitar. There's nothing I want from town. Miles and Crem can't come round to practice. I guess I'll have to complete Call of Duty for the sixth time.  mrpwase@hotmail.com

      Really big, generally good Ozy and Millie community fansite link  urlLink coming right up . I've already registered on the forums - the people there look really cool with regards to intelligence and forum knowledge, and if I stay I'll be talking about an interest I share with all the members - a sure-fire formula for forum fun! Erm...forget I just said that.  Job tomorrow - other than that, I have a feeling next week is going to be even better than this week has been.   urlLink mrpwase@gmail.com

      I'm in a MEEEEAN mood, which is strange because I feel perfectly happy and very angry at the same time. Almost righteously so in the case of the latter. I'm in the best mood possible, it seems - smiting my moral enemies and feeling really good about it.  So anyway...I have a new rant, related to Planetside;  People on Planetside aren't following orders. You may accuse me of having inaccurate information (well, actually, you may not, but you should be!) because I haven't actually played Planetside for about three months, but going by posts on the  urlLink Planetside Official Forums  and my past experience, I can come to many conclusions. 1) That the majority of Planetside players are just in it to get 'experience' (if you have enough experience you gain a level, which gives you more status and weapons), instead of playing it for what it is -  a game . 2) That some of these people are idiotic beyond belief, and don't care if you say that to them online (although if you say it to their face, they'll probably beat you up). 3) That this is popular culture's fault.  Now, of course, I may just be jumping to conclusions, but it seems to be that instead of making people think for themselves, any recent 'cultural revolutions' haven't changed people in the slightest. People nowadays now don't care what you say about them (unless they're a celebrity/politician, in which case they won't care publicly, but will send an assassination squad the same day), and they are suddenly acutely aware of their rights (but not, it seems, of their duties).  Back to Planetside. I noticed during my time as a squad leader that several people just wandered off to do their own thing. I asked one why he was doing this, and he said he was scouting. I then asked why he was scouting a base we weren't planning on attacking, as everyone else on the server was there. He replied that he was now just playing on his own. I asked him to rejoin the squad, which was preparing to assault an enemy base. He complained that the fighting was better than where we were.  Let's stop there for a moment. When you join a squad in Planetside, it's common courtesy to actually listen to the squad leader. Despite this, some people take the opportunity the squad offers (shared experience, i.e. if someone else in the squad gets a kill, everyone in the squad gets some experience from it) to play as a 'lone wolf' with added benefits of not being properly alone.  How selfish can you get? Planetside is meant to be for fun, and yet instead of helping us out with our mission, this guy goes off to where the fighting is more concentrated - that way he gets more experience for his kills, and he gets experience from our kills too. I promptly kicked him from the squad.  Times may have changed on Planetside, since the game structure was modified slightly, but there still remains a certain impertinence among some of the players. It disgusts me that although most of these people are about 20-21, I can be (and am) more mature than them - and I'm 15. There's something inherently wrong with society when even I can act more grown-up than a...grown-up.  I blame pop music. I don't see how, but it all seems connected.

      The greatest thing about the holidays is that the only work I have to do is my job on Sundays.  The second greatest thing is that I can now play some semblance of Planetside again. At least, I will be able to when I subscribe, which will hopefully be tonight. Then I'll spend tomorrow drawing O&M or something while the patches download - on 56K all the patches from release to the present take about 36 hours to download. But that doesn't worry me - AOL has proved itself to be adept at staying online over long periods of inactivity, and I'm prepared to wait.  My main problem is that Vadar and Auriel (two of the members of the TLF who have helped re-start the Planetside section) are getting bored of playing on their own. I have to get on PS sharpish and sort out the TLF before they leave out of boredom.  Aside from that, it's more sketches and...um...drawing, and band practicing. Bliss.   urlLink mrpwase@gmail.com
