      Hey Everyone!  I decided to start the O-Files to keep people updated while I'm away at college so this is my first entry.   I went shopping today for some actual school supplies. I decided to go with Pens over Mechanical pencils. Me and Britt went to Staples where I got some college ruled paper and a quadralined composition book to use as a lab journal for chemistry this year. At staples we ran into Mrs. Raz and she talked about what a HUGE waste of time the leadership conferences are. AND I found out that there is a new principle at WTVL! that should be really exciting and I'm sorry I left before getting a  chance to have him. He sounded really cool from what she said. Mr. Phair appearently left to be the head of the vocational school in Augusta, how COOL is that??!?! anyway Mrs. Raz said that the new guy is young and really laid back. Hopefully he won't be corrupted by Mr. Frame and Mr. Pouler. Appearently nothing ever happens at the leadership conferences. silly silly people! anyway, that's all for the first O-File

      Greetings everyone!,  I wrote the title semi-spanish which is funny because I'm really bad at foreign languages!   Today I found out that I move in between 9 AM and 11 AM on August 23rd THAT IS SO EXCITING! 10 DAYS!!!!! OMG!!!!! I talked to My Academic Advisor Rebecca Torre and she told me to talk to the head of the math department. The Reason I called my academic advisor is because according to the results of my math exam I was placed in to FOUNDATIONS OF CALCULUS 1 which is the CALCULUS course! and I never took PRE-CALCULUS in high school so I figured that might be important to take that before CALCULUS! so anyway worked 11-6 then went to the gap after work to look at these computer cases they had. They have all these "attachables" to go on their book bags. They have Cell Phone cases, Key Rings, MP3 player Cases, and then the compact computer cases. So I go up with 1 pair of socks-5.00, Key Ring-(originally 7.50 marked down to 4.99) MP3 player case-7.99 and the computer case, 19.50 so I pay and it comes to 44.10 so I take my recpit and I look at it as I walk out of the store. I realize it says "Cell Case" for 9.50 instead of the key ring that should've been 4.99. So I go back, and the girl doesn't understand that it was the wrong tag it was hanging on and she gets the manager and finally she does a return for 9.50 then scans it again and overrides the price for 4.99 when she should've scanned the correct bar code, but the Gap is cool like that.  The MP3 Player case was too big and the Computer case was too small so I'm returning them both tomorrow and I MIGHT buy a Sling bag that's really nice and has lots of room, but I'm not sure. I work 12-3 tomorrow if anyone wants to come shop at AE! All jeans on sale now! 5 dollars off!  That's all for today, ttyl  John
