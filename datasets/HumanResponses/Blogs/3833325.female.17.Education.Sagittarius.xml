      it began to rain. Fortuneately Dave had bought them all ponchos, so they sheltered under them.  Soon an evil fairy appeared to them, and revealed that it was called snorkmaiden. The evil fairy told them not to go to...

      ...find what you all desire/need, and only then can you go home and avoid looking eachother in the eye afterwards.' The group stared at eachother, all felt that they were happy so what could they possibly need? 'How about looking in the mirror from Harry Potter that showed your hearts desire?' suggested Vicky 'And where is this mirror?' inquired Rob 'We'd have to ask Dumbledore' 'But...' and so on and so forth Rob destroyed Vicky's logic till the Davemother who knew Vicky to be right, stopped Rob by giving him blue eyes, rosy cheeks and a cute little dog to complete the sissy look. Rob hid behind a tree. 'Now listen,' the davemother said, 'i will give you a clue for what Rob needs...or I shall just tell you cause he really needs MODESTY!' 'Do not, Im perfect!' Rob proclaimed The others looked at eachother and agreed first get the modesty before midnight (well you know that someone would kill Rob if he didnt have some by then) and then after to search for this mirror and seek what each desired. The fairy davemother was to come along to, to finally rid her/himself of this cross dressing curse bestowed by someone with a poor sense of humour. And off they went on their journey but had not gone far when...

So, quickly restyling his hair, Rob asked the fairy Davemother what their quest was to be.   "Well," he said  "what you must do is..."

They all looked around in amazement, it was all there, the little yellow bricks, the house that crashed there cause dorothy hadnt passed drivers ed. and rob...in the red sparkly shoes which oddly suited him with the little pig tails and checkered dress he was wearing, however, thought Bri, red lipstick just isnt his colour! Rob blushed and a tear fell from his eye! Then bubbles began to appear and the fairy came to tell them their quest. You guessed it was gonna be Dave right? well you were completely....

Suddenly, Vicky flew in through the window, proclaiming:  "Put your fingers in your ears, hold your nose, and swallow three times!"  Rob did as she said; the result was instantaneous: Everyone started laughing, which didn't help.  Rob continued hiccuping, until he stopped.  Then he pulled out a...

Rob looked out at the empty, birdless sky and raised an eyebrow. Meanwhile Emily woke up in the back seat and saw that as the other two were arguing they were rapidly approaching a wall. There was nothing else she could do but...

He stared out his window and looked at a blue speck approaching him. As it got closer it grew in size till it became the car out of Harry Potter. With Bri in the driving seat Rob was apprehensive, but with a final look at his mess...cough...room, he got in the flying car which flew to the clouds, and was looking out the window once more when he realised there was another in the car. It was none other than....

      Once upon a time, Rob was really damn sexy. Lots of women had commented on this. They siad to him:   "Rob, you are a sexy bitch"  "thank you" said Rob  "Thou speakest truth" Said God.  And so, sitting in his enchanted glade, Rob was quite content with life. He just been sailing with a happy goblin, who was very happy.  In the heat of the day, Rob dozed off. He awoke a few hours later to the sound of smashing. Looking into his portable welsh dresser (where he kept all of his chinaware,) he saw something smashing. It was a piece of paper that said:  "Congratulations, Rob, you have won £1,000!"  It was the first time Rob had ever heard paper speak.    Reaching behind him, he picked up his phone, and rang his bank manager to tell him the good news.  They were celebrating together when suddenly...

      ok this is the random story 2 For this you cant post anything two times in a row, you have to wait for someone else to continue. comment on how good/bad the story is, the titles are the story. ALWAYS have a cliff hanger ending! here is the first random story so you get the idea: 1.	One day in chemistry Briony was trying to correctly wire up a plug. It then fell apart for the tenth time. She gave up and was staring out the window when... 2.	suddenly, an unconscious pupil fell through the roof, who was then followed by a dwarf dressed as a nun (oh no, it was actually Mrs Goodchild) 3.	The unconscious person remained still. Briony realizing it was Emily Cried out a prolonged Noooooo!!! When Emily got up and said why are you doing that? Briony fell into a shocked Huh wad-ju-yer-du-in-mmeh and was silenced by the nun... 4.	then, Briony thought of something. She hadn't done her massive 500-page essay, so (in her physics lesson, remember) she decided to get on with it. What was the title? Oh yes, "How to say hello in 500m words" Hmmmm.....she thought. Well, hello, guten tag, bonjour, hola,......um.............hmmm......... 5.	Briony spent the rest of the lesson pondering this strange task of hers. Emily personally thought that the essay was just created by the teachers as revenge. Briony was bought back to reality by a flying blue car outside the window, which had come to save both her and Emily. 6.	who was it? she wondered? Uhhh! It was Harry Potter in his flying car (remember the chamber of secrets?)! Wow! MY hero! Sighed Emily. How I do love you so! Oh get on with it said Briony. She was missing Adam. Sigh........... 7.	Harry turned to Briony and said 'I know that Emily is drop dead gorgeous but I'm afraid I can not date her due to a curse created by Voldemort. You how ever can both come with me and I will take you to Hogwarts where Adam is a pupil. Briony looking both sceptical and worried climbed into  the car, Emily took the front passenger seat, Briony the Back. The car then took off into the skies ... 8.	All of a sudden a strange knocking was heard apparently coming from nowhere. Briony still worried turned to Harry and asked what on earth it was. Don't worry said the alien as it turned around it's just my pet human Becky! 9.	Suddenly, Harry grew two ex-TREMELY large tentacles and started to eat Briony! Luckily, Adam was around to save her, and killed Harry. Meanwhile, Emily was fast asleep and dreaming of sticking pins in Dave’s privates. She woke up to find herself with Becky, Briony and Adam, in the sky, resting on what looked like a cloud. Have I died and gone to heaven? Wondered Emily. Meanwhile (again) Briony, Adam and Becky were all wondering what to tell Emily. Could they tell her that Harry Potter, her long loved lover, had turned into an alien and they had to kill him? Worse still, there was the matter getting down from the cloud; they thought they had killed Harry, but he was well enough to drive off after leaving them on a cloud in the sky. Hmm.....this was going to be a long night.......... 10.	Adam walked around pondering what to do and then fell through the clouds in a puff of smoke with the words 'oops I hit a soft spot'. Emily caught his wand in a flash and cast the wingardium leviosa spell saving Adam. She thought to herself well that shows my brother that the Harry Potter books ARE educational. Adam stuttered thanks, Emily put up hand and cast a spell to take them all to Hogwarts- unfortunately she sneezed part way through and they actually ended up at the worst possible place. You guessed it there were at .... 11.	Voldemorts secret palace in the middle of mount Doom where he was secretly conspiring with Sauron to take over the world. Briony on seeing such evil collapsed elegantly into the arms of yes you’ve guessed it ADAM. Who on seeing her almost dying (well he thought so) declared his undying love for her, but fate was not looking fondly on the two young lovers as Sauron swooped down in a rather vampirish way to steal his love from Adams arms. With a cry of anguish Adam....... 12.	...........punched Sauron in the fangs and grabbed Briony. He pulled her (nicely) away from the evilness of Sauron and made sure everyone was alright (aww, isn't he nice!!!!) Anyway, back to the story....Adam quickly chanted a spell that took them all to a very magical romantic place. Everywhere they looked, there were very wonderful things that were so wonderful they couldn't be described. Adam decided to seize his opportunity and whisked Briony away from everyone so that they could be alone. Finally! But, just as they were about to go into the best snog ever in the world,.................................. HAVE FUN!!!

Emz set off towards the house alone, she would save the tour guide and save Rob by finding him that modesty which he was now lacking cause by taking off that dress he only had a pair of barbie shorts on with a t-shirt saying love me on it, would she be able to find what she needed in time though?

Everyone was relieved that they had not been killed, but were rather worried that they should now have to navigate the island alone, with all the terrors it no doubt held. Bri suggested that they all head for the erupting volcano in the centre of the island. No one seemed to want to point out the obvious flaw in this plan, so off they set. But they had been walking only a few minutes when suddenly...

They started to fight over it as the humans ran for their lifes. It was truely a great battle til one pygmie triumphed and was blown to bits shortly after. The group looked around, Briony said 'Is everyone ok? Is everyone here?' But one was missing from their group...

Emily was all a-glow and walked close to the man. They had just reached a hut when out from the shadows...

Unfortuneatly, Emz was already halfway to the ground, having ignored the warning and jumped. She was just about to hit the ground...

The others thanked the tree and informed of their quest to first get Rob some modesty or someone would kill him before midnight. The tree said he was sure that it would be a sad loss for someone if Rob was to perish but that he probably would have brought it on himself. No-one disagreed with this. Suddenly there was a bump and the tree anounced that they had arrived on Spooky Island. All looked around in amazement and were about to get off the boat when...

Or rather, he almost fell overboard, when suddenly strong hands grabbed him, and he was pulled back by none other than...

The others looked baffled and then returned to help Rob whose speach about tree's being used on boats had prompted the tree who was the captain of the boat to attack Rob with all his might. Bad for Rob that he had offended a whomping willow who was now trying to make Rob a wheeping willow. All seemed lost as Rob's dress was torn and his make up smudged, he had even resulted to cat fighting as the others took a break to watch and have a laugh and a coke (well it was 11.30am). Once this sacred time of coke drinking was over they considered how to stop the fight so they could get on with their mission. Suddenly the little dog that had been given to Rob....

Then, with a bowel-trembling thump, another ship fired its canon at the crew of the good ship Castlemaine. Fortuneately, everyone was in fact on the good ship Fourecks, which was some distance away, and, by incredible coincidnce, in another universe. But the faeries were worried for a moment. "Was it just coincidence? Was it planned? who knows?" And so saying,...

      ....the really spooky house on spooky island, she muttered something bout some clutz of a dog who somehow helped to solve mysteries and a bunch of kids who were so tacky that even the 60's rejected them. Vicky realised that if she was telling them not to go, of course that meant they would go, but she probably knew that they would do the opposite of what she said cos she was evil, meaning that she did want them to go cos perhaps there was a trap there like in Hanzel and Gretal, but if they knew this then they wouldnt go, but if she knew that they thought this, perhaps she was just trying to make sure that they didnt go cos she was hiding something there that she didnt want them to see. Vicky tried to explain this to the others and then proposed that they should go to the spooky house on spooky island. The others were to bemused to argue. The evil fairy tried once more to stop them saying, 'but i told you not to go!' Vicky started her explaination again but the fairy stoped her and said 'I'm going to classes now to be good, this was my good deed for the day!' Everyone looked at Vicky who said 'well so what, you dont get to meet a mystery solving dog everyday!' The others nodded and left the fairy woth her mouth hanging open behind them as they walked towards the port that had the boat to take them to spooky island. When they got there they looked at the boat, it was empty except for the captain who was a ....
