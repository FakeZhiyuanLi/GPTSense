      My friend, Lisa, asked me: but what is this all about? Why would anyone read it? Well, Lisa, I have to do a little more research on blogs, but that was the initial question from  blogskeptics  when the phemomenon first hit. And no one really knows the answer. No one knows why people like to read other people's thoughts. Unless they are somewhere that the reader wants to be... (like in the media section of the DNC?)  I personally like to just see what other people do with colors and pictures. They are pretty. *shrug*  Some have suggested I write about my past job experience at Fox News Channel right here in good ol' Midtown New York. There's time for that later. Right now I just want to finish the running, the screaming and the nightmares. And I want to be fair to those still stuck in the vortex. Stay tuned for that kind of  CableNewser -style gossip and such...  Meantime, my mind is occupied with the Literary Pursuit (tm). Some people use their blogs or Live Journals to post their work, and that could happen here, with any luck. A short story actually nears completion, but with my heavy duty completion issues, the finish line could be here or it could be there and it may not matter. (I'm working on those issues, by the way, because as you know, I)  Right now I'm reading something that's quite a departure for me. It's not science fiction, but it's called, by the author himself,  weird fiction . I went to a reading when he was in town. He's British author, China Mieville and he's just published the final book in an "anti-trilogy" (the books are set in the same world, but have very loose ties, if any, to each other). Check out this scene:   A slick of vagabonds, petty thieves and their bosses, discharged foreign soldiers, discharged jailbirds, dissolute rich and tinkers, beggars, pimps and their charges, chancers, kinfe-grinders, poets and police agents. Humans, here and there cactus-heads poking over the crowd (allowed in only if their thorns were plucked), the scarab-heads of khepri. Cigarillos hung from mouths, and people banged their glasses or cutlery in time while waiters went between them on the sawdusted floor. At the room's edges small groups coagulated, and one like Ori -- well-used to Fallybeggar's -- could see where they overlapped and where they separated, and make out their composition.  FROM "IRON COUNCIL"  Sounds a bit like our world, with a few plants thrown in... and that is what draws you in. Then you find the characters encountering a city built on the back of an enormous tortoise, a man with a mantis-claw instead of a hand, and a tree that eats whatever crosses its path, then turns the digested stuff into "prey-fruit," some of which takes the form of human heads and is then eaten by other races. (This was the last scene I read before turning in for the night.) Yuk. You have to read it to believe it. Definitely not for the cringe-worthy.

      If you're here, you're probably a good friend, doing me a favor by seeing just what I have to say, and how I'm going to say it. So, thank you. I once took my friends for granted, but that's not the case anymore. We take a lot for granted when we're young and impetuous, and my friends always called ME. They flooded me with requests for my company. What a luxury; I had no idea!  You hit a certain age and then it's all work. Friendship, marriage, co-workers, any kind of relationship involves work. But with work comes reward. With risk comes knowledge.  "Loser Takes All" is a novel by Graham Greene, my favorite author. A man on a Monte Carlo wedding and honeymoon becomes obsessed with winning at the roulette table, to the exclusion of his new wife-to-be. Bertram's always been a bit poor, always landed the short end of the stick, and he's wowed by his own brilliance in devising a winning scheme after many days of losing. But the moral is, of course, that it's not all about winning. I like that idea... that just because one isn't winning at the game of life, one could still "take all." How does one define what ALL is? For the protaganist in Greene's novel, losing his love to another man is just enough to shake his obsession and he cleverly usurps his rival and rids himself of the burden of greed at the same time. He risks again and wins.  "'But it's loser takes all,' I said. 'Lose these for me. It's all I've got left.'" -Bertram to Philippe,  Loser Takes All.
