      yay! i'm back! i guess its nice 2 get back 2 my borin schedule of layin around the house, kung-fu, and talkin on the phone, but chicago was still awesome. fun, fun, fun! well, i'm at ma dad's house now, and we're in a constant fight about the whole Quebec thing. ok, so they plan a trip for me 2 go to Quebec and live with Nancy's brother for a week, and i'm like, "ok, whatever, it's only for a week." so then they come up 2 me a little while later to say that Nancy's brother's daughter, Miriam, is comin down for a week, and while she's down we're going 2 disney world for three days. then i'm going back up with her for a week, and then my dad and nancy are coming up with me for a week. and they decided all of it by themselves. so i got pissed and pleaded with them 2 let me stay w/ my mom while they go up to disney. then my dad decides he wants 2 change his mind and gives me this crap about how "miriam took two whole weeks off for u." grrr....she took two whole weeks off for herself, can't i just stay here and have a life for a week???? so, ya, i'm pretty pissed about that...i soooo can't wait to go 2 college and leave this place. newayz, the kung-fu tournament is this weekend, and i get to stay with my mom (whut joy!) her friend, lauran, and john, this guy she went out w/...but wants 2 break up w/ now...so that means i'll b stayin w/ 3 borin adults and away 4rm daniel, carmelo, aj, and ryan....so this will b interesting...o ya, and bobby wants me 2 teach him how 2 surf...hmm, that should be really interesting...owell, it's like 12:30 and i haven't eaten breakfast, so i better go....even though i'm tryin 2 stay in my room and be anti-social from my family all day in order 4 my dad 2 get my point....well, peace out!   RANDOMNESS OF THE DAY  why would someone write "suspended bladder" on a volleyball? it's like, "hey, you guys, let's toss around my suspended bladder."   ...wtf?

      hola again every1...i'm home alone (chills) b/c my mom's working and my dad is too lazy 2 come and get me...its been pretty borin, but relaxing. i watched the matrix revolutions this morning b/c my mom decided she just had 2 get it, and plus i saw the other two, so y not? it was actually really good...a little too sci-fi 4 me, though. wow, u all shud be very proud of me... i went on the papa john's website and ordered pizza ONLINE. yay! so i'm very hungry and that pizza man better get here soon. hmm, last night's kick-boxing class wuz killer. i haven't sweat that much in a long time...but my certain special sum1 wuzn't there. hopefully they'll b there 2nite b/c tonight's kung-fu. hmm...started reading the first couple pages of "Good Earth", but got bored. it's about some man who's about 2 get married so he's all excited that he doesn't have 2 do work around the house anymore because the woman will be doing it...which i think is very sexist if u ask me...damn men think they can sit around all day getting fat while their wives do all the work...not when i get married he won't. and he's like, "oh, i haven't taken a bath in ten years, so i think it's a good idea if I bathe for my wedding." gross...well newayz, today will b a day of eating and movies 4 me...be back l8tr...peace out ~o3> (mouse)
