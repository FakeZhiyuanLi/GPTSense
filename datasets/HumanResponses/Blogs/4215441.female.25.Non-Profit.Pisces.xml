      Well, 2 major issues going on today. First is work. I hate my job. I really do. I mean, I have moments in which I feel things are going well. But for the most part, lately, I hate my job. I don’t particularly like Lisa. Robie, I used to love and now pretty much can’t stand. I love Kasey and Patrick and Maggie. But Maggie is going to be gone soon. Wouldn’t be surprised if Patrick was, and I can’t stick around just for Kasey. I love the location of where I work. I love being downtown, 5 minutes from the Common. Right at Downtown Crossing. I love the fact that everyone around here knows me and says hi and talks to me and likes me. I like the fact that our office is fun. And that if someone has a story or a guy or something, the entire office comes out and talks. I like the fact that at times it feels more like I am working with a bunch of my friends instead of in an office. But that is changing, it hasn’t been that way in a little while.  As for my job, I used to do cool stuff. I was involved in everything. I was helping, I was a part, I was a true member of the team. Now, I am a data entry clerk. Lisa has nothing for me to do. Anything Robie has, it is stuffing envelopes or something. She does have me design a lot of stuff, but it is different. She doesn’t care what it looks like, and if I spend time making it look good, I feel like I was wasting my time in her eyes. You can’t have crap and expect people to want to come. It won’t work.  I am tired of being a data entry and file clerk. I am tired of being a receptionist. I don’t mind being an admin at all, as long as I get respect and am involved in projects that make me feel worthy of myself. I haven’t felt worthy of myself I think since Laura left. (Well, during Black and Blue, yes. And when I redid the MT packets, yes). It used to be fun to come in to work, and it isn’t anymore. I am tired of feeling like a second-class citizen. I used to never feel like that (with Laura) and I can’t feel anything but that lately. And it’s not even Karen. It’s Robie and Lise E. I have never, ever felt so much like a secretary as I have lately.  It’s time for me to move on. For the simple fact of my mental well-being, I can’t stay here any longer. I know that I like it, but that doesn’t mean I won’t like somewhere else. It doesn’t mean the locations not great, cause – come on, this is Boston. There are great locations all over the place. It doesn’t mean I can’t help out at the events. Cause I can volunteer. (I won’t get the satisfaction of being part of the planning committee, but that’s ok).  If I don’t move on, I might never. And I have too. I don’t even care so much if I am always an admin. That doesn’t bother me as much as I let on. I don’t want a high-powered career. I don’t want the responsibility and work that comes along with it. I know that sounds lazy, but it’s not. I want time for myself. I want to be able to volunteer or go to the movies or go to concerts or frankly just to go home and chill. I don’t want to deal with it. I know that’s not ambitious, and I feel like I should be ambitious. But I am ambitious in other ways. I am just really tired of this part of my life.  And now on to the other thing, Paul. We went out on our third date Saturday night. It was kind of awkward at first. It is usually so easy to talk to him and all. And it wasn’t, not for like the first 1-2 hours. I don’t know if it was me or him or both of us or what. I had a great time with him. And I really like him. But I just don’t know how to be with him. At the end of the night we kiss and hold hands. But he never reaches for me at all before then. I don’t know if I need to make the first move or if he is just not into PDA or what. But me, the over-analyzer, freaked out, insecure, neurotic person that I am…I perceive everything to be that he doesn’t like me anymore. I suppose that this is a typical thing for women to feel, but I feel really stupid for feeling this way.  We had a great time, and I think he had a great time, and I really think he likes me. He puts forth effort into seeing me (when we actually see each other.) It’s nice to have someone actually plan something, get directions, put forth time and effort and thought into spending time with you…and then to actually pay and take you out. It’s really nice. But the problem is that there are like 3 weeks between each of our dates. I know he has been super busy and I understand that. But now that he’s not in class, now what? Is it going to continue this way or will we see each other more? I suppose I could do something like ask him if he wants to do something. Maybe I should take the initiative. I continue to feel, after every date, that "he doesn’t like me anymore. He doesn’t want to see me anymore. I’m never going to hear from him." Him then asking me out again helps alleviate these fears.  This is all me, I realize. I am a completely freaked out person. I think maybe if I asked him out, and he said yes, it would help me feel better. He’s going to want to go out again. I know this. He has mentioned future plans. And if he can’t get together when I call him, then maybe he will ask me out to something after that. I was thinking that I would ask him if he wanted to get together for the Copley Square concert on Thursday. It’s free and casual.  I need to remember not to analyze this to much. I need to remember that if something is going to happen, it will happen and that if nothing is going to happen, nothing is going to happen. I need to remember that if it’s easy, it ain’t worth it. I need to realize that life will continue long after this stuff. I need to remember that I am a freaked out insecure person who over-analyzes and to just chill. I need to remember that guys aren’t all that deep (sorry guys) and that everything is fine.  And I do remember. I am actually feeling pretty good about things (despite what it sounds). I have come to the realization that if it’s going to happen, it will happen. I am actually pretty comfortable with that. Much more comfortable than I was. I just have to continue to remember that.  Sigh…..life is so weird.

      Well, he called!  Last night.  We talked for a while.  It was so good to talk to him.  And tomorrow we are going out.  He said we should get together late afternoon and take another drive.  I am hoping that that means he wants to spend more time than usual with me.  He is a good guy.   OK....here is a goal for myself.  I am not going to analyze, evaluate and scrutinize every single thing on our date.  He is a guy, and from what I understand, guys don't get all that deep.  (I am not sure whether I believe that or not).  But I am just going to go, have a good time, enjoy myself and enjoy him.  Obviously he likes me, otherwise he would not keep calling and would not keep asking me out.   Another goal is that I am going to not be too distant or unavailable.  Not that I am.  I like to think it is the complete opposite.  But I know that it takes me a little while to feel comfortable enough to show as much affection as I would like to show.  So, I am going to show affection.  I am going to kiss him first.   Life is good!  I am completely broke, but I am feeling just completely on top of the world.  Yah!

      This is new for me...but I have always enjoyed typing my thoughts (my typing speed more matches my speed of my thoughts) so thought it might be fun and worthwhile to publish it online.  But, I am going to pretend that it is just me out there...at least for now.  It will keep things more personally relevant.   I have decided (once again, I always forget and always come back to the realization) that life does go on.  Despite guys that might not call and rent checks that bounce.  Life goes on, it continues, the circle is never-ending.  That is kind of comforting.  It makes the little things seem so much more little and easier to handle.  I think that I need that right now.  I need to realize....and be sure to remember that I can deal with this crap and it is not a big deal and I am going to be okay.  So, you may ask, are the little things?  Well, let's start with my finances.  Despite everything that I do, I can never manage to have enough money much less be able to save anything.  So...my rent check just bounce, again.  Third time.  This time, I am just going to stick a money order in the mail and not have to talk to my landlord.  I don't want to deal with him.  Though I must say that it is never a big deal.  He never really does anything, just charges me $10 and that's that.  But I am a wuss when it comes to this and I would rather not talk to him.  What else is going on?  Paul.  That is what is taking up most of my free thoughts.  He seemed to really like me.  He is the first guy in a long time that...did anything really.  He made the first move, called the first time, asked me out, asked me out again...  The games didn't seem to be there.  He just wanted to talk to me (it seemed).  And I really liked him...and he seemed to really like me.  So now he has stopped calling.  Haven't heard from him in about 3 weeks.  I know how busy he is...and I am giving him that excuse.  But I am so tired of making excuses.  I just want someone to want to be with me.  I thought he did, but now am not so sure.  I am just so fed up with guys.  But I guess I am not willing to give up on them.  So last night, I called him.  His last call.  It was "breezy," and afterwards I deleted his number in every possible form from my cell phone.  So it really was a last call.  Now I am waiting for him to call me back.  I don't know.  I have resigned myself to the fact that I will never hear from him again.  If I don't, I'll probably cry a little (I admit it) but life does go on...and I have to remember that.  But maybe he will call....  Jesus, is this the forever question we women have?  "Is he going to call?"  I just want to be over it.  And I want to find somebody that actually does.  I am sick of making myself sick over guys.   Course, I am sick of making myself sick over anything, over everything.  I just want to be the calm, collected, confident person I am told that I seem to be.  Yeah, right.
