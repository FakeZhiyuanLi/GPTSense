      . . . Ashleigh just IM'd me hoping that my "Kyle/Best Friend" entry was about Kyle Earnst, and not her brother!  It's ok, it wasn't about her brother so no worries!  And then she was like, are we ok?  And I was like I hope so!  And then yay, it's happy!  We said "Sorry" and now everything should be happy!  Woo Hoo!

      Bob tells me I don't know what love is!   My reply:  Well, maybe I don't know what love is, but I do know what its like to like someone so much you hate them because you know that nothing is going to happen!  Its the worst feeling!  And thats how I feel every time I see him!  So maybe it would just be better if I didn't see him anymore, then I wouldn't have to feel like that anymore! I like Bob a lot, and maybe I don't show it all the time because he pisses me off!  I want lots of attention from him, and when I don't get it I get jealous!  But that doesn't matter anymore because I'm going to get over him!  If I did know what love was, and if I did know what it was like to have a "real" best friend then I would have to say that Kyle is one of my best friends and I love him!   Because even if people hate me and call me names, he stays my friend!  People ask him to not talk to me, and he still does!  He is a true friend and I love him because when I'm around him I feel happy and it's like yay, I'm with Kyle!  Rachel called me and I didn't want to talk so I didn't answer!  I texted her and asked her what she wants!  She told me that her and Shandi miss me and they want to be my friend again!  I told her that I miss them too, but the harassing hurt and that it made me sad that they didn't trust me, because I never doubted anything they ever said to me!  AND, I thought Shandi never liked me!  Then they told me that Shandi really never hated me and that they were sorry, but they've gone through the harassment too, and that they want to be my friend again!  So I told them that I want to be there friend again too, because I love them and they always made me so happy!  We had so many fun times together!  And maybe, they can all come back and maybe be even better, because I'm trying really hard to be a better person!

      Today was a happy day!  I woke up next to wonderful Amanda, and it was exciting because I love her mucho!  She is my lover!  Oh, Amanda!  (( hehe ))  Ummm ... We didnt really do much in the morning!  We ate breakfast and then we started to watch A Clockwork Orange, (( never finished it ))!  Then my mom daddy told me that Amanda could come to the BBQ with me so it made me happy because none of my cousins like me because they are all weirdos!  Really they are!  Ok, Jeremiah and Kaleb have both been in love with me!  And it's sick because yeah, they are my cousins ... Maybe not real cousins, but step-cousins is close enough! At the BBQ we umm ... ate and tried to tan, but it didn't work because there wasn't enough sun!  Amanda said that you tan more in the clouds, I don't understand how that would work, but I believe her!  I played with Olivia (( my 2 year old cousin )) and it was fun!  She spilt ice cream all over her little baby foot and to be a dork I licked it all off and she laughed at it made me so happy because I love when little kids laugh!  It is so cute!  Then me and Amanda sat around and ... did nothing!  She flossed my toes because she is a dork, so I did hers too!  ... Don't ask!  Then I called Lori and she told me to come over!  Yay!  I love Lori! My grandpa drove me, Mark, and Amanda back to my house and made sure that my car started (( I wasn't able to drive last night because it said service engine, but my grandpa said it was ok to drive because he is bringing it in to get it fixed again tomorrow )) and then we all drove over there!  While I was driving there I saw Steve leaving and I was like Oh, that's sad because I love Steve and I want him to stay!  When I got there her dad ordered pizza, and it was sad because I had already eaten so much food!  But, I ate more because I'm love with food ... it makes me happy!  Then Lani came and she brough Lord of the Rings and we watched it!  I don't really like those movies, but thats ok!  I watched it anyways!  Then yeah ... I don't know!  I told Bob that I loved him and instead of saying I love you back he kept saying "Olive Juice!"  That is so 3rd Grade, words of Amanda!    Now I'm at home and I have nothing to do!  I showered, because I haven't showered since Saturday afternoon!  EEWW!  Actually, I don't care because I don't have anyone to impress!  Mmmm, I need to find someone to impress!  Becaus I'm not good enough the way I am now, and I want to be loved by someone, and I want a boyfriend!  Ohh, how sad!   Ok, so I am officially stopping with all the bullshit!  I want to make peace with everyone!  And I figure that the only way I can do that is if I start fresh with myself!  I need a personality makeover!  I'm really stopping with the drugs, I don't want them anymore!  Even if they are around me I am going to say no!  And smoking, I'm not gonna do that anymore!  I never really was a smoker, I just did it on occasion ... but now I'm stopping for good!  And I'm not going to drink because I really don't like the way it tastes!  It makes me tummy feel sick!  Umm ... I'm not going to lie anymore because lying only leads to problems!  It makes you lose friends and that is never a good thing, because I love all of my friends, OLD and NEW ... even the ones that don't consider me a friend anymore.  I'm not going to cheat anymore, on anything!  At games, on people, on homework ... it is stupid because I don't want to be cheated and I shouldn't do to others what I don't want to be done to me!  Yeah, that makes sense, right?  Hmmm ... I know there is something else!  ... Oh yeah, no more liking my friends family memebers!  That means Ashleigh, I'm not going to like Kyle anymore!  Lori, I'm not going to like Steve anymore!  Amanda, I'm not going to have a crush on your cousin, if I ever do meet him!  Hmmm, I know there is some other ones, I just can't think of it right now!  I'm not just saying this all for the heck of it!  I really do want to change because I want to be a better person!  I've been feeling really ... depressed lately!  And I couldn't think of why this could be!  I mean I have my best friends, Lori and Amanda!  And I have my family, that I'm finally starting to get along with!  And ... I don't know ... I should be happy!  And I'm not!  I miss people ... and I really shouldn't miss them because they have been really shitty to me in the past week or so!  But I guess I haven't been the best to them either!  Oh, but I want to change!  Nobody believes me, but I'm serious!  I don't think I've ever been so serious about something in my life!  Ahh, ok ... I'm done!

      Yesterday Lori's p's dropped her off at my house on there way to the movies!  We just ... hung out because it was raining SUPER hard outside and it was so scary!  Then when the storm stopped Amanda came over and we made pizza rolls and ate them!  EVERY time Lori comes over there is pizza rolls invovled because I am in love with them and they are all that I eat!  Then we walked to Karina's house because my mom wouldn't drive us to Lori's house to hang out!  Ummm, Karina wouldn't answer her door so we walked around the house to her bedroom window and and started throwing small rocks at it!  (( Just like when the guys come over and throw woodchips at my window ))  She finally answered and let us into her house!  She was decorating her walls with pictures of all of her friends!  She has two pictures of me and one of them is so horrible because its when I had braces and my hair was blonde and I look yucky!  The other is of me and Lori and Lori looks so beautiful and I look yucky because I'm an ugly person!  Then we came back to my house and we just layed on my bed and talked for a bit and then my mom brought Lori home and it made me sad because I really wanted Lori to sleepover with me and Amanda!  But that's ok!   Then me and Amanda watched House of 1000 Corpses and it is so freaky!  Actually, I thought it was going to be a lot scarier!  It was really funny at times!  I wanted to laugh, but I didn't because Amanda was sleeping and I didn't want to wake her up! Then I went to bed, the end!

      Ummm ... Let's see the first part of my night was spent being lectured and yelled at and hit by my mom!  She thought I was lying about something, and I really wasn't!  So she hit me and I ran into the laundry room and cried and scratched for a really long time and now I have to aweful scratches on my arms and it looks like I'm suicidal or I'm looking for attention, and that isn't it at all!  It just felt good at the time!  Then Ana told them that I wasn't lying and they let me go to Lori's house!  When I got there Frank, Lani, Bob, Karina, and Lori were all sitting on the couch in the dark, watching Texas Chainsaw Masacre!  I only saw the end of it, but what I saw I thought was really funny!  I don't know why everyone was so scared of it!  Then we played in the basement for a long time and Bob left for a bit because he made Lani cry and she told him to go!  Then he came back!  Me, Karina, and Lori made paper clip necklaces and they are OMG, so cool!  Just watch, everyone WILL copy off of us and come to school wearing them on Wednesday!  Then we went to Diary Queen and I got yummy peanut buster parfait and it reminded me of Ryan because after the show on Wednesday we all went to Dairy Queen and thats what I got and yeah!  Then we parked by the river for a bit, and it got boring so Karina took us back to Lori's house!   Me and Bob had a bit of fun!  But I don't know, I don't think I like him anymore!  I thought I really did, but I didn't feel the WAM BAM JAM that I used to feel!  Oh well, that's ok!   Then Bob left and Steve came home!  YAY!  Ummm ... Steve hung out in the basement with me and Lori and watched Elephant!  It was a weird movie about a school shooting, I liked it a lot!  Then we slept and Steve slept with us for awhile, and it was fun mucho!  Ummm ... Hank came over in the morning and it was happy because Hank is awesome and hott, and OW OW!  Then my mom picked me up around 12 30 and we went to Target and she bought me a lot of fun things!  Yay!    Hanging out with Amanda and Cousins AND/OR Lori and Frank tonight!

      you know whats the worst feeling in the world ... knowing that your best friend cant be friends with you again because her friends wont approve of it.  it almost makes it seem like there is no point to making other friends because all your going to do is fear that the same thing is going to happen again.

      Please, do take my pictures down because they were meant for a friend!  You're not a friend, and you never wil be again!  I don't mean to sound like a bitch, but it is the truth!  I took yours down too!    Ashleigh talked to me today to tell me that she had nothing to do with what happend last night!  Well, I never thought it was her!  I figured that Ashleigh was more mature than that and she probably had better things to do, than to harass me!  And I was right!  So I told her that and then she told me that I'll never understand and that I'm always going to be stuck up!  So then I IM'd Amanda and told her that I miss my ultimate best friend, and I want her back and I'm ready to change (no more drugs, lying, her brother, cheating ...)  I'm done with it all because it is stupid and I have better things to do with my life!  Well, Amanda showed that all to Ashleigh!  I was kind of upset because I didn't want Ashleigh to think that I'm deperate for her friendship . . . I just love her a lot!  So I IM'd Ashleigh and I told her that I'm not going to do anything anymore and that I'm sorry Amanda told her the stuff!  Well she told Amanda that she loved me and I had Mark tell her that I was trying to be more mature about this fight and that I wasn't going to right mean stuff about her in my journal!  And I haven't!  I'm not going to do that because I don't want to start anymore problems because I love her!  No matter what I am always going to love her!  Sleepover at Lori's house tonight!  It is going to be so much fun!  Yay!

      Why are people so immature?  In my last entry I did NOT talk shit about her at all!  I just said that she said she was going to stop, but she didn't because after she said she would stop I read her journal and I saw more stuff about me!  So then she has her stupid posse call me and IM me!  Wow, they are so cool!  Really, they need to get a life!  I know they have much better things to do!  It's funny how they think if they insult me it's going to hurt me or make me cry because that isn't true at all!  I could really care less!  I think it's funny that they decide to waste their precious time on me!  Then she replies to a comment I made in her journal, a comment that was not mean or bitchy at all!  Wow, you are so badass!  All of you!  And then they make a point to tell me that Vanessa hates me and that God hates me!  Ok, I could care less if Vanessa hates me because I'm not all that fond of her either!  And about God, ... God is fake!  Not real!  So thanks for telling me that this made up person hates me!  It really, hurts? Ummm ... I love how the comment was signed by Britney, Rachel, Vanessa, Joe, and Kyle!  Joe really has no room to talk shit about me because he's done some stupid shit in his time!  Let's tell Stefanie we like her because we think it will make Ashleigh jealous and make her want to come back to me!  Haha!  And Kyle, well I'm glad to know how he really feels about me!  I mean considering a couple of days ago he told me that he would still be my friend even if Ashleigh does hate me!  Well, I guess that all changed because Rachel hates me and Joe hates me and such!  He has to be "cool" like everyone else!   I watched A Clockwork Orange today and it was such an awesome movie!  Actually, it was really confusing because I wasn't really paying attention until the end because that's when I got sick of doing anything else!  There was blood and it made me sick!  And I saw a penis!  It was scary!  I don't like it, (( Lori Knows! ))!  But next weekend me and Ryan are going to watch it together and yeah, then he can help me understand it!  I think I missed the whole plot of the movie, and that could be a deffinate problemo!    Bye Bye!  The End!

      Yesterday Gabe, Lori, and Charles came home with me after 3rd block!  Then Amanda and Sally came ovr like 15 minutes after we got home!  It was tons of fun!  Lori and Charles pleasured each other in my bed!  It makes me sad because my bed was a virgin to sexual activity ... and now it isn't!  Ohhh ... so I was rubbing Charles' leg and I thought I was feeling his knee, but it wasn't and then he screamed pervert and it was so funny because I had no idea I was rubbing anything else!  hehe  Then Karina and Mark came over and I took everyone home, except for Lori, Karina, and Mark!  We all went to Lori's house and hung out there!  Lori got in trouble for ditching!  It was sad!  And then all the guys were making fun of her because of Charles and I felt sad for her and she cried to me!  (( tear ))  Then my mom called and yelled at me because I'm failing design because I haven't turned in my sketchbooks!  So I brought Lori home with me!  She drew feet for me and it made me happy!  Then we made dinner for my family because I needed a way to suck up!  It was yummie and I was proud of us!  Lori doesn't put dressing on her salad and I thought it was funny because yeah, the dressing makes it so much better!  Then Chris Naumen came over at it was really weird because he's fat now and has a mohawk and a lip peircing and yeah, it was just weird because he used to be so preppy!  Then I took Lori home!  When I got home I got yelled at by my dad because he likes to be stupid and that was the end of it!  I "talked" to Rachel last night, and it was interesting!  She said that I caused her pain that's going to last her a lifetime and that sometimes she questions the decision she made about me, but she knows that it will turn out ok in the end!  And that we should just forget that we ever existed!  I don't know, it was something like that!  I didn't really remember because I don't tend to pay attention to people that aren't my friends!  Now, if we were friends then I would have memorized every word of it, but we're not so oh well!  So I told her that I could never forget all about her because she was my good friend, and no matter how hard I try I couldn't forget about her because that would be stupid! Oh, Rachel also said that we should stop talking shit about each other in our journals!  And then after she does that I read her journal and it has some more stuff about me!  I think that is ... stupid!  If you don't want me to write about you then please, don't write about me!  Ummm ... I'm going to hang out with Nathan later on today and it makes me happy!  I have nothing else to say about today, yet!

      When I got home from school today my parents decided to be a real bitch to me and yell at me and make me really sad and make me go outside and do yard work!  It seems like we are always doing yard work at my house, maybe it's because we have so much yard, maybe?  I don't know!  But when I was done with the yard work my dad rewarded me by taking my car for an oil change and he got my left turn signal fixed!  Aww, what a nice guy!  He makes me happy, even though he can be a real jackass at times! Then Lori came over and we sat in my room and did nothing!  I've been depressed for the last week or two so it was kind of sad!  I tried to be happy, because I wanted to be happy because Lori is an awesome person and she makes me happy, but it just didn't work!  Then we went to Dom. to get Wing sauce for my dad because he NEEDED it and Mark was almost caught stealing a box of coriciden!  I was disappointed in him because he told me that he didn't steal it, and then later on I found out that he did!  I decided that I think I don't want to do drugs anymore, because they are bad!  We went to the show at Clearwater!  I didn't really like any of the bands that played!  Self Control was ok, and the guy in the brown shirt was really cute!  But I didn't like Signal Six at all and ATR, well I love them because I love the people in it!  The only thing that made me happy was Coopers lil show at the beginning!  They played Taking Back Sunday and it just made me so happy!  Happier than I've been in a long time!  I was jumping around, and singing and it was great!  The show is exactly what I needed to boost my spirits!  All my favorite people were there ... Christian, Amanda, Lori, Hank, Bob, Evan, Ryan, Charles, and Ben!  (( Lori and Charles are going out! ))   Umm ... Jesi was talking to Amanda, and then she turned to me and said she was sorry and I said I was sorry and it made me happy because I was sick of fighting!  I really don't want people to not like me, because its not nice!  I'm not saying I want to be best friends with Jesi again, even though it would be fun, but it would be nice to talk to her because Jesi is cool and yeah, that is all I have to say! After the show we walked to Dairy Queen and I got yummie chocolate and peanut butter stuff!  And I bought Ryan and Mark ice cream, yes I know, I'm so nice!  lol  Then Nathan showed up and we talked and I told him that now that I have my car fixed I want him to hang out with me again!  And I told him that I was going to pick him up so he could come over and stuff!  I really wish people would stop writing about me in there journals!  Because I stopped righting about them (except for now, but thats because Im trying to make point!  And in my last entry I was making a reply to one of there comments asking them to stop!)  I mean to talk crap about me in your journal only shows how immature you are!  Please do us all a favor and grow up!

      I don't care about us not being friends anymore because there is no need for me to waste my time on people like you!  Just like there is no need for you to waste your time on me!  OK?  What good would me caring do?  None!  Because like you said in your journal ... it is over between us, for good!  And you know what, I'm not going to let it faze me because I have other friends!  A couple of months ago I would have been depressed and begging you to be my friend again!  But now I've realized that I shouldn't have to beg my friends to be my friends!  If they are true friends they will stick by me no matter what, and I guess that obviously shows that we were never true friends because I have no intention to stick by you, and I know you feel the same!  And about you believing Ashleigh over me, I don't care!  Because I would believe Ashleigh over you!  I've known her longer, meaning I trust her more!  So if your saying that to make a point, or hurt my feelings don't waste your time! My journal is meant to be read by my friends, not people like you!  So unless you intend on my being my friend, which you don't ... don't comment in here!  Don't even waste your time reading it!  Let's just pretend we ever met, it would be a lot better that way!  So yes, just pretend me, my life, my journal don't exist!  I'm doing it, so should you!

      Christian and Amanda came over for a bit, and left when it was time for me to eat dinner!  Then Lani came over and we picked up Karina and went to her house to get money and then to Taco Bell!  Fun times!   Frank and Bob came over while I was gone and I'm sad because I need to see Bob to survive!  It's not healthy to not see him for this long!  Ahhh!  I talked to Alex today ... and he told me that the Bob/prom thing is irrelivant!  That he liked me a lot when he asked me out, but things just weren't working out!  And I agreed, because I know they they weren't working out!  I mean I wish they did, but there is nothing I can do about it now!  I told him that I was sorry for wasting his time, and he told me to not be sorry because he had a lot of fun hanging out with me!  Then he told me that if I ever needed someone to talk to that I should call him!  And umm, I told him that that probably wouldn't be a good idea considering his group thinks I'm satan and wouldn't appreciate me talking to him!  Well, he told me to call him anyways if I ever needed to talk!  What I nice guy!  Tomorrow is Lani and Frank's one year anniversary!  Aww ... how cute!  I'm jealous!  I don't think I could ever handle being with one person that long, but who knows!  Frank said my mind will change when I find the one!  Well, I have found the one for me ... now I just have to make him realize that I'm the one for him!

      Yesterday I talked to Christian for awhile and it made me happy!  Me and Amanda are going to adopt him as our brother!  We gonna make forms and everything!  He was telling me about how much he loves Sally and how he wants to make things official with her!  I really want that to happen because I think that they will really make each other happy, they make each other better people!  But Sally is scared, and she wants to be with someone that she is allowed to go out with!  And I don't blame her because it would make things a lot easier!  Meh, we'll see how it goes! Friday is Sally's birthday and Christian is coming to our school and then we are all going out to eat!  Yay, it is going to be so much fun!  School is ... depressing!  There is no point for me to be there anymore!  I'm not learning anything, and there is nothing to look forward to anymore!  I go to school for the excitement (Homecoming, Football games, Prom, Basketball games, Chorus concerts, Musicals ...), and there is none of that left, so I don't want to be there! Hmmm ... I blame my depression and laziness on the weather!  If it was sunny I would have more motivation, but right now its gloomy and I don't feel like caring about anything!

      So I had a lot of time to do a lot of thinking today!  First thing I was trying to think about is why I treat Ashleigh so bad, and I came up with an answer! :: I think that I've out grown Ashleigh!  I think its been like that for awhile!  It would explain my bitchiness towards her!  It would explain the lies!  And I think it would deffinately explain me ditching her for my other friends and for Kyle!  I think that I've been feeling this way for awhile, I just didn't want to realize it, ya know?  Because Ashleigh was my best friend, and you never really want to get rid of someone that you were that close to!  But I guess this fight was the last straw, and it really made me think!  It's better this way!  I'm going to be a lot happier, knowing that I won't have to come up with excuses anymore!  And Ashleigh's going to be a lot happier because she won't have to deal with the lies, the ditching, the bitchiness, and me stealing her friends away from her! ::  Then I started to think about Rachel, because she texted me and I told her that if she wanted to talk that she needed to call me because I was sick of texting!  So she called me ... and she talked to Mark for awhile, and then he handed the phone over to me!  I told her that I didn't want her respect, it would be nice to have, but I don't need it!  I told her that I know the truth and that I want her to believe me, but I don't know how to make her!  I told her that I'm not trying to start problems with Ashleigh, and that I'm not telling her that Ashleigh is a liar!  I'm just saying that maybe the story got a little screwed!  Maybe some things were changed out of anger, I don't know!  And I really don't care anymore!  If me and Rachel are meant to be friends then she will believe me, and I can only hope!  I'm not going to cry about it anymore, but no one is worth my tears!    And then I thought about Tiffany and Amanda and I really don't care if they believe me or not because I was never really that close to them, so I wouldn't be losing much!  I mean yeah, we had fun together ... but I have other friends!  It's not like I'm desperate for their friendship!  Alex ... well, I'm sorry about what happend!  But what can I do? Nothing ... If I can't make his friends believe me then there is no way that I'm gonna be able to convince him! Kelly made a point that if he really liked me (which I doubt he does or ever did) he would believe me!  But how could he believe me ... he has nothing to base what he thinks on!  I mean he barely knows me!  Yeah, we went out for almost a month, but we never really talked and he didn't get to learn much about me!  I mean yeah, I'll be sad to lose him ... but I'm not going to worry about it because that just means it wasn't meant to be!  Oh well!  Shandi, I think its bullshit that you pretended to be my friend!  If you didn't like me then you should have told me from the start!  Whatever fucked up friendship we had was a waste of time to the both of us!  We would have been a lot better off if we never met in the first place!

      During 3rd block I was attacked by text messages from Rachel, Tiffany, and Amanda!  MeSsAgE fRoM rAcHeL: "I don't want to be your friend anymore!"  Ok, is it because of my fight with Ashleigh?  Or because everyone thinks that I cheated on Alex?  I need to know!  MeSsAgE fRoM aMaNdA: ... Something alogn the lines of "Did you have fun at prom with Bob?  ... Your're a bitch, I can't believe you cheated on my best friend!"  MeSsAgE fRoM tiFfAnY: Pretty much the same is Amanda!  Well, I didn't cheat on Alex!  I don't know why they would think something like that!  Did I ever give them reason to think I would cheat on him?  NO!  I like Alex a lot and I wouldn't do that to him!  If I wanted to be with someone else then I would have broken up with Alex, I wouldn't cheat on him!  I know how much that hurts and I wouldn't put him through that kind of pain!    But I guess I understand if they don't believe me!  I mean, with all the stuff that is going on with Ashleigh, I don't blame anyone for not trusting me!  I just wish that this could all be forgotten!  I'm really sorry about the whole Ashleigh thing!  No matter what I love her and she is always going to be my ULTIMATE best friend!  I'm sorry about giving Kyle stuff, and I'm never going to do it again!  Not that I'm going to have the chance because Ashleigh hates me with all the fires of hell!  I never meant to hurt her, I just don't think before I do!  And I'm sorry for being such a bitch to her at times, but I don't think she really realizes how much she means to me!  I bitch because I'm jealous and I'm not getting the attention I want!  I would do anything for her, I mean I would drop all my friends just to keep her!  Ahh, it doesn't matter anymore because it's all over now!  ... Oh yeah, Rachel just texted me and she said that the reason she doesn't want to be my friend anymore is because of a lot of things!   Gosh, why can't people tell me whats going on?  Why do people have to tell so many lies?  Why is everyone always getting involved in my life?  Don't they have their own lives to think about?  Come on, I'm not a bad perosn!  I don't want to hurt people!  I don't want people to hurt me!  I just want it to be like it used to be!  I want us all to be friends!

      Lori broke up with Jeremy today!  And I was the first person she called!  I felt happy that she called me, but sad because she was crying!  She thinks that she would be happier with Mark!  And I think that is a great idea because I would love it if her and Mark went out!  Tomorrow at school when I see Lori I'm going to jump on her and give her such a great big hug because I love her so much!  We are going to have a pool party on Sunday if weather permits!  And I talked to Gaylen about having his band play, and yeah ... I'm really excited!  It is going to be so much fun!

      Ashleigh doesn't want to be my friend anymore because she said that I intentionally do things to hurt her and she pretty much implied that anything I to Rachel do defend myself will only make matters worse!  Ummm ... Our friendship is NEVER going to work out, so it's good that we ended it now! Well, I'm that she told me how she feels!  And I'm glad that she ended it now, instead of waiting forever!  Oh wait, she did wait forever!  She's been my friend for almost a year ... and she waited until now to end it!  What a waste of 11 months!  I've been the same person since the day she met me!  So she should have ended it starting day one!  ... So I was watching That 70s Show, and there was a fairy and he asked Eric if he wanted to erase Donna from his memory, because he could make it possible!  And Eric said no because the memories he has of her are so happy and he would never trade them in for anything!   So I was trying to think if I just wanted to delete Ashleigh out of my memory or not!  I don't think it's possible to do so, buf if I could what would I do?  I DON'T KNOW!  So I'm gonna put together a list of good times and bad times and which ever one wins will decided what I would do!  GoOd TiMeS: * Meeting Ashleigh (June 10th) ... Hippy Braids in hair, Hippy Skirt!  Woo! * Hanging out at the skatepark 24/7 * Hanging out at the movies every Friday and Saturday night * Trick or Treating and stealing an item from every house * Chicken Quesadilla's from Taco Bell, yummie! * Being introduced to Rachel, Emily, and Jesi * Ditching work nonstop to hang out with her * "The Kr3w" * Massive amounts of fun sleepovers * Watching Kyle "hold" her, thats it * Nathan going out with me (All thanks to Ashleigh, she made it happen) * Attempting to ditch school with all of them * Going out with Kyle (Wouldn't have met him without her) * Going out with Ben (She found out from him that he liked me!) * Panera * Numerous "First Times" * Following Miles car around, not knowing it was him * Being chased by the LITH cops after Sean Hickey stole a bottle from Dom. * Walking home in the SCARY rain * Freaky Friday, with Nathan!  AHh! * Sneaking into Mean Girls * Getting over my fear of Freddie Kruger (Seeing Freddie vs. Jason) * Fish and Maggot * "I'm addicted to you ..." * "So I said why don't you and I get together ..." * Kissy Kissy * Paper Clip  BaD tImEs: * Telling her I didn't need her when I was drunk * Stealing Emily away from her?  ... Leads to fight! * Stealing Jesi away from her?  ... Leads to fight! * Stealing Rachel away from her?  ... Leads to fight! * Secretly being in love with Joe * Going out with her brother * Sleeping in the basement with him * Giving Kyle stuff ... * Bitching at her * Her bitching at me * Me treating her like crap * Her treating me like crap (even if she didn't realize it) * Her obsessing over Joe, blaming me for problems * Not hanging out with her for a month and a half * Not talking to her for a long time after Kyle broke up with me * Best Friend Times Infinity Infinity = HELL * Having the LITH cops call my house because I talked to Ruby about Ashleigh (No threats by me were made) * Doing stuff with Kyle when he was still going out with Vanessa * Ashleigh going to Jacobs  * Ashleigh meets Erin = No need for Stefanie * Erin hating Stefanie for no reason * Erin calling Stefanie and bitching because Steff and Ash are in a fight * My mom not letting me go to Ash's house, but able to go to other people's house = Problems with Ash cause she thinks Im lying * Tiffany - Pig Face  Wow, surprise surprise, there is more good than bad!  But isn't there always?  Oh well, it doesn't matter!  Even if there were more bad times I could never forget about her!  God, I'm sick of the stupid fights!  It's bullshit!  I really don't need this right now, I have enough problems at home and at school ... I don't need to get shit from her too!    ... ULTIMATE best friends is DEAD!

      So Friday night was TONS of fun, but the fun must end because it gets me into trouble!    Ashleigh is mad at me because I gave Kyle stuff to do and I did it with him and because I ditched her for him!  Ok, I did not ditch her!  She was with Amanda and they have there "Twin" bonding shit going on and I did not want to be apart of that!  It's not like I left her alone, she had Amanda with her!  I think I now understand how Ashleigh felt when I was supposedly stealing Emily?, Jesi, Rachel? away from her!  (Even though she still talks to ALL of them, and I only talk to Rachel!)  I'm not going to watch her steal Amanda away from me, I mean right infront of me!  So I hung out with Kyle!  And you know what, I had tons of fun!  Because ... we talked, a lot and I've never talked to him that much in my life!  I liked it a lot!  Ahh, and then she said that I ditch her for Kyle all the time and that is so not true!  The last time I hung out with her (like a sleepover over there) was Spring Break and both the nights I slept over she had Joe come over, and they basically kicked me out of their room!  So it's not like I was going to sit in the hallway alone, I hung out with Kyle!  Is there anything wrong with that?  NO!  Is that ditching her?  NO!  It's more like she is ditching me for Joe!  Ok, not really!  But it does seem like Joe is the only thing in the world that she cares about!  I mean we get into fights and she tels me that she doesn't care, which is bullshit because if she doesn't care then she shouldn't have started anything in the first place!  AHh, and then last night she tells me that I'm the one that "acts" like I don't care about anything and we all know that is a lie!  If its not a big deal to me then I don't even bring it up, I forget about it because why start problems for no reason?  But if I do care, and I ALWAYS CARE WHEN IT COMES TO ASHLEIGH AND I MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR WHEN I TALK TO HER, then I talk about it!  And thats why I fight with her about it because I don't want her to think I don't care!  I want her to tell ME how she feels so then I can try to change!  I know I'm not a perfect person, I know I make mistakes and that I might be a little brain dead at times, but I'm not the only one!  Ashleigh has her problems too, EVERYONE does!  I was supposed to go to Jamnesty with Lori, Frank, Ryan, and Karina to see Bob's band play, but my mom turned into a major bitch and called me while I was at Ryan's house and made me cry very bad and made me come home!  And then when I got home she kept lecturing me about why I was crying, and the only reason is because she kept yelling at me, and I really wanted to see Bob's band play because I love Bob and yeah, it makes me happy to see him!   So instead I went to Charlotte's surprise party and it was a lot of fun!  More fun then I thought it would be!  First we went to Village Pizza and then we went to the movies to see Shrek 2!  It was a really funny movie!  Oh, I love Sally, Amanda, and Devin so much!  They make me so happy!  Yay!  I was going to have a sleepover with all of them at my house and then go to Sally's church with them in the morning, but that didn't happen because Sally and Amanda's mom said no and Devin couldn't sleepover unless Amanda slept over!  During the movie Rachel and Brittany kept calling me, but I had to hang up on them because I was watching a movie and when I did try to talk to them I couldn't hear them!  SO DON'T THINK I WAS HANGING UP ON YOU TO BE A BITCH, I JUST COULDN'T TALK AT THE MOMENT!  So when the movie was over I called them back and they started to bitch at me for giving Kyle stuff and ditching Ashleigh for Kyle so I told them that I would call them back later, because I didn't want to fight with them infront of everyone!  When I got home they called me and they yelled at me, and lectured me and told me what a bad friend I am to everyone and how I tell everyone they are my best friend, but in reality I talk shit about all of them behind there backs!  So I hung up on them, because I was already in a depressed mood because of my mom and I just didn't want to hear it anymore because I knew that I was going to cry if I listened anymore!  Then I texted Rachel and told her that I needed to talk to her, and only her because Brittany has nothing to do with any of this!  Rachel told me that she was mad at me about the Kyle thing because if I cared about him then I wouldn't do that because it's going to hurt him!  Well, my problem is that I can't say no to him!  I know he would have understood if I said no, but I didn't want to!  I want Kyle to like me (as a friend) and I guess I'll do anything to keep it that way, I don't want to ruin that in any way!  But I know what I did was wrong, and I can assure everyone that I won't do it again because I do care about Kyle and I don't want people to be mad at me!  Then she told me that she was mad at me because I ditch her for Amanda all the time!  That is so not true!  And I thought we talked about this like a month ago!  Yes, I know we talked about it because we were buying food and I pulled her aside to tell her I was so sorry if she felt that I liked Amanda more than I like her because that isn't the truth!  I love Rachel so much more than I could ever even think about loving Amanda!  Rachel means so much to me and I don't know what I would do without her!  Amanda was like my new toy that I wanted to play with all the time because she was new to me, but I realized that NOTHING can ever replace the old!  Because they are the ones that are always gonna be here for you!  And Rachel told me she was fine with it, and we never talked about it again so I thought everything was ok!  And then I month later she decides to bring it up!  She told me that she couldn't tell me the truth to my face, ... so she waited a MONTH to tell me on the phone because that is so much better!  If you have a problem with something I'm doing then she needs to tell me about it right away, not wait this long!  Because now it is OLD news!  I barely ever talk to Amanda anymore, so what is the point of talking about it now?  ... Hmm, there is no point!  Because it is over and done with!  I'm glad that she told me about it, but there is no need to start a fight over it!  Oh yes, and then she made a point to tell me that she is sick of the way I'm treating Ashleigh!  Ok, Rachel is only hearing one side of all of these stories, so she really can't say anything because she doesn't know first hand what is going on!  I know she loves Ashleigh, I love Ashleigh too, more than you could ever imagine and I don't purposely do these things to hurt her!  DUH, I'm not a heartless person, I do feel bad and I try to not do it again, but I guess I just mess up a lot! Ahhh, and Brittany, none of this has to do with her!  She is long gone, out of my life!  I wish it wasn't like that, but it is ... so she has no right to be judging the things that I do!  She is just as bad as me!  She talks shit about Rachel, her BEST FRIEND, Rachel has said shit about her!  We all do it once in awhile!  We are NOT perfect people, none of us are!  ... I'm not forcing any of them to be friends with me!  So if they have so many problems with me they need to learn to talk to ME about it, when it happens, not weeks or even days later, RIGHT AWAY ... or they can just stop being friends with me!  Because I don't need friends that are constantly getting pissed off at me and fighting with me!  That's why I love Lori, Amanda, and Sally so much!  Because they don't fight with me!  They don't start problems, we have good relationships because we all TALK to each other and tell each other how we are feeling!  Because that's what friends do, they talk to each other about things so then the other person can try to work on it!  And friends are understanding, they realize that nobody is perfect, we all have our problems, we all have our mistakes, but none of us would ever intentionally do soemthing to hurt someone else!  The End!

      Guess where I am right now ... Kyle's room!  Hanging out with him cause Ashleigh and Amanda are in the other room!  ... Sleeping, maybe!  I don't know!  I think Ash is mad at me cause I'm in here, cause I always come in here, but he's just cool!  I still LOVE her the most!  Forever and always!  She is my best friend in the whole wide world, ULTIMATE best friends!  We went to Taco Bell with Karolina, Ashleigh and Amanda!  It was great fun!  Yummie Burrito Supreme!  And then we sat in there forever because it was pouring rain!  Then we stuck into a movie (13 Going On 30) and it was really good!  It made me horny and I wanted love!  Then we started to walk home and it started to pour rain and it was really cold and wet and I was soaked to my underpants!  And there was lightening and it scared me and I screamed!   OOHH, Christian called me from the Dashboard concert and I got to hear part of a song and it made me happy because I l LOVE them so much and I need to go see them next time they are out here!  Ok, goodbye!

      Ashleigh called me not to long ago to inform me that Kyle, her brother, is getting sent away for 6 months and is cutting himself really deep!  I feel ... horrible!  I can't go through this again!  I'm sick of people I care about hurting themselves!  Yeah, sure ... I haven't seen Kyle in awhile, but I do talk to him online occasionally and I do care a lot about him!  And to hear how hurt Ashleigh was hurt me!  Because I love her and I just want her to be happy and for everything in her life to be happy, INCLUDING her brother!  God Kyle, why do you have to be so fucking stupid?  Don't you understand that you're not the only one you're hurting!  You're hurting everyone around you as well!

      The chorus concert was interesting!  Everyone looked so, slutty!  I loved it so much!  I guess our Chicago medly was ok!  My boa started to choak me, and I was slipping on my shoes!  But that's ok, who cares if little old me dies?  Nobody!  ... Our Beatles thing was good!  I liked it a lot!  Sally did so awesome on her solo!  I was so proud!   After we were done singing I went to Taco Bell with Kyle, Amanda, and Christian!  Yummy Yummy Yummy I got food in my tummy!  I love that place so much!  It reminds me of Ryan O'Connell and poofed meat!  (hehe)  When I got home Bob, Frank, Karina, and Lori were over!  But they had to leave just as I was getting home!  It made me really sad! ... I was starting to worry about everyone liking Mark more than they like me, but I guess there is no need for me to worry!  Frank told me that he likes us both equally!  And Bob and Sean told me they like me more!  Woo!  It made me happy!   Why does Lori like Mark so much?  What does she see in him?  I don't understand!

      Everything is screwing up!  Me and Mark got into a fight during flex!  He called me a fat whore!  Thanks Mark, that really boosts my self esteem!  So I just left and cried to Kyle and Amanda!  I'm sick of Mark!  Everyone likes him better, except for Ashleigh and Amanda because they assured me that they don't!  It made me feel a little bit better, but how about everyone else?  There is Frank, Lani, Karina, Lori, Ryan O'Connell, Sean, Kyle, Kyle, Rachel, Shandi ... the list goes on forever!  What is so likeable about him?  I don't understand!   ... So you must be wondering what sparked this ridiculous fight, go ahead, ask!  Me taking my AFI CD back from Mark because I got mad that he took it without asking me!  Then he accused me of stealing his shit all the time!  So I asked him what I took, and he called me a name and I left!  Ahh, I don't like him at all!  There is a deffinate chance that I won't see or talk to Alex this weekend, which is sad!  Because Rachel is going to be with Brittany all weekend!  Well, what does that have to do with you seeing Alex?!  The only time I see him is when I'm at her house!  And it's not like I call him or anything, so there isn't a way for me to make plans with him!  Ahh, so call him!!  But I can't because I get nervous because there are always those awkward silences and Ahhh, I hate them so much!   After school today, actually after 3rd block I went home with Karina and we hung out in my room for a long time!  I finished my CapriSun purse and it made me really happy because I've been wanting one for so long!  Yay!  Then we went to Karina's house and she tried to hem my dress, but it didn't work becuase the fabric is weird!  So I had to come home and hand sew it!  It was a pain in the ass! On my way home I practically got attacked by 2 dogs, it was scary because I don't like animals at all!  But then the owner came and saved me!   Oh, my dad was about to drive my car over to the place to get it fixed today and it wouldn't start!  Dammit, I'm so sick of my piece of shit car!  It makes me miserbale and it only leads to problems!  I need a new car!  Ahh, and he tried to blame it not starting on me!  He told me that I should have tried to start it every couple days to make sure it was still working!  How the hell was I supposed to know to do that unless he told me?  ThInGs To LoOk FoRwArD tO tHiS wEeKeNd (or next): *Jamnesty *Charlotte's Surprise Party *Ashleigh's Birthday Party *Sleepover at Ashleigh's (tomorrow) *Sleepover at Christian's Condo *LAST Chorus Concert (tonight at 7 30 ... be there or be square!)

      My mom is taking Ana and Micheal's break up way to seriously!  I mean she wants Micheal to die!  And that's stupid!  It wasn't even a serious realationship!  I mean yes, they did go out for 3 to 4 months, but they never really talked and they weren't intimate!  They were just friends that happend to call each other boyfriend and girlfriend!    I finally have enough CapriSun packets to make my purse!  I'm excited!  I've been drinking and drinking and drinking and now I finally don't have to drink anymore because I have enough!  Tomorrow I have a chorus concert at 7 30 and everyone should be there because it is going to be ... interesting!  We're singing and dancing along to a Chicago medly, and it is going to suck!  We're also singing 3 Beatles songs, and we don't know the words to half of them!  SALLY GOT THE SOLO AND I'M SO PROUD OF HER!  She really deserved it!   Oh, Story ... So Sally tells Meghan that she got the solo and Meghan says "Well, I can't really be happy for you because I wanted to solo too!"  Wow, what a bitch!  She could have alteast pretended to be happy for Sally!  Words of Jackie, "Meghan acts like she is God's gift to music, and she isn't!"  It is so true!  Meghan doesn't want a future in music, she wants to be a doctor or something, so why does she care so much about being in Chorale and getting the solos?!  Grr, stupid people piss me off much!

      So I've been posting in my Live Journal and NOTHING I'm posting has been showing up!  I have made 2 posts in the last 2 days and none of them are showing up, but I know that I saved them!  And the ones that showed up before that have screwed up dates, and that kind of stuff really pisses me off so I'm making a whole new journal at a whole new site!  Woo, and that brings me to this oh so wonderful Blog!    I'm talking to Ryan, my new friend for Battle of the Bands, right now and it is making me so happy, you have no idea!  But everything he talks about is WAY over my head!  First he was talking about how a new universe is created every second, and then he started to talk about how some experiment was done with suicide to go there!  Wow, I understood none of it!  And now we are talking about A Clockwork Orange, but I don't have much to say because I've never seen the movie!  I've heard its a great movie, and I know that I should see it, but I've never got around to it!    gOaLs FoR tHe WeEk/WeEkEnD: *Rent and watch A Clockwork Orange *Have a sleepover with Ashleigh *Hopefully see Rachel and ALEX *Go to Charlotte's surprise party *Go to Jamnesty *Attempt to sleepover at Christian's condo in Wisconsin

      Yesterday Lori came home with me after school, after our LAST DAY OF SCHOOL!  It was so exciting!  There really wasn't much to do at my house, we just sat around and drew pictures!  Lori drew a picture of me and Bob and I tried to draw a picture of her, but it turned out really bad!  I will deffinately be ripping that page out of my sketchbook!   After school was out for everyone Amanda came over and we tanned in my front yard for awhile!  You can actually see a little difference!  That makes me happy because I want to be dark, like a Mexican! Mark got yelled at for letting Paulina paint his nails so my dad made me take everyone home, it was sad!  I warned Mark that it was going to get my dad mad, but does anyone listen to me?  No!  Never! Once my mom got home from work me and Mark went over to Lori's house!  She made a grilled cheese sandamiches!  Yummie!  Then we sat in her room for awhile and watched tv!  After awhile people started to show up at Bob's house for the bonfire, so we went over there too!  A lot of people came . . . Lisa, Evan & girlfriend, Asian, Monica, Lani, Frank, Hank & girlfriend, Kam, Andy, CJ, Steve, Karina, and umm a lot of other people that I didn't know! I slept over at Jay's house because I couldn't sleep over at Lori's house!  Ummm, yeah . . . that is all that needs to be said about that!  I had to be out of his house by 4, so I picked up Lori and we went to Steak 'n Shake and then to Meijer!  WOO!

      Last night I didn't do anything!  And I didn't mind at all!  I enjoyed being by myself very much so!   ... Lani said that I should spend time with myself because then I will figure out who I am!  Because right now I don't know who I am!  I don't have a set personality, I have multiple!  They change depending on who I am hanging out with!  ... How pathetic is that?  I shouldn't have to change myself just to make people happy! I was talking to Lani, and I told her that I wanted to be lovable!  Well, not lovable because I'm not ready for love, but likable, because I want Bob to like me!  Lani told me that if I have to change myself to make someone like me then it isn't meant to be!  During chorus today we watched The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Breakfast Club!  Two amazing movies!  Mrs. Minger bought us donuts and they were really yummie!  I love them!  Yay! After school Charlotte gave me and Amanda a ride to my house and yeah!  It was fun because we got to ride in her convertable, and the wind blowing in our hair was just so much fun!  Me and Amanda made a pizza and tanned outside for about an hour!  We put heart shaped stickers on our stomachs so we could see the change!  THERE IS A CHANGE!  I have a baby tan line!  Woo Hoo!  It really excites me!  Then we just sat around my house for a really long time!  That was the end of my wonderful day!  It was a lot of fun, I love spending time with Amanda!  This morning I burnt my ear on my straightener!  And then just like a couple minutes ago I took my earings out of my ear, and scratched it and all this blistered, pussy skin came off!  It was really disguesting!  Why, why me?!

      Yesterday Lori, me, and Mark went swimming at my grandpa's pool, because my sister was having her cast party or something!  Marcea showed up, and it made me so happy because I haven't hung out with her in the longest time!  After awhile of sitting, and getting fat me and Marcea decided to go in the pool ... and then Lori and Mark joined us!  It was a lot of fun! I peverted the little kids by showing them how to get clevage!   1-2-3-Make it grow!   Then my sister's drama teacher yelled at me and told me that the little boys were not used to seeing boobs, and blah blah blah!  While this is all going on I can hear Mark chanting in the background, "Slut Slut Slut!"  Wow, that sure did make me feel special!   Then we went back to my house and waited for Frank and Bob to come over!  Ummm, they didn't stay for very long!  Bob spent most of the time typing a report on sports for Mark!  What a nice guy!  ... I shaved Franks neck, and he got razor burn a little bit, and I felt bad!  Oh well! The guys refused to take Lori home because they had buisness to take care of!  ... But they ended up not being able to do or get what they wanted because a group of black men started to walk towards their car, and I guess they got scared or something?    Only 2 more days of school!  I am so happy!  I really need a break!  I'm so sick of studying, and dealing with all the people!  The people that are worth seeing I will see over the summer, and I can't wait!  I miss Ashleigh, a lot!  And I want to see her!  Thursday is our 1 year anniversary (We've been best friends for that long!)  So I think we are going to have a sleepover or something, YAY!

      Yesterday me, Lori, Markie, Ana, Uncle Rysui, and my mom went to The Art Institute of Chicago!  It was so much fun!  I really wanted to see this one chicken painting, but I couldn't find it anywhere and I was so upset!  I saw it there in 8th grade when I went to the Institute for a field trip, and it's been my favorite ever since!  Ummm, it was fun at first . . . until I started to feel really sad, so I just walked ahead of everyone for a long time and, felt sorry for myself!   Then we went to lunch!  Me and Mark and Lori got Chinese food and everyone else went to a bakery thing!  Some homeless person asked Mark for a meal, and Mark didn't have any money so he offered the guy our leftovers, and he gave Mark a dirty look and said no!  Then he asked my uncle for some money and he gave him 2$ and then the homeless guy started to complain about how he needed more money and blah blah blah!  It's the guys fault that he is like that, if he wanted a better life, then he should have thought about his actions before he acted upon them!  Lori came over for a bit, and I took a shower so her and Mark got a bit of alone time!  They are so cute together, and they actually talk, and they don't seem shy around each other!  That makes me so happy!  THEY DIDN'T DO ANY NAUGHTY THINGS ON MY BED, that makes me happy!  Then Karina came over and we drove her to Lori's house with us!  ... Then Bob and Frank came over!  Me and Lori went downstairs to get food, and they all ditched us!  It was really sad, and it really pissed me off!  Because, I drove Karina over here to hang out with us, and then she ditches us for the guys! . . . You know what, I tried so hard to like Karina, and trust me ... it was hard considering we don't have a good background!  All she cares about is Ryan, and I'm sick of hearing about him!  Yeah, I like guys, but I don't talk and complain about them ALL the time like she does!  Ryan loves Monica, and she needs to deal with it!  She needs to find someone new!  Understand that for the time being he is with someone else, and you aren't going to get him back!  Not that she even deserves him back ... How many times did she break up with him?  If I was Ryan, I would have gotten sick of it really fast!  If she loved him as much as she did, she would have never let him go in the first place! . . . Me and Lori went to the park, and played on the swings, then on the tire swing, and the pushy thing, and then we walked back to her house because bugs were everywhere and they were eating us alive!  When we got to Lori's house Hank and Evan were in her driveway!  It made me happy because Evan is so awesome!  Ummm, we sat around his car for about 45 minutes, and then we went into the gazebo (excuse spelling) ... we umm did nothing!  We all called each other, and it was funny because we were in the same room, so yeah!  lol  Then Frank, Karina, and Bob came back!  They wouldn't tell us where they went which was bullshit!  Well, once they got back I started to feel sad so I just layed in the grass for a bit, alone!  Then some of the guys came over and Frank tried to rape me up the ass and I struggled to get away and I started to hit random people that were around me!  I just wanted to be alone!  And I called my mom and asked her to pick me up, but she said she wouldn't until her movie was over!  AHH!  Steve came home around 10 30 and they were all going to have a bon fire, yay!   Well, once I realize that I want to stay at Lori's my mom calls me and is like I'm coming to get you!  MISTAKE!  She yelled at me in the car because she said that I'm acting to depressed and she's sick of it!  Then she made me tell her the problem!  And instead of trying to comfort me, like I needed, ... she yelled at me and told me what I was doing wrong like always!    I'm really sick of all this bullshit!  I don't care about anyone anymore!  I just want to be left alone!

      So we go see Harry Potter at 3 40, but the tickets were almost sold out so we decided to see it at 4 30.  We went to Taco Bell for awhile, and it was yummie!  Lani had the most delicious taco thing I've ever tasted in my life, I'm in love!   The movie was so amazing, and Harry Potter got so hott!  I mean, I always thought he was cute, but now he is HOTT, sexy!  OW OW!  Ummm, the guy that played Syrus or something like that was the guy that played Sid in Sid and Nancy!  Ha, it was funny to see Sid get old!   The we went back to my house and we all hung out in my room and the madness with Nathan started, I don't want him to fucking touch me, and he wouldn't stop!  We walked to Karina's house, she wasn't home ... so we walked to Ryan's house, he had his girlfriend over!  Ahh!  I keep getting denied!  lol  I'm sleeping over at Lori's house and ... it's happy to be with her because I love her oh so much, but I'm miserable!  Everyone I do want love from is giving it to everyone else, and the one person I don't want it from is willing to give it!  I don't like it at all!  I don't like Nathan like that, and I'm sick of all of his lies!  I mean seriously, that is all he does!   And ... I don't feel liked by the guys!  I mean, I don't know ... I'm a very touchy, huggy person and when I don't get the affection I want I get really jealous!  Hmmm ... and I don't know ... I only really care about Bob!  I know I shouldn't care, but I do!  Then Lori was like well, I could talk to him!  But that would be stupid because what there is to be said won't help any!  "Stefanie likes you a lot, and you mean so much to her, even though she doesn't show it all the time.  She would do anything to make you feel the same way, but she can't, so she'll just waist her life being depressed about it!  The End!"  Wow, I'm sure that would help the situation TONS!

      So I get home ... and sleep!  Because I'm depressed and I guess sleep is a side effect of depression?  I don't know, that's what my mom told me!  I don't know why I'm depressed, I just know that I'm not as happy as I should be, maybe that's why I'm depressed!  Because I want to be happier, but I don't know how!  During school I asked Gabe what was wrong with me, and he just put his head down!  So I was like, NO, tell me!  And then he was like "When you say you love somebody, and then you say it to everyone else it makes it seem like it's a joke!"  So I started to feel really sad, and I made Amanda go for a walk with me and talk to me!  And I decided that I might, maybe like him!  So I told him that I loved him, and that I wasn't going to say it to anyone else!  And then he hugged me and told me that I have his heart!  Awww! Charles called me after school and was like what would you do if Gabe asked you out!  And I was like, I don't know, I might say yes!  Then Charles called back awhile later and asked me out for Gabe or something, and I was like I don't know ... and then Gabe got on the phone ... and then we got disconnected so I don't know what is going on!  Ummm ... and I really don't care!  This is odd, and I'm not sure if I like it! I don't want to seem like I slut and go out with Gabe just because he asked me out, and I can't say no to people!  I don't even know if Charles is serious, so there is really no reason for me to get stressed over it, but oh well!  I want to go out with someone that I actually like and I can see myself being with for awhile!  School is almost out, and I'm not sure if I'll see Gabe over the summer!  And I'm going to be working a lot, 2 jobs if possible, so I might not have time for anyone!  Ahh, crap!  I had a walk through at Dolphin's Cove today!  I'm so happy that I officially have the job!  I loved working there so much, it was some of the best times of my life!  And I made such great friends last summer,  Tiffany: My Morning Drinking Partner, Angela: My Lover, Nathan: Boyfriend That Nobody Wanted Me To Have, Robbie: The "One" That I Will Never Have, Alex: Ice Buddy, and Sam: Human Sex Guide!   OH, I saw Tiffany and she has really short hair now!  I love it so much!  I also saw Sam, she looks the same!  Nobody else is working there again!  They all have better jobs, or are to lazy to work!  Hmmm ... I saw Alex's friend Andrea there!  She is going to be an attendant!  Oh, she is so pretty and so nice!  I like her much!

      I love Karina, and I think Ryan was so lucky to have her and he should take her back because it is the right thing to do!  She cares so much for him!  On our way to/from Jewel she was talking about him and how she feels like his mom sometimes because she worries about him so much!  She hates the drugs and drinking and she said that she worries about him when he "dances" (lol, skanks), because of his heart!  She really doesn't want anything to happen to him and oh, she just loves him so much!   For awhile I would have done anything to break them up because we all know how in love I was with the boy!  But now I can see that he means so much to her, and I will never ever try to ruin that for her ever again!  Today Emilie's dad forgot to pick us up at 1 30 so we were sitting at school until 2 waiting for a ride home!  It was depressing, but fun because I got to spend that time with Emilie!   She brought a happy drink to school, and it made me happy . . . very happy!  :o)  Karina and Lori came over today and it was fun!  We were talking about college and our adult lives and how we want to spend all of it together!  Me and Karina are going to go to ECC for one year and then after that we are gonna go to The Art Institute!  We'll be there for one year, and then Lori will join us!  We're going to live in one of the triple dorm/apartment things!  We are going to go there for 4 years and then move to Sleepy Hollow, or somewhere like that!  Karina decided that we're going to have a summer and a winter house!  We haven't decided where our summer house is going to be!  Ohhh ... We are all going to live next to each other and our kids are going to go to preschool together and it is going to be so much fun!   Me and Karina are going to be cute moms and we are going to wear overalls and those fun peasent tops with bows by the tummy!  We WON'T be caught dead in spandex!  lol

      Ummm . . . I'm really ready for school to be over!  I figured that was a perfect way to start my entry!  There is nothing left to do!  I took my Psychology final today, and I got an A on it!  That means no more 4th block for the rest of the year!  Oh, that class made me so happy!  We never did anything, it's grand! I have a D in design, that means I'm gonna be spending all of flex all week working on a basket that is going to give me up to 200 extra credit point!  WOO!  I really need that!    I finally got up the nerve to call the Park District about my job!  (( I hate talking on the phone )) And I was like "I had an interview about a month ago and Brian told me I got the job, and he showed me my schedule, but I never got the papers in the mail!"  Then she asked me who I was and she told me that they would get those to me soon and that there is a Walk Through on Thursday and sometime that I forgot!  Woo!  That means I wasn't lying to my parents and they should apologive a zillion times because they put me through hell with all of the yelling!  I really did not appreciate it, because I knew I was telling the truth!   Ohh, and I might have a job at Target!  I need to work a lot this summer, because my car is dead!  There is no point in putting more money into because now its going to cost 2000$ to get it fixed and you can buy a used car with that much money!  So my mom and me had a talk and we decided that instead of going to The Art Institue when I graduate, I'm just gonna go to ECC for one year, to prepare myself!  That means, ... I get a new car because going to ECC for a year is going to save them so much money!   We had a whole discussion on college and I don't think I'm ready to go away to school!  I don't think I can take care of myself, I'm not mature enough!  And ... going to ECC can help me decided what I want to do with my life!  Now, I say I want to go into Graphic Design or Psychology, but what if thats really not what I want?  Then I would be wasting time and money going to a "big" school studying that!    Me and Karina went to the mall because she had to buy a skirt from Aero!  It is so cute, its they white skirt I wanted, but my mom wouldn't let me get because she said it was to short and skanky!  Aww, that made me a bit sad, but oh well!  There are so many cute clothes I want, I need to get a job or money or something!  I was thinking about taking money from my parents, but AHH, most of us know what happend last time I did that and I really don't want to get caught again!  Eeek! After the mall we went to Jewel because Karina had to buy supplies for making cookies for her Excel class!  As I was walking in I was pretty sure that I saw Rachel, Amanda, Alex, and some other people leaving!  I wanted to run up to Rachel and give her a hug, but then I decided not to because I didn't want to see Amanda or Alex because we all know how much I'm hated!  Aww, :o(  Anyways, I made sure Karina bought all cheap stuff to make the cookies becuase I didn't want her to waste her money on people none of us care about!  I saved her MUCHO money!  We did the self check out thing and it was so much fun!  The machine detected an "unknown object" in the bad area and it made me  laugh because the unknown object was my hand!  HAHA!  Then we drove home and I kept the bag safe, because I didn't want the eggs to break!  Karina dropped me off at home and I seat belted the bag of grocerys into the front seat, just to keep them safe!  HA, wow . . . I'm such a loser!  When I got home my dad went psycho on me and made me do yard work!  It made me mad because I need to clean my room because I have pink fluff all over my carpet, and everywhere is covered in clothes and it is really pissing me off!  So I guess I was a little bitchy towards him, but not enough to get cranky over!  Well, anyways ... my mom said that I made my dad cry and I don't understand what I could have done that is that bad!  I mean all I did is be cranky when he asked me to help with yard work, no big deal!   Well, then my mom told me that my dad is "sad" because he really thinks that I should be able to have a brand new car, because when he was my age his dad (( my grandpa )) bought him a really nice car!  I felt bad for being a bitch, I'm going to say I'm sorry when he gets home!  Ok, buh bye!
