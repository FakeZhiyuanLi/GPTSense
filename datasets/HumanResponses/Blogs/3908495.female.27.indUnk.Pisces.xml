      today and yesterday i was not overwhelmed at the feeling of needing to get out of this relationship.&nbsp; i was absolutley blase about everything, i had nothing to say and i felt nothing either way.&nbsp; the only thing that made me feel anything was realizing that i was underwhelmed, which is almost as upsetting to me as being overwhelmed.  being overwhelmed is more difficult to handle for me, but being underwhelmed makes me worry that i will never be moved to action, and i will just sit and sit and sit.  can i just get some sort of balance?&nbsp; i do not want to live everyday with a flood of emotions and worries and unhappiness, but i also do not want to live everyday with no feeling.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      last night when i went to bed, i fell asleep for about an hour, and woke up suddenly.&nbsp; when i woke up in a sort of dreamstate it went through my head to not break up with cb-- but that is not true.&nbsp; if i don't do it, i don't know if i will ever be happy.  i have had a tough year.&nbsp; no tragedies, just life not affording me any sort of breaks.&nbsp; i don't know what to do with myself, i have NO money-- as of right now i qualify for welfare-- two college degrees half of a masters deans list every year favorite of all my professors, and i can buy food with food stamps.&nbsp; i don't-- but i could.&nbsp;   i have never been really happy, i'm not sure if it's depression or if nothing is ever good enough for me.&nbsp; i mean there are brief times in my life when i have been happy-- the main one when i lived in spain.&nbsp; the other time my senior year of college, after being single throughout college i finally got used to being single and had a really good time, i loved my classes, my roommates, my lifestyle, my friends.&nbsp; but this year is the most unhappy of my life and i need to change everything.&nbsp; EVERYTHING.&nbsp;   i don't want to do this, if i had my way i would still be in love with cb-- i'm just not.&nbsp; this will crush him.&nbsp; i don't know what to do, i don't know where to go,&nbsp; this is really sad but other than not wanting to cause him any pain, the only reason i can't build up the courage is i don't have the money to do this.&nbsp; i really have nowhere to go.&nbsp; literally.  i just wish someone would save me.&nbsp; i have never wanted or needed help in my life, now i need it-- i really need it, and i don't know where ask or how.

      okay.&nbsp; so if I enjoy going out and seeming single and meeting boys, doesn't that mean I should not be in a relationship?&nbsp; I talked to this boy the other night for awhile and he was so cute and nice.&nbsp; I don't want to go out with him, but i enjoyed being by myself so i could talk to him all night, and look at him.&nbsp; Now i keep thinking I want to see him again, so i hope i run into him. &nbsp; If i don't get&nbsp;out of current relationship, I am afraid I will cheat. &nbsp; A few months ago I wanted to with a friend from college.&nbsp; When I was saying goodbye, I could not let go-- we also held hands all night.&nbsp; Then for months I could not get him out of my head.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When I'm out by myself I feel single.&nbsp;

      okay.&nbsp; so the following is going to make me sound obsessed but i'm not.&nbsp; remember these are the things i can't say to anyone else. &nbsp; i have lost any sexual desire&nbsp;for current boyfriend (cb), i sleep with him like a fifties housewife that does it to fulfill her husband's manly needs.&nbsp; the other night as i was fulfilling those needs, in order to get through it, i shut my eyes and imagined the ex mentioned below (we'll call him xz).&nbsp; imagining i was with him made it bearable, but it also did something else.&nbsp; with my eyes shut face pressed into cb's shoulder, tears leaked out of my eyes because i knew i have to get out of this.&nbsp;  &nbsp; i cried secretly during sex. &nbsp; when it was over i went into the bathroom and washed my face and bawled silently.&nbsp;  &nbsp; i don't know how to do this.&nbsp; i will break his heart.&nbsp; i'm just not in love...&nbsp; how do i do this how do i do this how do i do this how do i this howdo i this how do i do thishow do i do this how do i do this

      let me start by saying i am in a 3 year relationship that i think i need to end.  i said it out loud yesterday for the first time, and today i am writing it for the first time, and my heart is breaking over it...i just can't help the way i feel.  but that is not what i want to write about today...  yesterday i saw an ex.  we have been broken up since i was 20 which makes seven years of being broken up.  however throughout the years, a few times we slept together, and we have remained friends, he has kept me in his life-- i'm much worse about keeping in touch.  the last time we were together, 3 years ago, was in a hotel room, and it was completely unexpected.  we went to a wedding together as friends.  the way it all went down was very hot.  i had a sunburn, so i was in my underwear (no bra) wrapped in a sheet.  we didn't even start by kissing, i remember being on the bed on my knees and him behind me, pressing against me-- by coincidence we were in front of a mirror so we made eye contact by mirror.  god this sounds like some shitty cinemax movie, but it wasn't-- it was hot.  so we slept togehter, slowly and passionately-- then again the next morning.  then i left, i went back to the city where i lived and he back to his.  when i got back, i got very serious with current boyfriend.  so yesterday i saw him, and he looks incredible, better than i ever thought before.  i also met his girlfriend.  they have been together 8 months, and it is the first girl he has dated since we broke up, and maybe like the 2nd girl he has slept with since me.  anyway, i do not want him back, but i was so attracted to him i could barely breathe.  i could not take my eyes off of him.  he touched my knee and i got short of breath.  all i wanted to do was slide towards him, run my hands all over him and press my forehead against his and look into his eyes.  but he has a girlfriend, and i have a lump in my throat because i am almost destroyed at the thought that maybe there really has been a last time.

      okay.  so here i go.  i don't know why i haven't done this sooner.  i guess i'm bored enough at work to think about it so i'm starting now-- and I guess i have alot to say that i am not comfortable saying to anyone i know.  i think if i can just get these things out of my head, i may be able to think clearly.  since i don't know if this is going to work, i'll stop now.
