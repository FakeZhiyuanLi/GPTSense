      I love how I started this thing and then dont add to it. Well I'm bored again, so it's time time add another chapter to the live of me!....  i'm sitting at home on a saturday watching Jacksons: An American Dream... I'm pathetic and sad. But I'm going out tonight which is good, cause i desperately need it. I cant wait to move into my new apartment and be downtown though, cause living with the parents is a bit tricky. "hey mom, this is the boy i'm bringing home tonight.... dont mind the moaning."  working is slowly killing me. everyone's nice, but frankly, the next IBM employee is not supposed to be me. but whatever, it's money.... still seriously considering porn... not gonna lie... lol. who knows, right?  OH AND! Chris and I got tickets to go see Madonna on July 19th! HOW EXCITING! I made him CRY. He called me and asked if i was serious when i left him an email saying i had bought tickets.... and he was CRYING! it was so cute. he's wanted to see her since he was like 5 and now he'll be front row!  anyway, i think i need a nap. i'm getting tired and I have nothing more to say I will begin updating this more regularly... not that anyone is reading anyway. lol  until we e-meet again,

      Well Hi All....  I've decided it's blog time. I don't know why, but something just gabbed ahold of me and  said " paul,  shar your life with the world... let them hear your tale!"...  which is surprising cause it's usually saying let them see your tale...but I digress.   So maybe it's the fact that I'm bored at work, or that I'm thinking of dropping my sick  day job and  becoming a porn star-- which is always interesting-- that makes me want to share my trials and trib's... but whatever.   Follow along if you want..  I'm  always liable  to get myself into fucked  up situations.  that's all for now...  i'll be back later... maybe i'll even explain who I am.

                                 Pride 2004: 4 Days in the Village                                        -- OR --                                Chris' Geography Lesson.       Well, my little children of the corn,  that season is upon us again! The time when the fruits of our great country bask in the gloriously gay sun and spend hours proving that --contrary to popular belief-- the gay population is NOT all about sex, nudity and liqour....   wait a minute!  Has Queer as Folk taught you nothing? This is not 'Gay as Blazes' people, this is PRIDE! the celebration of everything perverse and wrong with the gay village-- which oddly enough has me coming back for more and more and more and more and more....   So here we sit, another mass email engaging us into the story that was this weekend's festivities.  Everyone's counting on me! I must be witty, funny and 'mo beyond belief.... I'll do my best.    Our story of gay starts on a friday morning,   It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Having just arrived home from work at 2am, and packing for 4 hours, I took my mother and brother downtown on NO sleep and proceeded to move my crap into an apartment,. This will now be known as the gay ghetto... it's poverty chic with a touch of Annie: The Musical... you know...  "It's the hard knock life, for us...." .   .. ah, one pararagh in and i've already made a musical reference...    All moved in and with the purchase of some lovely new Martha dishes.--.gotta give her some jail-bartering money-- I sat down on my floor, where the couch will one day be located and admired my new digs. Quite frankly, I did me some good apartment hunting.   Enter Lana, a fabulously cute lesbian/Bi-sexual/Jew who's coming to stay with my in my dining room for the weekend. It's okay, I dont have a dining room table anyway, so there's lots of space! Now this is the part where I RAVE about how good a friend Lana is.... How she came to my apartment and painted the entire living room for me, AND how she gave me an excessive amount of weed to make ME want to paint too... it's a shitty edging job, but at least the walls arent white in there anymore. So anyway, we're sitting on the carpet, in my room of ghetto gay with the nice coloured walls and Lana breaks out the guitar... says pick a song -- and we sing and sing and sing... I loved it. I found Pat Benetar and made Lana play it repeatedly.  I LOVE PAT BENETAR!   Enter more lesbians.   Samantha and Emily:         I'm calling them Lesbiennes, and my reasons for this are threefold. A) the millenium. B) they're too pretty to be dykes. and 3) Emily is from Montreal and that's funnier. They have lovely outfits for this entire weekend, and It makes me happy. They also introduce us to the most random of women throughout the weekend, whom we loose in shops on yonge street while shopping because we're mindless bitches who dont care about people...   "Where's Carly?? Oh... we left her in a store in a city she's not from... she'll find her way home. no biggie.... "    Friday night we hit the clubs and party it up style at buddies. We dance, we sing to Beyonce and BEP... let's get RETARDED, is the song people... dont PC my Gay Day.  All in all, a good night. I make out with random boys, Emily and Samantha dance like fools and Lana .... " where's Lana?? OH... she's over there with.... OH!!!!!!!!!!!"  3am, Paul goes home making out with some boy.  930 am. Lana comes home ... okay, In reality, Lana came to my place at 430am, but I didnt hear the damn door... It's okay, she had someone to sleep over with anyway....   So we wake up saturday and I have errands to run. I have a Chris to get, I require my cute little homo so that the quota of gay can be restored... there were way too many lesbians. Thespians? lesbian thesbians? rudabega. PAT BENTAR?!!!   We get Chris on the Via, and then head back to my place. After some misdirection, we find it again, and find Mike on my doorsteps. Oh good, the three Ami-ho's are here. I love it. An hour later, Emily and Samantha are back. We're smokin in the living room, we're sipping juice from martha stewart mugs... it's divine. We head out for some shopping and then the ladies leave to get ready at Emily's... We chill out at mine and Joy and Nathan pop by a little later on. It's time for the bar:   Now, Saturday night is a little shady. It may have something to do with the fact that we were influenced by lana's magic bag of plant. It may be the fact that we started drinking at 10, and I bough 4 rounds of shots and 10 vodka coolers before i SWITCHED to beer.... liqour beofre beer people... or it may be that I just have no memory capacity at all... I'm blaming that last one, cause we all know i"m not a lush....   shut up Genevieve. You too Jeffrey.   So here's what I remember from saturday, in a nutshell:   Emily and Samantha were MIA... Buddies was the place; drinking was the game. Met bryce there with some kids I dont know, but danced with anyway. There was a boy in a sailor hat and a boa, who we made fun of then I think I made out with later. The bartender hit on me and gave me free vodka... no complaints. I met half of my highschool, made out with 3 or 4 more boys and did things i'm not happy about in a back corner.   Somehow we end up at Woody's and we meet Lana's friend from highschool, Joshua. He's cute. We make out, he says he's straight, Chris gets mad and I lose him, but I stick around and find out there's no chance in HELL this boy is straight...  nor is his friend who's wearing the dog colar and the chain. Lana leaves us, cause she cant take watching her highschool friend flirt with her university friend, and somehow i end up with part of the chain attatched to me...   NOTE TO SELF : When a cute boy and his cute friend tell you they want to tie you up, do NOT allow his cute eyes and unbuttoned shirt to sway your judgement. DO NOT DO IT....   okay do it, but, not in public.   and dont run into them the next day, it's only going to be awkward.... especially for Lana   Next thing I know, I'm reunited with Mike and two new random boys in the street. I honestly have NO idea how i got out there, just that I was no longer chained up and that was good enough for me. Having had enough cool metal on my skin, I decided it was time to roll around on the street with Heavenly Heights, a drag queen I know from Tango's.... she dances to Britney; we like her.   After many photographs of us all sprawled out on Churchstreet with a drag queen in white, I turn around to find DYLAN! Where'd Chris go?! I have no idea.... Dylan's coming home with me, despite his 8am wake up the next day. It's 5am! He's got 3 hours before he has to be up!!!  Back to my apartment... more smoke, more martha mugs and more singing with the guitar until the sun comes up at 545.... my neighbours hate me, I've been living there for a DAY lol Chris comes home, shocked and appauled that we've got 4 boys in a sleeping bag...   Now. For the sake of all of us, I'm going to leave out the next part of the night. Because, while I remember it vaguely, I dont want to. I will say this: Lana, I'm sorry you had to sleep through that, and next time, we'll get 2 sleeping bags. Or maybe just take it to my room instead of giving the neighbours a free porno show-- since I have no curtains either, they witnessed all of that. We're ignoring that.    SUNDAY!  We put memories of saturday behind us and hit up the parade. Enter Shaleen, Corrine and some kid Lana knows from Wonderland. Gay men are everywhere, and penis' are rampant. I wont delve into this too much, because frankly it was on TV and this email is already a novella.... BUT! I found love in a martini glass and an orange speedo... and driving an ambulance. I wanted.  three. beautiful men. one parade.   I think beautiful men should parade in front of me EVERY day.   All in all, a good pride day and we all had fun... except Mike who was a little hung over and sat in a store front, pretending NOT to be homeless until finally he gave up and went back to my apartment while we watched gay people strut down Yonge St.  We met up with my cousin, his friends, we walked around, we got pizza... It was time for a nap!   And..... WE're going out AGAIN! Sunday night, we headed out into the masses of people to Tango's!! Lesbian bar, extrodinaire.. We wait in Line... Cocoa shows up, and she's the screaming image of little miss shawl... with just a hint of shoulder! ;) Bryce and friends arrive, and we're all set to get in. We meet a cute couple in line... a straight boy and his gf... dont ever ASK what happend with them later... All I'm saying is, the straight bf says that if he wants it rough, he goes to Chris and if he wants it passionate and sensual he goes to me... and his girfriend just watched.   okay no, I made out with her too, I felt bad.   Chris and I got hammered again. There was a boy with Mike in Zebra Pants... who we HATED! lol... if one more person tells me that I should be a drag queen, I'm gonna puke. I KNOW ! I'm PRETTY.... just tell me that, dont delve into how i should actually be a woman. I'm a man. I like my penis. If i chose to be a drag queen, I'll let you know. Actually, I'll let courtney know first, cause she'll be my biggest fan. She loves her drag queens.   Now. HOW We ended up leaving Tango's and going to Zippers, is BEYOND me... Had I been remotely sober, I would not have alloud this to happen, as this place is TRASH. But... we were there. I did meet a spunky drag queen who was BEAUTIFUL... she was so beautiful she calls herself a female illusionist, becuase it IS an allusion that she was actually a man... she looked like more of a woman than samantha did last year at pride...   After Zippers, I dont KNOW what happend. I honestly have NO idea. Apparently we were at Woody's again, but you could have fooled me, I thought I was unconcious. Maybe Woody's was before Zippers. Maybe I was gangbanged. I dont know. I feel like Genevieve in 11th grade.   I'm sorry honey, I love you, but come on--you were an Etard.   Either way, the night ended somehow, and I ended up back in bed.... and by bed, I mean on blankets on my floor.... sorry chris.. want another pillow?! :D   MONDAY!  (Has anyone else noticed that I'm on a bender here... It's been 4 days now, and I'm still going. )   We wake up, and feel a little less worse than we did the night before. Shower, shave and smoke, and we're on our way to Fran's for yet another good ass breakfast. mmm smoothies. Chris doesnt know what a smoothie is... but of course. I explain that to him, as well as the fact that canada DOES have islands that are part of CANADA.... it's not another country Chris, it's an island in lake Ontario.... PEI is an Island too... they're not other countries.   I think this is an appropriate time for me to mention the following:  Chris honey, I love you. You are fantastic. But... you're a little bit blonde. *Kiss*  I'm going to share with the good people the top 5 Chris Rabideau dumb ass comments: He's going to hit me for this, but you know what? I bought him Madonna tickets for his birthday and if he's mean he doesnt get to go.   5) Coata Rica... like... I dont get it? It's the Coast of What? Where's Rica?   4) Oh, You're in central america.... so where's that on the globe... like down down down under?   3) Oh look, Bag Pipes! I love Ireland!   2) Oh, Ireland, Scotland... whatever... I dont know my states!   1) I will NOT be the butt of everyone's jokes anymore... why does everyone laugh when i say butt?    I love you baby! lol    SO... On the way home from Frans for breakfast, having called in sick to work... We decided, Mike, Chris and Me... to stop by woody's for ONE drink.   ONE DRINK   it's 2pm and we sit down with our ONE drink   .............at 530pm, Mike had missed his train and was staying another day. We'd met a lovely lesbian named Cathy, who was almost bitchier than me, cute boys all around, including sean, the cool/cute guy from Belleville..... NOTE: Samantha.... remember balletboy from last pride??? where was he from??? BELLEVILLE.... I'm moving to Belleville.   So there we are still on the patio of Woody's. It's 6pm and Chris and I leave to take him to my place to get ready and pack and get his train. Mike stays with cutie Sean, who we all love and is officially added to my MSN via those cute pick up notepads at Woodys... NAME______ NUMBER______ I love the organization of gay men. Even picking up has a process.   I take chris to say our goodbyes, buy him some chocolate and watch sadly as he gets onto a train. One gay down.... one to go. He's back in 3 weeks, I'll be okay!   Oh wait... where am I going??? I have to get Mike at the bar!   8pm I arrive BACK at the bar. Lana shows up. We drink more.  Lana and I go back to get her stuff from my apartment for her to go home.  I'm wasted by 9pm   I go out with Samantha and Emily to a cool live music bar.... we drink wine.   I'm wasted.   I go back to Woody's   I'm wasted.   I drink more??   we stumble home with some new boys we met at woody's, and i finally crash with Mike and Sean at my place.   lol.... please note how they BOTH had trains to catch and missed them that night, as well as the next morning.    I'm on a BENDER....    Overall, I think it was one of the banger Pride years. I'm a tad upset at some fabulous lesbians who are not in on this email, and thus.... did not SHOW UP! Kim and Ange, though you're lovely girls.... I'm disappointed. I love you anyway, but I'm disappointed.   So to sum it all up, we close as we always do... with the covetted top ten moments of Pride 2004. It's a list that will go down in history as some of the funniest shit ever uttered.   and so it goes:    10) The Gay Ghetto... it's poverty chic. It's very zen.... and by zen I mean zer ain't nothing in zee damn plaze.   9) "Somebody get Chris some shoulderpads... he's liable to hurt himself." ".... actually, I think he needs kneepads. "   8) "Where's Carly?.... oops"   7) Bomber Jacket Baby... DangerShark and Jawbreaker prevail. It's the only reason I'm forgiving them for being MIA on saturday.   6) Chris learns geography: We dont know how he graduated highschool.... but he claims it was legit.   5) Fran's restaurant.... " excuse me, do you have any frozen margaritas? I'm on a bender.... thanks "   4) Black Eyed Peas.     3) "let's go have one quick drink before the train....."   2) Any excuse for Paul to dance circles around you, will be taken.   1) PAT BENETAR?!??!?!?!?!?!?????!!!!!!!   There are two things I want to do before I close this LONG email. First thank all of those who read the whole damn thing, which is not many I'm sure. Genevieve.. you're one of them, and I love you for it. you're my #1 fruit fly and I was so sad you werent here with me. Jeffrey, you MAY have read this far, and if so, you love me more than I thought.... lol. I miss you too, and will see you soon.   Lastly, I think the kids involved in pride desrve a round of applause. Or at least their livers do...  Samantha and Emily... I love you both.  Mike... you could not be a nicer guy. We require more gay between us, I've said this many times.  Lana... I love... let's sing my immortal ONE more time.  Chris... what can I say? I love you! you're cute and funny and sweet and just the right amount of naive. Happy Birthday, baby!    Until next time,  keep fit, and have gay   love always,
