        Woke up at like 11 30 and got me sum fucking Hardees, hells yea!!! Bad part of today, I had to do a shitload of house work, I cut the grass, cleaned the kitchen, cleaned my room, washed my clothes, and vaccuumed the living room. I got all that done in 2 and a half hours, believe it or not. Then found out that my partner in crime, the natester, has returned, but I hear he cut all his hair off, so I can't wait to see that, thats gonna be funny to see him with short hair. hahahaha im laughing already. After that I went over to Christys much like I always do. Calie was there which was cool, cuz I hadn't seen her in forever. I forgot how fun she was to hang with. I stayed over ther till maybe 10, they were trying to get me to bake stuff, and that wasn't gonna happen. I mean my cooking is the shit, I just didn't wanna make anything. Damn I'm doing alot of stuff tomorrow, well I'm trying to. I have to go to a wedding and to Christy's moms birthday party (cuz their parties are the shit). Maybe it doesn't sound like alot to u but it is dammit. I just heard this super kick ass song on mtv, its some old song by new edition called cool it now, that songg is the shizznit!!! but alls i know is that I miss my Dani and can't wait until she gets home. I love ya!! well thats about peace bitches.

        Yo Yo Yo, putting a wrap on this day. Twas a pretty good day...haha i said twas, im so fucking awesome. Well I got to hang with my buddy Christy for the first time in a looong time. I had a pretty good time, gohnzilla, for all who don't know is this chick that lives near Christy, and lets just say she gets around, and has probably contracted a number of STD's including gohnoria hence the name, gohnzilla. Well anyways she was there and a who shit load of other people. I got my class schedule today, and I'm soo pissed that I'm stuck with that damn Mrs. Chamberlin again this year. I hate her so much, she's the bitchiest bitch in bitch town. Man o man i LOVE Aqua Teen Hunger Force, just thought I should add that. My bestest Danielle is gone on her 8 day trip to Puerto Rico, I miss her already, I love ya!!!!! and you better bring me something bitchin' back, oh yea and my green die, that is if you wants those buttons and patches. mwahahahaha. well I'm of to bed full day of nothing to do tomorrow. peace

        Hey Hey ya bastards. Its the one and only T to tha R to tha.... well fuck it u know this is. well, This is the first of what i am sure will be the worlds shortest blog. if i keep this going for longer than a week and a half, it will have exceeded my expectations by a week and a half. so anywayz, where to start....today was possible the worst day, only because i fell asleep at midnight then woke up at 3 in the morning with the worst case of insomnia ever, didn't fall back asleep until 7, so needless to say i'm tired as shit!! I am so damn glad to be home from my grandmas, 6 days of no cable is enough to drive a guy insane, but i did get some awesome new clothes so it wasn't all bad. Oh yea, and i finally got the Aqau Teen Hunger Force volume 1 &amp; 2, I'm watching them now, this show is the shizz-nite just like me. uuh well i got alot to say but im going over to my bestest friend Christy's house to chill with her ( im soo happy shes back), and to get my free ride hahahaha. Danielle ur my bestest friend too, and I wish u the best of luck with your husbands ryan key and joel madden, and your kids daniella key ryan madden joel, Fred, and Julius Ceasar Jr. If those fellas don't work out for ya i'm here. well im outtie 5000 for now. Peace.
