      *This review if for those people who have read the Dark Tower series.  If you havn't read the series, this review will not make a lick of sense.  All I can say at this point is to read the series.*   The Dark Tower Series is about to end.  Song of Susannah is a speed bump. Don't get me wrong, I like the book.  I just couldn't picture why it came out as it's own book instead of a part of one of the other-books in the series.  Yes, you could argue that 413 pages constitutes a novel (I'm currently reading The Taking by Dean Koontz that clocks in at 338 pages), but, this is   King  we're talking about!  This man is to horror what James A Michener is to historical fiction.  A lenghty novelist.  Not that it's a bad thing.  Hell, we love it! Otherwise, why do we come back to him when we read other horror novels? Getting back to Song of Susannah.... The title character is about to give birth to her chap.   Her Ka-tet goes on a desperate search and rescue mission for her, interrupting their quest to reach the Dark Tower.  Though Eddie Dean (Susannah's husband)assumes that he'll be one of the travellers to be the one that will bring Susannah back, ka intervenes and he enters a different timeline, along with the series' main protagonist, Roland.  They arrive in Maine in 1977 and encounter Stephen King. Yes, King writes himself into the story. Meanwhile, Jake and Callahan(he appeared in Salem's Lot) appear in another timeline.  They eventually enter a strip club where Susannah is about to give birth...A gun fight ensues... The book, needless to say, ends on a cliffhanger. The story is great, but my main complaint is involved with the   selling of the story.  It's printed on that damn photo-album-picure-book-page with large script.  Makes it seem bigger than it is. This whole book could have been a huge chapter in another book. Even though I'm complaining, I appreciate that King wrote the book.  I totally love the series.   How much  credit  does this guy really get for his stories?  For every   The   Mangler and   Maximum   Overdrive, there are Shawshank Redemption and Stand by Me. I can't wait for the last book in the series...yet I'm sad it's finishing. Will King write another book?

       “I have nipples Focker, can you milk me?”  , Robert DeNiro to Ben Stiller in Meet the Parents  Right now, comic books are the hot property that are being adapted into movies.  I'm actually loving this trend because I'm a comic book junkie.  I can't get enough of them.  However, with the exception of Superman 1 and 2, Hellboy, and the X-Men movies, Hollywood never seems to want to stay totally true to the comic book.  Here are some examples:  Superman 3:  Richard Pryor comedy.    Batman and Robin and Batman Forever:  Nipples?!  The Hulk:  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Hulk.  More father/son angst and less Hulk.  I like Ang Lee, but he was the wrong director for this film.  Daredevil:  Good movie (I don't care what the other online critics say), but why-oh-why was he leaping across buildings like Spiderman?  His super human powers involved his senses, not his physical prowess.  Spiderman:  Another good movie, but what was up with him shooting webs out of his wrist instead of a webslinger?  What was James Cameron thinking when he initially wrote that synopsis?  Punisher:  Florida?!  The Punisher belongs in New York...not Florida!  Yes, the above are nitpicks, however I can never understand why Hollywood doesn't stay true to the comic it's adapting with minor exceptions, such as the X-Men movies when it comes to the costumes.  The actors would look a little silly wearing spandex...except for Hallie Berry... Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the efforts that are being made to getting comic books adapted into movies.  Comic books, to me, are an unappreciated medium.  When most people think of comic books, they tend to think of Spiderman, The Hulk, and Daredevil.  Who thinks of The Watchmen by Alan Moore, Sandman by Neil Gaiman, and Maus:  A Survivor's Tale by Art Spiegleman? I just wish that the movies were more faithful to their source comic and that the producers trusted their core audience more.

      The movie was finally released on dvd and I saw it a couple nights ago...the first time I saw it in a couple years. A couple things that stood out:   - The little girl with the red coat (one of the few times Spielberg let's color leak into the black and white movie). - Amon Goeth casually shooting a Jew from his aerie home. - The little boy running from the train and hiding in sewage underneath the latrine, being told by another hider to find another place. - Ishtak Stern's insistence that the list is good. - Oskar Schindler's apology to the Jews at the end of the movie for not doing more. - The freed Jews who wonder where to go and the Russian soldier that suggests a nearby town. - The Schindler Jews who visit Schindler's grave at the end of the movie.   Wow! This, along with Saving Private Ryan, is one of my favorite movies.  Spielberg miraculously was able to display a message of hope and goodwill around a landscape of horror and cruelty.   The list is life.  All around it's margins lie the gulf.

      Recently watched dvds:   The Fog of War-  I like Robert Macnamara.  I don't totally buy into all his beliefs, but I do admire his vision of what should have/could have been.  Great interview!   Big Fish-  Good movie.  Good message...er...nothing memorable about it otherwise.   Triplets of Bellville- Friggin' weird. I love the music.   The Last Samurai- Dances with Samurais.   Frankenstein-  Boris Karloff deserved an Academy Award, even if it was for a lifetime achievement or something.   Dracula- Movie sucked, Lugosi was great.  Read the book.  Argue with me.

      Everybody has their favorite two-types-of-people-list.  You may argue you don't, but c'mon.... Mine is Army of Darkness. You like it or you don't. It is a cheeseball movie that doesn't aspire to the greatness of Citizen Kane or any of the Godfather movies.  The biggest name actor in it is Bruce Campbell.  At that time, his biggest hot topic on his resume was Evil Dead 1 and 2. Army of Darkness is an early Sam Raimi movie (He went on to be a big A-List director of A Simple Plan, For Love of the Game, The Gift, and Spiderman. I love Army of Darkness as much, if not more, than any of his A-List movies. Bubba Ho-Tep.... Bubba Ho-Tep is an Army of Darkness type of movie.  Cheeseball almost all the way. Imagine Army of Darkness where some of the characters have dramatic moments where they share their life regrets with us. Now for the absurd.... The plot of Bubba Ho-Tep consists of the fact that Elvis Pressley didn't die, but actually switched with one of his impersonaters.  He eventually ends up in a rest home in East Texas, an embittered old man wrestling with a cancerous growth on his, well... By the way, did I mention this was a vulgar story? Moving on to even the more absurd....   There is a mummy that is stealing the souls of the retirement home residents.  Elvis' only ally is an elderly black man (Ossie Davis http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001115/) who believes he is JFK and that the CIA  dyed his skin after he was shot and filled his head with sand. It, somehow, against all the odds, works.   The movie is based on the self-titled story by Joe Lansdale.  I've read the short story and it's a very faithful adaptation.  Honestly, one of the best adapted stories I've seen as a movie.  He's one of my favorite authors, but he's not one that everyone will take to.  For one thing, his writing is very vulgar and some of it comes across in the movie.  It earns it's 'R' rating. But there's nothing overbearing in it.   I've described to you an absurd plot of a movie that sounds comparable to Plan Nine From Outer Space.  I'm going on the record that this is one of the best movies I've seen this year. - Elvis' regrets concerning his family. - Ossie Davis alone as JFK (look at his mannerisms).   I wouldn't be surprised if you looked at me as if I'm a jackass, but compare the acting to most of the crap coming out this year.  (Yeah, the Anubis bug looked like a rubber bug pulled on a string....but the budget was only 5 million for the whole movie).   I saw Schindler's List the other night and marveled at the film(and was weepy-eyed a little).   I saw Bubba Ho-Tep tonight and laughed at the absurdity of it all and was astounded at the profoundness of a couple of key scenes.   You accept the movie or you don't.

      I finally saw the movie today and figured I'd pipe in with my opinion, being as how I did so previously for American Splendor. Overall, I thought it was a great movie and that Mr. Gibson had real guts getting the movie made.   The good:  I loved the flashbacks involving Jesus and Mary.  The most touching flashback was when she runs to her fallen child as the present day Jesus falls while carrying the cross.  I also loved the character of Pontius Pilate and how he wasn't a totally evil character.  Who's to say what's historically accurate about the movie, but I thought the portrayel of his character was a nice touch. The negative:  I didn't think Satan fit into the movie.  Every time I saw him, I was reminded of Gollum because of his general appearance.  The whole 'Satan' bit could have been excised from the movie without affecting the story.  It added nothing to the movie.  However, as a caveat, judging by the scenes Mr. Gibson filmed involving Satan, I can see him directing a very scary horror movie.  That is if it's his cup of tea. My eyes did mist up during the flogging and cruxification scenes.  It wasn't so much because of what Jesus was going through so much as knowing that he was going through these ordeals for our sins. Do I think it's the best movie of the year?  Considering it's March 7...yes.  However, I'm doubtful it will be my favorite by years end.  I'm really looking forward to the next Pixar movie called The Incredibles. I'm also looking forward to Schindler's List coming out this Tuesday on dvd.  That and Futurama Season 3.  :)

      Maybe because of insomnia or what have you, but I totally fell in love with American Splendor.  I just got finished watching this movie.  I started at 3:30am.  At the beginning I was checking my watch, but I slowly gave into the movie.  Forget Sean Penn and Bill Murray...Paul Giamatti deserves Best Actor.  He won't get it and this great movie won't get recognized, which is a shame.  Maybe it's because I'm old now, but I'm falling in love with non-'effects' movies again.  Lost in Translation, now this.  Do yourself a favor and give this movie a shot...this and Lost in Translation.  I'll be more than happy if Return of the King wins Oscars during the next cermony, but I'll feel the same way if Lost in Translation and/or American Splendor wins the same. I felt the need to share...that's how strongly I felt about the movie experience.

      Why didn't this&nbsp;win any Academy Awards?  The Station Agent is by far one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.&nbsp;  Peter Dinklage plays Finbar (Finn) McBride.&nbsp; He's a drawf (you'll remember him from Elf).  Most movies would make his character a caricature of small people.&nbsp; However, the movie treats him with respect.&nbsp; The only time is size is pointed out is by the local town people of Newfoundand, NJ.  Finn loves trains.&nbsp; They're his hobby.&nbsp; He works in a model train store, putting toy trains together along with the owner, Henry Styles, played by Paul Benjamin.&nbsp; My God is his voice fascinating!&nbsp; It's so deep and soulful!&nbsp; Like hearing Darth Vader reading beatnik poetry at a Berkeley cafe in 1969.  I digress.  Styles dies and leaves Finn a train station located in Newfoundland, New Jersey.&nbsp; It's out in the middle of nowhere and that's how Finn likes it.&nbsp; You see, Finn likes his solitude.&nbsp; He's a laconic man with little to say.&nbsp; Most young directors would turn this character into a screaming caricature if&nbsp;the character's&nbsp;solitude was intruded upon, but this movie refuses to insult the audience's intelligence.&nbsp; Though quiet, when approached by someone, he opens up...just a little.&nbsp; You get the sense that he just wants to be let alone.&nbsp; Yet he secretely yearns for companionship.&nbsp;  He gets companionship in the forms of Joe Caramas (Bobby Cannavale) who runs a roving diner and Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson) who almost runs him over on one of his many walks.&nbsp;  Joe is fascinated by Finn, but not because he's a drawf.&nbsp; He's just fascinated because someone has moved into the train station where his diner is parked most times.  Olivia is fascinated by Finn because, well, he's nice.  There's a scene where a beautiful woman, played by Michelle Williams, subtly flirts with him.&nbsp; Not to mock him, but because she  does  find him attractive.&nbsp; Finn is a nice man.  Personally, I'd be very surprised if Peter Dinklage doesn't have a girlfriend or wife.&nbsp; I can actually see women falling for him.  He's initially resistant to the people he meets, but soon warms to them.&nbsp; When a crisis happens in the movie, he suddenly cuts himself off to his friends.  My favorite part of the movie is near the end where he sits despondent in the bar.&nbsp; He notices people looking at him because of his short stature.&nbsp; Hell, he's noticed them all his life but chose being alone because of them.  In a fit of rage and fury, he drunkenly stands on the bar counter and yells out, "HERE I AM,&nbsp;TAKE A LOOK!"  Peter Dinklage deserved an Academy&nbsp;Award for his role.&nbsp; Not for playing a dwarf.  For playing a decent human being.&nbsp;

      Batman:&nbsp; The Animated Series-I totally love the series!&nbsp; The artwork is fantastic and the story sometimes stays truer than the comic book series it's adapting.&nbsp; That and that tv show.&nbsp; Makes me feel like slamming a 2X4 against Adam West *Just kidding!&nbsp; Meant Burt Ward!*  &nbsp;  Tokyo Godfathers-What a beautiful anime!&nbsp; The typical John Q Public figure thinks of anime as robot monsters and vampires.&nbsp;&nbsp; I challenge anime fans to&nbsp;watch this movie and Grave of the Fireflies.&nbsp;&nbsp;A good movie shouldn't&nbsp;be judged whether or not it's live-action or animated.&nbsp; It should be judged by the story and how it's presented.  &nbsp;  The Wolfman:&nbsp; The Legacy Collection:&nbsp; Nobody can do angst like Lon Chaney.&nbsp; I'm a sucker&nbsp;for that time-lapse-werewolf-changing-effect.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I have a revolving list of favorite comedies.  The list is currently composed of:  A Fish Called Wanda, National Lampoon's Animal House, National Lampoon's Vacation, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, The Blues Brothers, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Monty Python's Life of Brian, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, Young Frankenstein, and Blazing Saddles. I do have a favorite comedy, but it always changes depending upon my mood. Today, it's Blazing Saddles. I recently watched the 30th anniversary dvd and was once again sucked into the movie.  What first struck me about the movie was how   undated   it was.  The comedy of the movie can easily compete against the comedy of any typical Farrelly brother's movie.  In fact, for a movie that uses the dreaded   n   word a lot, there's very little vulgarity.  Two of the raciest moments that come to mind are when Bart says, "Excuse me while I whip this out", causing a gasp from the crowd around him and when Lili Von Shtupp later says to Bart in the darkened bedroom, "Is it twue what they say about you people?"  You hear a zipper opening followed momentarily by, "IT'S TWUE!  IT'S TWUE!" The plot involves trying to get the town ruined so that a railroad can run through the land.  The two protagonists planning this are Gov. William J. LePetomaine played by the director, Mel Brooks, and Hedley Lamarr played by the great Harvey Korman.  There's a running joke throughout the movie where he keeps being called Hedy (like the famous movie star) and he constantly answers back, "That's   Hedley  !" Let's get back to that   n   word.  Despite it's heavy usage, the movie actually shows us how wrong and stupid racism is.  It mocks the people of Rockridge who look down upon their new black sheriff, but without actually demeaning them.  If a director made a movie like this today, it would show the black sheriff as being above the white town folk.  Though Blazing Saddles shows the sheriff making some remarks about the people's ignorance, it doesn't demean them in any way.  In fact, with the help of the sheriff's former railroad workers (from his previous job), blacks and whites work together to save the town of Rockridge from an outlaw mob led by Hedley Lamarr. The climatic fight scene between the good guys and bad guys goes so over the top that they actually leave the movie itself and enter another Warner Brother's studio where a musical is being filmed.  Soon after, you have cowboys and gay dancers involved in the melee that quickly spreads outside the studios.   Mel Brooks was clearly having fun with the movie. So was I.
