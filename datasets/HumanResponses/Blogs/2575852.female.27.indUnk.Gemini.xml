      "An orange on the table, your dress on the rug, and you in my bed, sweet present of the present, cool of night, warmth of my life."     Jacques Prevert 1900-1977   ---  Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety. Other women cloy the appetites they feed, but she makes hungry where most she satisfies.    William Shakespeare

      --------------o00o-----------@-u-@-----------o00o---------------  It is a pleasant thing to reflect upon, and furnishes a complete answer to those who contend for the gradual degeneration of the human species, that every baby born into the world is a finer one than the last. Charles Dickens  ---------------0-----------------------------------0----------------   Sometimes Queens think about their heir to the throne. They reflect upon their biological clocks, hear the sweet gurgle of a happy cherub in a courtier's arms, smell custard and honey in their lusty squalls. And their minds wander while looking out the towers, dreaming of holding an infant who carries their features, their personalities, a child in their image. Sometimes a Queen yearns, yet she speaks not of her yearnings to her court advisors or handmaidens. Who knew, there would be a reason to have a King, there is a purpose after all.

          What torments my soul is its loneliness. The more it expands among friends and the daily habits or pleasures, the more, it seems to me, it flees me and retires into its fortress. The poet who lives in solitude, but who produces much, is the one who enjoys those treasures we bear in our bosom, but which forsake us when we give ourselves to others. When one yields oneself completely to one's soul, it opens itself to one, and then it is that the capricious thing allows one the greatest of good fortunes... that of sympathizing with others, of studying itself, of painting itself constantly in its works.    EugFne Delacroix --  You cannot be lonely if you like the person you're alone with.   Simplicity in it's most direct and accurate point. Queens go through periods of contemplating their reign over their Minions. We sit high on our jewel encrusted throne, raised above the levels the court attendants sit. We sleep on a raised platform, upon which a large and high bed of the best quality is placed. when we fall asleep, we look out the window, see the moon almost level to it and softly sigh. We awaken to the clouds circling our very high tower, sunbeams kissing our cheeks from up close, or harshly burning us, I have yet to know. Why, not even birds dare fly so high. We look out daily from that window and see our realm, see the winding rivers toward the ocean, the little cottages with whispers of smoke coming out their chimneys - likely where our 'simple' minions break their fast with their loved ones. We see the warriors in their daily routines and exercises, and the unmarried women crowded around watching in awe, lust and dreamy eyed. We look to the sky and see beyond the blue curtain to the darker one behind it, stars that still shine brightly, planets that still continue to spin, that require our ruling, we sometimes wonder if the other Queen can see us..for surely her tower is as high. We turn away, don our royal garb, heavy with it's richness of material and duties that are surely as embedded as the sapphires, diamonds and various riches. We hold our head high, we paste a demure yet predatory smile on our face, worthy of our status and intentions. We stand proudly in our courts and rule to the best of our abilities.  We are Queens. This is our lot in life and that is it's flow. We are alone, yet do not feel loneliness....for company.   I am, Your Queen.  And that which makes me so, must be respected.

      I am your anointed Queen. I will never be by violence constrained to do anything. I thank God I am endued with such qualities that if I were turned out of the Realm in my petticoat I were able to live in any place in Christendom.  Elizabeth 1  --------------  I realize in my efforts to send messages to my Minions, I am a warrior Queen. I want to rule with both a titanium fist and knowing heart - if such a thing exists. During my daily ablutions in satisfying the many demands of my realm, I also strive to find that one person that can occupy the empty seat to my right. I search for A King, worthy of not only my Multiverse...but me.   As Shakespeare said - Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

        I want to feel illusion    The restless mind knows the heights of every emotion, good and bad. It yearn simply to rest. To cast off it's musings, analysis, theories, planning, guarding and protecting of other precious organs. To simply...exist, with no expectations, no real use, no hopes and oh god, no dreams.   Standing tall in my heightened tower, silently I stare out at the winding river pouring into the vast ocean. Methinkst tis time this Queen set sail on an empty ocean, bound for a destiny I care not to think about. To just...not think, not dream, not dare, not hope, not do anything but vacuously smile.   Blissful unawareness...take me I'm yours.

      I dreamt  him  last night in a vivid and scary way for the first time ever. Since his death, I havent dreamt him in this manner and I cannot help but wonder what warning he's sending me. Queens dreaming of their former Kings is terribly Shakespearian, I know, however one cannot help but sit up and take notice when a former love comes bringing message.   Especially when he's singing songs to you...in a most insistant way. Allow me to share since I love typing and need the precious moments to process.    I would die for you, I would die for you I've been dying just to feel you by my side, to know that you're mine  I would cry for you, I would cry for you I will wash away your pain with all my tears, I'm drowning on fear  I will pray for you, I will pray for you I will sell my soul for something pure and true, for someone like you  See your face every place that I walk in Hear your voice every time that I'm talkin You will believe in me, and i will never be ignored.  I will burn for you, Feel pain for you I will twist the knife and bleed my achig heart, and tear it apart.  I will lie for you, beg and steal for you I will crawl on hands and knees until you see, you're just like me  Violate all the love that I'm missin' Throw away all the pain that I'm livin' You WILL believe in me, and I can never be ignored.  I would die for you, I would kill for you I will steal for you, I'd do time for you I will wait for you, I'd make room for you I'd sink ships for you, Take the cross for you Make me a part of you, Because I believe in you I believe in you I would die for you   -------------------------- And the song that really scared me to hear even though that's hard to top the previous one....   Lay beside me Tell me what they've done Speak the words I wanna hear To make my demons run The door is locked now But it's open if you're true If you can understand the me,  Then I can understand the You.   Lay beside me Under wicked sky The black of day Dark of night We share this paralyze The door cracks open But there's no sun shining through Black heart scarring darking still But there's no sun shining through no thee's no sun shining through No there's no sun shining.   What I've felt What I've known Turn the pages, Turn the stone Behind the door, Should I open it for you?  What I've felt, What I've known Sick and Tired, I stand alone Could you be there,  Cause i'm the one who waits for you Or are you unforgiven too?  Come lay beside me This won't hurt I swear She loves me not,  She loves me still  But she'll never love again She lay beside me But she'll be there when I'm gone Black heart scarring darker still Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone Dead sure she'll be there  Lay beside me Tell me what I've done The door is closed, so are your eyes But now I see the sun Now I see the sun Yes, now I see it.   Oh what i've felt what i've known Turn the pages, turn the stone Behind the door  Should I open it for you? So i dub thee unforgiven  Oh, what i've felt, Oh, what I've known I take this key  And I bury it in you Because you're unforgiven too  Never free Never me Cause you're Unforgiven too.   -----------------------------------  apprehension thy name is Migalito and I am wary of the coming day.

       One friend in a lifetime is much, two are many, three are hardly possible. Friendship needs a certain parallelism of life, a community of thought, a rivalry of aim.  ---------  Treat your friends as you do your pictures, and place them in their best light.  Jennie Jerome Churchill   --------  To the smallest scattering of those I consider my true friends ... I keep a flame lit in my heart in homage. Thank you for my sanity (or lack thereof), my soul and my reason. A Queen is only as great as her advisors and subjects, upon reflection to my life and what's gotten me here, I am truly amazed I am the person I am. I cannot take credit for it all, to he who has perished but left me his wise, loving words and thoughts, to those who remain to bare my tantrums and ramblings and finally even to those who have betrayed me...they all make me what I am, who I am.   And they've all helped prepare me to accept the next path in my life, the evolution of a persona.   This Queen bows most humbly to you - my Liege, my Giggling Accomplice, my Angel, my Adventuress and most recently (a pleasant and surprising one) my Dragonboy.   You are my reasons.  I owe you awe.

      A note on the wonders of human emotion, hope, love, peace, heritage.  The scope turns to India...long have I warred with pride and shame of where this Queen was molded - however indirectly. At long last, the dawn breaks on the horizon of my mind and Pride, deeply embedded in there somewhere, has come to the forefront.  What started this you may ask? One of my historian channels reported to me, and I've seen and heard things on the Taj Mahal, perhaps hundreds of times. But for some reason today, I took notice and what I saw made me feel incredibly close to the great hearts of history. Hearing it makes me feel that it's true - you cannot describe it unless you see it reflected off the teardrop of a lover's cheek as they gaze in amazement. Shah Jahan was declared insane by his own son and locked away, where he pined forever, obsessed over his young bride's premature death. His every breath was steeped in the intoxication of his love for his wife and to see the Taj mahal to completion and hope it could but reflect a small amount of the essence that made her special to him. His last breath was taken gazing at a building that didnt come close to glorious wonder that was his young love. Across the way was the building his mother, Lul Jahan, built for her parents...the first structure in marble. The lattice screens were all carved from a single slab ..never joined, gems were brought in to complete the intricacy of the fantastic building as a testament to the love she bore her parents. Is there any other more hopeful wonder in this world for those who have none? It's a timeless tribute to love in it's purest and diverse forms, for that of a child, parent, friend, kindred soul or deeply spun true love.   Then there is Rishikesh..land of the Gurus, nestled amoung the trees near the foothills of the Himalayas on the banks of a flowing holy River. Beyond it's temples...in Masuri..8000 ft high, rooftop to the world they say, and AT the foothills of the Himalayas. I want to walk through it's peaceful grounds and cemetary that attests the presence of men and women, fallen in previous battles, childbirth or simply to go in peace, gazing at the wonder of the world. These women were placed with honour to lie amoung the men, not cast out because they were unclean, unpure etc. There has got to be something in it, if so many have returned to this holy place to cleanse themselves and stay..to die. To stand above the world, as high as they dare...and finally let go.   There is also a school there, a fantastic school I never knew existed...called Woodstock, it houses children from all over the world. it's a requirement that there are equal numbers from major countries so the children leave with a better knowledge of India, other cultures, and themselves. They are students most readily accepted into Universities, who cling to their teachers crying when time for them to go. They talked...at ages 12-16, of how at peace they are there, how their mornings greet them with the best sunrises, sounds of nature, purity. Their days carry them in the presence of constant learning from their teachers and peers alike, cultural differences united under one roof, one classroom, and above all...understood, accepted. They have no technologies (as yet) and they bond so strongly that countries seperate them but communication never breaks down. This school deserves our respect...and our support.   This is ...wonderful. True hope for the youth of our future - oh if only they outnumbered the rest.  But even one tiny pebble in the ocean that surrounds us..will make thousands of ripples. Let's just hope those children cast their pebbles to save us all.

       If we had a reliable way to label our toys good and bad, it would be easy to regulate technology wisely. But we can rarely see far enough ahead to know which road leads to damnation. Whoever concerns himself with big technology, either to push it forward or to stop it, is gambling in human lives.   -----------  It is astounding the many levels of intellects that exists around us. Every day I am amazed by what the Minions in my realm have invented. The potential for growth and infamy in new inventions is both incredibly positive and horrendously, terrible. It's a point well observed many times - with the usefulness of one invention comes the possible raping of an ocean to get it, or the death of a species. It is after all, still greatness, no matter what the results - whether siamese twins may live as two instead of one or a radiation that can kill for decades to come with a mere lingering whiff.   Think of all the genius criminals in the prisons or free, right now...they're brilliant in their minds, their abilities to evade justice, to close in on a prey and effectively shut the trap. They truly are 'mentally ill' in terms that they do not follow the norm, and yes, they do take lives which isn't good, but you cannot deny, their minds...dangerously different as they may be...are simply astounding. What does it say to us as a society, as a mass group of beings that we do not somehow learn anything from this. I believe it was Thomas Harris, using the voice of Dr. Hannibal Lecter that said the most intriguing and true thing along the lines of - what use have I for society when a useful society would either kill me or put me to some use?  I think I'd be one of those Queens who hire and use an entirely criminally brilliant group of individuals but be prepared for them to rally against me. After all, true evil genius seeks to be greatness on their own.   I do love this particular planet Earth, it's inhabitants are so simply complicated. And only on this planet could that sentence make perfect sense.  I think I'll stick around a while...I've observed from afar...time to mix things up.

        In bed my real love has always been the sleep that rescued me by allowing me to dream   Luigi Pirandello (Italian Author)  --    Deep into that darkness peering,  Long I stood there, wondering fearing,  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal  ever dared to dream before.    Edgar Allan Poe  ------------   Perhaps the most true and false words ever spoken is in one simple sentence by an animated cricket, "When your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme." Such an idealistic thought could only be pulled off by a cricket that sings n talks, but what of us?   Sometimes the greatness I achieve only happens in my dreams, when I exist in a realm unlike my own. My deepest fears come charging to the forefront like stallions racing across the plains. My joys are enhanced 1000 times over and over again, like the breaking morning sun rays through the clouds that caress me with it's gentle warmth, then dazzles me with it's full brilliance. My woes, joys, hopes and desires intermingle with each other in a merry meshing of emotions that dare not express themselves in the waking state. Emotions wash over me, almost pleasantly drowning me, starting off as the lightest sprinkle of a summer's rain - warm breezes and cooling droplets..reflective, romantic. It escalates into a springtime shower...constant, fragrant, filling my senses with the hope and vitality of all things living regenerating themselves, new things to come. At it's climax...when the emotions are at its most potent and dangerous...are those raging storms - rain assaults me from all angles, filling me with an urgency, a warning of things to come. A slow rumble builds in the clouds of my mind, overshadowing all other things...awareness, sizzling excitement in it's headiest sense. Thunder roars out, starting at a slow, quiet purr and advancing with the deep intensity of a dark pouncing panther. Electrical static invades the air, crackling with life yet threatening the end of it. Lightening bolts snake across the dark skies, reaching with glaringly hot fingers, burning all in it's grasp, heightening my entire being to a state beyond words. I am challenged at that point with facing my hopes... what I most desire...in it's subconscious form. I'm enticed because it's forbidden, my sensuality manifests itself in every look, touch, sound and body. I wait for the quiet I know is coming, my opportunity...my chance to shout out in my dreaming state what I wouldn't in my waking. I take a deep breath, smelling the anticipation, the woody scents, the heady smells of crushed flora, I hear the thunder sounding very much like the waves beyond me..crashing on the rocks, the lightening illuminating in quick flashes my domain of possibilities before me, showing me everything within my grasp. Everything around me roaring and moving with an unspoken haste, daring me, urging me to be one with them. I shout out my deepest desires...spread my arms wide and give myself up to the elements, feel myself falling, drops bounce off me, wind goes through me....yet clouds lift me, lightening surrounds me, thunder within me.  I become a storm personified.   And then I awaken, leaving the storm to wreak havoc in my mind...lightening like spikes of uncertainty, thunder rolling through me as fear and rain drops drowning me in confusion.   To dream a dream that never lies,  To face the demons in their eyes  To defy the nature of the beast  Oh when will these thoughts cease.

      to sleep perchance to dream....nay such dreams are oft disguised as pleasantries but live in you as the most cruel hoax. I know not when my missing blog will turn up, perhaps taken into the realm from whence it was inspired.   I live to learn and learn to live with what I must.   Queen...Ruler...I make mistakes, yet none so large as underestimating my subconscious.

       No one need think that the world can be ruled without blood. The civil sword shall and must be red and bloody.  ------  All Queens have their little quirks that are a must in their court. Some require a certain colour to never be worn by anyone but her, or the tables laden with only the finest of a specific type of food. This Queen requires Pommegranite at its ripest form. Their deep, blood red fleshy seeds gleam with a dark juice waiting to burst out of it's thin membranous casing. I want to see bowls of the seeds on my tables, glistening in the candlelight like little blood cells. I want to watch people eat it, watch their teeth bite into the tiny kernels and see the drops of the red juices drip across their lips and trickle down their mouths. I want to delve my hands deep in the bowls and feel all the cells burst in my hands, glorify in the pool of sweet, sticky bloodlike nectar. I want to feed it to one of my warrior minions, my mouth full of seeds, locking with his lips in a syrupy, juicy kiss, draw back and watch the trails as they make a bloody path down his throat. I want to lick and bite along that trail, sucking every drop of the truly wonderfully sweet yet tart pommegranite juice. When I cut into it, the sliced seeds bleed their ruby juices and coat the blade, looking dangerously akin to that of a recently used weapon with murderous end.   It fascinates me.  It intrigues me It excites me It empowers me  It is a source of extreme pleasures and desires alike. Do try it.

       Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a Queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Tempestuous as the sea, and stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me and despair!   --------  What lies in the depth of man's soul I wonder? What drives us - man, woman, beast - to do the various things we do, both humane and horrendous. What makes us crave attention yet shy away from those who seek to delve further? We constantly search for some sort of completion, some peace, some task that makes us feel whole inside. We look toward the sunrise and make a promise of renewing our forms, then at sunset recall a time that made us smile or yearn for that which is to come.   We have murderers, rapists, child abusers amoung the nuns, orphanages and saints at large. We are all made of the same components yet we differ so greatly. Every day we go on, forgetting that a million different tasks are being done inside our bodies to keep us living our lives. I am a Queen, yes...but I am also like you. I am vulnerable to certain attacks or compliments. My heart may be made of ice, but it beats like yours...it yearns, like yours, it aches, like yours. My soul may be barrent and questionable at times...but it too has a validity that needs no justification. And my mind...my mind works like yours, trying to be seperate from my heart and my soul, yet failing miserably at times. It knows confusion with the element of hope, yet prepares itself for disappointment in it's sorting out process.   What I ask...is the depth of man's soul.

       All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost; the old who are strong do not whither, deep roots are not touched by the frost.   ---------------------  My adventure was one that begun with a plan that quickly went awry due to different reasons. I ended up at a giant, powerful waterfall, staring down into the swirling voids looking across at a land not yet mine, contemplating things a Queen has no right to wish for…things she cannot control. I had moments of glaring clarity that I wish could have been done in warmer places. I also faced temptation in its highest form and surprisingly, survived with a new vision, reasons re-enforced. Behold me in all my newfound splendour, goal oriented and objective fulfilled. Frozen to the spot, hanging onto a railing coated in ice formed from the mist off the falls, I saw paths that were pointed out to be a few months before in a forest nearby. I saw the road laid then, the path laid then…and I listened this time, I saw. The Queen has returned and with full force behind her. I’m just sorry I had to worry my main confidant so much, and the members of my close courtiers, but they hopefully understood it had to be done. And that I’ll always make it up to them.      Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Tempestuous as the sea, and stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me and despair!

      Today...oh today - the Queen escapes.   She's taken the opportunity of escape during a Lunar New Year celebration - year of the Monkey - to shirk her duties and responsibilities, maybe even a few days. It will be hard, the weather is cold and unforgiving, my domain is large and attached to the domain of another King and should he get wind of me on his property there will be hell and damnation to pay. However, I will stay my course, and that is evasion. The Queen's royal hypnotist had a miniature session with her and she must evade him and it's revelations at all costs.   I will record of my adventures upon my return.  God Save The Queen.

      2nd dedication to my Minions:  So in my royal chambers, listening to some music, I caught myself singing this song that I love and then listened to the lyrics as I sung it. It's phenomenal and quite applicable to most of us in whatever scenarios. This Queen had homework to do (joy) and this helped her writing streak tremendously, just singin' the song by Level 42:    How, How can it be That a love, carved out of caring Fashioned by fate Could suffer so hard From the games, Played once too often But making mistakes Is a part of Life's imperfections Born of the years is it so wrong To be human after all?  Drawn into the stream Of undefined illusion.... Those diamond dreams They can't disguise the truth That there is somethin' about you Baby, so right I wouldn't be here wihtout you baby tonight.  If ever our love Was concealed No one can say that We didn't feel  A million things And a perfect dream of life.  Gone...fragile but free We remain...tender together If not so in love And it's not so wrong We're only human after all  These changing years They add to your confusion Oh and you need to hear The time that told the truth  You know there's something about you Baby So right.... I wouldn't be here without you baby tonight.

       The Lights go out and I can't be saved Tides that I tried to swim against* Have brought me down upon my knees Oh I beg, I beg and plead...singin'  Come out of things unsaid** Shoot an apple off my head and a  Trouble that can't be named A tiger's waiting to be tamed..singing..  You Are. You Are  Confusion never stops*** Closing walls and ticking clocks Gonna come back and take you home I could not stop that you now know singing..  Come out upon my seas,  Cursed missed opportunities**** Am I a part of the cure Or am I part of the disease, singing  You are, You are, You are You are, you are, you are  And nothing else compares And nothing else compares And nothing else compares  You are You are  Home, home where I wanted to go.  --------------------- * still trying very hard ** why is silence sometimes viewed as cowardice ***End my confusions, break my walls, stop the clocks, take me home. ****An ocean of missed opportunities, can I call it an ocean with waves of regret? No. The future of opporunities missed, will be a regret.   Mayhap my daily listening of this fantastic song should cease. Then and again...mayhap not.  In regards to my writing....my impasse at a point in the story has hit this point..best expressed by Shirley Bassey.   Where do I begin? To tell a story of how great a love can be? The sweet love story that is older than the sea, the simple truth about the love he brings to me. Where do I start?

       Those who resolve to conquer or die, are rarely conquered.  Pierre Coneille **** Shakespeare:   For I am full of spirit and resolve to meet all perils very constantly...  Who is so firm that can't be seduced?  -----------------------  Never have truer or more contraditing words been spoken, ah verily Shakespeare you do justice to our lives. As Queen I must think on everything I do and how it will affect my life and those around it. I must look on my resolutions made and see if they were made in haste or with true reason. Is it so wrong to go back and amend a decision - not 'cave in' persay, but amend. if this amendment can result in extreme pleasures - though temporary and in the physical realm - is it such a bad thing to allow it to happen? Yes, the other involved can get messy, however, if prior knowledge is established that this isn't 'acquiescing' merely deciding upon a better result for all involved.   Yes, it's time to not be so strict methinkst. Accepting fate and riding it's cloud could be an adventure, until the cloud dissipates. The horrid thing is, once amending this resolution of mine...there is no going back. I feel it in my bones, this one would make the difference for a long time to come, affect my life, decisions toward it, and the type of people that will enter it hence forth. But for brief moments in time, the rain will fall, the lightening would strike, thunder would roar through me, I'd soar like a majestic bird of prey. I won't be alone.   Is it worth waiting for the 'perfect' moment or fall head first into a few mediocre ones?  Sway me to the first, oh contrary fate, for the winds of time are winning me towards the latter, towards sacrifice.

      I'd like to play in a field of fragrant blooms, lie on a mountain top overlooking the ocean in my domain, hear the waves crashing on the rocks below - read a good book, stare at the sky, hum to the droning of passing bees or birds. I'd like to lie across the rocks at the base of a waterfall and wait for rain. Trail my hands along the swirling waters and watch things float away..carefree. Run my hands along a pet black panther/leopard, feeling it's warmth and deep breaths.  I'd like to raise my hands to the sky and feel the onslaught of a ravaging storm, feel the wind whipping at my clothes, my hair, my senses. I'd love to roll down a grassy hill, dive off a cliff, sink my hands into wet sand or mud, throw pebbles across the surface of water.   I'd like to throw all colours of paints onto a canvas and run my hands through it messily. Or build my own picture from a 5000 piece puzzle, throw an arrow from the tower and try to hit a target at random. I'd love to send flowers to a girl from her beau and watch them sweetly kiss. I'd love to roam the gardens and see the young lovers secreted away telling each other their desires. I'd love to run from large tree to tree, randomly stopping to kiss one, run my hands along another. I'd like to walk the unbeaten path, venture onto paths unknown. I'd love to bake cookies and cakes with all the little tiny minion children and have a flour fight. I want to sing off key and dance to the sounds of horses running.   I want an adventure

       It matters not how straight the gate, How charged with punishment the scroll; I am the master of my fate, I am the Captain of my soul   William Ernest Henley  --------------------------------  At long last I know the author to that quote I've held dear almost all my life.  All Royalties aside and Regal duties suspended, I throw this out to the Universe which I claim rule over.   It mystified me before, does so still and more than likely will continue to all my years and the years of my hopeful future generations. We trudge along daily in our lives, affected by our own problems, and those closest to us, worried about our own heart aches and heartful joys.   When I take a look around, at others and their woes, I shed many tears for them, my heart feels like it bleeds for them, I cannot even begin to comprehend that which hasn't happened to me. I am amazed that one woman can bear so much hurt in her soul, fall inlove very deeply with an unconventional man, a former student. They face every speedbump in their life's road - prejudice, pride, disapproving glances, personal insecurities. Then to have it all taken away by an errant driver, killing the body of love about to be married, but certainly not the soul that remains in the bride left at the alter, wondering why the delay. To suffer through the days afterward, seeing remnants of him everywhere, to then find out she's pregnant...when she was previously told children wasn't possible. The joys that brought on, the heightened pleasure of knowing their love would continue on in their child. Then the heart shattering experience of losing that child, the last physical link to him. I cannot fathom how much courage it takes to go on, to breathe every morning when each breath pains your lung.   Then there are those who's single most joy is completely restored by their child, even though spouse is either gone by choice or force - woman and man alike. For men suffer deeply too, they have not the option of a small hope of a child being born after their love dies. There are those that continue on quiet easily, but then...there are those that suffer inside, being true men, never letting their pain out in the open, lest it be used against them or some weakness shown. To earn their trust is true honour, to earn a woman's trust, complete and utterly, is no easy feat given our capacity for memory.   The power of a child in this world is phenomenal. We were all one once, most will have one later, some will choose never to. Whatever reasons, a child is always a matter of thought at some point in our lives. They bring either complete love, hope and joy or a reminder of a time past. With all this...with all I know, see, feel - why on earth would I want to go through the first phase to get to the second. There are logical answers, I know this. It does make sense...I know this too.   But whoever said I had to be logical all the time?  Why can my heart not fear the onslaught it's known to come thus far?   Theories to the contrary - that the "ideal" person is the one that challenges your control - are just that. . . theories.   Oh I am the master of my fate and captain of my soul alright.

       Anticipation forms the mold  ----- As a Queen, I am sometimes privy to my pick of the warriors or whomever I choose, since I rule all i see...and beyond. There's something so wonderful in the waiting.   Anyone can see something through to completion...it takes true will power to have something pleasurable and wait. And Wait. And Wait.  I will feel it building in me, this desire, this strong, lusty pull toward the most base form of human expression. Yes, I could command someone at any moment to enter my chambers and attempt to draw forth the passion that lies just simmering below the surface. But then, only a certain type, a certain one can make me erupt so...wonderfully.   So I do what every powerful Queen does, I seek self gratification and heighten a moment that may one day come. There's alot to be said for anticipation, with everything you do.  Like my daily bath...I'll wait for the perfect moment in the day, resist the temptation to take one too soon..or too late. Just when the sun is setting, casting that lovely golden and rosy light. Candles of the finest beeswax, scented with drops of honey, are lit and surrounds my tub, filling my senses with an almost overwhelming sweetness. Steam curls above the water that's slightly infused with milk and honey. I'd let the robe slide slowly and gently to the floor, closing my eyes and feeling the cool, oh so soft material whisper past each inch of me on it's way down, getting momentarily held back by my breasts, then sliding over in a rush of freedom.   Getting in the tub, I slowly sink into the water, assisted by two handmaidens, pretty young things, into my hot, fragrant pool of bliss. letting out a sigh of utter contentment, I dismiss them, lean back slowly, feeling the water warm my already hotly aroused skin. Looking down at the alabaster water, my knees peek out, then occassionally, as I breathe deeply...my chest rises in and out of the lapping milky water. I know the guards are watching through a small knot in the wall behind the main tapestry in the bathing chambers, I've known for a while...but that enhances the performance so delightfully.  Casting a half glance over my shoulder, I reach for the cloth, pre-soaped with the finest scent - Lilly of the Valley. I start slowly rubbing it along my arms, up to my shoulders and caress my back and neck as best as I can. With a long, luxurious sigh, I drop my head back over the rim and raise my body so 'they' can get a slight view of two peaks, perked with the cool air. I run my hands and the cloth along the front of my neck and just above the chest. Eyes closed, with a half gasp on my lips, my hands run over each breast, letting the slightly rough cloth tickle at each pebbled tip, giving a slight squeeze, scooping more of the sweet water over them and taking my time to taste the finger that washed each breast.   Hearing a groan, a slow smile crosses my face as I raise my head and rise slowly until halfway out of the tub. on my knees. I reach up and let my hair fall wildly, giving it a shake, wetting the ends of each curled lock. Turning around slowly, I face the ones I know watch me, my hair framing the swell of my breasts and disappearing at the waistline where the water reaches. Lying back with a steady, sensual smile on my face, I start rubbing the cloth just under my chest, and downward to my stomach. Head lolling to the sides of my neck, I give myself up to the feel of the material tickling my stomach, yet heightening my skin to any touch it receives - be it my fingernails scraping the skin, or open palms massaging. Moving my hands below the milky water line at my waist, I open my eyes, stare directly where I know the peep hole to be, give a predatory smile and slowly, ohhh so very slowly...part my knees to either side of the tub. Hearing the breaths sharply taken in as my parting knees reveal the look on my face, I start moving my fingers which need no prodding to be told what path to walk. The pearly, sweet water making little waves in rhythm to my fingers, alternating in their teasing and stroking in the Queen's Jewel. Biting my lip to prevent a lusty groan from escaping, sucking it in, one hand trails upwards, lingers at my breast - giving it a tender caress before moving upward to my lips. The tip of a tongue darts out to lick at the juices remaining before inserting the entire finger for full tongue lashing. Throwing one leg over the rim of the tub, my body moves in an age old harmony with pleasure's greatest music, being plucked by nimble fingers on a fine instrument, my head falls back with a deep, sigh. Just as the feeling hits a chaotic crescendo, I stop my urgent fingers, my panting breath, slow my body's rhythm, bring my hands up to my lips...take a final taste before focusing on the peek hole. Giving a slow wink with a shuddering sigh at my body's still aroused state, call for my handmaidens, stand slowly and completely and glorify in the feel of their hands wrapping me in cloth and slowly rubbing me dry.  Slowly getting dressed, layer by layer, I hide my recent bout of desire, save for the evidence in my eyes, luminiscent and dancing.   Walking past the guards who look decidedly uncomfortable, I smile with satisfaction.   True power lies not only in absolute acquiescence but in she who can prolong and master the most basic of emotions that threaten to overwhelm.   I eagerly await the one who can challenge my control.  I remain...Queen - rightly so - of this Multiverse, Mistress of Lust and Sensuality.  Challenge me...I dare you!

Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying. When I was a child I had a fever My hands felt just like two balloons. Now I've got that feeling once again I can't explain you would not understand This is not how I am.  I have become comfortably numb.  O.K. Just a little pinprick. There'll be no more aaaaaaaah! But you may feel a little sick. Can you stand up? I do believe it's working, Good.  That'll keep you going through the show Come on it's time to go.   There is no pain you are receding A distant ship, smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in waves. Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.  When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse Out of the corner of my eye.  I turned to look but it was gone I cannot put my finger on it now The child is grown,  The dream is gone.  I have become....comfortably numb.

      The Queen is ill, God save the Queen.   Fear not, though she writes this with a feverish mind and wild pen (fingers) she does have clarity to recognize her enemies lurking in dark corners. They're everywhere, I see them all now - and I see them going after those I love...my confidants. They try to ruin their lives with ruining hearts and messing with minds....  They'll not take me...No...my mind is alert now, my third eye open.

       I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers, From the seas and the streams; I bear light shade for the leaves when laid In their noonday dreams. From my wings are shaken the dews that waken The sweet buds every one, When rocked to rest on their mother's breast, As she dances about the sun. I wield the flail of the lashing hail, And whiten the green plains under, And then again I dissolve it in rain, And laugh as I pass in thunder.     Percy Bysshe Shelley ------------------------------------------  How beauteous the drop that trickles down her cheek The glisten of tears unshed mingling with drops from above Why does she cry as she laughs at the skies Why does her voice carry a sad note in the happy tunes she sings?  Where doth her desires lay that I may bring them to her Where doth her heart lie that I might protect it for her Where doth her soul lay wounded that I may heal it Where doth my choices lie if she ne'er but glances my way  She is an enigma, worthy of perplexing times Her puzzle lies unsolved to even her own eyes She works blindly at pieces that escape her Asking none for aid, not hearing the voices assisting Suffering in silence needlessly with kindred souls waiting a word...of hope. ----------------

       Thy tongue is like a sword, your words like daggers.  -------  A Queen learns her lessons the hard way somtimes. Just when she thinks she can be slightly free - she's hammered back in place by the boundries of her tower. Showing signs of vulnerability is a folly a Queen cannot afford - in both her waking mind or dreaming state.

       Nothing is as unpredictably horrifying or as eagerly welcomed as a storm. Workers and animals flee in fright and seek shelter under the smallest branch – lovers and friends laugh up at the clouds, seeking solace in the arms of those closest. Hate it, Fear it, Love it, Study it – above all else, Respect it.   -------------------  The snow swirls outside my window, winds howl their woes to the trees and spirits of the land, clouds cover the skies with a dark shadow that both forebodes and invigorates. Oh would that I could be the Queen of the temperate winds and weathers. To be able to control such wonders would surely be a power worthy of this Queen. What say you? Some things should not be controlled? Nay, I’d not control it merely…work it to my will and convenience. From my fingertips would come streaks of lightening that would strike even the darkest corners of the land or the soul. Mine eyes, would seek out those who need avenging or romancing and do justice to their predicament. From my mouth would come the coolest winds to chill the heartless or the warmest airs to thaw any apprehension. My heart…my heart would be at the mercy of those who seek it out, protected by the best of all elements yet vulnerable because of them.   Days like this, I relish being the Queen that I am, I relish those whom I love as friends and family. I am thankful for all that I have, all that I am, all whom I have, all that I have been prevented from becoming.      Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Tempestuous as the sea, and stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me and despair!

        Marriage. The state or condition of a community consisting of a master, a mistress and two slaves, making in all, two.  I have great hopes that we shall love each other all our lives as much as if we had never married at all. (Lord Byron)   ----------------------   Why must a Queen go through these trials of life in search for a King? Worse yet, no matter how the times do change, there are always those pressures from varying people to acquire a life mate. And they do everything they can to set you up with one too, without proper research I might add. Today the Queen had to sit through a gruelling few hours with a gentleman arranged as a potential mate. I must admit intrigue at his voice and recommendations by a friend. Like I said, this Queen came back slightly changed from her rendezvous the other day, so she decided to see what she’s been missing or turning down, waiting for a dream that may never happen. This man was really…well I could find no fault to him – save for his hands. His hands were…impeccable. Neatly manicured, trimmed nails, soft though hard looking, not a mark on them, not a single vein visible. As if any vein or spot that dare appear would be banished within a second of its sight. Then he’d place his napkin just ‘so’, stirring milk and sugar into his coffee, he methodically stirred the milk three times in one direction, then the sugar three times in the other. I noted this because it was pointed out to me to notice. “Milk first, three stirs no more or else you’re idle of hands and therefore mind”. That’s exactly what he said. I felt as though I was being told, ‘this is how you will do it from now on as well’. Control I do not need.   Attempting conversation, I talk about movies and we get onto the more eccentric films in our society today. Now, an obvious strike against him – he loves Tarantino Movies. I was my normal fun self in the teasing of such a man liking that ridiculous director, then mention I like Johnny Depp movies, especially Edward Scissorhands and the like, even his recent Pirate movie. At this point, the man told me, those were ‘nice but really, fantasy movies aren’t to be taken seriously’. Strike Number two.  Expanding further on the movies and Johnny D., we end up somehow at Cry Baby, Earth Girls Are Easy and Labyrinth. I said I’d never have linked Labyrinth in that category at all, but to each his own. The other two I liked actually because it was meant to be a fun movie and full of ridiculous humour that you couldn’t help but laugh at. He said, “oh don’t be joking me, you’d have to be stupid to think those movies are any sort of entertainment.”  *insert raised eyebrow* Did he just say…I was stupid? Is what I said, and he said Yes, honestly if you like those, you are.   Strike Three. That’s it.   I changed the subject and we idly talked for a while about nothing in particular, then I said I had to go, after all I do have a Queendom to run. At the front of the castle, he actually went in for a kiss. He touched my throat and trailed a finger to my chin, tipping it up. I shuddered, because his hands felt like soft, foreign smooth hands, was not doing anything for me. He thought I was affected, leaned in for a kiss. I try, you never know…but I learned to trust my instincts. I knew he wasn’t the one, I knew something about him was very wrong…and I knew I’d feel nothing from that lip touching. Because it cannot in good consciousness be called a ‘kiss’.   And here I am, Queen to you all. Looking out that window where a storm swirls relentlessly, wishing.

        Voulez-vous (ah-ha) Take it now or leave it (ah-ha) Now it’s all we get (ah-ha) Nothing promised, no regrets  Voulez-vous….ah ha Ain’t no big decision (ah-ha) You know what to do La question c’est Voulez Vous   ----- How I do love Abba and moreso, how I love that song…it enhances my natural rebellious nature and my daring spirit. I want to walk up to an unsuspecting person, carrying a bottle full of Aprethol, trail my fingers up his arm, wrap the collar of his shirt around my fingers, draw him close and say those words. Anyhew..moving right along…   Cheesecake? What ho! Need thee ask?  I have noted I need my most trusted confidant to rule my realm in my stead when wandering the world looking to conquer new grounds. To stand as King one would say hmm? Any attempts to over throw my throne (utterly ridiculous as they may be) hopefully shall be thwarted as I know he wouldn't dare thing of doing such a thing all on his lonesome *insert raised eyebrow* Obey Him…That is all.   On another note – your loyalty to me will be rewarded for your support in the last few weeks of my rule. You won’t know where or when…but it will come, to those who are deserving – the more deserving the better the reward.   --------------   Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight Won’t somebody help me chase these shadows away Gimme gimme gimme a man after a midnight Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

       Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety. Other women cloy the appetites they feed, but she makes hungry where most she satisfies.   ----  I believe I'd previously mentioned the pain and pleasure of being the Queen. I'll stand alone at that window and look out at the lives going on around me, make decisions that affect them all, decisions to let them leave me if that's what's best for them. These things take a toll however, a terrible price that chips away at an already tiny morsel that feeds a starving emotion. I am...is tired, emotionally drawn.   I am your Queen and that which makes me so, must be respected.

       Every human mind is a great slumbering power until awakened by a keen desire and by definite resolution to do --- It is much easier to suppress a first desire than satisfy those that follow --- There are two tragedies in life. One is not to get your heart's desire. The other is to get it.    --------  What's your desire? What do you secretly yearn for in that hidden place you dare not acknowledge? What tugs at the strings of your heart and soul that keeps you putting one foot in front of the other daily?  What do you desire more than anything in the world?  Questions we all want to ask and answer at one point in our lives.    Poor is the man, who's pleasures depend, on the permission of another

      Ahhh..the sweet treats of Temptation. How we yearn to fall victim and remain the hero at the same time. Dichotomies eat yer hearts out. I met Dichotomies once. He could never ever settle on a solution to anything. Philosophers!   ....Oh yeah...As I was saying. Temptation. Saying it again, Temptation. The more I say it, the more it loses its meaning. I guess if it doesn't mean anything then it won't matter if I give in huh. However, I am proud of My Queen of the North, she has proven herself to be resolute yet once again. Not a surprise but a happy outcome nonetheless.   For those who offer the sweetest of desserts, Let them eat cake.

        Jesus is risen, it's no surprise Even he would, martyr his momma To ride to hell between those thighs Pressure is building, at the base of my spine If i gotta sin to see her again Then I'm gonna lie and lie and lie  She'll make you cry I'll sell my soul to be back in your bosom And gladly help, please suck me dry And still you'll cry, to be back in her bosom Do it again.   ---------------------------------  Mmmmmmmmm. Taste that?   That, my Minions, is the delicious taste of temptation being controlled.  It's like eating a meal of your favourite foods, all of them just in the perfect amount, perfect temperature, perfect blends of taste. Then being presented with a virtual plethora of wonderous desserts to taste and sample. It's waved below your nose, fed to you on the finger of a lover for a small taste of what you'd be missing. So what do you do?   This Queen turns temptation back on itself.  I'll lick that morsel off a finger - but my tongue will linger and lave, while my eyes speak volumes in narration to the act.   I am worthy of being Queen my minions, I have controlled temptation in my hand. It isn't temptation in it's highest form - when that comes - it will have one hell of a task ahead of it. I do not worry for that day to come - I won't be 'defeated' by temptation.  Perfect moments in time happen to those who are patient for it.   Though, I must say - Good Gracious Me, this Queen's senses are heightened to new levels and easily aroused to the forefront! ------------------------------------   Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety.

       Love feels no burden, regards not labours, strives toward more than it attains, argues not of impossibility, since it believes that it may and can do all things. Therefore it avails for all things, and fulfils and accomplishes much where one not a lover falls and lies helpless.  Thomas P Kempis 1379-1471 --------  Today is St. Valentine's Day - a day to celebrate love and the sacrifices made in the name of love by all who went before us. Roman monk was arrested and charged for marrying couples against the wishes of the Emperor Claudius. Fables and tales older than most that will continue to live on for the ages, inciting sweet sighs and romantic words to be whispered.   That is, if commercialism doesn't suck the fun out of it first.   As Queen, I take immense joy today in watching the inhabitants of my many Realms enjoy each other, walking hand in hand, inhaling the fragrance of a young bloom or two, admiring a bauble or trinket...being for that one moment - content.   To you all - enjoy the day for what it is - Happy Valentine's Day  and don't forget each other tomorrow, next week, next month or next year.

       It matters not how straight the gate How charged with punishment the scroll I am the master of my fate I am the Captain of my soul.  -------------  The man who used to be my King - my ex-king you might say - has contacted his once Queen and I must admit I'm left with very conflicting emotions. The one I'd rather not give a name to or delve too deeply into would be if there's Regret lying dormant, now stirring. It is natural I suppose to have these emotions - the man  was  my best friend and confidant for a number of years.   The royal carriage is being sold. I am so very grateful he asked my opinion of what should replace the perfect, perfect car - and moreso that he notified me it was going to go, asked me if it was alright, since technically it was the Queen's choice. I have no problem admitting that the Queen shed a few tears this morning in memory, both good and bad of a time left behind. I'll miss that car. I miss my royal animals so badly - the axolotls - only worthy of being owned by the Queen for their originality and ability to confound those who see it. I stand at my window overlooking my domain, close my eyes and am transported back - sounds of the galahs, the parrots, the cockatoos (SEE THAT Hmm?), Dusty and Rebel (who is no more) running back and forth chasing some arbitrary animal. The river nearby that I found so much peace at, staring off into it's murky depths - odd hints of a large fish of some species that would peek here and there, eels that would surface to stare back at the lonely girl staring at them.  Then I remember, that's why I left - I felt alone. Now I wonder - has much changed? I am still staring out at various animals...though in a forest now...and they still stare back at a lonely Queen. A Queen that stands and talks with a court filled with people, yet is very much standing alone. A Queen that doesn't really seek to stand with someone, for really - she loves her own company - but she does wonder if she's the same now as she was then...was it worth leaving.    I am the Captain of my Soul and I navigated it in the direction I saw fit.

      The Queen just got some interesting words of advise from a total stranger and had her world rocked!  She leaves her castle tonight - to go forth and educate her mind...yet she's also in dangerous mode. Her hair smells delicious, her smile is deadly and secretive, her eyes speak a language and her body gives the riddles. Watch out boys she'll chew you up...oh oh here she comes, She's a Maneater.   ha ha ha  My mind is my worth.

      So enamoured of his love he was...when she parted for a few days, he went to a nearby river, wrote her name on leaves and floated it down the river hoping to signify who he thought of, whom his heart cried for...and Lo, she was nearby and found said leaves.   After her death...the Raga was written   It is only your picture that caress my eyes now My heart, I gave away to you, yet remains incomplete...my life Why was I destined to live without you?  O Lord lead me to my beloved's abode I plead to you take me to her She was as tender as a blossom She was a celestial beauty Her pristine love for me was your Benevolence Do me one last favour? Don't torment me like this Take me To her! Agony clouds my tearful eyes My life is tearing apart Only memories will remain...only memories     A living symbol of love a centuries-old legend This is the saga of Taj Mahal This is a legend, a symbol... That hearts had met was a miracle of God In each other's hearts they had found their God The two realms rejoiced the earth and the skies  She saw his eyes sparkle, helplessly bedazzled in love Th fairy-like beauty that is her, is to be blamed Such was the shower of love, awesome in all respects It is a living symbol of love It is an age-old story, right from the heart of Taj Mahal  In the path of love when his companion parted To the glorious dying flame he made a promise His love was put to test so be built a wonder --------------  Tears fall from my eyes celebrating what they shared, mourning the loss of love so pure, so quickly and to humbly pay respects to something so true that can so genuinely affect us all - centuries later and to come.   They were real. They were here once. They yearned, they ached, they dreamed, they loved.  Why do I feel the need to thank them? Can they ever know how truly successful their symbol has become? How they mattered to so many hopeful souls out there?  How they mattered to me?  I am at a loss to explain why this so deeply affects me, yet here I sit - weeping at a legend and feeling so close to them I cannot explain it.

As a Queen, I yearn for my duties to take me past that beautiful tribute so that I may go inside and pay homage to perhaps the greatest Queen/Empress - who so captivated her Emperor, his every breath revolved around their united hearts, as did hers.   A Raga (indian poem/story sung as a song) was written for lonely dreamers everywhere who asked the question ... What is Love?    Love is sacred Love is worship Love is belief Love awakens even in a stone the feelings of a heart  To love for love To die for love Never must you forsake love Never must you forsake love What is love...? Love is worship Love is faith  Love is a journey Love is the traveller Love is hidden  Love is there to see Love is a poem Love is the tune The magic of love is age-old  Those lost in love are obsessed  -----------  Throughout the night I will be adding quotes from the history of the Taj Mahal and the docudrama done in tribute. It is the least I can do, as a Queen humbled at the feet of a love so pure it's lasted through the ages and will continue to do so until the last Dreamer's star falls from the sky. I will rejoice their joys, revel in their love and through me...so too will you.

      I wonder if you Minions could tell me, offer your small amounts of wisdom, if you will - tell me why simplicity is oft so complicated.   I tell you what - I'm going to rule with a titanium fist once again.  I'll be giving no quarter to the miserly beggars who seek a sweet crumb in my Queendom - let them earn it - as my esteemed left ear Devil said - let them eat cake.  At some point every good Queen must be a merciless one. The time of reckoning is at hand, tumultuous times take over and I shall prevail supreme.   To calm me, I must share with you a site that helps to focus me and intrigue me...I find it fascinating.    urlLink The Drum Machine   for my quote today - refer below to yesterday's.

       Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Tempestuous as the sea, and stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me and despair!  ----------  See there? Behind that cloud...just past the silver lining? There! Yes that cloud! With the turbulent weather within it - the lightning, the thunder, the rain held up.   That my Minions...is a sign of tumultuous times ahead!  This Weekend the Queen is not in her castle, called slightly left toward her cousin who seeks domination over the Education Attendees. And what a time already this has been. Waiting for me were other Minions with a plan...and a candidate for the future role of King in my Multiverse. First question - is he a worthy candidate to even converse with the Queen let alone be considered?  It is my pleasant surprise...we have a contender for the throne. But something bothers me. I know not what it is...perhaps discussing it with my Minions will help me, I put it to you, dear devotees...what is bothering me? This man, this....candidate, is ideal. Drinks served to me on my wish, stopped when he thought I was in danger of losing my head (he doesnt know me too well does he!) and replaced with honestly...the best cups of coffee I've ever had. Stimulating conversations until dawn (I have yet to sleep), a sumptuous meal served to me to break my fast (wished I ate breakfast), mercilessly teasing those who would watch some sort of reality television last eve...with running commentary till we got kicked out to the bedroom television. I'm afraid the cincher of special treatment was the ten minute massage I allowed. After all, I am a Queen, there are decorums to be observed...this being said. I would like to hire this individual as court appointed Happy Maker.   Perfect...this candidate...his face would be envied by the maidens, a coin to press into your palm if that face graced it. A physique that does not worry me to his ability to protect and rule, mentally apt in more ways than I had hoped for and an interesting sense of humour......  Yet. . . yet.  I know. One day (that's still continuing...I'm getting midnoon meal made) is not enough...yet wouldnt I have some sort of...feeling?   C'est la vie et l'amour  Adieu mon Minions, adieu

      Hmm. What can I post that will aptly describe my feelings of the last few days, the loss of the person I was right up until well...yesterday. That'll do it nicely. ------  Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away Now it looks as though they're here to stay Oh, I believe in yesterday.  Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be,  There's a shadow hanging over me. Oh, yesterday came suddenly.  Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say. I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.  Yesterday, Love was such an easy game to play. Now I need a place to hide away.  Oh I believe in yesterday.   ------------------------------------ With the solving of one problems, comes the focus on another that lay hidden and dormant for many months. However I shall attempt to revel in the solving of that old problem and let the little tiny insignificant yet oh so important moment of tranquility and satisfaction, wash over me.   That'll do for now.

       Lust's passion will be served; it demands, it militates, it tyrannizes  Marquis De Sade --------------------  Can one experience lust without love? Reading an article recently my mind crossed this thought as I read an actor say he doesn't understand the concept of being inlust without being inlove. If so then I've been inlove with more people than I thought, and thrown it away because of fickle matters.   But a Queen must be fickle no? Does that result in 'cursed missed opportunities'? Hmm. I wonder of these things - I really do. However, I wonder now that I am holding out for 'the one', if I wont be driven mad by lust and make an error of judgement.   Tomorrow I'll write again, after getting over the dream I did have last night and those featured in it. Damn those forest walks late at night, damn the spirit that binds us, damn the fork in the road that I must choose and damn my heart.   Damn I say!  ;-)

      I don't know what to say..what I can say to express myself? Someone I've been better acquainted with recently has shown me things...visually and internally...that have just absolutely sent me reeling to my core. Completely unbeknownst to them (but knownst to us). Good in so very many ways, but bad for so many others and in it's slight ways.  That person's provided me with a new creed and an Angel to go with it - unintentional of course. One song I'd like to single out at the moment, because the music combined with lyrics just make me ... well.  Timo Maas Feat Kelis - HELP ME   There's an awful world inside of me You wouldn't believe all the things I've seen Who should I be? The sounds stifle me To feed in fear, try penetration here  Help Me, Help me Help Me, Help me  The realest part is my reflection's clear I know it's crazy but the end is near We're all alone, and judgements will reveal Deep coat cause some will have eternity  Help Me, Help Me Help Me, Help Me  This is just my destiny so come with me This is just my destiny so come with me Help Me, Help Me.   ------------- I recommend listening to it, through whatever means you can, the composition of the mixtures of sounds are amazing. Yes it's a technoish song - but wow...You can almost visualize the little person inside being pulled in all directions screaming HELP! And Kelis is as versatile as always in her singing.    I am the Angel of the Bottomless Pit Banished by God and Scarred by Satan I will fear no evil, because Evil fears Me.

         Ode to Mystery....     There is something precious in our being mysteries to ourselves, in our being unable ever to see through even the person who is closest to our heart and to reckon with him as though he were a logical proposition or a problem in accounting.  Rudolf Bultmann --   What happens to the hole when the cheese is gone?   Bertolt Brecht (whom I adore btw) ------   What am I, Life? A thing of watery salt held in cohesion by unresting cells. Which work they know not why, which never halt, myself unwitting where their Master dwells?  John Masefield ---------   It is the dim haze of mystery that adds enchantment to pursuit.   Antoine Rivarol -----------   Mystery has its own mysteries, and there are gods above gods. We have ours, they have theirs. That is what's known as infinity.  Jean Cocteau --------   Secrecy is the element of all goodness; even virtue, even beauty is mysterious   Thomas Carlyle (another fav.) ---------  Therein lies my ode to Mystery, to the element that continuously suprises me on a daily basis. Discoveries are made within ourselves and within others and sometimes with those others helping you. Mysterious feelings are the truest form of our most honest selves, makes us face who we are inside and who we pretend to be on the outside. It forces us to acknowledge parts of our minds we'd rather hide away, forces a reaction the smallest detail we'd sooner ignore..fear, uncertainty, hatred, sorrows and hurt. It also brings on the purest forms of joyful revelations, the deepest seeds of the most radiant love, a rapt awe in discovering a 'self' thought previously lost or destroyed.  Having a mystery revealed is like picking a beautiful flower from a shrub...the pleasure in it is immeasurable, you know at last what it feels like, smells like..mystery solved..but it will die shortly - leaving behind nothing but a memory of a time wondered about. However...as always...another mystery soon grows to captivate and stimulate our senses and we are thrown into the pulpit of emotion again with a mixture of jubilation and despair.   Do I want my mysteries solved or enhanced? Or perhaps do I want them solved and added to? Oh Fie! Even that is a mystery and I love it so!

      My affinity with animals continues, much to my delight, and most especially with snakes and large mammals. Have you ever just looked at an animal that's looking at you? Take for example the lovely hippopontomoposeses or the lellaphants. Maiuri (my name for the hippopontomoposeses) was inside taking a rarely seen walk around and she was just staring at me as I stared back at her for long intervals. due to me being Queen, I coerced my way back there to feed a few cabbages and give her a little pat. After long while getting acquainted again, and there was some trust there, enough for her to know I wasn't going to do anything, after feeding her the last of the vegetables, I was allowed to kiss her on the bridge of her nose. I can honestly say that's something I will take with me to the grave. It's not so big a deal for those that work with animals daily, but for me, for the times I have been having, that was a very special moment. And I was honoured to have another such moment with a lellaphant that remembered me. Rather, gave indication that it did, because I used to come by when I was 'incognito' as Queen, volunteering there at the zoo. In my hands I'd always have some treat, but I'd hide it behind my back and walk around a bit kinda teasing - cause they'd always smell it. Well yesterday, one of them broke away and followed me left and right as I walked and reached behind to see if i had a treat. He remembered me and I was thrilled beyond words!   After working up my courage I went to see the Reptile pit...having needed the time to face the snakes - not out of fear, simply paranoia toward my wayward mind. Two in particular captivated me and I must go back to have a look when someone that I know is on duty. These silly mortals are new and didn't realize who they were talking to - but I shan't punish them for it - they are doing their jobs and admirably at that. However, I must get closer somehow to these two in particular.  I must.   Other news, hmmm....had a fabulous time at the bash held for all my courtiers who celebrated their birth in February. Highlight of the evening being jello shots and signing large balloons with our own wishes - me - who's afraid of balloon pops! Needless to say, when that was common knowledge, balloons were thrown at me all the time with someone yelling "POW" in attempt to scare me. And the oddest thing that made this little get together absolutely hilarious - maybe twas the alcohol flowing like rivers.... The Balloons we bought that said "happy birthday"....had arbitrary names on them already!! So they said "Happy Birthday John/Samantha/Kevin/Amanda/Tim"!!   How bizarre is that?? To sell to the public random names on balloons!!??!! It's bloody hilarious is what it is and we still put them up all over the palace hoping someone with that name would show up.   Talk about your surprises! Oh and the building security showed up a few times to tell us to turn the bass down in music, then eventually joined us for some jello shots.  Since I was Queen...I was expert on how to do them, as the glasses were cough syrup cover sized plastic shots and hard, so getting them out was problematic. However - as with most things - you'll find if you can suck hard enough and work your tongue in perfect continuous circular motions...it'll come out and that sweet taste can be had right down the hatch. The gentlemen copped out after two claiming exhaustion and the Queen with her new lady maid Nadia just gleefully decreed, Roll it suck it slurp it gentlemen!!   Ahhh but the Queen had a little fun. =) Adieu mes minions!

       Ahhhh Rain...   As I stretch luxuriously, the Queen's eyes fall on the most wonderful sight - Raindrops pitter-pattering on her window. She smiles slowly and widely and find her hands running along her just enjoying the feeling of being alive. She stands and presses both hands on the walls of her shower and revels in the feel of hot water on her skin.   The Queen then remembers and smiles at the dreams she had of the previous night and the ones involved. Sometimes...fate loves me and puts the funniest ideas in my head to ponder and consider.   adieu mes Minions and most assuredly...adieu Man in my Dreams.

       A taste for irony has kept more hearts from breaking than a sense of humour, for it takes irony to appreciate the joke which is on oneself   Jessamyn West (the 1st American to be quoted by me) -----  Humour brings insight and tolerance. Irony then brings a deeper and less friendly understanding.  Agnes Repplier (2nd American) -----------  I think it very well suited that in my researches, the most appropriate quotes on Irony seem to be by women. Everyone appreciates the whole sense of Irony thing...yet it seems to me that women seem to shake their heads in wonder over it more. Perhaps it's our emotional minds or some such nonsense.  At any rate the Queen stands before you now, totally enthralled in music and it's ability to affect her decisions and her thoughts in dreams or awake states. I am also in awe of the weather...how thoroughly engrossing the simplest thing as a rainfall can be, or watching cloud formations around the moon, how when you close your eyes you can feel a cloud pass over the sun before getting that warm kiss again.  I'd like to announce I'm giving everyone a day of their choice to take and appreciate these little things. Take a walk in a forest, hug your favourite tree, if you don't have one - plant one. Stop what you're doing...look out your window, up at the sky...and look at the clouds whisk by. Think about that wide open space and what's beyond it. Take a look at Infinity at it's best. The melting snow at the sides of the roads, yeah it's traditionally dirty, darker, but look at the hidden metaphore there. Take a natural element and make it your own for a few precious moments in time. You are part of it, you are earth, air, water, fire. Exercise your five senses today, if you have all five, if not, then use what you do have...to the fullest. Close your eyes and listen to the music around you, even the clicking of a keyboard in a mass produced work environment has music in it, a rhythm to the beeps, the swishes, the snaps the steps of those around you.   I'd like to pick random lines from various songs because I can, cause i like how it sounds to sing and because...they affect me in one way or another, either as the one feeling it or the one it was dedicated to.  (It's long so read at leisure)   Love, love is a verb. Love is a doing word, fearless on my breath *** Sleep on tight, til the sunlight burns you happy Till the sunlight burns you happy, till the sunlight burns a happy hole in your heart *** You were my sun You were my earth But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no So you took a chance And made other plans But I bet you didn't think your thing would come crashing down, no *** Poor is the man, who's pleasures depend on the permission of another ***  Turn your lights down low Never ever try to resist, oh no Let your love come shining in Into our lives again, Sayin oooh, I love you And I want you to know right now oooooo, I love you. ***  Do you applaud fear. Do you hold it near Are you afraid to live your life, The way I perceive In my arms I'll catch you.  Do you mind if I'll always love you Heaven's gonna burn your eyes ***  Lights go out and I can't be saved Tides that I tried to swim against You've put me down upon my knees..... ..... Confusion never stops, closing walls and ticking clocks Come out upon my seas, cursed missed opportunities ***  This is the house, Come on in This is the house, Built on Sin This is the house, nobody lives This is the house, you get what you give ***  Don't be aroused by my confession Unless you dont give a good goddamn about redemption....  She'll suck you dry, But still you'll cry To be back in her bossom, To do it again.....  Jesus is risen, it's no surprise even he would, martyr his mama to ride to hell between those thighs.  The pressure is building, at the base of my spine If I gotta sin to see her again then I'm gonna lie and lie and lie  **** you can have my isolation, you can have the hate that it brings you can have my absence of faith, you can have my everything help me tear down my reason, help me its' your sex I can smell help me, you make me perfect, help me become somebody else *** So close no matter how far Couldnt be much more from the heart Forever trust in who we are And nothing else matters ***  If you were here, I could deceive you and if you were here You would believe   ***

        I am. You are. We are. One.    I took a walk today in the forest around my Domain, walked through all the trees standing proudly, majestic in their knowledge of mankind, having born witness to many of their antics. Do you know how truly connected we are to everything on this planet? Can you feel it racing through your bloodstream? That vital energy that binds you forever to this revolving planet and the worlds around us. Appreciate it with everything you have. This planet was an amazing gift and honestly I'm amazed it has lived for so long with us running it into destruction. We don't do as many good things as we can for ourselves and the environment we live in. We can start by treating our bodies with the respect due to a vessel that carries us about, taking our various abuses yet contiually working for us. We can take a moment and do something for our souls, the betterment of those that do not have the availabilities to do something for themselves. Everytime you go to a restaurant or buy food out - let's try not to waste ok? It's a cliche to say, but it's very true - there are those that cannot eat! Think about that when you can't finish something. I'm not saying to stuff yourselves, but there's no shame in getting something to go, dropping it off for someone on the streets. If you have a party and have alot of left over food that can be shared, drop it off at your local firehall for their midnight snack, or to a teen run away home. Don't Waste...the earth does not have an unlimited supply, it's not our magic pot of porridge.  I say again - take a moment to appreciate the beauty around you. It takes less than two seconds to smile at someone, it can make the world of difference. It's funny, because this all sounds like a "forwarded email of the day", but honestly, I've said this before the internet so there.   Do something impulsive and crazy, something you wouldn't have hesitated to do if you were a child again. Jump over a puddle in the road, hold a pole and twirl around it, stick your tongue out at a red light, make a face at someone in the car next to you, reach down, grab a handful of mud and squish it between your hands, then wipe it on your pants leg or something, (it washes off), play with your pet like you would had you been a child, kiss a tree. Feel Free from the responsibilites that life has thrown onto us. .. even if it's just for five minutes of your life...it's five whole minutes you would have been FREE. you'll think back and laugh on it, feeling much better everytime, giving you a little story to tell of how once upon a time, you were impuslive.  I felt empowered today, I followed what was inside me. I stood in that clearing near my favourite tree, i heard all the questions, doubts, fears, unspoken dreams and wishes....all came crashing into my mind. I felt momentarily like I was going to lose my mind or cry until I laughed myself into crying again. I felt out of control, nothing in my life was going the way it was meant to....I wasn't brave enough to make some aspects of my life realized and as for the other aspects I live in uncertainty. I raised my head to the the small gap between the trees that lets me see the beautiful sky above....my thoughts immediately went to this woman I saw once...proud in her homeless state. On the surface, she looked crazy, I'd pass her daily on my way to my co-op job...and give her what I could, though she never asked. After a month I looked her in the eyes and she had such a look of clarity, understanding and good nature, they sparkled. Maybe my memory is romanticizing it a bit, but I doubt it - she said to me, "You don't have to, I chose this life, I will find my way."  I was younger then and didnt know what to say other than murmer, "it's ok, i don't mind" and laugh then run off to my corporate trap. Think on that though - she chose her way and I'm not entirely sure she meant "I will find my way" in terms of food or shelter...i know she meant it on a deeper level. And I envy her. My thoughts then strayed on all those people that live in so much squaller, people around the world, children who die daily from starvation, mistreated and forced labour, disease...there is so much suffering and their voices are so quiet. Needless suffering...so many voices, so so so many silenced forever and others never heard.   A song popped into my head and I burst out singing it at the top of my voice, honestly, I don't think I remember much after that, I know I must have sung it for at least twenty minutes in some sort of trance. Because I stopped when my throat hurt too much to go on and my nose bled for the first time ever and tears were all over my face, dried on. Maybe it was a mental snap of sorts or breakdown if you will. I doubt it, it didn't feel like it and besides, I don't believe having a deep concern for my Minions is something to be considered crazy. But afterwards, I smiled ... and I know, I KNOW...it was radiant because I felt inside...deep inside...somewhere out there, someone heard it. In fact, a few of my vassals who were jogging did hear it and were inspired to things of their own.   Sing your own song for life.  Adieu -------  Paint my face in your magazines Make it look whiter than it seems Paint me over with your dreams Shove away my ethnicity Burn every notion that I may have a flame inside to fight And say just what is on my mind Without offending your might  Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do SO Say what you want I saw her face outside today Weatherworn, looking all the rage They took her passion and her gaze and made a poster Now it's moccasins we sport We take the culture and contort Perhaps only to distort what we are hiding  Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do But say what you want! Hey you, the one, the one outside, are you ever gonna get in, get in Hey you, the one that don't fit in, how ya, how ya gonna get in  Hey you, the one outside, are you ever gonna get in with your Broken teeth, broken jaw, broken mojo Yeah, this life...is too short to live it just for you But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do  So Say What You Want, say what you want Say what you want!    Powerless...Nelly Furtado

       Nerves Nerves Nerves   Since I am Queen it is expected that I take out my moods on my Minions so I think I shall do that today to veer from the path of nervousness I am walking down in preperation for today's huge outcome.  Firstly let me say that indecisiveness pisses me off to no extent!! Those of you who find yourselves saying, "whatever you want to do, where ever you want to go, doesn't matter much - you decide, anything you wanna do is fine with me".....Please find the nearest blunt object and bludgeon yourselves to death. Although I'm sure you won't be able to decide on which blunt object to use, let me help you with that one (gladly I might add)...see that stapler near your desk? Use that. Or you over there - use that picture frame so when the glass breaks it severs something effectively. Why don't you all find some gumption in your pathetic lives and contribute something to society? Forget that - not even society - do you think you can string together your fleeting mind long enough to make a simple decision on where to go for beer/coffee/dinner/movie with either the person you're dating, married to (god help that fool), or your friends? Just try it, go on...let me test you - Where do you want to go for dinner? OK NO! you're freezing up and about to say "doesn't really matter." Then I'll have to reach through and kill you, there'll be a mess everywhere and you're not worth it. Try again, think inside, hmmm, what DO I feel like eating? Chicken? Beef? Lamb? (oh shutup veggies, they're only cute when you're far away not living on a farm next to them bleating their frickin heads off, then you'll gladly eat them I swear) Now think..how do i want those prepared? Asian? Italian? European?  Surely you can decide through that, any sort of chinese food, or steakhouse or pasta joint. See it's not that hard is it? Go forth and decide!  Next on my list are over analytical people who won't drop an issue when clearly all want it to be dropped. What exactly about the words..."ok can we move on? Let's drop it" etc...are you having difficulty with? Why try to validate a point that is not going to matter to anyone at all two hours from now let alone two days? What? To prove your almighty intelligence and debate skills? Was it under the microscope to begin with? Are you that insecure about your own views that you need to Hammer them mercilessly into the brains and eyes of someone until they just want to wring the hell out of their screen, phone or your neck? More than likely if the other person's saying " you know what, forget it, doesn't matter"....it doesn't (and no I'm not talking in the relationship context game that women play "no no, doesnt matter anymore")!!! Especially when it's over mundane things that just come up in casual conversation!!! STOP! That's it....Just .. STOP!  No! I said stop, don't justify to me why, I don't care...upupupupupupupup!!!! STOP!  Let's see, what else can I attack....hmmm..... Distance and Money - both things are pissing me off lately. Mainly cause both are sooooo far away! Yeah I'm Queen, I could cash in the Multiverse, but then where would you all be hmm? Do you see the sacrifice I make for you all? Now all send $1 to Happy Queen...ok ok i tried. But seriously...why is it that money is so important? Let's say you wanted to go get your affairs in order, or see friends  who's Alllllllllllll the way over there and you're alllllllllll the way over here....now to me, you should be able to trade things like they did in the old days. I'm sure i have a few very valuable things here that the pilot or stewardess or someone will want! And what ever happened to the integrity of sexual favours? Not to brag .. well yes, to brag .. hell if it were a matter of favours trading, my mouth would fly me around the world with luxury stays and who knows what else. So come on people!! Let a Queen travel or if you can't do that....give me today.   Yes, that's what it all boils down to - I want to own 'today'. Normally I do, with everyday, try to take control of it. But today I'm slipping. The meeting of today is too important to casually say, "feh, if not this, another will come along."  There is the peasant part of me that says, You cannot do this, you are not Queen enough for this new set of duties, it hasn't been long enough.  Then there's me...Sarita, Queen of the Multiverse that hears that little voice say, You know you can do this better than anyone. You were given this opportunity for a reason, they know you have what it takes and so do you! No matter what trials they put you through, you can breeze through them effortlessly. You are Sarita. And that little voice is starting to sound suspiciously like someone else too, hmph. . . bloody know-it-all-gotta-be-right-little-devil!   So let's see which one of those two voices battle it out and win, today is one of the hardest trials I'll have to face on a professional level so if the queen is not around the next few days to send her messages to you - don't sass me over it, I won't be in the mood.   Is that it? I think it is. What's my name again? Where am I going? What is this place? GAH!  Adieu Mes Minions   Oh yes - a few links that cheer me up....

       So Let it Be Written...So let it be done!   Here ye, Here ye, by the proclamation of Queen Sarita of the Multiverse, let it henceforth be known the true meaning of the following:   ENTRANCE:     The act or an instance of entering. A MEANS OR POINT BY WHICH TO ENTER - can be used in terms of doors, windows, rooms, boxes, bags and other items in which a part of you is ENTERING said item.    The Queen has spoken and the Historian has written on stone.   What say you Minions?

       Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Tempestuous as the sea, and stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me and despair!   ---- The Queen is becoming slack in her addresses to her Minions, for that I apologize. However it has been just that interesting a few days and glad I am of it. It's as though the world knows I am lacking a King and are all suddenly interested in competing for the role. The funny thing is ... in my whole life, only two have actually said to me (and stuck to it) "are you looking for one? Can't we just start off as friends with no boundries?".   Someone gave the Queen a choice and that is the true test isn't it? Either way I do love Fate, his ironic sense of humour has me floating like a flower along a current driven waterfall, rushing toward a destiny unknown but giving me avenues to enter and more importantly...to exit, at my will. Best of all, are the accomplices along the way who throw another flower into the mix to travel with me...some are there for a short ride, others there till the end. It's good to know who those are now and even more reassuring is that they're flowers of the same species. (I'm sure they love being refered to as flowers....arrgghh MEAT and Aprethols!). heheheh  Advice to you, my worshipping Minions, sage advice too, I'd follow it if you ever have the occassion to....  When you go through your life's relationships with people, be they friends, lovers, advisors - make sure each time they pass through, you realize what you would want and NOT want in the next person. If they have those qualities , weigh your options early and do not go back on what you've learnt. Time is too precious a commodity on this Ride of Life we're on, don't look back and view anything as a waste of time.  There is alot else I could say but I'll think more on it and get back to you later...needless to say, for the first time in a long time - your Queen is finally at peace with herself, is happy with the new twists and turns as she floats along the river toward her destiny and more importantly, is happy and grateful for the flowers that float with her and the new one tossed into the path.   Adieu dear ones.....Adieu.   Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infiite variety. Other women cloy the appetites they feed, but she makes hungry where most she satisfies

       Broken Dreams   It's amazing how you don't realize how much something meant to you until you suddenly don't have it. Even if you set yourself up to not have, know that you don't have a great chance at it - there's still that glimmer, that ray of hope deep down...that maybe...just maybe...you ARE good enough.  Then that tiny glimmer is fanned into a fantastic shining light...but what it reveals is a harsh, cold reality that you really are not good enough.  What's more shocking, is that for a Queen, I like to think my emotions are able to hide themselves quite well. Ordinarily, they are, but for that damned "hope", that false sense of a Hope that will not be. Disappointment is another...hurt intermingled deep within it, rising up in a rapidly advancing wave, consuming me until I fairly ache from it.   Why do I have dreams again?  Verily, i do believe I'd rather pain to this Hurt.

That's it - take me, I'm done...nut house here I come! You know, every queen goes through a period of insanity when her subjects and advisors try to put her away and take over the country - you won't get away with it! Don't even think it for one moment!   I FORBID IT!  and I have spoken - therefore it is done.  stay tuned for more insane updates as the day continues - it promises to be very entertaining for those not living it.

       DREAMS    When asked what he would do if he only had six months to live: Type Faster. Isaac Asimov  If there were dreams to sell, what would you buy? Thomas Lovell Beddoes  Maybe we are less than our dreams, but that 'less' would make us more than some Gods would dream of.     Sister Corita Kent.    ----  Dreams are funny things aren't they? Sometimes they are so real you are completely disoriented when you awaken. Other times it's just that weird!! You think, oh my goodness did that come out of my head?? Then other times it leaves you waking up yearning when you shouldn't and there are others in your vicinity!   One night I'm going to sneak out of my royal chambers and watch everyone as they sleep - decipher if I can what they dream of. Ever watch a dog, cat, farm animal dream? It's quite funny actually. . . as are babies, they dream with little furrows and giggles or cries. Toddlers actually wake up fully believing what they dreamt and often need that little cuddling attention - though often time I wonder how much is dream and how much is reality that us adults can no longer see.  hmm.   But what of dreams that involve a 'better' life, more profitable? We all dream of that, yes...even me..the Queen..remember, all my riches go toward maintaining my Domain. The world is so huge, the Universe so all encompassing, I want to go everywhere in it! Fire up the spaceship, Fly me To the Moon and all that.   What's your dream? Who would you tell it to? Would you divulge your deepest secrets if you felt you had the freedom to? Do millions of dollars buy you that confidence I wonder? I have a dream (sorry M.X) But I do have a dream, actually several, and they're all connected. Harmonization in progress for I dream simple dreams that I believe are attainable.   What do you dream? Whisper to me...your deepest desires...confess to me.

       More on Lust, Passion, Sensuality and Love   I think it's extremely important to distinguish between Lust and Love. It's oft confusing in it's presentation, but unless perfectly intertwined with the other, they have the potential to put you in serious hot water with no ladle to get out with. Yes, you lust after someone, probably a few simultaneously...and you begin thinking, "oh if we were together always it would be wonderful, we have so much in common blah blah blah". Draw yourself a T chart - one side Lust one side Love and write down what you really know of the person. Methodic and unromantic but this is serious business here. A Queen does not have the luxury of time and dating when she's trying to keep an emotional schedule (contradictory as that is, go with it). It's amazing how sexually compatible you can be with someone, then realize that perhaps you would have a very tumulltuous relationship should things go further. But how to stop that sexual attraction once it's begun?   Dare you take advantage of your sensuality, natural sparks that fly amidst constant metaphors that linger till the morning's rays kiss your face? Dare you throw caution to the wind and indulge in an strictly taboo melange of depravity, sensuality and carnal feasting? What of the quest for King? Does that throne then go empty and happier for it?  How important are they really...tender moments that you miss can come from anywhere...even your compatible accomplice. Heirs? They can be randomly chosen to be born from my soul. Hmm.  So I put this out to you, dear void, Bloggers and random cyberspace alike. Each emotion serves itself up on the shiniest of silvery platters, but do you notice the dish served from the glare?  Hmm indeed. . . adieu dear void...the game continues.

       What most men desire is a virgin who is a whore. (Edward Dahlberg...died the year I was born)  Lust is to other passions what the nervous fluid is to life; it supports them all, lends strength to them all...ambition, cruelty, avarice, revenge are all founded on lust (marquis de sade)  If you live in rock and roll, as I do, you see the reality of sex, of male lust and women being aroused by male lust. It attracts women. It doesn't Repel them. Camille Paglia   ---   This Queen has accepted a few things over time and reinstated them to my daily routine as a result. Lust will always be a big part of my life and be a huge factor in everything I do. Passion, Lust, sensuality...they are all somehow interconnected and woven into a taut string of a bow...waiting for a hunter to pluck at it daring it to snap.  I also evalutated once again the criteria for those seeking to challenge for the role of King. I remain confident and steadfast in believing these criteria to be more than ample if not rather generous in it's lax ways and loopholes.  This being said, accepting said feelings in my life, the Queen has decided to Seize the Day, grab hold of opportunities while they pass me by in their tempting forms. There are those who practice Illusions to the truest sense of "art form", as well as natural humourous or endearing men...then there are those few, who excel at flirtation at a level unresistable to me.   The sexiest part of the body, the most sensual and attractive part - the brain. One can make a person want them, deny them pleasures or turn a person off of them with a mere suggestion that develops into thought. Finding myself challenged as I have the last few days in such an intellectually stimulating and thoroughly erotic manner...I find myself enjoying this "game" and am looking forward to the inevitable loss of control. Thank goodness I have Minions that are so very satisfying - all of them - faithful, wise, funny, erotic, etc...they are coming in handy at this particular junction in the road.  On another note - it's been raining here often and as always, at odd times when I question things. My Love the Rain sends drops to kiss my skin like butterfly wings, to whisper dreams against my lips and desires in my ear.   More to Follow I assure you...The Game has just begun

        Victory is Mine    So I am back from my adventure to the portal of infinite death and variety, also known as Grocery Store, with positive ends! I am happy to announce there were no incidences with me in there. However I will say this – there is a very rich Russian Jewish lady driving a sandstone Jaguar X type, wearing a purple fur coat with purple heels and horrible blonde hair. She stole our parking spot. Plain and simple, STOLE it. We were three spots from the entrance halfway passing the car when it started to back out, so we put on our indicator and waited there, this boob in the reversing car didn’t know how to drive, didn’t realize they had a lot of room to back out and made us move. This Jag woman was right up our ass so we couldn’t back up, we moved forward a bit and kept our indicator on. The wench moved in…and that’s annoying as all hell as it is…but then, she did the unthinkable…she smiled at us and did the ditzy “oh well sorry” shrug.   SHE SMILED AND SHRUGGED!!! At me!! The Queen knew no wrath as that moment let me tell you! When we eventually got to passing her car since it was a good two minute walk from our FARRR spot – the woman was getting out of her car and had the audacity…the sheer nerve…to say jokingly “oh I guess my car’s faster”.  Now I’m a reasonable Queen. I can handle minor disputes the utmost of grace and decorum. However at that moment, had there not been a very good looking police officer standing there….I would have cheerfully punched that woman square in her overly-made-up-Zsa Zsa-wanna-be-clueless-bitch face.   I did what any normal person would do…I stalked her through the grocery store and signalled to my more familiar minions that I was after her. Bless their strong armed, handsome, kind souls…they made it a point to disappear when she needed assistance and took forever getting to her, then making a point of being more courteous to me!  I feel my revenge is subtle but well worthwhile and effective.  Most satisfactory was the fact that she bumped into her own car with her own trolley at the end of the shopping session…leaving a very sweet dent in the side panel. To which I couldn’t resist quipping a smart arsed remark.   At any rate – I am also back from a date I had tonight. The Queen ventured forth and met with a previous contender for the King’s Throne. I didn’t think it would be as successful and it wasn’t. I didn’t go to be a doubting person, I really just wanted to see, give second chances and all that. Never let it be said I don’t allow for these things, or consider that perhaps my first judgements are unfair, too expectant or just biased.   I’m so tired of being right all the time.   I also came back sans little loving friend that would keep me company in my lonely hours. They just weren’t…well, I couldn’t decide.   Let’s see what tomorrow brings.  Adieu Mes Minions.

        The Queen Rocks    A simple and effective statement I choose to believe is 110% true and I’ll thank you all to indulge me too. I am royalty, and royalty are meant to exist in their high and mighty towers, unaware of their own and others’ harsh realities, choosing to live in a glorified bubble.   Ok, so maybe my dreams had something to do with this image of mine however, once again…stay away with your pins!   I miss my pets! I miss having something there (I hate referring to them as ‘thing’) that greets me excitedly, or floats around crazily when I draw near them. They made me feel unconditionally loved, they needed me as much as I needed them, we had a special bonding relationship. Of course the best part is that they can stare at us all we want, they aren’t going to say a thing and the glory is we get to invent and discern their glances and motions as we see fit. Take my freaky walking fish for example, the darling Axolotls – they differ from the average fish in that they actually are rather independent in thought. They’d swim up and take food from my fingers and I’d like to think they lingered there once or twice just to feel my loving touch and me theirs. When I came home at certain times, they’d just swim to the corner I was closest too and start doing strange things I later learned were pet tricks! And it cracked me up to have them pace along their tank with me as I paced when I was thinking about leaving the Kingdom and the King I resided with.  I choose to see that as them mimicking me in a cute way as opposed to whatever it may actually be, because that was some of the more precious memories that kept me going in days that became unbearable. As a result, I’ve decided – The Queen needs another pet. I cannot get more Axolotls right now, but I will most certainly get a little hyper fish that will hopefully bring some small joy into my life up high where no one can touch me.   A note on these places called Grocery Stores – where my staff goes to get the food that fills my halls at mealtimes. These things are not wonderful things!! They are traps masquerading as a haven to those that would seek to feed their families. Once you pass through those portals you cease to be this controlled individual with common sense, perfect stance, gait and mannerisms. You become some sort of bumbling idiot, liken to that of the Jesters in my court! They deliberately put things at odd places so you either crash into them, don’t see them or are forced to laugh when some child pulls on a capsicum and gets buried up to his neck in them, thereby making you look like a big meanie. You also let your guard down in there and the smallest frustrations cause you to have some sort of brain leakage where you burst out bawling when they don’t have vanilla almond special k or some other such nonsense.   But today my friends….I venture forth once more into the mysterious vicinity that contains things I need. I refuse to let it beat me. I am coming back for once…without incident. It shall not beat me again, I am Queen, I rock. I think instead I shall let those lovely minion boys be my toys for the entire time in there. I think it will be great great fun indeed. You mess with me, I mess with you right back! Mwah ha ha ha ha ha.   OK, so I also may not end up coming away with a new little friend. I guess the prize will go to the one who can look at me so I forget they are just mindless swimming machines and rather, that it really does love me. Not such a strange concept is it, someone actually loving me? Despite the fact that I sit on my throne wwwaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy up high, it’s nice to believe in that little fairytale, especially since I’m just that high up, it may take forever and a day for someone to reach me!  Hmm, I shall ponder this at the various stores that surround my Domain. It’s nice to be Queen of all this…it’s nice to indulge.   Adieu Mes Minions.

       Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Tempestuous as the sea, and stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me and despair!    -- The Queen has come to a point of revelation…yet again, though this time not on her own. In the quest combating Passion in it’s varying forms, I came upon the safe and sound theory that abstinence in some areas of my life recently was necessary. We all remember the bathtub adventure with guards watching on as the Queen continued her observations in seduction and power. Not to mention my own personal lessons over time.   Why then is it that the Queen herself cannot see the obvious before her, the problems that led her to believe one theory to be correct. Remember if you will, the Queen’s experience with some rogue Minions when she was of the ‘coming out’ age. There was a resulting copy and evidence of said encounter that  has recently come into my possession through the 60 day abstinence. Abstinence of actual encounters are understandable - we don't want the wrong King to slip through to rule beside me. But why from myself?  Everyone is entitled to fears, and to face the dark periods of their life is something you both fear happening and crave. The Queen reviewed the evidence and since then, realizes…has been unable to enjoy who she is, to acknowledge her essence.  Why should this be? Yes she saw things she didn’t know happened to her. Yes she saw herself in a way that was most certainly not becoming of royalty. And yes, she saw herself gain control of the situation and escape.   Should this be something that keeps her from herself? Is this why perhaps she’s not willing to face herself in her darkest hours? I think it is.  I am passionate, I am a Life Force, these are reasons I am Queen of my element…it’s time to begin being Queen again.   My reign remains Supreme. Minions, Serfs, Guards, Maidens and Warriors…press your ears once more to my chambers, never shall my nature be stifled.   ---  Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infiite variety.  Other women cloy the appetites they feed,  but she makes hungry where most she satisfies

         urlLink Conflict     There she stood, before the wide opening of the window, high up in the tower, with the rain frantically falling before her. Lightning streaked viciously across the sky before her, wakening her from her reverie. She put a tightly balled fist to her stomach to ease the knots as the thunder rolled right through her. Taking a shaky step forward, she reached a hand out to brace against either side of the window frame, arms spread wide, and collapsed on the sill with a deep gasp. She let her head drop backward against the frame, eyes closed, random drops hitting her face and winding their way down her tear stained cheeks.   They   were inside her mind…warring with each other. A frown pasted on her face, she gripped the sides of the sill with a deathly strong hold and listened to   them    Every emotion was being torn in two and shredded, every thought was being processed with an over analytical eye, every physical reaction was a carefully orchestrated act. They warred within her over feeling unlucky yet luckier than most, feeling superior while being shown inferiority, feeling good for others’ life altering good luck and sad inside for her halted state. She felt everything whirl around her like the savage wind cutting through the forests and seas outside. She felt it building in her, like the waves crashing over and over against the rocky cliffs, more and more   they   bickered, they pulled and warred.  Feeling herself tilting on the sill, she glanced down and saw darkness, so high up she sat. Grasping onto the edges even more tightly, she leaned more forward so all her hair hung down, rain soaking it into raven black curly locks. Her hips slid a bit more over the edge and briefly, she heard  them  quiet their arguments and smiled a little. Testing a new mischievous idea, she turned her back to the window and lay down on the sill so her head was hanging back, anchoring her feet to large lounge before her.  They   quieted even more, the noise dying down to whispers. Smiling wider as the rain poured down on her, she glanced up at the skies, darkness penetrated only by brief slashes of lightning in the most awing of streaks.  “So my precarious position worries you does it?” she asked  them  before slipping further backwards. Knowing what she had to do, she took a moment to enjoy the peace, enjoy the silence that stretched before her. Truly feeling the thunder this time as it shook the very foundation she leaned over, shaking alive feelings inside her that lay dormant for some time. She felt and heard the vehement voices as   they   they protested aloud for her to not go any further over the edge. Courage, an emotion she’d not recognized in long days, reared its head and encouraged her thoughts. She threw her hands backward and let it hang out there, fingers splayed open to touch each raindrop that stung her with their force in their need to hit the ground. Arching her back, she looked down, backwards into the dark, yawning void below her. She knew somewhere down there was a deep pool of water she could fall into and disappear in its depths. If the wind caught her and took her further out, there were many trees to break her fall among other things she was sure. Yes, this is what she must do. All she had to do was unravel her feet from the lounge and let gravity do what it will.       Noooo, please, don’t do it      Startled, she quickly sat up and looked around for the child that dared enter her chambers. Surely it was a child, the voice was that of an innocent girl, not more than a few summers old. Seeing nothing there, she closed her eyes and took a deep breath in and heard crying. A child was crying and getting louder in the darkness.  “Hello? Where are you child, let me help you,” she called out softly.  The crying continued but much less urgently, calming down with little hiccups.  “Tell me where you are,” she appealed gently, “Let me assist you.” Then the noise started to sound remarkably like laughter. It was laughter, soft with some halting to the breath, but laughter all the same. Then the little girl spoke, with an ethereal echo to her voice,  soothing and calming to hear.       You can’t help me. I can help you, I’m here to help you.      “How can you help me? You are but a child!” She said incredulously, “who are you little poppet? Let me see you”     Don’t you recognize me?  I’m you. I’m your Hope I’m your Dreams I’m your Wishes I’m your Confidence      She kept her eyes closed and felt another tear slip between her lashes, knowing as she heard it, to be true. Shaking her head, she weakly rest her forehead against the frame and took a deep breath.      You stopped believing in you, in me. You silenced us. You let “them” win for too long. "They’ll" win again if you continue over that edge…you’ll kill us.      Clasping her hands tightly over her mouth, she sobbed achingly, shaking her head in denial, unable to say a word. Feeling years of silenced emotions come bubbling up, she started to feel giddy, head spinning in many directions. She heard   them   trying to be louder, over that little girl inside her, and held them back.       You confined our hands, we could not fight “them”.  You muted our voice, we had no mouth to silence “them”. You blinded our sight, we could not seek “them” out.  You tucked us away trying to keep us safe, instead “they” have run free with your mind.  Here we are. You have a choice…    Noise.  She heard it before her little voice was silent…   They   were coming back.     Here “they” come…make your choice      She opened her eyes, looked at her surroundings, saw her room, bed slightly mussed from her attempt at napping.  Turning around she stood on the sill and leaned back, glancing alternatively at the deep, darkness below and the dimly lit, warm interior.   She closed her eyes and made a choice.

        Eternal Slumber in Shadows…    There is no escape.    Feeling another branch scrape at her arms, another thorn scraping at her ankles from some randomly scattered shrubs, the one thought upper most in her mind was…’There is no escape.’ She sees the trees whisk by, faster than the wind they went, her feet barely touching ground before lifting off again in flight. She doesn’t need to think anymore about where she’s going – it never matters,  They   always find her. Her eyes dart frantically about, looking for new paths to take, new roads that could, that might, that would lead her further and further away from  Them  . The night air filled her lungs, simmering the fires of exhaustion with a cold force. She lifts her head to the skies as she floats along, seeing the tips of the trees meld together, as if creating a web in case she set flight and dared escape in the sky. Ah, the night sky! There it lay, so expansive and eternal, filled with worlds and beings of its own. How she longed to be on any one of them at this moment. A bitter laugh escaped her bruised lips, who’s she kidding?  They  would probably be there too. What’s that? The shadows are moving closer together near the webbing of the trees! She blinks a few times and it was gone, merely leaves falling onto the forest floor. It was getting harder to distinguish between all the shady motions…was it   Them   or just a figment of her imagination. She’s been running so long, so very long,   They   were becoming a part of her, a daily and hourly habit.   Letting her legs move on their own volition, she closed her eyes and saw the changing landscapes of all the years past since   They   started to haunt her. She remembered what it was like to be considered normal, to see the world through eyes of innocence and joy with nothing to plague her. She recalled the faces. Everyone had beautiful faces, filled with emotions and expressions that lent to their character. There were children playing with joyful laughter, mothers and fathers watching on in pride, love and ready to pounce lest one of their offspring got hurt. Oh if only they knew what was waiting for their children out in the world, she longed to tell them. She screamed and screamed at them, banged on the bubble they lived in, “Run! RUN! Don’t let them grow up!!” No one ever heard her. So she kept running. She remembered the feel of snow crunching under her feet, changing to mud soaked land in the Spring; soft, lush grass of Summers and the padded earth packed with fallen leaves of Autumn, seeking escape from their world as well she imagined. Over and over the seasons cycled as she ran, ever watchful during moments she slowed. Sometimes she had that far a head start on   Them,   she was allowed to stop and live life a bit. How long? She had no idea, time had lost all meaning soon after   They   found her. Inevitably, and all too soon,  They  would catch up to her and she’d run again. She remembered desperately clinging to people for help, pleading with them, “help me, please mercy HELP!” But there was nothing they could do for her, some even spurned her in disgust or fear.     Feeling a tear slip between her tightly shut lids, she gasped in the night air once more, realizing she’d held her breath the entire time. Opening her eyes, letting the haze clear, she saw a shape in the coming distance. A tall, dark spectre loomed ahead. It entranced her in a way nothing has for the centuries she’s been running. Staring intently at it as it came closer to her, she felt her heartbeat calm itself, felt her mind slow its racing, she found her feet slowing its flight incredulously. She stopped directly at the base of the spectre, letting her gaze travel from its base upwards. Her Spectre was a tree, not a leaf existed on it, nor branches of any long kind. Yet it stretched proudly toward the night sky, defying all the trees around it, lively in their leafy decorations and awing branch spans. Looking beyond its top, she saw a circular opening where there were no branches or leaves to web the sky from her view. The moon hid behind a dark cloud, she smirked at the “silver lining” metaphor and looked to the shimmering stars surrounding it. Leaning in, for the first time since she began running, she reached out to touch. Closing her eyes, she felt the coarse bark under her fingertips and felt, really felt the Spectre’s life force flowing beneath her. It lived…it had nothing to its name, but it lived, triumphed on in the face of being non-existent. She saw at the side of the Spectre a large stump that was once a magnificent tree. It was moss covered all around except for the top of it, which was surprisingly clear and clean. Looking toward the sky, the Spectre and the stump, she closed her eyes and swallowed. She knew now what she had to do.   She kissed the Spectre, letting her lips stay on the cold bark, letting the energy flow around her, tears streaming down her face. Walking around to the stump, letting her fingers trail along the Spectre’s base, she sat down and lay back. Letting her entire body relax, for the first time in what seemed like forever, she smiled and felt her bones groan. Feeling it before seeing it, she opened her eyes and saw above her, high in the sky, a red Moon. Knowing this phenomenon comes very rarely she knew it was just for her, for this moment. She let its rays caress her and kept her fingers touching the Spectre.   She heard   Them  coming. All other sounds quieted in the forest. Even the wind died down to a respectful silence, knowing what was to come and not wanting to travel the sounds to anyone. She closed her eyes and whispered a name onto the night air.   As she fell into an eternal slumber,   They   claimed her.

       Note:  Have I mentioned how much I love my forest? No? Well I do. Most interesting things happen when you decide to take walks in them during the wee hours of the night. I know, it's dangerous going out without your guards, but rarely will any serf from my Queendom dare attack me in my habitat. You see this place is occupied by spirits of the netherworld they believe. There are mysterious things buried there from many a century ago. . . no single soul has been able to determine just what it is. Only one man has dared challenged my courage in discovering the origins of said burials and methinkst he doth need to get himself off his smarty-pants-brave-warrior-arse and prove to me just how Kingly he really is. Maybe, just maybe those things seemed to have moved spots since last I journeyed into the enchanted wooded area. Maybe I'm just stressed from my duties and require a clarification by the only one I'd trust to enter my forest without proprer clearance. I do love my special tree though, it protects me even at the oddest moments and it loves me when I hug it. (not like those 'tree hugging' minions that keep my lands flourishing) I hug this tree with a respect and admiration and awe that's due to it after so many years of service, offering the sweetest nectar of Maple to those who crave it.   I'm not the only one that enjoys these nocturnal strolls - there are mysterious entities aside from the woodland sprites, faeries, pixies and nymphs (mmm nymphs). These entities stare at me with glowing eyes that haunt the memory and they follow my path as if making sure I dare not stray off it. .  Yes methinkst this devilish King should show his worth and go poke at the burial mounds whilst I stand with sword in hand at the opposite end yet within sprinting distance to the edge of madness...er...forest.

        The Queen Dreams & Slumbers with Demonseed    What goes on in a person's mind that helps select what they dream while they slumber? Is it something you desire deep down inside? Is it something you are most afraid of or dread happening? Is it perhaps something that is just influenced why those you meet, speak to or live with?   The Queen's been dreaming frequently in the last couple months of things she has no control over and situations she has no idea about! How can someone make sense of something that they have no concept of, never experienced, but always dreamt they'd have. It's thoroughly fascinating, the creativity the mind can conjure up to entertain you while you lay in another realm. Not only that, I truly do believe that certain beings on this wonderful Multiverse of mine can somehow connect with others and send dreams or take dreams from them. Being Queen I'm highly susceptible to this effect and I find it might be getting somewhat out of hand. My Mind is tortured at all times when i slumber, i awaken with confusion and insights to myself and others I could do without and worse yet - it's becoming very difficult to distinguish dream from reality.   Of course it could just all be random insanity over thoughts by an overwrought mind and have no significance what-so-ever.    Age cannot wither her Nor Custom Stale her infinite variety Other women cloy the appetites they feed But she makes hungry where most she satisfies

       taking a moment out of the epic tales...my devilish King, you do sum your Queen up quite well - but I must take the longest possible route to make a point. heheh Thanks! And you're right - the grass is greener here. You may walk on it, around it, through it...tis our playground, not theirs!

        Les Yeux Ouverts    She glances out her wide window, head against the frame, soft smile across her lips, yearning in her eyes, love in her soul. The world seemed so very far away from her, as she looked down upon it from her very high tower. Idly, she ran her hands along the sill she sat on, tracing the slight cracks and spaces with her fingertips. This was her very favourite spot to be and she was thrilled she had it built. The window was wider than her arm span and was deep so she had a sill extend inward with a soft mattress top so could lie on. The window opened completely and from that spot she could lie and watch her queendom, or the skies full of angry clouds. Lying there now, she listened to the rain fall on her rooftop...all shaded glass so she can hear the drops better.   Closing her eyes, she smiled wider and wider, stretching her hands out of the window, she felt the rain fall. This is life reaffirmed. The very nature and cycle of rain is life in essence. What ever else could go wrong in this world, on this planet...whatever moments feel like they will never get better...times when she felt completely alone...one thing remains a constant. Even through seasons when Rain is hardly to fall, she feels at a loss, confused, harried - the day will get warmer, rain will fall.   And then she realized, throughout her life, the one force that kept her being a Life Force, and how she loved it. Truly loved it. She's happier when she sees it, hears it, talks about it, plays with it and can't wait to see it again. It brings out the best in her - her hobbies, her decision making, her feelings are less confused, she's more creative, loving toward makind and herself. It's been supportive of her her entire life and will continue to do so for the rest. She was afraid for a while, she was incapable of loving anyone. So long had she lain there, alone, enjoying the views, yearning for someone else to be at her side - that she wondered if she would actually enjoy that when it does happen. When you're alone enjoying a place for too long, another person may seem too intrusive. Then she also realized, she was never alone - it was always with her. If that's not love, she doesn't know what is then. She's not completely ignorant, she does know loving another person's different, but it at least means she does know the emotion, and until a further time when she can better herself - though she's Queen - the Rain accepts her as is, and has her whole life.   She also dreamt of the places she would like to be right now, as it rained on her. She thought of a little cottage by the sea, on the top of a mountain, isolated by all, with a verandah that circled the entire building. She would sit there, with a steaming mug and stare out at the ocean, the clouds and lightning that would battle there, feel the breezes of change whisk through her. The tower she built herself was close though, high as she was, she had ample view of the ocean and forest surrounding her. However, her Queendom was in the way, her responsibilities. She wanted that cottage, in a further place than here - europe perhaps - to be hers, where she could shout out her thoughts, her deep down thoughts...or shout out a name and see if it gets returned on the winds.   At the cottage, she wouldn't have to think. She wouldn't have to consider the feelings of others. She wouldn't have to care as much if she didn't want to. It would be her Utopia.  She opened her eyes and looked around - happy with what she saw, yet wishing to be elsewhere...just today. Just for today...to be with the rain...anywhere else but here.  Just one dream she sees with Open Eyes

      I always thought that the old saying, "the grass is always greener on the other side" was just a myth and a silly thing to say. Apparently I was wrong. It is much greener over here.

       Q & A   People ask me why I have hidden blogs. In fact someone got mad at the Queen recently and implied she is hiding things and being secretive, showing no trust. This forces me to be mean and say - "I never trusted you to begin with, my trust is not quite so easily gained". Which naturally didn't work out well either.   So here is one of my answers to that question - why the secretive or multi-blogs/journals??  Have you ever wanted to be someone else than who you are? With another personality that's braver, riskier, more daring? I know, you're thinking (those that know me) YOU... more daring??!!  But I am not outwardly like this in all things. There are things I keep to myself - those dreams I write about, those things that cross my mind and sneak on me when I least expect it. Those things pointed out to me by others who see clearly what I do not. Perspective is so very varying and subjective. You never know who's is the right one, especially when in your own mind/heart/soul, it's telling you what you'd rather not acknowledge because its more complicated to deal with.   In my known journals I can be carefree, I can let the more surface emotions out, i can be beautiful, sexy, alluring, commanding, brave. In my hidden journals...I can be those things, enhanced...I can let my secrets out and shout them into a void of cyber space that will never be able to know from whence it came. Yet sometimes I can get opinions on it as well. I'd rather not make friends with anyone on my hidden blogs. I don't need strangers telling me what I already know inside.   Can you understand that? The need for privacy, or at least, the need for someone to tell your secrets to who won't answer back. Why do you think the Queen has so many pillows or stuffed animals in her domain? Or those blank masks on the walls? They are a face to talk to - eyes that cannot see your pain, noses that cannot smell the fear, lips that cannot speak words you dont want to obey, ears that words fall deafly onto and no arms to reach out and comfort you lest you break down and tell all.   If you cannot comprehend my reasoning behind the secrets - then you must live a truly charmed life with no cares, worries, inhibitions or fears. Never having been rejected, never having been crazed with uncertainties or regrets, never having felt true joy either. True joy can only come after one has suffered long for it.   I don't know whether to envy you your life...or feel extreme sadness and pity for one who really has never lived.

       Queen of Pervs?   Looking out my tower, as I do way up high amoung the clouds...I've begun to notice the new warriors. Is it wrong that I notice how turly magnificent these young specimen are? I don't think so. I think they are mine for the plucking, I am Queen afterall...do I not deserve this much? At least if I am to remain a Queen without a King...I should be able to frolic in the fields of youthful desires and lust for as long as it will allow me. I'd play with those of my age too if they wanted me, however it seems I attract youth these days. I'm oft tempted to inform those suitors my age, the girls they are chasing who are years younger, have no interest in them at that level....however....I'm not the angel of mercy.   What else works against me? My Height...I'm not your ruler for nothing you know. My stature works to my advantage in all intimidation tactics, but when it comes to the more delicate matters...it kills me. No matter the woman - she could be the tallest Queen, the most ruthless ruler, strongest in mind, body and soul - she also desires to be treated as the most precious gem, the softest petal of an orchid, tenderly and like a woman. That's not a luxury ease to come by but c'est la vie.   I venture out tonight, again...this time with more peaceful intentions to catch up with neighbouring rulers and friends. I was told to expect a surprise - not sure why I'm ready for anything!   adieu - break a rule today (not a self improvement rule, like ohh i dunno, smoking/gambling/drinking) Any other Rule!

       Mmmmmm...   Your Queen is once again having issues with her chaste life. Moreso after the recent night and hours of deep, deep dreaming. Really in-depth, thoroughly sensual thoughts penetrated my dreamscapes while I slumbered. I wonder how the dream research is coming along for I have many questions. I have a need, a yearning inside me, that desires to be fulfilled.    Thank goodness for the storms

       Over Compensation   Can you say that boys and girls? The phrase for today is OVER COMPENSATION!!! Ever seen someone that's doing that? it's like watching a car wreck that's about to happen and there's nothing you can do - or want to - to stop it! I banish all Tarantino films from my Queendom - everytime you watch them, you think...ok see this is redeeming..ohhh no, there he goes, ruins it all with some silly piece of work.  I smack myself for it for I knew better. I was more interested in my popcorn.

       Je Suis Tres Furieux   Hell hath NO fury like the Queen Enraged!!! I have two blogs, two livejournals (yeah get over it, the queen reigns all lands everywhere) and all of them reflect the same at the moment - Sheer ANGER!!  My teeth chatter from it, my arms shake from it, my body trembles with a rage barely controlled by my constant journal updates or I fear something would feel my wrath such as it has never been unleashed before. Music soothes the savage beast? Not so the savage immortal!  What drives a person to be a complete and utter moron!!? What level of cowardice exists in a being that they can actually live with themselves and worse yet .. WORSE YET...think themselves in the right!??!?!?!?!?!?!  Hide little men of the world - let your hangups ride your back like so many bickering monkeys, convincing you of your use to this world with your deluded views! HIDE I say from the one you are attempting to say is wrong - HIDE and dither away your lives under your moss ridden pebbles in the shadow of someone else's greatness that intimidates you!  Risks? HA! You know not of them!! Your cowardice will not even allow you to acknowledge their existence let alone what events could occur should you take them  Fault? HA HA! You know not how to accept blame onto yourself only how to cast it out to those who do what you most wish you could!   Ego? BAH! You know not humility on any level! You dare not recognize yourself as anything less than the epitome of 'wronged soul'.....pity me, I'm hurt, I'm scorned, I'm bruised, I'm wronged! OH WOE!  That's it - this Queen has no such substantive emotion left for such people. They do not deserve to be in my realm and I wish them out. They enrage me, they stress me and they cause me to think thoughts that are otherwise uncharitable to my immortal soul. I cannot believe I ever let such Cowardice into my life in the form of friend, king and companion. That shall never, NEVER happen again.   I am somewhat calmed now - I venture forth to the world to exact some small measure of vengeance onto any ignorant fool that dares to cross my path.   Beware my Minions...I come for thee.

       Auuggghhhh!   There are more frustrating things than having the same dream over and over again - and that's starting to have them then having a clone of yourself fight to hit pause on the dream halfway through - with the sense that something new will happen. So now I am not allowing myself to have a dream I've had since I was a wee lass...or at least a teenaged lass. Now as Queen, how can I fight myself? I know my strengths and weaknesses, my soft spots and my demons that I avoid.  I wake up heart racing, sweating slightly, tears streaming down my face screaming in my head one phrase...  Then I talked to a friend who called at the right moment and stuck the worse ideas in my head in links to all my dreams!! Damn their timing on phone calls and damn their inadvertant guesses that forced things galloping to the forefront.   Ack, anon and alack!What saves me Minions? Cinammon toothpaste with minty flavour shiny things and my thoughts.

       Gratitude   A Quick note to those closest to my heart - Don't ever go away, don't ever change who you are, don't ever doubt that I value you above all else. Thank you sincerely, you are my all and keep me .. me, as I'm sure I keep you...you.    Dreams - again   They certainly do a number on you don't they!?! Dreams are just utterly fascinating and I do believe as Queen I'm going do appoint an entire team to analyze and study them with some sort of result. The things that go through a person's mind while they sleep are just astounding!! the dreams are so very creative and wild, sometimes exciting, action packed and other times sad and reflective. The occassional terrifying ones do happen - mainly because of the demons you are forced to come face to face with. Well, the Queen is tired of dreaming but doesn't ever want it to end - so instead - she must know why it happens!! Why so often, why a certain dream over another - what part of your brain decides that?   Things to ponder and find out - this I am sure of. How do you dream? What do you dream? Tell me everything - tell me twice, thrice! You never know, maybe your dreams can answer mine? Hmm now  that's  an interesting concept.  Adieu Mes Minions

I have blogged before about the importance of enjoying the day, recognizing your inner child and playing etc and your Queen has found the perfect cartoon to represent that!    urlLink Julius the Monkey   (Minky) and his friends help me with this point - oh and Paul Frank of course.  Click on Cartoons then  "I love You" oh and don't get distracted with the Monkey Mixer. Play the episode and be joyous and skip and hop and buy a lollipop and be joyous.

       What ever happened to those giant jawbreakers?    Ok so I just returned from a subject's house, where I did something and it's brought back a resolution of mine. What I'd like to get into again, is something that I started doing for my bday several years ago and didn't get a chance to maintain it over the years due to the fact that I had a bad king and then I was broke...but...I think it's nice if on your birthday you get something for your parental unit(s) and for the people in your lives who make every other day worth it for you. We so rarely take time out to show gratitude lately to those who mean the world to us and it's so very important. Even if it's a pet - get them a treat and just spend an hour or however long being with them. I know Mothers day and Fathers day are there for that "thanks" but somehow I don't like the conformity of the holiday. Who says you can't say "thankyou" more than once? Lemme ask this - when was the last time you went into a card shop and bought a "thank you" card? There is an entire section dedicated to it and it's not just for when someone does you a favour, or when you get amazing gifts - it's to say Thanks...Just because. I sound like a Hallmark advert but hey, I've seen the effects of what it can do to a person. I remember being consellor for a few teens and battered women, or when I was a reader at a retirement home. I swear to you - seeing them get something tiny like a written note or a random last minute-garden-picked flower, or a hug...ohhh that hug - made such an impact to their entire week, let alone their days.  People tell me the things I've done are considered generous or selfless...and to that I have to laugh in their faces. Because it is by far the most selfish thing I do. I feel so good inside after, smile a whole lot more, demons get shoved aside momentarily - that cannot be something only for them...that is completely selfish. Not necessarily a bad thing for I don't do it with malicious intent or purely for me - but yes...selfless is totally wrong.   I am first and foremost a Queen who seeks to be established that way.  I am off tomorrow for the weekend to sort of - celebrate and be totally irresponsible if I can. Somehow I don't see myself being that irresponsible when I go on my little trip, just realized I'm the eldest one there. tsk tsk tsk. My nature will take over though I shall try not to let it.   Adieu Mes Minions - I leave you with a few quotes that should describe perfectly what I'm mentally going through....    You oughtn't to yield to temptation. Well, somebody must or the thing becomes absurd - anthony hope   We love to overlook the boundaries which we do not wish to pass - Samuel Johnson  Temptations, unlike opportunities, will always give you many second chances - Orlando Battista  We gain the strength of the temptation we resist - Ralph Waldo Emerson

       Multiverse News   New and exciting changes are about to take place for our Queen who has been appointed new duties in addition to her roles in our Multiverse. After long months the Queen has been given a new position training those who are looking to invest and resolve their problems. This new and incredible opportunity will result in a different line of postings on her daily addresses to the public and we will keep you tuned in to all the changes as they come.   The national holiday of the Queen's birthday is coming up (Queen Victoria who ruled before our beloved Highness) and this year our Majesty is heading South, to the land ruled by her King of Devils. She will be spending time with aquaintances and rumours are, our Queen will be meeting contenders for the Throne while there and testing waters. When asked to comment on this, She had this to say,  "I do not confirm the numbers but there are three particular individuals who have caught my eye that I will be making judgement on and who I'm sure will be doing the same to me. That said, I plan to kick off my Royal Duties and adopt a carefree attitude"  We all hope she had a great time and it's without incident.  In other news, sources have confirmed that indeed, behind closed chambers, Her Majesty has been once again in self pleasuring mode and making up for lost time it seems. Reports are there are late night calls that seem to pre-empt these events for the past week. This recently dubbed "Midnight Masquerader" seems to enjoy privileges that require the highest privacy. We confronted the Queen on this issue and here's what She had to say when asked who he was;   "He's just a friend and has been for a while, the benefits we enjoy are strictly that and I'll not tolerate ears pressed to my door"  We believe Her Majesty at this time but will be reporting regularly as to the events as they unfold with this Midnight Masquerader and our Multiverse Leader.   -----------  Midnight Dedication - a song that should remind me of the Midnight Man, however it brings to mind someone else entirely in another context entirely, which is not a bad thing, just...hmm:  Dangerous (sensual mix) - Depeche Mode      The things you do Aren't good for my health The moves you make You make for yourself The means you use Aren't meant to confuse Although they do They're the ones that I would choose  I wouldn't want it any other way You wouldn't let me any way  Dangerous The way you leave me wanting more Dangerous That's what I want you for Dangerous When I am in your arms Dangerous Know I won't come to harm  The lies you tell  Aren't meant to deceive They're not there For me to believe I've heard...your vicious words You know by now It takes alot to see me hurt  I couldn't take it any other way But there's a price I have to pay   Dangerous...(repeat chorus)

       Mmmm Rain   I love that it gets to everyone else. I love that in some way, shape or form, the rain manages to make someone feel something deep inside. I don't care that it's annoyance or sheer joy.   What this Queen loves the most is how almost everyone she knows associates any amount of rainfall or storming with her. It's not entirely far off from the truth...I really do try to portray a piece of myself to those that I care about on a level. The best way I can do that is by varying ways of rain. Oh I'm sure no one actually believes I send it there, but it's nice all the same to know I'm thought of at least once in a while. What better way to be remembered than by the deep, thrilling roll of thunder, the brilliance of a lightning streak in the dark cloudy skies or be seen in the single drop of rain off a finger tip? It's my honour and I can ask for no greater legacy as Queen than to be tied with so fine an element.   *curtsy*  You all do me honour

      ---------------------------------------------------------------  It's twelve o'clock, and it's a wonderful day. I know you hate me, but I'll ask anyway. Won't you come with me, to a place in a little town. The only way to get there's to go straight down. There's no bathroom, and there is no sink. The water out of the tap is very, hard to drink, Very hard to drink.  You, wait 'til tomorrow      Silverchair - Tomorrow  ---------------------------------------------------------------  This Queen hasn't figured out why that song always pops into my head when I think about my trip tomorrow morning. I like the metaphor and significance behind it. There is also another song that comes charging to the forefront but I will post that on my journal site.   Am I nervous about this trip? Terribly. My Bad Ass was quite right - I have no control here, the loss of it is making me nuts.  What is a Queen without her control? Lost. I didn't book the ticket, I felt kind of bad to NOT go because I know they can ill afford to give me such a generous gift but they too have pride and wanted to do this for me. I don't know the area, I don't know the town, I didn't get much chance to do research or check into it. I just don't have anything tangible to hold onto. Thank goodness my ticket got here yesterday because that's something solid I can hold in my hand and take to the airport with me. I have achieved that much more control but still...I am very nervous about this. Nervous isn't even the word, because I know my friend well and I think we'll be more than fine, I think Apprehensive is slightly more appropriate. Not so much of her, but of other elements of my trip.   My birthday curse is not easily lifted and I know she is doing this so that I do have a great birthday for once. Ironic that this year I would have really loved to gone out and partied heavily with a few particular people who I will not be seeing either way so no use in that. I'll be happy if nothing goes wrong or no one is upset. You know I'm going to psyche myself into having a terrible birthday at the rate I'm going. It really shouldn't be a big deal, really it shouldn't. But when it happens so very often, with such scarring memories...you tend to focus a bit on that particular week. What's worse - my yearly "bad week" is coming up in June. That's where it's just a bad bad week, extreme bad things happen during those dates and bad memories are associated with them.   Ok enough on bad days. This Queen grows weary of it all. Onto interesting things...I will attempt recording my travels for you all to revel in my exciting life. Snicker if you will, but you are reading it for a purpose.   Adieu my Minions, I will tolerate no disobediences or attempts to overthrow. Remember, my presence may not be physical but I am with you always in all ways.

       Have a little Faith In Me...    Your Queen lords herself over you all, high in her tower, with an efficiency and arrogance befitting of such a role. There are things however that makes her no better than the lowest Serf in her Multiverse. Inside we are all the same, we all have blood flowing for the same purpose and our hearts beat for the same results.   Do you believe in God? With all your heart, do you believe in a deep Faith?  Do you believe in Good triumphing over Evil? In this world so very over run with such miseries, misfortunes and misappropriations? In a world so preoccupied with small, unimportant things that irritate them more than anything has a right to? I may be Queen in name only, appointed by myself and another for the joy of it all. But this weekend - I believe I've earned some sort of small claim to the title.   After seeing and being part of Good defeating sheer Evil, in a form akin to that seen in movies on exorcisms...do I need more to believe...to have Faith? There's a deep doubt in me still, perhaps fear to acknowledge that which is not mine to control. I hunger for more, yet I do not. I cannot go through again what I already have. I cannot face another challenge that great without preparation. Your Queen has done nothing but drink since early morning and she doesn't plan to stop until she can pass out in either alcohol poisoning or drunkeness. What's worse is the timing of two others' comments on Faiths...two very specific people this Queen humbled herself before a higher power begging for strength from.   My Subjects...Minions, Warriors, Peasants alike...don't ever give in to true wickedness. If you are given signs, warnings or inspirations - heed them. If nothing else believe in YOURSELF and your belief IN yourself, and that you are essentially Goodness.  Am I Your Queen?

      To "QueenPixiesSecret"    To the one that sent me flowers last week, who's email is listed as "queenpixissecret"...  I can only assume you've gotten my information cumulatively from both online and real world. I cannot work out who you are and it's rather confusing because of all that you know.   I appreciate the flowers. I appreciate the effort in making that CD I received with that song I do so love. I also appreciate the emailed lyrics to those songs and your sentiments of devotion.   That being said, I would very much appreciate you revealing yourself to me via email or voice mail. The CD came to my home with no return address or stampings and from your little note I gather you know when I leave work or at least, from where. I'll assume that's where you got the knowledge of where to deliver the flowers. The card sent to work address and the emails sent to my work address...hmm. What I can't tie together is how you know my online information in light of my real world one. Perhaps you could fill me in on the reason for your email address and the knowledge of my own. As to your questions after the song "I Think I Love You"...the first two are flattering, the 3rd - I don't know until I know you, the 4th - again I can't answer that until I know who you are. I won't answer it until then.  I know you think this is all mysterious and lovely, very spontaneous and affectionate - I must admit it's beginning to make me rather nervous, one might even say alarmed. I'm asking you to stop, based on the love you claim for me, please stop or at least...let me know who you are.   If it's a friend of mine playing a trick - it ceased being funny when I got the last note.  Thanks in advance, look forward to becoming better acquainted.

       Update the missing data entries for the Queen -  urlLink CLICK ME    ----------   Get Fucked  by  Bad Cabbage    it's a song by an aussie group I believe, though I could be wrong, I'm more concerned about receiving it...once again, anonymously.     I just want to be seen by you while you just want to be seen Everybody else notices you but you just don’t notice me I just want to be right for you while you just want to be right I’ve got plenty of pictures of you, a pin up for every night I just want to sleep next to you, while you just sleep and say next You’ve sucked half of the neighbourhood my friend says you are the best I just want to be loved by you and you just want to be loved Everybody knows its true, you’re a bitch and you are a slut I just want to be fucked by you while you just want to get fucked You’re so rude you want to get fucked so rude just go and get fucked I just want to be fucked by you while you just want to get fucked You’re so rude you want to get fucked so rude just go and get fucked Get fucked.  I just want to be fucked by you while you just want to get fucked You’re so rude you want to get fucked so rude just go and get fucked I just want to be fucked by you while you just want to get fucked You’re so rude you want to get fucked so rude just go and get fucked I just want to be fucked by you while you just want to get fucked You’re so rude you want to get fucked so rude just go and get fucked I just want to be fucked by you while you just want to get fucked You’re so rude you want to get fucked so rude just go and get fucked Get fucked. Get fucked. Get fucked.  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Nice hmm? Actually I really love the song now that I've heard it. There are quite a lot lately that's been putting me in strange moods. I'm oddly comforted by the ability to write on here and not talk to anyone. Don't get me wrong...I can always talk, that's something that shan't escape me. . . but...you know.

      The Queen hires people on occassion to impress her with their abilities.  At this time I would dearly love to&nbsp;commend someone on their fantastic work on a project I'm having done for someone else, but alas I cannot as it's a surprise project and I know it would get ruined. Already everything seems to be working against me in terms of it staying a surprise. I forwarded it to my Huntress to get an opinion on something and my stupid address field filled in the first few letters automatically to my surprisee's address. GRRR. How infuriating!!   I will be posting a link to this business very soon and I hope you will all consider this link seriously in your next surprise gift effort. It's not something you get often and is worth the effort involved.   I'll have the surprisee himself make his own personal comment and input at a later time but trust me...the Queen orders you all.   &nbsp;

      The Queen is exhausted...worn out mentally and emotionally.   She needs this break now that she's venturing to visit her little sister in Indiana. I expect lil sis needs it too with recent tragedies at hand. Good news - lil sis is getting herself married and I think she's happy about it all. Bit worried though that she's not handling things appropriately in terms of her feelings on the current tragedy. Dunno what else to do beside grabbing her and shaking her a bit - which may come in after a day or two that I'm there.   Yes I'm looking forward to seeing others as well who will be there for my own reasons. I have no idea what I'm wearing for this wedding but I'm sure I will find something. I must match if the guys are going to be in tuxes...ergo...must wear a dress.   I had a bizarre dream last night which I think I shall write about in my LJ or perhaps somewhere else...bit unsure how private this should get with the public.  &nbsp;

      The Queen is back from her visit.  For wedding details please see my live journal " urlLink Queen of Demons ".  *sigh*  I miss the boy. I miss Chomper. Why am I attracted to him? Let's get technical.  Cons...    Bad boy type that i really should not go back to  Lives in Indiana  smokes heaps  nowhere near committment phase due to...  some baggage from psychotic ex's   Bad bad bad boy  stubborn (won't accept my help right now)  proud (hates his lil sis can and has helped him)  family issues that need to get sorted  not the type to present to daddy n mommy.  Not even sure he sees this as anything more than a really good 'weekend fling' each time       Pros...   Hot (Hhhhhhot!)  Excellent lover (sorry not shallow but that's important)  I admire and respect the hell out of him  Neat, keeps things in order  proactive with things that need to get done  Handy at anything he puts his mind to  He talks cars with me despite I'm a girl  He makes me laugh and laugh  takes care of his ex g/f's daughter like his own  wants a good woman to love, house of his own and his done up cars, doesnt care about what the work is as long as it pays well enough to support his family. gotta respect that  natural protector, feel totally safe with him  I trust him almost instantly  awesome wiry body, awesome long hair     OK so really, some of those pros are shallow but..but...but...but....    I like him.  more and more each time I visit or talk to him.    *sssssiiiiigghhh*   Queen's finally losing power.
