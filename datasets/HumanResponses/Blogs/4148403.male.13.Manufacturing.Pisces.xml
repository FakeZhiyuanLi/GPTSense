      On I believe the Philips portable DVD player it has a selection control that has a small circle that slides to the left, right, up, and down. You could do the same thing for a mouse on a laptop. It's flat, easy to control, and would fit inside a shut laptop.

      Everyone knows what kinds of mouses laptops can have. I was trying to buy a gaming laptop and I realized, there is no such thing as a  good  internal laptop mouse   for gaming. I mean there's the control stick, my personal preference, but then your hand is right in the middle of the keyboard to use it. There's also the control screen, the touch screen mouse instead, but that one is less sensitive, harder to control, and if you're typing your wrist can bump it and it is default set to click when it's tapped. I had the idea of having an extending trackball. It pulls from the side and then pops up for use. A trackball isn't really the most commonly acknowledged type of mouse, but it does work.

      I saw the Mac computer George Bush was using on the main pic at  urlLink www.theonion.com  and it gave me a funny idea for a computer. Picture a dome that sits on your desk. The screen is inside at the top, and it comes from a trapdoor up and out towards you. The keyboard pulls from the bottom and is a U shape until you bend the two side sections in to make a regular keyboard. A mouse pulls out from a compartment underneath as well. Closes up neatly into the dome, but comes out to be a fully featured computer. Through a hole in the desk it is on is the power cable and ultimate add-on wire. The add-on wire has a hub where you plug in all the game controllers, internet, etc.

      I actually got this one from a friend of mine, Scott Adams. The idea was to have something that tied a necktie for you, but I decided to take it to the next level. It has the ability to tie several knots, download more from the website, and be programmed to tie a knot that you tie. All you do is clamp on two automatic bending wires to the ends of the thing you needed tied. To program your own knot setting all you have to do is attach them to the item, then tie the knot. Using technology like in the Lego Mindstorms record and play setup, it can record the positions it is in.

      The firefighter force is an important job. The lead man (the man at the end of the hose) has to run into the burning building. Aside from his heat-gear to keep from burning a fog-man follows him with a mist machine to lay mist across him, lightly putting out the fire around him. As far as the military goes, the less cost the better. Cost includes manpower. If a helmet attached to the hose so that it let out a layer of mist, the previous fog-man could now aid in the removal of the fire.

      I saw on TechTV a paid programming ad for the Microsoft Microphone Array. It has five microphones at distant areas that record and contrast the sounds so it gets a crisper sound with less of what you don't want in it. It gave me an idea for a webcam array. At first I thought I might want to just have five multi-angled webcams across the top of the monitor (like how they do the microphones). Later I decided I would rather have a dome. It would be fairly large, and the inside would be covered with camera lenses. The user looking at the image on the other end could then control where they looked at you from by changing what lens they looked through. This seemed like the best idea, but for myself I even thought of a better, or rather more nerdy way to do it. You could have wallpaper that has very small lenses in it so you have lenses all across your room. People could adjust the angle they looked at you from to anywhere around the room. A problem with that would be no one could hide from the webcam, and could cause some paranoia.

      This idea is actually different than the one or two man submarine. This, however, is just a chair with a propellor on the bottom. You still need dive gear to breath and see, but this propels you through the water. I'm not sure if I want it to be you steer it yourself by moving your body, or if you steer it and it either adjusts the fan positioning or moves vertical and horizontal rudders. The idea still needs a little work but I think it's easier to realize than the sub and also it would cost a lot less.

      Following with the diver's theme from before, a snorkel jetpack falls into category. It goes on your back like a backpack, and has a battery, scuba tank, emergency air tank, emergency air release tank, and a propellor. It pushes you along with the propellor, also carrying your compressed air. In the case of an emergency when your air runs out, it switches to the minute long air resevoir, and takes the compressed emergency release tank and shoots all of the air out, launching you forward at intence speeds. This could be a bad idea if the diver is facing downwards when they let out the release resevoir, launching them deeper into the water. While it shoots out the air it could also be filling a shoulder tank that fills to float, so it floats your head up, aiming it upwards, and making you float faster. Also that would keep your head above water once you are at the surface.

       I thought of this one while I was browsing the Invent This! forums at  urlLink www.g4techtv.com . Someone came up with the idea of peanut butter slices, like cheese slices. I thought you could make two slices, meat and cheese, packaged together and condensed so they become one. Between the two slices could be the condoments. Just take it from the container, put it on some bread, and enjoy. They could also be packed with bread slices as well.

      For a while I've had the idea of a one or two man submarine. Just a small, airtight compartment with a seat or two inside with scuba tanks for air and a large fan on the back for propulsion. For some reason I always envisioned it as orange, even though personally I hate the color. With the proper materials I actually believe that I could create such a thing. Very simple idea, very simple product, although large.

      We all know that people enjoy being mobile. Laptops, although accomplish the job, are very expensive compared to desktops. I have had two ideas to allow someone to be mobile around their house with a desktop computer.  1. Wireless Keyboard w/Screen - A wireless keyboard with a laptop style mouse and a folding screen that is used when walking around, but when you sit down it folds back so you can use your regular monitor. 2. Wireless Keyboard w/Projector - A similar keyboard except instead of having a screen it has a projector at the end if it so it can be used on walls and such.  One issue with this would be the price of the keyboard...would it be much less than just getting a laptop? If it is much less, great, if not it would be about as much as a cheap laptop, but you'd be getting  much  more power.

      There are currently automatic adjusting sunglasses that adjust as you walk into lighter and darker areas. This is bad for a few reasons. If you're up late at night and you're using a computer (like I am right now) then they would adjust to be darker because of the screen. Polarized lenses are glasses and sunglasses lenses that are made of thin fibers of glass, and don't let glare get into them as much. When you take two and hold them against each other at a ninety degree angle they overlap and become black, letting no light through. When you have gears on a pair of polarized sunglasses with two lenses you can rotate on of the lenses to make it contrast and darken the lenses. If the lenses are just clear then it doesn't brown the lens, it just makes it darker.

      A coaxial blade is a helicopter technique that uses two blades on the same axle to create more force with less power. If you applied this technology to a ceiling fan, it would be much more powerful. Even more powerful would be if you put a bending spreader between the two blades so that the air spreads across the room to create a very powerful breeze that covers the whole room. You could re-apply this technology into window fans, boat propellor's, and even pocket fans.

      I was at Brookstone or Woodstone, not sure what it is. The stores that sell nifty gadgets, kind of like the Sharper Image but less technology. But I was there the other day, and I've been working on a few inventions recently, one of which involved a pocket fan. Most pocket fans are frowned upon because they are poorly built. People think that the pocket fan itself doesn't work, but really it is how it is made. This taught me that. It was a ring with a fan blade inside of it and was fairly powerful. A coaxial propellor (as in helicopters and airplanes) are two blades on the same axle. They are more powerful for less energy. If you made a coaxial propellor inside your flippers you could make dive flippers that propel, but when the battery dies all you have to do is unfold them and use them as regular flippers.

      Every diver in the world has had the problem of their mask being fogged up. Right now there's the ability to spit into the mask, then rub it around with your finger. This only works temporarily, and is found "disgusting" to some. The other option is to buy a tube of antifog slime that you rub around the lens to clear it, then rinse out the remains of the goop. This works fine, but is time consuming. The reason fog forms on a mask is that the body heat radiates from your face and condenses against the cold mask lens (cold because of the water around it). On the Antifog Mask, however, there is an extending heat beacon. It heats the water around the mask to keep it from condensing.

      The idea for the pool snorkel was very old, but until now I never realized how to make it a possibility. The idea was to have a long (about 4 or 5 feet) flexible rubber snorkel tube that attached to a float at the surface. The reason this couldn't work is that when you breathed in the tube would fill with fresh air, then you would breath out and it would get halfway out, then breath in again. You're breathing in the air you just breathed out. A very simple way to fix this problem is to put two purge valves near the mouth. You breath in, and it comes in from the tube, but since there's the purge valves, you breathe out, and it goes out an exit valve to the side of the snorkel.
