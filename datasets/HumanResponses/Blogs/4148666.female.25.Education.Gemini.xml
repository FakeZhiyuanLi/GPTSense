          I've made a lot of friends during the years. Most of them just pass me by and don't even bother to say hi. Could it be something that I did wrong?             Sometimes all we need is someone who just CAN listen. No just someone who shuts the door and opens it back when needed. I try notto be like others. I try to stand out. I try to preserve my jokes, my dreams, my life and even my own sorrows. I try not to hurt or bother. But sometimes its too much for one heart to try to keep. And it feels like its going to explode! It is then when I see for you and then when I get only that door shut over and over again. And it makes us feel like we are born alone and will die alone. If if that's how it is meant to be then I must have to learn not to cry or worry when things like that happen to me.        And to you, my dream friend, the one I can only count on, I do not want you to keep reading these 'cause if I wanted you to do so and talk about so I would probably call you up and say so, so please I feel like I am being chased and watched all the time. Please leave a corner of my mind and world only for myself and strangers to make opinions of and know of. Stop wanting to know everything!           x     x

        Not much around here to say that things change. I got a phone call today from the guy who used to call himself my friend. I wonder if he thinks I am stupid?  I know he hates me... But I can't make the world love me.          So I feel like I should jump back on a plane and wonder around for a bit. I wish I could. I wish I had the money and the belief in myself... But we will see. God has strange ways to let me know I will be ok.           I promise here today that I will try not to hurt anymore people. I will, of course, try to be better! I have hope that someday I willhave my own children. I love babies. I think I need alittle rest, don't ya think?          X Baby Kiss

        The weekend it's been almost the same as every other day, nothing interresting... Just me and another "normal day"... whatever that is.          Why is it that people insist in telling others "I love you" If  they don't actually know what they are doing or saying?  Do you realize you hurt another but not telling them how you really feel? How the relationship is working out  through your eyes? How it feels in your heart? Why the cheating? Why the lying? Why the proof of love if you are the first one not loving? Do you realize that is another soul the one you are hurting? Scaring for life?           My friend got hurt today and I really dont know what to say to him... All he wanted was love, instead he got cheated, lied to, hurt, humilliated. He had lost all his friends because his partner didn't want him wih them. He made enemies out of his family and pushed the ones that loved him away because we were not of his like.... Now he feels alone... How can you tell someone they  are never alone?          I love him... Like a brother.... I will pray for him because one didn't back away from him and that was God.          x Angel Kisses

        Yup!            It's all in the room... Don't you feel like you can't breath sometimes? Like all you do is just lay there and do nothing? Like if the world vanishes you will still be there, on that same spot just because you got forgotten? Lately I've been feeling like that!

          I am almost done with the re-construction of my website. I knew it was going to take time...     It feels like home in here... cool eh? Well, unless a plane crashes on my backyard I won't be posting anymore for tonight.           Cheers     X

         After a little while I felt I needed to do some changes around in my life... You know, just when you wake up and everything seems unimportant... With the encouragement of some good friends and God I decided to have a complete makeover... I am making over my life...
