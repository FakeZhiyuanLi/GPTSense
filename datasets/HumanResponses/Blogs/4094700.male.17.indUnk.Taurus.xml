      Greetings:   As some of my friends know I eat a lot,    to most an astonishing amount…not to the point of gluttony however (except for once at this all you can eat pizza joint.) I’m just a big kid that’s very active and needs to have the “gas tank” full at all times. Coincidentally, food moves in and out of our house rather quickly. A gallon of milk one A loaf of bread last about two days and ice cream….well it’s gone that night. So in order to assure I will always have food readily available I’m in charge of doing the grocery shopping. This is a rather fun form of entertainment for me. Here in McMinnville we have a 24/7 grocery store which is my home away from home if you will. I’ve visited this refuge of assorted goods practically every hour. There are a lot of alcoholics that visit this store around 1 or    2 o’clock   . Every time I go into Winco I’m always tempted to buy what I don’t need. The Double Stuff Oreos, the Nutterbutters, bananas and other various health foods…so in order to combat the forces of Satan I always write out a grocery list before I leave the house, even if it’s only milk and bread. I find that I get exactly what I need and don’t get what I don’t need this way. I took this idea and made it a practical life application, a    “grocery list” for a girl friend. Everything I want I have wrote down in this list. These range from very important i.e. Straight Female, God Loving Christian, not Mormon or “moron” to this less important like: brown hair with blonde streaks,    has not only heard of Five Iron Frenzy but actually owns one of their cds (a burnt on counts.) Perhaps this method is stupid because it makes me narrow-minded and because of this I will never find the right girl or perhaps it will immediately weed out the Double Stuff Oreos and lead me to the “perfect” girl. Maybe concept shouldn’t be put into practice until I’m at that time in my life when I’m looking for somebody to marry. Maybe I should experience having (or at least trying to) a relationship with all types of girls. I may find out that I don’t like brown with blonde streaked hair that comes just to the shoulder, but rather jet black hair that’s a Mohawk. What if that girl that’s truly meant for me doesn’t like music, typically I would never even consider her, but what if God actually designed her for me and I passed over her and ended up dating somebody that I liked but not loved. What if.    I cannot continue this sick cycle of the “what if” game.    I apologize for ending this post abruptly but I most go and write down my “grocery list” for girls. I believe it will be beneficial to me as long as I’m not completely specific i.e. if I say peanut butter I get peanut butter but it doesn’t matter either way if I get crunchy or creamy.          I will later tonight post my grocery list. Perhaps you might know of anybody that might possibly work. Perhaps its you.                    “I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus” Philippians 3:14

      it's 1:00p.m, as of right now....i'm tired but i'm obviously not in bed. The reason: you can defeat the desire to sleep (at least temporarily) with the correct mixture of hardheadedness, caffine and starring at a computer screen.  I've seen many a time where Patrick O has spent all nigght editing videos. i'm blabbering.... this is a true tell sign of sleep deporvation. i'm going to go resolve this problem by going to sleep. Incidently i cant fall asleep without music. i've made a playlist of "sleep" music. this includes Ben Folds, Jack Johnson , John Mayer, Dave Matthews, Howie Day, Elliot Smith and many other. actually this list is longer then 3 days... but it's allways on shuffle and typically i fall asleep within three songs...so why is it so long you ask? becuase i have a crapload of music. hows 46.06 gigs sound? yeah. thats right top that. good night

         My sincerest apologies…I have not updated this blog in some time. I hate to give you the reader some lame excuse like being to busy the majority of the time, and those times where I weren’t so because laziness, but sadly those are my excuses. Deal with them.      Let me fore warn you that from this upcoming Saturday for a week and a half I will not be able to update. I will be in   California   at this supposedly amazing Christian Youth Camp. For how much I paid for it it should be the next closet thing to Disney World. But hey, anytime where there are about 1000+ Christian guys and girls and God is present (when is he not?) it bound to be awesome.      Okay…so what has been keeping me so busy lately? I’ll tell ya’. For one, I have a real life full time job. But unlike real life adults, I only have insurance and a cell phone bill to pay for so I get to save a lot. So I’m usually up by five and out the door by 6. for the last two weeks I’ve been working in Portland so it takes about an hour to get there so make it 7. work from 7 to 5 and get home around 6. yes, you can count correctly that makes me have a 12 hour work day. Two of which consist of road rage and the other 10 consist of construction like things. The foundation was already there when I got on the job so I got to do framing, roofing, floors, and today started on plumbing. Plumbing I hate more then anything because I’m underneath the house which there’s only about two feet between the ground and the floor. I’m using a torch to solder the copper pipes together. This makes for some interesting times… thankfully I only got one big drip of metal on my hand. Uniformity I forgot I was underneath the house and sat straight up, well not straight up…I didn’t make it that far. But what was the coolest thing today was that we got shut down today around 4. 3 city trucks pulled up, 6 guys jumped out. They promptly told us to drop everything that we were doing because we were violating the law. Turns out the contractor aka my boss, didn’t have the right permits, aka no permits at all. And I was illegally nailing nails and welding pipes together. All these guys were from different departments of the city and they each fined us for something entirely different. To sum it up 2,500 dollars later, and about 3 weeks later we can resume our work on this house. Thankfully Friday…wait today was my last day do to   Hume   Lake   and school starting up.                  Tomorrow I get to be a girl. It’s not everyday that a guy gets to do this but for a guy like me if you get the chance you cant pass it up. I get to go clothes shopping! My mom has unwillingly let me take an adventure into the big city and go shopping. Some would just go to the Clackamas mall or washing square. Perhaps if I run out of things to do I might, but my plan of attack is to go to most random out of the way places. I’m going to see if I can use a whole tank of gas tomorrow. Tigard,   Beaverton  , Tualatin, Woodburn, Wilsonville,   Vancouver   and   Portland   will all be visited by me tomorrow. I want to go into the ghetto clothing stores and see what I can find, I want to go to the rich Westside neighborhood goodwill’s, I want to go the buffalo exchange (some new hip goodwill type place, but before all of that, I’m going to Krsipy Kremes tomorrow morning. Hot out of the oven! Oh baby oh baby. And perhaps tomorrow for lunch I will eat at Hooters. Now many people could make this a very ordinary trip to the big city. I want this to be as fricken memorable as possible. For one, this is the first time my mom has ever let me drive to   Portland   alone. (yeah, a lot safer with a cute girl in the truck, constantly looking over at her…uh huh, you know who you are, are you okay now?) And for two I have money. A great combination. The one thing I want more then anything else is a pink long sleeve dress shirt. My youth pastor has one and it’s rockin. Apparently pink is the new black, I read that. I mean I heard that in cosmos or 17…Wish me luck

       Note: please read the “Grocery List Concept” Prior to this.                   I changed my list a little bit. I didnt like it.         I’m not sure how I will go about listing all the things that I want in a girl….this is going to be ugly but I’ll actually make it in the standard grocery list format. This will probably not be in order of importance. Sometime I will take the time and improve on it and re-post it, until then bare with me.          Must      be a Christian, Mormons and Catholics need not apply                 a. Even if you've given 95% of your life to God, it's not good enough becuase you can still give 5 more percent.          Must have a family that is still toghter. BEcuase I only have my Mom, I want have a girl that has a large family that she is very close with. I want to belong to a family thats bigger then Mom and I.  Must be attractive. I like tall and dark gals'.    Must be musically gifted. Talents may include but not limited to Singing (a must), piano or guitar. Must have similar likes and dislikes in music. Some Country is acceptable. But nothing more then the occasional listening to it.  Not only should she like to dance but know how. Or at least be willing to take dance lessons. (thinking of a Joe and Debbie situation here.    Must LOVE the outdoors, activities include but not limited to hiking, picnicking, camping, and drives. But must also be content with the indoors activities included but not limited to sleeping, watching the history and discovery channel and watching movies.

      This Sunday A bunch of guys and I plan on going wakeboarding again....I say wakeboarding but we have no such thing in mind. What we do have in my however is this: Last weekend I all by my lonesome self did what no man should be able to do...leaglly. I waterskied while wearing only a speedo, A speedo that was a size to small mind you. Since then Ben and I have been planning a return trip to the river. This time though I will not be the only one however, 5 guys including myself will be freaking out children and straight men. Hopefully we do not encounter any gay men though...this would be a worst case scenario. And for all the women folk that see us....well i'm not very sure what their reaction will be, i just hope the water isnt all that cold if you get my drift. Earlier when i said " Ben and I have been planning" i would hope that you wouldnt take the word "planning" lightly. Our plaaning has conssited of me going to goodwill and other various stores everyday to pick up the approaite merchandise. At least 2 calls a day to him to tell him the good news of what i found and some of the ideas (that i was able to alliterate) that i came up with during the 10 hour solitary work day. Also this has included calling guys that we thought would be up for it. And tonight i can say we have 5 guys that are 100% commited to this. The neat thing is if you didnt know these guys already you would never guess what their real personality is or their proffesion as you can see below. Ben is a real live farmer who will buy out the family farm this year. He is known as The "Mama's Boy" his gettup will consist of cowboy boots, a speedo, a cowboy hat, and a red cape. Danny Moen (the pastors son who is a youth pastor himself up in the Portland area will be know as The Rain Man. Outfit will include yellow rainboots, yellow speedo, yello vinyl rain jacket, and yellow vinyl rain hat. Tyson will shortly become a socail studies teacher and this past year worked at the highschool as a security guard (for you of those who live in rsbg, dont compare him to steve-o, tyson is cool and doesnt write tickets and has never towed a car, he'll just pull you out of class) Tyson will be dreased up as Goldberger the WWF wrestler. today he found a plastic bodysuit that has like a 18 pack and pecks that are the size of double D's. it's sweet. Issac who is soon to be married doesnt know what he wants to dress up as. so we'll throw him in a pink speedo. And the best for last....ME! A purple pimp hat...it looks as if a purple cat died ontop of my head. A leporad print speedo and silver shoes. It's awesome...oh yeah a Gold Cape that has The "ladies Man" written on the back. So if you live in Mac or the surronding area please come out to the river sunday and see us...if you live in roseburg, be glad i moved away.

         Today I went wakeboarding on the  Willamette . It was an awesome experience. It was the first time I’ve ever tried wakeboarding and I succeeded on standing up within two tries. I was very pleased with myself. So after a while of me just going in and out of the wake and trying to jump a wee bit I became bored. I let the other guys and girls that I was with show off their stuff and it was cool and all. Then I got the crazy notion to take off my shorts and reveal my speedo that I had been wearing all along. It was fun for awhile making other people more uncomfortable then I but that excitement soon dissipated. We saw one guy go by on a slalom ski and we all laughed at him because he’s so old school and unhip. I got the crazy notion to waster ski on two skis while wearing nothing but my speedo. This idea was soon discouraged by the girls but cheered on by the guys. So there I was water skiing behind this boat wearing a speedo and a purple and pink Childs life vest. I would get up to boats as close as I could and yell and throw my arms up like I was roping and do the occasional slap of my butt. I would try to hit wakes and do 180’s (more like 165’s and 0’s) and make a complete fool of myself. It was a great time. Once I got back in the boat we the guys talked about other various dress up ideas like: kids superman briefs with a cape. My speedo with a snorkel mask, nothing at all, a cowboy hat with chaps on (and nothing under the chaps.) we’ve never laughed so hard. But it gets better...Somehow my shorts feel out of the boat so there i was stranded in a speedo. To my dismay we all decided (we'll they, not I) to go and eat at some fast food joint. And no, not drive thru. So i with my head hung low walked into wendy's. I was praying that a. nobody would know who i am and b. i would get kicked out. But apparently a speedo is approiate attire but having no shirt is not. So the point in me telling you this was to not just ramble on about nothing of importance but to give you a good chuckle, becuase if your reading this your probably somebody i know personally and you know that this is something i would do. Also i would like to see if you have any other suggestions for random dressups. Take it easy.
