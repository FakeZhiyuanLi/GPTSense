      I never really understood what people meant when they said they could not explain what they were feeling. Well, that is until tonight. There has never been a day until now that I have truly been this sadden. It really wasn’t anything I read, saw, or did. It just all of a sudden hit me.  I miss people profoundly. Sometimes it takes me awhile to realize they are gone and other times I miss them before they have even left. Many of you may believe that makes me “soft,” but really all that makes me is human. With all the love I humbly share, it is only natural to miss those whom I love.   I am not going to go into vast detail, just know that if you see me in the next few days and I am looking gloom there is nothing you can honestly do. This is not being said to discourage you from talking to me, but rather to help you understand why I am not being myself.   Those I love will leave me sooner or later and truthfully I do not know how I will react. That is what is what scares me. I am so worrisome about my actions and how I control them, but for this I know they will not be controlled. I am not scared of many things, but that is my greatest fear, to lose control again. I vowed to myself that I would never let it happen, but I am afraid it might just be out of my hands. All I can really do is pray for strength, as foolhardy that may seem, that is all I can do at this point.

      It amazes me. At the start of the night I was in a decent mood, but as the day progressed, that mood of tranquility distorted into one of anger. Looking back on it now, there was no particular event that set me off, but rather many little ones, which built up inside until they had no place to go. I didn’t know what to do or what to say and me not saying something, as we all know, is insanity. One should know that if I am not talking then there is something severely wrong at that moment.   No one seemed to pick up on this, well one did, but that is beside the point. My frustration was beginning to become something I couldn’t control happened. It wasn’t a life changing experience or anything liked that, instead it was just simply a smile from someone I love. Just seeing the happiness I had given was enough to allow me to realize my role.   So, what amazes me? Well, not many things anymore. However, here is one thing, one person, who amazes me constantly. Whether it is through action, emotions, or sayings I am completely astounded. All I am really trying to say is, “Thank you for everything, but most important showing me who I really am when I forget.”

      Death…Why can’t people just let go? Not many people know this, but a friend of mine was pronounced dead during my freshman year. Well, of course he is “living” now, but is he really? I say he isn’t. The Alex I once knew is gone. The Alex I looked up too like he was an older brother is gone. The one person who on the first day of school said, “Hi Nick, what’s up?” is gone. I have never come to grips with why he was taken from all of us, but I do now that he has been taken. 	 Okay, so the doctors may say that he is alive, but it is only because machines make it so. It is not because his will to survive is unbreakable. No he has died and for the first time since last year I started to think about him. I found a picture of the two of us just hanging out after a basketball practice. I was just going through pictures and that one fell out. I am not sure whether it was an act of God or whether I just need to leave how to hold something, but nevertheless it made me remember Alex. 	 Some may be grasping on to the hope that he will wake up and everything will be as it was again, believe me I was one of those believers. I still see guys who look eerily like him and I stop what I am doing, look, then realize it was only my mind wanting someone to identify with again. Since he died, no one has been able to identify with me as he did. No one really knows this, and quite honestly I do not know why I am even writing this, but I just felt like needed to do it. Everyone who knew Alex should still pray for him, I do ever night, but they should also remember that he, the Alex we once knew, is gone. Trust me as quiet as I have been about it, I have still struggled. However now, I feel the burden has been someone eased, perhaps as if my friend is just merely supporting me one more time.

      "I know you Nick, trust me." That is what she told me. You know what I told her? "Fuck you, you have no idea who I am anymore!" I know not my average answer. Yes, I am known as the good little christian boy, but that is not who I am. That does not define me, no one thing does. I do not even know who I am. Alright, I am Nick Broderick, but come on you know what I mean.  I look at it this way, I do not fully know who I am, therefore how could someone else know. I do not understand some of the things I do, so who could understand me? Quite honestly I have tricked myself into thinking certain people know who I am and understand me, but that is what we call a magic show. No one knows me, no one probably ever will. I wear my emotions out there for everyone to see, yet no one will attempt to understand why cause they are afraid to learn about the real me. Why is this? Talk to me and maybe you might actually figure out who I really am, what really makes me tick. I do like to talk, you know that don't you? Well, you should.   For those of you that think you don't need to talk to me because you know me, you know what I am going through, you think I will figure it outon my own- "Fuck you!" You have no idea nor will you ever if you keep on thinking that. I have more than one demension, if you cannot understand that then leave me alone cause all you are going to do is confuse me even more when I am finally walking through the last stages of my labyrinth.  "Know thy self," right? Do you know who you are? I sure don't and I know if you think you do, then you better take a deep look back inside and try to figure it out again because I know you don't. No one can truly know who they are until they have walked through the fires of hell and have experienced the pain. So next time, when you go to judge me make sure you judge yourself first or you will get the same response as before.

      "To write is to make oneself the echo of what cannot cease speaking -- and since it cannot, in order to become its echo I have, in a way, to silence it. I bring to this incessant speech the decisiveness, the authority of my own silence."  ~ Maurice Blanchot ~

       I have thought about this for awhile now and I believe that I am going to delete this blog. It has caused too much trouble as every other blog ever created has. It has ruined things I never would have before. Therefore, I am going to go back to my old way of dealing with things.    NOW HOWEVER I AM UNSURE.  The way I used to deal with things was not good and I truly enjoy writing. So, yet again I am asking for others' opinions. What should I do? Keep it or Delete it?

       urlLink    It was awhile ago now, but I still remember it like it was yesterday. My teacher asked the question, ?Why are people afraid to die?? I told him that I really didn?t think people were afraid of death, but rather facing the judgment of God when they are dead. I have never gotten that much respect from that teacher or any teacher in a single statement like I did that day.  It was during the time that my grandfather was in the hospital and I had been thinking about that for sometime. It was just a natural answer. I have always known the right things to say in those situations. It is my gift from God. I am a religious person. I say that with pride. However, many people have told me that I do not deserve the award I received for my faith. To those people all I have to say is that to think I deserve it would mean I shouldn?t have it. I have a strong faith and I do not hide it like so many others.  I say my greatest flaw is being too proud in who I am. I flaunt many things, but my faith is not one of them. Most often you will not even see me wearing a cross. I do not need to wear a symbol to show others what I believe. Everyone knows what I believe because I tell them. I am not afraid to speak my beliefs nor will I ever be. God gave me the gift of faith and I use that gift to the best of my ability.  This has more or less me ranting about all the crap people say to me at school. I figured my friends would be happy for me, but I guess those who aren?t, aren?t my friends. I guess it is just one of those things you do not want to realize, but are forced to. So, as I have said a million times, do not judge me because you think you know, because if you think that you really don?t have a clue. Not even a handful of people really know me, everyone else just thinks they do.   I am a loving caring person, who believes he owes everything to God. The only thing I do not know is whether or not God views me as the same. That is why I am constantly trying to become a better person and Christian, even if you cannot see it. Jesus once spoke about how the true believers were not those who wanted those to know they believed, but instead wanted God to know. I was told that this year and I attribute that quote to why I received the award because I have changed. Others may not see it, but I know I have and that is good enough for me. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Right now I am supposed to be writing a paper on life and death, yet I am finding it difficult to write the essay. It is not because I dont know what to write about, merely that I am distracted. My little sister has left for California, which most would think might make me happy, but it hasnt. My brother is back at home and therefore the house is in shambles. My dad and I are finally started to see eye to eye again. Whats wrong with me? Shouldnt I be happy?  Just look at my home life. By many perspectives it is perfect, so that is not the problem. My friendships, in my opinion, grow stronger with each ear. That cant be the problem either. My school life is going pretty well. I am getting good grades and I just got the lead in the school play. My personal life is wonderful. I adore my girlfriend and she feels the same about me. So, if you step back and look you should see no flaw.   So, I ask againwhy am I so unhappy? I quite truthfully dont know and that is why I am bringing it up for question. This is not a normal thing for me to do, open myself up for others to criticize, but I am taking Simon Wiesenthals lead. After all if he can grow from all he went through, shouldnt I be able to do so? I sure hope I can, but if I am unable to then I will just go back to my normal life: smiling, joking, and just being the person I always am.  What I am trying to say is no pressure.  Thank you for everything you have done and will ever do for me. I really need to say that more and you have my word that I will.   &nbsp; urlLink

      So, by my standards it is pretty late right now, but I felt the strong urge to write. It wasn’t because my day was wonderful, although it wasn’t half bad, but rather that I needed to get something off my chest. No, it is not that I did anything wrong. It is more or less that I can’t take it anymore. I watch her bash herself non-stop, her friends, and lately, to my dismay, me. I never thought it would get to that point, but it has. She feels as if she can tell me how I feel now, what I do, and how I act. Everyone who knows me knows that I hate when people do that, and off all the people I thought she would care enough to honor that.  But that is not even what angers me anymore. I have officially gotten over that. What makes me mad is that I feel invisible when I am around her. Her friends are very tangible, they are introduced, talked to, and laughed with, however for me I have had none of those things for some time. Most may think that I am a whiny little boy. I am not though. If you have ever talked to me you know that to be true.  I am just flat out heartbroken. I feel all I do goes unnoticed. I do not know what it is. Perhaps it is the latest occurrences or perhaps not. I am just baffled, yes, baffled. Over these past days I might as well have been all alone because that is what it has felt like. At least I wouldn’t have someone criticizing my very existence. What I am saying right now, I tried to share, but she wanted me to go. “You need to go to bed.” I was trying to talk to her, yet she would not give me the time of day, which I have grown accustomed to.  It is sad to me that I have gotten used to such things. I do not even know what to do about it. I care very much about her, and she knows it, along with everyone else. Can anyone help me? Can God? Will he help me? Or is it just one of those things I need to figure out. I may never know, but I truly wish I could.  The sweetest joy, the wildest woe is love.

      This kind of stuff always happens to me. When I think I am finally going to get the response I want, I don’t. When I think that I might finally have a meaningful conversation with someone, he or she changes the subject. I have almost gotten to the point where I have lost hope. Yes, hope not faith, for the two are very different. I won the St. Ignatius of Loyola Religious Award, therefore I do have some inkling of what faith is. Hope though is truly more of a wish, a desire if you will.   I have wished for many things to happen, but they have not. I have desired many things and I have not been granted them. Is it me? Is it the others for whom I hope? I do not really know. I feel as if, especially after tonight, that I do not know anything of the sort. That may sound odd to some of you, but if you were in my shoes you would understand.  You see, I now my wants, desires, hopes are seen. However, by some twist of fait, they are not acknowledged. To be completely candid, most of the time I feel as if I am just another extra in the background of the film that is life. Not my life, but just life in general. I am not seen, heard, or even accepted when I desire to be.  I may never understand this. I have come to grips with it some time ago. But every person around me has not. They say great things about me, yet not to me. They wonderful things about me, yet never voice them. Why or what are people so scared of? Is it me? I am surely nothing to be frightened by. I am after all only, Nick, Nicky, Nickbo, Nicker, Andy, Sweety, and the many other names I have been given. Just talk to me as if I were that person because I am. This is not hard to see. I am not seen though.   My hope has been lost, but my faith will ever stay true because it is the only thing I got right now. I have no one to lean on because no one wants to be there. Some might say they do, but they only say so out of obligation or pity. This all can be summed up by my greatest fear, which I normally refuse to tell people, to be forgotten.

       urlLink      Ever had a dream so vivid that you woke up and were sure it was real? As of late, those are the only dreams I have. I used to never remember my dreams. However, for the past couple weeks I have had such dreams that I could tell you every minute detail. Every dream is a complete parallel to reality. The only thing that differs is that I am confronted with my fears everyday. Why is this happening? What did I do? My life has not really changed significantly since the start of the dreams.  There has to be something though, right? I mean changes like this don't just happen. The only modification in my mundane life is these children work with every morning. How could they bring about these fears? They couldn�t have. I enjoy being with them more than anything I have done. Well, that is true most of the time. I do not fear these kids. So, it has to be something else, anything else.  Perhaps it is just my fear for next year. I am after all afraid of what it has in store. Could that possibly be the cause of all this? Strange to think so, but it just might be. I received my schedule this week and I have never been more frightened to be a junior then when I looked at my up coming teachers. Yes, I did know that my year would be hard no matter what, but no one could have guessed this hard. We are talking every teacher I did not want to have, I got. I must move on though.  That is a woozy fear, but a fear nonetheless. I will not lie and say that these dreams do not scare the shit about of me. I wake up in a sweat nearly every morning. As of right now I have: walked away from a car accident that killed all my friends, died in a plane crash, ruined my upcoming play, and been called a failure by my teachers. I know may not seem that scary to you, but remember I am an odd kid, thus I have odd fears. They don't matter though. They are just obstacles in my way and I shall have to look beyond them. As my old coach Tam used to say, "Obstacles are something a person sees when they take their eyes off their goal." He told me that nearly 5 years ago. I never forgot it and I don�t think I ever will.  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Excerpts from  "Letters to the Friends of the Cross" by St. Louis Marie de Montfort (1673-1716)   Friends of the Cross, you are like crusaders united to fight against the world....like brave and valiant warriors on the battlefield, who refuse to retreat or even yield an inch. Be brave and fight courageously....combine your efforts to acquire the eternal treasures hidden in the Cross. Pleasure-seekers unite to enjoy themselves; you must be united to suffer....  A Friend of the Cross is one chosen by God, from among thousands who live only according to their reason and senses, to be wholly divine, raised above mere reason and completely opposed to material things, living in the light of pure faith, and inspired by a deep love of the Cross.  A Friend of the Cross is an all-powerful king, a champion who triumphs over the devil, the world, and the flesh in their three-fold concupiscence. He crushes the pride of Satan by his love of humiliations; he overcomes the greed of the world by his love of poverty; he restrains the sensuality of the flesh by his love of suffering.  A Friend of the Cross is one who is holy and set apart from the things that are visible, for his heart is raised about all that is transient and perishable, and his homeland is in heaven (cf. Phil. 3:20); he travels through this world like a visitor and a pilgrim (cf. 1 Pet. 2:11), and, far from setting his heart on it, he looks on it with indifference and tramples it underfoot with contempt.  A Friend of the Cross is a glorious trophy gained by the crucified Christ on Calvary, in union with his holy Mother. He is a Benoni or Benjamin, a child of sorrow and of the right hand (cf. Gen. 35:18), conceived in the suffering heart of Jesus, born from his pierced side, and baptized in his blood (cf. Jn.19:34). True to his origin, his life embraces the cross, and death to the world, the flesh, and sin (cf. Rom. 6:2; 8, 11; 1 Pet. 2:24), so as to live here below a life hidden with Christ in God (cf. Col. 3:3).  In short, a perfect Friend of the Cross is a true Christ-bearer, or rather another Christ, so that he can truly say, "I live now not with my own life but with the life of Christ who lives in me." (Gal. 2:20)  My dear Friends of the Cross, do you live in accordance with the noble title you bear? Or at least, have you a real desire and a sincere determination to do so with the help of God's grace, under the shelter of Christ's Cross and of our Lady of Sorrows? Are you taking the means necessary for this? Are you walking along the true way of life (cf. Jer. 21:8), which is the narrow and stony way of Calvary?  ....Do you listen to the voice of God, our heavenly Father...the Father who stretches out his arms to you in loving appeal, "Come out, my chosen people," (cf. Is. 52:11), dear friends of my Son's Cross.... Listen only to the voice of my beloved Son and follow only him, whom I have given you to be your way, your truth, your life (cf. Jn. 14:6), and your model. "Listen to him." (Mt. 17:5; Lk. 9:35)  Do you listen to the voice of Jesus who, burdened with his Cross, calls out to you, "Come after me (cf. Mt. 4:19; Mk. 1:17); anyone who follows me will not be walking in the dark (cf. Jn. 8:12); be brave, I have conquered the world (cf. Jn. 16:33)." My dear brothers and sisters, there are two companies (cf. Mt. 6:24; Lk. 16:13) that appear before you each day: the followers of Christ and the followers of the world.... ....remember that our loving Savior has his eyes on you at this moment, and he says to each one of you individually, "See how almost everyone deserts me on the royal road of the Cross....'Will you also go away?' (cf. Jn. 6:68) Will you also desert me by running away from my Cross....?"  At this loving appeal of Jesus, let us rise above our human nature; let us not be seduced by our senses, as Eve was (cf. Gen. 3:6); but keep our eyes fixed on Jesus crucified, who leads us in our faith and brings it to perfection (Heb. 12:2). Let us keep ourselves apart from the evil practices of the world (cf. 2 Pet. 1:4); let us show our love for Jesus in the best way, that is, through all kinds of crosses. Reflect well on these remarkable words of our Savior, "If anyone wants to be a follower of mine, let him renounce himself, and take up his cross and follow me" (Mt. 16:24; Lk. 8:23).  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink      Poetry is something that I never find myself writing, yet a few days ago that is exactly what I was doing. You could imagine it has been a long time since I have actually wrote a poem. I did though. It was amazing, I just grabbed my pen and began writing, not fully realizing the extent of my work. The words just flowed onto the paper and when I peered down this is what I had written...  The sinful tears that started it all  Escape from his withered eyes and fall.  In the midst of the night they arrive  Making him feel he will never survive.  It is now that his spirit grows weaker  Feeling his fait is getting ever bleaker.  For the sorrow consumed his soul  And his retched life has taken its toll.   &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink      Ever find yourself in a place of such despair where everything you see, hear, and touch seems to darken? It is when life becomes death and death becomes what you seek in life. It's like you are sitting in the depths of depression waiting to suffocate from the sorrow, but you never run out of breath. It would be too easy. Instead, it's as if death is just out of reach, just an arm lengths away and you never can quite touch it or get farther away. Simply, it is when life becomes death and death becomes what you seek in life.  I have been to that place. I was at the place. I sat in the depths. I reached for death. I have never been in a darker place. I fight with everyone. It doesn't matter how much I love you or hate you. I just fought. I wanted it to all end. I wanted to find what I seek for, happiness. I could not bring myself to find it. Everything just seemed to have a hue only seen by those in the depths. No average melancholy person would see this, but only others like myself. Nothing was going to help me. I talked to old friends. I went to church. I spread my love to all those who were in need. I tried everything I could conceive. It seems I will never escape the gloom that has consumed my very being.  Well, that's what I thought. I did try everything, but there was nothing I could do. I found my smile again from a small child and her pure laughter. It was contagious. I could not help, but smile. If only this little girl could understand the gift she has given me. I want to explain to her, yet I know she will never understand. She did what she did unknowingly. Though, that does not change the effect it had on me. I had forgotten the joy of such laughter. I had forgotten what it was like to be a child. No worries, no thoughts of tomorrow, only the search for happiness. Her search found me my happiness.  I write this because I know others have been like myself, perhaps even worse. I want to remind everyone of who are. We are kids. We need to laugh, smile, and just mess around. I was lucky, I had an angel named Shannon teach me this. Naturally I feel I must share that everyone. It seems to be required of me. So, remember to true joy and the cloud over your life will disperse. The darkness will leave, the depths won�t seem too deep, and everything will be vibrant once more.  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    "We must always fear the wicked. But there is another kind of evil that we must fear the most, and that is the indifference of good men."  I have heard this quote a little more than thirty times now and it has never really made an impact on me as it did this week. I became more aware to humankinds apathy. I watched a woman back into a parked car, look at what she had done, and then drive off as if she had done nothing. There was definite damage, too. I saw a man walk in front of an elderly lady, as if to open the door for her, but instead just walked right in not even think about her.  As I think about it, those two things are not that strange. They do occur everyday and everywhere. It is just a matter of recognizing them. I refused to see what was in front of me. I guess in a way I was blind to what was and is going on around me. I never understood why people, especially the opposite sex, were taken back by my actions toward others. I have always opened doors for others, picked up litter, and well you know be polite. I was just simply acting how I was brought up and saw throughout my life.   What I have learned from this is that parents are not doing their jobs. We all learn from example, and if there is no example to learn from then we will inevitably make further mistakes. Parents in this day in age need to take up some responsibility and actually raise their kids. They no longer should worry about being cool or a friend, but just becoming the parent the child needs.   I know some may think that this is easy for me to saw, since my family is straight out of a black and white TV show, but quite honestly it is because of that I am able to see all the indifference of our world. My family is quite perfect, but that is how a family is supposed to be.   Mostly people do not read this and I am okay with that. However, those who do I have challenged. It may not be any great trial of intellect, but it is one nonetheless. I love that people hate what I write. I love that people enjoy what I write. But most important, I love that I can write and no one can tell me to stop. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink     Ever notice how most of the kids sent to “counseling” seem to have nothing wrong with them? This may be ridiculous to some of you out there, but often time I think the child has nothing wrong with them. It is normally a case of a parent being unlike their child and because of those differences the parent sends them for help. No, the “caring” parent does not try to understand him or her, but pays another person to understand the being they brought into this world, and in the process hopefully have the doctor change the kid to what they want him or her to be. A lot of you are probably reading this and thinking that I am in “counseling,” which I am not, or that I think it is always a bad idea, which I don’t, so don’t make assumptions.  Anyway, back to my point, sometimes the kid just needs to have someone to talk to, to understand him or her, whether is be a family member or not. I can understand that, but when a parent just gives up and stops trying to do so, that is most definitely not the right case. I can’t stand parents who attempt to mold their kids into what they want. Didn’t they ever hear the expression, “God broke the mold when He made you.” Meaning, God molded him. No one else can do such a thing. It is preposterous to even try. However, ignorant people still attempt just that.  Again, I want to make it clear that I am not against counseling. I think it can be a brilliant thing and the only way to go in certain occasions. I have my brother to talk with and I value his opinion higher than anyone else. Others do not have someone like that. I know people who need it, but don’t get it. I know people who should have it, but don’t get it. I have seen all kinds of people, most of them in my family. (If you have met my “entire” family you would definitely understand that madness of the group.) Many people in my family, not my immediate family, suffer from depression, which I believe to be one of the most horrible things a person can encounter. Those people need something to help them.  The people I worry about are the ones who are simply different and aren’t accepted since they are different. It breaks my heart to hear to even think a mother or a father would not try and talk to their son or daughter who obviously needs help. Their friends can see it, why can’t their parents? I do know a lot of people like that. Thank God we go to a school where guys openly care about one another, even if you are unable to see it, trust me it happens. We all care about each other. Guys have a hard time admitting that, but they do. If only all parents could be the same way.  I hope everyone knows this is not directly related to any of my friends, family members, or such. I just really wanted to talk about this. I know no one will really respond to this and that some may just blow it off as stupid, but at least you read it. It makes you aware of a problem that truly does exist, something I am eternally afraid will happen to children all over. I want parents to care about their child’s life more than their own again. For some reason that feeling seems to have been lost throughout the years. If you do not believe me just look around you, think of your friends, your friends’ parents, then you might change your tune.    urlLink

       urlLink     The historian Henry Brooks Adams once said, “One friend in a lifetime is much, two are many, three are hardly possible. Friendship needs a certain parallelism of life, a community of thought, a rivalry of aim.” I never quite realized it, but that is what I have. I spent a week living with three other guys. I can honestly say that I have never had more fun in my entire life. My sides hurt from laughing, literally. Granted that we were doing something that we all enjoyed, baseball, but we also could have fought or argued amongst all that. There wasn’t even a glimmer of a dispute. We joked, made fun of each other, and certainly played ingenious tricks, that is a given. I really do not think I could have asked for a better way to spend a week. It was a week I expected to crawl by while I missed my beautiful girlfriend. Don’t get me wrong I missed her that week and I miss her now, but my friends allowed it not to be my focal point.  I needed them that week. I really did. This summer has been tough, more than I could ever explain or care to do so. I have tried to find ways of expression, which would portray my emotions, but has been unsuccessful. I always write, so I figured I would try something new. I took pictures of the week. I am not in any of my pictures and I am perfectly fine with that because if you could only see the ones I have. Chris is smiling, Mark looks like a goof, and Kevin is getting destroyed. I don’t really have much more to say about our experience because it can’t be put into words. That is why I brought the camera. All I can say is that it was the time of my life and I can’t wait until next year when we do it all again.  It will only be a few more days until my girly, as some call her, will be back home. I can’t wait to feel complete again. I seriously do not feel whole without her. I got a call from her during our week at camp. I have never been madder that I missed a call in my life. It was the first time I separated from my phone in weeks. Hearing her voice gave me a sense of comfort to say the least. Knowing that I was not forgotten and perhaps missed was something I needed. That’s what her call gave me. The next day, I had the strangest feeling to get online. To my surprise she was online. It was the first time in weeks we have talked. Yes, it was only for three minutes, but that is three more than I expected to get. However, when I walked away to help my mother I strayed just long enough to miss her as she came back online. I was to say the least disappointed, but like they say, “life goes on.”  Anyway back to what I was saying. I am a lucky man. I have many true friends who would do anything for me. It was our experiences that bound us and our community that brought us together as friends. We owe Brophy that. Friendship is what we receive there on top of an unequalled education. If it weren’t for my friends at Brophy I would have left long ago, as I planned to do before Frosh Retreat. This week let me see all this again. It was the realization of true friends that permits me to look at the world as I do. Without them, I would be a different person, a person I am glad I never became.    urlLink

       urlLink      In the Broderick family, the word lazy is just that, a word. Most of you I am sure already know that I am busy all the time. I always figured it was because of my hectic life, but in all actuality it is in my genes. All Brodericks work from sun up to sun down. We do not enjoy boredom or silence. We need the sounds of a saw in the background. In fact, the most tranquil I feel is when I am working. I seem to turn into a different person when someone puts a hammer in my hands. I love to work. My family loves to work.  I realized this in the midst of a conversation with my uncle, David Broderick. He said that he might have a day of on Tuesday, so he would lay the tile at my aunt’s house then. I immediately, without even a thought, spoke up and said, “I’ll help.” Yeah go figure. I offered to manual labor, but like I said I enjoy it. I thought later on about that decision and came to the conclusion that it had to be in the genes.  It just had to be. Everyone in my family works. We are not runny from anything, we are not unhappy. If you really have ever met my family you could say we are nothing but happy. We all tell jokes and stories like you have never heard. That is a different entry all together though. What I am trying to say is that I know now it is not because of what I am that makes me such a busy person, but rather who I am.    It’s like Michael Bridge says, “When our eyes see our hands doing the work of our hearts, the circle of Creation is completed inside us, the doors of our souls fly open and love steps forth to heal everything in sight.”  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink      Isn't it interesting that the things you want to end, you miss when they are gone. It is like they become a part of you and without them you are lost. I have found this to be true in many different cases. I have just finished summer school, which I complained about on several occasions. I know I will miss it. I know I will miss seeing the kids every morning. I will miss being called "pinata-boy" every morning. I will miss seeing my new friends and I fear they will only become acquaintances again as time passes. My Gospels class is over and has been for a day. I have never had more fun in a class then I did this summer with Mr. Drapeau. God that class was regularly the highlight of my day or week even and now that it is gone, I just don't know. I made some new friends in that class, but I am not sure what will become of our friendships because of who I am, meaning how busy my life has become. My girlfriend leaves for Paris in only a matter of hours. I know I am going to miss her. I mean who wouldn't miss their girlfriend if they were gone for three weeks. She will have mounds of fun in Paris, I am sure of that, all I hope is that I can enjoy my time as much. On top of all of that many of my friends are leaving for vacation, thus stranding me. I feel so lost and hopeless right now, yet I will get over it. Say about three weeks?  I will miss many things about this summer. I will miss my friends, my girlfriend, the children, and the happiness they all brought to me. It is hard to imagine that when I wake up on Monday morning none of that will be there. What will I do? Well, probably go to the gym considering that is how I pass the time. If you did not know that is how I pass the time of my complicated life then you need to pay attention more often. I practically live in gyms when I got my heart smashed to pieces by the evil gender that are females. It is a wonderful place to go. No one can judge you cause no one really knows you, plus it somewhat eases me. I have many things planned for this summer. I am sure I will have a great time, but still no matter what I try to do it won�t be the same as the first few weeks of summer. The first few weeks are always the greatest for me and this year just makes the case even stronger.   I think that is enough of my and my random words for people to ponder in this odd sporadic form. I wish I had something better to write, but I don't so deal with it. Plus, I am really not that bad of a writer and my topics are not too boring, I hope. Everyone have a wonderful summer and if you ever find yourself bored, just remember I am at the gym even worse off than you.  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Sometimes I feel like I need to shake myself, to wake myself:  I feel like I'm just sleep walkin' through out life.  It's like I'm swimmin' in an ocean of emotion,  But still, somehow, slowly goin' numb inside.  I don't like who I'm becomin', I know I've gotta do somethin',  Before my life passes right by.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain,  An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'.  Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin',  Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.  Fly like a bird, roll like a stone,  Love like I ain't afraid to be alone.  Take everything that this world has to give:  I wanna live.   Sometimes I wonder why I work so hard to guard my heart.  Well, I hardly feel anything at all.  I've spent my whole life buildin' up this ivory tower.  Now that I'm in it, I keep wishin' it would fall.  So I can feel the ground beneath me, really taste this air I'm breathin',  And know that I'm alive.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain,  An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'.  Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin',  Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.  Fly like a bird, roll like a stone,  Love like I ain't afraid to be alone.  Take everything that this world has to give:  I wanna live,  I wanna live.   Somethin' deep inside keeps sayin life is like a vapor:  It's gone in just the twinklin' of an eye.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain,  An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'.  Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin',  Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.  Fly like a bird, roll like a stone,  Love like I ain't afraid to be alone.  Take everything that this world has to give.  I wanna take every breath I can get:  I wanna live.   &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink      So, I just got home from an agonizing baseball tournament that I refuse to go into detail on because I know my insides will cringe. I have been lackadaisical ever since I got home, which for the record was close to 3 hours ago. I just received a text message, and for those who know me you can guess who it was from, saying that she would not be home for another day. I have to admit was a little saddened by the news. I know she will have a marvelous time on this extra day, even if she says it was awful. I mean who doesn't love their family. Anyway, as I was saying, I was a little unhappy to hear this news. Wouldn�t you be? I have been looking forward to seeing her for 5 days now, and it looks as if it may be one more. I know, I know, I won't die if I do not see her, but still is kind of a bummer. Everyone can understand that.  It is just another day that I won't see her beautiful face, hear her voice, or laugh from her laughter. I am a sappy individual that I know, and if you didn't, you most definitely don't know me. I was talking about this a little while ago. She is by far the funniest chica I have ever known. It's not like she goes around telling jokes, but her smile, makes me want to do the same. I hope she knows that, well I think she knows that. After all she sees me do it plenty enough and she can read me like the books she loves.  Tomorrow will be the fourth month I have been with her. I have never been with anyone for this long. Something always seems to inevitably go wrong. It is always one thing. However with us, we have had our scuffles, and we seem to be just fine and dandy. Mostly those arguments come from her ability to see right through me, which I hate that she can do, but inexplicably she is able to look at me and smile. No matter what I do to that beautiful girl, she just smiles at me and turns me to mush. Now that I am thinking about it I know I have never talked to her about this. I am kind of leaving everything out there for everyone to see and read, but who cares. In any case there are only like 5 people who actually read this and there is only one I really care about. Sorry if you thought there was more.  To sum it all up, I miss seeing her, which is nothing new, but most of all I miss her smile. I say a lot to her and she says very little to me, but I know out feelings are mutual. You can just tell after a while, but most of all it is in her expressions that she gives it away because regardless of what I say she still is there for me. She still is there to make me laugh and keep me in line. She is a challenge that one, but one I can take on with a smile on my face.   A final thought- If this made no sense to you, then I am sure you are not alone. Hell sometimes I read what I wrote and am confused, so just ask me. Plus, if the picture disturbs who too bad because I think "Spuny" is damn cute.  &nbsp; urlLink
