      Go ahead and call me lazy, but I decided to not go to work today. In light of all the turmoil with Jack(ass) I opted to take advantage of a bright sunny day and just relax. Besides, I have to pack and get ready for the super fun weekend that lies ahead. Anyway, all feeble justifications aside, I'm glad I didn't go in. I hate that place and can not WAIT to punch out for the last time.   Harry and I went out to the new boat last night - or rather TRIED to go out to the new boat last night. We loaded up the Achilles inflatable dinghy and the stupid little motor in the back of the truck since the launch service at Pine Island (as I learned a few weeks ago - while radioing in at approximately 6:30 from my friend's mooring - doh! Thank god for boater camaraderie!) shuts down at 5pm. Well, when I looked at the inflatable, which must be at least 12 years old, I thought Harry had the floorboards in the bottom of the truck. We get over to Pine Island and it turns out Harry thought it was perfectly ok for the two of us to taxi out in an inflatable with no floor! In other words, the only thing supporting both our weight and the weight of the motor mount and motor itself was a thin layer of Hypalon fabric - OLD hypalon fabric. It took me a while to assure Harry that I really do know what I'm talking about and unless he wants to go for a swim, I'd wait until we can bring over the hard-bottom inflatable or can find some spare floor boards for this inflatable dinghy.   Anyway, it was nice to take a trip over to the marina regardless of being land-bound. Since things have slowed down I haven't been on the water in about a week and just being near it made for a relaxing and peaceful night. Plus I got to spend some time with Harry without my mom around - which is always fun. I know next year when I'm on the job market I'll have the opportunity to relocate - and most likely a lot of the positions will be inland. My ideal location would be either own a farm in the middle of nowhere - like in Colorado or Idaho - or to live right on the water, preferably in New England somewhere. Since the likelihood of finding a successful farm/ranch to own is very slim, I think I should set my sights on staying near the ocean. No matter how frequent or sporadic my visits to the shore are, every time is like returning to someplace - (cheesy, I know) mystical and new. I never get tired of the smell of the air, the way my hair feels after being ravaged by salty winds, the weightiness of my body upon returning to shore, the clang of brass bells in the distance or the cackle of seagulls overhead. Sam was telling me that there are a lot of positions open every year out in California, which sounds like an interesting change, but it's not exactly the New England I've grown to love over the years. Pete even said he would like to live in California (which is not to say I would base my decision solely on his willingness to come with me). There's a myriad of reasons to leave, there's a myriad of reasons to stay. Like always, I'm getting ahead of myself and just have to sit back and accept that there's no way to prepare for that type of decision until I'm actually faced with it.   So rather than spend more time in front of the computer when I don't have to, I think I will look up directions for our adventure this weekend, clean up around the house, workout, grab a good book, and head outside. All remnants of my tan have worn off in the past couple weeks, so I think a little natural vitamin D will do me good.   -C

      I have&nbsp;a nasty hangnail on my right index finger that - despite my best attempts -&nbsp;will not go away. It's not such a big deal really, but I kept getting it caught on things at work today so I decided to cover the sucker up when I got home.   Yes,&nbsp;here is my "blog" - what a dumb word. A lot of my friends have started to write them, and I think it's a relatively neat concept. Since I spend a lot of time at the computer as is, I thought perhaps having a computerized journal would be a better option seeing as I haven't written anything in my "real" journal since March. What can I say, I'm a follower...   Speaking of frrriiieennndds...   Roxann is leaving for VA in three weeks! BAH! What am I going to do? I'm going to miss Roxann so much I can't even begin to prepare myself.   Ok - I&nbsp;just ripped off the band-aid. I'll put one back on before I go on the elliptical.   Anyway, Roxann is one of my favorite people in the world. I never thought I'd get along so well with someone so different than me, but she truly is an amazing person. Aside from just being completely hysterical and fun, I really admire her strength and honesty. Roxann has taught me in the 2 years I've known her how to relax and just screw up; not that I'm advocating "screwing up" - but she made it ok to just be a goofball, to think "nasty" things about others (and to express that), to justify spending half the day in my pajamas with a good book or bad daytime tv now and then, or to eat the&nbsp;friggin calzone - and enjoy it god damn it! Bottom line: my phone bill is sure to&nbsp;be out of control come September.   Speaking of September - ughhh. Back tooo schoooll.&nbsp;Part of me is really excited, the other part is just ready to crawl in a hole and hide. Let's face it, I'm sick of school - which is not to say I'm not equally sick of my job - but in either case I think I need a change of scenery. I just have to remember that in another year I'll actually have a viable career as opposed to spending the rest of my life writing grant proposals and research pieces on  political theory.   Of course I freak out when I think about actually having a "real job." I mean, the boating industry is fun and all, but I never really considered any of this my career. What if I end up in "Statistician-land" completely miserable and consumed with the BS of daily life. That's why I decided against academia in the first place: being in that atmosphere made me neglect the "fun" stuff, even the not-so-fun mundane stuff, of life. I wanted to be in the position where I COULD leave with Pete for a weekend and not think about the 25 page research design proposal I have to submit, or the 300 pages I have left to read in some dry theory book.   But what if design proposals and theory books are replaced with flowcharts and bivariate regression tables? There's so much more I want to do before I become "settled" in life - either with a real serious career, a husband, god forbid KIDS; egads! For one thing, I want to be able to explore - on my own - parts of the world I've never seen. I get such a rush just by meeting new people and being in new situations. I think maybe that's why I change my mind so much - I get comfortable and then I get bored and seek to move on to something new just to get that initial unfamiliar rush back. (Luckily this hasn't been the case with Pete, but then again the level of comfort I have in our relationship&nbsp;is a welcome change in itself for me.)   Work today was sooo slow. We're past the peak season, so my incoming clients have dropped to near zero, and even the customer service follow up issues have slowed. Staring at the computer for the latter half of the day was like watching grass grow. I didn't even have any incoming projects to work on. Bummer.  I mailed my big bad cease and desist letter to biodad yesterday, and immediately after doing so I felt a big surge of empowerment, followed soon after by a bit of remorse. I don't want to think of myself and a nasty vindictive person. As insane as he is, in his mind he may actually believe that his stalking is motivated by love and/or concern. I (and anyone else who knows the story) understands this is completely opposite of reality, but putting myself in his shoes, opening that letter and reading what I have to say must be devastating - as a person let alone for the person who is technically my father. It really must hurt to have no understanding of your wrongdoing and then have someone tell you that you are legally prohibited from ever contacting them again. Ugh. I knew I would have some conflicting emotions about all of this, but I can honestly say in the end I am glad I sent it. I have to reclaim SOMETHING for myself, you know?   It's now time for me to get back on that good old elliptical for a half hour and then talk to Pete. I miss him&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;and am so excited for the weekend. Sometimes I sit and think about him throughout the day at work and am amazed at how incredible our relationship really is. I hate to be one of those "OMIGOD MY BOYFRIEND IS THE BEST!" girls, but I really do feel very special - and lucky - lately. Warm fuzzies.   Until later,  C   &nbsp;

      Well here I am, in the apartment. I must say, it's not nearly as hot at night as I had thought/feared it would be. The two box fans seem to be doing the trick.  I forgot my face soap at home. I have to go back and get it tomorrow. I also have to get some food because I have NONE.  It is just as quiet and almost as lonely as I had expected. Mom actually got kind of sentimental and weepy when I left, which surprised me for many reasons. First, I'm only an hour away. Second, she has usually looked forward to me leaving for college (and has expressed this to me explicitly on many occasions). She said that this time it's different because we had such a good summer together; there really was no major brawls or drama-fests this year. She thanked me for all my hard work and willingness to help out, and then she really knocked me on my ass and told me she's PROUD of me. This isn't the first time she's told me that of course, but it's not everyday that I hear it, and maybe it's a little bit more important to me now that I'm in the home stretch of my education and am admittedly feeling a bit anxious. I'll welcome any reassurance/affirmation thrown my way.  Anyway, she threw a huge wad of cash in my hand (which always makes me feel funny but I know it's just another way for her to let me know she's there for me and still wants to "take care" of me despite me being an "adult"), asked me when I'm coming home again, gave me a big hug and watched me drive away. I'm not going to lie: it was hard leaving. I mean, as much as she pisses me off at times I really appreciate and value our relationship. I can tell her ANYTHING and I know she'll still love me; not everyone is so lucky. She may not always agree with my decisions or lifestyle, but she has always accepted me - albeit not always silently or without protest. Anyway, I'm very lucky to have her for a Mom. She makes it very hard for me to stay mad at her by being so great at moments like these.  My apartment is fine. There really is no other way to describe it. It would be "good-bordering-on-great" if it were bigger, but it is rather small, so "fine" is as far as I can go now. It's really nice having my own washer/dryer, and a dishwasher is something new for me. And I must say I have decorated it very tastefully. I need to give the place a good scrub-down, especially in the bathroom, but overall I'm pleased. I just have a lot to get done in the next week. My main goal is to stay focused and active and to NOT let myself slip back into lazy-sloth mode. I'm on "the right track" and need to make a conscious daily effort to stay there. This will undoubtedly prove to be more challenging than any advanced statistics course.  Pete called me from work a while ago. He sounds really tired, and rightfully so. I wouldn't be wide awake either if I had to work his hours. I'm so excited to see him this weekend. It feels like it's been forever since we've gotten to spend a long quality weekend together. We don't even have anything special planned. Just the thought of waking up next to him again makes me smile. He's just another thing in my life for which I am grateful. I really am quite a lucky girl.  - C

      So the summer is officially over for me. Tonight I am leaving to go to (and stay at) my apartment up at school. As much as I complain about my family, part of me is really going to miss them. There's something comforting about my mother constantly nagging me or Harry's relentless whistling while he does, well, everything, forever tripping over the cat, avoiding the creepy old man next door, the close quarters of my bedroom with it's oversized and impractical furniture (which I picked out at age 10), sharing one extremely small bathroom with 2 very high maintenance women and a guy who remains oblivious by choice, and yes - there is comfort even in my sister's need to be in the spotlight at all times, and letting her have it. Sure, there are a lot of things about my family and my home that I can not stand, at times even despise, but my family is my home, and even with all the drama and twists and quirks it's familiar and safe and I love it. It's going to be hard going to sleep in a quiet apartment tonight; no hum of mom's rattling old fan which she refuses to replace or her sighs at just how "stinkin' hot" it is, no Abbie stamping up the basement stairs to make a few trips to the bathroom or get a late night snack from the kitchen, and no waiting patiently in the hallway to use the bathroom so as to let Harry have at least those few minutes of peace and privacy.  I don't like living alone, especially on campus. Don't get me wrong: I'm eternally glad I don't have to share a room with another strange girl ever again, but the silence and solitude of living completely alone can be depressing. I don't really think of myself as a clingy or even overly social person, but I like to be around people - if not for company's sake then just to "take it all in" and remember that I too am somehow still connected. I only hope that I can meet some really cool people from my department this year and have enough time to visit both them and my old friends who have inconveniently disbursed throughout New England - and some throughout the world.  I'm sure I'll write more later tonight when I can't sleep and have nothing but the drone of TV to keep me company. That is, of course, after I finish unpacking.

      My neighbors - the ones who refuse to wave at or talk to anyone in my family due to some feud started by biodad back before I was born - have 9 grandchildren, all under the age of 10. All 9 of these kids are dropped over every single day at about 8 am and the last one is not picked up til about 6:30.  My neighborhood is comprised of very small ranch-style homes situated on quarter-acre lots. This is a tight space to say the least. To make matters worse, these neighbors have a large pool (which covers the entire area of their backyard so when the kids get too pruned or want to plant their feet on solid ground, they spill out into the front yard, the driveway, the street, and more often than not - MY yard). Needless to say, the kids are outside for most of the day, which is of course great for the kids (still about half of them could be considered morbidly obese. I guess it's just as easy to sit poolside and eat cookies all day as it is to run around and play...) but not so great for those of us who would like to make it to age 40 without needing a hearing aid.  I have been listening to 9 obnoxious children SCCCREEAMMM at the top of their lungs and shriek for no reason for the past 3 hours. Today is not unlike any other day, but one girl in particular has an especially powerful set of lungs and a scream that reaches an ear-piecing pitch. She simply won't quit, and I have a headache.  The "adults" in the family are sitting in the front room of the house. I know this because every time I go outside I see a pair of craning necks followed by disgusted glares from the direction of their massive front picture window. I'm often tempted to stick out my tongue, or better yet, simply stand out in my patch of grass that is the front yard and start screaming incoherently. So not only are these children unsupervised around the water, but their screams... oh the screams. I simply can't stand it.  Are all children this loud? I remember growing up and getting a hand to the head when I started crying in public, and when my sister and I would splash around in our pool we were distinctly told not to scream because "someone may think you are hurt and call the police and wouldn't you be embarrassed then?" Of course, our weekly visits from the paramedics when biodad would drink or smoke himself into a diabetic coma while mom was away at night school weren't embarrassing enough...  Which is not to say I condone physical punishment - AT ALL. In fact I am adamantly opposed to hitting children and have vowed never to do it. I also don't think kids should be confined to a coloring book and crayons for the sake of "playing quietly". I remember many nights of neighborhood kickball and stickball tournaments, riding bicycles down to the pit and catching frogs, turtles, and the occasional garder snake, and flashlight tag - none of which were conducted in silence. But come on, screaming - not laughing or hoots or cheers or even teasing - just flat out SCREAMING??? How about a simple "hey, stop screaming or you're going inside" and then following through to at least show some sort of effort in discipline? Is that asking too much?  Why do lazy apathetic people have children? It comes as no surprise that these same lazy apathetic people pawn their offspring off on their parents who undoubtedly have no firmer concept of proactive parenting; dysfunction has, after all, been proven to be hereditary - which scares me a bit but I think I have the fortitude to end the chain. Anyway, the predictability of the situation doesn't lessen the blows to my eardrums.  I mean, call me crazy, but when I'm ready to have kids, it'll be because I'm ready to devote myself wholly to the happiness, health and emotional stability of my kids, not to save a relationship or fill some void in my life only to have the thrill wear off and spend my time finding new ways to keep them occupied so I can watch my daily dose of trashy daytime TV or spend money to get my acrylic nails done in ugly argyle patterns, or spend my weekends at some cheesy bar looking for "a good man and a new daddy for my babies" or go on self-indulgent shopping excursions while I leave the kids at the mercy of my mother and her ideas of "parenting". And just like marriage, I'll know when I know. There is not age-limit or timetable (except of course for menopause). Yes, I am stereotyping, but it's been my observation that parents who behave this way have kids who are lost, confused, lack self-esteem, and run amuck both as children and then as adults. Basically, I'm sick of seeing it and dealing with it in my own front yard.  I've definitely gone off on a tangent, but that's kind of the point of writing in a journal. I'm not saying kids can't be kids, but a 3 hour long shriek-fest has very little to do with the natural state of childhood as far as I can tell - it's just obnoxious. I think people should have kids only when they've had time to grow up themselves, step away from their self-centered youth and play an active role in the young, developing lives of their own flesh and blood. I know I'm no where near that point; I'm still selfish in many ways and am not ready to give up my privacy and free time, hence my precise use of birth control. (Hellooo...this is not a new concept)  Of course I know nothing because I'm not actually a parent yet, and God-willing I'll end up with a kid just as rotten as I was, and I don't realize just how hard it is, how easy it is to break down, and what an exhausting, pain in the ass endeavor having children really is, and yes I'm quoting all the old and bitter people who had children far too young yet expect their children to pop out a set of grandkids for them before age 30 so they have something else to temporarily fill the void in their lives until the novelty wears off and they begin to analyze and find fault with their children's parenting skills, hence beginning an entirely new cycle of generational strife. Luckily my mother has yet to put any pressure on either my sister or me. When and if she ever does, she had better be ready to get an earful.  No, I am definitely not ready to have kids.

      Ok, so I finally went out and bought the Ashlee Simpson album.  I don't care what any of my music snob friends think (and believe me, I've taken TONS of crap for this one); I LIKE IT - A LOT! No, it's not deep, the music is not structurally complicated, but I like what she has to say and I love love love to sing along. And a certain individual (who prefers to remain anonymous because he has deviated from his previous standards and admitted to liking it too - and no it's not Peter) said that if she ever gets really big that I could be a dead-on impersonator for her. I don't think I look much like her - maybe a little in the face - but I think what he meant is that she and I sound very similar when we sing, which I take to be a compliment. The idea of making a living imitating someone else's music isn't the least bit appealing, but I'm choosing to ignore that part of it and just go with the idea of someone else actually liking my voice. That little bit of validation is important now and then.  Speaking of Pete, I'm sure he will give me a good bit of hell when we get in the car together and I start singing along. He's always loved my voice, and actually encourages me to sing around him, which is slightly embarrassing sometimes, but we have very "different" taste in music. I don't think he's going to be an Ashlee Simpson fan - haha! It's kind of funny really, because all the big losers in my past tended to be either in a band, musicians, or artists; no matter how many times I got walked all over by self-absorbed and self-proclaimed "artists" I continued to seek them out and subject myself to more. Which is not to say that all musicians/artists are self-absorbed, but my experiences have enabled me to make at least a pretty strong hypothesis. I had the "bad-boy-rocker" complex going on for a real loooong time. The irony is that I spent a long time "looking" for someone who shared my interest in music and art, and the guy I happen to meet (by accident, when I wasn't even paying attention) and fall head over heels in love with has very little interest in music, and what interest he does have is very different from my own.  Anyway, I really wish I had done something with my so-called vocal "talent" - or even been encouraged at some point by my "by the books" mother to do something irrational like take voice lessons or perform in local theatre groups or shows (instead of studying classical piano - like my sister - or keeping my nose in the books because I was destined for "greatness" ie: some professional degree which is not only boring but has nothing to do with who I am, hence the big bomb-dropping announcement that I decided not to go to law school "and you're not talking me into it" last year). I've dabbled in 5 different instruments, and at least as many "majors" and never really found satisfaction with any of them, except of course for singing. When I sing I feel on top of the world; it's such a release, more than I could ever feel winning a lawsuit or writing a prize-winning paper. Although I don't think I'd ever be able to handle "fame" - it would drive me even more insane.  So for now I'll have to limit my self-indulgent outpourings to the occasional Karaoke contests and driver's side shows in the Red Demon. ;)  On another note, the Bursar's office confirmed that my finances are in order. Yay! I get so worked up over money.  Tonight Harry and I are bringing my elliptical machine up to my apartment. Lifting that thing up 2 HUGE flights of stairs is not something I'm looking forward too, but I do feel a hell of a lot stronger since I started lifting in the past month. AND, today I put on a pair of jeans that I bought a few weeks ago and they are definitely loose. Word.  Off to go clean (and sing)!  -C

       I am never checking my email on a Sunday again!!!     I got an email from the Bursar's office (which was sent Saturday when supposedly they aren't even open on Saturday) saying that I owe them close to $5000.00. Um, excuse me...no.  What ever happened to my financial aid? And oh yeah, there's this thing called a TUITION WAIVER which I was supposedly granted because I am, afterall, such a stellar student.  Now I have to wait about 16 hours before I can even begin to hope to get this settled.  One more year one more year one more year one more year one more year...

      Call me Sasquatch, but it is very difficult for me to find a pair of sneakers that actually fit properly and hold their own against my oh-so-strenuous workouts.  Back in March I bought a pair of Nike cross-trainers, and they were not cheap. I thought having new slick (and comfortable) shoes would compel me to stick to plan number 472,990 to get in shape (more on that later). I was tired of drudging through my workouts in beaten down Sketchers (yes, Sketchers) that have seen hundreds of hours of step aerobics and hikes. I happened upon this pair of Nike shoes, and tried them on.  Now at one point in my life (a very swollen, unnecessary-doses-of-Lithium-ridden point in my life) I wore a size 11 shoe. That is absolutely ridiculous for someone who is, on a tall day, 5'5". My default size has usually been a size 10, at least since the 8th grade, which is still ridiculous for someone my height, but I do have a certain affinity towards frogs so hey, why not? Since then my feet have shrunk down to a 9 or 9.5 - which is somewhat hard to come by (the 9.5 that is).  I initially tried on a pair of 9's in the Nikes; not because I'm one of those cracked-out women who equate some sense of personal achievement by fitting into small(er) shoes, but because using what little logic I have, I thought that since every other pair of shoes I had bought in the past year had been 9's, the Nike's should follow suit. Wrong. I couldn't even fit my foot halfway in. Next was the 9.5, and after a fit of cramming and jamming, I looked like the wicked high school English teacher Mrs. Hoye who always seemed to cram her feet into poly-vinyl pumps (circa Bradlees era) that were at least 2 sizes too small, at least if the outpouring of "foot fat" was to serve as any indication. Poor Mrs. Hoye. Her name was June, June Hoye. Weird. Regardless, these shoes were just too small. (This is beginning to sound like a really stupid and warped story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Oh well)  Deciding to forgo the Chinese foot binding torture-esque feeling of the 9.5's, I stepped up to a 10, and since 10 was the largest size carried by this particular store, I was forced to either fit or forfeit. I chose, erroneously, to go with fit.  My feet slid in easy enough, but again, my toes in their flipper-like spread (and no, I am not insinuating that I have webbed feet: I do not.) felt slightly crammed. I figured - eh - the shoes would stretch. They felt otherwise rather comfortable, and I definitely had more arch support. Step aerobics - HERE I COME (again)!  Now, after months of wear and tear (sporadic, admittedly, but still wear and tear nonetheless), I can honestly say that Nike is a shitty shitty company. Naturally, I first found fault in myself for having genetically defective feet, or for buying shoes that didn't fit (like the cracked out women mentioned above). But recently I have arrived at the conclusion that Nike sells cheap crappy shoes at an inflated price and adheres to no universally accepted sizing schematic whatsoever. On a not so long ago window-shopping trip, I decided to try on another pair of Nike shoes. They were very similar in design, but were of course price-hijacked because it is, after all, back-to-school season and this year's design with the purple swoosh is FAR cooler than last year's design with the navy blue swoosh. Duh. I grabbed a size 10, and behold, a size 11. Now mind you, I have bought other pairs of shoes in the recent past (like my Mary Janes from Zappos - very cute!) and all but one were a size 9; the exception was a 9.5.  The size 10 of this Nike experiment felt oddly similar to the pair I already own: way too tight across the toes, yet somewhat roomy in the heel. The size 11 was way too long - I could store a roll of quarters in the heel - but still amazingly tight across the toes. Here's the shocker: I tried on a pair of 9.5's, and to my amazement, they fit perfectly. I checked every label and tag available, both on the box and on the shoes themselves, and no indication of the rare and elusive "WIDE WIDTH" beast was to be found. I tried on a different pair of 10's, also with no indicator of "WIDE WIDTH", and they too fit across the toes, but were again, slightly roomy in the heel. I continued to open every size of the very same design in the sizes 9.5 and 10 until I had tried them all on. Neurotic? Yes. But call me silly, but a 9 is a 9 is a 9, and a 10 is a 10 is a 10, right? Well not according to Nike, world leader in athleticism and child labor cover-ups.  Now, taking into account that Nike is, after all, manufactured "over seas" (I sound like my step-grandfather. Ugh) - which normally does not necessarily connote less than stellar quality but in this case I'll play the role of ignorant arrogant American princess and follow that lead - I begin to wonder if their foot prototype is slightly askew.  Regardless, I have decided to forgo another Nike purchase. It would have been very easy for me to scoop up the 9.5's that amazingly fit (and pay $30 extra for this odd happenstance of shoe-fit-good-fortune), but I decided to make a moral judgment and declare my own personal boycott against Nike.  Now, just to demonstrate that I am not completely insane (completely being the operative word), Pete recently bought a pair of Nike shoes (traitor!) and a pair of Reebok - since he knows how much I hated his old shoes - and I believe he said he bought a size 13 in the Nikes, and a 12 in the Reeboks. So there!  Anyway, since my latest experiment I have reverted to wearing my 4-year-old sketchers, and to my amazement, I've reached new fitness goals. My step aerobics endurance, which to me is my personal gauge of "how fit I am", has surpassed another 10-minute interval, and I have dropped a full size in clothing. Woo! My Sketchers have served me well, but I realize in my heart of hearts that the time has come to lay them to rest. Yesterday while in the middle of a 50 minute torrent of stepping I heard a loud "snap" and after establishing that it was not my ankle or knee, I saw a large crack in the plastic exterior arch support. Oh the sorrow.  So that's what I plan to do today: find a pair of sneakers, go to Walmart (I hate going to Walmart on weekends - everyone with 4 or more screaming toddlers seems to flock to Walmart on the weekends) for some food, and step to my heart's (an thighs', calves', and butt's) content. Woo!  -C

      So I found out that my apartment's AC has been cut off because the University detected elevated (note: NOT DANGEROUS) levels of carbon monoxide gas in 2 of the 354 units in the complex. Wow. Great.  Fuckers.  It makes me wonder what type of genius really goes into planning and implementing these construction plans to begin with. Not only that, but the safety commission (huh?) who apparently ran these tests is about 4 years too late if you ask me (seeing as the apartments were built 4 years ago).  Could I just have one year where things are uncomplicated and just plain work out? What gives? I just finished getting excited about returning to school, about the damn apartment, about everything and now I find out I'm going to be sitting around sweating my tits off and dealing with at least weekly maintenance visits while they figure out how to better ventilate (ie: CONSTRUCTION - awesome!!) each unit's AC duct and/or water heater emissions. Pure genius I tell you!  Apparently they detected a reading of level 3 (parts per million) carbon monoxide, and the federal government has stated that anywhere between .5 and 5 (parts per million) is normal. What's the f'ing problem?!?! It's just a little gas!! So install the carbon monoxide detectors in each unit and leave it alone!!  Supposedly they are "hard at work" with some very reputable engineers (unlike the cheap-o's who were in charge the first time around??) developing a fast and reliable solution. AND, as I was informed via email, supposedly this solution will be in effect before move-in date. Yeah, right, ok. It's only taken them 5 years to finish laying sidewalk around campus; like I'm going to believe installing new ventilation systems in 354 apartment units is possible for these idiots to complete in only 2 weeks. Okkkk...  When I told my mother and Harry about this horrendous news they implied that I'm a spoiled brat. Well, duh.  Grumble, piss, moan.

      So I left my job last Friday, and I must say the thrill is definitely gone. Aside from being slightly crampy (more on that later) and really enjoying the use of my own (as opposed to the company) bathroom, I'd much rather be sitting around and rotting while making money than sitting around and rotting while growing progressively poor. So after fretting for 3 nights about my Visa bill and other financial woes, I decided to make a budget. In doing so I have realized that 1) I can not maintain my lifestyle on an assistantship stipend and student loan refund check alone thus 2) I need to get a job. I think getting a part time or "casual" job as they are referred to now (18 hours a week or less) will be good for me. It'll put more time constraints on me/create pressure (and I know I (only) work well (at all) under pressure) and the obvious benefit of having money to actually pay off my Visa bill is self-evident. So I applied to a  > supermarket online because I've done it before and it's easy. I don't have the energy to get a job where I'll have to learn a new set of so-called skills in addition to embarking on an entirely new field of study. No. Thank you.  Speaking of the Visa bill, Pete informed me that I'm going to his friend's wedding on the 28th, which at first seemed delightfully fun and exciting. I like going to weddings - at least so far. I'll admit it, there is something mildly appealing about a cheesy overly romantic atmosphere once in a while and a wedding is the perfect way to get away with it. The mere fact that Pete has to dress up gets me excited. I'm a sucker for a guy in a nice shirt, jacket and tie, but only if it's on a limited basis: stuffy bankers do nothing for me. I'm even more of a sucker if that guy happens to be MY guy (yeah, I miss my Peteeerrr). In Pete's case it totally works; he never gets dressed up - I'm giddy just thinking about it. You'd think that after a year together I'd be completely over the whole "Wow I'm soooooo in love with this guy" syndrome, and for the most part I am - which is not to say that I don't sooooooo love him; I do. It's just that I've stepped down from that initial cloud 9 and am currently somewhere between 6 and 7. I think lately I've grown to just really appreciate and adore this guy, completely and entirely, and it's just great damn it.  Anyway (sigh), back to the Visa. As excited as I was at the idea of getting dressed up and having a fun night out at someone else's expense (free food, free drinks, I'm there!), I quickly (within 30 seconds) realized that I 1) have nothing to wear and 2) have a Visa bill which is far too large to consider investing in something worthwhile. I’m not one of those girls who are pretty enough to “pull” anything off. I stick to the basics for my day to day attire for a reason: beyond being comfortable, I think drawing attention to myself with trendy, "special" or wild clothing could do more harm than good so I prefer to just mellow out in the background. Not that I'm constantly weighing what I perceive others to think and determining my course of action (or dress) from that, but I'm more comfortable with not being noticed than taking a chance on being noticed for the wrong reason. Does that make sense?  So I'm kind of stressed about finding something to wear, for many reasons, but most of which is financial. I already ordered a pair of shoes from Zappos (great shoe store by the way...too great!)  urlLink http://www.zappos.com/images/662/7128662/62112-p.jpg  and I like them a lot. They remind me of kind of 1950's retro pin-up era style, which of course is my favorite. The shoes were on clearance with free 2nd day shipping - hot dog! I just hope I can walk in them. 3" heels, EGADS!  Let's see, oh yeah, cramps. They're surprisingly not as bad this time. FINALLY, a GYN who knows what she's DOING!! YAY! I think my new pill is working out juussst great.  And I must say, it feels absolutely amazing to be able to say that for the first time in 10 years, the only prescription I'm taking is my birth control. Hahahaha. I've been free and clear of all the other garbage for over a year now and I have to say after my 10-year experience with the psychological profession, I think it's a bunch of crap. The criteria for so-called "mental illnesses" are so vague and non-descript that almost anyone could fit the bill. So one day one crackpot decides to label me with some "hot" trendy disorder (after 4 other crackpots have labeled me with 4 other "hot" trendy disorders) and try out one (or two, or five) of the hundreds of new "experimental" drugs until I develop a heart condition, my kidneys crap out, and I gain and lose over 200 pounds in 5 years (among other things). Suuuure, sounds like a good idea. But maybe, just maybe, I needed some help getting over the past; human help, not chemical help. Clinical psychology is devastatingly out of control and it feels damn good to have completed my first year away from it (not to mention to be able to run a few miles, sprint up the stairs, and not be doubled over with "another kidney stone" every other month!).  I'm going to go look around for some possible wedding outfit ideas then hit the treadmill. I need to move around a bit. I'm excited that my shoes are coming tomorrow. YAY! This budget thing is going to be hard.  -C

      One of the product management guys brought in a bag of shelled peanuts to share (how random), and it immediately reminded me of the circus - which I never really enjoyed but have very vivid memories of. I ate about a handful (a handful too many) of these peanuts (and in doing so made a big flaky mess all over my deskat which Jack snickered in disgust), and now have massive stomach crampage - which of course totally ruined my evening plans. Bummer.

      I went to the dentist this morning, and had a pretty good time. I never really understood why people get so nervous about going to the dentist; it's the one place you can lay back, let everyone else do all the work, you don't have to talk, everything is minty fresh, and its considered normal for you to let go of all social graces and just drool to your heart's content. Come on, it's like a massage to the mouth! Plus, my dentist is really cute in an "I'm young, interesting, and slightly geeky" sort of way. He always talks to me about his rock climbing adventures because I commented once - about 2 years ago - on how I like to go hiking (and by hiking I usually mean extended walks in a slightly wooded/hilly area. Not exactly your "project adventure" type scenarios.) and I think he expects me to understand how just "totally AWE-some" the "rush" he had "on the one ledge" was. I just grunt and blink to confirm I heard and/or possibly "get it". Anyway, he's a very cool, very cute guy, and he plays good music in his office.  Turns out I grind my teeth, and my dentist said that it's very common in high-stress individuals. Was he implying that I am high stress? HOW DID HE KNOW?!? I'm stressing over the fact that someone I see maybe twice a year has gotten a distinct impression that I am high stress!! But seriously, I didn't even realize that I was doing it. Pete sleeps like a rock so it's not like he would hear me at night, and I thought clenching your jaw while driving, sitting in class/at work, listening to family drone on and on, reading, working out, etc was normal. Apparently my teeth are only supposed to "meet" when I chew, and since I've taken up this habit, my teeth have been filed down almost 1/32 of an inch - which doesn't sound like much, but when he took out the little ruler/gauge thing and showed me a comparison between this x-ray and my last one, I was shocked. If I keep it up, I'll have "chicken teeth" (huh?) by the time I'm 40, which I'm taking to mean "For the love of god STOP or you'll be the next spokes model for Polydent!!!" I have to go get fitted for a guard to wear at night - and during the day if necessary - to train me not to grind at best, and at worst just to prevent any additional wear on my teeth should the habit persist.  I also - ughhhhhhhh - have to get my wisdom teeth out. Apparently it shouldn't be quite the ordeal as I've heard from some other sensitive individuals (Pete: "Yeah, I had holes in my mouth for 2 weeks and it tasted like beef from all the blood!" Charming babe, charming.) because my teeth have already "broken through the jawbone" and therefore they won't have to actually break through my jaw. Hey, whatever, just give me the gas. I got a referral to an oral surgeon nearby, but I don't know when to schedule it because I'm sure I'll be a big huge baby and need some "help" functioning normally for the first day or so (Moooommm, can I have some sooouupp??"), and living up at Hilltop with no roommates will make getting that help difficult. I should probably schedule it for a time when I know I can come to Waterford for a couple of days and let my mom baby me.  All in all in was a good day, but I'm bored. I know I bitch and moan about going back to school, but I think I have over-extended my stay in Waterford, and the time has come for me to no longer sell boats and boating equipment to middle-aged assholes who try to evade tax laws and Coast Guard regulations and think it's perfectly acceptable to "flirt with" (HARASS) me to try to get the best price (just FYI, if you ever use this tactic, be aware that the price is usually jacked up about 5% for every 5 minutes a woman has to listen to this BS. We'll still get the sale, but it's to your financial disadvantage to be a slime-ball!). It's very frustrating to work with the general public. I mean, I've been doing it since literally my 16th birthday in one form or another, and I'm finding people treat you with more disrespect the older you get. They (and by "they" I mean the arrogant piggish old men I cater to now; the women don't tend to be quite as disrespectful) assume that since you work in retail, or "sales" since I'm not actually in a retail position, that you are ignorant (or as they say "uneducated" - which is not the same thing in my mind; you can have 3 PhD's and still be an ignorant mo-fo!), that you have at least 2 illegitimate children with two different daddies, that you should automatically be sympathetic and knowledgeable about every single one of their needs before they even begin to speak, and that it is your personal problem when something doesn't go exactly as planned. Ok, fine: not everyone had the luxury of going to college. I went, and I don't consider myself any "smarter" than when I graduated from high school. I may have had a few memorable life experiences which helped me to "grow up" a bit (and I stress A BIT), but I think the same would have applied had I not gone to college and was forced to start paying rent 4 years earlier. People are met with challenges no matter where they come from or what they do; a piece of paper with official letterhead does not make me any more capable to deal with "the real world" OR more deserving or anyone's respect. I just don't know where people get off assuming that a college degree automatically makes you a better, smarter, wiser, or profoundly DIFFERENT human being than had you not gone. I mean, for those go-get-em "extracurricular" types college may provide a really convenient venue for them to "develop leadership potential" and "broaden their horizons" - but my impression is that life happens by doing, not by joining a club or taking a semi-structured curriculum of "diverse" classes, and the knowledge acquired at college can not replace the wisdom acquired by actually "DOING" life. College for the most part sucked for me; I'm glad I went and dealt with what I dealt with when I did, but I wouldn't want to do it over again, that's for sure. I don't know, it just frustrates me to hear someone else who may not have the type of education I have speak with a customer in perhaps a little less "polished" manner but still conveying all necessary and relevant information, and then hearing them say "hold on sir, let me transfer you" because the client thinks he or she is incapable of doing their job. I don't judge people by the length of time they've spent in the classroom; I judge people based on how kind they are, what kind of perspective they maintain in difficult situations, and by what they value. How they express this counts for very little in my book. Down with intellectual snobbery! HMPH!  The weekend was a blast. Despite me drinking too much Red Bull and feeling like I was on some kind of roller coaster on Saturday night, Pete and I had a really good time. He finally met me friends Barb and Josh - and from what I can tell really enjoyed himself. The next couple weeks look like we're basically going to be headed in opposite directions, so I probably won't see him that much - which in a way is a much needed change because I have a lot of BS to take care of, and it'll give me a chance to spend some quality time with Ray - and Roxann before she  leaves.  I have to go workout. I feel (and look) enormous and could use a rush of endorphins. As much progress as I've made, I still 1) need to lose more weight and 2) obsess over my appearance waaaaaaaaaaay too much. The whole "I can't be perfect" thing hasn't really sunk in yet, and the funny thing is that no one is really exerting those types of pressure on me anymore. My mom has pretty much chilled out and accepted that I'm nutso and will never really be "all that she had imagined" (and Harry could give a shit), I'm not in dance classes anymore, I don't exactly hang out with superficial prissy brand-bitches (we're the Wal-Mart/Target kind of gals!), and my boyfriend thinks I'm beautiful (I never said he wasn't weird). Yet no matter what I do - even as far as talking myself through those really insecure moments - I still get upset over the way I look; from the shape of my face, to the frizzy wild hair, to my thick muscular legs. I have some good days, but I would really like to not think about this stuff anymore, or at least as much. There's lots of people in the world, and lots of them aren't necessary "beautiful" (let's not even BEGIN to get into the whole subjectivity thing, because being rational and realistic has no place in this train of thought) and I'm sure their lives aren't utterly miserable or empty because they will never grace the pages of some glossy magazine, but for some stupid f-ed up reason I have created an entirely different set of standards for myself. Oddly enough, I don't even have a very critical gaze when it comes to other people. I hate going out with my sister because she is constantly finding flaws with mere strangers: "Look at her outfit. Oh my god. He butt looks HUGE!" - I never do that. In fact it takes a lot for me to even notice another person's appearance. They have to be either disfigured of incredibly freakish for me to take a second look, yet I put myself under the imperfection microscope almost every day. I guess I'm getting "better" about it - no, I know I am, but still have a loooong way to go. I guess you could say today was one of the bad days. I went shopping real quick after the dentist and of course whenever I go shopping I get depressed: too many mirrors. The funny thing is I have never felt relief from this: even when I weighed 97 pounds (sad but true) my junior year, had heart problems, couldn't walk up the hill without wanting to pass out, my boss threatened to report me to the infirmary and Lauren told me I "looked like Skeletor - and that's a BAD thing!", I still woke up every day and tried on 5 different pairs of jeans until I found one that didn't "make me look fat" and got frustrated when a certain style of shirt I wanted to buy didn't fit in the size XS and I was forced to buy a size S. In reality, I now know I could've tried on 5000 jeans and it wouldn't have mattered - my life wouldn't have been any different if I was a size 2 or a size 22; I was deeply miserable and lonely regardless of what size jeans I wore (after years of therapy I finally figured out my anorexia on my own. I think it was easier not to figure it out before) It doesn't matter now either - now that I really could stand to lose 10 pounds - whether a certain pair of jeans does or doesn't make me look a certain way. I'll still have to go to work, I'll still be in love with and loved by Pete, my family will still be bizarre, ultimately frustrating, but endearing just the same, and I'll still be clueless and scared to death of the upcoming school year, let alone life after school. I may not be miserable or lonely anymore, but I still habitually find flaws with myself. I KNOW these things now, but I haven't quite gotten to the point of BELIEVING them. Maybe I just need some more time. Hell, it took me 11 years to even get to this point.  Anyway, I'm going to go have some food, chill out for a bit, and then hit the elliptical. It's too daaarrrn hot. -C
