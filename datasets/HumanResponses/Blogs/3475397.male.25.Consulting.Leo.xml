       W ell, bear with me on  this one, but I think I might be starting my own  Sect... err... School of Thought. And I  prefer the entrepreneurial title as  a "Consultant Firm" over "Think Tank."  "Think Tank" just seems a bit  too pretentious to me, and besides no  one needs them except the really,  really big wigs. Right now we are small potatos.  What a sweet job would that be though, to  be a full-time member of a  company Think Tank, where you just  sit around with a bunch of other smart  people and try to come up with solutions  to the many types of problems a company  may run into. The unpredictable, unseen  and otherwise novel problems are of  course the most lucrative... not only  financially but because they present a  worthwhile opportunity for me to participate  in one of my favorite "mental sports"  of all time: solving problems via the  encorporation of knowledge, intellect  and a solid grasp on logic.   Such solutions to such problems would  definitely be worked out more  efficiently, quickly and convincingly  if such an enterprise worked as a  collective, and I think you know who  I'm talking about. If we were  clever enough to pool our resources  together to ultimately produce "satistying  results" (and we have previously  demonstrated many times in the past --  philosophy, schoolwork, jamming, BTF, etc. -  hey I'm serious!) for  whatever clientele, well hey we would have a  job we all would/could enjoy.   And really, I don't know about you guys,  but all I wanna do is have a  job that I don't hate, that I don't have  to wake up every morning and know I  have to be miserable for the next however many  hours. This might sound gay (well  this whole thing might sound gay to you by now  but fuck you), but I truly am  convinced that human sociality and technology  have evolved enough to  the point(and not only recently) where we  shouldn't have to "work" for a living.  We should be able to just do what it is we enjoy  doing all of the time,  because fuck it, whether its jamming or making weird  underground films or doing  this consulting firm thing, we owe it to ourselves to  not have to be  miserable in our chosen profession(s). We are all smart,  creative, and we fuse well,  and generally a tight unit.   The only think we lack is a way  to get off the ground. Well, this  neural-net based statistical analysis package my  professor invented (which is open  source code by the way) might be  our first entry way. See, he was about to  start up this company called "Data Busters,"  which he got government funds for  and everything, using this collection of neural-net data  analysis/forecaster algorithms, and  the first project was going to analyze insurance  company data to look for fraudulent  claims based on anomalies in patient record data  patterns. For every 5 fraud cases  he found out of every 100,000, they  offered him ~20 grand. Well, it  turns out he cancelled the whole fucking thing  which is why I have to move back  to SB, but hey I still have this program and I  think it would be worhtwhile and  possibly profitable if we could some how put it  to use.  I've tried the stock market, baseball  games, fed interest rates, to no  avail so far... But I did make a model  which could 95% of the time predict  whether some baseball player's lifetime  stats successfully indicated if he was in  the Hall of Fame or not.... So anyway,  this is already really long, but yeah I  dunno I'm gonna keep looking for different  data sources to analyze till I move  back to SB. And if you run out of data,  there's always the warm butter of a  flobular sound wave to keep you company.  There's no Gnome like Palindome,  --CFx xFC    [the foregoing is an email recieved from CyrusFX, Saturday, May 28]

      Plato and Aristotle turned philosophy away from science.  Plato was explicitly wary of the young science, no doubt because his philosophy rejected the veracity of the senses, while, intuitively, science itself  starts with observation.  Aristotle tried to be the friend of science, and in some respects, deserves to be called the father of modern science proper. He invented induction, the prima facie logic of science, as well as the notion of a catalog full of taxonomic distinctions. Aristotle himself was a great biologist; no doubt his notion of science as a 'filling-out' of the categories of his catalog came from the idea that all of nature should be understood taxonomically, as a biologist sees it.   Unfortunately, though Aristotles heart was in the right place, his mind wasn't.  As it will turn out, trying to understand the world in terms of Aristotles sorts of categories will be inimical to modern science (though the notion of a category itself will not be so easily dispelled).  One of the greatest struggles of modern science will be to wriggle out of the grip of Aristotelian thought....

       W ell, America is finally getting over the disgrace it recently brought upon itself. Oh, no, not the disgrace brought on by the whole Iraq invasion itself, rather, just the part where we put hoods on those we  didn't  bomb thoroughly enough.  Good thing we chose to take the humane high road and just bomb all those civilians rather than try and hood them all, like you know those sadistic bastards in the pentagon really wanted to do.         NOTE TO PEOPLE OF AMERICA:  WE ARE AT WAR. OUR MILITARY WAGES OUR WAR FOR US.  TO PREVAIL IN WAR, OUR MILITARY NEEDS INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ENEMY.  THIS INFORMATION CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM OUR ENEMY.  THIS PROCESS IS NECESSARY FOR THE SUCCESSFUL WAGING OF WAR.  THE PROBLEM IS   WAR  !

      For some reason, the ancient Greek thinkers started to explain the world.  They began by criticizing the worldview inspired by the early Greek myths.  Their philosophy was physical and cosmological: it described, in physical terms, how "God's house" (ie. our world) is built.  This is why they are sometimes called philosopher scientists.  From Thales, on through Anaximander, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Zeno, and Democritus, the modern theories of science evolved in ancient Greece.  They developed nascent forms of two of modern sciences greatest achievements: the atomic theory and the heliocentric theory.  This physical philosophy was stopped dead in its tracks, however, by the idealistic philosophy of Plato....

It will setup yahoo mail as your default client and take you to the send page when you click a "mailto:" link. It also hooks up the explorer right click "sendto->mail recipient" thing. So you can attach files with ease.

       T he earliest inventions for harnessing nature were tools powered by human muscles.  They revolutionized our ancestors situation, but they suffered from the limitation that they required continuous human attention and effort during every moment of their use.  Subsequent technology overcame that limitation: human beings managed to domesticate certain animals and plants, turning the biological adaptations of those organisms to human ends.  Thus the crops could grow, and the guard dogs could watch, even while the owners slept.  Another new type of technology began when human beings went beyond merely exploiting existing adaptations (and existing non-biological phenomenon like fire), and created completely new adaptations in the form of pottery, bricks, wheels, metal artifacts, and machines.  To do this they had to think about, and understand,  the natural laws governing the world - including...not only its superficial aspects, but the underlying fabric of reality.  There followed thousands of years of progress in this type of technology - harnessing some of the materials, forces, and energies of physics.  In the twentieth century, information was added to this list when the invention of computers allowed complex information processing to be performed outside human brains.  Quantum computation...is a distinct further step in this progression.  It will be the first technology that allows useful tasks to be performed in collaboration between parallel universes.

       P lease answer the following:     1)  T ake the following sentence: 'This sentence is false.'  Is it true or false?     2)  T ake the set of all sets that don't contain themselves.  Does this set contain itself?     3)   A ssume as true the following theory:  'We should formulate theories and critisize them as rigourously as possible in an effort to reject them.'  This statement itself is a theory, and so it follows from itself that we should critisize it.  If we end up rejecting the theory, what then happens?  Can we consistently formulate and reject the theory which tells us to 'formulate and reject theories'?  How does this antinomy differ from the previous two?

Why?  10)   I f you had precient knowledge about the fact that the earth would soon temporarily start rotating about its axis at a speed three times greater than its current rate, what preparations would you make (It would spin up to the new speed during the first minute, maintain that speed for 40 minutes, and then spin down to the normal speed during the last minute)?   11) Must questions about pointless questions be themselves pointless?

       A nswer the following questions:     1)  W hat is more important: your perceptual experience of the world, or your conceptual understanding of it?     2)  I f a thing changes, then, after the change, the thing is no longer identical with itself, and thus it seems problematic to say that  that  thing has changed.  How do we have to understand change in order for it to make sense that a thing changes, and yet preserves its identity?     3)  A re there ethical truths, and if so, what kinds of truths are they?  Are they analytic (or in any way neccessary) truths, like the truths of mathematics or logic, or are they synthetic 'truths', like the 'truths' of science (which, of course, are not really truths at all, rather, explanitory hypotheses).     4)  W hat would it mean to say that an answer to a question here posted is right or correct?

      If only someone out there could produce a series of essays that exemplify the position(s) of a certain group of 'backwards' thinking individuals in such a way as to 'trick' those individuals into endorsing the fraudulent dissertations. Then, when the moment is ripe, the wool is pulled from over their eyes so they may see clearly the misdirection of their thinking. No, those essays are nowhere to be found on this blog, even though I must concede that my mortal fallibility has led me to think backwards at times, even when I feel as though my thoughts point in the right direction. Besides, why would I trick y'all? It is a certain more politically influential group I have in mind...

       I t has come to my attention not-so-recently that there are many different intellectual pursuits all claiming to come under the heading of epistemology.&nbsp; Below is a list of these pursuits.&nbsp; I bet you can't guess which one I endorse...    &nbsp; Epistemology is the study of how we make proper choices when it comes time to commit the act of belief.&nbsp;We could call epistemology in this sense the&nbsp;'ethics of belief':&nbsp;&nbsp;it attends to the 'should believes' and 'should rejects' of the world of ideas or propositions considered from some ethical ground.&nbsp;   &nbsp; Epistemology is the study of the limits of our knowledge or when we can say that we legitimately  know  something.&nbsp; While loosely related to (1),&nbsp; here we are more concerned with objectively valid criterions for determining the knowledge status of some bit of proposed knowledge as well as criterions for the original&nbsp;sources of legitimate knowledge.&nbsp;   Epistemology is the study of knowledge considered as a real physical phenomenon, and understood in terms of the isomorphic relationship between the knowledge structure itself and the 'world' a part of which it represents.&nbsp; Here we do not have&nbsp;a pre-occupation with certainty, justification, or legitimate&nbsp;sources, as&nbsp;it is conceded that they inspire only illusory confidence in our use of knowledge.&nbsp; This&nbsp;account of epistemology is&nbsp; concerned&nbsp;with&nbsp;the formation and selection of better (or more verisilimar) knowledge structures: it is an entirely progressive affair that does not even maintain that we 'know what we are doing' or that we 'know what we are talking about', nor that we ever could&nbsp; know these&nbsp;things.
