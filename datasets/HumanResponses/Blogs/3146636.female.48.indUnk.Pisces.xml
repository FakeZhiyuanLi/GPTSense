						   Perhaps what I wish to do isn't quite as adventerous as  Tom Neale , but I also want to leave.  Maybe I'm just tired. Maybe I'm drunk. But maybe, just maybe, someone put an idea into my head that I can't shake.   Granted, this person didn't say Utopia, I did. As a matter of fact, this person stated that Utopia was 'unattainable' due to 'them' putting the idea into our heads that it isn't. I however feel that utopia is a mindset, and that it is attainable as long as  I  do not lose site of the goal.  All I wanna do is have some fun.   My idea of fun may not be the same as yours. I want to build my house out of adobe and straw bales. I want to grow my own food, harvest my own food, hunt my own food and live my own way.  I want to create a new 'civilization' based on not the most 'technological', not the most 'hip', not the most 'current' life styles. I want to draw from past civilizations that have prospered for a while.  I may or may not want someone there to do it with me, it all depends on my mood....

						   The  Special Olympics   has always been a charity I've supported.   In the past few years,  truck drivers  have adopted this charity as their own, donating time as well as money for these wonderful people.  This year the excitement mounts as one trucker has issued a challenge to raise even more money for the Special Olympics.  My very own brother-in-law  , Rusty, has challenged the truckers of America to donate a total of $1,500.00. In return for this he will have his head and beard SHAVED off, and wear a 3-piece suit while driving his truck around the country making his deliveries.   To bid on the privilege to be the person to cut his hair, or just to donate money to this cause, please go  here    If not, (shrug) send the money to me! (no link, just kidding)

						   I tinker too much. I try to fix things that are fine the way they are.  I was once told by a very dear old man, that if you were inspired to begin with it doesn't need tinkering. If you weren't inspired, it's not worth tinkering with. He was referring to writing at the time, but I've seen that it works in all aspects of creativity/life.  So why then do I tinker?  My dad told me it was in my genes, so I washed them.  And yet I tinker.  Who needs to know this? No-one in particular.  I have found out things great and small, that have added to the texture of the being that is me.  For instance, changing just 2 ingredients in a long island iced tea will turn it into a kick-ass frou-frou drink that I call a Baja-sunset. It was well received at the No-Frills Grill in Denver/Aurora, sadly shut down now due to poor selling practices. :(  And yet I tinker.   I tinker to learn, I tinker to improve, I tinker to destroy.  It's in my genes.

						   Cilantro, even though part of the carrot family, is evil. The seeds (coriander) are divine in many applications, but the leaves leave a lot to be desired for many.  A friend of mine in Denver has such a bad reaction she has to go to the hospital if she happens to ingest any.  Just why do so many have such a bitter (pun intended) reaction to this herb?  A quote from The Gourmet Sleuth may give some insight:  "The essential oils of the cilantro leaves contain antibacterial properties and can be used as a fungicide."  Personally, I think anything that can be used as a fungicide should not ingested.   just sayin..

						   You're gonna have crust left over.  Make cinnamon and sugar nibbles!  Roll out extra crust.  Brush with 1 to 2 tbsp melted butter.  Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture over the butter.*  Cut into pieces about 2" square. (Here's where you can let the kids help, with cookie cutters)  Use a large, flexible spatula to move the treats to a cookie sheet.  Bake at 450 for about 10 minutes.  Allow to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes then remove to a plate.  These can be stored in a cookie jar for later nibbling.  What?  You turned your back, and they're all gone?  You didn't set the intruder alert, did you?  * cinnamon-sugar mixture  1/2 cup sugar 1 to 2 tbsp cinnamon (I love cinnamon, adjust to your own taste)

						   I love pie.  Especially fruit pie.  Today I made a mango and peach pie.  It's divine, with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream.  Mango Peach Pie:  2 mangos cubed (about 1 1/2 to 2 cups) 5 peaches sliced very thin (2 to 3 cups) 1/2 cup sugar 1 tbsp lemon juice 3 tbsp flour (mix with the sugar before adding, trust me)  Mix all ingredients together in a largish bowl, cover and refrigerate while you make the crust.  Yes, I said  MAKE  the crust.  Pie Crust:  3 cups flour 1 1/2 tsp salt 1 1/2 cups cold shortening, lard or butter (refrigerate it, I'm not kidding!) 3/4 cup ice water  Mix the flour and salt, cut in the shortening until it looks like crumbs. Add 1/2 cup of the ice water and gently stir in. Add additional water 1 tbsp at a time until the dough ball is formed. Don't make it too wet, that will make a tough crust!  Form into 2 balls, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about an hour. (You DID put the filling into the fridge, right?)  Set your oven to 450°.  Take the dough out of the fridge, one ball at a time.  Knead gently, about 10 times. Roll out on a floured surface to a round big enough for a 10" pie pan. Place into pie pan gently, easing it down the sides. There should be about an inch overhang outside the pie pan.  Take the filling out of the fridge, stir and pour into the crust.  Now roll out the top, according to the above directions. Fold into quarters and cut vents into the middle.  Wet the edges of the crust in the pan with water, egg white or juices from the filling.  Unfold the top over the filling and trim to 1/2 inch from the outside edge.  Fold the bottom crust up over the top crust and finish by crimping or pressing with a fork all the way around.  Cover edges with foil and place pie on center rack in the pre-heated oven.  Bake for 15 minutes at 450°, then turn temperature down to 350°.  Cook for an additional 30 to 45 minutes, or until crust is golden.  Remove from oven and protect from others by saying how nasty it smells.  Cool for at least 3 seconds.  Dig in.  Seriously, let it cool a while (30 minutes or so) or the filling will be runny and your pie will look as yucky as you said it smelled earlier.

						         urlLink Apathy   as I see it.    When you don't care about something, you're said to be  urlLink apathetic .     I don't completely agree with this.    I don't care what your sister's husband's cousin's fiance had for dinner last Tuesday, does that make me apathetic?    No, it just means I'm not interested.    I don't care how the election turns out,  does that make me apathetic? (hypothetical case)    Yes, it does. It means that I don't care how the future of my country (as well as yours) turns out. It means that no matter how hard YOU might try, things may not change for the better or the worse, because you can't make ME see my own apathy.    Every person counts. Every fire lit under some apathetic ass helps. Every spark ignited in some boob-tube-dulled eye makes a difference.    But apathy isn't just for people who don't vote. I see it all the time in people I personally believe in.    Friends who make grand plans, then don't work towards the goal, end up whining because it didn't "happen" to them. Things don't just "happen" to you. You have to MAKE the event, whatever it may be.     You have to put that one foot in front of the other, put pencil to paper, put oils to canvas, put music to the dreams you had last night, or you'll always be wondering why.     Why didn't that happen to me?     Help fight apathy today, go DO something that means something to you.   Find something that you turn a blind eye, or deaf ear to and learn about it.  Volunteer, learn something new, taste a different flavor.    DO SOMETHING!

						        Last night I had the dubious pleasure of stocking the cookie aisle. What is UP with this? I counted no less than 30 brands of cookies, not including the varieties!              Why are you so willing to eat these sugary pieces of cardboard rather than make your own? It can’t really be the time factor, some of the most complicated cookies I make take less than 2 hours.       2 hours folks, please! You spend more time than that watching the tube in a stupor after eating your fast food.              Nothing conveys 'love' (or 'like') like freshly baked cookies.     When my sons visit, the first thing they want to know is "Where is the cookie dough?”    Grandnieces (I seem to have a million) all go straight to the cookie jar.    Granddaughter is a bit young yet, but she knows, she  knows ...    My personal favorite is a banana-walnut-oatmeal-raisin that I created one day when everyone at work    was asking for 'something new'.     The boss (major yum factor of 37) liked them so much; I had to make them at least twice a month, just for him! Of course, he did share.    In this chapter, however we will explore the universal favorite, chocolate chip.    Now, I don't like crisp or hard cookies.  I like them soft and/or chewy, so I've adjusted recipes to make them  my own , and to make my cookies soft. To me, soft makes them seem fresher somehow.          Now for the recipe;               5 cups all-purpose flour      2 teaspoons baking soda      2 cups butter, softened      1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar      1/2 cup white sugar        4 eggs      2 teaspoons vanilla extract      4 cups semisweet chocolate chips      2 cups chopped walnuts (not an option in my mind)               Sift together the flour and baking soda, set aside.      Cream together the butter and sugars in a large bowl.      Beat in the baking soda until blended.      Stir in the eggs and vanilla.      Mix in the flour.      Finally, stir in the chocolate chips and nuts.      Drop cookies by rounded spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.     Bake at 375° for 10 to 12 minutes.      Edges should be golden brown.     Remove from pan and set to cool on a rack.              Set the guard dogs up around the table.                Make SURE you have plenty of milk on hand, as these will be eaten as fast as your back is turned, even while you’re putting the next pan into the oven.               That’s all for today.

						    First, we're not using any convenience stuff here. You're gonna make the teriyaki sauce yourself, no little bottles of pre-made marinade from the grocery.    Remember, this is about the satisfaction of the end product and the bits of yourself that you put into the meal. It's not about getting the meal ready fast because you have at LEAST a dozen other things to get done before you plop down in front of the tube.      Teriyaki sauce:    1/2 cup soy sauce  1/2 cup mirin (sweet rice wine)  2 tblsp sugar  (or to taste, yes TASTE it as you're making it, otherwise you're not gonna know if it's worthy to serve to yourself)    Mix all above in a saucepan and warm just to bubbling on the stove. (Stove: that thing in your kitchen that you leave the plates from frozen microwaves meals on until you take the garbage out)    Now you have the sauce.    Time for the chicken.    2 lbs chicken breast, preferably boneless    You can cut the breasts into strips or bite size pieces if you like. I usually cut them into 4 pieces, so you have to cut them while eating.     This forces you to eat slower and enjoy your food. Really, it does.    Dip the chicken pieces into the sauce and place in asingle layer in a buttered baking pan. Pour the rest of the sauce over  the chicken and put into a 350° oven (that thing behind the door on your stove, you remember the stove, right?) for 30 to 45 minutes.    After 30 minutes, baste the chicken every 5 minutes until done. Turning it over doesn't hurt either.    Done!     Serve with fresh bread, a nice salad and maybe some kind of mango-chili salsa* or fresh fruit of your choice.    Now, don't you feel better about the meal you just created? Honestly, 45 minutes is worth it.    Trust me on this.    *mango-chili salsa can be as simple as combining fresh mango cubes with the chili pepper of your choice, roasted chilis impart a yum factor of at least 7 to this.    1 cup mango cubes, bits and pieces (mangos are  so  much fun to remove from the seed)  1/4 cup roasted, peeled and seeded chili pepper (of your choice, although I recommend poblano or anaheim for those not attuned to the need for heat)    Mix the mango and chili together in a bowl. That simple.    You can complicate it a bit by adding some sweet onion, a bit of garlic, whatever.

						      Everyone must eat, this is a given.    Man (human, not just the guys) cannot live on bread alone. Regardless of current dietetic fads, fresh bread is a major yum factor.    Baking bread takes time.    You say you don't  have  time?    Get over it. Take time. Make time.    The very ritual of making and baking bread is, in itself a stress reducer.     Choosing the recipe.    The gathering of the ingredients.     The melding of these ingredients to the mass of lifeless dough, so soon to be a loaf, a batch of rolls, a breakfast delight.    The waiting time. For the dough to rise takes that precious commodity, time.    Hey, you probably need to vacuum and clean the bathroom anyway, right? (Please wash your hands after.)    Once the first rising is done, you get to punch the dough down! Fun times!    Kneading is very good for your stress, I suggest making Italian bread if you're especially stressed as too much kneading will make for a tougher crust.    Leave the cinnamon rolls for non-stress-filled times, trust me on this.    On that:    My recipe for cinnamon rolls (Doesn't include a trip to the mall)    First gather your ingredients:    2 pkgs of fast-rising yeast  1 1/2 cups milk, heated to 110 degrees  1/4 cup salted butter (don't substitute margarine, please)  4 tblsp sugar  1 egg room temperature, beaten slightly  5 cups flour, sifted (or not, most flour is pre-sifted anyway)    Melt the butter in the hot milk.  Mix together 4 cups of the flour with the yeast and sugar,  Stir in the milk/butter mixture and the egg.    Add additional flour until you have a soft, but not sticky dough.    Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, adding flour as you go from the remaining cup, or until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky.    Cover and let let rise until doubled in size.     Punch the dough down, literally, punch it hard to let out the built up gasses.    Knead for a minute or so then form into a ball and roll out into a rectangle, approximately 9x13.    Filling:    1 stick butter, very soft, but not melted  1/2 cup sugar   2 tbsps ground cinnamon.    Spread the butter over the rolled out dough to the edges.    Mix together cinnamon and sugar and sprinkle heavily all over.    Don't worry too much about getting it perfectly even. Or at all even.    Roll the dough up from the long side, pinching the edges together to seal.    Cut into 1 inch sections with a VERY sharp knife.    Place rolls into a 9x13 well buttered pan, about an inch apart.    Make sure there's room for the rolls to rise and spread out.     Cover and let rise until double then bake at 400 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.    Remove from pan and drip a glaze of 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar and  a tablespoon or two, more or less of milk, over the tops if desired.    You can also substitute orange juice for the milk in the glaze. (YUM factor!)    Feast!    Variation:     Melt 1 stick butter and add 3/4 cup packed brown sugar, plus 1/4 cup REAL maple syrup for maple sticky buns.     Pour into the bottom of the pan before placing rolls in to rise.    When finished baking, place a baking sheet ( cookie sheet works well for this) over the pan and turn it over.     The rolls and mapley-brown sugary goop will NOT all come out, so you may need a helper to clean out the pan. Kids work well for this task, but men seem to like all that finger-licking too.    Again, Feast!

						    As I work at my job, in a semi-major southern grocery store, I am amazed.          Amazed the choices.          Amazed that the choices are there.            Amazed that the American public has become so fucking lazy, they can't combine ingredients other than water and 'this bag of stuff' to make a meal anymore.        I mean, really.         Whatever  happened to COOKING?         You know, simple stuff.         Red beans and rice, for example (this is what started me on this line of thinking).            Now don't get me wrong, that certain brand of rb&r from Louisiana is a great quick meal, combined with some yummy         urlLink  andouille  sausage, however they now offer a variety - with cheese?       Please.        How FUCKING hard is it to add some cheese to the mixture just before it's done?        How have we Americans become so lazy?        Another item: Rice Krispie treats.        I'm sorry, it takes 10 minutes, TOPS to make this silly sweet. HOW LAZY ARE YOU?       See, to me cooking is a ceremony.      I equate it with love.      To me, cooking is love.      Love of the meal you're preparing.      Love of the people you're preparing it for.      Love of the individual ingredients.      Love of self.      I know the world is a fast-paced place these days, but you can't live on these convenience foods and be even remotely healthy.     You can't convince me that a meal made up of say, precooked meat, cook-it-in-a-minute rice/noodles and some canned veggies proves that you love yourself or anyone else you may be cooking it for!      more on this later...      I hear my bed calling.      Who'd a thunk a part time job in a grocery store would light a fire under one?

						   after just 2 nights of work i have come to the conclusion that   americans are lazy and they get bored too easily    not a brilliant insight i know     but    how many different flavors of popcorn do you need  whats wrong with the original flavor  i do not like microwave popcorn  i prefer to cook it the old fashioned way  its the ceremony that makes it taste good  that  and real butter  oh  and cooking it in coconut oil  mmmmm  cholesterol be damned    why are there 37 different types or flavors of spaghetti sauce  what happened to making it yourself  or adding your own ingredients    just how many shapes can pasta come in to entice your child  who will only eat mac and cheese anyway  to eat it    after that  and having a horribe lunch from krystal  the greasy filmy feeling will take weeks to leave my mouth  i just know it    i have decided  to pack my lunch from now on      also  i weighed myself  and i weigh 10 pounds more than i thought  not happy    also  im cutting my hair off  1 to 2 inches should be long enough to be socially acceptable  and it wont be all dripping with sweat all night    well    thats about it for now  oh wait    my feet and back dont hurt as much  i wore my comfy sneakers instead of the not comfy black shoes  i will buy comfy black sneakers after i get my frst check    ok    thats it    bubye

						    long first night at work....    i haven't stood on my feet that long in one day since 1987, when i left my last retail job for the wonder-filled world of computers and the internet.    i'm too exhausted to sleep, and man do my feet and back hurt!    on the upside, it's a lot of bending and stretching, which will, in the long run, be very good for me, yes?    later, message, sleep.....    zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

						   one of my favorite poets has always been  urlLink archy  a cockroach who wrote a poem each night on  urlLink Don Marquis'  typewriter.  archy was too short to use the shift key so everything was lower case and unpunctuated  i will be writing this way for a while to see if i can stand to be a cockroach in my next life  words to live by  live so that you can stick out your tongue at the insurance doctor  archy

						   No, not THAT night (more's the pity).  Tonight I get to go back to that thing people refer to as 'work'.  Now don't get me wrong here, but I've been looking for employment for close to a year now, and suddenly I have not 1 but 2 jobs, within a week.   WTF?  Did my southern accent improve that much?

						   Hasn't it already been a week?  Beer tastes bad without cigarettes. This means I will not be drinking much beer for a while.   Much better for me.  I can do this.  Yes I can!

						   Doesn't one have to have some sort of definition first?  Maybe if I define myself as a needy, clingy ditz, I'd get more attention.  I'd shoot myself first.   Granted, I'm clingy, I need, and I can ditz with the best of them, but not on a regular basis.    1st step of definition taken: last cigarette smoke 3 hours ago.

						   2 packs and it's done, no more smoking for me.  I finally found something (again)that's more important.  More on that later.  For now,  wish me luck!   Thank goodness I like  urlLink cold turkey...

						   Sometimes I just don't wanna know.  There are things I can't say out loud, for fear of hurting someone else. The things I don't understand, and things I don't wanna understand. The things I do understand, but don't know why. Things that are beyond understanding are placed at my feet.   On silver platters.   "Here, fix this."  No  please  or  thank you , just  do  it.  Somewhere, at some point in time, I was 'defined' as the listener. Is there a listener out there for me?

						   I was mowing the lawn, and noticed that I needed air in the tires. So I get out my handy-dandy portable air compressor and as I'm filling the rear tire I notice this noxious smell.   Looking under the gas tank, I see not a drip, but a  STREAM  of gasoline leaking out.   Needless to say, I did  NOT  start it up again.  I'm sure it can't take a full   2 weeks   to fix it....

						   Muses come and go for most. The lucky few are able to entice them to stay around.   Lately  urlLink Euterpe , who has been my muse from birth - according to my dear father, has decided to revisit.  Now legend has it (well this is MY legend)that I was born singing. As far back as I can remember I have heard music. Not on a radio, or a record player but in my head.   It may well be that I trilled out a little tune when I slide down the chute of delivery, after all who wouldn't rejoice at being freed from the confines?  All I know is, there is ALWAYS a tune of some sort in my head and sometimes, if they don't already belong to someone else, I can even write them down.  The most likely place for me to 'find' a new tune is in someone else's writings. My own words hold little in the way of music for me. I don't know why, that's just the way it is.  But give me a nice bit of poetry and the words start dancing in my head, jotting the notes down as my eyes skim over them on the page.   These notes will stay stuck there until I either get them written down, or they die from lack of attention.  I mourn the notes lost, dissipated into the mist of my mind.  I rejoice in the notes I am able to save to paper, or these days, to computer.  I thank you muse, for coming back to me!

						     Small, but gorgeous!   Close-up :)  I know, it's called a Christmas Cactus, but it's a whole lot closer to  urlLink Bastille Day.    I got this plant from a former boss, who felt guilty for not being at work when I was taken from there into the hospital due to 'aggravated stress'.

						   It hurts my fingers to type this.  I haven't played in 8 years (or thereabouts) and had to restring it after having retrieved my dear, beloved guitar from a sister. In so doing I discovered an almost stripped tuning peg :(  That's gonna have to be fixed.  It's playable, to a degree, but not fully tuneable. Right now it's about a note and half off. I can't live with that.  Note to self: Never, ever, ever, ever notinamillionyears lend ANYTHING to ANYONE EVER again.   And so, my life, such as it is.  My fingers hurt.

						   when you're surrounded by people who can call you by name why do you feel so alone?  when it's eating you up and your stomach's in knots and they all want you  now  and they take and they take...  who's there to give when  you  need it?

						   There are few things that I absolutely hate.  urlLink Fireants  top the list, now that my late  ex-husband is, um, late.  They've invaded the house now, so sleeping is less than optimal.  They seem to think I am a delicacy. Granted, I'm the sweetest person on earth, now that Mother Teresa has gone to the Great Beyond, but really, WHY ME!?!?!  They sting, and it hurts. They get infected in a matter of minutes. They leave scars. Did I mention, they  HURT !!!?  Time to bomb the house inside and out and hope I get all the queens...

						   They suck.  Having a cold in the winter is expected. You  PLAN  for winter colds.  You have plenty of medicinals on hand, having planned.  Summertime colds hit you like a ton of bricks and leave you feeling like the bricks got lodged in your brain as well as various other spots of your poor, aching body.  I have a summer cold.  I'm miserable.  I ache.  At least I'm not puking anymore.  Anyone know why summer colds make you puke?  ::sneezes 7 times in a row::  OK, back to the steam and vicks.  I hate summer colds.

						   ... was my baby's 17th birthday.  My baby. 17. Impossible!  He was just 3 feet tall a couple of years ago, wasn't he?  Now he's close to 6 feet tall and can grow a full beard.  How did this happen?  I know. I understand the inexorable march of time and all that.  But really.  Wasn't it just a couple of years ago, that I made his  devil  dinosaur   costume for Halloween?  The year after that was an Indian costume and the advent of the  stupid barbie-like doll  in the spider web on the porch. (He and his older brother borrowed it from a little girl down the street, only Barbie I ever had to buy was to replace the one they  borrowed )  That march of time always seems to creep up on me. I just don't know how I got to be 48!  How the hell did I survive?  Better yet, why?  Somewhere out there, there's a reason.  And so I trudge along in the march ( urlLink John Phillip Sousa  playing in the background), dazed and confused. Lonely at times. Once in a while, scared.  That I'll never find that reason. That one person. That other half. That someone to grow old with. Laugh with. Cry with.  Most times I'm apathetic about it, but once in a while...    I'm scared.
