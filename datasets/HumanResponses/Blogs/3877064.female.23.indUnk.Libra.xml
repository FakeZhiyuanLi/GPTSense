      After posting the longest "running manifesto" ever written in my Shenandoah Chronicles blog yesterday, I feel slightly ashamed to say that I ran not a mile today. &nbsp; Really, I don't feel ashamed but I do think I should make a running journal. &nbsp; Today, Kevin and I did run outside for about 50 feet and then we turned around and ran back.&nbsp; We were at work discussing the beauteous-ness of the weather... not too hot, for South Carolina... and decided that we needed an outside frolick break. &nbsp; So between that and a walk around the Furman Lake, I have amassed a little physical activity for the day. &nbsp; But truly, my left leg, glute to knee, feels pretty weird today.&nbsp; I must have done something to it yesterday when I ran for 57 minutes while my car was having it's oil changed.&nbsp; So it's good that I didn't try to run. &nbsp; I was tired today.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Tomorrow will be different after today's lovely day of rest.

       Tomorrow    9 A.M.  Pick up my 15 foot van at Penske.&nbsp; Drive it home.   11 A.M. &nbsp; My exit interview at Personnel.&nbsp; My library keys will be taken from me.&nbsp; They will ask me if I was happy working for Furman.&nbsp; I will say,"Quite."   11:30 A.M.&nbsp;  Out to lunch with John, Julie, and Jimmy, the Circulation Department team.&nbsp; My leaving seems to have turned the aforementioned Circulation Department team into an alliteration.&nbsp;   1 P.M.&nbsp;  Finish the Circulation Desk packing.&nbsp; We are throwing things into boxes and labeling them.&nbsp; I have been doing a lot of that as of late and am therefore very efficient.&nbsp;   3 P.M.&nbsp;  Word is out:&nbsp; there will be a little going away party for me at three tomorrow.&nbsp; There will most likely be a chocolate cake there.&nbsp; Julie has made me promise I will stay until then.&nbsp; If chocolate is involved in any scenario, you can pretty much count me in.   4 P.M.&nbsp;  Home to my house and an empty 15 foot moving truck.&nbsp; I will fill it with the many tupperware and cardboard boxes that I have already packed.&nbsp; I will try to get a lot done before Chris gets to town.   7 P.M.  Pick up Chris at National Car Rental and go downtown to eat.   9 P.M.&nbsp;  Donate the old couch from from my living room to the Beth Marcum House Foundation.&nbsp; Just because I cannot support the Arts by buying her artwork, does not I can't help her in her attempt to furnish the little house she is about to buy.    Saturday   Finish packing, finish cleaning, and maybe, hopefully, just maybe maybe, if I get up early enough to do all of those things, be on the road and well-fed by our friends at the Pita House by..... could we say 1 P.M.?&nbsp; I think that's really pushing it though.&nbsp; A more likely&nbsp;timeframe would involve not being able to leave until 4 P.M.&nbsp; At which point, we may have to delay leaving for Virginia until&nbsp;Sunday morning.&nbsp; Fortunately, there is no rush.&nbsp; Either way, it&nbsp;will work.   &nbsp;  I am so excited because these next few days are filled with all of these&nbsp;changes.&nbsp; Goodbye job, Furman, Greenville!&nbsp;&nbsp;It's time to move on!&nbsp; I never thought that it would take me 14 months after graduating from&nbsp;college&nbsp;to leave this&nbsp;city.&nbsp; But now that it's here, I know that it's the&nbsp;right thing to do.&nbsp; A year ago, I thought that I wanted to go to graduate school and get my MFA in painting.&nbsp; If I had done that, I would have done the oh-so-wrong thing.&nbsp; Although I love painting, I do not want to be a painter forever.&nbsp; I want different things out of life now than I did one year ago.&nbsp; Kind of.&nbsp; And kind of not in than I am still the same Casey.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the same old Casey likes to move around.&nbsp; Granted, it's much more of a pain now that I have&nbsp;so much stuff and now that I need medical insurance.&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;

      I just got the good news that my grandma, Moms, is safely out of surgery.&nbsp; She had three vertebrae fused together this evening.&nbsp; And everyone has been sitting around nervously for hours and hours waiting to hear that she is safe and well.&nbsp; Now, the news is in.&nbsp; She is safe and well!&nbsp; Hurray!  &nbsp;  I had a really good weekend.&nbsp; I got up early Saturday morning and drove to Knoxville.&nbsp; When I got home, everyone was there.&nbsp; Ashley had just arrived the day before from Peru.&nbsp; Her pictures are amazing and she promised to go back to Machu Picchu and Cusco with me one day.&nbsp; Unfortunately, she's suffering from a cold gone wrong and her sinus infection left her feeling a little worse for the wear.  &nbsp;  Nammy and Carrie came over and we got to see pictures of Carrie, Molly and Cheston on the rollercoaster at Dollywood.&nbsp; Apparently Carrie, my sweet aunt, stayed as cool as a cucumber even on the scary rides.&nbsp; It was good to see both of them.  &nbsp;  Meanwhile, Dad spent the whole afternoon taking apart my car.&nbsp; My window buttons have now had a makeover and they are functioning snazzily.&nbsp; Is that a word?&nbsp; He's my sweetest Daddy BoBo, and it was so great driving through the mountain this morning with both my sunroof and my driver's side window open.&nbsp; Very cushy.&nbsp; Thank you, Dad.  &nbsp;  Dad also made my dream of the summer come true by taking me waterskiing.&nbsp; His new old boat, Tioga, is docked down at Duncan Boat Dock and we went out both Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; When I woke up on Sunday, I felt as though I had been beaten with a bat but it was really just my poor, unused muscles telling me to get a clue and start lifting weights again.&nbsp; Both sisters had a run on the skis on Sunday(that's right, even with a sinus infection, Ash put on a good show) and so I had to go again.&nbsp; Go again! as Carrie would say.  &nbsp;  Mom treated The Sisters to dinner out on Saturday night while Mom and Dad went to a wedding.&nbsp; So we ate Chinese and then snuggled in the parents' kingsize bed to watch Ocean's Eleven and I single-handedly polished off the chocolate eclair cake in the fridge.&nbsp; So good!&nbsp; Eating is always good at home because Mom makes lots of veggies and Dad usually grills fish: two treats that I usually don't get in my diet.&nbsp; Mom also made a delectable peach&nbsp;cobbler&nbsp;from fresh&nbsp;South Carolina peaches that I picked up&nbsp;on a roadside stand on my way home.&nbsp; I managed to polish it off on Sunday.  &nbsp;  So, yes, it was a good weekend.&nbsp; I, of course, left anxious and&nbsp;though I can never quite put my finger on where I went wrong in life, I&nbsp;leave&nbsp;Knoxville always&nbsp;feeling that I am a failure at the age of twenty-three.&nbsp; It usually takes a good cry on I-40 to shake that feeling and talk&nbsp;myself down off both the proverbial and literal ledges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it's a common feeling that&nbsp;we twenty-somethings&nbsp;get.&nbsp; Maybe it's part of growing up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      So I was telling a couple of people at work about how I am working on my inner dialogue.&nbsp; Working on it as in working on having one while other people are around.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I don't mean I want to be able to think about other things while people blabber on and on to me.&nbsp; That's just a nice bonus.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The truth is that I have a hard time putting coherent thoughts together whilst even in the vicinity of another person.&nbsp;&nbsp;This can make long car rides, roommates, and work a little dull.&nbsp; So as one of my New Year's resolutions (that's right, New Year's as in seven months ago) I decided to make a concerted effort to have inner dialogue.&nbsp; I think it's probably natural for introverts to have less of an inner dialogue while around other people.&nbsp; That might have something to do with the fact that introverts usually have to think things over and get back to you.&nbsp; This condition can be heightened by romance.&nbsp; Watch out, all you&nbsp;brave souls&nbsp;who are attempting to date an introvert.&nbsp; They will shock you by continuing important conversations days after the original conversation.&nbsp; They will think nothing of it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  All that said, my fellow colleagues have now called each other to talk about my inner dialogue.&nbsp; They are making fun of me as we speak.&nbsp; They want to know if the ability to rhyme quickly denotes a strong inner dialogue.&nbsp; I am not bothered, however, because I am considering what I will order at Taco Bell this evening.&nbsp; Should I get two 7-layer burritos or only one 7-layer burrito and a bean burrito al fresco?&nbsp; Should I perhaps stop and get a 6-pack of beer on the way home so that I can enjoy a beer after my run to the border?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I think my Inner Taco is saying, "Two 7-layers, a beer, Bonnie 'Prince' Billie sings Greatest Palace Hits, and PACK!"  &nbsp;  Thank you, Inner Taco.&nbsp; You have been most helpful.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       I officially have an allergy headache.&nbsp; I should expect no relief.&nbsp; But oddly, I feel justified.&nbsp; Now that most of my time will probably be spent between East Tennessee and Virginia, I must relinquish myself this constant, dull ache that I thought could only happen&nbsp;in those two places.&nbsp; But no, it's happening here.&nbsp; Greenville, South Carolina also contains my headache-causing pollens.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Of course, this headache could be in reaction to the flower-filled dream I had last night.&nbsp; I was on a hillside that was covered in blue wildflowers.&nbsp; In the valley, there was a little stone cottage, a dirt road, and a small chapel.&nbsp; A young&nbsp;couple walked up to the chapel and took some pictures and I remember thinking, "I didn't expect tourists to come this far out into the country but obviously these two have.&nbsp; I must live in a pretty place."    &nbsp;  I also dreamed that I tried to follow my younger sister Molly into her ballet class.&nbsp; Of course, I wasn't allowed in because I know nothing about ballet.    &nbsp;  They were both good dreams even if somehow I managed to get a sinus headache from one of them.&nbsp; Maybe I will rent a little cottage in Albemarle County and start taking ballet lessons.    &nbsp;  In other news, I rented a 15 foot van for&nbsp;the one-way drive from Greenville.&nbsp; I will pick it up next Friday and then, off to Charlottesville on Saturday!  &nbsp; &nbsp;

       I am going to miss the tree outside my window at work.&nbsp; I have spent at least 5 minutes a day at least 5 days a week for the past year staring at this tree.&nbsp; I have seen it go through all of the seasons.&nbsp; Yet another inanimate object that I feel unusually close to.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   It makes me almost proud to say that I am moving to Charlottesville because I love a boy, a real live human flesh and blood.&nbsp; At least I am not moving for a tree.&nbsp; Or a diesel engine.&nbsp; Or a job or school.&nbsp; Or art even.&nbsp; Love of a boy who can love me back seems logical even.&nbsp; And&nbsp;a lot more rewarding.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   And a lot more noble really.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   I keep thinking that I need to make excuses for moving to Charlottesville.&nbsp; Prove my strength, individuality and all-around coolness in other ways because obviously I must be a naive and silly&nbsp;girl who has forgotten that it's the 21st century.&nbsp;&nbsp;What about my career?&nbsp; And my dreams?&nbsp; Bologna and hogswallow, I say.&nbsp; Life is more complicated than making issues black-and-white like that.&nbsp; What if, instead of choosing between my career and my boyfriend, I choose both?&nbsp; What if, instead of choosing between my dreams and&nbsp;a cool, new city, I choose both? &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   So yes, I will miss the tree outside my window.&nbsp; But I would miss Chris a whole lot more if I didn't&nbsp;take this chance.   &nbsp;     &nbsp;

      If Chris listened to his phone messages today, he would realize that I have left a few inquiring messages because I am worried about his missing wallet.   "Just thinking about you.... CALL ME!"   "Has your wallet turned up? Just let me know if it does."   "Okay. This is serious now. Please call me."   Where could it be? Did someone steal it? Is it under a kitten? How about a mitten? And perhaps most importantly, why am I so worried about it? He admits he loses things sometimes. Plus, this is a problem about which I can do absolutely nothing. I want to go over to his house and ransack the place (search high and low, every nook and cranny, no stone left un-turned, etc.).   I think I just want everything to go smoothly over the next few weeks and I might be sensitive to problems, semi-problems, or even hypothetical problems. Perhaps I should consider creating a mantra to chant every time the slightest, most hypothetical problem arises. Does anyone have any suggestions?   "It's all part of the adventure, it's all part of the adventure, it's all part of the adventure..."   After all, life is a great, big adventure through this jungle of a world. And this Charlottesville adventure could prove to be one of the most exciting parts. If the world is a jungle, then my adventure buddy seems to have mis-placed his machete. Or forgotten it at the last watering hole.

      Today, I got my car's oil changed.  While the Poinsett Tire and Auto guys were doing their thing, I took the opportunity to run a few miles in an area of Greenville I don't usually run.  Just one of the benefits of running: exploring.  As a matter of fact, there are a ton of benefits to running.  Let me give a few examples....  My benefits from running:  -Logging only a few miles seems to release a flood of serotonin to my brain. -I tend to eat healthier, eat more often, and never feel guilty about giving into my food cravings when I run. -When I feel strong physically, I feel strong emotionally as well. -Running demands strong abs and strong muscles.  Thus, I tend to make ab workouts and weight-lifting, both important for your health regardless, a part of my routine. -I sleep better. -Alone time.  It's a good time to think a lot or not think at all.  Running is the best way to get good ideas, life answers, clarity, and a sense of balance and peace.  I don't care what people say about yoga, running is my zen. -Or, it can be a social time.  Some of my best friends are running buddies from various cities.  Ask anyone who has a running buddy and they will tell you, there's not another friendship like it in the world.   -Exploring new places.  The main things I remember about Sacramento, CA and Phoenix, AZ are the runs I took there.   -An appreciation for rain.  Summer rainstorms are my favorite time to run.  Rain on a run is exhilirating and speeds me up a notch.  I prefer the rain to come during the last couple of miles as opposed to the first.  After the rain stops and you start to dry off, the trucks who speed past you through rain puddles are not cool. -Feeling my heart beating in my chest.   -If I am kind of in good shape, I am more confident when I am trying new sports and let's face it: practically every sport is new to me. -Every run that I go on is a competition that I win.  Even when I have to walk half the time, I still consider it a success. -Running is a place to safely store obsessive compulsive tendencies by creating a vast, complicated network of personal running rules....      for example, some of my rules for running:  Why?  I only run when I want to.  I have never been forced to run by coaches or teams so I haven't any negative connotations to the act itself.  I do not comprehend the idea of forcing myself to run.  If I don't want to do it, I don't.  This also means that I have to be in a fairly good mood before I run.  I personally don't take myself on runs to cheer myself up.  That's what chocolate is for.   Eating?  I always eat before running.  It is preferable to eat a well-balanced meal at least two hours before running.  Sometimes a high-protein snack is okay as soon as an hour before and I have recently adopted peanuts as a pre-run snack in the mornings.   When?  The best time to run is early evening.  At that point, I have been walking around all day and my muscles are pretty warmed up and stretched out.  Also, it's a time when my energy level might be waning.  A run is a great, natural, afternoon pick-me-up.   Surface?  The carriage roads of Acadia National Park are preferable over all other running surfaces.  Broad, smooth, and un-paved, these roads also offer some of the most beautiful scenery in the world-as-I-know-it.  Even if there is a sidewalk, I prefer the asphalt of streets.  There's something about the look of concrete sidewalks that conjurs up images of myself in a wheelchair at the age of 35.  I don't really know if there is a huge difference in asphalt and concrete... but in my head there is.  I am neurotic about it, yes.  Distance? Around 6 miles is the perfect regular-length run.  It is not too far but it gives me time to think.  When in good running shape, a five mile run should be the minimum distance of any run.  When in a time crunch, 30 minute tempo-runs can suffice.   Racing?  I am not very fast so 5K and 10K are a little too short for me.  I enjoy building endurance and have the irrational and yet hopeful dream of someday getting the best time in my age group in some little half-marathon.     The key?  Hydration.  If I don't drink enough water, I will assuredly have a terrible run.  Water is my secret to happy running.  Up or down?  Almost always uphill.  Not as hard on my joints and feels great for my quads and gluts.  Stretching?  Always stretch before and always stretch after a run.    See how the rules go on and on?  And believe me, I could continue yet.  I won't but this was fun to write.  Running is on my mind a lot lately.  It's like a companion or a friend or a therapist.  Speaking of little inanimate friends, I have also been thinking of my car as a close companion lately.  It seems like he's been with me for a lot of big moves and adventures.   I love that scene at the beginning of Disney's 101 Dalmations when all of the owners and their dogs look alike.  And then Pongo and Perdita, the dalmations, meet in the park one day, they bring their owners, Roger and Anita, together into a happy little family.  In my head, there's an animated version of Chris's Honda and my old Benz meeting and falling for each other.  Of course, they bring Chris and I together and the four of us go on many misadventures.       Meanwhile, in the real world of astrology:  My horoscope in the Greenville News yesterday predicted that surrounding myself with art, films, books, and good conversation will soon spark a renewed output of creativity.

      It's not uncommon for me to stare at my ceiling until the wee hours of the morning these days.  Memories of my past year's work schedule (closing the library at 1 A.M.) lingers in my body clock, forcing me to expend lots of energy during the day to fight the tendency to stay awake until 3 in the morning.  Hence, my renewed interest in running.  Last night was a somewhat sleepless one.  I made four, separate attempts at sleep before finally drifting off around 3 A.M.  Actually, it was a good night to be sleepless for a couple of reasons.    First, Chris didn't get home from work until pretty late so I wouldn't have been able to talk to him--a great conversation including our Big Move Plan and the Rules of Late Nite Eating.  All very important.   Second reason: Yesterday, I found out that my last day living on White Oak Road is now officially Saturday, July 24th--pushing the date forward one week.  (Forward toward the present, that is.  Not forward toward the distant future, the way I always consider time pushing.  That's considered "backwards.")  The result of this push?  A little flame was lit under my you-know-what, inspiring me to pack until about 2 A.M.  The packing helped me realize what I needed to get today:  more boxes for packing.  So I made another stop by the ABC liquor store where I was guilted into buying a bottle of ruby port wine.  Do you see the sweet rewards that a sleepless night can bring?  Other things I accomplished before sleep at 3 A.M.: -I read another 30 pages of the Neverending Story, oh, um, I mean, Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix. -I made a grocery list for today's Bi-Lo stop. -I tried on the dress that I bought for Mike and Quanah's wedding.  I admit it.  It came down to vanity and boredom but what else is a girl to do at that hour of the morning?  And yes, it still fits.  And yes, I still love that dress.  -I also decided to try to hit up Knoxvegas this weekend since I am so far along in packing and apparently sleepless anyway (Knoxville is a sleepless city for me).  That means an oil change tomorrow... or maybe Thursday.  Where has time been pushing itself off to these past couple of weeks...?  So my hours after 1 A.M. did not go to waste but I am tired, grouchy, and a bottomless pit for food today.  I guess that's the price one must pay for using the hours after 1 A.M.

      Warning: A rant to follow....  As I sit here at my desk applying alternate doses of hydrocortisone and benedryl creams to my aching, itching, inner thigh, I take some comfort in the knowledge that the yellow jackets who so foolishly decided to build their nest in my front door are now buzzing around yellow jacket heaven.  Actually, I like to think of them in yellow jacket hell.    This second sting is worse than my first sting of a few weeks ago.  The oval bite is a mere 4X2 inches but red, puffy skin stretches at least one foot down my thigh and spans a good six inches.    I am being punished by nature for not recycling.  That's right, folks, I do not recycle.  At least, I haven't for the past six months as I do not have a blue recycle bin and I do not know where to get one and I really do not care enough to try to find one.  Plus, I am leaving in two weeks and I feel certain that my new, yet-to-be-determined apartment complex will offer recycling bins for every paper, plastic, aluminum, and cardboard fathomable.  So scorn me, ridicule me, kick me out of town.  I am leaving anyway.  Why, you may ask, do I feel so much guilt for my six month recycling hiatus?    Why, you may also ask, do I link my recycling sins to my wasp-killing sins?  In a word, Academia.  My old college buddy K., let's call her, stayed with me for a couple of nights last month on her way through Greenville.  This particular pal began a biology PhD program last fall.  During her visit, she chastised me for not recycling, not eating organic food, my desire to kill the wasps who live in my door, and my other non-hipster actions.  Fortunately, I read a couple of books this year that she deemed respectable (I didn't mention that I am currently reading Harry Potter. That is so not hip).  But the visit did not go well as I felt my life in constant judgment, a feeling I don't handle well.  Nothing brings out Hostile Casey so much as the judgment of others.  She really hurt my feelings.  (I am working on my sensitive reactions to judgment.  If I ever move back to my home town, it is safe to assume I have conquered the anxiety.)    But my question is, does anyone else find Academia to be an utter bore and perhaps a slice of bologna too?  Doesn't it seem like continuing straight through on the Academic Super Highway could produce some creatures un-creative and holier-than-us?  For instance, K.  will never herself be a waitress but I will never forget the romantic respect K. began giving waitresses after reading a Tom Robbins novel.  If not for this very hip author, she admitted she would have gone on thinking of waitresses as people either too lazy or too stupid to do anything else.  Does that idea seem snobby to anyone?  How about sickening?      To me, the lack of respect for all things non-academic seems narrow-minded.    Of course, I too have settled into my dogmatic, judgmental ways of wondering why the yellow-jacket-hell we cannot all just try to respect each other's lives?    And no, I really don't have to rant like this but it is taking my mind off the sting.   P.S. My last day of work is official-- July 23rd.  My fabulous boss pushed it back for me.  It will all work out perfectly!!

      Meredith, Beth and I are the girls who lived in the 100-year-old farm house on White Oak Road.  Beth still lives in the upstairs of the house.  Meredith moved to Columbia (the city, not the country) where she is about to begin her first year as an elementary school art teacher and I moved out of the farm house but I still live on White Oak.  We were all art majors at Furman and we all spent the Fall of 2001 in Cortona, Italy.  Between Furman, the art department (we were a small, exclusive crowd), Italy and living in the house on White Oak, we have a lot of ties to each other.  Last night the three of us went to Barley's for pizza and beer and then we walked down to see Beth's artwork that is hanging in a nicer restaurant in the West End, a restaurant where none of us can afford an appetizer and a restaurant hung with artwork that none of us can afford either.  The only difference is that they are Beth's paintings.  They are beautiful.  I swoon at her colors and I am especially enamored by an Adam and Eve set of paintings.  They would look perfect in the foyer that I do not have.  I have been thinking about our lives.  In many ways, we are as alike as any three girls can be.  East Tennesseeans with Furman, Italy, and art to shape our last few years.  But we are still set on such different paths.  Being around other women-especially these girls who I know so well-gives me a lot of peace about who I am and how I am moving on with my life.  I see them making life decisions and I think, "That's the perfect thing for her."  Maybe they do not see their decisions so clearly defined by who-they-are  but a little outside perspective gives me the opportunity to appreciate the grace with which they both have become strong, self-assured women.  The thing is that I am proud of all of us White Oak Road Girls.  In my eyes, we have already made it.  Even though all of the things the world uses to qualify us hasn't happened quite yet (read: degree, career, marriage, etc.), we are as full and happy now as we will ever be.  The other things will come naturally.

      This morning I slept through my alarm clock and a phone call from Mom.  Instead, I awoke an hour late to the sound of my stomach whispering, "Spudnuts, spudnuts, I want spudnuts!"    That's never happened before.  But then again, I had never even heard of the delectable treat that is a Spudnut until this past weekend.  A Spudnut is a donut made of potatoes and it is sold at a little shop with the same name.  Although I shy away from donuts in general (I admit it.  I am condescending toward breakfast foods that contain little to no nutritive value), Chris talked me into going.  And oh,oh,oh! was I glad that he did.  Nevermind that I didn't ingest anything but sugar and caffeine until lunch and nevermind that my future in Charlottesville now includes a devastatingly high fat craving.  I welcome the challenge.  The only problem with my craving this morning was that I was approximately seven hours away from the closest Spudnut when my stomach awoke me with its swan song.  Although I considered it, I am still recovering from this past weekend's 14 hours of driving and decided that the glazed, tater pastries would just have to wait.  Instead, my plan was to eat a handful of peanuts.  I inherited a can of Virginia peanuts (a coincidence?  I think not.) from my sister, Ashley, when she left for Peru and I have discovered that peanuts are a perfect food to eat before a morning run.  My plan is to drink eight ounces of coffee, about sixteen ounces of water and a handful of peanuts before stretching and pounding out a few miles.  After a run, I eat a real breakfast.  This morning, however, my Spudnut craving drowned out the peanut plan and I ended up eating no nuts at all.     Now this is personal, I realize, but I do not believe in NOT eating before a run and neither do I believe in NOT eating breakfast.  I mean, I do not go so far as to judge others who choose to skip eating before they run or start their day but these are just a couple of way-of-life rules, habits that I have settled into at the tender age of twenty-three.  I conjecture they will continue into my old age.  We shall see.  The run was a good one though.  I learned that I can run seven miles on an almost empty stomach.  Perhaps the Annie's breakfast burrito that I ate at eleven o'clock last night counted as a really early breakfast.  And the moral of the story is that despite the fact that my plans and dreams for breakfast this morning were both thwarted, I was able to perservere... spudnuts, peanuts, or no nuts at all.  And in other news, things are pretending like they just might work out with the logistics of this move.  We have a found an apartment for the right price in the right part of town and Barnes and Noble called me this afternoon to schedule an interview.  Of course, "Things All Working Out" is still Plan B.      I am still preparing for Plan A which is "Things Not Working Out At All".

         In every good adventure, there's that time before the adventure begins and after the life-altering decisions have been made when all a girl can do is sit around in a cloud of self-doubt.  I twiddle my thumbs and surf the internet for apartments that I cannot afford.  I watch old seasons of The Sopranos and send my resume in for jobs that I will never get.  I box up books and wait and worry and worry and wait.  And so, in an attempt to get out of the cloud and start seeing my move to Charlottesville for what it really is-a subtle but substantial adventure, a simple but exciting move-I have decided to start a blog.       Hopefully it will not only serve as a sort of forced self-reflection but also a log where my family and friends can find out what I am up to.    Since this is a Prologue, I should give a little bit of background information.  I will post a more in-depth bio at some point but for now, the following will have to suffice:  My name is Casey Hannifin (well, Harriett Case Hannifin if you want to be technical) and I am currently in the process of quitting my first job out of college and moving to Charlottesville, Virginia-a city I have visited only briefly but one which contains a boy I am particularly fond of.  The truth is, I just needed a change.  Somewhere along the lines, I seem to have lost that zest for life that makes waking up everyday both exciting and terrifying.  I need a jolt to the system and a new town will offer the uncertainties that create hope and inspire both excitement and terror.    I am leaving my job at my alma mater's library, the James B. Duke Library of Greenville, South Carolina's Furman University, where I have been working for five years if you count my four years as an undergrad checking out books and pulling paper out of jammed microfilm machines.  My current job is as evening supervisor at the library and I have really loved working until 1 AM this past year but now that my social world has dwindled down to my ficus tree as friends have left town for adventures of their own, I am forced to reconsider my original plan to stay in place for a little while(ha! who was I kidding?) and follow where life leads me.
