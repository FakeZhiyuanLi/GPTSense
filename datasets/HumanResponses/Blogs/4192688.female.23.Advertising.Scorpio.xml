      How do I even start the “Swingers Story”?  I guess the same way as I start everything in my life that surprises anyone – on the Internet.  The match.com Story  Cruising around on match.com, and not being particularly single is really a trip.  If not for pure amusement alone, match.com is worth at least the three-day trial.  There really is no other excuse for signing up other than the desperation of being in a new city (let alone New York City) and not knowing a soul.  Ok, a male soul. One of the ‘features’ of match.com is 50% of off some of the “Match.com Live” events that happen once on occasion around the city. So naturally, being an event planner, I checked these out.  NYC Sex Museum on February 11th.  Why the fuck not?!   I sent the email to my buddy Dan with the header: ‘We are so doing this!’   I think it was partly “I want to do this, so come with me”, and part “this is so weird, we have to do this for the sake of doing it”.  Seeing as though the one reason Dan and I get along is directly related to our eagerness to undertake events such as this – we made reservations and were totally geared up to go to the sex museum. Wednesday rolls around.  Pretty much your typical Wednesday.  I made it over to NYC after a long, involved commute from Long Island to find Dan standing around 13th and University “holding” me a spot.  Even though the spot would have only comfortably accommodated a Ford Focus, he insisted on parallel parking me there.  Two minutes later, tipped off by a very unwelcome scraping sound, I was all-to-aware that my truck had been backed ON TO a compact car behind me.   I guess in New York it is no big deal to significantly damage another vehicle. I waited inside Dan’s apartment for Dan, actually, and even though we had to be at the event at 7:30, he decided to take a shower at 7:10.  Usually this would set me off, but I am trying to be better about this in my attempt to counteract East Coast mentality.  I just played with the dog and it was all good.  7:45 rolls around and we’re in a cab headed toward 5th Avenue toward the Sex Museum.  Dan, amidst his story about his snowboard boots, tells me that the reason we were late/he reeks is because he just smoked up.  Um, so where’s the love?  Well, my friends, the love comes later.  The NYC Sex Museum  We arrive at the sex museum and any of you who think you might have trouble finding it – well, you won’t.  It is a glowing red building.  Quite appropriate, actually, for about what we were to encounter. Imagine your mom and dad.  Now imagine them if they were single.  And then put a bunch of your friends’ moms and dads (the single version) in a room.  Wow.  Oh, yeah, also add one “couple” of young, attractive not-so-singles.  That’s us, and man, did we stick out.   For the most part, Dan and I are the perfect couple without actually being a couple.  We do the couple-y type things that involved couples just wish they could do.  But that’s pretty much where it ends.  We have the freedoms of being single, but the security of having a partner.  I don’t know how it happened, but it’s absolutely wonderful and I celebrate the oddity that is our relationship.  The minute that we walk in to the match.com event, it’s obvious that we don’t belong there.  It is SO obvious that we don’t belong there.  Yet, that just fuels us to stay even longer – I guess to observe.  Downing our complimentary “Original Sin” hard ciders, we start to browse the NYC Sex Museum collection, which includes (but is-oh-not-so-limited-to) photography books, handy condom carriers, NYC guides, and displays upon displays of sex toys.   Three beers deep, I find myself perusing the dildos and making jokes.  This only attracts a crowd because, well, I’m the youngest woman in attendance amongst a crowd of 40-something males.  Oh, and I’m talking about dildos.  Good timing that Dan decided to go off and use the restroom.  I was like the weak, 3-legged prey amongst the hunger-stricken desperate jungle beasts.  I am still not sure if he did it on purpose, or if he really had to use the bathroom.  Luckily, I am a social diva and can handle these types of situations.  Plus, I got a free beer (reminding the audience that all the beers were complimentary) from this guy that was, “just here with his brother”.  After wondering exactly what we were here to see, we made our way up the stairs to the “exhibit”.  And by “exhibit” I mean straight up porn.  I think the concept was to depict how sex has changed New York City, er, or, how New York City has changed sex, but all I specifically remember was watching a distinctly “this-must-have-been-before-AIDS” gangbang that seriously blew my mind.  Apart from the creepy-creepies that followed us around (who were able to correctly identify 70s porn “actresses”) we just really were in amazement of all of the pictures and cocksucking that was going on that, somehow, had fallen under the art umbrella.  The Inquiry  Enter: Dan Vene, Interested Party. Following the post-indulgence of the exhibit, I hung out down in the lobby (read: where there was free beer) for quite awhile alone before I started to wonder about Dan.  I found him up at the front desk exchanging business cards with la crème de la crème du la Sex Museum staff.  I came in halfway into the conversation, but I gathered quickly that the woman (curator) at the museum was recommending us to a few clubs around the area.   So I guess it’s just right around the corner.  So I guess the woman (AT THE SEX MUSEUM) recommended it to us.  So I guess we were feeling adventurous.  So I guess we needed somewhere else to go. Enter: The Trapeze, Totally Insane Swingers Night Club.   In complete, pure retrospect I will say that if we knew what we were getting ourselves into, we would have gone anywhere else to get a drink.  I mean, anywhere.   Instead, we find ourselves outside of “The Trapeze”, a bar/club/establishment only known either to stout regulars or whomever had the keen eyesight to notice the purposefully discrete sign.  This should have been a warning to all.  We walked up to the doors and realized they were locked.  But, being drunk and determined, we rang the bell located to the side of the door.  Several times.  A very distinct French accent yelled at us and directed us inside, where we found out that there was 1.  No beer, and 2.  A $110 cover.  Two minor setbacks.  But it’s Dan and Kris, not to be outdone by some French guy. Amidst the mid-February New York chill, we walked down the street to a deli, where we bought a couple of 40s: His and Hers, Bud and Coors Light.  We then took these ill-pocket-fitting monstrosities to The Trapeze, where we (he) paid the $110 cover and we were allowed admission beyond the dungeon doors.  The nice gentleman at the door handed us a card and a key.  The card, apparently, was an all-inclusive 3-month membership, The key, however, was much more involved- and indirectly the best part of the night.  Bur first, the ambiance. Picture Fraggle Rock on crack.  Or, a Chinese buffet gone bad.  Or, for simplicity’s sake- a dungeon.  With red lights.  And lots, and lots of naked people.   Back to the key, which was… to the locker in which our clothes must be placed.  If you just read that, then you realize that we were asked (told) to remove all of our clothes.  For the record, Dan was ready to turn around and leave.  I, for the record, dropped my pants and threw them into the locker and shrugged, as if to say, “What the fuck, why not?”  The Things That Cannot be Undone  I think it took him a couple minutes to realize I was standing in front of him, publicly, completely naked except for a pair of very flattering panties that I’d (strategically, as if in anticipation of something like this) chosen to wear that night.  I’d called his bluff and he had no other choice but to follow suit.  Outfitted in only a towel reminiscent of Motel 6, I wandered out from the locker area, past the guy masturbating while staring at me, and near a large, guarded opening. I walked into a room that looked like it was straight out of Austin Powers’ bedroom.  No less than 20 people had snuggled in all together and engaged in some kind of huge freak orgy.  Mind you, there is no soothing Kenny G going on in the background, no humming of any kind of running machines, nothing.  Just really, really uncomfortable, awkward fucking sounds.  Bodies slapping, juicy squirts, you get the idea.  Leave?  No!  Onward upstairs, to the four closest-to-each-other rooms I have ever seen.  Also, the only other room besides the actual dentist’s office with a dentist chair in it.  Also wins the award for best creative use of a dentist’s chair in a sex club.  Ugh.  I am pretty sure I saw some things up on the second floor that, had I not seen them, I may in fact had lived a perfect life.  At this point, Dan is grinning like a little kid watching on to a couple that was participating in what I would call a very distinct “swapping” sex practice.  I turned the opposite way and faced Dan, whispering in his ear,”OK, it is NOW time to go…”  He patted my back in some sort of consoling way, and right when it began working I felt his hand start to creep up my naked, very very vulnerable leg.  I looked at him in the face and narrowed my eyes at him, as if to say “What the fuck exactly do you think you’re doing?!” when instead I said, “How many hands are you touching me with?” at which point he said, “Two, why?” I then said, “Where are they?” and he proceeded to rub the two hands that he had on my back.  Oh, but my friends, THERE WAS A THIRD.  I alerted Dan to this fact, since I was pretty sure he was not a three-handed man.  He leaned forward and looked behind me and then sternly said, “Do NOT turn around”, which is JUST as effective as “Don’t look now!” So I did look.  And the 50 year-old Chinese lady whose fascination was moving briskly up my leg looked back at me.  I would go on, but getting felt up by a 50-year old Chinese lady in a sex club is pretty hard to top.  The End  I am scarred for life.

      OK, I just moved here a month ago and have been using myspace and yahoo personals to try and meet some people since I work with all women (seriously all women). I'm in a relationship but I'm just looking for people to talk to or hang out with...  I just got e-mails today from two guys, one of which said he's sorry for "wasting my time", since I just am looking for friends and the other saying that thanks for trying, but his "dating plate is full".  Dating plate is full??!!!!! Haha!!!!!!!!!!!  These people crack me up

      The note that was on my truck this morning.   There is no reason why you keep parking here. There is 3 cars in this house. I understand if in front of your house there was no parking that is fine. But when its empty and we end up taking up everyone else's parking its a shame. If you would like to speak to me I get home at 6pm. Elba. * Note that this is on a public street. This would only happen in New York...

        I was thinking today exactly what kind of       relationship I have with Starbucks.  I feel as though I have to stop       there every morning and get the same kind of coffee before work starts or       I'll have a bad day.  Earlier in the week, I tried stopping at       Dunkin' Donuts to get coffee instead and I found myself driving 3 more       miles out of my way just to go to Starbucks again two days later.  I       mean, the Dunkin' Donuts coffee actually tasted better AND it cost       less.  But, I think I have it figured out.             Starbucks is usually anti-trash.  Meaning, when you go to       Starbucks, you are not expecting to see homeless people shacked up next to       the door on the way in or seagull shit streaking down the windows.        The people that they pick to work there are usually well-groomed and       friendly to your face.  No doubt that they're the same cracked-out       teenage mothers that work any other foodservice job but at Starbucks at       least they smoke *behind* the building.  That's worth the extra $.30       to me.

      Dude, Yahoo! Personals needs some serious improvements. Okay, one word: SCREENING. There are billions of people on this earth, a percentage of which will ever choose to post a free ad on Yahoo! Personals, right? Well an even smaller percentage of these people have actually interacted with other people face-to-face. Yahoo!, listen. Want to make some money? Screen your freakin' site. It may be discriminatory to only list ads which contain semi-normal-looking people, but at least you can implement a system in which the most attractive people are seen first. Ever seen  urlLink http://www.hotornot.com/ ? Make it a part of Yahoo! Personals. As much as I'd like to spend my time sifting through "nice guys", I'd rather see the hot ones first. Plus, everyone knows that girls don't go for nice guys (hence, the finishing last thing). Two: And I could be wrong, but I thought I lived in a free country. There is this whole freedom of speech thing that we have going here which I've heard pretty good things about. Apparently, Yahoo! doesn't subscribe to the same system. Try writing: GETTING MY BALLS LAMINATED in your personal headline and you'll be e-bombed with virtual slaps on the wrist from Yahoo! I know, because I tried. It's a personal ad. I guess I have a problem with a service (for which I'm paying) putting parameters on how I can express myself. That just means that the more people that decide to meet each other, the more disappointed they will be when they realize that the person they've met is nothing like their ad (because that never happens, right?). I mean, if I'm looking for someone to slap my ass or someone to laminate my balls I think I should have the option to explicitly state that within my description. That's only fair. Yahoo!'s failure to correct these two situations has directly contributed to my horrid experience on their personals site. No one likes to be made an example of, so here are some below (And as for those couple cool people I met, yeah, you're still cool and stuff): Apparently you don't have to be able to speak English or know how to read in order to use this site. Grammatical and spelling errors will be preserved to illustrate my point:   HE SAYS  "hi i know your probably not interested but im going to try anyways but i tried you look great."  I SAY  Are you fucking kidding me? One, you have no picture, and two, the self-deprecating thing only works if you're really hot. But, I wouldn't know because you don't have a picture. Try learning English, it works well for picking up other people that also speak it.    HE SAYS  i read your ad and i also read your match. i feel u have same kind of expectaions that i have ... why not call me at 614-******* take care . bye  I SAY  Well, I'm glad you can read. Did you read the part where I said I was looking for intelligence? Didn't think so.    HE SAYS  I am outside your parameters but eveytime i go through the ads you put a smile on my face and had to let you know you did a great job. Youre pics are great and the one with the "I slept with Kirk" T shirt makes me laugh everytime. (this message goes on for two pages.)  I SAY  You should have stopped with "I am outside your parameters". And I make you laugh "everytime"? How many times are you looking at me? Creepy.    HE SAYS  Hey Kris, I was hoping to hear from you but perhaps you are not interested now. That is too bad as I had a strong feeling about you (us). I hope you reconsider and write me. I think you are what I need in my life and hope you take a chance.  I SAY  Um, was I ever interested? Do I know you? What 'us'? Dude, you're really givin' off the stalker vibe. Sounds like the only chance I'll be taking is not locking my door.    HE SAYS  Then even though I didn’t have the best of dates from those I met here, I decided to throw up another $19.95, as you seemed worth the chance! Lol………………..  I SAY  Uh, yeah...    HE SAYS  ...3.Hendricks and a few rapers  I SAY  The question was: "Which musician would you bring back from the dead and why?". After this answer, I wish I hadn't asked anything. I really hope he meant rappers.   *Athletic body means ATHLETIC BODY- not FAT. *Age range 22-29 does not include 38. *I don't care about how much money you have and how well your business is doing. Where in my ad does it say that I'm a money-grubbing gold-digging whore?

      Back in the summer of 1999, I was working as a receptionist for Tansky's Sawmill Toyota when one of the car salesmen came up to me with a "tip".  I followed him to a discreet space in the hallway where he quietly informed me that Lady Chance Number Seven (or some other equally cliche horse-name - I can't remember) was a sure bet tonight.  Odds were 2:1.  Partly because I wanted to believe that I could make $40 on $20, and partly because I had not a clue what he was talking about - I gave him $20 for Lady Chance Number Seven.  Then I forgot about the whole situation. The next day he dropped an envelope in front of me on the desk with my name written on it - and sure enough - containing $40.  I don't quite understand the whole thing, but I am pretty sure I just won money for betting on a horse. So how do they make money anyway?  I mean, I realize more people lose than win, but who hangs around with the homies on a Friday night and says, "Hey, let's not go to the bars tonight - let's go bet on horses"?  I don't know, is it fun to watch?  I don't get it. Second, if this guy had such a great tip, why did he feel compelled to tell me about it?  From what I understand, the more people that take the lower end of that bet, the better the odds get - meaning that the chances of winning more money would get worse.  So... yeah - don't understand that either. Third, is horse racing like WWE wrestling or something?  Is there a hidden horse script that I am not aware of?  Do the horses know? And, if there isn't - and it's totally up to chance then why are there even odds in the first place?  And why do the gangsters always win?  I do not understand horse racing.

      Today, my newsbot appropriately picked up the following news story from dailypress.com:  EBay Buys 25 Percent Stake in Craigslist    I heard craigslist just had an IPO, so I guess I should have expected that someone would be buying - but eBay?! - Fuck!! During my time living on Long Island I quickly learned that craigslist was part of the unwritten "Guide to Living Savvy in New York", not to mention one of the quickest ways to find an apartment or somebody's extra closet to live in for less than $1000/month.  Personals; Community; Events; For Sale; Jobs.  It was all there - user-free, ad-free, and gloriously uncensored.  Now what?  Another ad spot for eBay to throw in a sidebar that picks up on every word you're typing in?    I can see it now:    "Looking for  Discreet m/m near 42nd ?  Find Discreet m/m near 42nd  on eBay!  Click here to search for  Discreet m/m near 42nd  on eBay now!"    Sigh. Check out the full story at  urlLink dailypress.com

      Seriously.  All of these "Anyone But Bush" stickers have really gotten me thinking.  Everyone keeps complaining about the lack of good choices for the presidential candidacy this year, but I think that complaining does little good without a solution. Here is mine:   If you think about it, Nick is very good at appearing to be the perfect human being - and is this not what every politician strives to do every day?  He really is a well-rounded, educated, self-sufficient, yet sensitive man.  I like him; my boyfriend likes him.  He appeals to everyone in at least one way or another.  Some other reasons that Nick Lachey would be a great president:     Nick was raised in Ohio.  Everyone knows that Ohio is the greatest state in the Union. And the Midwest breeds modesty as you can see in this quote by Nick:   "Growing up in the midwest grounds you in a way that you don't get everywhere," says Nick, who grew up in Cincinnati before moving to Los Angeles to realize his dreams. "I love it there. "But I can't see myself handling things any differently than I have thus far. I've always maintained an attitude of staying as humble as I possibly could."      Nick is an athlete, which naturally makes him a team player.  Through sports, it is likely that he has learned the importance of time management, team building, responsibility, and accountability.   Nick attended Miami of Ohio in his persual of a sports management degree.  So naturally, by attending Miami he is aware of which social trends and fashions are popular and how to be fake when necessary.  Very important for someone who may need to make decisions that they don't intend to fulfill later.   Also, if you haven't noticed, Nick Lachey is an attractive man.  It is common knowledge that people are more willing to succesfully negotiate with attractive people.  This would be great for our foreign policy.     Nick Lachey is an outdoorsy, woodsman-type, "I own a hunting dog" type of guy who can light a fire and put up his own tent in the woods.  He is pretty much the next Macguyver. I am pretty confident that if our country was to experience another massive terrorist attack, Nick Lachey would have a plan to stop it.   Nick has a great sense of humor.  He did marry Jessica Simpson.  However, my favorite quote by Nick Lachey was on the episode of Newlyweds in which he and Jessica were shopping for a puppy.  Nick wanted a Siberian Husky (great choice, Nick), but in line with her personality, Jessica wanted a high-maintenance, fluffy, yippy dog.  In his and his future husky's defense, Nick told Jessica:   Nick: "Jessica, it's a proven fact.  Huskies don't even get that big."  Jessica:  "I just can't see myself picking up 80 pound poops."  Nick:  "I can't see you picking up much of anything." .  That's just funny.    If you have more reasons, email me.  I'm getting a head start for 2008.  Oh, and don't tell Nick I'm doing this.  One, it's a surprise and two, he doesn't know me.

        For the last couple of months, while I've been relentlessly searching for a job, I have been doing contract promotional work in the meantime. Promotional work has a lot of glamour and everyone always wants to know how you got your job, but the probability that you will run into some shady-like business practices is more than likely, especially when working for a "modeling" agency. So if you're not familiar with what the hell I'm even talking about, think about how many times you've been to a fair or to an event where there have been corporate-sponsored booths or booths where people are handing out free samples, or events where you can test new products, etc. The big shocker - none of those people even work for the company with which you perceive they are affiliated. They're outsourced. The spiky-haired guy handing you free samples of steak sauce? He's a "Work now, Get Paid Now" temp hire sent to the client by a local temp agency. The guy who sets up the booths and manages the promotional staff at a free sample tent? He works for a promotional agency, travels around with the event all over the nation and gets paid $900/week. Any promotional staff at a test-drive or automotive-related event? All models. Presumably, the mighty corporate sponsor which you are so diligently representing doesn't know the event is even taking place, let alone that you even exist. Meanwhile, you're getting paid a hefty $14 an hour, standing out in the 85-degree heat with teeny khaki shorts and a perma-smile in a very superficial attempt to build up their priceless customer brand loyalty. Do you want this job yet?     Let's talk about modeling agencies. There is most certainly a cascading hierarchy of modeling agencies across the nation. I would assume at the top would be places that do actual runway stuff in places like New York and Miami. Then you have your print stuff for magazines, posters, etc. Random other stuff, blah blah... And then at the bottom, you have your so-called "promotional modeling agencies" that hire models for "print" work and promotions. From my personal experience working with other models, it is apparent to me that they must recruit people from glamourous spots such as the mall, strip clubs and bus stations, doing "print work" in JC Penny and Sears ads. The way it works is that you express interest in working for a certain client at a certain event, you send in your resume detailing what other promotional work you have done, and then a picture of yourself. Your "agency" will then forward your picture to the client (and believe me, most companies do this) and if the client approves you (read: thinks you are attractive enough to represent their brand) then you win the opportunity to exploit yourself (and the product) in front of a very pretty girl-hungry crowd of the lowest common denominator of the human population. Depending on the degree of humiliation, the skimpiness of the outfit you have to wear, and the size of the client you can make anywhere from $10-$40 an hour doing this type of work.     The perks of doing this are, obviously, the ability to steal as many of whatever samples you're handing out for whatever client as well as the "premiums" (read: the cool stuff) that are meant for the customers. Working in concert venues, you are given all-access usually to the venue so if it is someone good then that might be worth a day's work in itself. Working for upscale clients, such as Cadillac or Hummer, may land you some really cool premium items especially if you're very sneaky about sticking them into your purse when the field managers are not around. The key to doing this is picking the right clients and the right venues. I will give you a great example of a good pick and a bad pick.   Good pick:  Working a Cadillac appreciation promotion in which a very high-class golf course is rented out to give clients a day's worth of golf clinics, test-driving all Cadillac vehicles, and a very, very nice goodie bag at the end of the day. You get: $100 Cadillac golf shirt, several Cadillac goodie bags containing very nice golf items, to test drive the Escalade on one of the country's nicest golf courses, and $15 an hour. Not bad.  Bad pick  Working a Trojan Condoms promotion at Ozzfest. You get: to give away "Shared Pleasure" condoms to guys who paid money to come see the original Black Sabbath and Judas Priest reuinion, to wear a short black skirt around a population of the dirtiest (physical and otherwise) men all in one place at the same time, to endure hours worth of the same unoriginal pick up line, and as many free condoms as you can fit in ... your skin-tight Trojan "Hottie" tank top. Sigh.    I really like the "Praise the Whore" shirt.       Several times I have mentioned payment for these types of promotions. And I admit, it isn't bad considering all the bullshit you can get away with on these tours. But with most things, there is a catch. When you sign your contract to do a promotion, you're signing an agreement that it can take anywhere from 30-45 days to receive payment for that event. Well, if you get payment within 45 days, consider yourself lucky. There are promotions that I worked back in June for which I still have not received payment. I think they are hoping that you are unorganized and unable to keep records of your work history. Some companies are very good about getting payment to you when their pay period is over and sometimes they get your check to you right away. Good companies to work for are Kandu Marketing, Take Out Marketing, and Momentum. Companies that you should NOT deal with if you ever want to get paid:        Encore Nationwide     DIZON Modeling Agency     National Talent Resource (NTR)        That is my official shit list as of right now. Pass it on. If, for some reason, you are interested in working these kinds of jobs, I can hook you up. A forwarning, though, once you get on those mailing lists it is like being in a gang - a lot harder to get out than to get in. Good luck.

       urlLink    Devil Dog!  Check out Riley's website  urlLink here .  We put Riley on  urlLink Dogster  last night and we really do believe that he is the cutest Siberian Husky on the site.  There are a couple other huskies that we would let him play with but for the most part he really is the cutest.  He is officially listed as  Riley "Poopypants" Hanaway .  This morning, however, I received an invitation from a toy poodle that wants Riley to be in his doggie playgroup.  I mean, I am sure that the toy poodle means well, but Riley would fancy using it as a chew toy if they were in a  real  playgroup.  He also got an invitation from a Yorkshire Terrier.  Once again, I have seen Riley eat birds that were larger than Yorkshire Terriers.  Do we really want him playing with those dogs?  I was kind of hoping to have all Siberian Huskies on his Dogster profile in hopes of building a strong, good-looking dog sled team later on when he gets more mature and stops eating fabric and random outside hairballs.    Am I being too picky? ; urlLink
