      Do y'all remember that movie?  Well Jay met my family (minus Lorne) on Wednesday night at our class's steak night fundraiser.  He was a little nervous, and I was a little nervous....my dad has a bad habit of making crude jokes.  We have all come to accept and live with them, but you know, it's always a little scary around someone new ;)  But everyone hit it off, and all went well.  Wasn't too much like the movie ;)  It was only the 4th time I have actually hung out with Jay, but yet, wow, I feel like I have known him my whole life.  Conversation is so easy, and I just feel really comfortable around him.  I really like what we have going for us, and look forward to what God has in store.

      As I sit here, on the only day in my life that school has been cancelled because of the cold (but of course it had to fall on my clinic night :P:P:P:P), I am reminded of a little poem I wrote in the summer of 2002 when I was working full time in a parkade booth and it was about +35C.  Today it is -42C and feels like -55C with the windchill, brrrrrr!  Anyway, I read this poem and it just made me chuckle and wish that it was +35C right now...  So very hot, sitting perfectly still, sweating. Nearly naked people, freely walk the street trying to escape  the scorching heat. Wind blows, like hot breath on your neck. Beads of sweat  form on your temple, and trickle down to your chin. No escape from this torment. Skin sticks to any surface it touches. You don't want to move but you must. You peel your flesh away from the surfaces you are touching. Ouch!

      I am very impressed with the city's move to pass the no smoking bylaw.  Being a non-smoker, I am looking forward to being in restaurants, malls, and maybe even on the rare occasion a night club without having my eyes burn and having to cough and sputter (even though I still live with 2 smokers :P).  I am happy about it!  My dad on the other hand is really really really mad.  He is a smoker, and has been since he was 18 years old (he's 50 now), and I am pretty certain that as long as he has lungs and a hand to hold a cigarette in, always will be.  He figures that the non smokers are persecuting the smokers by not allowing them the right to smoke whenever/where ever they want.  He believes that 2nd hand smoke is not damaging to those who inhale it....yeah I know, he's a very stubborn man.  There was an article in the Star Phoenix (on Saturday I think), by Les McPherson, about the smoking bylaw.  How it is silly to ban smoking on public restaurant patios.  My dad read that and heartily agreed with it.  He loved how Les pointed out that 10,000 deaths per year are caused by physician mistakes, compared to ONLY 3,000 caused by 2nd hand smoke inhalation.  Well if you ask me 3,000 is a lot of preventable deaths.  It is a little surprising the number of deaths caused by doctors, but how can we prevent those?  I am reminded of watching Oprah one day when this woman after she had a baby, and the doctors sewed up a big ole piece of gauze inside of her, and she got really sick from it, almost died.  Anyway, getting off topic....  Any way I look at it, not having to inhale cigarette smoke is a good thing.  Not that inhaling other pollutants is any better.  Cigarette smoking is something that can be stopped, and even if my dad was right, and it's not so bad for us, I think we as non-smokers have the right to NOT inhale something that is so gross!

      I think one of my biggest pet peeves (other than people horking and spitting on the sidewalk....grrrr) is ignorant people.  Sure we are all guilty of it from time to time, the ignorance of just simply not knowing.  But the people who just make inaccurate assumptions about people because they refuse to educate themselves, really drive me up the wall.  I will admit that before I met Jay 3 weeks ago, I wasn't overly educated on paralysis, or accessibility issues.  But it just frustrates me, as it does him, the lack of understanding in the people who design 'wheelchair friendly' malls, parking stalls, bathroom stalls, etc.  They figure as long as they designate the closest 2 stalls as handicapped that the MUST be okay for anyone who might need them.  Same with bathroom stalls, I think they just throw them in there to meet standards, but really don't look at functionality.  And really, what about that big ass ramp in the middle of the Circle Centre Mall??  Helloo??  Anyone thinking out there???    Today we went to church.  At the church I attend, there is no specified handicapped parking stalls.  So we found a place that we felt about 90% sure that no one could park next to him.  But we came out of church and there was someone next to him :P  Same thing happened after lunch at Poverino's. We parked somewhere that there was no more parking stalls next to his van, and when we came back there was someone parked right next to him.  What is wrong with people??  I think their brains go down the toilet the moment they drive into parking lots. :P  Okay, so there's my rant for the day!  Grrrrrrrrrr.....  On a happier note, I met little Kianna (Candace and Lyndon's month old daughter) last night, and I have fallen in love with her.  I even got to hold her during church today :D:D:D:D:D  hehe

      I am 23 years old, and only had my second 'date' last night.  Well that's not completely accurate, as I have had 2 previous boyfriends, but with them it was just like,   "I like you, do you like me?"   "Yeah I like you, will you be my girlfriend?"   and so it went.  But for the first time in my life, I have met a guy, who I am going out on dates with, for the purpose of getting to know him better, and also for the fun of it.  There is no pressure for anything more than friendship at this point, and it is great.  I am not opposed to pursuing more in due time, but I am trying my very hardest to seek God's will in this situation.  I want this to happen in God's timing, if it is meant to happen at all.  I know that God brought him into my life for a purpose, and I am just trying to figure out what that is.

      I am at a place in my life where I feel that I am ready to date again, it's been a while.  It's amazing how much peace God has given me over the last 2 or so years just to be seeking him, and pursuing my studies, without the distraction of a boyfriend.  But I thought I would post this little poem that was given to me when I was a camper at Camp Kadesh when I was 17 years old.  At that point in time, I wondered what God wanted with my love life, I thought it was up to me.  But I have come a long ways since then, and I hope that to those of you who are single this will give you hope, and for those who are married, it will ring true.....  Believe and Be Satisfied  Everyone longs to give themself completely to someone, to have a deep soul relationship with another - to be loved thouroughly and exclusively.  But God, to a Christian says:  "No, not until you are satisfied, fulfilled, content with being loved by me alone, with giving yourself totally, and unreservedly to me, discovering that only in me is your satisfaction to be found, will you be capable of the perfect human relationship that I have planned for you.  "You will never be united with another until you are united with me - exclusive of anyone else, exclusive of any other desires or longings.  I want you to stop planning, stop wishing and allow me to give you the most thrilling plan existing, one that you cannot imagine.  I want you to have the best.  Please allow me to bring it to you.  "Just keep watching me, expecting the greatest things:  keep experiencing the satisfaction that I AM.  Keep listening to me and learning the things I tell you.  You must wait.  Don't be anxious, don't worry.  Don't look around at the things others have gotten or I have given to them.  You just keep looking off and away up to me or you will miss what I want to show you.  "And then, when you are ready, I'll surprise you with a love far more wonderful than any of you could ever dream of.  You see, until you are ready and the one I have for you is ready - I am working even at this moment to have both of you ready at the same time - until you are both satisfied exclusively with me and the life I have for you, you won't be able to experience the love that exemplifies your relationship with me - perfect love.      "And dear one, I want you to have this love.  I want you to see in the flesh a picture of your relationship with me and enjoy concretely the everlasting union of beauty, perfection and love.  Know that I love you utterly.  I am God Almighty, believe and be satisfied."

      I am in school to be a massage therapist, and I am finding myself being bombarded with all this 'controversial information'.  I love what I am learning about massage and it's benefits and practical uses.  But there are all these "controversial issues" that are brought up in my class, and SO many people around me buy into it, and I just don't know who to believe.    I try to take it and look at it, and think about it.  Most of it, I come to the conclusion that I don't think I am going to radically change my diet to only organic foods, organic supplements, organic blah blah blah.  I know the people at school are only reading the side of the story they want to hear.  Sure all the literature they read says, for example, that fluoride is a carcinogen, and is unnecessary to maintain healthy teeth.  But is it true, or do they just not read the other side of the research?  Then you ask someone like my dad, who is VERY opinionated about everything, and he just figures those people have an agenda, and they are out to lunch.  (and I tend to agree, that anyone who renames themself Dolphyn IS probably out to lunch :P)    I know I am old enough to decide for myself, but it is just strange to me.  I am someone who for the most part needs some solid proof (ie research) before I will believe in it.  There have been a lot of things that have been brought up in school, things that I have never even given a second thought to before (like NOT receiving immunizations, all natural home child birth, not using fluoride, etc), but I have learned not to take everything they tell me at school as absolute fact.  I suppose, if anything, it has taught me to think for myself.

      *sigh* I just got home from my first date in over 2 years!  It feels great to be back into the swing of things ;)    We decided to meet at Tony Tomas for coffee at 830pm.  Of course I always misjudge travel time, so I got there a half hour early.  So I sat in the car for a while, and went to the washroom, and walked around walmart for a bit, before I decided at 8:20pm that I could go.  So I went and sat on the bench in front of Tony Tomas.  And so I sat, waiting for Jason.  He rolled up right on time, or a little early.  But we said hi and went and sat, and had a great chat and a little food and drink for a couple of hours.  It was so nice just to meet someone new, not to mention that he is super cool, and I am super pumped about getting to know him better.  I feel like an 8 year old on Christmas eve, excited for the things to come.  :D

      Today, as I stood waiting for the bus to come home, with my headphones in (I listen to my discman on the bus so no one will talk to me, or that's the hope anyways), listening to my new Evanescence cd, I saw about eight young guys, probably about 13-15ish in age walking towards the bus stop.    Now a few years ago, maybe even a few months ago, this would have intimidated me.  Something about young males, and they are always stupid and immature (okay that was a generalization, but most of them are at that age).  As they walked by, a couple of them were making fun of an older man who was sitting at the bus stop because he was wearing a hat that looked like a train conductors hat.    Then they came up to me, and one young man asked me if I would pay him $1 if he allowed the approaching bus to run over his foot.  I could hear him perfectly fine, because I never listen to the music too loud.  But he was being a smartass, and I felt like being one right back, and I felt bad about the old man they had been picking on.  So I was standing there saying louder than I had to (like a person does when they have headphones on), I am sorry, I can't hear you, I have headphones on.  And he was motioning for me to take them off, and I said no, I can't hear you.  And he started yelling at me to take them out, and I finally said, why don't you just piss off?  And then my bus pulled up and I got on, and as we drove away he was screaming at me about being a loser.    Now for those who know me, I don't usually stand up for myself, I just usually kinda just stand there quietly and give people dirty looks if they deserve them.  But I felt so good after that, and he just couldn't believe that I had told him to piss off.  I don't usually say stuff like that (I hate the word piss), but he deserved it, it was for me and the old man in the train conductors hat!

      Today I woke up and my hair wanted to be curly, so I worked with it, and moussed it and hairsprayed it and blow dried it with a diffuser, and it was curly, or wavy, or maybe just crusty looking.  I got a few complements from my friends at school, because usually my hair is back in a half ponytail.    Then I went to work, and I noticed all the guys smiling a little bigger at me than normal as they drove away.  And I thought it was maybe just a figment of my imagination.  Until this monthly parker actually stopped and made me open the window and remove my earphones (I like to listen to my discman at work), and he told me how very nice I looked today.  And I don't think he was hitting on me (I hope not :P) , but I just had a smile on my face the whole rest of the shift.  Moral of the story:  I think I should do my hair more often....if only I didn't sleep through my alarm just about every morning, hmmm.....

      It's amazing how much a good night of working in the clinic can make me happier.  Like I have had super crappy clinic nights when I come home and feel like garbage.  But today was a good clinic night and I am feeling good.  I think that Q4 (my last term of school, that I am now in), is going to be a good one.    Today in our Professional Development class, as we were discussing how to set goals, I was thinking about my life.  We have to make goals for ourselves (more so business related goals, but also personal ones) for the next 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years.  I figured in 6 months I will be married, and the 3 month goal is to find the right guy ;)  haha, my classmates laughed at me.

      I haven't felt close to God in quite sometime.  I haven't been making the effort that I should in the last few months, and that had started to take a toll on me.  I know that this is probably bad, but there is something I want in my life, and in this time of my wanting, I draw near to God.  He is there for me, happy to see me return, and not that I am going to leave the second I get what I want, but it seems in the past, I have done this same thing.  This new pursuit is something I want God to be a major part of.  I am feeling a lot of peace in the situation, but yet still some anxiousness.  I want it now, but I know that when God is ready to give it to me He will.  Or maybe it's not meant to be at all, maybe God will say no.  But on Sunday night, I was feeling a little confused and just generally feeling "off".  So I sat down and started writing how I was feeling, and praying.  And in the middle of what I was thinking and praying, God spoke to me.  Just all of a sudden, in the middle of me writing something, God gave me a bible verse.  I didn't ask for it, but there it was.  It was Phillipians 4:6-7 "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to God.  And the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus."  It was just what I needed to hear.  And honestly since then I have been seeking God in this situation.  I know that was only a couple of days ago, but I feel that my whole feeling on it has changed.  Before I was all giddy and distracted, and now I feel almost more mature about it.  I feel that it is in God's hands, His control and that no matter what happens, God's will is what I want.

      I had a wonderful weekend.  The first Angie and Jay day was a big hit.  It was really cool to spend an Saturday afternoon and evening with Jay, just get to know him better.    This weekend I came to a realization.  It is something that I have known for a while now, but I today I finally admitted.  I am in love with Jay.  I know that love will change and grow and mature, but it has to start somewhere, and this is it.  It felt so right today, when I told him and he told me.  It feels soooooooooo good, mmmm :)

      Do you believe that sinning is a choice that man makes?  I realize that when we are tempted, that most times it is our choice to give in and sin.  But because we have a sinful nature, that is born into us, does that mean that we have no option but to sin?    We had a visit today from a lesbian woman at school today.  She works for Gay and Lesbian Health Services, and came to talk to us, to try and dispel some myths, and help us to understand that 'queers' (that is what she likes to call them) are very much people who deserve respect too.    I realize that, but I do know that they are choosing to live a life of sin.  However, we all live sinful lives.  I don't think a day passes where we don't all sin.  And to God sin is sin is sin, doesn't matter how 'bad' society sees it as.  Also when she was talking to us today, the question of choice vs heredity came up.  She said, 'In all honesty, can you imagine CHOOSING a life so filled with persecution and hatred?"  And I am not condoning her lifestyle, but I tend to agree with that.  Why would someone choose that for themselves?  And at the same time, God has said that it is an abomination, so would he create someone who was genetically programmed to be that way?  I realize these are tough questions that no one really has any answers to.  However, I would like to hear what you have to say about it.

      I am not sure why, but I have NOT been enjoying clinic nights for the last ooooh, month or so.  I think the last note worthy one was the very first of the term, in the middle of January.  Anyway, tonite was a great clinic night, and I feel all good inside.  Makes me feel better about my choice of schooling and profession.  Not that I doubt whether I should be here because I know I am in the right place....I just began to wonder if my body was starting to prematurely wear out.  However, I feel great tonite!  I just wanted to share a quick story.  My first client, this cute little old lady, was about 20 minutes late for her appointment because she missed her bus.  Then I took her into the treatment space, did the interview assessment and whatnot.  By that time there was only about 20 minutes left in the treatment time.  So I treated her problem areas as best I could with the time I had, and she was very thankful at the end.  As I was walking her back to the reception area, she was walking ahead of me, and leaned over to one of my classmates and whispered loud enough for me to hear "Don't tell her I told you, but she is really good!"  hehe, just made me feel really good :)  Made my night for me!

      If you  knew  something in your heart so strongly, but yet your mind was questioning it, which should you listen to?  I know, I know, pray about it, well I have been, and as far as I can tell God is saying yes, proceed, but I have a pretty logical mind, and it is making me question what I think God is telling me.  Hmmm....guess I'll pray for God to stop my mind from doubting.

      I know that everyone's notions of romance are different.  Some people like it dripping with cheese, while others like it more thoughtful and personalized.    At lunch, I was out at Badass Jacks with Tony and Lyn, and telling them about next Saturday (aka Angie and Jay day).  I am excited that I get to spend some time on a Saturday afternoon just hanging out with my sweetie, and then we are going to cook supper together.  Lyn just kinda giggled and said "hehe, I remember when stuff like that was romantic, now it's more like 'are you gonna cook supper?', 'no, you cook supper'"    Now I realize that marriage isn't as romance-filled as dating, it's more realistic.  But how can a person keep romance an integral part of that relationship.  I realize I am not married, but it was just a thot I had.  That is my goal.  When I get married someday, I am going to be all romantic and everyone around me is going to want to vomit because of all the romance that exudes from me and my husband.  Ha!  :P

      Not like the Celine Dion song....yeah, if you even know that song....  As I waited for the bus this morning, listening to Third Day's worship album, I was awed by the beautiful sunrise.  It was all pink and purple and blue.  I have always had an amazement with the sky, with stars, sunrises, sunsets, northern lights etc.  They just speak to me of God's amazing presence in this world.  Most people would just look at the sunrise, and might appreciate it's beauty, but I am awed by the fact that God blessed me with something so beautiful.  As I was sitting on the bus, listening to amazing words of praise and continuing to enjoy the sunrise, I was overwhelmed with emotion (yes, I got a little misty eyed riding the #2 bus down 20th St., imagine that, Angie, getting emotional!!!!).    I was reading the Bible last night, more specifically the story of the last supper and Jesus' arrest.   I don't even know how to put in words how I was feeling this morning on the bus.  I was feeling unworthy, but at the same time blessed to have been given a chance at eternal life through Jesus' death and resurrection.  What an amazing gift!!  I am looking forward to seeing the movie The Passion that is coming out in theatres February 25th (exactly a week from today).  I believe it has a very powerful message to share with this sinful world, and I hope and pray that it does justice to the Biblical accounts.

      Nothing really profound to write about today.  Just gonna talk about my day.  I got up showered, dressed, ate and ran out the door to catch the bus.  Got to school and everyone was cramming for the massage midterm that we had this morning, but not me.  For some reason, I figured I already knew it all, so I barely cracked my books this weekend (what a great weekend it was :) ) and wasn't going to be dragged into some last minute cramming.  So I just sat and day-dreamed until the teacher came and we had to write the exam.  So I wrote it, and I was pretty much right, there wasn't too much on there that I didn't know.  I was able to recall pretty well from the week before when I had studied for the practical portion of this midterm (which I got 88% on by the way :D).  So I am always the first or second person to be done writing exams, I am not one to dilly daddle around, I either know it or I don't.  And if I don't know it, I either make an educated guess, or just a complete shot in the dark.  And every once in a while I will just throw something out there to make the instructor laugh.  Like one time, in my 2nd term, there was this diagram of the brain on the exam, and for the life of me I couldn't rememeber what that part was called, so I labelled it as a type of cell that is found in the testicles (my friend said that it was a cancerous tumor cause she couldn't remember either).  And my instructor at the time, she was a little 'out there' if you know what I mean, and she gave us a lecture about how she was quite frightened because she NEVER taught us anything about brain tumors.  Yeah, guess those jokes were lost on her :P   Then this afternoon in class we talked about spinal cord injury.  Now, I feel that I am a bit of an expert on the subject now (hehe), and found what the instructor was saying was kind of boring and too generalized.  So I threw a few comments out there that most people found interesting.  And this one girl asked a question that our instructor could not answer to her satisfaction, so I explained it differently, using a story that Jay had told me, and she totally got it :)  My instructor was like, wow, never thought of it like that before!  It was cool to feel smart for once ;)  Then I came home, and started working on my nutrition assignment, which I have been putting off for a few weeks now.  I got a good page typed, and only 3 more to go.  But I should get lots of work done this week, not because I will be thinking of Jay any less, but our 2hr phone calls will have to be curbed while his mom is in town ;)  It's all good though!   Then I had supper, did a little more homework, then realized that I had forgotten to do an assignment that is due tomorrow.  I was supposed to call a health care practitioner to ask them a few questions, and being that it is due tomorrow morning, and I didn't think of this until about 7pm, I had to do some quick BS-ing...hehe  Then I had my 2hr dose of Jay...mmmm *sigh* good stuff, and here I sit, still grinning from ear to ear, and thinking about going to bed.  Thank you for reading about my day, maybe it was boring, but I just didn't have anything profound to throw out there today.  Maybe tomorrow will be more inspirational ;)

      Have you ever felt with clear and amazing certainty that you are in the middle of God's will for your life?  I have often wondered if I was, and prayed for wisdom in seeking God's will.  But I can honestly say that right now I feel like I am exactly where God wants me to be, and it is overwhelming (in a good way)!!   I look at my life over the last 2 or so years, and I can see all the things that have happened, all coming together now and it all makes perfect sense.  I have had a lot of change in my life over the last 2 or 3 years (ie. quitting university, and re-seeking my direction in life).  I chose massage school, with God's leading, and I am beginning to see why I was lead in that direction.  What an amazing God we have!!!  He brings all the little details together, to make a big puzzle.  Yay for analogies...life is like a puzzle.  All the little pieces may not make sense on their own, but God is great at puzzles and he makes the most beautiful pictures out of them.    Wow, what an amazing revelation this has been :)

      With Valentine's Day again drawing near, love is on the minds of many people, myself included.  I wonder about love.  I have been told over and over again, and I do believe this....that love is a choice, not a feeling.  It is a choice to forgive someone and to be there for them.  A choice to look past 'imperfections' and a promise to work through any problems that come along.  Basically it comes down to 1 Cor 13:4-8....  Love is  patient , love is  kind . It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps  no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but  rejoices with the truth . It  always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.  Love never fails.   How can that, God's description of what love is, be the fluffy emotion that media portrays it to be???  It is definitely a choice to be made, and not to be made lightly.  That brings to mind another question....if love is a choice, does that mean that you could make it work with anyone?  If you are committed enough and willing to work hard enough to make it work, does it matter who you love/marry (barring other circumstances ie. if the man is abusive, it's probably not going to work :P)???  And as I think of that, I come to the conclusion that yes it does matter, because as a Christian, God has a plan for us.  And God does want us to be happy, and he wants to give us the desires of our hearts, but it has to be in line with His will.    Wow, this is just turning into a whole bunch of rambling.  Anyway, what do  you  think??

      I just had the greatest night.  I realize I say that every time I see Jay, and sometimes just when I talk to him, but wow, what a sweetheart he is.  God has blessed me so richly by giving me this man, that I am feeling overwhelmed with all of it.    He came over and had supper with my family, and it was so nice.  So natural.  He laughed at my dad's jokes, and petted Winston, and got to see my house.  It just felt like the whole scene just fit.  It's kind of hard to explain, but it's super cool.  He likes my family, and I look forward to meeting his family sometime in the not-too-distant future. :D

      I read Robyn's latest blog entry and it brought to mind something that I thought of a while back when I was working at the parkade full time (summer 2002).  It was a question I wrote about in a journal I was keeping at the time:  Would you rather be wanted or needed?

      I finally got to some studying today, and it is time for study break #1.  My mind is starting to wander from the wonders of ankylosing spondylitis anyway, so why not take a 'blog break'.  I am listening to Third Day's live worship album entitled Offerings as I study.  I was listening to song 8, and I have heard it before, and I have liked it since I heard it the first time, but it stood out in my mind particularily today, so i thought I would post the lyrics so you can have a read through and maybe it will touch your heart as well.  Thief  I am a thief, I am a murderer Walking up this lonely hill What have I done?  No, I don't remember No one knows just how I feel And I know my time is coming soon.  It's been so long, oh, such a long time Since I've lived with peace and rest Now I am here, my destination I guess things work for the best And I know that my time is coming soon  Who is this man?  This man beside me They call the King of the Jews They don't believe that he's the Messiah But somehow I know it's true.  They laugh at Him in mockery And they beat Him until He bleeds And they nail Him to the rugged cross They raise Him, they raise Him up next to me.  My time has come and I'm slowly fading I deserve what I receive Jesus, when You are in Your kingdom Could you please, please remember me?  And He looks at me still holding on The tears fall from His eyes And he says "I tell the truth Today you will be with me in Paradise" And I know that my time, yes, my time is coming soon And I know that my time, yes, my time is coming soon And I know Paradise, Paradise is coming soon.  WOW!  :)

      Today as I sat in church during the baby dedication, I couldn't help but realize what a miracle life is.  I am sure everyone realizes this, but it is something when you REALLY take that to heart.  We are only here because God put us here and yet most people don't take the time to notice the perfect plan that God has put in motion all around us.  We are so small and undeserving, but yet God knows our hearts and cares for us deeply.  I am reminded of Psalm 139:13-16 as I sit here writing:  13 For you created my inmost being;  you knit me together in my mother's womb.  14 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;  your works are wonderful,  I know that full well.  15 My frame was not hidden from you  when I was made in the secret place.  When I was woven together in the depths of the earth,  16 your eyes saw my unformed body.  All the days ordained for me  were written in your book  before one of them came to be.  As I have studied the complexities of the human body for the last year and a half, I am appalled at how people can believe in evolution.  I have had it jammed down my throat at school, but yet after hearing what they have to say, I am still enthralled with creation.  I have a hard time believing that everything came into existence from one cell that magically appeared in some primordial ooze.  How can that be more believable than a loving caring Father who created us in His image??

      As I near the end of my 2 year massage program at school, I am growing very short on motivation.  I like what I am learning, I like massaging people, making them feel better, but I am getting sick of being in school.  This is rather disappointing being as I am SOOOOO close to being there, but yet it seems so far away.  Everyone in my class is feeling the same way, even the overachievers in the class.  They just don't want to study and don't want to go to school.    I am starting to feel the stress of my board exams (in June or July) and I should be spending some time preparing for those as well.  But I don't...sigh.    I just have this vision of my life after I am done school.  Just working, living, going out, spending time with friends without feeling guilty that I am not at home doing homework.  I know that I had a silly job and whatnot, but that year that I took off from school just to work and make money and do whatever I wanted was pretty great.  I am glad I found a passion to pursue, but I am just running out of 'school steam'.    Any suggestions on how to regain my 'get go'??  haha, I am sure my class as well as myself would appreciate advice on how to finish out the school year on the right track ;)

      At school today, we got out of class a little bit late at lunch, so I rushed with my lunch downstairs into the dungeon.  We go down there because it is usually less busy than the lunch room upstairs, even though there is only one microwave in the dungeon (compared to 3 upstairs).  Well because I got out late, there were already 3 people in front of me in line to use the microwave, so I just put my food down in line and went an sat until I saw the person before me put their food in.  I walked over to casually check the amount of time I had to wait until I could at last heat up my leftovers.  Well she had put her food in for FIVE minutes.  Now, her food wasn't frozen, and it wasn't one of those premade lunches (aka Michalina's), just some rice and chicken with sauce or something that looked like that.  So I went and sat down and commented (probably a little too loudly) "Who's food needs to be heated for 5 minutes?!?"    I was hungry, and we ONLY get 40 minutes for lunch, and by this time there was only 30 of those minutes left.  So I went and sat 'patiently' until I saw her get up to go check on it, and I was excited because I had a leftover hamburger that I was REALLY looking forward to eating, and not to be redundant, I was hungry.    Well I think she had heard my previous comment about the FIVE minutes, and saw the excited/drooling expression on my face as I jumped up, and she proceeded to put it back on for THREE more minutes!!  Is there not microwave etiquette??  And there were 3 more people in line after me still anxiously waiting to eat their delicious reheated leftovers.  So I freaked out a little....I walked back to my table and said to my friends, loud enough for everyone to hear, "WHO NEEDS TO HEAT THEIR FREAKIN' FOOD FOR EIGHT MINUTES!!??"    So Trina and I sat there (her food was in line after mine), and we griped for the next 3 minutes.  We came to the conclusion that she probably liked to burn her food before she ate it.  Like really, who needs 8 minutes to heat food, on high in a microwave??  My hamburger was SO hot after ONE and a HALF minutes that I couldnt even touch it to put it on the bun....had to borrow Larissa's fork!  *sigh*  Some people really need to learn microwave etiquette!!!  :þ

      I don't want this blog to turn into a big mush fest about Jay.  Even though as you can probably tell, I like to talk about him, and pretty much he is what is new in my life.  He is bringing me a lot of joy right now, so I write about him.  But today I will write about something different.    I have always struggled with self esteem and self confidence issues.  I attribute it mainly to elementary school where I was picked on a LOT.  I never stood up for myself, just sat back and 'ignored' it, but every horrible name and animal noise as I walked by stuck with me.  It penetrated my heart and soul and I started to believe those people.  Even though they didn't straight out say that I was a loser or worthless, that is how the teasing made me feel.  I never retaliated, or even cried about it (not that I can remember anyway), I just kind of retreated into myself.  I became shy, painfully shy.  I was always open with my friends, liked to joke around and have fun, but around school, and strangers I was silent.  I remember a time when I was 'unable' (or maybe just chose to be unable) to order my own food in a restaurant, because heaven forbid I should have to talk to someone.  This did start to change as I grew up.  By the time the latter years of high school rolled around I was not quite so painfully shy.  But I didn't REALLY feel a difference in myself until I started massage school.  There is no choice but to talk to people, and get undressed in front of people in my class.  It was a little unnerving at first, but it is completely professional.  I have become a lot more comfortable with my outward appearance and body since I started school.  As I learn more about the human body, it enthralls me.  Anyway, I do have a point to all this rambling.    Even though my self esteem and self confidence have had a boost in the last few years, I still have these stupid insecurities.  I have fears that the good things in my life will be taken away from me.  We have been told just about since day one of school, that as massage therapists, if we do not look after ourselves and keep our bodies in relatively good shape that our career will not last very long.  Apparently the average career span of a massage therapist is about five years.  That scares me a little bit, I am not in the best shape, but I have been able to handle what I have been doing so far.  But the most I have had to do is 3 massages in a row.  When I am out in the real world, I will be doing approximately 6 hours of massage per day.  I just try to keep positive and do what I can to look after myself.    I said at the beginning of this post that I wasn't going to talk about Jay ;)  But here I go...haha.  I am loving what him and I have.  I know it has only been a month since our first conversation, but I have grown VERY fond of him.  I have these fears that something will come up that will not allow us to be together, or that he will meet someone better than me.  See, here comes the crappy self esteem :P  He tells me all the time how great I am, and I know that when people tell you otherwise for so long in your life that it's harder to believe the good stuff.  The bad stuff is always easier to believe, why, I am not sure.  In my heart, I know that he genuinely cares for me....then my mind thinks, do you deserve someone as great as him??  Ooh, here comes the tears :P    I am trying to give this up to God.  I have been praying daily since I started school, and since I met Jay that everything would work out.  I felt God's leading for me to go to massage school, and I am sure that if that is where I am supposed to be, that everything will work out.  Same with Jay, I felt God's leading in our friendship, to be more than just friends.  And I know deep down inside that these insecurities of mine are not truths, they are just my low self esteem doubting my worthiness of things that are good.  "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans to prosper you, and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future."  Jeremiah 29:11

      I just had the most amazing talk with my boyfriend.  I have never felt this open and honest in a relationship before.  We are trying our very best to get started on the right foot here, not to rush anything and it is amazing.  I am so thankful for Jay and the man he is!  :)  Just a question for anyone who may be reading this...I already ran it past Lyn and she gave me a good answer.  Just looking for more opinions on it....  Is kissing, in a dating relationship, glorifying to God?  Just a question that came up when Jay and I were talking, and something that I wondered about.

      I went to the hospital this evening to visit my sister, brother-in-law and ultimately the reason I went was to meet my long anticipated nephew, James Thomas Vanin.  I have not had much experience with people close to me being pregnant or giving birth.  Not that I ever had the illusion it was, but it is definitely not glamorous.  My sister gave birth to a 9lb11oz baby, with shoulders like a football player.  Needless to say she is pretty sore and will take some time to heal up and feel better.    Little James on the other hand, because he was blessed with such wonderfully wide shoulders, he got stuck on the journey into this world.  So the doctor had to use forceps to pull him out.  My sister said that he was pulling so hard that she just about came right off the bed :(  Poor little James' head is all black and blue.  He is beautiful nonetheless, even though his head is cone shaped and he has 2 black eyes and a black ear, and various other bruises.  He is beautiful!    It is just overwhelming to be this close to someone who has just given birth.  It is just not as glamorous as they portray it to be on the Baby Story, or any television programs for that matter.  I am feeling incredibly overwhelmed right now.  I am an Auntie, but at the same time, being in that hospital room, looking at my sister and her husband, it's hard to believe that they are parents.  It is a surreal feeling and will take some getting used to.  I am incredibly excited to get to know this little person that came into the world on this beautiful March day.  What a miracle :)

      Jay and I were getting 'concerned', well not really, but sort of about not having any disagreements or issues that have come up with us.  We actually sat around a couple of times thinking of things that we do that might annoy the other person, to no avail.  Date #4 in the book we are working through was about conflict resolution, or dealing with issues that come up, and we felt kinda ripped off cause there was nothing for us to talk about.  And it seemed so silly to worry about NOT having conflict.  Well tonite, something finally came up.  Not that we fought or argued, but a bit of an issue came up, and we worked through it.  We talked about it and both came away from it feeling like better people and feeling like we love eachother even more.  What a great feeling this is!  If we never have a disagreement I think that would be okay, but after working through something, I feel much better :)

      It has been a good week, although it has gone by WAY too quickly and I feel like I have been ripped off a little.  I was able to get together with some friends and spend some quality time with family.  My sister's tummy dropped the other day, so we are hoping the baby comes VERY soon (her due date is Monday!) :)  I also got to spend some time with Karen and Lynette on Tuesday which was great.  And I got some good quality time in with Jay which was delightful!  This is my last break before the home stretch (I'll be done school in June) and I hope that it will tide me over until then!  I guess I don't have a choice in the matter ;)

      It amazes me how much my life has come to revolve around this computer.  I will admit that I spend a LOT of time on this computer.  I spend the time that the average person would spend watching television on the computer chatting, playing games or a variety of other computer related things.  I confess that when I go away on a holiday to somewhere that doesn't have computer access that I feel a little uneasy and wonder how much email will be piled up (mostly junk mail anyways) when I get home.  When my time is filled, say if I am busy doing stuff all day, I can go for days without signing on and not think too much about it, but on a day like today, when I am home without much else to do, the fact that my computer is/was acting up (I still have my toes crossed as I am typing this ;) ) really makes me angry.    Generally I am a pretty laid back kinda girl, but when my computer is constantly giving me the dreaded blue screen, or just randomly choosing to shut down and restart without my permission to do that, I get angry.  I remember back to the days when I didn't have a computer to eat up my time and wonder how I spent all this time that I spend on my computer.  Maybe I actually talked to people on the phone or in person, rather than chatting or emailing.  Perhaps I actually sat down and played a game of cards with my dad, instead of playing with someone from California on yahoo games.  Just an interesting thought.  We are moving away from actual interaction with people.  Or maybe it's just me.....hehe.  I love my computer, but at the same time, I think it's just about time to trade it in on a newer model!  I so desperately want Windows XP *sigh*!  Someday when I am independently wealthy and can afford such things...

      I went to see the Passion yesterday.  Wow, what an experience that was!  After it was over, I didn't feel like talking about it, or even much like thinking about it.  I came home and everyone kept asking me if it was good or if I enjoyed it.  I didn't feel that 'good' or 'enjoyed' were words that I could use to describe it.  It was an experience.  I came away feeling sad, guilty, but at the same time loved deeply.  I have read that story many times in the Bible.  The arrest, trial and crucifixion of Christ, but that did not prepare me for the gruesome images in that movie.  I knew that they whipped and beat and mocked Jesus and put a crown of thorns on his head.  But seeing it made so much more of an impact on me.  I watched that, how Jesus took that, how he didn't complain, or lash out, he just took it.  Took it for me because he loved me so much.  He gave his life for me, and what have I done for him?  After seeing that I feel like I need to make a much bigger effort in my own spiritual life.  How can I sit back and be okay with a 5 minute prayer before I go to bed and reading a passage from the Bible, when He did that for me????  *sigh*

      So last night I met the parents for the first time.  Have you seen the movie, "meet the parents"??  Yeah, it didn't go anything like that!!  ;)  His parents are very nice people, who I think I will get along with just fine!  They encouraged us to come down to Swift Current in June for a visit.  Jay and I had talked about it, and now I think I am looking forward to that.  It will depend upon my job situation, or job hunting situation.  I think we would be able to make it work, sneak down there for a few days between Sunday and Thursday after we are both done school ;)  That'll be my holiday for the summer ;)  I am now officially on HOLIDAYS!  I still have work this week, but I am off of school for a whole week!  Yippeeeeeeeeee!!!  I have a lot of unconfirmed plans with people this week ('hey we should do something that week!'  'yes, yes we should'), but I hope to make them all happen.   I do have a haircut on tuesday afternoon, and Angie and Jay Day Part 2 on Wednesday (we get to have pizza, woohoo!), but I would like to confirm plans with other people.    There had been talk about Karen wanting to redeem a massage this week, and that would be awesome!  And Lyn wanted to come for a massage too!  And Robyn, if you want to redeem your birthday massage sometime this week, that'd be great!  Maybe I could even come pick you up.  And I finally get to go to Tante Maria's for lunch someday this week with dad and Robin.  It is a mennonite restaurant, and apparently they have very good zumma borscht!  Mmmmm zumma borscht.  I do also have an assignment to work on this week somewhere in there, but I would much rather have plans with people!  I hope the weather is nice, and I also hope that my sister has her baby!  Her due date is in a week from tomorrow!  So hopefully it'll come a little bit soon, so I can have some time with the baby before I am back at school :)  yay for babies!!!    Well I should go get dressed and whatnot to go see the Passion this afternoon.  I'll let y'all know how it was.  Even tho most people who are reading this have already seen it!!!

      This morning, dad asked me when he should start building a ramp in front of the house....and mom asked me if we were getting engaged.  Wow, never expected that from mom and dad, and they were so calm about it.  I know that they like Jason and they know that I am not naive and stupid, but I just thought they might have more reservations about their baby girl talkin about marriage.   I am sooooo in love.  This is such a great feeling, and it feels better knowing my parents aren't gonna freak out on us.  I get to meet his parents this weekend, and after tomorrow is done with, I think I may be a little bit nervous about it.  I go to Sherbrooke Special Care Home tomorrow for my first day of field placement.  I am working with 2 ladies, one has MS and the other is older and has serious arthritis and has had at least a couple of major joint replacements.  I was a little concerned about getting paired up with someone who has cognitive difficulties or cannot speak.  I realize that I would have been okay, but I feel good with the residents I was paired with, but I am a little nervous.  So if you read this before Thursday morning, could you say a little prayer for me, just for calmness, and ease with going there.  I don't want to be nervous, I have no reason to be nervous.  After tomorrow morning, and I have time to think about meeting Jay's parents, I may start to get a little nervous.  Just wait until Saturday at work, when I have 8hrs to sit there and think about it and get worked up.  I am sure I will be okay, but the potential exists to get nervous.  From what I have heard, they are great people, and remind me a lot of my parents to an extent.  So if you could pray for that too...  Today, I was putting a hair elastic in my hair, and then it was crooked, so I went to take it out and it was all tangled up, so I decided to cut it out of my hair.  So I got some scissors, and cut it.  And a ~2 inch long chunk of hair came with it.  Just fell right onto my shoulder.....So today I phoned and made a hair appointment to get it evened out.  I can't really tell where I cut it, but I am sure it'll make for some interesting times when I am trying to curl my hair :P  I haven't had my hair cut since the middle of last October!!!  Jay and I are skipping out of church on Sunday to go see The Passion.  I am looking forward to it, but at the same time am slightly apprehensive.  I know that it is going to make me cry, and I am not a fan of crying in public.  I realize that most people there will probably be crying as well, but still.  But I do want to see it.  I think that it will make an impact on the views of Easter this year, refresh the story in our minds and give us a realistic and shocking view of what our Saviour did for us!  Wow!  I do look forward to it :)  I think that's all, I am off to bed!  Hope y'all are doing well!

      Okay, so maybe we didn't get as much snow as they had originally forecasted, and it melted pretty much as quickly as it fell, but I am still ready for spring.  Spring, a season for new life, for growth and change.  The season of 'twitterpation', hehe.  It's been a long time since spring rolled around and I was 'twitterpated' ;)  It's nice to have someone to share this season of love and new beginnings with.    I am also reminded of the fact that very shortly (within the next 2-3 weeks, or maybe sooner) I am going to be an auntie.  What an amazing miracle children are.  I recall last August, when my sister first told me she was pregnant, I was the 2nd one she told (of course she told her husband first!).  Last August, March felt like FOREVER away!  I wanted her to have the baby now!    And another memory, when we were in Calgary in September and Robin wanted to shop for maternity clothes.  Well in most stores, they have a pillow you can try the clothes on with if you arent big enough to fit the clothes yet.  Robin liked that pillow so much she wanted to take it home.  Now that she is actually that big, she is ready for that kid to come out!!  Everyone (except Lorne) thinks that the baby is going to be a boy, and at first I really wanted a girl, but now I feel indifferent.  I will be happy with a baby to play with :)  I cannot wait to hold that precious child in my arms, and hug and kiss it, and play with it.  Teach it to do annoying things, then send it home to mom and dad who try to unteach it what I taught it ;)

      I am so mad/frustrated/disappointed I just wanna cry.  It is the middle of March and I really would like for it to stop snowing.  But oh no, overnight we are supposed to get upwards of 15cm of snow!!!  This is silly.  I realize we live in Saskatchewan and we can have winter weather up until May, but this year, for some reason, I am really eager for spring.  It has been a looooong winter, and I am ready for some good ole spring and summer!!!  On a happier note, I am beginning to feel my future coming together.  I am getting close to being done school, and the first while after I am done school is a little blurry, but I am starting to have a vision of where I would like to take my new found education and skills.  At some point in time I would like to have my own business out of my home and target people with limited mobility.  I think that this group has not been targeted with most of the clinics out there, and I think it is a great idea.  But that is not something I want to get into immediately out of school.  I would like to get out and build up a bit of a client base first, in case the other idea doesn't pan out, and the target clients aren't knockin down my door ;)  Maybe my plans will change, but having a plan at all makes me feel really good.

      Guess what I saw today when I was standing outside of my school waiting for mom to pick me up....  A guy rode by, on a  unicycle , wearing knee pads....it was one of those moments where you have to do a double take, but yes, sure enough, it was a unicycle!

      Just remembering back to January 5th (2 months ago) when I first spoke with Jay online.  I remember him wanting to show me a picture of himself very early in our conversation, and I was like....hmmm, is he one of 'those' guys :P  But I very soon understood why.  It was a picture of him next to his minivan, in his wheelchair.  Before he sent it, he warned me "this is probably going to be a little bit shocking for you."  And I thot, hmmm, wonder what that means....but when I saw it, I have to admit it was a little bit surprising because I have never met someone in a wheelchair online before.  But just to put him at ease, I replied "wow, you drive a minivan, that is shocking!"  hehe, he told me he just about cried with joy when I said that.  It is hard to believe that was only 2 months ago.  Time has been flying, I feel like I have known him for an eternity, but at the same time, we still have so much to learn about eachother.  It is amazing how quickly God can change situations in your life...at the end of December I was feeling pretty crappy about being single, thinking that maybe I was meant to be single, then boom, I meet this super great guy and am in the middle of a whirlwind of a romance.  WOW!  I am so happy at this point in my life, I am excited about the future but at the same time thoroughly enjoying the here and now.  *sigh* What a great feeling this is!

      God is amazing.  Every time a fear or concern comes up associated with Jay and our relationship, either through prayer, or through talking to Jay about it, it is gone.  After school, I had a talk with my dad about my future with Jay.  Not that we are planning a wedding yet :P, but my dad is concerned that I am not thinking this through.  He has nothing against Jay, in fact he really likes him, but he is just trying to look out for me.    My dad's fear is that Jay will end up in a nursing home before he is all that old and that I will be left on my own (possibly with children to support) and what will I do then?  Well, I think that living in fear of the worst case scenario is not healthy.  In all reality I could die tomorrow, or tonight even, or 5 years from now.  Who knows??  Only God.  And in my relationship with Jay, God is our guidance.  I have never felt so sure that I am in God's will for me and that gives me comfort when faced with those questions from my dad.  I think by educating my dad about the life expectancy of people with spinal cord injuries (SCI), it may help to put his mind at rest.  In all the literature I have read, I have come across information that there is only a slight decrease in life expectancy of those with SCI as compared to those without SCI.  Of course people with SCI are more prone to infections and degenerative diseases (such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis), however, Jay takes good care of himself.  I think that a LOT of life expectancy has to do with attitude.  Jay is a stubborn man, who is not willing to sit back and wilt and die because of this small obstacle.  That is what I love so much about him.

      Today the weirdest (but pleasant) thing happened.  A girl in Q3, her name is Hali, and she started with our class, but in Q1 her and her husband got pregnant with their 2nd child, so she took our Q2 off so that she could have the baby and be at home with her for a little while.  Then she came back with the class that started 6 months later.    So today, she came up to me and handed me a note and stood there, waiting for me to read it.  And I am always one to think the worst, wondering if I might have offended her (but really not sure how I would have done that....), but as I read the note, my eyes instantly filled with tears and I just felt so special.  It was a belated Happy Birthday note, just telling me that she appreciates me, and my sense of humour, my calm demeanor, etc.  It was absolutely unexpected and just touched my heart.  I don't even feel like I know her that well....our class had a baby shower for her, and of course we all see her around the hallways and the lunch room.  But it just really made me feel good :)    It reminded me of that movie Pay It Forward (I dont remember a whole lot of it, just kinda the premise of it).  It was this kid, who thought he could change the world by instead of paying people back, paying people forward.  So instead of returning a nice favor, passing a nice favor onto someone else.  Makes me feel like I should do something nice for someone else.

      It is currently +23C headed for a high of +26C!  Wow, I think maybe *crosses fingers* summer might be here.  Well definitely spring anyways.  I like this time of year, for the most part.  I don't like the dead trees and brown grass, and dust and dirt, but the longer days and nicer weather are sure a lot better for a person's morale than winter :P  As I sit here waiting for the 1st coat of nailpolish on my toes to dry (a colour called Typhoon, it's kinda blue, but it shines a purply colour), I am getting excited about what this summer is going to bring.  I just look forward to having a job, and NOT having to do homework.  Being able to spend my non-working time just relaxing with my friends and family, and not worrying about this exam, or that assignment.    I look forward to doing a lot of summery things this summer.  Jay and I were planning to do some touristy Saskatoon things, maybe hit up some museums, the zoo and whatever else our little hearts desire.  I hope to have some slurpees (I haven't had one in ages!), spend some good quality time in the patio swing soakin up some rays and I would like to get to the lake (and it doesnt really matter which one....) sometime this summer, all depending on the work situation.  I am a little bit scared about being dumped out on my butt in the real world, but the excitment of having a career and not just a summer job outweighs the scariness for me!    I was remembering this time last year when I was planning to move out of my parents house.  It would have been good for me I'm sure, however, I would now be in a position that a couple of people in my class are in.  Get a job by July 1st or end up moving back to mom and dad's house.  I think that this has all worked out for the best in the long run.  I still look forward to being able to move out and be independant, but I know that for now, saving money and trying to get myself a car is what I need to do.  I sure do suck at painting my toenails...I got just about as much polish on my toes as I do on my nails.  But it usually comes off with the first shower, so it should be alright.  I think today I might go and look at some new sandals.  I have had my Reebok sport sandals since high school (over 6 years ago!) and they are not in bad shape, except for the complete lack of tread left on the bottom, as well as the smell that they give my feet every time I wear them.  I spent $60 on them back in the day, so hopefully I can find something along that line, around that price that will last me a LONG time again!    I think it's time to go and do a 2nd coat on my toes!  Byebye for now!

      Hehe, okay so I just passed my Q4 comp oral/practical!  You just get a pass/fail, so I passed and they said I did well.  They said I was very concise and to the point (done in 13 minutes, out of a possible 30 minutes), so it's all good.  I just need to review some of my muscles, but I knew that before I went in ;)  Thanks for your thots and prayers!

      I have my comprehensive practical exam tomorrow.  I have been studying for it off and on for the last week or so, and am feeling fairly confident in my knowledge but I could use some prayers.  My exam is at 1:30-2:00pm tomorrow afternoon.  This exam is styled after our board exams that are coming up on June 3-5, so it should help us to have an idea of what we are walking into in June.  Thanks and I will keep you posted about how I do on it

      It is so unbelievably windy out there!  And with all the sand that hasn't been swept up by the street cleaners yet....a lot of it ended up in my sandals (because the radio said it was going to +22C today) and in my teeth!  I hate that feeling, *crunch crunch* of sand in your teeth :þ  My life seems so hectic right now, I haven't seen many of my friends in the last month, and probably won't much in the next month!  But I keep track of most of you through reading blogs, and the occasional meeting on MSN.  It feels like a long time until I am done school, but at the same time, it feels like no time at all.  I gave my notice at work yesterday, for May 20th (so I can have the long weekend off!  yayyayayaya!), and it was just about the best feeling of my life.  I think that leaving that parkade, as an employee for the very last time will feel even better :)  I just know the next month is going to come and go in no time, and I have so much studying to do, assignments to write, and at the same time try to keep up on my love life ;) and I would like at some point in time to see my friends!!    What else is new....uh, our clothes came in today at school (okay Jay, I ruined the surprise for you ;) ).  They look fairly good, but I am really glad I didn't order a tanktop.  The guy who put the logo on them for some reason decided that it would look good, instead of putting the logo we designed (it says massage therapy, with the m in a circle, cause an m in a circle is the shorthand way of writing massage), he just put a big ole M in a circle in the middle of the chest.  These are tight fitting ribbed tanktops....with a 3 or so inch wide M in the middle of the chest.  We came to the conclusion it looks a little like a superhero shirt....'Massage Woman' we decided.  She changes the world subtly through effleurage and petrissage....haha, okay we had a good laugh about that, but again, I am glad I did not order a tank top.  My shorts that I ordered have the same big ole M in a circle on them, but at least they are shorts, and people won't be like, "wow, you have a big M on your chest!".  Yeah, my other clothes look great, and I am sure you will all see me wearing them in the next months, cause I got 3 shirts, and shorts.  There is a lot of short tempers in my house right now.  With me in the middle of stress time at school, and mom and dad quitting smoking, there is a lot of snipping at eachother going on.  Dad get's REALLY frustrated really easily and swears a lot....but at this point in time, I would rather put up with that than walking into a hazy, stinky house!  They seem pretty set on quitting this time, so I hope it works out for them.  I am always skeptical because they have quit and restarted so many times!!!  Hopefully dad will be motivated to do more stuff around the house and yard because it takes the mind off of wanting a smoke.    I think that's all that's new with me, I haven't had many profound blog entries for the last while, but I will do my best to be inspired :þ

      At school, from day one we have taken classes in professional development.  We learn what it means to be professional as a therapist.  Things like how to deal with difficult clients, what is expected of therapists in the code of ethics and that sort of thing.  There are two massage schools in Saskatoon for those of you who don't know, McKay, where I go, and the Professional Institute of Massage Therapy(PIMT).  When I was looking into schools to go to, everyone I talked to unanimously told me that McKay was the place to go.  Sure their building doesn't look as pretty from the outside and maybe it's not as new, but I heard the instructors and the program itself was second to none!  So when it was time to choose between schools, I chose McKay, and have never looked back.  At our school we don't make a habit out of putting down the other school, if we hear something about them, we might talk about it, but we realize that anyone who is going there probably weighed the pros and cons of each school and chose that one.  I do have a point to my ramblings here...  Yesterday, two girls from PIMT booked into our clinic at school and came in and were treated.  They told their therapists that they were university of saskatchewan students who were interested in perhaps pursuing massage therapy in the future.  Basically they complained throughout the whole treatment, and at the end they gave the therapists scathing evaluations on the evaluation sheets.  Everything was 'unsatisfactory'.  I have been to one of those poor therapists and she is really good.  This is unacceptable behavior in my mind.  What in the world would possess them to do that?!?!  Obviously they had planned to do this, because they both had stories laid out about who they were.  But one of them slipped up and it came out that she was a student at PIMT, and we assume the other one was as well, because she had the same story about being a U of S student and used terminology on her evaluation sheet that the average person would not know.    I just wonder who put those ideas into their head?  Someone said they overheard them talking that it was an 'assignment' for one of their classes.  If that's true, wow.  It just really really ticks me off that they think they can do that.  I can honestly say I have thought about going over to their school for a treatment, just to check them out, but I would NEVER do anything so immature and unprofessional.  So this morning, our program director called over to PIMT and tore a strip off of the program director over there.  I hope that those students are disciplined severely.  That's my rant for the day ;)  Other than that, not a whole lot new with me....in the last week, 2 girls at school have gotten engaged!  Both have been dating their boyfriends for 4-5 years, so I guess it's about time ;)  I am so happy spring is here!!  Yay for spring!  I need to paint my toenails and start wearing sandals!!

      I am sitting here dreading starting to study for my massage final tomorrow.  It will be the last massage final I ever write.  I still have comprehensive exams in May and board exams in June, but tomorrow will be my very last written massage final!  Wow eh??  It feels like only yesterday that I started school with 22 other people who were just as shy and intimidated as me, and now we are all massage therapists.  My sister had her RMT come over to her house the other day to give her a treatment, and she said that I am just as good, if not better than her in some areas.  She still has some more strength than me, but I know that'll come with time and practice!  It's good to hear tho!  I am just about done school, soon to be a Registered Massage Therapist!  Wow!  I will have a title, Angie Boschman RMT ;)  Not that it really matters if I can't find a job, but we'll be positive and hope that I do find one ;)  I am counting down the days (39 as of today) until I quit at Impark.  I just can't wait to see the look on Dale's face when I give my two weeks notice, then when I am able to hand in my keys and nametag....*sigh*  Yesterday I was not having a very good day, feeling emotional, like one of those days when you are on the verge of tears and it just doesn't take much to push you over the edge, but there is really no good reason for you to feel like that.  Well I was feeling that way, and was driving to work (half way down 22nd st), and remembered that I had forgotten my massage text book at home, so I quickly turned around and came home, and cried on the way back home, and cried on the way back to work.  I was only about 5 minutes late, no biggie.  Then this woman came to the booth, and handed me her ticket and two of our 2hr validation coupons.  Well the rules of the 2hr validation coupons state that you can only use one per visit.  So she had been parked for 4 hours, and could only use one coupon, so she owed me $4.  She thought that I was full of it, and told me as much.  She said that they have always accepted more than one, and I said 'no, I have worked every Saturday and Thursday for the last 2 years (the only time we accept those coupons) and I have NEVER accepted more than one'  She said she still didn't believe me.  I said to her "I am not trying to rip you off, I just work here, these are the rules I have been given, and I follow them, or else I get in trouble."  She said, I still don't believe you.  I said to her "What in the world would be in it for me, if I actually was ripping you off??"  She said, I don't know, but I still don't believe you.  Finally she paid her $4 with a 'hmmph, I'll never be back', and I let her go.  I sat there and my hands were shaking, I was mad, but being on the verge of tears....Yeah, well, I sat there in the booth and had a good cry for, oooh, about 20 minutes.  Some customers came and went in that time, and they just pretended not to notice my puffy red eyes and red nose.  But after I got it out of my system, I felt a lot better!  For the rest of the day, I felt pretty normal.  Then I got to go home and then I went and spent the evening with Jay.  It was a good ending to a mediocre day :)

      Easter weekend has come and gone again.  This year seemed particularly important and I did a lot of reflecting on the death and resurrection of Jesus.  More specifically the suffering that he endured leading up to and including the cross.  After hearing that story over and over again in the last few years of my life, after seeing The Passion, I was awed to see how very much Jesus really endured.  Wow.  And in recieving communion during the Good Friday service, I don't know if it has ever affected me as deeply as it did this year.    On a different note, I got to see my little nephew again yesterday.  He is looking so good :)  Such a little sweetheart!  And Jay came for family dinner last night, so he got to meet a bit of my extended family.  It was really cool :)  As we grow closer and closer together, I am looking for patience.  Today as I was leaving Jay's house after lunch, I was saying in a whiney voice....'i want patience nooooow!'  I have been praying for patience, and I think this is one of those things that God is trying to teach me patience through.  I feel like saying to God "okay either give me what I want now or give me patience!"  I don't seem to be getting either ;)  *Sigh*  Oh well, no hurry right??  :)

      Just a quick note to let y'all know that I told my dad about my plans to quit Impark, and he was pretty okay with it.  Not like my overactive imagination was picturing.  I have had so much support and peace about this decision, that I know this is what is supposed to happen.  Around the middle of May I am going to give my 2 weeks notice, then I will be done on May 27th :)  I can finally see the light at the end of this very dark tunnel!!!!

      I made a decision today.  I am still in the process of praying about it, ensuring that it is the right thing to do, but the more I think about it, the happier I feel and the more it makes sense to me.  As most of you reading this probably know, I have been working for Imperial Parking for the last two and a half years.  In this time, my life has changed a lot.  I started during the year I took off of school to figure my life out, and now, as I draw near to the end of my 2 year massage program, I am feeling really ready to quit.  Today during our professional development class, it just came to me.  "Angie, take a leap of faith and quit your job at the end of May."  That would give me just about another 2 months of working there, but would bring me up to just about the end of my program.  It would give me time to focus on preparation for my board exam, time to relax and a week or so of free time after I am done, to RELAX, go to Swift Current with Jay, not worry about responsibilities and start looking for a massage related job.  I know that I may not find a massage job right off the bat, but like I said, I think it is a leap of faith to save my sanity and bring a little joy into my life.  This is my grad gift to myself :)  If worse came to worse and I was running out of money (I have a little saved up), I could go out and get a non-massage job somewhere until I find something massage related.  But I feel a strong sense of calm and peace about this decision.  The only thing that scares me is telling my dad about this.  I realize I am 23 years old, and it is my life, but I do have to live with him, and I don't want to hear "I told you so" if I can't find a job right away.  I am sure I will find SOMETHING....So if you would pray for me, and let me know if you think I am completely retarded, I would appreciate it. :)

      Okay, well maybe this isn't a poem, but I sure do like when I have a Saturday off.  I requested today off 3 months ago thinking that I had sport's taping (ie learning how to tape up sports injuries) today, but we found out yesterday (thank goodness) that it is not until tomorrow.  I am kinda disappointed that I have to miss church, but glad to have a Saturday off, and I am also thankful that we found out about the schedule change before this morning, or there would have been 15 unhappy campers sitting outside of our school this morning at 9am wondering why there is no one there to let us in!  It has been an emotional week.  With the birth of my nephew *sigh* and the DREADED memo at work on Thursday, I have gotten a lot of good crying time in.  I am feeling good as this week comes to a close, mainly because I do not have work today.    Little James' face is no longer black 'n blue (cept for a little on his eyes and cheek), but now he is jaundiced.  It is a pretty common occurence in newborns, but it is interesting looking.  I have never seen a yellow baby before ;)  And the little sweetheart, once my sister got him to feed and sleep last nite, as he laid there under the lights in the incubator, completely naked, he just sprawled his limbs out like he was REALLY enjoying being in there ;)  What an amazing little person he is :)    Oooh one more story about him.  When mom, dad and I got there last nite, the nurse was in the room, and they had him on his tummy in the incubator, and without a word of a lie, he was trying to crawl.  His little arms and legs were just a going, but he just didnt quite have the strength to support himself.  He was also managing to pick his head up a little bit!!  After only 3 days on this earth!  Wow!  I think for his first bday I'll get him some free weights ;)

      I realized today that I am blessed with a special brain.  I remember things.  Not that I don't need to study, because I do, but once something is ingrained in my brain, there it shall stay until the end of time.  In grade 8 we had to learn the poem 'In Flander's Fields', and we had to present it, with emotion in our voices, different inflections at different points.  I still remember every last word and tone of voice.    We got our comprehensive exams back today.  They covered a little bit of everything that we have learned in the last 2 years.  Between the 2 exams they were approximately 300 multiple choice (and a few matching) questions.  I got 90% on my academic one (including anatomy, physiology, pathology, nutrition and kinesiology) and 91% on the practical portion (including massage treatments, contraindications, assessments, remedial exercise and business/ethics).  I barely cracked a book for either of them, but I believe that they showed me that I remember a lot of stuff from the last 2 years.  This is a good thing since I have my board exams later this week (Thursday at 1-5pm and Saturday 8-10am).  But I looked around at other people who got much lower marks than me, and I am not bad mouthing them in any way, but I just don't feel that smart....like I said before, I think I was blessed with a very special brain.  On another note, my grad was yesterday.  It was fun to get dressed up, however the grad was really long and boring.  We actually left part way through...after the meal because my family and Jay were bored, I was bored and mom had the beginnings of the flu.  So we took off early and didn't miss anything but a REALLY boring guest speaker and special awards that I didn't win!  I am getting excited about being done!  And on Saturday I got flowers delivered to my house, from Jay's parents, that was super nice!!  We only have 5 more days that we have to go to school!!  And it looks like the trip to Swift Current is going to work out :)  Yipeee!

      So close, but yet so far away.  I will be officially done school in two weeks!!!  TWO WEEKS!  I look back to when I started and I cannot believe that it has been just about 2 years since I met my classmates.  What a great bunch we are ;)  Our instructors tell us all the time what a great group we are, how we all get along and like eachother (Aaron even told us we were his favorite class to teach since he started there 4 years ago!).  But maybe they just feel that way in comparison to the class that is 6 months behind us....they are aweful!  They are clique-y and full of attitude, but I will soon be gone!  Woohoo!  However, in two weeks, it won't really matter how cohesive our little group is.  We will be set free to go out and put our knowledge and skills to work as massage therapists.  The thought of going 'head to head' with my classmates for jobs in the city makes me feel kinda sad.  There is no doubt that they are all great therapists and I realize it'll all come down to the 'fit' of our personality within a particular workplace, but it's still seems strange to 'compete' with those people for work.  But I have God on my side and I know that He will guide my path as I look for a job.  I really have no desire to go job hunting right now :(  I just want to take a little bit of time off when I am done.  I have a feeling that by the time I get registered and get insurance that it might be around the end of June anyway, so that will give me a couple of weeks off :)  And that's assuming that I pass my board exam that I have been procrastinating for 2 or 3 months for already!  *sigh*  Back to studying blood vessels I go.  Wish me luck, or if you think of me tomorrow afternoon, say a little prayer for me!!

      What a great weekend it was!  Saturday was my first day fully off of work.  I am currently unemployed and it feels great!  I still have 3 weeks until I am finished school, but to be done Impark feels wonderful!  Saturday Jay and I went to see Shrek 2 (highly recommend it to anyone who liked the first movie!), went shoe shopping (got a nice pair for $8.50), looked in Charm Diamond Store (never shop there, they are very pushy and try to talk you into everything you DONT want :P), then went back to his place for supper.  It was a great first Saturday off!    I have also been tweaking my resume all weekend because I am going to go drop a copy off tomorrow for a job!  I hope that works out, well if it's a good job, and that I am still able to go to Swift Current with Jay after I am done school.  I know we can't always have the best of both worlds....but i waaaaanna go *pout* ;)    I am currently trying to study for my written practical comprehensive exam.  It will be about 100 multiple choice questions based on massage theory, hydrotherapy, remex and assessments.  I have lost my will to study.  Like before, I complained that I was having a hard time studying, but I honestly cannot physically bring myself to study for this exam.  I am sure I will do okay *crosses fingers*, but this is pretty important....if I fail I don't graduate, can't write the board exams...basically my life is over ;)  But I am pretty confident that I won't fail.  I passed my comprehensive oral/practical with flying colours, so I have confidence in this as well.      I will wrap up here with one of my favorite quotes from Shrek 2, "Look at his wee boots.  How many cats can wear boots?  Honestly!"  haha

      It has been quite a week.  I finished up my final shift at Impark, thank goodness!  Jay was baptized!  My parents met Jay's parents.  I have a lead on a massage job for when I am done school (please pray for me)!!  A dear friend of mine, lost her grandpa to cancer.  It just all makes me think a lot about life, and what really matters.    I have not experienced death of any close friends or relatives.  I cannot imagine what my friend's family is experiencing, but I do know that at least they can have hope and peace in knowing that he has gone to a better place.  A place where there are no more tears or pain.  Reminds me of a verse written by Paul in Philippians 1:21, "For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain."  John D. definitely lived his life for Christ, what passion that man had!   I was thinking of their family as I rode the bus this morning listening to my discman.  The song I Can Only Imagine by Mercy Me came on and I was welling up with tears and people were giving me funny looks, so I had to skip it ahead to the next song.  That is such an amazing song, and when I think of being in heaven, wow, I become awed at the very thought!  I don't deserve to go to heaven, but through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross we are able to.  And after seeing the Passion earlier this year, it just breaks my heart.  Jesus did THAT for me!  And he would do it again in an instant, he loves us that much.  And I whine about getting up 'early' to go to church on Sunday mornings ('but it's my only day to sleep in').  I think I need to get my priorities straight.  Because a person never knows when your time will come, when God will call us home.  I Can Only Imagine by MercyMe  I can only imagine what it will be like, when I walk by Your side... I can only imagine, what my eyes will see, when Your Face is before me! I can only imagine. I can only imagine.  Surrounded by Your Glory, what will my heart feel? Will I dance for you, Jesus? Or in awe of You, be still? Will I stand in Your presence, or to my knees will I fall? Will I sing 'Hallelujah!'? Will I be able to speak at all? I can only imagine! I can only imagine!   I can only imagine, when that day comes, when I find myself standing in the Son! I can only imagine, when all I will do, is forever, forever worship You! I can only imagine! I can only imagine!   Surrounded by Your Glory, what will my heart feel?   Will I dance for you, Jesus? Or in awe of You, be still? Will I stand in Your presence, or to my knees will I fall? Will I sing 'Hallelujah!'? Will I be able to speak at all? I can only imagine! Yeah! I can only imagine!   Surrounded by Your Glory, what will my heart feel?   Will I dance for you, Jesus? Or in awe of You, be still? Will I stand in Your presence, or to my knees will I fall? Will I sing 'Hallelujah!'? Will I be able to speak at all? I can only imagine! Yeah! I can only imagine!   I can only imagine! Yeah! I can only imagine!! Only imagine!!! I can only imagine.   I can only imagine, when all I do is forever, forever worship You! I can only imagine.

      So I had a fairly decent weekend :)  Friday night, my class from school had a bbq at Kristen's house.  It was a good time of just hangin out with some good food.    Then came the worst part of the weekend.  I had to train the new girl yesterday at work.  Remember a blog or two ago I said, either she'll be really smart and on the ball, or way off the ball and dumber than a sack of hammers.  Yeah, she was much closer to the sack of hammers side.  Now I realize that I was slow when I started too, but she wasn't even trying.  She would look at the times on the ticket and just take a random guess.  I tried to teach her a couple of different ways to calculate the times, but she just was not getting it.  She would just take a stab in the dark.  I would say, no, try counting it on your fingers, and she couldn't even do that.  And she had a really annoying voice, like a 'wittle baby'.  Patience Angie, six 'n a half more hours with her, then it is out of my hands and into Dale's :)  Then Jay picked me up and we went for supper with his parents to Mano's.  Today was Jay's baptism.  It went really well, and was a very emotional time :)  Jay's parents got to meet my parents and my sister today.  They all got along super well and chatted a lot.  His mom even invited them down so my dad could go fishing with Jay's dad, and his mom said that my mom n her would go sun bathing ;)  haha  I like his parents a lot, they are really down to earth, easy going people and I can picture myself seeing a lot more of them!  I am really looking forward to our trip down there in June to visit!

      So my printer stopped working a few weeks back, maybe even a month or so ago.  Every time I would try to print something it would give me an error message that said I needed to reinstall my colour print cartridge.  It has been empty for years now, and the printer always worked.  So after trying countless times to reinstall the empty one, I bit the bullet and spent a whopping $50 on a new one!  And guess what, it works like it always did now!  Stinkin' machinery!!

      I now only officially have TWO shifts left at Impark!  Yippeee!  I did however find out today at work that I will be training the new girl (which I knew), but I found out that she will be training with me for the WHOLE shift Saturday and next Thursday!  Now it's boring enough doing the little work there is to do by myself, but when someone else is doing the work and I am just standing looking over her shoulder....oh my, they are going to be 2 very long shifts!   Now I have had a lot of scenarios running through my head.  She could be VERY smart and 'on the ball' and learn everything quickly.  Or she could be 10,000 miles away from the ball and dumber than a sack of hammers.  I am hoping she is at least some where in between and is a good conversationalist.  It would not be fun to spend 14.5 hrs with someone in a confined space who can't carry on a conversation.  No matter what happens, in exactly one week, I will say good bye to Impark and dance a jig up to the 6th floor of the Princeton Tower to do my final deposit! *sigh* life is good!

      Sometimes it is best to leave well enough alone.  I was drawn into the pretty new templates (and I really like my new one!) on blogger.com, and I ended up losing my comments as well as my links.  So bear with me as I try and get everything back to the way it should be.  I think I should have comments enabled on this entry, but none of the previous ones.  I will do the best to get the links back on the page if I can figure out where the codes go in the template.

      Today after church, I hung out with Jay while he waited for Pastors Leyton and Wes to come and practice the 'dry run' for his baptism next Sunday.  I will have to admit that I was a little bit apprehensive watching it, but it went quite well.  The staircase up to and down into the baptismal tank is quite narrow and they wanted to make sure they would be able to get him up and into the tank next Sunday for the real thing.    Now Pastor Wes' granddaughter Natasha (who is probably about 3 or 4 years old) came along and watched the whole ordeal.  She watched on with wide eyes and said in a very matter of fact way to me that when it's her turn to get baptised she wants to do it that way (ie have pastor Wes and pastor Leyton carry her into the tank in a great big sling).  I just kinda laughed and said cool.    Once they got Jay back into his chair and they were just making sure they had everything thought out for next week, little Natasha went wondering into the bathroom (right next to where we were all standing), I just thot she was getting restless, having to sit there waiting for her grandpa.  But no, about 2 seconds later I hear a tinkling....haha.  What an adorable little girl, no inhibitions about using the bathroom within view of 2 complete strangers, Pastor Leyton and her grandfather.  Hehe!

      Got a quick prayer request.  Mom went for a massage this afternoon with her therapist, Camille.  She told my mom about a friend of hers who has her own massage business who is looking to hire someone.  She is going to call me and talk to me to see if she thinks I might be a good applicant, and if so she would put me in touch with the person who is hiring.  So I don't know what this job all entails, however, I ask that you would pray for me.  I need to find a job fairly shortly once I am done school, and I this might just be a great opportunity for me :)  *crosses fingers*  Thanks!

      - Today I changed a boy diaper for the very first time.  I am now fully qualified to babysit my nephew (that's what Robin said anyway).  -I realized today that I REALLY have no desire to start up my own business (stupid business plan). :P  - I have absolutely no desire to get involved in aromatherapy (we had an aromatherapist come to talk to us today).  She said she has spent around $200 on 5mL of certain types of essential oil.....yeah, not that rich!  - I wish I had a jacuzzi tub in my home (had an underwater pressure massage after school today).    - I REALLY like the CD that Jay made for me, of mainly Christian music that is harder than I am used to (good driving music!).  - one cup of kraft dinner is worth 9 weight watchers points!  Wow, I've eaten a whole box before....that's about 4 cups I think...I'm a porker :@)

      So last night I was putting together a few resumes that I was going to go and hand out today.  And a thought popped into my head.  I recalled that Jason had told me a few months ago that he had heard that Dance Saskatchewan was looking for a massage therapist.  Well, I looked up their website and fired off an email with my resume attatched.  Today I got a reply to my email saying that someone would be phoning me today to set up an interview.  And sure enough, she called and I have an interview on Friday.  Now by the sounds of things, for the most part the job is mine if I want it.  And the lady on the phone was so nice and friendly and straight forward.  It sounds like a good job and a good place to work, I just have to work my butt off to find myself a steady clientelle.  She said she has had a hard time keeping people because they were not committed to working hard enough to get a steady client base of at least 20 clients.  Now that doesn't sound like much, but I know that it takes a lot of time to build that up.  So I am going on friday to further discuss the position and to see the space where I could be working.  I am feeling rather excited/overwhelmed at the prospect of this!!!  I was told and know that jumping at the first opportunity that is offered to you is not always the best way to go, but it sounded good.  I guess we'll see what the commission is like, but she said it was a very nice commission.  I would just have to work hard to build a client base.  Yeah....so if you could pray for me, I need some guidance.  I am sure that she'd let me think about it for a while, but yeah.  Wow, what a flukey fluke.  Or maybe that was my guidance??  Who knows!!

      I am heading home tomorrow.  As most of you know, I have been in Swift Current for the last 5 days.  It has been a great trip.  I have gotten to know Jay's parents a lot better and I am thrilled that (as Jay's mom told me last nite) they love me.  It has been a good experience staying with them.  His mom is kinda funny 'are you hot?  are you cold?  are you hungry?  are you sure?  there's food here?  want a cookie?  how bout some cake?  a chocolate bar?'  She's a very nice lady, but I can see why Jay tires of this in a small amount of time.  But as I pointed out to Lynette today, we aren't going to live here, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem ;)  Swift Current is a lovely little city.  For those of you who haven't been here, it is kinda hilly down here.  I was surprised when we hit the Landing (a lake just a little ways away from here), and there were some pretty big hills.  There are some great places here to drive where you can see the lights of the city from the top of a hill, very neat.  Then their lake, Lac Pelletier, is right in this valley amongst rolling green hills.  It's super cool to see right in the plains of Saskatchewan.    I also got the experience of going gopher hunting with Jay and Ken (the first of Jay's friends that I have met....if any of my single girlfriends are looking and willing to move to a farm about half an hour away from SC....he's a nice guy hehe).  Jay offered to let me shoot, but I felt kinda intimidated, so I decided to pass this time around and maybe next time!    Well I should go and visit with Jay's mom.  Jay and his dad went out to wash his van and have a 'man to man talk' haha.  I am feeling refreshed and ready to head out on the job hunt next week!!  I'll be house sitting for my sister and brother-in-law this weekend, so if you wanna get ahold of me I'll be there mostly from Thursday-Sunday.

      Yesterday was my real graduation.  The other one was more formal, but this one was more personal.  It was a long, but good day.  There was lots of laughter and a few tears along the way.  Larissa, one of my friends from class is from Flin Flon Manitoba and she is going back home.  Probably about 75-80% of our class is staying in Saskatoon, but she's leaving and it hit her pretty hard so we all had a good cry about it.  I am sure we will all make some effort to at least keep in touch, maybe I'll have to take a road trip up to Flin Flon for a visit!  I got an awesome gift from my parents for grad.  It is one of my mom's rings that she hasn't worn for years.  It is an emerald and diamond dinner ring.  This is going to sound bad, but in all honesty I never really liked it, however I always joked about if it was willed to me that I would take it and melt it down into something smaller and (in my eyes) nicer.  They gave me permission to do that.  My creative wheels have been turning since last night trying to figure out what I can make with some yellow gold, one .25 carat diamond, one emerald that is similar in size and 5 really small diamonds.  I was thinking maybe an emerald ring with the emerald and the small diamonds....but I guess we'll see.  Anyone have any ideas???  So I am off to Swift Current today!  I am looking forward to a road trip with Jay!  I will fill you in when I get home!!  Have a great week!

      By now, most of the people reading this probably know about our unfortunate news yesterday.  My mom lost her job of 15 years.  Now maybe it wouldn't be such a problem if she did not bring home our only source of income.  We will be okay for a while due to a severance package, but I can't begin to imagine looking for work after not having to look for work for 15 years.  I am not relishing the thought of looking for work, and for me it's only been two and a half years since I did some job hunting.  I would appreciate your prayers for our family.  We have been through more difficult times than this and survived so I am sure we'll be okay.    On a happier note, can't wait until Friday!  I get to go to Swift Current with Jay for a few days.  It will be the most consecutive time we have ever spent together hehe.  I am looking forward to seeing where he grew up and hear stories about his childhood.  I am hoping to maybe go swimming in the lake if it's not too cold!    Do you have any plans for the summer??

      I am done my board exams *sigh*.  After worrying and complaining about having them earlier than usual (usually they are held in the middle of July for the summer term....cause we aren't quite done our classes yet), they are done.  I can say with about a 95% certainty that I passed...and there must be something seriously wrong with my judgement skills if I did fail....cause it was mostly a piece of cake.  Just some of the questioning was strange ('describe the treatment protocol for using isometric and isotonic exercises'......huh??)  But within 4 weeks (most likely sooner) I will know whether I can offically call myself a registered massage therapist :)  I had a great day yesterday!  I got up at 6am, bolted awake thinking I was late for my exam at 8am.  Got up, got ready, went to the exam, was done by about 10am.  Then I had the whole rest of the day to myself.  Cause there is really nothing left to study for :D  I think the only thing that could have made my day better was Calgary winning that hockey game without overtime.  But what can you do??    Well I'm off to church!  Hope y'all have a great week.  Anyone who is interested is invited to my little graduation celebration on Thursday.  It is at 2pm at the Odeon, and there will be cake involved.  It'll probably be about an hour long, so if you'd like to come ;)

      I was getting a little bit concerned, not incredibly but a little about the superficial nature of Jay's and my concersations lately.  We used to discuss some pretty deep stuff, pretty important stuff, but for a while we seemed like we were almost stuck in a rut of small talk.  Now I realize that not everything that comes up in conversation will always be profound, but for a long time with us it was.    But we have had more deep conversation in the last two days than I can shake a stick at.  We have discussed a lot of things that have brought us SO much closer together and have made me fall even deeper in love with him.  What a blessing I have been given in that man, wow!

      So today I went all the way downtown because I had an hour appointment booked.&nbsp; I got there plenty early so I could do a little laundry and&nbsp;make sure I had every set up.&nbsp; Well one o'clock came and went with no client :P&nbsp; I also had 2 no-show clients last week.&nbsp; It is really frustrating!!&nbsp; Especially at this time because I am going down there for one or 2 treatments per day if I am lucky.&nbsp; So luckily I asked&nbsp;the executive director of Dance Saskatchewan if she wanted a treatment and she said she did.&nbsp; So I did still make a little money (my trip wasn't completely wasted!).&nbsp; I just don't understand.&nbsp; I think there has been one occasion that I have flat out forgotten about an appointment, it was a dentist appointment, but I called and apologized profusely because I felt bad for missing it and wasting their time!&nbsp; Well people just figure they can NOT show up for a massage appointments.&nbsp; Most places have a stipulation that if you miss a scheduled appointment, you get charged for it.&nbsp; Of course you cannot charge someone unless they come back for another treatment.&nbsp; So if I were them I would just not come back.&nbsp; So I missed out on 3 hours of potential treatment time&nbsp;(about $70 less on my next paycheck).&nbsp; Hmmmmph!  And dad went back to Calgary to help with gramma and grampa some more.&nbsp; So I have the house to myself except for the dog....he is soooooo&nbsp;retarded!!&nbsp; Anyone wanna party with me or come over for supper??&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I know that I complain sometimes.&nbsp; I try not to be too complain-y, but sometimes I guess you just can't help it.&nbsp; But today my dad has told me the same complaining stories at least twice.&nbsp; I realize he doesn't really have anyone else to vent to right now (mom's in Calgary and Robin's at Waskesiu) but it's pretty tiresome listening to that.&nbsp; And I never say anything, just sit there and kind of zone out and he just talks and talks and complains and complains.&nbsp; It is so draining to be on the recieving end of that.&nbsp; I feel kind of down today because I have just listened to him bad mouth my whole family&nbsp;today....*sigh* &nbsp; I have a wedding shower to go to on Sunday (a girl I went to school with is getting married) and I don't know that I have ever been to a non-lingerie wedding shower.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas of what I could get her?? &nbsp;

      So I had my first 2 clients at work yesterday!  I officially started Monday, but didn't have anything until yesterday.  I had 2 one hour treatments and did some figuring, and even at my introductory rate ($35 for the first hour treatment) I made about as much as I used to make an Impark on a Thursday evening (6.5hrs)!!  It is nice to be a professional :)  I have 2 more treatments today.  This is really encouraging!  I know it had only been 2 days, and I had been busy out handing out fliers, but I was starting to think it was going to be a while until I got some business!  I want to thank everyone who has been telling people about me, hopefully things will continue to pick up speed so I can actually set some hours, right now it's whenever because I am available pretty much all the time and I don't want them to have to turn anyone down!

      I bought a wedding dress today.  Most of you who don't talk to me everyday are going to say 'WHAT?!?  You aren't even engaged yet.'  Well yes, that is true, there is no ring on my finger, but it's on it's way (hopefully, haha) and we are planning a wedding for January.  I have been told by most married women that I know that when you go dress shopping, when you try on the right dress, you just KNOW!  Well I had that experience today and that dress is absolutely amazing :)  Cost a little more than I was hoping to spend, but when it's the one, you know.  Of course I would never try a dress on that was ridiculously expensive, like over $1000, cause that just seems wrong.  She even gave us a discount on it, which was nice of her.  She is a super nice lady, and if anyone who is reading this is planning to get married, I recommend Jessica Bridal.  The same lady was working there 4 years ago when my sister got married and she remembered my sister and the dress she bought, it was cool!  I am going to call some caterers tomorrow to see what they can tell me, and if anyone is familiar with any that are really good, or that I should stay far away from, lemme know.  I am tossing a lot of ideas in my head right now, haven't been sleeping really well lately ;)  Any input would be tremendously appreciated!!    I am starting my quest for massage clients.  I now have some business cards (kinda generic ones that I'll write my name on, cause they had a hard time keeping people around up to this point, so they stopped making people cards with their name on them), so if you want one or two I'll have some, and I am meeting with Val again tomorrow and I will probably have some fliers to give out, or post.  I am offering an introductory price of $35 for an hour massage (first time only, then it's $45/hr) or $20 for a half hour (regularly $25).  That is a super good deal!  So if you, or anyone you know is looking for massage, I would SUPER DUPER appreciate it if you could send them my way!

      So it seems that a lot has happened since my last post.  I am now fully insured and registered as a massage therapist, so if anyone needs a treatment, and has insurance, I can give you a receipt and you can get reimbursed :)  I got that job at Dance Saskatchewan, but I have to find all my own clients.  So everyone reading this, tell at least 4 people you know about me, and tell them that most benefits plans cover around $200-400 worth of massage per year!    Jason and I have offically been together for five months now!  Time sure flies, considering I first talked to him on my very first day of the last term of school (Jan 5th), and it barely seems like very long, but at the same time it feels like I have known him forever.  I can't imagine life without him in it.  We had a very full day yesterday.  He picked me up at 10:30 and we went to the Saskatoon Zoo.  It was pretty cool cause I haven't been there in AGES!  We actually saw all the animals, and it was neat to be there with someone who had never been just cause it was like seeing it all through fresh eyes.  If you have an opportunity to go, they have a new exhibit....snow leopards, very pretty!  Then we had a picnic in the park.  Then we hung out for the afternoon at his place, watched some Simpsons, then we went for supper to Montana's.  Man do I like that place!  The food is really good and reasonably priced!  Under $20 for 2 of us for supper, I was impressed!  Then in the evening we went to a concert at the free stage of the Jazz Festival.  It was good, not really my style, but a very talented girl!!!  Then we all went out to Moxies for some snacks after, then I went home.  It was a really full and FUN day!  Oooooh and I also got a new watch from Jay :)  It's a really nice one.  With a silver bracelet and a blue face, and it has Indiglo and has the date on it.  Awesome!!

      I see the city lights all around me Everyone's obscure Ten million people each with their problems Why should anyone care  And in Your eyes I can see I am not just a man, vastly lost in this world Lost in a Sea of Faces Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine Because you traded Your life for mine  Sometimes my life it feels so trivial Immersed in the greatness of space Yet somehow you still find the time for me It's then You show me Your love And In Your eyes I can see And in Your arms I will be  I am not just a man, vastly lost in this world Lost in a Sea of Faces Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine Because you traded Your life for mine  If only my one heart Was all you'd gain from all it cost Well I know you would have still been a man With a reason To willingly offer your life  I am not just a man, vastly lost in this world Lost in a Sea of Faces Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine Because you traded Your life for mine  Just one in a million faces

      God has a forgiving character.  I think sometimes it is hard for us to grasp God's forgivness in our lives.  We have heard in church, youth group and Bible study groups that we are only to ask, and God will forgive.  And when you think about it, that's pretty amazing.  God is perfect and holy and he forgives us, who continue to sin and sin and sin and sin.  But we can come back to God and ask forgiveness and he readily forgives us again and again and again and again.   I was given a good perspective on this forgiving character just the other day.  I have been struggling with a sin in my life, and I finally confessed it to a friend of mine a couple of months ago.  That friend is trying to keep me accountable by asking me from time to time how I am doing in this area.  Well to be honest, I slipped up a couple of times, and felt too ashamed to tell my friend about it.  That friend asked me yesterday how I was doing, so I told them the truth.  It was hard, but they just held me and cried with me and forgave me.  I felt so unworthy of that forgiveness.  That should be what it's like to ask forgiveness from God.  Incredible humility, shame, fear....but I think many people, myself included just take it for granted that there will be forgiveness.
