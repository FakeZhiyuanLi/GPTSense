       Well, today is my "day off." That's in quotes because I have enough to do today that it doesn't even feel like a day off. Seriously, I don't even remember the last time I had a day off when I had nothing to do. I want a real day off. A day when I can just sit on my ass and do nothing. But that's not in the immediate forecast. So, today, after sleeping in (because I have to enjoy some part of my "day off"), and eating toast as I write this, Rob and I will be off to laundry. I would happily skip this, except that clean socks and underwear are really essential in life, so we'll be off to do laundry. Rob just suggested we could just buy more socks and underwear, but really, I'm broke, so laundry seems the more economical option. That and the only underwear I could afford right now would be the "granny panties" from Target, and, well, they're "granny panties." Enough said. After laundry, we'll have Chinese food for lunch -- there's this really good, inexpensive Chinese restaurant down the street from the Laundromat. Yum! (Rob is now poking me in the side for no apparent reason....) Then we drop laundry off at home, then head off into Ann Arbor to stop at AAA and pick up travel information for our wedding and honeymoon. Then I have returns to make at the mall. Finally, after all that, I think I'll be able to park my butt on the couch and watch something on TV. Probably the Olympics, since they seem to be the only thing on. (And Rob is reading this over my shoulder and thinking out loud that I don't sound that much fun to spend the day with today.)  :-P   So, that's it folks, a day in the life of Naarah. Not very exciting, is it? Rob is now mumbling incoherently... Something about monkeys. I think the lovebirds are affecting him (anybody want a lovebird??? Anybody? You know you do!!).... Ouch!!! Tiny cockatiel talons landing on my bare flesh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Sunny Boy is apparently offended that I mentioned the crazy lovebirds in this blog and not him. Alright, before I start to sound too crazy (I know, too late), I'll sign off, so I can go and get dressed and start my day.  PS I just spellchecked this blog, and apparently the word "blog" is flagged as an incorrectly spelled word! Ah, the irony!

       Ok, it's been a few days since I've posted, and a few things have gone on.  Of course, what highlights the past few week's events, is that Rob's and mine wedding rings arrived!  I've attached pictures below for you to see.  We're so excited!  May seems so far away, yet not enough time to plan it all.  My head is spinning!  (It's a good spin, though!)   In other news:   Ella and I had a good lunch on Thursday.  We walked around downtown Ann Arbor and then ate lunch at Grizzley Peak.  I found a really cool fossil at a store downtown, and now I have this jewelry design floating around in my head for it!  I'm so tempted to go back and buy it!  Ella and I made plans to go dress shopping when she gets back from out of town.  I promised her I'll even try on a white dress (I'm sure she'll bring her camera to get a picture!  Don't worry!)  Rob and I took my father out for his birthday on Sunday (his birthday is actually today).  We all saw  Collateral .  We really liked it.  Who'dve thought that Jamie Foxx could act!  Even more surprising is that Tom Cruise can act!  After the movie we went to dinner at  Buddy's Pizza  in Livonia.  Overall, it was a pretty good day.  Well, I'm going to head to bed soon.  It's getting late, and I'm working tomorrow.  Talk to you all soon!

       Not that I didn't have a whole week off last week, but that doesn't really count, because I was sick and spent most of it sleeping or in the bathroom.  But really, it is nice to have a day off with relatively little to do.  My friend Ella is coming over for lunch (should be here any minute now...)  After that, I'll probably buzz over to Briarwood in hopes to find something for my dad for his birthday.  And then to get an oil change and a tune-up on my car.  It will end at home, on the couch with Rob, watching the final episode of  Last Comic Standing .  Sounds like a full day to me!  Maybe something exciting will happen during the course of my day and I'll have something more to write about.  Other than that, you all can gasp in amazement that I'm awake before noon on my day off!  TTFN!

       I really, really, hate George W. That's why I take joy in his stupidity!  Here's the latest, greatest bushism for you all to enjoy, ponder, and, I'm sure come to the same conclusion that I have: The man is a colossal dumbass!   "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."   Doesn't he know any better? Yes, it's his and his Republican cronie army's sworn duty to screw over the American people! He's not supposed to say it! But hey, must be all the cocaine-deteriorated "brain" cells.

       Ok, really people, I don't check my e-mail for a few days and know how many damn messages I have in my bulk mail folder.  No, really, go on guess...  1,013!!!  Over a thousand!!  That's INSANE!  And you know what else?  In my mailbox was an e-mail from the Disney Store.  That, in and of itself is ok. I am admittedly a Disney fan.  However, they were advertising stuff for Halloween!   Halloween  people!  Last I checked it was August!  Not October!  I'm having a hard enough time acknowledging that summer is almost over... let alone time for  Halloween!   ARGH!!

       Well, I'm finally back to work after being home sick for a week. Other than really  not  wanting to get out of bed this morning, work went well. Slow, but well. On Mondays we're usually slammed with lots of finishing orders.  Pffft.  Hardly any. Half the orders were my film from the Toledo Zoo last week! Maybe the rest of the week will make up for it....  Rob had the day off today. He made me dinner for when I came home! Yay! He made sweet potato fries, rice pudding, and falafel. I haven't tried the rice pudding yet, but the sweet potato fries rocked! Unfortunately, we both agree that the falafel pretty much sucked. So, Boca burgers for dinner it is.   In Other News...         While sick, I've been catching up with friends. I talked to my friend Heather yesterday. Heather is my friend from college and lives in West Virginia. I went to visit her a couple years ago; it is soooo beautiful there!      I've also re-newed contact with an old high school friend of mine, Liv. Liv has her own web log,  urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/users/skeletoncrew/ . Liv and I were partners in crime back in day. If our art teacher wasn't already grey, we probably would have been the cause!      Also, my friend Tammy has her own blog:  urlLink http://tammyandtom.blogspot.com . It's because of Tammy that I met Rob. I met Tammy when I started working for Ritz. She thought she'd try to be a yenta, and set us up. Lucky for us, it's worked out spectacularly!       Back to Home:       Rob is now playing  Joust  on his computer! Do you guys remember that old arcade game?!? I had it on my Atari! Oh god, I've just dated myself! :-P This is just too funny watching him play this...      I want to pose a question to you out there in blogland: any suggestions on what I should do for my father for his birthday? My day has become a curmudgeon, and tells me that he wants to ignore his birthday. (Picture my father scowling all the while saying this.) I suggested taking him to the Renaissance Festival, or to a Tiger's game, or to dinner... all received the same scowl. So, any ideas out there?      I have to go now and chase lovebirds off the entertainment center. As cute and entertaining as the little feathered monkeys are, they don't belong on the entertainment center.      Hasta Luego.

       Well, I've been out of existence for the past few days, and I thought I'd let everyone know why:  I've been spending the last few days in the bathroom. No exaggeration here.  I have a real nasty stomach virus.  I'll spare you all the grusome details.  Today I've been able to hold down Gatorade and Saltines fairly well, a vast and marked improvement.  So, while I'm awake, I thought I'd let you all know, that yes, I'm here, I'm alive, and I'm working on getting healthy.   In other news:  Penelope is back from her surgery.  She's not too happy about it.  She can't do her ferrety back flips currently, and looks at us all miffed whenever she tries.  I'm surprised she's as active as she is.  She came home Wednesday, and last night she was all over the room, running, climbing, chasing the boys.  Needless to say, Ryker and Chief are very happy that she is home and staying with us.  Until Later...

       Ok, I'm up (hey, it's before noon, this  is  an accomplishment!)  Rob and I are home sick today.  I will spare you the miserable details.  So, what better thing to do while home sick, than to try and post pictures on your brand-new blog.  Then sleep.  Get up and feed baby lovebirds.  Sleep some more.  Then take a ferret to the vet to get fixed.  Then come home and feed baby lovebirds agin.  And, of course, sleep some more.  Maybe get up and watch TV before going off to bed.  Exciting, huh?  "Ferret to the vet to get fixed?" you're asking yourself (or, you may not be, but you'll get an answer anyway).  Well, as many of you know, I have two ferrets, Ryker and Chief.  Well, I wanted to breed Chief (he still has all his bits), so I made a deal with a breeder in Ohio, borrowed a female, and then we'd split the kits.  Well Chief and Penelope tried twice, both unsuccessful.  Rob and I have grown quite attached to Penelope (or maybe she has become attached to us... she is a bitey little thing, after all), so we decided to buy her.  And now she has to get fixed.  The surgery is tomorrow, but we'll be dropping her off at the vet's tonight.  I'm sure she'll have plenty to say about this!   So, the much-anticipated photographs:

       Ok, so everyone is doing this blog thing, right, so I figure "why not?" Knowing how well I actually follow through with things, this may, in fact, be my only post. Or, it may not. We have only to find out, right?  Ok, for you goyum ( non-jews ) out there reading this,  K'Vetch  is to complain. I figure, "hey, what better use for a blog." I can complain. About everything. About the idiot who currently occupies the White House. About my job. About the fact that it's my day off and Rob and I have spent it in the bathroom, sick to our stomachs. About the the fact the morons running our country make me sick to my stomach...  And, hey, I may actually post non-complaining stuff too! For instance, Rob and I went to the Toledo Zoo yesterday, courtesy of the U of M (very cool of them). We had a really good time. The new Arctic and Africa exhibits are nice. At the end of the day the wolves were even out! We saw the baby elephant and a REALLY loud bird in the Rainforest display (makes my apartment seem quiet!)  I currently can't figure out how to upload pictures, but I'll get it.  :-)  So, be prepared to see pictures from the zoo (because everyone needs to see a picture of a Polar Bear's ass) and from the going away party my staff had for AJ a couple weeks ago (we blew up one of the stupid Ritz bears!  2,000 rounds of firecrackers!  Woohoo!)  I'm signing out for now.  Until later!
