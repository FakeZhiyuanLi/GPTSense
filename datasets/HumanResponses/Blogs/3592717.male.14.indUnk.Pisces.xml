      Im so freakin tired of grown ups not trustin there kids. Me and kelly werent doin anything wrong except her mom not knowin i was at the movies but it wasent that bad. I mean it wasent like we were tryin to have sex or anything like that.....maybe a kiss of two but not that far. It gets on my nerves that parents do that kind of bull shit, and i tired of parents intereferin with me and kellys relationship. >:o I wish sometimes that all the parents would go away and all the appointments would be broken, no vacations, nothin to interefer with me and kelly. that we could just go away together and not b disturbed. And another disappointin thang. One of the very rare weekends that im not goin racin shes goin on vacation. :( its not FAIR! i hope soon that we can change that. Im gonna b all alone this weekend since shes goin 2 go on vacation, but it seems like im always gonna b alone since parents wont leave kids alone. I had to sit by myself at the movies :( i didnt get 2 sit with kelly and jennifer because kellys mom didnt want me around while she wasent there. Like Switchblade said " We were meant to live for so much more" so why cant parents listen 4 once. Anyways i had to sit away from kelly to keep her from gettin in trouble, and it seems to me that me and her r goin at seperate paces in our relationship. I think that i might b rushin things alitle along but i cant help it. Shes all i think about , all the time. But it seems like we r goin at different speeds. Maybe i should slow down but like  i said. I cant help it. Im not mad at her because its not her fault. Its our parents fault and i think that they should trust their children more. Well i guess that ill sit by myself for a while since im gonna b the only one here 4 me to talk to. I  LOVE u bunches kelly and im sorry that i couldnt sit with u at the movies. I only hope that we can change it. but maybe u wanted me 2 slow down since it seems like im wantin to much to fast. But i CANT help it. Have fun on ur trip. :D luv u tons and tons and tons more. Hope we get 2 c more of each other. I REALLY do. the movie was great but i didnt get no suga. Maybe we could get together later sometimes kelly. LOVE U! mwah :-* cant wait to c u again.       5/10/04 For EVER

      I miss her so much! I was out of town this weekend and i didnt get to c her because of racing I would have rather stayed at her house instead! She is the reason for me to get up in the mornin and i didnt get to  talk to her but a little this weekend. i missed her so much. But thats gonna change since i get to spend tha nite at her house. ( hopefully...) i cant wait till i get to see her again. Shes my baby and will always be in my life. I hope that we never break up and i think that we could have a relationship in the future since weve had relationships with each other in the past and now in the future. I cant wait till i get 2 c her. She is so wonderful. I had tha worst week ever! i missed her all this weekend because i didnt have a reason to get up. I wasent gonna get to talk to my baby so wat was the point of gettin up. ISSAC SHUT THE FUCK UP! lol :P i luv u tons and tons and tons kelly  Shane

      Boy do i luv partys. i went to one the other day with my baby. Boy was it gettin steamy up in there. :P i had the best time. There r alot of tips 4 u 2 know about throwin a party. FIRST u need to have a variety of music so people dont get pissed off if u dont play any of the music that they listen 2. SECOND u need to have a mix of snacks and alot of alcoholics. Espicially if im there. boy do i luv smirnoff ice. THIRD do NOT have chaperones or parents at the party. It makes it so boring. FOURTH let there b games so people can get close and personal. well those r all of the tips that i can think of now so ........i guess ill leave u with these tips. Me and my baby r gettin hot so im runnin out of time.
