      It was my senior year in college. President of the National FJCPPhA. Bearing with my Toxicology subject. Doing my thesis.  I kept a very tough schedule at the time.  I just came back to school that day from several campuses i visited on an official business for the FJC.  Need to do my thesis. Need to finish soon.  It was around 4 o'clock in the afternoon when i donned on my lab garments.  Rotavap... on. Extracts ready.  I stationed myself inside the thesis lab. that day. The bright window on my right and the door on my left. I rested my right arm on the sink, sitting on a stool, while watching my extracts concentrate in front of me.  Several minutes have passed. People were getting busy  at the hallway. Classes just finished. Others were preparing for new ones. I was boring myself to death.  I can't remember whether i was tapping my fingers in the silence, or kickin the dust under my feet.  Another student passed by my door. I noticed the urgency of his walk in the periphery of my eye.  He passed by again... flashing a glance towards me. I walked towards the door, hoping to catch him pass by. And I did.  "Looking for someone?" i asked. "Yeah, may class pa yata sya. I'll just hang around and wait for him," he said. So i said 'ok' and went back inside.  Classes finished by 5:30pm and i saw him still patroling the corridor.   "Tapos na ang klase.  Wala ba sya jan?" i asked again. Then he replied. "Wala e. Sige antay lang ako dito."  So i said 'ok' and went back inside. He followed this time.   So I began asking him some stuff out of courtesy. So I found out that he was a med student aside from the uniform he wore.  "Ano ginagawa mo?" he began.  Then, it started. I told him about my thesis and he shared his own research as well.  It was 6:30 already. I told him that all classes are done by this time. He went out and on his way.  So i thought. He came back several minutes later. "Teacher ba hanap mo? Try mo sa faculty a few doors away, " i told him.  He went out one last time. Then he walked in. 'Came up to me. "Asan na yung friend mo?" i tried to ask. "Sa kabilang building," as he moved closer.  "You're not looking for anybody, are you?" i concluded. He just smiled.  He leaned on me - pushing me against the sink. He unbuttoned my lab gown and went for my crotch. No time was wasted. He grabbed my dick and tugged me towards the bathroom.   He knelt in front of me; went down on my dick. Smeared his face with my juice; sucked me hard.  We jerked off facing each other and went on with our separate ways after finishing.

      01/08/04  For a bit of a backgrounder on what you're about to read, Manitoba is a place in Canada where my wife and I plan to migrate to.  At this point, we're both already very anxious of where our plans will take us.  By the way, we're not yet married at this time. It's a period of stabilizing our relationship, our families and our friends.  So let me just say that we've had it tough for ourselves till about a month after our wedding.  Here it is folks. Read on.  ---  My consciousness brought me to a place which i  recognized later on as some sort of a Chinese restaurant. You know, tables and chairs of ivory white, blinding  lights, and mirrors that were set on a large squarish dining  hall - very reminiscent of Chinese establishments I'd say.  I was eating lots and lots of fried chicken.  The companions I kept at the table seem to have faded into the background. Or, I may have just been paying much attention to the chicken I was gnawing.  I mean it literally that I don't seem to feel how much I've eaten by this time (which, from the amount of bones set aside on my plate, I would guess is too much). My  interest seem to focus on the texture of the chicken, its color and the aroma.  Gluttony, I thought.  Next thing I knew, I was strolling down a sidewalk lined with small foodstores keeping company with another person who felt like a really close friend or partner.  After passing a group of , say, 5 or 7 who appeared to be friends of mine (although I couldn’t remember who they really were), a small store suddenly came to my attention. There was a plump woman who was stationed there selling me fried chicken from a “bilao”.  Disgustingly, I thought,  “wow! fried chicken again! yumm!”  Although bloated as I were, I didn’t waste any moment and started helping myself with the lot.  Carrying on with my feast, I tried to hide my embarrassment by distracting the vendor with small talks.    I couldn’t remember when and what made me decide to stop but the next thing I noticed was that I was walking heavily along a descending path that leads to a humble house and an empty lot on its left that I recognized as my own.  As I geared towards the empty lot, I noticed the small  wooden gate on its entrance, a few small trees and shrubs scattered inside, and a number of dogs roaming freely in the place.  I didn’t know how and why but I thought carefully which scrap I was carrying should be handed to each dog.  A dog that looked like a beagle of white and black fur got my attention. Then, awkwardly, I heard a man spoke in the background – like a narrator.  “ A manitoba can smell and get attracted to gangrenous patch…  ,” the voice said.  Alarmed and rattled, I looked down and noticed the dog sniffing the back of my knee. Suddenly, a black patch appeared.  It wasn’t the least bit painful though.  To my fright, I saw it growing and  spreading – like my liver going down to my legs.  Before I could recover from the shock of what I was  witnessing, I realized I was already awake.

      i remember having this dream or nightmare... or wetdream when i was still in grade school. i was maybe 6 or 7 then.  let me tell you that this was the time i got to watch my first porn flicks by sneaking into the living room late at night while my parents were up and about...  doing the icky stuff (ulkkkk!)  this was also the time when i saw my first Penthouse and Playboy issues on the drawer of my mom's employee. 'getting all hooky with a brand new massager toy i used to stash inside my jock while browsing. man, it was heaven.  ----  i was conscious of myself that night - peering through doors... landing several  flights down into a den completely lacking maintenance. it was filled with grime and cobwebs.  what unfolded was an intricate design of a madman's laboratory. it was decorated with aspects of a sterotypical lair - cold mist, bubbling brews of green and blue, glassware and antiquities.  the smell of fear filled the air. the sight of a woman pinned down, on the metallic surface of what looked like an examining table, gave my heart a loud thump of excitement and dread.  she was naked... or maybe i stripped her naked  with my mind. she was flawless, with smooth and milky skin and plump womanly assets that complimented her facial beauty.  the excitement was building inside me... whether it was adrenaline or testosterone,  i didn't give a shit.  i drew myself closer... practically exposing myself to the scene. the frailty of my childish limbs made me feel disgusted as the figure of a full-grown man approached the victim.  he was not handsomely dressed. but he wore a masculine long-sleeves over his jeans. he looked fit and strong... but naturally built and proportionate.  with stealth and seduction, he crept over the woman. the man lifted his right thigh over the table and  supported his weight with his left arm on the side. he unlatched his belt and unzipped his fly.  i watched ever so closely as he took out his hard dick and pushed it inside her. the expression on his face i can never forget. it was like he's forgotten his surroundings. his mind seemed filled with white glow. he danced... suave while she surrendered her body to the rush that filled her.   unattached yet wanting - he finished off inside her.  then i woke up. jacked myself off against the  bathroom wall...  sat down - stupefied, i looked.

      have u ever dreamt of your mom dying? the shivers it brings you... the goosebumps & intense mixed emotions... it's a horrifying experience.  one like you'd never be able to flee.  peace - from a full day's work. rest - away from the constant ringing in your ear. then i closed my eyes...  i search for my mother.  there is news of her absence. i couldn't explain that awful feeling of foreboding. she's dead, i fear. also, the people arround me,  seemingly close to me, affirm my suspicions. darkness envelops me... all i remember now is a narrowing focus on a blank space... slowly being eaten by darkness - by nothingness.  what do i do now? how do i go on?  i've been so used to having her around, near or far. what do i tell my sisters? how will they take it? what of our business? what of our financial obligations? i'm now a married man. but i feel an immediate retreat to my lonesome. i feel so detached from the world yet, everything feels heavy on me all of a sudden.  mom is dead. oh my god!  damn it. damn it. damn it.   wait, she's come back! she's not missing anymore. how happy and desperate i am to see her. she's not dead! what an awful prank that was! (where she came though from  i had no idea)  we celebrated her comeback. what a relief! everything now feels like a dream sequence (uhuh) - like a distant memory, a funny memory. before i know it, all will be back to as they were. routines. routines. routines.  my mom's not feeling well, she says. and yet, just like the way she is,  she grabbed more pills than what's needed. stubborn old **toot**. that's how she is.  BANG! like a movie in my mind, i watched her fall into slow-mo. she overdosed. this is real.  she's really died now. OH MY GOD! she's really dead!  i'm falling apart. i feel the walls of my strength crumble and crash down beside me.  can't life be any more cruel?  how can I possibly experience my mom's death twice in  a matter of a few moments? MY MOM'S DIED TWICE!  my eyes are now drenched in tears -  AS I WERE WHEN I WOKE UP. (where is my wife, i need her)

      The book claims to focus on the holy grail - finding it and protecting the location's secrecy. However, like other books such as  The Templar Revelation , the  Da Vinci Code  i just another consipracy theory advocate. Theirs is just to prove Jesus Christ's humanity and the mistakes that came along with it.

      Ben Affleck decided to forfeit his shares in the multimillion project which allowed him to build a machine that gives the operator a clear view of his future.  He wakes up with only incomprehensible fragments of what happened -  memory and memorabilia.  Moments later, he finds himself in a string of sticky situations  in which he discovers that he is equipped to escape with the use of 20 everyday tools that he prepared for himself before he gave  up his memory of the project.  The climax of the story focuses on a particular foresight that showed him a glimpse of his death.  Here, he'd be shot by his former  collaborator afterwhich, he'd fall several feet down.  How is time portrayed in this movie?  In the end, he'd be able to evade his fate with the help of a signaling  watch (one of his tools). Death comes for his attacker instead.  Later, he'd find one more piece of instruction from his package that  will make him $90M richer - regaining his forfeited paycheck.  First, no foresight pertaining to his escape was revealed other than his death. It could be valid that he prepared a number of tools for his escape after seeing his future. However, knowing that he intentionally provided himself with an escape plan after seeing  his future for the first time, his future should've changed.  Instead, he sees his death another time and claims to have willed  to change it at that moment - leading to his survival. Hence, his  future should've changed the moment he provided himself with an  escape plan and he couldn't have seen it from the machine thereafter. Also, the point where the events took a sharp turn showed Uma Thurman coming out from the emergency exit door instead of the perpetrator of  his would-be murder. This turn of events didn't result from the use  of a tool he intended for himself. It was completely out of his hands.  It may be attributed to the fact that he's already seen his future  so every action that followed would be conscious of this event.  Second, the movie described the phenomenon by which one could see  his future with the use of an extremely powerful lens. This lens  would, theoretically, be able to bend the light that passes through  it up to a complete 360-degree turn.  Also, considering the earth's  rotation, the person would then see himself a moment in the future  that took the light to travel 360 degrees around the earth, at the  direction following its axis and over a period which would take the  light to overtake the earth's speed of rotation.  This would then  set limits to the period in the future the operator would be able  to see.  The farthest in the future he could see would be the length  of time it would take light to travel around the earth's equator -  moving earlier in time as the direction shifts closer to 90 degrees  from the equator (not to mention the effect of earth's gravity to  the bending of light). Therefore, the future he sees is not infinite  and also, he could not see earlier or in the past that is before the  nearest distance for the light to travel (unless, of course, they  could figure out a way to have the light go around in space at a  larger perimeter.

      06/14/04  light-headed, humid and panicky - what more could I ask for?   it was the perfect recipe for a bad day. late for the late registration. beating the deadline for the 4th quarter progress report. unprepared for the meeting with the boss.  last night i soaked myself in the rain - jogging around the UP circle and doing  situps on one of the benches of Palma Hall for every round.     - the rain on my face; my clothes intimate with my body; and i feel nothing but the heat scorching my legs and the wind rushing to embrace me.  solace. i close my eyes. i see darkness.  then the cold creeps inside me.  a hole unravels in my mind and i reach for the end of its depth. all alone yet complete. i found solace.  light suddenly builds to blind me.  i open my eyes and rush blissfully to my wife  who has been waiting patiently inside the church. electrical crosstalk. orgasmic and invigorating. i prayed and thanked God for the blessings and challenges in my life.  Tonight the rain has fallen.  The cool air drops to set the mood once again.  It's 9:07 pm and I still have to begin a nightlong's work to beat that deadline. Thank you Lord for I am alive.

      07/10/04  Friday, 9th of July 2004. alice is getting a gift for joyce’s departure. i’m helping Joyce, on the other hand, to get her office files  backed-up.   8:00 pm as usual, I wasn’t able to follow my work plan to the dot. my 250 cc of blood and 100 cc from two others just plated three. the MLR assay was only good for acetyl-HPDG.  adcc wil have to wait till Sunday.  meanwhile, my wife was getting herself busy with review.  as if we weren’t already late.   8:15 pm i had two purple cds on my hand.  MNP: Copying files to cd.............. (joyce is finally leaving. Fulbright. right. hmm, ‘hope  i’m not missing any folder.)  MNPlib: Copying files to cd.... (joyce is leaving. wow, she’s been here long enough.   she has so many files!)  XP, good. Amor: Copying files to cd........... (my god! joyce is leaving! i wonder how the lab will be  when she’s gone!)  Sponge: Ngye, there’s no USB port. guess i’ll just have to upload her files to a briefcase.  ok, i’m good. now, we have to go.  8:30 pm standing along the MSI pavement… waiting for IKOT…      the anticipation is gradually building inside me. “para sa inyo, meron akong time!” she says.  this was       the reply i was praying for to      our offer to have one dinner finale before the       curtain call. Then, she goes,       “Mocha Blends hehe –  para aakyat na lang ako.”  no complaints here. on the contrary, it was music to my ears. UP-Katips:  Balara. My head felt blank. Stuporous, I thought.       Rustan’s Expresslane. hmm. we’re getting close. Yellow Cab.        Shit! Her adobo recipe is still on my corkboard!        Seattle’s Best.  Lagpas! ‘Mama, para!’  8:45 pm checking our belongings, we practically crept towards       Mocha Blends (s if we weren’t so late). then, there she was – composed and seemingly peaceful –       holding her handyphone and her elbow casually seated       on the table. “Hi Joyce!”  9:00 pm ...some have gone and some remained... the memento zeny’s so nicely put together drags the tears       from our eyes.  fortunately, i was strong enough to put       up a fight.  joyce, on the other hand, began wiping beside      me.  ...all my bags are packed. I’m ready to go...  9:15 pm i thought nothing of the Australian beef stew. bland and chewy,       it felt like tissue paper in my mouth.  The risotto,       however, was particularly nice.  The pesto on turkey and       bacon pie I found enjoyable as well.  where are our Mocha Blends friends? And the guy who bought us       coke light? the past two weeks were especially hectic for joyce – polishing       what’s left of her work, running her travel errands, packing       her bags and bidding goodbyes. her pre-departure orientation story was fun. Rubbing elbows with       the likes of Isagani Cruz… politicians… artists… and other       Fulbright alumni. yeah, that could be overwhelming. i’m glad she liked the bag and pen Alice bought her.  Shopping       for joyce had always been a challenge for us –  let alone, doing a last minute one.  What? 10 alrdy?  10:00 pm Her driver didn’t show up today.  Looks like she won’t have one       to take her to Alabang tomorrow too.  Ma’am Giselle is out       of town with Dr. Padlan for a two-day seminar at Angeles       University.  No Mang Jo to the rescue. SOS Ate Agnes.  Yosi... had to go down.  More Fulbright stories. Then, the inevitable Cris, Julia, Pam and Jay stories.   We all have our own issue with the quartet. Now, the topic       moves on to moving on.  Joyce is moving on.  Gina had      moved on – and now there’s news of her going back.  Taboo.        Diarey, Fritzie, JC, Baby, Kaye-Ann, John – yup, the new       kids on the block.  We know the tides have come for us.        I agree that there’s a birth of a new cycle in the lab. We have to go.  10:15 pm Outside, we were seated like a tricuetra.   Three lives… funneled to MSI for a few years…       Alice… MMO RA, MSc Micro student, Malaysia, Germany, Wife.      Joyce… Malaria, MSc MBB student, Paris, Immuno-Head, Fulbrighter.      Dennis… MSc MBB student, Thesis, COSTED, NKTI, Husband.  Joyce – Me.  Alice – Joyce.  Me – Alice.  10:30 pm The story of the lab.  Conflicts with the quartet.   Three individuals.  Three perspectives.  Three lives. Three directions.   Kilimanjaro drinking spree… jamming.  (it’s all coming back now)   Alice leaving for Germany.  (memories)   Antibuddies. Moomba. Barbieri’s Concert. Little Asia. Libis.  Alba w/ Dr. Padlan.  (there’s so many)   Taal Volcano.  Mount Maculot.  DAP yosi.  Mocha Blends session. LB.  (I’m gonna miss her)   Long talks.  Makati Fulbright adventure.  Gimmicks.  (now, I’m sad)    ... all my bags are packed. i'm ready to go... ... i hate to wake you up and say goodbye...   bye, Joyce. Goodluck.    Now, I’m all stoned from lack of sleep.  Melancholic. Thoughtful.   ---   What’s up ‘dud’?  What was that? Ohh, dude. It’s really getting noisy around here.  Uyy p’re! Hindi ah, p’re! Kaw talaga, p’re! Di p’re! Talaga, dud!?  – homophobia     rising.  flake. starbucks can really bring out the worst in people sometimes.     especially, loud, faggoty, pretentious… i'm really getting annoyed by this guy.     grumpy old man, that I am this morning. ‘and rightfully so! arrgggghhhh.  Great. Nuisance bad enough to ruin the moment.  End of blog.

      d'you ever get yourself tied-up in a conversation with a cab driver? i'm sure you do.   if he's, as most cab drivers are male, not complaining about the foulness of the government system, or giving the finger and cussing at the top of his lungs behind the wheel - well, he'd be watching his life flash before his eyes in the middle of a traffic jam.  not all cab experiences are discouraging, mind you...  at least not during my hour with mr. cab driver  X   Mr. X is 40ish... and quite decent. He wears wisdom and wit on his face. His clothes express the humility of his life experience.  His cab - reeks of the caboodle of  "lutong ulam" carried by his last passenger. I'm speaking of the kind of smell that wafts onto your face when you open the family fridge. Yeah, that bad.  So, the first few minutes of my ride was met with silence. The smell gradually building under my nose and my head slowly getting knocked-out by the stench. It couldn't escape my attention.    "Yung sumakay sakin kanina ang daming ulam na bitbit!" he began.    it felt good to know that i wasn't the only one getting really bothered by the smell.  "Dapat, kaming mga OFW pag-bumalik sa 'Pinas e may siguradong tatanggap sa trabaho," he sighed. it would seem too spoiled of him to have said that. he did not, however, struck me as another lazy git whining about  not getting any from the lusts of life. the lines on his face told me he was tired of trying to make ends meet - just as how most Filipinos are doing nowadays.  But let's not go on without telling you how we got there. I'm not about to deny you that he has his share of typical cabby mentality - which all seemed valid anyway. It began with talk of oil prices... how 200 pesos worth of unleaded gas won't take you on a round trip to work  anymore like it used to.  Then, there's the dismay over the government leaders' lack of foresight in the city engineering because, now, we can't maximize our railway system due to houses and buildings crowding the city streets.  "Pinabayaan nila kasi ang tren natin. Eh di sana napapadali ang paguwi sa probinsya. Iba ang utak ng gobyerno kasi e. Hinahayaan nila na kung sinu-sino lang ang nagkakalisensya sa pag- operate  ng mga bus sa'tin. Kahit nagiisa ka lang, kung may pera ka para makabili ng iisang bus, papayagan kang bumyahe - parang jeep. Kaya ayan, nagkalat ang mga bus na hindi naman napupuno. Humaharang lang sila sa  traffic ," a slight frown disfiguring his kind face and bringing his full brows together.    "Di pa nga naaaprobahan ang dagdag sa  flagdown  namin e. Buti na lang malalaki na ang mga anak ko. Dalawang babae. Yung isa nasa Dubai. Yung pangalawa ayaw umalis. Hirap talaga kapag natali sa  boyfriend .  Sinabi ko nga sa kanya, madaming boypren diyan. Kung gusto mong mag-asawa, kahit bukas pwede ka  nang makapag-asawa. Basta mabait at may magandang trabaho, ok na. Eh kaso, madalas nadadala sa hitsura. Karamihan naman ng kung sino ang may hitsura, walang maipagmalaki. Alam ko yan. Dumaan na ako jan," saying as-a-matter-of-factly.  I couldn't help myself from raising an eyebrow to his last sentence.  Then I decided to be nice and shook it off my head.  "Kasi nag-Saudi ako noon. Kaso, makaraan ang ilang taon, umuwi rin ako. Malungkot ang buhay sa Saudi!" he exclaimed. He continued. "Wala man lang libangan. Ang baho pa. Pwede mo lang gawin doon eh  magsugal. Kaya ang buhay ko doon eh trabaho-uwi."  "Delikado mambabae doon. Pupugutan ka talaga. Minsan sa isang taon, kapag Ramadan, may mga Aleman na dumarating para magtinda sa daan. Kasama na rin sa binebenta nila ang mga sarili nila." Was that a sparkle I saw in his eyes? Yeah, it was, along with a flash of smile that suggested an interesting climax to his story. "Dumarating kasi sila na naka-bus.  Pero wala namang mga motel doon kaya sa bus nyo gagawin. Ang gaganda talaga nila. Matatangkad. Ang gaganda ng katawan. Bughaw ang mga mata. Kaso nga lang, madalian. Mahirap nang mahuli. Nagrereklamo nga sila kapag matagal e. Syempre kailangan nila makarami!" I was trying hard not to appear too eager at this point. All I could  do, however, was let out a few laughs. "Ang hirap pala no'n

      I haven't told you about Joyce before. we work in the same lab... together with my wife. While I do mechanistic studies and assays,  my wife handles marine microorganisms; and Joyce takes charge over immunology.  The three of us became more of a triad over the years. We've come to be very close and open to each other about our quirks, worries and of course, our studies.  But it's time to say goodbye.  She'll be on her way to do her PhD in Louisiana. 3-4 years i presume. It's inevitable. A smart, resourceful and driven woman like her will eventually move abroad.

      yeah Toto, we're definitely not in Kansas anymore. lucky for her, she has her twinkly red heels to bring her home.  i don't mind.  like the tin man, i finally got my heart. like the lion, i found my balls. like the scarecrow, i stuck my brains where it should've been all along.  back 2002, it all started with a kiss on my cheek. this girl everyone calls 'Ate' - struck me as someone who can shake my principles and challenge my being. and yeah, we got drunk a few days before her departure for Germany.   flirt, i thought. she's flirting with me.  yet, unassuming, i watched her go. i was left with nothing but a daydream of how it was had we gone steady.  more than a year passed. we got awfully close - but only as friends. i finally outted myself to her (dang, sometimes i don't know how to  control my honesty). we got closer and closer.  eating together for lunch became a routine. going out for drinks, movies, concerts, etc. became expected.  shopping for clothes together? yeah, we got to that point as well.  December 2 came. We celebrated our success in the convention with a bottle of crisp red wine, sitting on the baywalk along the shore, with nothing but the cool wind on our face and the melancholic blues of the clouds, sky, sea and land.    yup, i fished out my aquarian self and prepared to detach myself from the inevitable heart-to-heart.  we talked about life... ups and downs... families and friends... down to the last few gulps of alcohol.  "I think I'm already tipsy," she says.  And now, I'm a full-fledged married man. Complete with my life with my in-laws... and life with my wife's friends... and a new life at work now as a married couple... and a new life now just completely settled down.  It's been a helluva ride since then.  'Still is...  ... and I couldn't be more grateful.

      the director of NKTI has been wooing me for a couple of times already to take on his proposal for  reinforcing the research division in their Pharmacy Department.   my Boss just recently expressed her full intention in pursuing that biotech business of hers - and she wants me to be a part of it.  i can't even remember how it was offered to me (or if it ever was even  offered to me at all!)  i have now a full sched with the immunosuppression assays in the NKTI project underwhich I'm officially employed. i've also to finish my thesis which has  been dormant for years.  i have side projects i've put aside for the meantime on bioinformatics, phage display, mathematical modeling, etc.  why am i doing this, you ask? hehehe  not to torture myself. not to evade a bad situation. not to recover from a lost love.  but to maximize the skills and techniques i can  acquire from my present work, to take advantage of my boss's network, to equip myself for whatever my future job will require of me, and to maximize my income.  it would've been easier had i been still single. yet the irony presents itself, i would have nothing to do all these for if i were still single.  pragmatism surfaces once again.   i wanna finish only what i should finish in the meantime. i wanna earn as much as i can earn for the time-being. i wanna leave and start my own family immediately. i wanna settle down and be my own family man. i wanna be a dad alrdy.  now i'm faced with limiting my obligations yet maximizing my resources and gains.  boy, what a confused dude i've come to be. bummer.
