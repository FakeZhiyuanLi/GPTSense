      Maybe I was just having a bad day last Thursday...maybe not.  I've actually given it a lot of thought, and my recent situation (limited duty due to some medical issues, thus off the sub and ashore...with normal hours and weekends off) has reminded me how much I like being home on occassion.  My  urlLink most recent boat  didn't believe in time off...it was considered normal to work until late in the evening, and if you didn't you were looked down upon (and often paid for it later...leaving early once got you staying late a dozen times).   urlLink Where I am now  at least has relatively set hours and weekends off.

But I think back to  urlLink my last boat  and there were long hours and weekends, and sea time just the same.  But there is a difference...on that boat, the command didn't consider the long days a norm (liberty was actually important) and related to that was the fact that the crew was considered important, and was looked after and treated well.  You weren't looked down upon when you left earlier than another division, because there was the realization that everyone had high workload periods and low ones, and you went in cycles.  You certainly weren't penalized for it.

Maybe my experience there was just abnormally good (must have been, from what I hear lately around the waterfront) or my experience lately has just been bad...I tend to think it's both.  As I said before, subs aren't what they used to be.   urlLink The days of "Big Al" and brass who cared about their sailors is over, it seems.

      I know this will sound crazy...but you see that byline up there, about me being a 12 year Navy nuke (almost 13 now).  Well, I'm thinking seriously about giving that all up at the end of this enlistment.

Now why is that crazy, you ask?  Well, I recently (August 2003) reenlisted for 4 years, so when I come up to get out again I'll be at 16 1/2 years of service.  Only 3 1/2 years from retirement.  Totally nuts, eh?

But I have my reasons...and they are:

1.  I don't enjoy my job anymore.  I used to (all the nukes reading this now think I'm really sick), but since I started my second sea tour aboard a ship that I'll  urlLink not call by name (to protect the innocent :)  I've been pretty let down.  I'm a pretty good Leading Petty Officer, I think, but I'm constantly discouraged by the apparent sentiment aboard the ship I'm on that people are just a means to an end ("tools", as it were), and I don't really feel that I'm a part of the submarine community that I once was.  It's more like I'm a commodity, not a person or a shipmate.  Maybe it's just this boat...or maybe not.  I hear it more and more these days from people on many other boats at all levels (junior officer, senior officer, enlisted from bottom to top).
2.  I have a good job opportunity here in Hawaii, where I want to stay and live.  And it's not nearly as good (in terms of seniority and pay) if I'm retired Navy than if I'm a veteran (it's federal, and all my military time counts for seniority and payscale purposes).
3.  The command I'm at let me down in a big way, one that showed me that the Navy isn't at all supportive (or even caring) of family issues.  I went through a very difficult time when my wife went in the hospital unexpectedly and I was left caring for our 7 year old daughter alone.  This shortly before we were to put to sea for a short local training period.  The command's attitude..."find someone to care for your kid, you are required to go to sea".  This with me in Hawaii, no family or close friends here that I'd be comfortable giving my child up to, and   no   support or understanding from the command leadership (in fact, I was counseled on my "lack of responsibility" as a Petty Officer First Class, despite the fact that the situation came up in an emergent fashion and I had little to no time to make other arrangements).
4.  I don't feel that the Navy leadership (especially the senior enlisted leadership) has the interests of it's sailors in mind...again, that "commodity" thing.  The job I am eyeing for civilian life is at a facility where I served on shore duty, and the atmospere there was   much   better.  My  urlLink first boat  was like that, too...you were part of the "family", someone who mattered.  But my impressions, talking to various acquaintences around the waterfront, is that the entire sub force is no longer like that...it's more the mindset that you don't matter as an individual, but as a number, a name to fill a slot.  In fact, one of the most common terms I hear (one that I try very hard not to use, as it's offensive to me) is "bodies".  As in "we need bodies here to do this job", or "my ship/department/division is short on bodies", or "send more bodies"/"throw more bodies at the problem".  Sorry, but if it's "bodies" you want head down to the local boneyard.  I didn't join to be a "body".  

Sorry, this is a bit of a rant...I know.  But in 3 1/2 years I'm leaving.  There is no more reenlistment money to be had (they don't pay SRB past 16 years) and I think my value to the Navy ended long ago...after all, I'm just a "body".  My time will come with me to a civil service job, and the Navy Reserves will let me keep some of the important benefits.  I used to really value the submarine service, and in fact I still do...it's just not the same one that I see now.  Maybe I'd have been happier in a sub force of a different era. urlLink

      Wouldn't you know it...I ordered a tshirt and hat from  urlLink Demstore.com  to support  urlLink GEN Wesley Clark's campaign for President.   I placed the order in early January 2004, and by the time I got the shirt (hat still isn't here)  urlLink the general had dropped out of the race. 

As to the general dropping out...well, it was the right thing for him to do, I suppose.  John Kerry has run away with the race, and honestly I'd support either one.  Both are honorable men who served our nation well.  Many people make an issue of Kerry's anti-war protests in the Vietnam era; well, he had a good platform from which to protest the war, having been a highly decorated riverboat commander.  His protest involvement may have been termed disloyal then, but history has shown he was right...we got involved in a war we didn't belong in (sound familiar?).  But he served with honor, only protesting later (and with/on behalf of veterans of the war...his brothers in battle).  GEN Clark served too, though he stayed in as a career officer; but both are good choices for leading the US out of the Bush-induced slump we are in.  Bush has alienated our allies and made us a near-pariah in the world...and has some skeletons in his closet from both  urlLink the current war  and  urlLink the Vietnam era , ones that have significant bearing on his fitness to be our President.

I now am backing  urlLink John Kerry for President ...I do, however, sincerely hope GEN Clark will sign on as his running mate.  A Kerry/Clark team would be a force to be reckoned with in November 2004.

      Hey, guess what...today is my 13th anniversary on active duty in the Navy (I'd say "time flies when you're having fun", but I don't know if that is terribly accurate...)
     
    
</post>

<date>10,March,2004</date>

      I've not written here in a while; don't know why.  But at any rate, I'm still on Limited Duty, and I've been assigned to Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard (in X Division) until I'm cleared for sea again.  I've also been replaced on CHEYENNE, so I'll not be going back there.  Not brokenhearted about that, I'll tell you; after the incident I described in my Jan. 22nd entry, I have nothing but negative feelings about CHEYENNE.

Well, that's not all true; I served with some outstanding people there.  My EDMC was a inspiration to work for (he's the senior enlisted man in the Engineering Department of a nuclear sub - "EDMC" stands for "Engineering Department Master Chief", regardless of rank (the one in question was a Senior Chief, in fact).  Our new Engineer was one of the best I've worked with, at least from the brief time he and I crossed paths.  I had nothing but respect for the CO as well.  My displeasure had three main causes; one was the COB, one the XO, and the last was just my frustration over what had gone on in the 2 years I'd been there.  I never enjoyed my time on CHEYENNE, and despite the good people (and the fact that the old Engineer, with whom I shared an intense mutual dislike, was gone) I just had no desire to ever go back.  I found out today that my replacement was checking aboard, and I was glad; when I'm cleared I'll surely go to a different boat.

There were things about CHEYENNE I was proud of...my feelings on the Iraq war aside I was proud of our performance and being "First to Strike", and the 2003 Battle "E" as well.  They recently got an "Excellent" on their Tactical Readiness Evaluation (TRE), which is no small accomplishment.  My division was a good one (well, we had some dead wood, but those individuals left the Navy a couple of months ago...the guys remaining are great RO's).  My new chief seemed to be a top-notch chief, even though I had little time there with him.  I've heard nothing but good about him and the boat lately; unfortunately there was little that could overcome the hell I went through in November, and what the command did to make it 100 times worse than it already was.

I had an appointment at Tripler Army Medical Center today, and it appears my "problem" (microhemeturia) has no apparent cause.  They have checked my kidneys and bladder in every way imaginable (even with a camera to look around in the bladder...give you three guesses where *that* went in) and it appears I'm just one of those people who will have microhemeturia with no apparent cause.  I was glad it wasn't cancer (one of the possibilities) or kidney stones (another likely cause).  One kills you and the other just hurts like hell, and neither are ones I want to experience.  The doctor suggested annual checks to guard against possible problems (the microhemeturia will not be a valid indicator, as it's alway present with me).  Still doesn't clear up the high blood pressure, but we'll see how that goes (I'm of the opinion that the blood pressure issue was due in large part to my association with CHEYENNE).

As to recent happenings, we took Kinsey to see  Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King , then let her watch  Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring  at home (we're renting her  Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers  this weekend).  She's taken to carrying around a silver chain with a plain gold ring, calling it "my precious".  If she starts disappearing when she puts it on, or any large, bright, disembodied eyes appear in the distant hills I'll start worrying.

We got a treadmill and Jane got a dollcase (finally!!) lately, and I got a nice double-deck roll-away toolbox for all my tools (that one was long overdue).  Had to cut down on spending lately, as on Limited Duty they cut my sea pay and nuclear pay (and my sub pay, too, though I'll get that all back as soon as I have checked in with the shipyard and PSD...they stop it when you go on Limited Duty but restart it and backpay you the missed sub pay when you get Limited Duty orders...why they do this is a mystery, it's all in the idiocy of the admin rates).

I'm still seriously considering getting out and going in the reserves (with a civilian job at PHNSY).  I've been in touch with a reserve recruiter, and though it's a few years off I think the pros outweigh the cons.  However I'm also preparing my records for the CPO board, and while I don't think I have much chance this time up (CHEYENNE evals were not good to me) I would stay on active duty if I ever made chief.  Oh, well...we'll see.

This post has gone on long enough, I think.  You are probably getting bored, though I'd hope you are not as bored as  urlLink this guy .

      We went to Iraq to find/remove the WMD's, right...oh, no, it was to liberate the Iraqi people from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein.  Right?  If that's the case, if we are trying to make it better for the people of Iraq, to bring them the privileges and benefits of democracy...then why are our own troops committing  urlLink acts similar to what Hussein's regime itself did ...and in one of the same prisons where the Hussein regime committed some of it's atrocities.

I know (at least I sincerely hope) that this is not the norm, that these acts were committed by some bad apples in the forces over there.  However, I cannot accept the excuse of poor training (it doesn't take any training to know how to treat other human beings as human beings).  

This will surely have a negative impact on support for the war in Iraq.  My agreement or disagreement with said war aside, this surely will not make us very popular with the people of Iraq or the Arab world.  I'm not referring to terrorists; I'm speaking of the opinion of the ordinary Iraqi citizens, those we are, due to our actions in overthrowing their government, responsible for.  The Iraqis in these prisons may be enemy soldiers or suspected terrorists, maybe former Saddam loyalists...whatever; the point is it is not right for us to treat them like animals, to torture and humiliate them.  It reduces us to a level with terrorists and kidnappers (maybe even lower).  Whatever acts they may have committed, we owe them decent treatment.  We are supposed to be the liberators, not another group of tyrants with different uniform.

Am I pissed off at these soldiers?  You're damn right I am.  They not only reflect poorly on all military personnel (like the morons who commit crimes in foreign ports), but they obviously aren't even decent people; I'm ashamed to think they are fellow servicemen.  It is my sincere hope that they are held to task for this, and that their commanders are as well.  And the beginning of their punishment, if/when found guilty, should be stripping of all rank and removal from the service.  No one who does these things lives up to the core values of any service of ours.

      I posted this on  urlLink Plastic  today, and I'll share it here:

"What we really need is an overhaul in the way we choose politicians...a la reality TV (to give credit where credit is due, this was my wife's idea...but it's a good one :) 

From my  urlLink wife's  blog: 


After having looked at our voting system and the fact that over half Americans don't, vote that is, I think the system needs an overhaul. No longer should we have to tune in to boring new stations carrying only one part of the story on current candidates. No longer do we need to follow the issues and find our where each political candidates stands. As a nation, we should no longer need to actually find out about any politician at all or any issue for that matter. No, what we need is reality TV-American Politician- where the initial candidates have already been picked from the crowd by a panel of judges. Then each candidate need only show up once a week and compete by performing a dialogue in a semi-debate forum. As they debate, each politician can be given a phone number which people will dial to vote for them. One looser gets voted off each week until there is only one, the winner, the President. The second runner up gets the cushy job of VP. And that folks is a sure fire way to reach many more Americans, to inform more Americans, and hopefully encourage our lazy butts to vote knowledgeably and with great enthusiasm. 


Probably get more participation...I, personally, would prefer the "Survivor" format, stick 'em all on an island and let 'em vote each other off. I could just see it...Clinton would have been voted off for not pulling his share of the chores ("all he does is lay in the tent with the 5 female contestants") and Kerry would be continually comparing the island to Vietnam. Bush, meanwhile, would probably spend the majority of the show lost in the woods, Sharpton would be bringing religion to the local fauna, and Dean would just scream in bizarre fashion at everyone."

Well, the above is almost a direct quote...I did fix one typo :)

      I'm more and more sure I'm leaving the Navy at the end of this enlistment.  The stuff I hear about the direction of the Navy and how it's becoming less concerned about people (thought officially people are first)...well, I'm already a faceless, nearly meaningless entity (or so I felt on the Cheyenne), now it's all going to be done on computer.  No human interaction (or very little) in detailing, making rank, schools/training, etc.; I don't know how much difference this really makes, and it certainly isn't my main reason, but the growing impersonalness of the world just bothers me.  Can't even call a company/doctor/service center or the like without having to deal with a 10 layered menu automated operator.  

But I plan to work for Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard; I was happy there, and though many feel my leaving the Navy after 16 years is foolish (and in many ways I even agree, as I've been secure and reasonably successful there), I'm just tired of the Navy.  I no longer find any fulfillment or have any good feelings about it.  Sad, really; there was a time when I looked on the silver dolphins I wear and felt I really meant something, that I was doing something worthwhile.  There aren't enough bits and bytes here to describe why I no longer feel this way, but the Cheyenne, the policies of this administration, and the general beauracratic BS are big ones.  The lack of recognition, watching those who do very little be given the "good deals" and awards, the ever-increasing workload in port (with no increase in personnel and poorly trained newer personnel), the backstabbing and poor leadership issues...well, it's a combination of those, and more.  Even a good friend of mine, recently returned from deployment, feels the same.  He's retiring soon, and he returned to sea nearly the same time I did (summer 2001) from shore...we were together at PHNSY.  He echoed the thoughts of mine and others in that the fleet has changed in the three short years we were ashore, and drastically for the worse.

Enough negativity, though.  I'm going to make a blog resolution to be positive for the next 10 entries :)  I joined the  urlLink Sea Lancers Dive Club  at Hickam, and now can charge my own tanks.  I did a dive with a club member last weekend, and while it was a bit rough (got cut up a bit) and I lost my keys I still got some photos (not developed yet, but soon).

My PDA died...I have to send it in to Toshiba (thankfully the warranty was good for 21 more days when it died).  Oh, by the way, do NOT buy anything from Toshiba, at least not in the PDA category.  They did a number like Compaq in the mid-90's with the model e740 (see  urlLink my review on Amazon , among the others...this PDA was a lemon).  I had most of the same problems as listed in other negative reviews, and only the fact that it was a personal aid to me (not a critical job related one) made it bearable.  Too bad, the e740 had nice features and was made well...it had potential.  Companies don't care enough to admit they screwed up and make things right these days, though (they should have replaced e740's on request, made the customer happy...a company that does things like that gets my good word and repeat business).  I will put up with product problems if the company treats me well.  Take Dell and Saturn (computers and cars, if you don't know).  Both have been customer service masterpieces, despite between two Saturn's and one Dell I've had some annoying problems.  Saturn service is amazing, they treat you like you are a VIP, and the worst thing I can say about them is they are very persistant on follow-ups to see if you were happy (Aunty from Saturn of Honolulu calls every time I get anything done to either car to see if everything was OK...).  Dell worked great with me on the phone, had only a minor billing problem that was easily fixed, they were polite and courteous and again treated the customer like they were a VIP (the online salesman spent a large amount of time and even searched for ways to bring my comptuter price down to my target level with the features I wanted).

Well, that's all for now...dinner beckons.

      Ho, hum...boring.  I'm off today, had a bug or something (got really sick to my stomach yesterday) and stayed at home today, too.  

But one should never fill up the boredom with checking on the world situation, lest one get the jitters.  We live in a screwed up world, don't we?  Politicians are crooks and liars, people hate and kill each other over religion, superstar singers molest little kids, people starve to death in one part of the world and a country with an obesity problem tells it's farmers to cut production, and the expensive just gets more expensive.

Depressing, isn't it?  We (human beings) can't seem to do anything without either harming each other or making the world a less nice place to live.

Unfortuantely Merlin is not well.  He's got something wrong with his tail...it hurts him at the base of his back.  And of course he's mean as hell to the vet, so it's hard to treat him.

 urlLink Carlos , a friend of mine from shore duty, got out of the Navy (he flies home today).  Lucky guy.  I am looking forward to the day when I get out.  As I've said before, I just don't like the Navy anymore.  The ideals are good, but the reality is just not what it used to be.

      Having access to the AFIS Early Bird service is nice; while they are
news stories from other available news services (New York Times, LA
Times, Washington Post), the service pulls stories that are of a
defense/military nature.  This was the only news we had while I was
deployed in the Red Sea during the beginning of the Iraq war (it
seemed, then, way slanted to the government viewpoint...now it is
oddly slanted more to the liberal side of things).

          Remember me  discussing  "well rounded" sailors, and my letter to Navy Times on the subject ?&nbsp; I  love it when I'm right...though unfortunately&nbsp;this time it comes at the  expense of some suffering sailors on a Pearl Harbor  submarine.         &nbsp;     The boat is in a  maintenance period at  Pearl Harbor Naval  Shipyard , and like most nuclear maintenance periods the ship's operations  and how they conduct nuclear maintenance (work controls, procedural compliance,  safety) is closely scrutinized.&nbsp; Us nukes like to refer to it as being  under  NR's   "microscope".&nbsp; To say that it is imperative to do things right at this time  is an understatement (although with nuclear power it should be done right all  the time).&nbsp; "Doing it right" isn't always an easy thing...nuclear  procedures and work controls are some of the most complex and cumbersome in the  world.&nbsp; The increased monitoring during nuclear intensive maintenance  periods is an added check to ensure complex, infrequent and potentially  disastrous operations do not become disasters.         &nbsp;     This particular  ship is having problems...a lot, to hear the talk on the waterfront and in the  yard.&nbsp; Of course the level of oversight and monitoring by outside  nuclear-cognizant organizations (i.e., the ship's parent squadron, NRRO  representatives, nuclear trained senior personnel in the shipyard, and others)  escalates.&nbsp; This ship is at nearly the top of the escalation...no work or  operations in the engineering spaces is allowed without permission of the ship's  captain, who must further get permission from the squadron commander (the  "commodore").&nbsp; The senior enlisted man in engineering, the Engineering  Department Master Chief (EDMC, or "Bull Nuke") has been removed from his job,  and the Engineer Officer is close to being removed, as well.         &nbsp;     I currently work  with a very senior enlisted nuke at the shipyard, and due to his seniority and  experience he and a couple of other master chiefs from the yard were asked to go  down and do&nbsp;some monitoring...kind of like another outside look to assess  what the problem was and try to assist in a solution.&nbsp; Here's where I get  to the relation with my previous post.&nbsp; Seems one of the big, glaring root  problems on this boat is the three divisional chiefs in Engineering  Department...the Machinery Division LCPO (Leading Chief Petty Officer), the  Electrical Division LCPO and the Reactor Controls Division LCPO.&nbsp;  Apparently they are all failing fairly miserably in their jobs, and they all  have a major factor in common...  none of them has shipboard Leading  Petty Officer (LPO, or "leading first class") experience  .&nbsp;  This at first amazed me, that three nuclear first class petty officers in  submarines could make chief without LPO experience.&nbsp; Then I remembered  my  letter, and that chief I mentioned in it .&nbsp; Yes, he too made chief with  no LPO experience.&nbsp; The only difference was the three on this boat all went  to instructor duty at a nuclear training facility, where they made chief (and  likely first class).&nbsp; The chief on my boat did all his time, from nuclear  pipeline training to making chief, at sea&nbsp;on the same  ship.         &nbsp;     It's  telling&nbsp;to hear the problems at the divisional level&nbsp; No planning of  workload for the divisions (in a large availability like this, planning ahead  isn't just a luxury...it's crucial to success).&nbsp; No coordination of work  between the divisions (also crucial, as every system is tied together with  overlapping areas of responsibility, i.e, all Reactor Control systems (belonging  to RC Division) are powered by electrical distribution components belonging to  Electrical Division.)&nbsp; No senior technical expertise (i.e, when the junior  guys go to "ask the chief" the chief doesn't know the answers).&nbsp; Poor  senior enlisted leadership, as evidenced by poor standards/adherence to  standards and a poor level of training.&nbsp; In short...the chiefs aren't doing  their jobs.&nbsp; This was a common sentiment from the master chiefs from the  shipyard that went down there, as well as from squadron and even the boat's COB  ( Chief of the Boat , the Command  Master Chief...senior enlisted man on the ship, and usually a  non-nuke).         &nbsp;     Why?&nbsp; The  chiefs aren't prepared to be chiefs.&nbsp; They were probably smart nukes, good  operators and good instructors...good workers too, likely.&nbsp; But they did a  sea tour and left the ship as a "worker bee" or maybe a junior first class,  never having been in the LPO role (running a division with a chief to oversee,  guide and train them).&nbsp; They never learned first-hand how to plan a  maintenance period for their division, coordinate, and really run the  plant.&nbsp; But they all got those glowing evals, likely from being so "well  rounded"; taking the "bullet" jobs and collateral duties that made them stand  out, taking a heavy college course load ashore, "punching the ticket" with all  those extracurricular activities to make up for the lack of LPO experience and  make themselves look better for the chiefs board.&nbsp; It worked...they all  made chief.&nbsp; And their lack of experience and preparation is now coming  back to haunt them, as they learn the hard way that being "the chief" is more  than a new uniform and better bunks on the boat.         &nbsp;

      This just got broadcast on our internal website at work, and it's a subtle enough scam that I felt it could do with some wider dissemination.  This message was mainly concerned with government credit cards, but the scam is targeting any Visa or MasterCard.  It's apparently an older scam, but the  urlLink Urban Legends Reference Pages  does say that it is not only possible but has happened before.

///begin message///
TCPN# FY04-18  Scam Alert from Visa/Master Card 
Note: Level 3 APCs - IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO GIVE THIS NOTICE WIDEST 
DISSEMINATION TO GTCC PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS IN YOUR HIERARCHY. 
Bank of America (BOA) sent the following message in an email...Please see below reference to a  scam, which may affect cardholders.  It has been identified and if a cardholder receives a phone call please do not give them the information.   
BE WARY OF CREDIT CARD SECURITY CALLS 
A new credit card scam can put fraudulent charges on your account even though you never let go of your credit card or reveal its number. The scam works like this: You get a call from a person who says he is from the fraud department at MasterCard or Visa and gives a badge number. He tells you that your card has been singled out for an unusual purchase pattern. He then asks whether you made a specific purchase, such as $497.99 for an anti telemarketing device from an Arizona company. When you say that you have not made such a purchase, the caller says he will start a fraud investigation and provides you with a control number. Then comes the twist that gives the scammer access to your account. The caller says he needs to verify that you are in possession of your card. He asks you to read off seven numbers from the back of the card. A fraudulent charge goes on your account in short order. According to spokespeople for MasterCard and Visa, the scam scenario contains two big clues that tell you the call is bogus: First, MasterCard and Visa do not contact cardholders directly. That is done by the banks issuing the credit cards. Second, if a bank suspects fraud, it would not ask cardholders to verify that they possess a credit card. The banks already have all the account information they need. 
We realize these scams are becoming more frequent, but by being proactive we may be able to protect our cardholders and thwart any compromise down the road.

       urlLink "Washington's global anti-terror policies are "bankrupt of vision" as human rights
become sacrificed in the blind pursuit of security, a leading human
rights group charged on Wednesday." 

Ya think?

"The global security agenda promoted by the U.S. administration is
bankrupt of vision and bereft of principle," Amnesty head Irene Khan
said, launching its annual report.

"Violating rights at home, turning a blind eye to abuses abroad and
using pre-emptive military force where and when it chooses has damaged
justice and freedom, and made the world a more dangerous place."

Amnesty International went on to condemn the practices used in our
detainment of "enemy combatants", denying them rights of
representation and trial, prisoner abuse and mistreatment,
questionable arrests, and our resistance to a new global criminal
court.

It's sad that we are now the ones considered bad on human rights...we
who are supposed to be so free.  We have gone down the wrong path
somewhere...as the most powerful and wealthy nation in the world we
should be doing more to help our fellow man, not taking away rights
and being the perpetrators of the very things we were supposed to be
stopping.  Our nation was founded on an ideal of freedom...one has to
wonder what our founding fathers would think of our practices now.

          I had a somewhat  scary experience today...I changed lanes on Nimitz Highway to get ready to turn  into our housing area, and this guy in the lane I moved into was driving really  fast.&nbsp; He came up on me, honked his horn, started tailgating me and  flipping me off (it looked like he was cussing pretty loud,  too).         &nbsp;     I ignored  him...after giving him a flash of the brake lights to tell him to get off my  ass.&nbsp; He then followed me the rest of the way home and pulled up right in  front of my garage.&nbsp; He then rolled his window down and started bitching at  me.&nbsp; Since I live in military housing I had looked on his SUV, and he  didn't have a base sticker that I could see, so the first thing I said to him  was that he needed to leave, as he had no business on military property or in  housing without invitation (and I didn't want him around).&nbsp; His response  was "that's not the point"...my reply was that this was exactly the point, and I  was calling security (showed him the cell phone to prove it).&nbsp; He ranted on  until I rolled up my car window and started dialing...then he started to pull  out (giving me a clear view of his plate number, NDW 641 - Hawaii  plates).         &nbsp;     I called security  and reported him.&nbsp; Next time I'll cheerfully let him follow me to security  :)

      Holy shit...talk about a huge hassle.  I got the friggin' run-around
trying to get leave approved.  Here's one interesting dialog I had
with chief (I think...he wasn't in uniform, but did butt his way into
the conversation):

Chief "You have to take this over to the clinic and have Senior Chief sign it."
Me "Senior Chief...?"
The chief stares at me.
Me "Senior Chief...who?"  (at said clinic there are, at least from
what I saw, several Senior Chiefs)
Chief "Don't get smart with me!!"
Me "I'm not..."
Chief "Yes, you are!!"
Me "No, I'm asking what Senior Chief I need to see."

He then told me he didn't know the name, but it was "the only one
there"...then he asked a couple of people, who also didn't know, and
gave me a vague "well, he's the one you saw when you went on LIMDU" (I
didn't see a senior chief, I saw a third class).  At this point I
nodded, listened (barely) to the rest of his BS and left.

I finally ended up having the LIMDU coordinator, my command's medical
department, Transient Division and the Master Chief I work for sign
it...then dropped it off at personnel, where it was accepted without
any questions.

And I mentally wrote this mysterious un-uniformed "chief" off as a jackass.

If only more politicians thought like this:

"We have polar opposite views on a lot of things," Graham said. "But
we're not going to win this war if we focus on what divides us. We
need to focus on what brings us together.

"The men and woman who serve us are not Republicans or Democrats," he
said. "They're Americans."

          Spoiler  warning!&nbsp; If you don't want to know details of the movie,      do not read this  post    .         &nbsp;     OK...you have been  warned.         &nbsp;     Kinsey and I went  to see " Shrek 2 ".&nbsp; Pretty good...at  least as good as the original.&nbsp; They manage to poke a bit of fun at a lot  of other movies, concepts, places...Hollywood itself.&nbsp; Fiona's wedding ring  is forged from a scene curiously reminiscent of "Lord Of The Rings", and on  their honeymoon she has to throw the Little Mermaid off Shrek at the  beach.&nbsp; The kingdom of "Far Far Away" looks curiously like Beverly Hills  and Hollywood, and the wedding ball Fiona's parents put on bears striking  resemblance to the Oscars (complete with Joan Rivers announcing for "ME" (that's  "Medieval Entertainment").&nbsp; Some (like the folks house-sitting for Shrek)  would rather change the channel and watch "Knights" ("Cops"),  however.         &nbsp;     The story basically  centers around Fiona's father's dislike of Shrek...being an ogre and all...and a  deal he's forced into by the Fairy Godmother (a very evil character).&nbsp; See,  the Fairy Godmother is Prince Charming's mother, and has promised him Fiona as a  bride.&nbsp; But Shrek got there first (last movie), and when Prince Charming  arrives the lady wolf is there to break the bad news (Fiona's married).&nbsp;  After a disastrous meeting with the parents, Shrek reads Fiona's diary  and&nbsp;thinks her lifelong dream of Prince Charming is what she really  wants.&nbsp; He&nbsp;steals a potion that turns him and Fiona into humans (Shrek  to a very buff man, Fiona back to her old princess self), but the Fairy  Godmother uses this opportunity to make Fiona think her son is Shrek turned  human.&nbsp; She then persuades the King to give Fiona another potion that will  cause her to fall in love with the first man she kisses (in the hopes it will be  Prince Charming, who is really a spoiled mama's boy).         &nbsp;     Shrek at first  decides to let Fiona go, thinking Prince Charming is what she really wants...but  he overhears the plot between the King and the Fairy Godmother and realizes both  he and Fiona are being duped.&nbsp; He races to beat the clock and stop Fiona  (in the process getting arrested on "Knights" and having to be sprung from jail  by his friends Pinocchio, the three pigs, the three blind mice, the Big Bad Wolf  and the Gingerbread Man).&nbsp; He, Donkey (who, as a result of the potion is  for a while a "noble steed", a large white stallion) and Puss In Boots race to  the ball, expose the plot, and defeat the Fairy Godmother (leaving Prince  Charming to the Ugly Stepsister, a bartender at a dive in the bad side of  town).&nbsp; Fiona has one last chance to make the change back to human for her,  Shrek and Donkey permanent, but in the end decides she loves Shrek for the ogre  he is...and lets midnight toll before kissing him.&nbsp; Oh, her dad?&nbsp;  Turns out he had a deal going back further than anyone knew...seems once he was  a prince locked in the body of a frog, and getting him the hand of his princess  was what the Fairy Godmother was holding against him for his  cooperation.         &nbsp;     Can anyone say  "Shrek 3"?&nbsp; This one  did  so well at the box office this weekend , and has been so popular with crowds  that "Shrek" may well be the next big series franchise.&nbsp; It's certainly  better than many of the non-animated movies out  there.

           I've been going through some odd,  unexplainable depression lately.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t know why, but it's a bit scary to  just feel like life has no real purpose.  I tend to think it's in part to  my uncertain future...I'm still on Limited Duty, I am too far from my EAOS to  apply for jobs (however the prospect of getting out with no job secured yet is  daunting).&nbsp; I don't have a really satisfying job now, and going back to sea  just makes my job satisfaction worse.  I'm committed now, though...I'm  getting out of the Navy at the end of this enlistment.&nbsp; Even if I don't go  in the reserves, a federal job will allow me to make the most of my service time  and I'll be happier.&nbsp; It's not all about money (in fact I may not be far  above breaking even), it's about happiness.

      I'll be blunt:

1.  Poor leadership - they promote people too fast in many instances,
and they promote guys who are the "well rounded" vice the really
capable (see my entry below).


2.  The extraneous BS - there are a thousand and one requirements you
have imposed on you that detract from your actual job and duties. 
Goes back, in part, to the "well rounded" concept, but much of it is
just standard military BS that has grown unchecked over the years. 
Take training, for example; one problem is that quantity is emphasized
over quality, and the quantity grows everytime someone up the chain
sees what they perceive as a need or deficiency.  The result...the
average submarine engineering department sailor attends 5-6 hours a
week of classroom-style training, this to do a job he spent 2 years
learning in schools and another year doing under instruction on the
ship to qualify.  This is classroom training outside of
OJT/drills/practical learning.  And the administration of these
training programs takes the LPO and Division Officer a
 significant  amount of time each week.  This is at sea or in
port.

Then there is the cleaning - still under extraneous, because (again)
of the amount.  We once calculated in an average week at sea that most
guys do 12-14 hours of cleaning (9-10 watches in a week with a 3
section rotation, doing cleaning for one hour after each watch, plus a
3-4 hour all-hands field day each week...and this doesn't include the
time you are supposed to dedicate on-watch to cleaning, which in my
experience was directed to be about 1/2 to 3/4 of a 6 hour watch).

Throw in drills (1-3 a week in port, three to five drill periods with
multiple drills each at sea, more if an inspection is near) and you
are looking at about 25-30 hours a week that is spent not doing your
primary job...instead, it's training, cleaning, and drilling.

Now, those things are necessary...but believe me, the amount of time
dedicated to them (which includes, in addition to the numbers above,
more time for those who have to prepare the training, or the drills)
is out of whack when you consider that, at least in port, there is
usually a good 30 hours a week of solid in-rate work to be done
(maintenance, testing, repair, ordering parts,
scheduling/administrating the maintenance, etc.).  So, on a
conservative estimate you spend, in port, 3 hours a week drilling, 5
hours training, and 10 hours cleaning (an hour a day, plus a three
hour field day, plus two more in a "responsive" sense, at a minimum)
and you have taken up 18 hours of the nominal 40 hour workweek.  This
doesn't include watchstanding (which eats up about 4-6 hours of the
workday every third day for all your sailors), the time spent in
going/coming to/from all this training, and the time getting
out/putting away the cleaning gear and reinstalling the stuff you pull
up to clean under.  Rough figure is about 20 hours a week doing stuff
that isn't addressing your workload.

So when does the work get done...when do guys study for advancement
(which the ship's training does woefully little to prepare you for, in
most cases)...when does the general military stuff (counseling, evals,
preparing awards, PT, quarters, mentoring) get done?

It doesn't, in a lot of cases.  Well, the work does (often rushed,
done after hours when guys really want to be home, and thus done
shoddily).  The rest...well, it gets shoved to the wayside until it is
neglected so long that it becomes a crisis.

Oh, on top of all that...to make rate these days you have to be "well
rounded", remember (see below).  So you have to have your collateral
duties, your out-of-field qualifications, all that stuff.  When do you
do that?  Well, many spend significant amounts of their off-duty time
doing it (and if you aren't there in the "off" hours you are derided
and considered a slacker), many others do it when they are supposed to
be working, thus foisting off their work on someone who never gets the
opportunity to be "well rounded"...as he's doing the work!


3.  Taking care of our sailors isn't important anymore - sure, there
is lip service paid and plenty of programs out there, but commands
don't  really  support people who need help.  Trust me, I've seen
this happen often enough to believe now that this is the norm rather
than the exception.


4.  The "buddy system" - it's not just for overseas liberty.  This,
sadly, has been around for as long as we've had a Navy, and I'm sure
we aren't unique...but favoritism on the part of (or being disliked
by) one's seniors usually makes all the difference in your
success...not your ability.  Same idea goes if you are in any kind of
trouble...if you are connected, you are safe.  If not (or if you are
not liked) you are screwed.  If you rock the boat and try to do the
right thing (which often isn't the expedient route the ship/CO wants)
you often are the target, and the scapegoat when a head needs to roll.
 (I've seen this firsthand on several occasions, as well).


5.  Organization - or lack thereof.  For all our instructions, memos,
policies, procedures, checklists and the like the Navy often is run on
a crisis management "chicken with it's head cut off" mentality.  The
amount of administrivia for nearly everything makes even the simplest
of tasks (say ordering and replacing a light bulb) a chore that takes
5 times longer than it would in your house...and kills two or three
trees for the paperwork in the process.


6.  The "forest for the trees" - meaning we often can't see it.  In
the Navy, the "big picture" is so often lost we have a term:  LOBP
("loss of big picture"...alternately "LOBF" for "loss of big flick"). 
Sadly, the leadership gets caught up in this the worst...they who are
supposed to guide us through the forest get bogged down in climbing
every tree.


7.  Job satisfaction - this is, of course, a personal issue for most
concerned.  But I hear/see/personally experience the lack of job
satisfaction all to much.  Innovation is becoming more and more rare
in the era of "if it's not in the book, it can't be done" mentality. 
There seems to be no real reward, and much of what we do is done out
of "it's always been this way" mentality or for no good or discernable
reason.  How much satisfaction can one get from a job that no one
(even the chiefs or senior leadership) knows the reason for, and that
has no clear purpose or need to be accomplished.


That is, of course, my opinion...others may not agree.  But it's many
of these things (especially in regards to my last submarine and my
observations at my current command) that have driven me to the point
of deciding that I'm getting out.  The pay and more importantly the
nature of the job aren't good enough anymore to put up with
shortcomings that keep growing and piling on themselves.

      Amazing what technology allows...I'm blogging from my Pocket PC.  I won't say where...you can guess.  But my subject is my career...or rather, my desire to no longer pursue a Navy career.  I simply do not see a future in it, I no longer enjoy or get any sense of accomplishment from it...it's more of a burden and something I just intensely dislike.  More later.

          Looks  like that wedding we may have fired on in Iraq was a  gay  wedding .&nbsp; Guess in the eyes of the conservative "Religious Right" that  makes it OK.      &nbsp;    (DISCLAIMER - Before I'm labeled a cruel bastard,  the link above is to a satire site.&nbsp; And let it be known, by the way, that  when we accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, several  years ago, I was one of the three people who sat down one day and made up the  "Belgrade  - Priceless"  parody that apparently got circulated around the Internet (the  original had slides with photos of the jets and a map of downtown  Belgrade).&nbsp; Not being insensitive, mind you, but a bit of dark humor never  hurt anyone...)

          Great...just what we  need.&nbsp; To fight extremism with extremism.&nbsp; Seems an Army general, one  who has made some really questionable comments ("He said terrorists are trying  to destroy the United States because, 'We're a Christian nation.' He told a  Muslim warlord, 'My God was a real God, and his was an idol.'"), is now a top  intelligence official in the Defense Department, and  may  have recommended  practices by military police to&nbsp;pry more information  out of Muslim detainees at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison.         &nbsp;     Another reason religion has no  place in government...it breeds extremism, and the desire to go after the guy  that doesn't worship your "God".         &nbsp;     Faith-based initiatives,  indeed.

          Interesting.&nbsp; This sure  takes the carpet out of the idea that the prison abuses were the work of a small  band of bad apples without the knowlege of their superiors.&nbsp; (Unfortunately  the WSJ is a subscription site, and BugMeNot didn't have any passwords for  it...but below is an excerpt.)               By Greg Jaffe and David S. Cloud, Staff Reporters  Of The Wall Street Journal     Senior U.S. military officials in Iraq, including two advisers to the top  commander there, reviewed a strongly worded Red Cross report detailing the abuse  of prisoners at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison last November -- but the Army did  not launch an investigation into the abuses until two months later.     The senior legal adviser to Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the top U.S.  commander in Iraq, helped draft a formal response to the Red Cross's November  report, according to one senior Army official. Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, who  oversaw the military police guards at the prison, signed that response and sent  it back to the Red Cross. Gen. Karpinski said that she also discussed the report  with Gen. Sanchez's top deputy, Maj. Gen. Walter Wojdakowski, in a late November  meeting.     In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Gen. Karpinski said  officials at first generally disbelieved the Red Cross report. One military  intelligence officer at the meeting in late November drew laughs, she said, when  he joked, "I've told the Commander to stop giving the Victoria's Secret  catalogues to detainees" -- a reference to the Red Cross's complaint that some  prisoners were being forced to wear women's underwear on their heads.     The late November events show that top military commanders were alerted  to the abuses by the Red Cross earlier than they so far have publicly  acknowledged. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld testified before the Senate  recently that officials at the Pentagon learned of the abuses after a soldier  alerted them in mid-January. The Defense Department then launched an internal  investigation.      I smell  cover-up.&nbsp; I really do.

          The controversy over  Michael  Moore's film at Cannes  has ignited a debate on at least  urlLink one message board   (understatement of the century).&nbsp; Prompted me to pen some opinions of the  administration, and solidify my position on why I'm not voting for Bush.&nbsp;  In summary:  /// As to Iraq...face it, Bush lied about his motivations  there as much as Clinton did about boinking Monica. He's not even as good at it  (lying) as Clinton (will anyone ever be?). Add to that the fact that he's at  *best* a mediocre president who has done precious little to really improve the  country (but has managed to make us just a little...or a lot...more disliked in  the world community)...well, sorry, but if the US was a corporation, Bush the  CEO and I a stockholder I would either a) vote for new leadership or b) sell now,  before the stock plummets any further. ///  /// For the record, I  think some conservatives run good operations...you might be surprised to know  that I voted for Jeb Bush in my home state of Florida..and Bill O'Reilly, while  I don't usually agree with his politics, actually tries and succeeds in making  sense and putting up a good bit of commentary..I can see, even respect the other  side, even if I don't agree. Too bad most conservatives (and to be fair most of  liberals) can't have a civil debate." ///  /// Calling Bush a "twit"  was in a moment of pique...but I will say I don't have a lot of respect for him,  nor do I think he's too awful bright. I'm sorry, but he's, at best, a mediocre  president. They've all got their faults; in my view he just has more than most.  My views have changed over the past several years, and the GOP no longer  represents them...the Dems do, to a degree, and while all politicians are to a  degree crooks I don't have a lot of faith in Bush in that regard, either. Too  much in his administration seems..fishy.&nbsp; Halliburton, the Abu Ghraib  issue, the Iraq war (mainly it's motivations and it's lack of a coherent exit  strategy), the apparent quest for Iraq even before 9/11 (granted that's not  proven, but it smells nonetheless), his less than admirable environmental  policy, the Patriot Act, preemptive warfare, the economy/jobs...he/his  administration hasn't impressed me on these at all. And while the prison scandal  is being portrayed as a few bad apples, the policies and tacit approval for  departure from Geneva Conventions (and outright departure/denial of GC rights in  regards to Gitmo) is something that goes to the top. He's the skipper,  ultimately he's responsible for what happens on his watch. Not that I'm calling  for his impeachment...I'm just not comfortable with him leading the nation, and  I'm voting accordingly." ///  Granted, these are taken out of  context...but I don't have right to post other's comments.&nbsp; These are my  own.&nbsp; I'm only posting 'em to air my opinion on the Bush  administration.&nbsp; The last one says it all.&nbsp; I don't trust Bush, I  don't respect him, I think he's done a poor job of leading the nation, and the  nation is suffering (and will continue to go downhill) with him in  office.

          Wow...and I though I had it bad  for gas here in Hawaii.&nbsp; I'm paying $2.01/gal on the base, which according  to CNN is the  national  average now .&nbsp; In LA it's as high as $2.30/gal, and even the lowest in  the nation ($1.85) is $0.50 higher than what I was paying about a year ago here  in Hawaii.         &nbsp;     All says one thing to me...we  haven't done enough to find and develop alternate sources of energy.&nbsp; We  are still too dependent on oil (note I didn't say "Middle East oil", as where it  comes from is irrelevant).&nbsp; And one day, probably not more than&nbsp;a  century or two from now, it'll be gone, and we'll be in a  lurch.         &nbsp;     My next car...hybrid or  electric.

         Want to talk about silly...I'm in a  discussion on Navy Knowledge Online (restricted access site, sorry) that started  on the subject of thongs in white Navy uniforms (for those who don't know, you  can pretty much see through whites).&nbsp; Now, the sailor that got counseled  for wearing them was following the *letter* of the regs (which specify color,  i.e., white or skin tone...not style), but her supervisor thought they were  "inappropriate".&nbsp; I have the rather unpopular opinion in the thread that a)  the problem isn't ones choice of undies but the transparent nature of the silly  friggin' white clown suit/uniform of ours and b) people at her command have way  too much time on their hands if they are worried about what underwear she is  wearing (and just what are they doing staring at her ass anyway?).      &nbsp;    Of course the latest post, a reply to me,  had a complaint about making the whites thicker/different material (less  transparent), saying it was already too hot for "standing on a steel deck in the  middle of a sweltering hot summer day in Norfolk".&nbsp; I agree, but say whites  aren't the uniform for that anyway.&nbsp; I know, years of tradition say that  "sailors must wear whites on topside/quarterdeck watches in the good 'ol US  Navy"...I say crap.&nbsp; It's a warship, not a friggin' museum.&nbsp; For  ceremonial occasions, sure (that's what *dress uniforms* are for) but daily  business/watchstanding...bull.&nbsp; Maybe the new working uniforms (or, here's  a thought, the *current ones* that we fought so hard for, you know, the ones  that were supposed to be *more* presentable than the old dungarees) should be  the  standard  shipboard working/watchstanding uniform (and hey,  guess what...you can't see through 'em).&nbsp; Dress-up is for dressy occasions,  which normal in-port daily operations are not.&nbsp; Funny, most people with an  ounce or two of common sense can see this.      &nbsp;    Oh, then there is the attitude of "it's  always been this way" or "I did it, so should all that follow".&nbsp; More  bull.&nbsp; My response to that line of thinking (a bit blunt, especially in  replying to a lieutenant commander) was:      &nbsp;    "That is another of the hallmarks of a  volunteer force...we aren't a bunch of conscripts who have to be content with  doing things the old way because that's "always how it's been done" (a saying I  hear all too often, and one I'd love to outright abolish). We all have brains,  to think and question and suggest/foster change."

           I wrote a response to a letter in the most  recent issue of    Navy  Times   .&nbsp; I'm putting it here to illustrate my  point about&nbsp;problems with the way the Navy promotes these days.&nbsp; In  addition to the below, I'd also like&nbsp;to point out that the guys who make it  their priority to "punch the ticket" of what they think the boards are looking  for (i.e., all those collateral duties and extraneous qualifications) are also  generally not doing their primary job well/at all, and burdening others in their  division who have to take up the slack while they are out becoming "golden  boy".&nbsp; I've seen that, too...a guy who is an E-Division LPO and Command  Career Counselor (LPO due to seniority/experience, CCC to get him a "bullet" for  his eval to make Chief); he did a passable job as CCC, little to no job as ELPO,  and he will likely make EMC due to the glowing evals (meanwhile his division was  really run by a couple of sharp EM2's and he was generally clueless as to what  was going on).&nbsp; Contrast that to another EM1 who, when he took on  the&nbsp;job of CCC on the same boat, asked to have another&nbsp;EM1 be LPO  (though he was the senior); he felt he would be slighting the job as LPO while  being the ship's CCC.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a superb CCC, but (even though he  eventually turned CCC over and did an equally superb job as LPO) he was skewered  in&nbsp;evals for basically not doing both.&nbsp; Sad, I thought it showed good  planning and foresight to acknowledge he couldn't do both well, but he was  regarded as a slacker by the command (he did, however, have immense respect from  his division).&nbsp; SK1(SW) Goblirsch's letter is in the 24 May 2004 issue,  which is out in print but not available online yet.  ///begin  letter/// I have to applaud SK1(SW) Goblirsch for his excellent letter ("Well  Rounded Sailors?" May 24).&nbsp; Well said, SK1!&nbsp; I've watched with  increasing apprehension for the past 13 years the Navy promotion system and it's  scary tendency to promote (especially to Chief/Senior Chief/Master Chief) guys  who were so "well rounded" that they were virtually clueless in their own rate,  or at best had theoretical knowledge but were woefully  inexperienced.  Long has the saying been "ask the Chief"...but aren't the  chief's supposed to be the experts in their rate?&nbsp; While the role of the  chief isn't strictly in-rate once they put on that anchor, juniors look up to  the division chief as the most experienced and technically knowledgeable guy in  the division.&nbsp; But the push to have "well rounded" sailors, while well  intentioned (and not all bad) has produced many chiefs who just don't know their  job anymore.  I can recall an example, a newly minted chief I met on my  last boat.&nbsp; I'm a submarine nuke, as was this chief, and he seemed like a  pretty good guy.&nbsp; He'd been on the boat for quite a while, and had come up  from a PO3 on the same boat.&nbsp; He was smart, no question there...probably  way too smart to be a wrench turning sailor.&nbsp; He had a lot of knowledge,  and in nuclear power that sometimes is overemphasized.&nbsp; See, this chief had  done all the things to be "well rounded"...qualified Chief of the Watch (a  non-nuclear senior watch that a nuke would rarely, if ever, stand), held a  myriad of command collateral duties, punched all the wickets to make the board  see that he was the "well rounded" sailor they were looking for.&nbsp; Paid off,  it seems; EP's got him to PO1 and CPO a year early on each count.&nbsp; Now he  is a chief, but while he was punching the ticket to be "well rounded" he was  doing precious little in his rate and in his division.&nbsp; Seems he was never  an LPO/leading first class...ever.&nbsp; Seems above qualifying watch supervisor  he'd never really been in a leadership position.&nbsp; Had no experience running  a division, planning maintenance periods, handling all the details that come  with being the LPO (and later the chief).&nbsp; It's unfair to him, in a way,  that he will go on to another boat having so little in-rate or divisional  leadership experience...you see, that next boat will look to him to be "the  Chief"...and he likely will struggle for quite some time to fill that  role.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; He doesn't have the experience to run the division, to  plan the work, to manage the personnel...he's never had to do it.&nbsp; Sure,  he'll make a great CCC, DAPA, Urinalysis Coordinator, CFL.&nbsp; He's probably  got his BS by now.&nbsp; But when his first class comes to him for the  leadership he needs, the voice of experience, the technical knowledge to get  that critical job done...the chief isn't going to have it.&nbsp; He was too busy  in his past becoming "well rounded" to meet the wickets of the  board.&nbsp;  SK1's letter will likely draw it's share of barbs...likely  many from the CPO community.&nbsp; But maybe, just maybe, he's on to  something.&nbsp; Why do I say that?&nbsp; I've had a few chiefs like  that...great guys, lots of potential, but little real clue in their field.&nbsp;  I'd rather have the top technician, who has also proven himself as a leader in  his field (i.e., LPO) be in charge than the guy who spend his time being a so-so  in-rate performer but is qualified a bunch of superfluous watches and has a  college degree...that guy isn't going to be much help when the gear breaks, or  the workload towers over the division, or the junior guys have questions  requiring the voice of experience and can't get the answers when they "ask the  Chief".

        Finally,  a state  has  the balls to legalize same-sex marriage .&nbsp; The "Christian Right" will,  of course, be all beside themselves.&nbsp; Screw 'em...doesn't seem like much  "right" about them these days, anyway.&nbsp; I looked over the reasons why  same-sex marriage should not be legal, and I found them lacking and quite  thin.&nbsp; It all boils down to a moral argument, one that this  list of reasons  could not make  convincingly enough for me.&nbsp; There is no good reason why not, and the  Family Research Council did nothing but make itself look like a homophobic and  moral-imposing bunch with the page in question.&nbsp; In a way I hope that  Massachusetts set a national precedent that eventually gets upheld by the US  Supreme Court, if for no other reason than to annoy the hell out of the  "religious right".&nbsp; Damn arrogant bunch they are, thinking their morals and  values should be legally imposed on everyone...that is dictating law out of  religion, and personally I find it (and the majority of these religious groups)  repulsive.

          Just watched Jim Carrey's  "The Majestic" .&nbsp; Different  sort of role for  Carrey , a  serious one (there are some funny moments, but overall this was not a  comedy).&nbsp; Carrey plays Hollywood screenwriter Peter Appleton, who years  before had gone to a club with a girl to impress her.&nbsp; The club, it turns  out, is a Communist hangout, and in the early 1950's you did not want to be  labeled a Communist; especially not in Hollywood.&nbsp; Appleton is blacklisted,  his upcoming movie scrapped, and he drives off drunk the night before he is to  appear before the   House Un-American Activities Commission .&nbsp; He has a wreck, wakes up on a  beach with no memory and is taken in by the small California town of Lawson,  where he bears uncanny resemblance to hometown hero and Medal of Honor awardee  Luke Tremble, missing since shortly after D-Day in France.&nbsp; It's been nine  years, and the small town, which paid a huge price in lost sons to WWII, gives  Appleton a hero's welcome, thinking he's Luke...not knowing who he is or what  happened, he goes along, all the while trying to remember the person this small,  kind, patriotic town wants him to be.  Carrey is surprisingly good in this  role; it's nothing like his usual slapstick comedy, and he carries off the role  of reluctant hero quite well.&nbsp; His supporting cast is equally good ( David Ogden Stiers , interestingly  enough, plays a  doctor  once  more).&nbsp; Carrey's scene before the House Un-American Activities Commission  is especially good, and shows a depth of acting not usual for  Carrey.  Brings up the subject of  McCarthy , and the idea of "un-American"  activities.&nbsp; Amazing that the United States, for all our  lofty  ideals , prosecuted people and held a witch-hunt for having ideas that were  contrary to the government.&nbsp; We don't always have the prettiest history,  and  discrimination/persecution  are a lot more prevalent in our history  than one would like to think (in  fact, there&nbsp;are rumblings of  government mandated persecution in even  this enlightened age ).&nbsp; I'd certainly hope something like this  amendment would never pass; tolerance, respect for diversity, and equality are  what we need, not laws that by their very nature discriminate.&nbsp; The  anti-gay marriage hysteria is no different, really, from the Communist hysteria  of the 40's and 50's.&nbsp;  Keep the government  out of people's private lives , or the next witch-hunt may well be against  you.

      I just got off my lazy ass and started exercising...oh, I did a few walks and such, but this evening I used our treadmill for the first time.  I am sadly out of shape (didn't think someone could get out of shape in the Navy...well, surprise!).  I did 27 minutes, alternating between a jog and a fast walk...and was sweating my ass off the whole time.  

But I've got to get some weight off, and I'm not supposed to do heavy physical exercise until my blood pressure is under control (it's averaging 150/98, and lately has been higher)...the only "safe" option is the treadmill, I guess (the doc told me to exercise "at my own pace", but I can see I need to pick my pace up a bit).  

At any rate, having the mp3 player is a bonus...jogging to "Anchors Aweigh" (don't laugh) or bagpipe marches is better than just running around Pearl Harbor with a bunch of other squids.  And I can keep hydrated (if I don't drink a lot when I jog I get a really bad ache in my right side, a "stitch" I think they call it).  

I'll just be glad to lose some  weight!

         I have to say I thought  this  article from the Houston Chronicle  was good.&nbsp; I may not agree with the  motivations that put us in this war, but now that we are in it we need to not  repeat the mistakes of Vietnam; if this article is accurate we seem to be moving  in the right direction.&nbsp; I am impressed by the writer of this piece, it was  really well done.  I do believe we need to more clearly define our exit  strategy, however.&nbsp; And I don't agree with a couple of aspects of the  article...particurlary the part about the UN.&nbsp; We haven't engaged the UN  and the world community as well as we should, mainly because we alienated many  of our allies with our American arrogance in the beginning.&nbsp; And I still  think invading Iraq on our own was wrong, as is the "preemptive strike"  policy.&nbsp; But that is another discussion and I  have a movie to  watch.

      Read  this article  (it  was originally in the  New York Times , but their  site seems to be down at the moment, and requires a login anyway).  Really  read the following excerpts carefully:

"The  authorized tactics are primarily those methods used in the training of American  Special Operations soldiers to prepare them for the possibility of being  captured and taken prisoners of war. The tactics simulate torture, but officials  say they are supposed to stop short of serious injury.

Counterrorism officials say detainees have also  been sent to third countries, where they are convinced that they might be  executed, or tricked into believing they were being sent to such places. Some  have been hooded, roughed up, soaked with water and deprived of food, light and  medications.

In the case of  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a high-level detainee who is believed to have helped  plan the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, C.I.A. interrogators used graduated levels  of force, including a technique known as "water boarding," in which a prisoner  is strapped down, forcibly pushed under water and made to believe he might  drown."

"Simulate  torture"  Sounds like it's real torture to me.

Now, I'm no big  fan of terrorists, and I certainly have no love for someone like  Khalid Shaikh  Mohammed , but the  above  actions sound a lot like torture to me .  Not  in  the league of what others do to our people , true, but torture all the  same.  Makes the US seem a little less above the  sort of people we are trying  to defeat , doesn't  it?

         I'm going to be a peace activist  someday...except I do acknowledge that war is sometimes necessary.&nbsp; But the  world is too violent, way too violent...I don't have the answer (and I do see  the irony of my position, being in the military) but something needs to be  done.&nbsp; Or we are going to exterminate ourselves.      &nbsp;    And as to being military and anti-war...why  is that so hard to believe?&nbsp; Not "anti-war" to the extent that one says  "use of military force is never justified under any reason" but being against  war unless it is absolutely necessary.&nbsp; A good letter to the editor at  Navy Times  sums up my feelings on it (thanks  for expressing it so well, LT Rough).&nbsp; I can't link to it, as Navy Times is  only by paid subscription, but here's a reprint (the letter is from the 17 May  2004 edition):      &nbsp;       "   In response to the letter from Army  1st Lt. Matthew Shifrin in the April 26 edition of Navy Times ["Protests are  wrong"], I am profoundly disappointed that a fellow junior officer's perceptions  are so utterly uninformed and immature.   First Lt. Shifrin says he is disturbed by the mother who held a sign saying,  "You killed my son." He adds that "these people" fail to realize the  fundamentals of the war on terror and are disgracing the memory of fallen  soldiers by pushing "their liberal agendas."   Shame on him for even presuming to think that he knows more than the mother  who lost her son and that his version of the war is the only version. Does he  not even consider that perhaps this mother did not have a so-called liberal  agenda until her son died? In my opinion, that mother could teach him a thing or  two about being an officer and a gentleman.   According to him, presumably anyone who is interested in peace and executing  his constitutionally protected right to protest is somehow pushing a liberal  agenda. In reality, however, it is the military, more than any other group, that  must embrace peace. Soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines have the most to lose  in war, and we, as officers, must realize that as a fundamental part of our  basic military philosophy.   First Lt. Shifrin shows a complete lack of respect for people who do not  think as he does, and that is the worst failing of an officer. Embracing peace  does not equate to a lack of patriotism. Hopefully, his misunderstanding is a  result of his presumed youth and as he matures he will develop a better  understanding of what exactly he fights for.   Lt. J. A. Rough, UNSR   Alexandria, Va.

         While I'm not usually one for the light,  sensitive "feel good" stuff, the philosophy in  Robert  Fulghum's book "All I Really Need To Know" &nbsp;could keep us (people,  nations, mankind in general) out of a lot of trouble.&nbsp;  For  example :        &nbsp;    Share everything.  Play fair.  Don't  hit people.  Put things back where you found them.  Clean up your own  mess.  Don't take things that aren't yours.  Say sorry when you hurt  somebody.        &nbsp;    Simplistic, yes...but if everyone followed  these, well, wouldn't things be a bit nicer out there?        &nbsp;    So much for idealism and  utopia...

         Here is a  Washington  Post article &nbsp;on Major General Taguba's testimony before the  Senate.&nbsp; Here is an excerpt that calls back to mind the prisoners in  Guantanamo (and their complete deprivation of rights, even under the Geneva  Conventions):      &nbsp;    "Appearing with Cambone and Taguba, Lt. Gen.  Lance Smith, the deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, testified that Miller  had given brigade commanders in Iraq a list of the coercive measures used in  interrogations at Guantanamo Bay.  But Smith added that Miller had made clear to the commanders that "many" of  the measures could not be used in Iraq because of the Geneva Conventions. Miller  took over last month as commander of all detention facilities in Iraq. "     The Miller in question is Major General  Geoffrey D. Miller,&nbsp;formerly the commander of the detention facility at  Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

         Apparently several members of Congress were  alerted to the Iraqi prison scandal as early as February (Sen. Dan Akaka, D-HI,  being one of them), and ignored it.&nbsp; A local (and reputable) radio morning  show (Perry and Price on KSSK) were discussing it this morning.&nbsp; Some  parents of solders over there who had been told of it by their sons and  daughters (who were apparently sickened by the abuses) wrote to about 16 members  of Congress (4 of whom are on the Senate Armed Services Committee), but of  course, in true government fashion, these letters from constituents were  ignored...as was the scandal until it broke on the Internet.      &nbsp;    That isn't entirely fair...Major General  Taguba did a seemingly excellent job in investigating the issue and his remarks  before the Senate Armed Services Committee were right on target and brutally  honest.&nbsp; Failure in leadership.&nbsp; My earlier comment about the leaders  being held as accountable as the perpetrators stands; as my wife said, history  shows you cannot build a good army without discipline, training and leadership,  and as Major General Taguba pointed out all three were lacking in this  situation.

         I haven't seen (nor do I want to see,  really) the video of Nick Berg's beheading (purportedly by Abu Musab  al-Zarqawi).&nbsp; The pictures and description were chilling enough.&nbsp; And  of course there is now the scramble to lay blame/say he was warned/spin the  story for maximum effect...whatever.&nbsp; No one deserves to be executed like  that, regardless of the circumstances.&nbsp; Their motives have been debated  already (was it in retaliation for Abu Ghraib, or did they just use that as a  convenient reason, etc.), but does the motive, whatever it may have been, excuse  or explain it?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Sorry, it does not.&nbsp; The Abu Ghraib issue  still stands, but Berg's beheading does put one thing in perspective...our  treatment of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib, while horrid and completely  dishonorable and sickening, is on a completely different level than the  brutality of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his ilk.      &nbsp;    I still say that the guilty parties of Abu  Ghraib should be punished; the treatment of those prisoners is one of the worst  acts our military has ever committed.&nbsp; And their leadership needs to be  held to task for it, too; it won't do to just string up a few privates and low  ranking NCO's, the big question is where were the sergeants and officers?&nbsp;  There is no place in human society for that sort of behavior.&nbsp; Likewise for Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.

         I would like to make a disclaimer, by the  way, about this blog.&nbsp; I'm sure, since my views don't coincide with most in  the military, that I'll offend and/or alienate some of my colleagues.&nbsp; Too  bad; these are my opinions, my views on things, and you are certainly free to  disagree...heck, I'll welcome intelligent discussion on them.&nbsp; But if you  get offended or don't want to have anything further to do with me, it's your  loss.&nbsp; I leave it up to you; personally, I prefer the intelligent, spirited  (but civil) debate (and I can and will try to see and respect your point of  view), but if you want to "disown" me it's your choice.      &nbsp;    I say this because I've encountered it in  one or two instances; some in the military cannot fathom how I'm not in favor of  the Iraq war and think it's traitorous and un-American.&nbsp; Funny, I thought  having an opinion and expressing it were two very American things.&nbsp; And  then there are those who think being against the war means I'm against the  troops; nothing could be further from the truth (I was on the sub that started  the war, by launching the first missile strike...wouldn't being against the  troops in a strange way make me against myself?).&nbsp; I am neither  anti-America or anti-serviceman, and though I may&nbsp;disagree with the  administrations actions in Iraq I don't blame the troops; they are doing their  job, and in most cases with the highest honor and in the worst of  conditions.&nbsp; I have nothing but admiration for them (with the notable  exception of those who are committing abuses/atrocities...and I do believe they  are the exception rather than the rule, and they dishonor us all).&nbsp; I may  hate the war, but not the warriors.

James Inhofe,&nbsp;a Republican member of the Senate Armed  Services Committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically what he had to say about the Iraqi  prisoner abuse was&nbsp;they (the Iraqi prisoners) killed Americans...so it's no  more than they deserve.&nbsp; Nice guy, isn't he.&nbsp; Seems to forget the  concept of "innocent until proven guilty" (though he'd probably point out that  the Constitution doesn't apply to them...the administration has made a clear  effort to ensure those we detain in the war on terror get no due process).&nbsp;  Too bad Sen. Inhofe isn't in my state, I'd surely vote against  him.

Then there is always "Buddy Christ" (from "Dogma").  I think they are hilarious!  There is a 10 Commandments belt, leather verse bracelets, "JC State" workout shirts...I'm sure the conservative religious types will scream blashpemy, but apparently the stars even like it.  Then there is the Church of Buddy Christ (don't believe me...Google it...)

          Well, this is  great...I've got 4 bookcases and a desk (for Kinsey) to put together  today.&nbsp; Let Jane get near&nbsp;a furniture store...         &nbsp;     We do need the  bookcases, though.&nbsp; I told Jane that she didn't miss much, not getting to  the Morgan Library in NYC...she's got it here.&nbsp; Her response was that she  didn't have a Guttenburg Bible; I think that is about all that's missing.&nbsp;  We've got a ton of books.         &nbsp;     Surprisingly, I got  a call from one of the doctors I used to work for at NSSC Pearl Harbor...I  loaned him&nbsp;a&nbsp;book, "Blind Man's Bluff", and he called to return it (he  is apparently transferring).&nbsp; Nice of him to call, most people don't return  stuff these days (which reminds me, I have a book to return as  well...)         &nbsp;     Sent off Jane's MP3  player...one of the buttons didn't work.&nbsp; Seems about 1/3 of everything we  buy these days has to be returned/repaired in short order.&nbsp; Quality just  isn't what it used to be.&nbsp; I was going to have to do the same thing with my  diving camera, but it started working again (thankfully)...should have some  pictures from the last dive here shortly.         &nbsp;     Need to check on an  underwater housing for my digital camera, in fact...once the furniture is  done.

      Went diving today...finally, a Sea Lancers club dive that didn't get
canceled.  Two dives off a boat (and for the first time in my life I
got seasick...a lot).  First dive I had a lot of trouble with my mask
flooding (again!!), but got some good (hopefully) photos, a couple of
turtles and a squid that my buddy held for the photo op.  Second dive
I got seperated from the others since I got in later (seasick again),
but had no mask problems and finally go the hang of all my new
gear...though I didn't see much the dive went well, and I felt more
comfortable with my gear than ever.
 
 
I also finally got enough dives in with club members to finish off my
provisional status...I'm now a full Sea Lancers member.

      Well...now I've got some time (since I've caught up on my sleep and we've unpacked/settled back in at home)...so I'll post about the New York trip.
 
 
We had a great time, especially visiting family.  They live in an area of Queens known as Bayside...for those unfamiliar with how New York City is arranged, there are five boroughs (Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, The Bronx, and Staten Island), and each borough is further divided into numerous neighborhoods (whose names are actually your mailing address, except that Manhattan is "New York City").  Bayside is a nice neighborhood, not too crowded and very pleasant.
 
 
We went sightseeing in Manhattan a couple of times, once to the Museum of Natural History and a short trip through Central Park, once to the USS Intrepid Museum (a WWII era carrier), and I went alone once to the Empire State Building, Ground Zero and the Statue of Liberty/Battery Park area.
 
 
Manhattan is an amazing area.  Supported by solid bedrock, the small (about 11 mile by 2 mile) island hosts a large number of skyscrapers, including New York's tallest building, the Empire State Building (once the tallest building in the world, now with the demise of the World Trade Center Twin Towers it's the third, behind Malaysia and the Sears Tower in Chicago).  There is also the elegant Chrysler Building, Trump Tower, the relatively short (20 story) but uniquely triangular Flatiron Building, the distinctive Met Life Building, and the myriad of skyscrapers in the financial district in Lower Manhattan (better known as Wall Street).  The skyline is impressive (as you can see in some of the digital photos I posted), and will be even more so with the addition of the Freedom Tower, being built on the site of the World Trade Center Twin Towers...New York will once again have the tallest building in the world, as it is planned at around 1500+ feet.
 
 
Manhattan is a different world...few personal cars (parking is virtually nonexistent, and very expensive where it does exist), massive crowds, the occasional celebrity (I saw Joan Cusak in Lower Manhattan, on Wall Street), street vendors and entertainers, hot dog stands everywhere, the famous New York pizza...as the audio tour said at the Empire State Building, you can live in Manhattan and never leave the island.  There are dozens of churches, thousands of restaurants, hundreds of theaters, and of course Broadway and Times Square.  Central Park is massive, and there are several smaller parks, as well as many very sharply defined neighborhoods like SoHo, Harlem, Little Italy, Chelsea and others.  There are also several libraries and a ton of museums.  The Natural History Museum was especially good, and we only scratched the surface.  They were hosting the Petra exhibit, from an ancient city in Jordan (the artifacts were on loan from Queen Noor of Jordan).  It was the city used as the set for the location of the Holy Grail in the ending of "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade".
 
 
We also visited the Bronx Zoo, one of the larger zoos in the US.  Though it was a lot of walking, the zoo had an outstanding exhibit of gorillas, camel rides, nocturnal creatures like cloud rats, and several big cats.  Again, in one day we barely scratched the surface, but the Bronx Zoo is a must for those who visit the Big Apple.
 
 
We spent a weekend in Salem, MA, the site of the infamous 1692 witch trials.  There are many witch museums and exhibits, an old graveyard, a pirate museum and a nighttime walking tour of haunted and historically noteworthy sites that was especially good.  We stayed at the Salem Inn, a hotel made up of three old colonial houses that was very nice; you get a suite with a full kitchen and living room, as well as a common sitting room and complementary continental breakfast.  If you visit Salem, I strongly suggest you stay at the Salem Inn.
 
 
We spent several days at their apartment, just visiting.  Jane did crafts, Kinsey tormented their cats, and all in all we had a great time.  Glad it was summer, as I wouldn't want to be up that far north in the winter (brrr!).
 
 
All in all...a great vacation.  Good to be back home, though...

       urlLink    Perhaps the most gruesome of the Salem witch executions was that of Giles Corey.  Corey refused to enter a plea to the charge of being a "wizzard" (as male witches were called); he knew under the law that if he entered no plea the state could not take his land, and his family would inherit it.  However, "standing mute" carried a price, one never before used in the colonies...death by "pressing".  Corey, at 80 years of age, was stripped, placed on a board in a hollowed out area of ground, had another board placed on top of him, and had stones placed atop the upper board until he either plead his guilt or innocence.  He did neither...instead, his only words throughout the ordeal were "more weight"...and a curse on Salem and the high sherrif.

      Hi, there...we are in New York City (Queens, to be precise).  Jane, Kinsey and I are, as previously mentioned, visiting family.  We've been here since last Tuesday, and we just got back from a weekend in Salem, MA.  We toured nearly every museum in the city, it seems, and got quite the education on the 1692 Salem Witch Trials.  You know, the one where 19 people were executed (18 by hanging, one by "pressing"...loading more and more weight on his chest until he died), all for spurious accusations of witchcraft.  Not one of the better moments in our history (and erriely like the McCarthy "Witch Trials" of the 1950's).

Well, off to sorting packages and unpacking from the trip.  Tomorrow it's off to Manhattan for more sightseeing.

Navy officials said that during a port visit in Ecuador last month, Hall spent a night off the ship during the liberty call, which was a violation of Navy rules. 
 
 
Feb. 28, 2004: Cmdr. George Bonsall, commanding officer of the Norfolk-based guided-missile destroyer Stout, was given nonjudicial punishment for personal misconduct during a liberty visit in Mobile, Ala., and was relieved for loss of confidence. 
 
 
I'm still researching from 28 February to current.  But the above list is pretty long in and of itself, isn't it?

      (Being in the US sub force, and knowing how thin we are often
stretched, I'd say this is either a no-brainer or we need to get rid
of some of the flaming nukeism and be smarter about how we employ our
boats; we could do it with less, but there would be a sacrifice in
missions (cut out the less necessary ones), local operations, and
maintenance time.)

By Dave Ahearn
 
 
The Navy needs a fleet of 55 submarines, regardless of some analysts
who suggest that as few as 33 boats can do the job, Rear Adm. Joseph
Walsh, director of submarine warfare, said yesterday.
 
 
"All studies show that we need 55 submarines," Walsh said in an interview.
 
 
That does not mean that he and other Navy policy makers have a closed
mind on the subject, he said.
 
 
"We are always looking at other alternatives," he said.
 
 
That referred to arguments by some critics who suggest that some
missions proposed for submarines might just as well be executed by:
 
 
*Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,
 
*Surface ships, such as the future DD(X) destroyer and Littoral Combat
Ship (LCS),
 
*Manned aircraft from carriers, as well as land-based Navy and Air
Force planes, or
 
*Space-based assets such as signals-intelligence gathering satellites.
 
 
Critics also say submarines, because they are at sea level when
gathering intelligence, may miss some low-powered enemy communications
in near-shore areas. But Walsh noted that submarines can deploy
unmanned aerial vehicles or other assets to gather signals from a high
altitude. Walsh said a submarine lurking in littoral waters could also
receive data from spy aircraft working in or near enemy airspace.
 
 
Walsh said a full study of all the factors shows that there are
requirements for a robust undersea force.
 
 
"We do need a base of about 55 ships," he said.
 
 
He stressed that he is not downplaying the importance of the DD(X),
LCS, aerial, space and other assets.
 
 
"You need all of those systems" to meet all of the demands of
combatant commanders, he said.
 
 
Not Either-Or
 
 
Rather than looking at submarines versus other platforms, he said that
military strategists instead see them all as needed members of a
single team.
 
 
"It is not either-or," Walsh said.
 
 
And in that analysis, Walsh stressed that there are some missions and
functions that only can be fulfilled by submarines.
 
 
First, they can slip close to enemy shores without being noticed, he said.
 
 
"We can operate in denied areas," he said.
 
 
As well, submarines possess an endurance that no other platform can
provide in coastal enemy waters, since the nuclear-powered vessels can
remain hidden and on station 24/7.
 
 
"We have long-dwell time," Walsh said.
 
 
Further, when a submarine gathers intelligence that a target of
opportunity has presented itself, it is in a position to do something
about it, such as strike it with a cruise missile, he said.
 
 
Too Many UUVs
 
 
On another topic, he also said the Navy may have to reduce the number
of its unmanned underwater vehicle program (UUV).
 
 
"We rally today cannot afford three different UUV programs," he said,
without specifying which might be eliminated.
 
 
Speaking before the Naval Submarine League earlier, Walsh said it is
crucial for contractors to develop a means for submarines to
communicate continuously with ships, planes and land-based units, even
while the boats are moving at speed submerged.
 
 
One answer has been buoys that a submarine can deploy on a cable
tether that rises to the service to provide radio transmission
capabilities.
 
 
However, "buoys are probably an interim step" because each one
provides communications capability only for a matter of minutes, he
said.
 
 
The ultimate answer, he said, might be "perhaps a grid of sensors at
the bottom of the ocean" in key areas of likely combat, or perhaps
some technology that would transform acoustic signals underwater into
radio signals above water.

          (And another CO will  lose his job...what is that, 10 or 11 already this year?)    Norfolk Virginian-Pilot June 10, 2004     A U.S. Navy destroyer and a British frigate bumped into each other  Wednesday morning off the coast of North and South Carolina, causing "light  damage" during an attempt to transfer sailors from one warship to the other.   No one was injured and both ships continued with their participation in a  joint exercise.   The destroyer Carney , based in Mayport, Fla., and the British frigate  Sutherland were operating about 60 miles off the coast. They are part of a  massive multinational exercise involving 28,000 U.S. and allied service  members.   Cmdr. Dave Werner of the U.S. Navy's 2nd Fleet based in Norfolk said that the  accident occurred about 7:30 a.m. when the rear sections of each ship collided  at slow speed. The bump caused only minor damage near the flight deck of each  ship, Werner said.   The accident occurred while sailors were being shuttled in small boats  between the ships. The collision remains under investigation, Werner  said.

          &nbsp;   London Financial Times June 9, 2004        By Nathan Hodge   When Colonel Douglas Macgregor of the US army was preparing to submit his  latest manuscript, he struck a deal with his superiors: he could publish his  book - a detailed critique of the way the army equips, organises and fights - if  he kept his views on the war in Iraq to himself.   "I could talk about the content of the book and anything that happened up to  the end of the initial operation to (take) Baghdad, and nothing else," he says.  "That was the condition for publication of the book and I agreed to that."   Some in the army leadership might have preferred that his book had never been  published.   Col Macgregor, one of the most prominent uniformed advocates of US military  reform, retired last week and is now criticising a "sycophantic" army culture  that he blames for failures in Iraq and wasteful investments in new  technology.   "I love the army and I was sorry to leave it," Col Macgregor says. "But I saw  no possibility of fundamentally positive reform and reorganisation of the force  for the current strategic environment or the future."

            Los Angeles Times June 9, 2004  Pg.  1          By Richard A. Serrano, Times Staff Writer     WASHINGTON - After American Taliban recruit John Walker  Lindh was captured in Afghanistan, the office of Defense Secretary Donald H.  Rumsfeld instructed military intelligence officers to "take the gloves off" in  interrogating him.     The instructions from Rumsfeld's legal counsel in late  2001, contained in previously undisclosed government documents, are the earliest  known evidence that the Bush administration was willing to test the limits of  how far it could go legally to extract information from suspected  terrorists.     The Pentagon and Congress are now investigating the  mistreatment of inmates at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in late 2003 and trying to  determine whether higher-ups in the military chain of command had created a  climate that fostered prisoner abuse.

      I looked back and realized I'd been giving President Reagan a bit of a hard time. While his administration may not have been in my mind the best around, I will give him credit for his deep love of America, his inspiring "command style", and for restoring patriotism and morale to a nation whose spirits were, to put it mildly, down in the dumps. 
 
 
I was a child during the 70's, and a teen in the 80's. My memories of the 70's were of a nation where patriotism only existed among the older generations (like my grandparents). The 60's and 70's, and mainly the Vietnam era, divided the nation and sent our national self-esteem into the cellar. While I have no doubt as to the loyalty of the nation's leaders during those decades, the effect of their administrations (chiefly in the Vietnam conflict, the Watergate scandal, and the energy crisis of the late 70's) brought the nation down. 
 
 
Ronald Reagan changed that...for the better. His economics and the drive to (in my mind unnecessarily) win the Cold War and stop the overrated Communist threat may have had a drastic impact on the economy and national debt, but he did make Americans feel good about American again. He has been praised by both his own party and his opponents for being fair, gracious, and tough without being inflexible. 
 
 
The high esteem he is held in shows in those who are honoring him by attending his funeral; Margaret Thacher, Mikhail Gorbachev, former President Jimmy Carter (his opponent in the 1979 election), former President Bill Clinton (who defeated Reagan's Vice President, George H. W. Bush, in 1992), and various supporters and opponents from all parties. In parting I'll say this; though I may have disagreed with his policies, I can still say I had immense respect for the man and how he truly believed in and led from an ideal of a strong, proud nation. 
 
 
Rest in peace, President Reagan.

      I suppose the administration will really be ashamed of  urlLink this
little tidbit .  The administration had lawyers looking for
loopholes to allow the use of  torture  and consider it legal.

"The report outlined U.S. laws and international treaties forbidding
torture, and why those restrictions might be overcome by
national-security considerations or legal technicalities."

Fun, eh?  Who looks like a terrorist now?

"The president, despite domestic and international laws constraining
the use of torture, has the authority as commander in chief to approve
almost any physical or psychological actions during interrogation, up
to and including torture, the report argued."

Laws, treaties (like the Geneva Conventions), and rules aren't really
worth the paper they are printed on if, when they become inconvenient,
you ignore them or find technicalities to get around them.  Civilized
people/nations live by laws and rules.  We (being the US) come off as
a bunch of hypocrites when we invade Iraq to uphold a law (being the
UN resolution on WMD's that we so fervently believed they were
breaking) and then turn around and weasel our way out of a law (Geneva
Conventions) to make it OK for our people to torture prisoners.  Think
of the message that sends...it's OK to flaunt the rules when you are
the big, bad US of A, but not when you are just puny little Iraq.

Someday a politician with actual morals, standards and a sense of what
is right and wrong will be elected president.  You'll know...the earth
will stand still if it ever happens.

          As I said before,  former President Ronald Reagan  had  his detractors .&nbsp; While an inspirational, commanding presence in the  Oval Office, history shows (to the unbiased eye) a president with many parallels  to our current leader; simplistic views, a lack of familiarity or concern with  details, an "us or them" mentality, and a knack for turning the tide of  attention from his mistakes to other (and often less important)  issues.         &nbsp;     Ronald Reagan is  undoubtedly one of the most popular presidents to hold the office.&nbsp; But did  this popularity stem from genuine ability and talent in the job, or  appearances?&nbsp; The jury is still out on that in my mind; however, having  long been a Reagan admirer it's now at his death that I finally come face to  face with his shortcomings and failings.&nbsp; (I suppose the fact that I'm  giving it any thought at all is somewhat of a testament to his  influence.)         &nbsp;     At any rate, Ronald  Reagan left quite a mark on history.&nbsp; It remains to be seen just how that  mark will be read.

          Guess everyone  knows by now that former President Ronald Reagan has died at age 93.&nbsp;  President for the bulk of the 1980's, he was one of the more popular presidents  and is often credited with ending the Cold War.         &nbsp;     However, as with  most statesmen and famous public figures, there is always another side to the  story.&nbsp;  He  is also credited with a massive portion of the national debt, due to tremendous  defense spending for the arms race with the former Soviet Union; for the US  losing ground in civil rights; the Iran-Contra scandal; the late 80's stock  market crash and resulting recession.          &nbsp;     But he had an aura  of invincibility, especially after a brush with death in a failed assassination  attempt shortly after taking office.&nbsp; Called the "Great Communicator" he  held tremendous&nbsp;popularity and was a great motivator, often using  campaign-style slogans like "Star Wars", "Just Say No", and "Evil Empire".&nbsp;   He  built up the military to it's largest post-WWII size, jump started a sagging  economy, and won the highest approval ratings of a departing president since  Franklin D. Roosevelt.          &nbsp;     He is more recently  remembered for  bringing  increased awareness to Alzheimer's disease .&nbsp; In a  1994 letter to  the American people , Reagan told of his affliction, and his wife Nancy has  led the fight to find effective treatments ever since.&nbsp; Partly due to his  admission,  Alzheimer's  research has made significant progress in the last 10  years .         &nbsp;     Reagan survived a  1981 assassination attempt, which many say  broke the Curse of  Tecumsah .&nbsp; He weathered the Cold War, brought us Reaganomics, renewed  patriotism, the Iran-Contra scandal, " Star  Wars ", and set the tone of the 1980's.

          Whew!&nbsp;  Yesterday I was pretty busy.&nbsp; First was the  Sea Lancers  picnic/club dive-treasure hunt  on the&nbsp;North Shore&nbsp;(of course the club dive got called  off...again...like every one I've been a member for).&nbsp; Then, after winning  a new gear bag from the door prizes, a group of us went over to the west shore  near  Nanakuli  to  dive.&nbsp; We had a good dive there; unfortunately the turtles showed up after  I ran out of film in my camera.&nbsp; Then after getting home we went to see  Shrek 2  again (Jane went this  time), preceded by dinner at&nbsp; Banditos .&nbsp;  In one day&nbsp;(on Oahu) I put about 120 miles on my  car.

          Just stumbled  on this site ...a way to send  messages to the troops abroad.&nbsp; Agreement or disagreement with the war  aside, I can tell you first hand that getting these messages when deployed is a  real morale booster...and, as I've always believed, supporting&nbsp;our troops  is not connected to supporting a war.&nbsp; These soldiers are doing the  toughest job one can imagine, under conditions that are to most of us  unimaginable; and they are doing it with honor and the finest traditions of the  US Armed Forces.&nbsp; So take a second, push the prison scandals and politics  aside, and send a message to our men and women over there that regardless of the  reasons they are there that we support them.

      While I may not be a member of/follow the teachings of a church, it
seems to me we sometimes carry our freedom  from  religion too
far.  As in the case of a church group that  used
a river in a public park for baptisms.   They weren't disturbing
anyone...they weren't forcing their views on anyone...they were
minding their own business and using a public area to do something
that is in no way illegal.  For this the park officials kicked them
out, applying some lame excuse about a permit.

A little too PC, I would have to say.  More like just plain stupid.

      Sadly, the US House of Representatives passed HR 3313, the "Marriage Protection Act", which  urlLink essentially prevents Federal courts (including the US Supreme Court) from being able to review challenges to the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).   While it will likely die in the US Senate (and itself is likely unconstitutional...remember that whole checks-and-balances thing??), it serves to show how the GOP has taken the issue of same-sex marriage and made it a huge political agenda item.  Thankfully they did not pass the proposed Marriage Amendment, but Republican lawmakers seem bent on forcing everyone to play by their sense of morality, and in the process discriminate against (and block the due legal process of) a group of Americans.

However, some in Congress have brains.  I sent an email via the  urlLink Human Rights Campaign  that got misdirected due to my address in the preferences...it went not to  urlLink Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-FL 6th District)  but to  urlLink Rep. Neil Abercrombie (D-HI 1st District) , since I live in Hawaii (I'm still a Florida resident, military absentee).  Congressman Abercrombie replied, backing up his vote against the resolution by saying:

  "I voted against the passage of HR3313 because this measure would undermine one of the bedrock principles of constitutional government by eliminating the possibility of constitutional review...If the 50 states supreme courts came up with 50 different decisions, the Marriage Protection Act would render the Supreme Court powerless to protect the United States Constitution from misinterpretation.  Moreover, HR 3313 itself would probably be found to be unconstitutional, because it contravenes the separation of powers between the branches of government.  Regarless of how you feel about same-sex marriage, anyone who cares about the integrity of our legal system should have grave concerns about this bill."  

Good one, Neil.  Wish I voted in Hawaii, you'd have my vote (for the record, Rep. Abercrombie's overall record is one I generally find to my agreement.)

Congressman Stearns voted for the resolution.  His votes are generally contrary to my views, and I have voted against him in every election his name appears on (he has always been unopposed, so I vote a write-in.)  His words on HR 3313 were:

  "Marriage, the union of one man and one woman, is deeply imbedded in our religious, economic, and legal institutions.  Marriage is also the central structure supporting the family, which is the building block of our society. To undermine marriage is to weaken the family and our society."  

Hopefully this bill dies it's predicted death in the Senate.  And with it I hope the terms of anyone voting in favor of this resolution die as well...a return to Democrat control and common sense, and an end to discrimination in our Congress is sorely needed.

         The  Army Inspector General's report on military detention operations  urlLink claims there is no "systemic'' problem with abuse in the Army's detention system ...this gets the brass off the hook.  No "systemic" problem means no need to probe further up the chain of command than the few "bad apples" who are out doing this stuff solo.    
    
  Yet two things shoot holes in this argument.    
    
  One is the sheer number of abuses; outside of Abu Ghraib the five month inquiry found 94 instances of alleged abuse and 20 prisoner deaths.  Not "systemic", though.  
    
   Second, anyone who has served time in any military or quasi-military unit (like police forces) will tell you that orders aren't the only thing that are followed by the men on the deckplates.  The climate, the tone a commander sets will carry forward to the troops.  It's shown in inspection results aboard ship in the Navy...  urlLink  lax standards make for poor performance on "game day"   .    urlLink  Records cover-ups    and an air of "just get it done", no matter the cost, caused tragedy for the Marines with the V-22.  In these examples, poor command and leadership "tone" and the unwritten, unspoken messages came through to the troops loud and clear; I suspect the same is true in the Army.  These troops may not have been specifically ordered to do these things, but the implication was there.  The acceptance or "blind eye" was there.  The culture of it being okay was there.   
    
  But hey, that's not considered "systemic".

          The opinion expressed    here   &nbsp;is all the more powerful if you read  down to this paragraph:         &nbsp;     "One of the revelations in the  9/11 commission report was the casualness of the resort to war. On the afternoon  of Sept. 11, Donald Rumsfeld spoke of attacking Saddam Hussein, and President  Bush began asking about Iraq the next day. Older men blithely found a war for  younger men and women to die in."         &nbsp;     Yet,    as the  9/11 commission tells us   :         &nbsp;     "The commission has said it has  seen no evidence to suggest that then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government  was involved in the attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people.    In a report released last month, the commission concluded that  though there were numerous contacts in the 1990s between Iraq and al Qaeda,  those contacts  did not  result in a&nbsp; ' collaborative relationship.

      Remember the CPO results I linked to in a  urlLink previous post ?  Looks like that was an "oops"...the message was sent to admirals and unit CO's and CMC's first, not to be released to the general public until the CO's and CMC's could personally inform their selectees.  But a flag writer (secretary) for some admiral posted it on the  urlLink Internet .

Well, it was taken down for a while, but it's back up...however, they cut out the header (where the message information is) and in doing so really screwed up the formatting.  So I downloaded it, cleaned it up and  urlLink put it here for your viewing pleasure .

      It was bound to happen...a couple weds in Massachusetts (both men), one takes the name of the other.  Social Security has no problem with it, but the US Passport Agency does.  While same-sex marriage is legal in Massachusetts, the federal Defense of Marriage Act is what the Passport Agency cited.

      Much has been made lately of the "CO problem" in Navy times...of course, in true Navy fashion the brass at first denied any "problem".  It's gotten so bad, though, that the Vice CNO has ordered an investigation, and interestingly the CO of a ship that recently collided with a British warship has been  urlLink allowed to keep his command .

However, the CO of the USS JOHN F. KENNEDY may not be so luck.  The KENNEDY  urlLink collided  with a  urlLink dhow  in the Persian Gulf earlier today, and as you might imagine the dhow was destroyed.  No survivors were found...that will likely cost the CO and others on the carrier their jobs (the Navy is not so forgiving if your accident kills innocent civilians... urlLink remember the GREENEVILLE and CDR Scott Waddle?

      The US House of Representatives  urlLink passed a bill  that would prevent courts (including the Supreme Court) from reviewing same-sex marriage cases.  It would not allow courts to even consider challenges to the Defense of Marriage Act, and would further bar courts from allowing persons married in one state (that allows same sex marriage) from challenging the lack of recognition of that marriage in another state.  It would remove all of these judicial remedies all the way up to and including the US Supreme Court.
 
 
The issue has become a hot one, with Massachusetts now allowing same-sex marriage; per the  urlLink Constitution :
 
 
"Article IV
 
 
Section 1. Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof. 
 
 
Section 2. The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states."
 
 
However, many states wish to go against this and refuse to recognize same-sex marriages from Massachusetts.  The bill passed in the House today would shield states from any and all forms of judicial review in the matter (even taking away the power of the Supreme Court to rule on if a state's denial of marriage rights was Constitutional or not.)  
 
 
I have to agree with House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, who asked "What's next? No judicial review of laws that restrict freedom of speech or religion?"

          Well, I went to my  LIMDU 6 month evaluation, thinking that since my blood pressure had made pretty  significant downward progress I would be cleared for full duty...or at worst  kept on LIMDU two more months to monitor a little more.         &nbsp;     Well, no...the  "doctor" I'm seeing (a nurse practitioner, former Navy HM chief) once again  bitched me out about weight (no shit, Sherlock...but that isn't what is listed  as putting me on LIMDU), then, after a vague discussion about my career  intentions (which, I'll admit, have been indeterminate of late) he drops the  bombshell on me that he's likely going to forward a med board to BUMED...which  could likely recommend me being discharged.&nbsp; This guy thinks that will  improve my blood pressure?!?!?&nbsp; Yeah, that's what I need...a sudden end to  my income.&nbsp;          &nbsp;     I wasn't dying to  go back to sea, mind you...CHEYENNE burned me out, and in short order.&nbsp; But  regardless of my career plans, my enlistment goes out to 2007, and I fully  planned on finishing it (in fact, even my plans on leaving the Navy were based  in the next three years for preparation.)         &nbsp;     As to this  "doctor", he's got the "bedside manner" of a penitentiary guard.&nbsp; Sadly,  he's typical of a lot of chiefs (despite the fact that he's now a lieutenant  commander.)&nbsp; And he's about as holier-than-thou as they come.&nbsp; I've  dropped about 12-13 lbs. in the last couple of months (a 5 lb/mo drop is  recommended, from what I've read on several health sites), but he basically told  me today that the criteria for me to get off LIMDU/stay in the Navy is to be  below 200 lbs. in 2 months (starting at about 250 lbs. now.)&nbsp; You do the  math...between 5 and 7 lbs. a   week.&nbsp;             &nbsp;     So, I may well have  the choice made for me.&nbsp; And a large part of me says "good"...screw  'em.&nbsp; It's not like fitness was really taken seriously until really  recently in the Navy (despite what the brass would like you to think...the  talking heads with the fancy shoulder boards spout some good words, but they are  usually so far removed from reality it's not even funny.)&nbsp; Little secret  here...I was on CHEYENNE for 2 years, and never saw a PRT run (apparently there  was one while I was TAD to a two week school...no makeup that I know of...the  others were likely falsified, as was a lot of stuff on that boat that the  command had no time/concern for.)&nbsp; The few abortive attempts to have  anything resembling command PT were a joke.&nbsp; Like a lot of stuff, it was  shoved under a carpet.         &nbsp;     Now I admit, I let  myself get badly out of shape; in my defense, my life on the CHEYENNE didn't  help it much (what time I had away from that hole I just wanted to be left alone  during...had no energy, motivation or caring to do anything that even remotely  reminded me I was in the Navy.)&nbsp; My point really is, however, that it  isn't/wasn't my weight that put me on LIMDU...and before you think "high  weight=high BP", my blood pressure went up sharply with my weight being pretty  constant (within about 5 lbs.), so while it's a contributor...well, you get my  point.         &nbsp;     Anyway, in looking  at it I'm more and more coming to the thought that it wouldn't be a life-ending  ordeal...in fact, I wouldn't really mind all that much.&nbsp; I've been getting  sick of the Navy for a while...being out would be a good thing.&nbsp; There are  no more SRB's (since this enlistment took me past 16 years of commitment...no  SRB over 16 years), and sub life has gotten really crappy in the later '90's and  early '00's (again, there's that CHEYENNE name coming up.)&nbsp; I don't think  I'd miss it that much, and I'm going to pursue a job here at the  shipyard...federal, so I don't lose too much there, either.         &nbsp;     It's their  loss.

      Well, to follow on in the footsteps of  urlLink my post on places I've been , here's how they fall out in the UN Human Development Report...I've been to (overall countries only): 
&nbsp; 
 
 
Australia - #3 
 
United States - #8 
 
Japan - #9 
 
Singapore - #25 
 
Bahrain - #40 
 
United Arab Emirates - #49 
 
Cuba - #52 
 
Mexico - #53
  
Thailand - #76 
 
Saudi Arabia - #77
  
Dominican Republic - #98 
 
 
Now realize that I was only in Cuba for a day or two (and on the US Naval base at that), and in Saudi Arabia for a desert tour that originated in Bahrain (thus I saw little but sand).
 
But there you have it...I've been from #3 to #98.

            George W. Bush went to see the doctor to get the  results of his brain scan. The doctor said: "Mr. President, I have some bad news  for you. First, we have discovered that your brain has two sides: the left side  and the right side."     Bush interrupted, "Well, that's normal, isn't it? I  thought everybody had&nbsp;two sides to their brain?"     The doctor replied, "That's true, Mr. President. But  your brain is very unusual because on the left side there isn't anything right,  while on the right side there isn't anything  left."

         The failure in the Senate to pass the discriminatory Federal Marriage Amendment is  urlLink prompting states to raise efforts to amend their constitutions against gay marriage .&nbsp; One can only hope a case eventually gets to the US Supreme Court and they strike restrictions on marriage down as unconstitutional.

         I think something is a bit fishy here; a school that, for the first time in it's history,  urlLink will have a black valedictorian  decides to, at the last minute, count grades differently and inform the valedictorian he must share the honor with two other students (both white).&nbsp; Perception, if not reality, makes this one stink, but the real damage stems not just from this case.&nbsp; Read a little further down in the story and you see this:
 
  
&nbsp; 
"Around the country, some schools have done away with the tradition of naming a valedictorian amid lawsuits from students who believed they were unfairly denied the honor."
 
 
&nbsp; 
News flash...sometimes life isn't fair.&nbsp; Rather than sue, why not teach the kids that the honor (or title) means much less than the accomplishment of the high GPA? 
 
 
&nbsp; 
Our era of lawsuits is driving schools and other public institutions to do all manner of silly (and often sad) things, and getting rid of traditional graduation honors in fear of lawsuits is pretty sad, indeed.&nbsp; Just like the girl who was told she couldn't mention Jesus or her faith during her valedictory address (for fear of offending people).&nbsp; I'm all for separation of church and state, but if the girl's faith means as much to her as it apparently does, and she would like to share it during her valedictory, why not?&nbsp; It's not the school pushing religion. 
 
 
&nbsp; 
This case of the black valedictorian...the school only recalculated the grades after some parents complained.&nbsp; The policy on the cutoff date for grades counting for class standing wasn't new; I suspect someone out there complained not because of the policy or their kid not making the top spot, but because the one who did was black. 
 
 
&nbsp; 
"Traditionally, grades from the final three weeks of classes were not used to calculate grade point averages when choosing the valedictorian. But Peeling and school board officials this year decided to include the final three weeks and a college course grade." 
 
 
&nbsp; 
Hmmm...coincidence?&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably not, but I doubt I'd sue over it.&nbsp; Didn't see that the kid or his family planned to, but it was likely pressure from the other parents on behalf of their kids (and a dose of "my kid is better than that black kid") that prompted the policy change.&nbsp; I just hope the kid, Moreko Griggs, doesn't let it detract from his accomplishments.

      The Federal Marriage Amendment was shot down in the Senate today by a narrow margin.  The  urlLink actual vote  was 50 against, 48 for (with two, Sens. Kerry and Edwards, not voting...it's likely their votes would have made it 52-48).  
 
 
The motion, which was actually a motion to invoke  urlLink cloture  and consider the bill before the full Senate, needed a 3/5 vote (60 senators, roughly) to pass.  The  urlLink amendment itself  would require a 2/3 majority of both houses of Congress and 3/4 of the states to approve for it to become law.  Today's vote showed that it has nowhere close to that kind of support.

      I continually hear about how the military is universally Republican, that we all support a candidate like Bush, since he is so "pro military", and how the only ones of us who are on the left are the "gay lovers".
 
 
Well, don't believe it.
 
 
Sure, I like pay hikes and tax cuts as much as the next guy.  Better benefits help, too.  But there are several more factors in political leaning than those, and even those issues aren't black and white.
 
 
Remember the Clinton years?  You know, the ones that were so bad for the military?  The '90's saw the largest year after year hikes in military pay in decades, and I'll tell you from personal experience that a military family at E5 with a child can live quite well.  In Hawaii, no less.  How do I know?  I've done it.  We weren't rich, but we were far from living on food stamps.  I'm a nuke, so I do make more than the mainstream enlisted sailor, but that extra wasn't necessary for living...it went, more often than not, to luxury (big screen TV, scuba classes/equipment, new car, computers).
 
 
Those raises came in the Clinton administration, by the way.  Same one that balanced the budget.  No, they didn't do much tax cutting, but when you really look at it the current administration didn't cut taxes significantly (unless you make more than $200,000.)
 
 
Oh, the gay issue...I've personally served with people I knew were gay.  They were no different from any other sailor (in fact, most were stellar performers, but to be fair I did know one who was a mediocre performer...a cross-section representative of the Navy as a whole).  They caused no problems by their sexual orientation...it was never an issue (and it wasn't a big secret).  So those critical of the Democrats and Clinton for supporting gays are just being silly...they are no different than the rest of us.  I say worry about something important, like the woefully unbalanced budget.
 
 
Shall we discuss personal freedom and liberty?  Clinton had a record of furthering civil rights...the Bush administration's record speaks for itself.  To be fair, Bush had 9/11 to cope with...some tightening of freedoms was inevitable.  But things like the Patriot Act go way too far (even supporters of the original act now call for revision and trimming back.)
 
 
I'm going to see "Fahrenheit 9/11" this weekend, but I'm pretty sure I know how I feel already...from what I hear, I agree with the assessment.  The recent Senate report on the intelligence failures bear out what a lot of people are beginning to realize; Bush looked for any excuse, however thin, to go to war in Iraq, and the WMD issue gave him the excuse he needed.  In short he took us to war in Iraq for reasons (WMD's, Iraqi ties to al Qaida) that were nonexistent.
 
 
Bush has been bad for the military (just ask reservists and retirees about their benefits, and everyone about more deployments and combat for a worthless cause), bad for the economy (lost jobs, soaring deficits), bad for the people (lost freedoms and liberties, the erosion of hard won rights and the blocking of rights that harm no one for the sake of "morality"), and bad for the country (our reputation and presence in the world is at it's worst since Vietnam...likely worse than even that sad era).
 
 
Yet many in the military blindly follow along.  They ride behind the half-cocked cowboy because he fulfills a macho, arrogant role for them.  He's the ass-kicking gunslinger who becomes popular through simplistic, black-and-white philosophy that appeals mainly to extremists (like the religious right) and those who don't take the time to scratch the surface and see what is really going on.
 
 
Bush has set the attitude of this nation back by decades; those who favor discrimination are more willing to speak out now (witness the flood of negative sentiment against Muslims, disregarding that religious belief does not equal terrorism), the government is pushing a religious right morality more fervently than it has since the 1950's (gay marriage bans, in the form of an amendment), and Americans have in many quarters gone beyond the admirable traits of patriotism and pride in their nation to feeling we are superior to the rest of the world (the reaction to France and the UN speak volumes.)
 
 
There are many more indicators of the character of our President, but I think a recent example sums it up pretty well; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has invited the President to speak at their annual convention each year of his term in office.  He in fact addressed the NAACP at their convention when he was a candidate in 2000.  Since taking office, however, he has been too busy to appear.  This year he had a "schedule conflict"; in an election year his own code of values makes him the first President since the 1930's to snub the NAACP, and this likely cost him the vote of the black community.  Being invited to speak at their convention is a great honor, and in my mind there is only one reason he would refuse that honor; he considers himself too good to address an organization of a minority.
 
 
Says all that needs to be said, I think.
 
 
This all being said, this military member won't be supporting Bush.  And I'm not alone; I've spoke to many that no longer back him.  Many cite the same reasons above, mainly our loss of prestige in the world and the economy, as reasons why they no longer support him.  The military is not the conservative bastion it once was...younger, better informed people are in uniform, ones who question, who value what liberties we get to enjoy (many are circumscribed in the service), and who look to our lives outside the service, when we wish to fully enjoy the freedoms we are sworn to defend.  And many see those freedoms, that American dream, that ideal eroding under the current administration.
 
 
I sincerely hope more of my fellow service personnel look beyond the standard "military=Republican" myth and really vote for what is valuable; freedom, our place in a global community, the economy we are leaving to our kids, and the environment we are wrecking.  The wars we are getting in to for lies and the personal goals of one man.  The direction our nation is, sadly, going in, and what we need to do to put it back on the right track.

      (Editorial from the  urlLink Washington Post )

Considering the volume of work Congress has yet to do before members leave town, the Senate's insistence on considering a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is telling. Congress has failed to pass a budget resolution or any appropriations bills and remains deadlocked on such important public policy issues as corporate taxation and class-action reform. Yet today, the Senate will take up a  urlLink cloture  vote on the  urlLink Federal Marriage Amendment . Everyone knows that, in the Senate, the proposed amendment is well short of  the votes needed to send it on to the states; even making it to a vote on the merits is highly unlikely. The reason the Senate is moving forward is politics of a particularly crass and ugly sort: Gay marriage has become a national electoral issue. And Republicans believe it is one that can help President Bush, who has come out in favor of the amendment, and make life difficult for  urlLink Sen. John F. Kerry (D) , who not only opposes it but also hails from the very state -- Massachusetts -- whose highest court provoked the current showdown with a decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Precisely because of the weight conservatives have put on this issue, today's vote, despite its preordained outcome, has become  deeply important. It requires senators to take a public stand on a question of deep principle: Are they willing to warp the entire American constitutional structure to prevent people who love one another from marrying?
 
  
Notwithstanding all the talk of protecting the sanctity of marriage, that is what this vote is really about. Few issues historically have been more purely committed to state authority in this country's system than family law. Federal law already ensures that no state can be forced to recognize gay marriages performed in another, and the federal government withholds such recognition too. The point of a constitutional amendment is to override the judgments of those states that might choose to permit same-sex marriage. There is no good reason to do this. We support gay marriage, though we have criticized the Massachusetts high court's decision. And if voters object strongly to what their court has done,  the decision will not survive. Moreover, for all the hysterics of the proposal's supporters, the prospect of its being exported to other states against the will of their  residents seems remote. The Massachusetts decision, in other words, requires no federal response whatsoever -- let alone a grotesque rearrangement of the federal-state relationship.
 
  
The combination of this proposal's radicalism and its consideration in the middle of an election year commands a strong rebuke from those members who retain enough shame to oppose a constitutional amendment whose express purpose is to deny equal treatment to U.S. citizens. Even opponents of gay marriage, about which people of conscience legitimately disagree, should balk at this measure, which would prevent a democratic majority in any state ever from recognizing it. A strong vote against the Federal Marriage Amendment would send a powerful message that amending the Constitution is not a solution for every non-problem that  generates a bad cause.

I thought there were some questions on the test that should have a gray area, but the responses are simply "agree" and "disagree" (and a "strongly" in both categories)...they do it that way to keep people from riding the fence.  If you are curious, take the test (be honest).  Don't read the FAQ's first (they'll color your responses).  It's interesting afterward to see just where some notable figures fall on this scale.

          Did I mention we  were going to the Big Island?&nbsp; Well, guess not...but we are...rather, we  did.&nbsp; We are back.&nbsp; We spent the weekend (from Friday morning, August  6th to this afternoon there.)&nbsp; Kinsey had her 8th birthday there, we went  to the most southern bakery in the US (Punulu'u Bakery), the most southern  restaurant in the US ("Shaka's"), both in&nbsp;Na'alehu, the Volcano National  Park, the black sand beaches, and stayed at a nice old cottage in Pahala,  Hawaii.&nbsp; I'll post the pictures when they are  developed.

          President Bush    declared    his administration will "never stop  thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people."         &nbsp;     Or was it a    Freudian slip   ?

      Some big stars are hitting the road to tour in support of the Democratic Party.  As one link to this story said,  urlLink The Boss  is taking on  urlLink "the boss" .

      I get campaign letters from the Kerry campaign (signed up for them after donating); lately the focus has been defining the Kerry-Edwards stand on the various issues that confront the people of America. One that has languished on the back burner since the failure of Sen. (then First Lady) Hillary Clinton's health care reform plan is health care.
 
 
The above link doesn't give specifics on how the plan is to be accomplished...I doubt most Americans would understand the specifics, unless they have specialities in law or the insurance field. But the plan is a starting point toward what this nation really needs; universal health care. Bush, for his part, is more interested in  urlLink denying benefits for veterans/reservists  and  urlLink preventing gay couples from sharing health care benefits through marriage .
 
 
Kerry's most recent letter said it best concerning health care:

  "Health care should not be a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected. We are the wealthiest nation on earth. There is simply no excuse for hard-working Americans having to worry about whether they will be able to afford the treatment they need when they are sick.  "

       In contrast to Missouri (see my earlier post), Washington seems to have some sense...at least one judge there does. While it has to wait on the state's Supreme Court to review the case, same sex marriage is now   urlLink  technically legal in Washington   .

          Sadly, we just added another  state to the list of those who have  outright  discrimination in their state  Constitutions .

      We finally told Kinsey what her present is for her birthday (it's this Sunday, August 8th)...we are taking her to the Big Island of Hawaii.  Oh, she got a big stuffed lion (Leo...how original, eh?) with a note attached telling her about the trip.  Kinda like the wedding ring baked into the dessert...

       The military is good about ensuring it's personnel have the opportunity to vote; we even make it a collateral duty for senior personnel in commands to assist personnel in applying for absentee ballots and registering (most commands call them the "voting assistance officer", and in the Navy it's usually a senior E-6 or above, or a junior officer.) And most commands stress the importance of voting, too...which is good, especially for junior sailors/soldiers who often don't understand the importance of voting. 
  
 
 
 But sometimes the registration drives can be intimidating, as   urlLink  this column    points out. I'm not surprised...many at my current command make it loud and clear that they are hardcore GOP and very pro-Bush. And it's also clear that anything other than a Bush vote is considered somewhat unpatriotic and anti-military...somewhat treasonous. I hear comments all the time along the lines of "Kerry...what are you, French?" or "Kerry...what, you don't support the Commander-in-Chief" when I wear my "John Kerry for President" ballcap or tshirt. 
 
 
  
 No wonder that some junior personnel are intimidated, and feel that they must register/vote GOP. The above article could even be compared to the voter registration drive (ironically in the same city, my hometown of Jacksonville, FL) where they   urlLink  passed out pre-chosen (GOP)    registration forms to new citizens coming out of their citizenship ceremony.

           Ed and I dove  again today...after a trip to  Makapu'u  Beach Park , where the surf just wasn't cooperating, we again ended up on the   North  Shore .          &nbsp;     The first dive was  a bad spot; poor visibility, not deep enough for a good dive, bit of a  current/surge. Did see 2 or 3 turtles, including two on the beach, but all in  all was more of a glorified snorkeling trip.         &nbsp;      The second  was my first dive at    Three Tables   , much better than first dive of the  day. Good sampling of marine life, a few turtles, and near the end a squid being  chased by fish. Easy entrance and exit, smooth rocks to climb up to the parking  lot.          &nbsp;     In the future, have  to check that    surf report    more  closely.
