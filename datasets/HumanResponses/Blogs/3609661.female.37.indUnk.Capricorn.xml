      This is the place where all my friends can chat / post just about anything. So Bonnie you know what to do. I have changed my time zone. Thanks for informing me. About my new Honda Accord , for now, I’m still proud to be the owner. Thanks to Richard, if not for him I would curse myself for picking Hyundai. It looks old by design and would make me feel old to drive. Once I was at a petrol station, someone came by my car, looked around and compliment it. (smile) that make me a double proud owner.

      When I was in my 20’s, I used to have so many compliments of how smooth my skin was, how beautiful and slim I was. Why don’t I have bulging tummy. Many envious me despite me eat a lot and don’t put on weight. Often asked, what my beauty secret is. I smiled and said I was just plain lucky to be blessed with all that. Now I’m 37, if only I could turn back the clock. I don’t receive good compliments any more. Bye bye to smooth beauty flawless skin and hello to my fats and cellulite. I learnt one thing for sure no one can get away with age. When the clock ticks, so is our body. Everything seems to head south. Thank God I have a smaller breast, at least it doesn’t swings for now.    I can’t deny I have aged and I have to accept it but it doesn’t mean I’m not taking any preventive measures to slow down aging. My goal is to age gracefully. Now my main concern is cellulite. HELP!!!! No way I’m putting on my swim suit. Guys, if any one found a painless non surgical way getting rid of cellulite, or any products tested and proven effective, please…please…please… share with me.  Hope to see more posting on health and beauty secrets.  Bye….
