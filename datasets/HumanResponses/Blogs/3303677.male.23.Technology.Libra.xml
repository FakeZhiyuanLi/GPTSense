      I love it myself, but I hate it when I have to drop everything I am doing just to go move a computer so that floors can be waxed. Oh well, it is part of what I do. I really wish I wouldn't get fired for using the classic line of "A lack of proper planning on your part, doesn't constitute an emergency on mine".  I hate policies that regard grooming. I really think that having picked the new boss with the military background might have been a bad idea. Now policies are getting put in place that govern how hairy my face is allowed to be, and we might not get to wear shorts this summer. I really hope the one with the shorts gets put in place, that way I can take whoever came up with the idea and have them walk around with me in 100+ degree heat, wearing pants and a thick ass shirt and see if they change their mind. Ah the joys of work.  I also think I fixed my ankle. Special thanks to the power cord for that one. Anyway all in all not to bad of a day. I am sure my evening will be better. I get to spend it with someone I really care about. Anyway it is time to put up the golf carts and almost time for me to go home from work.

      I can't come up with a title for this, there aren't words to describe how I feel right now. Verbal communication doesn't have the ability to express the totality of my joy. I can't even put anything into words right now. Part of it could be lack of sleep, but I am certain most of it isn't. I can't wait to see her again. good thing it will only be about an hour and a half.

      Yes that is right I finally got a new cell phone. It is not active yet, but it should be soon. The really good news is that my number didn't change, Yippie!!!  I also for the first time in my life (other than the one time before that didn't count) ate sushi. It wasn't bad, I would have to aquire a taste for it. I will probably try it again the next time I have a chance.

      We got our new laptops for work yesterday, and they are pretty nice. They aren't the best in the world, but they are much better than what we had. I just wish the resolution would go higher than 1024x768. I will find a way to fix that problem.

      I really hate to use baseball terms but they kind of work in my mind at the moment. Anyway things are looking up. I really hope they keep going the way they are.

      A swing and a miss, you know what I am talking about. That extremely poorly executed play last night. Oh well, get over it because here comes the second pitch.

       urlLink AMD's Opteron 150 and 250 processors - The Tech Report - Page 1   When can I have one? I can't wait to get my new computer built.  Arg Sleep is good and I didn't get enough last night, oh well it isn't all bad. The reason I didn't get much sleep is worth it.

       urlLink Slashdot | Economics of Online Gaming   This just goes to prove the line from PCU is true. "that's the glory of college, you can major in gameboy if you know how to bullshit"  I thought this was excellent.

      Weekends are a beautiful thing. I had an excellent weekend. I got horribly trashed on Friday with my closest friends. I spent all day Saturday with a special someone. I then went to New Orleans with my closest friends and got smashed (not horribly this time). It was one of the best weekends I have had in a long time and I can only see more on the horizon like this. Wow I am in a great mood today. It could be better but I am a chicken shit. Chuck knows what I mean.   Well After a great weekend I have a rainy Monday. It is not a bad Monday, but it is rainy. I wish my job didn't make me go outside. Well I have to go get wet again.

      I have now been working on this same computer for about an hour and a half. Due to my lack of sleep last night, I have dozed off at least 6 times. I hate slow computers, and I hate Microsoft even more. I found a URL written on a post it on this monitor. It is . urlLink   I think it is kind of funny. Mmm, time for sleep.

      I suppose that I should introduce myself in the off chance that someone might be reading this. My name is Stimpy (at least that is what my friends call me). My real name is unimportant. I am 23 years old and work for a higher-education institution doing computer technician type stuff. I am currently working on a Bachelors degree in Software Engineering. I live in the wonderfully backward state of Mississippi. I live with a cat in a small 2 bedroom apartment. My interests are computers, technology, science, alcohol, the ocean, and anything else that happens to float my boat at the time. This blog is about my thoughts (Warning they can be random and strange) and feelings about my daily life. When I have time I will put in entries that some people might find interesting or amusing. I personally would find comfort if someone found them oddly similar to their own thoughts. Anyway I have to return to work now. Enjoy reading.

      Ah Wednesday that wonderful day of the week which is closely related to limbo in my mind. All that needs to happen is for time to reverse and we all have to re-live Tuesday and Monday all over again. I take comfort that the universal laws of physics are harder to break than that. One of these days I will get up the nerve to do what I have been wanting to do. It is a good thing I am not trying to alter the course of time otherwise I might never get up the nerve.

      I had heard rumor that Google might be giving out beta accounts to people based on who was signed up for blogger, so I decided to sign up and see if that was true. Since I am here I think I will share my brain with you. Unfortunatly, I have to get to work for now, but I will be back later.
