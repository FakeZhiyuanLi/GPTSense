      This is the beginnings a fantasy-science fiction novel that I am working on.  If things get a little strange, please bear with me because I'm still a budding writer. (I guess)  > The Dragoness: Volume I  > A Legend Reborn    > Written By Ryan Crowther  > May 18, 2004                                                 Prologue                                  The Remittance of the Dragon Race     It was long ago in the medieval world we now call Terra.  Nearly seven hundred years ago, a great war began to spawn between two races of a once rather peaceful coexistence.  The world’s Imperial Army was at rest for what seemed like another decade in the eternity of its history and life was, at the very least, good for everyone.  The human race had built magnificent kingdoms of marble and stone during the many years of solitude to glorify the lasting peace.  Many stories were told of encounters with dragons and their massive underground citadels, for which it was deemed that no man could ever find.  And this belief held true for every human in the world of Terra, for no one had set eyes upon the vast cavities underground, although many expeditions were led to seek them out.  All of these, however, were to no avail.  Many people created images in the minds of children depicting castles made entirely of a magical metal called mythril, that was nigh impervious to any other substance in the world, forges whose tempering blazes were hotter than volcanoes, and statues of epic proportions that occupied underground chambers that were greater in size and depth than the largest of lakes on the surface of Terra.  Some even suggested that these marvels were only the beginning, and that many of the dragons had established kingdoms in the clouds, as well.    And so it was that the humans looked upon the dragon race with an unyielding respect, such that even the wicked wouldn’t dare to stare scornfully at the solemn face of the huge, winged beast.  And the dragons smiled with amusement at the activities of the human race, as they seemed to mill about in their own world, oblivious to what the high heavens may have in store for them in the near future.  The dragons had been very happy with their role as the guardians of Terra and they often looked to the stars to predict any upcoming events that may need preparation.  During the many decades that were such a short part of their life, the dragons had found little need to look to the stars, for the vast reaches of space were scintillating tranquilly without a shadow of a doubt.  In fact, many dragons grew curious about the lives of the humans and would pay short visits, often to see what it was like to sleep on the loamy, grass-covered soil in a forest, the rough but soothing grains of sandy beaches or the rugged and rocky terrain of the mountains and highlands.  The humans’ encounters with dragons were hardly confrontational.  Although most dragons didn’t appreciate being disturbed from their slumber, they were easily consoled if they were told a good story or given an interesting or perishable gift.  But what the humans failed to realize was that these friendly meetings would soon come to an abrupt end.    It still isn’t certain today, but something in the stars caused a conflict to arise between the dragons and they turned on each other, being on opposing sides of the argument.  Soon, the humans were caught in the middle of their turmoil; earthquakes tore up the land beneath them, lightning filled the sky above them, lava flow from volcanoes scorched the earth around them and floods and hurricanes swept along the coastlines nearby.  Everyone began to panic and those that weren’t already killed took what food was left and hid themselves away in the mountainside.  A few neutral dragons searched the torrent of destruction on the surface of Terra hoping to take some humans to a safer place, but no one believed their intentions and now that Terra was slowly being destroyed, there wasn’t any safe place to witness the looming apocalypse.    Through the course of six fierce months, the surface of Terra was devastated and the populations decimated, but even the dragons had succumbed to such horrible environments and the raw power of their own elemental attacks.  Soon, the quivering of the earth ceased with the fighting and the humans, stricken by starvation and a brutal thirst, emerged to see that their once beautiful planet was on the verge of extinction itself or so it seemed.  With the few dragons that remained in a desolate silence, the human race was able to rise up once again from the ashes of its home world and as the kingdoms began to be restored, so did the land and sea.  The earth ceased to tremble and the fissures created new mountains, the sky, once filled with black and the blue-white flashes of lightning in the reflection of the pouring rain, was restored with the subtle docility of the soft, low-hanging clouds, the forests, marred by the burns of pyroclasmic flows, gave birth to new plant life from the rich deposits of soil, and the oceans’ once tempestuous and violent natures were restored with gently rippling waves and friendly winds for sailors.  And so some say that the world of Terra had begun anew, brimming with life and viridian color just as it once did before what was called The Great Renewal.    The humans knew that the dragons were the cause of such an onslaught, and so it was that through the next six months, several crusades were led to put an end to the dragon race, the so-called guardians of Terra.  Villagers still encountered the dragons near their very dwellings at times and the confrontations were catastrophic.  If a man were to come face to face with a dragon, he would neither fight nor run, but wait for the inevitable; an almost certain death.  Many lives were taken only by chance encounters such as these and the few survivors died shortly afterward.  The people’s vengeance drove the soldiers of the quickly regrouping Terran Imperial Army to seek out and smite all of the dragons but one, whom no man in his right mind would confront, let alone attempt to kill.  Auron, the legendary King of the Dragons, was his name, which no dragon would speak in vain.  A name that was holier and revered more than that of the Christian God.  Perhaps this was because of the fact that he was a known entity or maybe it was that the dragons had a stronger system of monarchy than any human could even imagine.  Whatever the reason, Auron, the great King of the Dragons, was said to be untouchable and invincible beyond that, and yet the Terran soldiers marched on for three months to find his underground kingdom, only to face him at the most desolate place on Terra.  It was the only place that still bore the scars from the carnage of the recreation.    The battlegrounds were nothing but a barren wasteland shrouded by a nigh impenetrable mist.  As the soldiers marched purposefully onward, they were cognizant of a subtle presence nearby.  Only then did Auron launch his surprise attack, and even the most wary soldiers had only seen a large shadow before their life was taken.  They did not see the razor-sharp claws and teeth like guillotines that shredded their very existence.  The only one who was spared was Commander Sylvia Reynard, who had cleverly disguised her identity and ascended to the top of the Terran Imperial Army by only a matter of deception and great courage.  She watched as the shadow stood still in the distance, focusing intently as though she would be slain in an instant if she were to look upon the myriad of dead soldiers strewn about the ground all around her.  And the fog lifted slightly and the sun hung straight above their heads at high noon.  The playing field was set and the match between the two clan leaders would soon begin.    Neither the blue nor the silver pair of eyes broke contact; both woman and beast shared an equal fury, an equal pain, and an equal determination.  Commander Reynard had already sustained a near loss of her life; her left arm had been torn from its socket several years ago by a dragon.  The wounds were cauterized and the limb was sewed back on by hand and she ignored all of the pain that she still felt from it as her eyes remained fixed on the twenty-foot beast with head bowed down in anger and claws poised to strike at any moment.  And Auron, now living with the pain of his clan’s near extinction, knows that this is a battle not to be won for his clan, but now only for himself.  There is no hope for him now, and he realizes that he fights only to live out the rest of his years in solitude as the last of his kind, never to come into existence again.  And so the fierce battle began with the clashing of sword on claw and after many bouts of parrying swift blows, it was clear that Auron had a huge advantage.  His size and speed could only contribute further to his already astonishing power, but Commander Reynard’s strength was unfathomable, especially for a woman clad in such heavy armor and it was for this reason that she had been able to fend off his attacks.    Auron’s mind began to wander and his concentration slackened slightly; he was planning to escape and leave Reynard to die in the arid heat of the sun, left completely exhausted.  And this was true, for the Commander was having strong second thoughts about this match-up and the cruel environment that would most inevitably claim her life first.  Auron glanced around and saw a faint rippling in the distance, just above the ground, but it wasn’t the reflection of the now very thin layer of mist that hung about them.  He had slowed down his attack frequency and this gave Commander Reynard the opportunity to launch a fierce attack on him for the first time.  The blade of the great sword came down mightily upon the claws of the startled King of the Dragons and his guard nearly collapsed under such a blow.  As he regained his composure, he was able to force Reynard’s sword away from him and both combatants faltered backward momentarily.  The moment turned into many seconds where the two leaders stared at each other, slowly becoming complacent.  At last, Commander Reynard buried the blade of her broadsword in the nutrient-starved soil and seeing this, the King of the Dragons folded his wings and lowered his claws.  He glanced to the side only for a second and Reynard eyed him warily as he looked at her sideways.  Then, without a trace of movement to betray his intentions, Auron flew straight into the distance and vanished before the Commander’s very eyes.  And she only smiled at his tenacity, for little did he know that shortly after the long and arduous solo journey back home, Commander Sylvia Reynard would set down her military equipment for eternity…

       **THIS CHAPTER WILL BE UPDATED WITH THE REWRITTEN VERSION IN A FEW DAYS**   > Chapter 1  > The Call of Destiny     Sunday   March 21st, 2013   9:02 PM   Dear Diary, 	It’s the last day of spring vacation.  You should know by now that tomorrow is my 18th birthday.  I just hope nobody will make a big deal of it at school tomorrow.  You’re probably wondering why I’m telling you this.  Well, I have a feeling that something truly special is going to happen tomorrow.  I know, I must sound crazy, just like the other times that I’ve felt like this and it never happened, but something’s different this time.  I can’t describe it, and it just makes my head hurt to find out how, but I hope it will be for the better. 	I think I’ve worried about the future long enough.  As they say, you can’t live life with your head in the clouds, so I’ll just take things one step at a time, just like I always do.  I guess I can always count on the present to be there for me, so I won’t let anything stop me from having a good day tomorrow.  Good night!      Jan      It was Monday as Janet Wilson read over her latest diary entry once again.  She tossed her long brown ponytail over her shoulder as she lay on her queen-size bed, holding the blue-bound, custom gold-lettered book open in her hands.  She couldn’t help reading the lines, written in a metallic blue ink, over and over, despite the fact that she had told her diary that she wouldn’t morose over the issue.  She tried to think of other things, but always found herself coming back to the diary, in which she only wrote the most important events of her life.  Her bright, blue eyes were still transfixed on the page and she wasn’t sure why she couldn’t stop thinking about it; something was just nipping at the back of her mind and she had know to find out what it was, but how?    Then she remembered her calculus homework, which she had better get started on soon, because it was already 6 o’clock.  As she got up to dig into her blue, vinyl-lined backpack, something new caught her attention in the mirror for a split-second, and she stopped for a while.  She looked into the mirror at various angles, trying to reenact the way she had passed it before, but it didn’t happen again.  Then she noticed that the change was actually in her self-perception.  Behind the few freckles that dotted her face beside her nose and her piercing blue eyes, there was a new sort of elegance that she couldn’t quite describe.  She removed her navy blue hair tie, letting her hair fall down about to her waist and her mouth opened slightly.    Perhaps this elegance was simply the feeling one gets when they’ve known someone forever and yet, something new, exciting and beyond your conceivable interest is there.  Then Janet realized something else, although not nearly for the first time; everything was blue.  Her cute little blouse, her slightly-faded denim jeans, her socks, the shoes she’d picked out at Kohl’s, the bedspread, the pillows, the diary, the pen, her bag; the list could go on for an eternity.  Even the walls were painted a light shade of blue, before the family had even moved into house.  Maybe it was some matter of destiny.  Destiny is such a powerful word in itself, the word that determines the very purpose of an individual’s existence.  A word so powerful that even fate must bend to its constant will, for fate may change the path, but it can never change the destination.  Hence, the reason for the form of the word, destiny, and that was it.    That was the powerful, gripping emotion that quelled inside of Janet Wilson on her not-usually-so-fantastic eighteenth birthday.  Today was not just another birthday with cake, candles, jokes and a few presents.  Today a critical event would come that would guide her toward her true destiny unknown.  As the thought had left her head, it was replaced with the cruelest image of irony she had probably seen in her life; a scene where she and her family went out to dinner late and as they sat down at a table, the man of her dreams walked by.  How she gazed at him with the utmost passion, until he pulled out a gun and told her to stop staring at him and when the gun fired, a sound like a large bubble bursting reverberated inside of her head and she was tossed back into reality.    ‘No.  That wasn’t even close.  Besides, the guy killed me anyway,’ Janet thought to herself resolutely, but still a bit heart-stricken nevertheless.  She forced herself to smile and laugh at the whole incident as she pulled out her rather ponderous mathematics text and heaved it onto the blue bedspread that depicted rolling ocean waves.  She took her pencil in her left hand and set it to the paper, when her eyes fell on the complex formulas that covered the opposite page of her book, and she remembered just how much math made her sick from time to time.  It was definitely not that she didn’t understand it, although calculus in itself was difficult to grasp.  In fact, Janet usually did very well with her math courses; they just made her crazy if she wasn’t in the right mood, and her mind was still on whatever was supposed to happen today.    By the time she had finished the first problem, which spanned over nearly a fourth of the page, it became too stressful for her at the present time.  Whenever Janet became stressed, a nice cool shower was the best solution, well for her anyway.  It could help her focus or just let her take a load off and not worry about so many things, and in this situation it was probably the answer to both of those problems.  And so she picked out another easily matching blue outfit and took it across the silent hall and into the bathroom.  Her parents wouldn’t be home until about eight.  They worked a late ten-hour dayshift or an early swingshift, however you might put it, from 9 to 7:30.  Janet thought it was interesting that they both worked at the same complex, but almost never saw each other all day.  Actually, it sounded kind of sad, now that she thought about it, and she only got to see them later at night and early in the morning before she walked to school.  She really missed them sometimes…    Janet glanced in the mirror rather timidly as she pulled her pale blue top over her head.  She instinctively blushed, self-consciously, as most anyone would trying to look their best for themselves.  She was about five-nine with a small frame, a lean and slender build and quite a fair complexion.  She was sometimes late to her classes in the few recent years, and since then she’d made a habit of wearing a watch on her right wrist.  She pulled a couple clean towels from the cupboard there and stepped into the shower.  She hadn’t noticed that she had forgotten to remove her watch before getting in the shower until the alarm she had set went off, reminding her of the exact time of her birth; 6:22.  It was just one of those things that one almost does without thinking, setting a watch for such a precise time to commemorate a special event.  She just smiled and turned it off, but as she bent over to place it by the shower door where it wouldn’t get wet, she froze.  As the beads of cool water softly rained upon her face, something very strange began to happen to her.  >                                  A blaze of potential the ocean doth hold, A powerful motive when tamed and controlled. Still lies in a darkness so bleak and so cold, But soon shall its purpose begin to unfold.

The dragons were a race of winged beasts that had been fighting even before recorded history.  For centuries, the forces of earth, fire, water, wind and all those in between had clashed, making the early Realm a hostile and dangerous place.  Chronic and often subsequent natural disasters generated chaos throughout the land, leaving the humans to be cast aside in the dire conditions.  Many of the survivors sealed themselves away in caves, emerging only to search for food and water. After what seemed like an eternity, the power of the dragons began to wane and the remaining humans established grandiose kingdoms with high stone walls to protect them from the howling winds, raging swells, rampant wildfires and massive earthquakes.  As one may imagine, the humans did not wish to continue enduring such cataclysmic events.  Many sought a great vengeance for all the pain the people had suffered, and so it was that numerous crusades were led to put an end to the violent and seemingly endless struggle.  The bravest men were sent to slay the dragons, no matter the cost.  It was their sole mission after they had been drafted into the army. The blood of many dragons was shed and countless human lives were lost in order to establish a somewhat stable peace.  The few remaining dragons went into hiding and there were occasional reports of surprise attacks on villagers.  What the humans had failed to realize was that the dragons were merely fighting amongst themselves.  The humans had only been afflicted by acts of rage and more or less careless elemental attacks.  Although the crusades brought a lasting peace, they had a traumatic effect on the dragons’ perceptions of the human race. As more and more attacks were reported, the few remaining dragons were hunted and killed and the surface of the Realm was disturbed only by many futile crusades to find the last King of Dragons.  Finally, one party was able to seek him out.  It was said that nothing the soldiers could do would harm him.  After tireless bouts of swords against claws, the strongest iron armor in the land, the finest weapons tempered by accomplished blacksmiths of the Realm and the bodies of many valiant souls were strewn about and the leader of the small army was left to face the beast alone.  Neither of them was ever seen again.  Many versions of the epic battle were told, but no one was really certain what had actually happened.  After many conjectures and assumptions were made, it was decided that the warrior had used every ounce of his strength to banish the beast to another dimension.  Soon, even the very conclusion of the legend had faded from the memories of the people as the triumph over the legendary beasts was celebrated. There were a few who understood the dragons’ actions.  The majority of which were scientists and philosophers, but many were put to death for their suggestions and the few who escaped left their legacies in books before they had passed away.  However, there was a period of time when books of fantasy and similar notions were destroyed.  Thus, the legacy of the dragons faded from existence and the new era of the humans unfolded...    1 	A young girl was walking down 82nd Street, somewhere between 21st and 24th Avenue.  She was returning home from Lincoln High School after the breezy first day back from spring vacation.  Her name was Janet Wilson.  The end of her long, light brown ponytail gently met her right shoulder as it carried in the wind.  A few small freckles dotted her face near the sides of her nose.  Janet’s blue eyes gazed up at the sky for a few moments.  She hardly remembered what had happened in school that day, due to the end of vacation.  She was a bit of a tomboy.  She sighed as she let herself into her front door at 2317 SE 82nd Court.  She hiked up the stairs to her room and tossed her bag onto the floor.  Then she fell backwards onto her queen-size bed; her eyes were closed, deep in thought. 	Today was a special day, though.  It was her birthday and no one ever remembered except her parents, who she received small gifts from, promptly in the morning before school.  Every year it was the same.  There wasn’t a birthday she could remember having that wasn’t on a school day.  She got lonely sometimes, being by herself all day.  Her parents both worked swing shift six days a week, so Saturday morning and Sunday were usually the only times she really ever saw them. 	She was eighteen today, well, not for a couple of minutes, anyway.  She wasn’t excited about it like most girls her age were.  To her, it was just another scratch upon the wall; another year that had swept past her like the autumn leaves, which she thought about frequently.  She opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling; a slight yawn overcame her and she relaxed once again, trying to remember what she had to do for homework.  She thought for some time, but she couldn’t remember.  All she knew was that most of her teachers had the class take notes.  It didn’t matter much to her anyway, now that she thought about it; she needed some time to herself.  She had been working all during the vacation on a ten-page report about overpopulation of the world, only to find that it was due next week. 	She was anxious about something, but she couldn’t quite put her finger on it.  She decided that she’d take a shower, and maybe that would help calm her down.  She pulled her pajamas from the shelf and headed to the bathroom across the hall.  She took a towel from the bathroom cupboard and hung it on the shower door rail and took her time undressing.  She looked at her lean and slender figure in the mirror and smiled sheepishly.  She looked nice, but she was a bit embarrassed when she looked at herself.  She let out her long, waist-length hair as she turned away.  She glanced at the small digital clock on the counter; it was 4:32, the very minute she was born. 	“Yea!  This can be my birthday shower, then,” she said to herself in a rather silly voice as she stepped into the shower. 	Janet had always liked taking cold showers.  It was strange; the water didn’t feel as cold this time.  She turned and checked the knob; it was pushed as far to the right as it would go.  She shrugged her shoulders and turned back around to begin washing herself.  She had just picked up the soap when it happened.  She froze on the spot; the water was still running.  She dropped the bar of soap and it sounded with a resounding clunk on the bottom of the tub.  She was changing somehow and she was well aware of it. 	It felt like her skin was crawling up and down her body and she held her arm in front of her face, watching in petrified awe as the goose bumps disappeared and were slowly replaced by a pale green-colored flesh that traveled up the length of her arm.  She looked at her hand and gasped as her four fingers were slowly separated from each other with two on each side, so that they took a position similar to the one that Mork used to shake hands in the TV show.  They, too, turned the same greenish color.  Then she winced slightly as she watched the two pairs of fingers meld into one another; claws then extended out from each of the three fingers that were now part of her hand.  She rotated her wrist, looking at all sides of her now scaly skin.  Small, thin frills jutted out from the sides of her arms, similar to those of a lizard.  Then she remembered. 	It was like in her dreams.  She often dreamt about mythological creatures; they usually helped her find things or remember things that she may happen to forget during the morning before school started.  However, she never recalled any dream where she was or became such a creature, and now it was happening before her very eyes.  A sea of mixed emotions flooded her mind’s eye: excitement, apprehension, shock, confusion and curiosity coursed through her veins.  She couldn’t come up with anything that she could do about it, so she continued watching her body transform. 	Evidently, her arms had finished after what she had witnessed because she felt her legs begin to change, now.  They looked very similar to her arms, only without any frills on the sides.  She felt strange standing on the balls of her feet at first, but after a few seconds, she became quite accustomed to it; it actually began to feel like second nature.  She winced again as the number of toes on each of her feet was reduced to three, as well.  The pale green color slowly crawled up her legs and it wasn’t long before her torso changed, too.  Her hips widened a bit and her tummy firmed up; a white pad-like membrane stretched up her chest and came up to her throat.  She turned around and looked down as she felt a tail stretch out of her backside and extend down to the floor, also with the same dark green frills on top.  Her chest pushed out slightly and scales began covering her entire body.  Soon, her head changed, as well.  Her face from the nose down pushed forward, extending a few inches from her forehead and her mouth widened slightly at the corners.  Her lower jawbone pulled back and the greenish skin under her chin stretched down toward her neck, making it look similar to a dog’s jaw.  Her nose flattened slightly until the nostrils were but tiny slits resting above her upper jaw.  Her eyes narrowed and pulled back, giving them a very defined almond shape and they turned from blue to an aqua shade, as well.  Her hair and ears disappeared and two thick sort of antennae poked out from the back of her head and extended several inches, slanting backwards.  These antennae seemed to have a strong link to her bare instinct. 	Janet had closed her eyes while she felt herself change.  When she opened them, she noticed that she was standing at least a foot taller than she was earlier.  She looked at herself again after turning off the incessant stream of water that she had failed to even recognize while she was transforming.  She couldn’t believe it; she was some kind of lizard.  She stepped gingerly out of the shower and quickly dried herself.  She stopped short and put the towel down slowly.  Comprehension had dawned on her and she swiftly made her way to her brother’s old closet, where he had left all the things he didn’t want before leaving the house last August.  She opened it and flipped through the large stacks of Nintendo Power® magazines he had collected over the years; he had just about every issue.  It seemed as though several minutes had passed by, and after going through three piles of magazines, she found what she had sought. 	Buried among all the magazines her brother had paid for, underneath one of the first issues ever created, laid the book.  It was much like a magazine in itself, given its glossy pages, although it was much thicker than the rest.  It was The Dungeons and Dragons Monster Manual, which he had treasured ever since he had begun playing the game itself.  She worked diligently as she opened it, taking much care not to rip the pages with her claws as she thumbed through (or maybe not) each one, searching for her likeness.  She found it on one of the last pages: DRAGON.  According to the book, it was one of the strongest monsters in the game.  However, comparing her image in the mirror to the almost malicious portrayal in the book didn’t seem to fit.  The teeth were excessively long and sharp.  The eyes, extremely narrowed, gave it a strong aura of violence and evil.  The smoke emitting from its nostrils only dismayed her further.  It was rather strange.  She was completely different, even when she tried to take into consideration the artist’s intents in the drawing as compared to her lifelike form.  There was something special about her; about the way she was now that puzzled her. 	She flipped through the few remaining pages in the manual, but there was nothing remotely close.  She opened the book to the picture again and began to read the text.  There was a lot to read.  After skimming over two whole pages of the small print, Janet’s eyes ran over something shocking.  At first, she didn’t notice the words, but she stopped and read over them again in wonder: HALF-BREEDS.  She read eagerly and it went something like this:  	Some dragons are actually half-breeds, meaning that they are not entirely of draconian descent.  The most common half-breed dragon is that combined with a human.  The human is bestowed the power to transform at an age specific to the type of dragon...thus, the human may become a dragon when he/she comes in contact with his/her innate element.  SEE THE CHARACTER MANUAL FOR DETAILS.  	Unfortunately, her brother did not have the Character Manual, just this one.  She thought for awhile in amazement.  She was a half-breed.  A million questions still fluttered through her mind.  What does it all mean?  Why me?  Was I born like this or did I get it somehow?  How did I come about all this?  She stared blankly at the page for a few moments, then went on:  	A half-breed dragon has been given a special name: ‘Dragoner’ or ‘Dragoon’ for males, and ‘Dragoness’ for females, or simply ‘halfling’ in general terms.  Dragoons have been depicted in other game manuals, but a dragoness has never appeared in any of the novels or game plots so far...  	Janet stopped abruptly; she found this information rather insulting.  She shrugged it off, though and finished the paragraph:  	...Dragoon is now a word that describes a strong warrior with great knowledge and wisdom as well as unmatched fighting prowess.  In Dungeons and Dragons, dragoons--  	She couldn’t stand it any longer.  There was nothing else important in the rest of the text.  That was all she needed to know.  For one of the first times in her life, she felt inferior; she had always had a high self-esteem, but now it didn’t seem to help her.  She was a monster that now seemed far beyond her control.  She dropped the manual onto the floor and sobbed softly for a while.  She stopped after a few minutes, drying her eyes with the back of her scaly arm.  She looked at the cover of the manual and then remembered what it had said.  She was a dragoness, a being that no one ever bothered to illustrate or describe, and yet, there she was, living proof.  But she couldn’t just tell anyone about this, nor did she really want to.  She imagined herself, calling up the company that made this game, wherever it was.  It would be ridiculous. 	‘...Like trying to convince someone that you’re the Loch Ness monster or something,’ she thought.  Then she recalled the more useful information she had found in the text. 	‘Contact with the innate element it had said,’ she thought.  ‘What’s that supposed to mean?’  She ran over it in her mind; it seemed to flop over and over like a burger being tossed off the griddle.  Soon it cooked nicely though as she finished analyzing it.  She knew that she had transformed in the shower.  She knew that it was a few minutes after the time in which she was born.  What she now had to decide was whether it was the water, or just a mere coincidence of her 18th birthday...   2 	Janet poured over the solution in her mind; the answer seemed to escape her each time she came within inches of grasping it.  Hence, her mind was in a fit of exasperation, trapped between the vague information from the manual and her own personal knowledge; she wasn’t sure what was right or wrong, until it hit her. 	She decided that both were correct.  She had a feeling all along; her 18th birthday must have marked the adolescence in her dragon form, which in turn, was the only reason why she was able to transform when the water covered her in the shower.  That must mean that her innate element is water.  She looked at the front of the book and found the description of each of the four elements of nature, each of which were depicted neatly on the page.  After reading the brief descriptions, she had a good understanding of what else she might encounter while in this form. 	“The elemental power of water symbolizes divine serenity and internal peace,” she read out loud.  She began to ponder the true meaning of this sentence when a dark shroud of uncertainty suddenly appeared in her mind, clouding her thoughts in a black veil as it began to take shape.  She had been so busy trying to understand the purpose of all this that she had forgotten what she was. 	Will I ever be the same again?  How am I going to go to school tomorrow?  Why is this happening to me?  She had so many questions still, but her first pierced the darkness in her mind; the words were etched in an emerald type into the blackened background of nothingness that rendered her oblivious to anything else.  She stood with her eyes closed. WILL I EVER BE THE SAME AGAIN?  The question echoed over and over, resounding throughout what seemed to be an empty space inside her head.  Soon the soft voice of her conscience distorted, becoming worse and worse until a maniacal voice was screaming the words at the top of its lungs.  The words pounded mercilessly on her eardrums, growing even more unbearable by the second.  When she thought her ears would explode right out of her head, reality came and hit her square in the face. 	She was on the ground, lying down and holding her aching head.  The pain had subsided, though the effect it had on her emotions was traumatic.  She struggled to stand up and fought valiantly to regain her self-esteem, but it was no use; she would never be herself again.  She would have to own up to her cruel, new reality.  She thought about school the next day.  She knew she could just say that she was sick, but how long could that last?  Her school life was going to be nonexistent, one crazy excuse after another.  She began running through a myriad of possible excuses for missing class, but then, something even more shocking occurred to her.  Her parents would be home at about ten.  She quickly glanced at the clock in her brother’s old room: quarter to seven.  She couldn’t even imagine facing her parents with something like this. 	She just had to find a way to get back; to become herself again, but her mind was a complete blank.  She continued staring rather stupidly at the closet door.  Then something wrapped around her stomach, which she didn’t even notice until about three seconds afterward.  It was her tail; she had completely forsaken the good things about how she was now.  She looked down and wiggled the tip of her tail, thinking about all the new things that she would be able to do.  She could not only reach the upper shelves of the closet, where her mother often hid things, but see whatever it was that was up there, thanks to her height.  She had an extra appendage to help her do just about anything.  She had--  Her thoughts came to an abrupt halt and a puzzled look overcame her face; she was about to say ‘wings,’ but she didn’t have any. 	“Every dragon I’ve ever seen or read about had wings.  Why don’t I?”  It was clear that this would be the greatest thing about being a dragon.  The ability of flight is something anyone would wish for, and so she craned her longer neck around to double-check.  There was nothing there but the large, dark green frills down her spine and the rather fluorescent, teal scales that covered her back.  She sighed softly and stared at the floor in front of her. 	‘There has to be a way,’ she thought to herself.  ‘I want to fly, to soar amidst the clouds in the sunny, blue sky.’  She looked up toward the ceiling and imagined the scene, as fallacious as it seemed.  Then the words from the book came back to her: The elemental power of water symbolizes divine serenity and internal peace.  She marveled at the profundity of the phrase again and stood awhile in thought. 	“Is that supposed to represent my feelings and my attitude toward life or something?”  It seemed pretty accurate, or so she thought, although she admitted that she wouldn’t go quite that far. 	“Is this my destiny?” she asked, sounding as though these words escaped her mouth and were beyond her control.  She shook her head and walked down the stairs to the living room; she lay down on the couch and closed her eyes. 	She had to get back to herself before her parents got home.  It would be so embarrassing, not to mention inexplicable, as well.  A snatch of the text flitted through her mind; it appeared as a small and thin strip of paper, like the kind that you get out of fortune cookies at a Chinese restaurant. 	Each element shares a symbiotic relationship with another and each element also has--  She couldn’t remember. 	“What was it?  Apparition, abhorrence, a position, no...”  She screwed up her face in frustration and let out a small grunt of disappointment. 	“What was it?” she asked herself, angrily.  It took her naught but thirty seconds to come up with the answer.   “...A partition, no...  Oh, opposition!”  She couldn’t believe she could have forgotten that so easily. 	“But which one?  Water douses fire, the ground absorbs water, the winds sometimes pollute the grass and plants and the fire burns off the oxygen?  I don’t know...”  She was confused; there were too many things racing through her head for her to think clearly. 	“Wait!  None of that can be true because there’s no opposing elements.  There are just weaknesses to one another.”  She had hit the nail on the head.  This statement was very true and now she had to find the correct relationship.  “OK.  Here goes...” 	“Symbiotic...  bio- means life and sym- means same or with, so that must mean two elements that help each other or something.”  She paused for a moment to confirm this again in her head and after giving a slight, but confident, affirmative nod, she continued. 	“When I think of water, I think of the ocean waves and...  The winds whether they are calm or stormy over them.  That’s it, so that means earth and fire must share a symbiotic relationship.”  She paused and giggled, the excitement welling up inside her.  However, she was brought back the subject by a worrying glance at the clock, which read 7:40. 	“Then that means that water and fire are opposing forces, and that means fire can overcome the water, too.  When water is added to fire, the fire is doused, but when fire is added to water...  That’s it!” 	Janet sprinted up to the bathroom as fast as her dragon feet would take her.  She closed the door and turned the heat lamp on, then laid her head and neck across the countertop.  She must have lain there for five minutes and the room was very warm.  She felt very weak and tired.  The fan clicked on automatically as the temperature rose to the maximum allowance for the room and she knew it wasn’t going to work.  She picked up her head, clicked off the lamp and crawled out of the room.  She knew that she had been very close, but it was not enough heat to make her turn back.  She lay on the floor in the hallway for a while and slowly began to recover her strength.  She was crushed; there was no way she could turn back if that hadn’t worked.  She lay, exhausted, thinking about what to do next. 	She was dizzy from the heat, but she managed to stand again.  She decided that she would double-check the manual, sidling once again into her brother’s old room and donning it.  She carefully flipped through the keen and glossy pages, although she was very eager to find the answer.  The almost menacing picture of the dragon came into view again and she skimmed the text.  Now, the image almost seemed offensive and demeaning, just because she knew how they really looked, or did she?  She evidently wasn’t a true dragon because she still didn’t have any wings, but that was beside the point.  The text revealed the dragon’s weakness to her, which gave her all the information she needed.  Hence, she dashed into the bathroom to give it another go.  She turned the heat lamp on with her head placed just below it and after only a few seconds, she devolved.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	It was almost eight-thirty when she heard a knock on the door; her parents were home.  She quickly pulled on her pajamas and hurried down the hall to replace her brother’s manual, but she heard the lock start clicking and she doubled back into her room and stashed it in her dresser drawer.  She donned a sleepy look and sauntered to the landing on the stairs just as her mother opened the front door. ‘They’re early,’ she thought to herself. 	“Hi, Jan.  The boss let us off work early.”  She looked puzzled when she saw her, though.   “What’ve you been up to?” she asked, sort of slowly. 	“I was tired, so I took a nap,” Janet replied with a slight yawn. 	“Oh...” 	“So how was your day, sweetie?” her father chimed in. 	“Oh, it was pretty much the same...” she said, knowing that she was lying through her teeth.  They didn’t have to know about that, though.  “How was yours?” 	“Lo mismo, as they would say in Mexico, eh?  Not bad really.” 	“Yeah...”  Her voice trailed off and she stared off into space for a few moments. 	“Honey, are you all right?” her father asked.  It took her a few seconds to clue back into her surroundings. 	“Uh-huh.  I’m fine, Dad.  I’m going to go to bed, though.” 	“OK, honey.  Good night.” 	“Remember that you’ve got school tomorrow, Jan,” her mother added as she turned to head back to her room. 	“All right.  See you in the morning.” 	“Good night!”   3 	It felt as though her head had only just hit the pillow when she awoke again.  There was no way she would sleep again that night.  There were way too many things on her mind and nothing boring enough to send her back to her dreams, which in themselves, kept her thinking about what had happened that afternoon.  Something inside of her urged her to try it again as she lay on her side with her eyes wide open, staring into the gloom.  She rose and glanced at the fluorescent green numbers on her alarm clock, which read 11:20.  This seemed rather strange to her, because she had gone to bed at a quarter to nine and didn’t feel that she had slept at all.  Nevertheless, she picked a wide path around her queen-sized bed and stopped at the door.  She cast an ear to the door to hear if her parents would stir; she heard soft and gentle breathing, telling her that they were asleep after another long day.  Then she heard the faint plink of a droplet of water in the distance. 	She tore her ear from the closed door for a moment, then went and listened again.  There was nothing, which only augmented the doubt of her suspicion that the bathroom sink was leaking.  She shook her head slightly and quietly opened the door.  She tiptoed through the hall, treading lightly on the steps downstairs and avoiding the horribly creaking third step from the bottom.  She lent an ear upstairs once again as she passed the landing and began walking down toward the garage; there was nothing again.  She passed the garage door and as she opened the door to the den, she heard the sound again.  She looked about almost apprehensively for a few moments before letting herself in and closing the door behind her. 	The dim moonlight cast a sort of eerie gray light across the floor, filtering through the sliding glass door that led to the back patio.  Presently, this door opened and Janet stepped out into the cool, crisp spring air.  The wind was almost unnaturally still, and the grass glistened slightly with the evening dew that was approaching, which gave the backyard an almost holy atmosphere, as though the scene before her eyes was a gift from God himself.  She walked slowly toward the small swimming pool that her father had built.  The water looked like glass with only the slightly quivering reflection of the moon tainting its otherwise motionless surface.  She was cold in her pajamas, standing at the edge of the shimmering water.  It looked so inviting and after gazing briefly at her complexion on the water, she had set her pajamas down and slipped into the silent waves. 	She was ready.  She knew what would happen, but she wanted to figure everything out.  She wanted to know why she was chosen or at least why this was happening to her.  She had so many questions racing through her mind that when she opened her eyes, she realized that she was lying on the bottom of the pool.  At first, she gasped and scrambled to get to the surface, but after a few seconds, she found that no such thing was necessary.  She had just gasped, which meant that she would be coughing and sputtering right now and gasping further for air, but she wasn’t.  Right now, as she was thinking about this very principle, she was breathing, and now that she mentioned it, more easily than when she was on land.  She stared up through the water at the dull image of the moon and her tail almost involuntarily moved about.  She smiled and closed her eyes again, and emptied her mind of all the questions and doubts she had; they were only troubling her anyway.  As this very thought left her mind, she began to change again. 	She didn’t miss a bit of it, although it startled her at first; her mind, free of thought, allowed her to take note of all that was happening.  Although she saw nothing, her inattention to sight amplified how she was able to feel herself changing.  She was growing again, although much more rapidly than before; her neck extended much farther and her arms and legs, too, lengthened.  Her tail grew out to what she estimated was about twice its original length.  Her once very scaly skin smoothed out.  The biggest change, however, occurred in her face; her jaws pulled forward several inches and her closed eyes stretched back even farther across her face.  The antennae that stuck out from the back of her head lengthened and four others began protruding out and back from her cheekbones and down and back from the base of her lower jawbones.  She also acquired an acute sense of smell; the sharp aroma of pine wafted through her nostrils, even as she lay down on the bottom of the pool, which was now beginning to feel uncomfortable.  Her legs were bent slightly at the knees and her head was just brushing the opposite end of the pool.  She began to quake with apprehension and excitement.  However, she remained calm and collected as tension built up in her back.  She turned over and almost uttered a squeal as a loud and sweeping swoosh was heard and her wings burst from her back, just grazing the surface of the water.  She couldn’t take it anymore.  She just had to have a look. 	She stood up and craned her neck around.  There they were, a magnificent periwinkle shade.  She fanned them out, then replaced them, smiling.  She turned a soft gaze upon her forearm, frowning slightly at the apparently thin coating of scales cast upon it.  Her expression changed as she stroked them up and down, then in various other directions, with her claws; they were firm, but were almost like a down in that her claws never caught on them, no matter which way she scratched.  She poked her arm hard with one of her claws; it remained, unyielding.  She tried even harder and winced slightly as she broke through, a small cut appearing there.  She covered it and closed her eyes instinctually, expecting it to bleed, but instead it tingled, much like when her foot was asleep or so.  After a few seconds, it subsided and she removed her hand, and as she opened her eyes to look, she scanned up and down her arm, turning it over, but she could not find the cut.  Then she smiled again and shook her head knowingly.  When she opened her eyes again, she thought she had caught sight of the light turning off in her parents’ bedroom. 	“Shoot, I hope I was just seeing things.  Speaking of seeing things, what if they saw me out the window?  Crud, they better not have...”  The quiet words left her mouth and she bent her head down low from its residual perch (which was not quite level with the roof of the first floor) so that she was out of view from her parents’ bedroom window.  She heard a door close in the house and she immediately sank back into the water, curling up to fit more comfortably into the small swimming pool.  She listened urgently and heard the window open, followed by a few moments of silence and then she heard it slide closed again.  After a short while, she lifted her head out of the water and looked about.  It was very dark outside now. 	‘Phew, that was close.  I hope no one saw me,’ she thought to herself.  Just as she finished that thought she heard a slight squelch and ducked back into the water as the sliding glass door opened.  She slowed down her breathing.  It was probably her mother, because she faintly saw the shadow stop on the deck near where her pajamas lay and then retreat back into the house with the obvious vinyl sound of the glass door closing behind it.  Her father would have come looking for her if he knew she was in the pool; he often let his character get the best of him, as she would put it.  This was quite a common practice in their household and her parents were used to her going out back to relax when she couldn’t sleep.  However, little else but difficult could be said about the first few times she was found away from her bed in the middle of the night. 	A yawn overcame her as she gazed at the weary-looking moon and the lazy clouds above.  She wanted to soar among them so badly and yet, she knew she couldn’t because someone would certainly see her.  That would put the town in a horrible state of fear and awe if a photo was taken. 	“It’s not fair,” she said softly.  “It seems that I’ve been given a wonderful opportunity and I can’t take it because of the selfish minds of others.  I just wish I didn’t have to worry about the discriminatory eyes of others and that people would understand differences in each other, but nobody would understand someone as different as I am now...”  Her voice trailed off as she ran out of things to say and although most of what she said was true, there is always another person who may share one’s individual interests... 	She had to talk to somebody about it; she was still confused as to why this was happening.  She knew exactly what was going on.  She was going to have to tell her parents; they would find out sooner or later, anyway.  She decided that now was better than later, but she thought that she’d tell them in the morning, when they could at least know what she was talking about.  She laid her head back down in the pool and closed her eyes, knowing that they’d find her in the morning when they woke up.  She opened her eyes again; maybe that wouldn’t be the best way for them to find out.  She ran over the scenario in her head: 	Her mom would wake up and walk into her room to wake her, but she wouldn’t find her there.  Then she’d be worried and walk down the stairs calling, “Jan?  Jan, where are you?”  Then her dad would wake up because of the racket and once he got to his feet, he would head straight to the back door and find her outside at the bottom of the pool.  She would be there, sleeping; only he wouldn’t think that it was her for quite a while.  As a matter of fact, if he knew that a huge beast was sleeping in his pool, he would probably arm himself with whatever he could find, not worry her mom with the incident because he knew she would flip, and try and take care of it himself, somehow...  He would probably be clueless as to what to do about it at first, but then he’d probably summon some courage and yell at her, although he still had no idea that it was her.  Then she’d wake up and look at him and try and convince him that it was her and he’d never believe her; he’d think that it ate her or something... 	Anyway, she could see where that would lead and she wasn’t willing to try it.  Hence, she climbed out of the pool and dried herself as best she could, picked up her pajamas and bowed her head as she entered the house.  She made her way through the low-ceilinged den and into the washroom where she saw her reflection in the mirror.  Thick red markings looked as if they were painted below her eyes.  She smiled because she thought they looked cute, then blushed at the sight of her sharp set of dragons’ teeth.  She gave a slight wave, her claws clicking together once, as she left the mirror and turned the heat lamp on briefly, donned her pajamas from atop the dryer and walked silently up the stairs to her room.  She had just closed the door when she thought about it again. 	“You know; he probably couldn’t hurt me even if he did react that way, and besides, I could just show him when I walked inside, anyway.  Maybe if I just left a note on my bed...”  She packed up all her books and folders for school that morning and zipped up the last pocket on her backpack after replacing her pencil, which she had used to write a brief note on lined paper.  She left this on the corner of her bed and left for the backyard again, where she slipped into the pool once again, leaving her pajamas at the edge, curled up and fell asleep at last.   4 	The proceeding Tuesday morning dawned and the view of the rising sun from Janet’s window was blocked by a colored lined sheet of paper, bearing the following message:  Tuesday February 23rd, 2010 1:15 AM 	Dearest Mom and Dad, 			I apologize for my absence here in my room, but I have found a better place to sleep for tonight, a place where you would find it extremely difficult to do anything for any length of time.  Let alone sleep.  I will be attending school today, although my new and rather intimidating appearance may prove otherwise.  I hope that you will come to accept me as you will find me in the backyard today, for I believe that it expresses my true inner self and part of the purpose that I was intended.  Believe me, I’m not trying to scare you and I apologize now for any concern you may have. 						Thanks, 							Jan 	 Her mother sobbed softly and trotted down the stairs while her father remained and looked over the message again, deciphering the meaning of her specific whereabouts.  However, he soon came to wonder why she had even written about them in the first few sentences, then silently followed her mother downstairs with a bit of a worried look upon his brow.  He consoled her mother as they entered the den, then he drew the shades back on the back door and they stepped outside together.  Her father scanned the perimeter of the backyard from the doorway, but found nothing, then he knew exactly where she was, but was unable to believe himself until he called out to her softly in the early morning. 	“Jan!” 	For a moment, there was silence, and before he could call a second time, Janet’s head poked out of the water and watched them with her eyes in a weak expression, as though she were trying to convey her understanding of their feelings.  She rose her head slowly out of the water so that she wouldn’t alarm them, which was apparently an understatement as her mother watched, on the verge of tears.  Janet bowed her head down lower and rested it on the edge of the pool. 	“Mom?  Dad?  I’m sorry...” 	Her voice seemed to have struck a chord in her father’s heart as he stood in an almost stupefied awe.  He urged her mother to come with him as he walked to the edge of the patio, which was still at least four feet from the edge of the pool.  Her mother buried her head in his shoulder, holding his arm tight as they knelt down. 	“Jan, is that you?” he asked slowly.  There was a small pause before she replied. 	“Yeah, Dad.  It’s me...  Mom?” 	A few moments passed before her mother lifted her gaze to see her; she was still sobbing quietly. 	“Mom, I love you--  I’m sorry...” 	Her mother smiled, though with tears still in her eyes. 	“You too, Dad.  I know it must be hard for you guys...”  She spoke ever so softly.  Her father whispered in her mother’s ear, but spoke loud enough so Janet could hear. 	“It’s okay, Mira.  I know it’s her, however hard it may be to believe...  I know it’s her.” 	She nodded her head slightly, then brushed the tears from her eyes, smiling weakly. 	“What time is it?  Do I have to go to school yet?” Janet asked. 	“It’s 6:40.  We have plenty of time.” 	Janet came further out of the water.  She rested her arms on the hard tile surrounding the pool, with her long neck extending, bringing her head about a foot away from and above their faces.  Her wings broke the surface of the water as she bent her head lower in front of her mother, turning it toward the side.   	“Go on honey,” her father whispered in her mother’s ear.  “There’s nothing to be afraid of.” 	Her mother was very reluctant, but stroked the top of Janet’s head a few times, then patted it, smiling sheepishly as Janet looked and smiled back at her with a big mouthful of teeth before moving to her father.  He moved closer and hugged her about the neck, reaching back and stroking the back of her head. 	“I love you, Jan,” he said, scratching her chin a bit before she pulled her head back; she was smiling at him before replying. 	“You too, both of you.”  She pulled herself out of the pool with the water sliding right off her body as she came out, then laid down on the grass alongside the patio. 	“Come on, Mom.  I know you give better hugs than that.  Just because I’m different doesn’t make me any less of a daughter...”  She said this almost as though she was teasing her and her mother smiled bashfully and gave her a hug. 	“Oh, get over here, Joseph.  You heard what the girl said.”  She seemed much more confident and reassured than before and they all joined in a series of family embraces. 	Janet’s mother was resting against her side and she tapped her on the shoulder with her tail, quickly replacing it before she turned to look.  She was able to do this twice before her mother turned and saw Janet’s tail in her face before she was going to do it a third time.  They both laughed and Janet nodded to her knowingly as she did the same thing with her wing and father’s head.  He figured out what was up the second time, though, because he saw Janet start smiling out of the corner of his eye.  Everyone laughed as he craned his neck to see her wing before it touched him again.  Then he looked at his watch; it was 7 o’clock. 	“OK, honey.  We’ve got to get you to--  Wait, you said you were going to school today?” 	“Uh-huh.” 	“May I ask how?” her mother chimed in.  “You can barely fit in the den...” 	Janet flexed her wings and gave her a wide smile with her eyes closed. 	“No...  Don’t even think about it!  We barely know it’s you.  You don’t need to show the rest of the county!  There’s no way you’re going to fly to school, Jan!” 	Janet pretended to look sad and disappointed, bowing her head and looking at her mother out of the top of her eyes, who still looked back at her rather sternly.  She glanced over at her father with the same expression. 	“She’s right, you know.  As glad as I would be to see you take off, there’s no way around it; someone is guaranteed to spot you.  I can’t let that happen.”  Then she smiled and laughed. 	“I knew you’d say that.  That’s why I have something else to show you...” 	She motioned them to follow her inside and she crawled in through the back door and once again into the washroom on the same level, her pajamas in claw.  She closed the door after pulling her tail inside, then opened it slightly again. 	“I’ll be right out, just hang on a second.”  Hence, her parents waited, much obliged, as she closed the door, turned on the heat lamp and donned her pajamas again; she emerged only seconds after she had closed the door and received a group hug from her parents. 	“I told you I knew what I was doing.  I’ve got it all figured out.  I just...” 	“Jan...” her mother interrupted. 	“Yeah?” 	“You’re going to be late if you don’t leave in the next five minutes, her father finished for her.  You’d better hurry and get dressed in your school clothes.” 	“All right, Dad.  I guess I’ll tell you guys about it tonight when you get home,” she said as she backed up the stairs to the main level of the house. 	“Run along.  You haven’t got much time, dear,” her mother added as she followed her up the stairs to the living room. 	“OK, Mom.”  She closed the door to her room and came out about a minute later, hurrying down the steps to the front door with her small backpack slung over her shoulder. 	“Bye, Mom, Dad!  See you tonight!” 	“Bye, honey.  Have a good day!”  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	It was the end of 6th period, Janet’s last class of the day, Calculus.  The professor seemed to be mumbling something about arctangents and sine functions, which was supposed to be review.  She sat in the back of the class and was sure that she wouldn’t be able to hear what he was saying, let alone see his small and intricate graphs and diagrams from the back of a class of thirty-six students.  She took the opportunity as he continued the lecture; he was writing on the whiteboard with his back turned. 	“Hey, Evelyn!” she whispered to the girl next to her.  “I have something really special to tell you...” 	Her dark ponytail made a large swinging motion as her head snapped to look at Janet. 	“What is it, Jan?  Don’t worry, I can’t hear him either.”  Evelyn had an ‘A’ in the class, but Janet wasn’t quite sure how she did it, seeing that she was usually a huge detriment to her study time in class.  Janet always told her all her little secrets, but this one would render all the others insignificant. 	“Jan?  What did you want to tell me?”  The phrase ‘special secret’ didn’t seem to affect her, because that was the way Janet had always referred to it. 	“Earth to Jan...  Didn’t you--?” 	“Oh, yeah.”  She looked around to make sure the teacher was still at the whiteboard.  “I’m warning you, though, Evelyn.  All the other secrets I’ve told you?” 	“Yeah?” 	“They’ll mean nothing once I tell you this...” Evelyn’s eyes went wide with excitement as they bent their heads closer.   5 	“No, I couldn’t tell you.  You’d never believe me,” Janet told her.  “Besides, how do I know that you won’t tell somebody out of jealousy or something?” 	“Jealousy?  What would make me so jealous?” Evelyn replied indignantly. 	“No.  I can tell that you aren’t ready for the truth...” 	“What?  Truth about what?  Why don’t you just--?” 	“All right, but I can’t tell you now.  Stop by my house after school sometime today, OK?” 	“OK.  Does five-thirty sound good?” 	“Yeah, all right.  I just thought it might be easier for you if I showed you.” 	“Yeah...  Then it’s settled, five-thirty.  See you then.” 	The bell rang and class was dismissed.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	Janet was walking home again.  It was a bit breezier than she thought it would be today.  She decided that she’d flip on the news to see what was up.  She tossed her bag onto her bed, then returned downstairs to watch the TV in the living room.  No sooner had she hit the news channel than the weather report was being discussed.  It had just turned four o’clock, so that explained it pretty well. 	 	An arctic cold front is moving in from the north, bringing increasingly lower temperature throughout the region as early as tonight in some areas... 	 	“So that’s why it’s so windy out there.  Wait, the winds are from the northeast, so that means that their carrying it here faster, which means that it could easily hit here by tonight...” 	A few moments after her voice trailed off, deep in thought, she suddenly remembered that Evelyn would be coming over to see her today.  She turned the TV off and quickly headed upstairs to write another quick note, knowing that as eager as she was, she would probably show up early.  She scrawled it out and taped it to the inside of the screen door, then she quickly set out toward the backyard to get ready.  She bit her lip as the winds blew by her.  It was cold and the thermometer on the wall outside was approaching the freezing mark, about 40°F right now.  It had never even come close to being this cold yesterday.  She quickly took off her clothes and hid them under some things inside a tote at the edge of the patio, then ran, shivering uncontrollably as the winds buffeted by, diving headlong into the pool as fast as she could. 	It was over.  She couldn’t feel the cold anymore.  She was now the familiar shade of pale green that she had only just discovered yesterday.  She thought of it as her half-dragon form; it was obvious when you compared it with this morning’s episode.  She tried to focus on clearing her thoughts, knowing in truth that she was aiming for a paradoxical achievement; she couldn’t focus if she was clearing her thoughts, now, could she?  It was hard for her this time.  The billowing winds outside clouded her mind, as if foreshadowing an event in the near future.  She had trouble blocking them out, but finally thrust them aside like the small omen they were, once again becoming the large beast that she was so fond of. 	“If only I could find a place to fly,” she thought.  “Then again, where would I go?”  She hadn’t thought much about this; it almost defeated the whole purpose, but she didn’t have to tell herself that.  Suddenly, her curiosities were interrupted by the familiar scratching of the gate on the side of the house, which could only mean one thing; Evelyn was here early as she suspected.  She overheard her having a conversation with herself. 	“...Really enjoying this, Jan.  First, I ring the doorbell and you won’t even answer the door.  Then, I open the screen door so I can look through the window only to see nothing.  Then, I find your stupid note on the door, telling me to come back here, and now, I don’t see anybody here, either.  Uurgh!  This makes me mad!  I’m just gonna go home...” 	Janet couldn’t help but giggle as she listened to her rant about lack of sufficient communication.  She stifled it quickly, wondering if she had heard.  There was silence, and then a faint movement in the grass near the patio. 	“God!  Now I’m hearing things!  Where are you, Jan?  Just wait’ll I get my hands on you!” 	It was too perfect.  Janet’s head rose out of the water and she waited, breathing softly, right behind Evelyn as she stood in front of the pool with her back turned, fists clenched in her exasperation.  She froze for a few moments, then trembled slightly as she felt Janet’s cold breath graze the back of her neck.  She turned her head slowly around, waiting until the very last second to look at her.  She was about to scream, but a swift claw covered her mouth as she stared, shivering and thunderstruck, into Janet’s piercing sapphire eyes. 	“It’s OK, Evelyn.  It’s just me, Janet.” 	No response; her eyes just got wider as Janet spoke. 	“Listen.  Remember when I told you I had a secret that would make all the others I’d told you irrelevant?  This is it.” 	Evelyn stopped trembling, but remained silent as Janet took her claw from her mouth. 	“I’m a dragon.  Well, not completely.  I’m a dragoness because I’m human, too.” 	Evelyn’s brow furrowed, as if she was almost seriously trying to comprehend the words Janet had just spoken.  Finally, she spoke. 	“So you were a d-dragon, all this time that I’ve k-known you and you didn’t t-tell me?” 	“No.  I just found out about all this yesterday after school; my birthday was yesterday.  Remember?” 	“Oh yeah...  S-so, what does your birthday have to d-do with all this, anyway?” 	“I don’t really know, but I’d assume that eighteen years is an important time in a dragon’s life or something.” 	“So can you t-transform or something at any time?” 	“Not any time.  I’m a water dragoness, hence, the swimming pool...” 	“...Yeah...  Why did you want to show me this?” 	“I thought you’d think it was cool.” 	“Well, it’s definitely what you might call...  I guess what I mean is exotic.” 	“Yeah, maybe you’re right.  Maybe I shouldn’t have shown you...” 	“No!  That’s not what I meant!” 	“Oh?  What did you mean?” Janet said, sounding rather hurt, although she thought that this was quite a sincere reaction to her intimidating appearance. 	“I guess what I meant was...  I don’t know much about it, about why?  You know?” 	“Yeah, I guess so.  Neither do I, but I like it; I really want to fly somewhere, but I can’t...” 	“Why not?”  Evelyn chimed in almost immediately, and rather enthusiastically. 	“Gee, why are you so excited?” 	“Oh...  I just thought...  If I asked really nicely...” 	“Yes?” Janet interrupted, expectantly. 	“...Oh, never mind.  You said you couldn’t go anyway...” 	“What?  Take you with me?” 	“Yeah!  Would you?”  Evelyn almost squealed with excitement as she said this. 	“I probably would, but I can’t go...” 	“Why?” she asked immediately. 	“Too many people.  Somebody would see me and that’s no good.” 	“I see what you mean...  Everyone in town would go ballistic.  You know; it’s getting awful cold out here.  Aren’t you cold?” 	“Never.  I’m...” 	“Yeah...  That’s right, you’re a water dragoness?  Did I say that right?” 	“Yep, but it is starting to get chilly.  Hey!  I want to try something.  Could you go and get some pop cans from the recycle bin in the garage?” 	“Huh?  What do you want with those?” 	“Never mind.  I’ll get them.” 	“Are you sure you’ll fit through the d-door?” Evelyn asked a bit apprehensively as Janet pulled herself out of the pool. 	“Already confirmed.  Done it about three times now...” 	“Right...  Do your parents know?”  She gulped slightly at the thought. 	“Actually, they do...  Took it quite well I’d say.  My mom cried for a bit, but she got over it.” 	“Sheesh!  She makes it sound like anyone could do it,” she said to herself as she watched Janet crawl through the side door to the garage.  All of a sudden, she became conscious of the neighbors around them.  She glanced around, finding to her relief that all the shades were drawn and few lights were on for the late afternoon.  It was still quite light outside, but the winds continued without end and Evelyn wrapped her arms tight around her jacket, trying to keep warm in the cold. 	Janet returned with the empty pop cans, three in each claw and another four held against her chest. 	“What are you going to do with those again?” 	“You’ll see,” she said as she stacked them gingerly in a pyramid on the flat bench on the patio.  “Here, come and hold the top with your finger so that they don’t fall over again.” She said this just as half of them fell off the bench with many tinny clink noises on the cement patio, then began stacking them up as Evelyn walked over to her to hold the cans. 	Janet stumped over to the pool and Evelyn watched as she bent down for a few seconds.  She wondered what she was doing.  Well, that was until she turned around and let a powerful jet of water erupt from her mouth, sending all but the can she was holding flying into the side of the house.  She still had a grip on the top can, although it was tilted at an odd angle in her two fingertips.  Janet giggled at the astonished expression on her face as she walked over to retrieve the drenched aluminum cans, then Evelyn joined in after a few seconds and helped her pick up the remainders.  Each was shaken vigorously, then placed back in the recycle bin. 	Janet opened the refrigerator and produced a can of root beer, which after much fumbling and clacking of claws, she managed to open.  Evelyn closed the side door because of the cold, then Janet motioned for her to go ahead and have one herself as she guzzled the contents of her own.  Evelyn couldn’t help but giggle as she bent down to reach a Mountain Dew® on the bottom shelf.  Janet eyed her rather questioningly as she topped off her soda. 	“What?” 	“No, it’s just really funny to see something as big as you, drinking out of a can no bigger than your eye socket!” 	“What did you say?” she asked, pretending to be insulted. 	“No!  No!  I didn’t mean that!  I was just...” 	Her words were cut off by the loudest belch either one of them had ever heard in their lives.  It shook the house and the large garage door rattled in its tracks.  After the reverberations receded, there were a few moments of silence.  This was broken by sudden fits of hysterical laughter from the both of them. 	“Oh, my God!  That was so funny, Janet!  That was you, wasn’t it?” 	“Yep.  I didn’t think it would come out.”  Evelyn started giggling again.  “What?  I’m serious!” 	“OK, OK, but I still can’t believe it was you.  That was hilarious!” 	“Yeah, whatever, it’s not really that funny anymore.” 	“Wait!  What time is it?” 	“Don’t look at me, Evelyn.  I almost never wear a watch.” 	“Yeah, OK,” she said as she ran to into the house and examined the clock on the mantle of the fireplace.  She gasped and hurried back into the garage. 	“It’s 7 o’clock!  I’ve gotta get outta here!  I’ll have to see you later.  Bye!” 	“All right, Ev.  See you tomorrow!” 	“Wait.  Hold up!  One question.  Aren’t your parents gonna flip if they can’t find you like this right away?” 	“No.  I thought I already told you; they know all about it.  Don’t worry about me.  If you have to go, then leave.  Well, then see ya!” 	“...OK.  Bye.”  She left out the side door and Janet poked her head outside just in time to see her drive away in her shiny silver VW Bug. 	She was alone now and she was pretty hungry.  She quickly went outside to retrieve her clothes from the tote.  Then she crawled inside to the washroom.  After a minute or so, she climbed up the short flight of stairs to the kitchen and pulled a box of macaroni and cheese and a pot out of the cupboard.  As she turned the stove on and poured in the noodles, she thought about how she’d go about showing everything to her parents. 	“I could just show up outside like last time, but it’s going to be too cold out there.  It might even be too cold for me.  Well, I don’t know about that until it happens, but I don’t want them to have to be outside...” 	Her thought trailed off and she fell silent for several minutes.  Her consciousness of reality was only stirred by the burbling of the pot, which was just starting to boil over.  She quickly turned off the heat and moved it to another burner, adding the cheese sauce as it slowly cooled.  She grabbed a bowl and a spoon and sat down at the dining room table to eat.  After about ten minutes, she had cleaned out the entire pot and washed the dishes.  She retreated to her room and looked at the calendar on the wall; it was way behind, the top bearing January and the last crossed-off day was the 29th.  She updated it, flipping it over after crossing off the remaining days, then slashing a few more weeks worth until she came to the 22nd box, which had the words ‘Jan’s 18th Birthday’ at the top.  She then crossed it off, leaving the message intact, as she had never done before.  She then took her diary from her dresser drawer.  Blowing off the dust revealed the custom gold-lettered navy blue cover and also gave evidence to the fact that she only wrote the most important things in it, which may have happened as frequently as monthly and as scarcely as once every three years.  It was easy to tell that she hadn’t written in it for a great amount of time.  She flipped to the last entry:  9:23 PM June 10th, 2007 	Dear Diary, 		I am 15 years of age.  Today I-- 	 	She stopped short; it was already embarrassing to look at the almost ungodly and tidy cursive script that she still used to use throughout her freshman year.  She didn’t need to further embarrass herself by reading the entry.  She seized a pen from the earthenware coffee mug atop her desk that held so many writing implements and other things, such as hole punchers, paper clips, pushpins, and other random trinkets she had found over the years.  After scratching it on an old admit slip, she began to write yesterday’s events on the adjacent page.  8:47 PM February 22nd, 2010 	Dear Diary, 		I am now 18 years of age.  I feel that what happened today will change the rest of my life forever...  	She continued writing in her neat manuscript for another twenty minutes; it was by far, the longest of all the entries she had written in the book.  All of the others were only single-page if not, half-page entries while this one was two-and-a-half.  She added the last period and placed it back in her drawer. 	Looking at the clock on her nightstand, her eyes widened and she dashed out of the room to get ready; it was 8:40 and she was sure that her parents would be here in an hour or so.  She walked briskly out to the pool, the cold billowing winds sweeping by her face.  It was getting very cold outside.  She undressed and slipped into the pool.  She had become very good at clearing her mind of thoughts by now.  She pulled her head out of the water and gazed at her rippling reflection on the surface.  Her sapphire eyes and pale blue skin gleamed in the light of the moon as the winds came to an abrupt halt and ceased to exist. 	The air was very still now and Janet saw frost begin to encompass her father’s well-kept lawn.  After a few minutes, there was a thick blanket of frost covering the whole of the backyard.  Small wisps of vapor began to rise from the pool where she was standing and she started to shiver in the cold open air.  She submerged herself once again, feeling more comfortable in the icy-cold water.  She lay in silence, watching the stars begin to appear through the thin film of the slowly rippling water.  Then, the surface ceased to move any longer; it was frozen, and that’s when it happened again. 	She was taken totally by surprise this time.  The water no longer felt cold.  Instead, it felt extremely comfortable.  Her skin began to harden and the scales seemed to freeze all over her body, becoming like hard plates; it felt like she was wearing some insanely strong armor.  She prodded one of the protruding scales with her claw; she didn’t feel a thing.  It was as if the nerves had frozen over, however, she could feel her arms and claws when they moved.  Then she grew again, although only slightly.  She felt her muscles strengthen greatly and her claws became sharper.  Even her wings had hardened, even more so than the rest of her body.  They were like sheets of steel upon her back.  Her tail lengthened and hardened until it seemed more like a long, sweeping whip than anything else.  She tore away the thick sheet of ice at the edge of the pool just as a lion would rip drapes down from a curtain rod, then clambered out to stand on the now frostbitten grass. 	She brought her head up and could easily see into her parents’ second-story bedroom window.  She looked about at the neighboring houses; there was no one in sight.  She looked down at the hard, spiky frozen scales that swept downward, covering her legs.  Her breath was visible and cold steam came pouring out her mouth every few seconds.  She felt great, as if she were strong enough to pull the house from its very foundation, one corner at a time.  She must have been at least twenty feet tall, then she realized that this was a major problem; there was no way she could get inside the house to change back again. 	“Oh, great, Jan.  Now you’ve done it; you can’t change back now.”  She started sweating, or at least she would have been sweating if her body temperature wasn’t below thirty under.  Then she suddenly felt thirsty, as ironic as it seemed.  She tore away the rest of the ice sheet that covered the pool and bent down to take a drink.  As the water slid down her icy throat, it seemed to thicken as it collected in her stomach, coating her insides and make her tingle there as it seemed to freeze over.  She came to think otherwise after she sighed while gazing at her frozen face’s reflection; her breath froze the surface of the water, leaving large crystalline spikes of ice at the edge.  Her eyes widened and she smiled knowingly. 	“So this is what it’s all about...  But why?  What’s the purpose of all this?”   6 	It was 9 o’clock and Janet still had to do her homework.  Actually, this was only a minor concern that was seen as a nondescript piece of something when compared to her present problem; she was too big to get inside the house without ripping out half of the entire back wall on the first floor.  She began thinking rather frantically; she was positive that her parents would flip if they saw her, even though they had experienced a similar situation this morning.  She had a feeling that it would be too much of a change for them in one day; they’d completely freak out.  She scanned the perimeter of the backyard and pictured the contents of the tool shed that sat in the far corner of the yard, (which was almost in her reach no matter where she stood out here) against the high wooden fences.  There was nothing she could use to produce any heat.  Then, she remembered. “Dad keeps a blowtorch in the garage somewhere...”  She quietly tromped over to the side door, bent down, and peeked through the door, which she had left open after she had watched Evelyn leave earlier.  She couldn’t see anything because the light was turned off.  She backed out and poked the switch up carefully, trying very hard not to scratch anything with her diamond-hard claw.  She withdrew her claw and slowly slid her long neck through the doorway and looked about once again.  It was nowhere in sight and she figured that it was probably in one of his cabinets. 	“Dang, I needed that...  Uurgh!”  She pulled her head out quickly in frustration, causing a hardened scale on the back of her neck to catch the top of the metal doorframe. Two things happened.  One, the door frame received a deep gash down the inner side and two, the tip of her scale broke off, causing her to wince only slightly.  She quickly turned around to look, cursing silently and saw it freeze to a sharp point once again.  She turned her head around again and looked up at the doorframe, then gasped as she saw the huge cut in the metal.  Fortunately, it was only aluminum and wasn’t too expensive to replace.  Nonetheless, her father wouldn’t be too happy about it, no matter the cost.  She decided that she’d lay on the ground and wait for her parents to arrive.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	A few less than twenty minutes later, the sliding glass door opened, startling Janet from her slumber.  Her eyes shot open, but she didn’t move.  Her parents were probably looking at her now, jaws dropping, possibly with tears flowing.  She closed her eyes at the thought.  Her sad feelings were shattered by a voice. 	“Hi, Janet...”  It was her father, and he was right next to her. 	“I couldn’t help but notice; it’s a little chilly out here isn’t it?  What happened to you?” 	Janet brought her head around and looked at her father through her, cold and glassy sapphire eyes. 	“That’s why, Dad.  It’s cold out here, but not just cold.  Did you look at the thermometer?  It’s below freezing and that’s why I’m like this.  I was just out here taking a nap when...” 	“I think I understand, honey.”  There was a small gasp from the patio after the door opened and closed again; it was her mother.  She slowly trotted through the frost-covered grass, holding her scarf tight about her neck with one hand and covering her mouth with the other.  She joined Janet’s father, but remained speechless by his side as her eyes watered slightly at the sight they beheld.  Janet closed her eyes sadly, but her mother shook her head back and forth in a subtle gesture as she started. Janet could have sworn she heard her whisper, “No, it’s all right...” She opened her eyes again and smiled a bit sheepishly, her crystalline teeth sparkling in the dim moonlight. 	Her mother bent her head close and her father and whispered audibly, “What are we going to do?  She can’t get inside the house...” 	“I don’t know.  Maybe...” 	“Dad...” 	“Yes?” 	“The blowtorch, in the garage?  I couldn’t get it.  Could you?” 	“What?  For you?” 	“Yeah...  I don’t know, but it’s worth a try.” 	“What are you playing at, Janet?  That’s for cutting metal, not a defroster!” 	“What?  You think I’d melt or something?” 	“Uh, yeah...” 	“OK, watch.” 	She sat up in the grass and pried a frozen scale from her tail, then held her tail in front of her parents’ faces as it regenerated.  Both pairs of eyes widened greatly as they witnessed the feat. 	“How did you know that?” 	An uneasy look came over Janet’s face. 	“Well, one broke off when I was looking in the garage...” 	“And...” 	“It kind of cut the top of the door frame when I came out...”  She hurriedly found a spot on the ground to stare at. 	“Oh, great...” 	“Hey, relax.  It was an accident.” 	“Yeah, OK, but just how bad is this accident?” 	“Maybe you’d better go look.” 	“Maybe I should.”  He turned and started walking to the side door. 	“Maybe you shouldn’t,” she said quickly behind him.  He didn’t stop, nor answer her again.  He walked through the doorway and turned to look up at the long, but narrow cut in the aluminum.  Janet would have crossed her fingers if she had any, so instead she hid her head with her clawed hands and spread her large wings in front of her, preparing for him to shout at her. 	“It’s not as bad as I thought it would be.”  She retracted her wings slightly and peeked through her hands, a glint of salvation shining in her eye. 	“Nope, definitely not as bad under the circumstances.  As a matter of fact, I may be able to fix it...”  Janet would have jumped up and down, whooped and hollered if it weren’t for the fact that everyone in the neighborhood would have heard her and a decent majority of anyone nearby would have seen her, even from the streets. 	“...But I’m afraid I’m going to need this blowtorch to fix it,” he said, coming out of the garage and waving it about, smiling. 	“Joseph...  It’s really cold out here.  Can’t you get the rest of us inside first?” Janet’s mother asked him rather sternly.  Janet never remembered her speaking to him like that before.  She seemed almost menacingly annoyed at his antics this time.  He gawked at her and slowly stopped waving the blowtorch around. 	“Well?  If she wants the thing, let her use it.” 	There was the same tone in her voice again.  He complied, suddenly looking as though it was the best thing to do in the world, handing Janet the blow torch and running back to the garage to plug it in.  When he came back, he urged her on, as if he was waiting to see the greatest performance on Earth. 	“Well?  Go on.” 	“You better do it, Dad.  There’s no way I can turn that little knob.” 	“Oh, all right.  What do you want me to do?” 	“Burn my head.”  He stared at her in amazement just before he was going to turn it on. 	“Excuse me?” 	“Only for a little bit.  What?” 	“OK...  Where?” 	“On the top, right between my eyes.” 	“Whatever you say...”  There was a short pause as he clicked it on and moved it toward her head, her eyes closed. 	She recoiled as it came close and her frigid breath iced over the grass just to the left side of him.  She stared at him and laughed half-heartedly at the astonished expression on his face. 	“Sorry...  I guess I wasn’t expecting it.  Try again; I’ll be ready this time.” 	He nodded his head slightly; he was still bearing his wide eyes, then shook the expression from his face and tried again.  Her nerves screamed for but a fraction of a second as she fought to control her reaction, but it was over before she knew it and she fell unconscious.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	Janet awoke in the den.  She had been laying down, curled up in the center of the room.  She wondered how her parents had moved her; she was still in her water dragon form.  Her mother entered the room and Janet lifted her head to look at her, only for it to fall back down to the floor with a soft thump. 	“You should rest,” her mother told her.  “You had quite an experience.” 	“What...happened?  Why...am I so tired?” 	“Well, your father accidentally scalded your forehead and you have a pretty bad burn.  It should take a while to heal.” 	“What...time is it?” 	“It’s a bit after midnight, dear.  I think it should heal soon.  You should probably just rest right now.  We’ll worry about getting you to school when that time comes.  Here, I’ll bring you a warm washcloth...” 	“Wait...” 	“Oh, did I say warm?  I meant ice cold.  Silly me.” 	“Mom...” 	“Yes?” 	“How...did you...get me in here?” Janet asked as her mother placed the washcloth over her head. 	“It took us a while, but your father and I brought you inside...  Well, we kind of had to push you inside, but...” 	“Good night...Mom...” 	“All right.  You rest up, so you can go to school this morning, OK?” 	“Yeah...”  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	Janet’s head shot up as she woke that morning.  Something was bothering her; her dreams, which she quite infrequently remembered, stayed with her this morning.  She closed her eyes briefly and reenacted the scene in her head: 	 In the backyard...  Looking at a window...  Which window?  ...The Carltons...  There was someone there...  Who was it?  ...No...  Not him... 	There was a sudden intake of breath and her eyes grew wide with fear. 	“Little Jimmy Carlton saw me last night.  I know it!” 	Her mind raced, searching for a solution to this problem and she continued to stare in shock at the wall. 	“Oh, great!  What am I going to do?” she said out loud, panic stirring in her voice. 	“Wait!  Wait.  Calm down, Jan.  Just think.  OK...  I know this guy pretty well.  He’s only 4 years old, which would lead me to think that his parents would never believe him, but...  He’s extremely gifted in the art of persuasion.  He’ll probably just go, Mommy, pleeeeeease?  I saw it!  It was really big!  Honest, Mommy!  Pleeeeeeease, will you believe me?  Then, the worst thing of all, the dreaded I’ll show you!  You’ll see!  Then he’ll wind up coming over here to try and prove it.  However, he doesn’t even know that it was me because his bedroom is on the first floor.  So I shouldn’t need to worry about him unless I’m in the backyard when he comes over.  Well, first things first.  I need to go tell Mom and Dad about him...” 	As she rose to her feet, she bumped her head on the ceiling, forgetting that she was still a dragon.  It really stung this time, though; she had also forgotten about the burn on her head.  She looked in the mirror in the washroom; it had appeared to have healed considerably from what her mother had given her as a description last night, but it was still visible as a decently-sized gray bruise on her head.  Then something hit her; it would probably still be there, even if she transformed. 	“Lovely,” she said to herself after she turned the lamp on, put on her clothes and looked in the mirror again.  Now it was about two shades redder than her skin color, which made it look like a large boil.  Although it was relatively vertically challenged from the surface, it spanned across most of her forehead.  She quickly removed the scrunchie from her ponytail and brushed her bangs out.  They covered the vast majority of her forehead, but if someone were to look closely enough, they could easily spot it.  She glanced at the wall clock; it was 6:00.  Her parents would probably come down to wake her in another half-hour or so.  Then she remembered that she hadn’t done her calculus homework last night.  She didn’t write the page and problem numbers down, either.  She decided to call Evelyn on her cell phone. 	...RRRRING...RRRRING... “Come on...” ...RRRRING...  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	The phone rang a third time and Evelyn snatched it from her nightstand.  She looked at the number. 	“Janet?” she said to herself.  She picked it up and answered. 	“Hello?” 	“Hi, Evelyn.  It’s me.  I needed...” 	“Why are you calling me at six in the morning?” 	“That’s what I’m trying to tell you.  I need the...” 	“You know; I had a funny dream about you last night.” 	“...Really?  What was it?” 	“You changed again, and then I saw you over the fence, through the window of some house...  It was really weird...” 	“Indeed.  Hey, I was wondering what the math assignment was last night.  You got it, right?” 	“What are you talking about?” 	“Huh?” 	“We didn’t have a math assignment yesterday.” 	“I thought for sure...” 	“You must’ve been hearing things when we were talking because I asked him after class and he said there wasn’t any homework.” 	“Do you think he saw us talking back there?” 	“What does that have to do with anything?” 	“If he did, he may just not be giving it to us because we weren’t paying attention.” 	“Honestly, Jan.  Have you ever seen something show up on your grade report that you had absolutely no idea about?” 	“No, but you never know.  Maybe...” 	“No, Jan.  Hey, what do you think that weird dream meant?” 	“Well, should the truth be told, I did change again last night.” 	“Seriously?  Whoa, so you were all spiky and stuff?” 	“Yeah.  Did you see anything else?” 	“No.  I just remember seeing your head and neck poking over the fence.  I think you may have looked in my direction once, but I don’t know if you saw me.” 	“You have no idea how relieved I am to hear you say that.” 	“What are you talking about?  Did I miss something in all this?” 	“No, I just haven’t told you yet.” 	“So, what’s up?” 	“You were the little Carlton kid that lives next door to me.” 	“What?” 	“Yeah, I’m positive.  I went to sleep last night and had the same dream, but it was from my perspective, of course.  I saw the little boy peeking through the window for only maybe a split-second, but I took no note of it.” 	“Whoa!  So are we like telepathic or something?” 	“Dunno, but I’ve gotta do something about that little kid.  Knowing him, he’s going to tell his parents.” 	“They’ll never believe him.” 	“Yeah, that’s what you think.  The kid is so spoiled that he’d probably get them to believe anything.  Sooner or later, he’s going to persuade them to come over here looking for a dragon. 	“That’s no good, but wait!  He doesn’t know it’s you.  The only reason I knew it was you is because you showed me, but he has no idea!” 	“Yeah, but I still gotta be careful if his parents come over and let him snoop around.  I need to tell my parents about it before he comes looking for me.” 	“You’re right.  Geez, little kids are so much trouble.” 	“Yeah, but what if he was like 14 instead of 4?  Then we’d have a real problem.” 	“Yeah, well, I need to go pack my stuff; it’s 6:15, so I’ll see you later today, all right?” 	“OK, see ya then.” 	“Bye.”  Janet hung up the phone and sat back down on the couch in the living room.  Her mother came down the stairs a few minutes later to make coffee. 	“Hi, Jan.  How did you sleep?” 	“Pretty well, but the burn hasn’t healed all the way.” 	“I see; you let your bangs down.  That’s about all you can do, but it’ll go away soon, I’m sure.” 	“Yeah...  Is Dad up yet?” 	“He’ll be down here soon.” 	“I needed to tell you guys something pretty important.”  Her father came down the stairs also, just as she said this. 	“Yes, Jan?  What did you need?” he inquired, sounding sleepy. 	“Please, go on,” her mother added.  Janet paused for a few moments before answering. 	“It’s the little Carlton kid next door; he knows...”   7 	“So little Jimmy next door saw you?” Janet’s father asked. 	“How do you know?” her mother added. 	“I just do, Janet protested.  Well, I mean, I had a weird dream about last night and for just a split-second, I saw him in his bedroom window.  I just didn’t ever remember actually seeing him, though.” 	“I think you make some mighty big assumptions for someone your age,” her mother remonstrated. 	“Well, it does seem a little far-fetched, but maybe you’re right.”  Her father’s remark was immediately followed by a stern gaze from her mother. 	“Why can’t you ever totally agree with me about anything?” 	“I don’t know.  It just makes things more interesting, I guess,” he replied, trying his hardest not to smile. “Uurgh!  Men...” 	“Yeah, OK.  You guys, I need you to just keep an eye out for him, because knowing him, he’ll probably be over here for a visit sometime today.” 	“OK, honey.  You’d better get ready for school.  Go on, I’ll take care of him,” her father called after her as she ran up the stairs to get ready. 	“My, aren’t we quite supportive this morning?  Joseph, some of this stuff you’re going to have to question.  You can’t...” 	“Well?  I’m just trying to support our daughter and help her with what she’s going through.  Isn’t that what every parent is supposed to do? 	“Yes, but because you support her so much, you make me seem like the bad guy whenever I question her judgment.” 	“OK, I see what you’re saying...  Still, I was only trying to help.  I don’t know.  Maybe you should go and talk to her before she leaves.” 	“I’ll do that.”  Her mother climbed the stairs and knocked on Janet’s door. 	“Are you almost ready?” 	“Yeah, Mom.” 	“Can I come in?” 	“Sure.  What’s up?” 	“I’m just wondering if you were intending to have us fend off this kid just because you have the slightest inkling that he might cause you some trouble.  Am I right?” 	“Couldn’t have said it better myself, Mom,” she replied with a smile as she rose to go to the door. 	“Now, wait a second.” 	“Yeah?” 	“Just how sure are you that he was the kid?” “Well, so far I’m battin’ a thousand, so keep the pitches coming!” 	“OK.  Well, you have a good day at school.” 	“All right.  Bye, Mom.” 	As she headed down the stairs, she gave her father a thumbs-up to tell him that everything went OK. 	“Bye, honey.  See you tonight.  What is it, Wednesday?  Geez, this week is really dragging by...” 	“Bye, Dad.” 	She closed the front door behind her and made her way down the long driveway that was very characteristic of flag lots.  It was still a little cold this morning. 	“Winter must be getting in the last few words...” she said quietly.  She admired the fall most of all.  The autumn leaves that flicker in golden shades as they make their twirling descent to the ground; this was her most favorite thing to see in the fall, but that season had long hence passed.  It would be springtime in but a couple fortnights and she sighed as she looked about at the trees, most of which had no leaves at all and none were reminiscent of her favorite season.  Nevertheless, she continued walking to school. 	“I wish it could be fall forever, sometimes...”  Her voice trailed off and before she knew it, the high school had already loomed into view.  The last time she had taken her eyes from the ground, she was just leaving the neck of the large court where her house was.  She walked briskly to the front door and made her way through the long halls to her locker, where she met Evelyn. 	“Hey, what’s up?” she asked.  “Are you feeling all right?” 	“Yeah, I’m OK.  It’s just a seasonal thing.” 	“...I’m lost.  What do you mean?” 	“I just want it to be fall again...”  She sighed softly as she began entering the combination for her locker. 	“Oh!  That kind of seasonal thing.  I thought you had the flu or something.” 	“No...  What’s this?”  She had just found a note on top of all her books inside her locker. 	“Huh?”  Evelyn was just as curious. 	“Oh, great.  It’s from Brett.  It’s about time; that’s the first time this year.”  Brett Johnson had been picking on her ever since she was a freshman, which she found really disturbing, especially since she was a girl.  He had beat her up twice, for which he got suspended for a few weeks, and he had also verbally sexually harassed her a decent number of times, as well, spending almost a week’s worth of days in Saturday school.  The worst part, though, was that he didn’t seem to care about being punished.  He had yet to show his face this year. 	“Yeah, Janet.  What does it say?” 	“Here, I’ll read it.”  	Janet, 		Meet me after school in the park.  I wanna talk to you...  4 o’clock sharp, and if you don’t show, I’ll come and find you tomorrow.  See ya. 							Brett 	 	“You know; I’m beginning to think that this guy is possessed or something.  It’s like he wants your head on his wall.  It’s really kind of scary.” 	“Yeah...” 	“So are you gonna show up like he said?” 	“What are you talking about?  Of course I will!” 	“I’m sorry!  Please don’t hit me...” 	“No, it’s just so obvious.  You do know what’s going to happen when I meet him there, don’t you?” 	“...Oh, I almost forgot.  Heh, heh...” 	“Yeah, but first I’m going see if he’s even gonna show up.”  A sort of wicked sarcastic smile spread over her face and both of them started giggling as they pulled their books out and headed to class.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	1st period found Janet and Evelyn in their English class.  They finished their cumulative vocabulary test and glanced at the teacher; she was sitting at her desk, grading those papers that had already been handed in.  They were supposed to partake in silent reading, but they passed notes back and forth, instead. 	 	Ev, 		What do you think I should do to him first?  I don’t want to kill him, just louse him up a bit. 	I don’t know.  You’re going to have to come up with that.  What if he doesn’t show? 	Then he’ll come and find me, remember? 	Yeah, but what if you’re in the hall here at school? 	Then I’ll tell him we need to take it outside. 	And what if he doesn’t buy it? 	Then, I’ll beat him up. 	But how?  He’s twice your size. 	God, stop asking me questions.  He’ll probably show up after school today... 	But what if he doesn’t? 	What if?  What if?  If it happens, I’ll figure it out then, when it does. 	OK, but I still don’t know what you’re going to do if he doesn’t show today. 	I’ll figure something out, but only if it actually happens. 	OK, OK.  I was just concerned.  I’ll let you take care of it. 	Don’t worry about me.  I’ll sort it out. 	OK, Janet, but still be careful. 	Gotcha.  	The bell rang and Evelyn pocketed the notes as they left, lest anyone read them.  Neither one of them got a chance to see each other until their 6th period math class.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	The bell rang and class started.  The teacher discussed the lesson and handed out a few worksheets for practice.  Janet and Evelyn talked again as they worked. 	“You know, I was wondering during lunch.  What if he doesn’t want to fight you when you get there?  He said he just wanted to talk, after all.” 	“Yeah, but I wouldn’t trust him as far as I could throw him.” 	“Actually, I would think that to be pretty far, Janet.” 	“I mean right now, you goof.  He’s just trying to make me feel better about him because he hasn’t attacked me for the entire year, so far.  I still don’t believe him.” 	“Yeah, maybe you’re right...” 	“Of course I’m right!  This guy’s a creep!” “Shh...  Calm down.”  A rather reproving glance from the teacher made her smile sort of sheepishly and she toned it down a bit. 	“What’s gotten into you, Janet?  It’s like you’re having major mood swings or something.” 	“No, it’s just that I really want to kick this guy’s butt.  That’s all.  It would be so funny to see the look on his face...  Hey, do you want to come and watch?” 	“Janet!”  Evelyn sounded very indignant.  “I can’t believe you want me to watch you and some kid fight each other!  Actually, it might be kind of cool...” 	“Now who’s having mood swings?” 	“Shut up.  I’m just trying to decide...  Nah, I can’t.  I’ve gotta baby-sit for one of my friends’ kids.” 	“Man, I thought for sure you’d come and watch...  Oh, well.  Hey, are you done?” 	“What are you talking about?” 	“The worksheets.  Are you finished?” 	“Oh, yeah.  I finished them up just a bit ago.  And you?” 	“Nah, I’m gonna have to finish mine at home.  I got one of them done, though.  Come on, Evelyn.  Don’t you want to see me kick him around and stuff?” 	“Well, maybe...  I just...” 	“Hey, wait a sec!  I thought you just said that you had to baby-sit.  Evelyn?” 	“...” 	“Just as I thought.  You and your excuses.  Geez!  So why don’t you wanna come?” 	“It’s just that...  Well, I don’t want to...  You know...” 	“Don’t tell me.  You don’t wanna go anywhere near him?” 	“Yeah.  Isn’t that justified enough for you?  That guy’s scary.” 	“Yeah, OK, but I still think you should come.  It’s gonna be awesome.” 	“Uh-huh, but you’ve got to remember who we’re dealing with here.” 	“We?  Hey, I’m the one who has to fight him.  Come on, Ev.  It couldn’t hurt to watch, could it?” 	“No...”  She froze and stared off into space.  The bell rang and she didn’t move. 	“What’s up with you, Evelyn?” 	“Oh, nothing.  It’s just that I’ve never gone to a park just to see a fight...” 	“Right...  You better grab your stuff; the bell rang.” 	“Oh, right.” 	“Yeah, see you at quarter to four, then, I guess.  You are coming aren’t you?” 	“OK.  Quarter to four?” 	“Yeah, I’ve gotta get ready, right?” 	“Uh-huh.  See ya then.” 	“Bye.”  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	Janet rushed up the stairs to her room.  She was really excited.  She sat down on her bed and closed her eyes, envisioning Brett as he walked into a small clearing, deep in the woods, to meet her.  It was too good to resist; it was payback time.   8 	It was 3:15 and Janet changed into a tanktop and sweatpants.  She opened her backpack and took out her math book.  Setting it on the bed, she grabbed a CD from its case and popped it into her player.  She also disconnected it from the wall and put the C-size batteries back inside.  She pulled her binder from her backpack before stowing the CD player inside and she donned her letterman jacket, which she had earned for swimming her freshman and sophomore years.  She took it in her hands and looked at it for a moment. 	“You know, I’m almost seriously considering doing that again...  But then again, maybe that wouldn’t be very wise...” 	She would look very silly, being the only one without her head in the water.  Or she would look very silly, being the only one that was a dragon.  Although she had to admit that she would be the only dragon that was finished with the race in half the time it took everyone else, but then it wouldn’t be very much of a sport anymore. 	“Oh, well.  Maybe I could swim somewhere else...”  She gazed off into space for a short while, thinking of where she would go. 	“Oh, better get going!”  It was 3:30 when she left, backpack in hand.  She slung it over her shoulder and quickly made her way to the park.  She arrived in plenty of time for Evelyn, though, who strolled in at ten to four. 	“I said quarter to four, Evelyn!  What if he shows up early, too?” 	“Come on, Jan.  Give me a break.  I live like two miles from here.” 	“Yeah, but you have a car.” 	“Oh, yeah.  That’s right, isn’t it?  Silly me.” 	“Yeah, OK.  I want you to do something for me while you’re here, OK?” 	“Name it.”  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	Sure enough, Brett showed up at a minute past four and he smiled at her rather wickedly. 	“Let’s find a place where no one’ll hear you scream.”  Much to his surprise, Janet smiled back with the same sort of grin. 	“Yes.  Let’s.”  It took him a minute to take in what she had said, but he just smiled even wider and chuckled to himself. 	“You’ve gotta be kidding me.  All right big shot.  Let’s go before I decide to pound your face in right now!” 	It was strange, the way he talked to her, like she was a boy.  She strode purposefully into the park, keeping a wary eye on him as they left the boundary of the park and entered the thick forest on the opposite side.  She heard him start chuckling to himself again, which evidently meant that he thought the place would suit his needs well.  They came out of the thick woods to a small clearing with a narrow ravine at the edge.  The sound of gently flowing water was all that could be heard in the clearing.  She stopped in the clearing and turned around to see him emerge from the trees, still bearing the wicked smile from before.  A small rustling in the bushes alarmed him and he turned to find the source.  He saw nothing, however, and turned back to face Janet.  Janet knew that this was Evelyn and she made a small signal behind her back to let her know to get set up.  Janet and Brett stood facing each other in the clearing for a while.  Janet remembered that she still had her jacket on.  She quickly unbuttoned it and set at the edge of the clearing, then resumed her position. 	“Come on.  Let’s go already!”  Brett’s temper was rising faster than Janet had really expected and he began advancing toward her.  She concentrated and readied herself as he charged.  Soon he was upon her and he shoved her down the ground, but she was ready.  She pushed off the ground with her feet as she fell backwards and started a backflip.  Her plan was to land in the narrow, but deep river below, but she short-changed the landing and slipped as her feet hit edge of the small ravine.  That wasn’t so bad because she lost her balance and fell in anyway, just glimpsing Brett’s snickering face about ten feet from the edge as she went down.  She hit the water and quickly pulled off her tanktop and sweatpants and hurled them against the side on the opposite shore.  The current was carrying her downstream quickly, but she cleared her thoughts as she dove into the water and she was able to swim back upstream in less time than it took to carry her down.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	Evelyn was watching the brink of the ravine.  The CD player was already on and she was waiting for the signal once again.  She began to worry as Brett started walking toward the edge. 	“Hurry, Jan!” she whispered to herself as she continued to watch.  Brett was about three feet from the drop-off when a large set of claws reached up and gripped the edge firmly.  Evelyn pushed the play button excitedly and watched as Brett backed away and looked up in horror.  The theme from The Pirates of the Caribbean began to play very loudly as Janet pulled herself up from the ravine. 	“I’m gonna make you wish you were never born!” Jan yelled as she stood up to full height in front of him.  He was still looking up at her in shock, and he had taken absolutely no notice when the music had come on. 	“No way...  I’m outta here!” he said in disbelief and he turned to run.  He was too late.  Janet reached around and tripped him up her long sweeping tail, causing him to fall on his face. 	“How do you like it now?” she asked him as she slowly advanced on him.  He tried to get up and make a run for it again, but she seized him in both claws, turning him around to face her as he was held up nine feet in the air. 	“Put me down!  I swear I’ll never do it again!  Honest!” 	“Well, maybe this’ll help you remember not to!”  She lifted him up so they were eye to eye and she found his forehead forcefully with her hard skull.  His head hung in front of him as he dangled from a height of sixteen feet in the air, unconscious.  Then she lowered him down and let him lay on the ground in the clearing to think about it for a while. 	Evelyn turned the CD player off and emerged from the thick undergrowth.  She was biting her entire lower lip as though she was trying very hard not to suddenly burst out laughing.  Her eyes looked on the verge of tears as she held it in. 	“Hey, Evelyn!  I’m not done yet!  Just watch!”  She quickly resumed her position, jogging back in a rather silly fashion as if she was seriously going to bust a gut.  Janet turned back and looked at Brett, who was still out cold in the thick grass.  It was getting colder as the day wore on into the late afternoon.  She winked at Evelyn in the bushes and a huge jet of water erupted from her mouth, striking Brett right in the face.  He came to immediately and it didn’t take him more than a second to remember where he was. 	“What do you w-want from me?” he asked her, his voice full of fear. 	“Actually, that’s what I’ve been wanting to ask you!  All these years, what is it?” 	“You’re really s-scarin’ me, Janet!  I’m gettin’ outta here!” 	“Not so fast, bud!  I wanna know what the hell you want from me!”  She snatched him by his shirt collar and pulled him around to face her.  He sat there, looking horrified, and gawked at her with his neck craned, her claw about his shoulder.  He didn’t say anything; just stared. 	“Well?”  There was a tone of menace in her voice, which gave him a slight clue that she was a little cheesed off.  However, his ego found him again and it got the best of him. 	“What are you, anyway?”  Janet seized him with both claws and shook him in front of her face, baring her sharp set of teeth.  Then her voice took on a softer tone as she held him in the air once again. 	“I’m a dragon, in case you couldn’t see with your own eyes!  I could almost make a meal out of you right now, so I would lend an ear or two!” 	“Good point,” he said in a small voice as his eyes fell upon her pearly-whites, which she had just clacked open and closed in one swift motion. 	“What the heck is your problem?  Why have you been harassing me for the last three years?” 	“...’Cause I thought I could get away with it,” he said rather stupidly, as if it was the best answer he could possibly come up with. 	“Well, some say that it all comes back to bite you in the end, eh?  Or am I not making myself clear?” 	“Heh, heh...  Crystal.”  He somehow managed a very weak smile. 	“Then I shouldn’t be seeing any more of your little notes, which you so cleverly stuffed through the little vents on my locker?” 	“Yeah...” 	“I trust that you’ll make the right decision and never bother me again so that I won’t have to hurl you up into a tree next time, right?” 	“...Uh-huh...” 	“Then go home and don’t go crying to your little friends, you hear me?” 	“Yep!”  She set him down and he did the first thing she expected him to do, run for his life. 	“Well, I think I took care of him.  What do you think, Evelyn?” 	“That was absolutely hilarious!”  She paused for a moment before she spoke again. 	“What’s wrong?” 	“For some reason, I don’t think he’s going to quit.” 	“But...” 	“Yes.  Even after all that.  It’s just not in his heart to stop.  I can sense it; he’s going to plague you for the rest of your life.” 	“But why--?” 	“You better get used to these things, Janet.  Sometimes that’s just the way it is.  You saw how he ran off, didn’t you?” 	“He can try, but he won’t if I can help it.” 	“Yeah...  You know; the funny thing that still puzzles me is the lack of severity in his reaction to such abnormality...” 	“...In English?” 	“...Oh!  That just means that I was surprised that he didn’t go completely berserk and shrivel up into a hundred-pound little nerd or something when he saw you.” 	“...Right...”  Then a thought occurred to her. 	“Uh, Evelyn?” 	“Yeah?” 	“How am I gonna change back?” 	“Good question.”  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	Meanwhile, at Janet’s house, the doorbell rang. 	“I’ll get it,” her mother called to her father as she strode to answer the door.  “Wait a minute.  What if it’s that little kid?  You better come here too then, dear.” 	“OK.  Are you ready?” 	“Not really, but just pretend like you have no idea what he’s talking about, right?” 	“Right.”  Her mother opened the door to a smiling Jimmy Carlton, accompanied by his mother, who wore a rather reluctant and sheepish grin on her face.  Janet’s father was the first to speak. 	“Hey, Jimmy.  What can I do for you?”  It was amazing how quickly youngsters could get to the point. 	“Where’s the dragon?”  Both of Janet’s parents immediately donned blank looks and exchanged glances. 	“What are talking about, Jimmy?” Janet’s father asked him with a kind of quizzical stare. 	“You know what I’m talking about!  The one that was in your guys’ backyard last night, remember?”  His patience was quickly diminishing.  Janet’s parents exchanged glances once again, with sheepish expressions and nodded slightly to each other in an ‘Oh, crud’ sort of way. 	“Umm...  S-sh-she...” her father started. 	“What?  What did you say?”  Jimmy was getting more and more impatient by the second and his mother was very red in the face right now. “I was saying ‘Shh, you don’t need to be so loud.’” 	“You don’t want the neighbors to think something’s wrong, do you?” Janet’s mother chimed in. 	“I don’t care.  I know you guys know about this.  Where is he?” 	“...H-he’s not here right now, you see...” 	“Why?” 	“Well, he has to go eat, see?  And...” 	“And?” 	“...And he goes hunting for a long time...  And he won’t come back for another week or so...” 	“Why does he have to be gone so long?” 	“Because...”  As Janet’s father kept answering Jimmy’s endless set of questions, Janet’s mother shrugged her shoulders and gave Mrs. Carlton a weak smile, shaking her head.  It was an equally shared feeling as expressed by her red face and return of similar gestures.  Then Janet’s mother made a small sweeping motion with her hand as though she were pushing something aside.  Mrs. Carlton nodded and looked as though she’d be much obliged. 	“Jimmy, I know you want to know about the dragon or whatever it was that you saw over here, but it’s time to go home.” 	“...But what kind of stuff does it eat?” Jimmy asked of Janet’s father, who was now sweating horribly and tugging on his collar. 	“Jimmy!”  There was silence for a few moments as the words shattered all conversation in progress.  The silence was only broken as Mrs. Carlton clutched Jimmy’s shoulder and turned him around with her. 	“We’re going home!  You’ve already caused the Wilsons enough trouble today!  Not to mention embarrassing your mother!  I’m taking you home and you’re not coming back over here again!  I don’t care what you say!  I’m sick of it!  And if you ask me one more time, I’ll...”  Janet’s parents closed the door with a huge sigh of relief as Mrs. Carlton’s voice died away.  Her father busied himself with mopping his brow and her mother acted as though she had the whole situation about her finger from start to finish. 	“Well, that takes care of that!” she said in a rather matter-of-fact tone of voice, striding back into the kitchen. 	“Easy for you to say,” her father retorted indignantly.  “Sure!  Let’s just go to work and act like nothing happened!  Yeah!  That’s what we’ll do!” 	“Are you sure that we’re not going to tell anyone at work what just happened?” Janet’s mother said in a deep mock concern. 	“Yeah, that’s right!  You’ll see how miserable it’ll...”  He stopped suddenly and looked at the wall with a stupid and puzzled expression. 	“What’s wrong, honey?” 	“Dear, I have the feeling that just now I had absolutely no idea what I was talking about and it was very possible that I was making a complete fool of myself.” 	“Bravo!  Now get a reality check and get in the car!” 	“Ten-four,” he replied as he dashed up the stairs to get his briefcase. 	“Dear?  The den is downstairs!” she called after him. 	“I knew that!” he yelled as he sped back down the stairs and down to the lower floor. 	“Man, he needs some help sometimes...”  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	“So what were you going to do?  Something like go home and plead to your dad to use his pick-up and then...” 	“It’s not gonna work, Jan.” 	“Well then?  What else do you suggest we do?” 	“Well...”  Evelyn whispered her idea in what would be Janet’s ear, which caused her to shout presently. 	“What!?!  You want me to fly back home!?!” 	“Well...  Yeah!  Why not?” 	“I’ve already told you!  I can’t because of all the people!” 	“So?  Geez, help me out here!  I’m running out of ideas...  Why’d you have to come here, anyway?” 	“So I could teach that punk a lesson.” 	“Oh, yeah...” 	“Well, let’s just sit here and think, then.” 	“Fine with me.”  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	“Evelyn?” “Shh!  I’m trying to think!” 	“That’s what you’ve been saying for the last three hours!”  There was a pause, where the crickets’ chirping was audible. 	“Evelyn?” 	“What?” 	“It’s getting awful dark out here...  Hey, that’s it!” 	“What?” 	“It’s dark outside.  Got a cell phone?” 	“Yeah...  What do you need it for?” 	“Just get it.” 	“OK...”  As Evelyn left, Janet took the time to look up at the slowly appearing evening stars.  Evelyn came back with her cell phone and stood, looking up at Janet, quizzically. 	“Well?” she asked her.  “Who are you calling?” 	“Oh.  My parents at work.  Can I--?” 	“What’s the number?” 	“Oh, yeah,” she said after she set eyes upon her claws, which she was reaching for the phone with.  “608-4...  Wait a second!  Why do I even need to call them?” 	“What do you mean?” 	“They’re at work.  They never worry about me unless I’m gone when they get home.” 	“Geez.  Sometimes I can’t believe you.”  Evelyn turned and marched off impatiently. 	“Wait!” 	“Now what?” 	“What time is it?” 	“It’s 8 o’clock.  Why?” 	“I’ll fly you home...” she said in an almost teasing sort of way.  Suddenly, Evelyn’s eyes lit up and she almost dropped her cell phone. 	“Really?” 	“Uh-huh.” 	“Oh, my God.  Please?” 	“Sure.” “Yea!  But what about my car?  I can’t just leave it here.” 	“You’re right.  Why don’t you just pull it in here and lock it up?” 	“That still doesn’t solve the problem, though.  How am I going to get it back?” 	“Leave that to me!  Well?  Don’t you want a ride?” 	“Yeah!” 	“Well then, climb on,” she said as she lay down and let Evelyn get a solid grip on her neck. 	“Ready?” 	“Yep!” 	“Then hang on tight!  This is my first time, too, remember?” 	“Let’s go!”  With that, Janet bent at the knees and kicked off from the ground, launching herself higher and higher into the sky with her best friend upon the back of her neck.   9 	It was just after eight that Wednesday night.  An older boy was left to study in the dim light of a desk lamp in his quiet retreat.  He had dark, slightly wavy hair and a neatly shaved mustache.  His horizontally striped shirt had a few small wrinkles on the front and his jeans were a bit too long for him.  He set his pencil down for a moment and scratched his chin rather dubiously as he skimmed over the beginning to his composition.  After a bit of consideration, he modified the sentences he had written and continued writing.  His small and neat print had spanned over half the page when something through the large window caught his eye. 	It was difficult to discern the figure as it came steadily closer, barely visible against the midnight blue sky.  He watched in amazement as the shape grew far larger than he had expected.  He had originally thought that it was a bird of some sort, but now, as it neared the window, he was sure he was mistaken.  This was something incredible.  He strained his eyes in the dim light to see more clearly, pulling out his cell phone at the time.  Suddenly, a small flash of moonlight was reflected from one side of the creature, hitting him in the face and causing him to wince.  He quickly turned his gaze upward, his cell phone at the ready.  As the beast flew overhead, he snapped a picture of it through the skylight.  He gawked at the large shadow on the screen, lined in blue in a few places.  He used the zoom function, but it didn’t prove to be much clearer.  All that was visible were a few of the blue pigments in the creature’s wings.  However, the entire body was outlined.  It was a huge flying beast, for sure and he would never forget tonight.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	“Do you think it was really a good idea to fly right over a skylight like that, Jan?” 	“Come on.  It couldn’t hurt that much, could it?” 	“...Yeah, all right.  I guess not.  I still can’t believe that you’re actually flying me home.” 	“Ah, it’s nothing.  Least I could do, right?” 	“Whatever...  Hey, there’s my house.” 	“Yeah, I know, Evelyn.  I’ve only been there a thousand times.” 	“Sorry.  It just looks so different from up here...” 	“Yeah, I guess you’re right.  OK.  Coming in for the landing...” 	Janet suddenly darted upward, which gave Evelyn a bit of a jolt, but her expression of shock was quickly replaced by a wide smile as Janet scattered a small cloud.  She performed a few tight circles about the remains, then fell into a steep dive.  Evelyn’s face showed concern as they neared the ground, but Janet pulled up just in time to hover down to a halt in Evelyn’s backyard. 	“That was awesome,” she said as she slid down Janet’s back and down her tail to the ground. 	“Yeah, it felt great for me, too.” 	“...So what was I getting for you again?” 	“Got a hair dryer?” 	“Yeah, who doesn’t?” 	“Got more than one?” 	“Yeah...  Why?” 	“Well, I was wondering if I could use one because...  My dad has all these cables and stuff, you see and I don’t have an extra hair dryer.  Yeah, my mom wouldn’t like it if I used it for stuff like this, so...  Yeah.” 	“What’s with the cables?” 	“My dad has a cable that’ll let you plug it into a car’s cigarette lighter.” 	“OK, but why do you need it?” 	“Uh, I don’t want everyone in your neighborhood to see me walking down the street, do I?” 	“Yeah, all right.  I still don’t see why you need it...” 	“...Wait...” 	“Now what?” 	“I was just thinking and I don’t really need it.” 	“Will you make up your mind?  Geez...” 	“I know, I’m sorry.  Let’s go back and get your car then.” 	“I like that idea,” Evelyn said with sarcastic enthusiasm. 	“Yeah, yeah.  Just get on.”  Janet made it a swift trip and let Evelyn down to get to her car.  Then she walked down to the ravine and retrieved her soggy clothes. 	“I’ll see you tomorrow then, Evelyn.” 	“Yeah, see ya.” 	“...Hey, what do you like best about me as a dragon?”  A sort of excessively happy smile came over Evelyn’s face. 	“It’s gotta be the blush, Jan.  You know what I mean...” 	“No, that’s not it.  I know what you like best.” 	“What?” 	“Well, isn’t it obvious?  The wings, right?” 	“No!  I’m telling you, it’s the blush under your eyes.  It’s so sexy.” 	“Oh, just shut up and get out of here.  I know you’re lying.” 	“But I’m not.  It really is...” 	“Just leave.” 	“Whatever...  See you tomorrow.” 	“Bye.”  She drove off and Janet was left alone.  It was getting very cold again.  She held her wet clothes in her teeth, then leapt up into the sky again.  She was beginning to get worried; she didn’t know what time it was and her parents could be getting home soon.  This urged her to fly even faster as she sped back home.  Her large tri-level house came into view and she slowed as she came in and touched down on the moist lawn in the backyard.  She quickly glanced over the fence after setting her wet clothes down and saw that Jimmy’s light was out next door.  She wiped her forehead in relief and turned around at the sound of the glass door. 	“Hi, Jan.  Have a good day?”  It was her father. 	“Yeah, pretty good.” 	“What are you doing out here?” 	“Oh, just relaxing a bit.” 	“Well, it’s getting cold out here.  Maybe you should come inside...  Oh, never mind...  Well, if you want to...  I’ll be inside then.” 	“Wait.  Did Jimmy come over?” 	“Yeah, I’ll say.  He was a real pain in the you know what...” 	“Sorry...” 	“Oh, don’t worry about it.  It’s not really your fault.  It’s pretty hard to hide when your head’s almost three stories off the ground.” 	“Yeah,” she told him, blushing. 	“Well, I’ll leave you alone, but don’t be out here too late.  It’s already quarter to ten.” 	“All right.”  She looked up at the stars for a while before retreating to the pool.  She glanced at the thermometer, which read 35°F, and so she laid her head on the cold tile surrounding the pool.  She grimaced slightly, remembering the rather awkward incident last night.  As she stared off into space, her eyelids drooped and she fell asleep.  Later, her mother came outside, looking a bit worried. 	“Jan?  ...Aww, she’s asleep.  I’ll leave her alone...” she said when she saw Janet’s long neck protruding from the frozen pool.  She was about to turn away when she saw Janet begin to shiver. 	“Hmm...  I didn’t think it would be that cold for her.”  She strode back inside and returned with a fleece blanket, which she draped over Janet’s neck.  As she did so, a faint sleepy smile came over Janet’s face and she slowly curled her neck in a tight circle, sound asleep as her mother smiled and went back inside.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	Thursday morning, Janet woke up and stretched her neck before tearing away the sheet of ice that held her fast.  She stood up and smiled as she saw the blanket fall from her neck and onto the ground.  She picked it up along with her clothes and found her pajamas on the bench. 	‘Mom must have left them there for me last night,’ she thought.  ‘That was nice of her...  The blanket, too...’ 	She smiled again and crawled back inside the house.  After taking care of her business in the bathroom downstairs, she climbed up to the main floor and caught a glimpse of the clock, which now read 6:30.  She put away the linens and hiked up the stairs to her bedroom.  She took her math book out of her bag and quickly scrawled out the answers for the worksheet due today.  After about twenty minutes she had finished and stuffed everything back in her bag.  Then she quickly dressed herself, picking out a pale blue blouse and off-white khaki pants to contrast.  She had just opened her bedroom door; her backpack was already slung over her shoulder when she met her mother in the hallway. 	“Well, look at you.  All ready to go, huh?  Have fun out there last night?” 	“Yeah, it was cold, though.” 	“Really?  I hoped you’d like that blanket I gave you.” 	“Yeah.  Thanks again, Mom.” 	“Don’t mention it.  I’ll see you tonight.” 	“Yep, see ya.” 	“Have a good day.”  She stepped outside and a chill ran down her spine; the wind had picked up considerably in the last half-hour.  She crossed her arms and sunk her head into the neck of her blouse a bit.  She began jogging with her arms still folded as the biting headwind thrust itself past her.  It seemed like several minutes before she reached the high school, but as she pulled the door closed behind her, she saw the clock; she was five minutes early.  She fixed her long, straight hair as she walked down the hallway to her locker.  She was surprised to see Evelyn there already. 	“Hey, what’s up?” she asked, as usual. 	“Nothing much.  Just another day.”  She paused for a moment.  “Is it just me, or is this week taking forever?” 	“Yeah, you’re right.  It’s...”  Evelyn stopped short and turned to see a boy of medium height standing there. 	“...Hi,” he said.  He was apparently very shy. 	“Hi.  I haven’t seen you around before.  You need something?” Evelyn asked him.  Janet turned around to look at him now, as well. 	“I know this may sound crazy, but...”  He dug a cell phone out of his pocket and pushed a few buttons.  “Is that you?” 	He was pointing to the dimly lit silhouette of a human head, which was about all Evelyn could make of it.  However, she looked at the rest of the picture and knew that it was her at once; she could make out the outlines of Janet’s wings in the surrounding foreground and her eyes grew very wide. 	“Why, yes...  That is me...  How did you get it?” 	“Oh, I just saw something out the window and I snapped a photo through my skylight.  Never did see exactly what it was, though...  Pretty magnificent, I’d say.  Never seen anything like it.  What were you riding by the way?” 	“You’ll never believe me if I told you.” 	“Oh, but I think I will.  I have the proof, remember.  I saw you in the window, but you were too far off and when you came closer, a light shined in my eyes.”  Evelyn turned to Janet and started whispering in her ear. 	“Oh, do you know about this?” the boy added when he saw them whisper conversation. 	“...Yeah, she told me.  Hang on a sec.”  Janet turned her head back to Evelyn. 	“Who is this guy?  Do you even know him?” 	“No...  I told you it wasn’t a good idea.  The skylight?” 	“Yeah, yeah.  Rub it in, why don’t you?” 	“You think we can trust him?” 	“Dunno.  We should at least get his name.” 	“Yeah...” 	“Hey, may I ask your name?”  Janet tried to look innocent and curious. 	“Oh, sorry, it’s Brendan McDavis.  And yours?” 	“I’m Janet Wilson and this is...” 	“Oh, yeah.  I’ve seen Evelyn around...”  Janet glanced at Evelyn with a rather apprehensive expression and Evelyn shook her head.  “Hey, you still haven’t answered my question.  If you could be so kind?” 	“Well,” Evelyn started, and she began giggling slightly.  “Actually, I...” 	“She was riding me,” Janet finished for her, tossing her head up a bit and donning a wide, almost triumphant grin. 	“What?” 	“I told you that you wouldn’t believe me,” Evelyn said.  “You see; she’s a dragoness...” 	“Wait a sec.  A what?” 	“A dragoness,” Janet echoed.  “As in I’m a half-dragon.”  Slowly, a wide smile spread across his face and tears of joy came to his eyes.  He sat there for a while; he was just looking at her through misty eyes until Janet raised an eyebrow. 	“My dream’s come true!” he burst out, unexpectedly.  Many people turned and stared as he stood in the middle of the hallway with his knees bent slightly, his arms bent in front of him, fists clenched and tears streaming out of his eyes.  Brett just happened to be coming from the other end of the hallway. 	“Hey, shut up, you dip, before I give you something you can really cry about!” he said with the same grin of malice etched into his face.  Brendan looked about sheepishly as people started to laugh.  Then he fixed a sullen look upon one of the beige floor tiles.  Janet walked over to console him after the other students found something else to do. 	“Hey, it’s OK.  That guy’s been plaguing me since my freshman year.  Don’t worry about him.” 	“Yeah, well, are you really a dragon, though?  I mean, you can transform, right?” 	“Yeah.” 	“Yes!  I still can’t believe it, and you’re her friend, right?” 	“Yep,” Evelyn answered.  “She flew me home from the park last night.” 	“Cool, so that’s when I saw you then...  I wish I could’ve got a better picture...” 	“I could pose for you just about anytime, if you wanted,” Janet told him with a slightly seductive smile. 	Brendan felt as though his heart was the weight on one of those carnival games and it had just struck the bell at his Adam’s apple.  Evelyn smiled and nudged Janet in the side, knowingly.  She smiled back quickly as he stared off into space. 	“Really?” 	“Anytime, just call me.”  She took his cell phone from the loose grip of his hand and stored her cell number on it, shooting him another rather seductive look as she fitted it back into his hand.  Then she and Evelyn walked off slowly as the bell rang. 	“Bye,” she said, leaving him there, still gawking at the locker door she had been standing in front of. 	“Oh, man, Brendan.  You’re in for it now!” he said to himself as he started walking to class.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	At lunch, Janet and Evelyn sat down and started talking about Brendan again. 	“Man, you scored some fast points with that guy...” Evelyn said, smiling at her in mock envy. 	“Yeah, he’s kinda cute, but he’s a bit...out there, I guess you could say.” 	“You like him, don’t you?  Janet’s got a boyfriend! Janet’s--!” 	“Shut up!  Seriously, get out of 3rd grade.” 	“Oh, OK...  Hey, I saw him in the hall after 2nd period and...  Oh, my God did you make his day.” 	“What was he like?” 	“He was like, staring at the ground all the time with this little smile on his face and he sighed a couple times...  You should’ve seen, Janet.  It was kind of cute...” 	“Yeah, but I’m surprised that he didn’t flip when we told him.  I wonder if he’s one of those kind of guys...” 	“...What do you mean?  I’m not quite following.” 	“You know, one of those RPG freaks...  Like my brother...”  A hint in her voice told Evelyn that she was slowly drifting away. 	“Probably.  Remember?  He said his dream came true or something.” 	“Yeah...”  Janet was staring off into space as Evelyn continued purposefully. 	“I’m surprised he could even tell that was me in the picture.  Wait a minute.”  Her voice dropped much lower for a second, so that only she could hear, although Janet wouldn’t have heard anyway.  “He said he knew me, but I haven’t seen him anywhere.  What if he couldn’t tell and just wanted to use the opportunity to talk to me?  Then after we told him, Janet set him off like that, but he had originally been watching me...  Nah, he’s not my type anyway.  I can’t be jealous...” 	“What were you saying, Evelyn?” Janet asked her as she turned her head from the far wall of the cafeteria. 	“Oh, nothing,” she said, her face turning slightly red and she quickly picked up her tray.  “I’ve gotta go work my shift now.” 	“Oh, OK.  See ya later.”  Evelyn worked in the concessions during the second half of the forty-minute lunch.  Janet spent the rest of lunch staring at her half-eaten cheeseburger, but she was really thinking about whether she should have done that this morning. 	“I wish I knew...” she said aloud just before the bell rang.  She snapped out of it and hurriedly finished her lunch, taking three of the five minutes given for passing period.  After she dumped her tray, she hurried off to her 4th period class.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	Nothing really exciting happened during the rest of the school day.  Janet finished most of her homework in class and Evelyn was still remonstrating about the issue with Brendan during most of 6th period.  She set her head down on her desk and sighed as Evelyn persisted in talking the rest of the period.  It was very unlike her; it was almost as if they had switched roles in the classroom.  Janet had finished at least thirty of the forty problems before the bell rang, and she packed up her bag and left Evelyn before she could reenact the scene for the fourteenth time. 	She left school out the front exit.  A light drizzle had started up as she left the campus.  The winds were still up and she ran home as the weather proceeded to worsen.  By the time she reached her front porch, it was a near sideways downpour, with moderate gales sweeping the rain against the vinyl windows.  She quickly let herself inside, her hair dripping while she shivered in her blue blouse.  She retreated to the washroom downstairs and dried her waist-length hair out, which she put up again promptly afterward.  Her backpack had soaked through, but to her surprise, her math book and binder were dry, though.  She rolled her eyes in a kind of mock wonder and took them out to finish what was left of her assignment.  She took out a sheet of paper and had barely found the page of the assignment when her cell phone rang. 	She froze on the spot, almost as if in disbelief.  She stood stock still until it rang a second time.  She was nervous; what if it was Brendan?  She mustered some courage and pulled it out of her pocket, still searching her mind for what to say.  She answered it after it rang a third time. 	“Hi...” she said slowly. 	“Hi, Jan.  This is Evelyn.”  A huge sigh of relief was audible on the other line.  “...Are you all right, Jan?” 	“Oh, yeah.  I’m fine.  For some reason I just thought it’d be Brendan calling.” 	“Oh, I see.  Still on about him, eh.  I still remember all about this morning...” 	“Don’t even start!  I’ve heard it only thirteen times; I don’t need it again.” 	“Chill, I was just kidding!  Geez, don’t take offense.” 	“Yeah, all right.  What did you want?” 	“Umm...  This is kind of embarrassing...” 	“Don’t tell me...  You...” 	“No.  I just didn’t catch the math assignment in class earlier today...” 	“Oh, is that all?  Page 537, 2-80 even.  Got it?” 	“Yeah, OK.  Thanks...  Jan?” 	“Yeah?” 	“You don’t really expect him to call you today, do you?  He’s really shy...” 	“Dunno.  I guess you’re right, though.” 	“Well, anyway, see ya tomorrow.” 	“Yeah...  Bye.”  She hung up and sighed as she quickly set back to her work.  She had just scratched out the number sixty-two when her phone rang again.  She took a deep breath and answered it. 	“Hello?” 	“Hi, Janet,” said a falsely deep voice on the other end. 	“Evelyn!” 	“Gotcha!  Sorry, I couldn’t resist.  See ya tomorrow.” 	“I’m gonna kill you!”  The rest of her threats were not heard, as a click was audible just after she said this.  Janet made a small grunt in her anger and returned to her work for the third time.  She had just numbered the last problem when her cell phone rang again.  She let it ring this time while she finished number eighty and closed her book somewhat triumphantly.  Just after the cover had shut, the phone beeped, indicating that the call was missed.  She stuffed her math book back into her backpack and slowed down as she slid her binder in as well.  Her eyes met the spot where her phone rested on the bed.  She fought it, but the temptation soon overcame her and she picked the phone up.  She looked at the call log and found the number. 	“That’s not Evelyn’s number...” she said slowly.  She took a deep breath and dialed the number.   10 	“Hello?” a rather gruff voice answered. 	“Hi, this is Janet.  Is Brendan there?” she replied slowly. 	“Yeah, I’ll get him for you.”  The voice sounded annoyed, which made her feel uneasy.  It was probably his father. 	“Hey, what’s up?  Why didn’t you answer last time?” Brendan’s voice came over the phone. 	“Oh, yeah, well, Evelyn was bugging me and I thought it was her again.  What did you need?” 	“Well, I was wondering if you could stop by tonight.  I...” 	“Umm, I don’t know.  How late?” 	“Well, my parents work graveyard.  I know this is gonna sound crazy, but...  About midnight?”  There was almost a pleading tone in his voice when he said this. 	“Actually, that’s perfect.” 	“What?” he said in disbelief. 	“No, honestly.  My parents work swing, but that doesn’t matter.” 	“Umm, why?” 	“Because ever since they found out, they...” 	“Found out what?”  He said this as though he was talking to himself and he paused for a moment.  “Oh, that.” 	“Yeah...  As I was saying, they don’t worry about me if I’m gone.” 	“Why?” 	“They know I’ll come back.  There’s no way anyone will take me...” 	“Yeah, well...”  The loud voice of Brendan’s father was audible. 	“Get off the phone.” 	“OK, dad.  I’ll see ya later, then.  Bye.” 	“Yeah.”  She made a small kiss noise on the receiver.  “Bye.” 	There was no reply, but only a pause and the click of the phone hanging up.  Janet smiled as she tucked her phone back into her pocket.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  	Hours passed by quickly, and now Janet laid in her bed with her eyes wide open.  She glanced at the clock for the fifth time: eleven-twenty.  Her cell phone was on the nightstand and the ringing tone was set to level 1.  Her hand rested on the corner, ready to pick it up at any moment; Brendan hadn’t told her where he lived.  It seemed like a really important aspect of their meeting, but Janet already knew the general whereabouts.  He lived in Evelyn’s neighborhood and they flew over his house last night, but in the darkness, she probably wouldn’t be able to make out the necessary details of his house.  And so, she waited for him to call.   	She started becoming concerned when he still hadn’t called by eleven-forty.  Then she remembered that his number was still under the Dialed Calls list.  She picked up her phone and re-dialed the number. 	“Hello, Janet?” “Yeah, it’s me.  Umm, where do you live?” “Oh, god, I’m sorry.  I’m such a dip.  Well, you know where Evelyn lives, right?” “Yeah.  Really, it’s OK.” “Yeah, well, there’s a small public park about two blocks south of my house.” “Uh-huh.” “My place is on 16th Avenue.  A gray house, number 9064.  Got all that?” “Yeah.  I think I should be able to recognize it from earlier.” “All right.  Hey, so how do you...  I mean what does it take to--?” “Brendan?” “Yeah?” “Can you hold that thought for about ten minutes?” “...Oh.  Sure,” he said, sounding only mildly disappointed. “OK, bye.”  She kissed the receiver again and listened for a reply; she didn’t know if he even heard last time. “...Bye...  Janet...” he said.  He sounded as if his voice was melting and she guessed that his face was very red before she hung up.  She quickly packed all her things into a large blue duffel bag: her letterman jacket, a blouse and jeans, a towel and some extra socks.  She slung this over her shoulder and headed to the backyard.  After setting the bag on the ground, she stuffed her pajamas in it as well.  Shivering, she stepped over the edge of the pool to find that it was frozen over.  She cursed under her breath and punched it hard about a foot from the edge.  The ice shattered and she dove into the hole she had made. She quickly returned to the surface after relaxing her mind so that the third transformation didn’t have time to take place.  She climbed out and picked her bag up in one claw as she took off.  She beat her light azure wings and sped toward her destination.  When she neared the general area, she climbed higher and higher into the sky until she reached the clouds.  Here, she doubled back and dove straight downward, faster and faster as the ground loomed ever closer.  She pulled up just feet from the ground in Brendan’s backyard and landed softly.  She looked into the window and saw Brendan in his study; the small desk lamp illuminating his pale complexion.  She smiled before spraying the window to get his attention. She could barely see him turn and jump up to the window through the mist that started sliding down the windowpanes.  After it cleared, he smiled and pointed down.  Janet nodded and lowered her head to the back door.  Brendan jumped when he opened the door to see Janet’s face, bearing a wide grin. “I thought you’d at least use the doorbell like everyone else,” he said in mock contempt. “Well, I don’t have a car and I’m not gonna walk here,” she replied indignantly. “Yeah, well, don’t tell me I’m gonna have to come out here to shoot you.” “Excuse me?” “I meant that I’d have to bring my camera stuff out here.” “Oh, well, don’t worry about it.  I can come inside.  Let’s see your pad.” “Uh, you sure you’ll fit?” “Yeah, I’ll be fine.” “OK...”  He screwed up his face in a ‘suit yourself’ type of expression before backing out of the way.  Janet crawled through the door and into what looked like a parlor.  Brendan looked up at her as she stood with her head bent low the ground. “Are you sure you’ll be all right in here like that?” he asked her. “Yeah, well, you got a bathroom near here?” “Sure.  Just down the hall.” “Thanks.”  He watched her as she went ahead and slid through the door into the bathroom. “This is so cool,” he said to himself.  “I can’t believe this.” Janet closed the door behind her.  After a few seconds, Brendan heard the zipper of her bag with a puzzled look on his face.  A little while longer, she came out wearing her blouse and jeans.  Brendan’s face lit up as she opened the door.  He stood with his mouth slightly open, still watching her.  Janet smiled and stepped out, turning her head sharply before walking up a short flight of stairs to the living room, which caused her long ponytail to brush against his shoulder and the side of his face.  He just smiled and followed her, turning slightly red.  She stopped at the top of the stairs and smiled at him again as he came up to meet her. “It’s a nice place you’ve got here.  It reminds me a lot of my house.” “...Yeah.  So how do you, you know, transform?” he asked her. “Well, it’s hard to explain right now.  Why don’t I just start from the beginning?” “OK.” “Well, it all started when I turned 18, only last Monday...” “Seriously?  This Monday?  I’m sorry I didn’t get to wish you a happy birthday.” “Yeah, that’s OK.  Anyway, you know that I’m blue all over, right?” “...Oh, yeah.” “Well, I’m a water dragoness, so...” “Oh, I see now.  Wait a second.  I’ve got it.  I’ll be right back.”  He headed up the stairs for a moment, then returned with a familiar magazine-style book. “Hey, isn’t that the--?” “The Character Manual?  You bet!” he finished for her, turning to the pages in the back. “I dug the Monster Manual out of my brother’s room after I transformed the first time, but he doesn’t have that one.  Let me look.” “Hang on a sec...  Ah, here it is: DRAGOON/DRAGONESS.  It says here that in order to transform, the character must receive head contact with their innate element.  So, you said it was water, right?” “Yeah, that’s why I transformed...” “That’s not really good.  If what this says is true, then you could transform involuntarily just about anywhere.  Wait a minute.  What does any of this have to do with your birthday?” “That’s what I found out in the Monster Manual.  Here, let me explain.” “I’m all ears.” “OK.  On Monday, I transformed in the shower.” “Uhh...”  He suddenly stared off into space with and rather shocked look on his face.  “Too much information.” “Relax.  Just listen, OK?” “All right,” he said, turning back to her. “At first, I was really freaked out, but then it didn’t bother me that much because I usually dream about stuff like that all the time.” “Whoa, whoa.  Back up.  Why didn’t this happen earlier?  You take a shower every day, right?” “That’s what I’m getting to.  I jumped out and found the Manual.  That’s when I found out.” “What?” “18 years is considered adolescence in the dragon race.  Yes, that means that they spend about 96% of their 500-year life as an adult.” “Oh, now I get it.  So ever since you turned 18, you can transform and stuff.” “Yeah...  Wait, I just had the strangest thought.” “What?” “What if I live for 500 years?  What’ll happen to me?” “I don’t know.  Maybe I can find something...”  He began scanning the entries on the two pages. “...Got it!” “What does it say?” she asked, barely able to contain her apprehension and excitement. “It says that once the character has reached the dragon adolescence...  The human aging process slows down!” “So that means I’ll look like I’m 18 for five years!?!  Oh, my god.  College is gonna be so weird.” “Yeah, well, don’t worry about it.  Remember?  There are some 12-year-olds in college!  It’ll be fine.” “Oh, yeah.  Well, that makes me feel better, but I’m still going to look 18 for the four years.  I’ll never appear to change.” “Just relax.  You’ve got another year until then.  Wait, you are a senior, aren’t you?” “Yeah.  How old are you?” she asked him with a soft look on her face. “I’m 18 too.  Well, almost, but I’m a junior.  I started kindergarten a year late,” he said, turning very red. “Hey, that’s nothing to be ashamed of.” “Well, I guess so.  It still seems kind of embarrassing, though.” “That’s OK.  So do you have any more questions?” “Nah, not really.” “Oh, I have a question.  Do you have a pool, a hot tub, anything?” “No, I don’t.  Why?  Do you want to show me something?” “Yeah, well, we can go to my place.  Oh, and you can bring your photo stuff, too.” “Umm, I don’t have a car either...  Wait, no way...  You wouldn’t...” “What?” she said, trying to look innocent. “Awesome.  You’ll fly me?” “That was my plan, but I need some water.” “Why don’t you just use the shower?” “Well, I don’t know.  I’ve never tried going straight to secondary form in a house.  I’m fourteen feet tall, then, you know.” “Oh, yeah.  I have a hose outside.” “Yeah, OK.  Go get all your stuff and I’ll go get ready outside.” “All right.”  He set up the stairs to get his equipment.  Janet picked up her bag and quickly descended to the lower level and went out the back door.  She hurriedly closed it behind her, locking herself out to buy some time, just in case.  She undressed and stuffed the clothes into her bag after finding the hose and faucet around the corner.  She turned it on and soaked her face with her mind empty.  She promptly reached down and tightened the valve to shut it off and picked up her bag just as she heard the lock click and the door open. “You’re just in time,” she said, her arms held about herself.  “Is it just me, or is it really windy out here?” “I don’t feel anything.  Well, are you ready?” “More like, are you ready?” she said, trying not to shiver. “Yeah, I’ve got everything.” “Well, then let’s go,” she said quickly, still grimacing at the high winds as she picked up her bag and lay down.  Brendan took a seat just behind her head and carefully slid his bag over his shoulder. “...OK,” Brendan said a bit nervously.  “I’ve never done this before...” “You’d be the second.  Well, at least that I know of.  Don’t worry; Evelyn loved it.” “Yeah, I guess you’re right!”  His voice rose to a much higher pitch as Janet leapt into the air.  Brendan’s grin widened as she soared faster and faster up into the clouds.  Janet was shivering uncontrollably because of the winds, which was the only reason that she sought to fly above the clouds.  She felt much better after cutting straight through a large cumulus cloud; the moisture restoring her from her previous paler complexion.  Her mind wandered as she leveled off and slowed down, heading toward home. ‘He’s been silent for the whole trip.  Is he OK?’  She quickly glanced back at him from the edge of her long, narrow eye to find his smiling face; his hair whipping wildly about in the wind. ‘That’s strange.  It’s almost like he doesn’t even feel it.  Hmm...’  She turned her focus back in front of her once again.  “Having fun?” “Yeah, this is awesome!” “Well, we’re almost there...  Where is it?  ...There.  Hold on to your head!” “Check,” he said as he covered his head with his arms. “Not literally!” “Oh...  Whoa!”  Janet pulled into a steep dive and descended like a rocket toward her backyard, where she pulled up at the last second, as always.  She paused to stretch her wings and Brendan slid down her back, looking down with the smile of exhilaration.  She turned her head around and eyed him warily as he landed on the ground, promptly looking up at her with a bit of a sheepish grin.  She folded her wings and turned away with a look of mock contempt, which made him laugh. “Shh!” she quieted him as she came down and slowly entered the house through the sliding glass door.  He came in right behind her, carrying his bag and still muttering something with a smile on his face.  “Remember that my parents are here.  They’re just sleeping.  OK, it’s one-thirty.  Go set up outside and I’ll go change so I can show you how it’s done.” “All right,” he breathed with an affirmative nod.  Janet lugged her bag into the washroom and came out in her pajamas about two minutes later.  She walked outside to see Brendan adjusting the camera lens on his tripod. “Just curious, why the tripod?” Janet asked him. “Oh, well, I don’t want to have to hold it two inches from the ground.  You know what I mean?” “Umm, still not following.” “It’ll just help me with my angles when I’m shooting.” “OK, that’s better.”  Brendan was still bent over his camera and looking away from her.  She glanced back at him, then turned back and started unbuttoning her pajama top. “Hey,” Brendan suddenly looked up.  Janet cringed and pretended to just be looking at the water in the pool.  “Weren’t you saying something about a secondary form?” “Uhh...  Yeah...  I was,” she said slowly; her face was getting warmer by the second. “You said fourteen feet.  That was like when we went flying, right?” “Uh-huh,” she said quietly as she sat down at the edge of the pool. “So then what about--  What are you doing?” “Umm...”  Janet’s face turned very red and she continued staring intently at the water. “Is there something wrong?” he asked as he started walking toward her.  She slowly folded her arms across her chest. “No, it’s OK...  I’m just cold.” “Oh, all right.”  He remained standing over her for a few moments, during which she looked up at him. “What?” she said, defensively. “Oh, nothing...  I still need to free up my memory.” “Huh?” “On the camera.” “Oh...  Yeah.”  After he turned to go, she hastily fixed her half-buttoned shirt and sat down on the bench on the patio.  After about a minute, Brendan joined her. “Well, I’m ready.  Are you going to show me how you transform?” “...Well, it’s not quite that simple...” “What do you mean?  You were fine at my place.” “Come here,” she beckoned and she whispered in his ear for a few moments.  When she had finished, his eyes had shot wide open and he nodded his head very slowly in understanding. “OK, go ahead,” he said, getting up and sitting on the opposite side of the bench.  He put his head in his hands and shook his head, still shocked that she had told him anything like that on their first meeting.  After a while, he heard her slip into the water. “Can I turn around yet?” he asked, feeling sort of stupid. “Yes, I’m ready now.”  Brendan paused for a moment before resituating himself on the other end of the backless bench.  He saw Janet with her arms crossed on the edge of the pool and her head resting on them. “Hi,” he said as though they had just met. “Hi, Brendan.  Are you ready?  Then watch me.”  He watched as she smiled and sank into the water for no longer than a second.  Then, two scaly, pale green arms pulled her back into her original position. “Whoa, that’s just insanely cool.  So this is the first one?” “Yeah, no wings yet.” “I see, and the second one?” “Same as the first, only I have to relax and clear all my thoughts.”  She dove again and her tail flicked out of the water almost like a dolphin’s would before coming down with her.  She emerged once again in the more familiar form.  Brendan smiled and wrapped his green scarf tighter about his neck; it was getting cold again. “Hey, I just thought of something.  Is there anything past that?” he asked. “Actually, there is, but I don’t know if you want to see or not.” “What do you mean?  It can’t be that bad, can it?” “No.  It’s just quite a bit more trouble than it’s worth in my eyes.” “Now you’ve lost me.” “Well, I guess it couldn’t hurt.  Just as long as we’re really quiet, OK?” “Why?” “My parents?” “Oh, yeah...”  Janet shook her head at him, but what she didn’t realize was that Brendan spent most of his nightly hours up and about. “Well, if you want to see, we need a couple things.” “What are they?” “First of all, the temperature has to be below freezing...” “...And?” “We’ll need the blowtorch from my dad’s workbench in the garage, if that gives you any clues...”  She finished her sentence with a mysterious sort of tone in her voice. “So, you’ve already done this before?” “Yeah, it was kind of embarrassing, but I know how to fix it now.  Here, look at the thermometer and tell me if it’s even worth a try.” “...It says...34°F.  That should be close enough, right?” “Well, technically, it has to be freezing or lower, but it probably will be soon enough, so I’ll go get the torch.”  Janet left momentarily and returned after much rummaging through drawers and tabletops.  When she arrived outside again, Brendan was pointing rather excitedly to the thermometer.  She took note of the frozen surface of the pool and motioned for Brendan to watch.  He hurried back over and sat with his knees on the bench.  Janet punched a large hole in the ice and slid into the water. Brendan watched eagerly as the loose pieces of ice floated around for a while before the sheet became solid again.  A few seconds passed and Brendan slowly walked toward the edge of the pool to try and see through the ice.  He couldn’t see anything, though, and a few moments after he had set his foot on the tiled edge, the ice covering most of the pool was shredded and tossed aside.  In a few dozen sparkling reflections of moonlight, Janet rose from the pool, towering at least six feet over Brendan’s head.  Her frosty breaths were slow and even and she glared at him with her piercing, glassy sapphire eyes.  He felt frightened, as if she had lost control of her mind, but all that changed when she smiled gently, just like she had earlier. “Surprise,” she said before climbing out of the pool.  “Get back for a second; I’ve gotta show you this.”  With that, Brendan sat back down on the bench and watched as she took a breath, then completely iced over the pool and the surrounding tile. “Man, I’ve never seen any dragon like that.  That’s awesome!” “Yeah, but the whole ‘tall as a house’ thing bothers me.” “Yeah, well, in a neighborhood like this, sure.” “OK, now I need the torch.  You need to be careful, because when my dad tried, he knocked me unconscious.” “Wait, he knocked you unconscious with a blowtorch?” “Yeah.” “Hold up.  Your dad knows about this whole deal, too?” “Mom, too.” “That must’ve been hard.  Well, what do you want me to do?” “Well, this time, I’ll think be more specific than I was with my father.  He got this idea in his head,” she said as she pulled a scale from her tail and let Brendan see it regenerate.  “Then he gave me a serious burn.” “Wow, that’s neat.  I read about that in the guide, but that’s no good that he burned you.” “Yeah, well, he gets kind of crazy sometimes.” “So what do you want me to do again?” “All right.  Start slow.  Turn it on and just hold the flame closer and closer to my forehead.  Eventually, I have to return to my secondary form.” “OK, so kinda like melting a snowman, right?” “I resent that, but yes.  Only you don’t set the snowman ablaze like my father did.” “Yeah, OK.  Here goes...”  He brought the torch slowly toward Janet’s head. “Wait.  Don’t stand right in front of me, just in case.” “Umm, OK.”  He proceeded after stepping to the side and after a few seconds, Janet turned back.  Her eyes were still closed and her head was still down.  Brendan turned the torch off and patted her on one side of her head.  She came to almost like waking up from a sleep. “Huh?  Oh, hi, Brendan.” “Hi, Jan.  Are you all right?” “Yeah, I’m fine.  Just a little sleepy.  I think I’ll turn back now.  I’ll be just a minute, OK?” “All right.”  Brendan waited on the bench; his black fleece sweater and wool sweatpants kept him warm.  It was a few minutes before Janet opened the sliding glass door again. “Hey, why didn’t you come inside, you goof?” “Oh, I thought you were coming out here.” “It’s cold out there, even for me.  Come on, get in here,” she said, dropping her voice to a whisper. “Uhh...  You forgot something,” Brendan said, turning around to find her pajamas still lying by the edge of the pool. “Oh, yeah...”  She quickly walked outside and picked them up, following him back into the house afterward.  Brendan sat down in a large armchair in the corner of the den and Janet closed the door to the rest of the house.  The only light came from outside and Janet walked over to him slowly.  He raised his eyebrows as she took a seat right next to him in the same chair. “So when’s your birthday?” she asked him, putting one arm about his shoulder and letting the other hand rest on his knee. “Uhh...”  His face was turning red again.  Why do you ask? “Oh, just curious,” she said, now resting her head on his shoulder. “Umm...”  Janet felt his face getting warm and she smiled a bit.  “It’s the 1st.” “March?” “Yeah.” “Oh, you don’t know how happy that makes me feel,” she said and she pulled him into a hug. “Come on, do we have to do this now?”  His voice was slightly muffled by the presence of her arm. “It’s two o’clock in the morning.  Of course we do!”  Her voice was getting louder as she let herself get carried away. “So what’s so special about my birthday?  Nobody ever remembers it.  Not even my parents.” “Well then, wouldn’t it be nice if you did something special on your birthday for once?  I know exactly how you feel; mine’s the same way.” “Like what?”  He suddenly sounded very interested in what she had to say. “Like this!”  He took the hint as she started coming closer and they both leaned close to kiss.  They had only just begun when the door opened. “Janet?  What are you doing in here?”   11 The voice wasn’t angry; it seemed only quizzical.  Janet recognized it right away; it was her father. “I was just...” she started, but he interrupted her with a comical tone in his voice. “It’s OK, it’s OK!  I used to do stuff like that all the time!  You know, like bringing my girlfriend to my place in the middle of the night.  It’s the same thing.”  Janet and Brendan looked at one another with raised eyebrows, shaking their heads slightly. “Have fun, kids,” her father said as he started leaving the room.  They were both still staring at him. “No, really!  Go on.  Have some fun together.  Just make sure you don’t wake your mother, Jan.  You know what she’ll think of this episode.” “...OK.”  She smiled sweetly and waved.  Her father waved back and muttered something that sounded like ‘lovebirds’ as he closed the door. “Dude, what’s with your dad?” Brendan whispered. “Umm...  He’s just like that sometimes...  He’s very...” “Random?” “Perfect word...  So where were we?”  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Janet woke up with a start about four hours later.  She had been resting against Brendan’s shoulder the whole time.  He was still sleeping, his arm dangling over the arm of the chair and his head tilted to one side. “Hey, Brendan!  Wake up!” she whispered urgently.  He woke up with a start as well, as though something had crashed to the floor in an adjacent room. “What, huh?  Oh, Janet.  What is it?” he mumbled sort of sleepily; his eyes were wide open, though. “Look!  It’s 6 o’clock,” she said, pointing to the blue-green VCR display.  “When do your parents get back?” “Don’t worry, they don’t get home until eight...”  His voice trailed off and he closed his eyes again, succumbing to the long night they shared. “Brendan!” “What?” he replied hastily, sitting bolt upright in the chair. “It’s Friday!” “That’s nice...”  He started to doze off again.  “...Oh, crud!  We’ve gotta get to school!” “Yeah, we do.  Do you have your bag and everything?” “Oh, great!”  He jumped out of the chair and opened his sports bag.  “Please say I brought it...  Yes!  It’s here.  I’ve got everything.” “All right.  At least that’s taken care of.  So your parents don’t get home until eight, right?” “Yeah...” “Then we can walk together today.” “How far is it?” “Oh, it’s nothing compared to your walk, then; it takes me about ten minutes, taking my time.” “Sweet.  It takes me at least half an hour.” “Well, let’s go.” “Uh, Jan?” “Yeah?” “It’s only six.  School doesn’t start until seven-twenty.” “Oh, yeah...  Then do you have any homework?” “Nah, just that composition.”  Janet nodded knowingly; the CWP project was assigned to juniors, as well. “Yeah, I spent almost my entire vacation doing that.  Then I found out that it was due next Tuesday.” “Well, at least yours is done.  I’ve only got like two pages finished.” “That sucks.  I heard it was going to be nice this weekend.” “Oh, I don’t know if I’ll have any distractions.” “What do you mean?” “I’ve got this feeling that the weekend’s not looking so hot.” “Well, we’ll see soon enough.”  She gazed off into the distance for a few moments before she continued. “So...” she started.  “Have you read anything about this dragon stuff?” “What are you saying?”  He looked at her with a puzzled face. “You know what I mean.  Is it genetic or something?” “Oh, the trait?  I would assume so, but that would mean...” “Somebody had to have it before me...” “OK, this is where biology really helps.  I’m in the AP course.  Give me a pencil and some paper.” “You’re making a pedigree chart, right?” she asked, handing him the supplies. “Exactly.  Well, we’ll start with your great-grandparents.  How many kids did they have?” “Two boys.” “OK, so there they are.  Let’s say this is your grandpa.  He gets married, then how many kids did they have?” “Three boys.” “So one’s your father and he and your mom had you.” “And my brother.” “You have a brother?” “Yeah, he’s like 22, so he moved away.” “But he doesn’t have it, does he?” “Nope.” “So this would be what I call a Class three trait.” “Meaning?” “Oh, well, a Class one trait can only be carried in males and can only be expressed in males.  Class two is the same for females.” “So then what’s Class three?” “A Class three trait can only be carried in males and can only be expressed in females.” “So something must have happened a long time ago that caused the trait to get into the system.” “Well, dragons don’t reproduce sexually the same way we do, that’s for sure.” “Whoa, back up!  I don’t really wanna get into that this early in the morning.” “I understand, but this is crucial to answering the why part of your current existence.” “OK, what do you propose?” “Well, it’s evident that dragons can transfer their DNA to humans, but how is what I want to know.” “Yeah, I agree, but look at the time.  We’d better get going.” “All right.  I’ll get my stuff.”  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  “What’s wrong, Brendan?”  Janet looked at him with much concern.  He was staring at the ground as they walked, apparently deep in thought.  He took a moment to finish his thoughts before answering. “It’s just that...  Your family has all males, right?” “...Yes.” “Well...  No, that’s crazy...  It can’t possibly be that way...”  He started walking faster out of what Janet deemed to be nervousness. “Wait up!  What do you mean?” “No, I can’t...  I shouldn’t have even bothered you with it.  I’ve gotta go.  I’ll see you Monday.  Bye!”  He broke into the fastest sprint she had ever seen and he had made it from the corner to the school, three blocks away, in roughly twenty seconds. “There’s something different about him...  I just don’t understand why he’s being this way.  Does he think--?  No...”  She tossed the thought aside and briskly walked the remaining distance to the school.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  The school day was very uneventful, which didn’t help Janet feel any better about this morning.  She couldn’t decide what the most exciting thing was that happened that day: the fact that she received another fifty math problems for the weekend or just the fact that it was Friday.  Even Evelyn couldn’t seem to cheer her up during lunch. “He’s so strange sometimes...” she thought out loud as she walked back home.  “The way he ran off like that this morning, his insensitivity to the cold last night.  It makes me think really hard; there’s just something fishy about him.  Well, maybe fishy is not the right word...” She paused and turned her gaze toward the sky, halting in the middle of the sidewalk. “I wonder if he is...  Well, there’s only one way to find out.  The time will come soon enough.”   12 It was nine in the morning.  A loud thunderclap woke Janet from her slumber.  The sound of the pouring rain was audible as she sat bolt upright in her sheets.  She jumped out of bed and hurried over to the window; there was an absolute torrential downpour outside and high winds to top it all off.  Her mouth dropped open slightly as she watched the storm, looking stunned. “Well, I guess he won that one,” she said, putting her head in her hands and resting her elbows on the edge of the windowsill.  “This sucks, and I have nothing to do inside this weekend either.” She sighed and stared out the rain-soaked window.  The weather was never very forgiving in February for some reason; the cold didn’t usually bother her, but the rain seemed to drench her rather jovial spirit.  A pair of vigilant eyes was cast upon her as she sulked by the window. “Jan.  Is there something wrong?”  Janet turned around to find her mother standing in the doorway. “Oh, I just thought it would be nice this weekend.  Well, I guess you can’t expect anything fabulous this time of year.” “It’s all right.  I know just how you feel.  You just have to try to make the best of things.” “Yeah...  That’s about it.” “Well, I’ll go downstairs and get breakfast started.  Why don’t you go and wake your father when it’s ready?” “OK, Mom.”  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Janet prodded her scrambled eggs with her fork and stared at the sticky remains of French toast and maple syrup on her plate. “Are you OK, Jan?” her father asked, setting down his fork; a piece of smoked sausage was still fixed on the end. “Yeah, I’m fine...  I’m just thinking about things...”  Her gaze never left her plate as she found another piece of French toast with her fork and started drawing circles through the extra maple syrup. “What are--?” her father started.  “Oh...  OK...” He fell silent after receiving a swift negative cue from Janet’s mother across the table.  A few moments of clinking silverware passed before Janet finally spoke. “Dad?” “Yes?” “Don’t we have a family tree somewhere?” “Yes we do,” her mother answered. “...Your aunt is keeping track of that right now,” her father explained. “Wait, Aunt Lily?  Oh, she’s on mom’s side.  Sorry, were you finished?” “Yeah, but why do you ask?”  He had a sort of wistful look on his face.  It was as though he already knew why she had asked and that he was hoping she would say something. “Well, how far does it go back?”  Her father smiled before replying. “As far as I know, we have relatives recorded back to at least the 13th century.  Let me guess; you want to know about why you have that dragon trait?” “Yeah, that’s what I was getting at...” “Hold up, mister,” her mother chimed in rather irritably.  “You still haven’t told me anything about this, either.” “OK, then you can listen, too.” “We have to have a talk.”  She set down her fork and took her plate into the kitchen, then returned and stood in front of the table, obviously expecting him to get up. “Wait a minute.  I’ve gotta tell her.  She deserves to know.” “Well, I want to know, too.” “She’s the only one who has to live with it.” “...Wait, so then I am the only girl in the family lineage?” Janet interrupted before her mother could get another say in. “Yes, and that’s why I need to tell you how it happened,” her father replied coolly before taking her back through the kitchen. “All right, Joseph, but you still need to tell me the who, what, where, when, why and how once you’re done,” she retorted, and she was left to do the dishes as they retreated to the den. “Listen, I don’t really know how it came around myself, but...” “You said you did,” Janet said, sounding mildly disappointed. “Yeah, I was kind of bluffing in front of your mom.  I still haven’t told her anything about all this and I figure I’m gonna have hell to pay once I get out of here.” “OK, so what’s up?” “Well, I’m gonna have to just give her the basics for today.  I don’t have any time right now to find out what I said I’d tell you, but I know where to look.” “So you know where to get that information?  That’s crazy!  There aren’t any books that have stuff like that in them.” “Actually, the ironic thing is that there are.  Here, take this key.  It goes to a little square box in the attic.  In there you’ll find all the journals of our relatives.  There has to be something in one of them.  Try the late 14th century; it’s probably your best bet.” “OK...  I have one question.  How come you haven’t already read them before?” “I never thought about it, but now I realized its importance and well, I just haven’t got around to it, yet.  So I need you to tell me about what you find before I run out of excuses for your mother.  Besides, I bet you’re just as curious as I am.” “Yeah, you bet.  Wait, what does the box look like?” “Oh, it’s blue I think.  Don’t worry, you’ll know it when you see it.  Anything else?” “...Yeah.”  She hesitated before going on.  “...You know Brendan, right?” “No...  Oh, that guy you were with last night?” “Yeah...  I know this sounds strange, but...  I think he’s one too.” “What?”  There was a small pause before the both of them heard Janet’s mother calling. “Joseph!  Come on, you’ve got some explaining to do!” “Oh, great...  You better go.  I’ll tell you later,” Janet said quickly. “...OK.”  Her father had an almost childish look on his face as he left the den, like he was about to be carried off to some place by the collar on his shirt.  Janet opened her clenched fist and set her eyes on the key once more as it lay on the palm of her hand.  She quickly pocketed it and headed upstairs after hearing the angry steps of her mother above.  She closed the door of her bedroom and moaned softly as her eyes came to the window, where it was still stormy and gray.  She sat down on her bed and kicked off her shoes, her eyes meeting the floor for a while.  She didn’t understand why it had to be such a crummy day. “The weather should at least extend some courtesy,” she growled in her frustration.  She groaned once more and laid down, closing her eyes.  After a few moments, she opened them again to find that the image of her dresser was rippling slightly.  She blinked, but it didn’t go away.  It made her dizzy and she closed her eyes before she could start to feel sick.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  A roar of thunder sounded and in the blinding flash hence, Janet sat up on the bed. “Déjà vu,” she said almost mechanically, but it was late at night.  She glanced at the fluorescent viridian display, which read 11:46.  Her parents had gone to work and already come back home in the time she was asleep, and now she was almost sure that they were already asleep, as well.  She knew her mission, quietly slipping out of her room, her Mag-lite in hand.  She made her way across the hall to her brother’s old room.  The door squeaked slightly as she began opening it as she expected.  She froze and listened for any other noises, then proceeded inside, finding the rectangular cut in the ceiling above the tall, oak five-drawer dresser. She carefully clambered on top, pausing before opening the trapdoor to close the bedroom door once again.  She gingerly set the piece of sheet rock down on the floor of the attic; her father had attached a hinge so that it wouldn’t come loose every time it opened, yet it was needless to say that it almost never got any use.  She pulled herself onto the uncarpeted wooden floor in the attic and closed the trapdoor softly behind her. The small quarters were intermittently lit by flashes of light; they were reminders of the perpetual tempest that was still underway outside.  The howling winds whistled much more gently through tiny cracks in the wooden walls.  Janet shivered as she challenged each new box with her flashlight, rubbing one arm up and down with the other.  At last, she found the small blue box her father had described.  She expected it to be covered with dust like all the others, but it wasn’t, which reminded her that her father had reorganized it only recently. She tried the key in the lock and opened the top, revealing a number of blue-bound books.  She looked in amazement for a few moments, unable to believe that they were all still in this good of condition.  She looked down the two rows of ten books and took the one that was filed in the upper left-hand corner of the box; there were evidently two layers in the box.  It was easy to conceive that the one she took was the newest.  It bore the following words on the cover: George Wilson, 1933-2009.  It was her grandfather, who had died only a year ago.  The death date was stamped in a bold font; it was obvious that he couldn’t have embossed it himself.  She shed a tear as she remembered how he used to be. ‘76 years...’ she thought sadly.  She imagined far in the future; a boy comes to this very box and his eyes nearly bulge out of his head when he sees the cover of the most recent journal: Janet Wilson, 1992-2518.  She giggled softly at the thought, then carefully set her grandfather’s book aside; she had a job to do here.  She removed the books on the top layer and found the oldest book.  The cover was very worn and she didn’t even try to make out anything but the date: 1213-1250. “Boy, they sure didn’t live long back then.”  She set it aside with the others and narrowed the final fifteen or so down to two, which were oddly very close to the same dates.  However, they were the only ones that seemed to fit the era she was looking for.  She chose one at random and skimmed through Frederick Wilson’s entries.  A particular entry caught her eye and she voiced it out loud:  March 13, 1361 Dear Journal, 	I have much ill news of late.  My brother has been beset a most horrible fortune.  It seems that his fighting arm was nearly ripped from its socket tonight.  I can only hope the best for him.  Alas, I was unable to join the guild today...  She shut the book and quickly donned the other, which she was sure would be his brother’s.  She quickly flipped to the matching entry, which was surprisingly legible. ‘He must be left-handed,’ she thought.  March 13, 1361 Dear Journal, 	The gods frown upon my fortunes tonight.  I fear that no one shall understand the great measure of my plight.  Thus, I feel that I can only entrust it with you.  It fell hence.  I was trying my skills in the forest by the lake.  I have a hunger to join the guild with my brother.  I had only a small sword and no shield for defense.  Our family has not been able to measure up the cost for one of any decency.  I had slain only but a few goblins and the like when my ears received a most curious sound in the water nearby.  Janet stopped reading for a few moments; it was almost exactly how her brother had imagined it, only DND was a totally different story.  I turned to mark its call and I found myself face to face with the beast.  It had the longest neck I’d ever seen and it frightened me so in the gloom of late dusk.  I held my sword in front of me lengthwise, lest it try to attack me.  Alas, in my haste to guard, my arm thrust to the side across my face, which easily allowed it to make a move at my sword arm.  I remember the pain it caused and its piercing eyes of azure.  This beast was much different than the dragons my father described; yet I knew no other sort of beast to be similar in likeness.  When I returned home, my father said I was lucky.  He said it could only have been a female, else my arm would not still hang limply on my shoulder.  I do not know if I will live much longer.  Alas, I should not think about such things.  Please pray for Elise and me. 						James Wilson  Janet eyes were watery as she closed the book and began reordering the rest in the box.  She could tell that he had only lived for 19 years and he was nearly seventeen at the time, meaning that he probably survived long enough only to have a child.  She wiped her tears gently, then evaluated what she read. “So the bite gave him the trait, but he was just a carrier, like the rest of them.  Then it must have done something to the X-chromosomes to give only females the trait.  It all makes sense now.”  She closed the lid of the box as she finished her thoughts and she paused for a moment.  Something was missing; there were no longer any bursts of light that found their way through the attic window.  She quickly looked outside to find that it was still raining. “Geez, I can’t believe it’s still raining.  We’re going to have floods.”  She turned and wove her way back through all the dusty boxes that were piled to the ceiling.  Upon opening the trapdoor, her father’s face popped into view below. “So, what’d you find out?” “Don’t scare me like that, Dad.” “Well, I just heard you talking to yourself in there and I knew you were looking in those books.  So how about it?” “I have one piece of information that I already knew and one that I didn’t.  I’ll share them.” “OK.” “First, your daughter’s gonna live for about 500 years...” “What?” “...And second, dragons transmit DNA when they bite.” “OK, that makes more sense.  Now back up.  What is this 500 years bit?” “I am going to live for 500 years.” “That’s crazy.  How do you know that?” “Hello, Dad.  I’m a dragoness.  They live for 500 years or more.” “So, but that’s not possible.” “Dad, the aging process slows down, meaning I’m gonna look I’m eighteen for another four, maybe five years.” “That’s insane.  What are we going to do about your driver’s license?  What about social security?  What--?” “Relax, Dad.  If it really becomes a problem, I can just carry around my birth certificate.” “But, but...” “Dad, don’t worry.  You need to go back to bed.” “But...” “Come on.” “What about--?” “Good night, Dad.”   13 Finally, Monday morning dawned and Janet readied her things for school.  Sunday had dragged by painfully slowly with all the homework she had to catch up on.  She had finished it all and slept most of the rest of the day, still fairly tired from a series of late nights.  Presently, she called back into the house before closing the front door, not waiting for a reply. “Bye, Mom and Dad!”  Today was clear with only a few thin cirrus clouds hanging high in the sky.  The ground was still very wet from the rainy weekend, however. A gentle breeze fluttered over the streets, carrying fragrant apple and cherry blossoms with it.  She reached the door of the school in good time, passing through and sauntering down the hall to her locker.  She and Evelyn had a lot of catching up to do. “Hey, what’s up?” Janet asked her.  “I haven’t seen you in forever, it seems.” “Yeah, me too.  So did he call you?” she asked with a rather dubious look. “Actually, he did.  We spent Thursday night together.” “Oh, yeah.  You came in together on Friday morning, didn’t you?” “Uh-huh.  You know; I’ve been thinking and I’m a little worried about him.” “Why is that?” “Well, his birthday’s today and...  I think he’s one, too.” “Umm...”  She was apparently thinking about what Janet was referring to.  “No way!  You’re crazy!  He can’t be...” “Well, I don’t know, either, but I’ve got a lot of clues.” “Oh, yeah.  What sort?”  Evelyn challenged her with her eyes. “You know how windy it was on Thursday, right?” “...Yeah.” “He couldn’t even feel it.” “So?” “That’s not all.  He can run almost twice as fast as anyone I’ve ever seen.” “Well, maybe he practices.” “Oh, I figured out how this thing happened, too.  If you look at my family tree, they’re all guys; I’m the first daughter since, like forever.” “What are you saying?” “Long story, but he was about to say something about his family.” “Well, I still don’t know about this.” “Me neither, but we’ll find out sometime today.  Do me a favor and watch him during 2nd period.” “OK.”  The bell rang and they headed to their English class.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Lunch came and Evelyn broke into her report from the moment she sat down. “He seems to be kind of depressed.” “I thought so.” “Well, maybe not depressed, but worried.” “He’s probably worried about his birthday today after what I said.” “What did you say?” “No, I was just talking about when he got to know me and how it happened.” “Oh...  Well, why don’t you go talk to him?  I saw him around here somewhere.” “Yeah, I think I will.”  Janet stood up and took her tray with her as she left.  She walked out of the cafeteria and found Brendan sitting on the steps that led to the upper level of the school.  He had a rather sullen look on his face as he stared down into his tray, but he looked up somewhat hopefully when he saw Janet come by. “Hi,” she said, sort of timidly. “Hey.  How are you doing?”  His spirits seemed to be lifted somewhat after hearing her speak. “Oh, I'm fine.  Why are you sitting all by yourself?” “Well, I just like to have some time to myself, to think.” “Yeah, well, you could come sit with us if you want.” “Nah, I'm not feeling really up to it right now.” “So, what time?” she asked him vaguely. “Not for a few hours.”  He knew exactly what she was talking about. “Still thinking about it a lot?” “Yeah...”  His cheer seemed to drain from his face.  “I don't really want to talk about it...” “That's OK.  Well, we'll wait for you if you change your mind.” “All right.  See ya.” “Later.”  She left and returned to the table she had previously occupied, but Evelyn was nowhere to be found.  She was evidently taking her shift at the concessions.  Janet sat and finished her lunch quietly, then waited through the remaining few periods left in the day until it was time to leave. She waited out in front of the school for a while; she wanted to see if she could catch Brendan one last time on the way home.  It was about five minutes after when she saw him leave by one of the side doors.  She ran to catch up with him, calling for him to stop as he broke into a jog. “Wait up.” “What is it?” “You wanna walk to my place?” she offered. “Well, my parents get kinda mad if I'm not home on time.” “That's OK.  Why don't you just call them and ask?” “Well, all right...”  He pulled out his cell phone and rang up the number.  Janet only heard Brendan's part of the conversation. “Hey, Dad?  I was wondering if I could head over to a friend's house for a while...  Well, yeah, but--  OK, it's her...  I know...  It'd only be for maybe an hour or so...  OK...  I see...  Bye.”  He hung up and pocketed the phone. “So what'd he say?” Janet asked, trying not to show any eagerness. “He said I can go, but he was kind of angry about the whole thing.” “Great.  Well then, let's go.” “OK.”  There was a slight note of foreboding in his voice, but he tagged along her side as they headed out.  The walk was pretty silent, with only comments about the weather or other similar things.  They neared Janet's empty house when Janet popped the question yet again. “So when is it?  When were you born?” “Does it really matter that much?  Honestly, what's it to you?”  A sudden temper was emerging from his usually mild demeanor. “Are you OK?  You don't normally act like this?  What's--?” “Nothing's wrong!” he burst out loudly.  As he spoke these words, Janet could not take her eyes from him.  A swift wind swept by as he continued to rant and deny any difference in his actions.  Soon, he was still standing before her, only a yellow-white color.  He had transformed already and he didn't even notice it. “Someone's having mood swings,” she retorted.  “Come on, we have to get you inside.” “What are you talking about?  I'm not through with you yet!” “Let's go.”  She grabbed him by the arm and dragged him to the front door. “What are you doing?  What's your problem, Jan?” he protested as she pulled him into the living room. “Shh...” she quieted him.  “Look.” He looked around the room for a few moments and found nothing unusual. “Where?” he asked, sounding stumped. “Here,” she said, poking him in the ribs.  He looked down at himself and almost screamed.  His shoes were barely hanging onto his feet.  His pants, normally too long, were now much shorter on him and his tail filled the left leg out double.  The long-sleeved shirt he had been wearing barely met his elbows and the button on his jeans had snapped open.  He looked on in amazement, then gave Janet a ‘what do I do now?’ look. “How does it feel?” she asked him, smiling knowingly. “Very tight, very uncomfortable,” he managed as he still stood transfixed atop the short flight of stairs from the entryway. “Here, let me help you out.”  She assisted him in removing his shirt and his shoes, the shirt with much difficulty. “Thanks,” he said, turning slightly red. “I'll leave you to do the rest on your own.  The bathroom's downstairs.” “OK.”  He shuffled across the living room and waddled down the stairs to the washroom, taking much care not to ruin his pants.  A short while later, he poked his head around the corner of the wall before coming back into the living room.  He began spilling his thoughts and opinions of the state to her as he fixed his aqua-colored eyes on her. “So this is how it feels.  I like it.  How can they walk like this?  It's cool...  The tail's really nice...  Why this off-white color?”  Janet couldn't help but smile and giggle as he ranted. “You like it, huh?” “Yeah, what's wrong with yellow?” he said, seeming to take offense. “I think it's really cute,” she remarked, walking up to him and reaching up to put her arms around his neck.  He started turning red again, which really set off his faded yellow color. “Really?” he managed, trying not to look directly into her eyes. “Yeah...  I'll be right back...” she said, walking past him to the stairs.  She came back in about a minute in her half-dragon form.  Then she beckoned him with a seductive wave of a claw.  He gulped and followed her into the bathroom after considering for a few seconds.  She drew the blinds to the only window and put her arms around him.  It was almost pitch-black in the room.  Janet leaned closer and wrapped her neck around the back of his.  Brendan knelt down and came all the way down to the floor, rolling over onto his back with Janet still on top. “Isn't this nice?” Janet asked him, pulling her head back from around his neck. “...Yeah, I guess...”  A note in his voice clearly stated that he wasn’t sure. “What's wrong?” “Nothing...  It's just weird...” “That's OK.”  She paused for a moment to move her head just to the side of his.  “Do you love me?” “Umm...”  She scratched lightly up and down his neck with her claws, waiting for him to answer.  “Uhh...” She wrapped her tail around his stomach, still smiling and waiting patiently.  His face was redder than she’d ever seen. “...Of course I do...  It’s just that...”  There was a rather hesitant and apprehensive tone in his voice. “What?” she asked, smiling all the while. “Well...  Maybe it’s nothing,” he answered more confidently and put his arms around her at last. “No, it’s OK.  If there’s something wrong, just say so.”  She sounded genuinely concerned about him. “Maybe I’m just thinking things...”  He paused as he searched for an excuse.  “...Because I’m hungry.” “Well, then take a bite.  Right here,” she said coolly, pointing to her neck. “What are you talking about?  I’m not going to bite you.” “No, it’s all right.  I’ll be fine.” “That’s not what I meant.  I can’t do that to you.  Why’d you even bring it up?” “Oh, I’m just a little concerned,” she said, holding him tighter. “What do you mean?  I don’t...” “Relax.  Just have fun like my crazy father said, OK?” “...OK...  Ooh...”  She was scratching under his chin with her claws and he thought it felt really good.  She smiled and brought her head up momentarily, only to have it come back down swiftly and they started rolling around on the floor, laughing.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Janet and Brendan both came out of the bathroom about ten minutes later.  They both sat down on the couch in the living room, giggling and laughing after the matter.  Janet was the first to snap out of it. “Now what are we going to do to change you back?” she asked wonderingly. “What!?!  How can you be so calm?  I totally forgot about that!” Brendan said, sounding almost ashamed. “Relax, I'll figure it out.  Earth...  Where's something I can use?” “What do you mean, ‘something you can use?’” “Shh, I’m thinking.  After all, your dad said only one hour, right?” “...Yeah.” “Time’s running short.  Wait, maybe I‘d know what to do if we figured out how you transformed in the first place.” “OK.  Well, I was really mad at you about something.  It was strange.  I didn’t want to yell; I just didn’t really want to talk about it.” “...Hmm, so you weren’t really mad at me?” “No, it just made me think of...”  He closed his eyes in pain as the memory from long ago came back to him.  It was then that he began to change yet again.  Janet gasped as he grew to a height that was slightly taller than she was in that form.  He was a brilliant, soft jade color.  The white pad on his chest divided into many that stretched down his front and toward the tip of his tail.  His emerald wings were much larger and more powerful than hers and his claws were sharper, too. Janet stared at him from her seven-foot vantage point and froze, once again unable to look away.  He stretched his wings shortly in the high-ceilinged living room and looked down softly at her frozen face, then at his own body.  His head was very close to the ceiling when he stood up to full height, sixteen feet in the air.  Janet shook her head slightly as his viridian eyes fixed on her again. “Beautiful...” she said audibly, marveling at the depth in his colors.  He took two steps forward and wrapped his tail about her, lifting her effortlessly off the ground until her eyes were level with his. “Jan?” he asked, trying to get her attention.  Her eyes were glazed over and she continued staring at him as though she was in a trance.  “God, this is worse than when guys do it.  Hello?”  He said this very loudly, shaking her in his firm grip.  She finally snapped out of it and shook her head. “Oh, hi, Brendan.” “Hi...  You better figure something out fast; it’s twenty to five already.  I can run to my house in about five minutes, but not like this I won’t.” “Brendan...” she said sort of dreamily. “Not again...  Were you even listening?” “I never realized just how sexy you were...  Until now...” “Cut it out!  I need to get home!” “OK, OK,” she said, shaking her head once more.  “Let me think, then.” She began mumbling and Brendan couldn’t understand what she was saying until she had evidently come to a conclusion. “...Got it!  Why don’t you just hold your breath until you pass out?” “That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard!” “Well, you don’t have any time.  It was the best I could come up with.” “All right, but if this doesn’t work, then you’re gonna have to answer to my dad when I get home,” he said, heading toward the washroom downstairs. “Well then, you might want these,” she said, tossing him his clothes and his bag. “Yeah, whatever.  It better work...” “Fine, just go.”  Janet heard the door shut and she got up off the couch and went to the back door.  She crawled back inside after a visit to the pool and opened the door to the den just in time to hear a loud thump on the floor in the washroom.  She quickly doubled back and peered through the blinds from the outside.  She found Brendan’s human head resting on the toilet; he was out cold. Suddenly, he roused and Janet quickly removed her face from the window and hurried back inside.  She opened the door to the den to see Brendan looking around the corner into the living room. “Hey, I’m over here,” she said.   “I’ll see you late tonight, OK?” Brendan turned around and smiled, then ran toward her and leapt up to give her a hug.  He took her completely by surprise, but she put her arms around him for one last time. “I love you,” he whispered quietly.  Then he came down and dashed out the front door.  Janet smiled happily as she took the steps two at a time up to the living room, curled up in front of the empty fireplace and fell asleep; the words ‘I love you’ were still echoing in her mind.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Janet’s antennae throbbed slightly at the sound of the front door, waking her.  Her eyes opened momentarily.  Then they closed again after she decided that she’d just listen. She felt the slightest shift in the floor as her parents steeped up from the entryway.  She picked up her mother’s tiny whisper to her father. “Look...”  Janet could tell that she was in a very good mood.  She must have been satisfied with her father’s explanation that day.  She felt the floor shift again and heard the creaking of the staircase; it was obvious that her father wasn’t in nearly such a good mood.  She ventured a guess that he was tired and exasperated.  He probably couldn’t be more ready for bed. Suddenly, she felt her mother’s presence by her side.  She began rubbing her neck slowly up and down.  This was a very rare occasion.  Janet was very knowledgeable about how skittish her mother generally was when she was in her dragon form. ‘Perhaps Dad’s agony wasn’t in vain,’ she thought silently.  She smiled and sighed through her nose as her mother slowly worked down to her lower back, which was quite a walk. As her mother massaged her sleek, deep blue scales, Janet’s tail found its way around her leg, a smile appearing on her mother’s face as she stopped.  Janet’s head rose up, level with her mother’s and they both laughed. “I knew you were awake,” her mother said in mock defense. “Sure you did.  Geez, Mom.  What am I?  A giant dog?” “Well, I’ve never had a pet before,” she said innocently. “Gee, thanks, Mom.” “Yeah, well, I guess it’s different when your pet is also your daughter.”  She tried her hardest not to smile at Janet’s somewhat loathsome expression.  It softened as she spoke, though. “What’s gotten into you?  Did Dad tell you about everything yet?” “Yeah, I put him through the wringer, but I think he deserved it to some extent.  It’s a lot easier to bear now that I understand it.” “Yeah, I bet he had a heck of a time telling you, huh?” Janet said with a smile creeping on her face. “Mm-hmm.”  She was looking off somewhere.  Janet knew exactly what she was thinking. “OK, enough about Dad.  I know what you’re thinking; it’s pick-on-the-daughter time again, right?  I’ll start then.  How much do you think I weigh?”  Her mother started laughing before she could answer. “All right.  If that’s the way you want it.” “Come on.  So how much?  You know that scale up there’ll be broken,” she said, pointing up the stairs to the hallway.  As if she had given a stage cue, her father hurried to the landing, looking quite refreshed all of a sudden. “Did my ears deceive me or did I hear pick-on-the-daughter time?” he said, hurrying down the stairs and taking a seat next to her mother on the couch. “Dad...” they both groaned rather contemptuously. “All right, all right...  Geez, I swear.  No respect,” he complained after being banished to the den. “Your guess, Mom?” Janet said, standing up to full height. “I don’t know, Jan...  I’d have to say at least four thousand.”  Janet’s eyes almost popped out of her head. “Well, maybe if I was made of aluminum and reinforced carbon steel, but God, Mom.  That was brutal; that hurts right here,” she said, pointing to her heart. “Well, I figured you were a little bigger than a car, so...” “Materials, Mom, materials.  Scales, flesh, bones, OK?” “OK, maybe twenty-five hundred?” “That’s probably much closer.  Anyway...” “Wait.  Wait.  We’re not done until it’s proven.  You know how it goes.” “Aw, Mom.  Do we have to?” Janet protested. “Yes.  That’s the way it’s always been.  Although I don’t know quite how we’re gonna pull this one off.” “I’ve got a pressure scale in the garage,” a voice came from downstairs. “Oh, that would work!” her mother answered.  “Where did you get it, Joseph?” “Got it at the factory.  Just asked them if I could borrow it to do some work here.” “You heard him, Jan.  Come on!” “Uurgh...” Janet growled as she reluctantly trudged along behind them, ducking to avoid the low ceiling beginning at the stairs and standing up again when they entered the garage. “You were listening to us again, weren’t you?” her mother asked with her eyes narrowed. “Nope, not me.  I didn’t hear anything,” he said, turning red. “What a crock.  Well, go ahead, Jan.”  Her mother pointed to the large, square, grated aluminum scale, which was about five feet across.  She set one foot down, watching the plate shift under the weight.  Then she brought the other next to it.  Her parents’ faces both came in close to see the red display.  Janet had to crane her neck down quite a way to read it: 1,424 pounds.  All their eyes went wide, even her father’s.  After all, he had been eavesdropping.  It was much less than anyone would think. “Not even a ton,” her mother breathed.  Then her father started razzing her. “Boy, you’re a sexy beast, now,” he said, raising his eyebrows.  She would have slapped him if it weren’t for two things: the fact that he was her father, which she considered overruling anyway and the fact that she would have probably torn off half his face on accident. “You know, Dad,” she started.  “I’m a little hungry all of a sudden.” She came down upon him with a wide, toothy smile and that was the end of that. “Is it just me, or is it cold in here?” he said, trying to change the subject. “I think it’s fine,” Janet said without concern.  “If you’re cold, then let’s go back inside, shall we?” She seized him with her tail and pulled him into the house, lifting him over the banister and placing on the landing upstairs.  He looked at her with wide eyes as she released him. “All right.  I think it’s time everyone went to bed.  Go on.  I’ll be right up,” she said as she tromped back down the stairs to the washroom. “She’s really strong, honey,” her father said, still taken aback by the swift feat. “Yeah, you’ll just have to get used to it, dear.”  Her mother sighed in a ‘one who knows all’ sort of way and pushed him up the few remaining steps and down the hall to their room. A short while later, Janet listened at the same door to hear her mother sound asleep.  She didn’t hear the familiar snoring of her father, though.  She smiled knowingly and peered through the door; he was sitting up, staring straight ahead.  She pointed a pretend gun at him and made a shooting noise.  He fell backward onto his pillow and soon, he was snoring.  She giggled and pulled out her cell phone, returning to her bedroom.  She checked the time before dialing Brendan’s number.  It was well after midnight already. “Hi, Jan.” “Hi...  What’s up?”  She sounded a bit surprised. “I knew it was you.  Who else would call at twelve-thirty?” “Yeah, all right.  Whose place?  Yours or mine?” “I’m already here.” “What do you mean?” “I’m sitting in your backyard.” “OK...  That was random.” “Could you let me in?  It’s getting cold out here.” “Really?  OK, I’ll be right down.  So you figured out how to work it, huh?” “Yeah, I did.  It’s not too hard.  Anyway, thanks.  See ya.” “Bye.”  She quickly undressed and filled the sink with water.  She plunged her face in and closed the door with her tail as she ran down the stairs.  She came to the back door and walked outside, pajamas in claw as usual, and took a seat on the bench next to her boyfriend.  She was surprised that the bench didn’t break under their combined weight. “Hey, I thought you were going to let me inside.  Look at the pool, it’s freezing out here,” he complained again, massaging his arms.  The pool had frozen over for the fourth consecutive night in a row and Janet thought for a moment. “I know a place that’s warm...  It’s my special place, ever since I was a little girl.” “Where is it?” “It’s at the beach.” “Are you sure?  That’s quite a way,” he said, looking almost skeptical. “Yeah.  I used to love to climb rocks.  Let’s go.”  They both took off.  Janet had to beat her wings much faster to keep up with him. “Hey!  Could you slow down a bit?  I’m dyin’ back here!” “Sorry,” he said, simply gliding as she flew at her normal speed. “Honestly, how can you do that?”  She was a bit jealous. “What can I say?  I guess I just have the wings for it,” he said, trying to sound innocent; he was.  Janet gazed down at all of the tiny city lights below and soon the coast came into view. “That was fast,” she said, sounding slightly surprised.  “So how long did it take you to get to my place?” “A minute and a half,” he said, smiling proudly. “Well, I asked for that one,” she mused as they began their descent.  “There’s the entrance.” She was pointing to a huge pile of large rocks that surrounded a cliff face. “In the rocks?” he asked. “Yes.  Don’t you see that hole near the top?” “Oh, OK.  Gotcha.”  They landed and Janet clambered to the top, sinking into the large gap.  Brendan looked around before joining her, still shivering slightly in the cold. “Follow me,” she said. “Where?” “Over here.  There’s a passageway.” “That’s a solid wall.” “No, it isn’t!” she protested and Brendan watched her walk right through the wall.  His eyes went wide and he rubbed them with the back of his claws.  “Well, aren’t you coming?” “OK, hang on.  There’s a problem.  I can hear you, but I can’t see you.  You can see me?” “Yeah, you’re looking right at me.  Come on.” “OK...  I can’t.”  Janet watched him as he tried to come closer; his face pressed up against something invisible. “That’s weird...  Try thinking it’s not there, like you can just walk ahead.” “OK...”  He backed up and closed his eyes, then walked forward and almost ran into her.  “Did I do it?” “Well, I’m right here.  Does that answer your question?” “All right.” “You know; this would be a good place for us to meet.” “Why do you say that?” “Well, if I’m the only person who can see the entrance, nobody will be able to find it but us.” “That’s true.  Whoa, this place is a lot bigger than I thought it might be,” he said, staring past her at the long passage.  Janet walked ahead of him, deeper into the cave.  Shortly, they came to a two-way split, but Brendan’s mind changed when he saw Janet walk through the wall between the two passageways.  He shook his head once, then followed her. “You walked through another wall, Jan,” he said when he caught sight of her again.  “Hey, what’s down the other paths?” “I don’t know.  I only went this way.”  The temperature started rising and it soon grew to a comfortable level as Janet led him into a large, steaming chamber. “Hot springs?” Brendan guessed in amazement. “Bingo.” ‘Uh-oh,’ he thought to himself.  “Hey, are there any other exits to this room?  You know, like ones I can’t see?” “Yeah, there’s one at the back, but I can’t see in there.  It’s too dark.  Come on.  You said you were cold.  This one in the center’s even big enough even for the two of us.”  Janet was surprised that she could stand the heat here as she stepped into the biggest hot spring Brendan had ever seen. “I’ll be right there.  Where did you say that passage was?” “Brendan, you’re avoiding...” “Wait.”  The room fell silent.  “Did you hear that sound?” “No.  What sound?” “That scratching and clawing sound.  You hear it?” “That was me and you know it.  C’mere you wuss!”  Brendan finally walked over and sank into the spring with her.  They eyed each other from opposite ends, waiting for the other to make a move.  Janet looked down at the steaming water and Brendan started advancing on her. “Wait.  What if this water changes me back?” she asked, eyeing him warily. “Why?  Just because it’s hot?” “Yeah.” “I’m sorry, missy, but you’re in the game.  You even started it.  You can’t quit now.”  A completely different voice had taken over; Brendan was evidently ready to play. “Time out.  Honestly, what if it does?” she protested as he stopped moving toward her. “Then that’s just the chance you’ll have to take,” he said with an almost malicious smirk.  “Come on.  We haven’t got all night.” “All right.  If that’s how you want it.”  She readied herself and quickly glanced at her pajamas near the edge of the spring.  She turned back, but she was too late.  Water sprayed in all directions as Brendan tackled Janet, forcing her down into the water with his strength.  She waited at the bottom and saw him through the steam.  He was evidently waiting for her to come back up.  Instead, she wrapped his leg and took him down, as well.  She startled him and he had barely taken a breath before falling into the depths. “What?  You can’t breathe?” she said, smiling sort of wickedly as they eyed each other under the surface.  She pulled him up with her and he took a deep breath, shaking the water from his nose. “Seriously, that was not cool.”  Brendan’s game face had diminished entirely. “What’s wrong?  You charged me.”  Janet’s tail was still around his leg. “OK, OK.  It was just a ploy.  I knew you’d be ready, but I wasn’t.  All I wanted to know was what was in that passage.” “Well, if didn’t want to do this, you should’ve just told me.  I would understand.” “Yeah, well, maybe I just thought that you wouldn’t,” he said, turning his head away.  She pressed up against his shoulder. “I’ll always understand,” she said softly. “I hate to burst your bubble, but I find that to be humanely impossible.” “Bite me,” she retorted indignantly. “I was only stating a commonly accepted principle of human society,” he said, looking innocent. “No, really, bite me,” she repeated, pointing again to her neck. “Not this again...  What’s with you?  Are you a masochist or something?” “No.  You’ll see.  Just do it.” “Whatever...”  He put his mouth about her neck and pressed down, then released her. “Come on, you didn’t even break through the scales.  Are you afraid that you’ll hurt me?” “I guess so...”  His face turned red. “Don’t worry.  Remember?  I heal probably a hundred times faster than anyone else does.” “...Well...  All right...”  He tried again, much harder this time and he broke through.  She winced as his teeth sank into her flesh and to her surprise, he didn’t take his mouth away.  Brendan instincts started screaming inside of him when he smelled her flesh.  With much difficulty, he pushed them aside, his mind finally taking precedence and he pulled away, his mouth dripping with saliva. ‘How cannibalistic,’ he thought, reflecting on the instinctual drive that almost escaped him.  He held her tight and looked on in apprehension as blood and saliva slowly trickled down her neck.  Then a relieved expression came over his face as the wound sealed itself within a matter of seconds.  He dipped his claw in the hot water and wiped off the excess fluids, still open-mouthed. “Are you all right?” he asked hopefully.  Janet’s head was very still and her eyes were closed.  Her breathing was very slow and even.  After a few seconds, she opened her eyes and looked at him, smiling happily. “I’m fine...  Ohh...”  A sudden pang in the pit of her stomach caused her to lurch forward and she collapsed on his shoulder.  Something had gone horribly wrong.   14 Brendan hefted Janet’s body and laid her down against the edge of the spring.  He sat by her side in the shallows with a serious expression on his face.  She moaned periodically and she almost seemed to have lost consciousness otherwise.  She moaned once more and suddenly her eyes shot open wide with dismay.  There was a period of silence.  Then a dull clunk was heard beneath the still waves. Brendan looked as though his ears had deceived him, glancing around through the hot steam.  Janet knew exactly what had happened, but she didn’t believe it until she dove down into the water.  There it was, just bigger than any turkey that God could come up with.  She took it and heaved it slowly to the surface.  Brendan smiled in wonder as Janet grinned, holding the largest egg either of them had seen. “I’m a mother,” she whispered.  Brendan laid a claw on the egg.  It felt strange; the hard shell was as cold as ice, but there was definitely great warmth emanating from the core. “...And I’m a father,” he said, shaking his head.  “They take a long time to hatch, though.” “Uh-huh,” she replied, looking at the runny stripes of pastel blues and greens on the egg’s smooth surface.  “Where are we going to keep it?  Is it supposed to be hot or cold?” “Good question.  I don’t know either.  Most eggs are supposed to be kept warm.  Well, odds are that this one will be healthy wherever we decide.  The dragon’s environmental mortality is pretty flexible.” “So you’re saying that whether it’s kept cold or warm it’ll be OK?” “Yes.  It may turn out different depending on the temperature, though.  It’d probably be best off if we just left it here in the spring.” “Yeah, I guess so.  So do you want to check out that passage?” “Yeah, how dark is it, really?” “I can’t see anything in there.  It’s pitch-black.” “Where is it?  I just want to try my luck.” “It’s right there in the center on the back wall.  A little to your left...  OK, go,” she said, leaving the egg at the bottom of the spring and following behind him.  Brendan opened his eyes after he passed through the wall.  He was barely able to discern the edges of the walls in the passage. “Jan?” “Right here.” “Follow me closely.  Grab my tail or something.” “OK...”  Slowly, they walked down the passage.  It was gradually descending and every so often it bent one way or the other.  Brendan was most cautious of the ground beneath them. “It’s getting colder,” he said.  “Are you OK back there?” “I’m fine, but you’re right.  It is colder.”  After a few more minutes of tiptoeing through the long and winding tunnel, Brendan spoke again. “Hey, I think I see something down there.  It’s like a blue light.”  He was correct.  They hurried toward the light and turned the corner.  Brendan stopped in his tracks. “Look,” he said in awe.  Before them was a chamber similar to the previous one.  Here, however, everything was frozen over.  Steaming pools of sub-zero froth covered the landscape and a pedestal stood, set in ice, at the opposite end.  This was the first thing Brendan’s eyes locked onto and thus, he flew over the frigid springs to examine it.  Janet took a few steps inside and looked at the walls and the ceiling, where groups of crystals had formed, leaving behind sheets of ice that covered the surrounding rock. “Whoa, I didn’t know two places like this could coexist this close to each other.  Let alone the fact that this place is only about ten miles from my house...” Brendan called to her, shivering uncontrollably in the intense cold. “Jan, l-look at th-this.  Th-there’s some k-kind of s-slot for a gem, b-but it’s e-empty.”  Janet flew over to join him and held him tightly in the cold. “That’s not just for any gem.  It would have to be perfectly cut.  There’s probably only one in the world that would fit.” “Wh-where is it, th-though?  It l-looks like somebody t-took it.” “Well, we can’t do anything about it, unless you happen to find a perfect sapphire lying around.” “Yeah, you’re r-right...  Wait.  Wh-What if th-there w-was never a-anything in th-there?” “I reiterate; we can’t do anything unless we have the gem.” “OK...” he gave in, crestfallen.  “Wait!  Wh-what about th-the other t-tunnels?” The gleam of a true explorer came to his eyes as he smiled at Janet.  Without a word, they dashed headlong back into the tunnel, piercing the blackened passage with the speed of a freshly thrown javelin.  The darkness waned in their eyes as courage and renewed emotional strength shoved them onward.  In a trice, the two half-breeds had returned to the original chamber and they slowed only to look upon their new pride and joy, the image of which pulsated in the burbling waves of the largest spring. With last fleeting glances, the twosome split up, each taking a path to explore.  They were cast apart for no more than a minute as the two ascending passages joined at a small chamber.  As each dragon turned to regroup, Janet’s eyes fell upon the only other exit in the chamber, which was set between the two tunnels from whence they had come. “No, Brendan,” Janet cautioned and she stopped his progress with a swift claw.   “Only I must go.  It is the way it was intended; I have a feeling that I was the only one who was actually supposed to enter this place.” Brendan looked at the entrance, which seemed to be sealed by a light blue, rippling magical field.  He reached for Janet, but stopped as he realized that he could not stop her as she approached the opaque portal.  She turned back to him just before she came to it. “I’ll be back.  It’s just like a door, but only I can pass through.  Wait here, you’ll see.”  She closed her eyes and purposefully stepped through the barrier; her body faded before Brendan’s eyes.  He sat down slowly and bowed his head in concentration, praying for her safe return.  He had only begun when she appeared before him. “It’s a tiny room with some kind of inscriptions on the wall.  It’s really hard for me to read.  I’ll try again.”  She turned to go, but Brendan stopped her. “Wait!  ...I heard something earlier...  Something not of this world.  It came from down there,” he said, pointing to the ground. “You’re hearing things.  Come on.  It can’t be that bad without me, can it?” she said, giggling quietly. “Maybe you’re right, but I’m still going to be listening.”  Janet shook her head, smiling, and entered the portal again.  This time Brendan heard the distinct sound of an electric shock, or something similar.  He was about to sneak back down through the passage to find it, but he decided that he had better wait for Janet.  No sooner had the thought left his mind than she materialized before him yet again. “I was only able to make out something like ‘deep in the past’ and ‘four temples.’  What does it mean?” “I don’t know, but I know that I heard that sound again.  Let’s go.” “Whatever...”  They tiptoed down the passage and Janet looked around the corner and into the main chamber; there was nothing wrong that she could see. “Still looks deserted.  Are you sure you’re feeling all right?” “Something is amiss; I can sense it.  You’ve got to believe me, Jan.  Remember the weather bet we made?” “...You’re right.  Let’s take a closer look.”  She crept into the room with Brendan right behind her.  When she looked into the spring, she froze in horror. “What’s wrong?  Are you all right?” he asked, seeing her unnaturally still form, then he, too, froze on the spot.  The egg had disappeared.  Brendan looked around all over the place, expecting to find another dragon, but there was no way it could have hatched in an hour’s time; someone had taken it.  Janet was sobbing softly and the rationality in Brendan’s mind was slowly slipping away.  Then a single word ceased all activity as he snatched his logic back. “Stop.”  Brendan’s eyes were fixed on the ground where a small metal trinket lay.  “I found something.” Janet turned around and her watery eyes fell where he was pointing.  He took the device in his claw and examined it.  It appeared to be simply two metal rods attached at their long ends.  He attempted to pry them apart with no luck. “Here, let me try,” Janet offered. “Have at it,” Brendan said with a baffled expression as he passed it to her. “Maybe it opens this way.”  She tried sliding the rods apart by rubbing them against each other’s long sides.  A small click was audible and she pulled them apart; a red field appeared between them.  Brendan marveled at her indirect approach to the problem.  He touched the red field with his claw; it was solid as a wall. “That’s odd...  Wait, Janet.  Look!”  He was pointing to small recessed buttons near the ends of each rod.  Janet poked the ones near the top of each rod and the rods extended upward, making the red field between them larger.  She pressed the lower ones in succession and the rods extended downward, as well. “Cool,” Brendan said plainly.  “...But what does it do?” Each rod was about eight feet long and the red field moved between the rods as Janet moved them. “I don’t know.” “Hey, I heard an electric shock sound earlier.  I don’t know if that helps any.” “Well, maybe it was this thing.” “Jan, what if it’s a teleportation device?  Whoever took the egg couldn’t have run away that fast.” “This is getting crazier by the second.  OK, let’s just think about this logically.  Supposing that this person isn’t a water dragoness like me, they wouldn’t be able to find this place because of the barriers...” “So what if it only works in certain areas?  What if they teleported inside here and got to this room from somewhere else?” “You may have something there.  This room is surrounded by those barriers, right?  The ones that appear like rock walls?” “Yeah...  Wait a second.  I didn’t have to go through the wall on the way back from the ice room.  It must’ve just been a one-way deal.” “OK, then let’s try this thing in there.”  Janet pushed the bottom extensions of the device back in and followed Brendan back into the passage.  As they walked through the darkness, Janet held the device at various, trying to get it to work. “Honestly, Jan, who would just go and steal a dragon egg out of the blue?” “Maybe some sick person thought they could sell it on E-bay or something.  I don’t know; I’m just as clueless as you are.”  They came to the frozen chamber and Janet took a few steps inside, then stopped as the red field turned blue.  Both pairs of eyes widened with excitement and they glanced at one another, smiling.  Brendan stuck his claw through it, then pulled it back out; the familiar electric shock sound was audible as he broke the field.  A wide grin came over his face. “Whoever took it is gonna pay...with their life!!!”  End Prelude

       I was thinking, when this site has a few members, to suggest something to the Jagex staff. This suggestion has two parts: 1. The Runebag: This helps mages to store runes and saves inventory space. As arrows and bolts can be equiped, it's only fair. 2. Steeds: Everyone has only asked for horses so far. Why not mules, asses, mares, and stallions? That way, the poor players will have the ability for backup and speed.  If you agree with this, post your comment. Much appreciated!

       I would like to introduce meetings of members on this site and add eachother on RuneScape friends list. I would suggest leaving your usually visited world and your username.  I am:  Battlesuprme  World 17  Just leave your post in 'comments'. We should meet in world 17 when we reach 50 users and recruit users the entire day.

      The triangle is composed of 3 battletypes:                   Archer,           Warrior,                                       Mage,  The type clockwise is the battletype's weakness. Eg. Warrior loses to Mage. Mage loses to Archer. Ect.  With multiple types of battle, you may be 'impure'. This means being two or three different types. You will still have the weakness of your highest skill, but you will infilct all weaknesses, depending on the weapon you currently weild.   I suggest that you keep all three weapon types: Staff, bow/crossbow/thowing knives/throwing axes, and sword/mace/battle hammer/ax. This way, you will have the apropriate tool to train ANY battle skill at ANY time.

       This hint will make your playing experience on RuneScape a little cooler.   Become an Archer/Warrior. Have your sword or other warrior weapon out and keep bolts in your quiver. Join the pheonix gang in Varrock. Go to the weapons store and kill the weapons master(You must be lvl 20 or have mith/ammy/silverlight).  Then take the crossbows. You may wait for them to respawn and take more. Keep one and put the rest in the bank. Train your ranged to more than your attack skill if not already done.   With your sword out and leather armor, attack a mage in the wilderness or accept a challenge. Change your weapon to the crossbow(that's why your wearing leather). The mage will have an auto weakness to ranging. He will soon die.   Take the mage's items. Now, you are probably rich and strong. You will be immune to both warrior's and archer's weakness points. You now have only dragons to fear!

       Mages are becoming ever popular, though Rangers are DESTROYING them. Here is a guide to stop that, and look good doing it....  First: All Mages MUST be able to Runecraft. Making your own runes take time but is worth it. Go to the Duke in Lumbridge Castle, second floor. Talk to him. Then, after excepting the quest, go to Draynor Village. You will find a southern path where you see a cement port. It is actually the way to the Wizard's Tower. Then, go through, talking to a bunch of NPC's to get quests. Then, back to the first floor. Use the trap door. Deliver the Talisman to the only talking NPC. Go into another room. You will see a skull. Pick it up, but be prepared: A skeleton will attack. It will disapear at 1/2 health. This is the skull from the Restless Ghost quest!First, go to the Rune shop in Varrock. Talk to the shop keeper. Give him the item. On your way to Draynor, stop by the Lumbridge Graveyard. Put the skull in the coffin to gain quest points. Then, go back to the Tower and talk to the Wizard again.   Second:Make sure you have a pick ax. And inventory space. Select teleport from either the Rune shop keeper or the Wizard. They will teleport you to where to mine.. Rune Essences!   Third:After filling up, use the portal. Then, use locate with the air talisman. It will bring you near Draynor if you follow the pull. Select 'use' when at the stones and boulders. Click on the big stone called 'Mysterious Runes'. With the talisman selected, it will teleport you to the Altar of Air.  Select to use the Essences with the Altar. All your essences will be turned into Air Runes. Congratulations! You crafted your first runes!  Fourth: At lvl 2 runecraft, kill imps. They will probably drop the Mind Talisman. Use locate and you will come to MORE mysterious runes. Select use and click on the big rock, as before. You may repeat this when your new lvl says you can craft the next type with the talisman and location of the next type.  Fifth: Now, with about 1000 runes of each type, as you may have unlimited completed runes, attack a Warrior in the wilderness. You will probably when, if it is within 10 lvls. Next, train defensively with your staff.  Sixth: Beat a Ranger repeatedly with your staff. It will count as warrior, the Ranger's weakness. You have beaten the Archer!

      Ghettosquirl, the Free Cooking and Strength potion posts belong in the clan blog. No problem, but they are better suited there. Also, please donate Bronze and Iron bars and maybe even Steel bars to Ghettosquirl. And donate logs, also.
