      Time to look at these 2 giants seperatly.  And see whether or not these two even deserve to be in the same room as each other.    FUTURE PROJECTS     HANKS:    Polar Express, A Cold Case, and The Risk Pool.   Sure the latter 2 were just announced, and the Polar Express is in post-production.  But at least we KNOW that they will be released eventually.   SPIELBERG:    Indiana Jones 4, War of the Worlds, and Jurassic Park 4.   Indy 4 was supposed to begin filming several months ago but no one involved with it can agree on a script.  And that stopped Temple of Doom how?  Jurassic Park 4 is supposidly finding a writer, but you know what?  Ain't gonna happen.  War of the Worlds?  I won't be holding my breath.  Stevey has got his hands in so many cookie-jars he forgot which one was chocolate chip, which one was oatmeal, and which one was raisin.   WINNER!  Hanks!      PRODUCER CREDITS     HANKS:    CastAway.   No, Tom Hanks hasn't produced a lot of movies, but check these out. . . .   SPIELBERG:    Men in Black II, Evolution, Gremlins 2 The New Batch, Harry and the Hendersons.   Quite possibly, the widest variety of crap and crap-ola one could ever hope to find in a resume.  I'm surprised the Hollywood going public hasn't risen as one, and slayed him yet.   WINNER!  Hanks!      TELEVISION PRODUCER CREDITS     HANKS:    My Big Fat Greek Life.   I!!!. . . . . .you know what, uh-uh.  No way can Tom win this one.   WINNER! Spielberg!       TELEVISION APPEARANCES     HANKS:    Bosom Buddies.   He played Kip "Buffy" Wilson.  A man who dressed like a woman to live in a woman's only apartment.  You sly dog!  HA HA!!  What adventures and mis-haps WON'T you get yourself into?  Coincidence that his wife is Rita WILSON!!!  I think not.   SPIELBERG:    Tiny Toon Adventures, Tracy Ullman Show, The Martin Short Show.   In each tv show, Mister Spielberg played. . .HIMSELF!  WOW! What a freaking wide arc of characters.  Such range, such emotion.  How freaking PREDICTABLE!  We know you're a selfish hog.  That's why we laugh at you no matter WHEN you play yourself.  Sell out.   WINNER!  Hanks!   No matter which way you slice it, Spielberg would be up the chocolate river without a spoon.  Enjoy him while you've got him Steven.  Less we forget Joe Vs. The Volcano.

      Are you crazy? Why would you want them to turn each other down.  Everytime they do a project together, we get a classic film.  Saving Private Ryan was the best war film in twenty years, and Catch Me If You Can is the best Spielberg flick since the first Jurassic.  Besides, they're respectively, the best in their fields.  Who else are they gonna work with?  It's rare that two masters of their crafts do one project together, let alone three or four.    Take a second to marvel at the brilliance of the Terminal.  And the balls of Hanks and Spielberg.  It's a film set in an airport Terminal, about a foreigner.  Post 9/11, that takes guts.  Second, Hanks is doing an accent.  We all know how the world feels about dumbass accents on major stars.  Hell, Costner is still getting slammed for the "English" accent he sported in Robin Hood.  Yet Spiels took a chance on this flick and will open it as a Summer movie?  Guts, man.  And more than that, at least they're trying.  Spiels makes a flick per year.  And each one is more different than the last.  Name me one other master director with a film output that high.  And with such consistently good quality of film?  You gotta get off the artists who work, man.  The ones that make daring choices and risk failure.  Julia makes the same safe, romantic comedy bullshit year in and year out.  But look at the Cruiser's last ten flicks.  Or Hanks.  Or DiCaprio.  Or Brad Pitt.  Are they repeating themselves?  Hell no.  They go out there on a limb, and still make bank.  Still bring people in.  There's a reason they're the best.  And it's not cause they take every script that comes there way.  Quite the opposite... they choose the right projects, that will challenge them.  That will show something new.  And that will still satisify the masses.  Kids got skillz.  Let 'em work it.    Besides, I'd take a Speilberg-Hanks flick any day of the week and twice on Sunday if it means we don't get an A.I. every year.  Or a Ladykillers.  Get my point?

      June 18, 2004 will bring about the third time Tom Hanks will star in a Spielberg Joint.  As talented as he is, it would be refreshing for me if the Hanks actually  TURNED DOWN  every script Steven sent his way.  What would happen if Mr. Spielberg acquired the rights to House of 1,000 Corpses 2?  BAM!  Tom Hanks career is immediatley in the shitter.   CASTING DIRECTOR:   Well Mister Hanks, your career certainly speaks for itself.  2 consecutive Oscars, blockbuster after blockbuster.  I think the studio would love to have you aboard Gone With The Wind 2, if you'll just. . . Wait a minute.  Wait one Lilly-pad loving, horse-shoe laying, Jimmy Crack Corn minute.  That was YOU in House of 1,00 Corpses 2!!!!  Next please.  In the terminal, Tom Hanks plays a character from a country we've never heard of before, and has an accent that is really out of place.  If ever there was a role for Bronson Pinchot.  How I long for the return of Balki.  From the small country of Mypos.  Tell me this role wasn't written for him.  Hell, even Cousing Larry, Mark Linn-Baker, could make an appearance.  I'm pretty sure he's got nothing going for him today.  HA HA!  Remember that episode of Perfect Stranger when Larry bought a chair that played music directly into your ear, and it got stolen, and then he and Balki installed a super-duper burgular system?  And totally f'ed up their apartment?  Excellent!  What I can't wait for is Jurassic Park 4.  How awsome is it going to be to see Tom Hanks running beside Sam Neil and Jeff Goldbloom as they flee and scurry from a Giantosaurruasomopolis-Rex?  Spielberg and Tom Hanks make an okay team.  But enough is enough.

      If the big boys of comedy had any balls, we'd be seeing that movie on marquees come 2005.  I mean, if you're gonna go and make a comedy about a dumb, insignificant "sport", man go all the way.  People getting hit in the head is funny, but hitting a ball in circles, with no real winner, well that’s gold!  Tetherball is on the rise, too.  Witness the cult phenomenon that is Napoleon Dynamite.  A character in search of a better movie, but funny nonetheless.  Napoleon is a big time Tetherball fan, and can be seen playing the game all over the flick.  And since the sports world, and more specifically ESPN, will air any sport (see the new Extreme Dodgeball show), the likelihood of a Professional Tetherball Association (The PTA?  Hmmm...) is all the more a possibility.  I'd also like to give a shout to this kick ass this new era of comedy we got going.  I don't know how, I guess by association, but the five or ten best funny actors we have keep making movies together.  Actors so good they can make a movie about Dodgeball (!) of all things, funny.  Ferrell, Stiller, Piven,  Vaughn, the Wilson’s et al.  It's about time Hollywood started putting them all together.  There’s so much great comedy now, it makes me look back and wonder how we made it through the barren one funny guy comedies of the late 90's.    We should have this trend more in other genres.  Imagine a series of action films starring The Rock, Bruce Willis, Stallone, The Governator and Will Smith.  With them all saving the world or mowing down terrorists.  I'd pay to see that any day of the week.  I'd ask for more of the same in drama, but we have it where we need it.  Mamet has his group, as does PTA, and to a small extent Kevin Smith.  I love it when a group of talented people do multiple projects together.  You can see that they like each other, and the energy and chemistry come off on-screen.  I'm so tired of watching actors who you know hate each other.  Who have absolutely zero chemistry.  There's a real reason why Tom Hanks keeps making romcoms with Meg Ryan.  I'm all about exploring more of the same magic.    Here's hoping we get more of this Golden Era of comedy.  And with it, the ultimate extreme definitive landmark event that is TETHERBALL: THE MOVIE!!

      It has been a long time coming, but thank goodness someone had the dodgeBALLS to finally make a movie about this sport.  And a sport it is.  Naysayers.    Dodgeball was the ultimate playground game  EVER!!   And there's nothing better than hearing that reverberating dodgeball *PING* resonating off of some poor schmucks shin.  And now, because of this release, there is a plethora of specials about the actual game coming to television.  Including EXTREME DODGEBALL on ESPN!!!  Woo-Hoo!  And I'm more convinced than anyone that Vince Vaughn has the heart of a champion so recquired to bring this re-incarnation of  Any Given Sunday  to life.  Remember his chain smoking rendition of an olympic ring competitor in Old School?  Classic.  And of course we have Ben Stiller up to his old tricks.  Playing the over zealous, over amitious, over annoying fittness guru.  Gee Stiller, haven't seen that before!!  But still, he gets body armor.  BODY ARMOR IN DODGE BALL!  Why didn't I think of that before?  It's so freakin' simple, it's genius.  Dodgeball is steadily back on the rise, and if God permits me, I will join my state Dodgeball Team and knock the shit out of anyone who crosses my path.  Just to hear that lovely, *PING!*

      First off, never mess with a video game freak.  Secondly, never mess with an autistic kid.  Thirdly, never miss with the cinematic class The Wizard!  That movie was glory personified.  The mad hype for that film rivaled the biggest of today's blockbusters.  I couldn't watch Saturday Morning Cartoons for four seconds without getting the newest episode of Prostars interrupted by Wizard ads.  And you forget, Savage was at the top of his game in 1989.  Coming off The Princess Bride, prepping Little Monsters.  The kid was king.  F the Culkin kid.  Wonder Years was consistently the best show on television, and at least half of that was due to the Fredster.  Yes, now he's kinda has-beenish.  And his head is too small for his body.  But you still gotta recognize!  The Wizard is a dream come true for most kids.  I grew up on Nintendo.  I called the hotlines looking for the last quarter heart in The Legend of Zelda.  I had Punch Out Tournaments with friends.  It was all about video games.  And little Jimmy Woods was a cool geek God.  What kid didn't want to run rampant through the Uni Studios and compete in a Nintendo Tournament in the Clocktower building from Back to the Future?  I challenge you to find one adolescent boy that doesn't love this movie.  All the coolness and I haven't even gotten to Christian Slater yet.  Hard Harry and video games?  Dude, game on!  As far your question of making that movie now... it's definitely possible to some extent.  The thing is, you'd have to limit the movie to game console games.  Cause Jimmy can't operate a computer. He may have trouble with some of the newfangled games, but that would only lead to a kick ass Rocky-style training montage where he gets the eye of the Yoshi and regains his Playstation prowess.  There are tons of gaming competitions these days.  And since all the Wizard ever did was play games and think about his sister, it’s not impossible to think that he could get enough gaming time to ball up the generation of gaming geeks.  His only challenge would be the newfound complexity of today's games.  The shit ain't side scrolling no more.  3-D worlds and interactive background are where it's at.  Jimmy couldn't just grab the warp whistle and be done with the level.  He'd have to deliver a package to one place, lift a hidden lever, defeat the game boss, steal a car and find the level weapon.  Which reminds me, the reason Jimmy won is because he's got an intuitive memory.  Mario 1 had the same trick that Jimmy used to find the whistle.  He just figured that the level he'd be playing would be a throwback to something they knew, or had played.  The cocky Lucas was too busy pimping his shit to realize what he had.    Jimmy Woods would wipe the digital floor with your Jurassic ass.  You could even give him a handicap and he'd still find a way through it.  He could play Sonic the Hedgehog as a turtle and still nab the high score.  Kid was scary good.  And it will be proven when we get a sequel:  The Wizard 2: Game On!  Bangarang Truthbringer!

      Does anyone remember The Wizard?  The movie that came out in 1989 starring Fred Savage (Corey) and Luke Edwards (Jimmy)?  About a semi-retarded kid who could excell at only one thing, video-games.  Now, when I say video-games, I'm speaking of course about your classics.  Ninja Gaiden, Rygar, Ice-Brothers, and Joust.  And this little genius, or "Wizard" could mop the floor with you and your sister at these games if you even so much as looked at him the wrong way.  But keep in mind this was all pre-Super Nintendo.  Hell, this was pre-Genisus.  In fact, I'm convinced that this movie was indeed just the biggest advertisement campaign I'd ever seen for the yet to be released Super Mario Brothers 3.  Which was *gasp* sneak peaked in this movie.  But little Timmy, or sorry, Wizard, played through that sunnuvabitch like he'd been playing it for years.  He knew every secret, and where to find the warp whistle.  Now let's say that this movie hadn't come out in 1989, and Fred Savage was saved from this fatal executioner-like blow to his career.  Let's pretend that this movie came out in 2004.  I'm betting dollars to donughts, that this kid would fall on his face like me at a roller rink.  I mean, could this "Wizard" of an 8 year old really handle himself against the likes of SOCOM NAVY SEALS II?  Or the upcoming METAL GEAR SOLID 3?  Or what about NFL STREET?  I can hardly play these games.  But you know what?  I bet ya' I can hand this 8 year old his ass on a platter!     "You think I don't have playstation?  I'm rich!"   Sure this is all a little presumptious, and pompous.  I mean after all this kid is 8.  I'm 24.  But let's not forget the lesson that was taught to the bigger and badder video game master of the movie.  The rival to the "Wizard".  Lucas.  He thought he was the cock of the walk.  And he proved it to.  He was the first to unleash upon our poor heroes Corey and Jimmy the Awsome Might, Zeusian Majesty, the Unholy Marriage of Technology and Fashion!   THE POWER GLOVE!   And he smacked down with a racing game demonstration of how this glove would be the future of gaming as we knew it.  And had Jimmy tucking his tail between his legs.  Until Jimmy opened a never ending bucket of Whup-Ass of Lucas in the Super Mario 3 competition.  This 8 year old knows his shit.  But I'm still confident that when I'm done with him after a round of Mortal Kombat Annihilation, he'll be gasping for air and needing several blood transfusions.  YOU LIKE DEM' APPLES BITCH!

      You're missing the point entirely.  First off all, Disney WILL continue to make live action films.  After all, Miramax, Touchstone, Hollywood Pictures, and Jerry Bruckheimer are all owned by the Walt Disney Corporation.  A movie from those companies is a Disney movie, no matter how you slice it.  Eisner still cuts the check.  Second, he did not announce the end of live-action production, just a moratorium on gigantic sized budgets.  This, I add, is a very prudent decision.  Disney still makes successful mid-level films, with this year's Miracle being a prime example.  Thirdly, Around the World in 80 Days is not a Disney flick.  It was an independently financed European film, which Disney distributed.  Get your facts right.  You spoke in length about the quality of all those old school, nickel and dime Disney flicks that Kurt Russell was so prominent in.  What you neglected to mention, was that those were TV movies, made for the Wonderful World of Disney Sunday night.  That was why they were so cheap to make.  None of them were feature films.  And while I agree with you that the company should get back to making smart, inexpensive films that cater more to story than to CGI, I do not agree that they should relegate themselves to making Movie of the Weeks.  Disney is gonna lose Pixar because Eisner doesn't like CGI animated movies.  He thinks he can be the savior for hand drawn animation.  His fault is not in the format, but in the story.  Pixar films are successful because they focus on story and character, and mold the medium around it, as opposed to the Mouse House that does the complete opposite.  This is a bad time for Disney.  Eisner has run them into the ground, spending money on poor movies with no heart.  It sad, too, because when the studio does luck on with a film, it's a phenomenon (Hello Pirates of the Caribbean).  For most of the 90's Disney was the highest grossing studio in Hollywood.  They took chances on small films, focused their money on concentrated blockbusters that were filled with big talent, and sat back to count their money.  I don't want them reverting to the early 70's.  Those small cheapie flicks were fun and well intentioned, but they couldn't fly today.  CGI is what sells; big is what sells.  Disney can do those things as good as anybody, but they need a creative team behind them.  Things could not be worse for Disney.  The Fahrenheit debacle was just the start of a mass exodus of talent and energy from the studio.  With Pixar talks stalled, and the Weinstein’s grumbling about leaving to go to 20th Century, Disney is in a tailspin that only a humongous movie can save.  Let's hope they have it in them, or you ain't getting your Kurt Russell movies, Truthbringer.  You’re getting nothing but sequels to The Princess Diaries and bad Eddie Murphy movies.  I'm not a religious man, but I think it may be time to get on my knees and pray for the safety of Walt Disney's beloved company.

      Recently it was announced by somehow-still CEO Michael Eisner, that Disney Studios will not be spending cement trucks full of money on live action movies anymore.  (Relax, the next two Pirate sequels are safe.)    This announcement might have some people all a flurry in panic!  I mean, without money where will movies like  Around The World In 80 Days  or remakes of  The Parent Trap , and  Freaky Friday  come from?  If it wasn't for her suddenly becoming the hottest thing since polio vaccinations, Lindsey Lohan might never have found work again!!  But don't get all worked up.  The way I see it, things couldn't be BETTER for Disney Studios.  This is the turning point they need to force themselves to make movies on their story and camp, then on their CGI.  I still haven't forgiven them for Haunted Mansion.  Case in point, does anyone remember  That Darn Cat ? (Original not the goddamn remake with Doug E. Doug.)  What about  The Cat From Outer-Space ?  Is there even  1  amongst you that remembers  C.H.O.M.P.S. ?  All these movies were made I think on a budget of no more than $20.00 each.  But the strongest argument I can make is the string of Dexter Riley movies starring Kurt Russel.  That's right, I said Kurt Russel.  Quite possibly one of the most over-looked trilogys in the world.   The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, Now You See Him Now You Don't,  and  The Strongest Man In The World.   But this was all back before Kurt Russel was Kurt Russel.  All of these (At the time) were considered successes.  And it looks to me that the budget on these weren't extravagant.  They could probably be made today by a team of students for as little as 500 bucks.  Don't count this as a loss having your budget cut Disney-bound directors.  Just be thankful you're not on the creative team for their terrible animated films.  Even their CGI ones.  Just leave that to PIXAR!!!
