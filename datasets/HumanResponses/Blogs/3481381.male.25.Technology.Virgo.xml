      ...I created this humble blog.  I did so because my dream job would be to profess my opinions to the world and have the world in turn shower me with money.  But since I don't expect to receive any checks in the mail to compensate me for my views on...whatever...anytime soon, I figure I'll keep my day job and see if anyone gives a damn about what I have to say anyway.  This will, in all likelihood, be a mainly socio-political blog (as if there weren't enough).  Especially since that's what I usually have the most opinions on, and I'm somewhat of a news junkie.  What are my credentials that would make my views on these topics worth reading, you ask?  Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm no Andrew Sullivan with a PhD in history(?), or a Josh Marshall (again, PhD/history) who seems to have source connection advantages in Washington no blogger should be allowed to have, and writes for every progressive news outlet in the country.  (Both blogs I follow regularly, I might add.)  No, I'm just a 25 year old IT professional with an unfulfilled punditry craving.  Hopefully someone will let me know if I wind up sounding like a complete gas bag.   I've never really been able to figure out which political persuasion I could be labeled with.  The religious right scares the hell out of me (no pun intended), but so too does the nanny-state faction of the left.  I've at times called myself a Republican without the Christian dominion element, ie fiscal conservative/social liberal.  But that was before I figured out that there is no Republican party without the religious zealot component.  And if there is, and I'm wrong, the limited government conservatives sure have been quiet these past few years.  OK, there are a few notables; John McCain, Barry Goldwater...  See?  I'm drawing blanks after that.  And even the likes of McCain are pariahs in their own party for not being quite neo-fascist enough on social policy to satisfy the scary people running the RNC.  I'm speaking, of course, only of the known politicians in the Republican party.  I would never presume to fail to acknowledge the many Republicans out there who are more in line with a moderate platform of political opinion.  That being said, I've also at times felt I was a Democrat.  However this didn't quite fit either.  It is true that I would feel perfectly comfortable at a DNC convention, even around the most zealous leftists. This in comparison to being at a RNC convention, where if it was discovered I'm gay, I would  urlLink be thrown out by security, and probably for my own protection.   So in that sense, one party's base is a lot more disconcerting than the other.  On one hand you have a party that, if allowed absolute power, would spend us into oblivion trying to help everyone and their nephew, tax everyone to the tune of 75%, and turn some previously private (and thus reasonably high quality) institutions into government run mediocre ogres.  On the other hand you have a party that would take that same power and transform the country into a Christian theocracy, with all of the community feeling of Montana.  At least those are the stereotypes.  The truth, as usual, is much more subtle.    And what do these labels mean anymore?  With both parties doing a reversal in political polarity like an electron-magnet on AC, how can the designation 'Republican' or 'Democrat' describe anything to a certainty anymore?  The Republican party has, starting in the Reagan years, become the party of borrow-and-spend and government intrusion into your local video store and your bedroom.  Meanwhile, the Democratic party has become the party of the balanced budget!  I honestly feel like I'm in some sort of political house of mirrors.  I grew up hearing about how the Democrats tax-and-spend and create fiscal messes like children in a candy store, and then a Republican sea change sweeps into Congress and cleans up the mess made by their incompetent and greedy predecessors.  Hmm...  This doesn't bear any resemblance to the party currently in control of Congress and the White House, does it?  Perhaps the pendulum will get back to its previous position someday.  I realize there are other parties out there; Libertarian, Green, etc.  I used to think I was a Libertarian (fiscal conservative, limited government, legalize most illegal drugs, socially liberal), but then I actually met a card-carrying member of the party.  He informed me the Libertarian party espouses such clever ideas as abolishing the State Department, FBI, CIA, ATF, INS, IRS, Department of Education, and virtually every other department of the federal government that is not involved in national defense.  So that was out.  In the end, I'm just another cliche Independent.  All that being said, if you, the readers, stick around, I promise my views won't scare you or give you the willies or chills (except my opinion on genetically engineered cats).  They may just, though, make you want to respond and my response to this is:  please do!   After all, preaching to the choir so as to never hear dissenting voices is something Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity do every day.  It doesn't make for a very enlightening debate, though.
