       On the agenda today is a variation on Being Unfairly Judged, and i like to call it:  Being Analyzed by Someone Who Thinks They Know How To Analyze Henna, today, has decided to analyze the fact that i asked her advice about my problem before, Being Unwanted. so she said im trying to subconciously get her to talk to Poire fore me and im like?no thats not it and anyways we got into a big fight where she continued to make judgements about me and anything ive ever done. yup.  My Response you dont know everything Henna ok? i Know youd like to think that, but oh well, you dont. you try and try to stay one step superior of everyone around you, but guess what? by doing that you sound stupid and patronizing. i  asked  your  advice.  on a problem i was having with a mutual friend. i didnt ask what my latest feeling was. you pass judgements on me based on little or no evidence. your all washed up hon and you know it.

       Hi everyone. This is my first journal on blogspot and guess what? its my complaining journal. this is where ill come to complain about all the stupid sucky things that happen. First off:       Being Unwanted.   Ok apparently on blog your supposed to change names? ok not really but im adhering to rules set up by someone else. Poire, a person i believed as a good friend of mine, and someone ive told a lot of stuff to, became extremely offended because i gained access to reading her nlog and she completely freaked out, and i just disovered this yesterday. Apparently, im not  CLOSE  enough. To read a journal. An online journal. where millions of people can access it. strangers. anyone. but me no, im not close enough? and a stranger is? yea ok then.      Being Unfairly Judged   Another friend problem. well. ex-friend problem. and the problem before was apparently not exactly a friend problem either. But see on another blog i had i listed a certain person as someone who had been there through the hard times, we'll call her jessica, and another friend, annie saw it, told this other friend who hates jessica, stephanie, and stephanie leaves me a mesage on my phone saying how i dont know who my real friends are how im a liar blah blah blah. whatever.  so now, stephanie, one of my best friends, hates me. over a stupid reason.       My Response:   to problem 1:in case you read this oh well. i feel like being a bitch. guess what. i told you stuff about me thats personal, and gee i had thought we were friends. in a survey, you said that you dont think im that smart, that im only semi-funy, you dont really think we're friends, and you dont wish we were closer. and then you say we arent close enough for me to read your journal. well guess what. im not that interested in your life anyways. hate to break it to ya sweetie, but your life isnt exactly time magazine material. first time i read it, henna gave me the link. i was bored and read it. causing you to freak out? because ill judge you? yea, cause i spent every waking moment thinking about what a freak you are. yea huh. cause i dont have my own life to deal with. suuure. dont fret though. im sure your writing talents will land you a great job someday. but dont forget to take your medication so you wont get hives from being so nervous about all the judgements people will make on your work.  cheers dahling.       problem 2: 3 simple words hon: get over it. stop the stupid high school drama crap and actually talk to me when you have a problem with me instead of believing all the stupid crap you hear.
