      ARH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Today is one of the worst day in my whole life! My results r poor! And go home kena scolded for unreasonable reasons!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I know i'm being very unfilial to tok bad bout my father but dis cant go on anymore for me! i hate him!!!!!!!!!!! i dun think anyone of u out dere would have a father who wouldn't allow u to bathe in hot water in the rainy season, have a handphone bill of $19 (which only exceeded subscription fee by $4) and doesn't wan to admit it when he's in the wrong!!!!!!!!! He juz blames it on others!!!!!!!! He even scolds my mother!!!!!!!!! I HATE HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you've got any father liddat, come and tell me coz i dun believe there's a father liddat in the whole world!!!!!!!!!!  Life is juz terrible!
