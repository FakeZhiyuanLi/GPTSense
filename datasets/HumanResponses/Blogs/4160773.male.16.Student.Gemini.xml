      hu... hu... hu... Ang sakit sakit... Bakit sa lahat pa ng makikita ko eh silang dalawa pa!!! Samantalang masaya pa kaming nagbibiruan nung mga nakaraang araw...  hu hu hu ka dian! Bakit pa kasi sa lahat ng pwedeng mahalin eh, ba't siya pa... Eh alam mo namang ganyan ang mangyayari...  Eh bakit hindi siya... Nasa kanya na ang lahat... Mabait siya... Maganda pa... Hindi pa boring kausap... Ang saya pang kasama...  uhum! uhum! uhum! Pano mo naman nalamang ganon siya, eh di ka nga niya pinapahalagahan... Eh sa tingin ko nga eh di ka niya papansinin pag nakita ka niya sa daan...  Wala akong pakialam... Masaya na ko tuwing napapatawa ko siya... Tuwing nagkakausap kami... Kahit silang dalawa ang pinag-uusapan namin... Tuwing natutulungan ko siya... Masaya na ko sa ganun...  Pero mas sasaya ka kapag naging kayong dalawa... Mas sasaya ka kapag tinutumbasan niya rin yung mga feelings na ibinibigay mo sa kanya Kaso, naunahan ka na ng iba... Mas may ibubuga pa kaysa sa'yo... Mayaman, gwapo, matangkad... Hindi gaya mo!  Wala na pala akong magagawa... Tama ka... Para siguro sila sa isa't isa... Langit sa langit, lupa sa lupa... Hanggang pag-aambisyon na lang pala ako... Pero hangga't hindi siya kinakasal, mananatili pa rin ang pagmamahal ko sa kanya... Hangga't hindi ko siya nakikitang masayang-masaya, mananatili pa rin akong humahanga at nagmamahal sa kanya...  Gago!!! Alam mo bang sinasabi mo!!! Patay na yung tatlong pari, nagpapakamartir ka pa rin!!! Kung ako sa'yo, humanap ka na ng iba... Baka may mas maswerteng babae dian na para talaga sa'yo...  Habang-buhay akong maniniwala na para kami sa isa't-isa... Peron hwag kang mag-alala... Susundin kita... Masyado na rin sigurong kawawa ang sarili ko... Ako dito, mangiyak-ngiyak sa sakit... Pero siya, masayang-masaya dun sa kaya... Kahit corny pakinggan... Mula ngayon, papatayin ko na tong puso ko na tanging siya lang ang tinitibok... Tatanggalin ko na yung mukhang naukit na sa isipan ko... Kakalimutan ko na kung pa'no nabihag ang napakatanga kong puso sa bitag ng isang napakagandang sumpa...  mmm...  Pero... Kasabay ng paglimot ko eh ang pagtatapos din ng isang buhay... Buhay ng isang lalaking nauwi sa pighati't kalungkutan... Isang lalaking matiyagang nagmamahal sa isang taong wala man lamang ka-ideideya sa mga pasakit ng pagmamahal na dinulot ng isang ambisyosong pangangarap... Dahil ang tanging paraan para hindi ko siya maisip eh ang habang-buhay na paglalakbay sa kabilang mundo...  mmm...  mmm...

         Did you know that when you envy someone, it's because you really like that person?      Did you know that those who appear to be very strong in heart are real weaklings and most susceptible?     Did you know that those who spend their time protecting others are the ones that really need some one to protect them?     Did you know that the three most difficult things to say are : I love you, Sorry and help me The people who say these are that actually need them or really feel them, and are the ones you really need to treasure, because they have said them.       Did you know that people who occupy themselves by keeping others company or helping others are the ones that actually need your company and help?     Did you know that those who dress in red have more confidence in themselves?     Did you know that those who dress in yellow are those that enjoy their beauty?     Did you know that those who dress in black are those who want to be unnoticed and need your help and understanding?     Did you know that when you help someone, the help is returned in two folds?     Did you know that those who need more of you are those that not mention it to you?       Did you know that it's easier to say what you feel in writing than saying it to someone in the face? But did you know that it has more value when you say it in the face?     Did you know that what is most difficult for you to say or do is much more valuable than anything that is valuable that you can buy with money?     Did you know that if you ask for something in faith, your wishes are granted?     Did you know that you can make your dreams come true, like falling in love, becoming rich, staying healthy, if you ask for it by faith, and if you really knew, you'd be surprised by what you could do.       But don't believe everything I tell you, until you try it for yourself , if you know someone that is in need of something that I mentioned of, and you know that you can help, youâ€™ll see that it will be returned in two folds.     DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON ME???... AT THE MOMENT, TIME AND PLACE THAT YOU NEED ME, CALL ME, I WILL BE THERE WITH YOU !!!!!

      when you love someone you thought you'll never get tired hiding the pain when you see her with another guy... you always hope for the proper time for you to say what's in your heart to the one who always breaks you're heart in pieces... but whenever you find the courage to say it, you always end up seeing them together... happy as always... you always hope that the words she share to him is yours... you always hope that when she laughs, she's thinking about  you... you always hope that she notices the ways of you helping her... and it feels like heaven, literally... as if you'll die any minute... but the thought that she's there makes you feel very strong... and the thought of her close to you makes you live longer, you have to protect her...  i'm in love... i know i'm in love... i will never stop loving her... eventhough it may mean my life... even if all the days she spend with me goes to talks of them together... even if she doesn't love me... or even if she'll never love me... i'll be living in the dreams of us together... i'll be living in the memories that we shared together... i'll be living my life with her... even  in my dreams ...

      Peter and Tina are sitting in the park doing nothing, but just gazing into the sky, hile all their friends are having fun with their beloved half.   Tina: I'm so bored. Just wish I have a boyfriend now to spend time with.   Peter: I guess we're the only leftovers. We're the only person who isn't with a date now. (both sigh in silence for a while)   Tina: I think I have a good idea. Lets play a game.   Peter: Eh? What game?   Tina: Eem... It's quite simple. You be my boyfriend for 100 days and I'll be your girlfriend for 100 days. what do you think?   Peter: Oookay... Anyway I don't have any plan for the next few months.   Tina: You sound like you aren't looking forward to it at all. Cheer up. Today will be our first day and our first date. Where should we go?   Peter: What about a movie? I heard that there is a really great movie in theater now.   Tina: Seems like I don't have any better idea than this. Lets move. (went to watch their movies and sent each other home)   Day 2:  Peter and Tina went to a concert together, and Peter bought Tina a keychain with a star.   Day 3:  They went shopping together for a friend's birthday present. Share an ice-cream together and hugged each other for the first time.   Day 7:  Peter drove Tina up onto a mountain and they watch the sunset together. When the night came and the moon glowed, they said sat on the grass gazing at the stars together. A meteor passed by. Tina mumbled something.   Day 25:  Spend time at a themepark and got onto rollercoasters, and ate hotdogs and cotton  candy. Peter and Tina got in the haunted house and Tina grabbed someone's hand instead of Peter's hand by accident. They laughed together for a while.   Day 67:  They drove pass a circus and decided to get in to watch the show. The midget asked Tina to play a part as his assistant in the magic show. Went around to see other ntertainments around after the show. Came to a fortune teller and she just said "Treasure every moment from now on" and a tear rolled down the fortune teller's cheek.   Day 84:  Tina suggested that they go to the beach. The beach wasn't so crowded that day. They have their first kiss with each other just as the sun is setting.   Day 99:  They decided to have a simple day and is deciding to have a walk around the city. They sat down onto a bench.   1:23 pm  Tina: I'm thirsty. Lets rest for a while first.   Peter: Wait here while I go buy some drinks. What would you like?   Tina: Eem... Apple juice will be just fine.   1:43 pm  Tina waiting for about 20 minutes and Peter havent return. Then someone walked up to her.   Stranger: Is your name Tina?   Tina: Yes, and may I help you?   Stranger: Just now down there on the street a drunk driver has crashed into a guy. I think its your friend.   Tina ran over to the spot with the stranger and sees Peter lying on the floor with blood over his face and her apple juice still in his hands. The ambulance came and she went to the hospital with Peter.   Tina sat outside the emergency room for five and a half hours. The doctor came out, and he sigh.   11:51 pm  Doctor: I'm sorry, but we did the best we could. He is still breathing now but God would take him away from us very soon. We found this letter inside his pocket.   The doctor hands over the letter to Tina and she goes into the room to see Peter. He look weak but peaceful. Tina read the letter and then she burst into tears. Here is what the letter said:   "Tina, our 100 days is almost over. I had fun with you during all these days. Although you may be greedy sometimes and less thoughtful, but these all brought happiness into my life. I have realize that you are a really cute girl and blamed myself for never taken the time to knowing that. I have nothing much to ask for, but I just wish that we can extend the day. I want to be your boyfriend forever and wish that you can be beside me all the time. Tina, I love you."   11:58  Tina: (sobbing) Peter. Did you know what was the wish I made on the night there was a meteor. I asked God to let us last forever. We were suppose to last 100 days so Peter! You can't leave me! I LOVE YOU, but can you come back to me now? I love you Peter. I LOVE YOU.   As the clock struck twelve, Peter's heart stopped beating. It was 100 days.    So... Tell the guy or girl that you love them before its too late. You never know whats going to happen tomorrow. You never know who will be leaving you and never return...
