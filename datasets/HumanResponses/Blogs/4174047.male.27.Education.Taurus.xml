      Here is a bit of a tip for you to avoid what could be a really shitty situation. This only applies to males. When you to come Korea, be sure that your Hojok(family registration) doesn't have your Korean name registered on it. When you go to apply for your  urlLink F-4 Visa  you will need to have this document to prove that your parents were a former Korean National. The reason why you need to have your Korean name erased, is to avoid the situation that I experienced. I applied for my F-4 Visa with the notion that it would be a breeze, as it is for many gyopos. Only problem, even though I was born in Canada, I was given a Korean name from my grandparents and this name was registered on the Family Hojok.  After applying for the visa, my father's friend who I was staying with,  was told that I had to erase the name or face possible military service.  This had me worried, as I did not want to serve, but I also didn't want to leave Korea as I basically just got here.  As well, I was required to clear the name due to the fact that if I left the country, I could perhaps never be able to re-enter (pop singer:  urlLink Yoo Seung Joon , although his situation is different) I 'm not the only one who has had this problem. I know of a few who had the same experience and have heard of some who had to go serve their time. Of course, their situation is different as they had actual Korean citizenship, but had been living abroad for most their lives.  My good friend's older brother, who was born in Canada, and had been in Korea for 7 years, experienced this on his last Visa renewal, he was only able to avoid the miltitary time after he hired a lawyer and was able to erase his name off the Hojok. This is what also happened to me, although I was lucky enough to not have to use a lawyer, I still had to get a judges approval to have my name erased. Also, the fact that I was a Canadian born citizen made a world of difference. This whole process took about 3 months, in which I was unable to earn any money and a basically play the waiting game.  Every situation is different, but my advise to you is to get your documents in order, ask your parents if they or your grandparents have registered you on the Hojok and then take the steps in getting that name erased, especially if you are a 20 something male.

      Just wanna send a quick thanks to Shawn at  urlLink Korealife blog  for hooking me up on his blog site, it has certainly brought in some traffic...Hopefully I can keep it interesting enough for you to check it out more often.  I just have to get used to this whole HTML thing.  Contrary to popular belief not all Asians are good at this kind of stuff, me being one of them.

       urlLink     A few more pics of the pad...My place is situated in a place called an OfficeTel. Which basically mean there are some rooms occupied by businesses and some used for living, the latter being the majority. A place like this will vary in price, Seoul being more expensive, but you may get lucky. In Kyunggi province where I live it is still pretty expensive. For those who are thinking of moving to Korea, unless you get housing from your school, which in my opinion is good and bad. I chose to get my own place last year, more out of necessity. As a Gyopo in Korea, we are given or should I say not given the same treatment as a caucasian foreigner. For the most part we do not recieve free housing, and other benefits such as paid return airfare to and from your home country. Now, this doesn't occur %100 of the time but it is definetly true that us Gyopos do not get the same treatment as others. The one advantage we do have is our VISA. We are able to apply for an   urlLink  F-4 visa or Gyopo Visa   . This Visa is a great thing to have as it allows us to teach private lessons legally. The length of sojourn is for 2 years rather than 1, and we are not required to leave the country to renew. Back to housing, it is required for a person to put down Gae Hak Geum (a deposit), usually between   urlLink  5million or 10 million won    (returned to you at the end of your lease). If you can afford more then do so, 'cause the higher the deposit the lower the Wol Sae (monthly rent). If you can afford a really big deposit like, 60million won which is the about the value of a place like mine, then you go into Chun Sae (which means putting the whole value down and the not paying any monthly rent) the owner recieves interest off these big deposits and then returns the money at the end of the lease. I hope this info helps...

This is especially true after a shitty day at work where it seems every brat is pissing you off...I had one of those days today, makes me want to go back to teaching adults, excpet for the split shifts that are required, which makes your day start at 6am, no thanks.

       urlLink    This is a dedication to the near glorious run the  urlLink Calgary Flames  made this year in the Stanley Cup Finals. I waited 15 years for this and I was stuck here in Korea, but at least all the games were on AFKN. (the american forces tv station) It is a well known fact to everyone who knows me that I bleed Calgary Flames red. Thanks to my best bro' Dave for sending me the Flames package. In case you don't know that display of trophies is from Mcdonald's, I picked those gems up in Feb. when I visited Calgary for the Super Summit pond hockey tourney. Guns a blazin...Calgary Flames hockey.

       urlLink    I am in Dongdameun, (One of the busiest areas in Seoul, crazy shopping deals) here, although this is a recent picture (due to me not having a digital camera before) It shows you one of the first amazing places that I saw in Korea...  I arrived in Korea on Sept/28/2002 and was picked up at Incheon Internation airport by my dad's friends. I was to stay at Mr.Kim's house for my first little while and they would get me familar with all the new things that I was to expect. My dad's buddies are wealthy business men so as soon as we got home and I was able to get cleaned up, we were off to the nearest Kalbi (Korean BBQ beef) house for dinner and drinks. There I had my first taste of  urlLink SOJU , Korea's version of VODKA, which is consumed by the gallons by Koreans.  My first Korean drinking experience was a learining one, I learned how to pour booze to seniors..which is using two hands, one on the bottle and one holding your arm.  Later that week, I was able to meet a Korean guy through a contact of my sister's company in Calgary. He showed me around and took me out to Hongdae, which means Hongik University. This area is jumping full of clubs. This is were I met Jung-Min, we began to date a few days later and have been with eachother since...She is a lovely girl and you will get to know her more thru my blog.  Let's again fast forward, this time to my second month here. I was working at my dad's friends company doing this and that, but knew eventually I would have to break away and look for some full-time work...of course as an English teacher. I thought this would be a breeze, getting a Visa and then a job, with all the benefits like housing. This did not happen, I had huge troubles getting my Visa due to the fact I had a registered Korean name (Ka Young---it's actually a chick's name) and being 25 years old I was a prime candidate for mandatory military service...NO THANKS!! After about two months of dealing with Government officals I was able to have my name released and was granted my VISA. (Thanks to my GF, her dad, my dad, my aunt)  By this time, I was living with my GOMO (aunt-dad's sister) and looking for my first job. I had troubles finding one due to the fact that I was a Gyopo..I will explain this and a bunch of other things that a Gyopo goes through in Korea. I finally found a job which was in Seoul, only problem my Gomo lived in Shiheung, a two hour commute both ways. The school promised me housing after 2 months, but this didn't happen. I was forced to look elsewhere, and this is how I ended up in Bundang, first teaching adults then back to my old school and now at a new school in Gangnam(area in the south area of Seoul) I have lived in 2 different places now and am quite comfortable in Korea... and as far as me Korean, it has improved ten-folds, I can thank my non-English speaking gomo and my Girlfriend for this, I have learned a lot about the culture of Korea, some I love and some things that bother me a bit. Through my postings I hope you will get a better idea of how it is to live in Korea as a Gyopo, and maybe inspire you to come live here yourself.  Be back soon...later

      Hello, My name is Michael and I am a 27 year old Korean-Canadian male living, working, and learning in Bundang(suburb of Seoul) South Korea. Let me tell you a bit about me and my days in Korea, thus far.I was born in Calgary, Alberta,Canada to my awesome and lovely parents, Byungki and Heaza. My parents immigrated to Canada in 1967, my dad being the second Korean immigrant to the then small city of Calgary.Along with my older sisters, Suzanne and Elisa, our family had a great upbringing, with some good times and of course some not so good times. We grew up in a some what traditional Korean household, minus the hardcore strictness that occurs in many Korean households. The one thing that was missing from my life was the ability to speak Korean. At an early age the Choi kids studied at Korean school every Friday nights. This went on for a couple of years, up until I discovered Hockey. I had to make a decision, hockey or Korean...I chose hockey, and have been playing since. Growing up I didn't show much concern for this, except for the times at family and Korean functions, such as church or any of the parties that the KBA(Korean business association) were holding. Most of the time I had no clue what was coming out of people's mouthes, with exception to a few words here and there..basically my response to everything was, "NAE" which is yes. You may be wondering, Why couldn't you speak Korean while living with Korean parents? Like many Gyopos can attest to, even though you grow up in a Korean house, it doesn't mean you can speak it. My parents tried to teach us, but we didn't really grasp it all that much. I grew up hanging out with my Canadian friends, non of which were of Korean decent, played hockey, snowboarded, partied...etc with white friends.  Fast forward to year 25 of my life, and I'm finished school and working a good job as a Seismic Data Broker in the Oil and gas industry when one day I was sitting in my office and thought to myself, "I have never been to Korea, and I can't speak a lick of the language, and other than the food and few other things, I don't know a whole lot about the culture." So, I made the decision to come here for one or two years and give it a go...with the full support of my parents i was off to the motherland. So, I said my see you laters to my family, my Boyz back home...Mitchell, Dugas, Mckenzie, Greener, Burns, Blackwell, JM, and many more, and took off for Korea.  Next up... The first time in Korea.

      Hello,  Welcome to my blog. My name is Michael Choi and I decided to make this blog to keep track of my time here in Korea.  I am a 27 year old Korean-Canadian male from Calgary, Alberta,Canada.  I came to Korea in the fall of 2002, and unfortunatley I didn't own a digital camera untill now.  My blog will include stories of my stay thus far and stories to come.  As well as stuff on Hockey, Snowboarding, Poker, Teaching English, etc...  I hope you enjoy what is to come from GYOPOLIFE..and in case you don't know what a GYOPO is, it means overseas Korean, born or immigrated to a foreign country.  Take'r easy...

       urlLink    I played hockey last night for the first time in 3.5 months, and surprisingly, I felt pretty good. Korean hockey is a much different than Canadian hockey...Most of the players are pretty decent skaters and they got skills but they lack the toughness that is common in a Canadian player. They also love to Cherry Pick (stand at the other teams blue line waiting for the puck to be passed for a possible breakaway) because Korean rules follow International rules, that exclude the red line. The cherry pickin' happens often, and it's pretty annoying but, oh well. There isn't many options for me to play hockey in Korea, so I'm thankful for being able to play. I got a new pair of hockey gloves, my last one's were completey done, so a buddy of mine here, brought these beauties back when he went to Canada for a few weeks.

       urlLink    Not much going on these days, as the weather is terrible and the summer camp at my hagwon is FINALLY winding down...back to my regular schedule. So I decided to post another one of my dishes. Today, it's a Tofu (두부 -dubu) with sauce and hot peppers (고추-go-chu)....this is actually a common side dish that I buy from the 반찬 (bun-chun--Korean side dish) store.  Just fry up some Tofu till brown then pour sauce on top  Sauce: Soy Sauce, Sesame Oil, Vinegar, Gochu-Gadu (Hot chili pepper) and chop up some fresh hot peppers.  That's it, that's all...

       urlLink    Looks kinda like barf, but it tastes O.K...In my recent attempt to lose the pounds or kg's I should say, I have been trying to cut down my carbs, mainly white sticky rice (almost immposible, seeing as I grew up on the stuff) and have been eating breakfasts like this one in the picture. 6 egg whites and one chopped chicken breast omlette. I sprinkle a little pepper, some tobasco sauce, and ketchup and that's it. Couple of Jamison Vitamins, (which I'm running out of, I have to remind my sister to bring me some when she moves here), and I am set for a couple of hours. I've been going to the gym quite a bit lately, partly cause I haven't been playing hockey. Personally, I have never been the biggest fan of the gym, to me I would way rather play a sport than sit on a cycle or run on a treadmill like a hamster. Although, I somewhat enjoy lifting weights. Except in Korea, they play the worst possible music you could play while working out. I mean I love K-pop as much as the next person (NOT) but to play it as well as slow songs, is annoying and can be hazardous to your safety at the gym, as it could possibly put you to sleep, which is no good, especially while your benching 400 pounds, as I do..(another lie).  Oh yeah, Jung-Min and I went to a 찜질방Gim Gil Bang (Dry Sauna). The one we went to was really nice. It's right near my house and brand new. We roasted our asses for a while then Jung Min and I had some dinner there 낙지복음밥 (Nak Gi Bok Eum-spicy octopus stir fry thingy in rice) then I went to the steam sauna, showered and scrubbed up (this all for about 10,000won) and came home to write 3 tests for tommorow's class...Till tommorow tak'er easy. L8ter...

      Of course this is translated to English, but this is a version of what I and perhaps other Gyopos may go through when communicating with a stranger in Korea.  Scenario: In the store  Me: "Could, I please get two kilograms of Kalbi Sal?"  Korean(shopkeeper) "Pardon me?"  Me: "Could, I please get two kilograms of Kalbi Sal?"  Korean: "Ah yes, of course."  While the shopkeeper is getting the meat, he/she says...  Korean: "Are you Chinese?"  Me: "No, I'm from Canada."  Korean: "But you look Korean?"  Me: "Yes, I'm a gyopo from Canada."  Korean: "Ah, yes...that's great, what are you doing in Korea?"  Me: "Studying Korean and Teaching English."  Korean: "That's great...well enjoy your time in Korea."  Me: " Thanks, Goodbye."   These situations happen because my Korean, although quite decent, does sound different from Koreans. It will always be difficult to have perfect pronunciation. Just as native speakers of English can differentiate a native to a person speaking English as a second language. So, can Koreans...my point is that there is always two sides to a situation. For all you English teachers out there that complain and get frustrated when your students aren't grasping your lessons, try to think of how you feel when your speaking Korean...especially for Gyopos. People can be kind and interested in what you have to say, and in turn you can tell your story while practicing your Korean.
