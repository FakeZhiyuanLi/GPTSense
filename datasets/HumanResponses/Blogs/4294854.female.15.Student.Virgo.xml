        Well, the saying is true: You can't live with them, you can't live without them. Guys are confusing 90% of the time. I know this is true from experience with them. Talk about mixed signals. One day a guy will act like he likes you but then the next day he barely talks to you...whats that about huh? I mean come on if you like a girl just ask her out what can it hurt. So she says no at least you got the courage to do it. Its so frustrating. Ive had so many guys like me (and i like them back) but never come and tell me then when its too late come and tell me they like(d) me. And why is it (no offense) but all these rude/slutty/ugly/mean people get boyfriends and nice friendly funny pretty people dont get boyfriends. It makes me soo upset. Well i cant rant n e more. Bye

        Today I had my first experience of driving in the pouring down rain. Pouring so bad I literally could not see where i was going. I was sooo scared! But yes! It was bad! My birthday is in a few days and i cant wait! Tomorrow is school! Ugh. Last night Courtney and I were talking and we figured out we are like soul mates (not in that way). We have so much in common like serisouly i really cant go into detail about what we talked about but it was serisouly scary. It was crazy! Church today  was awesome! We had this really good sermon! It was wonderful! I just had a really great day except i was soo scared to drive in the rain but other than that i had a pretty awesome day! Well thats all for the moment! Save the Ant Eaters!

        Today is Saturday August 21, 2004. My schedule for today is to do some cleaning( not by choice) then take a shower. After im finished getting ready go to the mall to get some clothes because i only have 2 pairs of jeans and jeans are pretty much what i wear. Also to get a shirt or two and maybe a purse. Also show my mom the winter jacket I want and the shoes i want. I mean come on i have to get on the ball my birthday is in 10 days and plus i didnt get any new school clothes when school started so i might as get them now ya know? Well after the mall i'll come home and hopefully make contact with my friend Courtney who is supposed to be spending the night tonight and then going to church with me tomorrow. I'll probably watch some movies i got from Block Buster aka Block Blister...sorry inside joke...you know how those are. Well thats pretty much what ill do today. I might go to the marble slab but im not sure its pretty expensive. Oh by the way last night at Sertoma my school lost 14-0. What a way to start off the football season right? Well i gotta go finish cleaning and stuff. Much Love. Save the Whales!

        1) If you were a hot dog and you were starving would you eat yourself?          2) If the moon was made out of ribs, would you eat it?

        Ok, Well its friday night and im a social 16 year old girl and im sitting at home doing nothing. This may sound unusal to you for a girl my age to sit at home and do nothing so let my tell you why i am here and not out having fun. Well once a year the school district has this thing called Sertoma, which is where alll the high schools in the district play(football) a 15 min. quarter against another school. There is also like a spirit award and that goes to the school with the most spirit and the most people. Its sorta the kickoff for the football season and well Charleston district has been doing this for like the past 25 years at the same stadium well this year the stadium they usually do it at got torn down and is being rebuilt so they are having it at the biggest school in the county... well so thats the 1st reason why im not going cuz it wouldnt be the same. 2nd reason is becuase all my friends have to work tonight and so im not going by myself. So thats why im stuck at home sitting at my computer typing this. So there ya go. Enjoy!
