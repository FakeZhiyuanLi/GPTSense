      Hey, its been a long weekend for me. First of all I had to go to the last orientation meeting for the Australia and New Zealand trip. It was pretty nice. They served food and I became closer friends with a student over there plus two others. I ate a slice of pizza and some cookies. I wasn't really hungry, after all, I had eaten a breakfast meal in Mcdonalds before arriving to the meeting.  After the meeting, I came home and turned on the computer and listened to some music, but I didn't last very long, since I had to go to sleep right after.  Now today I was enjoying life. You know that friend that came back? Well he started helping with the remodeling of the house. However, the best thing he requested from me was that turned up the music. I gladly obeyed. Turned onto some Jimi Hendrix - Are you Experienced album. Damn! I never imagined how he played wonderful rock n' roll. I then turned onto Led Zepplein IV album, then to the Beatles - Revolver album, The Clash - London Calling album, and finally to the newest band: Velvet Revolver - Contraband album. Good music I say.   Then my friend wrote a poem to my aunt about how he loves her. It was pretty sweet. He says he got inspired by the Beatles, laugh out loud!   Finally in the evening, I went to ernesto-guevara.com/forum to start posting some stuff. I posted my artwork there and the people there seem to like it. Good people there.  Oh well goodnight. :)

       First of all I want to talk about my plans for the summer. You all probably don't know, but I'm going to Australia and New Zealand on July 4th with this Student ambassador program. And tomorrow is my last orientation meeting before I fly off to the countries. I'm really excited in going, because I never been to Australia and New Zealand and I could just imagine all the fun I'm going to have when I stay there.  Now today, I got this guy keep instant messenging me over some stupid shit I've done or something. I was like.... WTF?? :|  Seriously I get irritated when stupid dumbfucks keep instant messenging me out of nowhere. Especially this Kulix guy. He accuses me of setting up another account on www.soccergaming.tv and talking shit about him. Well he is a fucken dumbass, because I didn't set up no account.  Hey Kulixs if you see this....  FUCK YOU :D

       Hey, Well I'am glad I get to update my blog :P. Well, last weekend I helped my cousins in painting the house. It was pretty fun, but pretty irritating. Especially the music my cousins put on the radio. It was a perpetual irritation. I thought I was going to throw up. Anyways I spent the other hours helping one of my cousins with the plumbing of the house. See, me and my parents are remodeling the house. On my part though I really didn't want to remodel it, since in eight to ten years the city council will tear it up to build a new parking space for the arena I live next to. But anyways, I'm glad we're almost done with the remodeling.    The next few days, I got some marxist and anarchist works from the library. I'm an extreme-leftist. And a Chilean friend that I met a few months ago changed my life. His family was killed by Pinochet. And I find it pretty intriguing that he started getting into politics at the age of six. For all I know, at age six I didn't even know what the word "politics" meant nor what the U.S foreign policy was about. So I'm really grateful that this person came into my life, and opened my eyes to reality.    For that reason, I borrowed,  God and the State  by Michael Bakunin. According to the biography of this man, he was a well active anarchist. At the age of twenty-six he went out and fighted for justice. Although anarchism is my stance, I still found it interesting in how he proclaims the belief in God as ludicrous and iniquitous. Merely saying, God does not exist. According to the author, the primitive people of early human history were the creators of this myth in God. And ever since, it was used by the government to keep the majority of the people ignorant. A very interesting standpoint I say. Although, Michael Bakunin never finished this work, he did cover the French Revolution and since then the belief in God, was essentially a form of eclecticism. Deism essentially has been the excuse since then.   Personally, I find it pretty interesting in how he takes the belief in God. Recently, I was having a discussion with my uncle. My uncle is one of those "Jehovah's Witnesses," but what I find it absurd is that he keeps referring back to the Bible whenever his arguement fails. And he also takes it to extreme heights in which he shows the plants and flowers and how there must be a creator .. blah blah..   I believe that a human is a slave to the government. And God is essentially a tool to manipulate the people, especially the ignorant. My uncle for example, recently got into religion, and hes far worse than me in terms of family relatioship. He has his sons rebelling against him and such. So, I don't put much interest in what he has to say, because I hate authority. And I don't need someone to tell me what to believe in. I don't need a book to tell me what my morals suppose to be. I just want to be myself and I want to help others.   Anyways, VIVA LA REVOLUCION!!
