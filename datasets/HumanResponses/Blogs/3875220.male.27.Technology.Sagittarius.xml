      How about that? It's been over 2 weeks since my last post and...*gasp*...there's no comments on my blog thingey. Imagine my astonishment...go ahead...imagine it...I dare you. Yeah, you're right, there's not much to imagine. Told you I didn't expect anyone to read this. So onto today's dribble (I like that word for some reason)  After much aggravation, some wheeling and dealing, and a shit load of patience and tolerance, I'm home. Well, home enough to make it official. I'm finally in the purty land of Austin. Right now I'm staying with friends who I used to live with back when I lived here, just over 3 years ago. In that time, they've managed to buy a house, get another dog (long story with the first one), another cat, and a kid. Now, if you know anything about my friend, you'd be shocked and amazed that he would be married...let alone have a kid. But here he is, doing his part to add to the immensely growing number of soccer-moms (or dads in this case) in this world. But don't get me wrong. I'm not doggin' him for it. It's his life and he's free to live it how he pleases. But it just makes me realize that I am sooooo not ready for that yet. Mind you, I don't live (or have ever live) the "typical" single guy life. I've never had the joy of trying to remember who it is that's lying next to me on any given morning. And other various "single guy" things. But as I said, I realize now that I'm not ready for the mamma and pappa bear lifestyle. That is to say, if I'd ever be ready for it again (yet an even longer story).  So here I sit, in their house, while they're asleep at 10pm on a Friday night. And since I don't feel right going out and partying or drinking or hanging out a bar/club while I'm living with them, I sit here...wide awake...and itchin' to do something. And plus, I don't have a key for the front door so I kinda have a curfew in a round about sense. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be too appreciative of me, banging on their door at 2am wanting back in the house. As I said, they already have another dog.  But hopefully, I'll be outta their hair here (small tongue twister for 'ya) fairly soon. I'm scheduled for a third interview for what sounds like a great job next week and basically it comes down to the team I'd be working with liking me more than anyone else they've interviewed. Should hear something back on that fairly soon. Then I can get my own place, get my new car, and start pushing through life once again. And this time, I'll be taking this town down on my terms. That's the nice thing about being single. If I don't feel like grocery shopping cause I'm outta food, I can always run down to some random food place and grab a bite to eat. Or a million other things that I feel like/not feel like doing and don't have to check with anyone else to see if it's cool or whatnot. But like everything, being single has it's drawbacks. Just the way life is.  So I'll close with this. How do they cram all that graham? Small shout out to someone from my past that I still think about from time to time...even though I know I probably shouldn't. *sigh* Ok, enough reminiscing.  Onward to Valhalla!!!!!

      Ok, the title is mis-leading. There's nothing fun going on, but I thought I'd jot down a few things to help pass the time.  One of the things I've noticed is that work is getting more and more unbareable. I got about a week and a half left at this point. As such, I've noticed that more and more work has not come my way. Now granted, this isn't necesarrily a bad thing. Slacking off is a skilled artform and it's good to get lots of practice if one intends to master the ways. But damnit if it isn't boring as hell most times. The short-timer in me doesn't want to do what little work I have to do right now and management doesn't want to give me anything that'll take more than a day or so to get done. So I'm stuck cruising websites I've been to a dozen times in the past hour and leaking my thoughts onto this weblog thing. It's almost gotten to the point that I hope something happens at work that'll make the time fly by faster, but it never works out that way, does it? It's like hoping there's a cop nearby to see the idiot cutting you off doing 90 mph in a residential area but can only seem to catch one eyeing you as you go 1 mph over the speed limit and on go the lights and up goes your insurance rates. I got a feeling god was a stand-up comic in another life and is playing out all his/her/it's jokes now and is (literally) rofl'ing all the time at our expense.  Oh yeah, before I forget. I didn't have to go to NY for work so that's a good thing. And all the rain stopped after everyone started complaining that "It's raining too much". Only bad part is that I got stuck covering the shift for the person who did go to NY (late shift). Not a bad trade off. Would rather get home late than fight traffic getting to the train station, people on the train, people at Penn Station in NY, people on the streets of NY, techs who resent me in our buildings in NY, users who want everything fixed "NOW!!!", and then doing it all in reverse at the end of the day.  Subnote #5539 - Just got an email from the CIO about some people in my department who have "officially" been promoted. And from what I'm told by my direct supervisor, the positions they got promoted to were magically created for them since they didn't exist before the announcement was made. Now. The thing that's funny about this is related to the promise they made me to promote me after relocating here last year. 'member how I said they shafted me on that? Well, the big reason why they said "We're not able to promote you at this time." was that there was no actual position where I wanted to be moved to. But somehow or another, they apparently found 3-4 new positions just lying around for these people to move into. Maybe I should open up my own shop so I can promote myself whenever I feel like it.

      Here I sit, staring out the window, and the buckets and buckets of falling rain. Don't get me wrong though. I like the rain. Usually puts me in a "mood" which is always fun. But I gots to go shopping after work and that's never fun in the rain. Especially when you don't  want  to get wet. Suppose I'll live.  My boss has been eyeing me all day long. Think he's gonna send me to New York later this week for work. Think he's just being mean to me since I'm on my final 2 weeks here. I can remember talking to people back in TX who were like "Wow! You're going to NY for work! Lucky guy!" and all that jazz. And admittedly, I had the whole wow-factor going my first trip. But by the time I was on the train back home later that day, I had a different perspective. And add to that that it'll probably still be raining buckets and buckets when I would be going definetly does not make it a funner trip. Guess maybe I should stop complaining and buy a damn umbrella finally, huh?  Now this is where you all say "Ohhhh, poor baby." or you start throwing shit at me and tell me to stop being a whiny bitch.  /me takes cover

      So, as I said before, I'm leaving my current job. In doing so, one of the steps one must take is to of course, find another job to "look busy" at. I've been doing this for about a month now, and today wondered if they finally posted a job opening for the job I'm leaving.  After a bit of poking around, I finally found the job posting on my company's website. So, me being me, I get this idea in my head to apply for it. Figure I'd get a small chuckle out of it at the very least. Would be funny to have someone from HR call me up and ask me if I would consider coming in for an interview and then start going off on her. Childish? Yes. But I can be like that sometimes.  Not much else going on though, but it's still early. Was supposed to go to this bar last night with friends from work, but didn't. The place is a meat market at it's worst. Everyone is gauging everyone else, running in their minds what the beer rating for everyone is. Or how many beers it would take to get them drunk enough to take advantage of easily. And people say  I'm  an evil fuck. What is this world coming to?

      Ok, the last post was just a test. And how about that? This stuff does work. Big show of faith in technology huh? Kinda surprising since I  work  in the technology field.  But anyways, without further adieu, onto the good stuff. Now I just need to figure out what the good stuff is.  So there I was, sitting at my desk at work (big man with my own desk...I feel so powerful) trying to look busy enough so that any wandering management types don't come down on me as to why I'm not doing anything. But in all honesty, they don't scare me and they wouldn't have any say in my productivity levels at this point in the game. The truth is that the beginning affects of short-timer's disease are starting to settle in. Let me explain, and briefly if I can (I have a tendency to write novels at times)...  Just over a year ago, my company made it known that they were relocating my department from Texas to Pennsylvania (head office). As such, they were laying off everyone in my department. I, myself, saw this coming a few months beforehand so my shock value had depleted considerably by that point. Well, low and behold, the CIO who was visiting from headquarters (love how that sounds so military to match the regime power trip of upper management) to announce the news calls me into his make-shift office. After a few minutes of kissing my ass, he tells me that he's ready to offer me a position and the company will pay for relocation costs and the like. Sweat deal and the cash bonuses (note the plural) he threw at me wet my appetite for my piece of the American capitalist dream to own lots of useless stuff with lots of features not available on any other model (until next week's version arrives) and complain that there's nothing on TV...ever. Also in the mix, he said in one voice or another that I would be quickly promoted. So. A few signed documents later, I found myself in the historic tri-state area. Within a month I realized that historic just means old and the tri-state part was just not my cup of tea. Add to this that whatever voice the CIO used when he pitched the promotion at me was obviously  not  the one who actually made the decisions.  So then I found myself a laughable victim of Corporate America and living in a part of the country that agreed with me less than the $2 taco plate from the shack down the street recently listed as an environmental hazard by the EPA. Soon after realizing that my career was going nowhere fast, I went off on the CIO. Since then, he doesn't make eye contact with me so it's not a big loss. And because of the relocation deal they threw at me, I had to stay with the company for a year after I got here or else pay back the bonuses (note the plural again) that I got for making the move. Oh woe is me. Don't worry, you can laugh. I don't mind. I've had many a chuckle over this myself.  Good news though, yes there's good news in the pit of this hell, is that I have just a hair and half over 2 weeks left before my year is up. July 21st to be exact. And I've been counting down the days...and hours...and minutes...and seconds since January or so. Just ask my family and friends and they'll grumble disgustedly about knowing  exactly  how much time I have left...down to the second. I'm such a neurotic basketcase at times.  So there you are. You've been caught up, more or less, with the last year. Don't you feel so...uhmm..so...something...to know this now? Maybe I'll keep posting here. Maybe I won't. Guess only time will tell.  Peace out and stuff...

      Heya, look at me, I'm like back and stuff. Big woop, I know. You can take your seats now...  Not sure why I'm posting today. Not much has changed. Still looking for a job so I can get on with my life. Last interview I had fell through after managing to get the third and final interview. Oh well, no biggie though. I figure it wasn't a good sign that after 3 interviews I  still  had no idea what the job entailed...exactly. I know it had to deal with working with a small team...something or another with computers...and there might be overtime involved. But the rest was a mystery to me...really it was. Sad really since I said that "The job sounds very interesting and something I could see myself enjoying" or something like that in two separate interviews. Ahhh, the price we must pay to actualize our view of the American dream. But at least I didn't lie on my resume....no...really...I didn't....look it up....embellishing is  not  lying...technically.  My friends that I'm staying with are out of town so I have the whole house to myself. And after a few hours of running around the house naked, I've learned that cats actually can scream in terror. So rather than traumatize them further, the clothes are back on. Just can't seem to catch a break anywhere nowadays. But all is not lost. I can watch whatever on TV that I feel like watching instead of fighting the little one for the remote so he can watch the fifth episode of Dora for the day. For those of you who don't know who Dora is, consider yourself lucky. Now, don't get me wrong. I have nothing against most kid shows in general. I've been known to enjoy them from my toddler days into my mid-twenties ('dem teletubbie folks were just sooooo demented that I couldn't turn away). But after watching them for 3-4 straight hours day in and day out, the shit starts to get to you. Even with my vast movie collection, I find myself looking at them all (and there's a lot of them to look at) and saying "I don't feel like watching  any  of this crap."  Guess I'll leave on that note. Seems like I'm just complaining at this point. Maybe I'll find a job right up my alley tomorrow. Something like "Fortune 500 company seeking a senior level slacker. Must have experience in avoiding work like the plague and able to disseminate any work attained to underlings who have no idea what they are doing." Yeah. That would be sweet. But my last 2 jobs were like that so I think my luck is running out.
