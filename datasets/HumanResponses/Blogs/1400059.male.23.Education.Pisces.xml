His phone number is 415.425.9466 and it is craaaaazzyyyyy.  &nbsp;

      Monday night, Nick and I got all whacked out on  urlLink neurontin .&nbsp;   Here is what happens to&nbsp; people who get all whacked out on neurontin: 1) They lose ALL SOCIAL ANXIETY!!! 2) They are able to sing.&nbsp; IN FRONT OF PEOPLE! 3) The poops 4) The inability to operate heavy machinery  Shit got CRAZY!  Here is what happened when we got all whacked out on neurontin: 1) Laughter 2) We could not SHUT UP! 3) Kat got one big eye and one little eye. 4) Nick tongue-kissed Brent because HE WANTED TO! 5) We did not get the poops 6) By the end of the night, we felt like no one wanted us around, but only for like 2 minutes because EVERYONE WANTS US AROUND! 7) We woke up a little poundy  That is all.

      I read the first few pages of Gabe Melero's book yesterday.  It was surprisingly good.  In other news, I don't hate Gabe Melero nearly as much anymore.  Although, I still wish he'd stop wearing that hat.

      I realized on the bus today, before seeing Kat's searing retort, that I was trying to turn this medium for free-form expression into an oppressive woman-hating polemic.  MY BAD! But I don't think that Swingers thing is about hating women.  It's just about people assuming power that they don't have.  You know, like Ghandi.

      Nick is respectful of women in theory, not in practice, which is why I want to take a&nbsp;dump all over his face whenever he talks about how he's oppressed as a man.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fucking shit!&nbsp; Don't even get me started, I'll fucking male gaze your fucking asshole.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, Nick, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way... In twenty years, if you're still livin' here, comin' over to my house to watch teen movies, still workin' on this screenplay, I'll fuckin' kill you. That's not a threat. Now, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.   (BTW: That last part was Ben Affleck's soliliquoy from Good Will Hunting, except I changed "Patriots games" to "teen movies" and "workin' construction" to "workin' on this screenplay."&nbsp; Super creative, right?&nbsp; Point is, while Nick's thinking about Swingers, I'm busy thinking about Good Will Hunting.)

      All I think about now is this one part in Swingers, in one of the first scenes, where John Favreaueu (sic) is talking on the phone about parties, and he's all "I spend half the night&nbsp;talking to some girl who's looking around the room to see if there's somebody else who's more important she should be talking to, and it's like I'm supposed to be all happy uh, cuz she's wearing a backpack.&nbsp; Y'know and half of them are just nasty skanks who wouldn't be nothing except there surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes.&nbsp; And I'm gonna tell you something T.&nbsp; Are you listening?&nbsp; I'm not gonna be one of those assholes."&nbsp; So fuck your male gaze bullshit and fuck you.

      Monday night, we slept three to a bed.&nbsp; Three to a bed!&nbsp; A single!  Order of sleepers: Nick Kat Trevor  Note: The only thing standing in the way of Nick and Trevor turning totally homo was a cut of thinly sliced Kat acting as a barrier between Trevor's penis and Nick's butthole.  Q: Thinly sliced Kat?&nbsp; Are you kidding?&nbsp; Have you seen the size of that girl?&nbsp; Fucking 16 oz. steak or whatever.&nbsp; A: &nbsp;Shut your butt, dude, shut your butt.&nbsp;   Q: Nick's butthole?&nbsp; Are you kidding?&nbsp; I am an attractive&nbsp;heterosexual girl and I just made out with him and/or interacted with his genitals.&nbsp; That guy's totally hetero! A: Dude, wtf?&nbsp; Are you kidding?&nbsp; Homeboy just scored 40% on the  urlLink gayometer ,&nbsp;and it would have been more if I hadn't been in the room and he weren't afraid to admit to me how he got his rocks off.&nbsp; All he does is talk about how hot  urlLink Randy  is anyway.  The night took a hilarious turn when I was penetrated in  urlLink two funny ways.

      If all the people who thought it was so goddamn cute to be naughty would look at themselves with the same condescension that they look at everone else, they would realize it's way cuter to be oafish than naughty.  So all you clustered up clever kids, hold steady.  Sorry, Kat.  Sorry it's not funny.  It's just, y'know, he ruined my day.

      No one wants to hear about that.  Plus, way to perpetuate stereotypes.  God, like if one black guy steals a car, Kat's all, dude!  Jawon totes stolled a car last night.  What about all the whites that stolled the cars kat what.  ?  Y'know, Kat, some people have some things to say about Polaks, but we don't say then until you go to the bathroom or the Berkeley Auto Row.

      Nick came back to my room early this morning after a night of partying and threw down a pair of his underwear on the floor and shouted,    "Hey, I'm gonna go ahead and leave these right here because they're soaked in cum."  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Am I&nbsp;kidding?&nbsp; No, I am not kidding.&nbsp; I screamed.  &nbsp;

      is actually a band.  I thought it was just some big media joke, but here they are, playing music.  Hey, remember that band from like, denmark or some shit, the Joy Division band... Division of Laura Lee.  Franz Ferdinand is the new Division of Laura Lee.  And Sandwches are the new thing that oughtta be in my stomach.  "Why not just listen to the Strokes?" says Kat.  Ooh, real savvy.  Someone's angling for a job at Pitchfork.  I love love.

      It wasn’t until we were accused of disrespecting love that I realized how many ways there were to break a man’s heart, not to mention the delicate skin around his butthole.   Tuesday at Ross, 9:50 am, this crazy Italian bitch kept picking up bedspreads and gasping “Bella!”  Jesus fucking Christ.  This isn’t the Sistine Chapel, girl.  It occurred to me recently that some awesome marketeer will some day soon launch an anti-Atkins campaign.  The attack would be against pussies who are trying to lose weight, and the basic gist of the strategy would be to have slogans like, “Be a big man, eat a (carb food).”  I pitched this idea to Agnes, and she claimed it would never work, as carbs usually exist in pussy foods (irony, dudes).  Be a big man, eat pasta?  Be a big man, eat a muffin?!  Baguette?!  PASTRY?!!  As if.  It was at the exact moment we nicknamed Veljko “Blade” that I knew shit had hit the fan.  “There’s nothing ironic about a black fly in your Chardonnay,” huffed 7th grade English teacher Mr. Phillips, “That’s just plain bad luck.”  Remember that one semester in high school we called Charlie ‘Chaz’?  Eww.  On Monday, we kicked off our first viewing of Christmas ’98.  Brent has an ex-girlfriend’s home video of her fam celebrating the Yuletide, Minnesota style, and we gathered ‘round his no-green television screen and voyeured.  It was at once the most beautiful and disheartening thing you’ll ever witness.  Fashion hasn’t changed since Christmas ’86.  Grandpa is a drunk.  The six-year-old bitch in plaid is a whore.  The little boy in the vest is gay.  Grandma sings in the same high falsetto characteristic of everyone who grew up during wartime.  The bespectacled pre-pubescent playing the piano has fat fishstick fingers and fucks up even the simplest single-note rendition of Jingle Bells.  Everyone insists on doing things for Aunt Deb.  You know what?  Fuck those guys.   “You accuse all your friends of being fobs,” Agnes snapped, blinking back tears, “So basically, you’re implying the only one who has assimilated is you!”  You said it, I didn’t, fob.  Nice accent, too.  In considering the actual size of ants and comparing them to the assumed size of the shrunken youth in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, it’s a miracle those guys were rescued.  Okay, so what you’re trying to say is, nobody likes a quitter.  When mom asks me why I don’t have a boyfriend, I just don’t have the energy to explain to her why wild horses run free.  And dude, it doesn’t mean I’m not totally popular, mom.  It wasn’t until after Agnes’ faux-miscarriage that we realized just how much we missed dead baby jokes.  Getby!  Get off Friendster, it’s 18+ !  Dear DJ Danger Mouse,  I can’t decide whether I want to listen to Simon & Garfunkel or Le Tigre.  Will you mix them together so I can listen to them simultaneously?  Thanks!  Love, Kat  A marriage of convenience?  Maybe later.  When me and Charlie were sixteen, we came up with the most fantastic line of jokes.  Observational humor was at its peak, and Chuck and I were bit by the life’s-little-foibles bug.  The format was simple: What’s the deal with…? followed by an answer, which served as the punchline.  Chew on this, y’all: What’s the deal with cowboys?  Chaps and spurs, what is this, gay porn?  What’s the deal with black people? Slavery’s over, you can go home now!  What’s the deal with Native Americans?  Don’t you get it?  We don’t want you here!  What’s the deal with incest?  I love my family!  What’s the deal with gay people?  And how do they do it without laughing?    Etc., dude.  Fucking A or whatever.  That is some fu-hunnnny shit.  Sometimes I’ll start thinking about these zingers and practically shit like ten bricks just trying to keep myself from laughing because I’m in a no-nonsense place, like work or school or the dentist’s office.  Damn, were you that funny at sixteen?  My sense of humor went downhill fast after that, and now all I’ve got going on is a sad sad set of butthole jokes and a sad sad butthole (See?  Butthole joke).    Shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants?!  Are you kidding?  That’s your song lyric?  We saw your mom at Costco, dude.  Once, in high school, we went downtown to help out gay people but got freaked out by their gender bending and left before ever really contributing to the cause of tolerance.  “Why’d he ask you out?” asked Liz, bewildered, “Doesn’t he know you’re into marketing?”  As secretary of the Intel Folsom Chapter Golf Club, Daddy’s responsibilities include, among other things, taking minutes at club meetings.

      is evil.  He, I think, has sex with 17 year old interns on the pretense that it will help there careers.  I can't believe that I have no job and he has two jobs.  I don't believe.

      Nick finds the home videos of America really funny, and LOLs along with every laugh track.  But then I go and write some funny shit on blogger and he's all "It's kinda funny."  Are you kidding?  Do I have to get a dog to bite my ass on film to get noticed?  Deep down, Nick is just really insecure.

      We got down and dirty on the dance floor.  Brent's shirt came right off.  Ag's face twisted into a perma-snarl, one akin to that of a masturbating teenage boy approaching climax.  Liz humped everything she could get her groin around.  I stuck my shapely ass straight up into the air, hoping someone might tap it.  Nick periodically guest-starred by rubbing his calloused hands all over Brent's chest hair.   It's all fun and games until someone gets aroused.

      So I'm working for free at this duplication place and they've got me researching all the vendors that are going to be at this extreme sports conference down in LA.  I've found a lot of amazing stuff, but here's the bit of text that comes up for the first website after googling "Surfer Creed":  Excel: Is there a surfer creed or mentality that you follow? R: Althoughthe surfer mentality can vary, I definitely follow one which is chill.  I love love.

      I asked, upon returning from the soda machine. "Because all of the sodas are always sold out except for the ones we want." (Namely,  urlLink Hansen's Natural Soda  and  urlLink Diet Coke .) "No," she assured me, without missing a beat. "We're just indie." Thanks, Kat. You're the best.

      According to the August 2nd, 2004 issue of  US Weekly ,  Ashton Kutcher  is losing his edge. PROOF: He didn't get down and dirty at producer  Shawn Piller's  bachelor party. "Ashton was text-messaging Demi [Moore] the whole time," says a source.  The best hate crime I ever committed was when Agnes and Tommy and I found out where  Adam Lamberg  (Lizzie McGuire's "Gordo") lived in Unit 1 and wrote, "Thanks for the fuck. Love, Lizzie" on his dry erase message board. Sorry!  The same issue of  US Weekly  had a picture of  Britney Spears  groping fiance  Kevin Federline  right in the crotch area. The caption said "Mitts On His Bits!"  I just about shit a brick laughing.

      When you log in to (loginto?) blogger it says password and then there's a link that says forgot? in case you forgot your password.  If you look at it real fast you might thik it says "password  urlLink faggot? " and that might make you laugh.  Like, they're suggesting that that might be your password, because you're totally closet.
