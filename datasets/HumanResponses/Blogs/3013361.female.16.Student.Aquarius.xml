      My review on the movie Cold Creek Manor: This movie was a poor excuse for a thriller. About as predictable as can be. It's recycled plot which included the recycled idea of having a young child repeat a "confusing and mysterious" phrase was a little too "blah" for me. Stars Dennis Quaid, Sharon Stone and Juliette Lewis couldn't help the disastrous writing. With bizarre bits in it made to be frightening they just suceeded in making me think...."wow, this movie is pathetic" The overall plot could be summed up: Man & wife find house, house has been taken by bank, previous owner was in jail, previous owner mad that man & wife have house, previous owner tries to scare people out of house..."but why?" I admit it sounded good but it proved to be a recycled plot with minor adjustments.   *******SPOILER ALERT****** Newsflash the old throw the dead bodies down an abandoned well, has been done, remember a little movie called The Ring? They did it. Calling the well the "Devil's Throut" doesn't make it any more mysterious!

      This is my first review on my all new blog:  Review of the CD Songs About Jane by Maroon 5  This cd is a spectacular cd by a not so old not so new group. Some of the songs have a jazzy feel, but they all have a driving rock beat. They're great songs for when you're happy and feel like singing along loudly. A more mellow song on the album "Shiver" is really good also. The cd is around 15 bucks and has 13 (?) songs on it. It's a great cd!!!!  Out of 5 Stars: ****

      My Review of the Movie: Mean Girls  This movie was spectacular! It was not your average dumb teenage movie. It wasn't just a love story or just anything. With many laughs, (the entire theater was dying) and a meaningful plot I loved it. The plotline is Cady (pronounced Katie) has been homeschooled her entire life, she starts her first public school when she's 16 and gets a whole lot more than she bargained for. It's a great movie and guys and girls of all ages should see it.   I give it ***** out of 5 stars

      My Review of the movie The Terminal I give it ***** out of 5 stars This movie was really great. Starring Tom Hanks,Stanley Tucci, Catherine Zeta Jones and more it was very well written. The overall plot is Viktor Navorski must stay in the JFK airport after his home country (Krakohzia) has a military coup while he's in the air. Since his passport is no longer valid because technically his country doesn't have a government anymore he must stay in the terminal and is forbidden on American soil. Its really a good movie and Tom Hanks does a wonderful job in his role.

      My Review of the Movie The Stepford Wives I give it ** 1/2 out of 5 stars This movie was kind of a letdown. It was hyped up and full of big names (Christopher Walken,Glenn Close,Matthew Broderick,Nicole Kidman, to name a few) but the plotline was overall, boring. The movie looked like it was just thrown together and not really thought through. But, even a bad movie can have some good stuff, there were some funny moments but its a wait til it comes out on video kinda movie.

        This is my review of the cd Jason Mraz -Waiting for My Rocket to Come I give it *** stars out of 5 Its got some great songs on it for sure but it depends on what you like. He's a little pop,rock, on the verge of wanting to rap but seems too afraid. His song Too Much Food is one of my fave's because the lyrics are just really light and funny. Another good one that is slower&nbsp;and more soulful is Who Needs Shelter. Its a good cd but not on my all star list yet. ;)             &nbsp;

      My Review on the movie The Notebook I give it ***** out of 5 stars This movie is not due out until the end of June but I went to the sneak preview tonight. This movie is wonderful! A great love story that made me cry twice and I'm not normally the crying type. Starring Ryan Gosling (Murder by Numbers) and Rachel McAdams (Mean Girls,The Hot Chick) its the story of two people in love but society's standards could not accept it. Taking place in the late 40's its a touching story. You must see it. Guys will hate it but girls will love it!

      My Review on the CD  The Beautiful Letdown-Switchfoot This cd makes it onto my all star list..meaning its a cd where I let it play through and don't skip any songs. Its spectacular! With rocking songs and some soulful ones its a cd you should definitely buy, and not burn it of your friend cuz Switchfoot deserves credit for this one. The lyrics are catchy yet meaningful and the guitar is sic. I love it!

      My review of Troy I give it ***** out of 5 stars (for the ladies) I give it **** out of 5 stars (for the men) I loved Troy. It had great action sequences and a good story. This was a great opportunity for Eric Bana to make up for making that sucky movie Hulk. Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom were delicious and I have to admit Brad Pitt's butt definitely made the movie better. I think you have to like men and blood for this movie to appeal to you.

      So this is going to be a couple of reviews: First off the movie Big Fish I give it ***** out of 5 stars With a fresh plot and great actors (Moulin Rouge's Ewan McGregor and White Oleander's Alison Lohman) the movie was a good one. The story was great and filled with lots of excitment and some laughter. The overallplot is a son is upset with his father who lay dying that he doesn't know anything about him because his whole life has been lies. Well you get to see some stories of the father and you really get in touch with the son's feelings. Its really a great movie in my perspective.   Next movie Honey I give it *** out of 5 stars It was a cute movie. With great dance moves and an okay plot. Jessica Alba was good but Mekhi Phifer got shorted on his part. Such a great actor deserved more. The great dancing kept this movie afloat. Overall plot: Honey Daniels (Alba) is a bartender/record store worker who wants to be a dancer. She gets spotted dancing at the club she works at, gets a job and ends up having a crappy boss. With some twists and heartwarming stuff this movie is not too bad. Guys will like all the scantily clad booty shaking, girls will like the story.    Next movie Love Don't Cost A Thing I give it * out of 5 stars Starring Nick Cannon(Drumline) and Christina Milian (recording artist) it was below average. The plot was recycled, and badly at that. Advertised as comedic and a love story it was barely either. Nick Cannon came off as annoying, Christina as a bitch. It was pathetic and a waste of 4 dollars to rent it.   Next movie Along Came Polly I give it *** out of 5 stars Starring Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston this movie was a disappointment. It was hyped up as funny and it was pathetic. The only thing that saved this movie from Gigli status was Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the pathetic has-been movie star and Hank Azaria as the french nudist. Its worth seeing but wasn't as funny as I'd hoped.

      My Review of the Movie Spiderman 2  I give it ***** out of 5 stars  One of the few sequels that was better than the original. I can't wait until the next one. This movie was great. It had a great plotline and I was glad to see Tobey in the role (there was a scare he wouldn't play Peter Parker in the sequel because of back problems). This movie can't be summarized or anything you just have to see it its so good!

      So, recently I watched that glorious thing on E! titled "101 Reasons Why the 90's Rocked" well first of all, the 90's were barely a decade ago it's way too soon to be bringing them up. Sorry if i disagree but boy bands, Britney Spears, the Macarena and the Spice Girls may have rocked for their 15 minutes of fame but they're done. Sorry, but Britney Spears is still not cool. A certain junior we lovingly refer to as Anna Nicole, Britney Spears is a loser. Another person who has had their 15 minutes and is done....Avril LaVigne. Bye bye Avril. Get your nasty faux skater girl butt right back to Canada. For the love of god you can't even spell boy! Lesson 1: Boy not boi Not that difficult Avril. Go back to Canada and maybe we'll let you come back when you've written some decent lyrics.

      Pondering....what if hell froze over? You know all those people that say "Yeah, I'll do that....when hell freezes over!" I mean everywhere people would be doing stuff for others, I know of people who would have to give blood, my father would have to buy me a VW Beetle and so forth. I mean...is anyone out there willing to sell their soul to the devil to get him to freeze hell over? I really want a Beetle. Just think the devil sitting there with chapped lips and rosy cheeks. Strange, I know. But, how cool would it be if hell froze over? No pun intended. Pondering.

      Well, I'm taking this opportunity to post my thoughts, beliefs, superstitions and other  random  ideas. For one, I do it, some of my friends do it, but do you?? No! You dirty minded fiend. I'm talking about wishing. Yeah I wish. I wish a lot. I wish on falling stars, on necklace chains that need to be spun, I even wish on the time of day. Well specifically 11:11, 1:11, 2:22, 3:33 ( i think you get double for that one because there's 3 threes), 4:44, 5:55 and I also wish at 2:17 my birthday. I don't know if they ever come true but a few have. But wishing isn't all that nuts is it? I mean we've been wishing on birthday candles for centuries. There's been wishing wells since forever. But why? Wishing gives us hope in things happening by pure luck or just pure faith that they will. Wishing can be fun. So, just for me, wish once today.

      Today Kiri and me were discussing the Disney Channel. More like psychoanalyzing but hey...same difference. The core of every Disney Channel Original Movie and/or Original Series is to have the main characters be 3 best friends. 2 being of one gender and the other of course being the opposite gender of the other two. Two people must be of the same race and the remaining will be of a different race and/or gender. Case in point Lizzie McGuire. Lizzie is white, best friend Miranda is hispanic, other best friend Gordo is a guy and Jewish. That's So Raven, black girl, best friend is white, other best friend, black and male. It's a pattern.

      I have a question. More of a thought really but anyway. Why is it that the fat girl never gets the guy? I mean on tv shows they don't even have fat people. One of my fave shows One Tree Hill does not have a single person larger than a size 5 on there. All the guys are muscle-y (word?) and have perfectly chiseled jawlines. Where are the fat people? Seriously, the show isn't very realistic but hey, it's still cheesy enough to maintain my attention. I'm beginning to think that the stars of my show took all the fat people and locked them in a dark cellar with no food and they won't let them out until their cellulite covered legs fit into size 5 jeans. The fat people are being held hostage with ho hos and twinkies just out of reach. They pant and drool as their flab is crapped out and their stretch marks fade. Please, for the love of god, release the fat people!

      Well, I decided to proclaim today National Twinkie Day. As I was cruising through the aisles of Cub Foods with my mom a guy in dressed as "Twinkie the Kid" came up to us. Proclaiming a "Happy Easter" he handed us free cupcakes. Well, Twinkie left but 5 minutes later he was back and came up to ask me something. What? I said, as he removed his hood to reveal that Twinkie Boy was actually pretty cute. Asking how old I was and for my number I began to laugh. "Oh come on! How often can you say a Twinkie asked for your number?" I made him wait for my answer but eventually I instead got his number. Twinkie Boy was actually 20 and my mom decided that no way could I ever call him. Nonetheless, in his honor, April 10th is now National Twinkie Day.

      Sleep  Sometimes I think about my life and view it as a mess and I just want to sleep Sometimes something bad will happen and I'll cry and then comes sleep The world is constantly in motion but all is still within sleep In life you may be a whirlwind, flying from one thing to another but it's not so in sleep Sometimes you want to get away from the world but there isn't any money in your account so you sleep For in sleep you can journey to the coast of France and in sleep you can be the next big movie star In sleep you can be whatever you want and all your wishes can be fulfilled in a wondrous land of fantasy Sleep is a treasure, for even those who are imprisoned can sleep and forget it all But some days sleep doesn’t want to be like that Sometimes the sleep isn't a blessing but a torture You toss and turn wishing to wake up but you can't sleep is holding you hostage to the beasts and monsters of its lair You finally wake, sweating and panting and then realize you're safe So, maybe that's the whole idea with sleep It's a comfort for the days when you can't take it anymore and on the days you start to take this life for granted it gives you a reality check as a way to say "hey, you don't have it that bad" So lay back, close your eyes and just sleep ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Well, I've been thinking today which I pretty much do everyday so it's not anything rare. My head is swimming with ideas and thoughts and I want to just write everything down but some of them are so awful I don't want to share. But, today I witnessed a horrible act of prejudice and racism, nothing violent, just awful words spoken. People who think that just because someone is a different race, religion, etc. I can't stand it. I try my best not to think like that and when people do it makes me so mad. Today I was so furious I could've screamed. I heard some of the people I love call other human beings terrible horrible things that made me want to cry and yell at the same time. Racism, prejudism anything of that nature, is just not cool. If you think like that then you're a moron because God created all man equal and who are you to try and upstage God? Pigs.

      I'm going to publish a poem or two that I've written in the past year. There are so many I'll do one a day or so until I'm out of old stuff:  Lost In a Whirlwind  Spinning fast, so fast I can’t think the words inside my head fly through me I can’t stop; the French words being spoken outside my world are annoying Trying to focus on the task at hand is a chore as he drones on His monotone rant interrupted occasionally by his attempts at being a ballerina or actor But back in my world my own thoughts are a ticking time bomb Soon I’ll explode and my peers will dodge the flying debris of my twisted mind The words in Technicolor will slam into the cream colored walls of this institution Ducking from the exclamation points and semi colons they’ll hit the ground Trying to escape my whirlwind they’ve been lost in  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Blech, I feel like crap-ola. Today was an interesting day. I made some eye opening observations and some decisions. I really wish I could swallow but my throat feels like sandpaper.  Surrender poised, and elegant waiting for the sign to surrender swallowing, gulping sweating waiting for the sign to surrender palms clammy, eyes watery heart beating faster than lightning If only a sign would come so that  her heart might know when the time will come for it to surrender

My mom is supposed to come back tomorrow but I don't know if that will happen. I'm so pathetic and lonely. I'm going to go see the musical at tri-valley for some entertainment. Well, I best be getting ready.

      So, today was friday or more appropriately still is friday and was by far the most uneventful friday ever. Except after school when me and anne and addi became the 3 headed blob. I don't know if we ever formally called ourselves that but we were quite blob-ish. We entertained the masses (if masses are like 4 people who didn't even stay for the whole song) with our renditions of three blind mice, row row row your boat, my bonnie lies over the ocean and um...something else i don't remember. I decided that when I grow up I want to be a dog. All they do is lay around and eat and chase their tail. I wish I could be a dog but then again I probably wouldn't like the fur.

      As I sit here just having "finished" my math homework I thought "in what scenario will i ever use this?!" You don't chill with your friend when you're 30 and they're like "so what should i name my kid?" and your reply most definitely will not be "well, let me figure out what x equals and then I'll factor this equation and I'll have the answer for ya!" NO THAT NEVER HAPPENS.  I did a survey and 4 out of the 4 adults I asked (all over 40) if they'd ever used algebra, or trigonometry after school they all said a big fat NO! It's pointless I tell you. Not to mention I'm learning virtually nothing because my teacher is crazy. Completely insane. She also is ugly which makes it hard to concentrate. She also has weird habits of making little strange comments. But if I listed all the reasons I can't learn in that class we'd be here all night! In conclusion Math Sucks. I even made a little song about it. It goes like this.  Math is gay Today is april fools day I'm not fooling though Math is gay and it's a ho I hate this math I'll never use it wish i could burn my book  That last part didn't rhyme but it's true nonetheless and i don't know how math can be gay or a ho but you know. Ha, I rhymed.

      "A person does not have to close their eyes to dream for a dream can be captured in the single glance of a wishful thinker."-Me  So, I was thinking about people and about some people who take it as their personal assignment to condemn the acts of other people. They think that somehow, by telling others what they're doing wrong or how their actions are viewed that they're doing some miraculous act. These people, need to die. I'm serious. There is no room on this planet for people who think so narrow mindedly. Some specific people come to mind but they shall remain nameless. But if you think that you are one of these people or that you may do this sometimes, then I'm talking about you.

      Have you ever wanted somebody so bad that you could feel it in all of your body? No matter how much you try to think of something or someone else it never works all your thoughts return to them. You try to distract yourself with tv, or work but you find yourself daydreaming of them. You can't imagine spending your time with anybody else and you can't imagine sharing your thoughts and secrets with anyone else. Your entire heart belongs to them. They have it and the key and they're the only one. Because you're in love.

      i haven't wrote anything in a long time. I guess i haven't had any epiphanies or glorious proclamations to make. Right now I'm desparately putting off doing a project. I had a thought the other day. I've decided I want to change. I don't want to be a mean bitter person. I want to be happy and I am happy. Recently I've realized all the great things in my life and how blessed I am to have great friends and a family that loves me and would do anything for me. Recently I've just been happy and it feels like nothing in the world could upset me. I love it. I wish I could tell everyone how to live like this and how I've achieved this extreme happiness but I really don't know, it just happened. I'm so happy right now I could fly but I'm pretty sure I don't know how so I'm not gonna try that right now.

      I want to just lay in the sun and for all the things in my life to be perfect. Ever been so full and you can't tell what you're full of? Full of love? hate? passion? hope? I don't know. But, I just feel like I'm going to expode! I feel happy yet I feel worried. I want to go dive into a pool and when I resurface have all my wishes come true.  Kiss me, out of the bearded barley Nightly, beside the green, green grass Swing, swing, swing the spinning step You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress  Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight Lead me out on the moonlit floor Lift your open hand Strike up the band and make the fireflies  Dance silver moon’s sparkling, so kiss me  Kiss me down by the broken tree house Swing me upon its hanging tire Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat We’ll take the trail marked on your father’s map  Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight Lead me out on the moonlit floor Lift your open hand Strike up the band and make the fireflies  Dance silver moon’s sparkling, so kiss me  Kiss me beneath the milky twilight Lead me out on the moonlit floor Lift your open hand Strike up the band and make the fireflies   Dance silver moon’s sparkling, so kiss me  So kiss me So kiss me So kiss me So kiss me

      Well, today was the hog roast and live auction. It was really fun. I organized a cake walk and we made like 43 bucks. Not too bad, for a cakewalk. My mom who had told me she had "only a dollar" somehow managed to get a lot of crap from the auction for only a dollar. But its okay cuz she got me a watch from Nordstromm's. I'm happy. But, right now I'm sitting in the basement of my new house as my dad and brother play pool. My brother sucks really bad. I'm super bored right now that's why I'm writing dumb stuff.

      Well, I'm in my new house now.I have my computer back in my room but since my computer's a dinosaur I have to have dial up internet. :( I've been spoiled so I can't stand the slowness of this beast. On another note, I managed to get myself grounded for this weekend. I really don't think I deserve to be grounded. It was my brother's fault too and all he got as punishment was "don't provoke your sister" and I get "no going out all weekend, no having friends over, no movies, no nothing." My mother is so unfair and she favors him so much. I hate it!

Today I went and saw The Terminal, you can check out my review on it at http://biodegradablereviews.blogspot.com  Soon, everything will be moved into my new house but I don't know how regularly updated my blog will be until then. Nothing really exciting has happened lately so that's all I've got.

      Well, today was day 2 of summer hell. It was raining during class which just made it that much harder to pay attention. The troll was making a demonstration about how when people say stuff at different levels it means something different. Like, the same exact sentence can be said at 2 different volumes and mean different things. He was like "Whispering I love you is taken more seriously. What would you think if a boy just yelled I love you in your ear?" and right when he started to yell it this huge crack of thunder happened and it was all so loud between him yelling and the thunder that half of us jumped out of our skin. It was pretty funny. And then he said something in spanish and was like "did you understand that? no, because its not in your 'field of experience'."Which is what he was teaching us. He was talking all about our fields of experience and then he asked this kid Trevor if he understood what he said in spanish and Trevor was like "No." so the troll goes "Right, because its not in your field of experience, its not english, its mexican" Nice job, troll. The language is spanish not mexican.

      Well, tomorrow marks the beginning of the downward spiral my summer has begun. School has been out for what like 2 weeks? And already I'm going back, for summer school. Yet another one of those decisions, having a free hour sounded like such a good idea but now its time to pay the consequences. There are 29 days of summer school left. That is 58 hours. That's 29 days where I'll have to get up way too early for summer and go sit in a stuffy room listening to other bad decision makers make speeches about god knows what. Kill me now.

      Perhaps the feelings that we experience when we are in love represent a normal state. Being in love shows a person who he should be.-Anton Chekhov   This quote is so true. Everyone should experience love. I love this quote because it expresses my feelings exactly. Everyone should just try love, even if you don't think its the "right time" or you're not sure if you actuall believe in love, try it. Perhaps once you're in love it'll just be normal to you and it will show you for who you should be.

       This week I've had the great joy of getting to help out my Mom with games at VBS. Its awesome because I get to play with all the different age groups. I have to say I like the preschoolers the best .&nbsp; Half the time they don't listen at all and they don't understand the games sometimes but they're so funny. Like this one little girl Ashley has the best manners, and she always has a purse, though what a 4 year old needs a purse for&nbsp; I have no idea. Then there's Owen, he doesn't listen much, but he is the cutest little boy. Today during snack Ashley was like "Owen, nice manners! Chew with your mouth closed!" It was hysterical. They're so funny. They love tug 'o' war. We had all the preschoolers on one side and me and my mom on the other side. They "beat" us and went around telling everyone how strong they were. And then being at VBS makes me feel like I have huge muscles. Because, for some reason there's always less girls, so my mom will tell the boys that the girls get to have me on their side and they're all like "NO! THAT'S NOT FAIR! WE'RE GONNA LOSE!" It's great, I felt like the Hulk this week. Oh and the preschoolers, can be not listening at all and their teacher can be like "Simon says, sit down." and they all do. Just who is Simon? And why does he hold this strange power over 4 year olds?

       So, tonight my mom is gone, so we were arguing over who has to cook. So, me and my brother played Rock,Paper,Scissors for who has to cook, he lost. Then my dad was like "if he cooks, you have to clean up" and I was like "no, let's play for it" so we played R,P,S again, he lost. He should've learned not to gamble since last time he lost he had to wear a dress. Haha.

      So today I went to Julie's house with my mom so she could get her hair cut. While I was there I got to see the new baby! Her name's Faith Elizabeth and she was born on June 11, she is so cute. And then Noah, he's getting so big (he'll be 2 in October) was being hysterical. Julie said that he doesn't like Faith getting more attention so he yells at her to stop. He yells "Baby! Stop it!" its so funny. And then he runs around and growls and throws things. He's hilarious. I might watch them tomorrow night. Who knows. Anyway, I'm about to get some shut eye.

Just for fun here come the lyrics:  Fell in love with a boy Fell in love once and almost completly He's in love with the world Sometimes these feelings can be so misleading He turns and says "Are you alright?" Oh, I must be fine 'cause my hearts still beating Come and kiss me by the riverside, Sarah says it cool, she don't consider it cheating Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah Red hair with a curl Mellow roll for the flavor and the eyes for peeping Can't keep away from the boy That 2 sides on my brain need to have a meeting Can't think of anything to do My left brain knows all love is fleeting He's looking for something new I said it once before but it bears repeating Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah Can't think of anything to do My left brain knows all love is fleeting He's looking for something new I said it once before but it bears repeating Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah Fell in love with a boy Fell in love once and almost completly He's in love with the world Sometimes these feelings can be so misleading He turns and says "Are you alright?"

       Okay, back to what I was talking about like 2 seconds ago. You know when you like someone and all you can see is how great they are, how they seem to say all the right things and all that crap. Well, grow up because you're being stupid. No one is perfect and if you think someone is, chances are they're going to do something to really tick you off. It happened to me and now I'm seeing all the other flaws they've always had but I was too lovestruck to see. Don't ever be like that.

       So, today its like something whacked me in the head and my brain started working again. Why do girls get all worked up over guys? Its like&nbsp; I was blind and thought I completely liked this guy but now its like "duh sarah, you guys would never work" I feel like I've wasted my whole summer though! I have to make up for lost time. Because seriously today I was like "wow, in order for something to work, both people have to want it and that's not how this is" I just feel so dumb but now I'm like "whoo hoo! I'm a genius again" God, I'm dumb.

      Another mission trip story. Last night, we got back to the hotel around 10:30 or so and Karen, Ashlynne, Courtney, and me were in our hotel room, which was adjoined with the 3 Jessica's, Chelsie and Brittnay's room. Lindsey was also in our room but she was visiting Shannon's room at the time. Well, me and Karen, Ashlynne and Courtney were watching SNL and then Brent and Jeff decided to come too. Well Jeff was really really slap happy. He was half asleep on the bed and then he got up and walked in front of the tv. He just stood there with his arm resting on it and we were like "JEFF! What are you doing?! You're blocking the tv!"&nbsp; and then he like jumped, I'm pretty sure he like dozed off or something. And then he sat on the bed and fell off. He was like a drunk person. And then Karen called the other girls room and pretended to be like a stalker person. Chelsie was like "did you guys call our room just now?" and we were all like "no...we're watching tv" it was great.&nbsp; And omg, our joke the whole week was we'd find sugar packets that said "sugar" on them and we'd be like "hey, you lost your nametag" and hand them to people. It was so funny, well, to us at least. Oh yeah, and after being in Missouri for 4 days, you will gain a southern accent, and it will be hard to lose. LOL!!!!   Yeah Ebonics...we call him Ebo for short. *secret handshake*

      Okay, so I'll tell y'all some more about the mission trip. Last night, we stayed at the Drury Inn in poplar bluff. Well 45 minutes from Poplar Bluff is Sikestown. In Sikestown there's a restaurant called Lambert's Home of the Throwed Rolls. It is a really fun place to eat. Well the wait to get in was like an hour or more, so we passed the time by going to the gift shop,&nbsp; playing a game called King Toad, and throwing super balls through the parking lot. It was really fun. Well, they actually do throw rolls at you. They came outside and started yelling hot rolls and if you held up your hand they'd throw you a roll. It was so funny. Well, while we were eating, Karen, Courtney, Ashlynne and Me realized we had gained southern accents by being in Missouri too long. Then we couldn't stop talking like that and it was hilarious. So Courtney and Karen decided they were from Texas and that their new "texan" names were Cantaloupe or Cantie for short, that was Karen, and Courtney was Aubrey cuz we had met a girl from Texas who was named Aubrey. It was so funny though. And somehow it came to be that Karen had impregnated Jeff and he was having twins and they're all texan so Karen decided they had to have 2 names cuz everyone from Texas has two names. Courtney suggested Jimmy John but Karen named her twins Tree Frog and Kiwi Banana. We were so tired last night from being at the water park all day that we were just slap happy so everything that came out was so dumb and we just laughed the whole time. And then today somehow we decided Jeff was Saudi Arabian and his name was Jafar and his mom was Jamal. I still don't fully understand that but it was sooooo much fun!

       Well, I just got back from Missouri today. I was on&nbsp;a mission trip w/ my church and it was awesome!!!! We left Wednesday and were at the work camp until Saturday morning and then we went to Bluff Falls Water Park all day. I've had sooo much fun these past few days. I've met a ton of new people and got to know a bunch of people that I already knew a lot better. It was so much fun. Its going to take me a few days to remember all the fun stuff that happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's see, on day 1 we got set up in our rooms, met our work crews, figured out what we'd be doing, etc. In my crew there were 6 people counting me. Two adults, Bridgette from Florida, and Mark from Nebraska. Then there was Kelsey, she was going into 8th grade and was from North Dakota, Jordan, he was going into 7th grade and was from Kansas and Robert, who was going into 9th grade and was from Oklahoma. We got an assignment to work at an elderly man's house on a job. His name was Leonard and he had parkinson's disease and was the sweetest old man. He asked us if we believed in guardian angels, we said yes, and he was like "well me and my wife think that you're our guardian angels." We finished his job by like 1:30 that day so we moved onto working with crew #40 that Jess G. &nbsp;was in. I was so glad to see someone I knew! Her crew was awesome and we spent the next day and a half having a blast painting a house. These past 5 days I will never forget. But right now, I'm in pain because of my lovely sunburn so we're going to have to take a break on this.

      Garrrrgh! That was a Steve the Pirate spasm, sorry. I'm so blah today. Well, right now anyway. I feel blah. Like, I have no emotion, I'm not happy, but I'm not sad, I'm not angry or tired I'm just here. I just exist with no feelings. I'm blah. I wish I had friends online right now, maybe then, I wouldn't be blah.

      So, today, I went to the Sugar Creek Arts Festival w/ Anne and then we ran into Kelsey there and she hung out with us too. We spent the day dying of heat and complaining about the mediocrity of our romantic lives. Yeah, Kelsey likes this guy who she can't stop talking about and he sounds adorable, Anne just broke up with a guy that has turned into a drama king/ass and I like a guy who probably wouldn't spit on me if I was on fire. God, life is great! Actually, he might spit on me but then he would deny it later if asked. So now, here I sit in my basement thinking about how frustrating my life is. I bought this candle today which smells like laundry detergent and its awesome. It smells clean, and I love it. Although a nice candle in the scent of motor oil might be refreshing...only like 2 people are going to understand that. Why does everyone have to be so judgemental and play these little mind games that make me want to pop their little heads off? Ugh, why can't things just be how I want them to be. Oh, in better news, 2 days (not counting today) until the mission trip. I can get out of this boring state and have some fun. Maybe a break from my life will make me see how all of this crap really isn't that bad but for now, its awful.  ~Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to hide the bodies of those people I had to kill because they pissed me off

Well, Austin's mom died when he was 4 so we were talking about something and this happened.   ~Austin -Me :My Mom  ~I think my Dad should get a girlfriend :What kind of girlfriend? ~A pregnant one -A what?! ~Pregnant, when a girl is pregnant, doesn't she have a baby? :Yeah... ~Then that's the kind he should get -Austin, you have brothers and a sister ~Well, they're not at my house a lot, I want one that's always with me :Austin, baby's don't come out ready to play with, they cry and you have to change their diapers ~Oh yeah, that's right :Does she have to be pretty? ~Not real pretty, but on the day they get married she should be :All girls are pretty on their wedding day ~She should like racecars too   Then later on we were talking about Hawaii again  ~I'm going to live in Hawaii :That's what I hear, why? ~Its nice there, and you can swim all the time :Really, what are you going to do there ~I'm going to be a racecar driver and work at a restaurant -Like, be a waiter? ~Yeah, and a racecar driver :Are you going to go to college and study to be a mechanic? ~Yeah, probably :I think that would be a good idea because waiter is kind of what you do in college, not for your whole life ~Oh yeah... -Are you going to get married and have kids? ~Yeah, if I find someone in Hawaii

What will you do there? ~I'll work at those places that serve food, restaurants. Uh huh. ~That's the only places they have in Hawaii, right? Yeah, maybe. I think they have other places to work though. ~No, there's just houses. In the movie there were only houses and restaurants.Are their roofs made of hay in Hawaii? I don't know. ~I saw a movie and they were made of hay in the movie. Maybe they are. ~We're going to leave in a minute. Yup. ~I know how long a minute is. How long? ~60 seconds, because 60 minutes is an hour. How long is 60 hours? Almost 3 days ~That's a long time, I sleep like 25 hours Really? That's over a day ~Its not like way over the day, its just like I sleep when it's dark That's like 12 hours. ~Oh, well then that's wrong.  A conversation w/ me and my 7 year old cousin Austin.

      I just realized that I forgot to tell all you people reading this about "The Squirrel Incident" It happened a week ago. Let me tell you the whole thing from beginning to end. Some background info: I'm afraid of the animals that are dead and have been stuffed. Like the kind that hunters have on their walls. Just so happens Alex's Dad has a squirrel stuffed and hanging on their wall.  The Story: It was a week ago, I think it was June 28th, a Monday. Anyway, Alex wanted out of swim practice so we arranged for us and Brent and Drew to go see Dodgeball. Well, after the movie we decided to head back to Alex's house for some video games and air hockey. Well, while chilling in her basement somehow Brent and Drew found out I'm afraid of "The Squirrel" Well, that's where chaos ensued. Drew would pop up behind chairs, from around corners with "The Squirrel" and me being the chicken I am would scream in terror and they would all laugh hysterically. Well, it was time for me to go so I was sitting "the tank" about to call my mom to tell her where I was. Since it is known by all that I have the best luck imaginable my mom picks up the phone the instant that Drew sets the dead, stuffed, nasty squirrel on my lap. My mother picks up the phone to hear hysterical crying, etc. She thinks I'm in an accident, and I'm flipping out cuz the thing I hate most is on my lap! Drew, Alex, and Brent are standing in Alex's driveway laughing their heads off as I'm screaming and trying to explain to my mom what's going on. My mother tells me to calm down and just get home. She said this in a rather mean and irritated way. When I got home I got a 20 minute lecture on how I shouldn't scare my mom like that and how it was irresponsible of my friends to act like that. But now, looking back, it really was funny. Although I am sick of getting im'd pictures of squirrels. Luv ya guys!

      Here's a bunch of crap I wrote during summer school, its what happens when I'm really bored and my mind is constantly running:  ~Life isn't a punishment Don't live life like it is Everyday is a gift to you Treat it like so Appreciate everything you get Learn from everything you experience Let life be your gift  That is how it was intended  ~If I'd wanted the answer to remain a mystery I wouldn't have asked the question.  ~Don't let the world tell you how to live, let the way you live tell the world how you feel.  ~A lot can be said about a man who lies, but nothing said about him is ever a compliment.  ~Maybe Not definite not anything a small word used to hide your true feelings just say what you mean and mean what you say maybe means nothing to me it tells me nothing, if I aksed the question I want to know the answer maybe's not an answer its a word you'll tell me because you're too big of a coward to say yes or no so you rely on maybe  ~Don't tell me maybe, I'd rather hear no because at least no will tell me to stop believing while maybe tells me there's still hope if you insist on saying maybe, well then maybe you're a jerk

      You look at me and say "she's random" I look at me and say "I always have something new to talk about" You look at me and say "she is so loud and obnoxious" I look at me and say "so what, at least I'm entertaining" You look at me and say "she could bear to lose some weight" I look at me and say "that's not the thing that matters most in life" You look at me and say "she's different" I look at me and say "yeah, i am, and thank god for that"

      I just wish that people would give me the chance to prove myself. It feels, sometimes, that people just look at me and decide what they think without ever giving me a chance. I'm not all that I seem to be. There's so much more to me and if people would just give me the chance they would see who I really am. I'm not just some super hyper and random girl. I have all these ideas in my head and all these dreams and thoughts. I just wish I had someone to share them with. I wish someone would share their ideas with me because I'll listen. I try my hardest to give everyone a fair chance at proving who they are. I've made so many new friends by doing this so I really can't understand why people won't give me that same courtesy. If you would just give me a chance I promise I'll show you, you won't regret it, not for a single moment. I promise, a promise is all I can give you, but with me a promise is sacred. So, I promise, you'll see if you just open your eyes.

      I'm frustrated today. Why must people frustrate me? One day they're perfectly happy and friendly and all that other crap and the next its like they're a completely different person. I can't stand that! I know that we all have our bad days but it seems like some people live two separate lives. Like they have two personalities and each personality lives half of the life. One is the mean life and one is the happy life. I think that somedays I'm Sarah and then other days I'm Regis. Regis is my evil twin, I could explain to you how her name became Regis but I'm just going to let you wonder. But today I'm Sarah but I'm guessing tomorrow I'll be Regis cuz I have summer school :( Oh and I got a cat today, her name is Phantom. She's very smart and very pretty.

      All of the sudden part of Elton John's song "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" popped into my head. I'm going to put the lyrics in here cuz I took it as some sort of sign considering I haven't heard that song in years.    can't light no more of your darkness All my pictures seem to fade to black and white I'm growing tired and time stands still before me Frozen here on the ladder of my life  Its much too late to save myself from falling I took a chance and changed your way of life But you misread my meaning when I met you Closed the door and left me blind by the light  Don't let the sun go down on me (Don't let the sun) Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me  I can't find, oh the right romantic line But see me once and see the way I feel Don't discard me, baby no, just because you think I mean you harm But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal  Don't let the sun go down on me (Don't let the sun) Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me  Don't let the sun go down on me (Don't let the sun) Although I search myself, it's always someone else that I see I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, baby Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me.
