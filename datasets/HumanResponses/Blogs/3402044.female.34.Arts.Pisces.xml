      BEAUTIFUL DREAMER.  I choose to sing that song for my vocal exercise appointment.  They give each student 10 minutes with a piano accompanist.  So Instead of working on the song I'd chosen for free choice, I went with this one.  On something of a whim too.  And when I was done I grabbed my bag to run off to put on my costume for theatre rehearsals and there was this couple making out next to the doorway.  I was wondering why they chose to stop there and had they heard the song? Seems romantic... I'd like to think so.

      How many times I have heard those words in the past couple days.  "I saw you Saturday night, you did good."  Drives me nuts.  That's what I'd say if it were  passable  work.  You know that look people get in their face when something works, when something's interesting.  I am searching for  that  to know I am going the right way, or another look to tell me otherwise.  If I suck TELL ME PEOPLE how else can I grow? I can objectify around my ego, sock it to me PLEEEEAZSE.  I asked my acting instructor for something he could suggest I work on based on my performance.  He told me the obvious - or at least what was obvious to me.  I need to be more into what my scene partner is saying.  But 5 weeks wasn't enough time.  So sad.   He also said it wasn't his place to reinstruct after another teacher already directed everything - like, it'd be an inadvertent criticism on the Director. Ya ok agreed.  Good's not good enough, I want to MOVE people.  Otherwise, what's the point?  One of my friends gave some decent feedback.  She told me I was interesting to watch, that my character was under control and not me so she found that interesting.  STILL... I hope someone videotapes this production this weekend, I'd like to judge myself!  I will start studying in a Shakespeare seminar in 2 weeks.  John Webster included.  Sounds like fun.

      Pretty lyrics, old lyrics.  BEAUTIFUL DREAMER  Beautiful Dreamer, wake unto me, Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee; Sounds of the rude world heard in the day, Lull'd by the moonlight have all pass'd away! Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song, List while I woo thee with soft melody; Gone are the cares of life's busy throng Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me! Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!  Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea, Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelie; Over the streamlet vapors are borne, Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn. Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart, E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea; Then will all clouds of sorrow depart, Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me! Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!

      ...enough in the day to make a difference, no? I've recently decided that I really, REALLY want to move on from this job.  I just don't have any passion for what I am doing in my full-time employment.  I worked my way into this position, and I have been working toward making a transition.   My place of employment... is very secure.  The people here all have huge cushiony benefit packages and everyone wants to retire.  Retirement is death. So is the stagnant air in here. It isn't challenging.  I feel at least with creative work even if you are not challenged there is a difference in the momentum with the work being done as opposed to, say, doing research, pulling files, writing technical jargon in an area I feel no passion toward... property.  *yawns* ...makes me wonder what "security" is anyway.  I was thinking about "faith" the other day, and wondering in what ways do I live having faith in my existance and in what ways do I not? Are my actions based on having faith, or not? and, what is it to have faith?  Main Entry: 1faith  Pronunciation: 'fAth Function: noun Inflected Form(s): plural faiths  /'fAths, sometimes 'fA[th]z/ Etymology: Middle English feith, from Old French feid, foi, from Latin fides; akin to Latin fidere  to trust  -- more at BIDE 1 a : allegiance to duty or a person : LOYALTY b (1) : fidelity to one's promises (2) : sincerity of intentions 2 a (1) : belief and trust in and loyalty to God (2) : belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b (1) :  firm belief in something for which there is no proof  (2) : complete trust 3 : something that is believed especially with strong conviction; especially : a system of religious beliefs synonym see BELIEF - in faith : without doubt or question : VERILY   I think people are more probable to end up in the direction they're inclined whether it's negative or positive just by how much meditation they put on those ideas.  It's a part of our creativeness in our nature.  Doubt will hinder you... I remember reading a book on successful people in history and what made them different.  I recall that one man said NO MATTER WHAT, he did what he believed in and ignored everyone else.  Any decisions he decided to make he committed to and refused to listen or be affected by others.  As a result he was very successful in property investments.  On the other hand, it's difficult to stand alone if you do things that aren't what other people ARE doing or have done.  Somewhat like swimming up stream.

      Ah, Monday. Well, theatre went well this past weekend.  I was incredibly nervous opening night, Friday. I thought it was funny Saturday night though... because when the playwright came out to mention a few things, we actors only heard about 6 or 7 people clapping.  Someone whispered to me before we went on, "It sounds like there are 5 people out there. I doubt it's a big crowd." But I walked out to see a LOT of people there, most of the room full, actually. Performing was scary, exciting and fun.  My poor stage husband! Haa haa. I am 34 acting opposite a 19 y.o.  He's a great actor but he seems awfully confused with everything going on.  I think this play was a big growth experience for him.  We met as friends last year but now that we're acting out all this romantic stuff, he freezes up a lot and doesn't talk much... I know he's the lead and carrying a lot... eh it's probably just my head skewed from all this work.  I'm awfully happy lately and I don't know why really.  Maybe I'm doing something right. I'll write again when I have something more to say... I'm still feeling this system out.

      Ok. Now that I'm broken in... I'll post another entry.  I have to get off the computer shortly anyway. Nice idea... Suz mentioned her online blog.  It sounds like fun.  I killed my MySpace account so that attempt at a journal attached to some face value is gone. Hmm...! I keep a manual diary, or, at least reverted back to manually maintaining a diary in January, when I was in Europe.    I am on my way to my last theatre rehearsal... the next few nights are legit shows.  I am good nervous.  EXCEPT Tuesday I was exceptionally tense when I was rehearsing.  Why, I have no idea but I was.  Anticipation I suppose.  I'll write more fun stuff later... Ciao Ciao!

      I am being surrounded by ...young men... boys... and they are cute and sweet and sweet and cute and adorable and charming.  If they do not back off I will be forced to pinch them, quite possibly pinch them to DEATH.  Let's not forget this isn't helping my recent wave of depression either, all this sugary sweet uncalled for kindness I am encountering.  Thank you.

      Let us not forget fine wines and great hard liquors.   Yet, let's take a moment to recognize beer.  CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE BEER DRINKER  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ "Sometimes when I reflect back on all the beer I drink I feel shamed. Then I look into the glass and think about the workers in the brewery and all of their hopes and dreams. If I didn't drink this beer, they might be out of work and their dreams would be shattered. Then I say to myself, "It is better that I drink this beer and let their dreams come true than be selfish and worry about my liver." ~ Jack Handy  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ "I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day. " ~Frank Sinatra ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  "When I read about the evils of drinking, I gave up reading." ~ Henny Youngman  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  "24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case. Coincidence? I think not." ~ Stephen Wright  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  "When we drink, we get drunk. When we get drunk, we fall asleep. When we fall asleep, we commit no sin. When we commit no sin, we go to heaven. Sooooo, let's all get drunk and all go to heaven!" ~ Brian O'Rourke  (We all know God's probably Irish!)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  "Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy." ~ Benjamin Franklin  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  "Without question, the greatest invention in the history of mankind is beer. Oh, I grant you that the wheel was also a fine invention, but the wheel does not go nearly so well with pizza." ~ Dave Barry  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  BEER: HELPING UGLY PEOPLE HAVE SEX SINCE 3000 B.C. ~ "Anonymous"  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Remember "I" before "E", except in Budweiser.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  To some it's a six-pack, to me it's a Support Group. Salvation in a can! ~(anonymous)   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I'LL DRINK TO THAT   And saving the best for last, as explained by Cliff Clavin, of Cheers. Cliff Clavin was explaining the Buffalo Theory to his buddy Norm. Here's how it went:   "Well ya see, Norm, it's like this... A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain cells. But naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. That's why you always feel smarter after a few beers."

      ... I had this love interest last year. Philip.  He's in England.  Surprised?!  I am but I don't know why... I saw his blog earlier.  He works in cartography?!  How did we not put that together...  Funny. A week ago or so I was updating some of my work files...  Land Development Maps, Regional Planning Maps... all the while the trancy melody of the song  Maps  looped in my head.  We're both surrounded by maps And totally disconnected. We share this system, but we're no longer in touch...  Maps.   How can you NOT say Maps without thinking "wait, they don't love you like I love you?" (YYY's) - their strongest hook if you ask me; as if it's popularity could possibly run more rampant...

      I have this one particular good friend I met back in 1997.   He always tells me that I remind him of some actress of the moment, that he's watching in series or movies at the time. Why are you so sweet?  Voila:  > Speaking of acting, I have gotten obsessed with this 'older' (2000) tv > show that just came out on DVD in it's first and only season.  I know if > I tell you the name you will be put off - but the lead actress Linda > Cardellini TOTALLY reminds me of you in this.  Same facial expressions, > eye movements, mannerisms... I know she's playing a part - but there's > always a lot of the personality in there.  Freaks me out ... ok it's > Freaks & Geeks.  She's the 'cool' one though - even though her little > brother doesn't think so.  How cute is that...he's always sweet and encouraging.

      There are only four questions of value in life.  What is sacred?  Of what is the spirit made?  What is worth living for,  and what is worth dying for?   The answer to each is the same: only LOVE.

      An excerpt from my travel journal  January 2004  LAX to LHR  "... I don't half mind writing my trip diary manual style.  I don't write manually much anymore.  I sort of miss it a little. So I've been in London almost 24 hours ! Not bad considering I am still a bit jet lagged.  AND I've done, I think, quite a bit in such a short period of time. My flight out of LAX was Wednesday night.  D took me to the airport.  Traffic was just about standstill for the whole way over.  We got there and it took 2.25 hours leaving from home! My ticket said the gate for my flight closed at 8pm... but it was delayed a half an hour anyway. On the flight over I thought the accomodations on BA were really nice.  The seats were a bit jammed together but otherwise it was good.  I was squished between 2 men - one was BIG and drunk, so needless to say I was having to be patient.  BA is nice.  I had asked for vegan meals and they were really good.  They'll even prep lacto-ovo on request.  My dinner was like eggplant & couscous.  All the free alcohol you want - at least up until you're 'dancing in the aisles' as the attendant put it.  So I had a (small) bottle of Bordeaux wine from France.  And each seat had its own tv/radio with movies.  And guess what was on... Moulin Rouge.  I missed maybe the first 20 minutes, it was good.  Could have been better but still good.  It's all about love.  Sigh.  (A) had said it was one of his favorite movies... I tried to fall asleep after the movie.  I think I did alright I got about 4 hours of sleep on an uncomfortable seat.  Turbulence was ok.  No wonder people try to get drunk, the turbulence is disturbing but eh, it wasn't all that bad.  Woke up at 5:45am, close to normal as I'd go to work.  I thought they'd give breakfast but since we were in the UK zone they gave us lunch.  A light one.  By the time we got off the plane it was 4pm Thurs UK time.  The now very drunk and large man to my right wanted to talk.  He drank alcohol the whole way over, even up until they told him that they didn't serve liquor with the morning meals.  Then he started asking for orange juice, went up into the overhead bin, got a large bottle of vodka out of his travel bag and opened up his own bar.  He offered me a screwdriver, I passed.  Very friendly, he offered to share a cab.  I figured since it cut the cost, why not? Especially since I was so TIRED.  Eh! too expensive, even though he paid for a 1/3rd of my ride! Avoid the blakc cabs, too costly.  Drunk.  Kept trying to offer me things.  He kept associating himself with Prince Charles.  Drunk.  I didn't care, I felt sorry for him especially since he couldn't handle himself very well.  The ride total was 59#'s! He gave 25#'s, I put up 40#'s.  Both the taxi driver and the drunk said the area I was staying in was seedy with lots of junkies and prostitutes! (however, once I got there it was far more relaxed and simple than LA! Nothing alarming).  Oh goodie.  To digress a moment, the drunk said the funniest thing.  He said that although his father is Irish and he is 1/2 Irish he claims to be English since he was born in England.  If he were to claim to be Irish, he'd be accused of being a "plastic paddy"!"  I had no idea I was being a plastic paddy! Ah! :)

      Billy Shakes says, "It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves." And Paulish W. says, "...and it’s written in the stars meant for us / soaked into the sand made by time taken by the hand from above / I really do feel that we work for love..."  As for me, I speculate.   IF (T) + (secret name here) =   Part 1: Planets and Aspects  Sun Trine Pluto  This aspect is sure to give a very strong and powerful bond. The energy present here will change both of you at very deep levels. In time you will know every aspect of each other's personality and you will reveal secrets to each other that others will never know. A passionate and emotional nature is a powerful part of this configuration and this will help make you even closer.  You will make a very dynamic and powerful team and you can make major differences and changes not only in your own lives, but in the lives of the people around you as well. Should you decide to serve others in some way, then you will have a very positive effect on their lives. Any difficulties that you experience in this relationship will be transformed by this aspect. This relationship will be a very serious one and it is likely to involve more of you than any relationship you have had before it.  Because of the transforming and probing energies in this aspect, normal patterns of existence and behavior will be changed by your relationship and new insight into your lives will be revealed. Together you will have an unlimited faith that will see you through any situation and thus transform you in the process.  Investigating the unknown, delving into unchartered territories, achieving great accomplishments and creatively constructing something from virtually nothing are all possible for the two of you working together as a team. Scientific, business and financial endeavors may be your strong suit. You can be excellent bargain hunters together and you can work with and profit from taxes, insurance, wills or things connected with the dead. There are strong and potent clairvoyant and intuitive abilities at work here as well.  You can expect fate and unexpected events to play a role in bringing this relationship together and keeping it on course.   Oh really?    And,  SECTION I:  How (T) Relates to Other People   Mars Conjunct Saturn with an orb between 1 and 3 degrees  Your emotional needs were not met when you were growing up and there was nothing you could do about it. Even today, you tend not to express anger or pain or resentment except when you are in an infrequent rage. This is a problem in close relationships.   Sun Opposition Pluto with an orb between 1 and 3 degrees  Power struggles plague your relationships. Either you become the dominant partner out of a fear of being controlled or you become very passive, controlling indirectly through guilt or manipulation. Your father may have been emotionally abusive to you.   Venus Opposition Uranus with an orb between 1 and 3 degrees  You need to be close and you need to be free. This is a major life conflict which has always created complications for you in close personal relationships. One manifestation of this may be a tendency to pursue the unavailable or the unreliable.   Mercury SemiSquare Mars with an orb of less than 1 degree  Since you tend to be rather irritable and sharp-tongued at times you require a partner with a sense of humor who is not too thin-skinned. You are bright, curious and restless and enjoy the company of those who are equally high-spirited and enterprising.   Mercury SemiSquare Saturn with an orb of less than 1 degree  You are a serious person and inclined to be somewhat inflexible in your thinking. Since you tend to be rather judgmental, you could only be happy with someone who is in philosophical agreement with you and conceptualizes the world as you do. Sometimes you are rather taciturn.   Mercury Opposition Pluto with an orb between 3 and 5 degrees  You're not awfully good at being disagreed with. You delve into matters, think them through thoroughly and expect your conclusions to be universally shared (t-hee!). Flexibility is not your strong suit. No one should try to lie to you or keep things from you. Somehow you ferret out others' secrets although you keep your own.   Sun Trine Neptune with an orb between 3 and 5 degrees  One of your great strengths is your sensitivity. You tune in easily to the psyches of other people and, while you may not notice the color of their eyes, have an almost eerie understanding of their private inner worlds. Your close ties are very private.      SECTION II:  How _______ Relates to Other People   Venus Square Uranus with an orb between 1 and 3 degrees  You need to be close and you need to be free. This is a major life conflict which has always created complications for you in close personal relationships. One manifestation of this may be a tendency to pursue the unavailable or the unreliable.   Mars Square Saturn with an orb between 1 and 3 degrees  Your emotional needs were not met when you were growing up and there was nothing you could do about it. Even today, you tend not to express anger or pain or resentment except when you are in an infrequent rage. This is a problem in close relationships.   Mercury Quintile Jupiter with an orb of less than 1 degree  You have a quality people trust and you are often sought after as a confidante or an advisor. You have high moral and ethical standards and it is imperative that anyone you're close to is a person of the highest integrity. You prefer well-educated people.   Venus Square Jupiter with an orb between 3 and 5 degrees  You may be overly self-indulgent and inclined toward excesses of eating, drinking, sex or anything which gives you pleasure. You would not be comfortable with someone who was too reserved. You can be quite extravagant both emotionally and financially.   Sun Trine Neptune with an orb between 3 and 5 degrees  One of your great strengths is your sensitivity. You tune in easily to the psyches of other people and, while you may not notice the color of their eyes, have an almost eerie understanding of their private inner worlds. Your close ties are very private.   Sun Sextile Pluto with an orb between 1 and 5 degrees  You regenerate yourself through periodic transformations of your life situation. Your relationships can only endure if your partners grow and change with you so that you wind up still pointed in the same direction. Otherwise you will leave them behind.   (T's) Sun Square _______'s Neptune:  You must guard against mutual deception and misunderstandings. T tends to have an unrealistic view of _______, and _______ has a tendency to unconsciously capitalize on T's imaginative and often simply erroneous perceptions. The tendency to be dishonest, hide things from each other, exaggerate, and spur each other to unrealistic hopes and dreams is very strong. Both of you must be able to distinguish fantasy from fact, and utilize the increased sensitivity and heightened imagination that you inspire in each other, without letting it cloud your ability to clearly and realistically see other and understand each other.

      Not long ago I was walking down the street and I glanced over at the different newspapers under glass... buisness and trash.  I was surprised to see a friend of a friend named Kimmy on the cover of the 'X-press', an adult (why do they call it adult anyway) paper.  I wondered if they stole her photo or if she sold it.    I think I'll stick to advertising my photospace for bands I want to support...

      After spending a LOT of time in heavy meditation and contemplation yesterday, I woke up twice in the night, sharp and jarringly, with answers to my questions from my sleep! AND I FORGOT THEM!!!  The first moment of awakening was something REALLY positive and optimistic in total contrast to where I am... it's so faint.  Was I in this relationship I want? I remember when I woke, and this happens on rare occasion, it's like a HUGE gust coming at me, telling me what I need to know, the words hit me quick just as I wake up.  And the words were there, I don't remember them now though! Although I think it had to do with being in love.  The second one I don't recall I just remember I woke twice with that same gust of information, as if there was only a moment to blurt out what I needed to know just before jumping from dreamtime to waketime.  I find things like this fascinating.  Dreaming and sleep...

      The first time I’d heard Elliott Smith was going along in a car ride with someone.  This guy was singing along to “Between the Bars”. I said, “WHO is this?!”   “Oh, Elliott Smith.  He does music work for soundtracks, and indie stuff.” He said.  Hmm.  It rang spiritual.  I caught on to ES late in the game.  I didn’t start buying his music until 2000.   I saw him perform for free at the local junction street fair they put on every year, I think this was 2001, I don‘t think it was 2002 but I don‘t recall immediately.  By then Elliott was struggling on a down slope, seemed to be less in his favor.   I remember… I brought my boyfriend at the time, we walked to the street fair.  I wanted for him to hear Elliott live.  Before the show began people were pushing and shoving to get close to the stage, very much the clichéd imaged of packed sardines.  Elliott came out in his Willie Nelson (?!) homage, wearing a hat & 2 braids.  He was drunk.  He turned to his girlfriend constantly for support.  Once he began singing, it was like a chemical blanket of peace and happiness covered everyone.  Suddenly everyone was concerned for the other people around them, that they were ok and comfortable, instead of pushing and shoving as they were before he began.  People were offering their spaces to people who had a lesser view.  My boyfriend …even he squeezed my hand and looked at me with this sort of surprise, emotional blush at how strong the sensation was.   As Elliott played, he’d drop off and forget what was going on, forget the words, forget…forget… drunken slurring, messy… and everyone would sing the words really loudly for him and he’d carry right along on what was being fed to him.   After that night, some people wrote reviews and bitched about it.   I thought he did fine.  I'm biased when there's love in my heart, eyes and mind, for the things that I find.  Everything's mint.  The last time I saw Elliott Smith alive was on the evening of August 3rd, 2003 before his death on October 21st, 2003 (RIP - August 6, 1969 - October 21, 2003).  He played with this band called “The Physical Plants” at a Kinks Tribute.  I brought my camera (YAY) and I got video clips!  Sadly, I mistakenly deleted one of the clips of a solo he did.  But I still have other footage.  I was really impressed with the band KENNEDY, they really got into the movement of the Kinks’ sound.   Elliott… was with his girlfriend.  I remember his thin t-shirt and how his skin looked beneath it.  I remember the smell of his body mixed with the smell of beer, because he was standing right next to me before he performed, and I was standing front and center.  I remember his eyes.  His expressions.  At times he’d curl up his hand and rub at his face like a small child, that sort of reaction.  His girlfriend seemed really kind to him.   He allowed himself to be easily distracted.  His focus for his performance just wasn't there.    I don’t believe it was suicide, his death by fatal stab wound.  I think someone did it.  I think it’s unlikely that the story will ever unfold and it will remain untold because I don’t think it’s something people will focus on.  I  don't want to  think someone would do that though that's where the probability lies, in my own opinion.  After standing next to both he and his girlfriend just less than 3 months prior, and feeling things out, I don’t believe either of them did it.  I don’t believe she would.  Their faces were very much like… mother and child of the sweetest nurturing kind.  She was attentive and he was slipping into this sort of regression.  I don’t believe he killed himself.  His energy was like jelly.  Just wobbly and awkward, I can’t see how he’d be in the vein of energy to stab his own heart.  He was more in a latent state of energy like burn out rather than self-destruction by infliction.  I think someone else did it.  Mystery.  The news of Elliott’s death spread the next morning, Wednesday Oct 22nd.  I was really sad for days following.  I wasn’t able to get over to his memorial at the Solutions shop wall until Friday.  And I took pictures.  And I was late to my theatre rehearsal that night.  I cried on my way over to rehearsal, but I went anyway.  I felt funny.  Just that one night Friday the vibe was strong, I didn’t want to leave. Actually… come to think of it… that following Sunday I went back and I went alone at 6am ‘cause I wanted to feel what all that energy at his memorial felt like with no one else there.  Sunday wasn’t so sad.  I have pictures… of the sun coming up in the east amidst lots of blackness from a local fire.  And the palm trees standing patient.  And the wall at Solutions as the increase of written good-byes accumulated.  Flowers coming and going.  Candles. Pictures. Presents…  lots of hand-made gifts…   between the bars   drink up baby, stay up all night with the things you could do, you won’t but you might the potential you’ll be that you’ll never see the promises you’ll only make drink up with me now and forget all about the pressure of days do what I say and I’ll make you ok and drive them away the images stuck in your head people you’ve been before that you don’t want around anymore that push and shove and won’t bend to your will I’ll keep them still drink up baby, look at the stars, I’ll kiss you again between the bars where I’m seeing you there with your hands in the air waiting to finally be caught drink up one more time and I’ll make you mine keep you apart deep in my heart separate from the rest where I like you the best and keep the things you forgot the people you’ve been before that you don’t want around anymore that push and shove and won’t bend to your will I’ll keep them still

      Rehearsing for my scene work as the duchess has vacillated a LOT.  Luckily, the immediate instructor agrees with my interpretation.  I think it should be smooth sailing from here on out.  Though last Wednesday I had to grapple with SK and her unique view… as it was her opinion that my exuding “sexuality” is my weakness and that I should work on that for performance on stage.  She wanted me to VAMP up the duchess. She suggested that my partner and I roll around on top of each other on a desk, initiate a strip tease... OH PLEASE.  If I wanted to put on a sexual performance, you should offer to pay me like others would.  I have no interest in putting on a sexual performance on a stage.   Things are back on track, and I get to perform a sort of tongue-tied love as opposed to the stripper whore vamp. Yay. And I am paying for this.  Counting the days…  (something borrowed:) The Duchess comes across to the audience as the epitome of stoicism and strength of soul and character. At the beginning of the play, she is portrayed as a a woman of great integrity and honor, such that Antonio speaks of 'her days are practiced in such noble virtue that sure her nights, nay more her very sleeps are more in heaven than other lady's shrifts'. Indeed, we see her as a noble woman of much childlike innocence and naivety. Even her secret marriage to Antonio is not seen as something of lust and sexual desire, but of a woman's need for companionship and love 'tis not a figure cut in alabaster to kneel at my husband's tomb' , something she obviously cannot derive from her villainous brothers. Even at this point, she comes across as a strong character of intense emotion and longing for affection and love that she must resort to a secret marriage. In contrast, her marriage to Antonio seems cleaner than the Cardinal's adulterous relationship with Julia, his mistress. That the Duchess solemnizes their vows shows that she does have moral standards to uphold. Even her 'feigned pilgrimage' to Ancona was something that she and her family did as a real pilgrimage to pay their respect to our Lady of Loretto.  The childlike innocence of the Duchess is seen from the way that she tells Antonio that 'time will easily scatter the tempest' when Antonio brings up the threat of her ARAGONIAN BROTHERS. Yet, it is because of them that she is made to endure 'the worst torture, pain and fear'. One certainly pities her and feels that she should not be made to suffer so much for following her heart. Indeed, Ferdinand's obsession to 'purge infected blood' seems less a move to right a wrong than out of jealousy 'my imagination carries me to see her in the shameful act of sin'. The Duchess in nobly enduring all his cruel torments becomes a 'reverend monument whose ruins are even pitied'. Yet to a certain extent, while we pity the Duchess, one cannot deny that one feels a great admiration for her strength of character. She accepts suffering as her 'fate' and is 'acquainted with sad misery as the tanned slave is with his oar'. Even Bosola is able to realize the dignity in which she bears herself up to the suffering that her brothers make her endure 'as majesty gives to adversity; you may discern the shape of loveliness more perfectly in her tears than in her smiles'. One admires her for being so ready to accept her fate, the suffering she endures a mere consequence of her loving Antonio and marrying him. It is also through her suffering that she derives a new found wisdom 'your kiss is colder than i have seen a holy anchorite give to a dead man's skull'. Indeed, she realises the extent of her brother's tyranny and knows that she an Antonio must part. Their last moments together are certainly touching, and one truly pities her for being denied of true love. To lose the love of her life drains her very soul, and she is left empty and without meaning in life 'my laurel is all withered'. The Duchess accepts her death with humility, 'heaven's gates are not so highly arched as prince's palaces; they that enter there must go on their knees'. Yet to the end, she is dignified 'I am the Duchess of Malfi still'. Indeed, her 'violent death' seems more of a journey to liberation rather than an end in itself. Throughout the play, the Duchess is portrayed as the victim of entrapment, Ferdinand the predator that toys with his prey, the Duchess before killing her. (see THEME OF ENTRAPMENT).  The Duchess is hence a character to be admired and respected. That she is a historical figure shows that Webster was indeed perceptive in the plight of the Duchess at such a time when her behavior to marry Antonio outside the social status of her family would have been dealt with death, no question to the reasoning behind it. Webster's play hence is a statement against this convention, and the Duchess comes across as a real person of human emotion that each and every individual can relate to.

      I could never be a DJ.  I’d make an awful DJ.  Which is good ‘cause it’s a popular skill in this town nowadays like breathing and eating. I was at a party years ago and I was talking to the guy behind the turntables and he said what do you want to hear?   I said put on Style Council ~ Boy Who Cried Wolf.  He did and people came flying at him, screaming to stop it. I hit the floor behind the console, hiding.  Seriously, I did.   I was scared.  “Why’d you put that on!!!” “Someone asked for it!”  Ok… I’m glad he didn’t tell them it was me.     Like a Seed ~ Kenny (& Yvonne) Rankin   All of the people look at the children Play in the morning sun All of the people look at the children Wishing that they were one (la’s)  There’s a feeling that’s lying here sleeping Like a seed in the earth There’s a new day a new day and a new way We’re all gonna rise together We’re all gonna fly forever Over all the shiny cities And there’ll be nothing left to hide All will be known, we’re going home We’re going home, going home, going home And I’ve got to say that I’m on my way and I’m going home  Sometimes when this feeling arises And everything is too much in place There’s no room to move And no way to ride We just got to keep our souls free We’ve just got to live and let it be Love and trust your sisters and brothers  And there’ll be nothing left to hide All will be known, we’re going home We’re going home, going home, going home And I’ve got to say that  I’m on my way and I’m going home   Maybe I should list composers instead of the bands…     I Got by in Time - PW   Saw a girl that I used to know  I was deep in thought at the time To recognize her face at first 'Cause I was probably looking at mine Well she was the only girl I've ever loved  But my folks didn't dig her so much   I was young  This is serious To me she was the world (she was my world now) I thought I'd never live without her, But I got by in time   Well let me tell you now, Saw a guy that I used to know Man he'd changed so much I think it hurt him to say 'hello', 'Cause he hardly opened his mouth Yeah well he was my best friend a few years ago Truly inseperable   We were young We were full of ideals We were gonna pull this whole world But something happened  I didn't know why But that's the way that it goes.   I suppose, What you say - what you do Don't mean nothing, nothing at all And all the bonds you make between ya Can be broken any time you want now Please tell me if my philosophy's wrong I've got to know the truth I don't mean to offend anyone but, You know it's something that I do, oh-   So nice to see you tonight, And I'm so glad that you came Some of the people standing outside, say Sure feel the same Yeah my point is in a round about way Given time they'll always forget 'Cause the memories That carry me on To me they’re everything  And always will be mine, yeah And no one can take them away

      Do you remember the 24th night of November? Love was changing the minds of pretenders While chasing the clouds away  Our hearts were ringing In the key that our souls were singing. As we danced in the night, Remember how the stars stole the night away… (E,W,F)  About a boy From my archives Written in between interviewing...     Monday November 24, 2003   I am BEAT from rehearsals.  Well rehearsals weren’t as rigorous as all the behind the scenes tension.  It is SO weird.  It’s so... WEIRD.  I really think (A) and I fell in love! Like for real!? He is now with that girl who has been on him like white on rice, he goes through motions with her BUT is unique with me.  He doesn’t move off of her like he does me.  He gravitates to me, not her. He gazes at me, not her. He invests in me not her.  BUT is supposedly working things out with her.  So I now direct my attention on everyone else and he seems sad.  I am trying to pay as little attention as possible to this.  She copies what happens around me.  Whatever guy comes up to me, she tries to imitate the scenario, I don‘t understand it.  No matter how many times you try to walk through someone else’s steps you can’t be them, no one can.  As for me, no one has walked my life walk. I know he and I couldn’t be together, but strangely something was there, something strong.  I have now decided that if the focus, the love, the drive are present so will I be.  If not, I will not.   Even the lead said if you weren’t here I wouldn’t be here, that’s the only reason I am here.   I doubt I will work with this group anymore, there is no passion, I feel like (she)’s doing a job, going through motions.  At least I met (A). We were talking in the lobby and he said call me on my cell so I did and we talked 5 minutes and he told me about her and then he asked me how should he get her?   Then he said I want to settle down, get married, have a family, with YOU.  What the hell?! This is going to make me wacko if I keep talking to people like that.  I can’t be with him! Well, the play is over in 3 weeks time.    I remember when we first met at the first rehearsal.  I wrote a compliment on his sheet in this exercise, he asked me to show him which one and I showed him.  He said that’s all?! I said I can write more, and he handed the sheet back and I also wrote you have sparkly eyes and a very nice smile... something like that.    SO strange. (y) posted a bulletin, so weird.  I guess they had a record label party Saturday night.  The whole post was creative ?! Like rhymes and attempts at being... creative... being a creative writer... eh.   He f’cked up.  I noticed that last week he left a note for that poor, poor girl.  It was mean, that made me think he’s an asshole.  She seems to just adore him by what she writes, he didn’t have to be so mean.  Wow funny how things change.  I gotta rest and reassess my life.  No more games, only serious team players...

      So SK the immutable Shakes seminar director has continued her tension.  The seminar ends in 2 weeks = I will survive.  I was alleviated when I found she can be easily be thrown off of her usual overbearing track by the mention of any of the Beatles... and from this come some interesting Beatle tales...which is a nice thing.  But again she continued with her age-orientation prattling... that is now bothering me because I hear it from her so much.  I am sure this should fade once I am out of range of her influence in a couple weeks.  Last night when she was lecturing me about age, she said, "DON'T YOU KNOW, 60 IS THE NEW 40!"  I said  if that's the case, I'm 12.   My scene partner found it funny...I didn't realize what came out until I heard him laughish.  So... now 60 is the new 40... but at 34 I need to focus on 40?  She really ought to pick a point of view and go with it.

      Because I like the fact that the basis of the work here is upon environmental maintenance & preservation, for the peoples.  Because I work with interesting people:  * Because I work with an older black man who teaches me black hippy slogans from the 60's that I would likely otherwise have never heard, like "B!B! BANG! BANG! UNGAWA! BLACK POWER!"  * Because I work(ed) with a young girl who was in 2 south central gangs in her early teens and only got jumped out because she got pregnant and didn't want her child subjected to flying bullets and so forth.  She taught me how to throw gang signs and she'd get mad at me when I'd practice while we'd walk down the street to lunch.  So we started our own gang, CxPx13 (capital projects 13) and my gang name was casper 'cause I am so white and she's lonely girl 'cause she's so outgoing ...and 'another secretary' is in our gang, loca, 'cause she's so funny.  * Because of another secretary who used to work here but transferred but still sends me reams of funny e-mails and she understands that you don't buy things unless "they speak to you" and she too has a sense for epicurean things.  * Because the chief is a gourmet chef and he brings in breakfast foods that are in higher quality that most top-notch restaurants (yes, they feed me too).  *Because environmental magnet type jobs attract those types of minds and I learn about other health conscious things from the people around me as well.

      I love it when I run into clusters of ideas.  They seem to bombard me all at once, and especially when I am nowhere near a piece of paper, or a computer.   VEGAN FLAG   When I was 21 (1991 for those without calculators), I changed my diet to vegetarian.   Being somewhat aware of how dramatic changes aren't always the most successful, I cut out red meat first... then chicken... then fish... and so on. Why did I do it? The truth? Because I had an enormous crush on PW and he was a vegetarian.  He was an enormous influence on me.  And over the past oh, what's it been now, 13 years (?!), I've been mostly vegetarian.  If not vegetarian I'd then ok fish & chicken in stints.  But I left out red meat because in the least it's too tough for digestive systems, I think.  There have been very few times - I am sure I could count them on my fingers - that I've consumed red meat since '91.  I always noticed a curiosity in me toward VEGANS... you know those types.  They don't eat any animal products, and the hardcore ones go as far as to avoid buying anything that uses any animal product - no leather, no... jello, marshmallows, honey... pretty hard core.  I always fascinate over hardcore.  People who delve into extremes.  From the tender-footed VEGAN whose cautious not to step on insects when they're walking, to the animalistic types who not only eat meat but then crack open the bones and suck on the marrow.  What does it all mean? Does it mean anything? Nothing at all?  My opinion, which is only that, is that they both have their place.  Dunno, either/or.   I was leaning toward veganism.   BUT every single, and I MEAN EVERY SINGLE vegan I have met is not who they seem to be. It's strange.  As I'd get to know them I found the same story every time: A person who is above average in sensitivity, but the more they'd talk about what they do and their views, it turned out to be more of a projection of their self on the animals rather than animal rights for the animals.  When you TRULY do something for  others , for society for whatever it is, it is action for its cause.  It isn't about wearing a badge on your sleeve like a brand name, or a hot topic to discuss, you don't brag or flaunt it.  It isn't about  co-branding yourself  by association.  And though clearly vegans adhere to their actions (and usually quite religiously), each time I found the same story underneath:  a sensitive person who couldn't fight back.  As if they displace their experience onto the animals who can't fight back.  I found it in their words every time.  This really translates to imbalanced ego, as if they're so overly concerned with their own personal failures to maintain that they need to further show this  of themselves  to other people by giving society the consideration of those who can't fight on even footing (animals).    Vegans, in the immediacy of weakness.  BUT, Each vegan I met had benefits as well.  Some sort of relative zen that's very nice.  They are, though inadvertently, doing something right.  What that is I am not sure but I can feel it.  It's like a *toy surprise inside* sort of situation.    Over the past several months I noticed my allergies increasing... dairy, nuts, etc.  And I've found that I've reduced myself to only eating OH just about dirt and rocks.  I hope not to speak the vegan speech, but I am walking the walk...today anyway  Don't listen to me, it's all speculation.  And don't believe anyone who says they've got it down. XX

      One of the prettiest, most haunting melodies I've ever heard...   UNTOGETHER - Lush   It's not easy  But try to picture this; do  You remember  That we were once together  Isn't it strange  Isn't it?  I'm sorry it's come to this but  Why are we here,  Bothering?  What was it we talked about? So...  Just remind me  Of why I'm wasting so much  Time pretending  That there is something more than  Only this  Only  This pointless accusation  Tell me again,  Why are we here?   I'm not offended by the things that you say  'Cause it's such a predictable way to behave  Talk and insult me  'til you're blue in the face  You were right, I was wrong  Now does that make you happy ?  I'm quite aware of all the bad things I did  You don't have to remind me of why you dislike me  There's no solution  To the mess that we're in,  It's so sad and so boring  I wish you'd just leave me alone   But I understand the games you play  I'm ashamed of all the things I did to you   (Author: M. Berenyi)

It's hot, muggy, and worst of all I'm alone most of the time. F:  As soon as I capture Aquinaldo... E:  Oh Freddy, I am tired of hearing that all that has to happen is for you to catch that man!

If I don't capture him by then I will resign from my commision and return home with you. E:  Freddy, when I gave my life to yours, I was giving it to a man I knew to be honest and true.  These past months?! I haven't known him at all... IF I stay, you must promise to come back with me if things haven't changed. F:  I promise, I... E:  One more month, that's all.   MUAH!!!

       Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments.  Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O no! it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come: Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved.   Billy Shakes #116

      dedicated, and from my #1 favorite song writer.  I hear his music, I read his words, I can't take them in enough. I took them in for years until I couldn't see them anymore.  So I took a step back and again I step forward to immerse myself.  He said he doesn't understand people with his music.  He said he wrote his songs for the people in England, using terms familiar to the people who live there, but it can't be true when 14 year olds so far away like myself took to it stronger than food.  I can't  list  all of his words but I want to.  http://dnausers.d-n-a.net/dnetZPMY/weller/lyrics.html  In 1992 he told my friend Anita that he thought I was beautiful, he said I have that "sunshine girl" look.  Luckily she being British too explained that it's supposed to mean your face shape.  Like, your cheeks are high and bright, and you have a fullness when you smile, like sunshine. He could have told me directly had I not been too shy to keep him company... as he had invited us to have breakfast with him at his hotel.  Breakfast?! Too much.  So I had to get this second hand from her. More PW stories? I could but it'd make a small book for sure.  SEE:   http://www.thejamarchive.com  ~ click "free gallery", click on the 15th picture, "Paul has a domestic with girlfriend Gill Price" ...! CUTE, But any more of a view'll cost ya.   LITTLE BOY SOLDIERS  - PW  Its funny how you never knew what my name was, Our only contact was a form for the election.  These days I find that you don't listen, These days I find that we're out of touch, These days I find that I'm too busy, So why the attention now you want my assistance - What have you done for me.  You've gone and got yourself in trouble, No you want me to help you out.  These days I find that I can't be bothered, These days I find that its all too much, To pick up a gun and shoot a stranger, But I've got no choice so here I come - war games.  I'm up on the hills, playing little boy soldiers, Reconnaissance duty up at 5:30. Shoot shoot shoot and kill the natives, You're one of us and we love you for that.  Think of honour, Queen and country, You're a blessed son of the British Empire, God's on our side and so is Washington.  Come out on the hills with the little boy soldiers.  Come on outside - I'll sing you a lullaby, Or tell a tale of how goodness prevailed.  We ruled the world - we killed and robbed, The fucking lot - but we don't feel bad.  It was done beneath the flag of democracy, You'll believe and I do - yes I do - yes I do - yes I do -   These days I find that I can't be bothered, To argue with them well what's the point, Better to take your shots and drop down dead, then they send you home in a pine overcoat  With a letter to your mum  Saying find enclosed one son - one medal and a note -  to say he won.   AND   http://musicaememoria.altervista.org/StyleCouncil-CafeBleu.htm   HEADSTART FOR HAPPINESS  - PW  When I find you waiting hours oh, You’re there to save my life for our obvious goal; We’ve got a headstart for happiness For our part, guess we must be blessed, for this feeling to be so strong Tell me is that so wrong?  The space between us for days has been so far; I’ve spent a lonely week Now I wanna be where you are We’ve got a headstart for happiness, for our part. Guess we must be kissed by this force I feel inside Now I’m not gonna hide.     All the roads that lead to struggles bring you back to where you need Some reassurance in your own depth, only you can see, but let others feel Peace in my mind I’m so happy to find As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you.    You’ll find it can happen You’ll find you’ve got the strength You can move a mountain You just need the confidence   In yourself and all you’ve got to take this world and shake it up Let no one say they’re better than you You must believe you’ve got the power.   When I find you waiting hours oh, It’s my heart, not my head that takes control. And you’ve got to lead where your heart says go And hope that it turns out so. And that’s all you can hope for Can you expect much more?    Naive and wise with no sense of time As I set my clock with a heart beat, tick, tock Violent and mild common sense says I’m wild with this mixed up fury, crazy beauty It’s healthy to find all these feeling inside As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you

      A million tunes for a million moods.  I need ALL his words in a caplet, ALL of them.  Another A-side... F'ck I-Pods... kids can't separate the A's from the B's!  Local and foreign art sleeves!   BEAT SURRENDER - PW   Beat surrender - Come on boy, come on girl Succumb to the beat surrender  All the things that I care about (are packed into one punch) All the things that I'm not sure about (are sorted out at once)  And as it was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end That bullshit is bullshit, it just goes by different names  All the things that I shout about (but never act upon)  All the courage and the dreams that I have (but seem to wait so long) My doubt is cast aside, watch phonies run to hide The dignified don't even enter in the game  And if you feel there's no passion No quality sensation Seize the young determination Show the fakers you ain't foolin' You'll see me come runnin' To the sound of your strummin' Fill my heart with joy and gladness I've lived too long in shadows of sadness     TRANS GLOBAL EXPRESS - PW   Ordinary people don't get time to think not that it's their fault cos you have to hustle and bustle about your work just to make sure the food gets bought goverments threaten you with recession then they threaten you with war how the other side wants to take away all the things you ain't got no more keep us divided with their greed and hate keep you struggling to put the food on your plate. Imagine if tomorrow the workers went on strike not just British Leyland but the whole world who would earn their profits? who would make their bombs? you'd see the hands of oppression fumble and their systems crash to the ground and you men in uniform will have to learn the lesson too not to turn against your own kind whenever governments tell you to.  Get the trans-global express moving and see our marvellous leaders quiver they know that if it happens their lazy days are over the day the working people join together we'll all rest much more easy the responsibilty you must bear when it's your own future in your hands maybe a hard one to face up to but at least you will own yourself!

      I thought recently... people who aren't intelligent merely have more space to grow.  It's not bad to be lacking in smarts, but it's irritable for others who have to pick up and clean up after their shortcomings.  I question racism.  Being someone of at least 2 major nationalities and backgrounds mixed into one body, I don't claim one over the other.  I have met a couple other people of the same mix, but I don't search to create a clan with them, as if they could understand our newer mixture of cultures.   I can't understand WHY people look down on the racist marks of the past but then turn around and contradict this by investing with bias just for their lineage, shopping at stores owned by people of their specific race, so on and so forth.   If people are people and we're just a mixed country, why aren't people respecting that more. I don't believe GOD to be a racist God.  I think of the idea of God as more on a plain of a mindset and not one nation over another.  Why one race or one religion over another? Why do people think like that...

        I thought,  I'd like to find an investor .   Then, I found Investor Protection Trust (IPT) on the net.   The primary mission of the Investor Protection Trust (IPT) is to provide independent, objective information needed by consumers to make informed investment decisions. Founded in 1993 as part of a multi-state settlement to resolve charges of misconduct, IPT serves as an independent source of non-commercial investor education materials. IPT operates programs under its own auspices and uses grant to underwrite important initiatives carried out by other organizations.    All this verbage could be used for relationship counseling.    For Love , not money. If they just added love, they'd have the basic elements required for an ideal relationship.   And FAITH.

      Again, I get to recite a male part in the Shakes conundrum.  But Hamlet will have to wait as I intend to wear a dress, not pants, for my Gertrude and Duchess works presented.  My new soliloquy (in modern text / I am memorizing 1st folio, so not these words verbatim) as Hamlet:  (1.2.131-61)  O, that this too too solid flesh would melt Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!  How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, (135)  Seem to me all the uses of this world! Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,  That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature  Possess it merely. That it should come to this!  But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two: (140)  So excellent a king; that was, to this,  Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother  That he might not beteem the winds of heaven  Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? why, she would hang on him, (145)  As if increase of appetite had grown  By what it fed on: and yet, within a month --  Let me not think on't -- Frailty, thy name is woman! -- A little month, or ere those shoes were old  With which she follow'd my poor father's body, (150)  Like Niobe, all tears: -- why she, even she -- O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,  Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,  My father's brother, but no more like my father  Than I to Hercules: within a month: (155)  Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!  It is not nor it cannot come to good: (160)  But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.   * * * *  All that's really going on here is Hamlet recognizes his mother's inability to function as she should have.  And why is this? Simply, she's an addict. Wombsickness.  Apply generously and repeat as needed.    "...why, she would hang on him, As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on"  If the reader can't see that Billy is feeding you the answer here directly then you just can't see.  He's not leaving any question, it's not just an increase of appetite, (as if - to lead the reader into the thought)  it HAD grown by WHAT it fed on .  Addiction. Those damn chemicals. It shapes everyones thoughts and has been so throughout the ages... which brings me back to TWO and the simplistic nature of life. My friend L thinks life is "8".  I said the play on the upright symbol for eternity is cute, but I think life is TWO "2".   "Behind every great man there's a great woman." old prov.  "Frailty, thy name is woman" - would ANYONE have said anything if a man remarried as quick? Would it be  that  horrible? As if a woman should carry all the romance and love in her display? Chemicals are on both ends, it's symbiotic. She just happened to be the one left alive. Frailty, thy name is humanity.

      Something that drives me CRAZY.  Most musicians today are not creative...! They're more often than not more dry and technical than the accountants I used to work with, BLLLLLEAAAAH!  I see it all the time, ALL the time.  I'd say it's about a 75/25 ratio, tech over creative.  Basically they're just following a structure with little sense of the flex or the new of what they make, imitating other statistically popular sounds...  That's... yuck.  Even people who 'look' creative usually aren't.   I'll meet these musician guys and they're like, 'why would you do that', or 'why would you write that'... they have no precept for (new) concept!  I fit these types under an umbrella I created called  'past-tense realists' .  You don't really have to explain what you're doing to people who create things.    My friend was getting all up in my business the other night.  I don't like feeling like I have to walk someone my age through my thoughts but I guess sometimes people just don't get it.  And it wasn't like he was sincerely curious, but moreso bothered that I wasn't in line with his thoughts or how he understands thinking to be.  He was upset that on my other web page I used the word 'torture'.  He couldn't understand the context in which I used that word, he couldn't get beyond a primary definition of that word, he doesn't understand metaphor or ... well ... he clearly doesn't do any creative writing.  He was really bothered by that one word.  He was also bothered by things friends of mine wrote about me.   I said if someone wants to express their opinion or affection toward me in their own way, who am I to tell them how to do it? He said yeah but it was ... weird.  I said that's not my business.  If that's how they express what they're feeling, that's them. Way too elementary for me to have had said it aloud... Technical... musicians... annoy.   Pretty girls, pretty boys, Have you ever heard your mommy scream NOISE ANNOYS ! (homage to my latest stop in the ear candy cycle ~ the buzzcocks ~ YAYAYAYAYAAYAYAYYA).  Not to mention him saying, "you used to list all these cool bands, now your page doesn't look like that anymore." Ummm, am I A FREAKING PAGE ON THE NET?!?! No.  You know what things I like, you get the point.  I have enough people trying to hang out I don't need to impress anyone with my capacity, I can keep it simple. He's not the first person to lose site of me by means of overcompensating a page for MY PHYSICAL SELF HELLO I am the person not a freaking page. A friend of mine got really bothered that I deleted a webpage I didn't want.  SHE took it personal.  That's scary.  Internet is fun but if you can't cut your dependency to where it significantly molds your view of other people... at this point in the game... you're screwed.  Sad for you.  Of most things in life you should be able to get up and walk away.  I would hope of all things in life this would be most difficult toward other REAL LIVE PHYSICAL PEOPLE and not webpages...  yikes.

      About a boy. From my archives. Written in the heat of our post exit interview...   PROS AND CONS    PROS:  *I like the fact that he’s Mexican.  There are good things about Mexican men I like, and there are also things I don’t care for; but it was easy to sieve out things in pieces because they’re so clear cut. 	I.e.  Good: strong values, strong sense of pledge to family & family values, strong communication skills, strong, strong, strong, masculine, passionate…etc.  *He smelled good all the time even when he thought he smelled dirty, he smelled good to me  *Even when his hair looked a mess, it looked nice to me, like something I wanted to touch  *He was workable (except when afraid of something I didn’t know he was afraid of) - most things he listened to and thought through and came up with alternatives or conclusions, workable solutions…this is rare in men, sadly.  *His eyes were truthful *His smile was connected to his soul. *His loudness was direct and honest *His enthusiasm felt sincere *High energy *Driven *Passionate in every way *Warm *Very affectionate and physical *Very outspoken and for the most part appropriately outgoing *I woke up next to him happy and very comfortable except for one night: *The one night we went to bed tense, when he woke up he put his arms around me and we were fine again, and he admitted that he had uncomfortable sleep ‘cause we argued… I felt the same about my sleep.  *His sense of intuition is very sharp, so it seems *SMART *Wants to learn many things *He felt like me! We were that comfortable.  I couldn’t feel a difference that made me significantly uncomfortable. *AMAZING focus! Like I’ve rarely seen if ever… *Sharp *Chemistry - major thumbs up! Good connection from the start *He worked hard to win me over, not an easy task, even though he didn’t have to… *Friendly even though he’s somewhat a loner *Amazing hand holder, hugger… any touch. *Animalistic …rawr - eats marrow, eats with his hands, looks for the core, the root, driven, digging, tearing, powerful…  *And he cooks too!   CONS   *OOOH suspicions! *WAAY too flirty and aggressive with women to the point of disrespecting everyone, not good ‘cause he ultimately didn’t care about anyone’s feelings if they were hurt or not  *There were times when I suspected that he took this double dealing too far and I tried not to see it that way but it clearly won in the end.  *He wanted me to be part of what he called a “triangle” with 2 other girls that he said were his “best friends” - I don’t believe that structure works at ALL.  In my book the S.O. is #1 and everyone else is a generous #2.  *He betrayed me in the end with one of the “best friends/ex-girlfriends".  He was physical with her but to what extent I do not know, and I don’t care to know.  So, he lost me.  *EGO - barf! He got a big ego in the end, likely got inflamed due to his discomfort with the quick pace and his inability to adjust/readjust …but that comes with age and experience.

      How did that happen…? I show up to this seminar and the whole thing was like a scattered deck of cards! Lots of shuffling and reshuffling going on.  Scene work shifting.  I no longer have to get “intimate” with my scene partner! YAAAAAAAAA! That was bugging me.  I wasn’t sure what was the worst part of that since I’d see my partner’s gf at work and she seemed noticeably uncomfortable.  Lots of odd things around them and their discomfort, it was just screwed all the way around.  Then SK was just overseeing everything while one guy headed off DOM and another for the Shakes work.  And the guy teaching the DOM work told me, (once SK took off), to not bother with the whole piece, to cut it short, so I wouldn’t have to get physical with my partner, YAY.  It wouldn’t have been a big deal without all the other odd factors about it.  Not to mention the text was weird - My character is supposedly so noble as a duchess that no one can approach her, so as a widow she’s alone.  So, she decides to approach her man-servant to marry her.  All the words were about how great she is and now that she’s accepting him as her husband, he can now feel free to say what he likes & blah blah blah.    So, I am only doing a 1/3rd of that now! And since I am done with my shakes monologue, that guy instructor gave me another monologue to do, so I’ll be starting the opening of the performance as well.  Now I have 4 pieces but it’s better!  Though still not excited about… Sonnet No. NINETY-ONE.   *     *     *    *     I love my friends.  I am really lucky that I have good choice people in my life.  Went out with D last night.  Before we went out we talked and planned it and I suggested this one place and she said uh, there aren’t older men there? I said what do you mean? She said you know… (‘cause it was a nice place) like those 50 year old men smoking cigars.  I said maybe a couple but they should keep to themselves.  She said good, the last thing I want is to worry about old men trying to hit on me.  I said no kidding, maybe I could look at a 50 year old man when I’m 50.  She said not me! When I’m 50 I’ll be looking at 30 y.o.’s  WHEW. I wanted to jump through the phone receiver and give her a hug. She is one of a few friends I have who can relate to where I am coming from.  Granted, it ISN’T exactly common.  Though I’ve always had younger men.  Even back over a decade ago, being with someone just 3 years younger was enormous to people and I got a lot of shit for it.  She’s a year younger than me and her husband is about 8 years younger than she is! So I asked her how she deals with the heat.  I am pretty sure they met when he was 21 and she 29 or something like that.  She said at first it was hard for her.  Then, her best friend’s mom told her you have to be true to whatever your life is, because that is what will make you happy.  So she backed it up.  And when people try to opinionate over her, she says you WISH you had someone younger, it’s better.   I was laughing so hard because it’s rare I can talk about that with someone I know.  It’s just not common.  I almost wondered for a moment…is this similar to how gay people felt/feel? Like they’d get so much shit from people because it’s not what everyone sees as normal (or, at least the way it used to be)?  All I know is that I am NOT attracted to older men at all.  My age is good if workable, and I get along better with younger men, I just do.  So that’s that.  I am not even going to think about dating older men anymore ‘cause it is not for me.

      I just looked up Miki Berenyi and found that we were born 3 years apart  to the exact day ... And she's under my skin! It's so weird...  I should say *spooky* hee hee...  Miki is amazing. When I was going through my closet the other day, I found some memorabilia. One of the things I found was a post card with her photo on it.  It had been folded and run over by a car - It had that ground-in asphalt damage to it. I scanned it and posted it up elsewhere.  Memories. A friend back then, what '94? ten years ago, took me to an "eat and greet" with her band, LUSH. She's pretty cool.  What's scary is I felt like I could relate to her energy I was listening to  Split  a couple days ago when I found the post card.  We're from different countries (London to LA), we've had different lives but I feel like she can feel me it's weird! Then to see we're born on the same day is just WEIRD.   LIGHT FROM A DEAD STAR   He lives his life in a world full of women  And he takes what he wants from their love  And he throws the rest away  I cling to him and pray  But still he slips away  And now it's just too late  To wish him back again  She won't put up with this life so she leaves him  And she finds someone else, falls in love  And she travels far away  I say that it's ok  And swallow all my pain  And now it's just too late  To wish her back again   They left me here on my own in a nightmare  And I just can't forgive any more  So I smile and turn away  Don't listen when they say  They wish that I could stay  And now it's just too late  To wish me back again   (Author: M. Berenyi)   *     *     *     *  The "eat and greet" was at Prince's LUNA PARK.  I'm fairly sure it belong(ed)s to Prince.  We were outside on this patio area and she saw my shoes and whispered to a friend of hers that she liked my shoes.  I'd bought them the summer before in London, ironically.  Made by a Brit designer... at Shelley's... Oh Katherine Hamnett. They look like Barbie's shoes, the doll.  That classic 50's pin up thing, but exactly like Barbie's shoes in black leather. I remember seeing what appeared to be track marks on her arm.  She just had this thing about her... I've been wanting to write about her all week ever since I found the post card and started pouring over the CDs...   I mean, she had GUTS, serious guts.  Not so much because of how scarce women musician still were back then and for how she'd step out and be different in her style but for other reasons too.  Her lyrics for her are deep dark and painful stuff and I'd read them and hear them and think how could she  show  this to people? She's got this song about being molested when she was 8 and it's like, kind of like weirdly shameful but then it's like she's giving her parents a slap in the face at the same time, what's stronger?  By the way she stands up there on stage and performs you can see in her face she just didn't give a f'ck what people might think.   They weren't exactly the tightest band to play live either BUT what is also so awesome about this is her having the guts to bare the criticism and pressure of f'cking up repeatedly in front of an audience and still moving forward.  That left a note in me, I recall when I see her CD's and whatever that she pushes forward no matter what's really going on, it helped and helps give me encouragement where otherwise there'd be none but my own I suppose.  I remember that particular night she was wearing a tank dress and she didn't shave her armpits (she's British who cares) and some guy said "show us your pits" and she thought he said ... you know... and he said it a few times. She finally said if you say that one more time I'm out of here!  mmmm.  I have pictures of that night when they played, I was just looking them over the other day... Just another strange occurance from My Mod Closet.  What's even creepier?! On our birthday in 1999 they've got a band interview @ the VH1 site... what's up with this and that?!!?  http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/512913/03171999/lush.jhtml  Other birthdays ('99): Charley Pride, 61; Wilson Pickett, 58; John Hartman (Doobie Brothers), 49; Bill Frisell, 48; Irene Cara, 40; Jeff LeBar (Cinderella), 36; Vanessa Williams, 36; Jerry Cantrell (Alice in Chains), 33; Queen Latifah, 29; Stuart Zender (Jamiroquai), 25; and Barry "B.J."

      more note... a positive note. Relay:  Hi Everyone,  Great news!  Thanks to all you letters and calls, the Assembly Health Committee passed both SB 1566 (School Nutrition Standards) and SJR 29 (Resolution on Marketing to Children) yesterday afternoon.   SB 1566, Senator Escutia's nutrition standards bill, passed on a 10-5 vote.  SB 1566 builds on SB 19 (Escutia - 2001) and SB 677 (Ortiz - 2003) by  establishing comprehensive nutrition standards for all foods K-12) and beverages (K-8) sold outside of the federal meal programs in all California public schools.   These standards would be implemented without an additional budget expenditure.   The food standards bill had to be compromised to eliminate the beverage standards in high school , but in return the soda and restaurant industries removed their opposition so that we could get the votes we needed to maintain the food standards for all schools K-12.  Next: SB 1566 now goes to the Assembly Education Committee next Wednesday June 23.  SJR 29, Senator Kuehl's marketing resolution also passed on a 12-5 vote.  SJR 29 is a resolution that calls on the federal government to put  reasonable limits on the marketing of foods and beverages to children and calls for the food, marketing, and media industries operating in California to voluntarily adhere to a code of practice for responsible food / beverage marketing to children.   Next: SJR 29 will go to the Assembly Floor after the summer recess.  More information on both the bill and the resolution can be found on our website at:   http://www.publichealthadvocacy.org/legislation/.  We will be back in touch with more information on next steps and important actions needed to help gain passage of SB 1566 and SJR 29. Thanks for all your continued support!   YAY...!

      What am I going to do.  Nothing I suppose. There really isn't anything TO do.  What I am going on over is contemplating my shakes seminar performance night next month. HMMMM. In addition to my scene & monologue, I will also be reciting a sonnet. Number NINETY-ONE. Hmm. OF course, in last night's course the instructor Special K was being strange once again. I will be moving on to a new group maybe sooner than later. Although for the fall theatre play it would be workable to get a role I'd like - 4 female roles, staged by the director I worked with last.  We got along well so I imagine that he would be inclined to work with me as I don't play the primadonna card.  Primadonna. Hmm. That reminds me. Sunday morning at about 330am or a little later I got a call, I am glad I slept through it.  It was from another guy who wanted to date me.  He was slurring into voicemail and his Cyrano-friend was telling him what to say.  Telling me to call him.  He's not my type, what do you WANT then?! I'm not going to lead someone on. That is wrong to him and me.  Why would someone bait someone else they don't want to truly invest in?  Just so weird... Primadonna.  Because he called me a primadonna once I had told him I was busy doing rehearsals.  Oh right, I am soooooo primadonna.  Those who know how hard I have had to work for everything in life would laugh to have heard that.  Back to the tracks.  Special K suggested that I sit on the said director's lap and recite my sonnet to him.  I said at that rate why don't I read to the head of the department? OR at that rate why don't I perform this Tom Jones style? Get me a mic, would you? I'll serenade every man in the audience, hand out roses, leave them feeling special.  I must have raked in some compliments or SOMETHING that I am unaware of for her to hand me so many slanted comments.  Nothing worse than having to filter conversation coming from your own instructor.  NOW back to the station, my starting point.  Sonnet No. Ninety-one.  How can I read this to a stranger? It's too beautiful and too real, too magical to read to a stranger! All sonnets addressing "thy" must be read personal, not impersonal.  SO I have to memorize and recite this to ...  no one as I have no one THAT SUCKS.  It seems so weird to focus on someone and read a deep sonnet and not have it be real, so now here's another thing I have to grapple with.  Love all over ... and over... and over....   SONNET No. NINETY-ONE  Some glory in their birth, some in their skill, Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force, Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill, Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse; And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure, Where in it finds a joy above the rest: But these particulars are not my measure; All these I better in one general best. Thy love is better than high birth to me, Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost, Of more delight than hawks or horses be; And having thee, of all men's pride I boast: Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take All this away and me most wretched make.  IT'S WAY TOO TRUE TO MY HEART to read this in err. hmm. What will I do? Only TIME can show me.  I know nothing. What is to be known of something that hasn't yet happened? Nothing, that is why it hasn't happened yet. A beautiful blank canvas, for love.  *     *    *     *   Love Song For No One   *   *   *   *   For Love    Miki Berenyi is a sparkly star.

      Lewdicrous. What is GOING ON. ew. At least now I am laughing. Driving home from work yesterday, which isn't much of a commute at all, uh, some guy decided that he wanted to put on a special performance for me, if you know what I mean.   I won't educate anyone and explain HOW I managed to get to see his "performance" but, ew! My first reaction was to lock my car doors and then I thought of calling the police. Eh, I barely saw what he was doing for a moment, but it was enough to make me turn away. THEN I thought of european people I know and what they'd do if they saw this display.  They'd exhale in annoyed disgust, say he's crazy, or laugh.  That's all. So, even though it took a few moments, I decided to laugh it off and not care.  THEN I got an email this morning from some guy who tried to date me a year ago, out of the blue.  It was insanely lewd as well! Right up there with the performance man from yesterday! We're not friends.  We talked for a short while and I decided I didn't want to date him because he wasn't my type. Maybe we had exchanged a letter once in the past year?  HE'S 40 also. Ironic isn't it. With me and my previous gripes. WTF! Gross. I figured these guys want attention, obviously.  And likely they think that they can't gain anything from me on an even level, so why deal at all. Message deleted.  I am just hoping that this freak-phase has now passed.  No more performances, please.  Not the way to hold a lady's attention.  It is stupid and crazy if you think about it.  No fuel for you...!

      Or, I just feel no impetus for reading my scenework homework re. Amalfi. I am a bad girl-woman.  I haven't read it yet and I should have made major headway by now.  BUT, I am a good girl-woman. I stepped up to it and I began taking iron supplements as of yesterday. *curtsies*  I blame my skewed self specifically on my feminineAHEMbiology.   I suffer a few days out of the month.  A small price to pay to be me.   All the other miseries I gladly accept with minor whining side affects.  I fell in love with a picture in the LA Weekly. It was a newsprint ad for an indie film called,  THE STORY OF THE WEEPING CAMEL.  That camel face, so beautiful. I want to see this movie because the camel has a beautiful face. BUT, it sounds like a super sad movie.   With a happy ending. I need a proper shoulder to accompany me to such a movie. I have 2, but leaning on them isn't quite the same.  It's supposed to be a documentary on a white baby camel that was rejected  by its mother at birth and the white baby camel wouldn't stop crying.  So the people in this town (argh I forgot which one) search for these certain musicians in hopes that the music can lull the 2 back together. Supposedly it DOES work and when the momma camel sees her baby and realizes what is going on, She cries camel tears.  FOR REAL.  I am  not  joking.  Maybe I should see it alone because I will probably cry... That's TOO touching.  There is ONE movie that I know of that EVERY time I see it, doesn't matter what year or when or any circumstances, when I see the ending I CRY MY FREAKING HEAD OFF. Tired of guessing? (as I write this to myself, hoo hoo hooooo)  A Little Romance.  When Lauren and ... the little French boy say good-bye and she has to go and they're playing that Georges Delerue (sp?) music and he's running after her in the car... I turn into a little white baby camel!  Yes.  No fail.  Need to see tears, show me that clip. Hey next time I need to get in touch with sadness for scenework I should get that video out.  *  *  *  *  I was reading this piece a young girl wrote on dating and her experience on meeting men.  She's the pursuer.  It was interesting.  I can barely handle dealing with what comes to me much less considering pursuing someone and going through all that work.   DAMN I AM CRAVING A GARDENBURGER something fierce! anyways, I was reading about how witty and cute she is, yes charming, but even in her story I could see the inherent lack of strategy men thrive on when they've got the situation geared and calculated.  I'd much rather focus on dealing with men based on their approaches effectively. I find that I often have to be discouraging or they get too up in my business then I get crowded.  But even then that approach sometimes poses as a lure to some men so, it's work just trying to create alone space. AND, in conclusion, I am who I have always been. Despite my deep curiosity as to if there was something out there that I may be missing out on, no.  I am and always will be a thorough monogamous, tunnel-vision-impared, loyal-till-I-vomit-not-a-sucker-nor-willing-to-engage-with-someone-who-plays-me-for-the-sucker-either, kind of significant other girlfriend who aspires to be something more now that I am in the 30's pool.  I remember YEARS ago, maybe even a decade ago, when that tv show "Thirty-Somethings" came out it made me feel gross.  I thought 30 was so old, especially because the representation of 30 as it were is relatively lifeless.  I don't like the way people who stagnate think, their energy is flat.  And to totally contradict myself, I want to settle so bad!! But it's different.  I want to lock-in and build with the right guy so that I can focus on all the other aspects of life that shift.    Here's a test for whoever reads this.  Try shopping ONLY in health/whole/natural foods stores only for awhile, like a month or 2, like me.  THEN go into any major chain store.  Look around you.  Then tell me what you see.  I went to a major chain store earlier. And I have been committed to my organics/health kick for about 2 months now and I've avoided the major shops, and YIKES people eat a looooooot of scary stuff.  People are  suffering  and they can't see.  Because it's easy to package and make convenient low quality foods for masses to eat.  What they make seem high quality in comparison isn't even CLOSE.  If the people in power know to avoid what the masses have, the masses become sluggish and weak while the people who avoid this, if handled correctly, can thrive.  When will people learn.  Just because you can't see things within 1 to 2 degrees doesn't mean the ripple effect isn't coming back toward you in the pool. It is, you're just not within view of the math.  Give like - get like.  EVERYONE is affected, you cannot hide in a panic room, you cannot hide anywhere, it's called life.

      Attention staff!   The 5.1 San Ysidro earthquake did occur at 3:28 p.m.  The Cal Tech system also recorded an earthquake in Agoura Hills. Both the Agoura Hills and Lancaster earthquakes are "false readings" from the computers.

      I'm full of it today. babble. I got my haircut a few days ago. I love my hairstylist.  She's an Armenian Shakira-looking chick. I like her demeanor, she's very laid back but something about her is solid.  French people are like this. She's moving shop in a few months, she plans on getting her own salon.   I think that's cool.   I said what, are you going to name it after yourself?  She said NO! That is cheesy.   I said there's nothing cheesy about your name!  She said well everywhere you go every shop has someone's name on a corner,  I don't like it.  My shop will be called "Cheveux du Soie" meaning "Hair of Silk".   oooh laa laa!   No joking though... when I met her I bleached out my black hair to go deep brown and I fried it, and over the past year and a half she helped me do these intense conditioning treatments and she'd cut as much away as she could without making me shave my head or something drastic like that.  But when I hear 'silk' and 'french' together, I think of the Matrix Reloaded:   I love French wine, like I love the French language. I have sampled every language, French is my favorite. Fantastic language. Especially to curse with. Nom de dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperie de connard d'enculé de ta mère.  It's like wiping your arse with silk.  I love it.

      I believe in desperate acts. The kind that make me look stupid. (Look like a fool.) Just keep reinventing myself. It's move or die. (I change my form.) These days the people I love are spread so far apart. (All out of reach.) It's a thin sheet across the face. (Cover me now.)  That's pretty old. I never felt like this before. I say that every hour.  It's never going to be like it could have been. Now it's just this room. (Window looks back.) You're a big part of it. But I don't care. (You take the lead.) And can you really see me now like I made me? (Made me anew.) Just like anyone else. (Safer alone.)  That's pretty old. I never felt like this before. I say that every hour.  So right, so wrong. Another winter's coming on. You win, you lose. It's the same old news.  These things go wrong so often. Pick up the phone and punch your home code. Somewhere, sometime let me make you mine.  Lean your head on mine like you used to. (Used to your lean.) I don't mind if you're faking it. (Make it seem real.) I'm not asking the questions. I'm not demanding the answers now. (Take what you give.) Right or wrong, just take me, lead me on. I'm going.  So right, so wrong. Another winter's coming on. You win, you lose. It's the same old news.  These things go wrong so often. Pick up the phone and punch your home code. Somewhere, sometime let me make you mine.

      You're not punk, and I'm telling everyone. Save your breath, I never was one. You don't know what I'm all about. Like killing cops and reading Kerouac.  My enemies are all too familiar. They're the ones who used to call me friend. I'm coloring outside your guidelines. I was passing out when you were passing our your rules. One. Two. Three. Four.  Who's punk what's the score?  Got a friend. Her name is Boxcar. Cigarettes and beer in El Sob. Her hair was blue, now it's green. I like her mind. She hates the scene.  My enemies are all too familiar. They're the ones who used to call me friend. I'm coloring outside your guidelines. I was passing out when you were passing our your rules. One. Two. Three. Four.  Who's punk what's the score?

      Just a speck of cathartic venting here.  Just a speck of dirt.    The person heading this seminar I am in, I'll call her K, well, she's difficult.  She's wired so strangely.  She's of an old-school-director-dictator-mentality.  So, as far as education and discourse and literature (Shakes was known moreso as a poet than a playwright in the past, so I am told) - it's been a rough ride in this seminar.  She certainly has NOTHING to do with what I've known of education in lit in the past.  She's been super hyper about imposing her opinion, heavily, both over the material and ME. More specifically, that I should be more focused toward the age of 40 (!) and focusing on older woman roles.  Last February she'd given me an interesting role for this seminar, the role of a young girl, but took it away after certain gossip broke out that I dated someone younger! That is why she wants me to focus on older roles, on playing the role of the queen. AND my scene work is with an older guy and conveniently the scene is me persuading him to marry me. Everything reeeeeaks of her opinions, SHE reaks of her opinions.  I have to listen to all this muck about how she's so secure with her age (if she were there'd be no mention of it) and blah blah blah and after being bombarded with her opinion directed right at me over and over - now I question what I am paying for.  I don't WANT to do the scene work. The scene is retarded, and my scene partner's girlfriend is the secretary here at my work.  I am sure she'll love to find out I am rehearsing seducing her boyfriend and that I have to kiss him.  And, why isn't HE saying anything about it? It's weird.  I guess they must have an understanding.  I don't want her to freak since she KNOWS me, which throws a kink into the whole illusion of what is on the stage.     Well now this becomes an opportunity to prove her tactics weak.  I should then thrive off of handling the situation most effectively instead of turning away.     I wanted to say, "I'll tell you what, when you stop sleeping with your dog whose the size of a small person, then I might consider listening."  But instead I just smiled.

      HAa haa ha aha haaaaaaaaa. Okay. Just because I can be a goof sometimes. So, My cat, Edith, I make up new pet names for her here and there.  I mean, after almost 13 years together, you've just gotta do that sort of thing.  So not long ago I started calling her rabbit.  I thought she sort of looked like a rabbit in a weird way.  Then, I decided she was too big to be a rabbit.  SO, I started calling her Rabbititis, as in, inflammation of the rabbit.  (Rabbit-itis).  Then, I started calling her 'titus for short.  Titus.  Then, I thought Titus wasn't enough, so I call her Titus love bone.  That makes NO sense at all.  So patient! haa haa haaaaaaa.

      ... choice tea for this evening - mixing Mango Ceylon with Green in my diffuser.  Just when I thought I was feeling good... my muscles are again aching like a MF'ker.  Maybe it's from my iron deficiency and my strange unwillingness to take iron supplement tablets.  I bought iron supplement tablets... bought 2 bottles of them.  I keep one in my office, I keep one at home.  Haven't taken even one.  Ouch, my muscles ache.  Hot baths help. Otherwise, I just don't care to move beyond that with it.   Reminds me of Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan Ilych," where Ivan keeps feeling pain but he ignores it and continues forward... prompting the reader to at least SORT OF question why he'd ignore his pain.   eh... it's (the story) really just a beautiful still-life-with-words of existance... and a good portion of it is 'survival of the fittest' - if you're fit enough to survive and excel, it really shows where you land on the ladder of life.   As for me, it's probably some chick-hormonal-growth-age issue I don't pay any attention to. I tend to be in a decent system of check with myself so I know when I should step up for something unbearable.  Nothing's ever really bad, it just may form you in a way you're uncertain.  OKAY enough ambiguities.  I had fun last night. I was so happy to see my friends.  And I was very happy to see that Agent -0- and his band have grown a LOT, they're really getting better and better.  Awh. One of the sweetest most sincere and caring persons I have EVER met.  He's funny, he's super kind and nice and sensitive but he acts tough around most people, but he treats me nice.  Who knows what he's thinking.  I just get a sense that some day soon he's going to flourish in amazing ways he may not even be certain of yet.  I really want to see him do well.   Choice drink of the evening:  Stella Artois. The place was actually crowded.  Hard to see the stage. Boys walking around smelling like bar soap, it's really nice.  Either that or it's cologne that smells like bar soap.  People all clean and shiney and cute and happy.    I don't drink much these days.  Drinking forces you to loosen up whether you THINK you want to or not. So, in that sense, I think in mod. it's good for any adult really.  I wish my pal Josh wouldn't have been so sXe and he refused to drink at all.  I mean, for the most part I respect being clean but it seems to do one good to just let go here and there.  He was overwound with control to a point where it wasn't even good for him, and his negative qualities then had too much control over parts of him.  Ya, he'd have done better with a few beers.  I stopped keeping in touch with him around the same time J & I broke up.  Just a gut feeling.  I let go of a few people, actually.  I don't know why but I just knew.  So ya, everyone clean happy smelling pretty shiney etc.  Once I got into a zone after a couple drinks I started paying attention to people beyond just the general - everyone smells nice and looks nice.  I never realize that guys watch me! I think that's funny.  I don't feel that the realization that it happens should or could lead to anything for me to consider because - #1, most of my life I've already had a boyfriend so what would have been the point of paying attention, and #2, people just do stare at other people, doesn't really mean anything in particular.   I also don't really think much about how many people really know who I am socially.  I always think I'm in my own world in my head, but then I see people trying to edge near me and that sort of hesitant struggle with talking to me.  Some do approach me, some don't.  One girl came up and reintro'd herself.  I'd met her when she was younger in her teens.  So she mentioned people I know and then asked me to come to her club.  She's a nice gurl.  Dunno.  What other drivvel can I get rid of on this sheet of monotony? I can write for HOURS about all kinds of thoughts, meaningful and meaningless.  I am cleaning out my closet ...s ... Like really.  Funny. I guess emotionally I have done some cleaning out too but my bigger closet in my apartment is where I keep things I love collecting... I have BOXES of books, vintage clothing and handbags, and other memorabilia.  Most of it is really valuable.  I usually buy stuff with a good knack that gains value.  Odd and interesting stuff. But anyways... I was going through some old books, looking for a couple exist. pieces and I found a book I hadn't seen in awhile... with a note from an old boyfriend... I think he put it in there and I never saw it! BECAUSE he used to leave me little messages on corner scraps of paper and I'd collect them and put them in a folder.  They weren't just messages though...  Matt. I met him in Adv. poetry class in college.  He was one of the most talented writers that I had met.  Instructors on campus deemed him a genius.  Oh he was alright.  He'd cracked when he was 16, had to be institutionalized. But he healed up I think.  He was fine.  He was just creatively profound.  SO talented.  And he'd write me poems all the time and draw little pictures, his own art characters.  Stuff like that. That was what was cool about having a talented writer bf, all the poems and art and songs he wrote about me and us, it makes for a great memory.  SO I found a note in a book I know I haven't looked at in many years... I may have never seen the note. It says...   (T),   The roll of movements ... still ours ... Like still-time photographs Each trapped, Losing a little of it's life Due to gravity The heavy lines of the Picture slip into Stasis, ...time to become. True, the times we've  Wanted to slip Into have been Waiting for us.  - in us -     Ironically, the same day I'd found this note was the same day my brother went with his girlfriend and her band to play with this other band... whose drummer was a mutual friend of mine and Matt's AND Matt and his twin were at the show.  My brother mentioned it to me the next day.  Small world, eh.  Getting smaller all the time ;)  I think life was better not just for me but everyone when people struggle more, work harder, write manually.  But nothing's ever so horrible because something comes of everything.  See? I can write about anything over and over, so I'll stop for now on a high. wink wink!

      I don't know WHY I feel I get so much out of listening to   The Postal Service  lately, but I do. And when I hear "The District Sleeps Alone Tonight," I always focus in on the clearest part, at the end, where he keeps repeating "I am finally seeing, that I was the one worth leaving."  So I looked up the lyrics to get what the rest of the story was... NICE. Right on. Two thumbs up. Suppose much can be said of perspective and THE PRESENTATION given by those leaving and who's worth what...    THE DISTRICT SLEEPS ALONE TONIGHT   smeared black ink: your palms are sweaty and I'm barely listening to last demands i'm staring at the asphalt wondering what's buried underneath where i am  i'll wear my badge: a vinyl sticker with big block letters adherent to my chest that tells your new friends i am a visitor here: i am not permanent and the only thing keeping me dry is where i am  you seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex a stranger with a door key explaining that i am just visiting and i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leaving  d.c. sleeps alone tonight  you seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex a stranger with a door key explaining that i am just visiting and i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leaving the district sleeps alone tonight after the bars turn out their lights and send the autos swerving into the loneliest evening and i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leaving  *     *     *     *  This is beautiful.  There is something to be said about being with someone... a post realization that they could say they're leaving when they never really HAD you there with them as it was - if you were treated as a visitor, and they're acting the part of the stranger.  "The only thing keeping me dry is where I am" - what an interesting way to say how sad someone's behavior could make you feel.  As if, had they not been there with the new friends, there'd be crying.  Hmm.  "You seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex" - is this because the person out of context is acting higher... than... thou?  People can be so strange and so blind.  And rarely do they REALLY treat others the way they want to be treated.  People can be so quick to exemplify what they don't like, they can thoughtlessly regurgitate the things they don't like that they've taken in, but can they make enough of a  sacrifice  not to?  Can they?  Is it fear? Some sort of defense mechanism? Or, are people just too different? It seems that younger people can flex and mold easier.  Maybe it's because as you gain experience the probabilities in your mind change.  I never put the words clearly to the song.  I just like listening to the melody when I'm driving along.   Then when he's hooking "I was the one worth leaving" so loud over everything else, I thought is this was some sort of dejected statement he was making. But no.  Sometimes when standards don't suit they break.  Why do people tend to take that break as negative?  Isn't the Chinese symbol for disaster the same as opportunity?  Is it all in how  you  view it?  The person here being 'left' is WORTH MORE than the one doing the leaving. Excellent. Everytime situations form poorly around me they break, but then I find myself in a higher and better place afterwards.  It's only when I try to believe I should be somewhere else that others think I should be that I get confused.   I should just shut up and ride more silently along on the wave of life...  Kind of like this:   Good Riddance  / Greenday, of course  Another turning point A fork stuck in the road Time grabs you by the wrist Directs you where to go So make the best of this test And don't ask why It's not a question but a Lesson learned in time It's something unpredictable But in the end is right I hope you had the time of your life  So take the photographs  And still frames in your mind And hang it on a shelf In good health and good time Tattoos of memories  And dead skin on trial For what it's worth It was worth all the while It's something unpredictable But in the end is right I hope you had the time of your life   *    *     *     *  I'm off in a bit with Amelia to the east side.  Agent -0- will be performing and I am finally feeling better after almost 2 weeks of a strong cold! ...The kind of cold that attacks your muscles too and makes you want to sleep and sleep and sleep.  The district sleeps alone tonight...

      titled somewhat facetiously...  I am not feeling great but I am better than I was doing the past 2 days.  I HAVE to go see my friend's band tomorrow, I haven't seen them perform in months! I feel awful.  I edit the lead's comic book work! Talented bunch they are. And sweet as heck!  *****   PROGRESS REPORT   Name:  bully  Grade:  NTI (needs to improve)  Comment:  the bully mentioned in my entry 2 weeks ago is in my Shakes seminar.  I am convinced he was ON something when he was harrassing me and others 2 weeks ago, for GODS sake I don't even know him and he tried to forcibly keep me from closing my car door! freeeek.   He avoided coming into the group until the very last minute.  And, during the whole 4-hour seminar he kept his eyes mostly on the floor, he kept quiet.  I had decided if he was at all beligerant toward me at this seminar I'd reduce him however I saw fit, hopefully nothing will come to that.  He did look a bit ashamed, but when I left I turned around to say bye to someone and I saw him staring at me with the weirdest, grossest smile.  Of course, I might be biased.  He may now look GROSS through my eyes after what he'd managed to accomplish in his first impression just 2 weeks back.  I'd rather he not be in that course, but like with everything else in life, I will deal.  My weakness.  CHOCOLATE.  It's under control, but I can't seem to get over it! I eat like 1 or 2 chocolate bars a week.  A small vice at a small price. My newest choco bar is  DAGOBA -organic chocolate (I wrote 'chololate'... Is that like a Mexican coffee dessert?)  It says on the wrapper mint~rosemary ... rustic grown organic dark chocolate infused with mint and a hint of rosemary essence.  Cacao content: 59% Theobroma - food of the gods Dagoba - temple of the gods Chocolate is sacred. There is an art to the alchemy of flavor infusion, as art we explore with mystery and integrity. It is your birthright to eat organically grown foods.  WELL HOT DAMN isn't that a hefty statement for a chocolate wrapper... and to think I'd been so committed to scholarly readings, missing out on wrappers and such.  Also,  "You can deprive the body, but the soul needs chocolate."  Is that right? Am I having a soulful moment ... with this ... chocolate?  Ingredients - Organic Dark Chocolate (OG cacao beans, OG evaporated cane juice, OG cacao butter, 0.5% non-GMO soy lecithin) OG Peppermint, OG Rosemary and of course LOVE.  Hot Damn I say. Ok, I have real work awaiting me... even though almost everyone in the office is STILL out on their lunch break...

       just another cute email to remember...   A farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do.    Finally, he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey. He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him.  They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well.    At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well. He was astonished at what he saw.   With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.   As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and happily trotted off!   Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping-stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up.   Remember the five simple rules to be happy:    1. Free your heart from hatred - Forgive.    2. Free your mind from worries - Most never happen.   3. Live simply and appreciate what you have.   4. Give more.    5. Expect less   NOW,   Enough of that crap . . . The donkey later came back and bit the shit out of the farmer who had tried to bury him. The gash from the bite got infected, and the farmer eventually died in agony from septic shock.   MORAL FROM TODAY'S LESSON:    When you do something wrong and try to cover your ass, it always comes back to bite you.

      So glad... I just realized but within the hour that I am turning into a workaholic machine lately.  I think I've become this because of my disillusionment with recent past romances... the last couple of attempts were just wrong for me and yet I want things to work so I find myself in an odd place.  So, to keep my mind elsewhere I work, work, work.  I read, I study... on an average day 15 or 16 hours.  Then a pal wrote me and said she'd been slacking... her friend ate her blue eyeliner and in a drunken blur she wrote MOMMY on his forehead in sharpie marker... and I realized  that's  what's missing.  Some good old fashioned debauchery with trusted company! I hope to lose myself soon if even for a little while.  That's how things usually are with my trusty boyfriend but the position is currently available, nothing suitable in sight.  Not to mention I am too burned out to make any decisions as well. Hmm.  I was listening to one of my Billy CHILDISH demo cds yesterday (not to be confused with the other Billy!) and it made me nostalgic for company... you know, people you can get happily stupid with, not stupid like burn the house down but dumb happy... yes that's it, the dumb happy folks... All this learning is leaving me rigid.  All work and little play makes... whack.  But @*&#, I am lucky at what I've already accomplished in this heated run of mine!!

      Just look at this small segment from Hamlet and see why I love thee Billy Shakes!! Dialogue between father and son, Lord Polonius and Laertes respectively:  Polonius Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame! The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay'd for. There,--my blessing with thee!  [Laying his hand on Laertes's head.]  And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character.  Give thy thoughts no tongue , Nor any unproportion'd thought his act. (this is interesting! this makes me thoughtful...) Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in, Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice: Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy: For the apparel oft proclaims the man; And they in France of the best rank and station Are most select and generous chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be: For loan oft loses both itself and friend; And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all,-- to thine own self be true ; And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!  Laertes Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.  Polonius The time invites you; go, your servants tend.  *********** So his son's about to take off for another country, his dad prays over him before he leaves and gives him his best advice, so ... hot.  OKAY enough of me today until another day when I am more organized, less scatter-brained.  MUAH .

      AUGH! So... I have this friend in Portland, Maine.  We decided a couple months ago that we were going to start a band.  She is the FIRST person I have met EVER who has the right, inventive lean for creativity to make amazing music.  I won't expose to anyone what our scheme is until we're pressed in vinyl or burned into a disc... but, it could very well make a whole new wave in the music scene. NEW. Yes...   Sadly, this morning I heard on the radio that one of my favorite bands beat us to the punch with an element that was part of what I thought to be an original idea!!! Since she's at the opposite end of the US, I said let's use cassettes and we'll send them back and forth in the mail! She said she loved that idea.  But this morning I heard that THE POSTAL SERVICE got their name from doing just that! Awh damn.  These 2 guys are located in Silverlake (small world!) and Seattle, Wa.  Seattle, Portland... See?! We're destined for greatness already. ;) We're the female to the male reflection.   urlLink http://www.subpop.com/bands/postalservice/images/album_big.gif    The Postal Service * Such Great Heights     I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned and I have to speculate that God himself did make us into corresponding shapes like puzzle pieces from the clay true, it may seem like a stretch, but its thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you're away when I am missing you to death when you are out there on the road for several weeks of shows and when you scan the radio, I hope this song will guide you home  they will see us waving from such great heights, "come down now," they'll say but everything looks perfect from far away, "come down now," but we'll stay...  I tried my best to leave this all on your machine but the persistent beat it sounded thin upon listening that frankly will not fly. you will hear the shrillest highs and lowest lows with the windows down when this is guiding you home

      Roberts, Katherine. “The Wandering Womb: Classical Medical Theory and the Formation of Female Characters in Hamlet.” Classical and Modern Literature: A Quarterly 15 (1995): 223-32.   FEMINISM / GERTRUDE / NEW HISTORICISM / OPHELIA  This essay approaches wombsickness (a.k.a. hysteria) as a “condition, described early in patriarchal Western culture, [which] has been a literary motif from classical to modern literature” (223). Evidence spanning from Greek medical theories to the doctrines of sixteenth-century physicians testifies to the belief that the female womb has physiological needs (e.g., sexual intercourse); left unmet, these demands result in hysteria. Simultaneously, stringent social codes of the Renaissance restricted female sexuality. A patriarchal culture defined women—socially and medically—by their relationships to men. Ophelia and Gertrude suffer classic symptoms of wombsickness. As a young girl of marriageable age and emotional instability, Ophelia is a prime candidate for wombsickness. She has been mentally and physically preparing herself for marriage/sex with Hamlet; but in the loss of all male figures to guide and support her, Ophelia becomes “completely vulnerable to her own femaleness” (229). Gertrude also suffers symptoms of hysteria, according to Hamlet’s account of “a woman whose physiology apparently required frequent intercourse” (230). In the absence of her original husband to sate and govern her sexual energies, Gertrude is easily seduced, and her disorderly behavior damages the society. As “her natural guardian,” Hamlet must intervene to “constrain her”—hence the closet scene (231). While Gertrude properly responds to his chastising by transferring her allegiance from Claudius to Hamlet, and in a sense recovering from her wombsickness, it is too late to prevent the destruction of the throne’s inhabitants. This article makes no definitive claims about Shakespeare’s intentions but notes that Renaissance literature “reflects and reinforces” previously developed concepts of women, bringing “those concepts into the twentieth century” (232).

      As I invest deeper into Ham1et to understand the Queen and her Willow speech, I have learned SO much... I feel almost overwhelmed at the thought of attempting to write it all down.  I can write some of it.  Supposedly dating way back into the times of the (ancient) Greeks, they determined if a woman is "not satisfied" that she suffers from what was then called "wombsickness", also known as hysteria?! An unsatisfied woman thoughout history has been found to be perceived as physiologically affected to the point of hysteria... or as a modern male might refer to it as, she's crazy. Well then, you're  lacking  .  Simple as that.   Crazy women = a sign of insufficient men. Sad.  I should reprint what I found but I don't have it with me at the moment. There was an article written in regards to this "wombsickess" as it relates to the behaviors of both Queen Gertrude and Ophelia.    I didn't agree with half of what I'd read in critial readings of the Willow speech.  Some information was interesting, some I thought lacked sufficient thought. I noticed independently in my own critical view of the speech some interesting points.  One thing being, why does she digress to mention that "long purples" are that which "liberall shepheards give a grosser name, but our cold maids doe Dead Men's Fingers call them".  Why bother this mention? Notice she isn't using a term that either a liberall shepheard would use NOR a cold maid.  I take that to read she is neither liberall nor cold...  she is neither guilty nor innocent...!   I would like to find that someone else has recognized this parallel. While Ophelia was floating she was chaunting snatches of old tunes - again the Queen  digresses to say Ophelia was "as one incapable of her own distress, or like a creature Native and indued unto that element." Is this the Queen's opinion of Ophelia's position? That Ophelia was incapable of her own distress, all the trauma she was overwhelmed with? and how is that much different than being a creature native and indue unto any element? If you are so a part of an element, how can you see differently? As in, the element around her was so chaotic, she too became chaos?  Hmm.     ENTER QUEEN One woe doth tred upon another heele, So fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd Laertes.  LAERTES:  Drown'd! O where?  2.2.2351-2368  QUEEN: There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke, That shewes his hore leaves in the glassie streame: There with fantasticke Garlands did she come, Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples, That liberall Shepheards give a grosser name; But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them: There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds Clambring to hang; an envious sliver broke, when downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe, Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide, And Mermaid-like, a while they bore her up, Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes, As one incapable of her owne distresse, Or like a creature Native, and indued Unto that Element: but long it could not be, Till that her garments, heavy with her drinke, Pul'd the poore wretch from her melodious (buoy), To muddy death.

      Brief Candles - the Zombies  There she sits her hands are held Tight around her glass She only needs to be alone She knows this mood will pass To realize that she was strong And he too weak to stay And to realize that she is better off this way  Brief candles in her mind Bright and tiny gems of memory Brief candles burn so fine Leaves a light inside where she can see What makes it all worthwhile Her sadness makes her smile...  His alone girl fades away Left out on a limb Finds he needs her more because She's no more need for him He understood so very well The things she had to say Soon he'll understand that he is better off this way  Brief candles in his mind Bright and tiny gems of memory Brief candles burn so fine Leaves a light inside where he can see What makes it all worthwhile His sadness makes him smile...  In the corner see his face The man just sips his drink Not one feeling does he show  Far too numb to think He does not say a single word No word of love to say Maybe he will soon believe he's better off this way...  Brief candles in his mind Bright and tiny gems of memory Brief candles burn so fine Leaves a light inside where he can see What makes it all worthwhile His sadness makes him smile...

      Sugar and alcohol basic food groups for many adults - Kim Severson, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, June 2, 2004  http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/06/02/MNG0U6V4S436.DTL     Junk food, sugary drinks and beer make up nearly one-third of the calories adult Americans consume daily, according to a UC Berkeley study released Tuesday.   "We knew it was bad, but we didn't know it was this bad," said Gladys Block, a professor of epidemiology and public health nutrition at the university. "It's no wonder there's an obesity epidemic in this country."   Her findings, the most recent and comprehensive look at what the nation eats based on caloric intake, show that three types of foods -- sweets and desserts; soft drinks; and alcoholic beverages -- make up almost 25 percent of all calories.   Salty snacks and fruit-flavored drinks make up an additional 5 percent, bringing the energy contributed by nutritionally deficient foods to about 30 percent of the calories adults eat every day, the study shows.   By comparison, healthier foods such as fruits and vegetables make up only 10 percent of the caloric intake in the U.S. diet. Depending on body size and exercise level, women should consume an average of about 2,000 calories a day and men 2,500 calories.   Soft drinks and pastries led the top 10 foods contributing the most calories to the American diet. Sodas alone contributed 7.1 percent of the total calories in the U.S. population. Foods such as hamburgers, pizza and potato chips rounded out the top five food items. Beer came in ninth on the list, just ahead of french fries and fried potatoes.   The study, published in the June issue of the Journal of Food Chemistry and Analysis, comes as the U.S. Department of Agriculture is reworking the food guide pyramid. This fall, the federal government will issue a new set of dietary guidelines intended to limit fat, salt, alcohol and soda consumption and urging Americans to eat a healthier mix of foods based on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat milk products and lean meats, fish or meat alternatives.   Most Americans' diets are far from those recommendations, said Block, who based her study on the eating habits of 4,760 adults who took part in one of the nation's largest health studies, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.   Participants were asked to report all the foods they ate in a 24-hour period. The study, based on diets from 1999 to 2000, doesn't include people younger than 18, who have even worse diets than adults, according to Block and other nutritionists.   "If I was to look separately at teenagers and young adults, it would be much worse," she said. "I really shudder to think what our national health situation is going to be 20 or 30 years from now when the young generation who is really living on this diet gets older."   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which used data from the same comprehensive survey, an estimated 64 percent of U.S. adults are either overweight or obese. About 15 percent of children are overweight, and 40 percent more are considered unfit.   Harold Goldstein, executive director of the California Center for Public Health Advocacy in Sacramento, said the fact that Americans consume so much junk food, soda and beer was alarming but not a surprise.   "Those are exactly the products the food industry advertises the most. My hope is this kind of information will not only change individual behavior but inform public policy. The obesity epidemic isn't only about personal choices, it's about all the advertising the food industry aims at our children."   The UC Berkeley study highlights another disturbing undercurrent to the nation's obesity crisis: Although two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese, many of them are malnourished, Block said.   "Obviously, we need to worry about weight, but we also need to realize that people are eating a huge amount of food that has no useful micronutrients like vitamins and minerals," Block said. "The message isn't to eat less, but to eat differently."   E-mail Kim Severson at kseverson@sfchronicle.com.

Whatever happened to the days of old when at least one parent sat you down and made sure you ate a 'balanced' meal? But parents these days don't do any of these things on average it seems. Hmm.

      Wanna see the monologue for my Shakespeare seminar? :) I have scene study from John Webster's  The Dutchess of Malfi , and my monologue is from none other than Billy Shake's  Hamlet , as Queen Gertrude 'There is a Willow...':  ENTER QUEEN      One woe doth tred upon another heele,      So fast they'l follow:  your Sister's drown'd Laertes.  LAERTES:       Drown'd! O where?  2.2.2351-2368  QUEEN: There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke, That shewes his hore leaves in the glassie streame: There with fantasticke Garlands did she come, Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples, That liberall Shepheards give a grosser name; But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them: There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds Clambring to hang; an envious sliver broke, when downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe, Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide, And Mermaid-like, a while they bore her up, Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes, As one incapable of her owne distresse, Or like a creature Native, and indued Unto that Element:  but long it could not be, Till that her garments, heavy with her drinke, Pul'd the poore wretch from her melodious (buoy), To muddy death.  Oh ya.  You should see all the artwork made around this description of Ophelia's death.  I printed some off the internet to use as a cover for my Shakespeare summer folder. Eugene Delacroix is good...  The Dutchess piece is too long for me to type up right now, I'll take a stab at that in another entry... it's a LOOOOOOONG scene...

      OMG I just wrote a long entry and the whole thing erased. That feels whack.  Trying to repeat a stream of consciousness, trite.  Oh well. Let's see...  It's Tuesday the first of June! The year almost half over. Saturday night was the final run of the play.  Everyone told me I did well.  I am being hard on myself because I want people to feel MOVED.  Well isn't good enough.  I like that lifted sensation you get when you're really in that moment of being entertained.  That's what I am striving for.   GODDAMN I am hungry right now... Said adieu & thank you to my stage husband of 2 months.  It was fun/funny kissing someone so much who was your friend, then pretending you're really married.  Especially when this friend is 19 looking 17. To me anyway! My brother said we were believable and that he said our characters just looked 20-something.  So it worked.  I was worried that people would figure me out and realize I am not 20.  Nothing worse than watching people act and NOT believing their characters...  PHO noodles sound so good right now, and it's only 10:20am... hmm... The after-party went fine until a loser bully showed up. Mental.  Everyone was happy and getting along fine and the vibe was fine, then you'd think this guy was a 6-year-old getting ready to ravage a pack of kindergarteners surrounding a milk cart at recess, yes that bad.   My post-guess was that he was on something like PCP 'cause even speed freaks aren't that freaky.  His rage and blind hatred toward people he didn't even know was so insane I decided to leave, took a couple people home.  That's when I decided he was on drugs and just irrational.  What's worse is he was fixated on me in a "romantic" (there's got to be a better word since nothing about it is romantic) sense and scarily will be in my Shakespeare seminar group.  Lunatic.  I like nice people, boo! Bully go home...  I laugh because I am writing this to myself. I've only told one person about my blog, so it's just an open tool right now...  I lost about 5" off my waistline.  I changed my diet for the play and I am pretty happy with the results! It was one of my new year's resolutions to seriously convert to a healthy diet and I am on the right path. I've changed almost everything I eat.  AND one of my many summer projects is to experiment with Macrobiotics, which leans heavy on Chinese foods... we shall see...  And now... for a CHOCOLOVE moment. One of the food changes is not eating foods you get in regular markets. I'm leaning heavy on organics & whole foods.  I don't even take in regular chocolate because your average chocolate bar has milk/lactose and so I buy the import chocolate bars that are mostly cocoa. i.e. cocoa liquor, sugar, cocoa butter, lecithin, vanilla were the ingredients in my last chocolove experience.  Costs a little bit more but after 2 months of this change I feel awesomer!  CHOCOLOVE is one of these dairy free bars, and to boot it comes with a love poem emblazoned inside... well not emblazoned but it comes in the wrapper.  I gotta admit I felt a bit like Charlie in Willy Wonka's movie... opening the bar carefully so as not to possibly rip a ticket... seeing the gold metal foil... peeking inside... it said: *** from DON JUAN  A long, long kiss, a kiss of youth, and love, And beauty, all concentrating like rays Into one focus, kindled from above; Such kisses as belong to early days, Where heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move, And the blood's lava, and the pulse a blaze,  Each kiss a heart-quake, - for a kiss's strength, I think, it must be reckon'd by its length.  By length I mean duration; theirs endured Heaven knows how long - no doubt they never reckon'd; And if they had, they could not have secured The sum of their sensations to a second: They had not spoken; but they felt allured, As if their souls and lips each other beckond'd, Which, being join'd, like swarming bees they clung -  Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.  George Gordon, Lord Byron ***  At the end of Scene 16 in this play I just finished, my husband and I engage in a passionate kiss... my red lipstick all around his mouth.  He said he didn't want to wipe it away because he thought that action would look like disgust.  I used expensive smear-proof lipstick but every time the area around his lips looked like the rim of a coffee cup covered in red smear... I don't think the kisses smeared so bad on the other ones, just scene 16. The General in scene 17 said it was funny to try to keep serious while giving orders to a man with red lipstick mouth.  to be con't from the Hazelnut and Cherry Almond wrappers...

      Well, I suppose I could say, “ This window is now closed. Please wait in line for the next available… whatever.”   I was just starting to enjoy my blog-rhythm… I was creating a relationship with this and now that relationship must end. At least in the way I knew it. Either that or find a way to not care enough take the risk that I will be under greater scrutiny than I likely was before.  I was jotting in this at random in between tasks  at work  but now that is likely to end.   New AD in the office. His background is largely in “private investigation,” and it appears he hasn’t let that go. He’s only been here a week but managed to drop in my office like the po-lice first thing this morning. Not only was he checking up on me (I haven’t dealt with that since OH, high school) he took it out a few steps further than necessary, which is to me more intensified than any micromanagement I’d experienced first hand… that wasn‘t intended to be hostile anyway.  “So… T…what are you working on?” I told him the name of the assignment.  “Oh, what exactly are you doing?” … etc.   I thought:  I’m sorry… is there a reason you’re not asking this of my supervisor? or my supervisor’s supervisor? Or my supervisor’s supervisor’s chief?! (for real, it’s a long ladder).  His interrogation made about as much sense as showing up to Leisure World and frisking an old lady. Absolute nonsense.  Pretty tacky head start for your first week, mister.   Paradise to think at will has now ended. Big Brother has arrived. NICE. I was enjoying learning to juggle between my assignments and my self. AS… I am capable of easily doing the work of 3 people… doing the work of one puts me to sleep, and less than one? I then have to seduce myself into a trance. Oh fun. Maybe I need to go out and find a more demanding job. My supervisor’s supervisor said I work too fast… oh well.   Next time the AD questions me like that I think I’ll plea the 5th.  All these sparkly thoughts I get… no more fuel by daylight. How sad. Will I take the risk knowing he will likely look into my computer log, or will I find a better way to juggle in a relatively juggle-free environment? &nbsp;Hmm. Much to think about.   Though I did take a walk about the area on a break this afternoon to let my mind expand a little.  One of the ladies at my work is adorable. Lately I’ve noticed that she takes her break with another older man at the office. And, just as soon as they step out of the building, they hold hands and walk really close and slow next to each other. Awh. At first when I was walking up and they were walking out and she saw me checking them out, she looked a little on the defense. I smiled. I wouldn’t begrudge something like that. I found out there’s an even better story behind it all.  I guess in the recent past and when she used to work at a different location of our office she used to be really outgoing and funny and she would flirt with all the men, but I am told she came off too aggressive and built a reputation. She’d say things like “I need love. I need a man. I want a boyfriend.” and her coworker told her not to seem so desperate, not to say those things. “But I do!” She’d say. Still…  So she’d take the risk of looking silly and she kept flirting and flirting… of one man in particular she kept asking him to spend time with her. He flatly said no. He told her that even though he was a widow he only ever loved his wife and no other woman.  But still the woman kept trying. And eventually he said he would give it a chance. I suppose that was just a few months ago…  Awh.  The coworker who told me about this said, “Could you imagine finding a man like that?! How lucky she is!”  “I know…” I said.

      or...f'ck ya!   I keep seeing this idea pop up in various places and in different ways, but the basis is the same:    The more you curb or numb the force that compels you toward something, the lesser the energy to get there. &nbsp;   Good point.&nbsp; Girls at lunch were talking about 'bags of tricks and toys' and one girl said see why I don't have a boyfriend... I was like ya you're right, she doesn't need one... hmm...   Why find an alternate way to pacify or&nbsp;numb yourself when you should take that energy and pour it into what you  really  want?&nbsp; Moderation...? Control...? We're so controlled by our own selves, we own our selves and are locking others out, maybe.   It's like I told one of the girls in theatre... she said she felt nervous and was worried about that when she was on stage.&nbsp; I told her everyone on stage is nervous, it's an energy and you need to put that energy into your performance...  That sort of thing.  If you make yourself numb or lessen your desire, it lessens the impact.&nbsp; That's no fun.  I'd rather take it full and complete.&nbsp; How passionless people are when they're anesthetized, either that or their focus for their passion gets skewed and misplaced.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I know&nbsp;that given the choice I prefer the intensity.  I guess I'm building up momentum. Waiting for impact...

      Haa haa haa haaaaaa.&nbsp; And Moz should take note because he seems to have a more Mex heart than Brit but oh whatever.  Oh wait, that's me, t-hee.&nbsp; Irish Blood, Mexican Heart.   I actually bought his  You are the Quarry  album (vinyl) yesterday.&nbsp; Don't know why.&nbsp; I've always recognized him as a good lyricist but eh, never was too terribly fixed to his stuff.&nbsp; At my first listen I thought it was a really safe album.&nbsp; He didn't really take any risks, it sounds like his old stuff.&nbsp; His fans like his old stuff so I suppose he didn't make a wrong move, unless he felt compelled to do something *new*.&nbsp; Not the case here.&nbsp; And eh his lyrics are more emotional than rational... I was reading the sheet and thinking well Moz if you consider x, y & z then&nbsp;maybe it'd help you feel less pressured by this and that... but again, whatever.  *note though.&nbsp; I read elsewhere that he considers this album brighter than the others. Yes, that is true, it isn't as melancholic or morose as the ones from the past. I will agree there. He did turn that page.  So many, many other things I could have bought.&nbsp; That's all I bought.&nbsp; And the 7" Irish Blood...  Go figure, I wasn't thinking.   As a matter of fact, I felt I hardly thought at all during the whole weekend.&nbsp; Didn't feel compelled to think with anyone, just in my bubblebath, running my thoughts in time with the water, it all comes rushing out.&nbsp; Foams up, dies down.&nbsp; I'm clean then to bed.  I feel a bit bad about it.&nbsp; And Suz if you ever are bored and you read this - sorry! I got your message late and was already wound down at that... I failed to call back about 6 or 7 people.&nbsp; 2 or 3 I could understand but why do people want to see me when I'm flat toward them... I've been trying to make dietary changes and as a result I am dealing with all this action/reaction inside.&nbsp; I felt safer keeping it low key.&nbsp; Just super sensitive with mild headaches but that's ok.&nbsp; I just didn't feel compelled to be too brave, to deal.&nbsp; I kept my objectives simple.&nbsp; Not to mention this heat is making me insane.&nbsp; The things I want to do but am so limited to... oh god.   Yes I was bad, I called no one back, just yet.&nbsp; I feel bad and rude. I just couldn't though.&nbsp; Although I did talk with my brother and we were in orange county yesterday paying Mickey a visit... then we went record shopping.&nbsp;  I don't care what anyone else says and I seem to be the exception but for how I see Orange County I still love it and always did and always will.&nbsp; I just don't see&nbsp;it the way others describe it. I was super comfortable there for many reasons.&nbsp; I felt safe.&nbsp; I felt SUPER clear headed and in LA I don't feel clear-headed that often.&nbsp; It's my own opinion but there's something almost feng shui about the layout of all the streets, it feels super balanced.&nbsp; Like you don't have to consider things on the outside giving you more time to go on the inside.  Once I went into one of the record shops from the old days, I actually felt guilty.&nbsp; I felt all these thoughts I had about the things I believe in and how in LA I lose sight of this and I feel so neutral and inaffective here, like I feel like I am taking up space. So then...?  Just... more stuff to ponder.     Oh, and did I mention? you win. YES YOU. If you don't want to win, let me go.&nbsp; You're too within my view. You know we could win... get here ...  Either that or I could continue to ruminate in the torture of everything going on inside of me, but I think all this would suit to you better...

      Quote from narrative in Truffaut's&nbsp; Jules et Jim:    Burning&nbsp;love letters scene:    &nbsp;   “…here is a scene that some people, critics, have pointed out as having a certain kind of symbolic significance in terms of Catherine’s character. She dumps out these old love letters and sets them on fire and the fire gets a little out of control, and scorches the hem of her nightgown and Jim puts it out. Later on in the film she’ll throw herself in the Seine …Water…Fire… and then she’ll be seen putting Vitriol down the drain of the sink. And there’s a reference to Vitriol as liquid fire. So these are images, the fire, the water, burning, drowning, and yes they do serve a symbolic function by the thing about them that is interesting is the fact that they don’t play like symbols, there’s no portent involved. They’re not hitting you over the head and even if you don’t necessarily ‘get them’ they’re there and the function they serve within the narrative is just as compelling as any symbolic function. That’s a kind of naturalism…in a film that is not naturalistic. As I’ve said, the style of the film has a heightened kind of Romanticism to it and its very lively and alive and it sets you into the consciousness of watching a film. It reminds you quite a bit of time, that you’re watching a film and yet these characters are beautifully played and feel extremely real…”   *~*   I didn’t think I would like this film and I almost chose not to watch it. I understood the first half and liked it somewhat and the second half seemed to be exceptionally for entertainment - one extreme postulated against another. While watching the film I felt that in each moment, within the frame, there was more and more to look into. Not so much depth as immediate details. Nice though, I’d give it a second shot.   I saw myself in the first portion of this - that balancing of energy - but once the mid point of the film came up Catherine kept overstepping into areas with Jules and Jim like a child making demands and by the end you can see no matter what is said by these men (and MERELY said), none of that matters because she is in a situation where she resorts to having to overstep to them. Just messy.   Reminded me quite a bit of the summer of ‘97. I just broke up with my college sweetheart. I HAD to. I realized after 2 years I was the relationship and he was on auto-pilot the whole time. It was as simple as me walking away and he letting me because it was so much so my work. When I walked away he was powerless and he let it be that way, he didn’t have to but on the other hand I don’t know that he knew anything else. One of 4 brothers and NONE of them seemed to know much of serious relationships but what girlfriends brought to the table. Or, as his mother used to apologize on occasion to me, “I am so sorry T, that I spoiled him so badly…” Ya tell me about it. Though I don’t doubt for a moment that had I not influenced him so strongly that he would not be married today. The other 3 older brothers are not married, they don’t know how to move…what a waste.   Back to square one. What exactly reminded me of the summer of ‘97 was after I left M, I ran into another college pal of mine soon after, C. I think it was just a couple weeks later. He suggested we hang out. So, then he introduced me to his 2 male best friends, R & S. C tried to make a move on me fairly quickly. But something inside of me said no. So I held off from his advances. As the summer rolled out, it was … beautiful. C, R &amp; S were all very beautiful. They were all still in college and somewhere between 21 and 23 in age. C was a computer engineer, R was in art school, S was in school too but totally uncertain as to what he wanted to focus on but he worked as a model as well. They all looked like models… and they dressed perfectly… I was in an aesthetic paradise in the very least, but everything was…succulent? I don‘t know what word to use. We 4 would go out every weekend to clubs, bars, parties, art galleries… etc. Anywhere we went was paradise. Sitting in the car was paradise. Breathing was paradise. Seriously… I was in paradise. Smart, beautiful, attractive, everything was there. I would look at them and say how could I pick one over another!? No way. I couldn’t. So, I just went along for the ride. And what a ride… Always and at one point or another one of them would start to make an advance to get somewhere with me, to pull me in, but with the offset of the others it wasn’t going to happen. You could feel it. In a way, if R or S would have actually made a significant move, they would have stepped over C who ‘found me first’ and C was my friend longer, so the whole thing was peculiarly balanced. We went out a LOT. I was always snug between these 3 guys. If we were at a party and I was walking around people would ask me, where are your boys? Oh, my boys… hee hee. I liked that. But yes, I’d look at them and think HOW could I pick one over another, I couldn’t. C was Spanish and was immaculately handsome as were the other 2. R was I believe completely Scottish in ethnicity. And S was my then favorite ethnic combination - half Asian, half Caucasian. I’d say about half of my boyfriends or love interests since high school were always ¼ or ½ Asian and the rest just Caucasian. I think I liked that back then because they looked more like me… but I am not Asian at all.   We weren’t physical, me and the boys. Nothing beyond what children would do if at all. One time C was driving my car and R was in the passenger seat, ironically I was in the back seat with S and somehow… well… I remember one of us had one of those twisty ties you use for garbage bags? The paper over a metal twisty tie… and one of us was trying to bite it out of the other’s mouth… like I think S must have bit down on it and waved it at me and I bit down on the other end of this little tie piece and our lips were like an inch or 2 away, engaged in a sort of tug-of-war with teeth. And C and R were REALLY not happy with this. C got angry and R was sulking. So, that little game didn’t last very long.   Unusual! The balance didn't allow for an action, it just was.&nbsp; I love it and it was so unique.&nbsp; I remember toward the end of the summer I just sensed that S and I would never go all the way.&nbsp; I don't know why but it was something underneath it all.&nbsp; So I gave him something unique of myself.&nbsp; I never once tried to smoke a cigarette and he smoked like a choo-choo train.&nbsp; One night I took one of his Dunhills and he lit it for me.&nbsp; I remember this guy with a camera took pics of it all, it was like a HUGE ordeal.&nbsp; I thought, well, we're not going to get  there  so I'll give him my smoking virginity! Haa haa... I wasn't designed to smoke.&nbsp; I don't look right with a cigarette in my mouth.&nbsp; People laugh.&nbsp; eh! After that I tried to smoke more but it just didn't take it didn't feel natural, so it never was a habit, just a failed attempt.&nbsp; BUT... smoking S's Dunhill, that was something I gave him that no one else would.   I have sharp, tight memories of C and R too...   By the end of summer, after months of frustration, C met a girl and began to date her. She was really unhappy with my… existence. Regardless of the fact that I was respectful and would never ever do anything to disrespect one of my boys, she was really uncomfortable and asked C to let me go, and he did. It sounds awful, but I understood… because the truth of what was there was much stronger than anything anyone could physically enact. It doesn’t make sense on the surface, but I respect him so I let him go.  And our happy 4-some summer came to a fade. Sigh.   Then a few months later in January I started getting romantically involved with this popular bay area musician, B …yes, bay area, as in 350+ miles north. It’s called Southwest Airlines! Yah. He traveled down here to perform gigs and see me, and I’d fly up there and stay weekends…  But as that got rolling that January ‘98 both C and R were getting involved with girls but S was still single. One night at one of the musician’s shows S noticed there was something between me and B,and then he&nbsp;got aggressive and tried to speak. Regardless, things were still awkward. Part of me was really happy that this amazing, popular musician wanted me to himself, and part of me was upset that S let me get away but I also understood things weren’t so clear cut. So then what do you do? You just deal. B and I were just starting to entangle&nbsp;in January. It was so new with B I didn’t even see him on Valentines. And yet I ended up at a party with friends on Valentines day. And S was there, but I don’t recall C or R being there. It was one of my most favorite Valentines day memories. All my Valentines are great - how can it not be, someone’s giving you some love! So at this party at this friend’s apartment S and I were sitting close on the couch. We had this game we made up, just between us, where one of us would start quoting lyrics from a PW song, and the other would complete them. And we’d try to get more and more obscure to test each other. And other people usually couldn’t understand us though they’d listen in and try to figure it out.   I remember as S and I were sitting there, this other girl who was fairly popular was single and sitting across the room. She started shouting at S to talk to him, and divert attention. One thing I loved about him is he never seemed to make another girl important in my presence. I am not sure why. Even much later on when he got a girlfriend if I walked in the room it was like she was not there and he’d panic…   So there we were on the couch and E, across the room was shouting at S, and he would give her short answers and he kept playing games with me. There was a bowl of candy hearts on the coffee table. I picked it up. I dug around for things I’d want to say but didn’t. Then I’d pick one like “KISS ME” and I would have rather it said “kiss me damn it, how long do I have to wait“?! but all that wouldn’t fit on a little heart. So I’d pick a heart then turn it upside down on his leg or hand and then he’d get a message back for me. It was … SUPER. Ha ahaa. Amazing. We did this over and over it was so much fun. After awhile at this party… I remember at one point I was going through this guy’s photo albums and whatever and people were watching something on TV. Finally I noticed S was missing, and I just left. How else could you end the evening? I thought I had what seemed to me a more solid chance with B because he was more direct and there wasn’t any complication beyond the mere 350+ miles between us… yikes.   So I left… and as I walked outside I heard this “Bye T” and I looked around, but I didn’t see anyone… then I heard, “up here!” And there was S all alone, out on the balcony of this apartment upstairs, just him and the stars above. I think in that very moment I saw him standing up there, alone, by himself, in the stars, in his cloud of thinking that there was more beauty in that than in anything I’d seen in so long. I waved. I said something, I don’t recall…   Enough memoir writing! Too many stories to tell… this was supposed to be about Jules et Jim. Oh funny, I think today is S’s birthday! If not today right about now like tomorrow or yesterday…

      Martha is ... awesome.  Martha Stewart.&nbsp; Model.&nbsp; Creative super&nbsp;goddess.&nbsp; Crafty to the point of madness.&nbsp; I heard that she is so into her work that she only sleeps 4 hours a night,  with the lights on,  anticipating getting up for the next day to work some more.  Now only if she'd claim up responsibility for her underhandedness in her skewed ambition for stock market greed I would be moreso an admirer.&nbsp;&nbsp; If she'd have just said, "Yes. I am greedy and, though outwardly I maintain great composure,&nbsp;inside I lost control.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't you see that?" ...oh ...ah!  I don't think she'd consider 5 months house arrest a punishment... unless they made her sleep in and not allow her to work, but I am curious to see what kind of work she accomplishes&nbsp;during her 5 months in&nbsp;prison.&nbsp; Will she write a book?&nbsp; Will she get involved in prison life, or will she use her power to keep separate from the regular prisoners, maybe by means of special arrangements?   Hmm.

      ...past life via computer software?!&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Chapter 1:&nbsp; The Sun  Your Sun is in Pisces (Tropical zodiac).  Coming under the influences of Pisces, water and religion or spiritual matters are likely to have an untold influence on you.   Pisces means or symbolizes what is naturally, or by its very nature, representative of influences of the higher soul or higher spiritual level. &nbsp;Hence those things of the spiritual nature should preferably be the way in which your judgments are drawn, as to whether this or that activity should be your impelling influence. &nbsp;Not that you should become lost in motives or in influences impelling your actions: just use those things of the spiritual import as the measuring rod of your activities and experiences.   In light of this, T, the period around the birth and ministry of Jesus, the Christ, is the clearest past life for you to recall and build upon in the present. &nbsp;You may even remember a lifetime as part of Roman culture, where priority was placed upon position in society and in the military.

      Example.  &nbsp;  Some of the dialog from my scene study re. J. Webster's  Duchess...  (can't guarantee verbatim on the following, just off the top of my head at the moment...)    &nbsp;  ...  Duchess:&nbsp; Fie fie! What's all this! One of your eyes is bloodshot.&nbsp; Take my ring to it.&nbsp; They say 'tis very soverign.&nbsp; 'Twas my wedding ring and I did vow never to part with it but to my second husband.  &nbsp;  Antonio:&nbsp; You have parted with it now.  &nbsp;  Duchess: Yes, to help your eyesight.  &nbsp;  Antonio:&nbsp; You have made me stark blind.  &nbsp;  Duchess:&nbsp; How?  &nbsp;  Antonio:&nbsp; There is a saucy and ambitious devil that is dancing in this circle.  &nbsp;  Duchess:&nbsp; Remove him.  &nbsp;  Antonio:&nbsp; How?  &nbsp;  Duchess:&nbsp; It takes small conjuration when your finger may do it; thus.&nbsp; Is it fit?  &nbsp;  Antonio:&nbsp; What said you?!  &nbsp;  Duchess:&nbsp; Sir, this goodly roof of yours is too low built.&nbsp; I cannot stand upright in it nor discourse without I raise it higher.&nbsp; Raise yourself, or, if you please, my hand to help you.&nbsp; So  &nbsp;  etc.  &nbsp;  Point being... can you see that the 'circle' the saucy and ambitious devil is dancing in is the wedding ring, and the duchess is telling her man servant to 'remove' the devil by using his finger... by putting on the ring.&nbsp; As she says "thus. Is it fit?" I think at *thus* she puts it on him, and then asks if the ring fit ok.   My immediate instructor (not SK) thought the circle was Antonio's eye.&nbsp; I see consistency for their dialog working around him putting the ring on, and him mentioning it that way saying it looks like what he thinks it is but he is seeking more assurance from her.  &nbsp;  nother day, nother dollar.&nbsp;

      a la Ren &amp; Stimpy.  &nbsp;  I must be losing my mind... I remembered seeing an interview on TV looong ago, maybe pre-election of George "HW" Bush, with Babs and then I looked up a couple sources to compare to the interview in my memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;The past story and the current story totally contradict... I am scratching my head and thinking maybe I have brain damage...  &nbsp;  I remember her being interviewed maybe even before GHWB went into office and she went on about how much older she was than GHWB and how she kept holding out and she didn't marry young, she married later and was glad she waited so long because "look how it turned out!" she said...  &nbsp;  I am&nbsp;SO confused.  A couple sources I found just now say she's a year younger than he is and they met when they were 16?!  I saw a picture of them with kids, they look 20-something... but even as of the past decade she looks like she's got quite a stretch ahead of him.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So confused.  If it wasn't her who was it?! I'm about 90% sure it was her that's why I feel lost. Oh well.

      All this *golden* talk reminded me of a moment last year... when I went against my intuition and it knee-jerked right back at me... I was driving around town with my bro in the passenger seat and I was just then getting acquainted with my video camera.  I told him to videotape whatever he saw that interested him and he didn't really want to bother with it much.  And after awhile I was filming while I was driving, and he was STILL uncomfortable with the videocam out.  So I turned it off and put it away just as we pulled into 7-11, right next to a 70's looking golden Maserati... and Pat Smear came out of 7-11 and smiled and started to get into his golden car and we stared and smiled at him and he smiled at us and we just all stared and smiled... and my bro being the PR fan he is, well, that too could have been a golden moment to video IF I DIDN'T GO AGAINST MY INTUITION and put the camera away.  But at least it's in my memory bank! The OTHER Mod Closet...

      I am an ass... for not better understanding that I was reconsidering someone:  1) who told me that he would never again do for another girl what he gave for one of his previous ex-girlfriends - thereby lowering standards for himself and anyone he would from then on out consider (talk about life being  cheap ); 2) that he would see me as equal to his other ex-girlfriends, which is close enough to having multiple girlfriends at his choice; and 3) he said he would  never  marry me.  And much, much more!  Golden.  I am a total and complete idiot.  So just go away already.  Is there something about the fact that I am 34 and totally COMPLETELY averse to #1-3 that you don't get? And you think that  I  broke your heart?? You broke your own AND mine by choice, you said and did many hurtful things. So just go away.  Glean from your 'primary' ex-girlfriend instead since she's so special and try to make all your 'others' like her instead of me. Now that would make sense.

      If language is as inextricably tied up with consciousness as it seems to be, then the continuing diminishment of our inclination to use it to express in letters the times in which we live could mean that an element of human consciousness itself is on the verge of disappearing.  - another thought borrowed from the dear Anon.  Not that I need any Justintimberflakification.

      Excellence can be attained if you care more than others think is wise, risk more than others think is safe, dream more than others think is practical, and expect more than others think is possible.   or how about:  Forgiveness is the fragrance that the flower leaves on the heel of the one that crushed it. that's so hippy.

       Read these postings in reverse order (2, then 1), of course.  Funny   Viewing questions 1-2 of 2 asked about this item.     1)  that was the best reply to the fyi..lmao...do you have both discs that come in the set or just the one with the movie??? (07/07/2004)      Hi, Sorry but just the feature disc only. Thank you       2)  FYI you will never sell at that price when someone can get a complete brand new one for the same amount. You should lower if you want to sell. (06/16/2004)      FYI Who the hell asked you??!!?? You obviously have nothing but time on your hand, go help at the local shelter. FYI It will sell, eventually.

      Why is it every time I am down my friend secret agent -0- finds me? I am lucky that secret agent -0- is hot on the trail... I am lucky to have so many friends, but there are few that I feel can feel me and some who can understand me alarmingly well whether they know this or not. For knowing Zero, I am lucky.   A friend hears the song in my heart and sings it to me when my memory fails.  - Anon.  So hippy.

      For the record... (waa waa waa) Lyrics aren't so pretty when seen without music.  Sometimes I look at the chunks of lyrics I've assembled in this blog and I want to put clothes on them, they're so bare and awkward but there's no other way.  Greenday doesn't look so bad naked but that seems to be the exception.  It's all that doo wah wah wah doo stuff that irks me.  Scat-looking wordage. There's got to be a happy medium to it.  Main Entry: 3 scat Function: noun Etymology: origin unknown  : jazz singing with nonsense syllables

      Section 1: The Sun   Sun in Pisces:   The flowering of compassion, through your ability to merge on a feeling level and to empathize with all, is a key theme for you in this lifetime. This propensity to share others' emotional experience has both its blessings and its deficits. At your finest, T, you have a deeply-felt understanding of human nature which goes beyond words or intellect, and which enables you to forgive others' misdeeds and make allowances for their weaknesses. You are acutely aware of others' pain, including the emotional wounds and brokenness they carry within, and your ability to listen with an understanding heart and to unconditionally accept people as they are can be a healing influence in their lives. You are inclined to exclude nobody. At a deep level you feel and know your oneness with all creatures, and thus every snail in the garden or stray cat is part of your "heart's family".   However, this same all-embracing emotional/psychic openness and receptivity can be the source of some of your greatest challenges in life. It is easy for you to become overwhelmed by the world and its sorrows, and to seek some form of escape from it and from your own extreme sensitivity; for instance, over using drugs or alcohol or even food to alter your mood, or retreating from life into the unreal world of television or other diversions. You may simply withdrawing into your own private fantasies to avoid confronting the challenges in the physical world. At its worst this tendency can devolve into evasiveness and playing ostrich "about important issues in your life". While your imagination and your sensitivity are the well spring of some of your richest experiences and gifts, if over indulged you may become passive, ineffectual, lost or confused. Especially when young, T, you may lack a strong sense of self, of definition and identity, because on a feeling level you identify with others so easily. It can be difficult for you to separate yourself, to know what your boundaries are, when to say no or how to stand up for your own personal interests. Since you are not narrowly focused on self, others may take advantage of your natural generosity and sympathy. Learning and incorporating the concepts of discrimination and clear judgment will enable you to give of yourself in ways that are healthy for you and the ones you are giving to.

      Life is a tragedy for those who feel and a comedy for those who think ...have no nerve.  sure.  "A Lovely Sunday..." is a tragicomedy. The only way to get through the darkness is with a laugh...conceptually correct.   All By Myself  ~ Greenday I was alone  I was all by myself  No one was looking  I was thinking of you  Oh yea did i mention  I was all by myself  All by myself  I went to your house  But no one was there  I went in your room  I was all by myself  You and me had  Such wonderful times  When i'm all by myself  All by myself   funny funny funny... xXxXXXXxXXXxxxxXXXxx

      The tag on this morning's tea bag reads:  "We can learn from a tree how to exist in ecstasy."  That's YOGI TEA brand... you know... so you can tell the other girls you're involved with to drink the same kind of tea so you can pretend you're in my company - NOT.  As for even understanding meaning to the words in quotes... I'm too livid.  And stupid, apparently.

      His vaguery said yes.  Said .  Past-tense.  Present-tense? says otherwise.  I'm pissed.  Don't know... my overall sense is usually spot on so I don't know what to say as to why he believes what he believes and why he does what he does and he can TRY to skim me, read me, snatch fragments of what I appear to be and try to hang them like ornaments on another tree... still isn't me.  I am me because of my soul, there is NO replacing that.  Back to the drawing board.  At least in the mod days it seemed that everyone around me felt the same way and it still looks like that from here.  If I knew then what I know now... damn...  Went to the bank.  Random radio redundancy?  Firstly, in my head:  HERCULES ~ Aaron Neville  Then,   Something  ~ The Beatles    Do You Want To Know A Secret  ~ The Beatles    Tell it Like It Is  ~ Aaron Neville (strange coincidence) If you want something to play with Go and find yourself a toy Baby my time is too expensive And I'm not a little boy  If you are serious Don't play with my heart It makes me furious But if you want me to love you Then a baby I will, girl you know that I will  Tell it like it is Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide But I know deep down inside me I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride  Life is too short to have sorrow You may be here today and gone tomorrow You might as well get what you want So go on and live, baby go on and live  Tell it like it is I'm nothing to play with Go and find yourself a toy But I... Tell it like it is My time is too expensive and I'm not your little boy  *~* Someone should put me in a time capsule and SHOOT me into the past where I can find what all these amazing lyricists were living in that I can relate to them then and no one relates to me now.

      So immediately following trippingly in the dark on the blind heels of SHAX, I am now about done reading through the play "A Lovely Sunday ..." and now it has me thinking ... if I am just being an ass in life...  A glimpse, borrowed from another's eyes:  A great writer cannot turn out a masterpiece (that overloaded term) each time, and no one reading or seeing  A Lovely Sunday...  will mistake it for Williams's best work. Nevertheless, it has a touch of his genius, and enacts in miniature what he does so well in his greatest plays. Several mismatched people living in a boarding house in St. Louis become entangled in each other's lives. Prominent among them is an aging woman now basing her hope for a "real" life on the proposal of a man hardly worth her attention, and who learns she will have to make a life for herself or remain unfulfilled. The message of the play is to appreciate what you have, rather than striving for what you cannot achieve. It's a lesson Blanche DuBois might have heeded. As always, the poetic quality of the author's dialogue and stage directions enhances the play. This nicely printed New Directions "paperbook" is recommended to those who already know the author's best work, and who would like to get a fuller sense of his different moods and subjects.  Depressing, non? Oui.  Yesterday while trying to do research I found a woman's blog... and she had this disclaimer I thought was kind of witty... and it went into detail about respecting people's online journals and if you stumble onto someone's journal and you know them and you read their info how to be proper... and that you shouldn't read an ex-lover's journal... and I have been... and I have been stupid enough to think that maybe he was thinking of me by his watery insinuations but I can't see how now... for some reason I look at it all and it looks like he's got so many loose-knit variations of girlfriends scattered about the place.  A person like that has no trust because they create this net and each strand of the net is a lover so if one strand breaks, well... the saftey net as a whole is still in tact... so if they f'ck up oh well, next...  That's F'cking WEAK.  Oh, I can't handle myself or anyone else so I'll keep scattered women about so if I f'ck up I'll just discard LOVE like it didn't exist ... Mf'cker... PLEASE.  THAT'S NOT LOVE... that's f'cking pathetic.  WHAT the f'ck kind of modern love is THAT?!  It somewhat resembles the mass of dating I scrambled through last year and that was  beyond  retarded. What makes  your  fear and pain so special from anyone elses?! How is it you pretend monogamy when you can't deal monogamy?  Not fair. "Sufferance is the badge of all our tribe." Wm Shax - f'cking hello. If you can't trust the person you are with (saftey net  =  no trust) then you can't trust yourself and if you can't trust yourself you're NOT READY.  Climb back into your incubator and quit antagonizing all the strands... No risk!  Who'd have thought love came in frozen packs...at the supermarket.  I am feeling like a huge fool.  Oh sure, I'll take a number, an imaginary one at that... read me back... and TELL ME WHAT I AM WORTH and dare look again at your 'saftey net'. I must be Hercules that I can hang from a single wire while this type of man has to use a complete net... oh the fury. And then... if I am Hercules, what man is strong enough to stand beside myself? Dizzy, depressed, in need of more rest...  Am I the last of the monogamists?! SILENCE. *standing poised, axe in hand*

      I am in such an odd place, I don't know what to do with myself. I just keep plowing forward, I have no sense of walls or curbs to lean against at this point in my 'journey'.  I just sense everything feels weird.  Sooooo, the Saga of Vilhelm Shaxpere has come to a grand pause. I made the mistake of showing up to performance night in a 'tailored' black dress shirt that sent SK into a rampage.  She claimed to be pissed off because the whole stage is black and I wasn't to wear all black.  I reminded her that for my first monologue I was performing as ham1et in mourning and he is in  all black  but from there on out I had a colored blouse underneath and a character skirt for the rest of the evening.  NOT good enough. She cussed me out for any and every turn she could find.  Please.  TOTALLY inappropriate.  I love being attacked for doing the right thing, really. So she sent me and a fist full of men in black to the costume room to find bright colored mens dress shirts...  I found a 70's hot pink mens dress shirt a la butterflyish collar to mourn in... and I tied on my black cape... black pants... performed ham1et... then changed into 'feminine' clothing. It went very well.  The reactions told me so.   I feel like I am in such an odd place suddenly.  I can only describe it at best as I did above... like all walls and curbs are missing, but I need to forge ahead - if I am even moving in that direction, it's hard to tell without walls and curbs...  Not alone yet I feel completely alone.  sorta   I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself  ~ THE WHITE STRIPES  I just don't know what to do with myself  I don't know what to do with myself  planning everything for two  doing everything with you  and now that we're through  I just don't know what to do   I just don't know what to do with myself  I don't know what to do with myself  movies only make me sad  parties make me feel as bad  cause I'm not with you  I just don't know what to do   like a summer rose  needs the sun and rain  I need your sweet love  to beat love away   well I don't know what to do with myself  just don't know what to do with myself  planning everything for two  doing everything with you  and now that we're through  I just don't know what to do   like a summer rose  needs the sun and rain  I need your sweet love  to beat love away   I just don't know what to do with myself  just don't know what to do with myself  just don't know what to do with myself  I don't know what to do with myself

      I LOOOOOOOOOOOVE The Sensations.  Yvonne Baker and the Sensations!  I am glad I own a 45" of "Let Me In". It's a serious nostalgia piece for me. It reminds me of when I was young and taking risks and ... when I was in high school I liked to shop at thrift stores ALONE 'cause it wasn't ok or acceptable... just me and the blue hairs.  And it seemed frequent that this song would come on the oldies station in the shops I went to.  As soon as I hear it, it's instant transport to that time I was shopping, and I had this sense that I could do no wrong and my hunches paid off and things were good. I just get a strong visual of what things looked like in my life back then... my hair, my clothes, my world! It was all unique and every detail I brought in was pleasing! I was SUPER DUPER in love with life and felt like every day was like discovering a treasure...  Another reason I love this song is the rhythm is similar to Ska though it's categorized as a 60's RnB tune.    AND... it just sounds so damn cute no matter when I hear it! From the first time and now!  *~*   Let Me In ~ The Sensations  (1961) Words and Music by Yvonne Baker (why does my ARGO 45 RPM say Y. Mills then?!) Topped out at # 4 in 1962  Let me in whee-ooh (whee-ooh, whee-ooh, hoop-whee-ooh) (Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, hoo-ooh-oop-whee-ooh, whee-ooh)  I can see the dancin' (let me in) The silhouettes on the shade I hear the music (music), all the lovers on parade Open up (let me in), I wanna come in again I thought you were my friend  Pitter patter of those fee-ee-ee-ee-eet Movin' and a-groovin' with that be-eat Jumpin' and stompin on the flo-o-o-o-oor (Lemme in) Let me in!

      Okay, does someone want to let me in on this?  I laughed while driving home my usual brief commute…given usually enough time to listen to 2 or 3 songs (talk about a brief commute).  Today’s random redundant radio catch?!:   Spiral Staircase ~ I love you more today than yesterday   I don't remember what day it was I didn't notice what time it was All I know is that I fell in love with you And if all my dreams come true I'll be spending time with you  Every day's a new day in love with you With each day comes a new way of loving you Every time I kiss your lips my mind starts to wander And if all my dreams come true I'll be spending time with you  Oh, I love you more today than yesterday But not as much as tomorrow I love you more today than yesterday But, darling, not as much as tomorrow  Tomorrow's date means springtime's just a day away Cupid, we don't need ya now, be on your way I thank the lord for love like ours that grows ever stronger And I always will be true I know you feel the same way too.  Oh, I love you more today than yesterday But not as much as tomorrow I love you more today than yesterday But only half as much as tomorrow  Every day's a new day, every time I love ya Every way's a new way, every time I love ya Every day's a new day, oh, how I love ya    The Shirelles ~  Soldier boy  (BTW, this melody sounds like a clear influence on the Breeders’ “Drivin' on 9”)  Soldier boy oh my little soldier boy  I'll be true to you  You were my first love  And you'll be my last love  I will never make you blue  I'll be true to you  In the whole world  You can love but one girl  Let me be that one girl  For I'll be true to you   Where ever you go  My heart will follow  I love you so  I'll be true to you  Take my love with you  To any port or foreign shore  Darling you must feel for sure  I'll be true to you   Soldier oh my little soldier boy  I'll be true to you.     The Spinners ~ Working my way back to you / Forgive me, girl   Ooh...ooh...ooh... Ooh...ooh...ooh...  I’ll keep working my way back to you, babe With a burning love inside Hey, I’m workin’ my way back to you, babe And the happiness that died  I let it get away Do, do, do, do, do (Been paying every day) Do, do, do, do, do  When you were so in love with me I played around like I was free Thought I could have my cake and eat it too But how I cried over losing you  See, I’m down and out But I ain’t about to go living my life without you Hey, every day I made you cry I’ll pay and, girl, till the day I die  I’ll keep workin’ my way back to you, babe With a burnin’ love inside Yeah, I’m workin’ my way back to you, babe And the happiness that died  I let it get away Do, do, do, do, do (Been payin’ every day) Do, do, do, do, do  Oh, I used to love to make you cry It made me feel like a man inside If I had been a man in reality You’d be here, baby, loving me  Now my nights are long and lonely And I ain’t too proud, babe, I just miss you so Girl, but you’re too proud and you won’t give in But when I think about all I could win  I’ll keep working my way back to you, babe With a burning love inside Yeah, I’m workin’ my way back to you, babe And the happiness that died  I let it get away Do, do, do, do, do (Been payin’ every day) Do, do, do, do, do  (You, you, babe) My road is kind of long (You, you, babe) I just gotta get back home  Whoa, I’m really sorry for actin’ that way I’m really sorry, ooh, little girl I’m really sorry for throwin’ away our love, sweet little girl I’m really sorry for makin’ you cry I really mean it, don’t you hear me talkin’ to you I’m really sorry for telling you lies for so long  Oh, please, forgive me, girl, come on (Give me a chance) Won’t you forgive me, girl, hey, (Let’s have romance) Ooh, forgive me, girl (Let’s try again) Come on, forgive me, girl I want you over and over and over and over and over again  Won’t you give me one more try If you don’t I believe I’ll die  I’m sorry for actin’ that way I’m really sorry, little bitty girl I’m really sorry for throwin’ away our love  Please, baby, forgive me, girl, oh (Give me a chance) Won’t you forgive me, girl, hey (Let’s have romance) Please forgive me, girl (Let’s try again) Forgive me, girl I want you over and over and over and over and over again  I keep working my way back to you, babe With a burnin’ love inside Hey, I’m workin’ my way back to you, babe And the happiness that died  I let it get away Do, do, do, do, do (Payin’ every day) Do, do, do, do, do  I keep working my way back to you, babe Oh... yeah (Burning love inside) I keep workin’ my way back to you, babe And the happiness that died  I let it get away (Do, do, do, do, do) Paying every day (Do, do, do, do, do)  I keep working my way back to you, babe Yeah... (Burning love inside) (Working my way back to you, babe) And the happiness that died   *~*  I know that the average blogger or internet user would refrain from transcribing over full lyrics and would instead refer only to the song & artist but that’s not me then.  Long live the abuse of my own space, yay!  I laughed from one parking spot to the other.  Then, I walked up my steps… to find in the mail an additional refund check from the State.  It appears that I didn’t get enough money back from my taxes, so they sent me a check for more.  For this I laughed some too… Everything has me giggling now.  K - off to rehearse ‘till it hurts.

      Not a lot!   An optimist is a person who sees only the lights in the picture, whereas a pessimist sees only the shadows. An idealist, however, is one who sees the light and the shadows, but in addition sees something else: the possibility of changing the picture, of making the lights prevail over the shadows.   - Felix Adler  I pride myself on moments of feeling greatly vacant, yay! AAALLLLL these past days I worried about hurting my scene partner's girlfriend's feelings, not wanting for her to be uncomfortable with my acting romantic with her boyfriend... then the tables turn?! Perception is absurd.  I, THAT'S ME, I imagined she'd feel bad because of how anxious she became once she found out that her boyfriend and I were acting together in a romantic scene. SO both he and I dragged our feet not to get to that part, to avoid possibly hurting her feelings.  Her discomfort was very clear.  But funny... I never really noticed that she does NOT discuss him openly in the workplace, only one on one with certain people... and she has pictures of people on her desk, but not him! But, they've been in a relationship for 3 years?! Uh... call me stupid but why then? Why bother...  (let's call my scene partner's girlfriend/my secretary "Y") I was at Y's desk and I started to mention to one of the other secretaries standing next to her that Y's boyfriend and I were rehearsing and Y stopped me.  Behind the other secretary's back, Y waved at me to say nothing. Wha...  Then later she came by my office and said she'd never told me not to tell anyone because she didn't think it would ever come to that - that I might mention she has a boyfriend... Wha...  Ok, I am dumb!  I said I don't understand.  You two have been together 3 years, but you want it to stay a secret?! Why?  She said oh you know how people talk. I said talk about what? He works at another office, there's nothing to talk about.  I couldn't imagine calling someone my boyfriend and hiding them for years.  You shouldn't have to do that.  Yikes. Cornered. Her counter was, "well, you know."  No, I don't.  I don't understand making that kind of investment for nothing, not 3 years.  I know Y and I don't have that much in common but... I still don't get it.  Next, she was telling one of the new girls that they should go to a male strip club during lunch & the new girl asked me if I wanted to come along...?!  Okay... overbuff, oiled men are GAY whether they know it or not.  Those calendars? Are bought by gay men... or women of unique taste in my opinion.   I was at a loss...   Y & the new girl were smiling in agreement over these oily men... "oh, and it's full touch dancing," whatever the hell that means, haa haa haa... and I wanted to say but that's for gay men! Instead I just sat there with my mouth open and I tried not to catch any flies...  Wha...  I don't know anything.  Then she sent me an email this morning "FYI" :       For all those men who say,       "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free."       Here's an update for you.....       Nowadays 80% of women are against marriage.        Why?        Because women realize its not worth buying an entire Pig....       Just to get a little sausage.    If I had this sort of attitude I'd have to shoot myself.  Wha...  If you attack the person you're with, you attack yourself.  If you don't know yourself, you'll NEVER know the person you're with.  You never really 'know' but with certain understanding you do...  Of course, I know nothing, what do I know?  WTF! Can I leave now?! haa haa... No but really... if you allow circumstance to mold and change you in a negative way, like this, you miss out.  I am guessing that she seriously considered some men of bad taste/behavior in her past.  I don't believe in that.  I am firm in what I believe in I guess that's why I don't understand why she'd do what she's done, she's wasting one of the most enjoyable aspects of an individual's life:  LOVE.  I don't know anything.

      Quote from narrative in Truffaut's&nbsp; The 400 Blows    Burning Balzac shrine scene:   "Antoine's love of literature is something that was also characteristic of Truffaut as a child. It was really the only thing aside from film that he was interested in. This is why so many film critics feel an affinity for Truffaut, I think, because, they probably had that problem growing up too..."

      Where: 151 blvd St-Germain, 6th  Métro stop: St-Germain-des-Prés  Open: 08h - 0h45 daily; Closed August.    Brasserie Lipp  is a preserve of the Belle Epoque world of 1900. Léonard Lipp opened his brasserie in the 1870's after fleeing Alsace during the Franco-Prussian War. As such, it's menu is typical of that region including beer, sausage, sauerkraut and so forth. It stayed in the family until 1920 when Marcellin Cazas bought it in 1920. In 1958 Cazes was given the Legion of Honor for running the best literary salon in Paris. No wonder the publishers Grasset, Gallimard, and Hachette are nearby. But it has also been a meeting place for television personalities, ministers (it is halfway between the French Senate, and National Assembly), and actors, among others.   Ernest Hemingway also frequented Brasserie Lipp, and in his book A Moveable Feast wrote:   The beer was very cold and wonderful to drink. The pommes à l'huile were firm and marinated and the olive oil delicious. I ground black peper over the potatoes and moistened the bread in the olive oil. After the first heavy draft of beer I drank and ate very slowly. When the pommes à l'huile were gone I ordered another serving of cervelas. This was a sausage like a heavy, wide frankfurter split in two and covered with a special mustard sauce.  I mopped up all the oil and all of the sauce with bread and drank the beer slowly until it began to loose its coldness and finished it and ordered a demi ...   *~* When I was younger, pursuing my degrees, I found that one of maybe 2 writers I least liked was Ernest Hemingway.  Because his subtext wasn't relevant to his language and that bothered me. Oh well, that was a decade ago.  I could always give  Hills Like White Elephants  a second go...maybe at a particular cafe...

      I saw Weezer before they were popular... before they got radio airplay even.  I went with the same guy who took me to the "eat and greet" to see Lush @ Luna Park back in '94.  Weezer were opening up for Overwhelming Colorfast at the Troubadour.  We had passes to hang out with them upstairs in The Loft.  I remember sitting on the couch with the band but it was before they even played so it wasn't like I felt inspired to chat with them... I just sat there drinking something.  Rivers has interesting eyes.  I remember when I heard them play the Buddy Holly song I knew it'd catch... with all those hooks, how could it not?

      I found out last night that a hunch of mine was right. My scene partner and his girlfriend have a great divide between them.  They don't really talk... I asked him how long they've been seeing each other, he said 3 years.  AH! I couldn't imagine 3 months passing without having enough of a bond to communicate by. She's really guarded.  I told him to step up and take the lead. He didn't have a response for that. He did say that she's down about relationships.  I think her pessimistic languange is her way of trying to coerce him to encourage her, indirectly.  He said yeah though she is older... 6 years older... I said that's no big deal.  Actually I thought they were the same age.   I am glad that our scene was cut before the kiss. HE even said it would have made him uncomfortable because I work with her and she's likely to get mad.    WHY DON'T THEY TALK? IT'S A NOVEL CONCEPT, I KNOW...   Ironically another woman who was given the role I was initially given before I was told to "focus on forty" also chose to cut all her partner-related scene work and decided she needed another monologue... and she cut from immediately following my scene...  and she wants to seamlessly enter behind me after my scene in the same role????? ...  OKAY could we be a little more tacky? Or as my partner said last night... it's like those shots in soap operas where suddenly one actor is immediately replaced by another actor and you hear a voiceover announce that the role will now be played by another person.  HMM.   AND she made a choice to end it at the KISS part of the scene because she didn't want to end it early on. NICE. Well... I suppose the secretary here can get pissy at her instead, oh well.  What a glop of a seminar this was.

      At least it was on Sunday... and also observed on Monday?! SOooooo governmental to double-day a single holiday.  July's horoscope:  Anticipation and uncertainty on the 1st and 2nd give way to satisfaction on the 3rd and 4th. You're not above tickling your sacred cow until it moos with delight. Hijinks, shenanigans and general tomfoolery persist through the 9th. After that, you need to keep a straight face and focus on your surroundings. Everyone seems to be speaking a different language on the 10th and 11th. Groups have a hard time communicating beyond their circle. You're not taking on anyone else's problems, though. Celebrate your strengths and passions from the 12th to 14th. Be brave if you attract unexpected attention between the 15th and 21st. After all, this isn't about publicity. This time it's really you. Even so, popular opinion sways you on the 17th and 18th. You're not going to argue with a fashion that you like. On the 22nd you solve a long-standing mystery, but by the 23rd you have to reconsider who's still trustworthy. Starting on the 26th you find soothing answers to these questions and a happy ending to the month of August. The 30th and 31st are nothing less than a festival of love and wish fulfillment, your favorite destinations.  ...Imagine!

      At the crux of the beautiful Sonnet No. Ninety-One, I have found a solution. I can read it to anyone as I can read it to no one. Temporary reason being that I am ultimately wrong... hee hee.  It's like this.  The point of this sonnet is that the reader is as the final couplet reads:  " wretched  in this ALONE that THOU mayst take  ALL this away and me most  wretched  make."   True? You are warned by the writer.  To live this way is wretched.  To put all your eggs into one proverbial basket is crazy.  What will you fall back on if the basket drops? You lose all (but you gain all at the same time).  Considering that I know this is wrong (but I do it over and over anyway, ha!), it is a form of temporary bastardization to my own romantic view of this sonnet.  Is it really fair to put THAT much of an onus on my love interest?! Am I, by the weight of such a circumstance, being overbearing and ridiculous... it is apparently imbalanced. Dunno.  Never seemed to stop the men of my past!  That's good news.  Carrying so much of my love and expectations must have been so heavy for them, or not, I don't know.  They seemed to do it gladly. So, it belongs to everyone as it would no one.  The show can go on... Nice, huh? ;)  Main Entry: wretch·ed  Pronunciation: 're-ch&d Function: adjective Etymology: Middle English, irregular from wretch 1 : deeply afflicted, dejected, or distressed in body or mind 2 : extremely or deplorably bad or distressing     3 a : being or appearing mean, miserable, or contemptible   b : very poor in quality or ability : INFERIOR     *~*  by memory - No. NINETY-ONE: *~* Some glory in their birth, some in their skill, Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force. Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill; Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse. And every humor hath his adjunct pleasure Wherein it finds a joy above the rest But these particulars are not my measure All these I better in one general best. Thy love is better than high birth to me Richer than wealth, prouder than garments cost Of more delight than hawks or horses be. And having thee, of all men's pride I boast. Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take All this away, and me most wretched make.  ta-da!

      What's Shakin'... I often fascinate over perception.  For as much as people would like to think they'd all have a most unanimous agreement, on some of the most conventional thoughts there is no such thing.  One weekend more for the Shakes conundrum to close.  That is, THIS particular conundrum. I must be a prickly pear in this woman's garden, this SK. At the last session and before it even began, my scene partner and I were out front of the theatre and as this woman was driving in to the parking lot she rolled down the window and began verbal attack.  She didn't wait for the car to stop to park, or to get out.  The car was still in drive and the window went down and out flew her arrows. "DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO PRACTICE BEFORE A PERFORMANCE ON THAT SAME DAY, HASN'T ANYONE TOLD YOU!" and, specifically directed at my partner,  "HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU NOT TO PERFORM ON THE DAY OF A PERFORMANCE!" That was just the beginning...  Not much later my partner leaned toward me and said, "It seems that for some reason, whenever I am near you and SK is there, she says a lot of sharp, horrible things at you."  AH! See dear reader, it wasn't just me.   So I explained to him that I think she had a hang-up regarding a certain age issue, in the least.  Before, her anger and attacks were irritating to me.  A bit discouraging even.   I am sadly disappointed to now find that since her anger toward me has not subsided, its almost flattering and I am almost disappointed in myself that I find it funny.   Her pain should NOT be my humor. How could I be so important to her, why would she want to waste THAT attention on me?  Negative or not, that has to be exhaustive for her.  A friend of mine mentioned a Chinese herb that should help her balance out her menopause, and it only takes a year to transform someone. I'll have to ask her what it's called again 'cause I don't recall.  All I know is if I lose control like that in my future years to come, I'm heading for the local Chinese herbalist.  My theatre news is not all sour, dear reader! Because I took a risk.  A little one, but I did it!!   As I had rehearsed one of my male monologues, I decided the character needed a heavy dark blanket over his shoulders.  I envisioned something of an army blanket, the old dark green wool ones, or maybe a dark gray one.  I remember that because when I was little and my family would go to the beach, that was one of the blankets we'd use to lie on .. I don't own an army blanket.  So to the seminar I brought my couch throw blanket - it's a soft flannel in red and brown/beige checkers.   Before I stood up to show my monologue work, I kept thinking in my head that I should explain what I was going to do in my performance to the instructor.  But I recall in my independent studies that you are supposed to just show your work and explain afterwards, not in advance. So once my turn came I went to off stage right.  I put my throw over my shoulders... I was fighting that feeling, that I needed to explain myself or I wouldn't be understood.  I kept telling myself what mattered was what I was doing, not its explanation.  It didn't help either that it felt all too reminiscent of an image as to what it would be like as a 5-year-old boy playing Superman, this blanket draped over my shoulders as a make shift cape, preparing to jump off the edge of the couch.  I did my monologue.  It went well.  The instructor gently put his hands together and brought them to his lips and said, "May I ask, what's ... this?" and then he indicated to his shoulders like why did I put that around my neck.  I said, "Well in reading this monologue I feel that in his mourning he does have something heavy on his shoulders, and he needs a blanket, that's why I have a blanket over my shoulders."   He did mention that my character is seen wearing a black cloak of mourning. BINGO that is good too.  Army blanket, black mourning cloak, either way I have to shop for this costume prop!  Oh! Oh! and another good thought.  One of the students from the beginning seminar stopped by for assistance and SK asked me to help her since this girl was rehearsing the soliloquy I had performed the summer before. I remembered it all! I only stumbled over remembering one word but I recalled the whole soliloquy! And helping this girl felt like an infinitesimal second!  I think I would enjoy that... to know this creative work so well that when I show other people, that it feels the same way! There was no sense of time.  Haven't had that feeling in awhile ...

      At work today, a co-worker who saw me first thing gasped.   He first said, you look nice today!  I said oh thanks.   Then he said you're... you're  glowing ! Your face is glowing!  I said really? Maybe I got good sleep then.   We talked about our desk plants (LMAO at office small talk) Then he said and you smell good too!  Seems an alien experience! haa haahaa...! It's been months since someone had told me my face was glowing.  Come to think of it, only that previous time do I recall someone telling me my face glowed, but of course I wasn't at the office... Ah!

      My last relationship ended just this past spring...in case the title above was at all misleading ;)  Part 1: Planets and Aspects  Sun Semisquare Saturn  This aspect is an indication that by being together you will share very powerful learning experiences which should not be taken lightly. Yours may very well be a fated and unavoidable relationship as well. Your relationship may be short-termed or long, but understand that Sun/Saturn bonds are not easily broken and they tend to bind you together for good or ill.  Your relationship together will expose facets of your personalities that you were unaware of and that you may not want to face. If you can take this opportunity to learn and grow, then you will discover a great deal about your faults and weaknesses. And the only way to overcome your weaknesses is to squarely face them and resolve to correct what needs correcting.  If you are looking for a foot-loose and fancy-free relationship, then don't enter into this one because you are likely to feel like a dog on a leash, and a short one at that. Limitations and confinement surround this aspect and unless you are looking for a little discipline, then it would be better to leave that to the boot camp drill instructor. Make no mistake, with this aspect there will be times when you feel you are restrained and confined just like in prison.   On a positive note, if you have been irresponsible and immature, then this relationship will show you the error of your ways and how you can improve. There is nothing like a little maturity to help us be better people. If your experience together is needed as part of a master plan, then you may very well have a long association. If not, then your relationship may be short-lived.  You may very well blame each other for all of the difficulties within your relationship. Each of you may see the other as the controller, the manipulator, the disapproving authority figure, the judge and jury, the stick in the mud who has no sense of humor at all. Constant duties, obligations and responsibilities may sap all the life out of your being together, yet you may continue to do them as though you were driven by some slave driver. This aspect does give a sense of security and that sense should not be taken lightly.  Personal one-on-one attachment, affection, fondness and tenderness will be lost to responsibility and hard work. This might be good in a working business partnership, but in a close personal relationship feelings will probably suffer.  You can expect a great deal of struggle, hardship and having to overcome adversity at every turn. One of you may very well become a great burden to the other in some way, thus helping them or yourself to mature and become more self-reliant.  Financial hardships, possible chronic health, oppression, obligations, and restrictions sum up the balance of this configuration. Yet this aspect does give you the power to endure and to overcome.  ...YIKES! haa haa haaa.
