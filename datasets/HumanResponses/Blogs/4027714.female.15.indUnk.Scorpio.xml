        At the request of my wonderful anonymous friend (Kathleen), I have been asked to post her popcorn theory so that everyone will understand what I was talking about in my previous entry.&nbsp; And without furthur ado, here it is:         Kathleen's Popcorn Theory    So you walk into a movie theater.&nbsp; And of course they have the concession stand right there as you walk in so you can immediately see the food and smell the delicious popcorn.&nbsp; And you see all the lines for the food and popcorn and you decide, "Well, everyone else is having some and it smells so good, why shouldn't I buy some?"&nbsp; You just came from McDonald's where you'd had a huge, fatty Big Mac, and a mega sized fry and drink, so you decide to only get a small popcorn.&nbsp; So you get to the front of the line, and you order a small popcorn, and of course you have to have a drink as well because what if you get thirsty? and a small drink.&nbsp; But the person behind the counter says," You can get a medium popcorn and a medium drink for only $0.50 more."&nbsp; And living in the economical times of the U.S. that we do, you decide, "It's only 50 cents," not even thinking of the amount of popcorn and drink you are buying.&nbsp; And then teh person behind the counter says, "We have a special deal!&nbsp; You can get a large popcorn and a large soda for only such-and-such a price."&nbsp; Well, being the American you are, you can't do math that quick in your head, so you pull out a calculator, do some quick math, and decide that you'd be saving money!&nbsp; Of course, the thought that you really aren't that hungry and that you really don't want all that food, you only think of the money you save.&nbsp; Then again, you could have saved even more only getting the small popcorn and small drink you had originally decided upon, or not even spending any money not getting any food that you really don't need because you really aren't hungry after all those fatty high-caloric foods you ate at Mickey D's.&nbsp; So you walk into the theater loaded down with your large popcorn and large drink to see another remake of a movie that was made years ago (because Hollywood's run out of ideas).&nbsp; And once the movie is over, you walk out, and you have finished your whole popcorn and drink because you did not want all your money to go to waste.&nbsp; The next weekend you go see a movie again, and you fall for the scam all over again.&nbsp; Eventually, with all your "no cooking nights" and various other reasons for eating out and the movies scam, your stomach starts to enlarge.&nbsp; And since your stomach grows bigger, you need to eat more.&nbsp; And the more you eat the larger your stomach grows adn the more your stomach grows the more you need to eat.&nbsp; It's such a vicious cycle.&nbsp; And eventually, you've outgrown the largest sizes on the rack in the Plus Plus section of Kohl's.&nbsp; Then you have a heart attack because of obesity and high cholesterol, and you die 700 pounds overweight, not able to lift yourself up from your couch any longer and with diabetes.&nbsp; The End.&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Hello, my friends!&nbsp; Well, summer boredom has finally got the best of me, so I'm starting my very own blog, because what's better than opening up your life to the whole world?&nbsp; That's what I thought.&nbsp; Anyways I just finished two straight days of defensive driving with Master Drive.&nbsp; Very long days, I might add... Sitting in a car for 8 hours can become very uncomfortable.&nbsp; But all in all it was tons of fun, and I managed not to hit anything other than the cones.&nbsp; (Heh, I know you're wondering just how many I hit - but I shall never tell! Mwahaha!)&nbsp; I'd also like to add that I can now park a car expertly, thanks to the instructors giving me THE WORST parking space EVER.&nbsp; I thought I was just being retarded, since I was the only one who couldn't seem to park their car, until the instructors told me that they PURPOSELY gave me the most difficult parking space in the whole range...!&nbsp; I was pretty upset, but I figured it out, so... whatever.&nbsp; I still have 3 more 8 hour days of just classroom time for Master Drive, then another 6 hours on the street with an instructor.&nbsp; Urgh, I had no idea that driver's ed was so time consuming.&nbsp; Oh well, at least I know I'm getting my money's worth.     &nbsp;   School starts up again in two weeks, and I am sooooo not ready.&nbsp; I can't believe it's already junior year!&nbsp; I'm so sad I can't play volleyball anymore :(.&nbsp; I've had nothing to do this whole summer except watch movies!&nbsp; And I felt really bad because I was planning on seeing a movie with Emily, but I had already seen all of them (except for the pre-teen ones hehe).&nbsp; It was all good, though...we walked around the mall and visited the bedding section of every department store and reminisced over our pre-teen days by taking a walk through Claire's and The Icing.&nbsp; It was quite fun.&nbsp; And I also discovered scratch'n'sniff underwear, but I won't go into that...&nbsp;     &nbsp;   When IRobot came out, I went and saw it with Kathleen, who (despite her popcorn theory) buys an awful lot of popcorn at the movies, hehe.&nbsp; I also saw Shrek 2 and Anchorman with her, although Anchorman wasn't as good as I expected.&nbsp; All the same, it was still quite hilarious.&nbsp; I think I might see Catwoman with her, too.&nbsp; It sounded like she wanted to see that, but I convinced her into seeing Anchorman instead...   &nbsp;   I do miss my best buddies Julie, Julianne, and Stephanie.&nbsp; I haven't seen them since our crazy camping adventure over a month ago (haha brings back such memories...).&nbsp; We are the WORST truth-or-dare players EVER, heheh.&nbsp; None of us are brave enough to take a dare, but we all suck at coming up with questions for truth!&nbsp; All of our questions were like, "Which guy would you rather kiss: Disgusting Boy #1 or Equally Disgusting Boy #2?"&nbsp; Heheh, and we just kept naming off all the&nbsp;disgusting boys we could think of in our quest to stay awake the whole night.&nbsp; I think we eventually fell alseep around 3 or 4 in the morning, after much fighting over a flashlight.&nbsp; Then I woke up around 6 and tried to wake up everyone else, but I only succeeded in getting up Stephanie, who proceeded to pour cold water all over Julie and Julianne in order to wake them up.&nbsp; Much water fighting ensued.&nbsp; Then we left to go mountain biking, which actually turned out to be more like "walk your mountain bike through this mad hard trail."&nbsp; Ah well, it's all good, we still had fun.&nbsp; Well, no, actually we didn't have fun during the bike ride... but it is fun to look back on it.&nbsp; Kind of.      Well, I'd best be going... I want to try and get as much sleep as possible before school starts agian...

       Hello again my friends!  School is officially back in session and my feelings for it haven't changed a bit.  But first... my last two days of summer!  On Tuesday I went to Emily's house for a couple hours and she showed me all of her pictures from California and Minnesota!  It was so much fun - she has the greatest stories to tell, I love it...  Anyways, right after I left Emily's house I went straight to MasterDrive for my on-street lesson.  Since it was my first time, I drove around residential areas.  Right when I pulled out from the parking lot, I saw a squirrel, so I slowed down and let it cross the street.  Then I was about to speed up again, but the squirrel ran farther up the street ahead of me, and I wasn't sure if it would cross the street again, so I ended up driving at about 10 miles per hour for the whole street!  Yeah, I felt really stupid, but my instructor didn't seem to mind, so it was all good.  Then when I reached my first stop sign, I wasn't used to the brakes on the car, so I didn't stop nearly in time.  My instructor was like, "Now, when there's no stop line and no sidewalk, where are you supposed to stop?"  "Uh...behind the stop sign," I mumbled, looking guilty.  "Right, and are you behind the stop sign?"  "No...." I said, embarrassed.  "Okay, then let's try to work on that next time."  "...Okay..."  So, yeah, my lessons didn't exactly get off to the best start, but I did pretty well for the rest of the time.  Except for that time I was speeding a little bit.  40 mph in a 30 mph zone... that's not too bad... *shifty eyes*  Hahaha actually my instructor said that I did really well overall, except for the one stop sign incident.  Then I got in the backseat and watched another girl do parking and backing, which is what I'll be doing next time, hurrah!    Then after I got back from driving lessons, I went miniature golfing with Julianne and Stephanie.  Twas quite fun.  It cost $5 per person, but Stephanie had a 5, I had a 10, and Julianne had a 20.  But the cashier lady had some mad skill, so she just took all our money at once and we all ended up getting back what we needed.  It was pretty impressive.  Anyways, after the first couple holes we realized that it would be pretty pointless to keep score, since we all sucked.  So we started aiming for random objects and re-mapping the ball's course to the hole.  "I'm gonna try to hit that buffalo's tail"  "Do you think I could putt it across all those rocks?"  Hahaha it was pretty fun.  We were considering going to a different course and not paying for it, but the lady was watching us, so we decided to do the honest thing and pay (which we would have done anyways!)  But it turned out for the better, because we all got a discount since we got some hole-in-one's.  While we were golfing, Stephanie and Julianne concocted a plan to set me up with Stephen again, muahaha.  At first they planned to get a big group to go to the movies, then have everyone except me and Stephen leave to get popcorn or go to the bathroom.  I thought that would be kinda obvious, so we changed the plan.  We decided that, since we liked mini golf so much, we would come back with a bigger group of people.  But since we're only allowed four people to a group, me and Stephen would just get stuck all by ourselves.  Aww.  Anyways, we're planning on doing this on Friday... it should be fun.    Oh, poo... it's getting pretty late, and I have school again tomorrow, so I'll write later about my first day of school.

       Gosh, I can't believe there's only three more days till school starts again...! I'm trying to cram in as much summer fun as I can in the time I have left, but it's turning out to be pretty tough. Julianne and I planned to do something today, but my mom made me a doctor's appointment today (grr). So when I got home I tried to call Julianne, but she wasn't home! Or maybe she just didn't want to talk to me. Whatever. Anyways, I'm planning on hanging out with Emily tomorrow, but I probably won't be able to spend more than a few hours with her, because I have to complete my MasterDrive on-street session tomorrow at 1:00. And Emily has volleyball later that night. Oh well. I'm kinda looking foreward to the on-street session of MasterDrive. I'm glad all of their cars are automatics, because I don't think my instructor would be too happy with my shifting abilities. But I think I'm a lot better at shifting than I was a month ago, so yay! At least on-street will be more exciting than the classroom. I did the classroom last week, and it was SO boring! I sat next to this guy, Hugh. He was a pretty funny kid hehe. We both arrived early, so we were just sitting there waiting for class to start. Then he just randomly turned to me and said "Hi! What's your name?" "I'm Katherine." "Katherine. Hi Katherine!" "Hi..." Then there was an akward silence while I waited for him to give me his name. But he didn't. So I asked him. "What's your name?" "My name's Hugh! I'm Hugh." "...Hi Hugh." "Hi Katherine! Nice to meet you!" "...Um...yeah..." "I went to etiquette school, and they taught us that when you're alone with someone, you should try to make conversation." Haha, I honestly could not hold back my laughter when he said that. I just burst out laughing. I felt sooo bad, but Hugh was cool about it. He was actually a really nice guy, and not nearly as weird as his first impression seemed, heheh. Not to mention he had gorgeous eyes... *sigh* I don't think I would have made it through that class without him.    On Saturday, Julianne and I volunteered at the zoo for a walkathon. We were assigned to the T-Shirt booth, and I think we were a pretty good team. I took the people's tickets, signed them, and put them in the box, while Julianne gave people a T-Shirt in their desired size. We were out in the sun for the whole morning, so I tried to even out my god awful tan line, but alas - no success! But it was seriously really hot out there; Julianne and I were reminded of that horrible bike ride at the beginning of June. We were finally allowed to leave the T-Shirt table at lunch time, so Julianne, my mom and I headed off to the bathrooms, and on the way we discovered that volunteers were allowed free massages by a pro massage therapist! It didn't feel as nice as I expected. He worked on my ankles, and that really hurt - then he massaged my legs, and that tickles soooo badly! Then he finally got to my back, and that was actually pretty relaxing, for the most part. Every once in a while he hit a ticklish spot on me, but nothing like when he massaged my legs. When he finished, my ankles hurt so bad... but I was able to walk it off. We all walked up to the pavillion, where pizza was promised for lunch, but it hadn't arrived yet, so Julianne and I set off to feed the giraffes. We walked up this huuuge hill, only to find that they moved the giraffes! They were at the very bottom of the hill! So, we walked back to the pavillion, ate lunch, and left. Afterwards, we went and saw The Village. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected. Ah well, we ran into Kathleen and Jennee on our way out, so we had a nice chat with them. Then I went home and had a nice long nap, considering I had been up since 5:00 that morning...    Well, I gotta go, I'll write more later...

       A particle of dust just attacked me. It flew up my nose. I sneezed.    Anyways, my past week has been pretty uneventful (if you couldn't tell heheh). I rented Secret Window (Johnny Depp *drool*) and The Butterfly Effect (Ashton Kutcher *drool*), which provided me with hours upon hours of entertainment. I watched The Butterfly Effect, then I watched the director's cut of The Butterfly Effect, then I watched The Butterfly Effect with the directors' commentary. Then I amused myself by watching all those nifty behind-the-scenes featurettes. Some of them were cool (like the visual FX stuff), but some of them were just boring (they actually interviewed psychotherapists about the appeal of time travel - I mean, do you really need a professional to tell you that time travel ROCKS?) Then I repeated the whole process with Secret Window, but that was much less entertaining than the Butterfly Effect, because the director of Secret Window is such a geek... He had no idea what he was talking about. I'm confident that his film would have SUCKED had it not been for his freakishly large budget (he had ANIMATED friggin' storyboards, for God's sake!). But maybe that's just me. Oh well, I enjoyed the movie nonetheless.    So, yeah. Basically, all I did was watch those two movies from Saturday to Monday. Then on Tuesday I slept in ridiculously late (muahaha I love summer) and I went to volunteer training for a walkathon that I'm going to be helping out with this Saturday. Julianne's also volunteering with me, so we went to training together. Twas quite interesting. All the people there were old and senile, and I kept thinking, "How the hell are these people going to be able to run a check-in and registration booth?" But apparently they've volunteered before, so maybe I'm just not giving them enough credit. Muahaha, there was this girl there named Christine, and her laugh is so crazy! Ack, I can't even describe it - but it's hilarious! Julianne and I kept looking at each other and trying not to laugh, but...wow, that girl's laugh is seriously insane.  Mkay, last night I had a super strange dream. Heh, most of you already know my history of having weird dreams ("I dream of teachers" haha, Emily!), but this one seriously freaked me out. In my dream, my family and I were watching a movie that strangely resembled The Butterfly Effect, but in my dream's version of the movie, the little boy's dad walked out on the family. So the next day, my dad took me driving and were talking, nothing unusual. Then my dad starts talking about the movie we watched, and he was like, "You know how in the movie, that dad walked out on his family?" and I was like, "Yeeah..." and my dad said, "Well how would you feel if I did that to you?" I was like, "OH MY GOD THERE IS NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA WALK OUT ON US!!!" And he said, "Well, I'm really sorry, but I met a girl in jail (muahaha I have NO idea where my subconcious came up with THAT...) and I'm in love with her. She's really young, and she has a little boy, so I'm going to move to Florida and help her raise her son." Whoa. Okay... So I go tell my brother that our father is leaving us, and Adam said, "Well, duh. Me and Mom have known for about two weeks." He and my mom were SO calm about it! I mean, I was on the verge of spontaneous combustion! Well, about a week after my father left us, I decided I would drive down to Florida and visit him and his new family. But I didn't know where he lived, so I had to visit some other people who were in prison, and I asked them things like, "Do you remember any friends you made while you were in jail?" When I finally tracked down my father's new wife's address, I went to MapQuest.com and got driving instructions. Then I got my wallet, hopped in my car, and started driving. I stopped only for gas - no food, no sleep. So when I arrived, I was walking around this shopping outlet, saying horrible things under my breath, so this guy in front of me turned around and gave me a really dirty look. Then I stopped saying bad things. Then I walked into a Hallmark store, where I found my father hanging out with his new wife and son (about 7 years old). I completely ignored my father and went straight to the girl, who saw how angry I looked, but held out her hand for me to shake anyways. Well I ignored that, too, and I gave her a hug. Then when I was about to talk to the little boy, I woke up. Which really sucked, because I was planning on saying some really nasty things to that kid. Oh well.    Omg, today we had this mad thunderstorm...it was awesome. The thunder was like, nonstop, and the rain was SO heavy. Then it started hailing, and it started to pile up really quickly - it looked just like snow in our backyard. Muahaha, my brother was watching was the news and the forcaster guy was like, "The worst part of the storm is right between these two streets," and my brother starts jumping up and down, "Oh my gosh! That's where we are! We're in the very worst part of the storm!" Haha, it was great...    Anyways, I have to wake up super early tomorrow because I have to take the classroom part of Master Drive. Eight hours of people telling you not to drink and drive...hurrah. So, I'd best be going to bed about now. Lay-uhz! (muahaha Julie, I haven't said that in forever...)
