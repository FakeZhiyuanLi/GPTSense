      The notion that the Regressive Conservative Party of Canada or the Alliance-Conservative Party could legitimately form the Governemnt of Canada is a truly scary thought ... a thought that propelled me into walking to a Liberal campaign office (after all - being a man, I got lost as hell ... I'll admit it!). As a senhor, who has always been politically active, I have never once campaigned for a political party - however this election really does chill my spine.  Firstly, there is the notion of homosexual rights. A dear friend of mine, Caitlin Hersey, once professed (in her usual brilliant manner) that the idea of homophobia is simply a way to look down upon a minority group. If there is one treasurable truth in this nation it is that we have a Charter of Rights of Freedoms - a charter which categorically and emphatically declares that the rights of the minuet in this glorious nation must never be trampled by the majority (ie. heterosexuals). The fact that this individual wishes to be Prime Minister because he believes homosexuality to be some sort of intolerable crime, I simply recall that history has often looked poorly upon those who discriminate solely based on bigotry and so called moral intolerance.  Naturally, there is of course a load of other issues being presented by this man - such as, invoking the non-with standing clause, working with the Bloc, re-opening the debate on abortion (in my opinion a fundamental right that women have and one that is so intrinsically important to Women's Rights, we must and cannot afford to take this way) and lastly scrapping the Kyoto Accord - for and I quote: "The Harper Policy."  However, even with these conservative social policies, aren't the conservatives supposed to be economically fiscal as well? However the overly positive surplus predictions of the Harper Regressive Conservatives (predictions which nearly every economist in this country have declared unrealistic) will only lead this country into a massive economic hole - a hole, which the only ways it can be plugged are either: eliminating the "entire budgets of citizenship and immigration, foreign affairs, justice, environment, fisheries and oceans, heritage, natural resources and industry combined," or simply plunging Canada into decades more of massive debts which will only cripple our nation for future generations. Predicting the Canadian surplus to grow at a rate that it has never grown in the history of Canada is unrealistic and it vastly irresponsbile of a party which wishes to form the government.   On June 28th, don't vote a government out - simply because you are mad at them. Examine the platforms. Look at the options presented and ask yourself:   "What kind of Canada do you want?"   Do you want a Canada which is socially and economically progressive, or one headed by an ignorant, homophobic and pro-life Harper government - a government which will change the fundamental pillars of Canadian society to a degree that we might not even recognise the truly liberally society we have built over the last decade?   Harper said that when he is through, Canadians "won't recognise Canada." Mr. Harper you might be right but I'll be damned if I have your Canada.
