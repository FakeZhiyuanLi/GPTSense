       GOAL 1) Diet and exercise - 6/10: I cheated three out of five days, but only a little each day. I did my walking 2/5 days, and even worked up a sweat once. In the WW board vernacular I'm at 209/198/130.  GOAL 2) Time with the kids 8/10 - I had some great times with my children this week. We worked and played together. Alaric and I have plans for Saturday night to go out stargazing. It should be a lot of fun.  GOAL 3) Take pictures 0/10 - Not a single one, no movies, nothing.  GOAL 4) Writing  0/10 - Nope, once again, I thought a lot of things through, but nothing got onto paper.  GOAL 5) Keeping work at work 4/10 - I started making the arrangements to work in the office full time, but I am still wasting a lot of work time that could be more productive.  So this week averages out to a 3.6/10. Next week, I'm going to shoot for a 5.

       Well, I remembered to wear the stepometer – good start.  7:30 – big glass of 1% milk. At least South Beach lets me have milk. That’s one of the things that just killed me on Atkins.  9:00 – Hungry – brushed my teeth. That should put off the cravings for another hour or so. Checking the steps, it’s only 878 so far. At this rate, I’ll have 10,000 steps in about four days…  10:15 – Breakfast/morning snack: 2 mini quiches and 15 almonds. 1247 steps so far. Only 8800 to go today. Maybe I’ll start with a more modest goal of 5,000.   12:45 – lunch ad Red Robin. I ordered the Cobb salad, and I let them bring the bread. I’ve been feeling run down in the afternoons and had serious blood-sugar headaches. I planned to walk those carbs off as soon as I get home.  2:15 – arrived home, played in the backyard with the dog and the baby for about 30 minutes. Came inside exhausted and sunburned. 4,800 steps so far. Drank a Diet Coke so I wouldn’t doze off while the baby played.  4:00 tried the “Mocha ricotta crème” from the SB cookbook. Bleh! I think I’d rather just skip the sweets if they taste like that.  6:00 – dinner: grilled pork chops and spinach salad.

       I'm supposed to be keeping a food and exercize journal. I'm not doing so well. Here's what I have for this whole week so far:  Sunday, 5/16/2004 8:00am – 2 scrambled eggs, with cheddar cheese, 2 slices of tomato, Diet Coke  12:00pm – 6 almonds  1:00pm – salad (lettuce, tuna, 5 grape tomatoes, cucumbers), Diet Coke  6:00pm – beef tenderloin wrapped around asparagus spears with horseradish sauce, green salad with ¼ tomato and ranch dressing, water.  9:00pm – sugar free jello cup  Monday, 5/17/2004 Weigh in: 199 (Work scale, fully dressed)  7:30am – Dannon “Lite N Fit” sugar free cherry vanilla yogurt, 15 almonds, Diet Coke. Finished off the water in my bottle  9:15am – fresh green beans, fresh bottle of water.  9:45am – STILL HUNGRY  11:00am – Cobb salad, water, string cheese. STILL HUNGRY. There’s nothing left I can eat.  2:00pm – grocery store – STILL HUNGRY. Bought port wine cheese spread to put on cucumbers  3:00pm – port wine cheese spread on cucumber rounds  5:00pm – dinner at McDonalds. Fiesta salad, only took off about ¾ of the tortilla strips. Also 1.5 chocolate chip cookies and they tasted WONDERFUL!!!!!!!! Heaven is the food you’re not allowed to eat. /sigh. Also snagged a couple of Liam’s fries. Back on the diet tomorrow, really. No more trips to McD’s for me until I can resist the temptations.  6:00pm – had to test the veggie quiche cups I just made. They’re pretty good, but next time, I double the eggs and add a bit more salt. I’m going to fall asleep – Diet Coke.  9:00pm – Big glass of 1% milk.  Tuesday, 5/18/2004 Mood, disappointed. No cheating today. I have lunch with the boss at 11:00. I’m going to push for someplace diet-friendly. I got really, REALLY hungry yesterday. I had a headache and I was totally wiped out by the time I got home. I’m going to make sure I have more food today. I’m also saving at least one of my snacks for the drive home when I’m used to having something in the car.  7:00 – Big glass of 1% milk.  6:00pm – Dinner at Applebees. The worst meal out I’ve had in I don’t know how long. Service was slow. When my steak arrived it was like beef jerky. I couldn’t eat it, so I sent the plate back to be cooked actually medium. When she brought it back, the steak was fine, but she hadn’t replaced the vegetables, so I had limp, dead veggies that were left over from the previous serving. Needless to say, she didn’t get much of a tip that time.  Wednesday, 5/19/2004 Disappointed again. I haven’t been keeping track, and I haven’t been exercising.  Breakfast was 2 scrambled eggs and my left-over steak. Lunch I don’t remember. Snack was a handful of Liam’s Teddy Grahams. Yes, I know they’re not South-Beach.  Dinner was chicken scampi and a spinach salad with a glass of 1% milk.  In the afternoon, I took the dog and the boys for a walk. That dog is exhausting.  Back on track for Thursday, honest.   I'm going to keep better track today. I have a stepometer to measure my steps - 10,000 a day, right? And I'm going to actually track excatly what I eat and when. I know if I write down all my food and exercise, I'll stay on track better.  As for the other resolutions... Well, I am spending more time with the boys, and that's good, but everything else is just going along status quo.  Ho Hum.

       I made these New Year Resolutions, but I haven't done a very good job keeping them up:  1) I will lose weight and be healthy this year.  •	By December 31, 2004, I will weigh less than 150 lbs. •	I will exercise in some way every day - even if it's only a 15 minute walk. •	I will not eat fast food more than twice per week, and when I do, I will choose lower-fat options  2) I will spend more time listening to Alaric and less time yelling.   3) I will take and send more pictures of the boys. •	I will make sure there's a new picture of both of them at least once a week. •	I will take movies of both boys at least once a month •	I will get pictures to the grandparents at least once a month  4) I will write every day. •	Today, I start an electronic writing journal. I'll write out all my ideas and thoughts on writing in it, and will put at least 10 minutes into it every day. •	I will send my story to WOC again, hoping they are accepting new submissions now. •	I will enter at least one contest or anthology each month - even if I have to send out the same story or essay multiple times. •	I will write at least 40,000 words in my book by the end of September. (the whole book should be 80,000 - 100,000 words)  5) I will do more work at work and less work at home •	I will not visit message boards at work, so that my work gets done more quickly •	I will get up with my alarm and be in the office by 6:30 at least three mornings a week, until I am so ingrained in the habit that I am here at 6:30 every day, then I will begin working on being here by 6:00am so that I can leave at 2:30 and be done. •	When I am working at home, I will work at the kitchen table and watch the time so that I don't spend more than 8 hours per day on work

       Last week, I sucked in a way I have not sucked in many weeks.   Weekly summary of how I'm doing:   Weight: 191 - Down 1 lb from last week. At this rate, I'm, not going to make either my mini goal of 150 by Dec 31 or my ultimate goal of 129 by May 30, 2005. I think I ate off my deit 4/7 days this week, and when I fall down on dieting, I PLUMET! Sonic, ice cream with chocolate sauce, nachos... Bleh!   Fitness-wise, I also sucked:   And I lost my pedometer, so I can't track my steps anymore. I've got a pretty good idea of whether I reach my 10,000 goal or not, but I can't measure it until I get a new one.   Friday - 30 minute treadmill walk with weights, 20 minutes pilates  Saturday - Nothing significant  Sunday - 2 mile run. Timed at 32:08. Still only counts as a "walking" pace on any fitness tracking website, but it's 4 minutes better than the first one.  Monday - 30 minute treadmill walk with wieghts, 20 minutes pilates  Tuesday - 30 minute treadmill walk with wieghts. I was supposed to run through the neighborhood, but it was raining cats and dogs, so I skipped it and did nothing instead. (I suck)  Wednesday - Got on the treadmill. After about 5 minutes, my calves rebelled and I gave up and went back to work. Nothing in the evening. (I suck again)  Thursday - Got on the treadmill. Went about 17 minutes and realized it was a running night. So I rationalized I didn't need it and turned it off. I then had the brilliant idea that the babysitter doesn't live that far away, so I hooked up the trailer to the bike, and rode the 2.5 miles to her house, picked up the baby and rode the 2.5 miles back. There are a hell of a lot more hills in our neighborhood than I ever realized. I thought for sure I was going to die before I got home. When I did, my quads were so tired, I couldn't get up the stairs. I turned on some music and watched the baby tear up the living room for the next two hours.  Friday - 30 minute treadmill walk, on low speed - 2.5 MPH, 1% grade. (I suck). Skipped Pilates. (I suck twice in one day - BAH!)   Goal 1 - 5/10 Goal 2 - 7/10 again. Not perfect, but I've definately been having some fun with the kids. Goal 3: Taking and sending pictures 0/10 again - (I told you I suck) Goal 4: Writing - Not so good this week. I've written the same scene over and over again and I can't get it right. 3/10 Goal 5: More work at work and less at home - 10/10 again. Nice to know I can do SOMETHING right.  Weekly average: 5.00

       I don't know what the change is. Maybe it's because, for the first time, I'm keeping a written log of my efforts, or maybe it's the diet finally working like it's supposed to. Maybe it's the weather. I can't say, but I think that for the first time in my life, I'm actually succeeding in changing my lifestyle for the better.  Today's story:  There's a man in our office who is an avid runner. He runs at least 1 marathon a year, and regularly participates in 5K and 10K races. He's also old enough to be my father.   Today, while I was doing my walk with hand weights on the treadmill in the office, he came in to stretch for his daily run and we got to talking about running. He runs 4-5 miles every day at 12:30, at a pace somewhere between 7-9 minutes/mile. I mentioned. laugingly, that I had almost broken the 16 minute mile mark. I thought he'd see it as a joke, but he didn't think that it was funny. On the contrary, his response was totally encouraging. He said if I took off time each week, I was doing it right, and that's the way he started -  when he was my age!  He asked if I had noticed that I kept up the whole conversation with him  while walking AND continuing to lift my weights  without breaking stride or sounding winded. Before he headed out for his run, he said that whenever I was ready, he'd love to have me join him. :)  Somehow, I've always thought that "real" runners and athletes were looking down on me. I've felt like an outside in fitness conversations of any kind.  For the first time in as long as I can remember, meeting with someone who is in demonstrably better shape than me didn't make me feel like quitting. For the first time, I looked at him and said "I'm getting there. My work will pay off and eventually, I'm going to be running as well as he does."   When I finished my walk, and was changing my shoes in the locker room, it hit me that the change wasn't in the way other athletes respond to me. The change is in me. I don't know what to call it, or how to attribute the change, but I'm different. I'm ready for a new me now, and that changes everything.

       192 - Down 3 lbs from last week, The WW online site actually told me to slow down, I'm losing too fast. I think they're full of it. I know 1-2 lbs a week is ideal after the "first two weeks" of a weight loss plan, but my first two weeks sucked. These are the first two weeks that I'm really following the plan, so I'm OK with the loss being a bit more rapid. I know I won't sustain this pace, but if I can even lose an average of 1.5 lbs per week, I'll be in a size 10 by Christmas.  Fitness-wise, I did alright this week:  Friday - 45 minutes walking with Liam around the track for a total of 2 miles. ~8,700 steps Saturday - Break, and hardly any walking ~4,900 steps Sunday - 2 mile baseline run - 36 minutes for 2 miles ~ 9,000 steps Monday - 15 min treadmill walk, lots of time cleaning up all evidence of the dog, but I took Harley back to the pound so I was too wiped to exercise. ~7,000 steps Tuesday - 30 minutes on the treadmill, 25 minute walk/jog through the neighborhood ~11,000 steps Wednesday - 30 minute brisk walk on the treadmill with 3 lb free weights through the first and last 10 minutes. 20 minute Winsor Pilates workout. ~8,700 steps Thursday - 30 minute brisk walk on the treadmill (Moved up to level 3). I couldn't stand the thought of trying Pilates again, so I capped the day at ~6,000 steps.  So, on goal 1 - 9/10 Goal 2 - Well Alaric wasn't home until Tuesday evening, but we've had some fun. I've been letting him have time on my computer with Jon while I exercise. I took him out to dinner yesterday and we had a pretty good time. I have been lax on letting him get electronics this week. Next week we're on to some "real" activities. Goal 2: 7/10 Goal 3: Taking and sending pictures 0/10 - bleh! Goal 4: Writing - I've gotten better. My "Angel" story is starting to take shape. I started a summary of it and I'm ready to get going on the first chapters. 4/10 Goal 5: More work at work and less at home - I've done no work at home and not missed any deadlines at work this week! Yippie! 10/10  Average for the week: 6/10. Not bad.  Next week -- I keep up the good work on the fitness front, and concentrate on improving the writing.

       I've reached a terrible decision.  Today, our dog of four months, Harley Quinn goes back to the Humane Society.  She ate my shoes - I lived with that and learned to keep them out of her reach.  She tore up the landscaping - we paid to have it repaired and learned to constantly supervise her outdoor time.  She got ON the dining room table and ate the pork roast I'd cooked for a dinner party - we laughed and ordered pizza.  She peed on the carpets - we trained her to go outside.  She ate the cord to my brand new steam cleaner - I paid the $40 to have a new cord puton and kept it out of her reach.  She knocked the baby down all the time - even on the stairs - I tried to keep her away from him.  This weekend, she irreperably destroyed a cushion on the $1500 sofa - the only piece of nice furniture left in the house. I guess she was bored. She bit the baby trying to take a tennis ball away from him. She didn't mean to, but she doesn't know her own strength. She chased the older cat into a corner, knocked her off the ledge from the second floor to the first and sprained her back leg - or worse. The cat has been limping for two days and is going to the vet this afternoon. Harley probably thought Lady was just playing.  She's out. I won't have that dog in my house any more. I'm sorry, and I feel more guilty than anyone could possibly imagine - both because I should never have brought her home in the first place and because I'm ducking out of my responsibilty for her be taking her away. It's come to the point where everyone else in the family is paying the price for my bad decision and I simply have to end that.  At heart, Harley is an outdoor dog, and we have an indoor life. She needs wide open spaces, and maybe even some work to do. She needs a place with no cats to terrorize - or where at least the cats have claws to defend themselves. She need to only be around kids who are old enough to defend themselves from a very strong and active dog.  If we ever get a dog again, we'll have to choose much more carefully. I like working breeds because they're so smart, but we don't have the lifestyle that suits them. The next dog will be a much smaller breed, and one that prefers an indoor lifestyle. The next dog will only come into our lives after meeting the whole family, and only after a lot of breed research. And it won't happen for at least five years - when Liam's old enough to fend for himself a bit.  I know some people are going to think I'm selfish and irresponsible. I know I do. I have to choose among all my responsibilities, and I've reached the conclusion that it's more irresponsible for me to keep Harley as if she were a form of punishment for my impulsiveness than it is for me to take the chance that we might all end up happier.  Colorado Humane Society is a no-kill shelter. I know she won't end up getting green-needled. She's a young, smart, house-trained and kennel-trained dog. She has a chance.

       Calling it a run is a real stretch. I managed to jog the first 100 meters of every lap, so in total, I ran about 1/2 mile, but I did make 8 laps around the high school track, which comes up to a total of 2 miles, if I remember my high school gym classes correctly.  Total time: 36:18 - there's an 18 minute mile for you.  I know, I suck. I'm fat and out of shape. It's nothing for me to be embarassed about, because I'm working change it. I'll get better. I have a training schedule downloaded from the web. It's a 12-week training schedule designed to get you ready for a 10K. My 10K is almost a year away, so I took that 12-week schedule and expanded it to fit my schedule. The basics are:    Sunday  - distance running: Start with 2 miles and add 1/4 mile every other week until I'm at 7 miles each Sunday.  Monday  - Cross training or walking: For me that's a 2 mile bike ride with Liam in the trailer, or 45 mintues walking on the treadmill  Tuesday  - 20 minute cross-country run: Start at 20 minutes and increase gradually to 45 minutes.  Wednesday  - Cross training: Pilates DVD (40 min)  Thursday  - Same as Tuesday  Friday  - Same as Monday  Saturday  - off

       Well, I've done OK this week so far. Since my disaster of a Sunday, I've stayed within my Weight Watchers points every day this week eating only SB-friendly foods, except that I have allowed myself one miniature dark chocolate with my afternoon almonds. I have gotten some definate exercise each day.   Weigh in this morning: 195 - that's a total of 14 lbs gone. Not bad, I say.  Friday - 2 mile walk/jog on treadmill with weights ~7,200 steps/day  Saturday - 3 mile outdoor walk ~9,400 steps total/day  Sunday - 4 mile outdoor walk ~11,500 steps total/day  Monday - 2.5 miles on treadmill walk/jog with weights ~9,500 steps total/day  Tuesday - 50 minutes strenuous lap swimming ~6,900 steps total/day  Wednesday - Easy day: 3/4 mile jog with dog ~7,000 steps total/day    Today I have a 30 minute treadmill walk/jog planned, and then a 5 mile hike with the dog in the evening. I should more than break 10,000 steps with that - not to mention get a serious upper-body workout from tugging the stupid leash.

       198 This morning.  Not a single pound lost. I know I'm not following the diet, but I am getting far more exercise than in the past. I walk on the treadmill, I walk the dog, i take the kids to the park and run around with them.  Why am I still fat?

       I've reached the conclusion that the American people have been brainwashed by the fast food and convenience food industry. People really think that they don't have time to make foods for themselves.   Let me start out by stating that I am a mother of two, I work a full time job, and write part time. I run the church book club, sing in the choir, and volunteer with the Cub Scouts. I'm lucky if I get 5 hours of sleep a night. I'm not some person with scads of time on her hands.   This morning, I packed my lunch. I tore some iceberg lettuce off the head in the fridge, and dropped in a container with some grape tomatoes and a few slices off of the cucumber I keep on the top shelf. Then I took a tiny container, put in a couple tablespoons of red wine vinegar, an equal amonut of EVOO, a little kosher salt, ground the pepper into it, tore off a few oragano leaves, slapped the top on, threw an envelope of tuna in my bag, and took off. My lunch took me all of 5 minutes to prepare, making my own salad and dressing.   I belong to several message boards, one of which is for support of the Not-to-be-named diet I am trying to follow. I'm forever seeing people write that they're too busy to make their own vinaigrette dressing, or steam vegetables.  Too busy.   Too busy.   Why do people eat so much fast food? Because the food is so great? Nope, because they're "busy".   But are we really too busy? Let's look at my evening last night. We got home from OT at 5:30, and everyone was hungry. I was so tempted to run to McDonalds, but I decided to see what I could whip up at home. One hot cast iron skillet, some boneless chicken breasts, a couple of links of chicken apple sausage leftover from brunch on Monday, an onion and a green pepper, and dinner was on the table in 20 minutes flat. Some microwaved broccoli and a little "salad" - (being lettuce with dressing) - and dinner was served. I would have taken almost that long to get the baby together, get to McDonalds and get our food. We weren't too busy for dinner. If I really took a look at the opportunity cost of fast food, I can't think of a single time we've ever really been "too busy" to eat well.   Most of the meals I cook are on the table faster than "Hamburger Helper" or a boxed dinner. They're certainly better than what we'd bring home in a bag. Why do people still think that busy families need everything pre-packaged and ready to go? It's not because of experience, it's simple marketing. We're not nearly so "busy" as the industry would like us to believe. Good Seasons really wants us to think that we don't have time to make our own salad dressing. Ore Ida wants us to think that taking 5 minutes to cut those steak fries ourselves would make us late for soccer practice. McDonalds wants us to believe that we're giving more to our families by spending that mythical time we save by not cooking with the kids than by feeding them homemade food.   Convenience packaged foods make a great addition to a homemade dinner. I grab the package of mashed potatoes when I'm making a roast, rather than peeling and mashing my own. I use bagged salads several times a week. The thing is that at some point, packaged convenience became the meal rather than the accent. You can buy whole meals, including the meat, in a box. They don't taste very good, they're high in fat, simple carbs and sodium, but everything's in one package. Rachel Ray proves again and again that in 30 minutes - give-or-take - you can have a homemade meal on the table. "Desperation Dinners" has well over 100 recipes that can be done in 20 minutes or less. The meal in a box takes 35 + to bake. Why would people rather have that? Because they're convinced that they're too busy to cook.   I have nothing against time savers. There are many labor and time saving techniques that I use on a daily basis. What I object to is people's almost frantic defense of the idea that the activites in their lives preclude them from being able to eat good, healthy foods that don't come in a box, bottle or can.   Cooking isn't hard. Not every meal has to take hours. A few simple skills, a couple of cookbooks, and a little determination are all it takes to break the convenience food habit for your whole family.

       This is more or less an accurate representation of what I look like right now - FAT!    I'm too embarassed even to post a real picture.  This is what I want to look like:    It's like two completely different people.  Heck, I'm trying to lose 80 lbs - that's more than both of my kids put togther: (57 and 22)  I intnd to look like "Thin me" by Memorial Day 2005. I'm running in the 2005 Boulder Boulder 10K regardless of whether I succeed or not. If I don't get off my ass and train even a single mile this year, I'm running that 10K race next Memoral Day. That's my motivation. If I don't take this weight off, I'll be carrying it on that track, in the summer heat, in front of everyone. Not a good plan. It's a much better idea to leave those 80 lbs behind.
