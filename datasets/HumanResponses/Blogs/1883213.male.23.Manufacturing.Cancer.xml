      How did Scarface(1983) get to be such a big deal?  I saw it last night, in it's extended re-realease run at the Arclight, and the theater was packed.   As far as remakes go, though, it's one of the more acceptable cases in my mind. partly because the guys who made Scarface seemed to have loved the original, and also seem to know that the original is and always will be the superior movie, even if the mobs of fans at the arclight will never think so because it's in black and white, and nobody gets a chainsaw to the head.  One of the cool things about Scarface is called Grand Theft Auto - Vice City. Which is, incidentally, much cooler than Scarface.  Recently I said something about sizzle, and the bullet effect, and I'd like to take the time now to add to the complicated theory, that Scarface, though it is mostly sizzle and very little steak, is not getting dated. Rather it seems to have latched into the eternal sizzle. I think it's through the character. I've always had a soft spot for guys like Tony Montana. Characters that almost seem to big for the world, and eventually they must self destruct as a result. What I see in the original scarface was a movie that benefited, almost, from censorship. It became suggestive, and it's fascinating implications story wise and character wise led to flocks of film nerds, including Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone, who read into Scarface things like the incest thing.  What I see in the remake is a movie that could have used a little censorship. Not just the gore, because gore is fun, and anybody who says otherwise needs to get with the times and get a little de-sensitized to cartoon violence. In general Scarface is a movie of excess. Sure, that's the whole point you want to say, but it's not just excess in the money the guy has, but the was the movie re-iterates it's points over and over and over. And it also gets so caught up in inner workings of Tony's rise without paying much attention to the natural laws of our universe. Like when people get gunned down in the street in front of mobs of people there tends to be a problem with the police. Eventually...  Regardless, if you live in LA, check out scarface at the Arclight simply because it's a great theater, and all movies, great and small, deserve to been seen in a place of worship. And as far as Theaters go, the Dome at the arclight might be the Sistine.

      Hello dearest readers,  I would like to go on record as being one film nerd who is not excited about Kill Bill, be it volume one, or volumn two or whatever.  Why? Because. And if that's not agood enough reason for you than you can go fuck yourself.  I glimpsed through a magazine called 'american cinematographer' today and came upon a little segment with Roger Deakins- the guy who shoots the coen brothersmovies. He said a lot about the way they move the camera- because they move it well and nice. But the thrust of what he said, when questioned was that he felt nice camera moves had to come organically from the story- and they were always to serve the story.  Well, obviously. Right?  Tell that to Quentin Tarantino.  This is not to say that extrvagent camera work isn't kick ass in it's own right. It's definitely kick ass in it's own right. I don't want to pass judgement on Kill Bill version 1.0 or whatever- I just want to say - for the record- that kick ass camera moves are nice today, but will soon become a big part of an evil scheme launched by father time called the Bullet effect. Maybe sometime I flesh out the bullet effect for ya, but at this point it seems useles since I don't know that you're even there. suffice it to say that the bullet effect is what happenswhen you're all sizzle and no steak and the sizzle you were don't sizzle no more because times have changed and with it, so has sizzle.  sizzle changes a lot. Everyday. Think about teh fact that right now Ashton Kutcher is popular. How will we explainb this to our children.   "It was a dark time..."  The constant shift in whats cool is a big part of the reason that tv sucks so much. TV is free, and there's a shit load of it at any given moment, whether you watch or not. So everything on it has to grab your momentary attention and be just about the coolest thing available. Thus tv tends to suck. Every once in a while tv is good. Like the simpsons. One of the greatest cultural achievements of our time. And sienfeld. Sienfeld was funny too.  Outside of that tv tends to be lame. Case in point is friends. Friends is really an unfortunate quality to our existence. When it started and I was in 7th grade, it seemed very grown up and cool to me. I don't know what the rest of the country's excuse is.  Enoug for tonight. Good luck, and godspeed.

      Hey Gang,  I saw another movie today. It's called Cabin Fever. If you see it, I'm sorry I couldn't warn you sooner.   After the movie I ran into some people I knew from high school. Their names were Jessica and Joanna- for the record. At first we stared at eachother for a good 10 minutes from about 2 feet away, both contemplating whether or not it was too late to ignore and thus be counted as rude. Then finally Jessica said something.  "George Edelman"  And I had to respond.  "Yeah. hey. I knew I recognized you- but I wasn't sure...."  This bullshit went on for a few more minutes and it was abundantly clear we wanted nothing to do with each other. Eventually where I lived came up and I said,  'I live in hollywood'.  This, for whatever reason, really bothered Joanna. She made reference to it frequently over the next few minutes, almost as if to suggest that I was lying somehow. I don't remember all the comments but I remember a few.  "Hollywood. Really?"  "Hollywood... Don't you live with peter and peter? I thought they lived in park labrea?"  "Where is Park labrea? is that hollywood?"  "Yeah- what a weird area- what do they call that area? Fairfax district?"  This bullshit went on for a while- the whole time I would respond with things like   "Yeah."   "Sorta"   "West hollywood really"   "People get confused easily about locations"   And then finally I said,   "I just say hollywood because it makes me feel cool."  Which is entirely true. And at this point things took a turn for the more alkward. My friend peter scheer arrive- they all exchanged renewed awkwardness, and then they left.  I guess the point is that Joanna thought I was lying. And this really bothered her. Sure, maybe was exaggerating, but I do feel like I live in Hollywood. Because Hollywood is a state of mind, man.  That's not entirely true. Hollywood is also a place that I don't live. But Joanna didn't feel I should get away with lying. And she's right. Why should I? So I told her that I was lying because I pretty much have a low self esteem, and then she shut up.   Joanna was also kind of bookish in high school. Which is not to say there is anything wrong with her, but I don't really remember ever seeing her or talking to her. I was vaguely aware of her presence. Maybe she's angry about that. Maybe she just likes Hollywood and wishes she could live there and doesn't think anybody should lie about such a thing.  Regardless, even If I don't live in Hollywood, I breath the same shit air as Hollywood, and I figure if they can give me cancer, they can lend me some of their coolness as well.  But the bigger truth is that living in Hollywood really wouldn't be all that cool. It's kind of a lame place. It'sd a good place to live near because you don't have to see tourists all the time, taking pictures next to their favorite hand in the cement. But you want to be able to tell people that you live in Hollywood, and you want to be a quick drive away from Canters or Mels, and especially the new Beverly theater.   Also, I may not live in Hollywood, but I live about a block away from Simon, and if that doesn't make me cool than nothing ever will.  Alright- time to go. Wish me luck. I'm going to make a movie soon, and I hope that it will be really good.   -Wilhelm Von Gesas

      Hello friends  Been some time now.  I went to a 'writers store' today to buy final draft. Stores like that always bug me because there's all these books telling you how to do things. And the more time you spend in places like this the more you start to think that you need a book about doing something to be able to do it.  You know what's weird about the emmys? Nobody cares about them. I know people watch them- I've watched them before. But nobody really cares about them except for the people who are winning. And even then I don't think it's SUCH a big deal to them. I know somebody who has an Emmy, and it's pretty cool to hold it and it's definitely on display in the home. But at the end of the day, I don't think it's such a big deal to this person that they have one.   Maybe this is how it should be. Because we place so much damn importance on the oscars. Which makes them silly in a reverse way. But the people who deny the value of their oscar are just trying to look cool. They love their oscars.  It's probably because when you win an Oscar you are counted in history along with Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson, Steven Speilberg, etc. And when you win an Emmy you are counted in history alongside Kelsey Grammar.  But then again some people who win an Oscar are counted alongside Kevin Costner and some people who win Emmy's are counted alongside Jerry Seinfeld.  It's a fucked up world we live in.  I like when celebrities get upset for not having any privacy. It seems like the one thing they have to complain about and they really zero in on it. Thats not entirely fair though. It's possible that some celebrities have normal shitty things happen to them just like the rest of us. But it's a lot nicer to have normal shitty things happen to you in a private jet.  Some celebrities don't have private jets though. Like Ricardo Montalban. Is Ricardo Montalban a celebrity? Would he count himself as one? Would William Shatner count Ricardo Montalban as a celebrity? Who's more likely to be in awe of Ricardo Montalban- William Shatner or Leslie Nielson?  Is being gay enough on it's own to make someone  funny? And if so, is being a woman enough, on it's own, not to be funny? And if both are true than where does that leave Ellen DeGeneres? The truth is though being gay and being a woman more likely make people not funny, which is part of the reason why Ellen DeGeneres is twice as unfunny as any unfunny person. It's because of this misconception about gay people being automatically funny that people keep giving her t.v. shows.  Is Whoopi Goldberg a lesbian?  I saw a postcard once while my roomate was buying an American Flag Keychain, and this postcard was of a really fat nasty woman posed on a beach in a bikini, barely covering herself.   I thought a few things.  Firstly, where did they find this woman? She looked like she was homeless, because her hair was all messed up- and we all know that's a sign of homelessness. So did they go out one day looking for an ugly, fat homeless chick willing to pose on the beach for money? If so, did she ever in her wildest dreams think it would be for a postcard? Even if she wasn't homeless- Did they hold auditions? Did they put an add in Backstage west looking for a fat ugly woman? Did they contact plus sized modeling agets and ask for the ugliest model they had? How often do modeling agencies get calls like that? What's the market for ugly fat models?   And once they got the woman in question, did they laugh at her while they were taking the pictures? Did they lie about what they were doing so she wouldn't know the whole thing was designed to capitalize on her ugliness as a source of laughter?  And, now that it's all completed, and she's got her paycheck, does she ever walk down the street and get recognized as that fat ugly chick from a postcard? Probably not- but does she ever come across the post card herself and laugh thinking 'Boy, I sure am funny looking and fat and disgusting'.   Do her parents know? Or her kids? her friends? Or- god forbid- her husband? Do they see it at the key chain store and say, "Shit Olga, you really rocked on that postcard gig."  Even more curious yet, is does this woman put on her resume, 'Posed naked on the beach for a postcard' And then when she comes in to the interview do the people look at the resume and think she's lying because she's fat and disgusting. In case that might happen is it possible that she adds on her resume, when describing the postcard job, 'it was for a joke because I'm really fat and disgusting and in this case being fat and disgusting was an asset, so don't be quick to judge when we meet when I interview for your job- you never know when having a fat and disgusting person will come in handy for some good laughs.'  It was some postcard, I'll tell ya.

      I just wrote a post and it didn't post because the new format of blogger which might have somthing to do with OSX. It was a bad post. and brief. My girlfriend is trying to throw away my old trash lying in the corner of the room. I appreciate her intentions, but it reminds me of my mom. Which scares me. She'll probably read this and make fun of me for writing it.  TIme to go eat lunch. Or breakfast.   I want to give a shout out to my brother's alias ;Poops Magoo. It's a good alias.

      Hello   Yesterday was speant in traffic. Traffic really is an unfortunate phenomenon.   I have come to accept that nobody reads this. The question is, do I continue regardless. To I continue to post things on this page in the delusional mindset that somebody will shed a tear, or just be sorry that there is nothing new to read on Wunderkind. Maybe that name was a bad idea. We won't know, will we.  I had a dream I was online for episode III. Once I had a dream that I saw episode III and the opening crawl was in red letters, that dripped like blood. Isn't it sad to think that my nightmares not only include watching a version of a star wars movie, but that what makes it a nightmare is the color of the text inn the opening crawl.   This new keyboard is very nice. It makes me feel a lot better about the writing, which probably hasn't improved a whole lot.  This whole blog thing used be new and exciting and now it's become really existential in it's own way. Do I continue to blog in a vaccum, or do I stop blogging. Maybe I should do something with my life.  Fuck that. I'm afraid my computer doesn't have enough memory. Enough for what? you might ask. I don't know. Enough in general. Enough for things I might want to do. Enough to keep me off the 'mac help' hotline. That hotline sucks. It sucks balls.  If you thought 5yearmission.com was bad, check out starshipexeter.com. Much worse.  Why am I fascinated by things like this? Well, I guess I need to feel better aqbout myself. You see I make movies, and while they are certainly of a higher quality than Starship exeter, they're not breaking any box office records- not that that's my long term goal- but you get the idea. So I need to pick on somebody my own siuze, or preferrably somebody just a little bit smaller.  Maybe they're actually bigger than me because they're movies are on the web.   Both of my roomates are doing productive things right now. one actually went to class, and the other has an audition for a television series. I am using a new computer. I suppose I should take a shower, it's 2:00pm. I'm usually not even awake by now.  Cheers, Colin Farrell's baby

      Tonight I want to turn our collective attention to a phenomenon knon as the fan film.  If you've never heard of a fan film, it goes something like this:  1)Star Wars comes out 2)People really like it 3)Some people REALLY like it 4)Those people make spin off movies of the original Star Wars.  This works with things besides for Star Wars. Like, say, Star Trek.  Regardless, I think the entire phenomenon is interesting. When you think about it, Fan Films are really a wierd way of getting involved in the fiction you love. And that's cool. No. Actually it's really not cool. But it's okay- if you want to do that with your life.  Sure, we live in a time where everything is a fan film. Right? Everything is derivative, and everything has 'homages'. Sure. I've been responsible for a few 'homages' myself over the years. But these aren't homages friends. These are fan films. And thus they do not have, nor do they pretend to, any individuality from their master creator. This is a shame.  When we 'homage' we allow for something that means alot to us to influence our own work- and our own vision. Just like when writing a love scene you might drawn on a time you had with your sweetheart, when writing a space ship launch scene you might draw on your favorite time watching a space ship launch. Sure, one happened to you and one you watched, but in this media soaked world we might as well assume your behavior with your sweetheart was influenced by that weeks episode of Happy Days. Which you also watched.  Regardless, when you 'homage', you allow for influence from the things you love. When you make a fan film you just try to do your own little thing with the scraps from somebody elses table. With homages, cross overs, rip offs, and even franchises we have a world where new ideas pop in here and there- new expressions. With a fan film you can never find something totally new- something devoid of any influence.   Originality is a funny concept. A wise man once told me that he felt the history of movies had people building on the same themes, and every once in a while somebody would twist it a bit to achieve an unachieveable effect, then that would become the status quo, and everyone would twist it that same way to achieve that same effect. We stand on eachothers shoulders to try to help tell new stories- in new (and exciting) ways.  But even if our stories and our methods are new, if the very premise- the very foundation- is not than we cannot hope to really find creative growth. That growth comes from somebody having the hard time of saying their own thing. In a sense, the fan film eliminates the challenge of making it all up- even if some of it you saw elsewhere. If you hide from that challenge, your work can never add somethnig new to the forward motion. You chose to be stagnant. In the words of another wise man, you chose poorly.  Now this is fine for some. And I don't mean to condemn fan films entirely. I just have found them increasingly depressing lately- for me. In my opinion. I wish all those who put their lives into them good luck. But I urge everyone to keep pushing to come up with something new- even if it's only a little new.  Sorry for going on about this. But I figure nobdoy is lisening anyway, so this becomes my own forum tolay out my own thoughts. If anybody agrees or disagrees( supposing sombody reads this) feel free to contact me at unittk421@hotmail.com

      This blog should be read AFTER reading the previous blog. This blog is the special features blog.   I want to add something because- after mulling it over a bit I feel I need to make an important thing clear about my opinions. I do take my opinions very seriously while I'm pretty sure nobody else does.  Lost In Translation is a really fine movie. The comparison in the previous blog is not really fair to either. They are different kinds of movies and they achieve different kinds of things, and I think Lost In Translation is a little rough around the edges(boring)- but certainly not worth ignoring for this reason. It is a really interesting movie. It gets at an interesting quality to life, and the people behind the movie found nice ways to convey the experience- the story- whatever. It's very worth seeing, and in many ways superior to Matchstick Men- just not as well crafted. And in some ways that's nice. One should go into it expecting it's slowness- and allowing it to takes it's time. It's meditative and requires a little more of us than movies like Matchstick Men, which gives you the option of finding meaning, or just having fun on the surface. Either way, movies are great. and I'm clearly obsessed.

      This entire blog must be prefaced by 'in my opinion...'  Many movies came out this weekend. For the first time all year there was a multitude of interesting movies to go see. Of the three Once Upon a Time in Mexico was the one worth skipping- unless of course you need to jump onto or hold your spot on the Johnny Depp band-wagon. That's not entirely fair. The movie was fun.  In the meantime, both Lost in Translation and Matchstick Men are worthwhile movies. The difference seeming to be that one was another well polished, and interesting piece by a few well paid professionals at the peaks of their hollywood careers. The other was a sophmore effort from someone who had a big hand in ruining the Godfather trilogy and made a really really really interesting movie the first time out.  I think these things summarize the difference entirely. Both lacked in the screenplay department- and had strange story problems. They also both seemed to me to be very deliberate and very well executed. But why compare these movies? I don't know. I guess because I saw both of them recently.  At the end of the day I preferred Matchstick Men, and am curious to hear from people who agree of disagree. While I think it was easily the more 'hollywood' in all the bad ways- it was so beautiful and it was edited and paced so wonderfully- while Lost In Translation hobled along at times leaving me in scenes I didn't understand the purpose of- I guess I was 'Lost in Translation'. This may have been the intention. And thats fine. Matchstick Men also was experiential in a similar fashion. The movies put you in the heads of their characters well- and at the end of the day it's kind of a question of what head you liked being in more. Though I can't stress enough how much each movie pulled this phenomenon off- and how well. In this sense I am in awe of both.  I'm sure most people who want to sound smart would like Lost In Translation more on principle, just like most people who really are devoid of any intelligence at all would like Matchstick Men more on principle. It's a complicated world we live in. Be it Tokyo or Los Angeles.  Bill Murray is a genius- by the way. And had he not been in the movie, I never could have watched it. It was a nice piece in the puzzle of Bill Murray's excellence- where Nicolas Cage's excellence in Matchstick Men was almost depressing given that he is so frequently doing awful movies.  Suffice it to say it's time for me to go, and both movies were well worth the time and the thought. I thoroughly enjoyed going to see all three movies- even the Mexico didn't enter the film nerd forum I just laid forth par excellence. Movies are fun. "They" finally gave us some decent stuff to watch. God bless you all, and God Bless the Wienstiens.

      Back from fishing. Good times. If you want some squid give me a call, I've got extra and catching the bastards was a real challenge. They squirt all kinds of shit at you and I swallowed some of it. It ain't tasty- but the squid sure is.  Anyway, I heard something on the radio the other day that was funny to me, so I want to share it with my imaginary readers.  Basically some people in jail felt the guards were mistreating them so much that they had a special investigator go into this jail to figure things out. What he found out was that there had once been a crew of guards called the psycho crew or something like that and they would beat up the inmates. They would torture these guys until they(the inmates) lost bowel control and 'defacated on themselves'.  So basically they beat the shit out of them. Never thought I'd hear it on the radio.  So my conclusion was that KCRW really fucked this one up. They should have said,  "Prisoners get the shit beaten out of them- is this okay? All this and more on the Tavis Smiley show."  Am I wrong? Did they not totally miss the boat on that one. People complain a lot about the news and all it's permutations(I paid good money for many years to be able to use that word casually) but I think the major flaw in the news is that it's so dry, and yet so obvously biased. How can you manage to be biased and still be dry. That's what we in Park La Brea call the worst of both worlds.  At least, as long as you're going to be biased you should be funny about it. Like FOX news should say, "There are lots of democrats running against GW Bush, but don't vote for them. They all suck. They either eat small children or want to really badly and mastrubate thinking about it instead."  Of course it's never that funny. It's all under the surface and fucking boring. Of course they tried to make the whole war thing look cool on tv, and they failed miserably. They failed on both counts- being fair or unbiased, and being fun to watch.  When I was a kid I thought Michael J. Fox owned FOX so I liked the station. But my dad told me otherwise. And then I stopped liking the station and the man because he played Alex on that show where Michael Gross played his dad. Then I really liked him because of  back to the future. It was confusing to like Marty McFly but not to like Alex. It was a confusing time, and I blame Michael J. Fox for sending me mixed messages. Why couldn't he keep it simple like Harrison Ford, or Arnold?  I heard Arny on the news also and hearing him saying serious things was hysterical. It was far better than any movie he's been in for a long time. So while he's not the best choice for Governor, I think he'd make the news that much more entertaining. Maybe the solution is to only elect people who talk funny. Politics are complicated I guess.

      This will be the last blog for a couple days now. Something about this blog is frustrating me. When I posted my series of misspelling jokes last time they came up in sequential order, so if you read from the top down, as we all do, it makes no sense. Kind of like the movie memento.  While we're on the subject of that movie, I know everyone really loved it- but it kind of frustrated me. I think it was entirely too gimmicky. Imagine if you saw that movie in proper order. It would be one of the stupider movies you'd ever see. So then, what makes this movie so great. The fact that the guy decided it should be backwards.  Today is the anniversary of 9/11, and I thought I might as well mention that. I'm not a big fan of 9/11. Not just the event, but also everything it led to. It really changed our world for the worse, but then again maybe it just made us aware of things we had an easy time ignoring. I'm not going to start getting political, partly because I'm not in the mood, and partly because I don't have the time.  And partly because Johnny Depp got really political recently and had to take things back.  I have a question.  Why should anybody care, let alone print, what Johnny Depp thinks about America?  He doesn't even live here anymore. But even more than that, he's just an actor. Now, I'm not saying actors are stupid... and I'm not saying that people out of politics don't have the right to an opinion. But it really doesn't matter enough what old J.D. thinks to have him taking things back. At least it shouldn't.   Which brings me to the other inevitable issue of current world affairs. Actors running for Governor. While Conan is an actor and he is running for governor, he has managed to make his opinions less known to us than Johnny Depp. And he could probably kick Johnny Depp's ass, so he's got my vote.  This blog was strange. Goodbye until Saturday.

      Just want to take a moment to aknowledge Mathew 'M.K.' Kellard, an old friend of mine who currently lives somewhere in North Pole. Or is it Chicago? Same thing.  You see, Old MK left the comforts of sunny Los Angeles and it's beautiful scantily clad peoples for the harsh reality of ... wherever he went. Lets be honest: To those of us from Los Angeles, anything else is a harsh reality. LA misses people like MK, just as she misses all her lost children, whites and latinos alike. But I guess MK doesn't belong here anymore. Maybe he never did. I know whenever knew people come to visit him in that place he is now he says, "You truly belong with us here among the clouds." I don't know if it's some kind of pick up line or what. I know he probably would have liked having Conan as our Governor.   Basically I felt it necessary (largely due to death threats) that I mention MK by name. There are few people who can go by the one name type of thing. MK has it down to a science.   To be honest I don't know why it was important that I mention his name. Nobody reads this. I think I've said that before. See you tonight.  -Optimus Prime

      I should start by making quick reference to a good friends fair argument against my purchasing "The Gold Rush" on DVD.  Firstly, if you didn't already check out the blog I wrote days back on old movies and their merits, please do. But eitherway, you can check out my friends response. It's also a few days back, and it's linked to from this site. Just go to 'Peter Scheer'.  I bought the movie because- unlike The Big Lebowski(a must for any collection), The Gold Rush won't always be available- this is to say, owning a classic, a nice crisp transfer of a classic never shown on t.v., well... that's a real treat in my eyes. Everyone I know owns the Big Lebowski. In fact, my roomate owns it n VHS. I can quote every scene, and so can every schmuck this side of the 10 freeway. And well they should. But I have only seen the Gold Rush three times, if you count the recent viewing as per all this discussion, and each viewing was a great experience. So that's why I bought it. And I once again, will plug it shamelessly- while some movies do suffer the passage of time, some manage to hold onto key themes of our very existence- things that never change. The Gold Rush, certainly hits on a few things eveybody is familiar with, and everyone can understand. And no, this does not include houses hanging on the side of a cliff, or making potatos dance with your forks(though we should all try this sometime-- see Benny and Joon starring the increasingly popular Johnny Depp) But not everyone will like The Gold Rush...  Hey-- here's a funny problem. I think some movies are great, and some people think the same movies are shit. Ever encountered this one before? Maybe not with movies, but probably books or pasta sauces. Yeah, funny thing about subjectivity, you can't ever make it objective. Well, you could have in the late 30's around Germany, or if you live across the hall from me, but otherwise it's a tough sell.  What is the point of this comment? Well, I like to claim that a movie is bad sometimes. Well shit, not just sometimes. Lots of times. And I usually have a bunch of reasons. Like I'll say, "The photography is bad" or "I don't buy that that character would ever do that" or "I think this scene sucks" or "I hate any movie with Collin Farell on principle" but, oddly enough, often times people disagree with me. And they have their own odd reasons. And somtimes they love the very things I cite as being the cause of a movies overall shittiness. Like I think John Wayne's stiff acting works nicely, and Peter Scheer (and my Dad) think it's garbage.  The answer? Well, argue until you're blue in the face, but the bottom line is we have to accept that there is no measuring stick. There is no universal standard. There are norms, and standards, we come to agree on, but pretty much a movie, or anything "artistic" has to be judged independantly, and subjectively. It's fun to cite why, and how. And it's fun to disagree. But let's accept and deal with the fact that there is a deep, intrinsic, inherent, subjectivity to what makes a movie good for each person. The cool thing is when we develop similar standards, and we see them all at work consistently. But movies let everyone have their own experience. Good or bad. That's part of why we like them so much, and part of why it's so cool when our standards and tastes line up, and we all agree about certain things, because then we can say, "Hey, ya know what- maybe it's not all so subjective after all."  But that moment only ever lasts so long- a hint at a deeper truth we are not ready to realize and I'm not awake enough to pitch.   And thus as a maker of movies I've come to understand that you can't please all of the people all of the time; It's damn nice when you please any of them at all.  Also- a quick thought I had. John Wayne versus Clint Eastwood.   I've considered it, and I go Eastwood, because, as tough as he is, Wayne is a man, he always plays a man with flaws and man who can die. Part of a lyricism of John Ford's westerns that star Wayne(possibly the only Wanye movies worth watching in my limited experience). But Eastwood-- he's a demon straight from hell. He's somekind of god of death sent as a hitman for the devil himself. He doesn't always like it- but he seems cursed to walk the world a cold blooded killer. Ain't no man gonna stand in his way. I don't care how tough he is. I only mentioned it because I thought it'd make one hell of a fight.  keep the faith.

      Well, this is kind of a mid-day blog to make up for last nights missed entry. My apologies to the imaginary people who read this daily. We at the mind of George Edelman appreciate your time and devotion thoroughly and would never abuse such a gift.  It has begun to occur to me that there are actually people(not just imaginary ones) who might visit this page upon occaision. I thank you brave souls for your patronage as well.

      It's that time of morning again sports fans, and here we are, wondring if anybody is out there...  I thought hit me earlier today. What If I write some really great stuff on this blog? Then what happens? There probably isn't a copyright, which means one of you schmucks could copy it down and I might find myself- my 'voice' if you will- in a book someplace down the line.  Well that's just the risk you run with this whole information super highway age. Maybe, from a certain disilusioned perspective, anything I think or write will inevitably end up in somebody's book someplace because we may have been influenced by the same things, ate the same cereal, watched the same cartoons, had sex with the same she-male hooker in Tiajuana.   And the ultimate irony is that if and when I read myself in this book I may come across in the future, I'll probably like it, and give the book credit because it captured some deep truth to my existence and my experience that I thought only I had. When in reality it was just something someone ripped off my blog.  We live in a fucked up world my friends. A fucked up world.  Speaking of fucked up worlds... this next part is a real winner...  Let's have a moment for the guy who died on Thunder Mountain railroad. We all(me) get scared on these rides and then have to tell ourselves, "No, No, don't worry. Nobody ever dies on these things. They're safe. They test them out, they wouldn't ever let us get on them, etc. etc. and even when somebody does die, it's like once for every millions of times people go on them." I even have a book that outlines the 10 times anybosy ever died at Disneyland. It just never happens. Not to me- we all say. Well, somebody did die, and not only did he WAY lower the odds for the rest of us, but he also made sure that all of our paranoid fears are realized, and he was, in a sense, a speaker of mathmatical truth.  1 out of every some number of people will die on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. It's fucked up, but it's true.  I also think we owe him thanks because his unfortunate death will make certain that the people at all amusment parks bust their asses to make sure everything is working well- why? Because people are probably less likely to go now or something.   I do wonder if they'll try to claim the ride warns you because it is, 'The wildest ride in the west'  Come to think of it, it was my first roller coaster. So we go way back. I was terrified then, and I guess I had a bad sense about that ride. I knew some shit was gonna go down.  More than anything this guy, and this incident, represents that none of us are safe. There's a cancer cell out there with your name on it, or maybe instead of a caner cell it's  a loose track on a roller coaster. Either way, enjoy it while it lasts I guess. And because I know nobody is reading this(I hope at least cause I've made a total ass of myself) I feel it's okay to get all preachy like this.  Here's the the people on thundermountain railroad. We can only hope they were having a good time.  Goodnight, and Godspeed.

      I sat in my girlfriends new room in her new apartment today while she moved some thins around and re-arranged her stuff. I looked through an old photo albumn and saw my entire  College experience flash before me in a series of hair cuts.  A series of three haircuts. It was odd. I also thought of all the places the stuff in her room had been in previous rooms. The Sorority house. The dorms. Etc. Same stereo. Same nightstand, or book shelf. New room.  And then I thought, well isn't that kind of like life. I've seen this person, her, or even myself, in all these strange places. Same person. New place. And then in looking at the pictures from say, spring break in Cabo, and I would think, 'Oh yeah. I was there, wasn't I.' Then the more I thought about it the more it seemed like Annie Hall in a wierd sort of way.  You know annie hall was originally a murder mystery. But it didn't work so they made it a love story. Something like that. Check imdb for more details.  I also went with a roommate to a commercial agent today. He said, as we walked into the building, "This is the kind of building that you never notice until you have to go in for some reason." It was true.  Then there was this guy at the coffee place later who heard me ranting about what kinds of movies people should be in, and he said, 'You like movies, eh?' and I said, 'sure.'   "Are ya in the business" I lauged, "Are you" The guy looks at me and then he says, "I was. I was around it. My parents, a few girlfriends, my grandma owned a studio" some more horseshit like that. He dropped some names I've never heard of, which i think made him feel old or wierd. And he was both.  "So what do you think of the business after all this exposure" I asked him. "It changed. It's not like the good old days."  I smiled. But what the fuck does that mean? I mean, I'm sure he's right. But it's still a silly thing to say. The good old days for this guy was hanging out with television stars in the 60's like the guy who played Dennis the Menace. I'm sure to a great many people these were not the good old days.   I often look forward to when I'll refer to right now as the good old days. Probably won't take long considering my flash of nostalgia when I looked through a two year old picture book.   Well, thats all for now. Give me feed back if this isn't working for you. I'm just a mna trying to tell it like it is.  Oh yeah- one more thing- a black gay guy tried to have sex with Alex last night. The whole time alex was telling the story I kept thinking of how I would explain to my parents that Alex was starting to experiment over at Sarah Lawrence.

      I suppose it's important to try and post something here for nobody to read on a regular basis.  I would like to take a moment of your time to issue statement on a growing dilemma. It has become somewhat taboo in my very small world to be in awe of, or find any great value in movies that were made more than 30 years ago.  Case in point might be Charlie Chaplin's silent movie "The Gold Rush". Being that my interests lie in the field of movies I am particualry open to mockery for liking such a movie. But contrary to any such belief, this is not the kind of film anybody shows in Film school. And it's really not a movie just for film people(though anybody who takes the history of film at all seriously should certainly see it at some point for purely referential reasons). The Gold Rush is for anybody and everybody. It'll be entertaining to anybody and everybody. Thats the nature of the movie.  Furthermore, the notion that an old thing can't be as good, is just as absurd as thinking that an old thing must be better. Many a great movie today stands on the shoulders of Chaplin and the Gold Rush. If you care about the art form, you should go out and see the movies that helped form it along the way. Not so you can get in a 'A' in a class, or show up some other film nerd, but because you care about the art form.   Sure there are some things that date the Gold Rush. Like the lack of on-set recorded sound. But that doesn't mean it isn't worth it to put yourself in the mindset of the person at the time, and appreciate the film on it's own level. Surely if you can't get into The Gold Rush, why should you bother trying to read Shakespeare? Just because something is rough around the edges and requires some thinking, and some stretching, doesn't mean it has no contribution.  Also- there is a reason things are called "classics". They've endured- they've perservered, and people and continually found reason to appreciate them, and try to understand them. It's important to pay attention to why something is considered classic, before you decide to be your own man and disagree. The only person you cheat in that instance is yourself. Citizen Kane  is a fabulous movie. So is Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. Are they different? Sure. But that doesn't mean you have to hate one and love the other. The ability to appreciate both on their own level is something worth striving for in any field, but most certainly in one you care about.  So if you do bother to watch the Gold Rush, you'll be pleasently suprised. It's only about 90 minutes, and it passes quickly. The best part comes towards the middle- so stick it out even if at first it seems silly and inacessible. It's not all comedy.  That said I have to go finish watching "The Searchers" now. I've already seen it, but it's a really great movie and anybody who likes movies should give it a chance. On top of being one of John Ford's best movies(in my opinion), and one of John Wayne's best performances(in my opinion), it's a clear influence on Lucas and Speilberg in a variety of ways. The influence is clear as recent as in episode 2, oddly enough. There is one sequence he lifted right out of it- and not to his discredit. It's a great sequence in "The Searchers", and Lucas uses it cleverly, so it becomes a great sequence in Attack of the Clones. Except for the acting. Say what you will about John Wayne, he was much better than The Haydze.

      Yeah. I'm back already. The funny thing about this blog deal is that well... a few things.   1) It's like a diary for people to read. 2) But nobody is ever going to read it.  Well, people might read it someday if I ever do something interesting. And I am trying to do something interesting right now. So maybe this will help motivate me, or help let the gods and the fates know that I mean business.   By the way, this right here is my official disclaimer: if you've got problems with spelling errors and grammatical mistakes don't bother reading my blog. Checking for spelling errors just isn't my style, so hopefully you can forgive me for them.

      Hey folks,  So tommorow is Halloween. I was never a huge fan. Never big on candy. Never big on things that are scary. Most of my Halloweens have been speant in odd, unorthodox, and downright lame ways.  I've been told that as a young child the 31rst was spent hiding from trick or treaters in terror.  After that period which last through high school, my halloweens were devoted to figuring out which group of friends to be with- and which to betray. I also devoted a few good halloween nights to playing video games in doors with friends, as if the night wasn't even happening. Suere there were a few that had to do with causing trouble, and running from police. And, come to think of it, there were a few that combined all of the above. One thing has remained constant: not my favorite holiday.  But then what is my favorite one? I'm not one of those anti-thanksgiving people who tells horror stories of family dinners, or dreads them. I know most of my family has some 'tension' during the fated meal, but I've always found the whole thing to be a great time. But I don't eat turkey. Which is odd to most people. I'll eat it in a sadwich, but not with bread stufffed up it's gaping ass hole. Save that for the pilgrims. Besides, once I saw a wierd movie about Thanksgiving.   I like a christmas. But that's always been an issue since I'm supposed to be Jewish. Even though noen of my extended family was ever into the chanuka thing. I guess three or four generations back(cue godfather II music- sweeeping shot of tenements in NY) we spent lots of time trying to assimilate. The irony is that my parents moved to west LA and enrolled me at places like crossroads where there were more Jewish kids baffled at my christmas celebrations than there were christian kids celebrating my seemless assimilation.   Valentines day is odd, if alone you feel that slight jerk towards finding somebody to be with. Even if you're happy single, you feel like maybe you should start waking up before nooon, shaving everyday, washing your clothes, or getting a job. And if you're attached it's the  'show how much you care' test. So either way you're fucked.  I think fourth off July is the best one. I can remember a bunch of good 4rths. It's a day when everybody(in this country- and thats everybody who counts) gets together and gets drunk, eats meat, and blows things up illeagally.   What more do you want from a holiday? Oh yeah- it's dead middle of summer so you're about as far removed from giving two shits about anything as you could be, and you're probably about to go see an overhyped and destined to suck movie, but you're still just a little bit excited.  I've had a few good fourths. Some involved the bottle, some involved the lord, and some involved just some quality time between me and the good ole' US of A. Once there was this thing on AMC called "Indy-pendance Day" and it was an Indiana Jones Marathon on fourth of july. That day rocked. What a great country.  -Robert Paulson

      Indiana Jones   One of my mooch ass motherfucking roomates just took my NEW PRISTINE GORGEOUS PERFECT GODSEND dvd copy of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The irony being that I was just gooing to sing the films praise and the new DVD collection's praise realy quick before hurrying off to the other side of the room to watch the special features again, and keep watching the three films.  Is there anything better than the Raiders of the Lost Ark?   When my father introduced me to the film as a young child I can remember a few odd things. One, this was the only movie that I saw when I was young that didn't scare me right off the bat. Even the cantina scene in Star Wars did me in the first time through. I was terrified and fascinated by movies. Still am.  But Raiders is, was, will always be, for me and I think people of my age, a kind of golden standard. This movie represents the crossing of the three great influences on me and the movies of my childhood. Lucas, Speilberg, and Harrison Ford himself are really primary influences- not only that, but for my money, Raiders is the true high point for each of them.  Now I know what you're gonna say. Yes, Lucas was in top form, and so was Ford, but Spielberg went on to become so much more...  Fine. But the funny thing is, I think Ford has given 'better' performances(not to me- but to the people who value certain kinds of acting probably- they'd liek Regarding Henry, or more likely Witness). In the end, what Harrison Ford does with Indiana Jones is more than most 'good actors' do with any role they ever get. He created an icon, and whatever criticisms one may of his acting, or his style, I'll always feel that what he does works well for movies, and especially for movies like Raiders. We all agree nobody could have been better.   Lucas has Star Wars, and American Graffitti, both which represent his genius more thoroughly than Raiders. However, Lucas was riding the wave of his sucess high during Raiders, and it was his brain child, so to speak. A huge part of what's great about Raiders is also great about star wars.   Unlike Ford and Lucas, Speilberg wasn't at his high point career wise, and public opinion wise during raiders. However,  I do think it is the best directing Steven Spielberg has ever done.   Speilberg is to me a craftsman; an entertainer in the purest and simplest sense. This is not to say his serious movies aren't worthwhile, or well done, but I think the simplicity of Raiders, and it's excellence at being what it is- is pretty amazing. What more can you ask for? I ask that you re-watch Raiders. There are so many things- shots, transitions, music- everything flows. Everything is great. It's what I love about movies, and especially the kinds of movies Speilberg makes, and that said, I will now retire to the special features disk and maybe Temple of Doom since my roomate has taken this movie I could talk on and aon about forever from me.  Of course, last cruscade is also amazing- and better in some ways- but to me, raiders will always be the number one in the trilogy, and among the best.

      It's been some time.  My apologies. If anybody did come here and check my posts regularly, now I am sure they do not. Maybe I did this intentionally, because I didn't like that people checked my blog. Stealing my thoughts. I didn't want the government up in my dome piece, as a fella says.  But- I had some thoughts.  I was right about Kill Bill. It was all sizzle.  Oh but what sizzle it was. It was the sizzle to end all sizzle. Not quite. But it sizzled, baby. And that was the WHOLE point. It was.. sizzle for sizzles sake, I guess. And it worked. on a purely sizzle level. So if you're hungry for steak, go rent citizen kane. But if you want watch some shit COOK, this is your movie.  Interesting point though, to me. Is that one can look at Kill Bill as many stupid people might, just a kick asss movies... and that's fine... but if you want to get into  the heavy shit... by there is heavy shit to get into referecen wise.   From my angle, which is no way definitive or singular, I see the flick kinda like this.  Spagettti westerns.  Leone, and shit, right? Influenced by...  Akeezee Kuroseezeee. Kurosawa that is. So much so, that Fist full of dollars IS Yojimbo. right? right.  And- to take it a step back- Old Akira, was HEAVILY influenced, by that Paradigm of american filmmaking- that vastly over referenced master- the old master or old masters- John Ford.  John Ford- Quentin Taranteezee? they'd probably hate each other, and each others work. Not to mentioned everything eachother stands for.   BUT- they are intrinsictly linked, and such is the magic of cinema, and father time, and social change, all piling into one big boiling pot of water that one can only marvel at.  So movies are really at this far point- this stage of such referentiality, and such. What does that mean? I guess there are some problems in parts of the world, like Vons, Raplhs, and some sweatshops that Gap owns, where people do really bad shit and their lives are fucked up, so they can't go home and watch people getting chopped with samurai sowrds, and giggle to themselves about the genius of the references to Sergio Leone.  Thats why when I see Mystic River, and Runaway Jury I think.. sure they're hearts are in the right place, and they're trying to touch some people- and say good things, not just things about other movies, and whats cool about media.   You know what's wrong about the Yankees?  Everything. But you know what's wrong with america?  The yankees. And the problem is...lots of people think the yankees are whats right with america. They're wrong.   So let's all do are part. If you don't know why the Yankees are all that is evil and souless in this world, then you just don't pay attention to baseball. And thus I'll tell you. They always win. Now you know. So you understand.   A lot of people make fun of me for liking old movies, and having an interest in them. Well, not a lot of people. Just a few. It's been something I've discussed a lot before. So I guess this is a sort of the personal add section of my blog. If you like old movies, or even like a few of them, and want to talk about movies, old and new, but feel okay with the old, and the people who made them, them give me a ring. Sometimes I starve to be in a comfortable envorinment to discuss such things.   -Burton Pennyweather

      People of California,  You have spoken.   Or have you?  Regardless of outcome, we should all vote. Regardless of party, or preference, or olitics, we should all vote. Because voting, to quote the videos at westwood driving school, "is not a privledge; not a right."  A privledge for whom? Surely while we seemed headed towards facism(in more ways than one) we are not yet facistic in nature. One day when meat-headed movie stars and illiterate Texans TOTALLY dominate what was once a land of the brave, we will all look back on the days when we could vote, and our votes counted, with great sadness. So enjoy it while it lasts.  You know, not to sound like a codgey old person, but lots of people have suffered and died to get the right to vote. To get a voice. So who are we to turn it away. Th funny thing about this system and all it's quirks, is that we actually have a direct influence on it. Any person who chooses, be it laziness, ineptitude, or disinterest, not to vote has no place complaining about the outcome of a vote. More than that they have no right complaining about a candidate, or recalling a vote. Well, of course they have a right. But basically if you don't vote you're a fool.  Partly just because it kicks ass to vote. To have a say. COunted just as much as any other.  Okay- now I'm exaggerating. A vote from the CEO of a tobacco company means more than a vote from a poor brown person. Because with that vote comes money. "An den you get de power, and den you get de women."  I think next time someone like Tony Montana should run for govenor. How about Tony Montana versus Ethan from "The Searchers"? Sure, they were both characters in movies and not real people. Furthermore, one of the actors who played one of them is dead. But they can ressurect people now. Like Fred Astaire in those lame vaccum commercials, or John Wayne in the beer- there you have it. John Wayne is ready to go. They'll use clips from the Searchers, and from Scarface, and put together a debate. Montana will represent the people, he'll probably vote for the illeagal aliens getting drivers licenses. I'll Bet Ethan will vote no on that one.   Ethan will run a smear add calling Montana a 'half breed' and in a debate Montana will counter, 'joo wanna peese o' me mang?'  'to be governor joo gotta have balls mang.'  To this Ethan will answer, 'a half breed governor? that'll be the day.'  The two will disagree on a lot of subject, but they will agree on not taxing the rich. Tony is a self made man, and Ethan is more into stealing money from the government than giving it.  It'll go very nicely, and about five people will vote. All five old and on their deathbeds, and as a cruel joke they'll write in 'Conan the Barbarian'.  Shit. Too late. It already happened.  Sorry if you've never seen the searchers or scarface. you don't really get the jokes then. But you can probably get the idea. And eitherway, you can go rent one or both of the movies and forget about all this silly politics crap.

      It's almost three in the afternoon.   Has anybody here ever sceen Dazed and Confused? If you're of a certain age I'll bet you have. A dear friend of mine toook me to task on not liking the film last night. I basically think Dazed and Confused is American Grafitti, only less good.  But- that's just me. Instead of talking about why it's better- or some shit lie that- I'll just say why I like American Graffitti. I saw AG when i was past that age that the movie is aboout. And I still really felt it in my bones. Kind of like I feel an attraction to the guy who played the dad on the munsters.  I just decided- if that last sentence isn't proof enough- that I don't want to talk about american grafitti. It's great. Check it out some time. Dazed and Confused should never be on the short list of movies to see if you haven't seen American Grafitti.  That said, what's the deal with Bennifer? Are they or aren't they. I really can't wait any longer- this shit is driving me crazy. One day it's on, the next day it's off. It's just totally irresponsible of them. They owe us this much at least.  I remember, when all that war stuff was happening with the people in the middle east- that I had a great idea. I thought we should just ship Jennifer Lopez to Saddam, or Bin laden- or whoever was the bad guy at thtat time- and just let him have them. Then we'd televise the wedding, and all would be well.  The whole world loves our celebrities. And to be honest, we get sick of them pretty quickly. I'm sure we could find a way to replace Jlo. What about that Beyonce character? Or Shakira. Shakira came and went already- but we've got enough poor man's jlos to fill a barn at this point, and if it means shutting ole' saddam up, and ending international conflict, I say we give him Jlo. And televise it. Because it'd make great television.  And we'd also have a camera on Ben Affleck the whole time, as he watched his bride to be getting hitched to a scary evil dictator- he'd cry and sob, and we'd all laugh in glee. Then Matt Damon would console him. Fuck Project greenlight- this shit'll rock.  Enough for now. But keep the faith.  -Nehemiah Lickett.  This just in from the "You play wid' fire you gonna get burned" corner of the univese:  Roy, of "Sigfried and...", was mauled by one of the white tigers yesterday. Not just mauled, but onstage, during a show, moments after it was stated that this particular tiger was enjoying his firswt performance with the team. The tiger grabbed Roy and pulled him offstage, where he continued to maul him, and Roy screamed.  Stop laughing. Roy might not survive. His condition is critical.  Okay. You can laugh now.

      I move to strike the Godafather Part III from the record.  Moving to further business, I had a stomach ache today. But now it's mostly gone.  Once I saw a movie a movie about bugs, and the best part was the segment on the dung beetle.  This was the only segment with a three act structure.   Meet the Dung Beetle. He rolls a ball of shit around.  The Ball of shit get's caught on a thorn. The Dung Beetle Struggles to remove it.  The Dung Beetle removes the ball of shit, eventually.  One could also note many other qualities the segment had. For example, early on it was clear that the beetle had a hard time getting a grip on the soil when he rolled the shit ball. This became a much bigger problem when confronted with the thorn episode.  Also, when the ball hits the thorn, the beetle is unaware of what exactly his obstacle is. The audience, however, is in the joke because we saw the thorn go in because of the clever camera position: A directorial move Hitchcock would be proud of.  Once the beetle has finally removed the shit ball from the thorn, the camera zooms out nicely to reveal how small this beetle and his shit ball are, and how huge the road he is trying to cross is, implying a life of hardship before him.  One can only admire the dung beetle in all his excellence. He never gave up, no matter how long it took, or how hopeless it seemed. He also managed to stay totally focused on the goal, never wavering for a second. He never walked away and threw up his hands saying, "What the fuck. Jesus fucking christ. I give up" like lots of people I know would. He stuck it out, and this time he prevailed. Will he prevail next time? I don't know. Maybe not. But that's not the point. The kid's got heart, and that's what really matters. He's a model for us all.  But what was it all for? A ball of shit. Ah irony! Even the noble dung beetle cannot escape your wicked grasp.

      High and Low and Last Picture Show are both very special films to me.   And instead of talking about why they are great I will talk about why they are particularly special. I saw them both on the big screen. And they came out more than 30 years ago.  But I saw them at a little piece of heaven that is called the New Beverly theater. It's on Beverly right near La Cieneaga, about a block north from where i live. But If I could life at the new beverly instead, I probably would.  The seats are shitty, the sound system terrible, the screen smallish by today's Pacific Theater standards, and the rell to reel is pretty humerous when you get right down to it. But the movies are the best ever.   In a given year the new bev will show about 10-20 of the best movies you'll ever see. And the rest of the cities theaters will show maybe 2 or 3 really great movies, and maybe 5 total good ones. But probably not even that.  Anyway, seeing these movies the way they were meant to be seen,  for the first time, can never be replaced. Just llike seeing a movie at the new bev that I'd seeen on video millions of times(Chinatown) was a whole new expeience and made me appreciate the movie in a way I never had before.  Movies are about 100 years old. There are not to many 'art forms' that are that young. One can watch all the great movies, and all the near great movies, and all the not great movies, and then decided for themselves how to break up the list in a fairly short priod of time. But if you want to be able to doo that and be trult film literate, there is no better thing that a new bev. IT's a godsend. It's a filmschool in an of itself. But probably better than any film school that really exists.   Thats said they show some pretty shitty sutff every once in a while. But I'm not judging. Seeing Last Picture show and High and Low was huge- I went out after each and bought the respective DVDs, and sure the quality is better, but the experience of watching them at home, even on a largish screen, will never compare to the first time in the theater. Which is an experience I never would have had if the New Beverly hadn';t exists.  I once compared movie theaters to chruches, claiming that the arclight, or the Grove theater are akin to the great cathedrals of all time. This may be true. They are perfect places for the experience of movie/religion. And the new beverly is, to continue with this comparison, not a big beautiful church with amazing paintings on the cieling- primed and ready to bring you enlightenment. Rather the new beverly is a small ramshackle little place of worship, hardly held together by it's one minister/rabbbi/priest/monk. But it's the only place where you can definitely talk to God.   Anyway, I probalby won't go there for a few more weeks. I don't go everyday or all the time. I try to limit it to moviees I really want to see again, and movies I haven't seen at all. Everyone I know is disgusted with the chairs, and the sound, and the whole building. But it seems a small price to pay. SPEAKING OF SMALL PRICE the tickets are half price of any other ticket in LA, and it's a double bill. But since I'm not really plugging the place since nobdoy will read this, in all liklihood, I simply reccomend that if anybody does go, they offer to pay full price, or find a way to pay for both movies, and total to the same price of one shitty charlies angles 2, or bad boys 2, or whatever shit you go see. Because the new beverly is perenially down and out, and scraping to stay a live. So it might not always be with us.

      WHOA WHOA WHOA  Read a few things, B's, and I have something to say.  Birth of a Nation. Just because it's about racists doesn't mean it's overrated. Sure it's in my character to defend the first cinematic epic- because that's how I do- but let's be reasonable here. Birth of a Nation is a classic xample of _______. So please... don't fuck around.  Also- Terminator movies are wonderful. They aren't overrated because nobdoy sees them as anything more than really nicely ut together pulp fun. Which is the deal with James Cameron, and the problem with Titanic.   I digress.  Two related problems. Cinema is not art. New York is better than any other city in the world.  I can relate them easily. Because, I think both parties representing said views are more a case for sympathy than anthing else. Oddly enough I'll bet those parties could be the same party more often than not. LA is new, and so is cinema.   I think people who say movies cannot be an art and that New York is far superior to LA are hanging on to something- unwilling to see other sides of the coin that is life. But more than anything else, you can tell a lot by the passsion with which people espouse these views. What does mr. James Joyce have against movies? Why does he hate them so? SO much that he is determined to prove their inferiority. Doesn't it say more about him than about movies themselves? And what does Alex have against Titanic, or James Cameron? Or birth of a nation- doesn't that aggression speak volumes about Alex and his perspective, more than it does prove anything definitive about any of the movies he mentions?  And what about Peter Scheer? Though he caught himself, doesn';t his rampant anti-new york pro-la attitude suggest that he has something to hide- or something to defend?   I mean, who really cares what city is bettter? And who would really ever think they could prove one is over the other once and for all, and more than that, who would even care?  I don't like Titanic, but I'm open to having a discush on the movie. What I'm not opne to is people blindly slamming things just for the sake of slamming them. Cities, movies, books whatever. it's all part of the same wierd inferiority complex, and very unbecoming of a jedi.   All this has led me to believe that Alex and Peter are not yet ready for the trials.

      See Master and Commander. It's a fine movie. If you want someone to see it with gimme a call cause I'll gladly see it again. It was great.  Jessica Lynch.  Just wanted to put that out there.   But in the meantime I want to tell you all a thing.  Josh Scheer slept in my bed.  Maybe you don't know who that is. But I do. And he stayed the week here in my home while I was in New York. I friend of mine, he is. But I had no clue he was coming. And he slept in my bed.  And that's fine. It's fine because, hey, he's a good guy, and he can sleep in my bed anytime if he wants. But I'd like to be asked first.  I'd like to be asked first, so I know that we're cool. That there is a respect, and honor invovled. That we can trust, and we can love. With no trust, we can have no union. Josh and I.  But that aside, the whole being asked thing, I would have also liked, even if my input and privacy and space were not respected enough to warrant a request, I would have also liked to be TOLD when Josh slept in my bed.  This- this my friends is the truer, and much deeper transgression. Though not being asked was a transgression of sorts, this one runs to the bone.  I wasn't told, for it was thought better that I not know. More than this, it wasn't until a loose lipped aquiantance named Daniel hartley told me, that I ever knew the truth. And my roomates, my brothers in arms, my comrades, my countrymen, my squires, my other muskateers, my friends... they didn't tell me... and worse than this... they never would have...  This my friends, is the true blow to the system. For while I would have gladly given dear Joshua my bed, and all my belongings upon a request from the brother of so dear a friend, I was not asked, more than this, I was not told. And was never to be told. And only discovered by accident. Respect? Honor? Loyalty? Not in this house. Not anymore. And thus tonight I mourn and shed a tear or two for the union that once was... the holy trinity that is now... broken...  Maybe Brando can lift my spirits. New Bev 4 eva.

      THE DEVIL WENT DOWN TO BRONXVILLE  Not really. Just for a night.  It's funny that ,y brother alex made a top ten list of movies. I more think of alex and movies in terms of hatred rather than love. Which is to say that I can more easily see alex's top ten worst movies, or top ten most overrated.   BUt in the meantime I'll say that I have always had more or less of a top ten in my head. But I don't have enough readers for it to be woirth posting.  If I have any readers at all.  Instead I'll say this. I saw Some Like it Hot recently. That's a kick ass movie. Very good structure. It's funny to me that I'll bet everytime people try to make a 'romantic comedy' they check out that movie- but they don't seem to get it.   I love the coen brothers, and I enjoyed their recent effort with George Clooney, but it didn't have any of the same structural genius of something like some like it hot.  I mean- you can take the best movies ever- of all different genres and types, etc. And you can see where true genius lies. I think there's this common horseshit floating in the toilet bowl of life that 'if it accomplishes what it want's to' then the movie is good.  I used to subscribe to this floater, and truth be told, it was for lack of a better understanding. It's the right idea- but it's not just about what something intends to be or do- because who the hell knows what that would be ,really. But what something is. And how something is.   I guess, to be more exact. Is given movie anything? Is it something? And if so? Is it that on all counts, does each cut, and line, and beat, and moment work to be what it is. Maybe thats what people mean when they talk about being what it wants to be.  And maybe not.  I like Lawrence of arabia as much as the next guy- but I think it's been touted to highly. It's just not that fucking good. I mean, it's great, and I won't argue with that, but it's no citizen kane. But I have strange tastes. I just don't think you can see consistent genius in Lawrence of arabia.   You know who gets the shit end of the stick? Akira Kurosawa. Because even though he's known as this kind of ananymous film gurur that Lucas worships, he doesn't get enough credit on his own, while David Lean, John Ford, and Howard Hawks(all of whom I respect and revere and love) garner a shit load of attention.  Kurosawa's movies are all so close to perfect.   Anyway, check out some like it hot. It starts to lose some of it's greatness during the end of the second act- or beg. of the third- but the set up is so tight.  And- as long as we're on the subject of marilyn monroe- I really like The Asphault Jungle- and it's never mentiioned along with the better Huston movies. It's a great opportunity to see Marilyn young and looking as goood as any body ever did on film probably. But it's also a great movie. They say the first real hiest movie- or 'caper' movie.   And With that I must go. On the waterfront at the new bev in an hour or so. Some good young brando. Truth be told I think his best work ever is Last Tango in Paris- and I think he was so great in it because he knew he couldn't fuck around- or thought he couldn't because the director was italian- and thus he gave him more respect. In brando's mind that must have meant tsomething.  -Terry Malloy

      GOOD NEWS!!!!  So the poem was seen by a movie producer and he's optioned a screenplay of it.  The rough part is he demanded that I write two sentences that really introduce each character before they enter the story- like one or two sentences that define the character in a nutshell.   When he first asked me to do this I was really excited, and thought it all kind of ironic considering that the mov was meant to signal my detachment from the industry of dreams, but when in Rome...  In the preliminary meetings I told them I was a little worried that the plot might be spread thin over 120 pages but they maintained that it wouldn't and in fact, it was almost too dense for a mainstream hollywood piece, and I might hqave to find something to cut. Which is also gooing to be difficult given how strongly I feel about the whole thing.  Anyway, very exciting, they're sayig right now that they're in talks with the kid from "One Tree Hill" to play the lead. Which is fucking kick-ass, iof you ask me.  More later...

      I wrote a poem. And I'd really like to share it with everyone. Don't be quick to judge. I used to be into making movies, and... well I guess I sort of realized that all the good ideas have been taken. Like Pieces of April, for example. I heard about it, and thought "Shit. There goes my thanksgiving-family-drama-but-heartwarmingly-funny-and-touching story." So I went home and shredded that screenplay.  Then I saw a trailer for "In the cut" and I lost all hope in the future of my 'detective-thriller-sex-mystery-suspense' screenplay. I shelved my horror movie comedy franchise with the opening of Scary Movie 3, and I burned all the exisisting notes for my foray into the cyber-space-phiosophy-action-adventure-saga with the Matrix films.   Because the thing is, In Hollywood, if you're ideas aren't brand new, then get the fuck out. You know what I'm saying? I guess it's all been one big old reality check. Being a sutdent of film, as well as a lover of cinema, I've realized that I don't have anything to say that isn't about movies. And we all know nobody likes movies that are at all referential to other movies, or to the movie medium. I like movies so much I've been have sex with a 35mm reel o the bicycle theif, which I've never even seen, but I know it's supposed to be pretty fucking good.  Suffice it to say, I've come to see my life as a meanigless excercise in cinematic form, and since I can't string togehter two thoughts without quoting a movie, I bascially think I need to move in another direction ENTIRELY.  So... that said... and thank you for bearing with me... Here is goes...  A Poem By Orson Weldon 'Rising' Speilcock  The kitchen smells the kitchen smells Indiana Jones The kitchen smells.  So? I know, I know. It has a movie reference in it. But You hae to write what you know? right? Thats what the people say. So I wrote what I know. what I really really really KNOW. And I was sitting in my room, Seven Samurai paused on my melted television, and I thought to myself, "George... what do you know?"  And I had a thought. I know that the kitchen smells. And I know Indiana Jones. Like every line practically. So I put pen to paper, and magic happened.  The first draft was about 30 pages, but I winnowed it down, because, less is more, right? And So eventually I got to the bare essentials. Repetition of major themes, and maybe the inroduction of a twist near the act II denoument, and finally a nice resolution that seems somewhat inevitable given the nature of the tale I was unwinding before you.

      Can I just say... having finished young Alex's 'Devil went down to Georgia" epic tale, that I have a few thoughts. Mostly for you, Dear Alex, if you ever read this. For who else will, or does, and do you even?  Firstly, did the devil really go down to Georgia? Or was he already there?   Was liquer the devil? Maybe america? Racism perhaps? Arabs?  Title aside, I enjoyed this tale. No, not as much as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but we can't all be perfect, okay.  I liked that one of the guys was a metro-sexual. I'm thinking Tom Cruise could play that part, maybe Woody Harrelson for the racist brother. And how about Peter Boyle as the deaf father- because he played a racist recently. Shit- fuck Peter Boyle- get James Woods on the horn NOW. I smell an oscar, baby.  Alright, casting aside, let's shoot it in Topanga. Cheaper than flying people out to Georgia, and Georgia wasn't really a big part of the story. In fact, let's change the title to the devil went east of the PCH- something people can relate to.  For the chicks, I'm thinking Jennifer Garner and one of the Olson twins, but we'll wait till she's eighteen and we can show some skin. And the knife part- let's have the sister fall on the knife, then BAM green hornet TV theme plays and Woody Harrelson pulls out a samurai sword and chops the shit out of everyone except for Alex, who I'm thinking either Paul Giamatti or Richard Dryfuss. Maybe Orson Welles, from beyond the grave.  NO - from the grave- we'll make a puppet from his bones. And the cover will be Black, with the white bones of Orson Welles danging from strings and a white drawing of a hand controlling them. Then... the tag line, "Every father's daughter is a virgin" Something like that- with a shadow of Tom Cruise's eyes superimposed over an image of Mary Kate, or Ashely.   This flick is gonna be great. Talk about overseas appeal? Harrelson vrs. Cruise? They'll never know what hit 'em. Play it to the Bone meets The Last Samurai meets Cheers(not the first season) meets Jerry Maguire.  But the crtitics will shit their pants over it. Why? Because its about drama. Human drama. It's about characters. And it's about what happens at a time in you life when... well... when things are confusing. I'm getting an American Grafitti vibe- fuck it- let's make it the fifties- civil rights were big back then, right? Maybe even end on a slow fade of Dr King's speech. Shit, they'll show this one in sunday school.  I've had fun being silly. But honestly I did enjoy the story, Alex. It was long on character descirpiton, and I coulda done with more of the Mom/nurse. Maybe Sally Field? huh?  And what about Pedro? What about Pedro, he asks. I'll tell ya what, kid. two words. Mehki Pfiefer. Thats what. If ya don't like it then your in the wrong buisness.  Harrleson might be too bald- as long as we're running with the mehki thing, then maybe we can get Eminem to appear as the racist brother. Think- it'll be fascinating because he'll be playing himself- or a version of himself- or what people think of him. That'll show 'em, eh?   the only serious thoughts I have on the story, and maybe in some wierd universe this is what my post has been about, is does this story really signify the end of your dark sense of humor alex? Did this venture into the heart of America let you know that it's not funny after all? Almost as if I speant a week with roy in the intensive care unit? Hopefully you can still laugh at such things- though I can understand where the trouble started.  Alll I can say is that it's a fucked up world we live in, my friends, a fucked up world. But, in the words of Ernest Hemmingway via Morgan Freedman(who should play the homeless mugger at the end, by the way) 'and worth fighting for'.  Subesquently, anybody who thinks that line doesn't belong at the end of Se7en(like how I recreated the title- the magic of keyboards-) is flat out wrong. And this means you Peter Klausner.

      MY GREATEST MOVIE GOING EXPERIENCE(S)  What was the greatest movie going experinece of all time? Not movie-- but theatrical experience. I know them off hand and I always have.  Last Picture Show at the new Beverly. I've mentioned it before. Never had seen the movie, and I knew almost nothing of it. It was on the big screen and it transported me. When i stepped out of the theater I looked around the empty street and the sun was shining bright. it was the middle of july- I still felt I was in the reality of the movie. It was quite a feeling.  Chintown/The Godfather. For Chinatown, I was with a close friend and my girlfriend, and we all had a sort of enlightenment within the theater. Seeing Chinatown in a theater(new Bev again) was realy like seeing what I'd always known to be a 'classic' for all it' classic traits. It was undeniably amazing to me, and though I'd seen it before, I'd never seen why. never before this experience did I truly understand the value of the theater. The godfather was s similar experience, but I'd always known it wa sa great movie. The big difference was I was alone, and it was early afternoon, and drizzly outside. Alone, on a dank sunday, the drizzly rain outtside. Tom Tells the Don that Sonny died. I almost cried, and I don't cry. Expecially not for James Caan.  The Kid Stays in the Picture. It was late August, year and a half ago, and I was with my two good friends and roomates. I didn't know what to expect, but being a cinefile I had heard the name 'robert evans' thrown around here and there. The second the curtain parts in the opening credits of the doocumentary I was enchanted- I knew I was in love and I moved away from everyone I was sittting clse to to the front row, and right to the center; I didn't want an ounce of my view of anything but the screen. For the next two hours I was there all the way, totally entranced with the story of Bob Evans. I was for a few days, maybe weeks afterwards too. When Odysseus and co. pass the sirens on their long journey home he demands that he be tied to the mast while the others sail the boat by with wax in their ears so as not to hear their enchanting song. A Common misconception is that the song is sexual, or the attraction to the sirens is physical. It is not. It is because they sing the songs of the great deeds of men, and so all men who aspire to greatness gather arooun them and rot listening, forever entranced with the exploits of old heros. Whenever I watch a movie Like The Kid Stays in the Picture, I've got to be tied to the mast.  I was in 10th grade. Star wars special edition was re-released. Being the attendee of the high school for the hollywood connected, I was invited by a friend to the premiere. It wasn't just magic to see Star Wars, the movie of movies, on the big screen FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER after a life of devotion to it. It was George Lucas sitting four rows behind me. It was walking down the red carpet in Westwood mid afternoon to the fox theater with the emperial theme blaring. In some ways, this was the best.  But it wasn't really. The best was a year later. An afternoon of ditching high school led to a trip to a movie my close friend had seen. We speant a few hours forging IDs so we could get into the R rated flick, and then we took a series of busses down to the santa monica promenade afterwards. Along the way we met up with the brother of another close friend. The movie was Boogie Nights, and like the Kid stays in the picture, which came much later in my life, It was from the first frame, the first shot, the title on the screen on the marquee of the movie theater across the street from the fateful meeting of Jack Horner and Eddie Adams of Torrance, that I KNEW the movie was for me. It was that thought, and that thought never changed, it just grew and grew(and grew and grew and grew and grew). This had never happened to me before.      We weew 17- in high school. WE wanted to be stars- and Sex couldn't have been more fascinating. And movie and stardom couldn't have been exciting- even if it was porn- shit, even better to be a porn star when you're 17. I'd never identified with a character like this(member included you wonder) and it was amazing. Not only that, but my concept of movies changed forever. And they have never been the same. In fact my concept of movies keeps getting more obsessive and more out of control, but this was where it all started for me. It was a kind of fate- it was perfect. It was the best movie going experience of my life because I've been going to movies and thinking of movies and making movies ever since as a result of it. It was my intial inspiration. It was a movie about making movies, and it was a good movie about making movies.   yeah, I never went out and made porn. I don't know it I ever even considered it. It was the surrogate family through the making of movies, it was the love they had for what they did, and how absurd that seemed. How funny it was and how tragic it was. Their art reflected their lives and vice versa and thats how I like it to be. I could go on- but I'll never do my experience justice. We should all be so lucky to have such an experience with something where, in the words of a great great wies man and storyteller we, 'climb up over the mountain top to see stretched before us a path.' The path was clear, and while hurdles have always lay ahead regardless- the path was clear. It was irreplaceable.

      You know, real quick, if you want to read my blog read the whole thing. Nobody asked you to skim.  And yes Pricilla Queen of the Desert is the best movie ever it totally slipped my mind WHAT WAS I THINKING!!!!!!  Any movie could be the best ever depending on the argument and the person making it and the qualifications for best. In my world, Citizen Kane is high on the list. But so is Boogie Nights, and so is Starship Exeter, and thats where some people might disagree.

      Wanted toadd to my previous post that there might have been a minor conbtradiction in my comments regarding ACTING.  I said Brando was amazing, but then put down the notion of actors who disguise themselves with strange voices and silly noses, citing Brando as the anti of this kind of acting.  Then I watched the Godfather again. With the commentary. Which is important to note.  I heard Coppolla discussing How he went to Brando's house to screen test him at the studio's request(Bob Eveans- the villain of any Coppolla commentary), and Brando walks, in a bathrobe, just having woken up. He's got long hair in a pony tail and is 45 years old. He then transforms himself, using tissue paper, and shoe polish into the Don- creating the character i his voice and his face right before Coppolla. This is the age old lesson of how that great character came to be.  I always felt that Brando as the Godfather was a very overrated Brando. AS great as he is(i've mentioend it serval times in regards to this performance) I think the world sees it as his greatest work where I would put about 4 other movies with him in front. But he's still amazing as the godfather- better than anyone else could be, and still one of the best performances ever.  This is getting exessive. my only point is really that I never saw his transformation into the godfather as much of a transformatiion. It isn't like Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New york- a silly voice and a crazy eye doing all work for you(I still have to say I think Danny Day was pretty good in the movie- just WAY overrated and he clearly stole it all from Yosemite Sam). I always took his performance in stride- and it suprised me that he was only 45 when the movie was shot. I never questioned that he was that old- or just really aging when they shot it. And while the voice and jowels add a lot to the character, I think they blend into the character and performance, they do not define it. It's still unmistakeably Marlon Brando. Not really a transformation in the Gary Oldman school of schlocky acting sense.  A character is more than a wig, and a voice, and a prostehtic. It's a person, even if it takes place in outerspace and it's an alien. Admiral Akbar gives a better performance in return of the Jedi than most actors without a mask give. He didn't let the prosthetic do all the work. I don't know how he did it. But he did a great job that guy under the mask. Some of his subtle gestures really tell the story in a way a mask never could. I think of Brando's Jowels like Akbar's mask. They were just tools helping to create a sense of the look and the time etc. They are not the character, and they are not the acting.  But you know what, acting is silly. So this blog is a silly waste of time. You want to know more about great acting. Borrow the Fighting Foxes from me sometime. For a guy who has a lot to say about what makes great acting I can sure pick 'em.  -Larney Scherer

      My brother write a top ten list of movies. I am against movie lists of any kind. And I'm against awards, and commendations, etc. Unless I get one eventually... then i may sin another tune...   Todays top 100 are tommorows middle 100, if you catch my drift. I once said Goodfellas was the second best movie ever made to Citizen Kane. I don't agree with myself anymore, though I see my points. This is to say that we change, and because we change and are in flux, and are among the most fickle of creatures, I think to try and amke solid some kind of definitive list is even more a disservice to onesself than to the movies you so harshly rate.  Regardless, I've alqways been fascinated wit the idea of makiing my own list, and have made many privately over the years. There is no way to make a list unless you set forth sepcifications on what makes a movie great.  Sometime I'll gladly share my specs with anybody interested. But that might get boring here.  I'll start by listing off some of my current tops.  1-Citizen kane why? Because everyone says so. Sounds stupid, but if you think about it it's true. There is a reason so many people agree. It is the perfect movie by classic hollywood standards. Not to mention groundbreaking, not only in technique, but story- the american dream revealed.  From here the list gets wierd... there are many movies that could fill this place. So I list the second tier. which is big.  Goodfellas, Maltese Falcon, Seven Samurai, High and Low, The Godfather, Chinatown, Boogie Nights, Vertigo, The Searchers, Stagecoach, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Last Picture Show, The Gold Rush(fuck you peter(s)), Raging Bull, Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard  to name a few.  I also like Stray Dog, Clockwork Orange, Treasure of Sierra Madre, Godfather II, Resevoir Dogs, Rope, Some like it Hot, High Noon, Unforgiven, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, The Ice Cream Man, Boogie Nights Two,   But- as I write this list, I feel like it's stupid. lists are stupid. There are too many good movies. Why no Casablanca? eh... it's a litttle mushy... No Lawrence of Arabia... yeah, that's a classic, and people like it almost as much as Citizen Kane, and it is pretty fucking amazing... but I'd never put it on a list. Maybe in five years I'll see it again and I will, maybe in 2 months... maybe never- but it has never hit me quite the way these others have.  So why Boogie Nights? Thats a wierd choice among those others. I feel it's in the same line as Godfather, Goodfellas and Citizen Kane- it comes from that kind of story- and it's another great example, like goodfellas, of sound, image, acting, and editing flowing together almost perfectly. A very american dream kind of story- Music too... AND, it's the movie that Really made me love movies and movie making... so again, this whole thing is very personal... how can it not be?  Raiders? Raiders is perfect. Like Star Wars- it imitates, appropriates, consolidates, masticates, and finalizes the pulp serial fun saturday afternoon matinee blah blah blah. And I was reared on them both. They are the model- they are the adventure. Fuck you if you disagree.  Why Rope and Vertigo? Why not Psycho? Why not North by Northwest? The birds? Rope I haven't seen in  awhile, so i might disagree with myself, but Vertigo is a rare movie that changes to me with time. Every look at it has me thinking of other things about it- other interpretations- it's so multi-layerd-- and there is such an abundance of meaning behind it- somethings I think this to be the crowning achievement of a movie-- one that really gets in your head...  Which brings us to Akira Kurosawa. Why do so many filmmakers love him- why are so many of his movies on my list. The abundance of meaning. I've never seen a movie he made that didn't have meaning in spades- all over the place- on many levels- and rarely forced to you, but stated clearly, repeated, and multifaceted. His movies are always about something- or many things- and they are always well crafted to boot. He had a lot to say, and he said it so well... isn't that what making movies is all about? And I've only seen about 7 of his movies...  last Pictiure show- so well put together. There is no other way to say it. you could hate the premise- but the movie is so well crafted- the period, the look, the editing- some great editing.  John Ford. He's a bit dated, and bit overappreciated sometimes. But The movies I listed are, in my umble opinion, tow of his best. the searches is Kurosawa esque in it's depth, and shot as well as any movie ever in terms of scale and beauty. I could go on forever about it. THere are moments in this movie, so understated, but so well crafted and built to, that it makes you want to give up trying to make movies all together. Seven samurai is similar.  Maltese Falcon. the tightest little movie. No mistakes, perfect tension building, perfect pacing... Chinatown is it's sucessor, and it's progeny... they are both perfect though... and that final monologue in maltese falcon... Shit.  Goodfellas... it's synthesis of all great things in movies. An Check out Casino, because it's similar and takes it all a step further... for better or for worse...  Raging Bull. raging fucking bull... man.  For actors, I think there are some standouts. Brando in last tango in paris is the best performance in a movie I've ever seen. Sounds wierd I know, but he takes a finger up the ass.. come on... but seriosuly, he makes every moment real- I don't think he was acting ever, which is pat of what makes him so good.  Also, the only time I ever really felt I saw two people fall in love on screen was Roman Holliday. Don't ask me why. It just worked. I never felt so much like the two people really fell in love. I don't know how you can contain that, or make that work a second time. It seems so random, and strange.  Usually love stories work because we fall in love with the opposite(or same depening on what your into) sex person of the couple.  But, in this situation, it was as though the people fell in love with eachother. Maybe just to me, which I'm fine with.   Great actors come in all shapes and sizes, and probably do best when they serve ht particular movie. Brando seems to be almost detrimental to most movies he's in, which might be why it's not fair to call him the best actor ever. But he is the most real, and has managed to play diffferent character, and always be the same guy, never acting, never stretching... I think that's a kind of genus that remains unparalelled, maybe DeNiro gets there. I've never been one to prefer actors who are cameleonlile. I find that to be artificial. To put on a funny nose, or mask and sudddenly have a wierd voice isn't great acting to me. In some movies it's appropriate, but for most acting the best thing to do to me seems to be being onesself and highlighting that in you wich fits the character best... finding common ground... but who cares, With acting your either good or your not, and mostly your only as good as the editor.  Long bog, eh? Well. it's serious shit. Peter Scheer is still sleeping and Ryan and Peter Klausner went to USC. I'm not going to go to graduate school. Some people think I should. I think I'm going to take some laxitives instead.  I'd like graduate school cause maybe it'll help me get ahead in life, but I think about movies and movie maing too much as it is. it might not be the best idea for me to add more movie making thoughts to the mind of george edelman, if I'm going to try something new I think it should be something new, and as long as movie making is my thing, I think I should try to make some movies. And the one I'm going to make soon, with Ryan, is going to be pretty good.  the whole plan makes sense to me, not to most people. They worry about me and my future. Most people think I'm a bum. And I'm fine with that. I'm fighting the good fight. And I guess I'm having fun, which is most important. Time to take laxitives. Think good thoughts for me.  - Captain Corelli

      We caught Sadam. Something I thought upon hearing the news was the scene that took place when he was found.  I imagined nighttime in Iraq, some soldiers in all that camo shit wandering around, looking for him, as I imagine many have been for sometime now. One of them sees a hole and looks in.  "WHOA! HEY! HOLY SHIT MAN!!!!"  How else could it have happened?  (over walkie talkie)"Dude, Smith, get over here man, I think I found something- don't get all excited and jinzx it- but man... this could be big..."  Regardless, they found the guy living in a hole. And I saw some pics of him when get came out and he looked kind of like my brother. Our mom agrees.  I saw the Godfather today, looking for a little inspiraysh, and just always ready to watch one of the best movies ever. It was eeire.One of my favorite moments is when Brando lifts the sheet over Sonny and says, 'look how they messed with my boy' and the camera holds on him and he- in typical Brando form- seems in every second of his sadness like he is really experiencing every second of the sadness and it's completely real. God bless marlon brando.  Anyway- the moment, I thought was eerily similar to Saddam and his kids- even though it never happened. I remember the images of his sons. It was distrubing. Yes they were very bad people. Some would say they were asking for it. And Sonny was a bad guy too. But the godfather humanizes him. It makes us see the family, and the humanity behind a person who might otherwise seem a monster, and when he father looks on him and says that- all you can think is that once Sonny was a little kid, like the rest of us.  Sympathy for the devil? I don't know what I'm trying to say. But think of how in the end of Casino, when they kill Pesci and his brother so brutally- it's one of the most AWFUL things to watch- to me at least. And yet it fascinates me. How coudl this guy- who over the grueling 3 hours of Casino comes to seem so evil- I have such compassion for him in that moment. It's kind of amazing. Scorsese said it best when he described the moment like this(paraphraase) 'At the end of the day, he's still human like the rest of us, and it really happpened to him- to the real guy."  Amazing.   One more little anecdote. Watched the Last Picture show making of recently, and at the VERY end of it was  aquick little moment with Bogdanovich worth repeating. He says that he and Orson Welles once were talking about Greta Garbo and her talent, and Bogdanovich said to Welles,   "Yeah, but she was only in  two or three good movies"   to this Welles leans in and replies,   "You only need one."  -Martin Orson Speilucascockhitch Wilder Ford Coppola Bogdonovich Kurosawa III

      My brother talked a lot about noses in his blog and my friend Rex Cognidubus talked about having a roman nose, so I feel it is my duty to mention that much maligned centerpiece of the face.  I have a nose. It has always been something I really liked. my nose, that is. In  aworld where people seem to constantly want to change their nose, I always felt mine was quite satisfactory. It's not a point upwards kind of nose, and it's not a long, down snout kind of nose. It's somewhere in the middle. Not too soft, not too tough. Not too straight, not too crooked. Not too wide, not too narrow. And I've always felt that noses have personality. They are the personality of a face. For this reason Nose jobs baffle me. To change ones nose would be as if to say, 'Who I am, in the most instantly recognizeable way, is not good enough' and thats a sad thing. But, that's coming from a guy who liked his nose. Or so you would think...  There was a time when i would box. And night in particular I boxed a friend with whom I'd been having some disagreements with as of late. We boxed hard, and exchanged many blows. Eventually my nose started to bleed and I called the fight due to fear that I broke my nose. I speant the following hours staring in the mirror convinced that my nose was different, staring at it, trying to figure out how it was changed. It was visibly puffy, and swollen, and I looked kind of odd. But my whole face looked odd. Hey, you shoulda seen the other guy...   Regardless, the next day I hopped right out of bed and made a b line for the mirror, hoping that my nose would have returned to it's former state of glory. Well, when i got to the mirror I stared at my nose. It wasn't puffy anymore. It wasn't swollen. It wasn't crooked. But it wasn't the same. I stared, and asked others, and wondered, I pondered. Finallly I gave up asking and wondering because everyone convinced me I was crazy. But my nose has never looked quite the same to me.  Why tell this story? Well maybe you folks can infer the deeper meaning of the whole thing. And maybe you can't. And maybe I'll tell ya.   I guess I'll never think of my nose the same. I haven't ever since then. It's kind of wierd, but now whenever I look at my face My nose seems off to me. It didn't used to. it used to be perfect. Maybe part of me is upset that I betrayed such a nice nose in the act of physical violence, and maybe my nose just changed to reflect the change in me when I became the kind of guy who let people smash his face if he could smash their's back.   Maybe it's because our country was going through a strange time, votes weren't getting counted, buildings were falling from the sky, and so maybe my face became a metaphor, a battleground if you will, on which this cultural upheaval took it's form. Maybe all these things are true, and maybe none of them are. Regadless, my nose has continued to reflect me, and I guess now I'm just worse for the wear. As a great man once said, it's not the years, it's the mileage. And with that, I bid you all good night and god speed.   -The Cap'n

      It's been almost a year since I first saw American Movie.  Almost a year. And what a year it's been.   I'll mention this again around the year mark. Last night I sold some books at Arianna's house. Ed was there. I think I saw Warren. Larry, Penny, the whole gang.  Of course P shceezey was there. And he always is. A good man. Pscheezey.   I miss uncle Bill. I haven't watched American movie in a while cause a shcmuck named Pete Schere used to take out the dvd for it and leave it on the ground while he would play is hippy ass vegan loving horshit music. Whats happened to ths country? WHy does middle america have to lie face down in the dirt of my living room floor while this countries youth blares ani difranco and radio head hippy loving horseshit on my television set while cooking vegan pizza.  Why call it pizza if its vegan. It's not pizza. Not in my country you fucks.  Anyway, if you go to the movies anytime soon, you should think bout this gy daniel hartley when they play the add for the moviefone thing where a guy is in a locker room talking about how easy he gets dates. It's a very daniel hartley type of guy. The long hair.  My brother has really long hair. He's also a hippy. Fuck this country man, it's falling apart with it's long hair. I long for an age where having long hair got your motorcycle knocked over in the middle of the interstate.  -G

      This is a statement I have made for film festivals and such(they ask for such a thing when you submit movies- a directors statement.) it's a challenge to find a meaningful, true, and unpretentious way of discussing your won work while at the same time trying to sell it. It's cvery diffficult, and I didn't enjoy doing it. But I did it for both conrad talbot and the kicker, so if you're interested you can read the statements. and if the movies sound good and you haven't seen 'em yet let me know if you'd like to...  Years ago Ryan Nagata and I conceived of a script for a movie about a prediction for the future made by a science fiction serial of the 1950’s coming true in the modern world. We batted the idea around for a long time, and finally the thought dawned on us that we might have more fun if we just made the science fiction movie and skipped the modern day. More fun? Yes. More work? Without a doubt. “Conrad Talbot and the Voyage to Planet X” can also be defined by the amount of work that fell upon Producer/Co-writer Ryan Nagata and I as we tried to get it finished. With some important (and invaluable) exceptions, this movie was a two-man job. From script to final cut, the process ran the length of close to three years. All the while we were being interrupted by our nagging undergraduate studies. We had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. I never doubted the value of the exercise, and enjoyed (mostly) all of it. It was great to watch everything from “Plan 9 from outer space” to episodes of the original “Star Trek” to “Flash Gordon” serials during our research phase. It was great to take a bunch of guys dressed like space men into an AM-PM after a days shoot. It was great to add period slide shows, effects, and to shoot model space ships on strings. It was all both a love for the science fiction genre and a love for movies in general, specifically the way they age and yet also remain timeless, that made the project so important to me and so impossible to put down. The silliness or fun of a dated or ‘bad’ movie, and also the way in which such a movie defines its time was always at the heart of the project. In a way the character of Conrad Talbot became something of a symbol for this question of a things use, or lack thereof, once it’s time has passed. The ‘modern day’ concept worked its way to the forefront in the end in the guise of challenges the characters would face as they try to adapt to the ever changing universe. More than anything else “Talbot” was a light hearted adventure; an effort to capture the excitement, the suspense, and the social mores of a trip outer space as it might have been seen in the 1950’s.

      What is Adventure?  What is Art?   What is a universe of the mind?  Can anybody REALLY answer such questions, or questschs- if I may- or are they rhetorical and meant only to frustrate us in an efffort to define them.  Is Sienfeld really art? Is the mOna Lisa really art? Is an a construct off the mind? the body? or the soul perhaps? Like Frutopia. The dirnk popular in the early to mid nineties. What a drink it was though. and what a time.  But what is time? Another construct? More government lies? Wil Wheatons Blog anyone?   Let us no waste time defining art, or time, or waste, or us, rather let's continue to assume we have the same basic understanding of things even though the words don't ever quite get the job done. it's not a fullproof system, but When i say art, most people(I stress the word most) know what I'm talking about. Let's keep it that way.   There are far too many things wrong with the world, and worthy of our time/efforts/discussions to waste any more thought of defining things. Things are defined- with or without words. So much so- that sometimes I know what somebody is thinking or feeling just by looking at them. Thats how I play poker. But then again I lose a lot at poker. Sometimes I win and sometimes I lose. But when you drink and do drugs you always lose. And for the record- Potatos are better for you than Bread. End of discush.

      Mad Cows Disease strikes again.  What  bothers me most about Mad Cows disease is that it exists. This is a truly digusting and bizarre problem. To be knowingly feeding cows other cows thus resulting in a disease that's 'brain wasting' in humans-- why? Why do this? Why run such risks. There is the claim that most meat isn't using central nervous tissue. Yeah- but why eat from a cow that has a brain wastig disease in it's body? Who's in charge of saying it's a risk worth taking. Maybe all of us who are eating it.  But there is a degree of trust you give to the institutions that give you your food. Call me naive, but we place a degree of trust in the fact that food we buy at the market isn't gooing to turn around and waste our brains in 3-8 years.  ASk yourself why a government and an industry wouldd lie to it's people, and be careless in such a way that all of us are at risk instantly of brain wasting. Think about why.  THink about the movie Soylent Green. Then think about the movie Ikiru. They are both applicable to these times. In a way, the mad cow's procolomation was that opening shot of Ikiru for America- sure not everybody has seen it that way-- but it might not be a bad idea to take Kenji Watanabe's cue and see it that way.  Regardless, Ikiru is a great movie, and so is Soylent Green. Iff you don 't know why Soylent Green appplies, you should rent it and fidn out, and if you do know you should rent it anyways casue while you probably heard the last line of it a million times you still might want to spend the 90 minutes getting the whole story.  Also, if you liked Kill Bill check out Yojimbo and Sanjuro(they're better).  And if you liked Just Married check out the Butterfly Effect, or maybe Cheaper by the Dozen.  Good will to all Men.

      THE PASSION OF MEL GIBSON    I won't see this movie.     It's not because it's antisemetic. If it even is. Maybe it is and maybe it's not. It's because it's disgusting, and bizarre, and kinda creepy.    I'll admit some curiosity, but I'll also admit little interest in a historically inaccurate, unbelievable graphic depiction of Jesus getting cruzified. First of all, how can there be 2 hours worth(or more- I think it's a little more than 2 hours) of Jesus being cruzified. Is it real time? I guess there are some flashbacks along the way. Assuming one can stomach, and maybe even get off a little on the violence(I'll get back to this real quick) doesn't it seem that if you're going to make a movie about Jesus you'd have something more to say about it than just "This is how he was killed and, let me tell you pal, it was pretty fucking disgusting."    I don't find jesus movies to be much of a draw for me, but obviously jesus is an interesting topic. He's been a pretty important guy- lot's of art center aroound him,great art and creepy loking art,(incidentally all the creepy looking stuff has to do with the cruxifiction). But regardless, I can't think of a better way to limit the impact of the man, the religion, and the culture- no THE HISTORY- it spawned than to limit the story to just how the guy was killed. Even with flashbacks, I don't think Jesus would say- and this might be overstepping a line to assume what jesus would say, but I'm just going on a hunch- I don't think jesus would say "Yes Mel, yes... make the movie about the [part where they killed me, because that was really the defining thing in my life, my teachings, my goal. It was all about the killing part. That was fucking great."    Jesus wouldn't swear. And he might not say that. And I know that in a lot of ways it really is about the fact that he died, for our sins. And the movie is trying to say, "Look what he went through FOR ALL HUMANITY!!!" This very well could be a beautiful idea... watching him suffer for us... the pain, the adrenaline, the gore- it'll be cathartic, it'll be moving, profoundly distrubing, and a deeply religious experience.    But, hold on a second. I had another thought a while back. The killing part, the catharsis of watching his death. You know what Roman people liked? They liked to watch people getting eaten by lions. Or cruxified. They cheered and it was a kind of entertainment. And, in a way, aren't movies for entertainment. And if they are... isn't it kin of weird... kind of ironic... that the horrifying death of Jesus would be given back to us, no commerical breaks, in widescreen for 9 bucks and 7:50 if your a student? Not the teachings. That shits boring and you can go to church for that. Not the love- the idea of compassion, or turning the other cheek. No, rather than being about turning the other cheek much of the hoopla around this movie has been about placing some blame. And making some money it would seem. This movie isn't being screened out of the goodnesss of mels heart in churches everywhere. And he didn't give 25 million dollars to catholic church-he made a movie to touch people. Everywhere.     And lets be honest, had the movie been titled 'the compassion of christ' it wouldn't be nearly as exciting, it wouldn't have nearly the same uproar of media attention, and it wouldn't perform as well at the box office for certain. It would have been like the cartoons on that christian channel. And nobody would have watched it. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED! A great actor once roared to the roman people. Recent polls showed that the american people, by majority, would like to see Saddam and Osama be exectued on TV, perhaps pay per view. Maybe they should be cruxified, thats what George Carlin proposed a while ago. It woudl certainly get high ratings.    So I won't go see this movie. I have an interest in the life and times of christ, but not in the manner in which he was killed. I know it already, and I don't need to watch it to get my rocks off. I'll admit though, there is a very human part of me that is intrigued at the idea of watching what has been described over and over again as an agonizing realization of a truly barberic execution- and feeling something at the sight of it- the power of the sacrifice- but I don't want to give in to that lowest common denomenator. I would like to aspire to something more, to ascend beyond the twisted horror/pleasure of watching a man have his body slowly torn apart. I'll get my horror/pleasure from watching Psycho. Or flipping by Jerry Springer and lingering for a few minutes to see what people will do to get on TV.    Still, I have not seen the movie, And ultimately I pass no judgeement on it's merits as an artistic piece. I didn't go see "Drumline" or "XXX" or "Win a Date with Tad Hamilton" and I find this movie, "The Passion of the Christ" to be in a similar category. Curiosity aside(I was curious about 'Win a Date with Tad Hamilton' for similalry morbid reasons) It's just not something I want to see.

This very well could be a beautiful idea... watching him suffer for us... the pain, the adrenaline, the gore- it'll be cathartic, it'll be moving, profoundly distrubing, and a deeply religious experience.  But, hold on a second. I had another thought a while back. The killing part, the catharsis of watching his death. You know what Roman people liked? They liked to watch people getting eaten by lions. Or cruxified. They cheered and it was a kind of entertainment. And, in a way, aren't movies for entertainment. And if they are... isn't it kin of weird... kind of ironic... that the horrifying death of Jesus would be given back to us, no commerical breaks, in widescreen for 9 bucks and 7:50 if your a student? Not the teachings. That shits boring and you can go to church for that. Not the love- the idea of compassion, or turning the other cheek. No, rather than being about turning the other cheek much of the hoopla around this movie has been about placing some blame. And making some money it would seem. This movie isn't being screened out of the goodnesss of mels heart in churches everywhere. And he didn't give 25 million dollars to catholic church-he made a movie to touch people. Everywhere.   And lets be honest, had the movie been titled 'the compassion of christ' it wouldn't be nearly as exciting, it wouldn't have nearly the same uproar of media attention, and it wouldn't perform as well at the box office for certain. It would have been like the cartoons on that christian channel. And nobody would have watched it. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED! A great actor once roared to the roman people. Recent polls showed that the american people, by majority, would like to see Saddam and Osama be exectued on TV, perhaps pay per view. Maybe they should be cruxified, thats what George Carlin proposed a while ago. It woudl certainly get high ratings.  So I won't go see this movie. I have an interest in the life and times of christ, but not in the manner in which he was killed. I know it already, and I don't need to watch it to get my rocks off. I'll admit though, there is a very human part of me that is intrigued at the idea of watching what has been described over and over again as an agonizing realization of a truly barberic execution- and feeling something at the sight of it- the power of the sacrifice- but I don't want to give in to that lowest common denomenator. I would like to aspire to something more, to ascend beyond the twisted horror/pleasure of watching a man have his body slowly torn apart. I'll get my horror/pleasure from watching Psycho. Or flipping by Jerry Springer and lingering for a few minutes to see what people will do to get on TV.  Still, I have not seen the movie, And ultimately I pass no judgeement on it's merits as an artistic piece. I didn't go see "Drumline" or "XXX" or "Win a Date with Tad Hamilton" and I find this movie, "The Passion of the Christ" to be in a similar category. Curiosity aside(I was curious about 'Win a Date with Tad Hamilton' for similalry morbid reasons) It's just not something I want to see.

      These walls can't talk  In the spirit of semi-zen like blogs I had another zen-like thought recently.   My living room has been uprooted and destroyed. it's not really my living room. It's my parents. And it's really just a lot of rubble and dirt now. It's not really sad- maybe psychologically distruvbing, but I am already fairly psychologically distrubed right now so it's hard for me to say what is the real culprit. Could it be the living room? Maybe. It might be a lot of things that I'll keep from this blog.  Regardless, the roomis more or less gone. It strikes me, in the spirit off wathced pots boiling, that the room no longer exists and that the room saw me grow up. It saw many events in my life. It saw a bunch of thanksgiving pictures taken. It saw us sad when family died. It saw me fall in love once. It saw my mom preganant with my sister. It saw my ssiters whole ife to date. It saw christmas a bunch of times. It saw some fights, and it saw some laughs. It saw a lot of this kind of stuff. It never blinked. It never feekaed out. It never got sad. it never got angry, it never changed. it was just sitting there the whole time, like time lapse photography.  And to think I've only mentioned the big things you can see. It's been there when everyone who lived in that house was in psychological unrest, or joy, or internal suffering or pain, or happpiness, or suprise- feeling you don't show or maybe you doon't even know you have or thoughts that fly through your head and freak you out or get you excitied. All the while the room just sat there and it never blinked.  Sure it never blinked, it doesn't have eyes. And as long as I'm making that pointl, I'll also mention that it can't 'see' any of these things at all given the no eyes thing. But I think you get the underlying point. I mean not jjust to mourn the loss of the atoms that made up the walls and foundtion on whicht he room stood. I mean simply to state the thought I had about those atoms, which was that they saw it all; an observer and participant for all their days. There is a kind of enlightenment to that.   I guess that why people say 'if these walls could talk...' but I'm not really thinking about what the wall would say, because the wall would say nothing. It can't talk and thats the point. It was just there. And we should all be so lucky.  Sorry if this blog is like the last one in i's oddness. Just sharing my thoughts I guess. I hope they are interesting.

      A WATCHED POT ALWAYS BOILS  It's very true. The title of this blog is a recent discovery I made. I had to boil two eggs, and it was my first time in my 22 years of attempting such a thing. In order to to do this I first had to boil some water. And I watched the water boil. And it did.   It too a long time. Very long. When I saw the first bubble rise I thought, 'there we go. Now she'll pick it up and REALLY start to boil." This was not the case. I watched longer and longer and longer and eventually more bubbles rose, and then more. Time passed very slowly, but eventually the pot did boil under my total supervision.  I reccomend this excerscise to everyone simply because it puts to rest not only the comment, 'A Watched pot never boils', but the very notion of such a thing. Obviously it will boil if you watch it. But maybe in ignoring the watchnig part we really do come to a point where we expect it NOT to boil if we watch it. Which is to say that if we leave something, a task tedious as it may be, somehow it will solve itself.  Life is filled with these. I make movies. Movies are like the pot. I make them though. I'm trying to make a website right now. One bubble at a time. And sometimes I want to put my fist through the computer screaming because I just want to SEE my website, perfect and finished. No questions asked. But this is because I am unaccustomed to watching a pot boil, let alone taking part in the prrocess. The pot never gets frustrated when it boils. It goes through the same motion every time. The water never gets bored, or tired. The fire doesn't throw up it's hands in frustration when things don't move fast enough. They all stick it out, take their time, and boilt eh fucking water. Rome wasn't built in a day- sure, I'll beleive that one. But a pot doesn't boil in two seconds either.   I find myself, in general, so result oriented that my entire life is geared towards destinations. How long until we get there, how soon until it's done.. etc. etc. But this is not the point I am finding, and as I realized in watching the pot boil, the pot WILL boil- it is only a matter of time. And to ask the pot to worrry about how long it's taking, or if it's doing this the right way, or if it should try another faster method, or maybe hire another pot or recruit some cleaner watter, or hook up with a better burner... all these things... would be besides the point. The pot would tell you to fuck off because it knows it'll boil and it just needs to sit down, undistrubed and focus for a while, then eventually it'll boil.   The ultimate truth beyond the truth is that once it's boils it's not such a big deal. Drop in yor eggs, move on. Put in the pasta, get the sauce, move on. The pot boiling, no big deal- happened before, it'll happen again. So the end product is ultimately consumed, or forgotten as you slurp down wahtever you needed that boiling water for. What was it all worht then? Just that moment of eating. I guesss some would say so. But I would say it was worth the wait- and worth my attention. People complain that life goes by too fast- mine sure does- but not when you're watching a pot boil it doesn't. You can't believe how slow it gets. Don't watch because your bored, don't watch because you want the eggs hard boiled THAT BADLY, watch because your attention matters.

      4:30 IN THE MORNING  Do you ever what kind of man you are? When you do the things you do, the things that pass the time, do you ever wonder what they amount to?  Not just all the time you might spend on the internet. Or watching Tv, if that's your preference. Not just the time you spend staring at the tiles on your bathroom seeing the pattterns they combine to make for the 5 millionth time. Not just the time you spend at work. Or at school. Or with a loved one, a family member, or a friend. All your time.   Sometimes I look to Indiana Jones, and Robin Hood and others of that ilk, because they seem to always be cool under pressure. They never stress when shits' going badly. they almost enjoy it. They throw themselves at the bad situation- relishing it's peril. And they smile. And then when I get pissy because of the permits required to shoot at certain locations I feel like... well... a dum dum.  But they have hollywood magic on their side. Sometimes I do as well. In my mind.  What kind of man am I? What kind of man are you? And if you're a woman, you don't get to get out of this question. Women still have to be men. Not in the physical sense(thank god) but in the way that we really mean when we say be a man. It's not JUST gender. Though the pressure is on for those of us of the corresponding gender.  This isn't abnout anxiety about being a man. It's just a question. It's a simple question. I think we need to ask ourselves sometimes.  There is a word in ancient greek that I feel has no proper english translation. The word is thumos(spelling may be incorrect). The best I can do is say 'Chutzpah', or 'Balls', or 'Guts', or 'cajones'. But it's more than that. It's spirit. It's energy. It's joy, it's action. Again, our words fail me. We have no direct translation. Because we don't have the word? Because the thing has ceased to exist?  No. It's still there. It is in your hearts my friends. And it is in mine. But we don't know what to call it, and in this world of fickle lables, and in the era of the label-love-affair we are all to ready to disregard a thing which we cannot name in some way.  But it is there my friends. And just because you can't remember what it's called doesn't mean you don't have it in you. And it's not fucking Gatorade by the way. We live in a world in a time clouded by darkness. Whether those of us who are privledged can see it or not. It will take more than this stupid blog. And my loneley early morning/late night thoughts to make the charge for what is good. The bums lost? Perhaps. The yankees are winning. What is good and right is often impossible to see. But something is known. Never forget that my brothers and sisters.  It's not really 4:30 am. But it should be.   Godspeed  -Sandal

      WAITING FROM GRAHAM  Not much to report. Waiting for graham to show up. Kim sleeps in the bed. Roomates passed out and hung over. It'll be a busy weekend. But at least it'll be fun. My bro goes home o New York sunday. But thats not his home. He leaves home. It's kind of sad. Because he is always here ust long enough for me to get used to him being back. then he leaves again. It was nice to have him here though. Improved my mood quite a bit. It's odd. We are two and half years separated(I always said three and he always said two- but we've learned to compromise and understand the principles of mathematics) but we are almost like twisn at times. I used to find it distrubing that I would know exactly what he was thinking because I was thinking it too or had thought it before. We speant lots of time togethe as children. In fact, all our time. And these days it isn't much diffrent unless we are separated geographically.  Another nice thing is we both have twice as many friends because the other one makes good friends and brings them in to share. The line is blurred as to who mis who's friends, and we end up with a nice pool of people. It's a good thing. It used to be wierd for us, but I think we got used to it.  Why is this of any import whatsoever? It's not. I don't want to go to cognitive behavioral tyherpay today, but I have no choice. I'll have to rush to the gym in rush hour traffic. Ver excitied for that. I'll end up late. It's fucking bulsh is what it is.  Incidentally, the translation of Seven Sammies I saw the other night was very odd. it had lots of contemporray things. The one I'm used to is more stiff. They say fuck and shit all the time in the one at the new bev. And at one point Kikuchiyo says, "Those guys cramp my style". Which illicitied a nicely sized laugh from the audience. But to think of a samurai in 16th century japan saying that... I don't Kurosawa would have done it.  Anyway, Long live the movies. They are amazing.

      I saw the Seven Samurai on the big screen last night. I'm still reeling. each time I see it it's better. At this point not a moment of the 3+ hour long epic seems unnecesasary to me. It is the tightest movie, and thats amazing since it's so long. It is truly a masterpiece. I could go on, shot by shot, moment by moment. If uyou really want to hear it ask me in person. I' ll be glad to talk about it endlessly. To think it's a masterpeice and the guy still had a bunch of kick ass amazong movies left to make. A true master of cinema. I know everybody says so, but I must agree.  The whole thing reminded me that there are only a few moments ina any and all of movies that make me cry. One is in Seven Samurai. I'll mention the few.  FUCKED UP WORLD WE LIVE IN  This is the seven samurai one. It's when Kikuchiyo(Toshiro Mifune) runs into the Samurai planning house and throws down the armour the Farmers they have sworn to protect have stripped of dead samurai they had once hunted and killed. Kikuchiyo, being born a farmer but in allegiance with the Samurai, sees clearly this cycle. He screams. How could the farmers be so petty and so evil, but then who can blame them when the Samurai frequently raid their villages, raping and pillaging. The cycle is endless and awful. And after he lets it all out so eloquently, a shot of the group in solemn silence. Heads down. Close up of Kambei(Takeshi Shimura) his eyes well up. Mine too.  DEBBIE!!!  He swoops in on horseback, chases her up a hill. Over the hill in the distance runs Jeffrey Hunter, hoping to stop Uncle Ethan(john Wayne) before he does his worst to poor Debbie, captured by Chief Scar. Ethan cocks his gun, catches up with her, the horse bucks, dust flies, all shot from the dark inside frame of a cave. And then he lifts her up in his arms, as he did nearly 2 hours ago when she was a little girl and their search had yet to begin, "Lets go home Debbie." Always brings a tear to my eye.  "Look how they've messed with my boy..."  It's either this line, when Sonny(James Caan) is shown to Bonesera the undertaker, or the moment when He sighs almost uncontrollably when Tom(Robert Duvall) tells him that Sonny was shot in the causeway. It wasn't until I saw it in the theater that the moment worked for me. Until then it was just Brando as the Godfather-- which always seemed a good but funny perofmrance to me. It worked one day in the theater. And now it always does.  Rosebud. But that almost goes without saying for a film nerd like myself. Not at the beginning. At the end. Chills and sometimes tears.  TATOO 1 and TATOO 2  Up and out of the sunken Lars kitchen. Out onto the homestead. The music starts low, the wind blows strong. He looks off to the suset and orange light basks his face. The greatest advbenture any of us would ever go on sits on his doorstep, and he loooks out like we all do, hoping that it will be so. Hoping he'll find his place. The music swells. gets me EVERY time.  A GAME OF CATCH  He takes a second, after building the field, to play catch with his Dad. Alone. What can I say? I'm a baseball fan and even my hatred of Costner couldn't ruin this moment for me. It's tough to sit through it without some crying.  There are more. And I'll mention them later. But it's poker time. Go watch a good movie and cry.   Godspeed

      THE SONG OF TROY  The Illiad is not the story of a war fought over a 'face that launched a thousand ships". In fact, it is far from such a tale.  When the Illiad begins, the war in troy has been waging for a very long time. And when the Illiad ends, the war in troy is far from over. It is not about who wins. Not in such a small sense as a war.   Achilles is the hero of The Illiad, and to put it simply, he is a god among men. the greatest of all warriors. In the end, the Illiad is about the fact that no matter how great a man Achilles is, he is still just a man, and in the end he will face the very same fate all men do. Whether it be in battle, or of old age. His greatest will fade as he dies.  When Hollywood's intention to make the movie 'Troy' became clear I was excitied. Wow. One of my favorite books will be a major motion picture. But now, as we near the release date, I hyave started to fear the movie.  Hollywood does this thing... it's not just as simple as slapping a happy face on a sad tale. But Hollywood does this thing that can be best described as coloring by numbers. I saw this movie 'Hidalgo' which had many opportunities to be interesting but managed to choose 'poorly' at every turn. It was a movie hell bent on coloring by numbers. It had to fit it's story into the numbers. Some stories fit quite well. Like "A Beautiful Mind". So it's a big award winner, and a pretty good movie. Hidalgo did not fit so well. And sometimes movies are made outside the formula, and sometimes movies made with the formual still managed to be interesting- somehow.  But the song of troy, and more importantly, of the wrath of achilles, is not a song that fits the formula. And I join the ranks of countless book-to-movie naysayers when i say that the book, one of the oldest and most enduring classics of our time,  will be gutted. I hope I'm wrong. But I can';t help but be pessimistic when i see a trailer that opens with King Priam discussing the value of fighting a war for love.  JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. Even the myths and stories that revolve around the 'love' between Paris and Helen aren't so clear. What TROY will be is today's values slapped onto Yesterdays text and yesterdays words.   The inciting incident in the illiad is not Helen and Paris running off to troy. It is Achilles refusing to continue to fight for Agamemnon since Agamemnon has taken the woman achilles won in the most recent battle at Troy.   Why is this not appealing to us today? Well, Achilles sense of entitlement makes for a kind of unlikeable hero by todays american standards. But we must remember- the idea of Achilles is not to make a man by todays standards- but a man who is greater than any man can be- he is any of us realized to the fullest potential. And even he is snubbed. He is snubbed in the beginning by King of men Agamemnon, and he is snubbed long after the book ends when he dies.  The war in troy has been going on for ten years when the book starts. And the book ends a few weeks later. Not even a month later. The narrowness of the time frame shows us more the story of Achillles, and Hektor, than the story of troy. In fact, i think paris is really a non-issue to the Illiad. And he should be. He should be a two minute prologue. He's ridiculous. I like the idea of trying to show the conflict between Hektor and Paris- but fuck that. I don't think was any conflict. I think Hektor was so noble, he took his job of protector of the city on.  GOD as I think of this book and remember it I can only think of it's complexity and genius. The acts of Achilles, the path of him, as one of the earliest examples of the tragic hero- is so great, and so powerful to the greater narrative of Troy, that the implications about war, humanity, religion(the role of the gods in this case) mortality, freidnship etc. But if there is one thing I didn't get too much of a sense of in the Illiad it's romantic love. And that's clearly what the movie TROY wasn'ts to make as it's inciting conflict. So it's Okay. Troy isn't the illiad. It's about the fall of troy literally. Maybe that's why they called it troy.The word illiad means 'sgon of troy'- but I think thats a clever title implicating that the events of the book point to the ultimate end of troy, etc. etc. But this is frustrating because the illiad is such a great book they should make a real movie out of it. Not a kind of colage of veraios myths surrounding it and it itself. amybe I underestimate them. But I want them to prove me wrong.  Ahh but the ending is so great. I hope they don't fuck up the Hector character and his part of the story. My guess is they'll get it about 50% right. That'll be close- but the spirit of the book will be missing. And without that spirit and perspective guiding- directing- the film, if you will, it will not sing. Which is to say I wish I could have directed the film. But for now I'll read the book- or parts of it. And I'll leave you with the first line: "Sing, goddess, the wrath of Achilles, son of Peleus, and it's devastation..."

      There is a song. "Wish you were here..." by pink floyd. The first time I really listened to it was on a raod trip to Santa Cruz. We were already there and driving around on a gorgeous spring day. It was a few years ago. I had a short in a local film festival. We drove around, trying to get the lay of the land. I remember riusing up over a hill in the road and coming down it to see a giant pier like place. An amusement park, without many people. The giant ferris wheel- the one that stands up like a wheel and spins people high then brings them down. If thats a ferris wheel. I guess the ocean/bay was beyond it. But I remember the sky more. It was beautiful.  And I remember playing in Molly Malones on the juke box while having a few drinks(during a time when I was more likely to) and seeing my brother after he came back for the first time to visit from his New York College Sarah Lawrence. The bar was not crowded. My friend and I had both selected the song with our money without knowing it.  Once I was driving late at night with my two friends, one of whom was from Switzerland and I only see him every few years or so. We had a great time while he was here. And as they passed a smoke between them on the overpass between the 10 westbound and the 405 soouthbound to LAX, i heard those familiar soft tune, and the lone guitar plucks that begin 'Wish you were here...' and I raised the volume. How appropriate, I thought, as we sped down the freeway, saying our silent goodbyes.  Last night it came on my brothers ipod as we drove home to pacific palisades after a night at the Dive we and friends frequent. I hadn't heard the song in a while. My brother was back again from school not wanting to go back. I was getting over and through a very stange post collegiate time in my life- I still am.   And today on the way to doctor in Bev. Hills while driving on sunset through Bretnwoood. I sought it out on the ipod Alex had left in my car the night before. I blasted it and it sounded pretty good. Still a nice day. The song was short, but sweet. I thought about it, and you can't hand on to any line or moment in it, it just kind of passes by, a few choruses a few verses. The long intro- waiting for it to get started. But it seems to be over before you know, and it leaves you wanting more. But you can always play it again.

      FREE REVIEWS  I've seen some movies recently. And I'm gonna write some FREE REVIEWS.  GODS AND MONSTERS is a movie about a man who made movies. And it Stars Ian McKellan as the guy himself, James Whale. Maker of Frankenstien and Bride of Frankenstien. He falls for a guy who cuts his lawn and has a eerie resemblance to the monster(Brendan Fraser- sorry if I spelled his name wrong). I heard somebody(I think it was my mom) describe this movie as Sunset Boulevarde with a gay man. But this is not entirely fair- though it is a 'good call' as we say in the vernacular.   Where Sunset Boulevarde is a big ole' heaping microcosm(what a contradiction), Gods and Monsters is a very localized idea. Susnet Boulevrade is about the way in which Hollywood does what it does to the people inside and out. And G&M is about one guy who had this happen to him.  Well, ths was going to get interesting- but My girlfriend is here, and I have to go to a bar. The problem is I should drink. But I don't think I will because I'll also drive. And even one drink makes me uncomfortable to drive- even thoug I'd be fine and under the legal limit. I end up pounding glasses of water after glasses of water and them my mouth goes numb from all the cold water and then I feel like I'm slurring my words and maybe I am drunk- it's a bad twaysh.  Plus which I feel wierd right now because I just do and I want to take my medicine. But I should wait until after the bar.  P.S.- I have been working at the story boards of the movie that is a carrot on a string dangled in front of me but always out of reach. In a week or more I've no finished the first scene. Is this part of being obsessive compulsive. Probably. But I have a motto when it comes to making movies. SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF. I'll explain this idea at as later date- but it's a good thing to remember at all times- but especiall when makin a movie. And as lon as we're on the topic of sweat- I am sweating like a pig due to this heat.   -Captain Anthony Lewis

      Hello friends.  I am growing a beard. Why? Why not? It seems perfectly appropriate. I may shave my head too. We'll see.  When did drinking become so important? When I watch a western I see guys guzzle liquor and it's cool. Like in "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" when John Wayne storms into the bar and guzzles shot after shot of whiskey, then just takes the bottle and leaves. Thats cool. But thats also a movie. And in real life John Wayne wasn't so cool.  And in real life when I find myself sitting at my office(Cafe Balcony on Rochester adjacent to the intersection of santa monica boulevard and Centinela- stop in anytime) I often overhear young people, my age or younger or older perhaps, discussing the amount they drink, what they drink and how often they drink it. This isn't cool. It's not uncool though- because it's dangerous. It's just sad.  It's sad because drinking in and of itself isn't much of a thing to do. Drinking is okay when you got laid off. It's okay when you won the lottery. It's okay when you got dumped, or stood up. It's okay if it's the office christmas party. It's okay if you just shot liberty valance but Jimmy Stewart's gonna take the credit AND get the girl. And it's even okay if you're out some night having a good time. But it's not okay every night. It's not okay most nights. It's not okay every time you wanna have fun. Or most times. Or even half the times.  Because there is a lot more to life and being alive than liquor. I ain't no preacher, and I ain't getttin on no high horse. What you do with your liver is your buisness. All I'm tryin' to say is that drinking, in an of itself, is no particular achievment. It's nothng to be proud of. Anybody can do it-- and most peeps do. And anybody can do it A LOT. and, again sadly, most peeps do.   So to wrap this up for ya, don't go wandering around talking abnout how you drank a bottle of malibu last night at Jimmy's house. Or how in your prime you could do century club five nights in a row. And don't go braggin' about spending nights shooting tequila and writing down how many shots you took because you watched a Hugh Jackman flick.   I'm sure every being has something, one special thing, that they can do. And while there is, according to this world view, somebody who got the 'drinking' skill as their one special thing, it's probably not you, and it's probably not a skill you want for your one special thing anyway. Whoever is the guy who has the one special thing of drinking is probably not even reading this and probably doesn't talk about how cool he is for drinking so much. He's a very sad guy, in all liklihood, and he's probably somwhere drinking right now. As I write this, and as you read it and at all times.   Point is folks, drinking is fun. But it's no special achievement by any means. I don't care who does it and how much, but I just get down when i hear people talking about how good they are at or how much they can drink. I want to grab that person and shake them and say, 'SNAP OUT OF IT DAMNIT! YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS!'  If you can't tell already I find this blog to be very psychologically revealing of myself. Now that it's all written and done with. Perhaps I'll go rewatch "Tapestry" on Season 6.  Godspeed to you all.  -Gfunk

      A BARRELL OF MONKEYS  Did I misspell the word barrell? is it barell? no. Is it Barrel? No. Whatever. I'm sure God will forgive me.  But can I forgive myself? My medicine doesn't seem to be working so well right now. Earlier today it was working fine. But it was hot and I was sweating and I felt disgusting. I was trying to draw some pictures of a man of latin american descent slowly sinking into quicksand, but I made very little progress. I was on the same drawings yesterday. I started the quicksand episode yesterday, and today I didn't finish it. But I speant some time on the thing.  I never felt okay with "Bringin' down th House". But now I have confirmation from Dr. B. I had an idea for a character named Dr. Bentley Pennyworth. An African american doctor. A doctor of what you ask? A doctor of life- but posing as a doctor of the cinema. Just as the real doctor b was today. Did he heal the cinema? No. But he had a good diagnosis. I don't think cinema needs to get a second opinion.  Why isn't the medicine working? Can somebody tell me?* Should I up the dosage? Maybe not. I fear this is punishment for having 3/4 of a bud light last night. It was an error in judgement. But does this mean I can't have my Sake tonight? I was so excited about trying Sake, and now it seems like it might not be the best idea.  *This punctuation mark was originally a period, but was changed to a question mark after some thought. We apologize if this is in any way inconvieneit. And we apologize for misspelling the word that ended the sentence prior to this one and any grammitcal or spelllling errors through the piece. Thank you for you patience.  Whew. Glad we got that out of the way. Well it's time to go. I watched Far From Heaven today. At USC. I don't go to USC. Lots of people do though. And they were all wlaking around and I happened to run into somebody I knew there. Small world? Not really. Small campus. Perhaps. Regardless, I love you.

      Wnat to read my lastest short story? Okay. but first let me tell you about last night...  If you had to become a brand of sugar what would you choose? C&H? Cause island boys just love that cane?  Back to last night...  My roomates called me into one of their rooms one night. I had heard a lot of laughing and they called me in. So I went to see what was so funny. They were both lying on the ground mostly naked, but each hadm some thick fluffy brown substance coming out of their mouths and dripping all over the floor. I was a little wierded out as you can imagine, so I started to speak..  "Guys... Wh-"  Then one of them cut me off. Hence the "-". The one who cut me off was named peter. Beyond that I can't help you.  He said,   "We're playing Dinosaur. Come play a round."  "Whats that?"  "I said we're playing Dinosuar. Don't you want next game?"  I rubbed my eyes and saw they were actually sitting on the edge of their bed and they were playing video games. I leeft the room, reached into my lamp and tossed my bottle of Whiskey out the window.  with no further postponement.  My recent Short story:  "IF YA TRY SOMETIMES" or "CHI-NEEE BEER BEFORE BEDTIME"  A very nice young man was going to a studio at night to see if he could talk to a woman he knew in accounting. He was hoping she could help him out. The guards wouldn't let him in. And his budddy Simon came by and talked to him on a bench.  Then they tried to get in again but they couldn't. Finally they remember the friends anmed and the young man was allowed to see her. He handed her his scrreenplay and told her all about his project. She was very excited because the young man was so nice. But then, one of his peers arrrived and told the nice accountant lady that she would have to hear the beginning of this story before she commited to help the man.  "It will shock you, dear madame, and whilst I know it seems this young man is a wonderful person of purest intentions, you must read the first part of this story before you help him. It is of the utmost importance."  The nice accountant lady was a little taken aback. But obliged and took the paperback copy of this very story you read right now, becuase in the context of this story the story itself has been printed and published.  REgardless, the lady begins to read the book and sees that it all started one night at a party. The nice young man was having a little 'get together' with some mates of his. Three ladies came to join them. They were all sittting in various places on a counter in a kitchen. It was a kitchen in a school or some kind of institution.  They listedn to some music.  The three friends, nice young man included, talked of which of the three they preferred among the lady folk. The three ladyfolk were very different. One was a brunette with short straight hair. One was a Brunette with longer curly hair. And the last of the three was a blonde with a large bust but was otherwise somewhat plain. The nice young man preferred the brunette with short straight hair. They did not diuscuss the matter much more.  Later in the evening the blonde girl was quite intoxicated and she sat on the couch with the nice young man. They talked and giggled and the nice yooung man knew he had to be with her if was going to be with any of the lady folk since this was the once who took an interest in him.   The lights went out and the Nice young man convinced the hesitant young girl to take their innocent and playful flirting to the next level and have sexual intercourse. The young girl was hesistant, as previously stated, but eventually she agreed. They had intercourse for sometime, against her own better judgement. She began to cry. The nice young man lifted his hands to his face, and suddenly saw there was blood all over them, dripping down them, loud dramatic music played, and the camera spinned around the man as he lifted his hands and we see the young girl dead, white, lying before him. But now she was no longer the blone, but the brunette with long curly hair. The nice young man screamed.   The nice accountant lady closed the book and spoke.  "Yes. I understand now why the nice young man musn't receive my help on his project. It is a shame though."  The pain of the truth and the realization left the many to disperse into few and eventually none. The nice young man went home slowly. Now he remembered it all, like it was from a past life, and he could say nothing in his defense. Even he had forgotten how the story began.

      TRUER WORDS WERE NEVER SPOKEN  The key to blogging is not having anybody rad your blogs and writing them only when in a rush to do something else. Sandwiching them between other things tat you have to do. So then the blog itself becomes a small little window into a moment that is a complete waste of valueed time.  You see where I'm coming from? Perhaps you do not. In any case I watch cartoons from time to time. Which reminds me of a great movie quote. i saw this old 1970's mystery once callled 'The Last of Shiela' and the whole thing took place on a boat. There was one guy who was kind of running the whole mystery and he has this series of riddle to let the other people on the boat know what the next thing is.. or somthing like that... anyway, I'll never forget that at one point he is speeding away from the main boat in a small motor boat and he looks back to the people on the main boat(or Yacht I suppose) and he screams to them, surf flying everywhere, "Tonight... The Homo-sexual."  And he said it just like that. He put the stress on Homo and sexual kind of followed quitely. Very... very aloofly.  Speaking of Mark Boarchardt Let's talk about him for a while.  Let's not. There is little time. Wish me the best.  -Stanley Goodspeed and Clark Dooghan and Jimmy Doohan and, of course, Jack Marshall.

      RED BEARD  Time ticks away. I don't have much free. I need some people to start returning my phone calls. I'm getting knee deep in the sludge that is preproduction but I'm enjoying it very much. As we push on thru to the other side-- Thru. It's so much better than Through. It makes so much more sense and saves you some of the time/cost of typing those extra letters.  That aside- real fast-- why is the Office so great? I mean- whats so great about it? I can't really find anything too funny so long as it has an english accent. Let me re-phrase that. I can't find anything with an english funnny - if it's trying to be funny. English people really aren't very funny to me. Their sense of humor seems off.  THis excludes Charlie Chaplin, and I imagine a great number of funny people. Includibng things from Monty Python.   So what is this really about? It's about the office. I mean, it's kinda funy. But people at work not taking it very seriously.. it's just not all that funny to me. They just sit around and act english. In england it seems as though just the slightest deviation from the status quo is enough grounds to be called humor. I don't understand this. But I love it.  Did I say that I loved it? I was kidding. I had a dream last night But I don't really remember much of it. But I know I had it.  Today at the gym I toook a shower. it smelled. The shower did. It's kind of hard to imagien your getting lceaner if your in a place that smells.  Speaking of smells, there is this one guy at the gym who smells so godawful. It's hard to describe. He smells befre he even st arts working out. he just fucking stinks. Why? Who am I to say.  One more thing- and then I'll be one my merry way. I'm going to post less and less often as now I will begin tot focus more and mor energy on the movie which brings me great joy and happiness. The movie is a big deal for us and it will be something worth seeing. I'll send you a copy some day. If you ever let me know that you want one. And iff you want to help make the movie, just give me a call. my new cell phone numer is 310 569 3325. And if it's wierd to put your phone # on the internet then too bad. Casue I just did.  Oh yeah- Red Beard. Good stuff. Little lengthy. But It was interesting. Only really interesting if you watch a lot of AK's movies and love them to some degree and then you watch this one after seeing the rest.  And that, my friends, is that.  -Daniela Hartley

      SHATTERED ASS  Very late. Very behind shcedual. Saw Shattered Glass starring Hayden Christenson. All things considered it would have been best to have missed this one entirely. The Haydez is one of the worst actors to ever perform. I only know of one who might be worse. He is worse probably. But Haydze is the second worst Actors I've ever seen. I've seen preschoolers be more convincing then this guy. It's disgusting.  Regardless, he is playing anakin skywalker, so part of me... has to think he's cool... and you have no idea how much that tears me apart.  But another part of me wants to address a fascinating issue brought to my attnetion about the movie/scandal of Stephen Glass. Is it at all posssible, that given our placement in a time so deeply saturated in a media that is so pervasive and so twisted and untrsutable, coming at you from all kinds of angles of self interest and agenda, that we no longer turly believe in an unbiased media, let alone a truth that is to be found?  The title "Shatteted Glass" says it all about this movie. A silly effort to create a double entendre that is as stupid as it is appropriate to the subject matter. But at the same time, within that very obvious and klunky title(an effort at some sort of wit) there is a concept worth exploring. Could the shattered not just be the lens of Haydes glasses(as it is in the poster) or the viel of lies that support and protect Glass' articles, but to the state of the truth? Or what pieces are left of it?  And if this is possible, or so, could one not then conclude that the greater question is how much less ture is Glasses' made up media when we have been raised to questions doubt, and fear every media and it's point of origin.  Yes yes. I know its a stretch. But have you ever watched Fox news? Did you watch it cover the war? Biased? Certainly. Made up? Not quite. But is it such a shock that some guy wanted to make the news more sensational and interesting so he just started making it up? Is that so far removed from where we are now? Why didn't the movie ask these questions. I can't take total credit for this perspective on the whole thing.  I watched a few minutes of a Jesus special on CNN. And I also flipped by a thing on animal planet where dogs were jumping into these giant pools of water- each to see how far they could get. The dogs were jumping really far. It looked like that wire shit made popular by "Crouching Tiger". But the dogs weren't really jjumping to jump farther than any other dogs. They were jumping to catch a fake Duck that was thrown in front of them. But they were being valued for the distance of their jump. As far as they were concenred though- it was all about the duck. The reward. They had no clue as to the competition- the goal of have a really great jump. The whole point of the fucking excercise.  Back to Stephen Glass and the media. When Stephen Glass writes an article to put in "TNR" isn't he writing to forward his career? To make some cash? To buy some food? Duck perhaps? Is he even really aware of the 'true' objective. Which is report the news... Is anybody? And doesn't this beg the question... are we just living in a fully self conscious hamster wheel of sorts with an articficual duck with a picture of one of our presidents on it is tossed before us. We jump, sometimes far, and we land in the water. Then everybody gets excitied because we got so far. But weren't we really after the duck?  And didn't we really just get mad at Stephen Glass for not paying any attention to the jump or the distance and thinking only of catching the duck. So we saw him do it. we saw the mechanism at work. What a fruad. Stephen was after the duck. Not the distance jump- which has so much integrity. But can we blame Stephen? Wasn't he raised to believe that he should just go after the duck? Isn't that his... nature....?  More questions. nature. Can we overcome it? Can we overcome the desire to catch the fake duck and really just focus on the integrity of the long jump. Yes. Sometimes. Always? no. Sometimes we'll just go for the duck. But we have to try. Try to be more. And in that effort, my brothers, lies our salvation.  Love and warmth,  goodnite and godbless.  -Mortimer Snerd AKA George Edelman (with help from the forms)

      NOBODY READS THIS  So I'll say some things that are kind of nerdy and deeply part of who I am.  I view the worlds in tersm of star trek. And not the next generation. In every group of people there is a kIrk spock and mccoy. And in every indifividual person there are the three componenets.  Plato spoke of the tripartied soul. This would be the reason, the appetite, and the thumos(which was previously mentioned here as the essence of balls, spirit, bravery, passion/action etc..   Well We all know how Spock Kirk and Bones fit into that. In every group of three you can find who fills which role. But I have some trouble with my roomates.  If it is the three of us and our home is the ship. I think forst of type casting. Klausner is Kirk. The blonde hair, a little shorter, perhaps a bit prettier than the others(circa original series). I would be spock. Taller. Brainier. LEss visisbly emotiional. Short black hair. And Scheer is mcCoy. By defautl almost.  But then when I think of our personalities and viewpoints it is quite diffferent. Then Klausner is McCoy. Traditional values- incredibly stubborn and argumentative. Outspokenly emotional. And Scheer is Spock. Very given to a stark, simplistic notion of the world as a post modern place.Emotional yes, but frequently withou a significant other, and always on the opposite end of the spectrum from klausner in terms of beliefs. Also he is the one who is 'different'.   And I become Kirk. THe leader, but also the middle groun d. Slightly tradional, but ultimately aware of the post modern stark state of the world we live in. Is spock really post modern? No. But he is very willing to bereal everything down into components and see them as separate parts of one whole. Hr is not attached to things or people. He percives things very much as they are.   And whenever kirk leaves the ship things don't get done. Like the bills don't get paid until he opens them. The trash doesn't get taken out until he makes a big push for it. And if it's a drinking night oin board, if Kirk abstains the general energy goes down. If he is pissy the wole modd is one of darkness. If he makes a movie everybody jumps on board.  But Ultiomately. WE are all of all the characters. Hence the beauty of the orignal star trek and Plato. The ultimate difference of the next genreation is that it is not a microcosm of a being, but a family functioning. With picard a father, the doc is the mother being very healing and nurturing- invovled with dad ut no tooo overtly sexual. Riker is the first born. Troi is the teenage girl from a broken home who dated the first born but moved out and lives with his family now. Geordi is the whiz kid. Data is the youngest. Worf is the adopted child whp's ways are mystyerious and bizzare but we love him anyways. Q is the nieghborhood bully. Data could also be the adopted child and Worf could be the family dog- like the watch dog.  Either way they funtiona as a perfect whole as a family. The orignal ship as one being broken into may parts.   Eat poo. It's tasty and it's big over in great brittain these days.  Go to Grahamaldis.com via internet explorer. You'll see some stuff from my movie the kicker, and soon you'll see tests shot for my nexty big project- the search for the golden bird.  by the way my new phone number is 310 569 3325  love ya.  -Captain James Tiberius Kirk

      ADDENDUM  Sorry for the misspelling. Check out the last few blogs.  I re-read the last blog and realized we can't really help who we ar. We can fight it. We can challewnge it. We can quit the habit. But in the end, we will be who we are. We would always be who we would. There is no fighting it. It is both divine and tragic. And hysterical.   I wise man once told me(and us incidentally) "I am what I am and thats all what I am." Truer words were never spoken.  Sorry for all the fuck-ups,  Hank(me) and Popeye(also me)

      EVERYBODY PUKES...  We all make mistakes. And by 'we' I mean 'I'.   25$.   But it was more than that. Can we really forgive ourselves. Can I really forgive myself. And it's not just hte money. I should. Others tell me I must. Doctors. Lawyers. Friends. Lovers. Strangers. But can I? This will be the truest question of them all.   I don't know. But I guess I should try.

      EBONY PENE   LITTLE BILLY: What happens when we die?  UNCLE GRAHAM: Well. Nothing. We end. WE rot. Our bodies decompose. It's really awful. I hope I don't have aids.  COUSIN LARRY: Actually thats not entirely true. Our consciousness as we know it ceases to exist- but our many particles breakdown and reform into other things.  MICHAEL JORDAN: What do you mean by 'you people'?  UNCLE GRAHAM: Do you think I have aids. I'm serieous... I'm really concerned about this...  LITTLE BILLY: I'm scared...  BILLY GRAHAM: DOn't worry son. If you never have sex with a man you'll go to heaven. But if you do have sex with a man then your soul will rot in hell for eternity.  COUSIN LARRY: Our particles will continue to exist in other beings and creatures and plants and in a way, part of us lives one forever, shifting, changing, all as one big thing flowing- a giant cosmic dance that is existence. Plato would say-  UNCLE GRAHAM: But I really think I might have aids... I had sex once, the condom fell off...  MICHAEL JORDAN: Do my pecs look bigger to you guys than before?   LITTLE BILLY: I'm scared...  COUSIN LARRY: Don't be scared billly.  UNCLE GRAHAM: I wish it were that easy.  BILLY GRAHAM: You only should be scaed if you are gay billy. Or black.  MICHAEL JORDAN: Yo tthat is is whack BG.  BILLY GRAHAM: Sorry homes.  MICHAEL JORDAN: It's cool homey.  UNCLE GRAHAM: Can somebody look at this lesion on my arm? Is this AIDS?  COUSIN LARRY: Don't stress Uncle Graham.  MICHAEL JORDAN: Fo' sheeeeeeeezeeey, yo.

      SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL  Fourteen hours ago and one hundred 17 years ago my great grandfather was born. His name was Myer Adlermensch of both german and russian ancestry. He was born in america. His parents were immigrants. He was born poor.   It didn't take long for him to fail out of school. Possibly in the 4rth grade. But instantly he knew he had to help supporty his family. He was the child of immigrants. He worked as a delivery boy for newspapers. Soon he opened what would be known as a wafle cart. He would ride this 'cart' pulled by horses, through the streets sel;ling waffles out of his carriage. It went from waffles to barrells of liquor he brought in to speakeasy's during porhibition.   Eventually is became more than just waffles and illeagal booz and by the time the depression rolled around this man, this illietrate man, was doing just fine with his own trucking company. Ironically enough the company became a big transporter of film reels from production facilities to theaters all over the east coast. He brought people the movies.  Another great grandfather of mine was born Henry Pearlman. word has it my great grandmother only married him because he was the only guy in New York with a car. Regardless, he went on to own a insulation company- they manufactured styrofoam and put it in ships, buildings etc. etc. He also had a big collection of Cezannes you can go check out at Princeton.  One of my other great grandfathers was a merchant of furs. The other a dentist. The point is these men were good men who worked hard. And they earned their place and many would say as immigrants they lived the american dream.  Well thats one version of the american dream. Another is this picture of naked guys with plastic bags over their heads piled up in a jail cell with a few people smiing giving the camera a 'thumbs up'.  But either way, I drove across this great nation. And I understand why people loved it so. It's quite beautiful. But the people in the gas stations were really creepy. So, the moral of the story is you have to take the goood with the bad. In many parts of teh world you'd take a detour on your vacation to check out a mossk people make a pilgrimage to each year, or a temple, or a basilica, or a wonder off the world. In America we have something like that. It's called graceland.  Part of me likes that our pilgrimage is to Memphis Tennesee to check out the home of the late pop star who ate/pill popped himself to death. Of course in many places and in many empires the death of a saint, or a god, or a god's son would be the stuff of legend and mystery. For us it's a fat guy who died on his toilet in the deep south. I guess that sums it all up for ya.  America is a funny place. It still doesn' make complete sense to me, but by God I love it. It was nice to see her, warts and all. This truly is God's country my freinds. And don't let any communists tell you otherwise.

      TUCMCARI, NEW MEXICO  On my long drive across the continental united states I had many thoughts. They ranged from earth shattering, to profound, to simple, to silly, to absurd and to stupid. I wanted to write many of them down in this blog. But I never really had the time.  I learned some good thigs. And I forgot some of the good things I learned. That seeems to happen far to often. I have taken to writing everything down, but usually I lose stuff like that or it just piles up and I never look at it anyway.  The point is, while enjoying the Oklahoma sunset, I realized that all of these profund thoughts could be stored, recorded, turned into screenplays, or chapters in my novel, or 'blog' entries. I could have said them to my brother while he drove and feighned interest. I could tell them to people when they ask me 'how was your trip', but I realized that all of this was unnecessary. I had those thoughts. Some would be forgotten and lost. And no matter how important or valuable, they wouldn't amount to hill of beans because one day we die, and nobody counts up how many great thoughts you stored. They all go as quick as they came.  And with that I decided not to attempt to communicate the thoughts. I had them. They are over. Perhaps they will work their way into my work and my being. And perhaps not.

      DRIVING ACROSS JERSEY  Today we woke up at 11. There was a bangin' on my door. But it's not really my door. It's 'Rob's' door. Robs room managed to be prety disgusting even though he had moved everything out of it. The floor through his room and Alex's 'home' was coated with dirt. Getting out of the shower was strange because the walk back to the room made me feel much dirtier then I ever havew before.  REgardless, when i woke I had a giant huge headache. I have not slept more than 3 hours in days. Many days. And add to that that I drank too much last night at my brother's insistance.  I also met a man who wears really tight clothes, takes sdteroids and is incredibly closeted.  But that is niehter here nor there. I can tell you a few things. Jersey smells funny. And I tried to hold my breath the whole time we drove across it. Driving across it reminded me of a great film I once saw.  We entered pittsburgh only to find a storm. A lighting storm. We battened down the hatches and weathered the storm. But it was rough. At one point we could see nothing outswide the car but water. Like it was submerged in water. And lightening. The lightening was constant and loud and really near us. It was insane. And it was exciting.   My headache went away eventually, but I could not keep my eyes open. I tried to drive, but fiound it very hard to stay awake. My plan to wean myself off long nights of sleep isn't going as well as I had planned. We may have to rethink it.  Everyone in Pitssburgh is pissed off. No. Not pissed off., But really depressed. If you had told me that the woman who brought us room service had just found out her husband was cheating on her with the family dog I'd believe you. She was SO depressed. She was depressed incarnate. I wanted to help her. But I;'m just one man.  THE concierge was also depressed. He just sat there looking sad. The front desk people were sad. I think people are just sad that they live in pittsbiurgh. But.. that doesn't seem so bad. But perhaps it is I wouldn't know.  Thats all for now. Tommorow either St louis or tennesee depending on weather conditions, In the meantime have fun. I have siome strawberry ice cream tonight. it was... fun..  and what does god want with a starship?

      IT'S MOVIE TIME  There's a video store nearby my family's vacation home called "It's Movie Time". I imagine a black gay man saying it every time I see it or think of the words.  But, alas, it is MOVIE TIME, and it hasn't been for quite a while. We always had a saying aboout how each one of the movies was significantly improved over the last one. Well, this time that formula might put us into pretty good company. The most important thing to remember when making an independent project is to check your spelling and dot your i's. Also mind your p's and q's.   Audtions are right around the korner and they are always a strange experience. I always feel bad. I wish I could give all the people parts, and then make the world a stage. Then buy the world a coke. Then get a video camera and give a bum a plain cake doughnut to make him fight another bum and we'll call it bumfights. It'll be grand.  Movies are hard to make, but mark my words, if we achieve what we have set out to achieve we will have done something quite special. Most people would read our script and think you'd need milllions of dollars and hence major studio backing to do it. If we can do it, and not lose too much in quality, we will have done something very special. It'll be the pinnacle of a good 5 years now primarily devoted to guerilla style filmmaking. So- beyond just pulling it off the key will be to pull it off well and try not to sacrifice when it comes to substance. I'm happ to roll the dice, and in a few yers from now I may still be hacking away at this thing, trying to finish it, trying to get a few more dollars, or to get the whole thing assembled and done with. It won't be easy. But I imagine it will be fun. I know what I'm getting into this time. And I'm very excited.

      J-LO  I'll tell ya a quicky, then I'm off.   I was going to Disney Land with my Dad. BUt first we had to walk around this giant new hotel they were building next to disney land. We got to this place that was fenced off and my Dad tried to get in. There was a big scary dog barking and there was Barbed wire. He grabnbed the barbed wire as though he could remove it. I guided him away. he was confused.  I watched a movie Starring Toshiro Mifune as a wandering Samurai. He also played an Emperor who happened to look a lot like the wandering samurai. THe Samurai knew he bore an uncanny resemblence to the Emperor so he travled to the Emperor's palace where they met in sword fight with a batleh. The sword fight lasted many months and was most glorious. Eventually the Wandering Samurai took a steel umbrella and put it in a clay tube then stabbed the Emperor with it and opened the umbrella once it was inside the emperor. He shattered. Like the Rolling stones song.  Then the Wandering Samurai was chased out of the palace by the guads and he took to the sky in a bi-plane. This is when I joined him. We flew across the state of california, larking and plunging across the meadows. We flew over disneyland circa 1960. Then we flew so high we flew into the future. And in the future we flew past a house and a drive way. But quickly we realized this was not the future, but the future according to the 1980's. Still, said the samurai, it was a future, and we should appreciate it regardless of it's connection to the 1980's.  I was at the gym with my trainer and I went to the bathroom. Which turned out to be a bedroom. Jennifero Lopez was there and we had sex. I felt uncomfortable with it though because I wasn't sure if she had any veneral diseases or not. I tried to postpone the sex as much as possible. Then she turned into Madonna. This frustrated me and finally I escaped her only to find that she was in fact my Trainer's wife and he would kill me. I hid in the shower.  See you in New York.  -Danit Ross

It's for a girl...(guitar starts slowly).. for a girl.. who's got a world o' troubles...  EVA FOR EH-VA  What can you say of girl like eeeeevvvaaaaaaaa? Did you see her, old pal, on St. Patricks day?  Guitar solo.  What can you think of a girl like EEEEEEEEEVVVVVAAAAAAA?! Only that she had too much to drink(before she turned 20)  Drum solo  Oh the future is dim  for a girl like eva, pour her a drink, salt her a rim,  (chorus) BUT IT DOESN'T MATER CAUSE EVA'S IN AA!! NO IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER CAUSE EVA'S IN AA!!! THATS RIGHT!!!  UH HUH!! OH YEAH!!! EVA'S IN AA!!!!!! YEAH YEAH!!!!  We are the people of the future, or so you would think, but Eva is the people who really don't care. Oh eva, Oh eva, pour us a drink Then call up old rikki, and go bleach your hair.

      MAXWELL  Ever listened to Abbey Road all the way though, no stops, no interuptions etc. etc.? Well you should. It is, in my opinion, the best beatles albumn. I only believed this once I heard it astraight thru. It's kinda like one song, repeating themes, and choruss throughout. It's great.  AND I also have to say that it might be my faorite albumn of all time-- my vote for best of all time. I am a big fan of the rolling stones-- but the beatles have always been my number one band of all time. it's just not okay to say the beatles are your favorite band. You need tyo have something else that isn't so great to be your favorite, and then you go ahead and list the beatles as 'the best'. THats how I feel about it.  Look, there are a lot of 'best' movies out there. BUt I don't think much of the people who pick them as their favorite. Like "Citizen Kane". Or "Battleship Potemkin" or "The Bicycle Theif". You can't say those, maybe you can say the bicycle theif. But you can't say Kane because we all know KAn is great- revolutionary- unbelieveable- etc. So don't say it. Pikc something thats you- for your favorite. That you know is falwed and you know isn't perfect and you know not everybody else is totally in love with it. MAYBE the stones are too mainstream for a favorite by this rationale.  But they aren't like the beatles. Their like, right under them. Way under them really, but you know what I'm tryin' ta say.  I try to think of, for my favorite, very imperfect movies that moved me. Like my favorite Kurosawa movie. Most would say Rashomon or Seven Sammys. Well, I think both are incredible. And as much as I love the 7 sams, I can't say it's my favorite of his. Even if, in some ways, it is. Because it's known- it's very established. I'd like to pick a movie of his thats a little less seen, a litttle less attention is given to, buit is still deserving of best titles, and really really hit me hard. etc. etc. And thus I say, "High and Low".  When I think of John Ford movies I shy away from 'man who shot liberty valance' and 'the seachers' even though I dearly love and admire them both. I might say Stagecoach, or The Quiet man. SImply because their less highly touted- though still highly touted, and their not 'a given'. So if somebody asks me my favorite ________, I try to say, "Well, ______ is the BEST- in my opinion" "But my favorite- the one that touched me that is special TO ME and not really the BEST per se, well that'd be ___________"  Sure, The searchers toouched me a lot more than stagecoach. But... everyone says the searches, it doesn't need my vote, and there are othes that are just as special in different ways.  It's all about Beans my friuends. Eat them a plenty.

      IN THE JUNGLE BABY   We hae been shooting our jungle scene in my parents backyard. Wednesday I trucked, along with karen, a ton of shit from Orachard supply hardware to the backyard. We created our jungle, and it looked pretty good. We weere most concerned that it wouldn't look right, and it did. Then the mag jammed and we had to cancel our shoot. Acrtors all ready to go, set in place.  Thursday we had a new mag, and we perfected the jungle. Including the addition of a barrell Ryan bought online for 40 dollars. The barrel was a huge point of contention. For one, it ha to be picked up at my apartment in hollywood. 2, it was broken and needed to be reassembled. And four nobody seemed to understand why we needed to spend all this time on the barrell. Nobody but me and ryan. But mostly ryan. Being that I'm the director, I'm given to appealing to the needs of others. And the many were ready to get going and fuck the barrell. But ryan wanted it, and I made it possible for ryan to get it and defended it by saying, "One barrell may be meaningless, but if you let 5 or 6 barrells go then you ruin your movie" In making moves it is important to sweat the small stuff.  This is one of the few things I have learned of which I am certain about movies. Because they small things add up to make a movie, a barrell here, a barrell there... thats what makes the difference. A glitch in the sound track, and frame with a scratch on it. It'll ruin everything. Any straw will brealk this camel's back. You cannot allow for imperfections. And we are lucky to have a bunch of very vocal perfectionists on crew, and even luckier to have an obsessive compulsive director.  But in the end we didn't shooto thrusday either. Neighboirs had a huge party. Neighboring teens. Terrrible sound. I even confronted the drunk neighbor mother. She was pissed off. But I did my best.  Cancelled the other shoot, shot alll MOS. Last night, frioday, we finally go to it, and covered the two days worth of shooting leaving us one day behind. I kept them until 5. Their nerves were frayed- they were having a hard time.  Gotta go for call. More later

      THE LITTLE THINGS  When you try to make films, and I imagine this is much the same with poems, paintings, novels, or even brochures, you try to capture a moment, essentially, of undiluted reality and convey it to others to let them experience somethingmaybe you experienced, or to remind them of the universal experience we all share.  Today, when hunting for jewlery for the Hank Masters character as playe by Richard Gleason, Richard and I had some experiences. The best was watching the married richard try to convine a young armenina slaes girl in the jewlery department of macys that he was an expert on Eygyptian mythology. That was a moment I captured. But then later in the day, with bret, the sound man, howling about elcetrical noises in the walls, and Graham the Dp trying to frame up a shot tighter than I wanted it, and Ryan building a box that could fit the lovely kelly mcpheters in so she could beak out and suprise everyone in the jungle campsite scene, I tried to cpature different moments. Moments from movies, or tv shows, moments from media, momnets real from one side and artificial from another. But moments were captured.   Another moment I saw was Peter Scheer, beloved roomate, climbing into the fountain in the park at park la Brea. I watchewd him tumble, half naked, COMPLETELY drunk into the bottom of the fountain and emergh, in only his boxer briefs, with a blood soaked arm, walking in a jagged line. It was something to behold. I watched Peter K patch up his wounds, and I watched as then mr. sheer tried desparately to put a drawrer he knocked onto the floor back into the dresser, but he was tring to put it in sideways, all the while screaming, 'Why doesn't this fit i the wall" band-aids on every surface of his right hand, and blood dripping donw his elbow.  It was a moment. So was last night with Kim when I pulled her into her shower and made out with her, only to see her pull away, and futher confuse my already confused mind. This was real. Getting a good shot of Randy Ross as Frank Austin on his couch was not real. But it becomes real eventually if we do our jobs, and it becomes a mold thru which other expereinces will be viewed and understood. Twice removed as they may be, they are experiences and they are universal.  The edit, or the cut in film is a powerful thing. And we cut in our eyes, we cut in our minds, and we constantly jockey for final edit with variopus parts of our psyche. "This is the version where I failed" , and "This is the re-edit where I suceeded" eitherway it is true, and eitherway it is false. What remains consistent is something ineffable and beyond our language of understanding. But the best part is that we try to communicate something and we somehow, get something across. Just because we understand that our symbols and sounds are essentially arbitrary, we also must understand that they frequently hold a kind of meaning we can't help but agree on. from time to time...   For the two women who will have their day and soon make me a one lonely man.

      MUTINY  One of the things one just assumes when one is directing a movie, as far as I know, is that everyone around you on the set thinks your a complete idiot. Sure, if you're speilberg or Scorsese they all think you are a genius, but I'm not quite either of those guys yet(and I stress the yet) So on MY movie set I am considered to be an idiot by the people I work with.  Idiot is a harsh word. I'll try to illustrate the principle in more detail through examples. On this level everyone thinks they could be doing the directors job better than he is, and more than that not everybody involved really knows what the directors job is. My job as the director of this film is to make sure it turns out goood. If it doesn't turn out good, it's my fault. The director is responsible, in my eyes for seeing that the movie is the sum of it's part, and to make sure the parts are good, AND if he really wants to do something good then he also has to make sure it's more than the sum of it's part. That part is a sorta magic trick.   But it's everything from making sure that things cut together right to making sure you have enough c-stands to making sure that the key grip gets lunch even if he doesn't tell you he's hungry. Making sure everyone is happy is key- it's more than key- it's critical, it's huge, it's very fucking important. And, as I alreadty explaining, everybody is pretty much sure I'm crazy, mad, selfish, slef invovled, obsessed, and destructive.   My personal life has blended with the film ina  manner that is both highly unprofefssional and given the specific circumstances, morally questionable. This hasn't helped me. I really shot myself in the foot, and while at tiomes I still limp a bit, for the most part I've tried to run through the pain and pretend there is no bullet lodged in my foot, or just pretend that it's helping me be more motivated to run harder.   The other night things started to turn inwards on me. My lead, who has often seemed half in and half out of the project, told me he was very upset with me for asking him not to get involved with the female lead, and then going ahead and getting involved with her myself. This guy is also my roomate/best friend. Bad twaysh as they say. More than that, my brother worries fro my sanity and thinks the brain pills I'm taking might be the cause of my 'mania'. Everyone is angry that I made them stand on top of a mountain that was crumbling beneath their feet while I got the shots I needed. The DP has bruises all over his body from holding our arribl on his shoulder all weekend, and the oproducer I think, feels that I have stepped on his toes a bit.   Somehow I quelled the resistance by trying to ask everyone to ddetach my personal life from the movie, by trying to explain to them where I was coming from, and asking them to please stay on board, not just for me and "my movie"(which it isn't- it's all of our movies, the sound guy, the make-up girl, the leads, the extras, the bit players, the AD's, etc. etc.) we don't get money for this. our reward is doing good work. Having a good time and having something of quality to show for it. Thats all I can offer these people for their hearts and souls. Their bodies and minds. And so whenever I stand in the shower, hot water blasting the sweat off my body, and I think of which close-ups I didn't get, I just pound the wall: how could I fuck that up. How could I forget something. How come I made that mistake. Why didn't I stansd firmer ion getting that shot.  When I look at a piece of make-up and think it looks wrong or amateurish something inside me breaks. When I look at a set and think 'This ain't a jungle. It's a fucking backyard" something inside me screams. we don't have the advantage of knowing our movie will be weaqtchable because we have the things at our desposal to make it that way. We have to first make sure we can get the bear minimun of watchable covered, and on top of that we have to make it good- not good greatp- fucking amazing. And we will. And for some reason they all still sorta kinda believe in me. I have to show them proof. Maybe some dailies cut together....   more later....

      A GOOD DAY    Today shooting was canceled entirely. But I'll start from last night. Last night I was to rehearse and check out costume potentials for our leading actress. When I arrived she was drunk, and it was hard to get her to focus on the costumes, let alone the script. Though she did recite lines from the script in her drunken state which was a turn on.  Then the DP invited me out with him and his girlfriend(our first AD these days) and we went to meet them. Along the way the lead actress had a personal crsis with a recently made ex-boyfriend and a message he left her. She only got drunker. She ran off at many points, but I tried to keep my eye on her.  When I arose this morning it was 9:00ish. I showered fast, got ready to go, and realized I had left my atm card at the bar last night. I pout together sta quarters and bought some coffee. Flash forward many hours and we are finally ready to shoot. We walk to the coffee cart section of my housing community only to set up there and be told we were not allowed to shoot there. Three hours left in the schedualed day. I go to the administration office where I try to speak with crhis. Chris is out to lunch. So I try to speak with Tim. Tim finally comes out and tells me to talk to barbara over at the leasing offfice. Barbara is busy, but she tells me who I( really wan is monica bnack at the administration office. Back at the administration office Monica is still at lunch. Nobdoy can cover for her, and it turns out she's chris's personal assistant. So I leave. I go back to location--  Wait- did I mention that on my way back to hollywood from Burbank with our Sound director I got into a car accident with an old lady? She was turning into the streeet- into my lane, and didn't stop for me, I swerved, but coouldn't avoid giving my convertible a nice new racingi stripe complete with dent and scratched off paint.  Anyway, back to the loction. I get back and see my crew and cast ahnging around waiting. I take the DP aside and we start talking about options. What are the options? We decided maybe wee'll go guerilla style and hide the camera- kind of like a paparazzi thing- but we also are thinking of calling the whole thing offf. I settle to call it off. We call it off, and before we can put away our stuff, a little girl trips and falls nearby our sound equipment. Some people say she tripped pon the equipment, some don't. I don't know. A huge argument ensues between the girls mother and our sound director. Half of it in korean, half in cursing. The girl seems okay, but she's definitely upset. The mom is furious. She wants blood. I try to calm down the sound guy, Bret, and I talk to the mother with karen, the ad. We do our best to no avail. She wants to know our company etc. etc. SHe wants to sue me, basically. She calls her husband, her husband arrives and takes down my number, I trry to tell him the stuff wasn't blocking a pathway, but he doesn't care. He wants my number. He wants blood too. They leave. I call the guy later, and he insistis that the girl tripped on the sound equipment. But he can't decide if he's gonna sue yet or not.  We pakced it all up and went on our way. Good news is, kelly seems to have recovered entirely from her drinking the previous night, but she always does bounce back quickly. Everyone was worried most about me. trying to convince me nothing bad would happen and it would be okay. Everyone could see that it had been a rough day, and they could see in my eye that paniced deep set concern- the very tight worries of my inner workings, that were tied into a knot. THy could tell and they wanted o convince me it was nothing so I wouldn't lose it completely. IU am always teetering on that edge.   I call Ryan and let him know. His responsese were as follows:  "yeah."  "yeah."  "yeah."  "What did Bret say?"  "yeah."  "what do you want me to do."  "Okay. Sounds pretty stupid to me."  And very little more than that. Later the insurance woman confirmed for me that liability coverage would take care of this. So in the end we lost a full day of shooting. Now I plan to watch Throne of Blood, or finish City Lights, then do some storyboarding, visist my shrink who I have not seen in far too long, then pass the fuck out. And wake up at 6:00am tommorow to go pick up a uhaul to get our set stuff to the valley in time for our shoot there.

      So Far...   I just have decided to make this a place where I can record thoughts/moments and things alon the way of making "The Search for the Golden Bird". It has been something of a challenge, and yet also a joy to make the movie thus far. We have already, in our two endsless weeks... no... it's just been one week really... we shot stuff on a mountain top, we sweat in an office(we sweat on the mountain too). I'm even sweating now. I have sweat a lot. So far Blood and sweat have both be a big part of the movie makking process. No tears, but I punched some walls, which is about as close as I get to tears. There have been some serieous personal life catastrophes for me since we began. The ending of a 4 year retlationship, the nbeginning of an 'entanglement' with the lead actress, which in turn has alienated much of the cast and my faily/friends to some degree.  I have also had good days and bad with the shoot. Some days were very disapoitning, to find that my boards and my plans wouldn't work and that we'd have to find other ways to do things. making up on the spot entire sequences. You see, with the kind of budget we have, you ccan't waste film. We want to use every shot we expose. And this means not tooo many takes for the actors to get things right. So there is a lot of compromise. But I'm trying not to comprpmise too much. But at the same time I feel about one shot in five is exactly what I want. So now the challenge is picking which shots to get absolutley the way I want them./ Both big film shoots have been laden with problems, but also I have found myself so happy with them at times. Climbing down the mountain carrying the camera, or the tripod, sweating, bleeding-- whatever- it is fun. It is grueling, but it is fun. Especially in those moments where everything miraculously falls together perfect. And believe it or not, that has happened.  Ryan and Graham have been pulling the most wieght aside from me. Ryan more than graha, but for a DP Graham has done quite a bit of work. Turk, the Ad sent to us straiught from heabven, hasn't missed a beat. he worke, literally, until his legs cramped up and he could no longer move. When our one dry erase marker dried up atop the mountain, I said, 'Thats it, we can't shoot if we can't remark the slate'- two minutes later Turk messed with the marker and got another slate or two out of it. He also almost sailed down the mountain, hanging onto only the 4 by 4 flag. Which has been punctured, so in addition to getting equipment, film, actors, crew, planning, and shooting this week, I also have to get two giant flags reparied. The flags only fit in a car I can't drive because I'm no insured on it9long story).  Point is- my mind and my soul are both completely scattered. And yet, they are very focused. Every moment is geared towards the movie. Or it should be. When I go to long without making a phone call or scribbling down a note, or a plan, I start to feel lazy. I hardly sleep, and my smoking has really become absurd. Packs and packs of Marlboro reds getting sucked fdown into my lungs. Hardly been to the gym, eating when possible, and drinking sometimes to shut up my mind and just pass out. Only to wake up always too late, and run out the dooor and back into the fray.  Locations are never secured, actors always have schedualing problems, crew people always cancel at the last minute. And it's always hard to get what we want. At the same time, everything has come out right so far- of course the film has ye to be developed. So for all I know everything is garbage., under exposed, overexposed, or just looks like shit. Maybe it's all great but won't cut together. WHo knows.  And at the same time I am dreading this being over. It gives my life meaning and it's all I want to do. Regardless of the discomfort it may require. I just hope we can keep weathering this storm and get this thing done. It's fun, and it's hard and so far, we're doing okay... Or so it would seem...

      QUITE SOMETIME  Welcome dear reader, to the longest two weeks of my life. The longest, and perhaps the strangest. What can I say? I'll say litttle more than that a best friend of mine told me today, and I'm paraphrasing- but here it goes, that I was single-mindedly obsessing over an ill fated ill concieved movie that had me in way over my head, which I could only afford to make because I was essentialy spoiled,and incredibly selfish.   This is the classsic form of kicking a man when he is down. I haven't ever been kicked when I was down before. It was really something. But I didn't get mad. I got a little upset about it. It was interesting to hear about yourself from the outside to such a degree of detail. I'm not mad at the friend. Thats just the kind of guy he is. We don't get to choose things like who our best friends are. Somet9imes they're just complete assholes. Everybody is an asshole sometimes. Even me.   So as this, first day of shooting, passes and we do nothing but try desparately to lock things down for the shoot this weekend, I think only that I should just try to focus and have a good time. Do my job and have some fun. It's just an experience. I very well may be single minded, spoiled, foolish, crazy, selfish, and self destructive- my brother told me a few days ago that I was on a quest to destroy everythiung good about my life. But regardless of if these things are true about me, I am doing what I wanted to try and do.   I wory because sometimes things like this get me riled up enough to go above and beyond. But right now it's just making me tired. Will I rise to the occaision, or keep on struggling and failing to get things doe the way I dreamed they might be done. regadlress, I'm going to stick it out just to see, and I ain't goin down like a punk.

      THINGS MORE IMPORTANT THAN LOOKS  At the ripe old age of 23 I think I may have begun to learn, or begun to learn how to learn that there are things more important than looks. By looks I mean surfaces, and surface appeal. It is the kind of thing I have know, or understood when people talked about knowing it- but I have never known it to be true for myself- and now I think I'm about done with reading the experiential preface of the instruction manual describing how this phenomenon works.  Last night I had dinner with friends, among them a woman who has a high ranking job in a major studio. I did not know what she did at the time of the dinner- only learned later- but I knew she was involved with movie making. We talked about how she got started- she asked me about my movie- I tried my best to give the pitch. She said it sounded incredibly ambitious, and interesting. I guess that's a start. Regardless, I wasn't too concerned with the pitch, or what she could do for me or the movie. One must learn to take these things with the tiniest grain of salt. What I did gather from the experience was that many of the things I have believed to be true, but only based on instict, and impression, were in fact the case.   She confirmed for me, firstly, that the times when she worked for nothing, and was penniless, were the best times. The most fun, the most exciting, and the most pure. I always intimated such a thing about these times for myself- but it's hard to see it as true when you're trying to get the drunk sound guy his ADR, the demanding star his veggie sandwich, your roomates a new fuse replacing the one you blew, and the stunt guy a location for the next shot. These are moments of complete overload. You are one person, and you must do the jobs of many. But I always knew this was the good stufff and these were one day gonna be the good times.   She also confirmed for me that it was all about starting out with passion for it, and starting out with quality work, so as not to kill a career with work on Agent Cody Banks 2 before you even get your career going. Would I love to be offered Agent Cody Banks 2? Fuck yeah. But I'd turn it down. I am very fortunate to be able to. So in this sense, among others, it's the love of the thing, not the thing itself, and it's quality, or it's pay check, or it's promised fame and attention, but the love itself you must strive for.  Ahh, therein lies the moral of this twisted tale of filmmaking we are trying to spin. Yesterday we shot the most takes of any one shot we have done. 13 takes. 13 takes of brother Alex as older Glenn Kahan reflecting on the meaning of his very famous trilogy of adventure films. I shut my eyes each time I called action and tried to impart to him the way to do it. I tried to talk to him about it in every way I knew- to try and tell him not the effect I wanted, but the way to get thee. i tried experiences I knew he had. I tried stories about my experience. I tried references to other media- interviews etc. I tried changing inflections on certain words, or taking certain pauses. It didn't ever quite hit every note in one take. Each take had ups and downs. It wasn't ever perfect though.  I even tried to use the force a few times. I shut my eyes and focused on the way the words should come out- the feelings he would have- the thoughts he would have while he said each word- etc. etc. It did work sometimes, but then sometimes it didn't. Suppose I need more jedi training. At one point I stopped and realized, here I was sitting on this floor, running through my mind memories of the methods of great directors I read about- Kazan, Huston, Speilberg, Ford... the list goes on of those I've obsessed over, the notes I've taken. But none of it was working out just right. Was it Alex? No. Alex was great. Was it me? Maybe. I did my best. Regardless, I had a thought on top of all these others in this moment- I thought 'wow. This is it. This is what it's all about. And this is fun'.   And the following thought was the hieght of coincidence(not irony graham) that there we were shooting the scene where Kahan literally says the the audience, "Watch the movies again, maybe they didn't find the bird- but you'll have fun watching them try- and then maybe you'll agree with me" and I learned that very thing- I saw myself experience it. Fascinating. As my trainer would say, it was movies about movies in the movies for the movies making movies. And it goes on.  So why the whole thing about love and appearances? There are many things in life that deal with this issue. To claim i really know, or am ready to act on being a process over product kind of guy would be absurd. It's hard not to care about making money. And one shouldn't. We need money. It's hard not to care about sucess- social, romantic, relational etc. etc. But sometimes perhaps we can glimpse the bigger truth beyond ourselves and our ends and our goals. We can just see that it was all about the doing, and it wasn't about the prize we won or lost. It was an honor just to be nominated. And before that, I suppose, it should be an honor just to get the chance to try.

      MOVIES ABOUT MOVIE WITH MOVIES ABOUT MOVIES  I alwaysd cop out when people ask me what my film is about.  "It's about film"  Thats the best way for me to answer the question.  I could say, 'It's about doing what you love... It's about how life is different from and similar to fantasy- or about how fact and fiction become intertwined, or how media changes the nature of things and information and truth. I could write aq few papers on it. I could make another movie about it.  My trainer(yes, I have a trainer, laugh, groan, smirk, vomit, or whatever you feel is best to do- I am terribly spoiled but I always did gag on that silver spoon)  My trainer aslked me what my movie was about while I was mid crunch and I said, 'Movies" he laughed, because he';d asked before. Imagine him, in his thick Czech accent "George makes movies about movies. What kind of movies do you make george, oh - movies about movies, and what are the movies about, hmovies. They are movies about movies about movies. Go to da movies, make the movies, movies and movies in movies about movies..." Now whatever I do, lunge, squat, press, lift, grunt, and sweat, he's got a chorus going of movies movies movies movies. And even though he knows nothing about the movie, he couldn't be more dead on as to the nature of the project.  And what more do you want from a guy who lives and loves movies? When I was young my father told me that too many filmmakers just only new about film and made their movies about that. I have become what he warned against, and nobody thinks very highly of it. But I have intellectualized it a bit further. Whether that comes across or not, here's how I see it.  It's all about medium and the transfer of information. And the movies are amazing because they alllow us to all experience universal thoughts and feelings- they indicate our true experience, and we mimic them, but do we mimic them, or do they mimic us, and what part of the mimicry is good, and what part is bad.   Plato said there could be no Homer, beautiful as his words were, because it lied to humanity and gave them flase dreams and aspirations to be things they could not be rather than focus on the nature of their lives- of the truth. Aristotle disagreed a great deal with his teacher, claiming that it is thru fiction that we reach a kind of catharsis- not just a release- but an opportunity to see things play out as they may if one was more like character X, or Y. They allow us to meditate on the ways of being human. To see ho w we want to be, or how we don't want to be. For example, on a ride home to a wife you may be annoyed with, you might here a bad country song about how a guy misses his dead wife and wishes he never lost his temper with her. This is cathartic for the listener- for now he may rethink his actions- he has seeen a scenario that played out his thoughts and feelings.  Fiction takes humanity for a test drive. Imitation and mimicry can be dangerous. Thus the struggle of my hero Calvin Doerner. Calvin mimics all the wrong things of the fiction he was a part of- he misses what it is to be a part of it- what it was the thing could truly impart to him- he missed the point, and to quote a great film "Billy, we blew it." an opportunity to leanr how to focus on experience and process rather than the ends and the riches, or the failures and the sucesses. The movies he did had that message. But all he got from them was how cool the costumes were, and how much ghe was obsessed with the lead actress. he saw the dougnut and not the hole, and he should have focused more on the hole. Or the whole, depending on how you want to see it.  In the nmeantime, production is on halt. I medidtate on the meanigns and long term goals of the project, and struggle to find a chinese restaurant, a dungeon, and a few diners. Soon I'm off to the gym again, and then to re-write the schedual with rpoducer Ryan Nagata. Last night we took a night off and did some Kareoke at a place called peppermint. What a time. Lots of singing. I did "My Way" and then "Always on my mind" among others. My vooice is god awful. Only Graham among us could sing well. We drank too much. The Kareoke room was odd. I picked a fight with some old shlub who was holding Kelly in a way I felt was inapropriate. kelly did her best all night to make me jealous and push my buttons. Which wasn't hard considering I had drank scotch whisky- which always has only the most awful agressive effects on me. Why is whisky like that? It just makes you want to punch somebody.  But today, when I finally arose nearing 2 o clock, I was reinvigorated. I needed time away from the film in my mind, and I needed to blow off some steam. To the tune of 90 dollarts, but we'll take it out of the budget... I wish... In reality it was a good night to let go, and now I';m ready to take on whatever comes up next. personal life wise, as well as professionally. There are so many more tales to tell of the making of the film. But it seems now we are poised to get back into it and keep up the good work.  Of course I am still terrified at the film development process. This could be a big hurdle, and I try to prepare my self for the possibility that everything comes out like shit. I just don't know how I'll cope. I know I will because I always have and I always do find a way- but it's gonna be a pretty big fucking blow. Of course my mind is already thorwing around some contingency plans... not happily, but you gotta be prepared. In the meantime I'll try to watch some movies I love, go out to a movie, a relax for the next two days. This is recharge time, and my only hope is that the film comes out well and the project gets a chance to be even a fraction of what I know it can be for people. Something fun, something insightful, and hopefully somethnig useful when it comes to approaching the fictions and fantasys we love. We shouldn' let them go, we just need to find a better way to relate to them. Star Wars isn't about ewok toys. Or opening weekends. It's about a timeless message that could let us all lead better lives. I hope to be able to illustrate something along those lines- it's about the message. the message in independant of the medium- and never to be captured by it. The medium is another message itself entirely- and at that no message at all.  A final quote. "The only kinda sucess is failure and failure ain't no kinda sucess at all." If only I could learn to believe this.

      MORGAN WIXSON THEATER   Eventually we finished our jungle shoot. It wasn't easy, and it wasn't always fun, and it certainly wasn't clean, but we finished in my parents backyard and moved on to other things. Like the long in waiting dungeon scene. The dungeon scene was to be shot in a theater called the morgan wixson theater. I had made arrangements to shoot there, met with the manager, and we had a deal. 12am to 4am.   Cut to last night, night one of shooting the dungeon scene. It's 11:00. T-1 to blast off time- Graham is loading the mag, Ryan is building some props, Garth house wants coffee, peter scheer forgot his shoes at my parents house, Ricvhard is rewriting the script, all in all the usual night of shooting. I'm in Ryans car speeding down the PCH with Peter K at my side. Where am I going? To get the barrell of course. We get to my parents house and lug the barrell through the dark alley's on the side of their house to Ryans car. we struggle to fit it into the trunk, and I hold onto the sucker for dear life as we drive back, hoping it doesn't fall apart again9as I mentiuoned before it's not easy to put back together again).  I get back to the house of the nagata's, people are roaming around, Graham needs gaffers tape, Peter went with garth to get coffee even though he has no shoes, Ryan is stiull building props, Richard has rewritten the entire script by now, and is already startimng to rewrite my next movie even though it has not been written yet- I think he wants a head start this time. Bret is still out with West Nile virus, and Kenneth Day is off somewhere in the wild of los angeles, only to re-emerge out of the shadows when he is beckoned forth. I high tail it over to the theater with Graham, all the equipment, Walter, and some coffee. We get there and park. Graham complains that I'm parking tooo far away. I pull into the side alley and park illeagally. Graham complains that it's still to far from the dooor.  We get out and walk to the door. We knock. Nothing. Knock again. Nothing. we search the sides of the building, we knock everywhere nothing. nothing nothing nothing nothing.  What you're thinking is true. There was nobody there. And there continued to be nobody there when I called and heard myself on the answering machine through the box office window as I left my sad sad message,  "HI, this is George Edelman... I rented this space for tonight.... and nobody's here..."  Well we waoited half an hour. Nobody showed up. So we truned it around to leave. But wait- Kenneth was on his way here by bike. In the dark. So I waited. Graham started whining. he wanted to leave. "lets go find kenneth, we'll drive around".  For some reason I have a strange sensitivity to whiners. They always get the best of me weven when I know better. So we left. paying full respect to Graham;s whimpers. We didn't find kenneth. I went back to the theater where I knew he would show up eventually and he was there. It took a while to erxplain to him why we were'nt shooitng. Why we had to call it off. Then we had to convince him not to break into the house.   Shit. I have to go now. Long story short I called the shoot. It was the best thing. and the schmuck who runs the theater has amanged to lie through his teeth to me via phone message and claims I never booked the space. It's fucking bullshit and he should pay for yesterdays rentals. Which I still hven't returned. And I will soon. Gotta go, knock on the door, movie to make...
