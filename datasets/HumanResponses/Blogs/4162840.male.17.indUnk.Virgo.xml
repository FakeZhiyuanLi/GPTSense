      Well, its been a little over a week since I last posted anything. Limited access to the Internet sucks. I just registered for my MPC classes today. I'm only taking twelve units because of a SNAFU with the counseling department has greatly restricted my eligibility for classes. Of course my waiting to sign up for any classes until the day before the cutoff for Fall semester registration had absolutely nothing to do with it. At least my schedule for this semester has some fun and easy classes. Other than college stuff, I haven't been doing much of anything eventful. I am going to do some writing on my old Underwood typewriter (my graduation present from my mom, it is absolutely the coolest writing instrument ever devised). I'll probably start upon a new short story. Should be fun. My 18th continues to close in. September 5th seems to be just around the corner. Well... that's about it for today. Almost forgot, the Giants have won five in a row and hold the lead in the NL wild card race.

      Damn Giants blew another game, this time reaching majestic new heights in futility by stranding over 10 baserunners. At least they lost to a guy of Greg Maddux's caliber.

      Giants actually won today. Schmidt picked up the win (14-4) and (I almost can't believe I'm writing this) the bullpen didn't implode in a shitstorm of Biblical porportions. J.T.'s red hot, smoked a three run dinger to crush any hope the Cubs might have had. Hermanson definitely going to make a good closer.  We should be moving into the new house soon (Glory Hallelluyah), almost definitely by my birthday. I'm actually going to have a real room!!!  I badly need to develop some semblance of a social life. I will surely lose what teetering facade of sanity I have now if the status quo remains.  Just burned a new CD. Has "Paint it Black", "Wanted Dead Or Alive", and "Smells Like Teen Spirit" on it and "Hotel California" is the closer. Should be a good one to listen to at night.  Plan on maybe getting some knuckleballing in tomorrow, happy-happy-joy-joy.  50 some-odd days until "The Dark Tower" is released. Am happy, but also sad. Roland and the rest of the ka-tet are the closest friends I have right now. God that's pathetic.  Would commit genocide in a small Third World country right now if it meant I would get a girlfriend. Given the previous "D.T." statement, prospects seem incredibly dim. Wish I had my Chris Isaak CD on me right now, "Kings Of The Highway" and "Wicked Game" make me feel less crushingly depressed. Don't know how listening to sad music while feeling sad helps the situation, but it does, somehow.
