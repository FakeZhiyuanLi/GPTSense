       We hope you like the web site. I'm sure you have a lot to say to the world. Here's your chance. This is your very own Blog (web log). You can tell the world, or just your friends, whatever you want. Maybe some day soon it will be a place for you to tell your fans what it's like on the set of the movie your starring in. Maybe you just want to talk about cats or how cute your niece is. It's up to you to use this how ever you see fit. Just remember we're watching.

       I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. I enjoyed the city of brotherly love with all the love I could muster. I miss the people, don't miss the city. Miss my friends, don't miss the city. Miss cute guys, don't miss the city. What's a girl to do? I know, I'll become rich and famous and transplant EVERYONE out here.  I knocked out a good portion of my script, and found the travel to be productive. I sat across from a man who gave the ebola virus to the whole plane with his coughing fits, but ebola kills slow, so I'll be here a bit longer. It was hot, it was humid, it was...moist. I trashed my hotel room like a rock-star, then cleaned it all up like the OCD virgo that I am.   I saw my best friend from college and my CRAZY family, whom I love, mind you, but are nuts in a special way. I had lunch with a great guy and cursed the fates. Does Meghan twitch and babble and shift in her chair when she's nervous? Yes, I believe she does. Venison? Veal? Turtles? Who shoots a turtle?! Kraig does.  But here I am, safe and sound, visiting my homeless cat. Mommy loves her Bear, but Bear is having separation issues.  And now, for something completely different...

       Howdy, all! It must scare you to know that I now have a medium to release my tedious knowledge into the world. But you can do nothing to stop me, so just sit-back, relax, enjoy the ride.  I am very grateful to my squidgy brother and sister (shmoop 1 and shmoop 2)for doing this for me. You have earned a prominant spot in the Oscar speech! Congrats. Lily doesn't need a spot, 'cause she's coming on stage with me to be the official "statue-holder". I know that such a position does not exist currently, but it shall as soon as I start the trend.  I just wanted everyone to know how much I appreciate your love and support in my race for the spotlight. I know that no matter what, you'll be there for me; but let's be real...you'd rather be "there for me" in the matching Ferrari's I intend to purchase for the family. Well, hold your horses, I'm getting there. Brad Pitt was on soap's before he was big, you know. Granted, Brad actually got to SPEAK on his soap, but all in good time, my pretties, all in good time.  And now for today's quote:  Dans les veritables amour, c'est lame qui enveloppe les corps.  In true love, it is the soul that envelopes the body.  Neitzche

       Sometimes I get so caught up in enjoying my life that I forget to do the things necessary to ensure the rest of my life will be enjoyable. I have a wavering motivation...an ever-present tendency to procrastination that my ambition is at war with. They are fighting it out in my body as we speak...I hope ambition wins. In fact, I promise ambition will win. There are very few things that we can know about ourselves for certain, but one thing I do know is that I will someday be able to look back on my life and my career and be proud of the decisions I've made and the paths I've gone down.   QUOTE OF THE DAY  When I was younger, so much younger than today, I never needed anybody to help me in any way. But now I'm all grown up and I'm not so self assured. Now I find, I've changed my mind and I've opened up the door. Help me if you can, I'm feeling down. And I do appreciate you being 'round. Help me get my feet back on the ground...won't you please, please help me.  -Lennon/McCartney

       I never had a brother growing up, can't say I ever really wanted one. But I acquired one through the help of my sister, and I can now honestly say that I don't mind having him around one bit. He's pretty funny (looking) and never fails to make me laugh. In fact, it was this quality in him that made me realize how wonderful his and Marisa's marriage would be. Let's go back to April 15th, 2000, the day Brooks married my sister and I got a brother.  Marisa was pretty calm that day, relatively speaking, and was awash in beauty, as she always is. I was tickled pink to be there, watching my big sister put on her wedding dress and get the final touches on her hair and make-up. Her mom was there, trying bravely to hold it together so she wouldn't set Marisa off on the waterworks; many hours of make-up prep had gone in to this day, not to be ruined by feminine blubbering. Yeah, they held up pretty well, all was going fine, and then our dad had to go and say something sweet to her just before she was set to walk down the aisle (staircase), and then the tears came a flowing. It was an emotional moment, I know, because the minute I saw Marisa on dad's arm, descending the stairs in all her bridal glory, I lost it like a fat kid who dropped his ice cream cone. There she was, the sister I had idolized all my life, on one of the happiest days of her life, and she had the audacity to be crying when I was trying not to cry. Oh well...best laid plans. All seemed to be lost, the make-up running like a jack-rabbit, and no one thought she'd stop crying long enough to choke out the vows. But there was Brooks to save the day. Hoorah! Brooks took her from Dad, smiled at her and said something (I don't know what) that made her laugh, and the tears we're effectively plugged. I can just remember standing there in line with the other "maids" and thinking "Well there you go. There it is. Perfect." He made her laugh right before their wedding vows, he made her happy with a few choice words, and in that moment it was wonderfully evident that their marriage would be perfect. Granted, nothing is perfect and every marriage suffers the little "slings and arrows of outrageous fortune", but if it can all come down to that, that they make each other happy in the perfect moments, it's in that that the smooth marriage lies.  I want a marriage like theirs someday. I want to marry a man who will make me laugh at the perfect moments, just like the man my sister married. I am happy to know him every day, and honored to have a brother named after a girl. It's all right that he's funny looking and frankly couldn't beat me at a trivia game if his life depended on it...he make's up for it by being an outstanding father and the perfect mate for my sister. And believe me, I was fully prepared to be very tough on the whichever guy thought he was good enough for MY big sis.  I love you guys!

       Okay, I am reading a book called the Da Vinci Code, all about he hidden messages in artistic works about the true nature and location of the Holy Grail. I have to admit, it's kind of blowing my mind. It claims to be based primarily in fact, and has pretty sound evidence to back it up. I won't give away the big reveal, but when the true nature of the Holy Grail is revealed, that is, it is explained that the Holy Grail is not a cup at all, but something else entirely, something that we have known about forever but have seen in a completely false light, the implications are mind-boggling. I highly suggest reading this book to those who can wrap their minds around a mystery and open their thoughts to the possibilty that all we know of the past and the society around us is a lie. I am not even finished with the book yet, and already I am forced to view the world around me in a new light. Read on, my little ones.  OBSCURE FACT OF THE DAY  The Knights Templar, the guardiens of the Holy Grail, we're attacked and tortured for their secrets under the order of the Pope of the day. The Pope sent out the order that the attacks we're to take place simultaneously on a specific day, so that none could warn the others. This day fell on Friday the 13th, and it is why that day is now considered unlucky.

       Yes folks, it's true. Meghan is returning to school. I didn't feel like I got myself in enough debt the first time, so I am going back for another round. I am applying to FSU, Penn State, SDSU, Birmingham University, The Actors Studio, and, the piece de resistance, YALE. Send all your energy to the admissions office at Yale, and repeat this mantra: "You WILL admit Meghan. YOU WILL ADMIT MEGHAN!" All of your support will be greatly appreciated, as it always is.

       Someday, the male gender as a whole will finally come to understand the subtlety of what women want. We want to be surprised by your regard for us. We want men to stop us in the middle of a sentence with a toe-curling kiss, just to see the expression on our faces. We want rambling, nervous phone messages that sound like they took an hour to form, but that make us grin from ear to ear like a Chesire cat, simply from the knowledge that all the nervous fuss is being made over us. We want enthusiasm, life, and magic, and there is some small part of men that want it to. Shakespeare wasn't a woman, neither was Moliere, De Bussy, Gershwin, Stoppard....all men, all gloriously versed on the advantages of romantic thinking. Romance should be a game, a song, a laugh, a lark, and  a surprise around every bend. And no, it doesn't have to be elaborate and expensive. It's the simplicity of the thought that means the world, not all of the bells and whistles. (Okay, a little whistling is nice, but never a requirement).  Romance never has to die with the aging of a relationship. New day, new reason to find someone fascinating. Like a reality TV show, not so much watching because you think anything all that amazing is going to happen, but enamoured none the less of the sheer possibilities of what they might do next.  Make us laugh, make us sing, make us cry, make us want to be the best versions of ourselves.   QUOTE OF THE DAY  Love is not love which alters when alteration finds, nor bends with the remover to remove. Oh no, it is an e'r fixed mark, that looks on tempests and is not shaken.

       I feel sorry for every epic film that will attempt to be made in the next 10 years or so...they will all seem like Gigli compared to this flick. From the kick-ass Legolas oliphant take-down, to the triumphant resolution to the Aragorn/Arwyn romance, I fell in instant love with this movie. I wish I was kidding, but I blubbered like a fool for the last solid hour of the movie. It was all too much...the end of the journey, the destruction of evil, the destinies  fulfilled...brilliant. As the riders from Rohan lined-up at the apex of the battle to charge in without fear, where death was almost certain but hope was shining bright, the lump formed in my throat and didn't leave until Frodo sailed from the shores of middle-earth, finally at peace. I am aware that my thoughts are probably not making sense, but it makes sense to me in a stream of consciousness sort of way. I could write pages and paes expressing my love, but lets just suffice it t say...wunderbar, excellement, brilliant, majestic, life-changing, bar-raising joy.

       So imagine this...I call Brooks up and tell him I need his help to pull a prank on my friend/manager. It's a SLLLLOOWWW Sunday, and needless to say, I am looking for ways to speed the time along. Enter, Brooks. I get Brooks to call my restraunt as a disgruntled customer looking to get retribution for the "racial jokes" he overheard a waitress making as he "dined" last night. The look on Matt (friend/manager)'s face was absolutely priceless, with his head in his hands, trying to smooth over the "situation". Brooks let him stew in his anxiety for a little bit, playing his part wonderfully, and then, like a true thespian, he spilled the beans and bolted, told Matt he'd been punk'd, and that Meghan said "gotcha!". I had been watching this all from the other side of the bar, waiting for the big reveal, and when it came and Matt found my eyes to express his hatred from across the room, it was then I knew...it was a great Sunday. Good times, man...good times.  HERO OF THE DAY  Brooks Ayola

       Ah, the joys of the holidays. I just returned from Nor Dakoda...Oh Yah. I think I'm gonna barf. Anywho...it was lovely. Spent some relaxing quality time with the folks and the rest of the fam. It is so nice to not have to worry about who has to leave to go to the other dinner or who has to stress about which parent they are going to upset by not staying. Everyone in one spot for a week or so, spending time and hanging out. There could be no better way to spend a holiday. Okay, maybe it would be better in Hawaii...hint hint...but not by much. And as much as I make fun of it, Grand Forks is a really nice, quiet town. I couldn't live there, mind you, but it's a very Norman Rockwell type of town, with all the snow and the old houses. The people you meet are very "what you see is what you get" and you get the feeling the words "shmoozing" and "networking" just don't come in to play with them. Good times, people, good times.

       So I have looked back over some old entries and have come to the conclusion that I'm just a big chees-ball. (I realize that I just made a spelling mistake in the "chees-ball" part of the previous sentence, but as I read back over it, it kind of makes me think that I might just be writing "cheese-ball" in a French accent. Go ahead, try it. You'll realize it sounds much better that way, as I did.) All I do on this thing is yammer on about my comical love life and gush over my adorable niece ( and she is adorable, mind you ), and frankly, if I were you, I'd be sick of it by now! Well, you have my solemn vow that I will now attempt to shift the topics to a more philosophical and/or political nature. At least until this frightening election is over. Or maybe until March.   Tonight's Topic:  I think professional athletes should only get paid the big bucks as they win each game. Think how much more interesting sports would be if only the winners we're bringing home a paycheck? Talk about dedicated to their training. Though I suppose it might put a rise to inter-player and inter-team sabotage, but that can be combated. And if it can't, that's also kinda interesting, too.  D'OH OF THE DAY  Dude, I JUST realized that I have a bleepin' spell check on this bleepin' blog-poster. Dag-nabbit!

       My adorable Lily girl has finally moved from being a quadraped to a biped, and I couldn't be more amused by it. There is absolutely no difference between the way a baby walks and the way a drunk person walks. Freakin' hilarious. She is so proud of her new ability that she doesn't make it more than four or five steps before laughing like a fool and falling to the ground. She has also taken to putting a shirt over her face and attempting to walk around that way until she bumps into something and falls to the ground. Drunk/ baby, drunk/ baby. If there is a more precious girl in all the world, I have no desire to know of her existence, for I shall have to rub her out...and nobody wants that.

       My best friend, Tim, is the sweetest guy I have ever known. And by sweet, I mean, angelic, kind, thoughtful, sensitive, and amusing...all together; sweet. It wouldn't even occur to him to be deliberately unkind to someone, not for any reason, and that, in this day and age, is sadly scarce in the human being sense. he's my first love, and the guy I'll never lose, no matter the paths our hearts may take in different directions. Every man I will ever meet and maybe fall for will be measured against this guy, because now that I know that there is one of him out there, my logic tells me there has to be another. And therefore, I just couldn't settle for anything less than the kind of joy I feel when I'm around him. I'm not in love with Tim, but I'll love Tim for the rest of my life. Anywho, the reason I brought him up is because a recent anticdote we created is the perfect example of the ridiculous sense of humour the two of us share. Now, as a basis, we're talking two well educated young adults here. Two college graduates (him in MATHMATICS, myself in theatre...MATH people...his entire major was math!) both of an age where a more sophisticated humor should start coming into play. It does, for me, but for some reason, not around Tim. So we went to dinner while he waited for his girlfriend to finish work, and had ourselves a nice chat and laugh over some salads and TGI Friday's. The wait to get a table was a half hour, so we walked around and talked and sat in the lobby and chatted and while we were waiting, I saw inside the restaurant that someone was being humiliated by "The Birthday Song" serenade at their table, and it hit me right then that I hadn't played a public joke on my best friend in a couple of months, and he was overdue. So while we were waiting for our food, I "went to the bathroom" and then told the hostess that it was my friends birthday, and I wanted them to sing the song...and to make sure they embarassed my friend. It is, of course, NOT Tim's birthday. Now this bears some sort of twisted irony, because I used to work for Friday's, and I absoutely refused to sing the damn birthday song because I felt humiliated singing and clapping for some middle-aged dad that SO didn't want to be sung to.  But I digress. I waited patiently through the entire meal, made interesting smalltalk, and mentally twidlled my thumbs for the end to come. When the herd of servers finally descended with their balloons and free cookie thing, the look of first confusion, then realization, then hysterical laughter that went across Tim's face...classic. Whew. Still makes me laugh. I knew he'd think it was hilarious and commend me for thinking of it first, and he did. We'd do anything to make the other one laugh, and to stakes are getting higher.  The King's to me, Edmond.  LONG-OVERWAITED ANOUNCEMENT OF THE DAY  I finally found a freakin' place to live. Huzzah!

       I've oft heard the sentiment "One day at a time...", but up until yesterday, never really understood the importance of it. To me, it means, live for today, not for what might be in the future. One of my favorite concepts in philosophy is that of a priori knowledge...the idea that yes, at this moment, right now, 2 and 2 equal four, and the keys that I am striking are solid, and the room in which I sit is square, but I have no way of knowing that all of these "truths" will be so in the next moment of my life. They are truths only because up until this exact moment, they have continued to be so. But no one can say for certain that they will be tomorrow, because no one knows the future. We can only know and learn from the past, but the here after, tomorrow, the next day...completely unknown to us. And that is the concept that most excites me. Because it means nothing is set, nothing is certain, and nothing is decided...tomorrow can be whatever I make it, and that power falls under no one's jurisdiction but my own. All I can really know is the days I've lived, and I can either enjoy them or despair over them, but as far as tomorrow...well, I just can't say. I just don't know. I can't plan anything definite, and I can't worry over things that might never happen. It's rather illogical, really, to worry and stress and fret over days that haven't even dawned yet. My only power is in absorbing the days I've lived and applying that absorbed experience in to each coming one. What brought this revelation on? Wednesday was a good day. A very good day. And that's enough, for now.

       So, I have been sober for two and a half months now. Not that it was a big thing that I was drinking before, but to not drink in my circle of friends, is. Nobody gives me crap about it, it's just definately a different world to watch everyone else get trashed while I sip my fourth diet coke. I don't know why I decided to stop drinking, but it just seemed like a smart thing to do at the moment. A: can't afford it, B:tend to make stupid decisions while doing so, C: it's real easy to lose focus when your mind is sloshy. I guess those are my reasons. I don't know when I'll walk the vodka path again...if I ever will. It is ridiculously amusing to watch everyone else revert to toddler mentality. I also like being the one to recall everything that happened the night before so that I can lord the knowledge of their exploits the next day. "What happened, Meghan? No seriously, what did I say? No really, tell me. Seriously, Meghan, tell me what I said." Good times.

       So here are the new rules for Meghan's life. Well, not NEW rules, so much as old rules that I am finally going to allow myself to set in place. 1. I am going to spend as much time as possible loving and enjoying my family. I grew up feeling like an only child, and in that sense , I sometimes feel like I am alone to face my fears and worries. But I catch myself in the middle of the trip to my pity party and remind myself that I am most certainly not alone, and that even more suprising, I never really was. I have an amazing big sister that laughs with me and understands my follies and never judges. I have supportive and loving parents, a gloriously stuffy grandpa, a soft and sweet (yet deceptively cunning) grandma, a funny looking (smelling, sounding) brother-in-law, an angelic best friend, and a niece that, when she looks at me, I can see the world reflected in her sparkly blue eyes. Not alone, not even a little bit. 2. I deserve to be loved. I mean in a romantic sense. I have made the mistake in my past "relationships" of believing that the men that I became involved with were somehow doing me a favor by spending time with me. As if, somehow, it was a step down for them to want to be with me. I have been amazed and intimidated by the handsome guys that have flirted with and chased me and there was always some part of me that questioned the chasing, as if I wasn't good enough for them, and if I tread lightly enough, they wouldn't realize that. So in application, I have been meek in relationships, the complete opposite of my natural personality. I have held my tongue when I had an opinion, I have sat by the phone, stressing when it didn't ring, and I have put my life on hold or altered my plans to better suit the guys I have fancied. Well, no more. No more despairing every time I place too much importance on one person and that person doesn't live up the importance. No more examinations of everything I could have done different to make things work better, because, in reality, it probably had nothing to do with what I could have done. I mean, I am not perfect, not in the least, but neither are they, and as of today, I am going to stop believing they are. They are just flesh and blood, with their own set of neurosis, and I am not responsible for straightening them out. My first instinct in a relationship is to nurture and take care of them, making it my business to know what they want before they do. Again, no more. I deserve someone that wants to take care of me, for a change...better yet, someone that will be happiest when we are able to take care of each other. I deserve to be loved, by a man that will appreciate my beauty and intelligence and that won't be intimidated by my maturity and my wit. In truth, I am sniffling a bit as a write this from an unexpected rush of emotion. I don't think I have ever declared that I thought I was beautiful before, and that made me sad and happy. Sad that I have gone all this time without allowing any kind of pride in myself to extend to what I was always told by my peers was sub-standard. Every time a man has told me that he thinks me beautiful, I have blushed and thanked him, but never really believed him. And happy, because now I can finally take back some of the power in the courtship process. As attracted to them as I am, they are equally to me, and that puts me in a whole new bracket: Truly Confident Girl, formerly known as False Bravado but Secretly Still Internally Scared that Someone Will Point and Laugh and Call Me Fat Girl. I won't walk around cursing the kids that tormented me when I was a chubby little girl, and I won't hear their voices in my head when I look in the mirror, telling me that I am not good enough. Instead I will hear, "You're a beautiful girl, Meghan Catherine Marshall. Fat, thin, tall, short, old, young...you'll always be a beautiful girl." I am beautiful for myself, not for them. Not anymore. 3. I will live up to the dreams I have for myself. I believe it. I know I can get there, and I will. I look at my life as if I were looking back at it from fifty years in the future and I see all of the movie premiers and the in-depth interviews and the stage-runs and the awards and as dream-like as they may all seem, they are my reality. It's the life I was destined to live. No more sitting around waiting for my destiny to catch up with me like it was lying in wait around the next corner to spring on me as I strolled by. Onward and upward, of my own doing, by my own hand. I'll get there...just you wait.  Let me wrap this all up by thanking you for sticking with me through that whole diatribe. If you cared enough to read the whole thing, you are obviously someone that knows me enough that you already know these things about me. Good for you. And I love you for knowing them, and for not forcing me to see them; I had to get there myself.

       I listen to two types of talk radio. There's the Kevin and Bean/ Loveline type that offers interesting insight and information with a humorous slant and keeps me awake at the appropriate hours, and there is the right-wing conservative afternoon drive-time type that I don't liten to because I enjy it, but because I like to hear how the other half thinks. Now, I happen to enjoy talk radio because it passes the time when my music gets too familiar, and frankly, most of the music that plays in th radio is crap in a shiny wrapper. Anwho, that's not the point of this post, the point is this; on one of these right-wing shows, the hosts we're talking about how enraged they were over an article they read concerning an illegal immigrant family that had lived in our area for a number of years and had worked their way to citizenship and off of government support. They were incensed that this family had housed 43 people in one three room house because they were trying to take advantage of our job opportunities, and most importantly, our free education. These guys went on and on about the inbalance of the system and how dare the newspaper from which they got the story actually have a sympathetic view to the plight of this family. How dare they come here illegally, and then strain our tax dollars by forcing their offspring (American born off-srping) into our education system. When is this going to stop? All of this "not in my backyard" hogwash concerning the enrichment and development of the future generations of this world. When pressed, no one will say that they don't want children to have a fair chance in this world, no matter their heritage or social standing, but when it comes to actually being the ones to pay for it or develop it in their own communities, they balk at the cost and the effect it might have on their everyday lives. Goodness. The hypocrisy of it all frustrates me to no end. Yes, yes, help the children...assist the innocents that haven't a voice for themselves...oh, you mean, I might have to pay for it? Oh...umm...send them to another state, send them to another country...let them deal with it...we're suddenly too poor to help others.  What gives us the right to horde our superior education and social services, only to be doled out to the ones we find worthy of their benefits? I was born on this piece of land, so I have the right to understand the world around me better? My skin is this color, so I am entitled to more thourough health care, should I get sick? When are we going to start thinking like a species and less like a citizen of a privilged society? At what point can we stop looking at children as an immigration problem?  Try this: think of a child that you love, one that makes your heart sing and can make you smile with a laugh or a gesture. Got that picture? Can you see their shiny eyes, full of wonder and promise? Good...now imagine some rich asshole looking that child in the eyes and informing them that not only are they NOT going to receive an enriching and fullfilling education, but should they get hurt or sick, NO ONE is going to help them. And why, that child might ask? Oh, well, you weren't born on the right peice of earth. Sorry. Tough luck. There are two-sides to every story. Two ways to look at every issue. Someday, our society is going to have to learn to take the blinders off and see the other side.

       I have become quite convinced that the world does in fact revolve around me. We are told since childhood that this is not the case, but I am now certain that it is. One day, I was asking my sister about baby CPR and how to handle infant choking, in case it might ever come up with my niece. And not four hours later, my baby niece started to choke on a piece of ice (an incident that I am not afraid  to say FREAKED ME OUT...I was ready to figure out the whole emergency trachiotomy-yeah, I probably didn't spell that right-thing and bust out my Doogie Hauser skills, but thankfully Marisa handled the situation) and I got a demonstration of how to handle the baby choking sitch. And for another freakish example, I have currently become enamored of the splendiferousness of Jack Black's band Tenacious D, and have recently been listening to their album non-stop, an album that is peppered with funny conversations between the band members. So then, Tuesday, I am at work, and randomly pick-up the ringing phone, and I guess someone had decided to splice together those conversations to make a funny thing to play as a crank-phone call. At first, I thought it might be Brooks, the man that introduced me to the D, but it then occured to me that not only does Brooks not know my work phone number, he doesn't know that I am at work. So all of this added together spells out quite clearly...the world revolves around me. And that's okay. Don't worry, I won't screw things up for everyone else...too much.  OVERLOOKED MOVIE OF THE DAY  Down With Love, starring Ewan McGregor and Rene Zellwegger. It's a sex-comedy filmed in the style of the Rock Hudson/Dorris Day flicks. It's super cute and super well-done. Oh, and by the way, in case you weren't aware before, Ewan is a STONE FOX. Yummy.

       So, I have no Valentine this year. S'okay. I am enjoying watching all the others in love. It's not so bad for me, I don't think, because I am not pining over any specific person or anything. It's just another day, similar to all the others, barring maybe the fact that people are wearing a bit more red than usual. But that kinda happens around Christmas, so in fact, no real distinction. It's just an excuse to tell someone you love that you love them. I guess I've never really had a Valentine. The two years I was with my ex-ex, he was a crappy Valentine, so I don't count it. But anywho, here's my list of people I love that I am sending love to on national Heart day. (and p.s., all these cynical pricks out there that chalk V-Day up to being nothing more than a greeting-card industry excuse...well, they may be right. But really, it's not as if they're promoting National Poke a Baby With a Spoon Day...it's a day about LOVE!! How bad can that really be?)   Okay, here goes.   I LOVE YOU...   dad, mom, sandi, marisa, brooks, lily, mimi, pop, andrea, tim, bear, tina, lori, erni, mike, maloneys, marshalls, tam, bob, michael owen, orlando (you will notice that Mr. Bloom's mention came at the end of the list...I love him, but I don't love him more than my cat).   And if I forgot anyone...I love you, too...but I think we should just be friends.   QUOTE OF THE DAY   "I shall sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!"

       First of all, Taye Diggs is yummy...with a spoon, man. And by the way, this Richard Gere guy...going places, I think. Very talented. Moving on. Today's topic:  In the news today was the trial of some old man that killed his wife, who had alzheimers and OCD. And I have to think...can you really blame the guy? Imagine the pain of living with someone that needs to obsessively wash their hands a certain number of times, and ends up standing at the sink ALL DAY, because she can't remember what number wash she was on. Pretty soon, that whole smother-someone-with-a-pillow-as-they-sleep idea starts to appeal.  SONNET OF THE DAY  Being your slave, what should I do but tend/ upon the hours and times of your desire?/ I have no precious time at all to spend/ Nor services to do till you require./ Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour/ Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you./ Nor think the bitterness of absence sour/ When you have bid your servent once again adieu;/ Nor dare I question with my jealous thought/ Where you may be or your affairs suppose/ But, like a sad slave sit and think naught/ Save where you are, how happy you make those./ So true a fool is love that in your will/ though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.

       Okay, I am obviously the only person on the planet that honestly believes that the whole Stupor Bowl half-time fiasco was really an accident. I am sure that some part of the costume was intended to rip off, but I don't think that full breast was the intention. The red lacy-thing under the leather thing was supposed to stay on, hence the need for the star pasty. Think about it...neither of these guys want this kind of publicity. Timberlake sure as hell doesn't need it, and while Janet may have been gone for awhile, she's still Janet freakin' Jackson...she's done all of her boob scandal with that Rolling Stones cover. Speaking of Jackson, she's a very smart business woman...there is a lot of scandal surrounding the family name, especially right now...do you really think that she would intentionally connect herself to another sex-scandal? Any PR rep would tell you that that was suicide...and it's all about PR, folks.  Mistakes happen, people, and it angers me that the world is so ready to jump to the wrong conclusions, rather than maybe trusting someone's word for once. This isn't even coming from some die-hard fan needing to defend and idol...I could care less whether the two of them ever sing another note...but could we, as a society, make a small effort to be a little less cynical? Just once? C'mon...it's not so tough.  JOKE OF THE DAY  Two peanuts were walking down the street...and one was assaulted.

       Okay, so I'm a little stressed right now. I carry all of my tension in my shoulders and neck, and when I am stressing on something, it all bunches up in that area and gives me sight-blinding headaches. But I have found the perfect cure...works every time. First, I get in my car and drive to my sisters house. Then, I get out of my car, enter the house, and pick-up my niece to give her a huge hug and a kiss. Then I do something to make her laugh hysterically, and poof, magic, no more headache. She's a wonder cure. If could bottle her up and market her, I wouldn't. She's mine, all mine!! Mooowahahaha. Anywho. Other than that, just trying to survive in the real world as a big girl. I thought I would be cute and ask a guy out that I met about a month ago. It didn't occur to me that he might have a girlfriend...mostly because of the way he flirts, but I guess I walked right in to that one. See, when I'm in a relationship, it doesn't even occur to me to flirt with other guys, but I realized long ago that men operate under a whole different set of guidelines. But that's not the point. The point is, I found  out that he is an interpreter for the deaf, because he's the only one in his family that's not deaf, and I was intruiged by that. My cousin is deaf, so the family sort of learned a bit of ASL so we could talk to him. We didn't learn much, and it was mostly our grandparents that studied it, but I digress. I had the wild idea to look some things up in my ASL book, and ask him out that way. He thought it was cute, but as I said before, girlfriend. Oh well. I think my main problem is that when it comes to romance, I live in a movie, soundtrack and everything, and in the back of my mind, I believe everyone else will react to my romantic gestures with a movie mentality, and that everything will work out fine, with a swell of the music and a dolly back with a fade to black. Am I wrong to want the fairytale? Will I look back on all of this frustration with hilarity at some distant, content section of my existance? Bleh. Who knows. All I can deal with is what I have today, what I know today. And today, I'm going to eat some chicken for dinner. Nummy.  MOVIE QUOTE OF THE DAY  Nick Arnstein: You've surprised me.

       Okay, here we go. I have a lot to talk about, so I am going to break things down in to sub categories. Let's rock.  CAMP- Ladies and gentlemen...this is the best movie about a musical theatre summer camp every made. Granted, this is not a popular category to make movies in, but whew, this is a good flick. It was my childhood, in a nut-shell...with all the people stereotypically there...whew...I can't say enough for how much I LOVED this movie. Anyone who has ever been young and freakishly talented, this is our movie. Flock to Blockbuster. Daniel Letterle...nice.  WHALE RIDER- I get it now...why they nominated a 13-year-old girl...I get it. She was amazing.  TIME AND SPACE- Okay, here's a mind-jumblie for you...Parva, the national Russian newspaper, reported recently that a scientific party doing research in the south pole recently made quite a discovery. Directly over the south pole, they found a huge, grey, swirling mass, something like a sand storm. They sent a weather balloon in to the mass, and it immediately disappeared. It was attatched to the ground, so they hauled it back down...and when they got it back, it was perfectly fine...with one noteable difference...the chronometer read the correct day and time, but the year read 1965. A portal in to the past? We'll see.   COKE TOWN- Got a few million? Got a corporation? Then you too can have your own city name to make you famous. That's right, kids...the city of Los Angeles is auctioning off the rights to RE-NAME LOS ANGELES to the highest corporate bidder. I really wish I was kidding on this, but I'm not. It's being told that this will help alleviate some of the financial pressure our fair city is under. So how about Lexusville...Mastercardtopia...Pepsi Corners? Great, right? Makes me proud to be a native Angelino.  Whew. That was...actually not all that much to talk about. I guess I compressed my thought better than I anticipated being capable of. Faboo.

       Okay, here's my thing. The academy seems to award on the basis of more than the individual performance...as in, many "Best" Oscars have gone to people that not necessarily deserved the award for the individual performance, but rather for their overlooked body of work leading up to it. Examples? I hate to say it, but Julia Roberts...believe me, I LOVE Julia Roberts, but Erin Brockowich was not the strongest performance of the year. But she's a strong actress and ridiculously talented, and I think the academy saw the juicy part as an excuse to give her the award he should have gotten for Steel Magnolias. Okay, so let's bring it all home to my point. Bill Murray. A more naturally funny man you will not find walking this earth, a man so ridiculously overlooked throughout his career, the academy should be ashamed. He makes people laugh, like no other. It's super hard to make people laugh, consistently. Can you do it? Without TELLING a joke, or using some slapstick device? NO. Comedy is worlds harder than drama. People are closer to tears these days than they are to laughter. Anywho, I'm off the point. The point is...Sean Penn is wonderfully talented and has himself been overlooked in the past...but in comparison with Bill? No contest. Ghostbusters, Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Caddyshack...good lord, the list is ridiculous. And this was their chance! This was a role for the ages...all encompasing Murrayness and subtle humour surrounded by a wonderful story of true love. I don't know. The world's amuck. Amuck! Je ne sais pas. Oh, but ballyhoo on LOTR. Good times, man. Right there, another example. I mean, the third was the best, but eleven awards was a hasty catch-up to repair the mistake of not awarding the past two. And hey, Viggo deserved a shot in there. Just for getting away with having a name like "Viggo" and still being DEAD SEXY.   GOAL TO BE REACHED BY MY 25 BIRTHDAY   I will learn to speak French...fluently. Oh yes, it will be mine.

       Dude, it's freakin' gorgeous in sunny California today. It's about 72 degrees, blue sky, not a cloud, slight breeze...paradise. I gripe about the traffic, and sometimes the people are a bit...looney, if you will...but, man, I love living here. When I was growing up, I took for granted how lucky I was to never have to walk to school in the snow (and rarely the rain, for that matter...wait, come to think of it, I didn't actually walk to school, but that's not the point). It's idyllic, lovely, amazing. I can understand why people have flocked here. Ultimately, I would like to live in my favorite city in the world, London, but until I can get there, I am happy to be here.   QUOTE OF THE DAY  "Love is merely a madness..."

       Imagine what a person from say, Ghana, would think if they were ushered through the halls of one of our Costco's. "Damn.", would probably be some of it. "What the..?", would be more. Mostly I imagine that they would be appalled by how much food we have at our disposal, at lot of which just gets THROWN AWAY when it's not purchased. Crazy.  Okay, further proof that the world REVOLVES around me. VHI aired a behind the scenes special on the Showtime program "Queer as Folk", a show I happen to LOVE. I think it's a really amazing look at how gay couples really interact. I have known many a gay man in my life (I went to a musical theatre school) and so often how they are portrayed on TV just doesn't ring true with me. But in this show and it's characters I recognize many of the men I've known, which makes it fun to watch. Nostalgic. Anywho, one of the characters, Brian, is the that super HOT gay guy with tons of male charm and charisma, the kind of guy that makes you wish he were straight. The cast of the show has been pretty closed-lipped about who is really gay and who is straight, and on this VHI special, they all revealed their preferences. No one really knew before if the actor that plays Brian, Gale Harold, was gay in real life or not. Well, he aint, and that upped his hot quotient a thousand percent. So I'm sitting there thinking, man...I could date that guy? Yummy. But in reality, I'd probably not meet the him, so it's a non-issue.  Yeah, so I'm at work TWO DAYS later, and guess who comes freakin' strolling in with his girlfriend? Yup. Thanks. Thank you to the gods of irony for poking me in the eye, once again. I never get star-struck (we get a lot of celebrities that come in to my work-place) but when he walked in I recognized him instantly, despite a full beard and stupid hat disguise, and I started giggling like a damn fool. I tackled the bartender on the way to his table and demanded he let me open their bottle of wine. He wasn't the warmest guy I've ever met, but he accepted the tiny praise I gave him about his show, and kind of clammed up after that. His chick was really nice, and she's all kind of normal looking, which makes it all the more maddening.   Fifty years ago, we sill had public division of the races, and that's all changed. Twenty years from now, it won't even be a story that there are gay characters on a TV show or that this guy married that guy, and a lot of that in-road has been started by shows like "Queer as Folk". All in good time, people. All in good time.  FAVORITE NEW SHOW THAT'S NOT NEW  I have become belatedly enamored of the show "The West Wing". I have been watching re-runs on Bravo, and I can't get over how smart and topical it is. I am on the border of obsession. I have yet to see a new episode because of freakin' American Idol, but it shall be mine.

       Okay, here's what vexes me about the whole time travel idea. There are shows and movies based around the idea that if one could travel through time, they could go back and fix things that may have gone wrong in the past. But I think this is an unbalanced notion. If the course of history can be changed by one simple action, then everything around it must change as well, in an almost paradoxical fashion. Say you want to save your friend from dying, and you go back in time to help them make some change that keeps them alive. You couldn't go back to your time and expect anything to be how you left it. Hell, you might not even be able to go back to your time. Say that when you saved your friend, they were suddenly around on a day that they weren't there before, and they go to the bank on a day they weren't there before, and bump in to someone accident's, and that puts that person in a bad mood, pushes them over the edge, and that persons mood escalates in to road rage, and they cut another driver off, and that driver gets so spooked that they exit the freeway one stop too early, and exiting too early means they don't have the gas to get home, so the tow-truck that comes gets an extra bit of business, and that extra bit puts the company owner right where he needs to be financially, so he decides he can send his son to the east coast college he's been dreaming about, and that son ends up distracting the girl that was supposed to become a brilliant scientist and in her hours of tedious lab time invent the basis of the very time machine which you used to change the course of things. But she never did, because you saved your friend, and changed everything. There are too many variables in this world to allow for any changes in time. It's a ripple effect, similar to throwing a pebble in a pond...ever expanding waves of change. Long point short, I don't believe time travel is a viable thing. Let alone the parameters of the actual travel, the physical presence of a being that on the original timeline wasn't there before implies that every move would cause a (80's moment) "rift in the space-time continuum". I think time travel and the notion of it was something the human mind invented to place some sort of belief in our heads that even though we make millions of decisions a day, good and bad, the result of those decisions can be fixed or changed at some later date, thereby alleviating the guilt over having made the decisions. Anywho, just a theory.  I have recently become enamored with The Darkness's song "I Believe in a Thing Called Love". I have no idea why. When I first heard it, I remember thinking..."What the???" and dismissing it. But now I hear it everywhere, at work, on TV, and now...I LOVE IT.  I prance about my sister's house singing it like a fool and making her laugh. My niece thinks it's pretty funny too, and she tries to sing it as well. Okay, so it's mostly just high-pitched squealing, but considering what she's trying to copy, it's a pretty good go.  ODD OBSESSION OF THE DAY  I find myself in love with The Rock. The Rock, you say? Surely not. Oh yes. I can smell what The Rock is cooking, and it smells good. I couldn't even begin to explain this current guilty pleasure...maybe it has something to do with him being a huge hunk of man meat, but that's not the only factor of my love. I guess I just enjoy a good Rock, and Dwayne, You are an excellent piece of Geology.

       Oh my, much to talk about. First of all, my Dad and stepmom are in town, which is a treat. I have a special relationship with my father, and like to think of him as one of my best friends. He lives in a far away state called North Dakota, so I only get to see him a couple of times a year. Having them in for the weekend rocks, though I couldn't get any time off of work, which does not rock. I would have had one of the days free, but I needed a specific night off earlier in the week to audition for an acting class that I didn't get in to because...ready for this?...because I am too invested in THEATRE. Y'know, theatre, that thing where acting began? Yeah, apparently that whole "idea" is a little scary to the film and t.v. actors out here, because they run screaming when it's mentioned. I don't mean to undermine LA actors or the work they do, but to claim to be studying an art form and then completely ignore or have no interest in the ROOT of that art form shows a lack of....something. I don't know what that "something" is, but to be lacking in it is surely a detriment. Anywho, enough about the silly class. Daddy's here, and I am trying to spend as much time with him as possible before he returns to the frozen tundra. Other than that, not much else to report. Oh, there is the whole "thinking of moving to Paris" thing, but that's still in the works. I really am seriously looking in to living in Europe for a year or so before I go to Grad school. I'd prefer London, but Paris would be nice too. I just figure that if I am ever going to do this (and I really want to do this) I am going to have to do it now. Got no man, got no kids...nothing to tie me here. I have never been so happy as when I lived there the summer of my sophomore year. England is my "happy place", and I could use a happy place right about now. The more I live in LA, the less impressed with it and it's culture I become. I mean, I love California, I love living here, but I think Europe suits me better. I spend too much of my time here looking at things or people and shaking my head in amazement that they can even manage to blink and breathe in and out without tripping over their feet as they walk. Sometimes you have to just take yourself out of your comfort zone and throw yourself in to things. I think this would be an amazing experience for me, and I don't want to spend my life regretting not doing it. My dad is being super supportive about it all, which means everything to me. He thinks it's a great idea, and I think I do too. Don't worry, they have internet over there and regular "blog" updates will still occur. Europe, here I come.  MOVIE ROLE I WISH I COULD HAVE HAD  I wish I could been the random naked extra that was draped over Brad Pitt's glorious naked back the first time we see him in Troy. I have five letters for that...Y U M M Y. (well I guess that's really three letters, but you get the drift)

       I work on a soap opera called Passions from time to time (hence the references to the TV nurse) and just recently I was called in to be a "wench" in a spoof on Pirates of the Caribbean. I had to wear a curly red wig for about nine hours which forced me to call upon all of my Buddhist concentration in order to not rip the thing from my head. But hey, all in the name of "the art", right? Bleh. I enjoy working on the show though. I have been with them for about a year and a half, and even though they haven't seen fit to give me any LINES yet (I am not sure they are aware I can speak) I am none the less learning a lot from being around an actual professional television production. Theatre was my major in college and I learned about the business aspects of theatre there, but as far as the business out here, I was definitely a novice. But I sit back and I observe the crew and directors and how they all interact with the actors and I feel like I am receiving a minor graduate education just being on the set. Beyond the fact that it fulfilled a dream to walk on to an actual studio lot and soundstage. Surreal, lemme tell ya. I never watched the show before I was on it, but now that I know the cast and have been on the sets, I get a laugh out of watching some episodes. I have been present for some fun cast moments as well. Like the time two of the "Hot" young guys on the show (Eric and Justin who play Ethan and Fox if you happen to follow) decided to take bets on an arm wrestling match between to the two. Now Justin came out sans shirt because he was about to shoot a pool scene, and Eric was finishing a hospital scene and had a white button down shirt on, and here I am, the ONLY girl on the set at the time (standing there looking around me like "you're kidding me right...This is really about to happen right in front of me? Hollywood rocks) and I am watching them prep the whole event. I bet on Eric because I have worked with him more and he's kind of a friend, and I noticed he was having trouble settling in to the wrestling  pose. I, in all of my brilliance, proposed a solution to the problem and said, "Eric, just take off your shirt, you'll be able to stretch more." AND HE DID. Whew. Good times, man. I would have paid the show to be there that day. As I was in the middle of tis testosterone fest it occurred to me that I was smack dab in the middle of what was probably the fantasy of many a giddy housewife. I should have brought a camera. Not that I would have let anyone else see the pics, mind you. MINE!  Anywho, that's just one of many stories. I will try to remember some more for the future. It just hit me that I have yet to talk about being on the show, so I have some catching up to do, I guess.   FAVORITE NEW T-SHIRT PURCHASE  I bought a cute, baby-blue shirt with a fuzzy bunny smiling out, and the caption on it reads..."It's cute how you think I'm listening."

       I have forgotten to mention my deep and abiding love for the soccer star Michael Owen, which we will explore at a later date, but I have affection for another Owen, Owen Wilson, which we will delve into now. Mostly because of his comic brilliance and wry humor, I find a need to...how to put this delicately...jump his bones? Yes, I believe that "jump his bones" would suit. Anywho, in the standard of the universe to put ridiculously hot men in my path, Mr. Wilson paid my workplace a visit this past weekend. He sat at my bar with a friend of his and ate a LARGE amount of food. Good for him. Nice guy, tipped well over twenty percent, and even didn't mind the minimal questioning I submitted him to (I asked him if he would be making another film with Wes Anderson anytime soon, to which he replied that he had just wrapped acting in Mr. Anderson's latest, due out this winter...yeah, we're buddies now). He's taller than I thought he'd be, and his nose isn't anywhere near as...odd...as it is made to appear in movies. Did I mention he was a nice guy? Well, he is. And so goes my life.   CELEBRITIES I HAVE MET SINCE WORKING IN SANTA MONICA  Roseanne's boss from her show Helen Hunt GALE HAROLD Julia Louise-Dreyfuss some guy from some movies OWEN WILSON  I have highlighted the HOT people...oh, and David Hasselhoff. But I wouldn't call him a "celebrity". Celebrities are celebrated. Hasselhoff is mocked. And his wife was a BEEEOTCH!

       It's a little embarrassing that I had tears careening down my face as I walked out of the theatre after seeing The Notebook, starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. They both turned in stellar performances in this lovely romantic tale. I had gone in expecting one thing because of the way a woman at my work reacted to it after seeing it, but the complete opposite happened and it ended the way all romantic tales should. So why was I crying? Because it was touching and sad and heartrending and reminded me of all of the things that I want out of love. Sigh.  I am going to see Fahrenheit 911 this week. I work next to one of the only theatres in town that is playing it, and the lines have been ridiculous for it. It is sold out for the next six days. There are people walking the lines with petitions and voter registrations...I feel like we're in the 60's again. I signed up to volunteer for Kerry's campaign. I don't know how much a vote is really affected at a grassroots level, but I have to feel like I'm doing something, to feel like I am trying. Because if I just sit on my butt yelling at the TV and cursing Bush, without trying to affect any kind of change, I'd have to count myself a hypocrite...and I abhor hypocrisy. We have to make a stand against this man...stand up for a right to be led by a rational man (well, ideally, a rational woman, but we'll get there eventually) as well as our rights to have some peace in our lifetimes. My little niece is 20 months old, just learning all of her words (back-pack is her new favorite word) and I realized today that in a couple of years we'll have to start explaining words like "war" and "hate" and "Republican" to her, and I am hoping to put off that day as long as possible. I'll try to explain to her that she is lucky to have been born American with all of the privileges that that entails, but along with that luck comes a huge responsibility. She'll need to come to her own understanding of concepts like peace and truth and justice, but once she does, she'll need to apply those beliefs in a way that is best for her and the ones she loves, as well as what is best for the majority. We have a responsibility as citizens of the country that is the "watchdog of the world" to be the watchdog of the ones in charge. Because the real power lies in the hands of the people, and we can affect a great change. We're coming for you, W. Start packing those bags. Or have your wife do it, if it's too complicated.

       My sister, my niece, and most importantly on this day of "Daddy", my brother Brooks and I all went to a cute little restaurant in Malibu called Marmalade Cafe. It has a quaint, small-town-Mary-Englebright kind of feel, with a pretty extensive menu. One of the specials was the Marine Salad, a melange of crab, lobster tail, and shrimp on a bed of lettuce. My sister and I both ordered the salad, not realizing that the thing would be big enough to feed a third-world country. Whew. Huge. I ended taking almost the entire thing home, which is good, because what I paid for it, it has to last me until December. Very yummy though. No one could accuse them of skimping on the crustaceans.   I'd like to send a special "Hello, I love you!" to my Daddy, on this special Hallmark day. My father means the world to me. He's the bar by which I judge all the men in my life, and the kind of person I will always strive to be. Every decision I make carries the weight of a small nagging voice in my head automatically saying "What would your Dad say? Would he approve?". Not to imply that my Dad was overbearing by any means. I just respect my father completely, and I always try to make decisions that I know he'd be proud of. He's the smartest man I know, one of my best friends, and probably the person on this planet that understands me the best. Thank you, Dad! I love you.   AWESOME MOMENT OF THE DAY  I played the old joke on my sister where you say to a person, "Hey, you've got a dick-for on your forehead." and the person's supposed to say, "Huh? What's a dick-for?". Get it? I know, it's juvenile and silly, but most people know the joke. Apparently not my sister, though. She walked right into it and actually said the desired response...classic.

       I have the memory of an elephant. I retain the most ridiculous knowledge in the most ridiculous quantities. I can still remember television line-ups from my childhood, including theme-songs and plot-lines. Anywho, my eight-grade history teacher had a great device for helping us remember the thirteen original American colonies from south to north. Ready?  Georgia and Stan Cody Never Considered Virginia to be a Medical Doctor in a Deli because Nothing Jived in Pa's Connection of Riding in a New York Mass of New Homes.  Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Massachusetts, New Hampshire.  Clever, huh? And I will remember that for the rest of my life, I imagine. Way to go, Mr. Stan Cody. Best teacher I have ever had. He used to dress up to as characters from history as we were learning about them in class. Johnny Appleseed, Abraham Lincoln, a Union soldier, a southern belle...he was just so committed to making the info interesting and the cynical students in the class that would laugh at his efforts just didn't phase him. He demanded a lot out of us, and got it, because he didn't set his class standards low. He had us memorize a list of 75 important dates and events in American history, and we had to list them, in order, without the prompting of a year or reminder of the event, and we had to do that EVERY WEEK. I learned more about American history from that man than I imagine I will ever learn. He was one of those truly dedicated, truly original teachers that one remembers for the rest of their life. Wherever you are, Mr. Stan Cody, La Paz intermediate...Thank you!!!  QUOTE OF THE DAY  I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, be buried in thine eyes...

       When I was younger, like teenage years, I really had no desire to have a family or kids. I don't know why. The whole idea just didn't appeal. Maybe I was channeling the negative feelings I had from my own parents divorce in to whatever ideas I had about my own family of the future. I don't recall when exactly all of that changed for me, but I guess one day I started looking at babies and thinking..."Want...child. Must...produce...offspring." I don't want kids for another five years or so, but the need is definitely there. Not to mention my Mom's been not-so-subtly-hinting that she's ready to be a grandma, but that's neither here nor there, because I am not ready to be a mom yet. I am enjoying being an "aunt" though. I get to watch my Lilypad grow and learn and experience and it's teaching me so much about the way it might be with my own kids. A lot of work, for one thing. Never, ever knock all the work that a housewife does until you've either watched a precocious two-year-old for an entire day, or run a marathon while baking a cake, because they are just about equivalent in energy expended. You thought you liked to sleep? Imagine surviving on about five hours a day, like my sister does. My poor sister, from the same "love to sleep" school of thought as myself, gets absolutely no shut-eye to re-charge her batteries before heading out to work the next morning, but it's all worth it to have the Lilyput. Okay, so she's lost all of her coordination and tends to beef it over the gate in the living-room, and sometimes I catch her wearing inappropriate granny-panties, but she cannot be blamed for these things. You too would find life's tasks more difficult if you we're woken twice nightly by a crying baby-girl.  alright, kids, let's start talking about our next president. Notice I say "next" president, because if Bushy-britches gets re-elected, I might have to stage a coup. That's right, secret service, a COUP. I don't have any weapons or any kind of army, but a coup will be staged none the less. Now, personally, I liked John Edwards, but I understand that he just didn't have the backing this time around. That's fine, he's still young and I expect to see his face again. If this were an ideal world, I would hope to see him on the ticket with Mr. Kerry, but we cannot count on that. I am still trying to figure out Kerry's current strategy of lying low and not really making any statements for or against anything. I suppose he's just keeping his mouth shut and waiting for Bush to dig himself a bigger hole to fall into. Now that I think of it, good strategy, that. he can pretty much chill until the end of the summer and then start running ad's saying things like 'So, you know the current President? The really incompetent one? The one that will later be known as having been one of our worst? You know...the one with the entire book of stupid things he's said sold in the comic section of bookstores? The one that other countries talk about when they talk about hating America? Yeah, that guy. I am waaaaay better than that guy. And here's why...". That might make for a cluttered bumper-sticker, but it's still one that I'll buy. I also like to think that I can show my support by continuing to enjoy my favorite condiment...ketchup. Ketsup? Ketchup? Is there a difference? I don't know. I just know that I love it. Crave it. I sit down when deciding upon meals and figure out what I could dip into ketchup, and then go from there. How I got from presidential elections to tomato paste, I don't know. But this is how my mind works, people. It's a constant battle.  WORDS OF THE DAY  Try these words out-loud. They are enjoyable.

       So my previous post mentions how my Dad had come in to town and it started with the title "Daddy's Here". Now this is the way that I spelled 'Daddy's', but the spellcheck told me that it was wrong and that I should change it to "Daddies". I knew this wasn't right, but it was late at night, and there was a small voice in my head saying, "Well, hell, it's a COMPUTER for pete's sake. I guess it knows better than I do". So I posted it with the computer's version of the title and proceeded to be shunned and mocked by my family the next day after they read it (it doesn't help that my big sister is a elementary school teacher and my father is a college professor). Ridicule! Mockery! Shame! I was forced to edit the post the next day and prove to them by example that the computer was partly to blame. I will take 79% of the blame, being that I am a reasonably intelligent and rational being and therefore should have stood up against the computer in defense of my own grammar, but that's neither here nor there. End of the day, lesson learned. Disaster averted.   I am currently awake, which is a rarity for me at this point of the morning. I don't think rational people should be up before ten in the morning, but I understand that there are circumstances that warrant such tom-foollery. I am appalled when I drive by people at 7:30 am that are running or some other strenuous activity. Don't get me wrong, I love to run and try to do so every other day. But I wait until my body has woken up so as not to send my muscles in to shock. I can just picture them (my muscles...cause they talk) saying, "What the? We were just...sleeping? And now we're RUNNING? Haeeelll no." I guess I just spent too many years waking at the crack of dawn to go to school, and I think it's going to take a couple of decades to catch up. My dad used to harp at me for sleeping in on the weekends, and now he sleeps till noon when he can, so pfffft to that. Sleep, my pretties...sleeeeeeeeeep. It's my...third favorite thing to do. Any guesses on the first two?  Allrighty, fresh and tidy. PS, if anyone out there can offer me any advice on my migration to the UK, I would appreciate any and all help. Especially in the job arena.   MOVIE OF THE DAY  Dude, I cannot WAIT to see the new Harry Potter. Perhaps I am a little more obsessed with the series than a 23-year-old should be, but fooey on that 'cause I am still a kid at heart. And in my opinion, you'd be hard pressed to find fantasy that is more skillfully written and a world that is more actualized than the one that created by JK. Props, you lovely English mama, you.

       Lemme just start with saying I had a STELLAR weekend. Now, you, the reader, cannot hear me say this out loud, and therefore probably cannot grasp the full weight of the sarcasm behind that statement, but let me assure you, it is quite present. I guess we can start off with good news, which is that I finally chopped my hair off this week. I was so ready to do it, that I was getting mad at my hair while I waited for the salon appointment to approach. I ended up taking about 14 inches off. It is sitting in my room in a long braid, waiting to be sent to Locks of Love, a charity org. that people send their cut hair to so that they can make wigs out of it for cancer patients. Anywho, I LOVE the cut and am so happy to have a new look and a lot less weight on my noggin. I will post the results as soon as I have my new head-shots taken. (I LOVE having a ridiculously talented photographer in the family).  Now that that's covered, we can move on to the train-wreck that was my weekend. On Saturday I felt a sugar crash coming and tried to prevent it, but I went too far past the time I should have eaten because I was waiting for my break, and my body went "Uh-uh" and shut me down in the middle of a busy night. They almost called an ambulance for me, but orange juice saved the day, and all was well. Then, on Sunday, on my way to work, I got side-swipped in a lovely little hit-and-run scenario. The girl that hit me had a nicer car than mine, and I think I did more damage to her car, but she took off anyway. I was left with a small dent and a few scrapes, oh yes, and a flat tire and bent front chassis. Joy. This led directly to the highly amusing scenario of me and my wonderful co-workers attempting to put the donut tire on my car at two am, and a few drinks in. It took about six of us, but we got it done. That part was fun...until we lowered the jack and realized the DONUT was also flat. FABULOUS. So I thumped down the freeway at three in the morning, dreading what all the damage would cost. End of the day, four new tires ( I needed them anyway ), and fixing whatever thing got bent that was making the car pull to the left? $426.12. Rapture. Set me back from London a little bit, but screw-em all, I'm still going. I don't know if I mention it enough, but I LOVE my mustang (her name is Sally), and I am quite upset that she now has some surface scars from my FIRST EVER accident (of course I wouldn't crash any of my previous "crap" cars), but she'll survive, and when I can afford it, she'll get a little buff-up.  The rare highlight of this wonderful weekend was the visit to our establishment from Alanis Morissette and her UBER BABE fiance, Ryan Reynolds. This man is RIDICULOUSLY good-looking. They were very cute and lovey-dovey. Lucky girl. Lucky guy, for that matter.   PARENTAL AWARD OF THE DAY  To the parents of Ryan Reynolds, I salute you for creating a truly fine work of art.

       The impossible has FINALLY happened. My niece has finally said my name! This may sound minor to you, but it has been a running joke in my family that she has taken so long to say my name. I mean, on the list of people Lily knows in this world, it goes; 1. Mommy 2. Daddy and 3. Aunt Meghan (followed closely by and probably tied with Kiki and Sashi, her kitties). So the fact that she couldn't figure out how to say my name was a little frustrating. She could say vacuum, back-pack, Pop-pop (for her grandpa), and various other words that seemed more difficult and less familiar than "Aunt Meghan". My sister figured "Meghan" was too hard for her, so she was trying to convince me I should have Lily call me "Magoo". Yeah, thanks...I'll pass. But as I mentioned, she finally said it this morning. I am at my sister's to baby-sit for a few hours, and my brother was telling me how she's learned to say a lot of cute stuff in the past week since I've seen her. Par example: "Bless You". She said "bless you, mommy" this morning when Marisa sneezed, so I pretended to sneeze to see what she'd say, just really expecting the "bless you" and not hoping for a name following, because, as I said, this has been a long-running joke in my family. But sure enough, "bless you Meghan" was what came out, and Brooks and I just looked at each other in shock, then we ran around the room in our jubilation, chanting and laughing, which Lily gladly joined-in to, not really understanding but enjoying the madness none-the-less. Good day, man! She's my smart little girl, and I am very proud of her. How many baby's do you know that have been able to use sign-language since way before she could speak? That's right, beeotch...genius.  QUOTE OF THE DAY  "Bless you, Meghan"  Lily Anne Ayola, 8:22 am, July 12, 2004

       It's a pretty sad day for the Republican party when my grandparents are actually considering not voting for the incumbent Republican president. Now, with no prior knowledge of said 'rents, I can understand that a statement like this might not seem so amazing. But these two people have been voting republican since they could vote...since the 1930's, people. Never once, in all of that time, have they ever even remotely swayed from their chosen party. But the bumbling of W has caused them to re-think their vote for this election, and they might actually do the unthinkable...VOTE DEMOCRAT!!! No! Surely not! Has the sky fallen? Are they wearing ski-jackets in hell? Madness. Madness I tell you!!  Oh, and can we talk about the wimpy-ass NBA basketball players that TURNED DOWN a spot on the Olympic team because they were afraid of attacks on the American team? Your country has asked you to step up, you're the best of the best, you get paid almost 300 times the amount my sister makes (my sister, the elementary school teacher, molding the minds of tomorrow), and you're too chicken-shit to bring home a gold medal to a country that could use a little nationalistic pride right about now? I wash my hands of you. (Not that I cared in the first place).  And finally, on this day of days, I wish to send a loud and boisterous HAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPY BIRTHDAY BROOKS! To my favorite brother-in-law. He's a mind-bending FORTY-YEARS-OLD today. Here's to sixty more, bro!   QUOTE OF THE DAY  To die; to sleep. To sleep; perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub.

       I wonder if the "blog" community would turn on me like they did to the Josh Lyman character on "The West Wing" when tried to post on a site dedicated to him? If I don't post enough or don't make my posts interesting enough, will there be a virtual lynching? Scary thought.  I am trying not to become a political snob, but when a family of republicans came in to my store the other day wearing "Bush/Cheney" stickers on their chests, I felt myself giving them veiled dirty glances. Of this, I am ashamed. People are entitled to their opinions, not matter how sadistic and fascist they might be.  And on a completely different note, on the subject of my continued fascination with how random my work-place is, I was hosting a couple of nights ago and Hillary Swank walked in in scrappy jeans and a t-shirt and asks me if we have waffles. I replied that we didn't at that time (bear in mind, it's 11:30 pm when she walks in), and then she says "Are you sure?", and though I only answered that we didn't, in my head I'm thinking two things; 1. Am I sure? yeah...i think so...I do work here and I would probably know something like that for sure, and 2. Am I sure? Do you mean, could you possibly twist my arm and use your star power to asks my cooks to take out all of their breakfast equipment and ingredients just so you can have some waffles in the middle of the night? In that you are not the Pope or the President, nor are you Brad Pitt (I'd make ANYTHING happen for Mr. Pitt) I'm gonna have to say no.
