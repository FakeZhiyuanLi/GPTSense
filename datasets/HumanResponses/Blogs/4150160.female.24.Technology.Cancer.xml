      This is how it has gone from Happy office to Cube life.....  Year 1- Happy office alllllllllll to myself..... I can get used to this... surf the web, talk on the phone, no hiding my screen from anyone.... privacy. LOVE it..... Year 2- Share happy office with 1 other "happy employee" This isn't too bad.... She is cool... I can still chat, browse, and talk on the phone.... I just cant get too indepth when it comes to personal calls.... what would she think if she over heard?! Year 3- Partition life..... Sharing 1 large room with many boys, and 1 other girl.... with only partitions to muffle the sounds of IM beeps, and phone calls.... OMG did he REALLY just tell his wife THAT? punk.... and what the HELL are you eating?? im going to barf! Year 4- Cube life.... no personal phone calls... anything that requires more than a yes, no, or maybe in the conversation is out of the question. ewwwww WHAT did you eat lastnight? cause you be STANKIN! fights for 1 tiny bathroom, and hide your computer screen at all costs.... 1 thing I HAVE to say about cube life ( as Kim puts it) is that we have ALL grown to use our sense of hearing... I can now hear approaching footsteps a GOOD 2 cubes away.... Im getting better at it!  1 last thing.... WHY OH WHY must we have 3-8 meetings a week?? they are 2 hours of WASTED time.... you guys can go have the meetings, ill stay here at my desk and try to remember what it was like to have a office the same size all to myself.... and not share it with 3 other people! maybe I can fake the Flu, and everyone will want to stay away from me?? naaaahhh.... they would all flock to me so they TOO can have just 1 day of home time, and not cube life!

      Ok, so yesterday SUCKED..... I got my braces tightened.... not so bad, right?  NO!!!!!!  it was TERRIBLE!!!! i went to bed at aabout 9 pm lastnight....  Hubby threw a tempertantrum until 12 am, and i sat on the couch in tears for the next 5 hours because of the damn tooth pain!  imagine about 9 teeth feeling like they are loose, and every movement, breath, or change in outer elements make you want to scream!  yup thats me!  1/2 a dozen tyenol, a big ol cup of hot coffee,  and some nyquil later, it was FINALLY sleep time !   Im dreading how my Cube Guard is going to react tomorrow....  I think im going to have to steal Mrs. Hill's idea and put up a tazer.... hehehe  Anyone want to pack my house up for me?  Im willing to pay in, cookies, beer, and bad ass apple pies ( if i do say so myself)  even though i know that mixture sounds nasty... heheheheh   hummm, 2 oclock... only 3 more hours till my WONDERFUL hubby yells at me for " being home all day and doing nothing!"  ummm... hello!!! SICK! what dont you understand about that!  ok, im done with my poor poor me post!!! next one will be better ! promise!

      If I have 1 bit of advise for ANYONE..... When it comes to buying a house, don't just settle for anything. Because in 2 years, the "kinda perfect" house will be obsolete, and you will want more more more! GRRRRRRRRRRRRR what were we thinking? Now, we REALLY did find the perfect house... and it could slip through out clammy, stressed out fingers! Some people I tell ya.... Stupid important people to the process get to take week long vacations in MEXICO while we sit here and piss ourselves thinking it won't get done in time. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. That's about all I have to say about that.  Thank GOD its almost Friday... now that Wednesday is almost over, I can say that. LOL Maybe, just MAYBE if we are lucky, Mr. Meanie will not be here tomorrow or Friday.... YEAH wishful thinking! Atleast he seems to have lightened up a bit.  Ok, its time to go home and play with the munchkin.... The 1 thing that makes the crappy days worth while!

      Why do bosses have to ruin a PERFECTLY good week day? Some people need to go to Mean People Jail. I could NEVER EVER be mean to someone.... let alone terribly mean to everyone I meet! How do they have friends and loved ones when they are such terrible people inside? I read a article about 2 weeks ago about "Bully Bosses"  and OMG... its true!  Except this time, the principal cant give the bully detention....  because they are too AFRAID to do it!  GRRRRRR- Poo on YOU!.. punk.  ( no no no! i dont mean you guys!.. if ANYONE reads it.. lol)
