						   Hi everyone,  I will present a seminar entitled "Qualitative Research for E-Commerce' at the Faculty of Management, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya Campus, Malaysia on 10 September 2004, 3.00 - 4.00pm. It will be based on the Qualitative Research Seminar course that I took at IIMA recently.

						   Hello,  I have been thinking about the issue of cumulation of knowledge produced through qualitative research. One of the goals of science is to produce knowledge that can be accumulated. In many approaches to qualitative research (e.g., grounded theory, especially in coding textual data), the concern for intersubjective verifiability is not encouraged. It seems to me that such an approach runs against the goal of producing knowledge that can be accumulated.  Any comments/reference on this issue would be welcome.  Regards,  Rajiv

						   This is a great idea Nik, Sanjiv and Joan and I were considering doing the same thing with some ideas we are kicking around via e-mail. Maybe this will inspire us. In the mean time, is this a good place to post my dissertation abstract? I need some ideas for journals to send it to.  How does one find out who is singed onto the BLOG? Kathy

						   Welcome to "Qualitative Research Asia", a weblog -- or "blog" -- for those interested in substantive and methodological issues of Qualitative Research in Asia. With about half the globe's population, Asia represents a fascinating melange of cultures, languages, histories, economies, polities, and traditions. Qualitative Research approaches offer intellectual windows into the tumultous change processes occurring in Asia.  While the methodological palette of this blog is wide, in substantive terms we represent applied social science researchers in fields such as Marketing, Organizational Behavior, Human Resources, Communication Studies, Consumer Studies, Public Administration, Business, Education, Technology Management, Entrepreneurship, Development Studies, Health Care, and so forth.  We hope this blog will serve some of these key functions for its members:   A place to try out new ideas  A way to solicit comments on pre-publication drafts  A forum for comments and discussion on issues of interest   For the general readers, we hope this blog would:   Provide a preview of upcoming research work  Serve as a reference guide for qualitative research in applied settings  Offer insights about the economies, societies, cultures, and organizations of Asia.   In the initial stages, Nikhilesh Dholakia ( urlLink nik@uri.edu ), Professor in the College of Business Administration at the University of Rhode Island (URI), and a visiting faculty at Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA) and Abhishek Goel ( urlLink agoel@iimahd.ernet.in ), doctoral student at IIMA, would provide the coordination and moderation support for this blog.   As it evolves, we hope others will pitch in to support the blog -- making it a blog  of  the members, and not a just a blog  for  the members.  Welcome aboard!
