       Frankly, Im not very keen on it. Really? Really.  I mean... it pretty much involves my taking on an entire squadron with nothing but my bodyfat protecting me. It's all about the technology, though. Look at it this way: they'll have no idea what they're up against, while you'll know exactly what you're up against. You'll take them completely by surprise! Yes... Look, you'll take down half of them before they even see you. Yes, but what about the other half? There's a program for deflecting bullets. Isn't it expensive? Well, just be carefull not to get shot at too often. Thanks... I guess... I guess I'm just not used to this sort of thing. I mean, I've done a lot of crazy shit in self defense, and I've killed more than a few times. But this is... very different. And besides, what makes you so sure they won't have a real defense? We've done surveillance. None of them is shaped for it like you are. Look, I've gone through your scripts myself, like you asked, and I've added a few tricks of my own. No-one I've ever met could take you down while your fight is on. You know, I've been meaning to lose weight. Don't make me laugh. Just run some artery cleaning and cardiovascular strengthening progs and you're the healthiest man on earth. Okay, but, about this plan... Look, I would go if I could, but my count is low, and I've been starved for weeks. It'll take me months to get back in the kind of condition you're in. Alright, alright... it's just, it seems like a lot of killing for one uplink. What is knowledge? Power. And what would they do to us if we had the uplink? Kill us.  Alright already.  Just... don't be surprised if I come back a lot thinner. Heh.  You'll always be a fat man to me. How sweet. We get in, we suck the net, get what you're looking for, and get out. There's no organic matter within 10 miles of here, and you can almost taste the pixiedust. Tell me about it. Fighting it off shows up as a line item on my calorie budget. Believe me, I don't want to hang around here any longer than necessary. Kama... what if they make a sacrifice? They can't. That's the beauty of it, Dima, any undefended carbon goes to the pixiedust, to feed the ghosts. They can't get more than five percent of it. What a god-awful wasteland. That's why you have such a  huge  advantage. ...I keep forgetting that I should be proud of my blubber.  It makes it so hard to move around most of the time. It's not blubbler, it's wealth.  Portable power, potential energy. So... are you ready? What the hell.  I'll shoot you a line when it's clear.  An ancient sattelite dish sits on top of a metal hut in the middle of a small desert, roughly a 20 mile hole in the forest where nothing can grow. As the fat man lumbers out of the shadow of the trees under the cover of a starless night, he whispers a few words into his headset. His movement is suddenly more graceful, he seems to glide across the desert, ignoring the odd holographic ghost that pops up to stare at him or entreat him or attack him, in madness. Ignoring also the thousands of probes, his scripts easily fending off their advances. He glides like a shadow toward the hut.  Shapes show up on his display, moving along foxholes surrounding his target. He pulls a focus ball out of his pocket and holds it close to his face, and he whispers a few more commands, before giving it a gentle toss in the direction of the hut.  Silence.  Screams.  Shots.  All at once, the desert basin comes alive with ghosts, as the pixiedust starts gnawing into the freshly dead bodies.  "Reward to be paid by Microsoft Corporation for--" "Help Me!" "Please..." "I'll kill you now!" "Thank you for taki-- "No!" "You, you killed me!" "Stop!" "More!  Give me more!"  Thousands of ghosts, across the desert, suddenly feasting on the fallen soldiers, all of that energy running into their deranged personalities. Kama has never seen anything like it.  Mayra wakes up. She's been sleeping for a hundred years, after writing her last script. She doesn't like living in a computer. That's why she sleeps, saving up her calories and letting the other ghosts waste them on passerbys. She alone made a plan, and now she's executing it. A fresh surge of energy puts her over the threshold, and her script starts running, scanning. 30 humans at the hut. 25. 20. 15. Too dangerous. One human far away, on the edges of the forest. Her focus ball starts rolling that way, and then picks itself off the ground as it builds up speed. Energy to spare.  Dima sits down in a foxhole, breathing hard. The other QMan is dead. There are 8 soldiers left, and they're busy shooting the ghosts. Whenever one of them gets near Dima, they drop, and Dima shudders. Already he's noticeably thinner. His face is white and he's shaking. Around him dead bodies are disintegrating under the pixiedust. Ghosts are springing up all around him, yelling at him, attacking him, trying to hack his defenses. His programs keep him secure, snuffing out several of the peskier ghosts. So many. So many. He shuts his eyes and covers his ears, shivering, as his calories are sucked away into his fight program.  Kama's display puts up a warning, and he feels a familiar burst of adrenaline as his defenses kick in, sucking at his living tissues to fend off the attacker, he can't even tell what's going on, but it hurts.  Mayra brought her dust with her, but she barely needs it. This human is weak. Her reserve of energy is much greater, and soon the script she had been able to suck, the crowning achievement of her body's last 5 minutes of life, will be set loose on his brain.  Dima finally opens his eyes. He coughs, and a little blood comes up. It happens, he's told. He orders his scripts to stand down to level 2 alert, and stands up carefully. He feels weak, but also lighter than he's been in years. They say the extra weight just goes into the atmpsphere, but he doesn't really understand the chemistry behind it. No-one else is alive. The ghosts have mainly gone quiet, only a few screamers and a few drones are left in the area. They can all be ignored. He steps inside the hut and surveys the scene. There it is, the uplink, in all it's obscene glory. Just another console. He dictates a brief message to Kama.  Kama is reeling, but he's not out of tricks yet. The attack is strong, but simple, just a push to force him to spend his defenses. With a word he launches a counter-attack to stop his opponent's heart. Nothing. Crap.  Dima gets no response.  After a couple of hours he logs on and takes a look around.  Mayra's script fails.  The host is dead.  She's spent.  The fat man leaves.

       Chamberlain Franco was a simple man of simple tastes. He liked his bread buttered, his soup heated, his beer malted. If you asked someone, on a whim, to choose a single word that best described the Chamberlain, the word you most likely would hear would be "round." Others might say "plump" or even "pudgy" but this author prefers the term "round" because of its inherent objectivity. He was indeed a round man (his rotundity being a matter of great report throughout the kingdom), especially when it came to his head, which was as smooth and hairless as an egg (a hairless egg, that is). His favorite activity was reading by the firelight, but if you had pressed him to name a second-favorite, he would probably have settled upon lacing his shoes. There was something altogether calming about the activity, and whenever he was a trifle upset, perhaps because his bread had not been buttered, his soup had not been heated, or his beer had not been malted, he fell back on shoe-lacing like an infant child falls back on its bottle. After an hour or so of this activity he usually found himself ready to venture back out into the world, to take on whatever obstacles life threw at him. And indeed, one of life’s favorite pastimes was chucking obstacles in the path of Chamberlain Franco.  Here is how it all began.  For thirty-three years he had served the Lord Weatherby of Haverdyle Hauk as his personal assistant, tidying his rooms, picking out his clothes, seeing to it that his fireplace was lit every evening. It was not a difficult task, but it was one that he had put great effort into nonetheless. Old Weatherby was a pleasant enough chap, the uncle of the King, a man who was used to wealth and privilege but was by no means unthoughtful when it came to those lower down in the power structure. But it was not Old Weatherby who caused the trouble; it was Young Weatherby. After thirty-three years of employment, Chamberlain Franco was startled and displeased one day to learn of his master’s death. Startled because Old Weatherby, though Old, was just as lively as Young Weatherby, and displeased because he had never thought very highly of Young Weatherby, and was not looking forward to following his every order. Some years ago he had signed a contract with the elder Weatherby, in which he had received uncommonly good living arrangements in return for agreeing to work for the family for fifty years. Yet the prospect of seventeen more years of work beneath the wily new Lord Weatherby, whose impish faced matched his impish attitude, put him into such a fit that he was forced to tie and untie his shoes for several hours before he felt capable of grappling with the reality of his situation. Finally he revved up the courage to go and speak with said Weatherby, and found himself knocking at the man’s door. The door creaked open and a pair of silver-black eyes peered out at him. Then suddenly the door flew back, and the spindly man stood looking at him, grinning an impish grin. "Well?" He demanded, waving his arms about in a wild manner so that they no longer resembled arms, but rather ribbons, rippling in the wind. "How goes it, Chamberlain Franco?" Slowly, cautiously, with many good looks at his shoelaces for moral support, Chamberlain Franco explained to his new master that he no longer wished to serve as his personal assistant. "That is all very well," Young Weatherby answered, with an eerie widening of the eyes and flaring of the nostrils. "But you signed a contract. I can’t just let you out of it. What would my father say? Hmm? What would he say?" He paused and eyed the Chamberlain mysteriously. "Well?" "Sir?" "I asked you what he would say." "Oh—you know, I’m not quite sure." "I thought you weren’t. That is why you had better leave this to me. I always know what to do in these situations." "You do?" "Yes, and here is what I have decided: you shall be allowed to leave your work—" "Oh, thank you, sir!" "If," Young Weatherby said, pressing his lip to his teeth and holding the "fff" sound for as long as possible. "Mind the if, sir, mind the if!" "If what?" "If you do something." "Do what?" "Hmm. Let me think about that one." He leaned a pointed elbow against the doorframe, snapping his teeth as he always did when thinking. "Aha! I’ve got it!" He leaped up upon his toes and gleamed down at Chamberlain Franco good-naturedly. "A thousand mischiefs!" "A thousand mischiefs, sir?" "Yes. There is not nearly enough mischief in this world, if you ask me, and I’m sure I’ll get a kick out of yours." "But sir—" "Now, now, little bon-bon, don’t get uppity with me. I want my thousand mischiefs and I’m not going to let you go without them. Are we understood? Excellent! Good night. You will no doubt want to get started on them in the morning." He slammed the door in the Chamberlain’s face, and Franco was left, as he made his way down the corridor, to wonder what the devil he had just gotten himself into. The following morning, before even the birds had begun to sing, Young Weatherby rang for his chamberlain, and Franco was forced to hop out of bed and go and see what he wanted. "Well?" demanded the Young master, upon seeing Franco’s spherical face at his door. "Sir? You rang for me?" "Don’t change the subject." "I wasn’t—" "I was just wondering, have you done any of your mischiefs yet?" "Er—no, sir." "No? What in blazes have you been doing since I last saw you?" "Sleeping, sir." "Sleeping? Well, that’s no good. You aren’t going to cause much mischief if you go around sleeping all the time." "I suppose not, sir, but—" "E-nough, round one! I can see that you are in need of instruction. No matter. Mine is a kindly spirit, and I will be all too happy to teach you a few tricks of the trade. Now, we are having guests today, and I think it will be the perfect chance for you to try your hand at mischief-making." "On the guests, sir?" "Yes, of course. Who else is there? Now I don’t want you to go trying to cheat me out of my rightful due, so I am going to ask that you write up a brief report for every mischief that you do—nothing complicated, just a little documentation. You don’t mind that, of course?" Chamberlain Franco gave a little, uncomfortable cough. "Er—no sir, of course not." "Good. Be off then." The door slammed once again in Franco’s face, and he trotted off to his room, a growing unease manifesting itself somewhere in the deep pit of his stomach. The guests arrived that afternoon, and an interesting bunch they were. The guest list, which could only have been compiled by a quirky eccentric of his new master’s ilk, consisted of Young Weatherby’s cousin Morticus, Morticus’s wife, a brash young pigeon-hunter from Ankers, a middle-aged heiress, and a farm boy from the North. Chamberlain Franco went about serving them as he always did, but beneath his impeccable exterior his mind was churning, bubbling, even brewing, as it strove to think up strange new mischiefs to commit. For, like it or not, he knew he must go ahead with these thousand mischiefs, if they were his only ticket to freedom. It was quite by accident that he found himself out in the stables that afternoon. Lord Morticus had been concerned about his horses, fearing that they might have been placed by mistake next to other horses of lesser breeding, and had sent Chamberlain Franco out to check up on the matter. "Two whites," had been the description. "Incredible animals, absolutely breathtaking to behold." Franco did not know much about horses, but he knew how the stables were arranged, and so he went first to the stalls where the finest beasts were regularly housed. There he saw a pair of white horses, and he decided they looked just about as good as any other horse. Clearly, then, they had been housed correctly. He was about to turn and go back to the house, when it suddenly occurred to him that his first act of mischief had been dropped in his lap. Stealthily, looking around to make sure he was not being watched, he opened the stable door and led the two whites out. He took them down to the lowest stables, where he spotted a pair of shaggy, hideous creatures who looked to have come from the other side of the marshes. They, too, were white, so he brought them out and put Morticus’s stallions in their place. Then he led the awful beasts back to the empty stall, closed the stable door behind him, and dusted off his hands, a look of supreme satisfaction gracing his round face. "Hello there." Chamberlain Franco gave an involuntary start and turned to stare at Griffin, the visiting farm boy. "Er—hello. What—what are you doing out here?" "Oh, nothing. I just came to gaze upon the windswept meadows." "I see." Franco raised a skeptical eyebrow and was about to withdraw when Griffin stopped him. "Chamberlain," he said, his earnest blue eyes lighting up his otherwise featureless face. "May I ask you something?" "Er—of course. What is it?" "I want your opinion. Here, sit down, and listen to this." Franco took a seat on a nearby bench and stared at the odd young man. Griffin put one foot upon an old stump and stood there, resting his elbow on his knee. "The willows weep," the boy said, throwing his head back so that the wind caught his dangling hair and swept it from his face. "The crawlies creep. Down in the hole in the ground, all the critters run around. Every mouse and every cat wishes he was round and fat. Where has my sweet love gone to? I wonder if she’s eating fondue?" Griffin turned to look at the taken-aback old Chamberlain. "I see you’re speechless. No doubt you can tell that I am a natural poet. You see, this is where my trouble lies. My heart is the heart of a poet, but my parents want me to be a farmer. All I want is to sell the farm, to follow my dreams, to gain true recognition as the poet that I am. Please, advise me, what should I do?" Franco was about to tell the boy to get a grip on himself, maybe even recommend that he commit himself to a loony bin, when he remembered Young Weatherby’s instructions, and was compelled to rethink the matter. "I think," he said at length. "I think that—well, there’s really only one thing to do. Sell the farm, my boy; by all means sell the farm! I am sure you will make an excellent poet!" "Really? Oh, thank you! I will most certainly go out and do just that! So long, my friend. I am going to seek my fortune!" And with that Griffin ran off across the plain, hooting and howling with excitement as he went. The chamberlain could not help but feel a twinge of pity for the boy as he stood and went back to the house. He did not feel it had been very nice of him to encourage the boy in what must be a life-ruining pursuit. But, after all, what could he do? His duty was his duty, and it must be done. When he opened the door to his sitting room he saw that Lady Dora, the woman who had just inherited a large estate from her wealthy uncle, was waiting for him. She was seated in his favorite armchair, hands folded neatly upon her lap, looking quite comfortable despite her status as a trespasser. "Lady Dora!" he exclaimed, irritated at finding her here. "Ah, there you are, Chamberlain." She arose and looked about, nose in the air. "Come along, I have a job for you." "A job?" "That’s what I said." Unwillingly, Franco followed her down the hall and into her room. "You see?" she said. "Er—excuse me?" "The room is all wrong." "Is it?" "Yes. The bed ought to be on the other side, not so close to the window. The desk should be across that way, where the light will hit it more fully, and those chairs ought to be over here on this side. The wardrobe ought to be by the bed, the tables should be facing one another, in that corner, and the stool should be positioned where—" "Yes, Lady Dora. I quite understand. If you like, I will summon a few of the men to handle this business for you." "I don’t want a few of the men. I want you." "Me?" "Yes. You are clearly the proper man for the job." "But, ma’am—" "Chamberlain, why do you think I waited so long for you to return? Because you are the only man I trust with a precise matter such as this one. Now go ahead, get started." He heaved a great sigh and fell to work pushing and pulling the various objects of furniture that had been arranged around the room. Most of them had not been moved for ages, and every inch that he misplaced an item was like driving a steak through his conventional heart. He did not like change. He liked things the way they were. And yet, he knew, he had to obey his guest’s biddings. "You know, Chamberlain, I think I may have been mistaken," she said, after he had moved everything to its designated place. "I really think the desk and the tables ought to be exchanged. Don’t you?" "Yes, my lady," he said, and performed the desired exchange. "On second thought, maybe the desk was better off where it was. Maybe the tables ought to have been swapped with that low dresser." When at last Chamberlain Franco had succeeded in pleasing the finicky lady, he felt on the verge of collapse. He had never been prone especially to back pain before, but then he had never taken much to furniture-pushing. Now he felt it impossible even to hold himself up straight, and instead found himself leaning forward at a bit of an angle, peering around the room like a demented old hunchback. "You are satisfied, then, Lady Dora?" "Yes, Chamberlain, thank you. You are a good man. I wish I had a servant like you to do my bidding. There is so much I would like to do with my estate, and with well over a hundred rooms to the place, plus the grounds to be thought of, it is difficult to find a man who would be willing to take on the task. A pity that Young Weatherby already has you in his employ, or I would go after you myself." She pressed a coin into his hand. "Now go on, I’ve got to get ready for dinner." As Franco was going from room to room later that evening, lighting fires in the guests’ rooms, he decided, in a spiteful spirit, to skip Lady Dora’s. Let her freeze tonight, he thought. There was a bit of mischief that he was only too happy to commit. A few weeks later, a packet of papers tucked under his arm, Franco made his way down to where Young Weatherby was seated, enjoying a spot of breakfast. "What ho, Franco! I suppose you’ve come to report your mischief?" "I have indeed, sir." He was not much of a writer, and the process of writing up his reports had been responsible for the delay of his presenting them to his master. "How many have you got there?" "Twelve, sir." "Just twelve?" "It was hard work, sir." Young Weatherby took the packet from his Chamberlain and began to turn through the pages. As he did so, he grabbed a handful of mashed potatoes and stuffed them into his mouth, impeding his ability to offer commentary as he read. "I see," he said, as he swallowed the last of his potatoes and jumped to his feet, toppling his chair. "Is this some sort of a joke, man?" "A joke? No—no, it is quite serious." "Oh, Franco, Franco." His master shook his angular head falteringly and waved a few of his lanky limbs around. "You give mischief a bad name, do you know that?" "What do you mean, sir? I thought—I thought I did pretty well, for a beginner." "You just don’t have the right style, Franco. You don’t know how to go about these things. Take, for instance, what you did to Ingo, the pigeon hunter." "I stole his arrow." "Yes, but what good does that do? He’s got at least twenty more!" "It was the only one I can find." He clicked his serpentine tongue. "You are to be congratulated for your effort, Franco, but I just cannot give you credit for that one." "Then what about Lady Neela, your cousin’s wife? That was something, wasn’t it?" "What, stealing her shawl?" "Yes, so she would get cold, and have to go upstairs early." "Ah. Well, as it turns out, her husband Morticus supplied his coat for her." "Oh." "And more than that, Franco, more than that." "Eh?" "You see, before they came my cousin and Lady Neela had been having marital problems, of sorts. They kept getting into arguments. She accused him of having lost his romantic spirit, of no longer caring about her." "So?" "Well, apparently the woman wasn’t asking for much. One little coat-lending and she throws her arms around him and declares that she was wrong, that he is the man of her dreams after all! Her knight in shining armor! Let me tell you, Franco, it was positively disgusting." "I see. But—Morticus’s horses?" "Yes, Franco, about that. You see, Morticus’s horses were the shaggy ones. The ones you placed in the good stables." "What! But he said—he said they were incredible, breathtaking. Those things were—" "I ought to have told you, Morticus has something of a visual impairment. He thinks ugly things are beautiful for no apparent reason. He is very proud of those horses." "And Lady Dora? I did not light her fire once while she was here. She must have been made terrible uncomfortable by it." "Not so, round one, not so. Unlike myself, Lady Dora is horribly eccentric. She doesn’t mind sleeping in a cold room; indeed, she prefers it." "Prefers it?" "Afraid so." Weatherby pinched his lips together and began compulsively to flex his elbows. "Which is why I cannot, in good conscious, count a single one of these"—he held the reports aloft and pointed at them with his nose—"as an act of mischief." "But, sir—" "Never fear, never fear. These pages shall not be wasted. We can still use them, you see, as confetti." He ripped the pages up viciously and began to throw them into the air. When he had none left he bent and picked up some of the scattered pieces, and went on tossing them around, hooting like an owl and bobbing his head like a chicken as he did so. The hooting reminded Franco of something else, and he started to wave his arms around frantically, attempting to get Weatherby’s attention. "Sir—sir!" "What is it?" "Griffin! That, at least, must be considered an act of mischief! I told the boy to sell his farm!" Weatherby sighed tragically. "Unfortunately, Franco, it turns out his parents have long been desiring, in secret, a poet son rather than a farmer son. They never told Griffin this because they believed his heart to be set on farming. Now that he has given himself over to poetry completely, they are one hundred percent behind him. He has even made a small degree of success already. He sent one of his poems to the King, who declared it the best thing he had ever read and commissioned the boy to write a book for immediate publication. So, you see, your advice turned out to improve young Griffin’s life tenfold. I wouldn’t doubt it if you soon received a letter of gratitude from him." "I—I see." Franco hung his head, his heart downcast. Clearly this business of mischief-making was going to be far more complicated than he had at first thought. "Then I have not a single mischief to my credit?" "That would be—yes, that would be correct." Franco turned and began to shuffle out the room, only to be stopped by his master’s shrill reprimand. "Hold it, Franco!" Weatherby barked. "I haven’t excused you yet." "I am sorry, sir." "Do not look so glum, you little teapot. I have decided to take pity on you." "You have?" "Yes. I have decided to release you from my service. The thousand mischiefs shall be forgotten, of course. I can’t hold you accountable for a thing you clearly have no talent for." "Oh, thank you, sir!" "Well, it was the least I could do. Lady Dora was so intent on getting you. She really drives a hard bargain, that woman. I got so sick of seeing her face, I’ve finally decided to go ahead and let her have you. I am going to trade your contract to her for a hairless donkey—a spotted hairless donkey, mind you! A rather rare animal, and I think it will add nicely to my zoological collection. So you see, she will be your master for the next seventeen years, not I. And she says she’s got oodles of work for you to do." "Oh, no, sir!" Franco fell to his knees. "Sir, anything but that! Don’t make me go to Lady Dora! Take me back, sir, take me back!" Young Weatherby tilted his head so that it stood at a horizontal, one hand on his chin and the other on the crown of his head. "What in heavens are you saying, Franco? I thought you wanted out." "I did. But not to Lady Dora!" "Well, you do know what this means, don’t you?" "What’s that?" "I’ll have to give up my little Jojo, the donkey I was telling you about. It will be a sad loss to my fragile heart. I do not know if I will be able to cope with it." "Sir, I’ll do whatever you ask. I’ll work for free, I’ll sleep in the stables. But don’t make me work for that woman." Weatherby nodded. "Very well." "Oh, thank you, sir!" "On one condition." "What is that?" "That you perform a million mischiefs." "A million? Sir, that will very well take me the rest of my life." "Perhaps. But you were the one who said you would do anything. Now will you, or should I go transform your room into a donkey’s paradise?" "Sir," Franco said slowly, "I will do the million mischiefs." "Excellent. You are an excellent man, Chamberlain Franco. And now be gone. To work, man, to work!" Chamberlain Franco grimaced as he climbed up the stairs. When he reached his room he collapsed in his armchair, took a great breath of air and then bent down over his feet. There was much shoe-lacing to be done.

       When the two had gotten back to Tarion’s home, they both sat by the small river on a couple of the larger stones that lined its cut-off southern bank.  "Naria, how did you come back so early?" Tarion questioned with genuine curiosity. "You can’t have gotten to the city before sunset yesterday. That would leave you very little time to shop for a dress, much less since you came back around eight. How did you do it?" She giggled,  "Don’t you believe in miracles, my love?" He smiled as she continued. "Really, it was because I left about four hours before dawn. Father’s cart was even slower coming back uphill else I would have been here sooner." He laughed his amazement.  "My poor, dear Naria, why did you do that to yourself? You’re going to need that rest." She leaned her head on his shoulder as she giggled again.  "You’re going to make sure of that, won’t you, Tarion, dear? Well, believe it or not, I love you that much." He whistled.  "Naria, that was unnecessary, you should have gotten your sleep."  "Truth be told, Tarion, I would have, were it not for Haathwell." Tarion looked down at her, a frown painted across his face.  "Haathwell? Who is this Haathwell?" She shrugged and then laughed.  "A man I met, a warrior I think. He seemed a strange fellow, cautioned me to return to you as fast as I could." She too frowned then. "And he addressed you by name. I had assumed he was someone you knew, but if you don’t know him…" she turned her troubled gaze up to meet his own. "Stranger fellow than I thought." Tarion nodded his concurrence.  "Still, he brought you to me sooner than I had hoped, so he can’t be that bad, can he?" She smiled and kissed him upon the neck, rubbing his back with her left hand.  "I suppose not." They fell to kissing once more, there on the rocks by the river, and the sun had risen considerably higher by the time they were able to think of anything else. Now that the day had become brighter, more animals began moving about the woods. Chipmunks skittered about, picking seeds from the forest floor and stuffing them into increasingly bloated cheeks. A glance might catch a fleeting glimpse of a deer as it moved cautiously closer to the water, careful to stay as hidden as possible among the rowan trunks. The rowans, with their huge leafy canopies decorated with sprinklings of white flowers, which would turn to bright orange berries in the summer, could not be more beautiful than they were in the wonderful sunlight of the new day.  "So then, you’re quite finished?" The two lovers looked at each other, then turned to look at the man who stood behind them, about twenty paces away. He was shorter in stature than Tarion, but his broad shoulders and the tight sleeves of his brown leather overcoat betrayed considerable strength and power. Under his overcoat, which was currently hanging open in a somehow roguish fashion, he wore a tan shirt and leather leggings, with leather plates buckled to the thighs and shins. On either shoulder, he wore pads of thick brown leather, and draped over them was a dark, hooded cloak. The man’s face was weathered, but not ugly, and framed by dark hair that went past his shoulders and was streaked with gray. He wore a careless expression as, arms folded, legs at ease, he watched them. Tarion rose, unsteadily. He wondered who this was. A robber? A potential client? In any case, he was used to odd personages in his trade, and supposed he would have to see this one off. Naria rose with him, putting a hand on his shoulder as she stood on the tips of her toes to whisper into his ear.  "That’s Haathwell." Tarion nodded. The man had obviously followed her. But why? If he had wanted to know how to find Tarion, anyone could have told him who knew the locals, and if he had been, well, after Naria, it would have been pointless to jump her now. Thoughts tore through his mind, but he couldn’t tell which was the best or truest.   He wants to kill us, me, Naria. He wants a guide. He wants to help us. He’s a an old family friend. He wants to bring a message …more, similar possibilities, some of them silly, others near impossible, flushed through the byways of his brain until he forced them to be still so he could concentrate.  "You’re Haathwell?" The man nodded, bowing, affording Tarion an excellent view of a huge, bell-shaped, heavy-hilted sword that lay across the man’s back. He swallowed, trying to quell the fear fluttering in his chest. He tried to think of a question to ask, but only managed what he thought might be a slightly offensive "So?" The man laughed softly, a sound that Tarion found most threatening.  "So? A fair question." Haathwell’s voice was deep and confident, and Tarion felt that if Haathwell had wanted to, the man could easily render him harmless. "So that means that you need some help, son." Naria gasped, clutching Tarion tight, pressing her soft body up against him as she clenched her teeth. Tarion, putting a reassuring arm around her, struggled desperately to keep his own terror from showing. Haathwell smiled wryly, obviously noting the fear that gripped them. "That’s why I’m here. I’m not the threat. I’m the help." Tarion was flung into the natural confusion that almost always follows allayed fright.  "What…Wh…Who?" It was all he could do to keep his stammering at least somewhat understandable. Haathwell, smiled disarmingly as he came closer, his approach slow.  "You are in a lot of trouble, young Tarion, though the real unfortunate part of it is that you didn’t bring it on yourself." Tarion shrugged, spreading his arms helplessly as Haathwell came to a halt five paces from him. Though Haathwell was shorter, Tarion couldn’t shake the feeling that he was looking up at him, rather than down. Haathwell gave a chagrinned sigh. "That’s the kind of trouble I like to help with. Come let us go inside, and I will explain it all to you." Haathwell stood waiting, and it took several seconds for Tarion to realize that he was waiting for Tarion to lead the way in. Keeping his arm around Naria, he shifted her to his right side so that as he steered her past the warrior, Tarion would at least be between the two. He went to his front door in something of a daze, Haathwell going after at a respectful distance. He knew not what this was about, and in truth, not much of what had passed had yet sunk in further than to the point of shock. What was frustrating his mind now, was that he didn’t yet know what it was he was shocked about. Trouble was all he knew as yet.

       Tarion opened the old dresser and drew out his best clothes, the ones he had preserved for this day, keeping them folded and neatly stowed in the cleanest part of his dresser. He laughed with simple pleasure at finally being able to wear them. Although the wedding was scheduled for five o’clock, he decided he could not wait until then, and hastily threw himself into them. Neat, black breeches, close-fitting, but not overly tight, extended downwards from the waist over his shiny black shoes, held up by a black belt with a silver buckle. He wore a tight green vest over a creamy white shirt, with militaristic shoulder pads, as was the current style. Over his hands, he would be wearing the traditional groom’s gloves. He knew it was not nearly as fancy as many other men would bedeck themselves for their own weddings, but it had cost him the equivalent of ten trips through the Harboureth Valley and back, assuming his client was reasonably wealthy. He was quite proud of his wedding day clothes.  When he had donned his costume, and positioned it just as he liked it, he went to his trunk again, opening it and grabbing the thing that lay on top of all else. He buckled the sword and its black and silver scabbard to his hip, adjusting it to a position that he imagined a warrior would wear it. He didn’t know how to use the elegant longsword, although he had taken it out and whirled it around often enough. It had been payment from a retired soldier who wanted to get north, to Tarridon, and had naught else. After Tarion had taken him past Harboureth, to the northern edge of the Danissar Forests, the soldier had offered it, saying he wouldn’t need it anymore, and would be thankful to be rid of the awful memories. Tarion had accepted, understanding of the poor man’s poverty, if not his terrible past. Now he wore it to give his outfit a little extra courtliness. He thought it did the trick. Now all he had to do was go to the village to get himself a bath, a shave, and perhaps have his hair cut and brushed.  Whistling a jaunty tune, he went to the dresser, slipped the ring into his pocket, and strode out his front door. He preferred the fresh air to his old cottage, especially on a day like this. He supposed he would take a quick stroll through the sparser trees around the base of the mountains, so that he wouldn’t have to cross the river, before we went to the village; he had plenty of time. The rowans that grew around his home were some of the rare leafy trees in Danissar, much of the great country’s forests being covered in pines and firs. As he walked, these rowans began to give way to the spindly fir trees, poking into the sky like many-barbed spears.  The land of Danissar was quite beautiful, but was known for being highly inaccessible where there were no roads. It was a very rich country, being the center of the Grandway, practically the only big source of advanced metals, and with plenty of rare minerals, gems, and fine metals like gold, silver, and even platinum. Because of benevolent rulership, wealth was spread quite widely throughout the population, and it was, perhaps, the only nation where the majority of the populace were considered middle or upper-class by international standards. Its people also enjoyed a great deal of personal and economic freedom, and the country survived because of all these people working in mines, often in small clusters of families, to earn their livelihoods. It was really one of the only ways to get money here in Danissar, working in the mines, at least large amounts of money. It was either that or you were a merchant who bought the raw materials and sold them to other nations. There were still taxes, but they were easily affordable to most, and to the others, they were certainly bearable. There used to be a very large contingent of masons in the land, before Castle Danistion was finally completed, not twenty years ago. After that, their number had moved on gradually to places of more plentiful opportunity for their trade. Now the guild did most of the construction as was needed. It was a bountiful nation in which to live, at that time, and Tarion was glad it was where  he  lived.  The ground around here was mostly hard-packed earth, sometimes gravelly, and sometimes giving way to sheets of rock, but, for the most part, nature concurred that in Danissar, there was not much of a place for grass. There were, however secluded fields of tall species of that plant, if one knew where to look. Tarion did. There was one not ten minutes east from his home, surrounded in trees and bordering the suddenly climbing peaks. It was in this field that he now idly wandered, the grass coming to his knees and whispering in an almost conspiratorial manner. It was a place he went sometimes to be away, and be able to see the open sky. It was also one of his favored points for star-gazing. How he loved the stars out here in the mountains, so numerous, so bright, and so clear in the thin air. True, this wasn’t as high in elevation as the mountains that sat before him, but it was a goodly distance upwards of sea-level, probably five-thousand-feet.  Then he saw a shape moving around, back the way he had come. It was still shadowy from the protective shade of the trees, but he could tell it was large. Not as large as he was, but about human-sized. He sometimes saw bears out here, black-bears, but this did not seem like one; it did not move like one. He stared intently at it, crouching down into the grass. He completely forgot he was wearing his nice clothes, and went to one knee, careful not to turn his gaze away, for fear he would lose it. It seemed to be moving in his direction, and appeared unhurried, from the gentle and not frantic movement that he could detect. It reached the edge of the trees and stood there for a time, as if looking out across the field for something, then moved forward, into the sunlight. His heart leapt. It was Naria.  He burst from his cover and began to run towards her. As he did so, she let out a surprised cry, before laughing with pleasure. He could spend all day listening to her laugh. He slowed as he came nearer, letting his legs beat down to a slow trot before finally coming to stand before her, several feet in front her. She grinned coyly at him, examining his getup. She wore her brown dress of wool, which fell to the middle of her shins, and had long sleeves, which she customarily rolled up to her elbows. It had a modest, square-cut neckline, and a cinched waist. In her hands, she held a paper-wrapped package close to her chest. That would be the dress she had bought while she was in town. Before she was done analyzing his clothes, he gave in to his pressing desire to take her in his arms. She shrieked with delight as he twirled her about, before setting her on her feet and giving her a long kiss. She let the package fall softly to the grass as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him back. He loved her. She loved him.  After a long while, they separated, both breathing heavily, their other cares once more coming into their minds. He bent to pick up the brown paper bundle.  "You shouldn’t drop this, it might get dirty," he said, trying to gather his elusive thoughts once more. She blinked innocently, then her gaze lowered to his breeches, and she said,  "It doesn’t appear you worried too much about that for yourself." He followed her gaze. His shoes were no longer shiny, bearing a coating of dusty dirt, and on one of the legs of his breeches, the area at the knee and down also bore the same dusty brown. He grimaced, looking up at her, and smiled apologetically.  "Sorry, I didn’t mean to. I guess I’m just too used to being a woodsguide. I don’t usually have to worry about the dirt." She flashed a crooked smile,  "It’s okay, Tarion, my love, I like you dirty." He smiled back at her and they locked into a kiss again. She pulled away early, this time. "Save some for later, love." He laughed, and, putting an arm around her shoulders, holding the package in his other arm, he led her back in the direction of his dwelling. She slipped arms about his waist as they slowly walked, and curiously tugged at the pommel of his sword, giving him a questioning glance.  "It’s something I’ve had for a few years now; a soldier gave it to me a while back. A retired soldier of course." She smiled in response and said, curiously,  "Do you know how to use it, Tarion?" He gritted his teeth in an uneasy smile.  "Well…no," he admitted, "not exactly."  "Just wearing it for show then?" She gave him an amused glance as he nodded vigorously, then reached up and pulled his head down so she could kiss him upon the cheek. "Well you look simply dashing, my love. Makes me feel like I’m to marry prince." He shifted his shoulders uncomfortably as they walked, and said, quietly,  "Instead of just a woodsguide?" She patted his head, and leaned into his chest more, reassuring him in a gentle, loving tone,  "Instead of just the most wonderful man I’ve ever met." He smiled warmly into her hair, kissing the crown of her head. "I love you, Tarion," she whispered, feverishly.  "I love you Naria," he replied with equal passion. She spun in his arms and pressed her lovely lips to his, and they kissed once more, like it would be the last time they ever did so.

       Tarion woke gently, the world alighting upon him as a lark upon a tree branch. The bland aroma of moth-eaten wool filled his nostrils, mainly because he held his blanket so close, up and over his head. He could hear birds whistling merrily in the rowans just outside the window, as well as the distant roar of the waterfall, some ways upstream. As he withdrew the covers and blinked in the first rays of morning, he let out a calm sigh, and then sucked an invigorating spurt of air in through his nose. The vernal atmosphere never failed to gladden his heart, even when it was already brimming with joy. He could hardly believe it. He was to be married that day.  He sprang from his bed like deer, landing upon the tips of his toes and doing a little twirl for good measure. He felt he could soar into the air on the wings of jubilation, like he could leap into the stars and never fall back down. A grin plastered on his face, he flew about his room in excitement, narrowly avoiding impact with the few articles that lay about his cottage. He dodged his beaten old dresser, hurtled his worn trunk, and ducked under the overhanging, termite-ridden cabinets. When faced with his rusty old stove, he pulled up short and reached out, shaking its imaginary hand and smiling into its make-believe eyes.  "I'm going to be married today, Mr. Stove! Isn't that glorious? And to Naria Gillson, no less! Can you believe it? I am still having trouble myself!" Not waiting for it to respond, he flung open the shabby front door to his cottage and sprinted out the door, not caring that he was still in his smallclothes.  He loved the world, at that moment. The rowans standing benignly about his cottage, the water flowing serenely past in a small river, the sky, so blue and pure and boundless, all looked like the most wonderful thing on earth. The grass, springy and vibrant as it was, tickled his feet in what he decided was amost agreeable fashion. The morning was cold, the grass wet, but he didn't have the sense to care, at that time. He was caught up in the joy of fulfillment.  When at last he returned to his cottage, his ecstasy suppressed now by his alleviating frolic, he surveyed the decrepit shack with a broad grin. The floorboards were solid and thick, but many had chips in them from where he had dropped things in the past. The air in this place was always fresh, as there was no pane in his window. He had long ago made a mental note to put some shutters on, himself, but like most of his mental notes, the idea never culminated in action. It wasn't that he was lazy, or stupid. He was a just a man of sieve-like mind, thoughts passing through and falling through the holes of his brain in multitudes.  Not only in multitudes, in throngs, companies, legions, it seemed every human notion and scheme occurred to him at some time or another. He was nothing grand or fancy. Just a simple guide. He knew routes through the woods that no other did, knew just how to avoid trouble, or gain time. It was his job, and those things were some of the few bits of knowledge in his brain that were never forgotten to him. The job also provided a lot of time for day-dreaming. Of late, his thoughts were always focused around his bride to be.  He had first met Naria five years back. A shepherdess from a nearbye village, Parryton, she was the most beautiful creature he had ever dreamed of, much less laid eyes on. She had wonderful black hair that cascaded in wavelets down her back, ending about midway, naturally. It was complemented by thoughtful brown eyes, and a flawless countenance that would set a blind man's heart aflutter. That was to say nothing of her ravishing form, unspoiled by the simple brown dress that she took to wearing. She was shorter than him, but then, he was exceptionally tall. She would be his. Dear Lifelord, she would be his.  It had stunned him speechless, at the time, far more so because she had been the one to request their matrimony. That she should ever be nervous to request a man's hand was an enigma to him. He doubted a man lived who would refuse it. But she had asked him, and she had wrung her hands, and fretted a good long time about it, anxiety almost disrupting her intention ofasking. He cursed anxiety for its attempted interference, but it didn't matter now, because she would be his. Dear Lifelord, she would be his.  What was most surprising was her affability in accepting his lowly abode and the secluded life of a Woodsguide's daughter. She had smiled when he had mentioned it and said that it would be not much different from her house back in the village, but less crowded. She scoffed at loneliness, saying that she could never be alone if she had his love. Her words had fired him then, and fired him now, with intense, burning, churning, overturning passion. All the world that he cared about now seemed insignificant next to her. And, by the blessed Lifelord, she would be his. She would be his this day.   He sat on his lumpy bed, as he reached down to undo the latch on his chest of things. He would have to get a new bed. Not only was it lumpy, it wouldn't be big enough. As he opened th oak chest and drew it across the floor to rest beside him, his mind flooded with all the contents.   Hammer. Thread. Feathers. Nails. Patches. Hatchet. Wedge. Fire Sticks. Money. Flute. Needles. Mother's Ring. Ahhhh...     That was what he wanted. The thoughts were always random and intermixed, but he had slowly become better at sorting through them for a specific one.   Mother's Ring. I want Mother's Ring.   His hand dove into  the chest filled with odds and ends, many more besides the ones that had entered his mind, and somehow, singularly found what he was looking for. He withdrew his hand, gazing at the silver band, set with a square-cut amethyst. It was the one his mother had always worn. They had told him it was all they found of his mother and father in the charred ashes. No sadness accompanied his remembrance. It was just the way things were, the way he had grown to accept things. He kissed the small piece of jewlery, the small piece of his mother, and whispered to its glossy, violet colored surface,  "Give her the patience to stay with me, mother." He still couldn't help his disbelief in his luck, and with that disbelief came the creeping doubt that it would last. He didn't doubt her love, nor did he think his own for her insufficient to please her, but he wondered if she really understood what her life would be with him. He was used to being away from people for great lengths of time, and found solace in his uninterrupted privacy, but she, being from the village, may not be used to it, and may not welcome it. Still, he would be with her, whenever he had no charge to see through the woods. And she would be with him. To fill the hours with her pleasant smiles and intoxicating laughter. Her laughter could lift the world with its overpowering joy.  He closed the chest, putting the ring on top of his dresser, as he stood and stretched, flexing his wiry, but not weak arms. It would be the ring that bound the two of them together forevermore. He wished then to see her face, but wryly remembered that she would be into town until afternoon, having left yesterday, purchasing a dress. He wondered fancifully how she would look in it. Wonderful, he knew, beautiful beyond measure, but he tried in vain to picture her more beautiful than she already was. He supposed he would have to wait and see.

       It's time for bed.   It took me a long time to get this far, to the very beginning. A long time of turning the other way, going to work every morning, coming home, having dinner, and going to sleep. A long time of steadfastly ignoring my own ache. A long time casting about, in between commuting and computing and consuming. A long time after I admitted to myself what I wanted. A long time after I told myself what I should do.  Finally, clearing out the cobwebs. Finally, dusting off the covers. Finally, at the end of the day, early in the morning, when I'm about to go to sleep, cracking open the lid.  It took me a long time to get this far, to the very beginning.  And that's as far as I'll go for now.   Good night.
