      The caption of my blog is jinxing me.&nbsp; With all this work/travel crap going on, I have no time for  The Novel .&nbsp; But, I will take Notebook with me to the Shore this weekend, and hopefully be inspired enough by nature's glory to write.

      I had an idea this morning.&nbsp; I was thinking something about the promotion of token minorities.&nbsp; Or maybe it was something about&nbsp;the&nbsp;following conversation that occurred during our last staff meeting:      Boss: &nbsp; Nothing much going on in the Office.&nbsp; The rules for telecommuting are being   finalized for the other Division, and since I haven't gotten any clear guidelines on these new     uniform rules, I'm going to be a lot more lenient on when you can work from home.&nbsp;         Colleague: &nbsp; Wait, what new rules are these?&nbsp;     Boss: &nbsp; Well, our Division has always had very liberal telecommuting rules, and now the     Front Office has instituted some new rules to bring uniformity across the Divisions.&nbsp;   Colleague: &nbsp; Those people have always complained about us.&nbsp; I can't believe we're going to     have to give up our benefits just because there are more of them and they hate us.&nbsp; Isn't it bad enough that they complain about us having offices?&nbsp; Now they have to bring our telecommuting rules into this?    Boss: &nbsp; We have offices because we're attorneys.&nbsp; And I never said that you had to give up anything.    Colleague: &nbsp; You're right I'm an attorney!&nbsp; If they want an office and more telecommuting privileges, then they should get off their lazy asses and go to school.&nbsp; I spent a lot of money on my law school education.&nbsp; I earned my office.&nbsp; If they want an office then they can do the same.&nbsp; Why should I have to jump more hoops because they're too stupid and lazy to stay in school.Guess who wins the pompous ass award. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;     There was a great article in the ABA Journal about this type of blue collar/white collar divide, and how attorneys from blue collar backgrounds are often more disadvantaged in the legal workplace than women and minorities.&nbsp; (The argument being that there are mechanisms and a certain level of awareness in place to counteract racial and gender discrimination, but nothing that highlights the obstacles attorneys face when raised in a blue collar family, but now find themselves operating in a more "cultured" white-collar world).&nbsp; Anyhow, this is illustrative of&nbsp;how a lot of people in my profession feel, and, I think, how a lot of "intellectual snobs" outside my profession feel.   Did I want to write about that?&nbsp; I just don't remember....

      I jotted some notes down for  The Novel &nbsp;last night - just some random sketches on social structure and such.&nbsp; I'm toying with the idea of having two protagonists with parallel story lines, although that may prove prohibitively complicated for my feeble mind.&nbsp; I've also been intrigued by the Nick Carraway/second-person narrator, so I'll have to think about which makes more sense for my non-existent story.&nbsp; I do like the idea of revealing some of the sci-fi elements gradually, though (if for no other reason than I don't really want to delve too far into the world of geekdom). &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I also worked on a little mix CD to help me get in the mood for the book - whatever space- or robot-themed song I could find in the collection.&nbsp; Turns out that my vision of the future is full of distorted electric guitars and drum machines.&nbsp; Who knew.  &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Little Room - The White Stripes  2.&nbsp; Ziggy Stardust - David Bowie  3.&nbsp; So Far I Have Not Found the Science - Soul Coughing  4.&nbsp; 19-2000 - Gorillaz  5.&nbsp; Intergalactic - Beastie Boys  6.&nbsp; Space Rock - Weezer  7.&nbsp; Rocket - Smashing Pumpkins  8.&nbsp; Destination Ursa Major - Superdrag  9.&nbsp; Y Control - Yeah Yeah Yeahs  10.&nbsp; Starside - Spacehog  11.&nbsp; Tomorrow - Rivers Cuomo  12.&nbsp; What It Feels Like for a Girl - Madonna  13.&nbsp; The Scientist - Coldplay  14.&nbsp; One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21 - The Flaming Lips  15.&nbsp; Down on the River by the Sugar Plant - Mike Doughty  16.&nbsp; Mysterons - Portishead  17.&nbsp; Paranoid Android - Radiohead  18.&nbsp; Gorecki - Lamb  19.&nbsp; 4 - Aphex Twin

      After months of&nbsp; procrastinating, I finally started   The No   vel  last night.&nbsp; I use the word "started" very loosely - it's more like I sketched out a few broad themes that&nbsp;I still need to develop more fully.&nbsp; I have no hero, no antagonist, no plot, no overall moral lesson.&nbsp; But I do have some parameters to contain&nbsp;the story and a general idea of the world I'm hoping to create. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm aiming for more of a novella than a full-blown novel.&nbsp; Maybe a serialized... uh... serial.&nbsp; The big problem is that it's a bit sci-fi-ey, and I am NOT a sci-fi kinda girl.&nbsp; So I have a lot of research ahead of me.&nbsp; It should&nbsp; be interesting. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  My friend Melisa gave me this Happy Bunny notebook yesterday that says "boys lie and kind of stink" on the front.&nbsp; For some reason it totally inspired me.&nbsp; I'm also pretty nervous about the whole undertaking because it's been so long since I've done any creative writing.&nbsp; Not sure if my imagination has had enough practice in recent years to make this whole thing even remotely successful.&nbsp; I may have to pull a Fitzgerald a write a bunch of short stories first.&nbsp;  Ir regardless, wish me luck.

      9 AM:  Woke up when Boyfriend got up to get ready for golf.  Suprisingly not hungover, but took two Advil anyway.  9:30ish:  Turned on TV.  While flipping, saw some Kenneth Branaugh and Emma Thompson movie.  Stopped to watch -  urlLink  Dead Again   on the Sci Fi Channel.  11 AM:  Next Sci Fi movie -  urlLink  Life in a Day  . Boy genius develops drug that rapidly ages subject. Illegal human testing creates Jasmine, the amazing super baby. Baby grows up in a matter of hours. Adult baby and boy genius fall in love. Sadly, no cure for rapid aging can be found and Jasmine dies next day. Evil dean of Concord University goes to jail. Kat develops minor crush on Michael Goorjian.  Noon:  Made cheddar cheese scrambled eggs.  Watered herbs.  1 PM:  Took shower.  Missed the beginning of  urlLink  The Last Man on Planet Earth  .  1:30 PM: Folded laundry. Tried to catch up on movie - all the men on the planet die of a Y-chromosome degenerative disease. Society composed entirely of women, and is therefore totally peaceful. 4th year grad student genetically engineers kinder, gentler man with piercingly blue eyes (natch). Since this is illegal, grad student and man go on the run. Genetically engineered man and 4th year grad student fall in love. Man contracts disease and dies. Grad student gets pregnant, and it's a boy. Movie is stupid, but makes me look forward to a world without men and their lack of cleaning and organizing skills.  2:20 PM:  Wondered when this movie will end.  Decided to rifle through the kitchen for some grub.  2:48 PM:  Decided to put on some pants.  3 PM:    urlLink The Darwin Conspiracy .  Is it a movie, or is it a documentary? National Security Agency hires Mr. Doc and Miss Doc to reanimate super DNA found in Paleolithic Ice Man. Mr. Doc develops serum that Evil Government Agent steals and injects in monkey and retarded brother of Mr. Doc. Monkey types "I want a banana damn it!" Retarded brother becomes telekinetic MLB player. Evil Government Agent burns down lab, Mr. Doc and Miss Doc fall in love, retarded brother inexplicably doesn't die like all of the lab rats. Kat comes to the realization that voiceovers are annoying; Boyfriend comes home from golf.  4:45 PM:  Boyfriend ordered us up a couple noodle soups from Full Kee.  5 PM:   urlLink Brave New World ? Not really. Half way through re-reading the novel, so was excited to see a film version. Was confused, disappointed, surprised, ultimately satisfied.  7 PM:  Got sick of bad sci fi movies.  Posted blog.

       urlLink Rivers @ Myspace.com    Sigh... so cute.  I remember seeing Weezer at the House of Blues in New Orleans, just after Pinkerton came out and ... well, whatever.  Not only was it an awesome show, but afterward, as the crowd was thinning out, who should be wandering around by himself in his old-man cardigan than the man himself.  Wish I could say that I said something brilliant and witty, but I think I just shoved my ticket stub at him or something moronic.  Oh well.  I was a freshman in college.  Everything I did back then was moronic.

      I first saw  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone  when it debuted on HBO.  I was home from school for a week with a nasty flu.  Since the movie seemed to be in constant rotation, I just had it on TV perpetually while I drifted in and out of sleep.  Not a very mentally taxing movie, soothing music... it was really just what I needed.  Unfortunately, since then, I cannot watch it without becoming very sleepy.  A total Pavlovian response.  It's so bad, in fact, that when Seth and I recently went to see  Azkaban , he kept leaning over and warning me not to fall asleep.  So, last night, we finally sat down to watch  Wizard People, Dear Reader .  And within 20 minutes, I had to go to bed!!  It was 9:30, people!!

      So, I sorta used to be known for my mix tapes.  Then the motor on my tape deck started slowing down and everything started sounding like The Bizarro Chipmunks.  Then I started law school.  Then I finally got a CD burner.  Now I finally have the time to start back up again, digitally remastered.  I made my friends this Mix CD (the lastest in a series of summer mixes beginning in Y2K), and David seems to really like it.  Thought I'd share.  1.  Fight Test - The Flaming Lips 2.  Bodhisattva Vow - Beastie Boys 3.  Get Over It - OK Go 4.  Rock Your Body - Justin Timberlake 5.  4 - Aphex Twin 6.  Maps - Yeah Yeah Yeahs 7.  True Dreams of Wichita - Soul Coughing 8.  La Cienega Just Smiled - Ryan Adams 9.  Feel - Robbie Williams 10.  Lonely Day - Phantom Planet 11.  Papillon - The Twilight Singers 12.  Ester - Elefant 13.  Kissing the Lipless - The Shins 14.  27 Jennifers - Mike Doughty 15.  Rolling - Better Than Ezra 16.  Birdhouse in Your Soul - They Might Be Giants 17.  Lola Stars and Stripes - The Stills 18.  Bleed American - Jimmy Eat World 19.  The Dark of the Matinee - Franz Ferdinand 20.  There Is a Light That Never Goes Out - The Smiths  If I ever start a band, I'm gonna name it "The  Something " because that's the indie thing to do.

      Weird little old ladies, that is.&nbsp; Mine is named Jackie.&nbsp; Over the last couple months, she has&nbsp;decided that I am the nicest person ever.&nbsp; I think she would change her mind about that if she knew how&nbsp;strange I think she is, and how she just creeps me out sometimes.   She's small.&nbsp; Well, I'm small, so I guess it's more accurate to call her tiny.&nbsp; I'd be surprised if she was 5'.&nbsp; She has one of those short men's haircuts that women seem to uniformly get in their late middle ages (and one that I accidentally got a few years ago - it's petty, I know, but I ran out of the salon and straight to my boyfriend's place where I cried all night).&nbsp; Her hair is salt and pepper gray, which oddly gives it a midnight bluish tint.&nbsp; Either she's very tan, or she wears a foundation that is several shades too dark.&nbsp; She always wears a thick layer of makeup, which is never thick enough to cover up the long hairs of her mustache or the rather large, rather dark mole on her upper lip.   Jackie lives a very regimented life.&nbsp; If she doesn't arrive at work at precisely the right minute, or leave for the day exactly at 4:25, it "ruins the rest of her night."&nbsp; She's worked in this same office for close to 30 years, and her position has become somewhat obsolete over that time period.&nbsp; I don't know what she used to do, but now her main duties consist of sorting the mail and walking around to everyone's office to see if they have work for her to do.   I could write an entire blog on the bizarre conversations that we have&nbsp;- but for now, I'll start with the story of one of our first meetings.&nbsp; I had only been with the agency for a couple of weeks.&nbsp; I was still learning the ropes, it was around the holidays when everyone was on vacation, and I barely had anything to do.    Jackie :&nbsp; Do you have any work for me, Kathleen?    Kathy :&nbsp; No, sorry.&nbsp; I don't really even have work that I can do yet.    Jackie :&nbsp; Well, I can file things, and make copies, and put things in order.&nbsp; If you have anything like that.&nbsp; I know how to put things in order by letter, if you like that.&nbsp; Or if you want them put in order by, like... number or anything, I can do that.    Kathy :&nbsp; Sorry, Jackie.&nbsp; I really don't have anything.    Jackie :&nbsp; You don't trust me?&nbsp; You don't think I can do a good job?&nbsp; I did work for Ken this morning - you can go and ask him and he'll tell you that I did a good job.    Kathy :&nbsp; I'm sure you do good work - I just don't have anything right now.    Jackie :&nbsp; Someday you will.&nbsp; Then you'll see.   She has a deep voice, and pauses awkwardly in between words as if she's struggling for breath.&nbsp; And she stares.&nbsp; Silently.&nbsp; Yesterday she stood outside my office door and just stared at me for five minutes.&nbsp; Very creepy.

      So much to blog, so little time.&nbsp; (Actually, I shouldn't say that - don't want to get anyone's hopes up for something interesting.)&nbsp; One meeting down, my   VERY FIRST HEARING  to go.&nbsp; Just hope my Godiva champagne truffle (that's right - chocolate for lunch, baby!) will hold me over for the next few hours.&nbsp; Wish me buena suerte.&nbsp; That's Spanish.&nbsp; As far as I can remember.

      My boyfriend has a serious man-crush on    urlLink  Alex Kapranos  . I had my suspicions at the show, but after watching our TiVo'ed  Backstage Pass  last night (in which I figure prominently as "Bouncing Yellow Dot #20"), my suspicions have been confirmed.  In related news, my best friend from college is Matthew Broderick's new neighbor. Which makes the  urlLink  Ferris Bueller   stalking ever so much easier.

      Ugh - so I hated my blog, and I hated my template, so it's time for a change.&nbsp; I think this will do.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Thought of the day.&nbsp; When I moved in with my boyfriend&nbsp;out in&nbsp;dreaded suburbia, everything I owned went into storage.&nbsp; Two and a half years spent in forced isolation, separated from all of my worldly possessions.&nbsp; My poor&nbsp;babies missed me terribly, I think (I sure missed seeing something that was actually  mine ).&nbsp; Now that I'm finally back in the city, my storage unit is cleared out, and my bookshelves are once again overflowing with books that I haven't seen in a long time.&nbsp; And I want to re-read them all  NOW .&nbsp; Right away.&nbsp; All at the same time.  &nbsp;  But I can't, so I'm starting with  A Confederacy of Dunces .&nbsp; I seem to recall thinking it was overrated, but I'm several years removed from New Orleans now (my God, has it been that long?)&nbsp;so I think the nostalgia will do me good.

      Yes, I know this is old news, but the breakup of  Dweezil Zappa and Lisa Loeb    has got me thinking (a very dangerous activity, indeed).&nbsp; What makes people who have been in seriously long-term relationships break up?&nbsp; When you've been with someone for 5, 10, 15 years, what makes you decide that today is the day to part? &nbsp; Having never been in such a relationship, I tend to think two things: (1) once the decision is made, it's probably pretty easy to let go - chances are you've been doing that for a long time anyway; and (2) moving really sucks.&nbsp; I've only ever&nbsp;done the breaking up once, and I wanted to accompany&nbsp;it with a punch in the face, so I guess the whole concept is pretty foreign to me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Oh, and just so you know, I'm not really a violent person.&nbsp; I broke up with the guy because he was...&nbsp;uh... just a little too "in" to me - calling me at all hours while he was in the middle of class, in the bio lab, out for a run - crying because he hadn't talked to me in like 3 hours and clearly I didn't love him as much as he loved me (which, to his credit, was apparently true).&nbsp; (Oh, and guys: no matter what those stupid romantic comedies tell you, girls hate sissy boys who cry).&nbsp; So anyway, when I finally said that I thought our being together wasn't really going to work out, he said, out of the blue,&nbsp;"you really have a lot of unresolved issues with your father, don't you?"&nbsp; As if we were breaking up because of  my  psychological problems and not his borderline-stalker obsessions.&nbsp; That's where the face-punching comes in.  &nbsp;  So in that particular situation, I totally understand why people break up.&nbsp; But hopefully that would happen within the first few months of a relationship.&nbsp; What takes you the better part of a decade to discover about another person?

      ... she said: "I had a really great time."   Went to a very early pre-theatre dinner (who on earth is hungry at 5:30?). It was soooo good, but also very expensive I'm afraid. Started with a lovely ice-cold Grey Goose martini (with olives, thank you very much). Skipped the appetizer and went straight for the entree - perfectly seared scallops with haricot verts, chorizo, and a very lightly flavored curry sauce. Yummy. For dessert I had a glass of sparkling dessert wine, which was unlike any I'd ever had. It was a dark burgundy in color, but very crisp and bubbly. Paired perfectly with the chocolate mousse with roasted orange and vanilla sauce. But I guess this shouldn't come as a surprise since, apparently, this restaurant was written up in July's issue of  Food &amp; Wine  as having one of the top 10 wine lists in the country. Or something.   Then we headed over to the Kennedy Center to see  The Producers . So very funny. Alan Ruck, better known as the guy who played Cameron in  Ferris Bueller's Day Off , played Matthew Broderick's role. And for a girl who used to want to marry Ferris Bueller when she grew up, that was certainly a guilty pleasure. The show was great, and I got home to find . . . my brand new couch! After waiting for the thing for nearly two months, it is certainly a clownish sight to behold. Why I chose such a silly fabric for the uphostery is beyond me - all I know is that it suits me perfectly.   So yeah, had a great day. Spent an hour at the pool this morning, then splattered my grilled cheese sammy on the kitchen floor. Jury's still out on today.

      ... but I guess today is as good as any to take a little inventory.  (The beginning of this post has been removed to protect the innoceent from reading a bunch of drivel).  I'm 26 today.  What do I have to show for myself?  1 Queen-sized bedframe and 2 nightstands.  1 giant cherry dresser.  1 Mission-style chair and matching side table.  Crappy Office Depot desk.  Temperamental Dell laptop.  2 lamps, one of them taken from a scrap pile in the hallway of my old apartment building.  1 VCR.  4 DVDs, 15 or so VHS tapes.  Box o' cassettes.  Ass-load of CDs.  A gazillion books.  Temperamental APS camera.  Shoebox full of photos.  That painting of the animals I got in the Dominican Republic.  1 set of very nice Calphalon cookware.  1 shiny cast metal Cuisinart mini-prep.  1 Peter Pan coffee mug.  5 suits (two of which no longer fit).  Couple pairs of jeans.  Some cool t-shirts.  1 Dan Marino jersey.  Lots of cute sneakers.  Ratty old backpack.  1 strand of pearls and matching earrings.  1 Tiffany sterling silver necklace.  1 Mignot Faget sterling silver Newcomb College ring.  1 pair cheap metal star-shaped stud earrings (which I love, and actually had a plumber come up and fish out of a drain for me recently in a Dallas hotel room).  Up-to-date passport (which I guess is technically property of the U.S. Government).  Couple beers in the fridge.  A pound or two of extra junk in the trunk.  Short attention span, fear of commitment.  Now what?  I never make New Year's resolutions, so it seems pretty artificial to do so today.  But I will do two things and try to do another.  I will finish  Great Expectations  tomorrow.  I will stop talking about the Weez in this blog.  And I'll try to tap into a few more of my connections for Luke's band.  Aside from that, no promises.  So, when I was in high school and college, I used to do very strange things.  Like whenever I saw a particularly large cardboard box, I would climb into it for no apparent reason.  Or whenever I put a load of laundry in the machine, I would walk back to my dorm room with my empty laundry basket on my head.  (Come to think of it, I would put just about anything on my head and walk around for a bit.)  Or I would randomly pirouette across the living room if I was just passing through.  Well, last time I was in Florida visiting my mum, I flipped through a bunch of old photo albums.  Guess what I saw: a two-year-old Kat sitting in an empty box.  And a three-year-old Kat with an empty bucket on her head.  And a five-year-old Kat with a soup bowl on her head.  I am seriously fucked up.  Happy birthday!  Oh, and staying up until midnight is hard when you're not drinking!

      I made hummus from scratch for the first time tonight, and I learned three things: (1) No need to waste my time using dried chickpeas (would've saved myself a couple hours there), (2) Need more lemons!, (what's up with that goofy punctuation?) and (3) I need a bigger food processor.  Why did I decide to pursue public interest law again?  Man, if I went into private practice I could be making three times as much... then I could afford that food processor.  And a car.  And those Cure tickets.  Oh yeah - and last night I reaffirmed the fact that Octopussy is my favorite Bond movie.  It owns For Your Eyes Only.

      I read recently something to the effect of "I wonder if Canadians get sick of Americans idealizing their country so much."  And I can't remember where.  Does anyone know whether the weeks approaching one's 26th birthday are typically the age at which short-term memory loss sets in?  To make matters worse, I don't even know why I brought that up.  But I do know that I am buying Elefant tickets tonight and I couldn't be happier.  I haven't been to a show since Franz Ferdinand a few weeks back, and I'm getting all antsy.  Of course, that show isn't until August so I'll still have to find something to occupy my time - maybe The Mooney Suzuki next Friday?  I must have listened to Maladroit 6 times today.  I'm such a dork.

      So I've been in the new apartment for a month now, but I don't really feel settled yet.  True, the couch hasn't arrived and there are still a few boxes o' crap in the bedroom that I have to figure out what to do with, but that's not really the problem.  I think the problem is that I have yet to do any real cooking there.  I've made some meals, but nothing very complicated or particularly yummy.  No whole roasted chickens, no corn souffle, no shrimp and grits.  I did bake cookies on the 4th, but I felt very ill-prepared and was unhappy with my icing results.  I think what I need to do is rent a car and drive to the grocery, where I can stock up on all kinds of exotic ingredients that I can't find on Peapod.  I need to pick up tons of fresh fruits and veggies, thick-cut pork chops and veggie burgers for the grill, all kinds of smelly and non-smelly cheeses.  I want to make a wild mushroom risotto.  I want to make some spanakopita and tyropita.  I want to make a whole mess of mushy peas.  I want to bake some freaking cupcakes!   Speaking of Peapod, I bought a loaf of Pepperidge Farm rye bread last week, because they don't carry the Arnold seeded rye.  Not too big of a deal, right?  Wrong.  This bread makes toast with the weirdest consistency.  I can't even explain - it's sort of like toast, you know, crunchy and crumby and warm and all that, but it's also sort of dry-wally.  I'm a bit obsessed with rye toast, but this was just... dodgy.  I've also been obsessively keeping track of how many glasses of water I've been drinking per day.  I'm talking tally marks on post-it notes and everything.  Summer in DC comes with smog and high quantities of ground-level ozone, so I've been trying to protect myself from toxins as much as possible.  Which also means lots of yummy berries from the farmers' market.  Eat your berries, kids - they're good for you!

      I'm very cranky and uncomfortable today.  How does that differ from my usual mood?  It's all strangely internal.  I feel internally cranky and uncomfortable.  Somehow that makes me a much friendlier co-worker - go figure.  I guess I just feel so bad today that I don't want to inflict it upon anyone else; that would be too cruel.  Bill Clinton is signing books today at the Barnes & Noble across the street from where I work.  It turns out that all those people I saw as I was leaving work yesterday were actually the people who wanted to be first in line.  This morning the line had grown three blocks long.  Lots of fat tourists in shorts and smug expressions, looking at passers-by with an air of superiority (as in, "bet you wish you got here a little earlier, huh?" as if all of us walking by weren't... oh, I don't know... going to work?!?!).  Bet they're not so smug now in the 90+ degree heat and 90+% humidity.  People make me sad sometimes.    The only thing I would camp out for would probably be Weezer tix.  And they'd have to be front row.  Lucky me, all the other bands I like are obscure enough that camping out never has to be considered :)  Oh wait - there were those Beastie Boys tickets I made everyone I know try to tag-team the online pre-sale a couple weeks ago.  But that was the middle of the afternoon, and camping would get none of us anywhere - except maybe mosquito-bitten.  I make me sad sometimes.

      So I saw the Spankin' New video for the Dashboard while I was drinking my morning coffee today.  I said it when I saw them live, and I'll say it again: worst. band. ever.  Ever!  I don't care why that guy keeps screaming, and I don't care why all of his girlfriends don't understand him, and I don't care how he cries himself to sleep every night.  All I care about is the blood dripping from my ears because his music is making them tear themselves away from my head in an effort to escape the lame guitar and the lame "rock" and the lame faux-emotion.  And the lame run-on sentences.

      Whatever that means.  But anyway, it's official:  urlLink  Jackie   is crazy.  She was walking by my office and caught me mid-yawn.  Which is apparently an open invitation to come into my office and stand very, very close to me.  Like on my side of the desk close to me.  (In case you haven't heard, I like my  urlLink personal space .)  She is soooo happy that I'm wearing my hair up today.  Apparently I look "younger and prettier" with my hair up.  Because I'm usually old and ugly looking?  And then she asked if she looks better today.  "Why?  Did you get your hair done?"  "No.  I ran into a wall over the weekend.  I feel like a man threw me against a wall or something.  You can't see it because of my make up, but do you know what  maroon  is?  Well, under my eyes is maroon.  And my side hurts here.  And my knee is red.  It doesn't hurt, but when I kneel down it really hurts.  So I have to be careful when I'm getting into bed.  I can't just climb into bed, I have to sit on it and swing my leg over ( lifting her leg up dangerously close to my head ).  I got the swelling on my face to go down with ice.  You know, ice.  But I've had to give up hugs.  That's really the worst part.  Every time I see someone coming near me to give me a hug I have to take a quick step out of the way.  I don't know if my bones are broken.  I think if they were, I wouldn't be able to move, but I don't know how strong they are right now, so I have to give up hugs."   And this is when I figured out that when she said she "ran into a wall," she didn't mean "with her car."  "God saved me.  I was alone, and who knows what would have happened.  I must have turned around in the dark and hit a door or something.  This is why I can't drive a car.  I'm afraid of what would happen if I got disoriented while I was driving."   And this is when I started feeling really bad about this blog.  "You know, people have been really nice to me.  They weren't always nice to me.  Even when I was in school, as soon as someone found out about my problem, they would tell all the other kids not to be friends with me.  And before I came to EPA, people would find out about it and stop talking to me.  But here, this is really the first time I've had any friends.  That's why I appreciate you so much.  You're always so understanding."   And then she stood there, 12 inches from my face, and stared at me.  For a full 90 seconds.  I stopped feeling bad.

      My IM doesn't work anymore.  First it booted off everyone who tried to IM me.  Now it won't even let me sign on.  I've tried restarting.  I've tried reinstalling.  I have to face the long day alone.  With a headache.  This is going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.

      A hard, horrible, wrath of God rain.  A forty days and forty nights rain.  I get off the escalator and see the crowd huddled under the overhang for shelter. I join them. Five minutes go by, and I start pacing. The rain just isn't letting up. Fuck it. I live two long blocks away. If I get wet, I get wet.  I roll my pant legs up to my knees, open my umbrella, and set off. Fuck. One of the arms of my umbrella is broken - that side is hanging limply. Don't worry, big guy. It happens to all umbrellas. I love you anyway. I'll just make sure that side is always behind me, so the water won't flow onto my feet. There... that's not so bad. Look, we've made it a block. Let's cross here with the light.  So far so good. OK, walk signal. Oh shit - there's an ambulance coming. Can I make it across before it gets here? I don't want to wait, in case I miss the light. Oh - that guy's crossing. Guess I can too. OK, hop over that... raging river? Shit! That current is fast. Shit! That shit is deep. Fuck, that fucking current took my shoe. Gotta get to it before it goes down the storm sewer... caught it. Phew, disaster averted. But my pant leg unrolled. Oh well, let's put the shoe back on and cross already. Lucky for me the ambulance went by and the light still says walk.  Fuck! There goes my other shoe. God damn motherfucking JCrew fucking flip flops. Got it. Fuck! The other fucking shoe came off again. Fuck this - just grab your motherfucking shoes and cross the motherfucking street. Eww... walking on DC streets without shoes on. Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross.  OK. Put on your damn shoes. Fuck. Both pant legs unrolled. OK. Try to roll them back up. Man, it's wet. Stupid umbrella. Maybe if I try to prop this broken side up on this pay phone... fuck. This isn't going to work. Fuck it - your pants are already soaking wet up to your thighs. Let's get on with it already.  "Hi!  Sure is wet out here.  No thanks, I don't need any help."   Man, I must look a mess.  Even the homeless people are shaking their heads at me in sympathy.  "Hello.  No, I don't need a ride.  I'm already soaking wet you see.  But thanks for pulling up to ask!"  "Hi there.   Laughing.   Lovely day for a stroll, isn't it?  No thanks.  I don't need any help - I live just there."

      So the guy who empties my trash can at work just leaned in my door and said, "Excuse me."  I looked up from the very important instant message I was writing.  Then he said, "you don't happen to have 25 cents, do you?  Because  mumble, mumble.... "   I opened my desk drawer, pulled out two dimes and a nickle, put it on the desk and said "Sure."  He shuffled his feet.  "You didn't hear what I said, did you?"  "No, what was it?"  "I said, 'Do you happen to have 25 cents.  I need it because my momma told me to call her when I met an angel.'"

      The first time I told  urlLink  Jackie   that I anticipated having work for her to do soon, I think I almost killed her. It was a Friday afternoon when she came wandering into my office looking for work to do (that's her specialty - wandering. She wanders in and out of cubicles and offices all day long). I was working on a big case (for me anyway), and I was going to need five copies of my brief and its corresponding twelve exhibits. It was a stack of about 50 pages, some stapled, some tabbed with post-its. There was a yellow sheet sitting on top of the pile, which gets initialed by each reader as it goes up the chain of review.  I proudly showed her what I had done, and with my most self-congratulatory tone, told her that as soon as I got the OK from my boss, I would need her to make a few copies for me. And then she freaked.    Jackie : I can't copy yellow pages. Yellow doesn't show up in the copy machine - it just makes all the pages white.   K : No, no... that's OK. That page isn't part of the brief.   Jackie : Because I don't want to break the machine, you know? I don't know what's going to happen if I put in a yellow page. I don't want to turn all of the pages yellow.   K : Don't worry, I don't need copies of the yellow page. Just the rest here. All of those pages are white.   Jackie : Some of these pages are stapled. Are they going to be stapled when you give this to me? Because I can only put one page in the machine at a time, and if they're stapled, then I'm going to have to take out all the staples and then make the copies. Then I'm going to have to staple them together again, and I'm not sure if I can get the metal to go back through the same holes. It's going to be a lot more work for me.   K : It's OK - I'll take all the staples out before I give this to you. Then you won't even have to worry about it.   Jackie : What about these tabs? The machine only makes rectangular pages. I can't make it put out any tabs.   K : You can take off the tabs before you put it in the copier. They're just post-it flags.   Jackie : Oh, no. That's going to be so much work. I don't want to lose the tabs. What happens if I get everything out of order?   K : I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll remove all the staples and flags, put the whole thing in a three-ring binder like this, and then you can just take that stack out and put the whole thing in the copier.   Jackie : Where am I going to get binders? And I don't think the machine punches holes in the paper.   K : It does, but that's OK because I don't need holes. You can just give me the stacks of copies and I'll take care of everything else.   Jackie : How many copies are you going to need?   K : Five.   Jackie : Oh no! How am I going to do that? Now I'll be worried about this all weekend. I'm going to have to plan out the best way to do this. Uhhh - now I'll worry all weekend.   K : (getting totally exasperated at this point) No, no, no... don't worry about it! It'll be easy. You don't have to get it perfect.   Jackie : Well, we'll see. (Wanders out muttering to herself.)  Needless to say, I did the damn thing myself.

      The weather in DC over the last few days can only be adequately summed up by  Frank the Tank  in  Old School . "I saw Blue. He's  glorious !" Blue skies, cool temperatures, and gentle breezes. I had my freaking windows open all weekend. And it's August!  I guess the weather inspired me to be amazingly productive. I was commissioned to do two photography projects by friends, both of which I tackled on Saturday. I spent the morning and afternoon on Andrew's art piece. He wanted some black and white prints for his apartment, and since he likes John Wayne movies so much, I thought I would do a study of equestrian statues in the District. I took about 18 pictures of 6 statues before the miles of walking caught up to me. I still have a few shots to get, so I hope the weather cooperates next weekend. Saturday night I tested out the new/old digital camera at the  Cartel    show. Since everyone in the crowd also had digital cameras out, I figured that everyone in the band asked everyone in the world to take pics that night. So, it gave me an opportunity to practice some indie-rock photography techniques without feeling guilty. Now all I have to do is figure out how to get the pictures from my camera to my computer.  I also got good and drunk on Saturday night. That was fun. Although I told Luke that he ruined my blog. Which I think he did. Add to that Seth's spy-guy antics and I'm really feeling sort of hostile to this whole thing. I think it has quickly lost its point. If I ever had a point to begin with. Now I need to decide what I'm going to do with this thing.  Woke up bright and early Sunday morning. Decided to spend the entire day doing research for   The Novel  . That was fun. I didn't wear pants for most of the day. So yeah, productive weekend, which ultimately depresses me because it brings to the forefront how fun my life used to be and how boring it now is. Now I need to decide what I'm going to do with that thing too.

      I was starting to rest a little easier because I've gone two whole days without an awkward  urlLink  Jackie  -in-my-office conversation. But then I just ran into her in the restroom. She's wearing less makeup today, making her look like your average older woman. And I noticed three new oddities:  1. She has no compunction with trying to hold a conversation with someone while they've got a mouth full of foamy toothpaste;  2. She wanders in and out of bathroom stalls for a good three minutes before her bladder forces her to make a decision already; and  3. She uses an ungodly amount of paper towels when she dries her hands.  But I do have to say this: she is admirably hygienic. She washes her hands both  before  and  after  using the toilet. We should all be so clean.

      Back from the Jersey Shore.  It's the new Hamptons, you know. Not really.  I learned two very important things this weekend - I totally suck at putt putt, but I rule skee ball.  I dare you to challenge my skee ball supremacy.  The weather was great, and as a result my skin is mildly sunburned.  But my brain is majorly sunburned.  I totally forgot my ID badge on this first day of  Code Orange .  That meant major headache and embarrassment, what with the calling of every single person in EPA to vouch for my identity.  Now everyone knows I'm an idiot.  I do have to say this, for the first time in my life:  I am so glad that I'm not in school anymore.  My law school is NEXT DOOR to the World Bank and IMF buildings.  So, if the WB and IMF blows up, The George Washington University Law School blows up.  And I'm a safe 7 blocks away.  Wait... that's a safe distance, right?
