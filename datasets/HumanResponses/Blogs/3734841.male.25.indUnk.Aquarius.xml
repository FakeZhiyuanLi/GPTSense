      Being part of the PJ gang in my office, my primary fun in office is to have PJs with others.  what is PJ? PJ is the acronym of Poor Joke. People categorize a joke as PJ, when they cant understand it or when they can't or dont want to appriciate the humor sense in that. So it is relative to people. You need to be in certain wavelengths to apprieciate it (PJ of a software professional may be a nuisance for others) . And you need a wild humour sense and little bit of madness to appreciate it. And there are theories why it called Poor Joke but not Bad Joke. One of them is Bad Joke refers to some Bad Job when it is acronymed :-p.  Birth of PJ, PJs are not born as PJs. They born as joke or they are tried as jokes,  when people cant understand it easily(ie when the joke is poor), they start calling that as PJ (Remember that he / she appreciates it later). For an example, if a humorous guy wants the ambience to be happy, he starts telling joke to others. First he tries by telling some joke which are understandable by everyone. Once he was appreciated for them, he starts trying with little complex jokes, which are not easy to understand. People starts calling them as PJs. And that guys is called as PJer and then on whatever he tries as joke even the good one also , people starts calling them as PJ (kinda reputation).  PJing and me, I started PJing since my college days. I still remember my first PJ. One day, we went to beach and one of my friend went to the water and came back fully drenched. Nobody asked for the reason, but he told that waves were too big and thats why he got drenched. And i suddenly replied that ya ya, we know that you didn't fall down. People laughed for that, and that was the start of my PJs. I wasn't wild in my college days. In my office also i used to be normal. But, once we formed a gang and people started appreciating or encouraging my initial PJs, the level of PJing became wild. And these days it is unstoppable. These days our gang is known as "PJ gang" in the office and everyone PJs alot.  PJs are helpful for me these days to get away or atleast to hide my bad moods and to relax during a week days (Dilbert's principle).  My recent PJ (only for s/w professionals): I saw a dead fish floating in a fish tank and told, "FloatingPointError occured for that fish" ;-p.

       Yesterady me and my friend&nbsp;Mayur desperately needed food at 12:30am. If it is anna university we had that munna shop which is open around the clock.&nbsp; In hyderabad we didnt have any such places where we get good hot food in the late night. We had a place called convenio, where we get some cold food. But thanks to Mr. Y.S.Rajsekara Reddy, that also closes by 11pm.&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;   We got into my Benz(Of course M800) and we started&nbsp; driving on SP road (the road which follows me ever since my college days. &nbsp;Sardar Patel Road.. ).&nbsp; Our first target was Railway station, which is 8-10kms away from my office. The previous day at the same time, we were generally roaming around and found a shop near Railway station where we get bread-omlets (We found it using a strategic plan. we thought there might be some trains which arrives at midnight and we had faith on our Indian Railways, and hence at least some vendors must be there inside the station).&nbsp;       &nbsp;   It was slightly drizzling and SP road was without any traffic. It is fun to drive late in the night. You could notice, policeman searching for some random business people for bribes,&nbsp; poor Corporation workers cleaning the road, Bikes and Cars racing each other and going at just 90kmp. While you watch these, some heavy trucks coming in wrong direction head to kill you. It is a thrill to drive late in the night.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   On the way while going over some flyover we suddenly chenged our plan and decided to check out Pasadise(Hyderabadi famous). We reachced&nbsp;the shop. But the shop was closed.&nbsp;We stopped the vehicle near the shop to discuss about the next target. After few mins, a security who was standing next to the shop came closer to the car and told that the parcel shop is open at the back side. Yeah! finally we are found a place to get some food.&nbsp;We parked the car and went inside the building through to the back door. People were cleaning the culinary vessels we have to jump here and there to reach the counter. Another guy at the counter told that if you need parcel stay here or get inside. oh! the hotel is still open. We went in. Something around 10-12 people were eating inside. Wow! finally we found the place to eat at 1am. We had a great Chicken Biriyani and then we asked the shop keeper when will it be closed. We didnt get the answer. He said it is going to be closed. We want to check out till what time will it be open on someother day (probably at 2am in the morning).     &nbsp;   Do people know any other places in hyd where we get some interesting food in the midnight?
