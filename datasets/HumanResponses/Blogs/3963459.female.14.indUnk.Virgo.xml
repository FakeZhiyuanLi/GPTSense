       Dear Journal,   Today was ok. I was thinking about Leah and Roger alot though. I also thought about how Jordan was doing with her foot. Sarah also popped into my head a couple times... but anyways. Roger Roger Roger... i love him so much. LOL. Ok enough about him. I shaved my side burns a while ago and that was a stupid idea and my sister JUST noticed them today and she's like "oh, dude you shaved your side burns?" and i said ".......yah" than she said "now i have to shave them again and you have to keep shaving them or else they'll grow in so thick!" and i said "oh great shave em then." Ya leave it up to me eh.  So I've been going out with Roger for about 2 weeks now... and ya, he's so adorable. I MISS LEAH AND SARAH! boooooo! anyways ya thats it for today. I'll write more later. peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xKarliEx

       hey,   its a new day today. My day as always went the same way.. i wake up, go on the computer, talk to people, etc. OH! But sumthing big happened today, ShortY called me today at like 1:10pm.. lol. I like it when he phones me. He's so adorable. He told me he liked me and stuff, and he asked me out, but i never answered him yet, i think it will be a yes though. He doesnt care if he's in a different city, he says he will be nice to me and after wut Roger did he thinks i need sum1 to care for me. So yea lol. Roger cheated on me. He got drunk and this slut named Melissa took advantage of him and if you haven't figured the rest out your stupid. I'm bored. I think ShortY can't check his emails, i think he has that thing were he still has to click the free thingy.. so thats why he cant get my emailz. I sent him so many! LOL. Sum1's out side banging on sumthing and its annoying me.. not scarry and usually things like that scare me.. but its just annoying. Ahh well. ShortY will probably phone me tomorrow.. well 2day now lol. He should really learn to come on msn. He's got soo many friends that he's always outside with them. It kinda bugs me. Seeing as it coast money for phoning but he cant go on msn. Ahh well. i'm out for 2day. PEACE. xKarliEx
