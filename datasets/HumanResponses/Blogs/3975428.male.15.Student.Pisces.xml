        3 Things:      * I saw "the Village" Let's just say... actually, I don't know what to say about it! Good (story wise)/ bad (if you had high expectations on how scary it would be) Only watch it if you like a movie with a good story, love/romance, comedy, thriller, adventure, costumes, drama,  serious talking , and skinned animals!   *  God works in mysterious ways...  last night, he got me a Double Chocolate Chip Frappuccino with blended cream from Starbucks!     * HATE: Preventable mishap/ what happens after... cleaning up the mess!!! >: (

        hey! well, I made a livejournal... and that one kind of got boring. So, now I got a  Blogspot!  Or whatever these things are called. Yes  I was very bored...  hmmm so this one doesn't seem too complicated like the last one. But, none the less! I still need help on it! So, if someone wants to take that job, holler at me! I'll probably still do xanga though... I don't know. Leave me a comment!      Darwin.
