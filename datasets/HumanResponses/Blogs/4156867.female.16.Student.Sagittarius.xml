      Today is your last day...It was nice having you asa teacher....I do have a good book. I didn't get it from the library, I don't like our library and there is too much temptation to lose it. I think the 10 guidelines helped me alot. What helped the most was pickinh out specific details. Thanks, and can't wait to see you in the lab.

      My book briefly touched base on the different parties the sororities and fraternities have. They tell how when they tell people they do service work, they really just throw an awesome party and have an outrageouse cover charge and demand  the sisters and all brothers to attend. This os course, however leads to all the date rapes, and social interaction forced upon the sisterhood of many sororities. fraternities aren't as bad, because they are the one's doing the raping and interactions payed to them by the "Big Sisters."

      My book talked about the different cases that have been filed for court nation wide and how they lose everytime. A sorority is nothing more than a way to let people know that you have money and are basically set for life. The sisters are crazy. They even go as far as setting up date rapes: They will drug you up on "Special K" and then take you to a designated frat house where they have already pre-arranged a guy to "deflower" the "Little Sister." It's sickning to think that there are people out there that actually contribute to rape in our society. I am definatly considering beig in a club or something, instead of a sorority. I will not subject myself to their kniving, childish, and immature acts: rape, drug and alcohol usage and abusing, aswell as health issues...eating disorders. I don't know about you, but I like to keep what I eat down, that was the whole reason of eating it in the first place...lol. But, that's just me. Make your own judgments.

        My book today, touched on some factual cases that were filed against different sororities across the country. They never win because sororities are based on "high priced," fancy family based orginizations. The sister's in the different groups go as far as setting up parties to get the "Little Sisters" hooked on Ketamine, or "Special K," and take them to a male fraternity house where they have already prearranged to "deflower" the sisters. That is preposterous!!!! I definatly am thinking twice about being in a sororitiy group for fear of becoming somone I am not, and subjecting myself to their immature, childish, self-absorbing ways! I think I will stick to clubs where everything is in PUBLIC so I can assure my safety...lol.

      Today I left my book at home. I took it with me to Orlando when my mom and I evacuated because of the hurricane. I took it with me because it is a good book so far and didn't want it to get ruined. I left it at home next to my bed. Instead I wrote a note to my friend. I will make sure I bring my book tomorrow. I miss reading it. It was getting so good too! Gosh!

      Today, the sorority placed their votes on which house they wanted to be partnered with for Greek Week. They ended up voting fo rDelta Lambda, who wasn't even up for votes. The seniors were raged and scorned the girls who did not pick there choice of fraternity house. They eventually got over it and began their week of Greek Week. Meanwhile, at a keg party thrown by the Delta Lambdas one of the frat brothers raped one of the Alpha Ros. (The Alpha Ros are the main sorority in this book.) she told her dad and her parents told her that she wans't going back, and that it was the sororities fault. She completely disagreed and even told them she would pay the dues herself. She returned from home and had to deal with the rape. Thank goodness no one knew who it was that had gotten raped or her and the sisters would have been branded. Not a god thing!

        In my book today, I read about how the girls in the different sororities had to choose which fraternity house they were going to be running with for "Greek Week." Of course it had to be the house with the most coolest and most cutest guys in it. I mean they couldn't risk not winning Greek Week. Or even fathom going to the Homecoming dance with any guy that is less than perfect. I definatly think I will take a second look at the sororitiy house I want to be in when the time comes. Whoa! Too much drama for me to deal with.

        I read a few pages in my book today, it wasn't the best. It just talked about the different positions are in sorroities and how when you get a "Big Sister" you can be very easily disowned by them. Say you don't spend enough time maybe pledging for a position in the Chapter, then they can say they don't think that they are dedicated enough and disown them. I can't say that this is a very interesting part of the book that I have read so far.               I think that the author told us this story because he wanted people to see that something as small as a butterfly can hold so much beauty. We take things for granted and kill of things that aren't doing anything to harm us. Butterflies are beautiful creatures that actually bring a lot of people hope and inspiration.

        I am still reading my sorority book and it is pretty interesting. I read about how they are all moving back into theur pleged houses and thenew things they have done over the summer. One girl insists on showing everyone her new piercing...YA! It's down there!!! She is sort of the leader in that particular sorority house and all the new freshman gurls had to act like it was all ok to look at her and not be embarressed. It's really funny. Then they started talking about how all the houses are starting to have one black girl. They said this in front of the black girl in the house an dall she could really do is just laugh and say, "Yup, that's me!" I really wanted to join a sorority when I got to college, but hearing alot of these things about how they DO have eating disorders is just crazy. They were talking about how the plumber was a frequent visitar because of all the stomach acids that were eroding the pipe lines from there vomit. Or how the lunch ladies noticed hundreds and hundreds of plastic sandwich bags dissappearing, and the plumber would find them in the garbages and toilet pipes of the sorority houses. GrOsS!!!     The bully was a pretty good story. I think it is neat how even though Tony was a bully to Roger in the 7th grade, he still helped him out and gave him his numbers and wanted to do lunch with him. He could have easily been like you use to do that stuff to me in middle school. Like garbage and now that your in theposition for me to make fun of you I think it is funny that your handicap. Or anything along those lines. That was very big of him to put things behind them and not hold anything against him from what happend in 7th grade.

       I have been reading a book called, "Pledged: The Secret Life of Sororities," written by Alexandra Robbins. I have been reading it off and on all summer long. It is pretty interesting, it talks about the different mythical things you hear about sororities and what's true about what you hear. I have learned that most of the "bad" things that I have heard about them are coming out to be true in one way or another.
