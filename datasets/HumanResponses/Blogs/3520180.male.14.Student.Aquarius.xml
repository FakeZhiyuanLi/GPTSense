      livin on earth is a purpose to accomplish... When you are born, its not an accident, it is a purpose... sometimes, you feel like you don feel like existing unfortunately you have to be... you cant self terminate, thats retarded... sometimes you fall down as in physically, its an accicent or planned... that obstrustion is ment to be there to cause that accident... everything around you is just temporaly for when you perish, you wont be with the things around you... ppl think that by burning your things can be sent to heaven... actually you are just trying to create a big camp fire to roast your mushmallows... Expensive equiptment(non-natural) are on earth created by men that actually just temp you to have it... people in common have one thing... called Greeddyness they want everything that friends or fows have... In result?, Stealing and robbing is applied... and end your life in jail...  So... before you could do anything, think first... thats all
