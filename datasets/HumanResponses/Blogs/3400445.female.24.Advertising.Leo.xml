      Canada.  a hockey nation.  a nation that without the stanley cup is like a summer day with no sun... or like may 24 long weekend with no beer and no friends...  Calgary has the first chance in 10 years to bring the cup back to Canada, where it belongs.  so lets join together, crack beers, don jerseys, and flip on the tube.  let us join as a nation and cheer for Calgary...  let the Flames burn!

      Today, like any other day.  waking up at my ex-boifriends after a night of fun and wicked sex... BEEP BEEP BEEP the harsh reality chills me as the covers are pulled back.  he gets out of bed to the telephone. he loves me. i love him. yet the inevitalble phrase tugs at my heartstrings everytime i see him...yeah, well she is my girlfriend. so what am i? what name is there for me? "don't over think it," he says. fine. done. names are supposed to inhibit anyway right?  like putting an ivisible box around something. 'it' cannot change once 'it' is defined. there is someting cozy about a box though...perhaps it's the familiarity. overthinking again.   how does a person overthink anyway?   i know i have done this... and i know i have witnessed other people overthink.   i've told them not to. but where is the line between not thinking enough and overthinking? am i overthinking overthinking? fuck. all i know is that i want to be with him... i love him. i love him unconditionally. she is leaving. thank god. but will it be different when she is gone? i know this is not about her... it's about him. getting his shit together...whatever that is. i know that just because i don't understand this doesn't mean it isn't okay... the problem lays in the fact that i cannot truely move on. it's not that i haven't tried. i don't want to. i do not want anyone else. i want him. until i am sure things will never work out...i do not want to be with anyone else...period. i do not want to be in an unhealthy situation. i just want to enjoy life.  enjoy my time with him. and not to overthink.

      so i think I've missed the point. is it really love that is important? because it seems that we run around chasing those that do not want us. and those who do...We do not want them. is love just a game? and is it what we should all be looking for? or is it in fact just an illusion? something that distracts us from our everyday life? perhaps it is the connection that is most important. not love at all. not that love is not important. but is it the most important? is the connection to somebody else what feeds us. what keeps us going. what helps us to feel like apart of something. something important. a connection that helps us to relate. to feel connected. to ground us on this earth in a way that feels safe. feels real. should we in fact be looking for those that appreciate us? as opposed to those who love us?

      he is the best friend a person could have. he is loving. but in a way that is almost undetectable at times. i have taken out my magnifying glass. i see now. i see that he loves me when he talks to me. even if it is harsh at times. he is speaking. that means he cares. i feel so incredibly lucky. to have found a friend that will take the time out to take a chance, maybe initially even be considered mean...to get his point across. to let me hear his opinion. i hope he never stops speaking. i love him more than ever. i love him always.

      maybe im just normal. maybe this whole process is what figuring yourself out really is. i love him. i will not stop. i am not a fool. i am in love. i would never trade the bad...i would forfeit the good. not worth it. never worth it. good and bad are part and parcel. they are tests. tests of your emotions. a test of yourself as a person.

      how could i let this happen? how could i upset those that i love most and who are closest to me? how could i let myself get to such a state that i am no longer myself? not myself... but it was me. who was that psycho?  that psycho inside me? i can't undo what i did. i must make sure it never happens again. never. i will never drink again. ever. this day, june 23 2004, i vow that i will never drink again. a promise that only i can break.

      i have been a fool a fool in love a fool for love i believed that if i loved, loved with unwavering strength, it would matter it would make a difference i was under the impression that things would work out that love would conquer all that nothing else mattered, if there was love i have been a fool a fool in love maybe i thought that i could love enough for both of us maybe i wasn't thinking maybe im overthinking i have been a fool a fool in love overlooking other women other distractions knowing that i love you  knowing you love me is it possible to love and be with someone else? are their different types of romantic love? can a person ever love you the way you need to be loved? would they try? does anybody love the same way? why is this so important? the feeling of being loved  loved by you you whose love is the most important i have been a fool a fool in love i can't move on im trying i can't im sick to my stomach  i don't want to hurt anymore i hate that i don't understand you why you don't want me maybe i am empty maybe i am not enough maybe...  maybe im just a fool

      your love feels like... the way you touch my cheek the way you say my name the way i feel when i know your looking at me the way you run your fingers through my hair  the sound of your breath while you sleep the way you love your cat the way your eyes dance the way you walk the way you hold yourself the way you feel music the way you explain and teach the way you birdbath the way you laugh the way you sing to me and write songs for me the way you care about your family the way you take pictures of me the way you creep up on me and tickle me the way you make me feel like the most important person in the world when you look at me the way time seems to stand still when i am with you the way we can be doing something or nothing and it doesn't matter because just being with you makes me feel happy the way i feel in the morning when i wake up next to you, like i can do anything the way you told me, "the best feeling in the whole world is the way i feel next to you" the way i get excited and why i always read your emails first the way you make me want to be a better person, to take better care of myself  the way your sweat smells so sweet the way i know you love me, and yet i also know that you love the idea of loving me... and that loving me and being with me are two different things.  the way i feel when i can't stop thinking about you and start to write and write and write

      today i learned the meaning of nice.  it does not mean that you pretend to hold the elevator door by reaching for the button.  or that you do not spit in food before you serve it.  or that you do not make noise at 3am in a quite residential neihbourhood.  being nice gives a person a good feeling.  is this good feeling abused?  are people nice just to make themselves feel better? not to simply help out a fellow human being?  so what happens when a person is "nice" for the wrong reasons?  what are the "wrong reasons"?  let me enlighten you as i have recently found out first hand.  i have found that people are "nice" in a way that is purely self-serving.  oh sure.  they do not realize it at the time.  they are being nice.     beware  those who are nice and then somehow end up throwing it all back in your face.  those who find a way to turn the "nice" thing that they did around and use it against you...  use it to expose a weakness.  then use this weakness to elevate themselves and showcase how "nice" they were...  and what could we ever do without such nice people?   beware  of those who are nice.  take care of yourself.  everyone is self-serving...  everyone.

      Love. what is love anyway?   an intense bunch of feelings for someone or something?   what everyone is searching for? the energy that binds us as humans and helps us to not feel so alone in this vast uncaring world? it binds us just as it rips us apart. there is no rest for the weary. there is no rationale for the confused. love rips through my heart like the roar of a harley davidson on a hot dry summer street. emotions leave you weak.  spent.   loss of all ability to properly protect yourself.  no fort to call my own. open.  open to pain.  open to love. no walls on my fort.  the fort that was supposed to be built.   the fort that others seem to have are so big and strong. i have no fort. i am a wanderer. i am alone. i visit others on my travels through life...yet their forts have walls that can not be penetrated.   passed through, but no one lets their gaurd down. always snipers on the walls.  waiting. waiting for you. to slip up. a fort is much stronger against a traveller when they are lone wanderer on the inside. it encompasses.  it drowns. the light that penetrates is only 10 to 2.   everything is dim. many shadows cast. i have left the last fort i encountered on my travels.  i see it only in the distance. there is sand in the wind and my vision is blurry. it seems like home. like something safe. i turn around. keep going. that is not home. it is an illusion it has created for itself. once leaving a fort you must not return. so lonely. so alone.

      i love you for your strength of soul and spirit  i love you because of your energy the way our energy flows together much different energy  but along the same path in the same direction  i love you because you can handle anything, but feel the crushing weight of it sometimes just like everyone else  i love you because you are stubborn, caring and loving   i love you because you are impatient  i love the way you project your own exact actions, feelings and/or emotions onto others   i love the way you hold things in, and by doing so shut people out the way you don't think anybody else can help the way you don't want to burden anybody   i love you because you are totally unreliable but you are always there for the people you love when they really need you  i love you because you are always missing the point  i love you because you challenge me in ways that drain my energy and leave me misunderstood and frustrated  i love the ways you have tested me without letting on that you are doing so  i love that you think you are clever and keep things from me because you think its best but would never want to hurt me or keep things from me at the same time  i love that you underestimate me  i love you because you are scared just like the rest of us  i love you because you use peoples disadvantages to elevate yourself everyday, all the time, wherever you go  i love you because you are complex and yet transparent  i love you because you think that since you have experienced something you are an authority on it and can look down your nose at those going through a similar thing  i love the way you feel too good to be true and yet really you feel you are never good enough    i love the way you feel you want/need to protect me  i love the way you feel generous towards me because you feel stuck  i love the way you trust me  i love the way you love me and hate me at the same time  the way you think that everything will work out in the end but that you are not an optimist the way you are in control of your own life, but leave the future to chance and fate  i love the way you are the gravitational pull in your own universe  the way you never think first about the needs of others, unless it directly affects you or the way you feel or look to others  the way you realize that my love for you is pure, unrelenting, uncompromising, and unwavering...no matter what and the fact that you don't know how to feel about it  i love the way you love me, need me, can not afford to not have me in your life...and tell me you love @*!^, all in the same breath.  i love your confusion  i love your humanity  i love that you want to "do the right thing" and usually fuck up the situation because of it  i love you because you are only human, but want to be so much more, to so many  i love that you put yourself first, but do not take care of your own most basic needs in doing so  i love the way you do everything fast... eat, sleep, fuck, drive, walk, read, type, listen to music, make phone calls, converse, evaluate, draw conclusions, move through parties, lives, love, life  i love the way you are a contradiction of yourself  i love that you do everything with the best of intentions  i love the way you know i know you the way you know i love all of you all sides everything i want to know all that i do not there is so much more, i know it you are my light
