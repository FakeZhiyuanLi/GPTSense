      I'm mad. Madder than my last post.  Earlier today, I went to go see "Raising Helen." Everything was going fine until I realized halfway through the movie that I was drinking Coke. I have been in the process of several tests (blood, etc.) at Riley for over a year, and Coke voids one of the tests, the test that was due tomorrow morning, the same test that Mom had to schedule three months in advance for. That ruined the movie for me, knowing that Mom would have a fit. And she did. For those who don't know, I can't stand being screamed at. I cry. Yes, one of the only times I'll cry. And so I cried while my mother cussed me out with the "f-word" and various other 4-lettered words. I tried to not let it get to me, but knowing that it was my fault that I followed with my 3-year tradition of getting Freeze-Frame Cokes at the movies made it worse. I stayed in the bathroom and cried for 10 minutes straight, and when I got online and talked to Ash and Nat for awhile, she was still screaming from the bottom of the stairs.   I thought she was over the whole, "You can't go to California now" thing, but when I was packing for Cali just now, she said, "You look like it's a definite thing. It's not, especially with that test you just ----ed up."   Nat's upset. So am I. And I can't stand her using cuss words. There's a reason I've cussed once in my life, and that was when I was 2 and I was following her example. What a wonderful role model.   So there's the main story. I'm mad. And upset. And Ash isn't online and Jane's not home. Great.   And now I've ranted. Goodnight.  "Don't worry. There's more birds in the sea. Wait! I mean, fish in the sky..."

      Well, I am feeling a bit better. Sorta. Not really. No. Never mind. Actually, now I am feeling quite stupid, and so I must apologize to Nathan for acting completely insane. (Sarah, you were right. I feel better now.) So, I'm sorry Nathan! Anyways... yeah. Wow, the whole thing has just hit me. I'm really feeling terrible now. I guess that I have been avoiding the issue for some time now, but now it's really hit me, and yeah. Although I know I'm not alone, I sure do feel so lonely. 'Tis a lonely Ashley, and I don't really think that there's anything anyone can do. You've all been really great though! Oh, and for Sarah and Evan (although I am not sure that he reads this) I ate a bit today, actually, a few minutes ago, and I'm feeling really sick again. Argh. And all it was was rice!!!  Yeah. Saturday was a bitter sweet day. Sarah and Evan did all they could to keep my mind off it. It worked for a while too. They were all concerned because I was eating. Ah well. That's what friends do. Sarah and I walked around Broadripple for a bit and then came home and waited for Evan by sitting outside in the grass and cooing at birds. (Or at least I was, lol)(See below) And so yeah. Then Evan came by and we all sat out in the grass for a longer time until they got really hungry and so we went inside and they made me eat. Then, they amused themselves, and me, by going through Sarah's books. That was funny. It ended with me being dropped off at home around 11. It was quite random, but it worked. Thanks guys!!!  Okay, quote time.  "Ex astris scientia" Think motto of something. (Bets are that either Jonah or Nathan will get this one. They'll actually be the only ones to get this one...but hey! That's okay!) It's worth only 100 points total for them, because I know that they know where it's from. 160 total (including whose motto it is) for everyone else! Scores: Alison: 480 Michael: 470 Olivia:160 Evan: (the most random player in this game) 160 Everyone else: 0 C'mon people!!! I guess that I should explain the new thing at hte bottom...... Well, you see, Sarah and I were sitting outside waiting on Evan on Saturday, and a dove came by. I was going, "Coo! Coo!" ANd it cooed back. And it started coming over, which became a whole, "Hey Ashley! The dove wants to date you!" thing with Sarah. Then, he flew away, and Sarah said:  "Don't worry. There's always more birds in the sea. Wait! I mean, fish in the sky! Argh..."

      Crappy day. Crappy weekend. Crappy month.  Sorry about not blogging this weekend, but I was too busy with college parties/cookouts/tornadoes/visits with grandparents/a failed garage sale/etc. I'd rather not go into how much my parents lack in common sense. If I do, this entry will turn into a rant.  However, Saturday was the highlight of my summer thus far.  While the morning was a bit more serious and unexpected, from noon until around 11 P.M., it was a blast. :P Ashley went with me shopping in Broad Ripple, where I found my wonderful lil' Japanese sign that says "No smoking on bed," "Good night," and "Please keep valuables and other items in headstage." I love it!!! Ahhh... Random Asian objects are my specialty. :) We ate at Ben & Jerry's, returned home at 5 to talk to Evan and Nat (haha... she still has no idea who you are!), and then sat outside to wait for Evan to drop by. And he did. For several hours. What fun! (And we have yet to bake and name the walnut cookie! Unfortunately, I don't like walnuts, but I'll help you make 'em!)  That was the good part. Now my parents are talking about NOT going to California, even though we already bought the tickets, I'm half-packed, and Nat and I are already psyched. She's even trying to arrange a time when I can meet her new boyfriend. (Mark's cute, too! Nat has good taste!) I hate how they always break their promises and blame it on me. (Like me spending all their money - well, I bought 5 pairs of shorts, but if it's going to be 90 degrees out there and all my shorts don't fit, then what the heck am I supposed to do??)  Ashley, you forgot to change the ending quote to...  "Don't worry. There's always more birds in the sea. Wait! I mean, fish in the sky! Argh..."

      You all need to blog again! I have no idea why no one's blogged after my last one, but please, blog people!  My qoute for today is worth 300 points, but only if you can tell me a.)what it means and b.) Which type of people said it to whom and WHY....  "Nos morituri te salutant!"   Okie dokie?  Scores stand at: Oliva- 160 Alison-480 Michael- 170 Evan- 160  Yeah. I am not doing too much better, but paradoxically (if that's not a word, it is now) I am. I'll be fine in a couple of weeks. It's just hit me really hard. Thank you all for all of your love and support. I could never  ask for any better friends.   "Shelby! Don't make me come after you in my scooby doos!"

      Okay yeah, I know that that isn't within my title scheme, but this is important.  I got a call this morning from my "uncle" Ray's brother. Ray died last night. Apparently, he's been in the hospital for the last week and his liver failed. To be honest, it doesn't seem real. I am really wishing that someone is going to call back and say "just joking" although I know that would never happen.   Currently I am at Sarah's house. She didn't want me to be alone, especially when I called her in   tears   after I got off the phone with him. So yeah. I'm just eh. So yeah, I just I'd write abiut this so that all of you know. (Aching Sushi and Compendium people.)   Quote: In honor of Ray, a child at heart, "Tu parles comme les grandes personnes!" I'm gonna miss him so much!!!!  So also in honor of Ray, who would always stand in the backyard, and yell after his dog, Shleby:  "Shelby! Don't make me come after you in my scoobey doos!" (He had scoobey doo boxers.)

      YAY! NO SCHOOL FOR OVER TWO MONTHS!!! I've been waiting so long for this summer and it's FINALLY HERE!!! Needless to say (in case you couldn't tell) I'm excited!  Yes, let's not talk about the French final, shall we? :-P I somehow managed to get an A- for the semester anyway, so I'm happy, especially since I got a B+ in geometry! So I'll have a great semester average, which is a relief. I just want to stay on the Academic Top 30!  Let's see...time for a "year in review" (or in some cases, second semester), eh??  G1-Lyceum- grr. I thought Ms. Means was a good teacher when she actually taught things that were meaningful, but 1) she didn't teach very often and 2) when she did, most of the lessons weren't meaningful (or part of the curriculum!). At least the class was easier than it would have been if we had Chapman, but I would have learned so much more. Plus everyone hated it because it was so unproductive, and I think we all started to take it less and less seriously as the year went by. So, in short, I won't be sad to see it go. At least I had good friends to keep me company! :o)  G2-World History- Mrs. Layman was a nice person but a hopelessly boring teacher. I learned a lot but I won't remember most of it because she didn't teach it in a way that  made me care about the material. It was also a weird group of kids -- we had everyone from major overachievers to total slackers. And then there was the AP test...ugh. Yeah, that's another class I won't miss too much.  G3-Yearbook- I decided not to be on staff anymore, partly because I have too many other classes I want/need to take and partly because of my own decision. I came out with some good final products (pages), but I didn't feel my skills (writing) were used very well, and I didn't have a lot of support or people I could talk to. There were a lot of days when I wouldn't be able to do anything, and I'd just sit around bored. Plus I find it very awkward to interview random people, so that wasn't good, and most of the people on staff aren't my type. There are some great people, but there are others who wander around the halls most of the time, snort Pixie Sticks (I swear this happened), and talk too loudly about their weekend escapades (aka drinking parties and...well, you can guess what comes next). It's sort of sad, though, because Mrs. Francis is great, and there are some perks to being on staff, but in the end I just decided they weren't worth it if I still had to put up with the other stuff.  G4-SRT- Yearbook again, so we won't spend more time on that.  R5-Choir (Crystal Harmony)- That was hard for me. Crystal Harmony was completely different than it was last year -- new teacher, mostly new girls, etc. The chemistry between the girls wasn't as good, and frankly, they just weren't as good overall. I hated when people slacked off, when the teacher had to yell, when I was disappointed after concerts/performances. It just wasn't good, and choir is supposed to be good for me. It NEEDS to be good for me. Thankfully, I will be in Chamber Singers next year, which will be INCREDIBLE and I am THRILLED! :-D  R6-French- At first I really liked how Mrs. Mannweiler made the class so interactive and productive, but eventually it got on my nerves. It just seemed like she tried to do too much, and that lost my attention just as quickly as not doing anything. I at least enjoyed the discussions, and I also really liked having a smaller class. I'm looking forward to French IV and V with Hilgemeier!  R7-Etymology- This was one of my favorite classes. Mr. Everitt was an awesome teacher because he was so into his subject. He knew all about words and roots, and he had all sorts of examples to show us (for instance, he collects Calvin & Hobbes cartoons that use our vocab words). One of my favorite memories was when one of our words was "parody," and to illustrate what a parody was, he put on Weird Al Yankovich's (did I spell that right?) song "Amish Paradise." Not only did he play it, but he RAPPED TO IT. Oh man it was great. Words come pretty easily to me, so it wasn't a hard class at all, and some of the people were really funny. That was a really enjoyable class for me.  R8-Geometry- SO glad I switched teachers this semester -- Mrs. Witzerman was really nice, offered extra credit, and gave more points than Mr. Frankum did. I had an a A for two of the three six-weeks, which I never would have dreamed about first semester. I had my "freshman friends" to keep me company, and they were really fun. And, of course, I will always remember the day when Mrs. Witzerman gave us ice cream and let us listen to our CD players as we worked on our tessellation projects. :o)  So, there you have it, folks. My year in a nutshell -- well, at least class-wise. This summary doesn't include all the stress, work, and crappy parts that made me cry, but we won't go into that because I'm sure we all had times like that this year, and I'm even more sure that none of us really want to talk about them. Hope you all have a wonderful summer and that I will see you sometime! (Sarah: KOKOMO OR BUST!!)  "I GOTS EARS!" (Ashley, that was SO cute!)

      Please, all you wonderful, intelligent, lovable, terrific French studnets, please, do not kill me. I enjoy living. I don't want to talk about the final.  Anyways... I had fun today. It was much fun, although it was somewhat stressful. AH well. The movie was good. I enjoyed myself, alhtough I am quite tired now, so yeah. I am repeating myself.  So yeah. WE ARE JUNIORS!!! WOOHOO! In Algebra today I didn't do anything. It was great. So much fun for me. I got SOOOOOOO bored though. Everyone was asking me what was on the French final. argh. They didn't understand what I was trying to tell them and I was getting quite frustrated when they didn't understand. Ah well. An hour wasted. And then I took my Latin final. It was SO easy! Ah well. I am glad to have it finished.  Well, Alison's kicking all your butts in my quotes. She has 480 points. Olivia still has 160, and Michael has 10. Why is no one else joining in?? They're quite fun!! And Ali was right. Horace said What prevents me from telling the truth with a smile? Good job Alison!! Woohoo! Next! Mea mihi conscientia pluris est quam omnium sermo. Have fun with that one! Well, I'll let you go now....btw...  I (still) GOTS EARS!!!!

      It's my orchestra period. Well, "orchestra," I should say. :P I'm actually in the North Star room.    In an hour and a half, we'll officially be juniors!! YAH! (We are soooo going shopping with the money I make from our garage sale Monday! I want to party NOW! But no, of course my health has to get in the way... :( NO MOVIES FOR AMARIS!)  I'm tired. And bored. And thus, I will end this post.    I GOTS EARS!

      It is now out on DVD. Thought you all would like to know.  i'm incredibly bored right now so i'd thought i'd blog and answer ashley's quote thingy.  I actually like looking them up and stuff. it's interesting to see what the english translation is. Ridentem dicere verum, quid vetat? What prohibits us to tell the truth laughing (through a joke)? by: Horatius, Satirae i don't really get this one though. but then, i don't get a lot of things.  just a half of day left until we're outta school!!!!:-d i'm so happy!!! this year hasn't been the best, but i'm just glad that it's over.  it only seemed like yesterday that i was walking into chem class. i'm sad to say this, but i'm gonna miss mr. webster. even though he was the most horrible teacher, he was a good guy and he was incredibly smart. a lil too smart to be teaching high school, but this was his last year and we were the last class that he was ever going to teach:(  you guys should all go onto rateteachers.com and rate all your teachers. i think that's the website at least. i  haven't been on there in a while, but it's really funny how they rate the teachers. there's a ton on lupold and mr. savage:-p I've got ears!!!

      He!! How are you all? I am good. I have sugar and caffine ergo I am happy. Woohoo!  OKay! Let's start with the quote of the day. Michael now has 10 points for giving the motto, Alison has 310 points for giving the last two translations, but not the last motto, and Omom still has 160 points. The rest of you have 0. Come on! Okay, Combining Ali's and Michael's answers, it was the Olymic Motto which means higher, faster, stronger. Good job! The new one, if i can find my paper is: Ridentem dicere verum quid vetat? Hee! You don't need to know who said it. If you do, you get 20 points! wOoT! Okay...not much happened today. Took that English final, and I got an A. It was eh. Latin final tomorrow. I think that I'll actually study. I'm just going to look over some stuff, not really out and out study.  I wnat to know what I got on the French test!! Argh!!! Anyways.  Getting another guinea pig tonight. I have no idea what to name her though. Suggestions would be appriciated! (wow. This is a short post!)  I GOTS EARS!!!

      Or, at least school.   THE YEAR IS ALMOST OVER!!!! Daniel and I helped Layman out during SRT, carrying books, running papers to students, etc. It wasn't until then that I realized that I would never be in any of my green day classes again, excepting North Star SRT. It's so sad!! I'm getting all sentimental here! Argh... I don't adapt well to change.   Things I'll Miss This Summer: - Snack Shop (haha) - N* staffers sneaking out to buy us food - Kelsey's outfits - Kaylan and me feeling smart in Algebra II :P (Slack-off juniors!) - World History - Ammar getting yelled at by the other guys, him yelling back; Courtney's hugs (haha); Daniel just being Daniel; the Millenium Series theme song - French *tear* - Christmas potato! (Evan will only be with us another year!) - All of N* stuff - Jonah *illegally* playing games on the school computer - Jonah losing badly when I sit and watch (haha!) - orchestra periods that weren't really orchestra periods (mostly this past month, when I left orchestra to work on "N* stuff")  I have no good memories of chem, so I'll stop there. :P  You know, Jane, posting more often would make us all happier and would lighten the load of entries you have to read. (hint, hint)  I GOTS EARS!

      Summer days...wasting away???...i don't know the words so i'm not even gonna try.  summer feels so much close now that school is almost over.  Just two more days and we're going to be juniors. it's unbelievable.  exams this year seem so hard. i do'nt have anything tomorrow so that's why i have time to write in here. i've updated my profile too if you wanna check that out. i didn't realize this till today, but it said that i was a male in it...i just laughed!!! but it's all changed now. i realize that i didn't really say anything bout myself and i just started writing but you'll pretty much read about me in the profile.  as for the finals though, french was amazingly hard.  I was guessing my through the last part of it so i really do hope that she just takes that section out.  i know i did really badly even though i'd like to think i did well, but that's just not happening. but i'm not really caring anymore. school is over in two days and summer is going to start.  i'm looking forward to it so much even though i don't even have anything planned. i guess i'll enjoy not having to do homework and waking up at 7 in the mornin'!  to answer's ashley's translation of Altius, Fortius, Citius...to show you how bored i am, i actually went online and looked up the meaning of these three words and came up with "Swifter, Higher, Stronger". If that's wrong, blame yahoo.com, lol.  Less than two days to go!!!  I GOTS EARS!!!!!

      Wow. That was a lot harder than I originally expected. I"m glad though. It made me think! Woohoo for thinking!!!!! I will be attending on Friday, and getting a ride from Catie. :-D ALi- sorry if I seemed a bit out of it when you called before. I had just gotten up! I was tired.  Ah, well. No one has answered my last questions, which make me sad. So the score still stands tied at Alison- 160; Olivia - 160; everyone else? 0. That's right. Zero. Nada. Ha. Get out those latin dictionarires!! OR French dictionaries!! Okay the answers to the last ones were: 1.) It so mysterious, the land of tears. And that is again by St. Ex. from LPP (And actually, you find both quotes in the same chapter about "la guerre entre les moutons et les fleurs." The war between the sheep and flowers.) 2.) I think therefore I am! And I believe Descartes said that. (A Frenchman!) Correct me if I am wrong. Okay your next one is a motto. Give the translation and whose motto it is: Altius, Fortius, Citius.  Ha. Have fun.  Not much more to report other than in 1.5 school days we will be juniors! WOOHOO!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay yeah.  Short post just because.  Oh, changing the thing at the bottom. Most of you have heard me say this. Oh, and correction from last time. Because I did not see Jonah or Nathan perform last night, they have yet to use up their Ashley dangeruosly coming to something they are in ticket. I have taken away the rest of yours. Sorry. BUT I had so much fun! It was an awesome show!!!  I GOTS EARS!!!!!

      Last night had to be the most hilarious "everything-gone-wrong" performance I have ever done.  For those not in attendance (like YouNa and Ali), I'll summarize.  1) Ms. Means' car broke down while she was loading refreshments in the trunk. She didn't get there until my group was setting up our scene. Keep in mind that we were the FIFTH out of SIX groups to perform.   2) Whoever did the lights screwed up almost our entire scene. They turned on the lights before I was ready to do the intro, which then got me flustered and I hesitated a few times, and almost every time we needed them to turn the lights off, they missed the cue. Imagine: all the suitors are "dead" on the floor, I've just screamed and dropped a bucket of apples, and Austin (who played Odysseus) has to raise his head and yell, "BLACK!"  3) Alvin forgot a couple of his lines, which then eliminated a few of mine. Ah, well.   4) The "luck" scene in which I walk across the stage and get run over by Aaron did not happen as planned. The lines went slower than in rehearsal, and I was already walking onstage a few seconds too early. However, Aaron made up for it by running into me and really causing me to fall. It worked well. :P However, when I dropped the bucket of apples, I found the apples and gathered them up, but the bucket had flown into a dark part of the audience and I had no time left to go looking for it. So, when Jane yelled, "There's a volcano under the house! It's erupting! We're all gonna die!" I just threw the apples up in the air and screamed. It was soooooo cheesy and fake, but apparently the audience liked it. :)  5) I accidentally left one of the apples onstage after our performance, and Katherine (who played Gandalf in the final skit) was kicking it around the stage as she walked. I thought it was hilarious. RANDOM APPLES!  I'll see about the movies, Alison. My mom actually has somewhere else to go that day, but if you could give me a ride, I should be able to go.   "Happy Towne: a self-sufficient community where the people are fed with the area's sole food source - a giant PopTart."

      It was GOOD!! I enjoyed myself!!! It was funny! (Although, sadly enough, I did not get to see Nathan and Jonah's... Or Beth's. I risked my life to get there! lol. Okay. Sarah, Jane, Olivia, Nathan, and Jonah have all used up their Ashley risking her life to get to something involving them ticket. Sorry! Mom and I drve 80 mph from Lafayette in traffic to get there. Ah well. Only because I love you all. (In a non romantic way mostly.) ) Anyways.. I don't think I did well on that Chem final. It was evil. I hate Chem. I ONLY HAVE 1 MORE DAY! WOOHOOO!!!! Ah well. I never have to take it again. I will be ending my days with physics, which I am looking forward to sooo much!!! Yes! French final tomorrow! I can't wait! (Okay, Yes, I know I am weird. Don't laugh at me!! lol! That's my job!) Hee! I am on such a dugar high right now. Sarah gave me ice cream!  Ah, French. That reminds me... I don't know who posted the answer first to my question. I assume it's Omo, but I am not sure, so you will both get your points. And the correct translation is: "But that's not a man! That's a mushroom! A what? A mushroom!" And it was from Le petit prince by St. Exupery! Woohoo! Je l'aime! Now for another, actually, tonight we will have 2! :-) 1.) C'est tellment mysterieux, le pays des larmes! :-( 2.) Cogito ergo sum! :-) Oh! My day today was awesome! I got out of school at 11.30! Hee. Meaning I skipped most of Englsih, which makes me happy. (I also skipped SRT, but no one really cares about that.) My day started off TERRIBLE. I realized that I forgot my chem binder, that Routt was collecting, at home. I ran around the school going to various teachers to see if I could use their phone to call my mom to have her birng it. FINALLY, I got Deardorff's phone to work. (Collier let me use his, but I couldn't get it to work.) I also realized that hey! I only have a graphing calculator, and we're supposed to use only scientific on the test. SO I tracked Jane down and traded her calcs. I then went to US, which was absolutly hilarious. Watching juniors pretend to be chickens who are tackled to the ground and eaten in the dark is one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen.  Anyways, I then went to chem and failed my final. I then got out of English to go with my mom to Lafayette. THat was fun. We stopped an ate, and then went to the mall. And actually, at the mall, I ran into one of my best frineds from grade school who recognized me right as I entered the pet shop. :-) I spent some time talking to her. I then went to hot topic where I got the best sweatshirt ever. If you saw me tonight, I probably said  "I GOT EARS!" to you! It's such a cute swaetshirt. I don't believe Jane thinks so though.  Anyways. I went to the Denny's where I had a soda with my parents. We then all went to the psychologist. Woohoo. Family outing. Long story. Don't want to talk about it. The psychologist said that I need to start acting more like a teenager and not a thirty year old. Wow. That sounds weird. I think that he feels I have too many responsibities at home. SO yeah.  Mom and I then drove 80 to get to school in time. It took us 45 minutes! :-D Never again though.   Well that's about all for now...  Oh! Wait! I might be getting another guinea pig! YAY!

      just watched that movie in srt... today has been such a movie day. in anatomy and physiology, we watched ice age. i have to say it's really cute just cuz of the kid in ther and the big elephant. but it doesn't beat monster's incorporated with Boo saying "Mike Wizowski(?)" however you spell his name.  i totally get what you mean sarah. the finals that you have to study for the most comes first and the most useless ones comes last when you've got plenty of time to study for them.  i just took my chem final today and it was not easy...but then, none of webster's tests are easy. for all you in webster's, be ready for a big curve on the final. i was sittiin' next to this girl who doodled on her paper the whole time and i'm pretty sure just randomly filled in answers on her scantron. you've gotta love people like that when the test is curved.    as to what is going on this week, anybody got plans on friday? we're getti'n outta school at 11 and if anybody wanted to see Day After Tomorrow, i'm going to see it with Catie Phillabaum.  I know that ashley wants to go and to let you guys know ahead of time if you wanna come, the movie is at 1:15 and it's 2hrs and 4 min. not including previews. we were thinking grab a bite to eat somewhere and then the movie since we've got some time to kill from 11 - 1. so tell me if you wanna go!  " -'Mais ce n'est pas un homme! C'est un champignon! - 'un quoi?' -'Un champignon!!!' " Now here it goes...i'm totally just guessing at this.  -But it's not a guy! It's a mushroom! - A what? -A mushroom!!! you guys can all laugh at me if i got that translation wrong, but it's worth a shot. and i'm guessing it's from le petit prince. i seriously don't get that book!!! french or no french, it's gibberish to me..  To all you people in lyceum. good luck tonite, sry i can't come but i've got to cram for the french final and alg II test.

      Just 2 1/2 days left and then we will be free of school for almost three months! YAY! I am so ready for summer, you have no idea. Case in point: I should be studying for finals right now. I have French and geometry tomorrow -- ironically, those are the ones I need to study for the most, and I have them first. Then, the final I need to study for the least, etymology, is the one I have the most time to study for because I have it last period on Friday! Go figure. Ashley, I would ask how in the heck you could find a French final FUN, considering I am majorly stressing about how I can possibly remember all the stupid verb forms, but I already know the answer (knowing the francophone that you are) so I will not bother. :-P  I don't have time to do an overview of my year right now, but I have three more things to say: 1) If you come to Meeting of the Minds, don't be expecting brilliance. None of us want to do it anymore, even though the majority of the skits are good/humorous. 2) Summer gym sucks. Yay for Amaris and me because we don't have to take it ever again!! 3) Amaris, it's sad that you can't take French anymore! French IV is supposedly when it gets good! That technology credit is really bugging me, so my mom and I are going to try to find a way out of it. I have too many other classes I need to take.  OK, I'm out.

      Oh argh. Chelsea (a.k.a. DEMON child) just deleted my nice long post... Okay... Tomorrow: A. Go to US history B.Take Chem final C. Go home. (ha! My mom is the coolest! She's letting me skip my last two classes because I have nothing better to do in them. We have to go to Lafayette at like 4 though...) D. Go to lafayette E. HOPEFULLY go to Meeting of the Minds...I might be a bit late...I will definatly try to make it though. If it looks like I am going to be more than 15 minutes late, I might just bag it... I am going to TRY MY HARDEST to make it there though! I want to see you all!!! F. Go home and study Okay... So yeah... I am not looking forward to summer gym. At all. Enough  said. I AM looking forward to my French final though! I can't wait! I find them sooo much fun!!! (seriously!!) Oh! And we're having an English essay on our Latin final! wOoT! Yay! Fun!!! Woohoo!!! :-D (seriously!!) Okay yeah. Now, because Sarah stopped doing her question of the day, I will start with my TRA-DA-DA! Latin/French Quotes of the day. Rules: Translate. More points if you can name speaker/ book/etc. Okay? Okay. I will not tell you if they are Latin or French. You must guess. In this round, only Sarah is exempt, because she knows a.) WHat it means and b.) Where it is from. Okay, the quote is this: " -'Mais ce n'est pas un homme! C'est un champignon!   - 'un quoi?'   -'Un champignon!!!' " 10 points for name of source and 150 points for translation. Go!

      The last week of sophomore year... Even though we had some bad, nasty, not-so-good moments this past year, overall I have to say it was a good year. I know that I grew immensely as a result of it. Since Mike Kelly (another North Star staffer) just went to get some of us Burger King, I'll recap the year's events according to class.   G1: Lyceum  WELL... The class = boring or incredibly confusing. The people made it worthwhile, though. It was the only class I had with Jane, and having the class two years in a row made it more comfortable to be in there. LYCEUM PEOPLE ROCK!   G2/R2: North Star  Newspaper rocks. There's not much I can say to really sum up how incredibly fun and... There's no word for it. I love this class.   G3: AP World History  First semester was slow and boring, but second semester went by quickly. Personally, I think it was due to the people in that class and not Layman's methods. :) Daniel, Jonah and Ammar made it a bit more interesting, but Courtney was the most interesting by far (on the days that he came to class).  LONG LIVE THE MILLENIUM SERIES THEME SONG!   G4: SRT   There were days when I was so crammed for time in SRT: finishing layouts on deadline day, going to Model UN meetings, AP study sessions, random conversations between Layman and Ammar about "The Apprentice," interviewing students for my news stories, hanging out in the Speech SRT... The list goes on and on.    R5/R8: Chemistry  I hated this class. Webster was a very good teacher in my opinion, but I just cannot stand the subject. I only have two more chem periods EVER! I'm soooooooo happy! Get me away from the slack-off juniors! (Note: Not all of the juniors slacked off [i.e. Kaitlin and Kendal worked harder than I did]. There were just some who always cheated and refused to do experiments and would not participate at all.)   R6/R5: French   I'm going to miss French next year. Ash, you'll have to fill me in on all that you guys do... I really liked French, but with two filled elective spots and a technology credit to get, I have no room for it next year. (Stupid technology requirement...) I also hope that when I apply for Japanese courses in college that they don't think that I quit French for the heck of it. I wanted to get to French V, but it's either quit French or not graduate because of a missing requirement. I loved French... Vive la France!!   R7: Chamber Orchestra  Orchestra was enjoyable. There were some days when practice seemed to drag on much longer than it needed to, but it's all worth it now. Besides, now that we're done with our concert, we have free time, which means NORTH STAR TIME! My last period of the year will be orchestra, which means I'll most likely be in here typing away for the last time as a sophomore. *tear* I'll miss it, but it's time to embrace change!   R8/G2: Algebra II  I came in dreading Algebra II and came out with a whole semester of A+'s. So much for thinking I'd fail the class.  That's my year. FUN! Hehe... OOH! My food's in! Time to eat, watch "Austin Powers," and work on my Algebra II review. My final's tomorrow. :(  "Happy Towne: a self-sufficient community where the people are fed with the area's sole food source - a giant PopTart."

On sat: ~went to rehearsal for IACA's (indianapolis association of chinese americans) lion dance that we will be performing during the indy 500 parade. any of you alls going, maybe i'll see ya there!!! ~went to what seemed like a billion places to fill out job applications like..target, united artist theatres, YMCA... ~went home and fell asleep at 7 on sun: ~woke up at 10 ~walked aimlessly around my house looking for something to do till 11:15 ~worked from 11:30-4 ~got a haircut ~came home ~worked on finals project for photography ~get online  ...isn't my life just so exciting?!?!?! lol...now it's almost midnight and i've gotta study for a vocab quiz tomorrow...has anybody learned anything in english this year?!?!?! cuz i know i haven't!!!

      No, that is not an Ayu song.  For those who don't know, I was at a Key Club event (KC Weekend) in Ashley, Ohio over the weekend. It was... an experience. That's about as well as I can sum it up in a sentence. Here's the longer - but still brief - version:  Friday - got out of school at 9 (during Lyceum) - arrived at Kiwanis International at 10 - left Indy in one of two vans (I sat beside Janice... :P) - realized in the middle of our journey that I had brought shorts, but hadn't brought any shoes other than my boots - refused Janice's offer to use her credit card to buy me extra shoes - 2-hour District meeting while in the two vans via walkie-talkie; VERY heated debates - arrived at Recreation Unlimited around 3 in the afternoon - was pelted with hail as Janice ran around, laughing and screaming in joy - tornado was spotted nearby; hid with the rest of the Indy Key Clubbers in a storage closet filled with dishes and Capri Suns; while in hiding I quizzed Janice with her Interdisc flashcards - power went out - improvised and said, "HEY! We have chairs, people, a piano, and Janice. Why not play musical chairs?" - lost dreadfully at musical chairs - ate dinner - power came back on - opening session; was lectured on people's behaviors and how to improve my character; formed teams (I was in the "B Sharps," Janice was part of "The Awesomer-est" group) - went to bed at 12:30  Saturday - got up at 6 (7 their time) - got in the shower - power went out again - took shower in the dark - found another Indy Key Clubber with an extra pair of shoes IN MY SIZE! - cut myself shaving with my crappy razor so that I could wear the shorts :( - went on the challenge course (best part of the trip!) - nicknamed Steph "Treehugger" - Bar-B-Q dinner (blech!) - watched Janice play on the kiddie playground; joined in - evening session; made the "perfect community" - my group did "Athens" and had Japanese stick people shaking hands (with English subtitles, of course!) - walked 10 minutes to a campfire by the lake just to sit for 20 minutes, talk, and come back before curfew - went to bed at 1 in the morning because of an impromptu Indiana District meeting at midnight  Sunday - breakfast - packed - ending session - left Ohio - another hour-long meeting via walkie-talkie - stopped at KFC on the way home, Janice and I bought the $19.99 Picnic Meal (large bucket of chicken, three large sides, six biscuits, and a 1/2 gallon drink, which Janice didn't want and gave to me) and shared it; got strange glances from other customers - District meeting/debate in KFC - spilled half the drink on my lap an hour and a half away from Indy; sat there soaked - drove home  And that was my weekend. Think of if I had not put everything in a bulleted list!  "Happy Towne: a self-sufficient community where the people are fed with the area's sole food source - a giant PopTart."

      It's been a crazy week! But, now, it is finished. That makes me happy. I won't go into all the details of what made this week crazy, just know that it has been. In other news: US history- That is the best class ever! All of you who are taking Interdisc next year are missing out on Collier. He's awesome! Because I turened my paper in 4 days early, I got my grade back already. 5 hours sitting at the computer really works! I got a 94%!!!! WOOHOO!!!! That makes me so incredibly happy! Then we did our presentation. He said, "I don't want to give you a 100% quite yet, because I wnat to see how the other groups do to have something to base it off of." He also said that "this project presentation would be a hard one for the other groups to beat." He also said, "You shouldn't be worried about your grades at all." Yay! THis makes me happy! So very happy! :-D Yay for a wonderful end to US history!!! YAY! for Walt Disney! Okay...I am not going to be vague about this next part because someone *cough*OLIVIA*cough* would pry it out of me anyways, so yeah.  Mom got her tooth pulled last night. It was, as she called it, the first one behind the pointy one on the passenger side. Well, she had to have someone take her, because she was given not only painkillers, but valium. I told her that because I only had an English test that day, I could bring her that afternoon, after my US presentation. She said that my father offered to do it, because he was coming to get Chelsea and Chris anyways. Anyways, I got home from school and I was working on a chemistry experiment in the kitchen, when mom got home. Guess who she invited in? Well, I figured there was no way out, especially if you've been in my house, to get to my room from the kitchen without having to pass through the living room anyways. So I stayed in the kitchen working. (Actually, at this point, I was banging a a spoon against a huge block of ice.) Anyways, my dad was reading out loud what my mother could and could not have and how to take care of her. I figured this was something that could be important so *shock* *surprise* *gasp* I went and sat down in the livingroom. And don't even ask if I was nice. I wasn't mean. Yeah, so I sat there, listened, and even, *gasp* asked questions. I then was talking to mom about how I spilled NaOH on myself today in chem. I even included him in the conversation. And then the Chris got home and he and the kids left. See? I finally talked to him, and it only took me 11 months!  Now, I assume, that YouNa (and many Compendium people, except for Nathan) has no idea why I wouldn't be speaking to my father, so I will give her the uber short version: He beat up my mom. He threatened me. That's the short version. The long version is quite long, and I don't want to get into it.  Ah, then to all the Aching Sushi people, except sadly YouNa, for you are not here. In case non of you read notes please read and respnd: "Hi! This is Michael over at Compendium. We've got a couple of Cons coming up and would love to have you guys there. Unless you're dreadfully bored of Government and funny stuff, WestWingCon (Part 1) might be your best option. There are others if that doesn't work out." Well, that's all.   No time to say hello, goodbye! I’m late, I’m late, I’m late!

      Wow! I can't believe how quickly this year has gone by!!! It seems like it just started and we were all bogged down with homework!!!  Ashley's review of her classes this year:**WARNING- RAMBLING AHEAD!!!! MUCH RAMBLING***** Latin G1/R7: Well, I finally got out of G1 Latin!!! (First time EVER!) I can't really say that R7 is any better though...It's quite evil after French, but what can I say?? We have learned so much meaningless stuff in that class this year, and I will be happy to move up! Woohoo! for Latin III!  Algebra II G2/R5: Well, after having Frankum for three semesters, I was happy to get into Sachs class, and for some reason, I am doing better! We've expanded on so much this year, it's amazing. I can say though, that I still have no idea how to do augmented matrices. Please, don't ever ask me to do one. They are evil, but I understnad more of the material, so yeah. Advanced Speech/Honors English 10 G3: Both are pointless. Not more I can say. I hate(d) both. The teachers are nice, I just haven't really learned anything. argh. SRT: Wow, this has been the best SRT ever. Cash is the best SRT teacher. Let's see...highlights...Oh, there was the time of the lightsaber duels. That was great fun.  Chem R1/G2: Okay. Ha. I still have no idea what polar and nonpolar are....first semester was THE WORST CLASS EVER. When your teacher doesn't understand variables in algebra problems...wow...you know something's wrong...This semester's been good, except for my daily fights with my lab partner...argh.  French R6: THis still remains the best class ever, and I will be sad to leave Mme M.'s class. I love it so much, but I am looking forward to French with Mme H next year. It's going to be a blast!!! Question to LN people: How many are taking French IV next year?? Anyways, I love this class, it's great!!!!!! Speaking of which, guess what Mme McKenna's loaning me?? That's right! LE PETIT NICOLAS!!!!!! Woohoo! Not as wonderful as Le Petit Prince, but close! It's so cute!!!!! Another one to read, people!! Theater R7/R8: I hated this class for most of the first semester, but now it's one of my favorites! (Behind French, of course!) I have learned so much in there! It's wonderful! APUSH R8/G1: Mr. COllier is the best! I love being the only sophmore in US history! I'm special. :-D It's a great class, and I will laugh if one of you get my book next year! The book is absoultly BORING, but Ap is so much fun. I would have loved to do interdisc, but I wouldn't have changed APUSH for anything now though! It's been great! Ha. There's a quick overview of all my classes! I am so ready for next year! :-) Take psychology people! (That way I'm not alone!!)  Anyways...yeah.  Let's see.... Come to the theater showcase!!! It's Saturday at 7 pm in the little theater.  Well, I am still on a sugar high. Woohoo for SUGAR!!! :-D That's all for now!!  No time to say hello, goodbye! I’m late, I’m late, I’m late!

      It took me until a couple days ago to discover the notes that you can leave on entries! SO, after reading them, I have one thing to say: Thank you Nathan!!! That was so sweet of you to say! :-D  Ah, so THAT'S why Nathan wasn't at the choir banquet. Silly me. :-P (He won an award, too!) It was a great time! I also went to the Quill & Scroll/journalism banquet last night, which wasn't quite as meaningful, but oh well. I'm not going to be on staff next year, anyway. (I'm still debating whether or not that's a good choice, but I think it'll be better in the end.)  Speaking of which, I still haven't turned in my schedule changes. Urgh. Stupid technology credits that don't fit anywhere on my schedule. Why do they insist on making me take some class that I don't even need, when I could take another class that is much more challenging/stimulating? WHY don't they count photography as a technology credit, or even yearbook? Since when are computers and cameras not technology? Grr...  Sarah, you told me you would post pictures from the party! I WANT TO SEE! ;-)  Geometry was actually fun today (everyone remember this, because you will NEVER AGAIN hear me say that math is "fun"!). We finished working on our tessellation projects (which, for me, involved coloring), ate ice cream cones (I had three!) and I listened to my CD player. If only school was like that more often...

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY ASH!  (Haha... I don't think I got it out of my system on Tuesday.)  That party was SO nerve-wracking for me. (At least, planning was.) I had been pondering the idea of a surprise party for some time,  but at about 9 o'clock on Monday evening I realized,  Hey! This could actually work!  So, Tuesday morning I rushed around the school, trying to find Jane, Alison, and Olivia to tell them about the party. I found Jane. That was it. (Technically, I also found Nathan, but as he was glued to Ashley AS ALWAYS, I couldn't tell him until later.) I had one person. ONE. Do you have any idea how worried I was then??  Luckily, it was a red day, and so I saw Alison in Chamber Orchestra. Unfortunately, it WAS a red day, so I had no way of contacting Olivia or Nathan. However, I sent out my lil' messengers (Ali and Jane) to find Olivia and Jonah and pass on the word. I would have tracked down everyone myself, but I had an orthodontist appointment during R7/Lunch and part of my R8 chem class.   I came home at 3:15, knowing that I had to get all of the supplies, the cake, the pizza, and the people organized by six o'clock. Not to mention I had to clean the house...   I decided that people were the most important at that time, and so I called Olivia to see if the word had gotten to her yet. It had, but because of the choir banquet she wasn't able to come.   Darn it!  I thought.  That rules out Nathan, too.  However, it was going to be a somewhat small party in the first place, so only having three guests (including myself) wouldn't be that bad of a celebration.   I then called Ash to make sure that she still was free. (*ahem* The "Oh! I forgot! I have to babysit!" incident from a few weeks ago...) She was, so I told her I was going to bring her over and we'd do something special, like movies or something. I also told her that Jane might come over to work on Meeting of the Minds with me. We got to talking about other things for a while before she suddenly says, "Someone wants to call you, Sarah! Gotta go! Bye!"   I was scared then.  But it was Nathan, who called for directions to my house just in case he could skip the choir banquet. About an hour after that, Jane arrived and we headed off to pick up Ashley. I was so nervous going over to pick her up because 1) I had never done a surprise party before, 2) it was an extremely last-minute thing, and 3) the Comstocks (MBoys to you, Jane!) and Alison had not arrived yet. Jane witnessed my paranoia. Just ask her, Ash!  We picked her up, had some conversation (with half-lies and such to keep her unsuspecting) and brought her back to the house. I walked in carrying the pizza (which I had told her was just for us three) and saw Nathan, Jonah and Alison hiding in the formal dining room.   DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW RELIEVED I WAS?!?!  Then came Jane's wonderful "Alison?" and everyone popped out. The party began, blah, blah, blah... I'll post pictures later. (I'm mailing some to you, YouNa, with your birthday present!)   There were so many things that could have gone wrong that didn't... Other than the fact that it rained and we couldn't play with bubbles. :(  That's a basic summary of the "behind-the-scenes" planning that I had to do to get the party going. To me, it was a success. I don't care if anyone else had fun, but as long as Ash had a good time, I'm happy. That  was  the whole point. But you guys do know that I'm expecting one for my 16th, don't ya? :P  "Ziggy, stop living vicariously through the cat!" "Meow?"

      i'm posting again!!! cuz i'm bored and i'm in english!! hahaha. im' surprised, i'm posting twice in a row...like..i mean day after day...i usually never do that. you guys know that yesterday was supposed to be like national not get gas day so that the gas companies would be screwed over therefore, gas prices would be cheaper. my mom said that they actually said somethign on the news about that..but then i heard in my SRT that it wasn't true. nevertheless, my mom didn't get gas just in case it was true because $2 per gallon is just way too expensive.  you know what i think they should do...make a car that runs on candy...or sugar!!!! we've got plenty of that!!!  i heard on ripley's believe it or not that they actually made a car that ran on pond scum. pretty sick, but if it works and it's cheaper, i'd go for it. also there was some news on people stealing used grease from restaurants which i also heard could be used for gas. so many different uses. that was completely random. lol. bell about to ring. blog y'allz later. it's thursday...so close to friday!!! :-D Ziggy! Stop living vicariously through the cat! Meow....?

      Okay, so long story made short: I LOVE YOU!!!! YOU ARE THE ABSOLUTE BEST EVER!!!!!! Last nighgt was so much fun!  Okay long story made short with that: I came home from school, did some things around here which included starting my thank you notes,(yes, I do give thank you notes. Deal with it.) and etc. I talked to Sarah who told mem not to go anywhere because she was coming to get me at 6ish Jonah then called me to ask for Sarah's phone number. I then, because I am me, fell asleep on the couch. Around 6:30 I woke up and realized that someone was calling my name, and of course, it was Sarah. I ran and got ready, then we (Sarah, Jane and I) went to Sarah's house. When we got there, they went in the house first, (and I was still oblivious...) and then Jane said, "Alison!" I was like Alison's here? Then, I saw Nathan. I was like, Nathan's here? Then Jonah popped out.  I said, Jonah's here???? To be honest, I was quite suprprised to see Jonah and Nathan. It was a wonderful surproise though. And yeah. Much hilarity happened from there. Sarah has pictures, which she's told me that she'll give me copies of. She even has pictures of Nathan picking me up! First time for everything, right?? Anyways, that was the overview of my birthday. I was even given a French cake! woohoo! Joyeux Anniversaire!!! :-D It was much fun, and I couldn't ask for a better birthday. :-D I must now to that theater thing. Come to the theater showcase Saturday evening!!! Please!!!   Ziggy! Stop living vicariously through the cat!!! Meow......??????

      you the gurl ashley!!!! happy sweet sixteen yesterday...but i already said that to you! u liked your "surprise b-day party"? lol...if only jane didn't say, "alison?" j/k!!! anywayz, i don't thikn you'll feel sixteen until you get your license and you have a car that you can drive. i've been 16 for almost half a year and i still do'nt feel it...but now that i'm thinking bout it, i'll be 17 in 7 months....so scary!!! on that french test...has she posted that on webgrades yet? cuz when i just checked right now....my latest quiz score was 36/40...so if that was the test...not bad for missing so many. i not so worried bout that test but i am gonna be so stressed out for the final. her finals are always so hard even though it's pretty much all multiple choice.  good luck to everyone that has finals...which is all of us!! lol...hehehe to sarah and youna though, i heard of boa...you know that they gave her plastic surgery cuz the people that advertise her and stuff thought that she had too much baby fat and that she was too young looking! i mean, she's only like 16 or something!!! give the girl a break. i do like her songs though, and that gurl can dance!!! and remember everyone, jane's and sarah's birthdays are coming up!!! the oldest thing in my fridge...where do i begin. you should never ask an asian that...cuz you take one look in the freezer and you're gonna be like...i don't even wanna start. i probably have frozen meat in one of the 3 freezers in my house that are still from when i just moved here....10 years ago...cuz in our chinese household, we believe that everythign can be preserved in a freezer which is exactly what we do.  no matter how much freezerburn there is on it, we still cook it...and then when it turns out that the freezer burn is really that bad, we then throw it away and then dig somehwere. after a couple years, that stuff accumulates and the old stuff gets pushed to the back and therefore, our fridge has no room which is why we have to buy multiple ones. after a while, no one wants to touch the freezer therefore, nothing gets thrown away...what a lovely family i've got:-D btw, sry for not posting so much but my internet at home isn't working so the only time that i can get online is on the computer at school or at someone else's house. so sry but i'll try to get on as much as possible. Ziggy! Stop living vicariously through the cat! Meow....?

Well, You know that the tables have turned when your theater grade is way higher than your French and Latin grade averaged. (First time for everything!) Wow...so people actually remembered it was my birthday today...that's scary. I got roses from the McKennas, and other assorted things, which make me happy. AND I got a pear! Yay! YUM! I have yet to eat it htough. Actually, that is what I am going to do in a minute...:-D Well...not much more here. Just thought that I would post because I am very happy today!

      *blushes* I knew Ashley's birthday was coming up, but I didn't get the chance to nail down the actual date, so...HAPPY BIRTHDAY ASHLEY!!! Hopefully enough people actually remembered (haha) that they could make it memorable for you! And hey, who said I would have pried you about the letter from your dad? (OK, I probably would have, but hey, give me credit. I know *SOME* things have to stay personal.) Hope you have a great day!  Choir banquet tonight -- should be exciting! I always love being with choir people, and who doesn't like catered dinners and awards ceremonies? (Well, granted, not all awards ceremonies are great, but choir ones are better than most.)  Since I just posted, nothing else to say. TTYL!

      Yes, I know, it's not part of Ayumi's repertoire, but...  IT'S ASHLEY'S BIRTHDAY!  We should all speak in French today, in honor of Ash. (Nous devrions parler en francais aujourd'hui parce que c'est son anniversaire!)  "Ziggy, stop living vicariously through the cat!" "Meow...?"

      Woohoo! *dances* I'm almost 16! Woohoo! And yes, my dearest red day friends, I don't believe I told any of you.... hee hee! Too late now!!! Bwahaha....unless you are Sarah....evil Sarahsey. ANd evil Boggs! (He said that he's going to "wildly embarrass me!" Mean Boggs!!) Ah well...such is life.  For my birthday Mom brought me shopping. yay! I now have 3 new shirts and a pair of jeans! yay! Now, let me explain the bottom part again... Sarah is convinced that my African Grey parrot is living vicariously through my cats...he kinda meows like them....ah well. He's cute. A bit more stupid than a box of chemically engineered smart rocks, but HEY! That's okay! I love him all the same. Points to the person who can name the singer he's named after!!!! (No answering Sarah!) Anyways... Yeah. Apparently, I have no clue what is happening on my birthday...something about abducting me...(Oh! Abducting comes from the Latin ab (from) and duco, ducere, to lead....wow. It's taken me that long to figure that out.)  Oh, and btw, my father sent me a birthday card..... "As I wrote  you at Christmas, I hope that during the years  we had together I contributed at least something  to your success, maturity and integrity. You are  truly a remarkable and admirable young woman.  "  Uh...yeah....not sure what to make of it. Just thought some of you would like to know so you wouldn't have to pry later. *cough*OLIVIA*cough* lol  Well I am off!   Ziggy! Stop living vicariously through the cat! Meow!!!

      Sarah's in heaven...  I found a site with samples of songs from about 100 J-pop/K-pop/C-pop artists. Evan referred Suzuki Ami to me, but I just realized, after playing two songs, that she can't sing. It's okay, Boggs. You were just trying to help. At least he doesn't listen to her himself. HOWEVER, I am now addicted to ZONE and all the rest of the all-girl bands.   Hey, YouNa? Do you listen to BoA? I know how popular she is over in South Korea, and I REALLY like her music, especially her Japanese songs. ("ID Peace B!" YEAH!) I've also started listening to Hyori and Fin.K.L.   I received a *wonderful* present from Arae this morning. :P It's a self-help book on dating. I still don't know whether to take that as a compliment or an insult. I'm leaning toward the latter. (Plus, the fact that Ash's mother picked it out for me makes me wonder. Hmmm.... Any hidden schemes from your mother, Ash? Is she considering me and Jean-Luc? :P)  Ahh... I love Utada Hikaru. (Random thought running through my brain at the moment.)  Since the last QotD did not receive any responses, I'm postponing the next one until... I have no idea when. Just felt like typing that. I'm in a restless mood. Deal with it.  For those of you in C lunch tomorrow, I won't be there. I have an orthodontist appointment at noon, so I'll be leaving in the middle of orchestra. Sorry!   Shout-outs:  Jane: POST! I already talked to you in person this morning about it, so come online and post! Omo: Yay for Olivia! You posted! Hopefully you'll set an example to others and they'll begin to make time for OMAS! Ashley: Thank your mother for me! Alison: We need you posting, too! YouNa: Miss ya! Get online and blog some more! I miss talking to you!  "Ziggy! Stop living vicariously through the cat!"  "Meow...?"

      Clap for me, I'm posting again! (Haha, you know you love it.) Anyhoo, sorry about the lack of posts, but I definitely have had limited time on the 'net lately, and I also refuse to write in online diaries during yearbook, so...  Anyway, had a great weekend. Friday night I did homework (so that wasn't the great part). Saturday was spent at a Girl Scout campout. It's called Junior Jam, because all the Junior Girl Scouts (grades 4-6) from the area come to compete in different kinds of games. I'm a Senior Scout, so I got to be a judge. I was an art judge, which could have been really cool, if I'd had better events. Little trivia quizzes aren't so much fun. Oh well, at least I got to see the winners of the other events. That night my troop left to go to Nashville (Indiana, not Tennessee!) for dinner. We ate at the Hob Knob, which is a homey little place that mostly sells soup, salad, and sandwiches. We also bought fudge :o), poked around in some of the shops, and played putt-putt. Unfortunately I had to go home that night, because I was at church ALL DAY yesterday and I didn't want to exhaust myself before then!  Nine -- count them, NINE -- days till summer! (And Amaris, no summer gym this year! YAY!) Oh I can't wait! School and life in general haven't treated me that great this year, so I'm anxious for a nice, fun, stress-free break from it all!  BURGLE! :o)

      Just in case you all are like me and woke up thinking that you missed g1, g2, and a good 1/3 of g3 already. Only I would do that, lol.  Well, it's official. I am one of the biggest dorks around. I couldn't sleep last night, due to much caffine and sugar, so I sat up and did my Latin homework followed by my French homework. And I don't have those classes until Tuesday! Last night I went to see Van Helsing. Good movie. Predictable to the point of boredness though. Ah well. Good special effects though! And I liked the music a lot. It was really good, I thought. Neat guitar music.  :-D Two more weeks of school!! yay! btu no!!! at the same time..... Par tof me is looking forward to this whole IB thing. YAY! for challenges! but part ofme is not. BOO! for homework! Evil! But I think that overall it should be fun. There are some people I really like who are doing this with me, and there are others that I wish would. But I won't mention names. ahem. But I do understand the point of it's restrictive on your schedule. Eh, I was planning on taking a language anyways so, why not continue Latin, right? I'm only really worried about pre cal and physics. Ah, well. I'll get over it. That essay is freaking me out too. Ah well. I have time to think and meditate and stress.  Moving on... Speaking of essays, I finished my US one. WOOHOO! That means that I only have to work on theater this week. It's not a great essay, but it's better than my social darwinist essay, which I might just post on here for you people to read. I didn't take it seriously what so ever, and therefore it's hilarious in parts. I did no research. I even have the sentances, "Why would they name something   that  ?? That's just silly!" One of my firends read it and laughed. She told me that I would never get a good grade on it. I got a perfect score. bwahaha. The moral of this story? There really isn't one.  Social Darwinist link: http://teenopendiary.com/entryview.asp?authorcode=B703098&entry=10075 Well, that's all for now.   BURGlE!!!!!

      YO! Sorry... Had to start singing it. Wonderful, get-up-and-dance type of song. And who could beat Ayu's open-stadium performance of it when she threw giant-sized balloons at the fans?? (Jane can agree with me on this one. She actually saw it.)  From yesterday morning to mid-afternoon, I was at North Central, helping with their Special Olympics. My job was to write the names of the winners on the backs of their ribbons. At first, I was assigned to only do 12 stacks of 1st-4th place ribbons, but after it was all over with, I ended up having done close to 300... Can you say "hand cramp?"   Other than that, nothing incredibly fantastic has happened to me this weekend. I spent the rest of the day yesterday watching "Chasing Liberty" - which was cheesy, but when you're bored that doesn't matter - and "In America," which was such a beautiful movie. I loved it!   And seeing as how the QotD has actually succeeded in getting responses, I'll keep it going.  "And now, for Sunday's Question of the Day!"   What is the oldest food item in your fridge?   My answer : My mother is a neat-freak, much like I am, so our fridge is cleaned out once a month. However, while I don't have 7-year-old cottage cheese in my fridge (Only Jane will get that reference), I do have my Japanese junk food from North Star's trip to Washington D.C. last November. It is strawberry-flavored. At least, it was.   There. I posted. Now Ashley won't have to worry about double-posting. AND THE REST OF YOU, POST! *cough* Olivia, Jane *cough* If I can find time to post as much as I do, y'all can do the same! So end the silence!  BURGLE!!!

      Therefore, I am putting it off. Or at least for a few hours. And I will now answer YouNa's question about Latin.... Latin is a dead language, meaning no one speaks it anymore. It is the language that French, Spanish, and Italian stem from. It is also the class that I have right after French, which sucks. Let's see...some examples of Latin would be.... Cogito ergo sum. I think therefore I am Vini, Vidi, Vici. I came I saw I conquered. Ars gratias Artis. Art for the sake of art. (points go to the person who can name where that's from!) Semper fidelis. Always Faithful SPQR...something something que Romae Eh, that's all I can think of that would make sense. Anyways.... Yay for 13.5 hours of sleep! Woohoo! :-D And YouNa, burgle comes from my inablity to use the English language. (Read the first paragraph of my last post. It'll make more sense.) Well, I might post later. By the way YouNa, what's this Festival? I don't understand....  BURGLE!!!

      Whoa, so many things happened while I was busy for festival. I can't catch up with you!T-T (first, what is BURGLE?!)  Sarah, my favorite key is delete key. Because I can erase everything with it!! hahaha!! I love destroying!! (But I regreted when I erased my report file accidentally)   My least favorite key is insert key. Firstly, I don't like the word 'insert'(insult), and secondly, insert key is very annoying. You know why.    And, and, My favorite disney movie is...(I don't like disney movies)...uh...Beauty and the Beast? That's the only one movie made by disney I watched. I'm not sure I got your question right Ashley.   So far, I like Miyajaki Hayao's animation.    I'm following Jane's advice for not watching Labrynth. Instead, I ask my brother to get Matrix3    Hey, it's really good to see you again, Alison, Olivia!   Olivia, did I tell you? One of my new best friend in Korea reminds me of you. Her voice, way of talking, and many other things. And her English name is Olivia!! I was very amazed!   I want to see Ali's picture. I already saw photos of Sarah, Jane, Olivia, and Ashely.        My class will be dancing in HIpHop style on May 22nd. We're practicing for 5~6 hours a day. I'm totally exhausted. We have no weekend these days. Ahhhh. Festival is killing me..!    Bye.    P.S : Do you learn Latin? I read Einstein got F in Latin, but the book didn't explain what 'Latin' is.

      Well folks, it rained and yeah, my basement is again, squishy. Argh. Double argh. Evil basement.  Well, our theater scene went much better than I planned, no offense. It's not that, it just seems as if she liked it more than I thought she was going to, for some reason.  Ah well, it makes me happy all the same. :-D Oh, more about the scenes. We went third. A BUNCH of groups had to have their scripts with them! That's kinda sad, since we had sooo long to work on them. I thought that a lot of them could have been really good if the people had worked on them. Ah well.  Tomorrow I do plan on doing my US history paper. Without fail. It must be done. I at least want to get my outline done, so that I can easily write it this week. I really don't want to have to write it on my birthday though. That would totally suck.  I also have to start that theater thing...argh. I'll worry about that later, because that won't take me nearly as long ot write as US history. That is going to take a while. Argh. Somehow 4 page paper on Supreme Court decisions doesn't scream YAY! WRITE ME! HURRY! I'LL BE FUN!!! But whatever. I got to choose the topic too. This was the only thing that I KNEW that our libray would have anything on.  (Our library is one of the worst school libraries EVER. They don't usually have anything useful on anything you're looking for. They had no books on the practice of psychology, psychology itself, and there was something else, although I can't remember what. Ah well. it just frustrates me to learn that we have The Federalist papers, but nothign on psy.) Anyways... On to the question of the day: To be honest, I don't have a favorite key on my keyboard. I might also add theat I am three keys short since Ziggy, my wonderful African grey and the only one of my birds so far that hasn't bitten Nathan, tore my F1, F2, and esc key off, adn I now have no idea where they are. SO yeah.  Speaking of birds, Angel apparenly hates Nathan considering she jumped off the couch, and bit him fairly hard on the face as she clung to his back flapping her wings wildly. (Did I miss anything, Nathan?) To bring some of you up to date on my birds, because they are my life lol, I have an umbrella cockatoo named Angel, a servere macaw, (aka a pirate bird) named Tucker, (such a samrt name for a bird, right?) a red headed conure named Beaker, and an African grey, whom I love very very very very much named Ziggy, from The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. (Points go to anyone (besides Nathan and/or Sarah) who can name the artist of that CD.  Alison, French wasn't all that bad. I mean, okay, so you might have messed up the plusque parfait. Eh. No big deal. You'll pick it up.  Just remember: Imparfait for eitehr etre or avoir + the past participle of the verb. And please, French people who go to my school, PLEASE DON'T KILL ME! I've already been killed once this week, and I have a paper due on Friday!!  I can't afford to come back from the grave in a big musical number again. I don't want to discuss the quiz any further. It was only out of 60 points.  Anyways...Ashley is tired. Ashley wants to sleep. yay for Ashley! Who's having trouble spelling her name! lol I leave you with now:  BURGLE!!!!!!

      I have no rewritten this post about three times because this computer is being stupid....AHHHH!!! But about french since we seem to talk so much about french, I thought i'd give my title the "wonderful" movie that we saw in french about the guy with the secret identity. i think...no i know that i completely failed the french test cuz i couldn't remember how to do plus-que parfait. i'm a failure...btw...no need to stress on that fact...i know well:-p   Summer is here and it's so warm and nice outside...now we can save gas just by opening our windows since gas is also so expensive. School's gonna be over soon and i'm gonna miss y'alls that i only see at school. we must get together and do summer stuff...like go swimming and shop for summer stuff.  i need a tan so bad...i pasty and that means i'm not gonna be wearing shorts for a while. as to answering sarah's question, i love the period key. i dunno why, but i usually use it a lot when i'm trying cuz i love to link my ideas together.  but if the question was more broad, i'd pick all the keys that you'd need to make all those really cute smiley faces. isn't this so cute?:Þ hehehe BURGLE!!!!!

      ...as in the fact that the school week will be over in just a few hours, and sophomore year will be permanently over (for hopefully all of us!) in a little more than two weeks. YES!  Sarah's in a happy mood. :P Can ya guess why??   YESASIA PACKAGE!   My last one until California. Thank goodness... less than a month and I can go online shopping again!   Call me stupid, but I just realized that my computer's DVD player is VCD compatible. Goodness, I'm slow. But in addition to that, it also means that I can stop annoying Mom with Ayumi's concerts. (Of course, I said "I can," not "I will." :P)   Hayes needs more food in the Snack Shop. I'm starving here!!!!   I was planning on posting and creating a new ending scheme, but 1) I was busy and could not post, and 2) Ash beat me to it. Of course, I would have chosen "Burgle!" Either that or Jonah's response to the subtitled Chinese movie we watched in World History: "Chairman Mao portraits: The gifts that keep on giving." (It was something to that effect.)   The Honors Program was indeed last night, and I was so completely surprised when I realized that I was being honored for Academic Top Ten. While I had known that I rounded out the Top Ten lineup at the last spot, I knew that Jane had a higher GPA than I did, yet she was not awarded. 0_o?? I only have a 3.973, and she has a 3.98-something, I think. Oh, well. Maybe something happened in this semester that brought me up. (Like my five A+'s in one six weeks, maybe?) I have no idea. All I know is that the people who were included in Top Ten surprised me. I won't say anything here as to hurt anyone's feelings, but it simply made me a bit angry. Ah, well. That's what happens when you hold grudges.   Is it time for the "Question of the Day?" I'll answer my own question and say "By George, you're right! It IS time for the QotD!"   Question of the Day : What is your favorite key on a computer keyboard?    My answer : The "Caps Lock" key. It makes it so much easier to type more "emotional" sentences in all caps for those of us who don't use the "touch typing" method.   BURGLE!!!

      Ah, yes. Does anyone, besides me remember that? Let me explain... One fine day we were sitting in the best class ever, a.k.a. French III, and we were going over new vocabualry. We were learning about petty crimes in France in French. Ah, well. We got the word cambioler, which is to burglerize. I, being the wonderfully smart persont that I am, when asked what it meant, used my exceptional English skills and replied burgle. Hence, our new term, which can be used as a verb, adjective, and if I remember correctly, even a noun.  Ah, yes, let's now discuss, the Honors Awards Night thing. Out of the first two levels of Latin, I was the first person to show up. That is quite sad. They went through all of Latin I, and I was the only one from Latin II. Ah, well, I got the award, so yay for me. Although, unless undre penalty of death, I might not go to another. (Or if I am receiving something that I care about.) Ah well. It was okay. It could have been worse. I remember that the ones in middle school dragged on for HOURS! Yeah...but anyways... Woohoo. I figured out how to do chemistry and I sucessfully completed my lab paper without actually doing the lab. Don't ask how.  I'm also apparently speaking for US history for 7 minutes over the music of Walt Disney. That should be intersting. At the very least. I also have to start that paper...I plan to start it on Saturday...unless I get distracted or decide to start theater...hmm...well...That whole papragraph was useless to everyone save myself.  Ah, and now to Olivia- I could send her an email...but eh. Anyways...1.) Thanks for joining! I see my "gentle reminder" did well. 2.) Title scheme...If I wanted to think, I could most likely name everyone's but I'd rather not. Ask me tomorrow in French. 3.) End with what everyone else ends with. Sarah and I thought we would change to BURGLE!!! because we were bored at lunch and Alison said she wasn't posting until it was changed for she couldn't think of anything to change it to....we change it periodically. So change it periodically. I believe that's all...anything else, I see you in French class, so then would be a good time to ask. Well, that should be all for now. I do realize that this was really random and pointless, but get over it!  BURGLE!!!!

      Sheesh, you people can stop sending me on guilt trips for not joining now. ;-P Hi everyone! I finally had the chance to sign up, so here I am. So what's this about a title scheme? My titles are usually whatever pops into my head (and lately I haven't bothered to use them at all, at least not always), so I'm not sure if I should have a scheme...? (Unless random counts as a scheme, haha.)  So, about me...I'm 16, a sophomore (soon to be junior! YAY!) at LN where I'm in choir and on the yearbook staff. I'm involved in way too many extracurriculars for my own good -- not that you'd know, because school currently swallows up all of my time! If I'm not stressing out over homework, you can find me online, with friends, or doing something with music. I have an older brother who's a freshman in college (well, technically sophomore, now) and a cat named Harry Potter (NOT Hewlett Packard! :-P). Uh...is that enough? lol  In other news, the choir concert was last night, and it was AMAZING! It was a pops theme (radio hits) and I think it was the best choir show I've been in. All of the choirs had great songs, and the audience seemed to be really into it. It was so exciting! Sad, too, though, because all of the seniors are leaving. *tear*  Well, I'll stop for now. See you later, my fellow bloggers! :o)

      Bwahaha. I have been on a sugar high and very happy all day today, excpe t maybe in Algebra because I still don't quite understand it.  Yes, and just so that you know, I died last night, but I came back, because I actually didn't die, and so yeah. Well, I more or less finished my chemistry, but I have no clue how to predict the boiling points for misc. solutions. Anyone care to explain???? (It's for Lab 44, Amaris. Ugh. I never actually  did  the lab, but I understand it. Ah well. THat's life I petition that we change Your mother is an aardvark. Next person to post, DO SO. :-) Gentle reminder. :-) ANYWAYS... You all make me sad, with the exception of Nathan, because none of you can follow directions!!! (And Sarah, because she already told me that day at lunch.) WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE DISNEY MOVIES???? ALison, Jane, Olivia, Nathan, Sarah, and Jonah need not answer for they already have. That leaves...YouNa! And so, YouNa, what is your favorite Disney movie??? (And of course anyone else who is reading this and would like to help further my US history cause. Let's call it Manifest Destiny- Revisited, but not quite, which yes, I am aware that it makes no sense at all. Deal.) Ah, and the answer to Sarah's question: None. I hate all Lucky Charms. I hate all cereal. With a passion. I hate it! (Even more than Algebra!!) When I was little twice I found worm-thingies in it, and now I won't eat it at all. yuk!!  I am going to the choir concert tonight. THat was kinda random but not really. Anyways, yeah.  And Sarah, yes, I do need those service hours. I'm going to count the Silly Sarfari place as my action service hours, and woodwind ensemble as my creativity service hours. And so I still need service service hours, if that makes sense, and to most of you, if not all of you that doesn't. Quick recap- IB sucks. Not only does it restrict your schedule, but you also must perform 150 service hours divded equally among Creativity, Action, and Service, abb. as CAS. I have to get thirty hours this summer, next fall, next spring, next summer, and the fall after that. Woohoo. And so yeah. Could you give me the dates of VBS?? That would be a help especially when trying to figure out when I can volunteer this summer at the other place.  Well, that's all for now. Your mother is an aardvark!!

      And speaking of which, Olivia has the obligation of checking her e-mail and joining us!   " Compendium " has just celebrated its 500th post, which includes a blog cameo by MOI! :P Plus, another one of our OMAS bloggers was featured in the 502nd? post.  You know what I say to that: FREE PUBLICITY!  I agree with Ashley. Chemistry is the biggest waste of my time, second only to the awards ceremony "practice" from yesterday. And our class spends about three days per chapter, which is why we were forced to learn Chapters 16 and 17 and could not skip them like everyone else. Of course, the advantage to that is that we understand Chapter 18 a lot better than everyone else, which means less work for us! I can deal with that...   This may be a long entry, since I have basically nothing to do and the other newspaper staffers are watching "Titanic" - which they also did  yesterday  afternoon. Every time I watch it, I just want to curl up in a little ball, hidden somewhere. It's depressing enough to see it once in a lifetime, but this is the fourth time I've been in a room with "Titanic" showing. Goodness.   Let's look at the bright side: at least it's not "The Labyrinth." :P (Okay, Ashley! Pelt me with orange peels now! C'mon!)  I made a new blog layout for my personal blog site. Please don't look at it. It's a VERY rough draft.  Six days (after today) until Ash's 16th!! AWWWWWWW! You DO realize that's a red day? Le francais avec M. Mannweiler? She sooooo needs to sing "Happy Birthday" to you in French. :P Thank goodness I'm a summer baby. I won't have to deal with anyone singing to me in public. Well, except at my church's Vacation Bible School. I've been promoted from "adolescent VBS helper" to "teacher of 4-year-olds" because of my work there for the past two years as a recreation leader and an art helper, respectively. (Hey, Ash? Do you still need any more hours??) I'll be in charge of a group of about 10 kids, leading them to recreation, art, music, storytime, and lunch.   Guess who's my assistant? Mom. Isn't that ironic?   However, two things are different this year that make it even better than in past years: 1) my 4-year-old neighbor Holly is going to come, who is the most adorable thing (she loves Ash and Jane and can even recall their names when looking at my pictures), and 2) IT IS THE WEEK OF MY BIRTHDAY! The last day (June 25th) is a longer afternoon session followed by a cookout and activities! YAY! For once, I won't be sitting home alone on my birthday!  Now, time for (drumroll)... The Question of the Day! What is your favorite marshmallow shape in Lucky Charms and why? (And please do not say "because it's CUTE!" I'm trying to refrain from responses like that, too.)   My answer : I love the four-leaf clover because 1) it's my second-favorite color and 2) it's just so much fun to eat something of that shape. How many times have you eaten something shaped that way (other than a real four-leaf clover itself)? (pause) Ha! See? Told ya!  Tonight I have two Kiwanis induction ceremonies to host (LN and BRHS), so I most likely won't blog again until tomorrow in SRT. (That is, unless I'm teaching Ash chemistry, which would delay my posts until late Thursday night or Friday afternoon.) So, all you other people need to post! (points finger) I want to come back to OMAS and see several posts by everyone!   Your mother is an aardvark. (Can we change this soon, please??)  P.S. Jack just died. How sad.

      Okay, so I now   HATE  chemistry. It is evil. It is the devil. I do not care about acids or bases. I do not. I am sorry. I do not understand. (And because I am giong into physics for IB I doubt that I will need this ever again, or at least ever in high school.)  Ah, and then there is statistics in Algebra. Don't like them either, but I at least understand them.  Anyways... Back to things about which are worth talking.  I will answer Sarah's question. What bugs me the most....? Hmm...Interesting question. Let's see...I hate going over things 50 billion times! Like, in French, we'll spend SO LONG going over something that is SO EASY. We spend weeks on it! (And, that's not really the problem. THe real problem is that people hasven't learned the stuff from first year. By your 3rd year in French, you should be able to come up with a le/la/les or du/de/de l'/ des/ de la.) Same thing in Latin, only see Latin is a slacker class. You can easily do nothing.  But still, I rewally wish that our teachers would push us a bit harder and that we wouldn't spend weeks going over things. Although sometimes the vocabualry mistakes made by the juniors in my Latin class are funny. ( Like getting the word  manus  (hand) mixed up with the word  manibus  which is spirits of the dead. It makes for a great sentance: The pig fled from the spirits of the dead of the slaves.  Okay... I feel better now.  Moving on.... We have a theatre scene due Friday. Nathan and I know our lines forward and backward and we also know each others.  And YAY! Alison joined! Woohoo! My gentle reminder of CHECK YOUR EMIAL AND JOIN US actually worked. I am happy, lol! Now, I need to gentely remind Olivia....hmmmm.... 7 more days until my birthday!! YAY! And then one month after that, I'll be able to drive myself!! And no, Jane I will not be running into you. (More likely, you'll be running into me!) You'd better not though. I can't afford to pay that much for insurance!  Oh, yes. Everyone who reads this, plese post a comment with yoru favorite Disney movie. (Unless of course I already asked you.) :-) We got our projects for US history. Our group is doing Walt Disney :The man and his vision. Yay! Something fun! Not depressing like our last project, The Holocaust. We only get 45 minutes, but we're hoping that Collier lets us go longer considering we're the only ones presenting on the first day. Last time we talked for an hour. I am in charge of getting a poll of people's favorite disney movies, so please help the cause!! I am also in charge of the disney music, including musicals, which is also going to be fun!!  I will be quite surprised if anyone actually read all of this because a.)it was quite random b.) there was a large part of just ranting and c.) it was extremly random. Ah well. Yourmother is an aardvark.

      Allo again!  ALI JOINED! Woo-hoo!! Add Olivia and we could start a house- er, Blogger party!! :P  To help out the confused, such as Alison, my title scheme is just based on random song titles from Ayu's CDs. (I trust that everyone who knows me well enough knows Ayumi. If not, then you don't know me as well as you thought, did ya??) Speaking of which, I ordered one of her previously out-of-stock CDs the other day and it STILL hasn't arrived! Darn US postal system!! Grrr...  I'm beginning to sound like Jane. :P  I went to the Honors Program set-up today during SRT. (Actually, that would be about 10 minutes ago...) That, as Ash could tell you, was a complete waste of time. I walked in there, sat down with Ash and waited for about 10 minutes while the Top Ten seniors were told where to stand on the stage. Then we were excused. We did  absolutely nothing .   While on the subject of wasting time, I'll continue the trend by posing an incredibly random question. It'll bring out sides of us we had no idea were hidden, and it'll make some people begin to think more. (JANE!) Who knows? We could start a "Question of the Day" type of thing.  Question for May 11, 2004 : When you type, what is the one thing that bugs you most? Explain.  (Don't you love it when teachers ask you to explain events and topics that can't truly be explained??)  My answer : I hate the fact that I can never type "about" right.  Each time, I stick the "o" before the "b" and I usually have to catch myself and correct it. Argh...  That's enough of my talking for today. Time to go around and post comments!! :)  Your mother is an aardvark!

You see, (I will recap for YouNa) I am a member of the IB (International Bac. Programme) and we need 150 service hours for our community service deal thingy. Ah well, my neighbor told me about this place called Silly Safaris and said that they work wiht animals and such and that it would be perfect for me. And so, I emailed them. I waited, and I didn't get any email back. UNTIL TODAY!! THey want to interview me and such and they say that they will work with me around my hours! (Especially because I have summer school. YUK! lol) I am soooo unbelievably happy. This so makes up for waking up aat 1:30 this morning adn not bein able to go back to sleep. I still have yet to take a nap. lol Ah well. That's all I am going to post for now.  Thanks to the Compendium people! (We still wanted to get an okay from you before we really started. Thanks!)

      Allo!!! Greetings from the journalism room! During school hours! (GASP!)  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! The originators of " Compendium " know about us!!!! (gasp!) Haha... I might be the reason behind that. *hides* Yes, Jonah, you  should  be flattered. You get the chance to bow!! :P   WOOHOO! Ali's gonna join!! By the way, I'm inviting Olivia. I'm sure YouNa wants to hear from her. (Right, YouNa??)  Ashley not hitting any mailboxes or trash cans? You need to come drive over here on Mondays. That's trash day for us. :P And I  did  notice a lack of response about the "Couch of  Love ." I personally thought it was funny. ADMIT IT! YOU DID, TOO!  And if anyone makes fun of Ash's infatuation- *ahem* I mean, LOVE, for French, I'll seriously take care of it. She's not the only one planning to major in a language in college. (points to self)  Time for shoutouts: Ash: I WANNA SEE THE GIFTS!!! SHOW ME!!! Jane: Girl, you have to get online more. And tell your parents I apologize for Saturday night. (Well, technically it was Sunday morning...) YouNa: We'll get you a copy of the movie and send it. How about that? It has English subtitles. :) And Ashley had the initial spark to get the blog going; I had wanted to do one before, but at that time Jane's computer was not compatible with Blogger. >_ Alison: GET ON HERE! Olivia: DITTO! (Well, once I've invited you...*guilty blush*) :P   EDIT  WE NOW HAVE COMMENTS! YES! Your mother is an aardvark.

      And I just got back from driving my mother on errands. I invited Ali to join, Sarah! :-) We could also invite Olivia, if you wanted. Anyways....I didn't hit anything, and I didn't even come CLOSE to hitting anything! YAY! And the people rejoice. :-) Happy mother's day to all the mothers, although I don't know of any who read this...I come close, but I am not technically. lol Boy, I am tired though! Before we went on errands, I helped shovel rocks outside! Arhg.  And now to specific people: Jane- TITLE SCHEME. Use one!!!! (A gentle reminder) YouNa- I am in French, and I LOVE it! This is my 3rd year of French, and I am so going to major in it in college! (No laughing other people!) I am also in Latin, but I don't love it as much as I love French. Le francais est la langue la plus chouette!!!  Sarah-Oh! I got something for Jonah and Nathan. Remind me to show you! They're fun! They feel funny! (notice how I am not responing to your couch joke. It's not funny. :-) ) Oh and by the way people- Please post in your next post your title scheme so that we all know. And please end with our ending. We'll end up changing it periodically, so after a while, go ahead, and we'll all use a new one. Currently it's: Your mother is an aardvark!

I'm not sure of the exact date, but Jane could most likely tell you. Unfortunately, I still have mine on... :( BLAH!  My personal favorite was the picture of the "Couch of  Love ..." :P Right, Ash??  *Even on Mother's Day, your mother is  still  an aardvark.*

      Hello! Hola! Bonjour! Salvete omnes! And how are you all?? Shall we play the guessing game to guess hwo I am. Ah but you already should know.  To bring people up to date. My name is Ashley. You can call me Arae. Not Ashwee; I hate that...with a passion.  Let's see...I will give you all a mini bio on me. I am 15 soon to be 16. I live with my mom, sister, adn brother.  I am unable to type well. :-) I cannot speel. ;-)  I am random. Ask anyone.  I love my birds! I love rubber duckies! I love Labrynth! BWAHAHA!  (Ah, and at this point, I should most likely add where we got our name from and the part about the aadvark.) "Oh my aching sushi!" comes from the best movie ever, THe Labryinth, with David Bowie, as does the "Your mother is an aardvark!" I must give credit where credit is due. Our idea for this came from Compendium of Stupidity. (WE LOVE YOU!!! and only slightly in a romantic way! lol) Ah well. We are borrowing yoru ideas for this for now, at least until we get started, if that is okay. (Please let me know. :-) )   Ah, and just so you know, we will be stealing the idea of title schemes, if that's okay with the Compendium crowd. (Again, let me know.) For the time being, mine will be (someone/something) = (someone/something else) I'll get bored sooner or later and then I'll change it...OH! I could do Le petit princed quotes, although I already did that in my TOD. Ah well. I will reuse them for this.  Another thing, like Compendium, because as I stated before, they are our insipration and such, we would like to use their idea of ending with a certain sentance/phrase. (Again, some Compendium person, tell me if this is okay.)  Anyways, as far as rules,  1.) Don't go too long without posting 2.) Don't over post.  3.) Don't make fun of the other bloggers.  4.) Use nice language.  I don't believe too many people will be reading this other than us, so we'll just leave it there for now. Alrighty? Alrighty. Love ya all lots and lots!!  Your mother is an aardvark!

      This will be my last post before taking off early tomorrow morning for the Key Club International Convention/Tour in St. Louis. I'll return around noon on July 8th. I'll expect everyone to be awaiting my arrival. :P All my faithful lil' companions...  Packing always gets me stressed. I'm one of those people who always worries that a pair of shoes or a particular item of clothing will be forgotten. De-stressing... Ha! Hey, if I made it through a sweltering KC Weekend in Ohio without sneakers or shorts, I should be able to survive ICON. :)  WISH JANICE LUCK! She's in the running for one of 14 International Board slots in the nation. GO JANICE! :P  That's enough for now. And by the way, Evan came over today to give me my birthday/Italy presents. I LOVE THEM ALL! They are soooooooo me! THANK YOU!!! (I doubt he'll read this, but if so, I hope he understands how much I appreciate his thoughtfulness.)  "LOOK! Purple tuna!"

      Bonjour tout le monde! Ca-va? Ca-va.  Wow, so I haven't posted in a long time. Not many things have happened, but yeah. Well, VBS ended. It was bittersweet. I was happy to see them go, but also sad not to see them again. Ah well. We had fun though. As much trouble as they were, they were worth it, in my opinion.  On a lighter note, I got my liscence today. I know I didn't spell that correctly, so you will have to deal with it. Actually, when I went to get gas with my mom, we saw, and talked to, Uncle Stan! So yeah. It was kinda funny.  Saw Troy. I really kinda didn't like it. Ah well. To each their own.  I can't wait for Ocean's 12 and the Bourne Supremency to come out. :-D I liked the first two movies, and I am really looking foward to the next two! yay! Ah well.  Quote of the day time!!! Today's quote: Acta est fabula. Have fun. Latest points, I believe: Alison: 900 Michael: 520 Sarah: 470 Olivia: 460 Nathan: 350 Jonah:320 Evan and Marten: 160  "LOOK! Purple tuna!"

      ALLO, PEEPS!  As for the question of WHY I haven't been online, it's because I've been in the middle of my birthday celebration week!  Thanks  for remembering, Omo and Ali! (Just being hard on ya!)   I'm now 16. YAY! Jane surprised me by coming to VBS (fun, fun, right, Jane?), and during the opening songs, Linda had all the kiddies sing "Happy Birthday" to me as Mom wheeled out my cake. HEE! That was so cute! We had some of it during snack time.  (More sugar for the kids! - Ash)   Afterwards, we all went out (all meaning Ash, Jane, Marten, Jonah, Nathan, Holly and Adrienne) to Bazbeaux's for pizza. YUM! Then we all went home. :( However, Ash went with me later that night to the kids' showcase, where our VBS kids sang songs and did skits.   Well, I played with the video camera and I managed to get one of the three songs that our kids sang, if Marten, Jonah, and of course, Nathan want to see it. I had all three but I accidentally copied over it. :-( I'm slow, remember????? Ah well.  And Ash also got some footage of Sarah all hyped up on sugar, singing and dancing with "ze French birthday frog." That could so easily be used for blackmail, Ash.   I was thinking the same thing...  Then Ash stayed the night unexpectedly. (I love it when that happens.)   When do I ever spend the night expectedly?  True. Then today, Ash and I manned our garage sale for a few hours before going out and checking out the 28 other sales around the neighborhood. For once, I managed to spend less than I earned!   Aren't we proud?  Yes, we are. I earned $35.75 from the sale (Ash earned that, only minus 35 bucks), but I only spent $28 at the garage sales. :) I bought an "egantic" (I'm taking your word, Nathan) stuffed gorilla for my grandfather's birthday next month and a WWII pocketwatch from Russia, along with other things. Ash wants the pocketwatch. Too bad for her. I like it. Plus, I paid for it.   Fine then, be that way. I'm still paying you all money, when I get some.  No, you're not.  Birthday Gifts: $50 from grandparents $50 from aunt & uncle Jane: fake Louis Vuitton bag!!! :P (grin) Ashley: French bag w/ "Love" CareBear, fairies, pizza coupons, and a card w/ an upcoming pedicure appointment (yet to be scheduled) Jonah:  The Truth  by Terry Pratchett Linda: a 30-year-old print from Japan signed by the artist, a book with pictures of the Eli Lilly collection of Chinese art, 30 rubber stamps of Chinese nature symbols Adrienne: Hello Kitty cup, hat, and pillow (that was signed by all at Bazbeaux's)   Sarah happy. :)  "LOOK! Purple tuna!"

      Speaking of The Notebook, I REALLY want to see that! I am jumping at the chance ASAP (I saw the review in the newspaper today and immediately told my mom: "We are going to see a movie this weekend.") because my family has gotten into the habit of going to see movies that I really want to see without me. Luckily I still got to see "Saved!", but I have yet to see "Super Size Me."  I don't know what plans everyone has next week (ie. how long VBS lasts) but if you are free next Thursday, PLEASE come and see the PA Institute voice showcase! It's a combined show for the Broadway, vocal jazz, and solo voice classes. I'll be singing two solos and a duet, at least. It's at 12:30 at the LC Auditorium. If you need a ride, call, because my parents could probably give you one.  Hope everyone has a good weekend!  "LOOK! Purple tuna!"

      In memory of Mattie Stepanek, poet and peacemaker...    On to happier things: JANE CAME BACK HOME! YAY! And I couldn't truly welcome her back without a 4 1/2 hour visit, could I? And I got one of my birthday presents early! Jane got me a... *drumroll, please*  FAKE LOUIS VUITTON BAG!  Ahhh.... That's the best present so far this year. (Although my grandparents' $50-dollar check wasn't bad, either.) It even had a wonderfully-detailed silk bag that it came in. (When I say "wonderfully-detailed," I mean "tearing at the seams with loose threads," and when I say "silk," I mean "burlap.") The flaws are appreciated, Jane. I love it!  I stood up clutching my fake Louis, and Jane told me that "Jean-Luc was not worthy" of me. I replied, "Of course not, darling! He's 2000 leagues under the sea, and I'm a mountaintop." (Like that analogy, Ash?)  I had a dream last night that I had ongoing "relations" with the Devil. He and I IMed each other frequently and ate dinner in foreign fish markets. Apparently, he saw me as a "hard-to-get" girl (Ha... That's an understatement!); and thus, good met evil. He would destroy, but I'd build everything back up again. A nice look at teamwork, I must say. Of course, he killed Jane and Ash for the thrill of it, something I couldn't undo, but I never got mad enough at him to leave. Now that's just sad. Please tell me I'm not that blind.    "LOOK! Purple tuna!"

I had fun this morning with VBS, but I am TIRED. I attempted to sleep, but I couldn't. So yeah.  This day's quote is Docendo discimus. Have fun. I'm too lazy to count points right now.  But yeah. Jane: I thought you were coming back the 28th. Welcome home! and Happy belated birthday! Olivia: Yes, I was, and I am, obsessed with ducks. Ask Sarah about my Jungle Duck. (WHich is a big hit!!!!)  THat's all for now. I itch a lot. Evil mosqitos. This post really didn't have a point. Oh well. "Get up off your knees! You're too young for that..." (This will be changed soon!

      I now have a t-shirt that says that. :o) I went to Aeropostale today and got six t-shirts and a pair of pants. Aeropostale has the cutest t-shirts ever, and really good deals (2 for $25 and a third for $5!). YAY! Ashley: weren't you the one who was obsessed with ducks for awhile? One of my shirts says "Ducky love" and has a cute beach scene of a duck "couple." It made me think of you!  Ahh, Alison, your post made me sad because it made me think about people going away. Grr. But I'm sure there will be great opportunities for you at the Academy, and I suppose I have to accept the idea of all of us leaving each other eventually. *tear*  My classes have been extra exciting lately. The other day my Broadway/vocal jazz teacher played through my songs on the piano and just reaffirmed my belief that he is one of the coolest guys ever. I'm really looking forward to the showcase that we're having at the end of the four weeks!  I miss HOBY but I've been having a lot of fun lately -- music classes, sleepover last night, shopping... Hope everyone else is as happy as I am!  "Get up off your knees! You're too young for that..."

      Hello all! Wow! I am slap happy tonight!!!!! That could be because I got the COOLEST THING EVER tonight! I got-get this- from a dollar store-a FRENCH cd of an artist from the 1930's! It's the COOLEST! I love it to death! It's awesome! This is the-wow-I've run out of words. C'est absolument FORMIDABLE!!!! Et maintenant, je parle en francais! Ce "post" est le 100me, n'est pas? YAY! 100! Cent!!! wOOt! That makes me happy! Happy 100th post! To Sarah: Yay! 100 posts!  To Olivia: YAY! 100 posts master! To Ali: We've written 100 posts! yay! To Jane: Wish you were here! Happy 100th post and happy birthday! To YouNa: Woohoo! 100! YAY!!!!!!!!!!!! Okie dokie. Now on to what I've done with my time. Thursday: I got up and talked to Evan. Then, my grandfather and I walked, for some really strange reason, around Kroger. We had some lunch, and then we went to Lowes. We then walked aroudn the mall. Actually, at the mall, I saw this little boy who I worked with in his special ed class at Sunnyside. I didn't stop to talk to him, because I didn't recognize who he was with. It wasn't his fahter, so yeah. But that made me really happy. Then we went home, and we ate dinner later. After dinner, Evan came over and we had ice cream. He met my grandfather and such. It was fun, especially because I haven't talked to him in a while, because he was in Italy and then he's leaving for an IU program on Sunday. He'll be back Friday I believe though. So yeah.  Wednesday: I spent the day with Sarah helping her at church. We got ready for VBS next week, which should be lots of fun and awesome!  Today:Today, Sarah came over and then we went to a movie with Nathan, Jonah, Thomas, and Michael. We saw the Terminal. I enjoyed it. It was cute. Then I came home and did more VBS stuff. I made 20 crickets and 20 leaves. I enojyed spending time with everyone, although, I am not sitting next to Michael again, lol! (Just kidding!) But yeah. I'm happy. This summer is becoming better than I thought it would be. At least I am happy (or happier) this summer. So yeah.  My grandfather leaves tomorrow morning. I am going to miss him, and not miss him. If that makes sense. Ah well. I'll write more later!!!!  "Get up off your knees! You're too young for that..."

      Right now, i'm at the indiana aacademy right now typing on my I book!!! it's a lap top computer for those of you who don't know what it is. i'm so excited!!! everybody at the academy gets one and today is the first time that i've been able to get online.  we get to use these the whole year and we can download stuff, burn cd's and even watch dvd's.  it's the most awesome thing ever invented...for right now.  of course, when i first got my cellphone, they were the most awesome thing ever!! it's got wireless internet but it only works on ballstate campus.  i'm a little sad that i'm the only person here right now.  yesterday, i arrived here in the morning and have been taking placement exams pretty much all of yesterday and i met some new friends,.  they're all from northern indiana and it's referred to the as the region around here..never heard that before, but it's a new place.  the dorms here are not that bad.,.except for the fact that i don't have an airconditioner but that can be fixed.  the people here are really nice and they are really outgoing so it's not hard to get to know people.  i wish all ofyou could come!!! gotta go and figure out what i'm going to take next year.

      HA! I get the 98th post! I'm so lucky!  Anyway, I just got back from another exhausting day of VBS set-up. We left at noon, returned at 8:30... Whew! I'm tired... And I have almost an entire day of it tomorrow, followed by two free days (what we call a weekend) before I return for the actual week of VBS. Today, I had the privilege of moving trees, sticking old, artificial Christmas tree branches into holes beneath the stage, mounting 54 pieces of green crepe paper onto the ceiling, writing the names of all 90 kids on gold/silver stars, and hanging fishies. (Yes, Ash, we hung the fishies today! You'll love them! And yes, they were tripped over... several times. Oops...)  Nothing else to say. Bored as all get out, but that's the way it is for most of us, I'd say. OH! How could I forget the fact that I broke an Ayu CD while trying to get over my parents' crap in the garage? I may be thin, but there are some instances when squeezing over - and not through - is the best way out, even if it means having to import another CD. :(  "Get up off your knees!

      Hello all! Hm..I need to title this entry, but I am having a problem with yahoo. Argh. And all my wonderful sites are saved on my yahoo. Ah well.  There is your quote: Je m'aperçus bientôt que l'amour ressemble à la soif : une goutte d'eau l'augmente. Scores: (names in descending order) Alison Michael Olivia Nathan Sarah and Jonah Evan Scores stand at what they were last time but Sarah has 160 more points. yay!  My grandfather is here. He got here around 10:30 am, meaning I was only half an hour off in my prediction. We went to lunch today and then drove and saw mom at work.  Well, I must go now. Sarah will be here soon to pick me up, so yeah. I'll tell you how that goes later.  OH! And HAPPY BIRTHDAY JANE!!!!!! JOYEUX ANNIVERSAIRE!!!! FELICAM NATALAM!!!!!!! 16!!!!!! wOOt!!!!!!

      I am back from my temporary blog hiatus. I'm sure you all missed me. ;-P If you don't feel like scrolling all the way down to read my last post, I will tell you where I was: HOBY, aka Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership, a four-day leadership seminar for incoming high school juniors from around the state (and a few from Illinois.) Arrival time was between 8-10 in the morning on Thursday, and the closing ceremony was over around 3:00 on Sunday afternoon. However, the days were so jam-packed that it felt a LOT longer. We had about five hours of free time the entire weekend. The rest of the time was filled with panels, motivational speakers, small group discussions, leadership activities, and more casual activities like a talent show and dance.  HOBY was one of those things that you don't really understand unless you were there, and it's hard to explain to an outsider. I met a lot of really cool people and made several new friends. I stepped out of my comfort zone and got inspired. I learned new things about myself and other people. We all started out awkward around each other, and by the end we were talking to each other freely and screaming silly cheers. I heard so many interesting things that weekend, I can't even begin to remember them all. HOBY was truly incredible and I believe that it changed my life, even in subtle ways. I miss the environment but I hope that I can bring the same feeling to other places and people.  Well, I'm blabbering, but like I said, it's just impossible to understand if you weren't there. Lucky for me, I *was* there, and I will always be thankful for that opportunity.  (In case you're wondering about the title, we said "OUTSTANDING" and gave thumbs-up signs all the time. After every panel, every speaker, "Hey HOBY, what do we think of so-and-so?" "OUTSTANDING!") :o)    "Get up off your knees! You're too young for that..."

      Just saw that movie this weekend. It was so sad...i got so teary when kate hudson found out that her sister had died:( anywayz, it was a good chick flick.  I still have really nothing to talk about so this will be a very short post.  So far, i've been working mondays through fridays from 8am-2pm @ LN as a lifeguard for swim lessons. lemme tell you never be a lifeguard because it is the most boring job in the world and you just sit in a chair watching people swim while you daydream about whatever comes into your head.  To keep myself awake, i've been having to sing and or hum to myself.  i get many strange looks from the kids that pass by me:-p. hehe. then on weekends, i work at this place called papa murhpy's which is a take home and bake pizza.  they have really good pizza so if you ever want some, it's on 79th and fall creek, in the same mall strip as Sundaes. (yummy) hehe. as for that, everyday after lifeguarding i go to the library which is where i am at now to check out books and get online and whatnot.  there is my life in a paragraph.   sry that i can't come to your concerts ashley...i'm sure you're great in them!:) btw, anyone not seem harry potter 3 yet?  happy sweet 16 jane:) didya check your cell yet? hehehe...(doubt you even have it with you in viet) but it'll all make sense when you get back and turn it on  it's hilarious how you got that quote!!! "Get up off your knees! You're too young for that..."

      To save Ash the trouble of making her   3rd   post in a row, I'll post. Where is everyone? Jane's gone, YouNa's in her junior year of school already, and Ali's just too lazy to post, so I've heard (:P - that and the fact that she has nothing really to say). Wow. This makes for an interesting blog for those of us still writing in it. You know, those who have nothing else better to do for the moment.  I don't have much to say, either. Ash already talked about staying at my house on Sunday night. That was great. Talking till 1 in the morning (in French, no less) makes Sarah happy. :P That and watching 12 Ayu music videos in a row. (I did that just now. It always puts me in a positive mood. :P) Of course, the woodwind ensemble sounded better the second time I heard it, most likely because I wasn't reading the music over their shoulders when they performed. They're all sweet. Since they had trouble remembering my name, I'm now referred to as "Ash's friend." I'm sure that at the VBS meeting tonight, people will call Ash "Sarah's friend." :)   And about the end quote: While searching for a phone, Ash was sitting on one of the benches in the entrance to the church. Nathan was making his cracker kabobs and kneeling in front of her, talking. When Mr. Comstock saw this, he said:  "Get up off your knees! You're too young for that..."

      Hello all! How are you? I am fine. I am happy. Did everyone look at something pink today? I should hope so! Hey! I just realized! I'm wearing a pink shrit!!!! :-D  On to the quote of the day: Toute musique qui ne peint rien n'est que du bruit. A lovely quote. You can get the normal amount of points for translation and source. Speaking of points: Alison: 740 Michael: 520 Olivia: 460 Nathan: 350 Jonah: 320 Sarah and Evan: 160 Ah, and the last quote was "Noli turbare circulos meos!" Which does in fact mean, don't upset my circles! It was supposedly said by Archimedes in deep thoughts over geometrical shapes drawn in the sand at the moment a soldier of the conquering Roman army broke into his house and slew him. Lovely, right? Ah well. Have fun with the next one. Don't worry. I don't believe it has anything to do with someone being slew over geometry. Next order of business, my grandfather's coming out sooner than expected. He'll either be here later this evening or early tomorrow. yay. Ah well. I love him. I truly do. I'm a bit worried about him meeting Nathan....(I want him to, but if the thought strikes him, he can be scarier than my mother....) Ah well. It should be interesting if nothing else.

      Ha! Well, I am blogging from Sarah's computer, so I am unable to give points at this time, but Nathan has moved up for his last translation which was I was what you are, you will be what I am. And yes, it was from some random guy's grave. I just thought it was funny. :-D Your next quote is Noli turbare circulos meos! It's kinda random out of context, which is what makes it so much fun.  It's taking me forever to type using Sarah's keyboard.  Well, tonight was our spring concert. It went better than I expected. And for once in my life, I was in tune the first time I tuned! Yay! (Okay, I really don't care if anyone else cares, but my flute is stubborn and hates to be in tune.) We played two songs, neither of which I am really fond of, but ah well. I was extremely happy to see that Sarah, Nathan, and Jonah came. It made my day really good! Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!! You all are wonderful!!!!!!! Okie dokie. Randomly talking now...... You know, I like the color pink. Pink is a happy color. Ergo, because ppink is a happy color, it makes me happy to see it. I think that everyone should look at something pink when they are upset.  That's all for now.  WAIT! Sarah told me to change the tagline to  "Get up off your knees! You're too young for that..."   (She'll give you the story behind it later!)

      I need chocolate... :(  We had a 2:45 A.M. flight (Indy time) Sunday from LA, on which I did not sleep a bit, and then we switched to another plane around 6 in the morning in Minneapolis to get back home, also on which I did not sleep. So, basically, Sarah's tired. And hungry. And would come see Ash perform tonight if 1) she wasn't keeling over, drooling half the time, and 2) didn't look like she was caught in a tornado. Sorry, Ash. I'd come if I could promise that I'd stay awake.  On a better note, I finally saw my report card. I was surprised by Means' scores. I got an A+ for the sixth weeks, an A+ on the final (o_0??), and an A+ for semester. Did she do that with anyone else? But, anyway, I raised my cumulative GPA to a 4.050 from a 3.973, which ranks me 7th, three spots ahead of first semester. YAY! And what happened to all the sophomores?? We went down to 658 (or whatever that number was - I don't have the paper in front of me) from 691. That's a big jump.   I'd have tons of SF/Sacto/LA stories to tell y'all, but I'm exhausted. I'll tell ya later. (Or you can just call tomorrow! It makes it a bit easier for me!)  "I never tire of being useful."

      Hello all! I have returned. Now, for points and such. First off your new quote is Eram quod es, eris quod sum. It's a lovely one, especially if you find out where it's located.... For the last one it was For those in misery perhaps better things will follow. And, as Alison said, it was Virgil. The one before that, was Don't judge higher than the sandles. And her is teh story, in slightly more detail... Apelles, Greek painter, would put his pictures where the public could see them and then stand out of sight so he could listen to their comments. A shoemaker once faulted the painter for a sandal with one loop too few, which Apelles corrected. The shoemaker, emboldened by this acceptance of his views, then criticised the subject's leg. According to Pliny Apelles replied to this that the shoemaker should not judge beyond his sandals. (One should judge only matters that one knows something about.) Ah. The lessons learned from Greek painters are many...or maybe not so many. Whatever.  Yeah, so Strawberry festival today. Well, we ran low on time, so we cut I bought me a Cat, which I was EXTREMELY HAPPY about. Otherwise, I missed some rhythms and notes, but nothing too noticable. Tomorrow we play in the spring concert at Faith at 7:00. I hope people show up! (Other than the performers) I'll be a lot happier, when I can pay more attention to the music. I want to hear some of the other groups, like the Brass and the Bells. I've never heard them before really. (Meaning, I've heard the Brass practice from down the hall, but that's all.) So yeah. My day revolved around practicing and getting ready. And then practicing some more with the group! That was my day, how was everyone elses? SCORES: (in descending order) Alison: 740 Michael: 520 Olivia: 460 Nathan: 350 Evan: 160 Jonah: 160 Sarah: 160  "I never tire of being useful."

      Hello all! Ugh. I just got the list of songs for my Woodwind Ensemble Concerts Saturday and Sunday. We're playing Orlando Ramble (I play one note for about 75% of the song.), Cocoanut Cakewalk, I kinda like that one, The Gospel medly,(for woodwinds and in which, if the other second flute doesn't show up, I have a solo which I really don't want) Gold and Silver Waltzes, LONG!!!, The Pink Panther, (I get the cool part!!!), I bought be a cat, Don't get me started, and When I am 64, which I would like to play. On Sunday I am playing the Gold nad Silver Waltzes and Cocoanut cakewalk. If you would like to come, Saturday is from 4-4.30 and SUnday is at 7 pm.  Okay. Yeah. Nathan was right last time with the quote. Read his explanation. I will provide another one next time. You're new quote is Forsan miseros meliora sequentur. And GO! Okay Well....more tomorrow after the concert of Doom. I think people will be running away from us, or perhaps playing us to stop....  "I never tire of being useful."

      SPQR really means, despite what Nathan wrote, Senatus populusque Romanus. The Senate and the People of Rome. And, I might add, that this is written everywhere in Rome, so if you are ever in Italy, see if you can find it.  The next one is Ne supra crepidam judicaret. It's a hard one, so if you find it, 200 points. And another 100 if you can tell me the story behind it. (Yes, I already know!) Well... I'm glad to hear that Sarah is having fun!! And I hope that Olivia has a great time too! You know, computers cause me headaches. Many headaches. See, one of my friends is traveling and he sent me an email attachment, which my computer won't let me open. Evil electronic doorstop. Ah well. I wrote him telling him to resend it. Not much more has happened here. Yesterday was nice and peaceful. For some weird reason though, I had trouble sleeping and so I didn't fall asleep until 2 am. Ah well. I slept in until 11 though. That's what summer's for! :-D But yeah. Sorry this was such a short post. Ah well. Points now!

      I'm still in SanFran. My parents got off-schedule and instead of being in LA right now, we're in the exact same hotel I was in when I blogged the first night. The computer's the only good thing about returning here.  Cali's good so far. Here's another one of my signature bulleted lists:  Positives: - seeing Nat and Pam for the first time in several years (9 and 7, respectively) - shopping in Chinatown, especially my new Chinese dress to go with the Vietnamese dress Jane gave me - friendly people - seeing the sights (DUH!) - INCREDIBLY LARGE ASIAN POPULATION! I AM IN ASIAN HEAVEN! - going to an Asian goods store and seeing not only Ayumi posters on the wall, but also Ayu/BoA/Hikaru Utada CD's on the shelves... (Yet again, in heaven!)  - inside jokes w/ Nat (The Skittle family, lady on the highway with styrofoam on the front of her car) - cable car rides  Negatives: - only going to the cheap, touristy part of Chinatown, and completely skipping the teenage goods that REAL Chinese girls wear/use/buy in China - parents having no idea where to go - realizing that USF is a  Jesuit  college (I felt so stupid...) - only being with the Kwongs for less than two days - really cold weather (GAH! It's horribly windy and cold - the high today was about 51) - me gaining weight (haha... people will hate me for this remark, but it's true!) - me being away from all the Indy peeps (I'm sorry you're bored, Ash!! I'd be there, but...) - spending an hour and a half in Walgreens because Mom was choosing what to buy for relatives who don't even talk to her - losing a couple days in LA because we can't keep to the schedule  Although the negative list is long, I still am having a good time. Tomorrow, we head off to LA, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to blog before I get home. We have a 2:30 A.M. (Indy time) flight from LA on Sunday morning, so y'all can call me later that afternoon.

      Alison already touched on my title, but I was inspired because I didn't think they were that bad at my house, but I just looked outside and they are swarming around the trees in my yard. Every time one comes near the window, I jump. (Yes, I am paranoid. Bugs are ok, but not when they're on me.) And, two of them fell in the (not moving) windshield wipers this morning as my mom was driving me to music classes.  Speaking of music classes, the PA Institute is going well. A guy named Todd is teaching the Broadway and vocal jazz classes, and he is very cool. He has a lot of connections with people in the theatre, so he's going to have them come in and talk to us. For instance, he knows the guy who just got done playing Mufasa in the tour of The Lion King! In the vocal jazz class, today we learned how to scat. Scatting is improvisational singing, where you just make up nonsensical syllables. It feels very awkward at first, but I was actually pretty good! My last class is solo voice, and my choir teacher from last year is teaching that. There is a wide range of kids in the class, so she's having us older kids (10th grade and up) work on our own songs a lot.  I shall be taking a hiatus until Sunday, because I will be at HOBY. HOBY is a leadership "seminar" for incoming 11th graders, and I will be attending the Indiana one at Butler. It's an entire weekend of guest speakers, team building, role plays, etc., all about different areas of leadership. I've talked to a couple people who have been in the past and they said it's really really fun, so I'm excited. Who wants me to lead them when I come back?? haha  "I never tire of being useful."

      Okay, now is when the mad points come in. If you are able to find the meaning of the abbreviation SPQR, you will get let's say...300 points. Okay? (And yes, it is more difficult, but yes, it can be done. I did it last night! I never put any on here that I myself have not found on the internet) 100 points to Alison for her "Look! That's a pink cat!" Well done. Scores stand as last time, only now Alison has 100 points more.  Ha! This will be a short post for in a bit, I am going out to get food! To eat! This week! YAY! Okay, you know you live a sad life when you are excited about giong grocery shopping. We are going today to get some stuff to tie us over until mom gets paid Friday.  AND report cards came!!! That makes me SO HAPPY!!!! For all you LN French students, she only gave me an A for semester. Please don't hurt me. :-) Overall, I am ranked 35th, which makes me happy, because last year I was 69th. *smiles!*  Yeah... AND Sarah called me last night from California! It was nice to talk to her again! We talked for about 15 minutes before she had to go. Oh, and Nathan, I found out about cricket. It's more of a Carribean Island thing. Sorry! Not much help. My grandmother said that you really can't read about cricket you actually have to go out and get kicked in the shin to understand how it's played. Speaking of which... My grandfather is coming out next Monday. This should be interesting. (This also means that I'm not going to bring him to church, considering he will be not here Sunday.) Ah well. If anyone is going to be around and wants to meet him and save me from going insane, let me know. I love him dearly, but yeah. You really have to meet him to know what I mean.

      It's a horrible movie. don't rent it, yo'ure just wasting your money but it had a summer title so i thought i'd use it since it's summer and all. how's everyone's summer?!?! sarah sounds like she's having so much fun and i just can't help but laugh at jane and her computer problem. i'll be sure to email you though!!;-)  it's so cool that you guys actually got the end quote to show up automatically. very neat. i usually have to open up another window to see what it was and them paste it back to my doc.  hope you guys are all having fun this summer!!! so far, the only thing that i've really done was work and work. i got a job lifeguarding at LN for swimming lessons. take my word: it's the most boring job in the world.  it's not like going to school because if you go to school, you can fall asleep but when you're guarding, the parents of the children that are swimming will kill you!!! so i sit in complete bordom from 8am-2pm:( but it does pay nicely. we should all go swimming or something so time. it's so nice outside!!! except with all those ziccadas?!?!? however you spell them. i was driving near sargent and 79th and i was talking.....you can't hear a word you're saying cuz they're just making noises that are so loud. and they're flying all over the place. they are probably one of the ugliest bugs that i've ever seen.  one landed on my open window (i decided i was gonna save a lil gas by not using the air con) when i stopped at a red light and it was...so disgusting. i cannot stand bugs.  you know what we haven't had a lot of? bees. i've seen some but not like as much as we had last year.  maybe the Z bugs have replaced them all.  okey dokey, enough of my babbling, i'll let you all get on with your lives.   btw ashley: me no go to china no more cuz i got the lifeguarding job   "I never tire of being useful."

      You can translate the title for 100 points if you wish. It's not from anywhere imparticular, I just decided to write it. It's amazing what the heat will do to you! Well, it is summer. It feels like summer. I really need to get the a/c fixed. I don't htink that I will be able to live through another July without it!!! (But that comes after the fridge and freezer) Yeah. So anyways.  Not much is really happening here. My grandfather is coming out soon, but I have decided not to go with him. I will be here!!  It feels so weird not to have anyone here. (Friends I mean. My brother and sister are still here.) But yeah... Well, I'm done rambling for now. Maybe I'll come back later and talk some more, but I doubt it. If any of you know how to fix afrdge, please tell me!!! lol Although, I'm thinking that none of us do know how to do that. Ah well.   "I never tire of being useful."

      Hello all! No one is participating anymore in my quote of the day. That makes me sad.... See? 'Tis a sad Ashley. :-( Ah well. I will give you another anyway. Quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentes. Your hint? It comes from a famous book! wOOt! And the last one? "Pacta Sunt Servanda" (Accords (or treaties) should be observed (Basic principle of International Law)) Ah, something profound. Don't worry. I will soon throw in some non profound ones! And some in French! yay! Yes, so. House has gotten a lot less quiet. The kids are back. I think that I just might go with my grandfather. Although, I am still on the fence about it. Ah well. I shall figure it out! :-D Hmm..the young one, aka Chelly, is complaining.  She also brings news of the mailman coming. He had better have brought that report card. I might go crazy if it doesn't come soon, lol! Ah well. That's just me.  The young one is still complaining. I must go. I shall update later. Goodbye.  "I never tire of being useful."

      ALLO AGAIN!!!  I'm at Nat's house (in her little brother's room). Since Vincent's gone at school (poor thing - doesn't get out for a while yet) I've seized his computer.  Sacramento was fun, but it makes Indy look really busy and hectic. (I'll provide details later.) We're traveling to SanFran again in a few minutes, where Nat'll show us around today and go back home, but we'll stay in SanFran for a couple of days.  I have no idea when the next time I'll be near a computer is, so HAVE FUN, KIDS! I know I am!!! :)  "I never tire of being useful."

      Hi everyone! Since I last blogged I have seen two movies, which doesn't happen too often, at least not one right after the other! Anyway, I saw Troy and Harry Potter. I hid my eyes during the battle scenes in Troy (yeah, I'm a wuss), but I thought the characters were very interesting, and of course there was the only reason I agreed to go see it in the first place: Orlando Bloom (and Brad Pitt, but I am partial to Orlando). hehehe Wow, they WORKED OUT for that movie. It sure beat trying to read The Iliad! Did anyone else notice that they just happened to take that off the summer reading list the year AFTER we (Lyceum people) read it? Hmph.  Harry Potter was great! I liked it the best out of the three movies so far. As all the reviews have been saying, it's darker, but then again, the third book is darker than the first two, so it's not like that was an element that was only added to the movie. If you haven't seen it yet, when you do, watch for the singing frogs! :o)  I got my hair cut yesterday -- my annual "summer chop," as I call it. The hairdresser cut it about to my shoulders, but since it's so curly it looks shorter. I like it, though it's at its cutest after it's been washed, and I'll never have time to shower in the morning. Oh well.  Tomorrow I start the Performing Arts Institute at LC. I'm taking three classes: Broadway, solo voice, and vocal jazz a cappella. I'm excited!! Hopefully the other kids will be just as into music as I am, so we won't feel awkward about performing around each other. Oh, in case you're wondering, those classes are only an hour each, so I'll be at the PA Institute from 10-1 on weekday mornings until early July. Don't worry, I'm not leaving now!  Hope this is interesting enough for you, Sarah! ;-)  "I never tire of being useful."

      Hello people! How are you??? I'm okay. I am going to quit summer school. If they want to be jerks about the whole thing, then that's no skin off my nose.  As I am quitting summer school, I might go on a short trip to Kansas. Kind of random, I know. My grandfather is coming out on his way to Kansas and he wanted me to go with him. I am thinking that I might, considering I don't get to see him all that often.  Ah, the new quote is "Pacta Sunt Servanda" I would like for someone to give me what it means and where it is found. (sorta.) You'll see. Well, no one answered my last one which was "Odi et amo, quare id facere forasse requiris...Nescio, sed fieri sentio et excrucior" It is a Latin poem which means: I hated and I love, perhaps you ask why I do it...I don't know, but I feel it and I'm tortured. I think,  THINK , it was written by Martial...I have no clue though. It sounds right....I don't remember my Roman poets all that well....Ah well. By the way, scores: Michael: 520 (for the last one, all you said was Star Trek thing...I had to give Nathan the points for The Starfleet Academy's motto.) Alison: 480 Evan: (still the most random player!) 160 Olivia: 160 Sarah: 160 Nathan: 10 All's quiet on the homefront though. Last night, Clyde randomly came over and spent some time with my mom and I. It was really random, so yeah.  I am still reading and enjoying How to think like Leonardo da Vinci. It's great! :-D Olivia, I know that you are reading it too. What do you think of it?? Well, I must say too all of the people who are traveling, i.e. Jane, Sarah, and Evan: I hope that you are having/will have much fun!! :-D And, in the words of Mr. da Vinci himself: "I never tire of being useful."

      Allo, Indiana bloggers!!!  I'm in SanFran right now, eating Cheerios in the hotel's lobby where I was fortunate enough to find a computer with Internet access! YES!  I'm just a few hours away from seeing Nat. (She'll be happy to read this.)   I don't really have much to say, though. I'll try to blog sometime in the near future, when I have had more experiences actually IN SanFran than on a plane.   "I never tire of being useful."

      This is my last post before Cali... I AM GOING TO MISS YOU ALL! However, the thought of hot weather, shopping on Rodeo Drive, Japantown (and Chinatown), and seeing Nat overrides my feelings for you all.  But yes, I must say that today's WestWingCon was great fun. I had a wonderful time meeting, talking with, and laughing at everyone today. Still, though, there must be some rules to follow while I'm gone: 1) People must blog. I want something to return to! 2) Jane! You must e-mail us all back! We're waiting! 3) Nathan and Ash, please try to keep yourselves off each other in public places! For goodness sake! But yes, Amaris is leaving. I bid all of you farewell. Good night.  "I never tire of being useful."

      Before I begin, Thanks to Marten, I have set our end template thing. I can teach people how to change it as they wish! The quote is from Leonardo da Vinci, and can be found in the lovely book,  How to Think like Leonardo da Vinci , written by Michael J. Gelb. :-) On to the topic of my post...evil fridges adn freezers that break down and force you to save what you can and throw out everything else. I just got done sorting through our freezer and all I can say is EWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!! Before sorting through that mess, I was at the JournalCon, which was much fun. Now I am actually going to have to watch West Wing, because I enjoyed it greatly. And yes, I saw most of it! I can hear your whispering....lol!  Much fun.... On a seperate note entirely, I most likely will be quitting summer school. It is not worth my time.  Especially when they tell us we have to leave right after class, but don't offer any way to get home....Argh. That is a headache. Someone, please, hold me back before I get really angry and find someone! Why I oughta... Okay, all that aside. Back to my quote....Forgive me, I will spend tomorrow adding points and such. But, it is quote time. I might add that the quote you will be translating is my title. I am changing my title scheme to Latin and French quotes for you to translate.

      JANE!!!! :)  Ahh... Anyway, I've been busy packing all day so that 1) I'm ready for Cali, 2) my mom gets off my back, and 3) I'll be free on Friday.   For those who I didn't talk to today, I received the results of the tests I've been doing for the past few months.  The original problem was that I had protein going where it wasn't supposed to go. However, my protein levels went from 700 (bad) to 1200 (worse), which is - listen to this! - the level they'd expect from a pregnant woman. (Jean-Luc, eh, Ash?)   So, for everyone who reads this, I'll have to have some surgery done this summer. (I already informed some people, but it was a "maybe" basis. No one knew that it was a sure thing until now.) They might even want to do it as soon as I get back, even though I'll have VBS,  my birthday , the North Star cookout, and (if it's serious and/or scheduled later) my $760 trip to St. Louis for Key Club International Convention. I'M TOO BUSY TO HAVE SURGERY! ARGH!  And I thought May was a bad month. I want Cali now.   *end quote goes here - don't feel like typing it*

      Everything's better here. Or at least, I think so, since Mom was just yelling at me because my bags  aren't  packed yet. I'm really happy. Nat's incredibly, "WOOHOO!"-happy. Ash's happy because I am. It's all good.  Today was tres amusant. After getting some more tests done at St. Vincent's, I went to one of the IPS schools where I tutor on half-days for their end-of-year parties. I distributed cupcakes to the two classes the students I helped teach (Miguel, who is in 4th grade and Andariya - pronounced "and-air-ee-ay" - who is in first grade) were in. They are so cute!  Now it's back to redecorating my room and packing. (Yes, Ash, I'm redecorating again! How fun!! Your room is next, since Jane's in Vietnam! :P)  "Don't worry. There's more birds in the sea. Wait!

      ARGH! I know i just posted, but bear with me as I rant about how useless our bus transportation in this township is.  Okay. I am taking summer school. My session is from 7.25-9.55 every day at LC. Apparently, there are no buses that run to my neighborhood  at all.   The closest one goes to Forest Glen. Now, technically, I could walk to 5 miles from Forest Glen to my house on a busy road with a blind curve. Right? Oh, but here's the other thing, the buses don't leave LC until 12.30! So, I have to wait at LC for another 2.5 hours to get a bus to walk about 5 miles. Don't even ask if we called transportation. We did. That's who told us this. I hate this township. With a passion. So, I have no clue what I am going to do. What might end up happening is that I quit summer school and take night school FOR GYM. Do you know how stupid this is??? It's a GYM credit!!! Heck, it's not even worth a full credit! It's only .5 of a credit!!!! But, no, I can't graduate highschool unless I have two semesters of gym. GYM! Oh argh. I'm doomed. Oh, and yes, I called my consel. She wasn't there, so I left a voice mail message.   "Don't worry. There's more birds in the sea. Wait! I mean, fish in the sky..."

      Wow, it's already Wed! Time sure has flown by quickly. And I only have one more day after today until the dreaded...SUMMER GYM! No!!! Ah well. Two hours and a half hours of running and such at seven thirty in the morning..... Well, for the last quote It was the Starfleet motto. I must give Nathan a few points for having the correct motto, and Michael points for translating it correctly. I'll work that out later.  I am getting so annoyed because my computer is being terribly slow and not doing what I want it to do! Oh argh! There's not much more happening here. Today's Mom's last day off for the week. I've been very happy to have her home for the last 4 days. :-) Although, she has gone on a misson, and now our house is os clean you could most likely eat off the floors! I think that we found things we didn't even know we had! lol. Ah well. C'est la vie. Your new quote: "Dessine-moi un mouton!" Ah! I love this one! :-)  If I am not mistaken, I shall be spending the next at least 4 days home alone, because I believe Mom has to work, and I think that the kids are going to Dad's house. It should be quiet here. wow. That's going to be a first, lol! (Now if only there was a way to get the birdsa quiet...) Yeah so. I've  just been rambling for a while now. Ah well...  "Don't worry.

      Summer has started and I haven't done a single productive thing.  I'm sry that all of you guys are having such a bad start to the summer, but i'm sure it'll get better later on.  So far, all i've done is watch rented movies from the library and go over to my cousins house to play video games or mah jong.  I am enjoying the freedom of not having to do anything though.  On Monday, i slept till 2...it was a glorious day.    as for other news, i might be going to hong kong again this summer. my aunt and my uncle are going to visit the great wall in beijing and the tickets are really cheap so my parents also want to send me off considering i've never been and i'm chinese!!  if all goes well, i'll be leaving towards the end of the week after next and coming back in mid to early july.  Nothing is final yet because i'm on standby for a plane ticket.  i promise to get y'all something if i do end up going.  i still owe sarah a present...i keep forgetti'n to give it to you, but i swear that i do have it. oh, i'll just put it in along with your birthday present. that way, you'll actually get it sometime in the near future.  if you guys ever get bored, you should consider watching or for some of you, rewatching some of the movies that are my titles. pretty in pink is kinda old, but it's a cute movie.

      Hmm...I feel sort of bad, being the only one currently posting who's not going through some sort of mini-crisis, but I suppose there has to be some relief. Anyway, to Sarah and Ash (even though I already talked to Sarah today) I hope you feel better! *hugs* Summer should be happy! (Not that we have much control over what happens, but you know what I mean. I wish it were happier for you!!)  So...my summer has been uneventful since the last time I wrote. I've been stuck at home, which means I've been doing a lot, but nothing too interesting: reading, journal-writing, listening to music, watching TV/show choir tapes (yes, I *am* a choir dork!), cleaning, etc. I did go to church and youth group on Sunday, which meant my brother and I got to drive home through the storm (but no tornadoes!). Oh boy. :-P  Needless to say, I need to get out of the house. Granted, I have several times in the future when I will be gone on trips, but in the meantime, I can't just spend all my time at home. I'm not creative enough to beat the monotony. At least I'm starting music classes at LC next week, but that still only takes up the morning. Oh well, I'll figure something out. Until then...  "Don't worry. There's more birds in the sea. Wait! I mean, fish in the sky..."

       Just let me say that it was a horrible movie.  Don't watch it cuz the acting sucked.  Sry if I offend anyone cuz of course, this is just my opinion. Chad Michael Murray was cute in his football uniform although you don't get to see him in it till the end of the movie.  other than that, it was a typical movie that was really really predictable in every sense with some pretty cheesy lines.   as for other news, I no longer have a job:( today was my last day working at papa murphy's and lifeguarding/teaching kids how to swim ended last monday.  i no longer have anything to fill up my days so i shall be online quite a lot.  good news is that i broke my $1000 mark thnx to lifeguarding.  that's probably not going to get touched too much cuz it's most likely going into either my college fund or a car fund. in order for me to get a car, i have to raise $5000...that's not going to happen anytime soon...hehe. i don't mind though, as long as someone else can give me a ride, i'm happy. driving isn't a big part of my life although it's more accomodating for whimsical events.   only 7 days till move in day!!! we definitely should get together sometime next week and have a girls week...but sarah's not here...right? or does she come back next week??? :( i'll cross my fingers and hope that she is.

      Hi everyone. Sorry I haven't posted in a while. I just really haven't had anythign to say, but oh well. I still don't really, but that's okay. I figure I'll just write.   I finally totaled points. If you want to know, just ask! I'd rather not post them in here right now. Maybe later though.   Yeah, so I'm not feeling too well. Up until today, I haven't been really nervous about this weekend, but it's hitting me now. I'll get over it after everything is over though. I'm just a bit nervous.   With all that said, not much more has happened here. It's been really quiet, which I guess is good. Chelsea's having her birthday party Friday night, but that isn't going to really be a problem, considering only 1 girl is coming. Besides, I'm going to a movie that night with my dad.  (Hence why I am nervous) Ah well. Again, I'll get over it. I'm sure I'll be okay.   Otherwise, that's about all.   "Shall we go to bed?"

       Ooh, pretty colors. hehe My family decided at the last minute to spend the weekend in Chicago! We left Friday afternoon and returned Sunday night. On Friday night we went to Nordstrom's (I got a belt) and&nbsp;went&nbsp;to see the Blue Man Group. It's very hard to describe but the show is basically three guys who don't talk whose heads are entirely painted blue. It incorporates drumming, painting, music, technology, and skits. Not to mention it is very hard to describe. *wink* It was definitely the most surreal experience of my life; I was gaping with awe!    &nbsp;  The next day we went to the Shedd Aquarium. My favorite animals were the dolphins (they were dark-sided, not like the bottlenose you usually see at the zoo, really pretty), sea otters (SO cute!) and beluga whales. That night we went back to Nordstrom's (they were having really good sales) and I bought some very cute pajamas.    &nbsp;  On Sunday we went to IKEA, a massive home furnishings store. Usually I hate furniture shopping with my parents but we all ended up finding things we liked. Plus they have really good food for a furniture store!    &nbsp;  So now I'm home, but not for long. This Friday I'm going to a concert (John Mayer & Maroon5) and on Sunday I leave for NYC to visit my aunt for a few days. When I get back it will be time for family vacation (to Canada, I think), which will end right before school starts. Ugh, school. I was upset about the new schedule, too. Getting out two days before Christmas is really gonna suck, but I think we're getting finals over with before vacation this year, which will be nice. Plus we get 10 days for spring break, AND we get to go to prom this year! YAY! Oh,&nbsp; and about the new policy about getting books...that really screws me over since I think we'll be on vacation during registration days, so hopefully I can somehow have someone else pick up my books for me, or work out something similar. Hmm...    &nbsp;  Anyway, I guess I'll blog again when I get back from NYC!    &nbsp;  "Shall we go to bed?"

       Hello!!!!!!!     New quote: Ad augusta per angusta. Have fun. I have still yet to calculate points. I've been with Sarah these last couple of days and therefore haven't been able to acess my point charts at home.     Ah yes. Sarah's making me blog. Therefore, it's time for........*drumroll*.......our dday in Kokomo.YAY!  Okay, Friday I went with Sarah and Mrs. M. to Kokomo to visit Sarah's relatives and to shop. Well, we first went shopping and Sarah bought a plethera of outfits, and I bought a very cute evening dress. (Although, I now have no where to wear it. lol. Ah well. C'est la vie.) I really like it though. Then we went to Sarah's Aunt's and Uncle's house to visit them. We stayed for a while and talked. We also watched home movies. Not just any home movies. Home movies of Sarah as a baby!!!! One word: AAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!! We saw her go up and down steps and play in the pool, (I know, Sarah enjoying being in the pool! lol) her halloween as a bunny when her ears kept falling down, and we saw her love of rocking chairs and chocolate. At one point she carried a bag of chocolates around the house and wouldn't let them go. She was so cute though!!!!! (Sarah, embarrased yet??) That's where I am going to leave it though. (Otherwise Sarah might raid my house for baby videos, lol. )    Today I went to church and then went to lunch with the rest of my family. Much fun. But not. Ah well.   Got oboe reeds. yay......joy.....I really need to pick that thing up again though. I also got a flute music book of Les Mis. Interesting. Keeps me busy. :-D Ah well, that's all for now.

       WOOHOO!   It's Sunday, which means that this time tomorrow I'll be at Ball State! :P Right now, I'm packing for workshops, and all you gals will be glad to hear that this year I'm only taking 3 pairs of shoes! (Last year, I had seven separate bags - one being just shoes!)     Workshops are going to be a bit different this year:   Smitty's being out of business entirely, no more buying Mamma Jamma's, ( hopefully ) no Chris or whatever the other guy's name was to stalk Beth and me...     I have come to the conclusion that reminiscing is fun. However, even more fun is eating, and there's food downstairs that's&nbsp;calling my name. (In other words, I'm hungry! :P) I'll talk to y'all on   Friday!&nbsp;     "Shall we go to bed?"

       i love the colors on this blog!!!! makes it so fun and exciting!!!&nbsp; all the school info is starting to come in and it's making me sad.&nbsp; it really sux that they're passing out books before classes start cuz i loved the first day cuz that's what most of the time was spent doing.&nbsp; then you got to talk while the teachers called everyone's name and so on and so forth.&nbsp; i heard this year that SRT was going to be totally screwed up as in the fact that no one will have it the same period and you can't go anywhere to get help or make up test...so i've heard, but i'm probably wrong.&nbsp; school starts in two weeks!!! i'm going to be so bored with not knowing many people and not having the conforts of home so expect to see me online 24/7&nbsp;since there's wireless internet throughout campus.&nbsp;    lifeguarding ends after next monday so i'll be stuck at home bored. must find something productive to do other than reading.&nbsp; since summer's began, i've barely turned on the tv which is a revelation considering i was a tv maniac.&nbsp; next weekend, some friends of my rents are coming down from canada so at least i'll get to get out of the state at least once this summer.&nbsp; everyone seems like they've gone to so many places this year with at&nbsp;trips to cali, vietnam, new york, and tennesse. i'll have you all know that i'll be traveling the 3 hours to chicago so we can now add that to the list two.&nbsp; not only are we not spending the night there, but we're probably only gonna be there for a couple hours of shopping and then probably eatin' lunch or dinner. lol. sounds like all of your summers are going awesome!!!   i heard a lil bit about your news sarah!!! i'm so happy for you:-D you must tell me more bout how it happened and everything!!!    &nbsp; "Shall we go to bed?"

       Hola all!    Argh. Did everyone see LT's new schedule for next year? First, LN students pick up their books at registration. Argh. That's gonna be a headache and a half. Then we get out of school for winter break Dec. 23rd and go back January 3rd. But we do get "flex" days, meaning our spring break is March 23rd until April 4th. Eh, that could be worse. Ah well. Ha! Prom is 4 days before my birthday!  And there is still an honor's night. I'm not going. I hated it this year. Don't ever want to go again. Ah well. That short rant is over.     So yeah.     I went to lunch with my dad and Sarah today. That was....stressful. I think that it was time to talk to him again though.  So yeah. He still wants to meet Nathan. And yes, Sarah, my father does like you. I wouldn't worry about it. He likes most people. Ah well. It was an interesting time. We talked mainly about school and such of that sort. So yeah. Don't worry. I am still alive and he didn't really upset me. I told you all I could handle it.  See? Strong Ashely! (Who still can't spell her name! Ah well. C'est la vie!)    Well, Michael, you just signed off, but you never gave me that link, so I won't be clicking it anytime soon, will I? (Long story. WAIT! You're back!)  I'm too lazy to delete this paragraph, so deal.     Well, tomorrow I am going to Kokomo with Sarah and her mom I think. That should be fun.      "Shall we go to bed?"

      Argh. Ever have one of those days where everyone gets on your nerves for things they do that normally wouldn't bother you? :( Today's one of those days. I prefer not to rant, however.  Today was my first official DCM. One person came. I remember sitting there at 1:15, thinking: "I hope someone's late and is still planning to come. I feel like a fool standing up by myself in the Glendale Mall Food Court, watching the people who come through the doors." Then Danielle came, and I was happy. Ah, well. More cupcakes for Amaris!  After that, I rushed over to Ruby Tuesday's to have lunch with Ash and her father. (I still think he doesn't exactly like me all that well, Ash. I don't get along well with Gemini men, unfortunately. Pooie. There are some nice ones out there.)&nbsp; We talked for about an hour and 45 minutes, which I found incredibly interesting. (Yes, I know, I'm using astrological psychology in my observations, but when there's a Taurus, Gemini, and Cancer present, you're bound to have an entertaining time.)  Then Ash came over, and we talked. WOOHOO! And she's coming with me to see relatives in Kokomo tomorrow! (Can you say,  shopping with my aunt and uncle ?)   And the countdown continues... (Right, Ash?)  "Shall we go to bed?"

      Hola! It's me! And I am at Sarah's house.&nbsp; I am spending the night. I came over to use the shower and I am staying. Ha! And there's nothing she can do about it! bwahaha! Yeah. The gas was turned off and I wanted to take a shower, so I drove to Sarah's.&nbsp; Then by the time I was finished, it was pouring and there was lightning. Ha. yeah. Not driving in that, so I stayed, and frankly, I'm too lazy to drive the 3 miles home. Ah well.  Well, I don't have points yet, but I'll attempt to do that tomorrow after lunch. Speaking of, I am having lunch tomorrow with my dad and Sarah. Can you say nervous?? I am sooooooooooooooooooo worried and nervous and anxious etc it's not funny. Argh.  So yeah. Wish me luck!!!!!!!!! Nervous. If you want to know more, I'll post when I get home. I hope. Michael says that we're gong to end up dead on the 11 o'clock news. I can't say I really believe him though.&nbsp; (Actually, I don't believe him at all.) Oh! I got ER scrubs. Yay! They're surgeon's scrubs. :-) I love that show. Seriously.  Now Sarah's going to give me a topic to go off on a tangant about: Chocolate. I love chocolate. It always helps everything to feel better. Seriously, if you're hurt, eat some chocolate. So yeah. Chocolate is also what some people used to call Hersh. Mainly Mrs. Moreland. But that's ok! I think Sarah thinks that I am crazy. I'm really not. I'm just tired. I'm in tired mode. Seriously. And I don't know why. Probably because I am&nbsp;tired. AH well. Sleep! Love ya!!  &nbsp; "Shall we go to bed?"

      Well, I'm back. You all have written a LOT in the last 10 days, and I'm sure you're expecting a really long post from me about my trip, but I just can't. There are a million things I want to say, I want you to know about, but it's impossible to write. I went with my youth group and a youth group from Illinois to do Habitat for Humanity in Tennessee. This was my second year on the trip. We worked on four houses from 8-5 Monday through Friday, went to Smoky Mountains National Park on Saturday, and then came home.&nbsp; The trip went so fast but was so incredibly meaningful. It was wonderful to be with everyone again, and I felt I strengthened my relationships a lot more this year. Unfortunately, that also means that I miss everyone SO MUCH, and I have settled into post-Habitat depression. I'll get out of it eventually, especially considering I'm going to a concert next Friday, NYC after that, and then family vacation after THAT, but I won't ever stop missing them and thinking about how much they mean to me. All right, I'm done. Sorry.  "Shall we go to bed?"

      My ViVi didn't come yesterday. Or today. :(   When I walked into Marsh's yesterday, one of the employees looked me up and down and said, "Woo! What have we got here? Why don't girls like you come&nbsp;here more often?" Then when I was checking out, the bagger (another young guy) started hitting on me, but he ended the conversation with: "I'd ask you out, but I think I'm a bit too old for a 13-year-old girl."  Argh.&nbsp; Not that I could (or would) have dated him anyway, me being "single but pledged." :P Haha... I know that later on I'll be happy to look younger. I just have to keep that in mind.

      ooo!!! all the new and pretty colors:)&nbsp; very awesome.&nbsp; just got all four of my wisdom teeth taken out today and so i haven't done much except sleep.&nbsp; it's not painful or anything which i'm surprised about.&nbsp; it was about a 45 min operation that seemed like 5 min to me cuz once they put that IV in my arm, i was out in less than a min cuz the next thing i knew, they were helping to get off the chair. lol. thank god for sedation!!!&nbsp; when i finally got over the whole dizziness thing, my entire bottom lip felt like it was a huge balloon even though it was still numb, but when i actually did look in the mirror, it looked just a bit swollen but not enough for people to gape at me and say, "What the heck happened to you?!" lol. all in all, it wasn't as horrible as people kept telling me it was.&nbsp; i don't even feel any pain right now...but then that might be the painkillers doing it's job.&nbsp; i took my last dose around 3 and they only last bout&nbsp;6 hours so if they start to bother in me in the next couple hours, i'll pop in another pill, otherwise, i'm gonna try to go without.&nbsp; the only bad thing right now is that my gums are still bleeding and you have to change these guaze pads every 30 min or else, they might stick to the gums that are trying to recover and that in time might heal over the gauze where in that case, you'd have to go back to the dentist and have then cut up your gums to get the gauze out.&nbsp; so if any of you are going to get your wisdom teeth taken out any time soon, it's not bad....i was hoping i'd get vikadin cuz that's the painkillers some other peole got, but i've got something that starts with an M:( lol, o well, drugs are drugs.&nbsp; hope everyone is just cheerios!!! &nbsp; "Shall we go to bed?"

      Warning: Incredibly short post.  &nbsp;  My YesAsia order didn't come in today. :(  &nbsp;  Three words for Jane when she comes home from Cali: "CHECK YOUR E-MAIL!" :P Then call me!  &nbsp;  NEWS FLASH:  Jane's&nbsp;coming home around 11 tonight, according to her mother.

      I'm too lazy to calculate points. Sorry!  Anyways though. Not much more here. I'm a bit depressed, so I probably won't be saying much these next few days. Ah well.   I hope that everyone has fun on all of their trips and such that are coming up in the next two weeks.   I took a walk today. It made me feel a bit better. It didn't seem as long as when I walk the same trip by myself, which made me happy. Cha cha gave up about half way through and so we took turns carrying her home. At one point she tried to perch on my shoulder.  Interesting little dog. I have a bird who thinks he's a cat and a dog who thinks she's a bird. Oh argh.   Oh, btw, Jane, Evan saw some of the Labyrinth. He isn't disgusted by it as you are, lol. So yeah.   Anyways, I cut and highlighted my hair today. Much fun. I now have very blonde streaks in my hair and it's about 2 inches shorter than it was. Maybe three. I'm really bad with lengths. Ah well. You get the picture, or you should.

      This is sad. I spent half an hour curling my hair and getting all dolled up for dinner and a concert with my college friend and her boyfriend, and now we're rescheduling the concert because of the rain.  &nbsp;  Anybody want to get together with me and do something? I asked Mom if she had any alternatives to Plan A, but her Plan B wasn't all that great. "You know, we can go to the movies!"  &nbsp;  The movie theater. Where it's dark for a vast majority of the time you spend in it. Where people can't see the work I put into my hair. *tear* Wow... I sound completely superficial, but I took the time to make myself look pretty. I want people to see it, like Chris Rock's line: "Heck, if I got a Jaguar or Mercedes, I wouldn't want those tinted windows. I want people to see who had the money to buy it!" (That was major paraphrasing, but you get the idea.)  &nbsp;  That's the end of my rant. Good night!  &nbsp;  EDIT : I&nbsp;dragged Dad to Broad Ripple, where we ate at La Jolla and people-watched. (Thank you, Ash, for entertaining me, though! :P ) &nbsp;  "Shall we go to bed?"

      Hello all! And how are you all? I'm good. We've got colour now! That  makes me happy! :-D  Anyways, let's get down to business: You all  have been doing really well with my quotes! Congrats! Your new quote is  Idem velle atque idem nolle, ea demum firma amicitia est. You get extra  points, anywhere from 10-100 if you tell me if you agree with the quote  or not. So you can get up to 260 points this time around.    WE HAVE A PHONE NOW!!!!!!!!!!! Do you know how happy that makes me?? I  was going crazy without it! But now, yay! I can get calls! Although, I  did go 15 days without it.    Last night went to see Sussical. That is such a cute show. I really enjoyed myself. :-)    And I must add a YAY in because Sarah's page is up and running once more. I really like the new layout. It's very nice.    Oh, yeah, before I forget, points!     Nathan ...................990     Ali ..........................900     Sarah......................720     Michael...................520     Marten....................470     Olivia......................460     Jonah......................320     Evan.......................160    SO.....yeah. The kids got back this morning from Canada. Chelly and  Chris came and woke me up at 7h00. Ugh. I though, did not get up, and  went back to sleep until 10h30. :-D    I found out something very cool. I ran out of silver polish yesterday,  and I needed to shine up one of my flutes. (One that I am going to  sell.) Anyways, mom told me to use toothpaste, and you know what? It  worked! So if You ever need to shine something silver and have no  silver polish just go to your bathroom and get your Colgate. It works  just as well. (Although it's harder to do if your on the phone with  someone as Sarah and I found out this morning, lol. Ah well. Yeah,  there's my useless advice for today: Buy toothpaste for all your silver  polishing needs. :-)       "Shall we go to bed?"

      As for the above quote, it's BoA's new single. &nbsp; Anyway, much of what's happened recently has already been written by Ash. I'll spare the details of our mall trip. (Haha... $27 bucks doesn't get much, but it does get some nice birthday gifts for Janice!) &nbsp; I received my AP World History scores in the mail today, too. I got a 4, which, although I wanted a 5 at the beginning of the year, is great, considering how incredibly crappy my essays were. Answering all but one question on the multiple choice seemed to have helped. &nbsp; "I've been rejected...twice!"

      Eh, 100 points for translating that. It's nothing too important.    Yeah, so AP scores came today. ha. ha. ha. Nowhere near acceptable.  Whoops! (I managed to get a 2!) Ah well. I'll do better on the  multitudes of AP tests I still have yet to take. I hope......   Yeah so otherwise, nothing really important here. I spent the night at  Sarah's last night because mom worked until 6 am this morning. I didn't  really want to be alone.  Being alone all night is a bit weird. I  tend to jump. A lot. At every noise.  So yeah.   Hey! We're getting our phone fixed! wOOt! It'll be connected tomorrow  sometime, which makes me very very happy. :-D See? 'Tis a happy Ashley!  And tomorrow is Friday! yay for Friday! :-D    "I've been rejected...twice!"

      Greetings from San Jose, California!! I just got here today and so far I'm... bored. Hehe... My dad has a reunion thingy here because he was in the navy. So I'm here chilling with Daniel and Andrew. We are watching friends... can u tell that we dont have much to do? Hehe... O btw! I read the Scarlet Letter! It's not my summer reading book, but I wanted to read it anyway and it is good. Not the happiest of books, but it's still good! My summer reading for the Academy is Fast Food Nation. It's alright. It's fairly interesting like how all the founders of fast food restaurants had no education. They were basically all drop outs yet they made billions. What a funny little world we live in. But I'm not a huge fan of fast food anyway. Well, anyways, I'll be back in 5 days! So everyone try not to miss me tooo much! hehe.. tootles!!!  "I've been rejected...twice!"

      Hello all! And how are we today? I'm good. I have finished about 1/2 of the Scarlet Letter and it's getting really good! (Seriously Jonah, it gets better than the door of the jail about 80 pages in.) I still have to type up my journal entries though. *bleh* Well, I must put this in. You all know how Ali has been leading the Quote of the Day scores? Not any more! She is now second to...*drumroll* NATHAN! :-D  Scores are as follows:  Nathan: 990 Alison: 900 Michael: 520 Sarah and Marten: 470 Olivia: 460 Jonah: 320 Evan: 160 So yeah. Your new quote is Dum spiro, spero.  Interesting one. Anyone in French might be able to make the connection between the verbs and some French verbs, but I don't know.  Sarah unexpectedly stopped by today, which was nice. I was thinking about going to see her this week, and I still might.  I can't believe that there's only 1 month and 5 days until school. Okay, I'm a dork, and I am looking forward to it.  AND I figured out how I am going to get my money for IB. Hello! I have two flutes upstairs that I never ever use anymore. I am going to sell them and get some money. Now, I have no clue what I am going to do senior year to come up with my money then, but that's okay. I should be able to get about $400 for my flutes, so that should be good. Senior year though, there's no way that I am selling my last flute. That would be like giving away my life. And as much as I despise that oboe, it is a challenge that needs to be conquered. (My new goal: To play the fugue in public on the oboe by senior year. Without passing out, lol. My oboe teacher seemed to think that I am going to pass out one of these days.) So yeah. That is my next project: Finding a place that buys instruments. I know Paiges does sometimes, I might try there. Ah well. Another battle for another day.   "I've been rejected...twice!"

      Wow. I was surprised. Of course, when it's July 10th, I don't usually expect a birthday party.  YAY! More gifts! (Yes, I have a right to be selfish! Especially when it comes to the yellow pillow!) I was also surprised by the amount of time and work people put into this (i.e. Ash, Jane and the drawing, Ali and the rug). I had absolutely no idea. Well, that's a lie. The streamers gave it away as soon as I walked in the door. :P  I LOVE ALL YOU PEOPLE! YOU ROCK!   And now it's time for Sarah to do some more interior decorating. (GRIN!)

      Hello all! What a blast we had today!! I'm kinda glad that's over though. There was sooooooo much to plan! I think it worked out well. I'll let Sarah give the specifics though.  Over all though, I know that I had a good time just being with my friends. Some interesting conversations about flame throwing ninja swords came up, and fun was had by all, I believe. And then, people tickled me, Ahem Evan, Clyde...and tried to take my socks, MICHAEL... But yeah. All in good humour.  I hope that everyone else had a good time. It seemed like everyone did, which makes me happy. I did come home and take a nap though. And everyone liked my cake! yay! I can give people the recipe if they want. (Just let me know. I could even post it on here) Well, back to quotes. Nathan got the last one, and I'm really too tired to go and look for scores, so you'll have to do them yourselves. Sorry! Ah, and with my quote thing. Your hard work will not be in vain. Whoever has the most points by the time school starts will get a cookie. Or possibly more than one. On ne sais jamais!  Otherwise, yeah. Not too much more here. Saw King Arthur yesterday. Nathan and I shared a seat. That was really uncomfortable. Fun, but uncomfortable. Stupid armrest was going into my back the whole movie! Ah well.  When my dad gets back from Canada, I think that I am going to meet him for lunch one day. I'm telling you all, don't worry. I can handle this by myself. I promise. I'll post later this week. "I've been rejected...twice!"

      pretty good movie. dunno if i liked it more than the first one, but i have to agree with olivia. the ending was definitely better than the first one.  hope everyone had a good 4th of july.  i got to go to chicago for a family reunion, but we didn't get to see much fireworks cuz it rained a lot before:( still pretty fun though, got to shop and eat in chinatown there...at least till it rained on us:-p  dunno about all of you guys, but summer has gone by so fast and it seems like we just got out of school.  must treasure every moment.  it's back to school comes august:(  i think this weekend will prove to be very interesting. there's so many things going on. my cousin's 21st birthday is on sunday and there's this other party this weekend.  just a socializing weekend.  can't wait for tomorrow though!!!

      I survived St. Louis. Even more of a challenge was surviving nine whole days without my computer.  Janice is now an International Trustee. I'm so excited!!! She deserves the position more than any of the other incredibly unqualified candidates.  If you want to know more, ask me. (I have some wonderfully strange stories, like almost being virtually raped on the dance floor. It's much funnier in person, believe me.)  Time for a new end quote! This one was thought up by Ash and me while watching pieces of "Les Mis."   She said that she liked the name Jean Valjean. I said that if she liked it so much that she      should name one of her kids after him.   I reminded her that       my kids are going to be adopted from various Asian countries. She told me, "SO? Name one of the boys Jean Valjean and send him to France." I replied, "Oh, yeah. I can see it now: The kid will be telling people - "Oh, I'm Chinese/Korean/Japanese/etc., but I have a French name and an American mommy. She sent me on a cruise in the Atlantic and left me here. I've been rejected... twice!"  "I've been rejected...twice!"

      Hello! How are all of you? I'm wonderful! My computer is working now, thanks to Evan who spent some time trying to get it to work.  Sorry about the three identical posts. The computer told me that it didn't post at all.....argh. Your new quote? Homines libenter quod volunt credunt. Have fun. Make sure to give me an author if there's one. (Which by the way, if you don't give me an author, you get 150 points instead of 160. If there's no author, I just give you the full 160.) Points: Alison: 900 Michael: 520 Nathan:510 Sarah and Marten: 470 Olivia: 460 Jonah:320 Evan: 160 It's been really quiet here. I should be doing my summer reading, but I'm not. I'm getting too lazy for my own good. I know though that I am not going to have all that much time next year, and so I'm enjoying not doing anything. Ah well.  I'm gonna go upstairs and read. yay...  "LOOK! Purple tuna!"

      Update since my last post: I saw The Notebook, and it is THE MOST ROMANTIC MOVIE EVER! If you like romance/chick flicks, DEFINITELY go see it!  The PA Institute is now over. Actually, today was my first day without classes (besides the weekend). The showcase went very well, I remembered 99% of the words and got some very nice compliments afterwards. Thank you to the Comstocks for coming!! (Other people came, too, but out of those the Comstocks are the only ones who actually read this.)  Hope everyone had a good holiday! On Saturday I went to visit some family friends (I call them my aunts) in Cincinnati. We went swimming in their pool and went out to dinner and for ice cream. Yum. :o) Last night I went to see Spiderman 2, it was good, full of action! And it had a happy ending (unlike the last one, sheesh, I thought I was going to die)! I need happy endings, lol.  This coming Saturday I leave on a youth group trip to do Habitat for Humanity in Tennessee. I'll be back on the 18th (technically I'll be back in town on the 17th, but won't actually be home until the next day). The trip was absolutely amazing last year, the best week of my life; I can't wait to see everyone again!! (My youth group goes with a youth group from Illinois; the other youth group has been making the trip for about 6 years now. They always stopped at our church on their way home, and last year we finally decided that we wanted to join them for the whole trip!) I don't know if I'll post before then, considering I won't be doing anything of note until the end of the week, so just plan on hearing from me when I get back. :o)  "LOOK! Purple tuna!"

      Okay, the quote last time was the play is over. Marten gets points for that. It can also be the drama has been acted out. These words announced the end of a performance in a Roman theatre, adn Emperor August said these words on his deathbed. I'm giving Marten points. Micheal, I'm not sure where you came up with that translation, but the reason the feminine part is in there is because fabula, is feminine. Otherwise, no one except Marten gets points. Sorry!  Anyways, your new quote is Crudelius est quam mori semper timere mortem. :-D Have fun. Think about the meaning!  Anyways, yeah. Just thought I'd update this. Sarah, as we all know, is in St. Louis right now. I went by and saw her mother yesterday. (And her father.)But that's a long story that unless you really want to know, don't ask. Ah well. I have to go get ready to leave!   "LOOK! Purple tuna!"

       Argh.  I'm  upset. More so than when  I  last wrote.  I'm  at  Sarah's  today, spending time with her. That at least is not upsetting.     I'm  just feeling avoided, and it's not a nice feeling and it makes  me  feel lonely. Lonlier than I already feel. Sorry this is a bit depressing, although you do have the choice not to read it.   So yeah.  I  think only  Sarah  really understands what  I  mean. (Although  Evan  also knows what's bothering  me , but  I  don't think he reads this.)   But yeah, let  me  get to happier subjects...   On Wednesday  I  went to go see  Evan . He called  me  earlier that day and asked  me  to come over to get something that he got for  me  in Minnesota. He got  me  something that is awesome and is very... me . He found a three cd box set of  Edith Piaf , a French singer from the forties (? I'm not quite sure of the year...) She sang "La vie en rose" and a bunch of other stuff that  I  don't think that any of you will know, unless you like older French music. But it is awesome.  I  stayed over at his house for a while and  we  listened to music, talked, and played with his dog,  Bren . :-D It was nice, and it made  me  happy.    After that  I  went to  Sarah's  house, and  we  went to the VBS thing, which again was fun.  We  played with the magnets that make words. :-D You know  we  had to have fun doing that! lol.   Thursday was our party for  Jane  and  Alison , which made  me  happy. They had fun  I  think.  Olivia  wrote a long post on it, so you can read that, and ergo it's less for  me  to type. We played Taboo though.  Sarah  and  I  had that ESP going and many times she stole my thoughts! lol.  Alison  thought that  I  played the clarinet, and then used it as a clue for  Olivia . It was fun, and we need to do that again. It took my mind off my troubles and ergo was a good thing.    The next morning  I  got up at like 7h30 and got donuts for us. Then  Olivia  and  I  watched ER until 11 when  Sarah  woke up.  Olivia  left at noon, and then around 2,  Evan  came over. He couldn't stay long b/c his sister needed the care, so when he drove home,  I  followed him, and then brought him back.  Sarah  left around 4, and  Evan  left at 5h30, when his dad came to get him for a movie.    Yesterday,  I  found out that my computer's broken, so  I  went to  Sarah's  house and  I  stayed there for a while.  I  even brought  Cha cha  over. That was fun, and all the dogs got along well. We went shopping at Target, and  I  bought a skirt. (And it's very nice. Short,, but not too short. ANd plaid! :-D Olive green. )   Then  I  went to church this morning and directly from church  I  came to  Sarah's . Well, this was longer than  I  thought it was going to be, Before  I  end:    Jane  and  Ali : It'll get better and you'll both have sooooooooo much fun!  I'm  sure!!!! You're in our thoughts and we miss you!!!!!!!    Sarah : It's going to be alright.  I'll  be there with you tomorrow, and  you're  in my prayers. :-)    My last quote: From the bottom of the heart (  I  think)   Ah well... I'm  going to go read my summer reading now. Oh, and if  you  think that  you're  the person who  I  need to talk to, why don't  you  talk to  me , okay? Thanks.       "The strawberries and pineapples are having a nice, big family reunion.

      Credit goes to Olivia for her thorough entry. YEAH! Less for me to type!  It was a blast! We all headed to Ash's around noon, where we had rice for lunch (courtesy of Ash herself), along with chips, Coke, and fudge cookies.   Of course, Jane and Ali kept trying to feed cute lil' ChaCha under the table. (I don't think Zataran's would have worked with her stomach.) I set the table (as seen in the picture above) with special "sparkly" plates, color-coded drink glasses, and - my personal surprise - masks for everyone! (clockwise from top left - mine [the red one], Ash's, Jane's, and Ali's [on the bottom left])   Jane and Ali looked so cute in theirs!     Olivia and  THE  Fanta!   I gave Jane and Ali a gift basket I had prepared for their dorm, filled with snacks, a sign saying "No Swimming Suits After Dark" for their door, notebooks (Ali's said "All about me," Jane's said "Estrogen bomb"), frames (for our pictures - HAHA), a plaque saying "the distance between friends is never too far," and one of those duck cards that says "You're leaving? Waddle I do without you? I'll be thad."     Afterwards, we all went into Ash's formal music room to play some tunes. Jane and I shared the "melody harp," Olivia looked at some of Ash's sheet music, and Ash, Jane and Ali played some tunes on the keyboard.   Mom called once she pulled up into the driveway to take us to the movie. Jane picked up the phone, and this was all that we could hear of their conversation: "Allo! Allo? Allo... (here's where Jane goes into her "stereotypical Asian accent") Who dis? (pause) No. No hamburger. You want fried noodle? (pause, then Jane pretends to get angry) Fine! No noodle for you!" (hangs up)  I think we should all just take a break here and laugh our heads off. (Jane, you are SOOO doing that in front of Ash's video camera! I want that on tape!)  Then Jane had to go home, sadly, and we went to the movies. Then we went to the mall, which was hilarious. (At least it was to me, especially going into Saks! I love pretending to be posh!) Then we did all the stuff Olivia already mentioned. (Blah, blah, blah...) Then after Olivia left, I spent an hour eating lunch and watching country music videos while Ash read. And then our boredom was gone once Evan arrived! (Haha... I learned some swing dancing moves!)  JANE &amp; ALI: I AM GOING TO MISS YOU GUYS! You'd better be on AIM as much as possible!

      First, a (lengthy) summary of NYC.  Sunday -- got to the airport late, found out the computer system for the airline crashed. :-P Waited in line for another flight, finally left a couple hours later. Got lost in the airport in NYC. Eventually met up with my aunt. Went out to dinner in a restaurant that's literally built into a bridge.  Monday -- went to Rockefeller Center, Saks Fifth Avenue, Radio City Music Hall, and St. Patrick's Cathedral (note: spent a maximum of 20 minutes in each). Took an NBC tour, where they show you a couple studios and let you in on more than a couple production secrets. ;-) Had tea at the Plaza Hotel, which is beautiful and feels very fancy. Tried caviar (!) Left my aunt for awhile so I could meet a friend who's a musician for dinner. We split a pizza and then went to his apartment, where I sang for him and he played a few of his songs for me. Super, super nice. :o) Took a drive with my aunt around the city to see some sites at night.  Tuesday -- took a carriage ride around Central Park, did a little more window-shopping (looked at engagement rings at Tiffany's, hehe), and went to the Guggenheim (art museum, built like a big spiral). VERY cool photography exhibit and not-so-cool abstract/minimalist sculptures. Went to see RENT on Broadway. I've seen it on tour but just had to see it on Broadway as well. Mel B from the Spice Girls played one of the main roles; she was actually good! Show was incredible, some things were better than the tour and some things were worse, but it was everything Broadway should be.  Wednesday -- took a drive to some different parts of the city (East Village, SoHo, etc.) before going to the airport and getting on my flight in the nick of time. Sat on the runway for about 45 minutes because of storms, but the rest of the flight was uneventful. Exhausted when I got home, but stayed online long enough to hear about...  PARTY!  So, I got to hang out with my Aching Sushi girls for about 24 hours, starting yesterday at noon. Jane had to go home after lunch (and after being presented with gifts for her and Ali's room at the Academy), but the rest of us went to see Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle. I thought it looked really strange in the previews, and I was right. haha But it did have some funny parts. Ali went home after the movie, and Sarah, Ashley, and I went to The Fashion Mall. Everything was too expensive to buy, except our meal in the food court, including dessert (of course). :o) Ali met us back at Ashley's house, where we played Taboo (SO fun) and then when Ali left again, we listened to music and read each other questions out of a book that's used to get to know each other, but in a very personal way. We finally went to bed around 2 or 3, but I couldn't fall asleep until 4. :-P Woke up around 9 and ate donuts and watched TV with Ashley until Sarah woke up. Then I went home around noon.  Now I'm getting ready to go on ANOTHER trip, family vacation this time. We're going to Canada to see some plays and visit relatives. I'll be back next Saturday, just in time for *gulp* school. But let's not think about that for now...though I do have a lot of summer reading to finish!  KEEP IN TOUCH ALI & JANE! I'll miss you! Sarah &amp; Ashley, I'll see you at school (at least, I'm assuming I'll have classes with you!).  "The strawberries and pineapples are having a nice, big family reunion.

      Well, I figured that I should  post, although I'm not in a great mood, and I spent some of tonight crying... Argh, I can't wait to get back to school. Seriously people. You all might hate it, but I like it. This has not been the best summer, and I want to put it behind me a.s.a.p. Seriously, not a happy Ashley tonight.  :-(  I'll get over it. There's some people I need to talk to though, and after that I should feel better. But yeah. Highlight of my summer so far I went to see the air show. I love it every year, but this year it was sooooo great. It was beautiful weather and I got to see the P 51 mustangs fly. yay! I am so going to fly one day. Seriously. It's my dream, and it has been since like 5th grade.  Betcha didn't know that, right? I'm also going to join the air force. More on this when I feel like writing.

      Supposedly, I had an ortho appointment today. WHOOPS! Ah, well, it's not like I was ready to get bottom braces on, anyhow. Ugh... If I get in sometime this week, I'll have painful teeth as I go in for my biopsy on Monday. Argh...  I'll give everyone three guesses as to what I  did  do today. :P Let's just say it involved Ash, Kohl's, Dad's credit card, three new pairs of jeans, and two new shirts. (I didn't even chance glancing at the shoes.)   WOOHOO! PARTY TIME!  Here's the lowdown on Thursday: -  Ash's house  at  noon until Friday morning  - If you need a ride, tell me, because I'll gladly pick anyone up. There may be a slim chance that my ortho appointment will be rescheduled, but even so I can still pick people up sometime that day. -  BRING MUSIC!  (Try to gather up all your CD's from middle school. We're trying to remember the good times while creating some new ones, people! I'm bringing N*SYNC, BSB, and O-Town - just their single - but bring all that you have since some of mine are cassettes and, thus, they suck.) - As far as  food  goes: Ash is making pasta/garlic bread, Jane's in charge of another side, Ali's bringing drinks, and I've got cups/plates and dessert. (Hehe...) Ali's also bringing popcorn and chick flicks. - Bring some  money  with you. We're possibly going to go to the  movies  to see that one movie with the two guys going to White Castle. (I know that I could look it up, but I'm too lazy. Sorry. You all know what I'm talking about.) We also are planning to go to the  Circle Centre mall , so even if you don't buy anything while shopping, bring some cash for if we eat dinner downtown in the food court. - Bring  board games/picture albums/cameras  for when we're back at Ash's. - If you have  anything else party-ish  (disco balls, anyone? :P), bring it.  Questions? Call me.  "The strawberries and pineapples are having a nice, big family reunion. What were you thinking?"

      I had an interesting two-hour phone chat with Jane today. The entire two hours centered around Jane wondering whether or not to make a smoothie. Here's just a paraphrased snippet of our conversation, about an hour after she started contemplating the idea of smoothie-making:  (Jane =  blue , me =  pink )   “I’ve decided to make a smoothie.”   “How long did that take you to decide?”   “An hour or two.”   “JANE! That’s why you just look in the fridge, find chocolate cake, and take it out and eat it. No preparation, no having to choose.”   “Are you eating cake now?”   “Mmmm…”   “Sarah! You pig!”   “Hee…”   (in Jane’s baby voice): “Okay. Let’s get the stuff out…”   CRASH!   “JANE! What happened?”   “Well, the thingy that I wanted was in this other thingy, and I couldn’t get it.”   *sigh*   “So, we get the strawberries out, and we find the ones that are ripe. OOH! This one’s pretty! And then there’s this one, and another one, and… EEEEW! This one looks funny!”   “For someone who just said she hated judging by appearances…”   (a previous conversation reference)   “This one’s going away.”   “What, on its own?”   “Yes, Sarah, it’s walking out the door and out of our lives FOREVER!  (pause)  It’s time for the little strawberries and pineapples to have a nice, big union in the blender.”   “Union? Jane, that’s sick!”   “I was talking about a family reunion! What were you thinking?”   “Let’s not go there, Jane.”   “SARAH! Mind in the gutter, as always!”   “HEY!”  (pause)  “What do you want?”   “Huh?”   “You’re still talking to me. You must want something from me, just like everyone else.”   “Jane, it’s wise not to ask someone with their mind in the gutter what they want.”   “Oopsies. Well, I know you want a smoothie.”   “No, I don’t. I don’t like smoothies. Heck, I don't even like fruit!”  (GASP!)  "  You’re insulting my smoothies! I thought you were my best friend! Look! The strawberry is hurt! It’s crying! In the corner!”   “Poor thing... How in the world does a strawberry cry?”   “I put it under the faucet. When I wash it, it’s wet from its tears.”   “…Or the faucet.”   “Tears!”   “Faucet!”   “Your arguing is making the pineapples mad!”   “Ooh… I’m threatened.”   “They don’t like you, you…butt!”   “Wait. I was already a butt.  [another reference to previous conversation]  Does that make me a double-butt?”   “Yes. Wait! No. You don’t have a really big butt, so you’re a… an itty-bitty butt!”   Just thought it was funny and would at least explain the new endquote. Good night.

      It happened again.  I went into the grocery store after church and was talking to the 20-something woman behind the counter about California and scouting out colleges when she replied, "Isn't it a bit early for an 11-year-old to be searching for colleges?"  Grrr...  Anyway, I posted a very short summary of Ball State on amarismoon.com. I couldn't possibly go into details about the week - there's too much to remember, and my favorite moments wouldn't mean much to anyone who wasn't there. It was a blast, and that's all you need to know. :)  I fell asleep after church this morning and was woken up at five till five by Dad, saying that we were going to the 5:10 showing of "Anchorman." Thanks for the notice... The movie was a great booster for my mood. :P I needed a comedy. Afterwards, we went down to Broad Ripple to eat dinner and window-shop (since all the stores were closed). Darn... I couldn't buy anything. :( (Maybe it's all for the better.)  And here's something for the record books: I'm planning on buying sweatpants sometime this week. (Yes, you can gasp now, especially Jane and Ash.) I'm going to Kohl's soon, and when I buy school clothes, I'm going to get one or two pairs. (I prefer pink ones, personally. :P)  I discussed with Ali a "girls day out" sometime this week, since Ali and Jane will be moving into their dorms on the 7th. :( We need to have a day just full of "girly stuff," you know: salon treatments, shopping, guy-watching (for Ali's benefit - haha), just hangin' out in someone's house, dancing to all the songs we listened to in middle school.  (And you know who'll be there with the digicam!)  You girls up for it?  "Shall we go to bed?"
