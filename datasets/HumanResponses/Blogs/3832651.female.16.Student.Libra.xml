      good morning! (actually its almost 1pm- i missed the morning cause i was sleeping, but jordan and briton so kindly woke me up at 11:15am with the loudest most obnoxious phone alert ive ever heard lol)...yeah, so im in kinda a weird mood..i guess cause we're leaving on wednesday morning and i still have alot of stuff to do..and since im the queen of procrastination, things i could have done awhile ago i didnt do and now its all kinda stressing me out...i still have to find someone to fill in for me at nursery on sunday cause ill be gone but i cant get in touch with anyone, i have to talk to josh about camp (i told him about how i wanted to go the last half cause i would be gone till the 3rd and he said he'd call me but i forgot to tell him im leaving wed morning so i have to call him today i guess, and its so last minute and thats probably not going to go over well with my dad, so if you think of it please pray for all of that and that it all goes smoothly), i have to pack/clean, i have to do summer reading (dang, i havent even gotten the third book i have to read yet!) and do the reports on them, just alot of stuff and im really stressed out...uuugghhh, i kinda wish we werent going out of town, but im kinda glad that we are, i dunno...so yeah, saturday i worked 1-5pm and then hung out with steph, she came over and we went to moe's for dinner (soo good!) and then went to britons and watched this standup comedian with him and jordan and travis, then went to rachel kuhl's house with her and micah and played ping pong and N64 for awhile, then steph spent the night and we woke up to her car covered in oil, saran wrapped and covered in kitty litter, which was alllllll over my driveway and she was late to church and i spent 45 min trying to clean my driveway...it was the guys and their "O.R." (aka, operation rachel) and they TPed rossin's and rachel k's house badly as well...hm, then sunday night i went to core with steph, bethany, lauren mills, megan f, and her cousin and it was really good...then steph and i said we wanted to go to taco bell and like half the youth group ended up going (we are such trend starters lol) then we went to lindseys house with travis, briton, jon, matt, greg, michelle, and nikki and played spoons and poker..it was a fun night, and today i dunno what im doing, trying to unstress myself i guess and get some things done...pray for me! have a wonderful day! :-D

      happy saturday to all! i havent written for a few days..probably cause i havent really been home much, but oh well...i went to rossin's on tuesday and spent the night and we went to visit karey at publix and we cheese-whizzed his car and wrote on it with deodorant and he came out while we were doing it and attacked us with the cheese-whiz and i got it ALLLLL over me, and we both reaked like mad...but it was fun...and we had another sleepover with senior gals on thursday at stephs house..and her and rossin and andrea and lauren s. and i went around before ppl got there and had 'dance partys on the go' and it was hilarious!! we pulled up in front of blockbuster and lauren and rachel and i jumped out and steph BLARED 'ice ice baby' and we went in front of the full length windows and totally busted out with these ridiculously gay but funny dance moves and andrea and steph were hysterically laughing from the car but no one in blockbuster laughed..they just turned and looked at us with really confused looks on their faces...so we did that at random places trying to get people to dance with us at our 'mobile dance party' and it was really fun...then that night we got micah and jed's car with a buttload of mc'donalds crap and they kept it all and dumped it at stephs doorway the next morning while we slept...we kept it and were going to put it in the bed of micahs truck but realized they would use it again on us and it would be NASTY by then so we threw it out, and just TPed his car instead...and when we went to rapids to do it OF COURSE with our luck he just moved to a new post, and it was the only place outta the whole park where he could see his car and he turned-and saw us all TPing it and he was soo mad but he couldnt do anything...then it rained like 30 min later so im sure it was quite a mess..then we hung at rossin's (her, me, steph, andrea, pete, and jordan) cause the beach wasnt an option anymore bc it was storming, and played N64, pingpong, and the sims...and i worked last night and today and stephs coming over in a few and we're gonna go out to eat and do something and shes spending the night...all in all, its been a fun week...im a little sad bc i tried to call anna c and anna b and see how tenn. was and they called back but we couldnt talk cause they have hardly any service, so oh well...i leave wednesday morning for our trip up north..i hope its fun! cause im missing several things that i wanted to do down here (concert with cf, um-oh gosh my mind just went totally blank and i cant remember the name of this for the life of me..but the concert with VANS and the buzz--ooh yeah i remember now, warp tour..yeah im gonna miss that too, and half of camp, i still dunno if i can go for the last half, and random movies such as catwoman, the village, and BOURNE SUPREMACY!! lol)so yeah, but im sure our trip will be fun, ill get to see joy and jamie in PA and hopefully joel and my NY friends cause i miss them terribly! well, im gonna go now, probably play some more sims cause im a loser..AND i payed like 6 bucks to rent it so i bettter play it! lol hope you all have a wonderful weekend! love ya!

      hello all, and isnt it a beautiful friday morning?? (it is...) lets see, what all has happened since i last wrote? hm, well, on wednesday karli and anna c and i went off to gardens mall to meet briton for lunch when he got off work and we ate chick-fil-a (surprise surprise, i know lol) and then karli dropped us off at kings to get the whale and she went home for a bit and anna and i chatted it up with puckett for a few min while he was driving around in his golfcart (of course!)then went back to her place, only to leave again and make a 441 run and go to old navy and ross (were anna got this awesome shirt that says 'im a keeper') then back to annas to get ready for youth group with karli! then we went to CF, which was really good as usual, and justin winters came!! he came in late and i about fell out of my chair during the announcements or whatever was going on up in the front as i frantically waved my hand and loudly whispered 'juuussstttiiinnn!!!!!' just so shocked to see him cause it had been fooorrreever! buuut anyways...then afterwards karli, anna, me, and justin went to duffy's to eat and jordan and briton and travis and jon and ashley and her bro all joined us later on and we ate and had some fun...and our waiters name was 'adam'-he was a great waiter (a fact that we would tell him anytime he would come to our table for something or even just walk by us! lol) then anna and i dropped off justin at his house, he lives in riverwalk and anna and i are sooo moving there and never leaving our gated community! lol its sooo awesome! they have a gas station, car wash, two pools, town hall with BINGO!!, hair salon, ice cream parlor, post office, i dont even remember it all but it was soooo cute and we loved it!, then we went back to anna's and i spent the night and briton and jordan came over for a little bit and we basically just sat around doing nothing the next morning (thurs) anna and i were woken up to jordan beeping us at like 11:30 (we were very upset) so we got up and were soo in the mood for breakfast food, like hashbrowns, mmm....buuut it was about noon and so most places werent serving breakfast anymore, so we thought hey lets go to dennys, then remembered we're poor, so we went to taco bell (such a good place to eat when you have hardly any money) then rented office space which was funny at parts (loooved the squirrel man!!) but we didnt realize it was rated R and it had alloooot of language in it so that wasnt cool...buut anyways, jordan came over and hung out for awhile, then i went home and went off to work and came home and slept, and that has been my life the past two days! tonight im going over to rachel kuhls house for an all senior girls sleepover with all the girls in our grade! that should be fun! and i get to see my precious lianne that i miss sooooo much!!!! and rossin gets back today! woo woo, i called her this morning and she was on her way from idaho to salt lake city! she loves it! lol well, thats about all, i know this was long but oh well, you can deal with it! lol love ya, have a faabulous day!! :-D

      hello to all! well i was looking at my posts, and this darn website posted like two of them out of order...sooo, its kind of like a game, you have to figure out if they are in order or not lol i dunno why its doing that but oh well, im over it...so, whats happened lately...i dont really remember the last day i wrote on this so ill just kinda tell you a few things that i remember that happened lol...today i went to lunch with my dad to A1 Thai, that was fun, i love little outings with my dad lol and we got to talk and it was just a good time...sunday night i went to core with anna and karli (love those girls!) it was great..then we went over to karlis house with travis, kevin, lindsey, and nikki and watched poker and went for FREE SLURPEES!!! cause it was july 11 (7-11 haha clever i know!) my new fav holiday! lol then i spent the night at anna's house and we had some good car chats again like always...actually car ventings is more like it but i enjoy them lol...then yesterday i came home, ran some errands with my mom, had a horrible afternoon (just a bunch of stuff, my mom was sooo anti discussing me going to camp, my dad was upset cause my phone bill was eighty something bucks, i found out i had to work that night and i totally wasnt planning on having to go in, just everything was getting on my nerves) and so i locked myself in my room and did my devos and prayed alot (and cried some lol) and by the night i was in a better mood and i got to work with kimberly whom i havnet seen in months and she told me about her missions trips and it was just really good. then i came home and had a really good talk with rossin...you know what? God is soo awesome, i mean just spending time with Him put me in such a better outlook, and He does little things all the time just to remind me that He's there and He really does care...and today my dad was so open to talking about how i could go to camp which just shocked me and i was just like "thank you God sooo much!", ahhh its just so awesome to be able to go to Him with everything and be able to just trust that His will will be done and even if its not what i may have wanted, its for the best in the long run and ill see that later on....so yeah, ive just slowly been learning to give God all my burdens and worries and to pray that what i want for me would be changed to what HE wants for me...well, i must be off to continue my laundry and room cleaning, exciting stuff i know! lol i hope that you have an awesome day!! :-D

      ok yeah i know i just wrote something, but i was changing my profile and i had this in there cause i read it on my friend denise's and really liked it and i didnt want to lose it cause it's soo good..so i thought i'd put it in here so you guys can read it too! its soo true and really makes you think...                                                                                               "Are you ready to worship? Worship is not a song.  Worship is my response to God with all that I am to all that He is, all that He has done, is doing, will do in me, through me, around me, and inspite of me.  But it's not just a song.  Worship is our response with all of our lives, everything that we've been given, to all that God is. And so if we come in here in this place and we raise our hands and we raise our voices and we don't stretch these hands out when we leave this place to feed the hungry and clothe the naked and fight for the poor and the oppressed, then what you and i have done is worshiped a singer or a song, and not a God... So let me as you again, are you ready to worship?"

      well im back from vaca and camp! it was alot of fun. we went to my grandparents house in maryland for a few days and my aunts house (i got to drive her brand new bmw convertible! lol) and the rest of the time we spent in honeybrook, pa. and it was soo awesome! i got to see joy and jamie whom i havent seen since last summer, and i love those girls to death, they are so great! and matt and i made a bunch of new friends from up there and we got to hang out with them alot..and they even took us bowling which i always want to do but no one here ever goes! lol i actually won a game too, impressive i know lol..then i went to camp on wed (it was such an ordeal to get there bc of the rental car stuff and whatnot, but i finally did) and it was soo great..i was really pumped to see everyone, especially anna steph and karli, and God was speaking to me alot in the short time i was there..He's just really been showing me that i put soo many stupid other things before Him and im trying to find satisfaction in so many other things when all i need to do is learn to fall totally in love with Him and just focus on Him all the time, not all the superficial stuff around me..and last night i got to talk to ross for a couple hours just about all sorts of stuff that has been going on and what i was learning at camp, and just the struggles that each of us is going through..i love her soo much! i dunno what i would do without my rossin! honestly, we've been pretty much best friends since 6th grade and shes the one person that i tell basically everything to and i know that she's there for me and that i can trust her..its so great to have friends like that and i thank God soooo much for putting so many amazing people in my life!! well...i better get going and work  on my summer reading projects..ive put it off enough! school starts monday (uuuuugggghhhhh) and i think i have the WORST schedule ever, but oh well, the seniors go to southwinds this weekend!! woo! have an awesome day and dont forget to include God in all of it! love you!
