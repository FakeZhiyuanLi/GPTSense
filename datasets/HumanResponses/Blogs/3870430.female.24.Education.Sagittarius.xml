      Ok. Once your profile is finished, go back to the dashboard.  You'll see your blog there - click it, and you should immediately have your posting screen up. This is&nbsp;where all your posts are stored and organised - at the moment, it will say "NO POSTS FOUND". Click "create post" and you're ready to go.   OTHER THINGS:  You have&nbsp;four tabs&nbsp;to work with here: posting, settings, template, and view blog. We'll look at these in more detail later, but basically...  -POSTING is where all your writing happens and is stored -TEMPLATE gives you access to the HTML code -VIEW BLOG lets you preview what the blog will look like when you post  SETTINGS is the tricky one. Explore it in your own time, but&nbsp;remember - if you don't understand it, you probably don't need to. (there are "?" tags attached to anything that has a help file, too).&nbsp; You will need to change the date/time in formatting - we are in GMT 10. For the moment, you can ignore the "blog members" stuff.  Next up: links, comments, and site meters!

      Next, you need to complete your profile.   1) You should be on a screen with a dialogue box, ready for you to write things in it. Up the top, there's the "back to dashboard" button - click it.   2) you'll see your blog listed in the "blogs" box. On the right, there's "edit profile". Click it.   3) DO NOT select "show my real name". DO enter your real name. &nbsp;Worry about adding a picture later. add your IM name if you like.&nbsp;Remember that birthdays are written american style (mm/dd/yyyy).&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      This is the Important Post -&nbsp; "how to make a blog".   And its not as scary as it looks.   1) go to  urlLink www.blogger.com   2) click "createyour blog now"  3) fill in the form. Remember that your username should be different from your post name, and you need to tell me your passwords.&nbsp;Your post name must be your REAL FIRST NAME. You can choose later whether to display your email address or not, so do enter it here.   4) choose a title and an address. For example: this blog's title is "the hub", and its address is  urlLink www.eightshub.blogspot.com .  5) choose a template. There are a lot more than there ones out there, but for the moment just choose one here. You can upgrade this later.  6) the program will now make your blog.  &nbsp; ps. Big congrats to Tom - his site is already up and running. Smooth work, Tom!

      Hi 8S!  This is the first post on this blog. You'll notice that the oldest posts go to the bottom, and the newest ones at the top.   This blog has a couple of purposes:  1) This is where I keep track of everyone's work. You can find everyone's blogs linked from here.  2) This is&nbsp;where I will post trouble-shooting guides 3) This is where I will post comments on the progress of the whole classes blogs, and on how the project is going in general.  If you have questions - post them in the comments box and I'll read them there.  Cheers, and enjoy!

      Hi all,  There is another blogging issue that I would like to mention here, just to clarify a point that some people have been confused by.  If you have a blog -  any  blog - that is in any communication whatsoever with the 8S group, it counts as a "school" blog.  Setting up a "school" blog and a "personal" blog will not get you out of following the rules.  You are still accountable for what you write in any blog that is seen by anybody in 8S, or by me. As you know, one of the major points of the blog project is learning your responsibilities as digital citizens, and as such you are responsible for  everything  you post, no matter where it is.

      Hi all,  I think we've done pretty well to get this far without a major problem. However, we have had a problem, and now I'd like to get it solved. As you know, the blogs are a public forum, and therefore I will explain the problem publically.  The problem is our first major breach of the rules. Specifically, Tom has left an offensive post on Peter's blog. In the post, Peter was attacked personally and described offensively. For this, Tom has received a strike.  Here is the comment I left in response to Tom's:    Hi Peter (and everyone else reading this blog)  As I'm sure you know, Tom's comment here breaks the rules we have established. Calling someone a "dick" is disrespectful and offensive, and because of this, Tom has received a strike. Two more strikes and he will fail the blog assessment.  I have left Tom's comment up as an example of how not to communicate. Tom, I'm sure you had something you wanted to say here, but you used the wrong language to express it. I will discuss this with you next class.  Zoe   I hope that you will agree that this issue has been dealt with fairly, and is now finished with.  Zoe

      first of all - thankyou to everybody who has been posting comments here at the Hub. Its made my life a lot easier, and I think - I THINK - we've got everyone listed, and everything pretty much under control.  You guys are my eyes, ears, and beta-testers - if you click a link on the Hub that doesn't work, notice something missing, or see something broken, I won't know unless you tell me. Pretty much everything that has been fixed or made better here has come from your comments - so thanks guys, I appreciate it. Keep it up.  I'm really thrilled to see how supportive and generous people are being on the blogs comments lists. I think we all know that this isn't the right place to share the darkest secrets of your soul, but I have noticed that whenever someone says they're feeling a bit down, six comments will go up to make them feel better. It goes to show - 8S really is a supportive group. Well done.  Special mentions for this week go to...  MEG for having the first on-line poll, and for accepting criticism gracefully (I cannot stress enough how valuable a skill that is)  LACHLAN and EVAN for having excellent (but not  quite  matching) backgrounds, and for offering to share their knowledge with anyone who wants to know - thanks, boys  DAVID for a particularly interesting (and very funny) criticism of George Dubya Bush  BLAINE who, after a relatively late start, put up a first post so insightful that he got a supportive comment from another melbourne blogger  in the real world...   TOM for a very impressive combo of quality  and  quantity (how am I supposed to read all of that? Huh?)

      OK everybody...  I have read over all your topic suggestions, and here are this week's topics. You should respond to both by this time next week (or during this lesson if you have time). Remember: you are welcome to disagree with people - in fact, I encourage you to - as long as you maintain respectfulness. If you are going to voice an opinion,  always  back it up with reasons.  Your social topic:  Should there be restrictions on the media for the personal privacy of celebrities?   Your  Northern Lights  topic:  What similarities are there between daemons and their person and armour and their bears?    This week (and on a couple of other weeks), there is a special extra topic. This topic is going to be part of my thesis - an exteded research project I'm doing at university. It is:   Considering how much you use computers at home, what should you be learning about in school – the skills involved in how to use computers, or the responsibilities involved in how to use computers?   (And remember: don't just write what you think I want to hear. My personal opinion on this one might not be quite what you think it is...)  cheers,  Zoe

      Hi all,  This is a serious post, which we will discuss in class tomorrow. Having consulted with other English teachers and the school, it has been decided that a modified "strike" policy will apply to the blogs.  Any breach of the blog rules, which are posted on this site, will receive a strike.   As you know, the blogs will be assessed. Three strikes means that you will fail the blog task.  Based on what I have read so far, I don't expect anyone to fail from breaking the rules. In fact, I have been truly impressed at how well everyone in 8S has done - there are people who have developed beatiful templates, insightful posts, and some pretty good jokes, too. I'm extra impressed by the way almost everybody has stuck by the rules, even when it was tempting for them not to.  In other words - great work.  Zoe

      (Hi all - we will be doing this in class, but if you want to get ahead of the eight ball - and let's be honest, most of you already are - this is the CHECKLIST. Use it.)  VITAL STUFF CHECKLIST:  I am signing off using my first name My full name is not displayed My blog accepts authorized comments only My blog does not use an underscore My blog is in the right time zone Zoe has my password  (Once you’ve got these, TELL ME and I’ll mark you off with a big tick).   THE VITAL STUFF: HOW TO DO IT…  To sign off with your first name… ·         Go to “dashboard” (from the top right of the screen) ·         Go to “edit profile” ·         Change “display name” to your real first name.  To not display your full name… ·         Still in “edit user profile”, uncheck the box marked “show my real name”  To accept authorized comments only… ·         Go to “settings” ·         Go to “comments” ·         Under “who can comment?” choose “only registered users” ·         Under “default for posts” choose “new posts have comments”  To get rid of your underscore… ·         Go to “settings” ·         Go to “publishing” ·         Change address to something using only letters and numbers  To get the right time zone… ·         Go to “settings” ·         Go to “formatting” ·         Scroll to “GMT 10: Australia/Melbourne”  To tell Zoe your password… ·         Go tell Zoe your password.

      (And now, the checklist continued - this is the cool stuff. You'll just have to wait till class for the links bar info, because as I mentioned, I haven't worked out how to post code cleanly yet.)    WEB COUNTERS:  Web counters measure how many people are visiting your site, how long they stay for, and also who they are. The blogger software doesn’t have a webcounter built in, so we have to get someone else to do it for us…   urlLink www.sitemeter.com  is a good starting place. Its free, and it works. Go to the site, and click “sign up”. Click through until asked to enter your blog address (eg.  urlLink www.eightshub.blogspot.com ), blog name (eg. The hub) and codename. DO NOT use a word you use as a password – this codename is public. My codename is “chickenchicken”.  Next you’ll be asked for basic, non-invasive information. Keep clicking through, and the program will send a password to your email address. Open up your email, copy the password, then back to sitemeter. You can now log in to site meter.  Once logged in, go to “manager” (on the menu bar). Scroll down to “adding site meter to your site”, click “instructions”, then scroll down to “adding site meter to a blogger or blogspot site”. From there, just enter your site details (and yes, I checked, its all safe), and it will put the meter on for you.   FINALLY… PICTURES!!  This is actually pretty easy. Posting pictures uses pretty much the same technology as messenger – and I know you know messenger.  Like the webcounter, you can only post pictures by using an external program. A free program is provided called “bloggerbot”, which is provided by “hello: picasa”. The difference here is that it’s a program, not just code, and you have to download and install it somewhere. By “somewhere” I mean “your home computer”. So guys – please do this at home. Do it at home or a) it’ll get very messy and b) Zoe will get into lots of trouble.  The easiest way to set this up is to go straight to hello. The address is  urlLink http://www.hello.com/how_bloggerbot_works.php . Read it, scroll to the bottom, and click “download now”. If people have trouble, I’ll post about it on the Hub.  Thanks everybody – we’re very close to having some very, very nice blogs up and running. Keep posting!

      I tried. Really I did.  I cannot make this program accept the code I have written as code. Instead, it wants to show it as actual words... at least, it does when I look at it. You might see something else.  Either way - I'm making a printout for everyone as a supplement.  cheers, Zoe

        Hi all!  Well, I've been looking around (and commenting on) all your blogs and I have to say - they look pretty good. The one thing that people seem to be having troubles with is working out what to say. This is a tricky thing - we've all got our soapboxes now, but what are you supposed to do with them?  I think we can throw quite a few ideas around on these blogs.  I'm going to hand out two topics a week for discussion - one will relate to Northern Lights, and the other will be current events/topics of general interest. If you have any suggestions, post them in comments right here at the Hub.  The next thing I'll do is put up links to everybody's blog, so you can find everyone else easily. I'm hoping that everyone will look at (and comment on) a range of blogs - read blogs that don't belong to your friends, you might be suprised by the ideas you find.  Cheers,  Zoe
