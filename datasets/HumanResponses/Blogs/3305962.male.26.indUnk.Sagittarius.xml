      I really wanted to come for today's meeting but the sudden onset of a sore throat(always a good indicator of an oncoming cold for me!) prevented me from doing so. I had also rented the DVD for "The Hours" to add some more tangents to the discussion but alas...  Anyway, here's what I thought of about the book...do mail in or post your thoughts(an update would be asking too much right?).  "The Hours" - Michael Cunningham  I suspect one of the reasons why people pick up this book is because they see Meryl Streep, Juliane Moore and Nicole Kidman(what DID they do to her?) on the cover. So in a sense it is the movie's success which propels sales of the book...not the way I'd like it, but hey, you gotta make a book sell right? Interestingly, the movie's success itself would have initially depended on the success of the book...so its kind of like coming round a full circle. The book fuelling the success of the movie initially and then the movie(assuming its a success too) paying the good deed back in kind. I suspect we're gonna see that happen soon with the Da Vinci Code too(I hear the movie is in the works).  Digressions apart, I thought the book was 'ok'. Not bad, not great...just 'ok'. Some of the themes that caught my attention were:  1. The use of symbolism - it was Dipti(yet to attend first BREAD meeting!) who pointed this out to me the first time when I was complaining to her about the unneccessarily verbose descriptions of everyday objects like cakes, chairs and flowers. She said that the description of Richard's worn old chair was symbolic of his own self and health. So then I started wondering what else was symbolic in the book. Was the almost-dead thrush symbolic of Virginia Woolf who though alive, wanted death? Was Clarissa's desire to not maintain order in her flowers her desire to introduce some randomness into her rather predictable existence? Was the second cake Laura's attempt to undo her earlier choices in life?  But alas, I never formally studied literature(unlike Dipti) so I shall have to talk to someone who does know "symbolism" to tell me more about these.  2. Lesbianism - does it need to be said? The women characters are either lesbian or tending towards lesbianism. Why? Is the underlying notion that only women can understand other women well?  3. Lack of choice - none of the 3 women seem to be happy with the choices they've made(or been forced to make) in life. Hence, the desire to escape and break free.  I've lots more to write but its late and my chest is really stuffy...am heading off for some hot water gargling and then bed. Will be looking forward to comments from some other members on the book as well as the name of the next book to read.  Rohin

      Folks,  taking just a step back before we actually start discussing the next book, was curious to know how the discussion about "unbearable..." went on the other day at crossword.  Keep Blogging:) --Sunil

       Michael Cunningham  was raised in Los Angeles and lives in New York City. His novel A Home at the End of the World was published to acclaim in 1990; an excerpt, entitled "White Angel" and published in The New Yorker, was chosen for Best American Short Stories 1989. His novel Flesh and Blood was published in 1995, and that year he won a Whiting Writer's Award.  ~Sushil

      In The Hours, Cunningham draws inventively on the life and work of Virginia Woolf to tell the story of a group of characters struggling with the conflicting claims of love and inheritance, life and death, creation and destruction. The novel moves along three separate but parallel stories, each focusing on the experiences of a particular woman during the course of one apparently unremarkable but in fact pivotal day.  The novel opens with an evocation of Woolf's last days before her suicide in 1941, and moves to the stories of two modern American women who are trying to make rewarding lives for themselves in spite of the demands of friends, lovers, and family.  Clarissa Vaughan, a book editor in present-day Greenwich Village, is organizing a party for her oldest friend, Richard, an AIDS-stricken poet who has just won a major literary prize. Laura Brown, a young wife and mother in 1949 Los Angeles, cares for her toddler and prepares a birthday cake for her husband as she tries to resist increasing waves of panic and feelings of alienation from her humdrum yet demanding life. And Virginia Woolf herself, the third woman, works on her new novel, Mrs. Dalloway, chats with her husband and sister, bickers with her cook, and attempts to come to terms with her deep, ungovernable longings for escape and even for death.   As the novel jump-cuts through the century, the lives and stories of the three women converge, stunningly and unexpectedly, the night of Clarissa’s party for Richard.  Winner of the 1999 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction and the 1999 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction  ~Sushil

      For those of you who missed the last meeting, which is *most* of you, here's a quick update on what happened.  Me, Uma, Mythri and Kanwar met on Sunday evening at Crossword for our discussion on "Indian authors". To be frank I was slightly apprehensive about having a discussion with such a wide topic and was unsure about how "productive" the meetin would be. Suffice it to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the way it turned out.  We started off by discussing the movies we'd been seeing for the past couple of weeks(off topic, but what the hell) and covered quite a few interesting movies before finally getting down to the discussion on the books.  I started off with my experiences with the autobiography of Dalit writer Vasant Moon titled "Growing up untouchable in India". The book was originally written in Marathi as "Vasti" and was translated into English for a primarily western audience by Gail Omvedt. The book is a simplistically narrated account of how the author grew up in a low caste neighbourhood in pre-independance India in Nagpur. I found the writing style a little too literal and straightforward for my taste though some of the snippets about how the lower castes were totally against Mahatma Gandhi and his policies(because of his alleged upper-caste bias against them) were interesting to know. Overall(I haven't finished the book yet) the book was a little trivial for an Indian who's been exposed, directly or indirectly to the caste system and might sound more "exotic" to the average western reader. Omvedt herself acknowledges as much in the introduction to the book.  I'll let Uma, Mythri and Kanwar send in their own updates on this if they feel like...as I don't want to be accused of "stealing their thunder" ;-)  We've chosen Shashi Tharoor as the author for the next reading, i.e. 1st August. You can read any of his fiction or non-fiction works for the meeting.  Rohin.  P.S. Kanwar was just too much. The dude came for the meeting after reading the *preface* to "English August" :-DDD But since he had so much fun in Goa, sab maaf!   	 		 __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!?

      Fellow Loafs  &nbsp;  My apologies for not making it to Sunday’s BREAD meet. My brother met with an accident and had fractured his left clavicle.  &nbsp;  The book I had picked for this meeting was ‘All the World’s a Spittoon’ by Samit Sawhny. It’s a travelogue. The book is about the author’s return to India after 5 years in London &amp; 6 months in Zurich. &nbsp;He decides to take the long route -&nbsp;the scenic route perhaps!  &nbsp;  England – Scandinavia – Russia – Mongolia – China – Tibet – Nepal – India  &nbsp;  The chap’s back in India now &amp; is the MD of a firm that develops and promotes tourism in the Andaman Islands.  &nbsp;  Though I am yet to finish the book, so far - ok. More when I am done. &nbsp; Manjusha

      I was forced to take a break from my routine life due to a sore throat accompanied with high fever. And I am not complaining despite the fact that I spent a day in delirium. The reason being I read something delightful. Sample this –   More About People     When people aren't asking questions  They're making suggestions  And when they're not doing one of those  They're either looking over your shoulder or stepping on your toes  And then as if that weren't enough to annoy you  They employ you.  Anybody at leisure  Incurs everybody's displeasure.  It seems to be very irking  To people at work to see other people not working,  So they tell you that work is wonderful medicine,  Just look at Firestone and Ford and Edison,  And they lecture you till they're out of breath or something  And then if you don't succumb they starve you to death or something.  All of which results in a nasty quirk:  That if you don't want to work you have to work to earn enough extra money so that you won't have to work.    I Do, I Will, I Have     How wise I am to have instructed the butler to instruct the first footman to instruct the second footman to instruct the doorman to order my carriage;  I am about to volunteer a definition of marriage.  Just as I know that there are two Hagens, Walter and Copen,  I know that marriage is a legal and religious alliance entered into by a  man who can't sleep with the window shut and a woman who can't sleep with the window open.  Moreover, just as I am unsure of the difference between flora and fauna and flotsam and jetsam,  I am quite sure that marriage is the alliance of two people one of whom never remembers birthdays and the other never forgetsam,  And he refuses to believe there is a leak in the water pipe or the gas pipe and she is convinced she is about to asphyxiate or drown,  And she says Quick get up and get my hairbrushes off the windowsill,it's raining in, and he replies Oh they're all right, it's only raining straight down.  That is why marriage is so much more interesting than divorce,  Because it's the only known example of the happy meeting of the immovable object and the irresistible force.  So I hope husbands and wives will continue to debate and combat over everything debatable and combatable,  Because I believe a little incompatibility is the spice of life, particularly if he has income and she is pattable.    Reflections on Ice-Breaking     Candy  is dandy  But liquor  is quicker    These are some of the poems from a collection called “Candy is Dandy – The Best of Ogden Nash” that I own. I am planning to dive deeper into this strange “genre” of tongue in cheek, eccentric and nonsensical verse. Just so that this does not appear as completely tangential to the genre currently under discussion, there is a collection of verse by a Bengali poet called Sukumar Ray. His most famous book is  Abol Tabol  which is originally in Bengali. Sukumar is regarded as the master of nonsense comparable to Edward Lear, Ogden Nash and Lewis Carroll.  (Refer to the July 4 issue of The Week for a review of Abol Tabol which has been recently translated into English)

      Three women, at three different times, at three different places. But the central character of The Hours, is a book - Mrs. Dalloway. Though the premise of how this book influences and impacts the lives of these three different women was very interesting, even intriguing, I did get a feeling of 'Where is this heading?' in the initial chapters. The only certainty was that there would be one more suicide, at least.   The initial chapters left me feeling rather weighed down by all the imagery. There is almost a sense of contrivance about the parallelism of events in each of the three women’s days – their preoccupation with the task at hand, each receiving a visitor with whom there is a vague longing for intimacy, and each experiencing a feeling of inadequacy or a need to be alone, to escape. But then the denouement! And what a one! That makes it all worthwhile. And brings a rush of questions whose answers we must seek for ourselves.   I can’t help wondering what it must be like to be very old; to outlive everyone in the family, including one’s children; to carry the weight of all that has gone before, especially the bad times. I am sure it must be terrible beyond words. In view of such a future, I can’t help thinking, maybe Virginia Woolf had the right idea…..  And is it only literary coincidence that Laura's sweet, 'lovely', though ultimately rejected husband is called Dan Brown??  Happy reading!

      It isn't always self apparent. In fact you could be looking directly at it and still not see it. Not unless someone pointed it out or at that very moment you were part of it. Part of the Singles Club. And while you might not be able to spot the singles club at say your local flick shack or wine 'n' dine. You will definitely be able to 'single' it out at a discotheque or a java junction with a live band. That's how i came across it. Those invisible lines demarcated by human behaviour that seperates the couples from the singles at the above two places. And what is really interesting is that one situation is exactly the opposite of the other.  I will explain... Lets us take our band joints first. If you stop to look, you will notice that the singles sit up front closer to the band while the couples sit at the back. The reason being that way at the back the cacophony of the band is reduced to a level at which conversation can actually take place. As for the singles, the louder the band plays the better. The deafening sound numbs out the fact that they are actually alone.  In fact, if you think about it, it's probably from this side of the room that the famous band line, 'Anything, just play it loud,ok?' orginated.  Now in a discotheque the lines get a little blurred because of the sea of people that are stuffed into it like sardines in a can. But if you go on a slow night, you will notice that the Singles Club books its seats at the bar or in small coves far away from the dance floor. Of course, if you are a 'couple person' reading this you probably wouldn't have noticed since you would be too busy trying to cut a rug on the dance floor. But that's what i meant by opposite. In the live band scenario, SC is closer to the action whereas in a discotheque they avoid it.  Now i know there are probably exceptions, there's one for every rule. But if you were to take a consensus of all the band joints and discotheques world over. I'm sure you would get the same result 70% of the time.   Or you could just take my word for it.

      I travelled 100 kms today.  It's the farthest i have ever travelled when i hadn't planned on travelling.  My planned travel usually takes place on holidays when i go to Mumbai, Goa etc. On non-holidays (and there are many of them) i normally don't travel very far since there is always a need to come back. That need has always been present in my life in many forms. When i was small, it was logical to come back since i would have been unable to survive by myself. But as i grew independent i noticed that instead of reducing, there were always more reasons to return. Either because i had a family to care for or friends to keep or work to do or an existence to prove. In fact, i believe, if i travel out of my sphere of existence i.e., the sphere created by all those people who can either (a) prove my existence (my parents, relations & siblings) or (b) know that i exist (acquaintances, friends, lovers & enemies).  I would theoretically cease to exist. Yes sure i wouldn't die. But i wouldn't be known either. A John Doe if you may. I could introduce myself has Atila the Hun and my old self would cease to exist. I could rechristen myself a new life and a new lifestyle. And what an adventure that would be.  So why don't i do it??  Well i figure it's because the 'big guy in the sky' doesn't allow it. His unwritten rule probably states that you get to be only one person in one lifetime. Which is why he keeps increasing the size of your sphere. Keeps giving you reasons to come back. So i guess i'll just stick to my planned travel. Which isn't too bad an adventure really. There are still so many places to see and miles to go before i sleep.  Muah!

      It's all down hill from here on.  I think i can safely say that wednesday is my favourite day of the week. Especially when i have a sat & sun off.  Interestingly, wednesday derived it's name from Scandinavian Woden (Odin), Chief God of Norse mythology. He was once called the All Father and wednesday was the day set apart for the worship of Odin.  The vikings used to believe that when they die and depart Midgard(earth) they would be reunited with their forefathers and foremothers(their moms vere warriors too!) in Valhalla (Heaven).  And if 13th warrior is to be believed. Here is their prayer. Chant along if you dig it :-)  Lo there do I see my father.  Lo there do I see my mother, my sisters, and my brothers.  Lo there do I see the line of my people, back to the beginning.  Lo they do call me.  They bid me take my place among them in the Halls of Valhalla.  Where the brave, may live forever.  Muah!

      The following story is true while the names of places and characters are fictitious. Well almost fictitious. Narrated by the bartender at ‘Thank Gonzo its Frodo’ (TGIF).  "Hi, my name is Hairy, Sicko Hairy".   It was the same old line I heard him use a hundred times before. This was 101. He didn't know any other. But then his kind never does. Which kind is that you might ask? The 'mid-life-crisis-facing bald fucks who come to bars to get lucky' kind. While they are regulars they aren't really good business. They generally order one beer while puffing on Gold Flake Lights from a Marlboro Red packet.   Sicko was the worst of his kind. He had that slippery sick feel you usually get from the covers of flashy tabloid magazines. Decked up like a flea-market fashion model, he always smelled of cheap cologne and too much aftershave. But what would really strike you are his beady eyes set in their dark-circled sockets. The kind of eyes you get after years of staring at 'lulussexpalace.com' with the lights off. Today those eyes were staring at the cute female with the head band at the other end of the bar while trying not to catch the eye of her hulk-like friend.   And friends they were. You could tell by the innocent affection they shared for each other. Probably very old friends at that. I know them as Peaches & Paroski, 'cause those were the names of their drinks. California Peaches for the lady and a Guyparoski for the gent.  Vodka drinkers. Nice people.   Sicko couldn't take his eyes of her. His friends would have joined him. But they were too busy trying to calculate the best angle to look down the blouse of the foreigner near them with the large bosom.  Sicko deciding to try his luck, signals me not to refill his glass. He slithers over to the other end of the bar surprising the couple.  "Hi, my name is Hairy, Sicko Hairy", he drawls. The guy and girl aren't visibly impressed. Not in the slightest. Sicko's next few questions are general in nature but always directed to Peaches. That wasn't very smart because Paroski is now staring viciously at Sicko's jugular while his hand instinctively searches for a sharp object.   Sicko finally feels Paroski's glare burning a hole in the back of his head. He decides to include him in the conversation by challenging his right to be there. "So where do you work?" he asks. Paroski answers, all the while looking at Peaches for a signal. The way a Doberman waits for a signal from his master to kill.   Sicko clueless to the danger he is in foolishly invites Peaches to the local night club for another cocktail. Only his shallow eyes give away that it is his cock in her tail that he is really interested in. Tired of Sicko hitting on her and noticing the steely glint in Paroski's eyes as he finds a blunt knife, Peaches decides to end this charade.  With all the grace and tact of a lady she snubs Sicko's advances. Paroski provides the coup de grace by suggesting that maybe Peaches, her husband and he should get together with Sicko one evening. He promises a 'smashing' good time. The fact that he is not wanted finally sinks into Sicko's thick skull. Sheepishly, he crawls back under the rock he came out from.   Silent cheers explode from the eavesdropping crowd, which is pretty much, everyone at the bar. Peaches & Paroski smile at each other then call for the check. I bring it to them but refuse a tip. "Seeing Sicko bested is enough of a tip", i wordlessly say. They wish me a good day and take their leave secure in the knowledge that i will remember their order when they return.   Peaches and Paroski. Vodka drinkers. Nice people.

      I meet alot of people at work. My job is such. But even when i'm not earning bread, i seem to make new acquaintances quite often. If i look back, i have always been something of a people magnet. Right from my school days. Some say i have a knack for making people feel comfortable, which is why they like to talk to me.   And while the rest of the world might believe that this particular personal trait isn't important enough to deserve its own blog... I beg to differ.   You see, i'm in a fix. When i was younger i would be able to pair a name with a person's face faster than a super computer could say 'blue'. But nowdays, it's become a herculean task. Maybe every human being has a pre-defined memory limit on the amount of visual and verbal information they can store in a lifetime. Maybe that limit is enough for most people, except due to my special trait, i have used up all my space.   Well whatever the cause, it's became clear that this was a problem and a most embarrassing one at that.   People do not take it kindly when you don't remember their names, first or last. In fact, in some cases, they go to the extent of giving you a cold shoulder under the false assumption that you are giving them a cold shoulder.  Which at the end of the day, left me pretty much out in the cold.   I thought for a while that this whole, 'Remember my name' thing was just a fad that would die away eventually. But after a few more embarrassments i decided that a solution had to be found.  And Voila! after great deliberations (scratching my head for 5 mins) i came upon this brilliant idea! I would create a ruse, wherein whipping out my cell phone i would offer to take down their number so that we could further cement the foundations of our friendship. And in doing so, nonchalantly ask them to spell their name so i could store it correctly on the phone.   Ah! the proverbial 2 birds with one stone. I would try it immediately, why suffer further embarrassment. The plan was foolproof!  Except for one fool.  Me.  I mean... how many ways are there to spell Sam?  Sigh!

        "Refurbish",&nbsp;is at the heart of every new idea these days.   The formula? Simple. Dust of the offending cobwebs, chop it up, add a splash of colour and  voila  you have something new and novel that will sell billions. We see it&nbsp;right&nbsp;from the ramps of Milan to the remixes of Bollywood.  Not that i mind terribly. I'm not obsessed with the concept of an  original idea  as say ... Adam Nash.  But once in a while a product comes along that just offends your IQ.   Ta Da Da Da! Ladies and Gentlemen,&nbsp;i give you "KitKat Kubes".  Ok, now we have all been brought up on KitKat's right?   We all know that the only way to open a KitKat bar is by running your thumb down the middle of the foil and then snapping it in half.  "Have a break, have a KitKat"&nbsp;is as famous as M&M's, "Melts in your mouth, not in your hand".  The idea was new, it was novel, it was red!&nbsp;and it heralded the age of&nbsp;wafer chocolates.  And now those same gurus of original thought gives us "KitKat Kubes".&nbsp; A refurbished KitKat? you ask. Literally, i say! Dusted off, chopped up and repacked with "Kubes" stenciled in offending electric blue.  Only an idiot would buy this product.  Seriously,&nbsp;if&nbsp;i&nbsp;wanted KitKat Kubes&nbsp;i would just take a knife and chop up a KitKat bar myself. Why would i go out and buy this horrible blue,&nbsp;over-priced version.  And to add insult&nbsp;to serious injury, "Have lots of little&nbsp;Breaks!"&nbsp;reads their  NEW  slogan.   ArrggH!!!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      While the name Sushil creates the urge to be self-expressive and dramatic, we emphasize that it limits self-expression and friendly congeniality with a moody disposition. This name, when combined with the last name, can frustrate happiness, contentment, and success, as well as cause health weaknesses in the liver, bloodstream, heart, lungs and bronchial area.   The name of Sushil has given you an appreciation for many beautiful and refined aspects of life--music and art, literature, drama--and the outdoors, where you find much peace and relaxation, but it creates a far too sensitive nature. You sense and feel much that you do not understand, and sometimes you are alarmed at your thoughts and wonder about their origin. You rarely experience the tranquility that comes with stability of thinking or emotional control.

      I only use 'Sush' around people i am comfortable with.  First coined by my best friends, it is used sparingly since it often gets confused for Sushmita or worse Sushila.  In fact while dabbling in the messy world of online friendships i used to sign-of my mails with the same nickname. I would never have given this practise a second thought if it wasn't for an  offline meeting gone amiss. The girl in question believed she was meeting an ol' girl friend of one month for drinks. You can imagine her shock when she saw me. Claiming i was a perverted opportunistic fraud, she swiftly and ruthlessly ended what i thought was blooming into a fruitful friendship.  Two hard learned lessons were learnt pat on that fateful evening:  1. 'Sush' will always be misunderstood for a member of the female species. 2. When a woman asks for your advice on which to wear to dinner with her boyfriend: The pink spagetti strap or the black halter top. She most definitely considers you a woman. . . . . . . For all those interested... i chose the pink spagetti strap. :-)

      I wrote a song, but I can't read music so I don't know what it is.  Every once in a while I'll be listening to the radio and I say, "I think I might have written that."  A friend of mine once sent me a post card with a picture of the entire planet Earth taken from space.  On the back it said, "Wish you were here."  Every so often, I like to stick my head out the window, look up, and smile for a satellite picture.  Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time.  I have the world's largest collection of seashells.  I keep it on all the beaches of the world...  Perhaps you've seen it.  It's a good thing we have gravity, or else when birds died they'd just stay right up there.  Hunters would be all confused.  I went to the bank and asked to borrow a cup of money.  They said, "What for?"  I said, "I'm going to buy some sugar."  I went to a restaurant that serves "breakfast at any time."  So I ordered French Toast during the Renaissance.  I love to go shopping.  I love to freak out salespeople.  They ask me if they can help me, and I say, "Have you got anything I'd like?"  Then they ask me what size I need, and I say, "Extra medium."  I went into a clothes store the other day and a salesman walked up to me and said, "Can I help you?"  and I said "Yeah, do you got anything I like?"  He said, "What do you mean do we have anything you like?"  I said, "You started this."  I have the oldest typewriter in the world.  It types in pencil.  What's another word for Thesaurus?  In my house there's this light switch that doesn't do anything. Every so often I would flick it on and off just to check. Yesterday, I got a call from a woman in Germany.  She said, "Cut it out."  I play the harmonica.  The only way I can play is if I get my car going really fast, and stick it out the window.  I've been arrested three times for practicing.  I put a new engine in my car, but forgot to take the old one out.  Now my car goes 500 miles per hour.  The harmonica sounds *amazing*.  I like to pick up hitchhikers.  When they get in the car I say, "Put on your seat belt.  I want to try something.  I saw it once in a cartoon, but I think I can do it."  When I get real bored, I like to drive downtown and get a great parking spot, then sit in my car and count how many people ask me if I'm leaving.  A friend of mine is into Voodoo Acupuncture.  You don't have to go.  You'll just be walking down the street, and... Ooooohhhhhh, that's much better...  I hate it when my foot falls asleep during the day because that means it's going to be up all night.  If toast always lands butter-side down, and cats always land on their feet, what happen if you strap toast on the back of a cat and drop it?  I bought a dog the other day...  I named him Stay.  It's fun to call him...  "Come here, Stay!  Come here, Stay!"  He went insane.   I put contact lenses in my dog's eyes.  They had little pictures of cats on them.  Then I took one out and he ran around in circles.  I made wine out of raisins so I wouldn't have to wait for it to age.  I can levitate birds.  No one cares.  I busted a mirror and got seven years bad luck, but my lawyer thinks he can get me five.  I like to fill my tub up with water, then turn the shower on and act like I'm in a submarine that's been hit.  I was watching the Superbowl with my 92 year old grandfather. The team scored a touchdown.  They showed the instant replay. He thought they scored another one.  I was gonna tell him, but I figured the game *he* was watching was better.  I stayed up all night playing poker with Tarot cards.  I got a full house and four people died.
