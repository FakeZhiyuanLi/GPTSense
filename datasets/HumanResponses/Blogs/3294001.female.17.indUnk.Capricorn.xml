      yesterday was a good day. i finished school at 12 and i was on the tram on the way home when max called.. from his 3phone which means he was back in australia =D. so i got off the tram and walked down chapel st from windsor to sth yarra. thats a mighty walk! then caught the train to flinders and got tim tam ice chocolate from gloria jeans and then went to max's. =D happy happy happy yay. i got lots of presents and theres presents for my family too. we went to see joedie at maccas then walked around the city and ran into people, leslie was getting his tongue pierced at off ya tree but you need a parent so i said i new a place where you dont have to be 18 so i took them all to peril and he got his tongue pierced and there was lots of blood. it was so cool and now im craving the needle again. anywho, it turns out i missed my train to vet but thats ok. its not everyday you get to witness a tongue piercing so i didnt mind making the sacrifice. after that i went to vet late and i actually did lots of work =D. well not reaally cos i just usually do no work. then after vet i went to see max again and i was planning to go home at 10 but then lost track of time and looked at the clock and it was 10.30. so we went to flinders and i caught the train home and ended up getting home at 11.40. hahahahaha

       omg these blogs have different fonts now! how excitement. today i decided that i do think the new computer tech is hot. at first i had my doubts but everyone was like "hes so hot!" and now i can see why.     mr shortell ran away to find a teacher so now we're doing nothing in IPM. yesterday i won a discman from the school canteen! hahahaa. i already have a discman and mp3 so im gona sell it. if anyone wants a discman then tell me!      hmm what else. this week has been pretty boring i have nothing to say.&nbsp; im so bored. i forgot my folio today. and i have double viscom so its gonna be such a waste of my precious time. =(    i love fridays cos i dont have english. and friday is max day and im gona see max today.. yay      ah now i have music. this will inspire me . im listening to in the grey. theyre playin on the 30th. i need do download stuff so i can sing along. these batteries are shit they dont even last for 2 days! but they are cheap only 2 dollars from the post office near max's school... fascinating i know.      im gona tell of the crime that was commited in my house a few days ago.    michelle stole my jacket! its like my warm jacket and i was planning to wear it to school&nbsp;cos its warm and has pockets so my hands will be warm and comfy. but then i went to get it and it was gone! i knew it was there the day before and i knew it was michelle. anywho i went to school, and i got home after vet at like 9.30 and i was freezing my balls of so i had&nbsp;a bitch to my mum and she said "michelle stole it" because she left it at work and mum cracked it at her =). so mum made her walk back to work and get it and then she tried to sneak it back into my room but mum cracked it at her again. when i got home i said to michelle "i know all about u stealing my jacket, u got busted" and she was like "what are u talkin about?". pfft. i cant believed my mum yelled at her. it saved me the trouble of doing it myself. maybe&nbsp;she does like me... no i think she just hates michelle too.      well there goes the bell. i have&nbsp; a free period now. laura mcervales gona go off to methods now.

      yesterday steve called me at 5am and woke me up. but i was half asleep so i didnt pick up in time then i called him back and it was busy. so he woke me up and i didnt even get to speak to him! thats sucky cos i havent heard from steve in a while. i didnt get back to sleep till 9am! cos my parents woke up at like 6 and were noisy then they left at 9 and i fell asleep then woke up at 11 and was like shit! cos my alarm went off at 10 but i slept through it cos i was fucked cos i cant sleep lately cos i been sick and cos i missed max.  and i was sposed to go to max's early cos we had things to do but then i slept in =(so went to maxs and i dont really remember what we did but yay cos i hadnt seen him for a few days.   today we woke up at 9am and it was so hard to wake up my eyes hurt so much i dont know why it hurt so much. then we went to maccas and had food and moyi was there and i havent seen her for a while and we talked about bands and stuff. i love moyi. then max went to get a haircut [his hair is cool] and i worked from 12-3. its armenas shift and its crappy and i only swapped cos i wanted the chance to sleep in for once but i ended up waking up at 9 anyway! so i shoulda kept my shift cos i need the money! =( oh well.  so yeah. i sold 33 helping hands in 3 hours =) go me. i was on fire. we got divided into partners to compete to sell the most hands and im with abdul but i dont get what hes supposeed to do cos he doesnt serve the customers.. he said he was there for verbal support but i didnt hear any support from him. if we win im so not sharing the prize =D. as if we would tho cos i only got one shift this week and the fulltimers get so far ahead. so yeh i sold 33 which means we get 3 gold stars by our team. go me. then when i left they wanted me to buy hands and sankalpa said he would give me free ice cream if i bought his [he makes the best sundaes] but then tracy said if i bought hers she would give me her brother. hehe. so i bought one from her and she gave me free fries and coke too so yay.  then i went to maxs and attempted doing ipm but i didnt get anything done then i went home.  EDIT:: apparantly mr moss died!

      well friday night went to gyroscope =D i met up with alecia and anne at flinders and we caught the train to bayswater (it took ages). at bayswater i got a hamburger cos i saw a sign that said hamburgers and anne got chips and potato cakes and we ate them (alecia had subway). anne tried to make me and alecia eat all the chips. we knew it wasnt her being friendly, but she was trying to fatten us up in case we got lost and she had to eat us. we were in an unknown land you see. anywho, after alecia lead us the wrong way we asked for directions and ended up going the way that i thought we should go in the first place.   anywho it took ages to get to the place and it was dark but there wasnt anybody stalking us. when we found the place (TLC Bayswater) it looked like some creepy house but when you went down the back theres like a huge shed that looks like a stable. it had massive doors. its a wierd place for a concert. all the people there looked kinda young. but we were cool. so we stayed out the front for a while and called chris to abuse him for ditching us but then we felt bad cos he sounded sad. but we have plans for the next gyroscope concert and alecias topless party so all good =)  so then we went in and paid our $12 and got a stamp on the hand then went to look around. we went to get merch and 2 people complimented me on my gyroscope tshirt =) then i bought another tshirt that wasnt as cool as the one i was wearing but i needed a souvenier. it was wierd there were couches at this place. so we bagged a squishy couch and sat there for ages then went to watch this band called tiltmeter. theyre pretty cool i got a free demo cd which is pretty good (listening to it now). then this other band played and they were ok i spose but the lead singer was icky and he spat and the bass player who was right in front of us kept coming real close and making faces like he was buttfucking a sheep or something. he had his picks stuck under the face of his bass and i wanted to steal one but i didnt.   after that gyroscope played =) us guys were lucky cos we got our places right at the front. the first song they played was confidence in confidentiality. it went off. hardly anyone had been moshing at all but as soon as gyroscope started playing people started jumping. everyone surged forward and we fell onto the stage cos there wasnt a barricade. alecia fell onto Daniels (the lead singer) microphone stand and it knocked him in the face. hahah then:  Daniel: "be careful guys the girls up the front are getting squashed"  Some dude in the pit: "your girlfriend wears army boots" Daniel: *smiles but pretends not to hear* Some other dude: (to Daniel) "Ha you got shut down!" Daniel: *ignores him and starts tuning his guitar* JAne: *bursts out laughing* i dont think anyone else heard or else they just didnt think it was as hilarious as it was. so they played more songs and alecia and anne kept falling onto the stage, i got me a position just behind them. i was leaning back into the crowd cos i was scared alecia was gona get hurt cos she kept landing with the speaker in her boobs but i kept falling on her anyway.  and brad (bassist) is so fucking hot when he screams =) after a while one of the speakers copped some damage and brad said "look what you guys have done.. gee wizz" and i burst out laughing again but nobody else thought it was funny. anywho, they played doctor doctor, the lesser me (i cut sick during that), get down, take this for granted, fire away, midnight express.. blablabla   when they finished i shook daniels hand it was nice and sweaty =) then anne was trying to pick up brad and he gave her a pick (he wouldnt give her the towel) then when i shook his hand he passed me his other pick! it was so cool! like a drug deal. haha. i was so excited. me and anne are his favourites =) after that we said byebye to alecia then went to maccas to find our lift home.

      well friday was punkfest day i met alecia at 4.30 and we went to missing link to get her ticket (i already had one) and they had sold out! then we got scared cos what if we went all the way to croydon and they didnt have any tickets! but we went anyway ever hopeful and when we got there we joined the line for ages and they said they only had 150 left! there were heaps more than 150 ppl in front of us but we stayed in line anyway. we were gonna sell my ticket and go get drunk instead cos we had lost of merch money but nobody wanted to buy just one ticket. chris came like an hour late but then people left and me and alecia went in but chris was still outside. it was ok cos he had friends. me and alecia went to buy merch i bought her a gyroscope tshirt as a bday present and the guy who sold it was the guitarist but i didnt even realise till 5mins later! he he said he liked my gyro tshirt =) i bought a kisschasy tshirt too. then we saw brad! (gyroscope bassist afro boy) and i told him that he gave me his pick in bayswater and he said he remembered me but i think he was just being nice. then i called anne and he talked to her on the phone and anne loves me. then he gave me a hug and ran away cos lots of ppl were coming up to him. me and alecia went to watch bands and bagged a couch and sat there for ages cos our feet were sore for standing in line for ages. then kisschasy came on stage but we didnt realise they were next otherwise we wouldve got in the pit. but then it was too late so we watched from the comfort of our couch. after kisschasy we found chris who got in an hour after us and he gave us sweaty hugs and i gave him back his sweatband that ive had for 8 months then we went to find his lost people again. in the grey played next and we went in the pit so we could get good spots for gyroscope. in the grey were really good, the crowd didnt really like kisschasy i think. after that was gyroscope =) doctor doctor and safe forever were definitly the best songs they are such good moshing songs they went off. when they played take this for granted brad jumped up on the raised platform for drums then he jumped off and tripped over. i saw daniel say "are u alrigtht mate?" then he got up and kept playing. i was kinda bummed they didnt play the lesser me but oh well. the stupid ppl in the crowd did that gay ass thing where they make a huge circle and people jump in and start bashing into each other. its so fucking stupid but i was at the front -right in front of brad- so i didnt get hurt. when they finished we went outisde and found chris and gave him a wacky hi 5 then gave alecia a hug and went home.
