      There are some pretty strange sayings out there.  For instance, "I have ants in my pants."  Now of course I don't have ants in my pants at all, but rather am feeling restless and unsettled.  I can just imagine what it would be like to have ants in my pants...itchy and uncomfortable (not to mention a little creepy).  I suspect that my current state of antsiness has to do with the fact that I'm looking forward to a long weekend and I'd rather be outside enjoying what little sun there is today.  I just hope that the ants leave me in peace for a while so that I can get some work accomplished today.

      Got my first  urlLink digital pictures  up.  These ones are from Tuesday night (the 26th) when my roommate and I went to Guam and Hoort's to watch the Two Towers on Hoort's new TV.

      Around this time of year I always get the urge to go out and buy school supplies.  Or at least wander through the aisles in the store.  There is nothing like getting new pens, pencils, paper, notebooks, etc.  As a kid, every summer I would wait in anticipation for the flyers to come out with the sales for school supplies.  Then I would sit at the table with my paper and pen and scour over all the deals making detailed notes about where each item could be found and for how much.  Not only was I excited to be getting new stuff for school, but I was also excited to be going back to classes.  I even looked forward to the homework and reading.  But now that I have completed my formal education I have no more need for school supplies...and yet the urge remains.  Maybe it's a sign. I can feel the classroom calling me...

      Well, I'm back from my whirlwind visit to Ontario.  I left work around 3 pm on Friday, drove 7 hours home and arrived in Cameron about 10:30 pm.  Chatted with my family for a bit, saw the new kittens (only a week old) then went to bed.  Saturday was the Wilson picnic.  All my mom's aunts, uncles, and cousins get together every summer for a potluck picnic and games.  It was a beautiful day and a good turnout.  I even got a little sunburnt.  After the picnic we stopped by my grandparents house for a quick visit and so my grandma could give me my birthday present.  Then home again to relax.  On Sunday I went to my home or my parents' church, whichever you want to call it.  Some of my high school friends were there, but not too many since most are out on their own too.  After church we went over to my Opa's house for coffee and more visiting.  Then we piled in the car and drove to Belleville for one of my cousin's baby shower.  We had a BBQ and cake and all kinds of goodies.  I also got to catch up with more family.  After the shower we drove back to Bowmanville where we had left my car and I headed back to Grand Rapids, and my parents and Opa headed home.    From the Fifth Wheel truck stop, I set out on 6 hour drive home.  The drive was uneventful except for the usual traffic in Toronto and the major traffic at the border.  It took me about 45 minutes just to get across the bridge and up to the gate.  Needless to say, that set me back an hour, and I got home later than I expected.  But was I glad to be home.  I went almost immediately to bed, and had no troubles sleeping.

      I have decided that I like check lists.  While it can be daunting to list all the things that you have to do, it is very satisfying to check things off when they are complete.  Then you can look back over your list of things to be done and see how much you've accomplished.  A very good feeling.

      I'm so excited, my camera arrived last night.  So I got to rip open the box, and unwrap packages and bags, manuals, etc.  Then I had to charge up the battery so I could actually play around with the settings and stuff.  After a  very  long hour the battery was charged, the memory installed and I was ready to rock and roll.  I took some random pictures of our living room and then tried some closeups of mine and a friend's face.  There are so many settings that I still have to read about, but what fun!  It's like Christmas :)  I also installed the software to download the pictures from my camera to my laptop.  One more thing to learn about and play with :)  Perfect timing too, now when I go home for a little visit I can take pictures with my new camera.  Can't wait :)

      Life is a miracle.  Last night my roomie were watching Maternity Ward on TLC.  An hour of pregnant mothers coming to the hospital and having their babies.  I know, it sounds kinda corny...but watching the mothers and doctors really drove home both the resilience and the fragility of life.  Some babies were normal and healthy, but others had problems that made birth very difficult.  One little girl with Spina Bifida had a sack of spinal fluid on her back that forced the doctors to perform a C-section.  They didn't want to break the sack and harm the baby.  Another little girl had a portion of her small intestine that developed outside her belly button.  Both babies underwent surgery and both came out happy and healthy.  Amazing.  Without modern medicine those babies would have died.  Life is too miraculous to be taken for granted.

      I want this week to go by fast.  Not because I'm waiting for though the weekend (though that is partially true as well), but mainly because I want to play with my new camera.  Last night I went to Best Buy and bought myself a digital camera to replace my old one.  Unfortunately they did not have the camera I wanted in stock, so I have to wait for it to be delivered to my house.  I got the  urlLink Canon SD100 .  Since my old camera was broken, I haven't taken any pictures in a while, so it will be great to have a camera again :). -- And a pet update...my sister's cat just had kittens...again.  Five little balls of fluff.

      ...on the subject of pets, thinking back about childhood pets makes me want to go out and get a pet.  A nice little kitten or something, though a tiger would definately be cool.  But I don't think the neighbors would like that...too bad.

      Some families develop strong emotional attachments to their pets.  My family on the other hand, has a rather strange relationship to its pets…as one of friends exclaimed, “you eat your pets?!?”  Now before you get all grossed out, I should explain that my family keeps some very unusual pets.  Sure we’ve had the ordinary cats, dogs, birds, and fish, those we don’t generally eat...that's gross.  However, we have also had pets such as pigs, wild boar, deer, pheasants, and other more exotic pets.  Take for example, Flag, our pet deer.  When we lived on the farm, my parents used to keep fallow deer.  I think we had a herd of about 30 or 40 deer.  Now for those of you who don’t know, deer are very skittish…they scare easily.  Whenever my dad would feed them, he would talk to them as he approached the gate, just so they would know he was coming.  On one occasion, despite his warning, one of the does got scared and ran into the wall of the barn, breaking her neck.  And it just so happened that this particular doe also left behind a brand new fawn.  Without a mother, the fawn would die, so my dad took the fawn to his parents’ apartment so that his mother could care for it.  The fawn was dubbed Flag - for reasons that I can no longer recall – and given a home in the laundry room.  My Oma fed Flag from a bottle and kept him warm and dry…and the tough little guy survived!  As Flag began to get bigger, he would jump out of his box and bounce around the living room.  I can remember one time when my Oma tried to fit Flag with a diaper, so that he wouldn’t make a mess on the carpet.  Needless to say, Flag was not impressed and won that particular struggle.    As Flag outgrew his box in the laundry room, my parents took him back to the farm and gave him a pen of his own.  He always loved to have visitors, and my brother and sister and I would pick grass and poke it through the holes in the chain-link fence for him to eat.  Whenever we walked past his pen, he would rub his antlers along the fence (quite a racket) to get our attention.  We would also take guests to see Flag and show them how to feed him through the fence.  We couldn’t pet Flag like you can a cat or a dog, but he was a fun and rather unusual pet to have around.  But like all things in life, all good things must come to a close.  One afternoon when my dad was feeding Flag, Flag knocked my dad down and tore through my dad’s jeans with his antlers.  As my siblings and I watched, my dad had to wrestle with Flag to prevent him from doing any further damage.  My dad came out with a very nasty bruise on his leg, but otherwise, he was ok.  My parents decided that Flag was getting far too dangerous to keep as a pet, and it was off to the butcher for Flag.  My parents put the meat in the freezer…that was some good venison.

      Well, that was fun.  I just finished updating the layout of my blog and adding some links.  I've also added a message board and commenting.  So now you can leave me messages or comment on my posts.  Fun, huh?  Now I just need to add some interesting stories, thoughts, ideas, observations, that you will want to read about :)

      Technology is a marvelous thing.  Last night my roomie and I had an IM conversation with a friend in Indiana and another friend in Texas.  Almost like old times...but not quite.  But being able to all talk together again, from our homes all across the country just shows the power of technology.  What better way to keep in touch?  Not quite the same as being able to talk in person, but for now its the best we've got.

      Greetings!  My roomie told me about this blogger site, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  So here I sit at a coffee shop, watching people and typing.  Since I got my laptop I've had fun dragging it around to various coffee shops and working in the midst of the noise and chatter.  Makes me feel a little less of a geek and it's interesting too.  The bonus of this particular coffee shop is the fact that it has internet connections available for use as well.

      *breaths a huge sigh of relief*  Finally, the web app is out of my hands and I am back in my comfort zone.  Now we just have to wait for our IP address to be set so we can redirect it to our app.  In the meantime I'm back doing my usual development which is wonderful.  Now I can finally address the issues that the clinics are having!  Feels good.  *sigh*    Now as the clock ticks forward I don't cringe at every second that goes by.  Five o' clock here I come!  Today I will actually make it home at a regular time and be able to just go home and not worry about this project.  How wonderful.

       It's a lazy Sunday afternoon, kinda rainy out but that's okay.  Here I sit at Urban Mill yet again, playing with the layout of my site.  The red and yellow was getting too glaring and bright for me,  so I went for more mellow blues.

      Last night was the first meeting of GEMS where we actually had a lesson with our classes.  That was interesting.  I can see that I will have to put my foot down next week.  Their previous counselor wasn't kidding when she told me I'd have to keep my thumb on them.  That is an understatement.  You would think that six 4th graders wouldn't be too much trouble.  Man, they were so loud!  Picture a room with six 9-year-olds sitting, or bouncing on their chairs, eating chocolate and talking/singing/laughing, throwing candy wrappers at each other, fighting over pencils, dancing around the room.  That was pretty much how the lesson went :)  But somehow we managed to get through our lesson.  I can see that some bribes would be helpful (though NOT candy!), maybe stickers.  At least now that I know my group, I can plan accordingly.    But don't get me wrong, these girls are a lot of fun.  Never a dull moment as they say.  And I certainly won't have any problems getting them involved in the evenings activities :)  Next week should be fun, but I should plan for some active activities...and bring bribes.

      I honestly don't think my night can get any worse. *knocks on her desk*  First of all, I've had a terrible weekend.  Usually I don't stress about stuff, but this weekend I've come pretty close.  For work, I've had to learn a whole new technology and pump out a complete web-application in the course of one week.  One measly little week.  That's not so bad - except for my very busy and mildly worried state of mind because I don't know what I'm doing - afterall, I enjoy the challenge.  I'll be the first to admit it, I'm a geek, but I've enjoyed working with Java and Tomcat and struts, it works really well.  The downside is that I've pulled 11 hour days for most of last week, and ended up working most of Saturday.   Now it's Sunday evening and where am I?  At work of course!  Trying to meet our nearly impossible deadline of tomorrow at 3:00pm.  My boss just left, its dark outside, its quiet in here, I have a mountain of stuff to do...  In other words, yeech!  On top of all that, I'm beat from staying up too late coding, I have a headache and I just got blood on my white shirt from a scab I picked (I know, I know, that was dumb).  I just wanna go home and sleep...but...back to my coding.

      Ok, this one is hilarious, I gotta share it...  I took the Pickup quiz and this is what I got.  What's up frigidaire. You are 26% pickup-able!   You're cold and unapproachable, like a big glacier that's unapproachable. And cold. Unlike the Arctic tundra, few even venture to plant their flag in you. You're definitely not a Scorpio, unless you were born between October 23 and November 21. The bad news is that you'll end up miserable and alone, probably knitting doilies out of cat hair. The good news is that this is apparently  what you want . Honestly, I don't even feel comfortable talking to you right now, so I'm just gonna go… yeah… wash my friend's hair.  Hee hee, that's great.  But now I need to get back to work.

      Not to be left out, I too went to Spark.com to take the personality test.  Turns out I am a Submissive Introvert Concrete Feeler (SICF).  Like just 10% of the population you are a HELPER WHO FINDS MISSING CHILDREN OVER THE INTERNET (SICF). You are very tentative in the world and introverted with people--which means you are the shy and silent type. Hence the Internet. But behind your reserved exterior lies a dedicated person with a passion for the concrete truth who wants to, in his heart of hearts, help find missing children. God bless you.  Ok, I'll buy that, but the whole, finding missing children over the internet thing...not so sure about that one.

      Yesterday was long and very tiring.  I pulled a twelve hour day at work, which usually isn't too bad but it's awful when everything is taking longer than you thought and you just want to go home.  So today I was gone from work as soon as the clock struck five.  My roomie and I decided to go float around in the pool for an hour or so before heading over to Urban Mill for dinner.  So here I sit, enjoying an evening of nothing after a long, long day at work yesterday.  A very low-key evening.  I been playing around with the colours on this page and making the page more uniform.  What do you think?  Very bright.  But I like it.  For now at least.

      The other day as I was waiting in the checkout line at Bed, Bath & Beyond I noticed a display of dolls that had "Press Me" written on their hands.  The sign above the display said  urlLink Mr. Wonderful Talking Doll  so out of curiosity I picked one up and pressed his hand.  The first thing the doll said was "Here, you take the remote, as long as I'm with you, I don't care what we watch."  I thought, hey this is great!  So I called my roommate over and told her to press his hand.  He said something like: "The ball game isn't really that important, I'd rather spend time with you."  You can also get Mr. Wonderful on a  urlLink keychain , just squeeze his tummy and he says what you want to hear.  So to all you girls out there searching for Mr. Right, look no further...guys, you taking notes?  At any rate, Mr. Wonderful would make a great gag gift.

Quite catchy atually.  Last night was the GEMS counselor training and we learned the theme song for this year, actions and everything.  I'm afraid I'll have it running through my head all day now.

      This morning I did not want to get out of bed.  Not because it was Monday, and not because I had to go to work.  Rather, it was because my bed was far too cozy.  On Saturday I bought a new down comforter for my bed.  It is so nice and warm and cozy.  So this morning, despite the garbage truck waking me up as it does every Monday morning, I was so warm and cozy that I really, really did not want to get out of bed.  All I felt like doing was snuggling a little deeper into my fluffy comforter and going back to sleep.  Why is it that beds are most comfortable when you have to get up?

      Today I went to Bargain Books and got a dictionary-type book about herbs and spices.  It is full of history, random facts, interesting tidbits, and uses for most of the common herbs and spices.  For example, nutmeg taken in large quantities is poisonous...makes me wonder just how much nutmeg you'd have to consume before it becomes poisonous.  Also, nutmeg increases the potency of alcoholic drinks...interesting...

      I have been listening to both the Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers soundtracks, and trying to decide which is my favorite song or songs.  But ya know, it's pretty hard.  I like the Hobbit theme, its so familiar, simple, and cheerful.  I also like the theme of Rohan, in particular the parts with the fiddle.  But I also like the metallic, percussion-type music that plays when the orcs are around.  The Hornburg is also a beautiful song, as is Forth Eorlings.  I think that I have come to the conclusion that I like all of the music.  Picking a favorite would be like...like...picking a favorite child (if I had any) or picking a favorite book.

      Sometimes I wish I could divide myself in two or make a copy of myself so that I could get twice as much work done.  For instance, one copy of myself could work on the billing software that the customer needs ASAP.  The other could fix bugs that keep popping up in the clinics that are using the software.  That way, I could keep everyone equally happy.  I guess the question is how much time should I spent on each part of the project to keep everyone happy?  In the end I wind up juggling between maintaining the old and creating the new.  Two of me could accomplish so much more...  However, as I contemplate the benefits of being able to accomplish more, I am reminded of  urlLink Calvin's transmogrifier .  Maybe I'd better just stick to my juggling.

      Well, today is the day.  Today is the day that I celebrate the day of my birth.  Another b-day, another year older.  I find it hard to believe that I'm 23 already.  I mean, I feel like I'm still in my late teens.  I can totally understand how people feel as they get old and they're bodies start breaking down, yet they feel 20-something or 30-something inside.  Must be incredibly frustrating.  On another note, I feel like myself again today.  Yesterday my roomie "straightened" my hair.  I have reasonably curly hair and I say "straightened" because my hair really didn't turn out straight.  More frizzy than straight.  Though I am not surprised, I am a little disappointed.  It would be nice to have truly straight hair for a day.  But my so called straight hair did not feel or look right to me.   It felt coarse and dry and frizzy.  Not to mention the fact that my hair was probably rebelling against me for torturing it so.  So this morning when I was getting ready for work I was really nice to my hair and let it curl the way it wanted to.  Now my hair is happier, and so am I.

      One more day till the weekend, *sigh*  Oh well, tomorrow's Friday, yey!  For those of you who haven't discovered it yet, DC and I started a  urlLink Coffee Break  site, which we can all use to exercise our creative skills.  If you want to join let us know and we can make you a member.  Then you can add to our ongoing story.  Or, just visit on occasion and read our story in progress.  You'll have to read from the bottom up though, there is no way to reverse the ordering of the posts.  Sorry, we tried.  Also, no GEMs update this week, we didn't have a meeting last night.

      Last night, or rather this morning, I had a very strange dream.  Not strange in and of itself, strange in the realness of it.  At the beginning I was out shopping somewhere.  I returned to the parking lot and got into a vehicle, I believe it was a minivan.  At this time I was all by myself.  Then my dream sort of morphed into a roadtrip with girls from my dorm my freshman year.  I'm not sure where we were going, but as we were driving, the vehicle changed into a full size van.  A little bit later, a bunch of kids appeared and my parents too.  Then my three kids showed up.  Yes, that's right, my three kids.  I don't know where that came from.  In my dream I don't recall there being a father for them around anywhere.  It was just me and the kids.  I had a three year old girl and one year old twins, a boy and a girl.  The twins were quite remarkable, they were walking and talking in full sentences.  Kind of eerie now that I think about it.   I remember we all had to sit around a table, I think for dinner but first I had to change the little boy's diaper.    Ever have dreams that felt so real it was almost scary?  This was one of those dreams.  Not sure where my subconscious was going with this one, but I'm not entirely sure I like it either.  I mean why three?  And where was their father?  My brain comes up with strange things sometimes (and I know that leaves me wide open, go ahead).

      I wish IIS would just play nice instead of hogging all the toys.  No wonder I couldn't get Apache to install with IIS, IIS grabs all the open ports when it starts up, leaving none for Apache.  So dumb.  So greedy.  Of course this fact is very well hidden and must be turned off in a very convoluted way.  Ah well, at least they both run together now...finally.

      On the way to work this morning I was listening to my  urlLink Great Big Sea  CD.  Some great tunes, which I know DC doesn't like :)  But I thought that Ordinary Day was especially appropriate for a discussion yesterday about life and what to do in life, etc.  In particular the chorus.  I've got a smile on my face, I've got four walls around me  The sun in the sky, the water surrounds me  I'll win now but sometimes I'll lose  I've been battered, but I'll never bruise... it's not so bad   Chorus  And I say way-hey-hey, it's just an ordinary day  and it's all your state of mind  At the end of the day,  you've still got to say... it's all right.   See that girl on the street, what keeps her from dying  Let them say what they want, she won't stop trying  She might stumble, if they push her 'round  She might fall, but she'll never lie down...   Chorus  It's a beautiful day, but there's always some sorrow  It's a double edged knife, but there's always tomorrow  It's up to you now if you sink or swim,  Keep the faith and you're ship will come in.

      Monday morning again.  Weekends go by way too fast, especially good ones.  Friday my roomie and I had a dinner and games gathering.  We made Chinese dishes from my new cookbook.  That was fun, and the recipes all turned out pretty good.  We played Cranium and Trivial Pursuit, though I think we should have done it the other way around, I was way out of it for trivial pursuit.  Way too much to drink ;) so by the time we got to trivial pursuit I wasn't really with it anymore.  Now that is a strange feeling.  I don't think I've ever had that much to drink in one evening.  Saturday afternoon, after returing home from work (bleh) I called the salon, and set an appointment to get my hair cut.  I was pleasantly surprised that they still had a spot open.  Amanda cut my hair.  I really liked her.  I told her what I wanted and she knew exactly what I meant.  Nothing drastic, not losing much length, but more body and volume.  I got exactly what I wanted and I love it :)  That evening I went to Pete Brown's to listen to Fonnhmor, an Irish band.  I liked the music, reminds me of some of the east coast bands from back home.  I really enjoyed the male vocals, wish they did more.  Bars are interesting places.  When we first got there, there was this older guy (like 50s) sitting at the table next to us, Ken was his name.  He had a great 'pick-up' line.  He pulls out a card about the size of a wallet-sized picture.  Then he leans over and says that he wants to show us his pride and joy.  He shows us the card and it has a picture of a bottle of pride furniture polish and joy dishwashing soap.  Ken proceeds to give us his card (for jewerly and watch repairs) and invites us to go to another bar where he plans to sing (karoke) and buy us a drink, if we come.  The music was great, very fun.  Though I was hoping for more of the upbeat lively stuff.  Makes me want to go to the UK and visit some pubs.  Another interesting guy at the bar was 'Sound Guy'.  The sound booth was right next to us, on the shuffle board, and since it was so crowded, the waitress would hand someone at our table the beer and have us hand it to the sound guy.  We got to chatting with him a bit, and asked if he was 'Sound Guy'.  He said, "something like that".  And so he was dubbed Sound Guy.  Finally at the end of the night we asked if had another name that he would prefer to be called, besides Sound Guy, Marty he said.  Then, Vbijl was done saying his goodbyes to the band, so we started to leave.  As we were just about out the door, Marty comes after me and asks me for my name.  I tell him and he proceeds to tell me that he couldn't keep his eyes off me all night, that I was riveting and he just wanted to tell me that.  Now that was a surprise.  He didn't ask for my number, but as a pickup line that was definately top shelf.  I had noticed him looking at me from time to time, but never really thought twice about it.  That was so strange, caught me completely by surprise.  Good surprise though :)  Makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  Sunday was the usual, church then dinner at Ruby Tuesdays.  Vegged out in the afternoon, watched Down with Love.  A purposefully cheesy romantic comedy mimiced after the old 50s and 60s romantic comedies.  It was fun, but I wouldn't want to watch it again.  And definately a chick flic.    But now, it is Monday morning, so nose to the grindstone it is...

      As requested by inquiring minds...  This week I had every intention of having a lesson with my girls.  In the morning while waiting for the guys at the Nissan dealer to change my oil, I read through the lesson and mapped out my plan of action.  The lesson was about the importance of language, and using positive language (along the theme of building others up).  However as I was driving home after work to pick up my stuff, I got a call from one of the other counselors.  She was going to have her girls do stamping.  They were going to make Christmas cards and use them for the stamping badge.  She asked if my girls would like to join them.  I agreed, so there went my lesson for the evening :)  Stamping was interesting.  Each girl responded very differently.  One of the girls had the slap it on and be done attitude.  She did three cards in the first 15 minutes and was bored for the rest of the evening.  Another girl had a sample that she wanted to mimic, and even though we didn't have all the necessary supplies, she persisted until she had a card that roughly matched the sample.    We also had fun with glitter.  Little girls love glitter.  A couple of the girls had minor (and quite amusing) accidents with the glitter.  One girl spilled glitter all over her black pants...she was covered.  She had to come over and show me her new glittery pants, and then proceeded to dance around the room, leaving a cloud of glitter behind her.  When another girl did the same thing, she sort of froze and stared down at her pants.  Then she sort of cried out that she had gotten glitter on herself.  Such different responses.  It was a very active and tiring evening but the girls are a lot of fun.  But I was missing one of my girls, which is sad, cuz I think she would have really enjoyed the stamping.

      Grocery shopping is kind of fun.  Last night my roomie and I visited two asian stores and good old meijer.  I should go to the asian stores more often.  You can get all kinds of strange and wondrous things there.  Grocery shopping got me to thinking.  As I spend more and more time here, in a larger city, I wonder how it would be if I were to move back into the country.  At home I could never find some of the things that we bought last night without going all the way to Toronto.  I would also miss the bookstores and malls here.  For any decent shopping at home you have to drive at least 45 minutes.  On the flipside, when I'm here I miss the quiet of the country, knowing who lives down your street.  I miss being able to look up and see the stars, its way too bright at night here.  I miss the space and the trees and the animals, at times I feel that there are far too many people and cars and buildings around.  When I go home to visit I thoroughly enjoy myself.  But at the same time, I can't wait to get back.  I feel torn between the two.  I guess I just to find a place that has the best of both worlds.  Or perhaps I'm just experiencing the grass is always greener syndrome.

      This morning I got to work and checked my email like I always do.  I saw that I had an email from my mom, so I thought, yay, news from home!  Then I saw the subject line..."bad news."  In the five seconds or so that it takes to open the email, all kinds of situations are running through my head.  Maybe Opa is in the hospital...he can't have passed away, mom would have called...maybe its Grandpa or Grandma...I hope Ryan and Caitlin are ok...maybe something happened to dad at work...  When the email finally opened (felt like an eternity) I quickly scanned the contents and saw (to my relief) that no family members were sick or injured.  Rather Caitlin was informing me that Pam, our cat and the mother of the cute little kittens, had been hit by a car.  Poor Pam.  She was a nice kitty.  But I was so relieved that everyone is ok.  Moral of the story?  Don't label your email messages "bad news", its just too hard on the recipient's heart.

      I uploaded some  urlLink pictures  from my trip home to my other website for your viewing pleasure.  I have more animal pictures, but I only posted the better shots.  My favourite one is the picture of the baby tiger.  He was only 9 weeks old...just a kitten.  He was in a small cage under a tree, but he really wanted to come out and play.  He kept climbing up the side of his cage and roaring his little roar.  Too bad they grow to be big tigers, it would be fun to have a baby tiger :)

      Since we left right after GEMs last week for Ontario, I never did blog about it.  So that night, lets see, the 8th, was craft night.  So I had no need for any bribery cuz I didn't have a lesson to get them to pay attention to.  The girls were making mosaics with cement and glass stones.  Each girl had a pie plate of cement, into which she could put a design using the stones.  The catch is, that each girl wants the stones that another girl has.  Lots of trading, stealing, tricking, went on as each girl tried to get the stones she wanted.  Cries of "so-and-so's not sharing" arose from various corners of the room.  Kids.  Reminds me of when my mother would buy us Smarties.  She would count out the colours so that each kid had the same amount of each colour.  That way we couldn't fight about it.    Eventually each girl was satisfied with her allotment of stones and they set to work on their designs.  After the craft, the girls had a rowdy game of tag in the basement.  When someone suggested Telephone, I jumped at the chance to get the girls settled down, and organized them to play Telephone.  Which they did, quite happily until it was time to go home.

      Last night I decided to go out and take a walk.  Haven't done that in awhile, since I got my car I haven't needed to walk as much.  But it was a beautiful evening and I decided that I should take advantage of the nice weather.  Afterall, soon it will be snowing again.  So I grabbed my keys, put on my running shoes and a sweatshirt and headed down the road.  Down Knapp St, and up Ball St.  Did you know that there is an elementary school and a small park on Ball St?  I didn't.  On the way I saw a girl walking her dog, an elderly couple walking and a person trying to calm down a screaming baby (on her porch).  It's nice to just walk around and be alone with your thoughts.  Just me and my thoughts, strolling down the street.  I have decided to do that more often.  I like to explore the neighborhood on foot, you see so much more that way.  You see the smaller things that you wouldn't notice in a car.

      I'm back to the land of the bloggers.  A little tired from too much driving, but otherwise feeling good.  Toronto traffic is always awful, not to mention that it was a long weekend.  Bleech.  Driving in downtown Toronto is interesting, a little scary and not something that I want to repeat soon.  I greatly prefer the quiet country roads around my parents' place.    Having to go to work today is kind of a bummer.  I want to go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the beautiful fall colours.  I think fall is my favorite season...it's a toss-up though, I like spring too, with all the new leaves and flowers coming out.  But you really can't beat the reds, oranges and yellows of the leaves in the fall.  Makes me want to take up painting, or maybe photography.  More about my weekend to come, but for now...back to work...

      Only one more day...woo hoo!  Tomorrow at this time I will be done with work for four whole days.  And after another rowdy evening with the GEMS girls, my roomie and I will hit the open road and head east.  I can't wait.  I love road trips.  I know, a seven hour trip hardly classifies as a road trip, but that's what I'll call it anyways.  I hope the weather is nice.  But now I must go home and eat something and pack some clothes, etc, etc.  Till tomorrow...

      :D  Smile everyone, it's Monday!  The sun is shining, the birds are singing, it's a beautiful day!  Can you see my huge grin yet?  Dunno why I'm so happy...slept well I guess, and the pressure is off (sort of) at work.  Oh, and I have a short week this week, that could have some bearing on my mood.  I'm taking Thursday and Friday off this week so my roomie and I can drive to Ontario to visit my folks, and take care of some business in TO.  So, three days and I'm off on a four day weekend, woo hoo!  So I'm happy, all is right with the world.  Yesterday was fun.  Went to church in the morning, and was actually on time for a change.  Went to lunch at the Olive Garden with DC and Guam.  Took a nap (gotta love Sunday afternoon naps).  Saw Luther with Guam and Vbijl.  Good movie, I enjoyed it.  The theatre was surprisingly packed...a couple of church groups I think.  After the movie went with Vbijl to  Kathy (sp?)  Cathy and Pat's for dinner, then went to Billy's to hear the  urlLink Red Elvises .  I don't normally go out on Sunday nights, but this group was well worth it.  Not sure how I would describe their music style, but it's fun.  When you first see the group come out on stage, you know its gonna be a blast.  One guy was wearing a gold suit, another a red sparkley suit with 3" platforms and a top hat, another a animal print suit that looked sorta like pjs.  The instruments were great too, I loved the accordian, and one guy was playing a guitar that was a huge triangle.  Their songs were all sorta wacky and joking around, and you could tell that they were enjoying themselves too.  The music was right up my alley :)  The only downside is that you come home smelling like stale smoke, but *shrugs* what can you do...you can't win em all.

      Just got back from another interesting evening of GEMs.  Tonight we had a regular lesson from the Shine magazine.  The lesson this week included a story about Josie and Meagan.  Josie wrote a really nasty note to Meagan and left it on her locker.  The theme this year is about building others up, so tonight we talked about how the things we say can hurt and shatter a person's insides.  The girls had lots of fun thinking of mean things that people can say.  They were much less quick to come up with nice things to say.    They were just as rowdy as last week, though I have a better idea how to handle them now.  They were really quiet while we were reading the story and they all wanted to be involved.  They also liked the stickers that I brought so we can keep attendance.  Each week that they come, they get to put up a sticker by their name.    Didn't try candy this week cuz they already had plenty of candy.  Maybe next week.  I think I will try playing a quiet game.  The girls have to be quiet when I say and if anyone talks, they get points.  The person with the least points wins.  I will bring my box of prizes for the occasion, pencils, erasers, notepads and the like.  Just the sort of thing that little girls love.  I think that will work, though I think I know who will win :)  There is one girl in the group who reminds me of myself when I was that age.  Very quiet, but happy to just sit back and watch.    They really wanted to play telephone too.  I wonder how old that game is...I can remember loving that game as a kid.  That will be a good bribe too.  If everyone is quiet and we can get through our lesson fast, we can play telephone.    They are rowdy, but one thing is certain, there is never a dull moment with this group :)

      Good morning everyone.  One more day of work and then its Thanksgiving weekend, yey :)  This year my roomie and I are being ambitious and cooking dinner for friends.  Last night I tackled the pies.  I've never made a pie before so I wasn't exactly sure what to do.  But I followed the directions in the cookbook for apple pie and it seemed to work out ok.  I was surprised at how little actually goes into a pie crust, only flour, salt, shortening and water.  That's it. So I mixed and rolled my crust according to the recipes suggestions.  Now I just hope for the best.  I'm hoping my crust will be flaky and not hard or dry, or soggy.  We'll see when I bake it I guess :)    The pumpkin pie was easy.  I bought the crust and all you have to do is mix everything together, dump it in and bake it.  Couldn't be much easier than that.  Baking is fun, tonight I'll mix up the dough for the rolls and set it to rising.

      Yesterday was Wednesday so I had GEMs.  Brought the girls' mirrors back (I brought them home to dry and to put hangers on the back), we had praise and worship to start, then we had a craft.  Denise had a craft planned for us.  We made thank you gifts for the teachers and leaders in the church.  The girls got to make two, one for someone in the church and one to take home to give to someone.  A lot of the girls had a hard time with this.  Some wanted to take both home, others wanted to give them to each other...  It was kind of tough telling the girls that they couldn't, but I think it's an important lesson that they need to learn.  It's also hard to get them to think of people outside of their immediate family.  So an interesting night.    Afterwards we had a counsellor meeting at one woman's house.  That was a little strange.  All the other counsellors are married with kids.  I felt really young and free.  They were talking about how difficult it is to get out... how more than twice in one week is plenty...  And I'm thinking, only twice?  Its kinda nice being able to go out whenever you want.  I think I'll enjoy others peoples kids for awhile :)

      *looks around groggily*  Bleh, I hate headaches.  Especially when they wake me up.  This morning I was awake at 5:30 because of my stupid head.  So I stumbled around in the dark, found some water and drugs, swallowed and fell back into bed.  But on the flip side, I slept much better from 5:30 to 8:30...a little too much better.  I had a dream that DC and I went to my place again.  We were at church and there was this rock band playing on the balcony.  All my friends were there too, and some were in the band.  I remember them being good, but can't remember what they sounded like.  Strange dreams.

      Monday...*sigh*  I had a good weekend though.  Friday night Cathy and I went to Pete Brown's Office (we're becoming regulars there :) to see one of Cathy's friends play.  That was a lot of fun, I met all kinds of cool people.  But I didn't get home till after two, which was kinda bad cuz Saturday DC, Michelle, Stacy and I went shopping.  We hit three different malls and were out for 12+ hours.  Man were my feet tired :)  But I got some new clothes which I really needed, so that's good.  Sunday morning I slept in...oops :)  Cleaned up a bit in the afternoon then went to the Vesper service.  Went out to dinner afterwards with my roomie then came home to watch CI, of course.  Worked on my cats x-stitch which is going to take me forever...but it'll be worth it, I really like the pattern.  Anywho, back to work now...

      It's snowing!  Well, not anymore, but it was when I drove in to work this morning.  I can't wait for the snow to come :)  It makes everything look so pretty.  Much better than dreary brown.  Last night at GEMs was fun.  I started off with the girls in two lines, facing each other.  One side were mirrors and they had to mimic everything the other side was doing.  Then we switched it around.  The lesson was about being created in God's image and how we reflect God like mirrors.  After our little game, I passed around the magazines with our lesson in it.  The girls were not sitting in their chairs, so I said that whoever is sitting by the time I count to 10 gets a candy.  That worked very well :)  I'll have to remember that one.  Our lesson continued the story about Josie that we've been reading all year.  After some questions we got to the fun part.  I bought some foam and mirrors and foam cutouts.  I made frames for the mirrors out of black foam and had the girls decorate the frames with foam shapes.  Heart, circles, squares, triangles, butterflies, dragonflies, ...  The girls loved doing that, and it kept them quiet.  We finished up our evening singing with the rest of the GEMs girls.

      *breaths a big sigh of relief*  Its the weekend!  Yey!  That makes me so happy :)  Talk about a roller coaster day.  I worked on a total of four projects today.  Not each one at a time, but on a rotating schedule.  I worked on each one for about 10 minutes to half an hour, then switch!  We've been getting things in three of our projects all synched up and my bosses were testing so we could push up a release tonight.  So, boss 1 discovers an issue in project A, update, push up.  Boss 2 discovers an error in project B, fix, push up.  Boss 2 has a question about project C, take a moment to answer.  Have a meeting for project D, drive over to client, come back, boss 1 is waiting with another issue, boss 2 has a couple more questions.  Boss 1 finds some strange data in our database... And so on and so on, all day long.    *phew*  This nutty (though strangely satisfying) day is over and I can go home and not think about work till Monday.  Life is good.

      Last night was fun.  I was missing two of my girls, but I think that last night was the rowdiest.  One girl in particular...she was actually vibrating she had so much energy.  She couldn't sit still for more than 2 minutes at a time.  Tiring just to watch her.    But despite that, the girls had fun.  We started out with a charades type game to illustrate the power of words.  They really liked that.  After the game I pulled out my candy jar.  You should have seen their eyes :)  When I said that they had to sit down before getting any candy, they quickly found their seats.  Candy works well on these girls.  As they were munching away, we managed to get through two lessons, which surprised me, cuz they were so loud.  But they did come up with good answers so they were listening too.  I think the girls are warming up to me now, they were sharing all kinds of stories with me about their friends and school.  I'm getting to know them better too.    I'm looking forward to next week, cuz I have a craft planned that ties into the lesson quite nicely.  I used to love doing crafts when I was a Calvinette, and I know the girls will love it too.  Next week's lesson also suggests a great game that the girls will love.  Planning lessons for my girls is a lot of fun cuz at this age they are so receptive.

      I'm back in Grand Rapids.  I had an awesome Christmas break with family and friends.  BC was beautiful, I loved the different climates.  The lower mainland was very mild, but then you drive a little and you hit winter and a foot of snow.  It was great.  So I got a green and a white Christmas...the best of both worlds.  I have tons of pictures to share, 200+ not to mention the pictures that my mom is going to send me.  We both had our digital cameras along and were having fun playing around with them.  So stay tuned for pictures, I'll post a handful.  If you want the full treatment, I have them on my laptop :)  Got to see a bunch of my aunts, uncles, and cousins, some of my friends, and had some good times with my immediate family.  But now I'm back and need to get back into day to day life again, bleh.  Hope everyone had a great Christmas :)

      This morning when I woke up I looked out the window and saw that the world had been blanketed in snow while we were sleeping.  So beautiful.  The cars looked all snug and warm in their blankets.  And you can't beat the drive to work, the trees looked so pretty.  It's beginning to feel like Christmas, three more days till I head for home!

      It is far too quiet here this afternoon.  Everyone else has gone home for the day and I'm left here all on my own....Yikes, I don't like being here on my own...this creepy looking guy was just at the window so I locked the door.  He's gone now, and I hope he doesn't come back.  We're in the basement, so it's easy to see in our windows.  Anyhow, that's not what I going to write about...hmm...I was thinking about the snow that is currently falling outside and I was thinking about Christmas, which will be here before we know it.  Ah yes, last night was our last GEMs night until after Christmas.  We took the girls to Metropolitan hospital to go caroling.  We asked the girls to bring some of their beanie babies and stuffed animals with them to give to patients, so as we caroled up and down the halls, the girls took turns giving the toys to people.  It was a lot of fun, and I think the girls enjoyed it.  I was amazed at how well-behaved they can be.  But once we got back to the church they were back to racing around again.  We had hot chocolate and I gave my girls cards and candycane reindeer.  For those of you who aren't familiar with them, a candycane reindeer is a candycane with a brown pipecleaner for antlers and googly-eyes and a red nose.  I also got to meet one of my girls' mothers, which is always nice.  Going back in time, Tuesday I did most of my Christmas shopping.  Guam I think I did what you would classify as power shopping.  Just some loose ends to tie up and my shopping will be done.  Further back, Sunday I decided to make the house more Christmas-y so I put up some lights and decorated my little pine tree.  A rather small Christmas tree, but I think its kinda cute.  Saturday I went to a Christmas party with Pat (for his work).  And that brings us back to Friday which was Sinterklaas.  Thinking about Sinterklaas makes me hope that the Koogers have some fun Sinterklaas-like celebration in mind for when we're in Vancouver...that would be fun :)  I can't wait till December 20th...only eight more days!

      I hope everyone had a great thanksgiving weekend.  I for one really needed that four day break.  Too bad it couldn't have been a little longer :)  Good company, good food, fun times.  But DC is right, the house will seem very quiet.  I like having lots of people around.  And I like playing the part of the hostess, feeding people, arranging beds, etc, etc.  It felt as though no one had left, like we all lived in Grand Rapids again.  Its sad that everyone lives so far apart...  By the way, the reviews are in, and Thanksgiving dinner was a success.  Though we were a little behind schedule...but good things come to those who wait, right?

      Yey for snow!  We're driving in a winter wonderland once again.  Had an interesting drive home last night after work.  Its kind of an adventure.  You approach the corner that you need to turn at.  Then you think to yourself, ok, what will this corner be like, how much slush will there be, will I slide around or will this be a clean turn.  A couple of times I thought to myself, uh oh, I hope I can stop...snow bank here I come :)  But I didn't have to resort to landing in any snow banks, which was good.  I don't need that kind of excitment.  The only downside of winter driving is having to watch out for other drivers, aside from them, driving in the snow and slush is actually pretty fun.

      Last night I went through a drivethrough.  Aren't you proud of me DC?  Went to McDonalds, to get some fries.  Normally I give drivethroughs a wide bearth.  For some reason I've never liked them.  You drive up, roll down your window, give your order to a box with a funny sounding voice.  Then you drive to the next window and hand over some money.   Next window, an arm hands over your food and you drive off.  Then you're left with the interesting task of eating while trying to drive, but that is another matter entirely.    I think what I don't like is the impersonal nature of drivethroughs, I would much rather park, get out, go inside, order from a real person that is standing there in front of me, and then get my food from that same person.  Service with a smile.  But last night it was late (why does everything have to close so early?) and I wanted some fries, so out of necessity I had to go through the drivethrough.  And you know, it wasn't so bad.  I still prefer to go inside, but I think I may be warming up to drivethroughs.

      Wow, January 18, where has the time gone.  Still haven't posted pictures either.  Actually haven't even had a chance to sort through them, I should do that soon.  So here I sit, Sunday afternoon at UM, sipping my mocha and catching up on my blog reading.    Went to a Griffins game last night.  That was interesting, certainly different than watching on TV.  I can understand why people like to go and see the games in person, its a different experience.  Personally I found the crowd as entertaining as the game.  Oh, and we won, 2-1 in overtime.  Yesterday afternoon I went with a couple of friends to the Mud Room.  I painted a platter and small bowl (for dip or something).  That was fun, we hadn't been there in awhile.  Now I want to go again :)

      GEMS last night was surprisingly quiet and relaxing.  I only had three of my girls there (due to weather I imagine) so we had a nice quiet lesson.  It was kind of nice to be able to talk to the girls on a more one-to-one level.  We sat in a circle and talked about our holidays.  I had an activity involving Bible verses and the names of God which they enjoyed.  I wrote out Bible verses on pieces of paper and put them in a hat.  The girls took turns picking one out, reading it, then matching it up to one of God's names on a poster board.  Then one of the girls suggested we read our favourite Bible verses, which I thought was a great idea.  One wanted to read Psalm 119...but then decided it was too long :)  Overall a good evening.

      Well that was exciting.  I'm sitting here minding my own business and my boss comes by to microwave something (the microwave is a few feet away from my desk).  Then her snack starts to spark and suddenly bursts into flame.  I go over there to look and her napkin is half burnt.  We both start laughing, it was so funny :)  Now the office smells like a campfire...mmm...just need some marshmellows.

      Had a strange dream last night/this morning.  It started out reasonably ordinary.  I was at the top of a big snow-covered hill with a group of kids/friends.  The hill was very steep on one side and on the other it dropped off into jagged rocks.  We were sledding down the steep side.  I almost had a mishap and went down the wrong side...that wouldn't have been pretty.    Then my dream changed, these spirits came and started chasing us.  They were dressed in black cloaks with white masks, and they came swooping down out of the sky towards us.  They started out as one spirit, but split into several.  Then I was all alone in a fenced-in area trying to get away from one of the spirits.  I was trying to fly away over the fence, but my body just wouldn't obey me (in past dreams I usually can fly away from danger).    After I was totally freaked out, the spirit changed into a more human creature and we were in some tall building.  I think he was supposed to capture me and turn me in, because as we were walking down the hall he heard voices.  He pulled me into the elevator on the first floor and pinned me back against the wall so no one would see me.  Then we got to talking about how people didn't understand us and were afraid of us.  I told him how on earth we finally realized we could move to the moon and that better for everyone.  Turns out he was some sort of alien and we were on a planet somewhere.  I'm not sure if I was human or alien, but the whole encounter with the alien was turning into a romantic encounter by the time I woke up.    Sledding, scary spirits chasing me, romance with aliens in elevators...strange indeed.

      I had a great weekend.  Abi came up on Friday so we talked about trip stuff stuff.  It was great seeing you Abi!  Then on Saturday I left bright and early and headed east.  The weather was great so driving was fun.  There's nothing like putting a great CD in and hitting the open road.  Arrived home around 2:30 to find my dad shovelling the driveway.  He was a little surprised to see me so early cuz I had said that I wasn't going to leave too early.  Chatted with my mom for a bit then went shopping for birthday presents for my aunt and grandma, and picked up my sister from work.  We were looking for plants, but it being valentines day, the shelves were pretty much empty.  We did find some that were good at the one florist shop, but the pickins were pretty slim.  My dad picked up my brother from a church function later that evening and then the whole family sat down to dinner together.  That doesn't happen much anymore so it was kinda nice.  Sunday morning I went to my home church (parents church), saw my Opa and a few friends, then headed over to my aunt's house.  She had it all decorated and setup, so there wasn't much to do but wait for my grandma to get there.  When Grandma walked in the door she was speechless.  Connie had asked her to come over for cake in the afternoon cuz she had a bunch of stuff to do in the evening.  But grandma was not expecting the whole family to be there.  Then she noticed that I was there too, and she said "What are you doing here?"  Then she had to come and give me a hug.  She was so surprised, it was great.  We had dinner and cake, then another of my aunts pulled out a cake for my aunt Connie (her 30th birthday was in January).  She was so surprised.  She didn't know that it was really a double surprise party that she was hosting :)    Monday morning I took my brother back to school then headed back to GR.  So yeah, it was a fun weekend, especially getting to see my mom's side of the family again (it had been a while).

      o/~ Lady luck apologizes, for the way she's been behaving, and she promises she'll change... o/~  I finally brought my CDs into work, and I've been listening to The Proclaimers all morning.  Good stuff.  I can listen to these guys for hours and hours on end.    Got a new puzzle this weekend to replace the light house one.  This puzzle will be a challenge.  Its one of those maze puzzles, first you have to construct the rooms, then you have to put the rooms together so you don't get eaten by any wild animals.  Was up too late working on it last night... :)  o/~ And I would walk 500 miles, and I would walk 500 more, just to be the man who walks a thousand miles to fall down at your door... o/~  Thinking of a thousand miles, I'm taking Monday off, and going home to see my family.  My grandma (on my mom's side) turns 75 next week, so we're having a gathering of family and friends.  Its been a while since I've seen my mom's side of the family so I'm really looking forward to this weekend.  But now I should get back to my coding...one more great song...  /~ I'm on my way from misery to happiness today, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, I'm on my way from misery to happiness today.... o/~

      Joke of the day:  1: Why to elephants paint their toenails red?  2: So they can hide in cherry trees.   1: Have you ever seen an elephant hiding in a cherry tree?  2: No.  1: See, it works!  Last night at GEMS the lesson was about jokes that seem funny, but are really hurtful because they cut other people down.  I began the lesson with a little joke telling, and Laffy Taffy.  I had the girls tell their favorite jokes, and read the jokes that are on the wrappers of the Laffy Taffy.  One of my girls told the above joke.    Another good one was: Q: Why was the boy covered in giftwrap?  A: Because his mother told him to live in the present.   Alternate answer offered by one of my girls:  A: Because his mother told him to get his life wrapped up.   There were many more extremely corny jokes that I will spare you from, but it was a lot of fun.

      As I was listening to Proclaimers on my way to work today, I thought to myself, I should really try to find "havering" on google today.  I've always wondered what it meant, but have never been able to figure it out.  According to  urlLink Wordsmith.org  havering means to talk nonesense - good to know - makes sense in the context of the song too.

      Last night we had a mother-daughter tea for GEMS.  It truly was a tea too.  We asked everyone to dress up and bring their favorite tea cup.  We had everything from formal gowns, to confirmation dresses, bridesmaid dresses, wedding gowns, etc.  Some girls had hats, others had white gloves, it was great fun.  We served tea and punch and coffee, and fruit and goodies.  While the girls and their moms were munching, we went around the room so everyone could share the story behind their dress and their tea cup.    The tables looked great.  One of the ladies in the church has a doll collection that she brought in, along with some quilts and quilt blocks for table decorations.  Everything was very springy, pinks, purples, greens, yellows and blues.  I'm glad the weather was so warm yesterday, it really felt like spring.  Seeing all the tea cups makes me want to collect tea cups and have my own tea party (not that many people drink tea anymore).  Ah well, our tea party was fun and I think everyone enjoyed it.

      Had a strange dream last night, or rather this morning.  I was an instructor in some class at some school.  I was checking my email and saw that I had over 2000 messages.  But I couldn't log into my account to delete them even though I knew they were all viruses.  I managed to delete a couple of them somehow, but then I got even more bad emails.  Man, I think I need more sleep...even my dreams are turning geeky...

      Today at work I got an error message while testing our software:  Incorrect visit Id format found.  Error Code: 2002    I don't think I've been so happy to get an error message.  The clinics have had this phantom error that pops up several times a day, but I can never reproduce it.  And end users are oh so helpful..."it won't save" is all I get.  But today, after a conversation with my boss I got a brainwave about how to try to reproduce the problem.  And what do you know...it worked!  Now I can actually fix this problem and get it off my list.

      Following recent trends on other blogs...but I decided to be different and post song lyrics.  This is the signature song on Great Big Sea's latest CD.  A slower song, unlike the louder more upbeat songs that they have.  Something Beautiful  Hey You, you lost your only friend You can't believe you're broken heart will ever mend But every mountain has its faces that'd make you want to stop On this so unwelcome journey from the bottom to the top.  Move along I believe there's Something Beautiful to see Move along I believe there's Something Beautiful Just waiting for you and me  I know you'll never count the tears you've cried Though you've asked a million questions No one could tell you why A single soul is chosen to be the one put to the test But there will be some consolation for a heart that never rests  The years will make us older The winters make us colder And there's one more thing I've come to know for sure There's no bitterness that smolders, no chip on any shoulder That a random act of kindness couldn't cure  Hey You, you lost your only friend You can't believe you're broken heart will ever mend But every mountain has its faces that'd make you want to stop On this so neverending journey from the bottom to the top.

      Recently my roomie and I have started going to yoga classes.  I've never really been interested in it because I always thought it was kind of hoaky.  But I've found that the various poses are good for strength and exercising muscles that I don't use very often.  We've been twice now and my muscles are speaking to me :)  I'm not sure I like what they're saying, but on the flip side it feels pretty good too.  I'm amazed at what some of the other women can do.  I find the crocodile pose particularly difficult, I can't quite manage it yet.  All in good time I guess.

      So sleepy...I feel like dozing off right here under my desk.  The letters are all sort of blurry.  My mind cannot focus.  I need more sleep.  Mmmmm, sleep...  I think I need some sugar.  Ok that's better.  Did everyone have a good weekend?  Do anything exciting?  Watched "13 Going on 30" on Friday, went shopping Saturday.  Saturday night went to a birthday party at which I drank too much.  Sunday slept in, no hangover just exhausted, did laundry, watched some TV and went to bed.  Too late obviously.  That was the extent of my weekend.  Now I need a nap, or another day of weekend.

      Email is an interesting form of communication.  When you write things in an email they come out differently than if you expressed them verbally.  Its harder to portray feelings and emotions in text.  You lose tone, pauses, inflection, etc.  On the other hand I find it easier to express things in writing than say in person, or over the phone.  Despite email's limitations of being very one-sided, it is a comfortable medium for expressing things.  I also like the fact that it gives you a chance to compose what you want to say, instead of having to 'think on your feet'.    I remember as a kid I used to be afraid of phones.  Whenever the phone rang, me and my brother and sister would all yell, 'not it!'  No one wanted to answer the phone.  One time I had to call a friend of mine about a birthday party, or something like that.  I took out the phone and set it on the table.  I stared at it for awhile, picked up the receiver, listened to the dial tone, took a deep breath, started dialing, hung up again.  Walked away, walked past the table, stared at the phone for a while longer.  Listened to the dial tone again, hung up.  And so on, and so on.  I think it must have took an hour to make that phone call.  And it wasn't even a call to a boy!  So with the invention of emailing I am much better able to communicate (and no I'm not scared of phones anymore, though I still prefer ftf interactions).

      Bought the latest Great Big Sea CD last night,  urlLink Something Beautiful .  My new favorite song is 'HelmetHead'.  I just love the lyrics, and it's very upbeat.   I was just seventeen, when I made the AHL I couldn't skate in junior, but my fists rang like a bell. I'll never win a title, and I'll never win the cup, But when it comes to ladies, I've had the best of luck.  My first one was a sly one, hanging round the rink, But they sent me off to Cornwall, as fast as you could blink, In Moose Jaw I was right in love, the daughter of the coach — He traded me for nothing, didn't take to my approach.  So good-bye, fare thee well, There's no time for delay, You'll see me at the face-off, or catch the play-by-play So good-bye, fare thee well, I'm glad you shared my bed, But never trust a fellow with a helmet on his head.  Chantal was from Moncton, elle a jouer avec moi. A tongue as sharp as razors, but she had a fancy car. Her husband was a bruiser, played senior in Quebec, If he'd had the rights of it, it would have been my neck.  Nancy couldn't watch me fight, she'd always be in tears, Waving from the bleachers, and screaming in my ears, Dee I should have married, and we had a dandy fling, But I had a one way contract, blew the money for the ring.  I should have sent a letter, and it would have been polite, But I'm cleaning out my locker, and time is getting tight. I'm calling from the station, perhaps another day, Cause they're calling up a rookie, and they're trading me away.

      Last night at GEMs I started the paper creations badge with my girls.  We started out answering some basic questions about origami, paper-mache and other paper crafts.  At first the girls weren't too interested in writing down the answers, but when I told them it was for a badge, they became more interested :)  After answering the questions, I pulled out some origami paper and showed the girls how to make a cat, a frog and a bat.  I picked some pretty basic designs, so it wasn't too hard to lead the girls through the different folds.  In fact, we finished with about 15 minutes to spare.  Since we had extra time, I pulled out my bandana so we could play 'whack-em'.  'Whack-em' is a game that we used to play with our youth group.  Everyone sits in a circle and picks an animal.  One person stands in the centre of the circle with a dish towel in hand.  Someone starts by saying, 'Cat likes Dog'.  Dog replies with 'Dog likes Horse' and so on.  The person in the middle has to tag the person called before he/she can say their piece.  I taught my girls this game last week and they really enjoyed it, so we played it again this week.

      I don't understand it.  You can go to almost any bank in Ontario (in my experience) and get US currency.  But I just got back from my bank, they don't have CDN currency.  And the woman at the counter said that she has called around to other banks for other people and no one seems to have it.  That makes no sense to me...Canada is only a 3 hour drive away!  Ah well, life goes on.

      This morning I was up at 5 am, long before the sun.  I got in my car and headed west in the drizzling rain.  I had to go to customs this morning to renew my work visa.  After a reasonably short wait at the border I headed to Grand Rapids, back to work.  When I got home I was exhausted and hungry, I'd had an egg McMuffin at 7, but nothing since then.  For some reason driving never makes me hungry.  So I made a sandwich then went to bed.  But once I got to bed I couldn't sleep.  So I got up again, put on a heavy sweater (its freezing out) and headed to UM.  Catch up on my surfing.    Now I'm drinking my coffee and surfing along.  Which reminds me, I made my dad happy this weekend.  At my aunt and uncle's house I had a cup of coffee.  He looked at me, then said, "you've started drinking coffee?!  It's about time!"  Hee hee, he's been trying to get me to drink coffee for years.

      I have wheels again!  My car was in the shop this past week for some much belated body work.  So for seven days I've been without wheels, bumming rides from my roomie, walking and taking the bus around town.  But this morning I picked up my car, he looks so shiny and new, and they even vacuumed the inside for me.  It's great to have wheels again :)

      Yesterday afternoon my roomie and I drove out to the Grand Haven beach.  It was a beautiful sunny day, nice beach weather.  The water was frigid so we just stayed on the sand soaking in the sun.  Spent my time reading reading and working on my tan (har har, like that will work).  My 'tan' is just my skin getting a bit more pink.  After it got cold, we walked along the pier past all the people fishing and walking their dogs.  Now I can actually say that I've been to Lake Michigan :)

      Watched Stepford Wives last night.  It was kind of interesting, completely cheesy, but a fun movie.  All the wives were like extreme Martha Stewart's, immaculate houses, always cooking and cleaning and waiting on their husbands and children hand and foot.  At one point Nicole Kidman's character bakes about 5,000 cupcakes because she is trying to get into the whole 'Stepford thing'.  Another great one is the book club.  The woman read a book about decorating for the holidays and the entire discussion is centered around how you can use pinecones in your decorations.  Completely ridiculous :)

      Back in Grand Rapids again.  Just spent two weeks roaming about France and Spain.  Spain was nice, but I absolutely loved France.  Now I'm torn, I thought Florence would be a nice place to live, but now I think that I would prefer Paris, or maybe someplace in the French countryside.  We didn't spend any time in the country, but what I saw from the train was absolutely gorgeous.  I just loved the little towns nestled into the rolling hills.  Plus it would be the perfect opportunity to work on my french, not to mention the cute french guys ;)  The ones in Spain aren't bad either, but its a lot more difficult to talk to them (not knowing Spanish).  But now its back to reality and the regular grind.  *sigh*  Vacations are never long enough.

      If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port And the bus is interrupted at a very last resort And the access of the memory makes your floppy disk abort Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report.  If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash And your data is corrupted cause the index doesn't hash Then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gonna crash!  If the label on the cable on the table at your house Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse But your packets want to tunnel unto another protocol That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall, And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang 'Cuz sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!  When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy in the disk And the macrocode instructions cause unnecessary risk Then you'll have to flash the memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM. Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your Mom!

      I watched Chocolat last night, great movie, and now I feel strangely inspired to open a choclaterie of my own.  Too bad I don't know anything about making chocolates.  Maybe I should learn, that and brush up my french.  Then I can pack up and move to a little town somewhere in the french countryside.  I just love the little town that the movie is set in.  Apparently, the town they used had a total population of 250, just the right size :)

      I've been listening to a new CD today, Maroon 5, Songs about Jane.  My roomie bought it and lent it to me, I really like it.  I think I need to make a "backup" of this one :)    Song of the day is "Through With You".   Can you see me  Floating above your head As you lay in bed  Thinking about everything That you did not do  Cause saying "I love you" Has nothing to do with meaning it  And I don't trust you  Cause every time you're here Your intentions are unclear  I spend every hour waiting for a phone call That I know will never come  I used to think that you were the one Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all   You ain't ever coming back to me  That's not how things were supposed to be You take my hand just give it back  No other lover has ever done that  Do you remember  The way we used to melt  Do you remember how it felt  When I touched you, oh  Cause I remember very well  And how long has it been  Since someone you let in  Has given what I gave to you  And at night when you sleep  Do you dream I would be there Just for a minute or two do you?  You ain't ever coming back to me  That's not how things were supposed to be You take my hand just give it back  o other lover has ever done that  Heartache heartache I just have so much  A simple love with a complex touch There is nothing you can say or do  I called to let you know I'm through with you.

      I spent an excellent 5 hours last night watching the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice.  I've been meaning to buy it for awhile now, and finally did.  I think I've seen the movie about six times, but still do not tire of watching the dynamics between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.  Good food, good friends, good movie, Mr. Darcy, what better way to spend an evening...

      Just finished reading  urlLink The Lady and the Unicorn  by Tracy Chevalier, another book about a piece of artwork (same author as Girl with a Pearl Earring).  My roomie had borrowed it from the library, so I was reading it on the way to and from Chicago.  This book is about a set of six medieval tapestries that are now housed in the Cluny musuem in Paris.  We got to see them when we visited the musuem at Cluny, so reading about them was very interesting.  I really like how Chevalier takes what we know about a piece of art and then weaves a story around it.  For anyone who liked Girl with a Pearl Earring, I would recommend this book.

      Had a great long weekend, in spite of the weather.  Friday I stayed home to clean up my room and the apartment.  I had to clear my room for my new furniture :)  I got a new bed, dresser, night stand delivered on Saturday morning.  So now after 4 years of sleeping on a mattress on the floor, I finally have a real bed!    Saturday, after the guys arranged my furniture I headed south to Mike and Sandi's for the day.  We went out in the boat, swam for awhile then had a fish fry and fireworks.  It rained for a bit, but otherwise the weather was great.    Sunday, bummed around at home.  Didn't feel like going out in the rain to watch more fireworks, so stayed home and watched Independance Day, and Cold Mountain.    Monday, went down to Chicago, ate an excellent lunch at  urlLink Big Bowl , walked around, shopped, had some good coffee at  urlLink Moonstruck , went to the Sears tower, zero visibility, stayed on the ground, wandered around Chinatown, came back to GR.

      Saturday my roomie and I got up before the crack of dawn (4:30 am), hopped into the car and headed north.  I love driving so early in the morning, you feel like you're the only one up.  About halfway there we got to watch the sunrise which was pretty, but kind of a pain cuz we were travelling east at the time.  Arrived in St. Ignace around 9 am, bought our tickets, and boarded the ferry.  When we reached the island, one of the first things we saw was a GFS truck backed up to a horse-drawn trailer.  Now that is a strange sight.    Since it was still early and relatively we decided to lose ourselves in the park.  We followed the trails as best as we could, but they were too windy and confusing.  So we simply followed whatever trails we happened upon and enjoyed the fresh air and sunshine.  Walking through the park was certainly a contrast to the downtown area of the island.  It was so quiet and peaceful.  With the exception of a few other walkers, the odd horse and rider, and an occasional bicyclist, it felt like we were all alone.  It was rather nice.   After covering a major chunk of the island on foot we stopped at a little picnic area to eat our lunch.  From there we walked back to the downtown and wandered in and out of the various shops.  And of course we stopped to watch them making fudge.  We bought a sample box, and broke into it while waiting for the next ferry to come and take us back to the mainland.  Back in St. Ignace we wandered through a bookstore, then stopped for a bite of dinner at a 50s style diner.  The strange thing was, the diner had no tourists, it was all locals, even though it was right across the street from all the ferries.    A great, though very tiring day.  I have pictures to share, but I need to download them still.

      I had a very strange dream last night/this morning.  I was in some sort of US government organization that was looking for a treasurer.  They were taking nominations, and there were some people who were interested in the position.  But there was a catch.  The job would be in England.  Most people weren't too happy about that, but I thought, hey, sounds great!  So I got my name on the list.  I remember it saying something about my not having any advanced mathematics, but that I would be a quick learner.  Unfortunately I woke up before I found out if I would be moving to England or not.

      Yesterday was a great beach day.  After church we grabbed a bite of lunch then headed off to the Grand Haven beach.  Unfortunately everyone else had also decided that it was a great beach day.  All you could see was a sea of bodies, and there was no parking to be found.  So, plan B.  We changed our minds and went to a local park, much fewer people, a less crowded beach, and best of all, available parking!  So we settled down on the sand with our towels, sunscreen and reading material to enjoy the afternoon sun.  Watched a mother bury her son in the sand, kids building sandcastles, couples walking hand in hand along the shore, and one family digging a big hole to bury their father in.  Upon returning home, we picked up some noodle soup after a bit of grocery shopping, and headed home to watch Minority Report.  What a life :)   urlLink    Samara and I at the beach.
