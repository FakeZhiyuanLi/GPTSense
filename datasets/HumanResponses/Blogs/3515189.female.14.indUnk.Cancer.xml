        Ren's Pants - Cool, you got Ren's pants! You're kind of aloof, and you like to make sure your pants show up the other guy's. That's why they're so damned dashing.      urlLink   Which Shaman King character's pants should YOU wear?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   I'm so happy I got LEN'S pants. ^_^    You are Yoh's spirit - AMIDAMARU the ghost samurai!    urlLink   What Shaman King spirit are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   I don't know how I feel about being Amidamaru but I think Dhea would be happy. ^_^"    If you took part in the Shaman Fight, you'd join YOH'S TEAM! Who else? They are funny, strong, cute, brave and cool! You know they are quite a chaotic team, but a strong friendship keeps them together and that's all you need to win. Oversoul!!!    urlLink   What is your Shaman Fight team? (Shaman King)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   Ha ha ha, I'm on the best Team!!!    Yoh: You're kind, laid-back and sweet. You're also very lazy, but you're a very strong shaman, your spirit is Amidamaru the samurai. Your fav. quote is Daijoubu Da yo, and your lazy-ness is plain kawaii!    urlLink   Which Shaman King Character are you? *FINISHED*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   You know i would have been happier if I was Len, but since I am lazy and since I really don't like milk that much then I guess it's OK. ^__^

      Ok, so we all know Len/Ren (whatever) loves milk, BUT here in this picture we see him drinking something other than MILK. ORANGE JUICE! x_x     Morty/Manta (again whatever) get out of the way! We are looking at Len not at you!

      Ok so I am a huge fan of Len but that doesn't mean i don't like other characters. As a matter of fact Yoh is my second favorite character, and third is Horo Horo. To show my appreciation for them here are some pictures of them. ^_^
