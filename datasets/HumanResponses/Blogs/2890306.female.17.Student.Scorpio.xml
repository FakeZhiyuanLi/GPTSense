      So, opening night came and went.  Personally, I thought it was the best show we have done so far.  For the first time, I actually became the character of the Prioress.  It may sound odd, but it's true.  I got absorbed my part, and it felt amazing.  Combine that with the energy of the audience, and wow!  Part of my luck last night was from the Lucky Penny that Jacob gave me before I went on stage.  Ahh, the power of positive thinking.  If this trend keeps up, I can't wait to see how we bring down the house tonight.  This weekend will keep me busy.  I have to work from 7:30 A.M. to 2 P.M. tomorrow, and I might attend the National Anthem auditions at school.  Though, I'm not feeling the greatest in the singing department lately, so I might skip that last activity.  Later on, I perform with the Robin Hood cast for the last time at 7:30 P.M.  It will be a great show, but sad at the same time.  Though it is always sad to end a project you have put so much of yourself into.  After the show, everyone helps with Strike (or, the taking down and clean up of EVERYTHING, for all you non-theatre goobers out thurr) and then...the cast party!  This year, Heather Burch assumed the role of Hitler and usurped the job of hosting the party at her house.  *groan*  Her parents are making everyone leave at 2 A.M.!  Now, that may seem rather late, but we will just be arriving at 1, as the set will take FOREVER to disassemble.  *sigh*  Well, the good news is, if I know my fellow thespians, we won't be discouraged so easily.  Or maybe, if I know myself, I'll just pass out on the couch after having such a long day.  Yeah...that's probably it.

      I arrived at school this morning at about 5 minutes to 8.  Mr. Pope had a nice array of donuts, juice, and milk out for us all.  I had already eaten breakfast, so I only had one donut hole and a small cup of milk.  No matter how full I am, it is impossible to pass up a donut.  That must be a law of nature or something.  Our matinees went well.  The kids enjoyed our performances, as judged by their larger-than-life reactions to just about everything!  Mr. Pope said that many of the little boys wanted to know where they could get a sword of their own.  How completely darling!    Tomorrow's agenda?  1.   Two more matinees  2.   Contest recital in the choir room  3.   Class at The Bead Co. downtown  Should be a good day.  In closing, the best of nights to you.  Hopefully, I'll cross your path tomorrow.

      Hi.  No real news today.  I was just feeling a little bit graphic design and a little bit defiant, so I made this.  *shrug*  Looks kinda cool, eh?  You be the judge.  Goodnight, my fine feathery friend.

      Today was perhaps the longest I've had in my 17 years on this earth.  Though it was only 24 hours, like the rest, it seemed like eternity.  Right now, it is 12:20 A.M. of the next day.  Also, it is at this time that I am just getting home, having left this morning at 8:00 A.M.  Yuck.  I really should be sleeping because, frankly, I have forgotten the meaning of the word.  Therefore, I shall make this short and save both of us some trouble.  The parents performance of Robin Hood went well...as well as a first show can go, anyway.  Parents tend to be easier critics than most, though, because they are too excited at seeing their little darling to pay any attention to error.  All in all, it was enjoyed by everyone :)  After play, I went home for one precious hour to eat dinner with my parents.  Highly enjoyable.  I love my parents.  *grin*  Anyways... back to busy-ness.  Kacie hosted a little fondue bash at her place so I darted over there for a coupla hours.  That was the highlight of my day.  I got to spend some much needed quality cuddling time with Geoffrey and that lifted my spirits mucho x2 x2!  We all ended up watching Sweet Home Alabama, a fine selection, chosen by none other than Craig.  All the girls (Kacie, Ebby, and I) were happy about that one.  Good party, Kac.  *thumbs up*  Now, I shall totter to bed... goodnight my sweetie pies.

      Today is my dad's 50th birthday, so a very jolly and sincere b-day wish to him.  I was disappointed I had to miss it because, if you haven't yet noticed, I live at school.  Fortunately for me, my family decided to postpone going out to dinner until tomorrow night!  Ruby Tuesdays is our intended destination.  Yummy!  I've never been there before so my hopes are that it will be tasty and not too slow.  Woah, I could make a randy joke about that one.  Heh.  Nevermind.  Of course, I must speak of play.  Rehearsal was long as usual.  Nothing out of the ordinary (ie: crazy, life-threatening accidents, raccoons running rampant, etc...) occurred tonight, setting my mind at a little ease, considering my earlier hypothesis of the show being cursed.  That WOULD have been kind of cool though, you know, if it had been.  *grin*  Anyway, tomorrow we have practice at 9 A.M., and later a parents' performance at 2 P.M.  Before all of that, however, I am having breakfast with two of my best boys, Aaron and Geoffrey, who are having a sleepover as I type this.  It should be fun.  Any activity with those two is always exciting.  Hmm.  Yet again another randy joke opportunity.  What is wrong with me tonight?  Honestly.  I hate it when people change things at the last minute.  Today, the activities director lady, Betty, called me down from math class.  (I am the banner singer coordinator, for those who do not know.)  Anyhow, I totter down to her office, only to discover that the time has been changed for the game tomorrow.  I was to inform the banner singer that he "could sleep in an extra hour."  Oh great.  In a quintessential Katie fashion, I just smiled, said OK to this news, and stepped out of the office.  In actuality, I was very upset.  I knew Betty could have told me much sooner in advance.  A tournament this big would not have been changed the day before.  So yeah, the time of my kind volunteer (hi chase) was treated like crap, and then I was put in the position of compromise.  Grrrr!  I wish people would just take responsibility!  You read earlier that play practice starts at 9 tomorrow, and this new hour delay prevents Chase from being able to sing.  I was disappointed because I know he always does an excellent job and is one of the very few who is actually enthused about singing solo.  Gotta love that.  *smile*  Sorry about the mix-up, Chase.  I'm taking the hint that you're okay with it based on your emissions tonight at play.  Could that be a randy joke opportunity?  We'll just say no, and I'll log out for tonight.  Later, peeps.  P.S.  If you care to, tell me a good joke in my comments.  I need some new material.  Thanks.

      Another day, another dollar.  I have yet to see my dollar.  Well, to be honest, I think I spent it on some cold fries and an odd-tasting burger.  Allow me to start at the beginning.  It was a good day.  A little hectic because last night I fell asleep, and obviously, did not do my AP Chemistry assignment.  Therefore, I had to fit it in during other classes (namely, history with the Kuehn Man) over the course of the day.  If I got you curious, I did get it done on time, but alas, she never checked it.  Darn my luck.  Oddly enough, luck is exactly what everyone seemed to be lacking at play today.  Betsy passed out and Joe S. got beaned in the head with a sword, all in the same day.  Add that to yesterday's trauma of Jeff bopping his head on the door frame, and one might come to the conclusion that this show is cursed!  Another bit of supporting evidence is that today, while backstage, I was talking to Aaron and he said the one thing you are never supposed to say!  I shall give you a hint...It is a famous Shakespeare play that rhymes with "Lick Seth."  Yeah, that one.  Well, I hope that the huge crosses hanging from my neck (remember, I am an evil nun) give me some protection because, from what I have seen lately, I am going to need it.  But then again, maybe I'm just paranoid.  *shrug*  At about this point, you're probably wondering about my odd-tasting burger comment up there.  (Not that the comment tasted like an odd-burger, but...well...nevermind.)  Yes, that plus the cold fries are what I had for dinner at play.  Mystery solved.  Read on, friend.  Well, it is currently quite late, and just getting home from school, I am naturally quite hungry.  Mommy left me some shrimp lo mein from Szechwan (my absolute favorite!) in the fridge and I almost cried I was so happy.  *yay*  So, I'm sure you can guess what I'm eating.  Also, there was a nice fortune cookie sitting there, and I took that too.  Hey, it called to me.  Anyway, it reads:  "Alas!  You are the apple of my eye."  In bed?  Nah, that one doesn't work.  Boooooring.  I leave you with Smock comic #2, since yesterday's was such a hit.  W00t.  A trendsetter I am.  Anyway, here you go,  mis mapaches .

      Homework.  Exactly what I should be doing right now.  Ehhh.  I would much rather download music by Andrew Lloyd Weber and type ever so narcissistically about my day.  So, school was, as my friend would say, schoolish.  Today for lunch, we had chicken strips.  A question (one of many) that has always plagued my mind is, why does the human populous insist on naming meat products with parts that are not even a part of that particular meat.  Allow me to explain.  Do chickens have nuggets or strips?  I have never seen a buffalo with wings, have you?  And what sort of meat has balls, honestly?!  Wait.  Don't answer that one.  I should submit that the next odd animal product in line be fish knees.  Yes.  Now THAT would go over in the school lunch line.  There must be  some  odd collection of leftover meat lying around, just waiting to be made into "fish."  Just you wait.  Today, at play, things are progressing.  We are coming together as a cast more and more as the days pass, and that makes me happy.  I enjoy being there.  On a more sour note, at the beginning of play practice today, Jeff Robbins (who plays the bishop) hit his head on the frame of the very short doorway to the terrace of the play set, passed out, and started shaking!  I had just talked to the guy about 5 minutes earlier, so it was hard to believe.  Fortunately, he got back on his feet and went home after his mom was called.  I am just glad he's okay.  Now, chilluns, I leave you with a chucklable Calvin and Hobbes.  Oh, and if you'd like to leave me a little hello, click on my comment link just down there.  I always love a note or two...  See you tomorrow!

      Today was livable.  It seems that as this year progresses, more and more things pack into my already busy schedule.  For some, being busy is a necessity.  For me, it is nice once in a while, but I miss my alone time.  All signs seem to point to a need for me to slow down.  For example, every week in our assignment books, there is always a tidbit of encouraging, but slightly corny advice that I always read.  I took it as a sign that, this week, the random little bit of advice read,  Take some time off to just relax.  Enjoy being alive and do nothing in particular.  Renew your energy.   I gained some respect for the corny advice writers after that one.  They most definitely have a point.  This week is our last week of rehearsals before our parent's performance of Robin Hood on Saturday.  Everything seems to be coming together, however slowly.  More and more, I am enjoying acting as an evil nun.  *grin*  I mean, come on, who wouldn't have fun with that?  At first, I must admit, I wasn't exactly digging the garb I am required to don, but people adjust, as I did.  Now, the excitement I had for Little Shop is beginning to sink in for this show too.  I love the feeling of working with all my closest friends to create something that we can all be proud of.  Until next time, mis mapaches locos (my crazy raccoons).  I leave you with a vocabulary word.  (Yes, I am a dork.)  (Parenthetical notes are fun.)  ((Especially when you use two parenthesis.))  (((Or three...)))   jejune  (adj.) -- lacking in interest or substance; immature, juvenile

      I realized no one ever understands me when I'm in a pessimistic mood.  I, Katie Rose Fritz, am not allowed to have a bad day or everyone thinks I'm going crazy.  *shrug*  That might be true, but it's certainly not the point.  Either way, I've decided not to slip into it again, at least for a while.  Optimism is a gift that I have been bestowed with, and I like to embrace it as much as I can.  Share the love, right?  Tonight, I don't have much homework.  I just need to read a bit of  The Great Gatsby  and finish my vocabulary.  The latter, I don't really mind.  The former, I would rather skip.  You see, I hate forced reading.  I just can't bring myself to sit down and trudge through a jumble of words, for I know I'll just fall asleep.  *sigh*  Ah well, what must be done must be done, as much as I hate to admit it.  Mom and I went shopping after supper, and I had a bit of luck.  I bought a pair of neat pants, decorated with delicate brown stripes, and a lovely lavender sweater, with a v-neck design in front and back.  Also, Mom was kind enough to purchase some new work pants for me.  They're quite snazzalicious.  My current work pants are corduroy, for at the time I started my job, they were the only black pants I owned.  (Sad, I know...)  And, as you all know, summer weather is starting to appear, and I wanted a pair of nice breathable pants.  I have them!  Whee!  I can't wait to work on Thursday to try them out.  Now, it is nearing my bedtime, and my snack is almost done cooking in the oven.  Only 6 minutes to go until I can indulge in the heavenly food known as biscuits and gravy.  So, with this, I'm out.

      A poem.  Untitled.  By me.  Seemingly random.  No structure or form.  With meaning to me, but not necessarily to you.  Writing in fragments tonight.  Anyway.  One last try.  One real sentence.  Or three.  These are mine.  Tonight was a dark night.  That's all I'll say.  Forming behind a sordid tongue Slithering out the mouth and staining the chin Groping their way across the filthy smog and smoke Puncturing my eardrums but not directly Using another to relay your accursed song Cowering in agony, as shrill shrieks resonate Breaking all ties, shattering my glass Causing casual destruction with one simple dirty phrase.

       "Fingers trace your every outline Paint a picture with my hands..."   Some quotes just make me smile.  Today was a gorgeous one, and taking full of advantage of it, I drove home from school with the sunroof open.  As a lighthearted song played, those lyrics from the song above drifted through the comforting breeze, and as they grazed my ear I smiled.  Perhaps you did too.  After I arrived at my humble abode, I received a call from Kacie.  She wanted to go shopping, and since my brain is eternally programmed to think that shopping is a great idea, I consented.  We searched for a Spinsters dress for her, and I believe we found the perfect one.  It is very bold colored and spunky, just like its wearer.  Afterwards, we bo-dee-oh-doed on over to Applebee's for a tasty dinner.  It was just what I needed:  a good conversation and a filling meal.  Who wouldn't be happy after that?  Then, I came home to a warm house.  If comfort has a smell, my house is it.  When you walk in, it's clean and fresh, the air tingling with a hint of the food prepared for dinner.  Next year at college, I don't know how I'll handle not coming home to that each night.  I suppose I will have to create my own home, my own comfort.  I wonder how my house will smell when I have settled down, with a husband and a couple kids.  I wonder if they will walk in to our future house and be comforted by the same things I am today.    Only time will tell... *smile*

       "I had a car accident with a magician.  It wasn't my fault.  He came out of nowhere."   You know what?    Sunday will mark the 10th month that Geoffrey and I have been together.  Wow.  Love is such an amazing thing.  I am surprised, impressed, softened, exhilarated, and weakened in the knees by it every day.  I wondered today what keeps two people in love.  Obviously, physical attraction may spark a relationship, but cannot sustain it.  Maybe it is the note he writes you every day and slips in your pocket in passing.  Perhaps it is the gentleness he only displays when he hugs you tightly each morning.  I have come to think it undefinable, yet so easily recognized.  Even now, I smile as I write this, knowing that I, Katie Rose Fritz, get to experience love tomorrow.  Goodnight, world.

      Greetings once again.  You probably won't notice, but I changed my little comment system.  The server I was using wouldn't allow me to delete multiple posts, which was becoming a common occurrence thanks to a few "ghetto" computers.  Tee hee.  Anyway, the sad part is that I lost all previous comments that you all have left.  Well, maybe it was a sign that I needed to do a little bit of spiritual...errr...bloggeral cleansing.  So, today was as I thought.  I was a little bit sleepy thanks to a late night, which was thanks to a certain AP Lit and Comp paper, which wasn't done early thanks to my procrastinatory tendencies.  Ahem.  Thankfully, I am now at liberty to rest at my leisure, after a 3-hour shift and a long day at school.  Tonight, Mom said she would save me some supper that I could have after work.  She decided to be creative, and, to my delight, tried with great success to recreate Ravioli di Portobello from Olive Garden.  'Twas simply divine.  I love my mommy.  *smile*  I don't know what I'll do at college when 6 out of 7 days a week the answer to "What's for dinner?" is "Ramen noodles.  Again."  Eesh.  There's only so many times in a month I can stand those.  My quota is easily reached, if you will.  Now, I will leave you, as my precalculus assignment beckons to me.  Yes, this time I will actually listen to it.  Well, m'dear, just as a note, I am very thankful that you're in my life.  I really am.  Honestly.  You keep me sane, and I thank you.  *smile*  Until the sun rises again, my friend.  I'm out.

      Today, instead of an update about me, I've decided to make it a collaborative effort, if you will.  It's quite simple.  Allow me to explain.  Everyone has different (and usually multiple) definitions of happiness, so why not share one or two?  Post a comment finishing the sentence "Happiness is..."  It'll be fun, I promise, and you'll be in a better mood when you're done reminiscing.  What more could one ask for?  *smile*  I'll start with a couple of my own:   1.   Being in love.  2.   Waking up on a warm Saturday, knowing you have no plans for the day.

      Phew!  What a day, what a day in the life of me!  I really did have a good one.  For some reason, the stars and planets were aligned correctly, and my mood was extra optimistic.  School was usual.  I went, I learned, I returned.  Nothing eventful, really.  Only one thing worth noting:  a group of us sang the national anthem at the local basketball tourney during 5th-6th period.  It was at the arena, and I rode there with Ellen, Shane, Mike J., and Lee.  We did an okay job at the song, though I don't quite like this version.  If you ask me why, I couldn't tell you.  Maybe it's the mere fact that DK is so prolific in choosing banner versions that I have become tired of learning them.  Ehhh well, it's late and I don't care to analyze my opinions.  *shrug*  On the way back to school, we stopped at the gas station to get frozen Cokes (mighty fine ones, I should note).  Overall, the outing was a refreshing and much-needed break from the daily grind.  Being a high school student yourself, I'm sure you can appreciate that.  After school was work.  I guess that's like saying after work, there was work.  I honestly do enjoy my job, though.  We were mondo busy tonight, so I was running rampant restocking the trash, wiping tables, and simultaneously sacking scrumptious snacks.  (Sorry, the alliteration bug bit me....I'm over it now.)  Anyway, a good time was had by all, and we managed to assemble all the orders correctly too!  When you're hot, you're hot.  *smile*  This weekend, a large chemistry worksheet and the infamous AP Lit and Comp project loom ominously over my head.  Lucky for me, my mommy graciously bought Power Point so I can finish my presentation at home.  I have to have it ready by Monday because I was the last person drawn to sign up.  *groan*  The Wonderful Amazing Luck of Katie strikes again.  Hardly.  *grumble*  Ehh, it will just push me to unprocrastinate, if that makes sense.  Being a high school student yourself, I'm sure you can appreciate that.

      "How truthful can I be?"  This question has echoed through my mind for a couple days now.    "How truthful, exactly?"    Almost every opinion that you or I will ever hear in our lives will be a censored version of the truth.  I have discovered in recent days that these opinions, displayed to the world on an online journal, can have an undesirable ripple effect.  Does one  actually  want to hear another's opinion, if it be negative?  One may counter, "Yes, for honesty is the best policy."  Is it?  It may be the most ethically upright policy, but it doesn't exactly do wonders in a relationship.  "Do these pants make me look fat?"  If every man in America answered that question in accordance with the "best policy," marriage would be obsolete.  With the increased divorce rate, though, one wonders if America is becoming more and more honest with passing years.    Ah, the irony...  Thanks for letting me ramble.    Oh, one more thing.   urlLink Click here  to see something completely hilarious.  Adieu.

      Today, Geoffrey and I went on a double dinner date to HuHot with Kyle Davis and Laura McCarty.  We had such a blast!  I know I am going to have a great time becoming better friends with those two.  After dinner, we went to Laura's house and watched  Cold Creek Manor , which Geoff and I both forgot we had already seen.  Already seen TOGETHER, might I add.  Tee hee.  Well, I'm talking to someone on the phone, and after that I'm off to bed.  Later, lovelies...  P.S.  If you care to, take the quiz I made.   Clickie here to go to it.

      "Today: A Short Summary" by Katie Fritz  Awakened with a jolt At an hour quite ungodly I lumbered out of bed The walking dead I did embody  Breakfast was a quick one My daily muffin, I adore Then, bro and I drove off Alas, we wanted to sleep more  Arriving at the school We scrambled off to class real quick The day, it was a good one It didn't suck, like -- Marissa  So, after class I sang With Concert Choir at a game Standing proud, we did our best The nat'l anthem we proclaimed!  Saying my goodbyes It was off to Kyle D.'s Where we talked and laughed a while As we ate mac and cheese  Getting home I had With my parents, a great meal Chicken, biscuits, green beans too How full I surely feel  Now, off to bed I hop I said this poem would be brief I'll end with a small note to Geoff "You stole my heart.  You thief!"   Good night, dear reader.  See you tomorrow!

      Hello, loyal blog hopper!  Much has transpired since my last post.  As always, let's start at the beginning (or  en el principio , for my fellow Spanish buffs.)  Yesterday, I decided to dress up for school.  You know those spur of the moment thoughts in the morning that just scream, "You want to look nice today, don't you?"  Well, I had one of them, so I went with it.  Of course, this one day I decided to don a knee-length skirt and tiny dress shoes is the one day it decided to snow.  "Oh great."  Nevertheless, I stepped out in my springy ensemb, my mood lifted by my fanciness.  It was so much fun, having everyone ask why I was dressed up and compliment me.  Who wouldn't have a good day with all that attention?  I really do have the best friends around.  They're so observant.  Tee hee.  After school, I learned that Chase was organizing a bunch of us to go to the highly-anticipated movie,  The Passion of the Christ .  Everyone was affected by that show, all of us in different ways.  It had a powerful message that backed up its equally powerful visuals.  I hope everyone has a chance to see it.  Regardless of your background, you should.  Next, Cindel and I went to dinner at Coyote Canyon.  MMMMM!  I love that place!  We ate our fill and then went to visit Jacob at HyVee.  He was very happy to see us, as was I him!  He is one of my very good friends (Hi Jacob!!)  Consquently, I took Cinnie home, and then it was off to Chase's house.  There, we watched a little bit of the movie  Johnny English  while hanging out and talking.  I always enjoy times like those.  When it got to be about 10:30 P.M., I took Geoffrey home and said goodbye to him, for he will be in Minnesota this weekend with handbell choir.  I hope he can have a good time without me, though I highly doubt it is possible.  I mean, who  can ?  *wink*  Coming to today, I worked from 7:30 to 2 P.M. and am currently enjoying a very much appreciated period of rest.  It will end at about 8:30 when I get to go babysit a little 2-year-old girl whose parents are attending a Bat Mitzvah.  *hums the song "Hava Nagila" quietly*  Until we meet again...

      I'm in history class, supposedly working on my "biography-in-a-bag" project.  Honestly though, he's given us until April to complete it.  I could, and will, just do it the night before.  Instead, my current task for this period is to finish AP Chemistry homework.  If only the mighty Noteboom allowed us a month and a half to do  that .  Sheesh.  Wishful thinking, I suppose.  In some randomly exciting news, Geoffrey and I were nominated for a Drammy!  "Cutest couple"...who ever doubted it?  Not me, not me ;)  Nicholas told me today during choir.  I guess they have been racking up nominees for a while.  How fun it will be to attend!  I am so glad I'm in drama.  They always think of fun events to put on.  Well, I best be back to "working."  Until later, little ones :)

      This was the first day in about two months I got to go home in sunlight.  Needless to say, it was refreshing.  Play is now over, and the free time I possess is, quite frankly, overwhelming.  Who knew that I would again discover the definition of  bored ?  Not me, that's who.  It was a very good day.  Oh, and did I mention...no homework tonight either.  Things are swinging my way, I tell you what.  This morning started off with a bit of a jolt.  I can't seem to train my brain to wake up when it's supposed to.  I always think, "You have 5 more minutes to sleep before you  really  need to wake up, Katie" and by the time those "5 minutes" are up, the clock says I was supposed to be downstairs 10 minutes ago.  Oh well.  I am sure tomorrow A.M. will be different, for I am actually going to provide my body with the required hours of sleep tonight (i.e. more that 5).  I wonder how that will feel.  Now, I leave you with an exerpt from Shakespeare's  Macbeth , in honor of the Guthrie Trip next week.  (Though we're going to see  Romeo and Juliet , I decided upon this quote.  Chase, this one's for you...)  "Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible To feeling as to sight? or art thou but A dagger of the mind, a false creation, Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? I see thee yet, in form as palpable As this which now I draw."

      Good evening.  I'm just home from my last night of managing box office at "Our Town."  What a great show.  I was glad I could do my part to help, however small.  Tomorrow looks to be busy.  First thing in the morning, I am scheduled to take the SAT at Washington.  That should last about 3 hours, then I have some "me" time.  A date with the mall is in order.  After that, I work from 6-9 P.M., and then babysit the rest of the night away.  The hypothesis is that Katie will be a pooped out girl at the end of the day.  (Did I just use 3rd person?  Kill me please.)  Geoff's grandparents are in town, and I am so excited to see them!  We are having brunch after I get off work on Sunday.  So kind of them to plan events around me, isn't it?  Makes me feel like part of the family.  *warm fuzzie feelings*  I think we're going to Royal Fork...yum.  One of my favorites.  If you're looking for an interesting event in this blog post, don't worry... I shan't disappoint you.    *hazy dream sequence, complete with fog and eerie music, begins*  It all began in American History class, 6th period.  This senior (obviously destined for a life of cigarettes and gambling, if you know what I mean) was talking trash about cheerleaders in general, saying random bad things that really weren't necessary.  We'll call her Mary.  Anyway, Mary just wanted attention, and sadly, was getting it.  Either oblivious to the fact we have a couple cheerleaders in class or indifferent to it, she was expressing herself quite loudly.  Finally, one of the girls said, "Well, at least we're out on the court, trying our best."  You can imagine how Mary reacted to that.  She got quite huffy and then sat in the corner brooding.    (I forgot to mention we had a substitute teacher today, being that Mr. Kuehn went home sick.  This substitute teacher might as well have been absent, for his class "control" mirrored if this had been so.)  Anyway, Mary went over to the substitute teacher and began complaining how people were pissing her off and yada yada.  Another girl in my class said Mary had anger management problems, and consequently, Mary called her "a stupid bi***."  How incredibly classy, I know.  It gets better.  Then, a boy said told Mary to calm down and Mary smacked him across the face.  Hard.  This Mary is the kind of girl you fear, the butchy one that you know would be able to find your house in complete darkness, sneak into your room, and beat you to an unrecognizable pulp.  Maybe this is the reason our substitute teacher did nothing about it the entire time.   Reason #2335 to love the public school system brought to you by Katie's Daily Muffin.   Good story, eh?  Well, I don't know if my words did it justice.  You had to be there.  Anyway, I leave you tonight with a fortune:     ...in bed.

      When she walks into the room, everybody turns:  some kind of light is coming from her head. Even the geraniums look curious... We're all attracted to the perfume of fermenting joy.  we've all tried to start a fire, and one day maybe it will blaze up on its own. In the meantime, she is the one today among us most able to bear the idea of her own beauty, and when we see it, what we do is natural: we take our burned hands out of our pockets, and clap.

       A Story  By K. Fritz  My first trip outside the city was proving to be quite the adventure.  Cars woosh past, scenery is slowly changing, and a Beatles album blares over the speakers.  I smile and glance into the rear view mirror at my life, packed into about five suitcases.  The brown, slightly worn bags were the only remnants of my past as I drove toward the now dusky horizon.  Opening my driver's side window, it smells like rain.  Everyone around here knows the familiar scent...slightly damp, a little musty, and a feeling that the air buzzes with a new energy.  Maybe it is because I have lived here for so long.  After a while, one becomes accustomed to these types of feelings.    Anyhow, here I am, driving away from that life.  I miss it now, as I reminisce.  Yet, looking back to the road, I feel confident in my new life, my new way, my new...everything.  The sun has set now, as I drive toward darkness.  Suddenly, I notice a car has pulled up in the passing lane beside me and is driving at the same speed so as not to pass but not to fall behind either.  Nervous.  I speed up; the car imitates.  Nervous.  I slow down; the car imitates.  Nervous.  I decide to look over.  Relief.  A familiar face inundates me with memories of my old world.  Mom.  In my rush to leave I had left my old quilt, the one I'd had since forever, at home.  College life would have been impossible without my comfort.  We stopped there on the side of the highway.  I ran to her and gave an embrace with all the power my arms could muster.  I am still your little girl.  I can't do this without you.  She wrapped my old quilt around me, squeezed me tight, and gave my forehead a kiss.  I won't forget it.  I stepped back into my car and drove away.  The rain began.

      Louisa asked me more questions.  Feel free to keep asking...they're quite fun to answer.  1.   What makes an eye the color that it is?   The exact color of the human eye is determined by the amount of a single pigment called melanin that is present in the iris of the eye. Melanin is a dark brown pigment that is deposited on the front surface of the iris. If a lot of melanin is present, the eye will appear brown or even black. If very little melanin is present the iris appears blue. Intermediate amounts of melanin produces gray, green, hazel or varying shades of brown.  Albinos have no pigment in their irises so the blood vessels in the back of the eye reflect light making the eyes look pink.  Another interesting point, all newborn babies have blue eyes because they haven't produced enough melanin to color them yet.  Cool, eh?  2.   Why don't we have hair on the bottoms of our feet or the palms of our hands?   This is my hypothesis.  Hair aids in sensing objects on one's skin.  The parts of the body that have hair need it either for protection or just as increased sensitivity.  Your hands have enough nerves to sense what they touch, so they don't need hair on them.  Besides, using common sense, hair would get in the way if it were on your hands or soles.  God was just being practical.    3.   What will you name your children?   I have actually thought about this quite a bit.  For the girls:  Emily Rose, Isabella Rose.  For the boys (I've only thought of one for sure):  Scott.

      Alright.  First and foremost, I GOT A 31 ON MY ACT!  *dances wildly*  I am so excited, and can hardly contain myself.  Second and secondmost, I saw the play tonight and it was stellar.  See it.  Moving on...  Here are the answers to the questions Geoff and Cindel asked me because you all are dying to know.   Cindel  1.   Why is the sky blue?   A clear, cloudless, daytime sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light.  When we look towards the sun at sunset, we see red and orange colors because the blue light has been scattered out and away from the line of sight.  I'll even include a picture:     2.   Why do they make glow-in-the-dark underwear?   I had no idea they even MADE glow-in-the-dark undies.  You ask what the reasoning is?  For one, whoever made them must have liked to pee or poo in the dark.  For two, they must have kept losing his/her undies in the dark bathroom.  Obviously, the next step was to invent some glowing underwear.  Obviously.  I mean, why turn on the light?  3.   Why does your butt hurt after you have been sitting down for a long time????   Your butt hurts after you've been sitting for a long time because you squeeze all the blood out of it, therefore making it numb and cold.  Mental image #1266 brought to you by Katie.   Geoffrey  1.   What do you want to do on our 1 year?   On our 1 year anniversary?  I would love to go out to dinner with you because, as you know, I am quite endeared both to you and food.  Olive Garden would be lovely.  But to be quite frank, anything we do will be wonderful.  Just make it really expensive and I'll be happy.  Hahaha.  2.   What is your favorite thing about me?   My favorite thing about you is how loving you are, and not just to me.  Your heart is so big and warm that it encompasses all your friends.  I have seen you grow so much over the years we've known one another and I couldn't be more proud of you.  3.   Why do you love me?   "How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways..."  You know why I love you.  I show you every day.  Silly pants :)  Good night, world...

       This is a letter I wrote to a friend.  I missed her today.   "I'll Ring You:  My Withdrawl In Words"  I wanted to call you today but it's too late. 10:35 P.M. on a typical Monday evening. I miss my best friend.  You.  Only you!  I thought we had something planned-- But we don't, and I lost a smile. So, I think we need another time together, Quite soon, in fact--  I wanted to call you today but it's too late.  You have always been my best friend. And you always will be. I miss my best friend. Do you want some girl time again soon? Maybe your withdrawl symptoms mimic mine. I hope they do.  I wanted to call you today but it's too late. 10:43 P.M on a not-so-typical Monday evening. I miss my best friend.  I'll ring you tomorrow.  Love, Katie Rose

       Black.  Green.  Blue.  Fuschia.  Buttercup.  Lavender.   These are my thoughts as I sit and spin my freshly created bracelet.  The six whimsical glass beads twirl across a stream of thin silver tubes as I twist my wrist.   Clinkclinkclinkjangleclink.   These are the sounds that tumble up to my ears as my creation bumps into itself, twirling and spinning.  It emits delightful strands of color that meet my eyes, as this simple bracelet dazzles my senses.  How satisfying to know I invented it.    Today, as you probably gathered, I went to the bead shop with Whitney.  We had a grand time carefully sorting and assembling beads for our masterpieces, all the while giggling and pointing at the baubles much too gaudy and large for our liking.  In the end, we each found the perfect pieces, she for a necklace, me for a bracelet.  We then went back to her house for a day of beading and talking.  I found that I, being more experienced at the hobby, enjoyed teaching her the various techniques and tips needed.  It is very true that to be able to teach something, you have to know it through and through.  I was glad I could help her learn.  Yesterday, Geoffrey shared Easter dinner with my family.  It is sad to me that his family never eats dinner together.  Luckily, I am able to share my family with him to help fill that missing part.  We always love to have him over here, and last night was no different.  Faja and Maja cooked a delicious dinner consisting of baby back ribs, baked beans, and green bean casserole.  Drool!  It was a valiant effort on their part, and a delicious one at that.  No food was left nor were any empty stomachs when all was through.  I hope it helped make Geoffrey's Easter memorable.  Mine was, largely because I was able to share it with the guy I love.  *smile*  (Okay, Sean, I'll end the schmoopie here.  Chase, I'm sure you can understand my interjections.  Tee hee.)  Now, it's about 8:21 P.M. on a lovely Monday evening.  Dad is out in the yard, Mom is downstairs sewing, and I am left to ponder in peace.  It is nice, and exactly what I have been needing for who knows how long.  Life is nice.  I end today with a quote from a friend on what it feels like to be in love...or potential love.  I found it quite satisfying.  You know how some phrases just kind of hit the spot?  Yeah, this one did.  "It's like dancing in a rainfall, but the rain is rose petals and [you] feel so at ease and beautiful and joyful because of the fact that [you're] dancing in a shower of rose petals."  Sigh.

      Hi.  Tonight, I found a graphic that gave me inspiration to create a little art.  I find these eyes simply breathtaking.  Enjoy.   P.S.  Geoffrey, the image is for everyone, but the words are for you.

      I don't know what is bothering me these days.  If I was 40 years older, perhaps I'd attribute my recent bipolar tendencies to menopause or hot flashes or something.  Unfortunately, I am only 17 and have no explanation for my recent, for lack of a better word, depression.  Well, maybe that's not entirely true.  As usual, allow me to begin at...err...the beginning.  The past few days have been unlucky.  Nothing seems to point up for me.  Perhaps this is my balance to all the happiness I usually feel.  Most days, if something happens to go wrong, I have no trouble seeing the bright side.  Lately, however, I have been treating life so morbidly and with such a short fuse.  At this point, you are probably wondering where I am pulling all of this from, for whenever you see me at school, I'm happy and upbeat and peppy and blah and blah and blah.  Don't get me wrong, most days, I DO feel this way, through and through.  Other days, it is merely a facade, covering up my true feelings because "Katie isn't allowed to have a bad day."    I suppose, if I were a psychologist, I'd say I was just trying to keep trouble away from my friends.  I don't want them to be burdened with my problems or to ask "What's wrong?," only to think I am in need of mountains of pity.  I think part of my weird mood is because of my doctor's appointment today.    (I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I need to explain.)    I haven't been controling my disease very well.  I have been lying to myself, my parents, and my doctor.  Writing down false sugars and eating the way I did before diagnosis has put my health into a spin.  I have had this damn thing for 4 years now, and I never have been able to get my control exactly right.  It's so hard.  No one reading this will fully understand, but trust me when I say that it isn't just a physical thing.  Thinking about life, death, and possible complications really screws with my mind.  Some days, I think that it would just be easier to give up.  Of course, the thought is dismissed right away, for I just couldn't...anyway.  But I just wanted to let this out of my brain.  If you leave a comment today, please don't pity me.  If there's one thing I loathe, it's that.  I just thought you'd want to understand...me.  I think this is me.

      *waves*  This weekend consisted of the following:   Attending the brilliant Best of Show competition  Going cosmic bowling with friends  Working a short shift  No homework (double w00t x2!)  Now for a few details of each.  You're dying to know?  Yes, I could tell.  Mind reading is a specialty here at the Daily Muffin.    Anyhoo, I dragged Mom to the show choir competition on Saturday.  Actually, she was more willing to go than I had thought.  Parents, when you show interest in "hanging out" with them, are quite eager to play the role of "cool parent."  They, when exposed to the right conditions, enjoy bonding time.  So, off we went.  The groups competing were impressive.  I had no idea Best of Show was such a large, wide-reaching event.  There were choirs from all around the region, one of my favorites being from Minnesota.  Their show was a professional, crisply danced production, with a fog machine, numerous costume changes, and large fabric panels that transformed the stage into another world!  Needless to say, Mom and I were awestruck and wouldn't mind seeing that one again.  Earlier on, Roosevelt had performed.  I was impressed with their show.  I had no idea the group had progressed such a long way.  Everyone was giving their all, and the momentum they're going at predicts a great show next year.  Kudos to all.  After the competition, I went home, had a lovely dinner with the folks, and was off to Empire Bowl for a bit of cosmic bowling.  I honestly don't know why our friends don't just stay home, turn on some flashy lights, crank up loud music, and talk (scream?) to each other, for the bowling is just a pretense.  We all get tired of it after about a game anyway.  Ahh well, it is a good time either way, just a tad expensive.    Then today (Sunday), I worked a little, from 11-2 P.M.  Not too eventful.  As I mopped around the store, I was thinking that I would make a good waitress.  I mean, I'm friendly and pretty efficient.  What do you think?  I imagine the job would be fun, setting aside the fact that I'd only make $2-3/hour from the restaurant itself.  I would just have to do an outstanding job to make up for it in lucrative tips.  Haha.  Well, now I am off to bed.  After a delightful midnight bite of orange tea and toast topped with marmalade, I am quite satisfied.  Until tomorrow.

      Hi there.  (A quick hello to Kelsey---> "Who are you?  My brain??!")  I'm in history class now, supposedly working on my a project.  You all know how that goes, I'm quite certain.  So, I thought I'd update my lil friend here instead; therefore, here I am.  Today has been great so far.  I wore a shirt I recently bought and new necklace I made, and many compliments have been tossed my way.  Who wouldn't have a good day after all that?  It is days like these that make it easy to be optimistic.  On top of it all, the weather is supposed to be divine.  I don't work tonight either, so I will be able to soak it all in.  Perhaps my plans will include sitting outside with a good book and some soothing tea.  Or maybe I'll go get a haircut.  I know you're probably laughing at that last one, but spontaneous events are the spice of life, agreed?  Who knows what I'll do.  That is the best part, not knowing.  *grin*  Now, I will indulge you with a bit of brain food.  I was playing Word Power on the Reader's Digest website and stumbled upon a cool new vocabulary morsel.  Now, if you know me at all, you have noticed my affinity for great words, so I invite you to chew on this one for a while.  Not literally, mind you.  My blog is very sensitive and it doesn't take well to biting.   epigrammatic (adj.)--concise, clever, and witty.

      Here I am again, back to the daily blog.  These past days have been filled with more homework than expected, hence, the lack of updates.  Ah well, hopefully you can get past your "Katie Withdrawl" symptoms for a minute, and thereby stop convulsing long enough to read this new installment.  School was usual.  Nothing too exciting, besides the fact that my morning started off with a jolt.  Time is skewed in the morning.  5 hours=5 minutes=5 seconds.  Agreed?  Yes, well I had approximately those 5 seconds to throw on a shirt and jeans and boogie downstairs to slam down my grapefruit halve before dashing out the door.  Fortunately, it was all uphill from there.  My brother being a pretty quick driver (aka: OWENslamonthebreak!!don'tyouseethatcar??!?), we got there on time.  All was well.  After  la escuela , I worked from 6-9.  Today's shift was, like school, pretty uneventful and hum-dum-dee-dum.  I did my usual sweep/mop/wipe routine about the lobby and was able to leave on time.  *Yay*  Then, I came home to a substantial pile of homework, which I just recently completed.  Amazing how finishing a few worksheets can leave you with such a sense of accomplishment.  I'm going to savor it while it lasts.  One last thing:  I was accepted to National Honor Society today!  I am excited.  That'll make a great application appetizer for the colleges.  *smile*

      Note:  If you won an award and would like to display it on your blog, simply right click and save it to your computer.  Then, upload it with the fun new Hello program that Blogger offers now.  I'm sure you can find an FAQ about it somewhere.  Congrats to all the winners!   Most Depressing Blog:   Craig       Allow me to explain.  Craig, Sean, Geoffrey, and I were hanging out at Cool Beans and were discussing our blogs.  Craig mentioned that he should get an award for most depressing blog.  I interjected that I always like to leave happy comments on his saddened posts, and we smiled about that.  Anyhoo, that is how I got the idea for my blog awards.  I dedicate all of these to Craig, and he receives the first award, naturally.   Best Writing in a Blog:   Chase       Anyone who reads it would agree.  Chase, you are a natural at writing.  Even though you may not think so, your posts just about your normal days are interesting.  I always enjoy your updates.  Best writing goes to you, my friend.   Funniest Blog:   Mary Katherine       Though everyone is a comedian these days, Mary Katherine is a comedianne.  Her quirky, English-style sense of humor never fails to strike a chord with me.  Cheery-O, old chap!   Most Insightful Blog:   Sean       With your many commentaries and quotes to ponder, who else would receive this award?  Thanks for giving us all food for thought, Sean.  This one's for you.   Most Inspiring Blog:   Jacob       Need I say more?  Jacob, your very nature is inspiring, and that is all too well reflected in your writing.  I always love to read your posts, as they put an inspiring and positive twist on life.   Most Smiles in a Blog:   Weesa       Do I need to explain this one?  Tee hee!  Louisa, my love, you light up all our lives with a smile, typed or not.  I enjoy reading your bloggiefriend, for it brings me the most smiles.  Hence, this award I bestow you.   Most Obese Blog:   Geoffrey       Geoff, I'm sorry but Owen insisted that I name your blog "Most Obese".  Just take it as a sign that he truly does like ya.   Obese = Coolest .  So you're "Most Coolest"!  Honestly.

      Yes, you read it right, folks!  I am hosting the first ever blog awards!    There will be  no  nominations, and  no  voting.  Instead, I will make awards for the blogs I have grown attached to this year.  Fear not if you do not win for the awards will be held again next year.  It doesn't not mean I don't hold you close to my heart (or so you think...bwahaha).  So insert your name _______ right there and feel loved now, if you don't win later.  Stay tuned tomorrow for the categories and (possibly) awards!    Good night, America.  Yes, that includes you, _______ (insert name written above).

      You know, some days I swear I need Prozac (hi Craig!) and others I feel so happy I could fly.  Today held both emotions, and luckily I got to end it with the happy feeling.  I went to Melissa Huntsinger's birthday party and had the best time I'd been through in a long while.  My friends are...unspeakably amazing.  On another great note, I made a new friend too.  His name is Drew, he's DK's nephew, and he looks exactly like John Mayer (hi Nick!).  Needless to say I got a picture with him in it.  I mean... well, do I have to explain that one?  Haha.  Thanks also to Geoffrey for letting me share his yummy lemonade blueberry Guzzler thing.  It made me feel summery.  Thanks to Stephanie Tschetter for having long nails and shoving them into the pile.  (PAIN!!)  Thanks to Melissa herself for being such a gracious host.  We're a family, guys.  Some people never find theirs.  I feel so lucky!  Oh one more thing...   WE ARE SENIORS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Monday arrived, and I walked again.    People shuffled past me, bumping my shoulder at regular intervals, pushing past so they wouldn't be late.  None of them remembered the encounter with me, however brief.  The day was run of the mill, as every other that had dawned before it.  Shuffle to work, shuffle to school.  Everyone with his own agenda, his own plan for the day.  I had mine.    The man had his.    I saw a man in the crowd today.  Black slacks, slightly scuffed loafers, nice dress shirt, standard issue business attire.  Nothing particularly special.  As he brushed past, time seemed to slow.  Now, my sidewalk neighbors were floating past.  All sound had escaped the scene.  I saw this man in the crowd today.  He moved slowest of all, and I could see who he was.  A business partner, scrambling for the best deal.  A single guy who had recently stopped believing in love after being rejected...again.  A son who, to his mother, was the most handsome man in all the world.  A poet, strugging to arrange his words in the right order.  All at once, I knew what he ate for breakfast this morning, what his favorite movie was, the person he hoped to be, and the last time he felt at peace.  All at once this standard issue man was human too.  I saw him in the crowd today.  And I don't mean I simply looked.    Who have you seen?

      I really shouldn't be writing this.    After all, I do have homework and many other productive things I should be doing.  Nevertheless, I'll let my harmless little blog snatch me away from my duties yet another time.  Also, a very jolly hello to Miss Stephanie Tschetter because I know she's reading this and squeaking at the fact I mentioned her in here.  *waves to Steph*  Today hasn't been the greatest.  Things started out all right, but then I had a bad time at work which made things go completely downhill.  Everyone has those kinds of days.  I probably shouldn't worry about it so much.    A morbid topic came to my mind earlier in the day.  What would it be like if I died?  Have you ever thought that to yourself?  I mean, don't take it the wrong way.  The question wasn't one out of depression, but rather a strange curiousity.  What would it be like if I died and watched over my funeral?  What would I see?  More importantly, who?  I wondered if a life is only worth the amount of collective tears shed at the funeral.  It is a sad thing to wonder, yet I did.  Sometimes, I wonder about this very strongly, and wish I could experience it.  I would want the experience to be reversible, but able to be remembered.  He'll probably get angry at me for saying this, but sometimes I wonder (and I don't know why) what my boyfriend would do if I were watching over as a ghost.  And my family.  Would they be hunched over in tears?  Would I see my brother, for the first time, cry?  Would they all smile at some point, lost in a memory of me?  This whole idea either sounds completely narcissistic to you or you've felt it yourself.  Maybe I'm not the only one who is morbidly curious.  I really shouldn't be writing this.

      Over again the weekend is.  Happy I am still.  Stop talking like this I will.  Thankful I know you will be.  Hello, my friend.  What a lovely evening we are presented with tonight.  Rain patters on my roof and steam billows from my green tea as I pen this, and I couldn't be more content.  I just finished creating a whole bunch of graduation cards for my friends.  My upcoming weekends will consist of traveling to many open houses, and what good party goer doesn't come prepared?   *shrug*    Anyhoo, since I abandoned my social butterfly wings this weekend, I haven't much of an update to give you.  I'm sorry.  Luckily though, I come prepared with a song.  Its melody is gorgeous, so please give it a listen.  I'll even include the lyrics.   Burn me down if that's how everything's gonna start With a flame from the heat of the look on your face On a day like today could have made out every raindrop falling down on your head Now I fear that I may taste these tears rolling down my face and realize Something is wrong with the light of the sun in the core of the sky  With you and everyone

      Ahhhh.  Friday is finally here and is winding to a close.  It feels great to come even closer to the end of the school year.  This summer is going to be amazing...  I don't know if I've told any of you, but I'm going to Las Vegas for the first time in August.  My cousin is getting married there.  I know, I know, but if you knew her, you'd understand.  *smile*  That trip is going to be a definite highlight.  I just hope I don't get sick on the plane.  Bring gum...lots of gum.  I found a great lyric that really made me happy.  That second line struck me something fierce, for it sums up how I feel about my writing most days.   This whole world needs an anthem And I'm trying to put the words where they belong Yeah, this whole world needs an anthem And I'm hoping everyone will sing along.

      *waves*  Today, I took the AP Chemistry exam and it wasn't as bad as I expected.  Allow me to repeat that, for I love that sentence.  It wasn't as bad as I expected.  A great weight has been lifted off of my life, and from this point on, the school year will be delightfully livable.  Can I even go as far as...fun?  Yes, I think I will.  Fun.  Ha, now there's a concept.  According to plan, Ellen, Ryan and I went to eat Chinese after the test today.  I had beef lo mein, and they both had sweet and sour  pollo .  (That's Spanish for chicken.  Yeah.)  Anyway, it was a good time, as always.  My fortune cookie read "Face facts with dignity."  Little did I know that I would do just that later in the day, but that's another story.  Anyhoo, I even had time to get gas before driving back to schoolie.  $1.999/gallon!  Yay...not.  Every once in a while I draw inspiration for blog topics from a website with a calendar of them...a topic listed for every day of the month, for every month of they year.  It's kind of neat.  Anyway, I thought I'd explain that before I start to write today's suggestion:  "Write a poem about laundry."  Why, you ask?  *shrug*  Well, why not?   Dirty and Wrinkly:  A Poem  By K. Fritz  In a dark room, there's a hamper To that room Mom demands I scamper Piles of shirts and pants all sorted And many socks, their colors assorted  Beginning my task, I throw stuff in Push the button, they start to spin Round and round with soap and bubbles Washing away all my dirt troubles  When the buzzer sounds, I smile For I can now dress in style Clean, clean clothes I do possess And I'm sure you acquiesce.  Hehe.  Using  acquiesce  in a poem?  Who does that anyway?  I read the poem to my parents, sure that they would appreciate it, and they did.  Dad even had his own suggestion for a poem.   Laundry:  A Poem  By S. Fritz  Roses are red, Violets are blue, I think laundry sucks. I bet you do, too.

      So, as you can see, I've been completely revamped.  In the blog sense, that is.  I find this new dotty layout to be quite springy and refreshing.  Also, I like dots.  So ha.  Today was exciting, as I got to wake up and see the world.  What a great day it was too.  Nothing went wrong...well almost nothing.  I forgot my ID at home, you see, but Cindel had me covered (with a big lid) by buying me lunch and letting me borrow her spare badge of identification.  *smile*  What a great friend I have.    In 4th period, as I sat in the choir room , I was overwhelmed with the realization that First Ladies fails to impress me.  I don't like the songs we're doing, nor the motivation level of our group.  I know Suite will be so much better next year because everyone will want to be there.  A more intimate setting surely has its benefits.  Besides, I want to wear a sparkily dress and boogie down like the dancing fool I am.  That's right.  Dancin' foo'.  Some exciting news!  A couple days ago, I signed up for an account on Ebay.  While looking around, not expecting to find anything, I came upon a John Mayer concert poster from Japan that I bid on.  Well, tonight I checked the item, and it turns out that I WON!  Whee!  How exciting!  So, I will be receiving the poster in the mail soon.  Once you start looking around on Ebay, it is so addicting.  They have...anything and everything.  I even searched for "poop" and they had those joke plastic ones.  Haha.  I thought it was cool.  On a serious note, I have my AP Chemistry exam tomorrow morning.  *shudders*  I am nervous, but not as much as I thought I'd be.  My frame of mind is to focus on the large amount of chemistry I've learned, rather than the comparatively small amount that I don't know.  Besides, they don't expect us to know all the information on the test, and that, my friend, is a large reassurance.  After the test is over, Ellen, Ryan, and I are going to eat Chinese for lunch.  Mmmm!  It has been a long time coming for me.  Tomorrow, I'll post the fortune I get.  Until then, remember:   A metal oxide + water -----> Base (hydroxide)  A non-metal oxide + water -----> Acid   Sorry to confuse you, but sometimes facts are remembered best if you write them out.  Good night.

      My friend,  Yet another week has ended, and the school year becomes ever shorter.  Only 13 days left (not counting weekends, o'course).  It hardly seems possible.  I'll be a senior next year, and as my brother says, "Ahhh, power!"  Yes, broja.  Power, indeed.  Today was filled with nice feelings.  I had a grand time waking up at the time I was supposed to be downstairs, scurrying as I usually do to arrive downstairs on time.  It rarely happens.  *shrug*  Maybe I will improve on my time management skills in the next year.  It will be a necessity, for my loving maja and faja will not be there to poke my lazy butt out of bed.  Perhaps the only person helping me in that department will be my future roommate.  Cynically, she will blast me out of my dreamlike state with a loud blaring of killer, loud, guitar riff-filled music and the delightful smell of a Marlboro.  *frown*  Optimistically, however, I'll be woken by the voices on her yoga VHS tape and the lovely smell of a toasted bagel with cream cheese that she bought for me as a thank you for helping her study the night before.  Yes, now wouldn't that be something?  Call me an idealist and I'll... agree with you.  *sigh*  One event I look forward to next year is the trip to San Francisco, California.  Thus, I have chosen "California" by Phantom Planet as my song of the day.  I'm going to choose one every once in a while now.  (Quick note to my buddaloo Cindel:  I bought the CD on Amazon.com tonight.  Thanks for introducing me to the band...I love 'em!)  Anyhoo, the song makes me think of Cinnie, and the locale makes me think of Jacob, so it is to you both I dedicate this with love.  Hopefully when you listen to it, it will make you feel just right and content, as I do right now.  In fact, I feel infinite.

      A quote I read recently.  It's just for our mommies, in honor of Mother's Day:   "'Right.  You know?  Girls like guys to be a challenge.  It gives them some mold to fit in how they act.  Like a mom.  What would a mom do if she couldn't fuss over you and make you clean your room?  And what would you do without her fussing and making you do it?  Everyone needs a mom.  And a mom knows this.  And it gives her a sense of purpose.  You get it?'  'Yeah,' I said even though I didn't."   Oh, exciting (semi) news!  I am nominated for Looking Best in a Tee Shirt and Jeans for the Drammy Awards.  Hehe!  How completely flattering!  *smile*  Anyway...  Today, I was having trouble calming my mind for some unknown reason.  Reading always soothes me, so I picked up  The Perks of Being a Wallflower  that I recently rented from the library.  In it, the narrator mentions a song by The Smiths called "Asleep".  It is a simple melody and simple words, but it calmed me down.  This was partly because I was reminded of being a kid again, in bed after a long day outside.  I have been wanting to revert back to my childhood lately, judging from recent posts.  I hope tonight you'll join me in remembering yours.  Click play.

      When your eyes are tired the world is tired also.  When your vision has gone no part of the world can find you.  Time to go into the dark where the night has eyes to recognize its own.  There you can be sure you are not beyond love...  Sometimes it takes darkness and the sweet confinement of your aloneness to learn  anything or anyone that does not bring you alive  is too small for you.    urlLink

      "It's not just a haircut.  It's a lifestyle."  That was a comment about  mullets  I heard on the radio this morning.  Full of hilariousity, I thought.  I am afraid that AudioBlogging will be to typed posts what email was to snail mail, which is of course making it obsolete.  I have decided to fight this impending overthrow in power (aka: coup) by actually  typing  today's update!  Yay for America; we can protest here.  Hmmm, you know, that would make a great slogan for our country.  And a great title for this post, as you can clearly see.  So, today.  It's always about today, isn't it.  Yes, well, I woke up on my own promptly at 9 A.M.  I didn't need an alarm, Mom, or anything else to assist me.  I tell you what, this whole body internal clock is an amazing thing.  Too bad I haven't put it into use until now, eh?  Well, maybe not.  As I said, it's always about today.  After getting up and eating an eclectic breakfast (chips and salsa, a nectarine, and one slice of pumpernickle rye toast), I went to work at 11:45.  It was great, perfectly complimenting the rest of my 24-hour chunk of life (aka: day).  There, I found out that I got a 50 cent raise on my pay!  *sings in a tenor-type voice*  HALLELUJAH JESUS!    That means that every two hours, I'll have an extra buck than I would have had before!  I'll take it.  Most definitely, since I have 37 hours this pay period, and I'll be rolling with the homies.  Or rolling in the money.  Whichever you prefer.  I like the first one because it was on Degalau's tee shirt.  Speaking of Stephanie, Mom and I saw Chasetifer at Barnes and Noble today.  When we went inside, he went straight to the architecture books, and I laughed to myself.  I can't wait to see what all of my senior friends become in their later years.  A seemingly random thought I know, but they're all so incredibly gifted that they can't help but do great things.  In fact, they already are.  To go  back to the future  (Wow, my segues are great today.  First, Jello to Chase.  Now, Chase to Back to the Future.  I am on a roll with the homies.  Anyway.)  Let me start over.  To go back to the future, yesterday was Jello's celebration which she knew nothing about (aka: surprise party).  It was  muy divertido  as it was the first one I had ever participated in.  Also, it was fun to find out some new facts about my lovely friend, such as she loves Marilyn Monroe and Jelly Bellies!  Little morsels like that are the spice of life and also make for great gift ideas.    Later in the party, we went to Terrace Park and walked in the gorgeous Japanese gardens.  Did you know that someone vandalized those recently?  I was shocked to hear that.  Now, as Mom says, the city is going to build a fence around it so people cannot access the park at night.  I hope it's not an ugly fence.  Anyway, we had fun at the gardens, especially when playing in the step waterfall.  AJ got the brunt of our splashing, but didn't seem to mind.  It was a hot night, and the refreshment was well received.  That pretty much sums it up except for one short blurb (aka: thing).  I had lunch with my daddy today and I love him.  Remember Father's Day on June 20.  Now, that's what I call a post.  'Cya.

      Hello all!  'Tis I once again, your Fair Mistress Katieeee!  I have returned from the far off, barren land known as Rapid City.  I'm not joking about that barren part either.  You think Sioux Falls isn't much of a city?  Ha.  Just travel to the Westside (yo) and visit our friends of Rushmore.  Yeesh.  Talk about Hicksville.  Owen and I discussed today how all people from South Dakota are crazy.  No, I'm serious.  We are insane.  Yes, that includes  you  too.  It must be in the water.  Today was our last day there, and we ended up returning a day earlier than planned.  We went on the Volksmarch, which is where a whole bunch of folks (about 8,000.  I asked!) scurry up the Crazy Horse Monument.  It was so cool.  I didn't realize how amazed I would be.  I mean, you walk about 5 miles to this large mountain with a face carved into it, and it's the neatest thing in the world.  You can see forever from there.  I will put a picture later on.  I was thoroughly impressed.  South Dakotans may be crazy, but we live in a gorgeous place.  In other news, I started on a coffee craving as of 8 A.M. this morning.  My boyfriend (aka Caffeine Addict) would be proud.  Even when we stopped at this tourist place for lunch, I had their 5 cent coffee.  It wasn't bad, to my utter shock.  Anyhoo.  After that, Owen and I had a great time watching The Last Samurai on DVD   IN THE CAR  !!  How utterly 21st Century is that?!  I know, I know.  I shouldn't have ended this post with such excitement.  I'll try to dull it down next time.  Honest.

      Today has been excruciating.&nbsp; I think long drives in the car cause&nbsp;a person to be extremely lazy.&nbsp; Hence, my current condition.&nbsp; Blah.   As I type this, I'm bidding on some more bags on Ebay.&nbsp; How thrilling, I know.&nbsp; Do they have an EA?&nbsp; Ebayers Anonymous?&nbsp; I think I am going to need that quite soon.   Hey, let's get together tomorrow, okay all?&nbsp; A movie at someone's house or something?&nbsp; I need to get back into the swing of things.   I think that if you read this, Geoffrey darling, you should call me.&nbsp; I don't really mind the time.&nbsp; Just call my cell phone...it's freshly charged.   Until the sun rises again.&nbsp; Yes, that's it.

      Good  morn , all.   Today, I begin the long jaunt to St. Cloud, Minnesota with my dear old fam-fam.&nbsp; You see, we are required to attend a family reunion on Saturday.&nbsp; Since I am related to most of the people that will be there, I am forced to join in the festivities.&nbsp; Joyful.&nbsp; I am now requesting an odd, but flavorful favor of you.&nbsp; If you do so wish, please leave me a voice mail message on my phone during the 3 days I am gone.&nbsp; I would like to listen to something other than my family once in a while.&nbsp; So yes,  do that .&nbsp;   Tonight I went to  Get Smart  at   la escuela de Roosevelt  , and it was lovely funny!&nbsp; I was delighted at how darling Geoffrey looked on stage in his "grey" hair.&nbsp; Also, Heidi and Ebony looked drop-dead  sexy  in their costumes!&nbsp; Don't you just love the 60s era?&nbsp; The clothes were simply  tres bon chic !&nbsp; *nods*&nbsp; Afterwards, we all proceeded to Perkins for a bite.&nbsp; I find it fascinating that though we give restaurants good business when we go out, they never fail to yell at us for being their customers.&nbsp; *shakes head*&nbsp; Sure, we laugh loud sometimes, but since when is that prohibited?    *begin dream sequence*     &nbsp;    Host :&nbsp; "Hello there, group of teenagers!&nbsp; Welcome to Perkins!"     Group of Teenagers :&nbsp; "Hello, host!"&nbsp; *laugh*     Host :&nbsp; "I'm assuming we can seat you in the smoking, non-laughing section, correct?"     Group of Teenagers :&nbsp; "Yes of course!&nbsp; And please give us the curtest, rudest waitress you have!"     Host :&nbsp; "I had her ready when I saw you walking in.&nbsp; Right this way, please."     &nbsp;   *end dream sequence*    Yeah, that's basically how it went down.&nbsp; Don't forget to leave me a message, dear darling.&nbsp; I would love you a great big much if you did.   *hands you a  Twinkie *

       Wow.&nbsp; I just made the best CD ever.&nbsp; Do you know those sorts of songs&nbsp;that give you the shivers?&nbsp; Yeah, it's a collection of those.&nbsp; So I'm sitting here in this nicely temperatured room shivering.&nbsp; It's almost funny.  &nbsp;  Tonight, I have Honor's Choir practice at Roosevelt.&nbsp; Too bad I don't really know any of the songs yet.&nbsp; Hehe, it's okay.&nbsp; Neither does Weesa.&nbsp; We proved that to each other yesterday when we tried to practice on her piano.&nbsp; Let's just say there were many missed notes and a lot of "doo doo doo"ing going on.&nbsp; Basically Concert Choir practice.&nbsp; Ha, just kidding.&nbsp; Sort of.  &nbsp;  So, I did yoga yesterday at the health club.&nbsp; I felt advanced because I knew everything she did.&nbsp; Next time, I plan to attend Intermediate Yoga!&nbsp; It feels good to exercise.&nbsp; You should.  &nbsp;  Oh, and if you're looking for some good music, try "The Noose" by A Perfect Circle and "1985" by Bowling For Soup.&nbsp; If you're too cheap to buy a CD, I found a good music downloading thing.&nbsp; It's called Limewire.&nbsp; So, go get ya some good music.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I hope it makes you shivery too.

       Ouch.  &nbsp; My arms hurt.&nbsp; You see, I went and worked out at the Avera McKennan Fitness Center for the first time today.&nbsp; It was, dare I say, fun!&nbsp; With a combination of yoga, cardio, and strength training, I plan to become an improved healthier me.&nbsp; I still feel&nbsp;very amateur using those foreign machines in front of many attractive fit people.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Soon, I hope I can be one of&nbsp;them.&nbsp; All of us could do better in that department, I think. &nbsp; Currently, I'm working on finding some songs for a mix tape.&nbsp; It consists of songs mentioned in  The Perks of Being a Wallflower  by Stephen Chbosky (an excellent tale, by the way).&nbsp; When I find all the songs (including some that are proving to be quite obscure), you can expect a copy. &nbsp; I won some vintage shoes off of Ebay a couple days ago.&nbsp; That was quite the experience. &nbsp; That's pretty much my life as it sits.&nbsp; Or as it stands.&nbsp; I don't just sit anymore.&nbsp; That's for the anti-fit folk.&nbsp; Oh yes.&nbsp;  &nbsp; *nods happily in contentment*

      Pink contained in plastic dish Makes me wonder and then wish Lips that shine like diamonds glitter A taste so sweet, never bitter Apply it with peach fingertips Glide it right onto your lips Flavor it a lustrous cherry Equivalent to a gossamer fairy Or perhaps a gleaming plum Always bold, never ho-hum Some may choose a gossamer pink That one always makes boys wink A tang of orange or melon-apple Hues of citrus, emerald, and snapple All contained in plastic dish Making me wonder and then wish My lips now glisten like diamonds gleam All because of one sweet cream The flavors of pink lip gloss

       I have a new phone now.  Yay!  It is a camera phone, too, so most likely I will be seeking your picture soon.  Why, you ask?  Well, then I can program it where whenever you call me, your happy picture will pop up and then I will push the ignore button.  Ha, just kidding.  Maybe.  *chuckle*  Anyhoo, the days to Honor's Choir dwindle down and I get more and more excited.  I can't wait to wear my dress for all to see!  *skips*  Oh, and singing too.  Yeah.  Haha.  I also can't wait to feel the power of singing in an amazing choir.  It has been a while since I have done that.  Today I got a haircut and I have bangs now!  Exciting, eh?  I think so.  They're not creepy uniform bangs though.  I like them and I think you will too.  At least, you will if you ever want me to talk to you again.  Ha, just kidding.  Maybe.

       So school is coming soon and we have no choice but to go back. Not that we wouldn't want to eventually go back, but that if it could be prolonged, I'm sure we all would gladly push it back. This school year isn't going to be bad or anything. It is just going to be very stressful, but at the same time  so much fun!  Parts of me will miss this past year. Being a junior was the most fun I've had... ever. So then, I guess we can assume that senior year will be all the better. Between Concert Choir, Show Choir, San Francisco, and Drama, not to mention all the numerous random fun activities there will be throughout the year, I don't think I have to worry about not having enough fun with all of you crazy fun people. So until the next post.   {Geoffrey}

       Yes, that is what I shall be. The Keeper of the Keys. *holds them high for everyone to see* INDEED. I decided that I like this blog because it let's me be ponderish, one of my favorite things to be, and then I get to see what people think without clicking on the comments button. Let's toast to that.   This is for my Katie: Will you be my warmie? *cheesy smile*   To everyone: Hey, I dare you to move.  Why is it that we spend so much time in&nbsp;a hurry to grow up but then when we finally get there we wish we could be young again? Is it because we wear diapers when we're small but once again when we're wrinkly? Why is it that I sit here, finally looking at my senior pictures, wondering where my life went? It seems as if these last few years have been on a&nbsp;slight fast forward and now it's only going to get faster. I wanted so badly to grow up, but now I find that I'm just a little bit scared to grow up the rest of the way. I hate to bring this up once again, but I find that it crosses my mind quite a bit lately, and I suppose I can't be the only one. I have officially finished my first senior thing and now I think I'm ready. I'm ready to actually classify myself as a senior. Indeed. Louisa Mae Soli-Holt&nbsp; has proclaimed herself a senior, one year away from starting her first year of college. I think I can handle that. I hope I can anyway. =)  This being the end of this post, good byes are in order. Look for a long survey on my blog...  urlLink www.jiggymae.blogspot.com  ...in the near future. Come to Coldstone on Thursday night and see me all dressed up. Smile a lot because it'll get you through the hard stuff and accentuate the best stuff. Remember that I love you. Because I do. Okay? Okay. =)  **Louisa**

       Wow, Chase, that's a very interesting question. It sounds fairly logical to me but, somehow, it doesn't. I think it mainly depends on the persons' attitude. I dhunno, really. I guess my answer is False. Good question! Bye!

       Hey all... I just wanted to run an idea past you guys.&nbsp; Would anyone be interested in coming to a party at my house in Brandon the Saturday before school starts?&nbsp; That would be the 28th of August.&nbsp; Umm... yeah... leave a comment or a post and let me know what you think and perhaps I will set it into motion.  --Ashley M.

         I think that the statement may be true and false at the same time.&nbsp; I agree for the most part with what Sean said.&nbsp; It's understandable that a person may be quiet around their friends and talkative with their loved one because the reason they are that person's loved one is because they feel they can be the most open and comfortable with them.&nbsp; Make sense?&nbsp; But, as Sean so eloquently stated, it depends on the situation and who is around.&nbsp; Bottom line, sometimes people to crazy things and are entirely unpredictable and not able to be&nbsp;summed up in&nbsp;one sentence.&nbsp; So... Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is my quite possibly indecipherable standpoint.&nbsp;    --Ashley M. Ludewig--

       Well, in response to Katie's question: yes katie, I think it should be by the half&nbsp;year now. Because you have reached the point where a month is such a small percentage of your total relationship time. Plus, I don't like hearing about it  every single month . I am happy for you, but I think it may be a little more special if it is by the half year. Then, I will be able to say, "Wow, it's been a year and a half already? My, how time flies."   Done with that topic. Now to Chase's question: The best gift people give their loved ones is in their personality.&nbsp; If they are a bitch to most people, they'll be sweet to their lover, if the don't talk much to most people, they'll never stop with their lover.&nbsp; True or False?  Well, I agree, but then I don't. I believe that they act differently tho their loved one, but not necessarily all the time. Let's say a person is with  only  their loved one. Then, I agree with you. They will act kinder and sweeter and gentler. But, if the person is with their loved one  and  someone else is around too, they will act totally different. I dont' know if it is to impress their friend, but they say things and may even be cruel to their "loved one." Now, for some people it is the same when friend are around, but that is because they are not afraid to let their friends know how they feel or act towards their "loved one." I hope you understood. That is my experience in these things.

       I realize now that my post title would be a great name for a band.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;   Anyway, I am having trouble with my space bar this evening, as I am on our old downstairs computer.&nbsp; We call it Biwwy (retarded voice of "Billy") because it really does have the technological capabilities of a 76 year old that has recently had a labotomy.&nbsp; Anyway, after a long struggle to make the link work I have joined this blog.&nbsp; Good idea, by the way, my dear Geoffrey!&nbsp; I like the communal (right word?) aspect&nbsp;of this.&nbsp; A collaborative effort always turns out peachy in the end.&nbsp;   Okay, so today is Geoff and my year and two month anniversary.&nbsp; That sounds weird.&nbsp; I think we should count by half years at the most now.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Sounds like the right thing to do.&nbsp; Anyway, I must depart.&nbsp; I have summer school in the morning and it is already 1:35 A.M.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; Ahhhh,&nbsp;a night in the life of Katie.&nbsp; Or any of you for that matter.&nbsp; We're all night owls...it must be something in the water.

       I really think clowns are stupid.&nbsp; To many colors all at once with those damn white faces!&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; I really have never thought of them as creepy either... except Bozo the clown... he was kinda creepy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway...  New topic of discussion... a little deeper... a bit of philosophy.    The best gift people give their loved ones is in their personality.&nbsp; If they are a bitch to most people, they'll be sweet to their lover, if the don't talk much to most people, they'll never stop with their lover. &nbsp;   True or False?

       Well, I would have to say that clowns are&nbsp;funny and scary at the same time. I remember going to the circus and seeing clowns and going to the bathroom and crying the whole time I was at the circus.&nbsp; But, now, they don't bother me. In fact, my church has a group called "The Clowns of St. John." Basically, they go around to the hospitals and visit sick kids. So, in that perspective, clowns are good. But, who knows? Maybe it's just some big cover-up?

       No joking! I am scared to death of clowns. I went to a psychiatrist about it one time and he said that I have Coulrophobia, or the fear of clowns. I don't know why, but they have always frightened me.&nbsp;I think it's because they are constantly happy. No human I know is constantly happy so, therefore, I do not classify clowns as human. That's all I have to say about that. Farewell!

        True, true. Clowns and their habits are creepy, but who says you can't have fun with that? I mean, come on. Nikki Willhoit is creepy, yet we have fun with... I'm done. I personally don't have anything against clowns. Well... mostly. The one in "IT" is still a bit scary, but that's just because I was traumatized. The way I see it is that if it's creepy, poke it. Then, based upon its reaction, do it again, and again, and again. Then it'll just cry a lot. There, now it's not creepy anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; :P  &nbsp;   {Geoffrey}

       It honestly depends on the situation, but seeing as how they are usually played by toothless carnies trying to screw with little kids' minds I say they are creepy.&nbsp; Maybe not to the little kids, but to me they are.&nbsp; Plus there's almost never a girl clown so it's always just a bunch of guys doing stupid and sometimes randy things to one another.&nbsp; ... but that's just me.  --Ashley M.

       Just wanted to let you blokes and lassies know that my party on the 28th is set in stone. I think if you all show up any time after 7:30 or 8:00 that will be grand and the females are welcome to stay the night while the males will be asked to leave about 1 most likely.  DIRECTIONS: Make your way to Rice St., whether it is by taking 229 and getting off at the Rice exit, taking 12th St. to Cliff and Cliff to Rice, or 12th to Cleveland and Cleveland to Rice. Take Rice east for a long, long time until you reach the stoplight at the corner of Rice and Sioux in Brandon. Take a right (south) onto Sioux... follow it for a while, 6 or 7 blocks (I can't remember which) past the cemetary you will see a street marked Chapelwood. Take a right (west) onto Chapelwood and go to the end of the first block where you will find, on the left (south) side of the street a blue two-story house on the corner numbered 209. That is my place of residence.  Additionally, feel free to bring any snacks and/or soda you wish. We will have some food here but I have a feeling the rents won't want to fork over a lot of dough for party supplies. Also, if you have movies you'd like to watch bring them, however we don't have a DVD player hooked up in the basement so they have to be VHS.  I look forward to seeing you all soon.  --Ashley M. Ludewig--  P.S. Girls who wish to stay would be well advised to bring some sort of blanket and pillow because we have a few extra but not a TON and if a lot of you want to stay (which would be awesome and you are more than welcome) we will run out of blankets and some of us will freeze and be pillowless.

I've never been there before and I think I'd enjoy it. By the way, I am really sunburned and sore. If you didn't know already, I play the tuba in marching band and it is really heavy but i'm getting used to it. Okay. Bye for now.
