      Well one of my friends and their girlfriend got into a bit of a rough spot today. He read some stuff he shouldn't have, and understandably she was upset & hurt. But anyway, he came to me for advice and I told him everything I could. Later I talked to her on the phone, and it seemed like things were ok. Much later in the evening I talked to her boyfriend again, and I found out they are speaking again so that is good.  My girlfriend came over to hang out today too. She was over while I was talking to my friend's girlfriend and I noticed she got a bit upset looking. Once I was off the phone we had a bit of a talk, and it turns out she is feeling a bit jealous of my friendship with this woman. She is worried that something will "happen" between us, and this is an understandable worry since I did hurt her in the past. But it still bugs me that just when I think we have moved past it, something happens that brings it all back.  To quote myself from when I was talking about my relationship with a friend,   Shit man, soon enough you'll end up like me..All fucked by shit going on with your girlfriend and then you reach the point where you just don't give a shit anymore and either things will work out &amp; you'll be happy or they won't and it wil end. But all at the same time, you can't just leave her because you love her too much to hurt her.  And again, I know that is a bit of an extreme view of things but I plan to just continue things as they are going and just see where they go.  ----------  Current Mood : Happy  Current Song : Thomas Dolby - She Blinded Me With Science

      Well looks like I had my first blog break down, heh. Ah well, I know that the majority of what I said is true but at the same time it isn't. I do need to sit down, and have a talk with my girlfriend about some things though but our relationship it isn't nearly as bad as it sounded last night.  I had a really weird dream last night too, and I have no clue what to make of it. I watched the dream happen all in 3rd person too. Basically the dream started with me walking into my girlfriend's room at her house. When I got there, there was some other guy in her bed. They were both naked, and at this point I realized so was I. So I got into bed with them, feeling a little upset and very confused. While in bed my girlfriend started "fooling around" with me, and then she stopped and switched to "fooling around" with the other guy. Then for one reason or another, I ducked under the covers for just a second and when I came back out the guy was gone. At this point I got out of bed,  and started fighting with my girlfriend over this guy and what she was doing with him. (I also have the feeling I've dreamed of this guy with her before for some reason, but I can't remember any such dreams of course) And that turned into just a screaming match. After we fought for awhile she just left the room. And then I woke up.  Man, I have no clue what to make of that...I mean I've never had the fear of my girlfriend leaving me before, and I know nothing like that would happen. So I just can't wrap my mind around what this dream is trying to tell me.  ------------  Current Mood : groggy - Just woke up  Current Song :

      Well today started off alright, I went up to my Grandma's house and mowed her huge lawn. Earned myself $50 for it, which I  should  put in the bank but I'll prolly just blow it on something useless. After the lawn was all done, I got dropped off at my girlfriend's house. Spent the rest of the day just hanging out there, and then finally I came home. Sounds like a fine day from the outside, but of course there are always two sides to every story.  I just can't get over this internal conflict I am battling. To quote Usher from Burn:     I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh) I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)     It just seems like whenever my girlfriend and I are together, all we seem to do "fool around". If I have something I want to talk about, I forget it when I'm with her or if she is the one wanting to do the talking then I distract her until she forgets. I don't know what has happened, but we don't talk as often as we use to and sometimes we go several days without seeing each other. And then when we do talk, we can't seem to get through one phone call without having at least one disagreement/spat that leaves at least one of us pissed off until we talk again and everything is better. Of course we both know it isn't better, cause nothing has changed, but we just seem to ignore that and continue on. I just don't know how much more I can take. I love my girlfriend so much, and no matter what happens I will always love her, but I just don't know how much more I can take. We've tried talking about things in the past, but nothing ever changes.  To make things all the more difficult, there is this girl who I can't get out of my head (Not an actual girl mind you, just the idea of a different woman). I've hurt Rachel before, and I will  NEVER  do that to another woman again. But it just tears me apart inside to have all these conflicting emotions. I just feel like I want to break down and cry sometimes, but of course not only will that not help anything but I can never seem to just let go. Tomorrow I might sit down and have a talk with Rachel about a lot of things. I think I would still like to try and fix our relationship...I just don't know anymore. Tomorrow is going to be so crappy...     ------------  Current Mood : Confused  Current Song :  urlLink Usher - You Make Me Wanna  &amp;  urlLink Usher - Burn  (Both on repeat one after another)

      Well it seems I pissed off one of my friends, but a part of me just doesn't care. His lack of care about others has me acting rather childish. :-/    We got in a fight over the defination of a "hacker" after he implyed I was stupid and should look up what a hacker really is. This is all following after I reported a documentary that I said he should watch that claimed it was about "the Aussie hackers who started it all". I won't go into the details, but he "stormed off" after I refused to answer the phone when he called. Largly because I didn't want to pick up and fight with him, nor did I want to pick up and say something stupid I might regret later while I was still upset at him.    Of course this all stems back to when he called my friend a bitch last Tuesday. And regardless of how clearly upset she was, he never once said anything close to sorry. I am just a bit tired of his seeming lack of regard for others sometimes. I swear though cause he gets upset at me if I offhandedly shoot off some smart ass comment that hurts his feelings or he kind of appoligizes when I let him know he said something to upset me, while at the same time he calls my friend a bitch and upsets her without thinking another thought about it.  ------------  Current Mood : Annoyed  Current Song : Usher - That's What It's Made For

      Today was just a blast. I hung out with my friend Tiff, her boyfriend Brandon, and Tiff's friend Lisa. Anyway, we went down to Clackamas Town Center & after that we walked over to the Clackamas Pramnade and wondered through there for awhile. After we were all broke, well Tiff had all the money to begin with :-D, we headed back to Tiff's house and dropped her loot off.     Once Tiff was done with that, we headed to some park that had a cool fountain thingy. Tiff &amp; Brandon played around in it. I should have joined them, but for some reason I was feeling a bit shy. Don't know why, but meh. Next time for you :-) When they were done having fun in the water, we all hung out in the shade for awhile just chatting about random things. Tiff is so cool, I'm sure what it is but I just feel so comfortable around her & she is such a great friend.    Anyway, I hope we can hang out again sometime soon cause today was just great. Perhaps I'll invite Tiff &amp;amp; Brandon to double date with my girlfriend & me. ;-)    *edit* I've been informed Tiff's friend was actually named Lisa, lol. Man I suck at names. :-P  ------------  Current Mood : Joyful  Current Song : D12 - Ain't Nuttin But Music

      *yawn* Boy did today feel long.    First I got up earlier then I think I've gotten up all summer, 9:00! 0_0 And then got myself together and walked up to Hawthorne. When I got up there, around 10:30 I realized the most of Hawthorne opens around 11, heh. So I just hung around up there for awhile, and then went 11 rolled around I made my way down to Metro. At Metro I got my hair dye, which was the  extact  color I wanted but it still looked good. So then I came on back home.    After being home for like 5 mins, I get a phone call from my girlfriend. She wanted me to come over to her place, and then go to a concert in the park later in the evening. So I pulled myself together and hoofed it down to the bus. At her house we just hung out and stuff until it was time for the concert.    The concert was really nice, it was my girlfriend's piano teacher's band playing and then some other lady who I clearly was suppose to have heard of. lol    Now I have to get up before noon tomorrow to hang out with my friends. Arg, not sure I've done that all summer :-D Ah well, it is going to be great fun. I might even do my hair dying tomorrow too. And of course to top all this off, I start drivers ed next monday. So if you can't tell yet, by how often I mention it, I am only a touch nervous. I know I will do fine and all, but I still worry. I haven't driven as much as I would have liked to, and I am hoping to get in at least a few hours of driving in traffic before monday. *crosses fingers* Here's hoping!    Oh yea tomorrow, well later today I suppose, they are annoucing the artists for Z100's Last Chance Summer Dance. It is suppose to be  really  huge this year since it is the 20th anniversary of the event. Assuming the artists don't all suck, then Tiff and a few other friends will prolly be heading down.  ------------  Current Mood :  Zzz...  Current Song : Alanis Morrisette - Ironic

      Well D&D went over alright. I took like 5 hours to get started, but once things got going I think everyone had a great time. We had pizza again since everyone just loves my dad's pizza it seems.    The whole game pretty much broke down around 7 or so and then people started heading home. So while everyone was waiting for their rides to show up, the gang hung out in my room and just talked about random stuff. Then finally everyone was gone, and I just laid back and relaxed. :-)    Of course the day couldn't go by without a single hitch. Awhile after everyone was gone, one of my friends called me to "discuss" something. He was upset because he hung out for about an hour waiting for a ride home, but then he found out that my other friends ride wasn't getting to my place until 9pm. So he decided to take the bus home. Anyway, the short version is that he was upset because I had failed to communicate with him what time my friend's ride was showing up &amp; if I had told him "I was going to flirt with her for that long" (His words, not mine) then he would have left like an hour before he did. I just couldn't believe he had the nerve to say that. Sometime that guy really gets on my nerves. But then the next time he is cool, and fun to hang with. *shrug* Whatever, heh. He was around while they were talking about it, and not once did he ask me if we could go. But it isn't like I owed him a favor over my  other friends either, since he had called one of my friends a bitch (Jokingly to him, but she didn't feel that way and it really pissed her off. She told him that, but he never once said sorry).    But meh, I got bigger things to worry about such as Drivers ED sneaking up on me. I need to get out and do some  serious  driving. I've been driving maybe an hour, and I would like to be comforable with driving in at least light traffic before the class begins. So I'll just have to see. Oh, and I am also excited cause I am planning to go buy my hair dye tomorrow. I hope that I can find the color I want.    I've also got plans for Thursday with my friend's girlfriend & her friends. We are going to go see "I, Robot" which looks like a really cool film. That should be a lot of fun, and I hope to hang out with them more. I always enjoyed the few conversations Tiff (My friend's girlfriend) and I shared in Eco last year, and it just makes me really happy to be becoming closer friends with her.  ------------  Current Mood : Tired &amp; Happy    Current Song : Jay-Z - Izzo

      Well today I am holding the 2nd weekly dungeons & dragons session that my friends are playing. No, I'm not the DM but just another player. *sigh* Sometimes I don't know why I do these things though.  Sometimes I just want to go hang with the guys instead of being with my girlfriend 24/7, but then I do get out to hang with them and I find myself wishing I could just get away from them. It isn't that they are bad people or anything, it is just that if I hang with them for more then a day I just want to get away. I don't even know if I want to host a following session after this, but I might not have to worry about it since I will be starting Drivers ED soon.    Of course that means I need to get some   serious   driving in. I would really like to be comfortable with street driving before I go to the class, that way I can drive myself there everyday. Plus I am looking forward to getting my license so that I can expand my job hunting to outside of jobs on bus routes ;-)    Lately I've been talking a lot with my friend's girlfriend. She was in my ecology class last year, and even though we talked a little bit there, we never really had any real conversations. We have a lot in common. Everything from music, reading, poetry and she has got me expanding my horizons on a couple things. Even though we haven't been talking very long, she is just so easy to talk to and I feel I could tell her anything. I hope we can stay friends for a long time cause even for the short time we've been talking I just get that friendly vibe, like we've been friends forever already, that I never want to let go of. She has invited me to hang out with her & some friends on Thursday, so we'll see how that goes. I am expecting to have a lot of fun :-)    Hmm, maybe I should go to sleep now...I feel asleep around 11pm yesterday &amp; then woke up about 2am today. I tried laying down and even reading, but about about an hour of that I just got up and figured whatever. *yawn* Maybe I'll just crash early tonight.  ------------  Current Mood : Tired  Current Song : Eazy-E - Nobody Move

      Well today was a nice day. I just hung around the house, and when my girlfriend came over we just relaxed and watched the Season 1 Futurama DVD :D    I realized that if I don't start driving a whole bunch soon, then when I start Drivers ED on Aug. 2nd I will be walking into class without knowing jack. So, I gotta fix that quick. Tomorrow is Dungeons & Dragons though, so we'll see how that goes over. I don't have a good feeling about it, but *shrug* Just have to wait and see.    One of my friends, you know who you are ;-), has recently gotten me to DL a whole bunch of rap music. hehe So I have been listening to that, and as much as I would rather not admit it...I am enjoying the majority of it. *grin*    Another cool thing that happened today was that I talked ot my parents about getting a new kitten, from my rap friend :D. They said they would think about it, and mostly just wanted to go look at them. My girlfriend really wants us to get a female calico, she wants it but her mom said no, and my mom feels the same way...but she says she might like an all white kitten too. Well no matter what is it Mom's turn to pick the kitty, but she sounded pretty into getting one from my friend. :)    Hmm, least I guess is that fact that I am going to dye my hair! lol I've never done it before, and I want to try the color out before school starts. But if I like it, then I plan to re-dye it for school. I  want  to dye it so that without light it looks black, but when the light hits it then it shines blue. So basically a  really  dark blue, I call the color Midnight blue. When I get it done, I'll post up some pics. hehe   ------------  Current Mood : Happy  Current Song : Boy Hits Car - Lovefurypassionenergy

      Well my girlfriend came over shortly after I posted the last entry, and we made up and all that business. Of course, this whole mess is bound to arise again because we never seem to fix the problem or even identify it. *sigh* Maybe it is time I took some initiative and changed some things in this relationship...

      My girlfriend and I are fighting...again. We've just been fighting more and more lately it seems. Of course it really isn't her vs. me in these fights...no, no, no. It is her picking my flaws apart, it is her asking me how I cannot care about my future, it is her tossing in emotional digs where ever possible even when they don't relate. *sigh*     She has been worried about my lack of concern for the future for a long time. I don't have a job, I don't have my license (Had my permit 1 & a half before I drove even once), my grade point average isn't good enough to get into even a state school, I bombed my SATs...The list goes on, and she questions how I can just live my life without any concern for these things. She tells me I don't understand, or that I don't get it. But oh I get it, I understand better then she knows. How can she honestly believe I'm not worried about the fact I cannot get into a state college, that I don't have a job, or that I don't have any money saved up in the bank. She pulls the high grades, she gets  buckets  of college information packets in the mail, she has 4+ bank accounts each with over $1,000 in them. The only college info I have gotten is stuff I have requested, and the military. -_-'     Man, I fucking hate the way things are. Do I want to change? Of course. Will it happen? Not right now. I'm sorry, but I am still a kid and damnit I am afraid. I can say it, I am afraid of growing up. I have to look toward  college  in just over a year and I am not ready. I don't want to deal with the real word, I don't want those responsibilities yet. All around me I see people my age behaving just like me, and it isn't like I am unhappy with the way my life is going. Honestly, I am really happy with it. But when that fight starts up, and she slams me face first into my future...All that happens is I become a little more scared of it, and a little less willing to grow up.

      Well today started with a positive outlook. I was going to join my girlfriend and her family on a day trip out to the coast. The weather was suppose to be great, and everyone was in a good mood. So we loaded up the car and took off at the ungodly hour of 8:30 in the morning. But it was alright cause I had brought a book,  The Da Vinci Code , and I could of course just sleep some of the ride. Doing just that, reading & sleeping, we eventually got to the coast. And anyway, to make long day short we spent the day at the Newport Aquarium and some time on the actually beach. Then we headed on home. About halfway home I knew trouble was brewing.  Now I thought the day had gone really well, but it seems I was wrong once more. After we got back to my girlfriend's house and I got my stuff together to hop on the bus and head home, I knew something was wrong. I went to hug &amp; kiss my girlfriend goodbye for the day, and she just kind of gave me a quick little peck on the cheek. So a bit confused, seeing as I thought the day was great, I headed on home after asking her to call me later.  So then midnight rolls around, and the phone rings. It's her. I pick it up, we talk for a little while about how our evening have been and all. But I can still tell, but the tone and inflection of her voice, that someone was wrong. I ask her flat out, and she just tells me the generic "nothing". Well that clearly wasn't true, so I continue to try and find out what I did that day to upset her or what had gone wrong or just  whatever .  Turns out, surprise surprise, it was me. She was upset cause I had looked scruffy and my clothes looked bad when meeting her Aunt. Now I will tell you flat out, I don't care what "image" my clothing gives off because if you judge me on that alone then you either don't know me and therefor I don't care or you do know me and you're stupid. Why should you be judging me on anything other then my personality? So anyway, we argued and fought for quite some time over various things from my T-Shirts being offensive to her to the fact that I don't know how to buy clothes that fit. Each insult feeling like a dig for dig sake, and not for pointing out something that needs to change.  It makes me sad to say it, but I don't think my girlfriend and I have much longer left together. All we do lately is fight, and neither of us can seem to make that stop. Whenever I think we had a good day together, I find out later I did something unknowingly to upset her. *sigh* I just really don't know how much longer I can do this. Things are going south fast, and I don't honestly expect us to be together when school starts.  I still love her. I will always love her.  ------------  Current Mood : Depressed  Current Song : Hoobastank - What Happened To Us

      Wow today was full. I spent my morning in the classroom at Drivers Ed sitting though a nice & gory Trama nurse presention. Only to be released for my driving, which happened to be freeway today. So basically I was queasy, and scared shitless of merging onto the freeway since it was almost my first time (I merged on and off a basically empty freeway yesterday with my dad for some practice). But my instructor said I did a great job, and I gratuated the "Behind the Wheel" portion of Drivers Ed. Go me! hehe  Soon as I got home from Drivers Ed, I already had my a couple of my buddies over for our Dungeons &amp; Dragons session today. So once everyone got over, we had a great time with that. Played for a good 4 hours or so and made our way out of one dungeon so we could get to town. From there, we wrapped up to have dinner and then busted out Karaoke Revolution on the PS2 and everyone took a turn killing a song. Well everyone except my sister, and my friend Jessy. They both were really good, which of course just continues to prove a theory my friends have that almost all women can sing better then basically any guy.  Oh, and I have also picked up my    EverQuest addiction  again. -_-' Yes, I know devil spawn and all that mess. But hey, the more hours I put in the sooner the urge to play will burn out right? lol Well all I know for sure is that once school starts I am only playing if I can't find any friends to hang with and my homework is done. Not going to let it screw me up like I did freshmen year, heh.  Well I am dead tired after today, so I am going to go read some and try to stay awake. *yawn* Waiting for my girlfriend to call me back, she is still at soccer practice. Hope I can stay awake.  ------------  Current Mood : Zzz...  Current Song : No Doubt - Don't Speak

      Well today was really cool. My girlfriend came over after she did some shopping, and we hung out fo awhile and then we took the bus up to her house so we could go to the Portland Timbers soccer game with them. The game was great, we scored in the first half on a penelty kick & then they scored early during the second half. But we, after  several  really close attempts kicked in a goal with like 9 seconds left on the clock.  Today was just really great all around. My girlfriend and I got along today, didn't have a single fight, we were happy and life way good. :-) Lets hope things keep going in this direction.  ------------  Current Mood : Relaxed  Current Song : Maroon 5 - Harder To Breath

      Well Drivers Ed is going fine, dispite this lovely heat *groan*. But this weekend is do or die time for me. I have to get in  A LOT  of driving practice. On Monday I am suppose to do my freeway driving, so I am only a little nervous. My driving teacher thinks I'll do great if I get some solid driving practice at changing lanes &amp; if possible to try merging onto and off of the freeway. So yea, I'm nervous. But I suppose I'll just have to suck it up and pull through, cause if I don't then I will be coming back to Drivers Ed in late September and that just won't be happening.  I just found out my friend Julia wants to take me out school clothes shopping. In her words she wants me to be her, "dressup barbie dol". lol So when I asked her what sort of clothes she was thinking of looking at, she told me "a little flammy" So yea, now I am a bit scared. heh But I don't even know if I will be going. I know she wants to, but I'm not sure if I can pull some cash together or my girlfriend would want me to go. She has been feeling a bit jelious of me hanging with my friends lately cause I am always out having fun and she seems to always be working. Of course she will be out of town at some wedding this weekend, so who knows. Oh, I might also be dying my hair this weekend too. I am going to use a color called "Blue Black", it looks good on the box but we'll just have to see. I am prolly going to do a sample strand tonight just so I can get an idea what the color will look like.  This evening I am suppose to be going to a soccer game with my girlfriend, so that should be fun. I don't really follow soccer, or know all the rules but I do enjoy watching it with her. She also wants me to dye my hair this weekend just so I can get it done with and figure out if I like it or not.  Well I got Drivers Ed homework to get to before the soccer game tonight, so I'll end this here. But later this evening, after I get back from the soccer game, I'll ramble on some more. heh  ------------  Current Mood : Rundown  Current Song : Ludacris ft. Shawna - What's Your Fantasy

      *pant, pant* Alright, so my AC dies just before a nice healthy heatwave strikes town and so now I am just sweating buckets. yay! Ah well, means less sleep and more time wasted on the computer.  Of course to try and beat the heat some I went out and spent the afternoon hanging out with my friend Tiff, her boyfriend, and Tiff's friend Julia. It was a great time. We went to Baskin Robins for ice cream, and then stopped by Safeway for iced drinks, then spent the rest of the afternoon wondering through the park. Was a nice escape from the heat of my room, that is for sure. Sadly I only had jeans to wear, so I was dying without shorts. But I had a good time anyway. :-)  ------------  Current Mood : Happy  Current Song : H.I.M. - When Love And Death Embrace

      And almost never men. -.-  I spent this last weekend at a LAN party with a bunch of my friends. It was fun and all, don't get me wrong, but one of my friends tend to be a bit of a jackass at times. He never did anything over the line, but he did scream at me without much of a reason a couple times &amp; even when he attempted an appoligy he managed to end it by yelling at me again. I'm not quite sure why we are friends sometimes, but then a little while later we are getting along again and he has forgotten all about whatever happened before. The rest of the guys are the party were cool, and I would hang with them any time but it is just this one guy that I can't stand much after a long period of time together. Ah well, he is still my friend and I know we will continue to be friends. Friendships can be crazy sometimes I guess...  Also I think my girlfriend and I are doing better, of course since I am taking Drivers Ed and her life is pretty busy too it is making it hard for us to see each other. I end up with plans for one weekend, and then she has plans for the next too. *sigh* I just want to see her, but our lives just can't seem to click lately. :-/  But at least I have a super cute kitten to keep my mind off my problems. My mom has decided to name her Pi, after Piwacket or something who is some cat in a movie. I am still calling her Star, which is what my friend who gave her to us called her. I think Pi is just a crazy name for a cat, but I can't really say anything to her about it cause well it is her cat. Ah well, she will always be star to me. Oh, and soon as I can find the stupid cord to plug my camera into the computer then I will post up some cute pictures of the kitten!  ------------  Current Mood : Tried, but not sleepy (Shouldn't have taken that 4 hour nap earlier :-D)  Current Song : Tupac ft.

      Today we got a kitten from my friend, and she is SOOO cute :-D She has the sweetest little mew, and is so curious. I just love her. Our other cats are upset by the little addition, but they will get over it. hehe I'll post up a picture once I get one taken.  Oh, and I am driving on fairly busy streets now so that is really cool. I drove along Gleson in Drivers Ed today, and did some driving on Powell yesterday on my own time. It is so cool to think that I am going to be driving on my own sooner then I can imagine. Kind of scary too, heh.  Things with my girlfriend have been really touch and go lately too. We both still love each other, but we are just beginning to work things out I think. So I hope this is finally a step in the right direction.  ------------  Current Mood : Joyful  Current Song : Usher - Superstar

      Well it has been a couple days since I last made an entry here, and that is cause following Drivers Ed everyday I have just been so dead tired. This getting up at 6 stuff is going to kill me, I swear. *sigh* lol  Anyway, I am doing really well in Drivers Ed and my driving teacher has been really impressed with the development of my skills. I did some light traffic driving yesterday, and today I am going to do some more with my mom. I'm not doing too bad in the simulator either, even though it is a bit crazy.  Oh yea, I am also prolly getting a kitten from my friend! I saw it awhile ago, and it is just SOOO cute :). hehe I can't wait to bring her home.  ------------  Current Mood : Happy, but tired *yawn*  Current Song :

      The big day finally arrived, and it wasn't that bad. I got the good schedule, which means I have classroom learning from 8am until about 10:30. Then I drive from 10:30 to 11:30, and from 11:30 to 12:30 I am in the simulator.  Our classroom teachers reminds me of a little puffer fish, with tiny fins. LOL And my driving teacher is pretty cool too. I got partnered up with some guy who had basically never driven before, so he was scared shitless of driving around this huge cop car (Oh yea, our Drivers Ed cars are ex-Police cars. It is pretty cool, and they are  really  powerful.). We practiced driving straight today, gah it was so boring. We never touched the gas pedal, and just rolled around this parking lot for an hour. The simulator was kind of cool, just like a video game. Basically there is a movie you watch, and follow along in your little "car". Lights come on if you screw up or something, and then you lose points. In all the areas of Drivers Ed I have to get 75% or higher to pass, and I must pass everything. But other then the getting up at friggin' 6 in the morning, which is going to kill me I swear, I feel pretty good about Drivers Ed.  In other news, I got my ticket for  urlLink Last Chance Summer Dance.  So I know I am going to that, which is cool cause I always like to get in at least one concert every summer. I'll be going with a couple friends, and it seems like I am buying everyones ticket. lol I don't mind, but I hope I can swing the money. With everyone paying me back it shouldn't be a big deal at all though, but I do have to remember to stop by the bank later. *makes mental note, think better of it and puts on a sticky note next to the monitor* hehe ------------  Current Mood : Dead x_x - Need sleep, lol  Current Song : Tommy Tutone - Jenny (867-5309) *grooves*

      Wow my friends are  CRAZY . But anyway I am going to just leave that alone and say; Dude, you don't need to fight with every offhand comment I say. I mean jesus, sometimes a comment is just that a comment and not an offer to debate for 45mins. lol  Anyway, I had a good day today. My mom and I went out driving for awhile, and she took me over to this big parking lot at her work. I got a chance to practice parking there, which was nice. Also I managed not to hit anything, which is always a plus. So I start Drivers Ed today, I have to get up at 6...ugh. I'm not sure I've been up at 6 all friggin' summer, but ah well. I feel much more comfident in my driving after today too. I have yet to drive with traffic yet though, so I am going to have to work on that big time.  Ok, well a short entry for today since I gotta get up bright and way too early. Hopefully I will know someone else in Drivers ED, and it wouldn't someone I can't stand. lol  ------------  Current Mood : Cheerful  Current Song : Def Leppard - Pour Some Sugar On Me
