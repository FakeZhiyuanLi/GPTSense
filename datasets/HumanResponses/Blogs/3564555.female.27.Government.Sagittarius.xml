      it's 2.45 pm and i'm still in my office .... just finished amending the SOR .... phew!! at last!!  have to get it done by today cos they need it for monday's meeting ... argghhh!! i hate meetings ... think i'll get aishah n carol (a colleague of mine) to "save" me again hehehe ... the last meeting i attended ... they did the same ... was quite a drama ... those 2 gals are fantastic ... all the stupid reasons (or should i say "lies"?) we could come up with, u'd be suprised i tell ya hehehe ... btw our boss named us the "wolfpack clan" ... dun really know why though ... aiyah ... wateva it means ... i care less ... hehehe too lazy to care ... and too young to die (eerr eerr  ... think i betta retract the last one)....   was listening to an old song "Honesty" by Billy Joel ... (i know u all gonna laugh .. yeah yeah ... i luv oldies ... so??!! wat's ur problem?? hehehe) alrite .. back to the song ... the thing that struck me the most was the lyrics especially the chorus ...    honesty is such a lonely word everyone is so untrue honesty is hardly ever heard and mostly what I need from you   everyone knows that being honest is definitely easier than lying ... reason being, if u lie to someone, u have to remember all the details that u said to tat person ... more often than not ... we tend to forget abt it and  the next thing we realised ... we're in hot soup!! it's easier to recall something that did happen than something that didn't, rite?? if tat's the case, why do we still prefer fibbing?? ironic isn't it?? i, myself lie most of the time ... honest!!  to my parents ... friends ... and most of all, my beloved boss, katek hehehe ... do u think i pride myself for doing all that?? definitely not!!  that being the case, why did i lie then??  why do pple lie when it's something tat we're not proud of?? to get ourselves off the hook?? dun wanna hurt others?? to get attention?? we could come up with so many reasons as to why we lie ... but would it help to erase the guilt in us?? ..... it's true that at times we have to lie to avoid hurting others ... but are our actions justifiable??  hhmmm ... very subjective ain't it??  i really dunno .... but one thing i know, .... as much as i hate to lie ... i'll continue lying as and when the need arises ... hehehe

      yo!! suprise ... suprise ... it's 8.15am and i'm in my office liao ... ahakz ... too bad katek's not here ... still enjoying himself in Japan, i guess ... he'd be jumping up & down seeing me in the office at this hour .. hehe .. btw, katek (shorty) is actually my dear boss ... u guys don't have to ask why i gave him tat nick name lah hor ... hehehe  nearly hit a van just now ... it's my fault lah ... after fetching aishah at the bus stop infront of McD ... i just drove straight ahead .... without realising the lane i was occupying was actually a bus lane ... the moment i realised it .. i made an abrupt lane change ... didn't realised that my car was really really close to a van ... luckily the driver was quick enough to react ... or else ... sure KABOOMMMM!!  didn't dare to look at the driver right after that (who knows rite ... skali the magic finger come out hehehe)...   before proceeding to the parking lot, i stopped the car next to the "security booth" for security checks    ... thought the CISCO guys just wanna checked the car ... skali we're told to come out of the car ... very embarassing ... and quite puzzled actually .. why didn't the driver before us ordered to do likewise? was it my tudung? did we look like potential terrorists?  hhmm ... maybe i'm just being too hard on them ... probably they're just doing random checks on staff entering the building and "suwey2" both of us "kena" ... i saw a couple of cars behind us ... waiting impatiently ... aiyah .. who cares!! not our fault wat ...   parked the car at this particular lot marked "Head Licensing" in bold somemore (it's actually katek's lot lah) hehehe .. wat the heck!! he's out of town mah ... i didn't wanna park at the multi-storey carpark near Everton cos it's too far and ex too .. hopefully no "kaypohs" ard .. or else i'll be dead man!!  didn't catch the 2 euro matches this morning .... was extremely tired yesterday ... ok .. it's time to start working ... continue later ...

      time check 10.30 am ... just stepped into the office ... managed to catch some sleep at abt 5.00 am (right after the germany and holland match) ... my body's aching ... let me do some stretching first ....  talking abt the match early this morning ... it ended in a draw ... was hoping for the germans to win ... but anyhow i'm still happy with the results ... the germans played well ...  as for the dutch ... they didn't rise to the occasion ...despite having a "star-studded" team ... all the hypes abt holland being one of the favourites to win the cup are all bullshits ... hehe not that i've something against the dutch ... i just hated the way they played ... most of their passes went off target ... luckily they brought in overmars, who orchestrated some of the attacks after the second half ...   next to brazil, germany is also one of my favourite soccer team ... esp the team that won the world cup in 1990 ... i cld still remember ... brehme scored thru a free kick ... i was still in school at that time ... was infatuated with klinsmann ... voeller was playing as a winger (if i'm not wrong lah) and lothar matthaus (or matthaeus) was the captain ... i also love germany's jerseys/ sweaters .... love the sweater they wore yesterday ... the one in grey, long-sleeved ... i bet it's really expensive ... hhmm couldn't afford to buy one rite now ... maybe i've wait till july ... bonus mah ...   ok, enough said abt the germany soccer team ... back to the real world ... i've like piles and piles of paperwork to do ... been procrastinating since last week ... by hook or by crook .. have to get it done latest by tomorrow ... so ida ... pls psyche urself ... no games ... no soccer ... no gawking at guys in uniform ... it's time to work ... work ... work ...

      just came back from harbourfront with aishah ..... the weather is extremely hot .....  wish I hadn't go out in the first place .... if it continues to be like this, I’ll get myself the newly invented air-conditioned shirt .... then I wouldn’t get all sweaty and sticky .... eeiii yucks ....   my eyes are feeling really heavy rite now ... feel like taking a nap in the restroom .... didn't get much sleep yesternite ... caught the 2 euro matches ... italy vs denmark & bulgaria vs sweden  .... the first match was not that exciting .... if not for nesta, buffon and company .. i would’ve fallen asleep ehehehe ... their deep-set eyes, flowing locks and sexy bums *drools*  yummy yum ... even if they’d given out 10 penalties to the danes, i’d still forgive them hehehehe ... the entire team's full of hunks ... (except for gattuso .. too hairy for me .... splitting image of chewbacca hehe) ....hhmmm perhaps being REALLY DROP-DEAD GOOD LOOKING is one of the pre-requisite to be in the Italian team …. my all-time favourite azzurians wld be maldini, nesta & inzaghi .... can’t wait for their next match man!! the second match was not too bad either .... not too bad in this context refers to the player’s looks lah hehehe ..... larsson reminded me of keanu reeves .. but he’s the darker version of reeves lor ... then there’s this bulgarian player who looks like richard gere .... and one of his team-mates who looks like jude nelson .... slightly better looking than jude nelson, i’d say .... have problems remembering their names tho’ .... too many “tovs” & “kovs” hehehe   this much for now … au revoir …

      reached office at 9.45 am ...  a colleague of mine greeted me "gd afternoon" the moment she saw me at the door ... hehehe .. i think the whole office had given up on me a long long time ago ... hehehe well, wat the heck rite ... tardiness has been my "forte" all this while ...   the office is exceptionally quiet today ... maybe because Aishah's not ard ... hehehe ... i'm not saying she's the most talkative one ... it's just that ... she's normally the first one to start the ball rolling ...   need to go to the bank to withdraw money and update my bank book ... talk to you again later ... adios ..

      at last, manage to find time to pen something in here .... it's been 4 days since i last did my entries ... the past few days had been quite hectic .... thought life in the office wld be much easier when my boss is not ard ... but it turned out to be otherwise *sighs* ...   yahooo!! tomorrow is pay day ... wat a relief .... i'm left with only $10 in my pocket.. but then again, can't do much with my pay for this month ... need to settle my debts (mom, credit cards, hp bills etc) ... so sian ..  i'll be meeting yati at 1.30 pm tomorrow ... and right after that, to Pekan Nenas, JB ... my uncle and aunt will be waiting for us (as in my family and I) down there ... gonna bring back some durians to Singapore .... hopefully there'll be no jam at the checkpoint...   had a nightmare two nights ago ... i was being stepped on by a hantu .... eeeiiii quite scary ... and tiring too cos in that dream i recited a couple of "doas" continuously from night till morning hehehe ... next time must remember to take wudhu before i go to sleep ..   think that's all for now ... nothing much to write abt ... actually there are plenty to talk abt ... but i think it's better to skip it .. or else i'll get stressed up .... think abt it tomorrow then hehehe .... tata ....

      feel like dozing off rite now ... slept at 4 this morning ... no regrets tho' .. my sisters and i spent the whole night watching csi ... hehehe really nuts!! this csi-thon thingy had been going on for the past few weeks ... really luv the show ... finished watching part 1 of season 1 ... the one i borrowed from azmin few weeks back ... went to sembawang music store with ayu last thursday to get the season 2 dvds without realising there's actually a part 2 of season 1 ... bought it at $49.90 ... it's a gd bargain, i think ... cos the one ayu bought for azmin was ard $80 plus ... but tat's in code 4(dun ask me wat's code 4 .. cos i myself dunno ... hehehe).. we watched the newly bought dvds till friday morning ... was too tired to go to work so i took urgent leave hehehe .... and yesterday .. yati found part 2 of season 1 and part 2 of season 2 at gramophone ... i told her to get it ... so yesterday nite .. we started our csi-thon back again hehe ..... couldn't believe we spent hundreds of dollars on csi dvds ... really siow!!  but then again ... the show's worth the money .. hehe ... like wat ayu said ... i quote "i've nothing to lose other than money" ...   btw, last thursday .. while browsing the dvds at sembawang music store ... both ayu and i heard this song ... it's really catchy .. didn't know who's the singer at first ... then ayu got hold of the cd cover and told me the song's from keane, a british band .. tot of buying the cd .. but decided not to .. how to .. no money mah hehehe ... i decided to download the song instead ... (yeah, i'm a freeloader n a pirate ... any problem with that? hehehe) the song kinda stuck with me now ... really like it a lot ... downloaded another song from keane which is equally nice ... told yati to drop by gramophone later this evening and get me the cd .. hhmmm gonna start fasting from now on ... no money liao .. worst come to worst ... i'll burn (literally) the cds n dvds n have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner .. hehehehe   everybody's changing - keane  you say you wander your own land but when i think about it i don't see how you can  you're aching, you're breaking and i can see the pain in your eyes says everybody's changing and i don't know why  so little time try to udnerstand that i'm trying to make a move just to stay in the game i try to stay awake and remember my name but everybody's changing and i don't feel the same  you're gone from here soon you will disappear fading into beautiful light cos everybody's changing and i don't feel right  so little time try to udnerstand that i'm trying to make a move just to stay in the game i try to stay awake and remember my name but everybody's changing and i don't feel the same

      hi y'all ... ms tardy's back ... for good, i hope .. hehehe .. been missing for a couple of weeks ... reason?   (1)busy with work?? nah not really ...  (2)pc down?? aayy nope!!  (3)running out of ideas?? hhmmm yeah kinda ...  (4)lazy? i'd say so .. hehehe  in actual fact ... i just cldn't be bothered ... it's too much of a hassle to figure out wat to write ... well, other than the Euro Cup, there's practically nothing to write abt ... if u ask me wat i'm thinking rite now ... i'd say ... nothing .... none ... kosong ... zilch!!  except for the thought of having to complete this entry before 1730 hours ... ida!! u're such a bore!!   yup ... i'm boring ... and am bored myself ... everything's dull, mundane, routine, monotonous and wat-else-have-you .. perhaps it's just me ... in a state of oblivion ... don't really know how to describe it in the exact words ... i feel nothing .... i think nothing ... i'm numbed .... and it's really freaking me out ... maybe it's ok not to think nothing (well, most airheads/ bimbos do that and cld get away with it, rite? why not me?? hehehe) but to feel nothing? is it possible in the first place?? am i exaggerating this nothingness thingy?? u think i'm weird rite? no worries, i think so too ... hehehe  alrite ... before i scare u guys even further .. let's move on to euro Cup ... one word to describe it ... "NOTHING" ... hehehe relax lah .. well, it's actually something till the czechs lost to the greeks ... then it became "NOTHING" ... there's a saying which says "the winner takes it all" ... it's true .. really true ... though i'm no nedved, poborsky, rosicky and the likes ... but when the greeks won ... i could feel my heart sank .... like a titanic ... nah .. not really ... hehehe .... all the excitements vanished in a split second the moment tat greek fella (wateva his name is) headed the ball ... so i switched off the tv ... and stared blankly at the ceiling and felt "NOTHING" ... well, maybe i'm taking this "football" thingy a lil bit too far ... but tat's the only thing tat could help rid the feeling of nothingness in me ... even if it's just momentarily ... who cares ... at least i could be happy for a week ... a day ... an hour ... a sec .... unfortunately ... the czechs lost ... no point sulking ... feeling depressed ... even if i cry a river ... they're still the loser .... it's all pre-destined ... u cld only do your best ... the rest is up to HIM ...
