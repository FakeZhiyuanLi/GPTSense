      so it is amazing how oblivious you can be to something when you don't want to see it..... such as friends fading away from you when they find that certian someone that is that much more important than you. amazing, and disturbing how it will take someone else, who potentially could be super close to you if only given the chance, to point it out. fuck me.   p.s. so.... sweetie, i saw you tonight as well.... you said you were getting your drink on, so atleast i dont think you were with your girl...... straight edge health freak.... and youre home now. so do you ever see her? i am hopng you see more of me, and something tells me you do. mmmm so yeah.... and aaron and jeff from 38th parallel....i am super glad i "met" you guys...  now on: the doors: hello, i love you

      what a hard day...... will i ever make it through college? i feel i strive on stress.... on pressure. i am miserable at the time, yet i feel the most rewarded as successful when i pull through. this is bad, why? because i am sure that the stressed out folks of corporate america feel like this as well.. everyday. and what comes of it? money, which i clearly don't care about, and ulcers.   i swear, everday i have a new epiphany.... something that both opens my eyes and knocks me on my ass. this is amazing for my journey of self discovery and learning, but is hard on me, for i have so muh else i must focus my time and energy on. july is soon approaching. this is the last thanksgiving, christmas, easter i have with my family.......... the last year i have with "my people" here at home. i will have to establish an entire new life out there........ and that will be so hard. job? place? friends? boy? good god..................  p.s. not to fret. my fortune today says this: "someone from your past has returned to steal your heart." are you willing to take it? feels i am willing to give..... it was wonderful to spend time with you today, although we were not alone. maybe this will get our ball moving? all the intillectual/sexual maturity talk had me questioning things..... you accused our pal of having things going on with the girl friend.... saying his girl wouldnt dig. does your girl know? tell me how you feel. are you sneaking around? am i one of the guys? if he cant have a girl friend and hang out with her one on one, can you? are we pushing some boundary i was unaware of? i hope so. i saw you last night..... did you want me to? it was beautiful....... tight and silhouetted....and again after you left. i like what i see................  now on: the cure- just like heaven

      soo.... fuck. the more i should do something these days the less likely i am to actually do it. add this to the list of unhealthy patterns, will you? i am my motivations, i have my goals and aspirations, i have the work ethic, but never at the same time. and so it goes.  p.s. i wanted to get ahold of you late last night, but fought the urge, if you will. maybe tomorrow you can head out with me? hopefully we can talk... it gets a bit deeper everyday, don't you think? progression. what a bizarre history.... a long, strange trip, so they say......  now on: bob marley- redemption song

      "Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous. Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us, it is in everyone. And as we let our light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."  --Nelson Mandela, Inaugural Speech   .... wow  now on: jimmy eat world- authority song

      its scary when people you know discuss your life...... i dont know..... while i am totally ok with this, to a point, it is freaking my shit out. when one really really good friend accuses another good friend of knowing more about whats going on in my head it makes you wonder what you are telling whom at all times and who it is going to get back to. make sense? it concerns me that the person who does indeed know the most about my recent history is taking off soon-- for good.   thinking about it sends a very ulcer-like feeling through my body... that is NOT good...... i need to learn to not depend on peoples presence so much. it takes a lot for me to let someone in, and when they are there i expect it to be for the long haul. i dont want it to seem like i am a commitment freak, but i like structure. guarantees. if i invest time and energy into someone, share shit i otherwise wouldnt, learn to care about them, i want to know they will be around awhile. i guess in this case i knew they were leaving... but i had no intentions of developing the feelings inwhich i did, either.so it goes..... so it goes.    its 7:15 a fucking im sitting here thinking on this? course. seems its all i have done over the last few days. killing me softly. i ill haveto snap out of it soon though, i guess........  now on: wilco: what is war

      i need to locate the songs ellen and ben by dismemberment plan as well as zak and sara by ben folds. two very tragically great songs i have been digging on these days, yet not getting around to hooking myself up with. anyways thats right. i am sure i was going somewhere with this.... huum. anyway goddamn they are good songwriters. no eleanor rigby, nor in my life, yet great. ryan adams as well...... he says:   "I was the last fucking person in school who'd ever stand up in front of the school and say shit. Do you know what I mean? The last person you'd ever thought. For some fuckin' reason my agoraphobic, shy, freaked-out fuckin' personality drove me to make music and get up in front of people and say all this shit that I wouldn't normally say. It's sort of heartbreaking and sick because every night I get fuckin' nervous and throw up before I walk on stage. I get fuckin' scared that I'm gonna get laughed off the stage. Sometimes I think I oughta be."     hes a great guy. i also read a good matt skiba quote today.   "We are currently living in a place called hollywood. It's in california, which is a state on the west coast of the united states. The united states is a place that allows some of the most disgraceful people in history to buy their way into office and make decisions for millions and millions of people. " -- brilliant, matt skiba  anyways looks like i am rambling... thoughts are more like feelings today, and i cant seem to put them into words. i am going numb. i have a glazed feeling about me. it hurts to smile. everything feels tragic. some call it a funk, i call it reality. heres hoping things will change.   now on: smile: i make the dead

      while there is nothing i love more than music, no one i respect more than a hardworking musician giving up everything for what they love, major labels are indeed the major contributors- if not entire cause- of the downfall of the spread of creative thought and creation. its a travesty. in a talk given by ian mckaye last fall here last fall, he made a point in mentioning how music these days is much like bottled water.... music used to be something wonderful and pure, free for all... and it has been monopolized into tight little overpriced packages for pop culture to gobble right up. trends are not decided as they were in past history: good, pioneering music made my people who love what they do and bust their asses in doing it doesn't get anywhere without, for the most part, compromising all ideals and whoring themeselves out as puppets to put on a show for a given market.   although this is enough to make any real music lover nauseous, i still find myself wanting to work in the music industry. vagrant reinforced this.... (big, but indie, but not for long due to the sudden "successes" of a number of the bands on the roster.) while i see how wonderfully things are really run out there, i also saw what was going on with another unmentioned (major) label... and realized how lucky the 15ish bands on our one measly label were to have a label backing them that let them have creative control. listening to the hundreds of GREAT demos that would pour in made me, if nothing else, sad, knowing that all this talent was going nowhere. the noble labels can only do so much, and you are right, it is up to us. if i were even slightly interested in any financial gain, i surely have chosen the wrong profession, but i think this is a mission that will, if nothing else, make me feel good about my efforts at the end of the day.   wow.  p.s. things really have transpired, huh? funny how that happens, just as it is time to bid you farewell. ironic? no. there is no such thing as a chance occurance. it was supposed to happen this way. i am glad we got to share what we did, in the time we had though. i will remember it. (not that i am giving in so easily, merely accepting what the tides are bringing me. yup......)  now on: wilco: radio cure

      "Someone asked me why I loved you, and for the longest period, I never knew. Indeed, even now, perhaps I am still unaware why so.   I think I was once a poet. I was once able to ruminate long and short all at once upon the things that did not matter to me, things like being loved, having one's heart stolen and broken instantly. The real things that should have mattered never did in the end, that of absence, of impending presence. I was simply one leaf caught in the wrong wind." -- forgrativa

      yours for today: When you believe in romance, it could happen to you so easily. Make room in your life for someone who deserves to be part of it. Maybe you'll end up issuing a formal declaration, or maybe none will be necessary. Love finds its own level.       mine for today: Attractive strangers come together without saying a word. Old friends look at each other with new eyes, wondering about the possibilities. Things are changing in your life, and your heart is beating a bit faster.   you think?  anyways thank you for staying with me last night... sticking around an extra day to chill with me and talk..... and for coming over early and chilling. i will miss you. hopefully ill see you before may???  now on: beck: two turn tables and a microphone    ;)

      i quit letting people read shit like this a long time ago. consider yourself special.  so i dont know where this is coming from but after some thought this afternoon i had to get some shit out of my system. i realize that one of the last adjectives one would use to best describe my demeanor would be optimistic.... but after having a few people whos opinions i trust mention shit to me in passing, i feel (really) bad that others get frustrated at the fact i can be so goddamn cynical. right? not that i had not noticed the problem myself.   the idea that it could come up in conversation three times in two days is a problem.  i obviously dont want to be interpreted 'that way'. i am certainly happier when im not 'that way'... other people are happier when im not 'that way'.... and i would think most importantly people arnt afraid of saying something that they assume would set me off in those regards when im not thinking like that.   you cant have good (read as- halfway honest and meaningful) conversation if you have to censor what you say... and i think i sometimes make people feel like they have to do just that. ok that sucks because that exemplifies all i think is wrong with the world. thats the last thing i would want.... bullshit fucking follows me so when i have the opportunity to experience something genuine im on it.... i mean fuck, every conflict... ever, on any scale, can be traced to a breakdown in communication.   while there a trillion different stories as to what went wrong where and such, the core of the issue is the same nonetheless. things are easy when you can just talk to someone without barriers, and there are very few people (if any) your average person can indeed do that with. (well, maybe thats just me. i dont know, thats where i think im going with this.) its a sorry state of affairs really... i mean shit... things could not have always been like this, you know?  as many have noticed (or no one has noticed, one of the two)i cannot tolerate people who dont listen more than about anything. thinking about it, it all ties together, doesnt it? .......... ok i get exasperated at the fact that even the people closest to me dont 'listen' listen.... or really pay attention to what is going on in many regards....  anyway i have come to the conclusion that this is forming a horrid pattern. i talk on something important to someone i think is paying attention... which is a lot more uncommon than one would like to believe....and they end up being merely a nodding head whos not even looking at me let alone letting anything i say sink in before chanting "uh huh." .... i get frustrated.... and from there i do one of two things...   A i get a (non-intentional) cynical sarcasm chip on my shoulder (sadly it is quite common as well..)  or  B i shut off any kind of communication with said 'listener'   i must admit these are not ok ways to handle the situation, but it all boils down to me being totally jaded with people as an entire race. in no way is this intended to be any form of elitist behavior... it is merely a place my head goes... 'why doesnt anybody get me?' kinda place.....fucking sucks.   ok this should not be interpreted as me passing the buck, if you will, on a bad attitude i may have. i in no way proclaim to not be entirely responsible for what i do or say... or how i come off for that matter. of course i am aware of how i could be viewed on various occasions, everyone is on a subconscious level... but goddamn. there is surely a level where i can maintain my unhealthy 'so it goes' psychoanalytical thought process and really (truly) see how that kinda shit effects people besides myself.   i mean, i surely know how what i do effects people, but sometimes things fuck with my own head so much i dont realize to what degree it is effecting others... wow.. so yeah. having read this once long ago....'solitude: walking alone, doing things alone - is the most blessed thing in the world. the mind relaxes and thoughts begin to flow and I think that I am beginning to find myself a little.'   anyways the lady that said that.... humm... she is good. seems i have too many people in my life right now that are afraid of whats going on in their own heads. at the same time there are a few people ive come to know  who have their shit together, yet feel as if everything in their life is up in the air. i am sure they are not aware of this fact, in any regard, but goddamn. i wish they knew it.   i think maybe the people who are questioning their own stability are more emotionally grounded than anyone else.   of course it is unhealthy to be a recluse, but if you cant contentedly live with whats going on in your mind and accept it as ok regardless of how fucked up it may seem in comparison to others, you are a sad person, really.  regardless of how in control i am of how i think (not how i feel, thats a totally unrelated issue) thinking about it sends a very ulcer-like feeling.. that is not good...... although i dig solitude, now more than ever, i need to learn to not depend on peoples presence so much. that makes no sense, im sure. to sum it up, it takes a lot for me to let someone in, and when they are there i expect it to be for the long haul. that came out totally wrong. i dont want it to seem like i am a commitment freak. if nothing else i may have commitment issues. but i like structure. guarantees. if i invest time and energy into someone, share shit i otherwise wouldnt, learn to care about them, i want to know they will be around. if not physically, somehow. pretend to be halfway interested, if nothing else. when those people fade away-- or even digress and turn into people they at one point would have despised, its not ok. just let me say i dont think it is good when everything has a tragic feel about it. so it goes.

      if i have to be around these two couples for the next month straight.... who are both is this irritatingly patronizing hurtful competition-like state we call madly in lust ....relationships between me and these people may indeed be ruined for good. i shit you not. its been merely hours and i cant take it already. again with the near tears.... i see a sad pattern forming here.........  where are you? what are you up to? test tomorrow? we should chill tomorrow night. im going to miss you so so much...... ive never felt so strongly. i love you when im in good moods, bad moods, sad moods....... day and night..... ive never felt unconditional towards anyone before.... and there you are..... you appear and step from the woodwork years after i had met you, and present to me this wonderful person..... and now you must go.... maybe fate will have a way of working something out for us. or maybe it was not meant to be. we will see, sweetie... we will see. but whatever you do, for your sake, please do not fall into her trap. she is no good... she exemplifies all i despise in other women.... i am only thinking of you, and you know this. i do not like to see people i love with people that are not good for them. ;) i know who would be good for you... shes a nice girl..... single.... also a thinker........................  ....... um humm.......  now on: smile: freaky slow dance

      lame-o thoughts of today  your eyes, deep, thoughtful send a shiver down my spine what wonders to they speak of stories of wisdom, experiences of love teach me, share these stories of overcoming  your eyes, light, playful asking me to listen as you speak of doubt and pain an unspoken bond, understanding.. a connection words can do no justice i am here for you alone  your eyes, often growing darker your music is your lover encompassing your being, making you whole dont let the doubt enter your mind it is your lifeblood, it is your soul  when those you love question your strength remember me, i am here the black that once draped your life will remain forever away the power you control comes from you

      a letter.... to you know, him (har. girly? boo.)  .....hey dear so it has dawned on me these last few nights... you have to stick around in one form or another-- there are not a lot of real people around me right now, if that make any sense. thats not ok. a person can only take so much bullshit before they have had enough, and i have certainly been writing enough on that these days. i dont think that helps. i think you may be the only person who follows where i stand on people right now.  it may seem petty or stupid or worthless to think on things to a lot of people, but goddamn.... maybe once i actually think someone sees where im coming from i trust too much that they will be around.... whether or not i have to actually verbalize things to them or not.... ya know? maybe i make no sense. for some reason i think you understand that. some people just know whats up and where my heads at.... tell me why you had to up and leave again? anyways my point in writing... i am glad i got to know you this semester. i think i should have spent more time with you, in hindsight. for mental health reasons if nothing else. thats what  growing independently is all about, afterall.... connecting with certain people on levels other than pure superficiality.  but hell, that happens, aaaand apparently it sucks. love is a strong word.... has many forms.... and i do love you on many levels. not a freaky marriage kinda way, but a close to my heart, complete me and make me feel safe and appeciated kinda way. smooch, come back for new years -=me  now on: jimmy eat world: if you dont know why would you say so                                             *even if your hert would listen, i doubti could explain*

      so i talked to him as soon as i sent his email on xmas eve.... he was sweet.... loved the names and posted them in his diary.... anyways christmas wasnt so bad... went to winnivegas with michael and drew and amber...... more importantly, so shit.... where are you? you were supposed to write me YESTERDAY and tell me about your girl. you met her today.... how did that go? what about her is so great? what abotu me (other than the obvious) is so damn bad? uuuuggghhhh i miss you. so yeah ive been drinking and i wish you would get on so i couuld tell you what was on my mind....i totaly agree with you though.....i hate how music has just become "entertaiment", and everyone just wants to make their pockets bigger through selling music as a product and not as an art.....it drive me crazy   three cheers for commendable conversation: where are the other people in americ who agree with me???  Krstn311: yup. i was offered a spot at virgin this summer, and i dont think there would be any way i could have worked there. i mean, signing a band cuz you think they will make you cash, not cuz they are good? even worse, manufactinring a band? what the fuck is that about? anyway when a label can drop a band after they have put so much time and energy into creating their art b/c they arnt "meeting a quota" something is wrong. people dont have to buy what is fed to them STEVESAVESTHEDAY: i totaly agree with you though.....i hate how music has just become "entertaiment", and everyone just wants to make their pockets bigger through selling music as a product and not as an art.....it drive me crazy STEVESAVESTHEDAY: and i completely agree with the quota thing....one of my favorite bands is the suicide machines from detroit, who were on capital, and who make amazing music but were just dropped STEVESAVESTHEDAY: not on capital, hollywood records i mean Krstn311: i know it-- fuck that. thats not what it should be about.... ian mackaye (fugazi, minor threat) puts it best when he made this wonderful analogy about how music used to be like water, free and abundant, until some asshole discovered you could bottle into into tight little packages and sell it to the masses Krstn311: i love that guy STEVESAVESTHEDAY: exactly....and fugazi is amazing, one of the  few bands that never comrimised what they believed in STEVESAVESTHEDAY: that would have been amazing to work for discord records in the late 80's Krstn311: exactly. now every other band in america who wants to get somewhere has to either suck it up and settle with being a loner, beg for an indie label spot, or whore themselves out and compromise not only their musical ideals but their sound, image, everything Krstn311: i agree STEVESAVESTHEDAY: thats just the way its become now.....i would love to start my own label some day....nothing big, even just local bands, but just to be involved and put out good music that i believed in....thats my true dream and what made me what to study a degree in entrepreneurship  there should be more kids like us in the biz, ehh??? damn straight

      the night of his party he sat me down and told me that i was genuine, unlike a lot of people. thats what was good bout me. but i was too critical. he told me tat you could tell when people were aware.... not the word he was looking for but wha came to mind. i understood what he meant. he compared me to my roomie, saying she was an example of someone unaware. he said girls are more or less manipulative with thoughtless intentions, looking out fo their own backs alone. he said i was different.  i needed to hear all of this.  then he left. this was huge. he asked me to sit with him while alll that was going on so we could talk. i was so happy to be accepted. then what happens?  he leaves. and fades away. she is going to lour him back into her trap when they are away and it is convient for her. when the rest of the boys she has led on are not there to have sex with her. he is sensitive. he will interpret her motives are true despite the fact he was warned. always looking for the bright side of people.   ...... we saw where that took him a couple months ago......  it kills me to see it. remember the car accident scenerio? the feeling of impending doom.... you can see it.... and there is nothing you can do? yeah.... god hon....

      lyrics say so often what i cannot..  What to do/ Sweetheart, you'll find/ mediocre people do exceptional things all the time/ Oh, the ruin will do in your talented mind/ could've been a genius/ if you'd had an axe to grind.  	  Don't give me hints/ 'cause I won't get them/ Don't leave out details/ 'cause I will sweat them   as you lay your head onto my shoulder/ pour like water over me/ so if i just exsist for the next ten minutes of this drive/ that would be fine/ and all these trees that line this curb would be rejoicing and alive/ soon all the joy that pours from everything makes fountains of your eyes/ cuz you finally understand the movement of her hand waving goodbye   I have learned to retreat at the first sign of danger/ I mean, why wait around, if it's just to surrender/ Ambition, I have found, can only lead to failure/ I do not read the reviews. No, I am not (singing) for you  'show me show me show me how you do that trick/ the one that makes me scream' she said/ 'the one that makes me laugh' she said/ and threw her arms around my neck/ 'show me how you do it/ and i promise you i promise you/ ill run away with you/ ill run away with you'

      lifted from the bluecheese guy.  There are things I do for which there is no excuse and for which I will never forgive myself. I seem to be on a path of self-destruction, like one of those fireballs that destroy more bricks than intended, except I'm not ricocheting anymore,  it's all on auto.     The past few weeks have been generally good. I haven't been questioning the need for existence. Or, I've been looking at it from an objective angle. The answers are always the same, but then my mind gets bored and I move on to everyday stuff - because even if the answers do not lie there, at least I know that is what I'm supposed to be concentrating on.  Playing along is redeeming sometimes.   And then the stress factor arrives, and you get washed away with it, like cattle in a torrential flood, except that the altered brain activity exposes certain parts of you that you're  not comfortable with . And you try to deal with them, to bring them out in the open, to rub off the dirt and let some sun shine its generous light on them. And then someone says,   "Don't use your brain, just use your hands."   And you spend the night crying. About why you cannot stop yourself, why you keep on hurting people near to you, and why you cannot answer generosity and love with anything more than  awkwardness  and a desire to prove yourself unworthy.  hummm.

      here are 2 letters i received from wayne at  vagrant .... raised my optimism standard a bit...  Hey! Things are swell! I am just getting back in today from a long two week break. Hope your holidays went well also!   My official title here is Head of Marketing and my last name is spelled Pighini. You can absolutely use my name as a reference if you wish. As long as I know in advance, I am totally fine with it. I certainly recall you being very eager and attentive. Your work here was excellent and I have no problem giving you glowing reviews to anyone who calls. What is your next move? I think you graduate in May, no?   Wayne  AND    Yes, Reggie is coming! 2.18.03. You heard right.    As far as the future goes, please keep in touch. We are still going through a bit of change here with there seemingly being the constant need for help. I will let you know where we are later in the spring and let's keep our fingers crossed that we can work something out. Otherwise, I will also keep my ear to the ground for you!   Stay focused, stay positive, and keep working hard and things will always work out in the end. May sound a little cliched, but it is absolutely true!   Wayne

      moby says  it's been proven on many occasions that i'm not the brightest guy in the world. but i'm still having a hard time understanding why we're going to attack iraq but yet we're leaving north korea alone. in an ideal world we shouldn't be attacking anyone, but isn't it odd that the criteria that's been employed in determining our pending aggression against iraq has been doubly satisfied by the actions of north korea? 1-iraq may or may not have weapons of mass destruction. north korea definitely have weapons of mass destruction. 2-iraq most likely does not have nuclear weapons. north korea most likely does have nuclear weapons. 3-iraq has let un inspectors into their country. north korea have just kicked the un inspectors out of their country. 4-iraq have been belligerent and violent towards their neighbors. north korea have been belligerent and violent towards their neighbors. 5-the powers that be in iraq have been involved in the deaths of millions of iraqi's. the powers that be in north korea have been involved in the deaths of millions of north koreans. 6-the leadership of iraq is despotic and tyrannical. the leadership of north korea is despotic and tyrannical. it's very bizarre. and i'm surprised that more people in the united states and the united states media aren't making a bigger deal out of this strange situation. i know that the bush administration is beholden to the interests of the oil companies, but is that really what's behind all of this weirdness? who knows. moby  now on: beach boys: heroes and villians mmm good song. good record.

"um that is quite an interestng fact. i quite miss my mickeys ice 40's and rolling rock i will have you know. and yes i am in some sort of heinous funk and part of it is well you know why and then my current attempt at quitting smoking again isnt really helping. and the sad thing is i dont really meet a whole lot of people when i am with her cause most people think we are a couple and back away. and fucking a were not. but i have agreed/ invited her whatever to travel with me a bit so might as well stick with her. my flatmates are fucking insane alcoholics tho most of em rock.  they are however dirtier than josh by far.  do me a favor and look at my flat for any free loading renters i wouldnt put it past josh to do so, harsh but true.  i might have my cousins go in for inspections from time to time.  and such a good son i am i almost forgot that my moms bday is the end of the week however i do not know which day it is.   your class schedule sounds pretty hot, no whining, and the michael thing seems to be doing alright.  the daily well its the daily although i am sort of interested in the real world bit.  i told megan that i would talk to her next semester if she was editor about doing movie reviews because of the fact that 8 mile just came out here last week. went and saw it for the 3rd time last night however(it gets worse every time actually)  i dont actually think you shared the car accident analogy with me the other day.  you better keep my babies alive you hear. i burned a couple of the modest mouse cds over christmas but i never got into your cd because my stereo wasnt hooked up properly. no one at all out here knows anything about emo. drum and bass heaven tho. oh and the time difference is that i am 6 hrs ahead of everyone so most of the time that i can go on aim no one is even on, boo. later alex"  then he says this, and i feel even more bad... "so it went down. i dont really want to type it all out so go here it is copy  pasted from my diary i will fill in any holes and i would appreciate talking to  you about this since you are the voice of wisdom on this issue.  fuck her. this is prolly selfish of me. but pardon me if i get pissed off when  you invite me out with you and then make out with some random bloke when your  drunk. its not like she doesnt know how i feel. fuck id treat her like a god  damn princess and she knows it but it really does shit for the self esteem when  she wont consider you but she will go all party slut whenever she feels like. i  was so pissed off i decided to walk home and ditch everyone. i very well could  have gotten mugged in the supposed to be hour long walk and beyond that i was  piss drunk and i got lost, i guess swansea is a hell of alot bigger than i  thought, and finally after about 20 taxis i found one that would take me home  where i commenced to have a phone conv with b. and against my better judgement  i didnt yell at or tell her off, instead i calmly made her feel like shit and  cry. the fucked up part is i feel bad about that. so for someone i have planned  to go on weekend trips with for the next 4 months im kind of stuck being her  freind. the feasibility of not talking to her is close to nil. well if we are  going to be freinds i should tell her she has to start actually being  interested in my feelings thoughts etc. otherwise why the fuck should i have a  one sided freindship.   my example, i sat here in the same large public library and cried for a good  fifteen minutes grieving for my brother who thankfully (very thankfully) has  started to grieve. while she sat next to me didnt say anything didnt ask didnt  comfort. that is definately not something i really look for or for that matter  appreciate. freindship to me, actually more than freindship, was exemplified  when me and my brothers hugged each other and cried outside a bar after kathys  wake regardless of the people going in and out. fuck.  so now i have to decide whether i should TRY and talk with her calmly about all  this and work out how exactly our freindship is going to work. or i really  should close it all up with a nice layer of ice. that unfortunatley has the  potential to become a drama scene again later.  i fucking hate drama, especially when it is of my own making. i cant seem to  stop or ignore it then.   yeah so hit me back thanks  steve"   its is easier to chronicle my life this way. less typing. i say:  "hey voice of wisdom. ahh flattery. wow so on top of oozing "not happy" what happened, in summary, is not ok. youre there to have a good time; you can be sad at home for free. there are some people that do nothing but build you up to let you crash, and those are the people you have to funnel out of your life. yeah thats a little cruel, but i think thats where my mind is on a few people i know right now. no need to put up with people's bullshit games and schemes if its not absolutely necessary. so how that that for predictable. although it may be hard to even fathom putting yourself there, some people are indeed utterly oblivious of how what they do effects other people. an even worse issue is knowing full well what you are doing and how it effects people and not caring- as long as you're happy.  in this case i think it necessary to maintain some kind of tolerant relationship, yes, but at the same time it also seems like it would be a relationship where you have got to watch your back and continually question motives. thats not good.  is it changeable is the question. my bet is still on no. good point- i dont think  you need a one sided friendship. that sucks.  anyway im pretty sure you know exactly what i mean when i mentioned the car accident analogy/ scenario, and its ironic because she happened to prove my point for me. [flash back to the last time you were in a breanna situation... i believe you were trying to get me to explain to billings why i was against such a union, if you will. anyway that feeling of seeing unavoidable travesty in the works and not being able to do anything about it? yeah. hold that thought.]   so what does this mean? i dont know- its hard to explain it, other than by saying i dont like seeing people put themselves in 'not ok' positions. i dont know.. i dont "not like her" for who she is- to each their own- rather for what she exemplifies. i dont enjoy seeing/hearing of people like that pulling their shit time and again and getting away with it. keeping people/opinions/things around for connivance's sake. been there.   then again, maybe that is something that has to knock you on your ass before it can set in... thats certainly what it took for me... however i did liberate myself from said bullshit situation back when. [enter raging independent of today. uugh.]  anyways so you know that was in no way supposed to sound like a lecture, right? hopefully. heres what i wonder though... assuming she cried because she felt bad- does she feel bad because she actually feels bad, of does she feel bad because she was called out on her actions? may be a hard call. but i dont know- doesnt sound like something healthy to be involved in regardless. you have to watch that one- old habits die hard and no matter how much faith you have in someone straightening their shit out, there is sadly never a guarantee girls suck. well, most of them at least.   anyway i know what you mean about meeting people out there, but give it a minute. something tells me that when you find your place out there you will have something else to focus your time or thoughts or attention on. youll feel better if nothing else. wow thats all been a downer. i suck. so lame-o ames news, that will make you happy. (well probably not.) anyway there is a story in the daily today about hastings. it sounds fucking stupid and didnt even mention my new "lifestyles" department. (ha lifestyles, get it?) yeah ok im really going to wear a nametag that says "lifestyles associate" on it. come on, jamie. uh lets see oh im doing a pr campaign project for worldly goods this semester. yay for free trade.   wow so people in my life right now, namely my CA pals and my brother and people afar- including yourself- have heard more from me this semester (all 2 weeks of it) that all of last semester. procrastination is the other thing i am working on: awful habit or fine art... decide.  ok i dont know what to tell you other than chin up and not to let people like that get you down. karma is a bitch. literally. or you could quit being so nice and give her the verbal bitch slap people have apparently failed to give until this point. that may be quite productive. really.  let me know if you need to talk.  -=k  ps dont walk by yourself in foreign countries drunk at night anymore. ok? :)"

      this is a synapsis of my life right now, in letter form. better than a post i would make right now.  "wow so as long as we are sharing interesting facts about whales.. were you aware that an adult blue whale ejaculates 600 gallons of sperm at a time? and of that 600 gallons, only 60 make it to its mate, releasing 540 gallons into the ocean. that certainly explains a lot... and i think i will let it go at that. uhh yeah.  anyway don't let yourself get into some heinous funk over there... you'll find your people. that's the way it works. whether you're looking or not, you always meet the people you're supposed to meet. that's the way life works. fucked, i know. anyway whether you believe that or not, don't worry about it. you're destined to find all kinds of people that are feeling the exact same way. it's inevitable.  so i am in no way surprised about what's going on with breanna. it happens. i am sure you intended things to work out, i dunno, efficiently, but of course things don't work out the way you intend. no, i am not being mean- just saw this one coming... as did you, really. something tells me she may be as evasive as possible when it comes to serious conversation. you have to be on your toes with people like that... it always tends to feel like there are ulterior motives or hidden agendas. anyway as long as you remember what i said about the whole car accident analogy you'll be all right. :) just find yourself a nice european piece or something.. odds are it will be for the better. (i know, easier said that done. still.) good quote though. i may have to write that one down.  so i hate school, although i actually enjoy most of my classes this semester. (magic, witchcraft and religion; race, class, ethnicity and the media; visual literacy; PR campaigns (blah); sex and gender; and history 'o' pop culture 1900-. i will graduate someday, i promise.  so the daily this semester isn't running very well. A&E is totally understaffed, but aaron and megan arn't doing a bad job. (p.s. there is a freshman girl from iowa state in paris right now with the new season of the real world. details in the daily to come. Interesting.) i do have class with megan though, so maybe she will discover i am not quite as intimidating as she would like to believe.   aaaaanyway the past few weeks have been generally good. i haven't been questioning every last goddamn aspect of everything... well at least as drastically... that's good. :) seems i try to find a way to look at things from an objective angle and the conclusions are always the same, and then my mind gets bored and i move on because even if the answers do not lie there, at least i know that is what i'm supposed to be concentrating on. (run on sentence what?) the moral of the story: playing along is redeeming sometimes.   so i haven't spoken to michael for a couple weeks... and the time that i did was only because his drunk ass likes to call in the middle of the night and assess what went wrong between us. sure, i still talk to him via aol cuz we were pretty close afterall.. i'm a nice girl, but i'm pretty proud of myself on this one. :) woo.  you're babies are fine.... i don't know how they are going to last the winter near our not-so-insulated windows. but yeah, i'll do what i can. amber and leah are good... i'm not going to go into the "it's all about me mentality" tangent that's been plaguing the apartment.... but i am sure you follow. i have not seen nate at all.... i saw josh again the other night... i was on welch with jon and he was having a smoke outside jimmy johns yelling at me. i think in some weird way he misses you. good story. i guess i saw him yesterday on my way to work as well, he was with his folks loading "some new stuff" into the apartment. yeah that's all i know.   listen to emo. you'll feel better. like bright eyes. it's the shit, huh?  "And we'll keep working on the problem/ We know we'll never solve/ Of love's uneven remainders/ Our lives are fractions of a whole/ But if the world could remain within a frame/ Like a painting on a wall/ Then I think we'd see the beauty then/ We'd stand staring in awe/ At our still lives posed/ Like a bowl of oranges/ Like a story told/ By the fault-lines and the soil"  that happens to be my song og the day. you'll learn to love it.  ok ten minutes wasted from lab time, score.  anyway ill see ya later k aka yeah just k  ps whats the time difference between here and there?"  okok a lot of that means nothing out of context, but i dont want to type any more.

      katie called today. we are having becks party on 02.01.03  im not very happy today.  shauna officially is "the girlfriend." woohoo!  he says this today "re:so whales blow snow out of their hebejeebees  yes im alive and i apologize for not writing sooner. been in a bit of a funk about things since i havent quite found my place over here yet.  it is a lot bigger over here than what i thought. i am already taking one class and my real courses start next week. me and b well as i thought it would be cool well it wasnt. we are like some kind of fucked up relationship that doesnt really exsist. i started to talk to her about shit last night and the laundromat closed, we were supposed to finish the conv but she never came over so maybe tonite, there has been any mention of it today and she is sitting right next to me now. a good quote for the situation.  I guess that means that when you give the keys to your heart to someone, even when you thought you got them back it doesn't mean they didn't make copies of them.   p3  or some shit like that i miss you and your roomies and juanita. i thought he was going to marry me the bastard. im really sorry about shaun, that sucks bollocks.  are you going to confess to your dashboard in your new car then? just had to throwq that in there you know. how are my babies? have you ran into josh or nate at all? and yes i would like to hear you bitch and moan since you dont let most people hear it. im glad things are looking up tho. anyway gotta go to lecture. cheers stevie aka dave aka alex aka scu"

      check this shit out   Penguins Swim in Mock Migration to Nowhere Jan 17, 11:15 AM (ET)  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The penguins at the San Francisco Zoo are swimming around in circles for hours at a time because they have been bamboozled by six new birds into performing a mock migration, officials say. The marathon began late last month when the newcomers joined the colony, leaving the zoo's penguin keeper Jane Tollini scratching her head as to how the birds from an Ohio theme park, convinced the 46 others to start in with the frenzied swimming. They are so determined even a lack of water cannot keep the birds from the 130-feet-long, 40-feet-wide pool. When zoo keepers first drained the pool for cleaning, the penguins simply jumped in and walked around the bottom.

      my buddy and hero robert anton wilson writes   Perils of Cocaine Abuse    Two recent political leaders allegedly had this nefarious habit.   Both came to power after dubious elections, by non-electorial and irregular methods.   Both nations immediately experienced attacks on famous public buildings.   Both blamed an ethnic minority before forensics had any evidence.   Both led "witch-hunts" against the accused minority.   Both suspended civil liberties "temporarily."   Both put the citizenry under surveillance.   Both maintained secret and clandestine governments.   Both launched wars against most of the world.   One had a funny mustache. Can you name the other one?

      I sent this to Curt after I found out of all that hd happened to him....  ... he plans to use it in a song, he loved it.   It's the last stanza of a piece called 'Buddha in Glory' by Rainer Maria Rilke.   -------------- Center of all centers, core of cores,  almond self-enclosed and growing sweet�  all this universe, to the furthest stars  and beyond them, is your flesh, your fruit.     Now you feel how nothing clings to you;  your vast shell reaches into endless space,  and there the rich, thick fluids rise and flow.  Illuminated in your infinite peace,      a billion stars go spinning through the night,  blazing high above your head.  But in you is the presence that will be, when all the stars are dead.    it is late and i am jut blatently enjoying the fact i am alone in the house. i didnt get SHIT done. blah.   sleep calls.  oh and i think i am in love with my history boy. :) heehee (whole story entirely regarding.... uhh.... he whos name m not going to mention, but what can i say, he thinks im awesome even though i skipped class today. and hes thinking about ditching the lecture and hitting up GTO. thats fucking right. im reading a book about  "his thing" for him........ heehee)

      i just learned grubbs best friend david becker committed suicide, his grandma passed away, and his dad is suffereing from "faults and addictions beyond his control." he is in my prayers. also- he was asked by a best friend to MARRY he and his fiance. amazing. he is ordaining himself as a legal minister so he can marry the two of them. (....is....it.....nick???)  maybe i can get to the bottom of that on 02/12??? :) yay for GTO and Frankenixon. mainly GTO.  on a happier note, here is a beautiful poem he wrote marcie... UNTITLED POEM  by curt grubb c2002  Enamored as the iris by the lily�s petalled rays, Misty sweet as morning dew and melting sugar glaze. Her eyes a storm of sapphires reigning heavy on my heart, Her touch a breath from angels blowing kisses through the stars. Her lips a hue of dusty pink from rose petals in bloom, Her skin a silken tapestry spun from Heaven�s loom. And those moments when I can�t believe she loves me like she does,  Remind me more of who I am than ever who I was. �Cause who I was before we met was half of who I am, And who I am with her to love, a much, much better man.

      wow. im still sick. its been a horrid cold for what, four days now. not ok. anyway last night was becks going away party. she leaves on the 7th for australia, and i will indeed miss her. anyway i "met" a nice boy last night thru said gala....  that was uhh nice. god bless america. other news, lets see. god damn so a shuttle exploded upon reenry into the atmosphere yesterday... the frst israeli astronaut was on board. no survivors, obviously. it had be recalling scenes from my 5 year old kindergarten mind seeing images of the challenger exlosion. tragedy. first unsafe US landing in 42 years..... so so sad.  anyway remember jason? omaha? ..... yeah..... so jello saysGrow More Pot  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  by Jello Biafra  From I Blow Minds for a Living, recorded at Slim's, San Francisco, Nov 21, 1990   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Does anybody out there know that for the first time in American history the U.S. Army was used in a war operation against the American people? Right near here, up in Humboldt County about 200 miles north of San Francisco right near a town called Shelter Cove, get this: three- to four-hundred American G.I.s dressed with automatic rifles and fully armed for battle, fanned out on maneuvers through the woods, backed up by a dozen Blackhawk attack helicopters. The mountain people up there were frightened out of their wits! They thought there was a war going on, especially the ones that had soldiers kicking in the doors to their cabins and putting guns to their heads in front of their children.  Why!? Who was the enemy in this war? Not the communists! Not Saddam Hussein! Not Earth First! or even the spotted owl. No! The enemy they called out the army to put down, secretly, so few people outside of Humboldt would get alarmed as possible, it wasn't even a person or an army or a terrorist group! It was a plant, the marijuana plant.   And they actually did manage to find a few for the G.I.s to pull up, and then they had to fly in more from the government stash so the pile would look big enough when they lit the bonfire for the network TV news cameras, so that they could say "Yes! Another triumph in the Drug War!"   Drug War. War. The American army sent to war against the American people. And we're supposed to feel relieved and secure and protected. Protected from what?!   A lot of people with more guts than I'll ever have risked their life and limb all last summer at the Earth First! Redwood Summer Action up in Humboldt County. They were chaining themselves to redwoods that were three times wider than they were, 800 years old, they were spread-eagled, as the saws buzzed right over their heads. They stood in the dirt as the bulldozers charged them and stopped right at their toes. Or people waved clubs at them, charged them with logging trucks, shotguns, you name it. All to try to save some of the last unspoiled virgin forest we have left anywhere in this country from being chopped down and turned into toilet paper, TV Guides and the Weekly World News.   On the other side the loggers saying "What about our jobs!? What about our families!? What about our lives?! You needed wood and cardboard to make those protest signs!"   We need fuel! We need paper! It's almost gone! Where are we gonna get more? The answer, for centuries, has been right under our nose: grow more pot!   If we're serious about saving the earth, saving the ozone and our freedom to go about saving the earth and the ozone, we should start by paying all those dirt-poor coca farmers in South America and out-of-work loggers in Fortuna and Eureka, and Midwest family farmers and rust-belt families too, to all get together and grow more pot!   Why? Get ready for this...! There's a book out called The Emperor Wears No Clothes. The author's name is Jack Herer. It's published by Queen of Clubs, and I think there's ads for it in High Times, or NORML, the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws, could direct you to a copy I'm sure, and in this book, among other places, it is written that before the 20th century, the marijuana plant provided almost all the world's paper, all the world's clothing and textiles, and almost all the world's rope.   According to none other than the U.S. Department of Agriculture you can make four times as much paper from one acre of hemp plants as you can from an acre of trees. And instead of chopping down all the redwoods in Humboldt County and turning Northern California, Oregon and Washington and Appalachia into the Sahara Desert, if you do it with hemp plants, you can just grow another crop a few months later and make more paper! At one-quarter the cost of making paper from wood pulp and only one-fifth the pollution. The ancient Romans knew this and grew it, Henry VIII made each farmer in old England grow their share, because they knew if you want the strongest natural fiber there is, you all have gotta do your part for the King and grow more pot!   And we did, too! Guess what Levi jeans were originally made out of? And guess what American flags used to be made out of? And guess what the early drafts of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were written on? And if that's too un-Christian for you, guess what they made Guttenberg and King James Bibles out of? Guess what you can use to power a car? You can get at least four times as much cellulose to make gasohol or methanol from hemp stems as you can from a corn stalk. Which along with solar energy would be a great way to avoid dying for oil in Saudi Arabia.   In the 1920s and 1930s most American cars and farm machinery had the option of running on gas or on methanol; most racing cars still do run on methanol. And George Washington and Thomas Jefferson grew cannabis on their plantations and smoked it, too!   In the 1760s in the American colonies you could even be jailed for not growing pot! Because that was part of the key to becoming economically independent from Britain. Hemp was legal tender in the Americas, a substitute for money, from 1630 clear up to the early 1800s. And hemp seeds are a great source of protein, better than soybeans, and it's cheaper than soybeans, too. Or so says the U.S. Department of Agriculture.   Marijuana is legal for medical use in 34 states used to treat glaucoma and pain caused by cancer, and you can digest more protein from a hemp seed than a soybean seed. It's even shown some signs at being able to combat herpes. And, guess what kind of a parachute Mr. Drug War Junta-Man himself George Bush used when he bailed out of that bomber in World War II?   Hemp was illegal by then, but farmers were briefly ordered to grow it again in this country for the war effort and all, and the U.S. Army had their own stash all along in the colonies in the Philippines.   So, how did everything get turned around so damn bad? Doesn't it strike you as a little dumb that we burn oil and choke ourselves and chop down all our trees and ruin innocent people's lives by branding them criminals and throwing them in jails, or sending them off to drug camps, or taking all their property and selling it before they're brought to trial? In the process, making crack and heroin cheaper and easier to get than pot? Why do we do this when we don't have to?   Meanwhile the Police Chief of L.A., Darryl Gates gets front page approval for telling a U.S. Senate committee that pot smokers should be shot on sight. Because smoking pot is treason because, after all, it's illegal.   Why was marijuana cracked down on? And why was it done so violently? Well ... Ready?!   In 1936 Popular Mechanics magazine hailed the invention of a new machine to process hemp, predicting that marijuana/hemp would once again become the world's largest cash crop. This did not at all sit well with people like Hearst Paper Manufacturing or Kimberly-Clark or other cutthroat multinationals who happen to have large timber holdings. It didn't sit to well with tobacco barons for obvious reasons, and it sure as hell didn't sit too well with old buddies DuPont. Hemp processing uses only one-fifth the chemicals need to process wood pulp, and DuPont had just patented a new wood pulp sulfide process, and DuPont's patented plastic fibers had just passed up hemp as the No. 2 fiber, next to cotton, and they wanted to keep it that way!   And the last thing the big drug companies wanted was to lose their share of the ever lucrative disease industry market, to more affordable medicine made from marijuana or other natural ingredients because, check this out, you can't own and make money off a patent for medicine in this country, unless the medicine has chemicals in it. If it's all natural ingredients, you can't patent it. Maybe that's why we don't have access to a cure for cancer or AIDS, or why the health food store I go to keeps getting harassed by federal authorities for selling herbal medicines.   Meanwhile, guess who owns Congress? So marijuana was outlawed in 1937 and they fanned the racism fires playing the racism card just like they do when they want to crack down on rock-and-roll or rap or hip hop or something like that. They said that smoking marijuana might cause you to fall under the influence of listening to jazz! I believe that it was even said on the floor of Congress that marijuana had to be banned because smoking it might make a black man look at a white woman twice. And let's not forget that U.S. Treasury Department funded documentary film, called, "Reefer Madness!" So marijuana was outlawed as devil weed in 1937. Only 53 years ago it was legal. Need I say more, on why our beloved fearless leaders go out of their way to censor our access to information so damn much? Can you imagine the mass outrage if this kind of stuff ever really got out? And people knew that this big drug problem that they keep reading about and hearing about is being caused by the government themselves? And people knew how easily each one of us individually could turn our ecological and human crisis around without resorting to Nazi bullshit like oil wars and drug wars by just saying no! to George Bush.   And if people knew that the very companies that provide us with such crucial conveniences as Kleenex, paper towels and junk mail, have systematically and brutally rearranged every single one of our lives so that we are literally wiping our ass with out own future?   And it doesn't have to be this way! I mean, I'll tell you, I do feel kind of funny saying all this because I used to be a pothead and I hate smoking the stuff, and the whole low-energy stoner Deadhead vibe that comes with it. But, you don't need to smoke pot to realize that the real drug problem in this country is not the drugs. And we can help solve drug problems, crime problems, environmental problems - even our racial problems if we say no to George Bush and get together and grow more pot!

      song of today "Warning Warning-forgot to mention my fear of falling.  Warning Warning-the voice inside my head keeps calling  Warning Warning-the water's deep better learn to tread  Teetering on the edge.  The voices inside my head-they're calling, they're calling.  They echo the things you said."  :) uuuh.

       Valentines Day? Fuck that.    Happy unimaginative, consumerist-oriented and entirely arbitrary, manipulative & shallow interpretation of romance day. Wow check the optimism.  Everybody has a different idea of love. One girl I know said, 'I knew he loved me when he didn't come in my mouth. - Andy Warhol   People should fall in love with their eyes closed. Just close your eyes. Don't look. - Andy Warhol    Whats on my mind today? This sums it up.   I feel as if I'm growing very nostalgic these days. I suppose that's typical when we go through major life changes. There is a lot of transition in my life right now.  Yet somehow, although I have been thinking very much of things that once were, I am looking forward to what lies ahead. I even feel enthusiastic about what's coming to me - whatever it may be. I am ready now, moreso than I have been. Perhaps this is only because I really don't have any other option than to be ready to move on, but that's not my suspicion. I feel ready because I want to be, not because I have to be.  I am ready to move forward in all aspects of my life...and so it shall be. 	 ...sooner or later this cold, its gonna break and my hands will be warm again...   Could you explain some things to me.    A. Nukes For Us, Not For You:   One of the worst things about this entire mess is that it's predicated on the general assumption that we, the United States, obviously know better than some Arab what's best for the world (and their own country). Which, of course, is utter crap, and anybody who thinks that us Americans somehow know better really need to step back and take a good hard look at our selfish, flabby, infotainment-glutted, macho selves. We don't know what's best, people -- or at least, we don't know any better than anybody else does. And now we've proved it, by throwing around the idea of hitting Iraq with tactical nukes. Wait a minute -- aren't we doing this to liberate Iraq, not turn it into a glassy nuclear wasteland? And aren't we doing this to keep people from using nuclear weapons on one another? So...we're going to deter "rogue nations" from using nuclear weapons by using our own on them -- before they even develop them? Does this sound insane to anybody else out there? Face facts: biological and chemical warfare is bad, but the only -- I repeat, ONLY -- weapons currently in existence that can wipe out life as we know it are nuclear weapons. We need to make the world see that it's best to not use them, rather than aiming them at anybody who makes us mad.   B. Protest the War on Iraq:   All over the country and the world tomorrow, Saturday, February 15th, massive peace rallies and marches will take place -- and if you oppose the all-but-decided war on Iraq, you need to attend. To find out where the nearest protest is, you can go here (and believe me, this isn't just limited to the big cities).    C. I read this today... The Mask Comes Off:  It's nice when a television talking head gets shot down on his own show. If you hadn't heard, The O'Reilly Factor's Bill O'Reilly recently interviewed Jeremy Glick, the son of Barry Glick, a NY Port Authority worker who lost his life in the World Trade Center. O'Reilly berated Glick for being against the war, "equating" the U.S. with terrorist countries, and, best of all, dishonoring his father's memory. Boy. I can't even really express the full extent of my anger and disgust on this one, folks. O'Reilly attacked the son of a terror victim for speaking his mind and protesting the impending war (and public speech is, by the way, legal in this country), and he did it by saying "I don't think your father would be approving of this." Please note that Mr. O'Reilly had never met Barry Glick in life, but had no qualms about using this man's memory to push his own agenda. How in the hell would O'Reilly have any idea what Barry Glick would think about his son's stance? And even more egregious still, how dare he tell Jeremy Glick that he, Bill O'Reilly, obviously knew Jeremy's father's mind better than he did? 	 WHAT WHAT WHAT? Of course, that's the nice thing about martyrs, though, isn't it? The dead can't disagree with you.  Funny funny: http://www.masturbateforpeace.com/  Soooooooooooo happy vday. Why am i NOT in cali and WHERE is shauna? hummm MIA.  its raining freeeeezing rain. my pants are soaked. what am i doing tonight?? :)

      .... i think i love conor.  :)  uuhh. busta style. uuh.  The Movement of a Hand  "You follow the footsteps echoes leading down a hall to a room.  There is music playing tiny  bells with moving parts.  Here the shadows make things ugly, an effect quite undesirable.  The  bold and yellow daylight grows like ivy across the wall and bounces off of the painted porcelain,  tiny dancing doll.  Her body spins, as she pirouettes again, the world suddenly seems small.  On  an off white, subtle morning you stretch your legs in the front seat.  The road has made a vacuum  where our voices used to be.   And you lay your head onto my shoulder, pour like water over me.   So if I just exist for the next ten minutes of this drive that would be fine. And all the trees that line  this curb would be rejoicing and alive.  Soon all the joy that pours from everything makes  fountains of your eyes because you finally understand the movement of a hand waving you good- bye."      aaaaaaaand how.

      greetings and salutations  just vaccumed and am sitting back with a little depeche mode, cash stylee  heres that song i was thinking about... man without plan is the band... ((who the fuck?))  anyway "I don�t have anywhere to be, no other priorities, so I�d appreciate it if you would level with me tonight. I would give my memory since, oh, 1983 just to know what you were thinking at any given time.  Don�t give me hints, because I won�t get them. Don�t leave out details, because I will sweat them . I need this like I need a good case of scurvy or gangrene, but I�ll be happy if you just stop singing that fucking song.  Just fucking shut up, you�re singing it wrong. It�s the one that changed my life. Just fucking shut up, you�re pissing me off. Or at least learn the words right.  But I�ll be OK, things are fucking great. Don�t drag this out too long. Just make it short and sweet, wrap it nice and neat, and  stop singing that goddamned fucking song. "  both brilliant AND inspired. and i feel that haha

      funk you for reading this. you never know what i mean and what i dont. ha history, dear...  oh and on what i mentioned below... the liberation? heres a little dalai lama upside your head  Compassion is not religious business, it is human business, it is not luxury,  it is essential for our own peace and mental stability, it is essential for human survival.     This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy.  Our own brain, our own heart is our temple ; the philosophy is kindness.     I believe all suffering is caused by ignorance. People inflict pain on others in the selfish pursuit of their happiness or satisfaction.  Yet true happiness comes from a sense of peace and contentment, which in turn must be achieved through the cultivation of altruism, of love and compassion, and  elimination of ignorance, selfishness, and greed.      I am open to the guidance of  synchronicity , and do not let expectations hinder my path.    I am a simple Buddhist monk.   Human beings are of such nature that they should have not only material facilities but spiritual sustenance as well.  Without spiritual sustenance, it is difficult to get and maintain peace of mind.    From the viewpoint of absolute truth, what we feel and experience in our ordinary daily life  is all delusion . Of all the various delusions, the sense of discrimination between oneself and others is the worst form, as it creates nothing but unpleasantness for both sides. If we can realize and meditate on ultimate truth, it will cleanse our impurities of mind and thus eradicate the sense of discrimination. This will help to create true love for one another. The search for ultimate truth is, therefore, vitally important.      I believe that the very purpose of life is  to be happy .  From the very core of our being, we desire contentment.  In my own limited experience I have found that the more we care for the happiness of others, the greater is our  own sense of well-being . Cultivating a close, warmhearted feeling for others automatically puts the  mind at ease . It helps remove whatever fears or insecurities we may have and gives us the strength to cope with any obstacles we encounter. It is the principal source of success in life. Since we are not solely material creatures, it is a mistake to place all our hopes for happiness on external development alone.  The key is to develop inner peace.       Each of us in our own way can try to spread compassion into people�s hearts. Western civilizations these days place great importance on filling the human �brain� with knowledge, but no one seems to care about filling the human �heart� with compassion.  This is what the real role of religion is.     I believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness. That is clear. Whether one believes in religion or not, whether one believes in this religion or that religion, we all are seeking something better in life. So, I think, the very motion of our life is towards happiness�

      ... guess what... im completely over the drama of last semester now. it feels good. moving on is a wonderous feeling.  and marisa writes: Hey K Eek, sorry it took me so long to get back to you, it's been pretty crazy. Somehow I got bombarded with a million e-mails, all of which need answering... so I've been spending the day trying to get those under control! Yes I can hook you up, that's not a problem. Just e-mail me and remind me when you see a release coming up, cuz otherwise I'll forget. In the meantime I'll send you a Reggie(we are running low on promos so I'll get one to you as soon as I can).  Yes there have been a lot of changes but the result has been really good. Everyone's really motivated and it's going to be such a busy year I think it's keeping us all on our toes. I know I prefer busy to slow. And yeah... good luck with the weather. GOD we are spoiled, it's just completely sickening ;) If it makes you feel better I'm really cold at the moment(probably because it's dipped below 70, God forbid). Tee hee, don't hate us.  I'm actually not sure as to who you should send the resume - that's probably a Wayne question.  I better run - sorry again about lagging on getting back to you. Hope you're good! Let me know if you need anything else Take care  Marisa  funny funny  i cant forget the whole nail polish thing on wed- i promised him the hook up, and by god i follow thru  hes the coolest... hell bent and heaven sent.

      I think this happens in all aspects of life, and manifests itself as one of the biggest challenges to overcome in strategies to enduring life.   When do you sleep / when do you live.  So ya, I feel dumb, and beaten down.  I guess obviously I should live continually, but you wouldn�t believe how frustrating that is, and how you [I] just end up saying mean shit. But I know that other people can pull it off, without blinding themselves, so I think I need to meet and copy people like that.  I like to think that the physical abuse my mind has suffered during my self-destructive self-analysis was for my own good. I want to believe that getting drunk and doing drugs is a lot like �brain training�. Just like when you lift weights, you tear old muscle, and repair it stronger than before, or how broken bones will never break in the same place twice.  And it is true that brain cells repair themselves over time, so it is possible that this has [physically] been a fruitful experiment.  Unfortunately, I believe that the truth is that my self destructive introspection is really bullshit, and the true motivation is a cowardly lack of enthusiasm in finding the silver lining.  I wonder why?  Lots of people I know have found silver linings in their lives. Most of it is bullshit, and the things that they cling to are artificial, superficial nonsense [from my perspective, but I believe also from God�s perspective, so...... ya]. But that is ok, they have different goals then me, and whatever keeps you going has got to have value, if only in function and not intrinsically. I thing the unfortunate truth is that my calculated self-destruction is just as weak as clinging to the security of acerbate familiarity.  I think that the biggest problem people [like me] have in their lives is knowing when to cut bait and walk away from an issue  It is hard for me to understand that life is not just a sequence of mathematical puzzles. Solve one and then move on. The problem is that I got stuck on the first problem.  Fine, life is pointless and makes no real sense. It is filled with those who take and those who give, apparently both motivated by instinct. It involves nice people getting fucked over, and evil people fucking everything they can [more figuratively then literally, but literally to some extent, I think based more on real motivations, not because sex is wrong]. It involves destruction, not maintenance, of human dignity. It involves subtle defiance rewarded by indifference. It involves overt defiance rewarded by isolation. It involves discrete categorization without any concerted delineated justification [basically, pragmatic classification without objective rationalization]. The destructive implications of this methodology are ubiquitous.   While I do believe that my overall approach is [ob] noxious, I think that it is slightly ironic.  I truly believe that I know what is valuable, and what is beautiful. It is because there is so little that is beautiful in what I see that I am hung up. To tell me to look on the bright side seems offensive. Basically, by �looking on the bright side� you are acknowledging that you have no causal relation with the external world, and so you mind as well just buckle down and get used to the slop you are served.  That is not really the most proficient recipe for progress.  I want to change the world. I want to help. I want to show someone what real beauty is. And I want to shift reality for all, not just the conscious. I want mindless lostlings to live in a truly beautiful society too. I want them to feel confidant and leave the security of familiarity in exchange for warranted awareness.  Creepy, how could I ever do that?   I think if I was someone else like me, and I met me, I would like to talk to me. I don�t think I would gather any useful information, but I think that I would, at the very least, say some weird shit to myself.  Bizarre how intention, methodology, and impact have such a non-linear relation when applied in a complex environment. Its like this world was made for the insane, and God threw a few rational people in just for contrast. I have no idea how a healthy being functions in this world, unless they just copy lower animals and just live in convergent complacency.  I think that what I just wrote is a partial representation of what I am thinking right now. On a second read, it seems kind of absurd, maybe idealistic? [I always put those clauses in, just incase I look back later and am embarrassed at my own naivety. Like instead I should just put �yes, I wrote this, but I by no means stand by it�].  I think I am just trying to find a really good reason to explain why I am unhappy. By describing myself as a social savant, and intellectual trailblazer burning a calculated path into humanities �formative years�, I think I end up saving face, establishing value, yet at the same time explaining why the weaklings I know think I am an asshole.  Right now I need to find someone to love. And someone to love me. And I want to meet someone trustworthy. [Fuck that is a pretty sad tangent to throw in, it make me sound miserable, just a bruised soul in need of a little TLC]  IRONIC, I think what I really want is to meet someone that can look on the bright side of me, and look past all the evil shit I can barely detect anymore, and focus on the intrinsic value I possess.   Weird, I guess you need one of each.

      jon wrote this  i respect this  woah.  Jon Dahlager   write #3  "Notes"  Some people have a dog. I have The Beatles and Elton John.  Back when I was nine, my grandpa and I were driving up the North Shore in his beat-up Ford, singing along to a well-worn cassette of John Denver�s greatest hits. "Thank God I�m a Country Boy" was his favorite and mine too; we�d sing every word, the fine grain of my voice somehow mixing with his gravel. The crackling tape always reminded me of pancakes on a griddle.  I always sing something in the shower, and I can�t quit in the middle of a song. Most of the time it�s Peter, Paul & Mary�s version of "Puff the Magic Dragon."  I just wanted to play Mega Man before we got on the bus to go to the last day of school before winter vacation, but Jimmy had MTV on again. And then I heard "Smells Like Teen Spirit." After school, I begged my mom to buy me "Nevermind" for Christmas. I still listen to it once a week, at least. It was so different from the one- or two-hit wonders that I had previously been obsessed with; Kurt Cobain, Chris Novoselic and Dave Grohl reached into my muddled middle school mind, unleashing within me emotions and questions through screamed whispers of absolute feeling.  I couldn�t get enough.  I met my first college girlfriend because she had Soul Coughing�s "Sugar Free Jazz" playing in her room when I wandered past her open door early freshman year. This was my line: "You like this song? I didn�t think anybody but me even knew about this song."  Our grass grew so quickly. Mom would send me out with the mower twice a week, and at first, I hated it. Once I got a Walkman that all changed. I�d pop in a scratchy, dubbed tape of Snoop Doggy Dogg�s "Doggystyle" and daydream about Snoop and Dr. Dre rolling up in a lowrider to steal me away from the white house/ green grass checkerboard. There was something depressing about living in a town where people pretended to be so much more than they actually were. I was white. I was na�ve. I had never been to the �hood. But it didn�t matter. Snoop�s world of drive-bys and drug deals seemed much more real than my plastic existence.  Sometimes I�d overdose. Musicland was my dealer in 1994, supplying me with hits of Ben Harper, Weezer, Soundgarden and Hole. It was a $23.98-a-week-plus-tax habit.  You know those stupid e-mail surveys people always forward to you and 47 of their closest friends? There�s one thing I always want to know instead of the answers to pointless questions about your latest crush or if you prefer Pepsi over Coke. "If you were stuck on an island with only one song for the rest of your life, what would it be?" I know it�s clich�, that whole island thing, but I think it�s an important question. I�d pick Pearl Jam�s B-side "Yellow Ledbetter."  In the middle of our first American History exam, Dave kicked the back of my chair when I started drumming the beat to Green Day�s "Basket Case" on my desk; what was I supposed to do? My internal CD player was stuck on repeat.  "Sgt. Pepper�s Lonely Hearts Club Band" is good to fall asleep to. I don�t mean it puts me to sleep; the first notes are like a remote control, flipping channels until I find the dream I want to watch. I don�t recommend "Dark Side of the Moon," however. The clock chimes at the beginning of "Time" always wake me up just as I�m about to lose consciousness. And the last thing I want to do is associate music I love with rude awakenings.  Before I got a steady job, my wallet never seemed full enough. I�d end up having to decide between McDonald�s and the latest Nine Inch Nails single. The Big Mac always lost.  I won�t date a girl who doesn�t like Weezer. It�s just not going to happen. If she doesn�t like them, it�s over. I don�t know if that is the best way to find the so-called "right" person, but I need a girl who appreciates "In the Garage" and "Across the Sea" as much as I do. Well, I guess she doesn�t have to have the exact same favorite Weezer songs, but it would be nice. Sharing music like that creates something I can�t really describe. It�s a bond. A bond that causes each person�s eyes to perk up at the exact same time when he or she is particularly moved by a lyric. A bond that makes one person tell the other person before anyone else about the new life-changing record they just heard. A bond that allows the two individuals to move in unison, becoming much more than dancing.   Music makes me want to fuck.  Marie figured we should rent a horror movie; any old slasher flick would do. "Just in case I scream," she said to me matter-of-factly. Maybe she would scream. Maybe not. But I really didn�t care if my parents heard. So I convinced her to do it during the opening credits of Star Wars instead. Back in 8th grade I had determined that losing my virginity with the movie�s main title as soundtrack�me thrusting with each cymbal crash �would be the coolest thing ever. I was right. Thank you John Williams.  Too many people only like happy music. "Why listen to something that makes you sad?" they ask.   I didn�t care about geometry the day I found out Kurt Cobain had killed himself. I didn�t care about English or history either. Nothing mattered, and everything imploded. Hope, the little shining sprite that danced and sang in the darkest corners of life, had fallen silent and gray. I felt like my best friend was gone, leaving me alone to deal with high school, girls and thick jocks in the locker room who just wanted to talk about their dicks.  When Katie dumped me five days before I headed off to college, I played Limp Bizkit�s "Nookie" over and over again, screaming along with Fred Durst. She hated that song. It�s all I listened to for weeks.  Dad headed to the hospital for the first time in December. For a month, I listened to Foo Fighters� "The Colour and the Shape" every night before I fell asleep. It didn�t matter that I had hundreds of other CDs to chose from, I couldn�t stop myself from listening to that particular collection of songs. I wanted to just listen to "Hero" over and over again, with its undulating guitar line and refrain: "There goes my hero/ watch him as he goes/ There goes my hero/ he�s ordinary." But too much of a good song, especially a good song that hurts, is like too much of anything else. Still, I would get out of bed and lie on the floor during that song just to feel the bass from the speakers vibrate each vertebrae in my back. I wouldn�t really close my eyes until the final track�s very last note was absorbed by the hundreds of posters and stickers that plastered my walls like a slightly off-kilter mosaic. Some albums are like that.  I just want to scream all the time. Not regular screaming, however. I want to scream in tune.  The pressure builds. It starts as a nudge, a little push. And then it grows and grows and grows, a malignant tumor on your psyche. You have to get good grades. You have to have an internship. You have to tell your girlfriend if she�s the one or not, at least for now. You have to make the people happy. Everything tightens. "Release." Now there�s a song to make you feel lighter. Eddie Vedder�s simple refrain, "release me," is enough to wash it all away.  Sometimes I wonder if I believe in anything, if I have anything to hold onto, if I understand what it is that blueprints my life. I�m not so sure about the whole God thing. And science confounds me to no end; it seems that even something that claims to be objective and true requires faith of some sort. Friends, colleagues, and yes, even family, come and go. Sometimes I think there isn�t anything I can count on when nothing seems to make sense. And then I wake up and listen. I�ll be sitting alone in my room, near crying because something in my life is wrong�girlfriend leaves me for my best friend, dad�s in the hospital for chemotherapy, or I oversleep and miss a test�when I�ll catch the faint sound of R.E.M.�s "Everybody Hurts" coming from nearby. Most of the time it�s just in my head, but not always. The thing is, I�ve realized that I always have music. It�s my best friend, and it never lets me down.

      you know that oak ridge boy that sings in that "well fire up" song? the "um paw paw, um paw paw, mow mow" guy? i think maybe thats what jesus sounds like.  so today i entered that lame-o mastercard music industry internship thing. 48 kids picked, only 4 or something get to work on the jurassic 5 record. fuck interscope anyway. here is my "250 word essay on 'if i started my own music or entertainment business what would it be and how would it be different."   (ps they will hate me and never in a million years choose me. why? it is very aggresive and in your face pointing out that THEY are the root of all evil and that i aspire to bust my ass for REAL bands with REAL talent and not their manufactured shit. i also made a point of working among people who REALLY believe in the bands and their creative input as the ONLY creative input and none of their "expoit, sell out, and move on to the next big thing" philosophy.             "As a senior in Journalism/PR, I dream to one day be a positive and supporting force in the music industry. I am working to someday actively excel in the promotion of the thriving musical community, while reflecting the evolution of popular music.           If I were to start my own music company, I would see to it that it would be filled with people interested in the creations and successes of the bands on the roster, as well as their best interests and opinions. In a perfect world, I dream of working in an atmosphere that exemplifies the idea that at the end of the day, all that matters is that they we are working for something we believe in. In such a jaded musical world, the community often gives an aura of work for work's sake, whereas ideally I believe in working for the love of the cause.           There are so many struggling bands out there today that have the talent to one day blow up the charts, with only the necessary help and promotion. I want to be the person to do just that- help in artists' journey to the top. Music can be such a powerful resource for so many people, and it is my objective to help people become aware of new sounds and the bands that help push these sounds to the scene."  suck? yeah i know it does but hell, i made my point as passively as possible. eehhhh smooth.  grubb says: "k, good to see you in ames. we had a blast and have gotten tons of postive feedback regarding the show. if it's cool with you, i'll bring extra cds for our show on the 28th at peoples for consignment. that way we can save on postage. lemme know if it's okay with you and we'll see you soon. thanks for the love and your help with the show and write up and everything else. have a great day! grubb"  more news---------- i mailed peter raspler. his reply? "are you graduating? are you moving to LA or just considering it for the summer? are you looking for a full time job or an internship for the summer? what is your job interest in the music industry / what area of the business? hope you're well peter"  then  "ok, thanks for the further info. we'll keep an eye out for your letter/resume. keep in touch as we near the summer. peter"  sooooooo i think if anything worked there hell would indeed be frozen over but i would put on a scarf and be a happy girl.

      im so happy for shauna that she has boy to cast a silver lining. awww! very cute. hey so i as speaking of her yesterday. gto asked about her as we got shitty. the cutie who went to high school with curt and bob- cool cool guy. did i mention grubb introduced me as "our friend k, shes been staying nights at our house for years- naked." thank you boys. they certainly attract a special group of people into their lives. (and he looks like brandon boyd and stevie spice. you approve, trust me.)    ok a sober ccount of last night-- minus the juicy stuff that i keep private ;)  they know im getting shaunas ass out here for the release (YES.) so i am giving her the 2 month (plus or minus a couple weeks) notice that we are going to have to get her hooked up. don't forget. its on me for a summer of smokey babysitting. ;)  anyway bob got a new digital camera and decided to start documenting the shows and putting them on this horrid creation we call the world wide web. he just put up photos from the last time they were here (curt lifting weights in the van, james picking his nose, and bobs bare ass to the windshield on the trip to iowa city from ames.) funny funny. after 6 hours of fucking around he decided it necessary to get my photo on there (uhh no im not glenn) but hell i apparently was too drunk to mind, so watch for some lovely pics of a glazed bob, james and grubb, as well as grubb in a cute gto spaghetti strap tank tonguing my face. i guess thats a good summary of a much needed and rarely possible night out.  so john kardell isnt touring with the guys anymore-- he is like 48 afterall... and they cannot afford to pay him right now for work they can do themselves. especially as soon as mike officially joins the band they will surely be able to do it with four. anyway hes still im omaha doing his whole john, wise as a sage thing.  i feel inspired to drop him a line one of these days.  so as of late i have sent resumes to:  Vagrant Records- LA Raspler Management- LA Time Bomb Recordings- Laguna Beach Slow Gun Records- Anaheim Revelation Records- HB Nitro Records- HB Fiddler Records- LA Touch and Go Records- Chicago Victory Records- Chicago Saddle Creek Records- Omaha Skunk Records- Yes, Long Beach All Ears Management- LA  Atlas/ThirdRail Management- LA (they have Weezer!) GoldMountain Entertainment- LA (they have the Beastie Boys, Beck, Foo Fighters.whee!)  so other that what was mentioned, things are ok. (minus stress of school and finding a job/ place to live/ future) dont know if i mentioned, but my uncle tom (well, my moms adopted brother, in this case i consider uncle a relative term...) goes to fed court next week. id like to write him a letter and ask him all about the apparent meth lab in his basement and what his kids- who he hasnt spoken to in 3 years, ages 20 and 17, think about that. jackass. so it goes, i guess.   did you know james started smoking again after 3 years, bob also started again and he claims he was more ashamed buying a pack a few months ago then of anything else hes ever done. thats sad. he only needed something to release all his energy on while at the mixing board.   wh did i write all ths?? SLEEP. shit.

      just saw my GTO boys  curt called as soon as i left to let me know i was on the list  its ok, although i didnt get the message in iem, i did get $14 back  pitchers and 2 fers for us all!  it was a brilliant set, lots of pre-show bonding with curt james AND bob...  bob ad someone take a pic of the 2 of us for the site, then one of just me, then of grubb licking my face. funny. but with the booze bought for me (thanks bob, and for the offer james) this evening by those men, i was fuuuuucked up. and i will still have james's baby.  ps as curt if we can get ahold of anything completed. they spoke of a second ep-- hook a girl up!  ... and their pal tim (was it tim?) is fucking hot. he went to high school with bob and curt and we spoke quite a bit. he noticed i was smiling and having a good time during some "back woods" song, (pomeroys 'the devil wnt down to georgia) and he gave me props cuz that was the way it should be. he loked like brandon boyd and james mixed togethet. h-o-t.

      i am so fucking tired of taking care of other people right now. i dont have kids for a reason-- i dont have the time strength or energy to take care of that. i cannot handle having other people rely on me unknowingly for so much. maids are paid. therapists are paid. a chump is free. and thats me. i love to help people, but there comes a point where you are being fucking used and thats where i feel i am.   if i come clean with what i am thinking i am an emotional bitch. right now i could knock both roomies on thier asses with whats going on in my head. maturity girls. you both need to realize that the world does NOT revolve around you. i mention a problem and i get a compliant from you. geez tell me how both you and your boyfriend slept last night and how much your 12 credit ass has to do. tell me how youre growing up and dont want to leave me behind. tell me alllll about how you need to find a job and move to a place youve never been and go on job interviews to places you havent sent your resumes to. uhhh ok dear. reality check. people like you dont make it far in the world. it is giving me an ulcer.   i see why people could freak and beat their kids, i am so sad to say. i am at a point of breaking right now. and the added on katie BULLSHIT that should have been let go MONTHS ao does not help me. what the FUCK is this shit. fuck you all. thats where i am right now. can i focus on me a second and not just work it in between tasks for others? would that be ok?   im not a crier and i feel like im going to just break down.  or scream something i dont entirely mean. or punch someone. or throw up. or all. kill me.  how can i feel so damn miserable. HORRIBLE.  ulcer enters here. why am i locked in my room all the time? humm. guess what kids, there are other people in the world besides you. people have their own problems, real ones, nonetheless, not just not getting mom and daddy to but you a new suit. imagine that. it enrages me. the two ladies who were my best friends have turned into people i can hardly tolerate. really.  the phone rings. who is that? gee i dunno. its the person she declares to be her best friend. yeah thats right, sure isnt me, cuz i wont take liars and their bullshit. or theives, goddammit. morals, values, ethics, friendship for christs sake. relearn what those are. good luck putting your routine past people in the future.... fake people are all the rage in california.  as cliche as it is, no one here understands me. im sorry i dont think like you. not everything is on the surface. im sorry i look deeper and see things you try to hide. i am sorry my concerns are not similar to yours. im sorry i take on so much and try and act like i can handle it all. im sorry it seems it is i who is moving on and am not as sad as i would have thought to leave you behind.  i would post this right now, but imagine that, she is still on the phone. humm. they havent spoken in a few hours i guess.   i like ken. like, like. he asked if i drove a silver focus. he saw me and waved, i didnt see him.  i saw a speech by a man called todd savitt today about race medicine and the so called discovery of sickle cell anemia. smart man. it was interesting.   i got a letter from katherine at vagrant today in the mail saying thanks for the resume, were not hiring, we will put it on file. i bet wayne didnt even look at it. thanks for emailing me, guy. and i KNOW rich didnt see it. what am i going to do? deep down i think i thought it would work out out there without me stressing. i was so wrong, huh? master of my own destiny, indeed.  friday is gto and pomeroy.  james what? wed is my 477 test. and i have a paper to do, and i have to work. i dont to even see katie in her bullshit glory, not to mention having her stay here. fuck this. i need help. like lean on me kinds help. who out there has got that thsat isnt causing me grief right now??  tom, yes, uncle tom, goes to trial on thurs for possession of meth. huh. moms going. one good look in the eye will do it, no words necessary. if i was in town, id go too. i wish i was there for her. he cannot bullshit his way out of this one with a "hhheeeeey jude how are ya." she hasnt spoken to him since she told him he had to make the next move in contacting her. that was like 2 or 3 years ago. AND HE IS LIVING IN TOWN, TOO. apparently in a ghetto in riverside. with a trashy lady. so hes producing meth? ask about his KIDS. lizabeth is 18 or 19 now. david is close. he hast seen them in years, either. good good dad.   i wonder if jus and i are going to turn out like that. right now, thanks to amber, he is the tom and i am the jude. i have to call/ email/ etc HIM. always. huh. something to think about.   so i rented the good girl (fuck you very much) and i want to have a nice boy like him of my own. well, minus the drinking and suicide. a thinker. a writer. someone else misunderstood. there is a perfect miserable match out there. here i am. im keeping my eyes out.. find me.  i got my windshield fixed today. insurance covered it. is that the ONLY good thing in my life?

      so much to say, yet so much is unblogable  uhh syd barrett is my hero of the day  no one has eyes like tom hanks in philadelphia. wow.  eddie days "k  thanks for your e-mail.  i know that lance has already responded to it, and that you responded back to his but i figured since you e-mailed me directly i should at least give you a personal response.  first of all, i am always humbled when i hear from fans and friends that 2SJ has inspired or catalyzed something in their lives.  it reaffirms my faith in music and ultimately it is one of the greatest rewards for me as a musician.   as you already know, this will be the last year 2SJ will be an active touring band - it's time to move on and explore new things.  i'm sorry for the fans that the rumours characterize the end of our band as something negative.  sad?  sure, and 'end' often carries with it some bittersweetness, but our decision comes from a desire to move forward as opposed to giving up.  i concede, if we were a multi-platinum act like the backstreet boys, we probably would not be ending our careers, but given our accomplishments, i look at this period as a celebration of an against-all-odds success story.  for 10 years we have defied expectations, worked against the industry mainstream, and most importantly, had our music reach the fans and make an impact - as we did with you!  so, just because we as individuals have decided to seek new experiences, don't let our decision deter your goals in the music industry.  though i feel i must warn you, the music industry is a path rife with moral challenges - it may be difficult to remain true to your principles at times.  good luck!  though our band will gone, the central message of 2SJ - "think for yourself, care about other" - will remain in the music.  and for those fortunate enough to have shared in the live music experience with us - like yourself - the wonderful memory of the magic created at those performances will be carried on forever.  i sincerely hope you'll be at one of our last shows to celebrate what music is meant to be about.  eddie eyeball"   uhhhh huh. me too.

      andy action has proven to be my hero.   this is what he wrote today- my career bible.  amazing man. it is long: a warning.  "K  first off, let it be said that I am honored by your email. you show me great respect, perhaps more than I deserve- but I thank you for your confidence in me as an artist and as someone who works towards what I believe in.  secondly, I want to take a moment to point out that industry needs people like you. it sorely lacks people of your conviction and beliefs. sadly, many start with them, but few remain.  that's one thing that I've learned: if you stick with what you know you love and what you do well, things will happen eventually.   as far as advice, it's funny that you joked about "getting out while you can,"  that's my advice.  this business is not full of good people-  this business eats good people alive. I'll tell you what I always tell kids who ask me if they should get a job or stay in their band- get a job! UNLESS.... you absolutely need to do music. the business doesn't need you- but do you need it? if you do, then do it- do it 100%, and never look back. but if there's something else that you can do that will fulfill you, or if you want to do something that's less cutthroat or treacherous, than do that! by all means, get out while you still can! it ain't a pretty thing.  I'm quite sure that the industry side of things is just as bad, or worse, than it is for bands.  in my experience, people get chewed up and spit out of that meat grinder quicker than bands form and break up...!  now that I've scared you out, let's assume you're going to stay in. it sounds to me like you already have the communication skills, the wording, the etiquette necessary to make it in the biz. that's a skill that can't be taught- plus you've got the degree (soon) to back it up.  that being said, choose a focus. it sounds like you lean towards management or PR.  make relationships. not fake ones, real ones. find people who you like and who you can relate to, and stick with them.  how do you find them? go to where they are: shows, conventions, parties. talk to bands, club owners, promoters, dj's, other people in the biz and ask around to see who works with cool artists that you like and seek to meet them- invite them out for coffee or a meal and ask their advice.  do that all the time and with all of your heart and self. and- most importantly, be the kind of person that they would want to befriend. that, I can't give you advice on except to think about what it is about people you like and nurture that in yourself and your relationships. this is a social business.  go into entrepreneurial-self mode. promote yourself in all ways everywhere all day everyday- online, in person, meeting people in and around the industry- and don't just meet them, get to know them.  the trouble is, I suppose, that you live in Iowa. it goes without saying that all this stuff happens in the major cities- and moving there is a plus, but think of what that means: basically (unless you're independently wealthy- which explains how most of the young people in the industry got there), it means that you'll be starving, sleeping on couches, struggling to pay bills and unable to invite anyone out for coffee, let alone dinner! herein lies the snag:  you must FUND, (read: personally pay for) the first several years of your career in the business.  how? with cash.  there are several ways:  1)get a job that pays (waiting tables, cleaning, anything that's not full time - avoid retail) and pretend that you don't have a job and work/socialize/do the music thing in the off hours (read: never sleep).  2)live at home - no rent, meals sometimes paid for, fewer bills - and pretend that you don't while you work/socialize/do the music thing (read: catch hell from the folks and lose self-respect). 3) invent a scam - i.e. live at a friend's house in exchange for work, live at an office, squat, find a low-cost housing situation (usually involves having relationships in real-estate)- be creative! good luck (read: this is where things usually start getting immoral in the music business- be careful)! 4)get an investor. this is a serious one. just like any small business, you need capital to start up. find a relative, friend, mentor, neighbor, anyone who has money- to invest it in you. make up a business plan and propose it to them... then stick to it (read: "but, I thought I was getting into the music business...").  sound like a lot of work? it is. it fucking sucks. but you know what, any business is like that- if you really want it to work out for you.  one thing that is built into success is sacrifice.  self-sacrifice. if you skip that aspect, you will fail.  another key here is relationships. make them and get comfortable in them-  by email, by phone, in person. all the time. did I mention that?  organization is a virtue as well. create and instate a regime for yourself and apply it to this, and all aspects of your life. I've found that the people in this (and any business) who find success have all their ducks in a row, so to speak...  let me make sure I've addressed your questions directly. Q: does it seem I am on the right track?  -=A: hell yes. now it's time to get to work...  Q: where do you suggest I locate organizations that accept resumes? -=A: find the support teams behind the artists that you like and seek them directly. all these people have email addresses and phone numbers- many of them public. access them and let them know your intentions and seek their advice, approval and perhaps, a job. be prepared to shoulder a huge financial burden yourself as an incentive for them to let you in the door.   Q:  It is hard as hell to find anything where they will happily accept entry level resumes without having some kind of previous connection?  -=A: incredibly. your main assets: your willingness to work for cheap/free and your ability to make everyone around you happy and inspired. that combination cannot fail to get you in the door...  Q: Do you have any suggestions? -=A Did I mention get a job? lol...  Q: Words of wisdom?  -=A: honestly, no   well, a good strong cup of coffee and an afternoon off and there you go! I hope some of this helps- please keep me up to date on what happens and good luck!  -=A  http://www.cardiamusic.com/  ps. if you haven't checked out Cardia yet, take a moment to download the free mp3's. it's the best musical work I've ever done!  pps.

      what ever happened to the mother fucking huxtables?  sometimes the best friends are the one's you can't count on, because there are no strings attatched, and they'll never get clingy, and you'll never be disappointed if they ignore you. you both ignore each other when you need to, and the perfect non-friend will only be available when you want to be, and not be when you're not.  right right? no let down.  people are so pathetic and predictable, and non-individuals nowdays, that "the bandwagon" is now a cavalcade of greyhound busses, full of babbling idiots, who have no clue about anything worth knowing.  i think it's hilarious when assholes tell you that you need better self- esteem. if it wasn't for people like them, it wouldn't even be an issue.  you are correct, sir

      so shit-- i got this from Lance today...Hey K,  First of all, I'm very happy that the band has inspired you in that way.  That's very moving, and we're glad to be a part of it.  Be careful though, it's a shady business.  We calling this the "Farewell National Tour" because it'll probably be the last big national tour we do.  I'm sure we'll do shows here and there after, perhaps even try to release a few more songs or something, but there's no telling.  We simply don't want to just call it a day without warning some people so everyone can come see us and say goodbye.  As far as just throwing in the towel, well, the bands been in the ring for a decade now.  You mentioned a "try it own our own and see if the kids are still there for us."  We've really been doing it on our own over the years, even when we were on major labels, and the kids are the only reason we've survived as long as we have.  We have great loyal fans.  It's just really hard to keep the business side of the band afloat, and as a result, we'll have to change the type of band that we currently are.  We'll have to find other means of income, which means we can't concentrate on music and touring.  But, we are giving it one last shot.  We just finished a new CD that we did on our own, and we're gonna go out on the road and rock.  We'll see what the future holds and what opportunities may come as of that.    Sincerely,  Lance Rockworthy  FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK  my reply:  Lance-         Thanks for the note- that means a lot. You are more than right in saying it is a shady business- that is what scares me so much about wanting to work within it. While my motivations are noble- merely wanting the best for those I believe in, spreading the word on sounds I dig, and the pure love of rock, I sadly feel myself to be a minority. The 'cheaters never win' theory doesn't apply to a business who's main objective is make the cash by whoring flash-in-the-pan bands out for their fifteen minutes of fame.  I interned out in LA (uuggh) at Vagrant Records this summer, and while their intentions seemed rather respectable, it is simple to see how things can quickly spiral out of control.          I guess if you are willing to compromise your ideals and exploit the hell out of people who are trying to break even doing that they love, it is the business for you. Tragic, really.          Anyway I hope I didn't come off wrong before, I certainly am more than supportive... I have been there since what, 1996? Regardless, I know you guys have been busting your asses over the years, and I hope you realize that most legit Skinnee fans know of and appreciate all you have done.          I anticipate the release of the record-- my roommates and I were giddy as hell while pre-ordering the thing. I am more than proud of you guys for pushing on for as long as you have despite much corporate bullshit- that shows a dedication and spirit that is really hard to find these days. I do offer you a big thank you high five for everything you guys have done over the years, and thank you for setting the record straight for me.          The whole idea that situations such as these happen surely can make a girl question why the hell she wants to offer herself to the industry demons. But hell, some things cannot change unless someone puts their ass on the line to speak on the way things should be.  I guess that comes down to me either A. finding people who share my beliefs and scraping by or B. getting eaten alive.          In a perfect world I would be there working on radio, street and retail promotion for you guys full time- that is something I would feel comfortable putting my heart into. If there is a single thing I can do to help you guys out- before, during, after the big tour, please let me know. (And I am not merely being polite, I mean it. Seriously, let me know.) I am here to help. While the idea of not having the J's active brings a tear to my eye, I trust you guys will rock out for as long as your hearts can take it. Real rockers don't fade away. Thanks again for letting me know what's going on, and please keep in touch. You have yourself a great tour- and my love to the rest of the guys. I hope to see you out here sometime soon... -=K  i mean evey word.

      FFFFFFUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCKKKKKK  YYYYYOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUI am so fucking pissed because I KNOW that if I didn�t say anything to you before you left I would have to do it all over again. You are the only one to have ever �got on your fucking hands and knees and scrubbed it� MY ASS. I did in January. (oh, you correct yourself, you did it after me no matter what. How convenient.) bitch, everything is a competition. I need to realize I am not the only one doing it around here? WHAT??	 BECAUSE YOU SCRUBBED THE FLOOR (ALLEDGEDLY) ONCE OVER CHRISTMAS? Since then I have cleaned the bathroom three times. Vacuumed twice. Taken the bathroom trash out, well I don�t know how many times but I do know I was the only (ONLY) one to do it. I clean up other peoples shit nearly every single day. Your snide fucking cut off note in the trash- why that was nice. It read you would take the cans back b/c you�re the only one TO EVER DO IT ANYWAYS. Wow that�s funny, because you have NEVER taken them back without me until yesterday. Amazing. You don�t have the time to do any work with your 20 hour a week job and 12 credits (3 being bio 101? Come the fuck on...) Shit. I have the 20 hours a week and 20 count �em, 20 credits. And they are adult upper level credits nonetheless. Take some time from drinking your ass off and being an ass with jeff and bingo, you have time. It is called adult responsibility, and soon it will hit you in the face. You are the most passive aggressive person I know and I whole-heartedly disrespect you for that. You would never in a million years sprout the balls to say something you meant, but a fucking bitchy note you throw away certainly tells me what you think of amber and I in your head. Cocky, are you? To say the fucking least. You were upset that amber mentioned growing up and not wanting to leave us behind. I have come to the conclusion today that you feel you have already done that, you are already on a different level. Wow, if I could pick anyone to claim as I immature and behind, honey you�re it. Emotionally and realistically. Who do you think you are? What in the name of fucking god makes you think you are better than anyone? Especially in this house? I like amber more and more everyday because she at least has the balls to openly be who she is and not front on a thousand different levels. Ma and pa, I am sure, have this colored view of you as well. You do allll the cleaning, miss responsible. Right you do. You have all the answers when it comes to people, real or not, who have issues in their life but when they face you- you evade them like a little girl. I cannot believe it�. I never thought I would have so much disrespect. You tell me not to yell at YOU for what ambers not going to do, but that is not even the fucking issue. Ask the ulcer in my stomach right fucking now. The issue is communication and responsibility. You can�t handle either. As long as things see lovely you are OK. Wow, and you are going out into the real world? Thank god you have someone to depend on, I know you won�t be able to do it on your own. It takes a strong person to do that, dear, and strong you aint. Did you write this last night? Did you act like a fucking fronted nice girl to me last night while inside thinking of how this house would crumble without you cleaning the floor that one day months ago and how you thankfully always take the cans back? (Thanks for pocketing the money, bitch, from all the beer cans I paid for and you drank as always. See how times, they are a�changin�?) Graduation could NOT come too soon. If I could once, ONCE tell you what I really was thinking. When I get up and walk out of a room, do you know why that is? Gee. I want to punch you. Jesse, you know how I feel about him. It is funny I have always seen a number of those factors portrayed in you. Really. The way you both always feel the need to one up everything no matter how fucking dumb it is. Yep. The way you both act like you are kidding until you say something really fucking mean and everyone knows youre not. You know how you always say you don�t know how to give people shit? You know EXACTLY	what you are doing. It is sickening. Right now I would be happiest if I didn�t have to see you until you came back from your stupid unplanned money wasting trip to ca. really. Its fucking dumb and I need a break from your shit. Ill do the fucking cleaning if I don�t have to talk to you. Now go complain to jeff and mommy and daddy about how what you do is so underappreciated and you just DON�T need this right now. They are caught in your little web and will buy into all that shit. In the meantime, don�t ewat my food, use my things, print when I ask you not to, use my computer, get on my internet, or try and ask interested in order to maintain a �nice girl� front. Im not having it.

"heya K,  glad you're still in. Cardia just got picked up by a small indie called SilverThree records.  you should contact Mike Harbin (harbin@silverthree.com) and ask if he's looking to hire someone for pr/promo/artist development.  they're based out of Falls Church, VA- a suburb of DC.   I can't imagine someone more valuable on the team and I would feel great having someone like you on board . I can't imagine they have a lot of money to throw around, but their motives and intentions seem similar to yours. if you're into it, I'll talk to Mike about you.  now that's what I call putting my money where my mouth is! just thinkin',  -=A"  i love people who believe in me, and help me along rather than competing with me.   L oozes that. from parking spaces to grades to jobs to who is more ill to who is more tired... whats your deal... you will get a honest dose of reality soon, babycakes.  and an offer to send my resume out to Paramont? uhh ok sure. hit me with the digits.  am i half as lame as i sound? :)

LISTENING TO THE MISSLES ON THE RADIO WHEN YOU WERE 12? WATCHING THE GREEN ON BLACK NIGHT-VISION TELECASTS? THE MASS DEATHS OF HARMLESS MIDDLE EASTERN MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN? REMEMBER BEING SICK TO YOUR STOMACH OVER IT?  WELL TAKE THAT X50.... ADD IN NUKES, MOABS, CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS, AND ACTUAL USA MAINLAND PENETRATION BY IRAQI ALLIE FORCES AND YOU ARE CAUGHT UP. PLUS WE ARE RULED BY A COWBOY WITH A VENDETA AND LOVE 'O' OIL.  SAD.  andy writes yesterday: heya kristin,  don't despair- spring break in iowa can be a blast! with a few carefully placed movies, bottles of wine, sleeping in a few times and the hints of springtime, combined with the knowledge that you're actively forwarding your future by staying on top of your career (while your peers are killing brain cells and getting skin cancer) should make for a wonderful vacation! enjoy~! -=A

      I CAN GET ON TODAY! WOO!  here are the posts from last night and today that i couldnt post  1 Supposedly when a person dreams about another, you're on an astral plane with them. Sort of like ESP. If you believe in that stuff. Which I do. It doesn't mean it's sexual in nature. It's just that you're somewhere working something out with that person.   you think? i think maybe i buy this..... does he?   aaaaaand  2  To do  * Talk to him.  * Get sleep.   * Resume Resume Resume. Mail them suckas out.  * Figure out what it is that I really want to do with my life.  * Take SoCal by storm  * Conquer the vast, unexplored territory of what it means to actually love.  * Win the game on my own terms.  * To hold hands with [insert lucky boy's name here] for purposes other than crossing the street or squaredancing.  Yep Yep  3 lastly, huge out with GTO last night, just me and them... met two nice girls from dsm. met james' woman (typical) and bonded with the three of em. curt had brought me a cd of his solo stuff and went tout to the van to get it and he had forgot it in the hotel. sad. but hes maing it. yeah. woohoo. he played maybe 30 mins of solo stuff after their set. there were maybe 20 people at Peoples last night, everyone was at spring break. so they played the a song and wild like trees for me, although grubb noticed i couldnt hear wild like trees cuz some drunk fuck was talking my ear off. did you know james has a weekly paper route for $50 to make cash? ha  also went to catholic school. us catholic kids.  ok to sleep.... driving to siouxland in the morning.... 830. im excited. :)

      so 2 nights ago i dreamed jus died, funeral and all. last night i drempt jonathan passed on.... funeral and all.   interpretation says  i am either INSANE or as follows:  looks like i put the FUN in Funeral   To dream of a funeral  A dream of contrary. To see or attend a funeral in your dream signifies cause for a happy celebration, probably news of an engagement or wedding; to dream of attending your own funeral indicates a relief from worry.    To dream of death  If you dreamed of being dead yourself, it indicates an approaching release from all your worries and/or a recovery from illness. If you spoke with someone who is dead, you will soon hear very good news. To dream of a death frequently signifies news of a birth. To be aware of a dead person you cannot identify portends an inheritance which may not be personal but could be indirectly beneficial.    Snow  This is a generally good omen. To dream of deep snow or of a snowstorm signifies hard work but with an unexpected big success at the end.  so i registered- looks like im taking   soc 340, deviant and criminal behavior eng 313, writing for the world wide web eng 335, film AND ent 210, intro to insects  this equals 10 credits and GRADUATION! WHEEE!  ALSO  so the first reply i have received from the batch of resumes sent out last week came from revelation records.... in huntington beach. the LADY was way chill about it- she was flattered by my cover letter (although i dont know how that is.) anyway she says they have a policy of not hiring kids from out of state cuz they have been flaked on and fucked in the past- but that was before she was aware i was there this summer and had intentions of moving west regardless. sooo...... its a sXe hardcore label.... do i fit in there???  :) huh.

      check this    I watch this insane world claw at me through it's television portals and use it's media ropes to try to tether around my neck. Your society suffocates me beyond belief and it makes me wonder why more postal workers haven't snapped by now and blown up a bus full of nuns.   Your 2 faced moral society sickens me with your Barbie doll wanna-be's telling amerika to "just be yourself" while their ken doll, plastic mold boyfriends take them out to eat at restaurants that need reservations on a fucking MONDAY NIGHT for fuck's sake! There they spend hundreds of dollars to eat aesthetically-pleasing-to-the-eye (artsy fartsy looking) food that wouldn't fill a fuckin caterpillar let alone their 110 lbs anorexic asses.   And then I turn around and I proceed stare this godless god-fearing society right in the face when I watch this chatter box on my nightstand. Every other second is a commercial product trying to shove itself down my throat by explaining to me that it's the new "hip thing".   I must go out and buy your Mountain Dew 'Code Barf' product because it's hip to the black man in your commercial. .   I must go out and purchase a cellular pager phone because some skinny lookin' kalifornia cunt cops an attitude with her boyfriend after he misses his train and she just doesn't have time in her busy ("what-ever") life to wait on him. .   I must go out and buy your taco products, your cola products, your shirts, your shoes, your 1-800-FUCKING-COLLECT because Michael Jordan or Carrot Top say it's A-OK.   Do they think I'm that fucking stupid? Well, obviously there are a lot of gullible morons in the world, but I don't need a fucking celebrity to tell me what's right. Some of us assholes have enough insight to see through the plexiglas fake smiles you portray while you whore your already sold souls to the biggest rapist of this fucked up nation ... big business.    You want to know why amerikan kids are fucked up? It's because you force feed them garbage and expect them to like it.  The argument to this is ... "well, they all seem to buy it, so it must work!"   When you feed a cat or a dog some shitty, smelly pet food, what do they do?  They eat it.  Why?  BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THEY GET FED!   If you bring a steak or burger around a cat or dog, what do they do?  They drool They whimper They rub against your leg in short...  THEY BEG LIKE HELL   They know where the good shit is. They know it's taste, it's smell, it's feel.   And we're exactly the same. We know the good shit, but most of us have been fed such bullshit for so long that we're too caught up in the world's trivial crapola to realize that we're being fed fuckin GARBAGE.    Case and point:   Scaturday Night Live   How the fuck, after 25 years, can people keep watching these over rated, wanna-be comedians turned hopeful actors, walk on stage and blatantly read every line from a cue card while staring off to the side instead of where they're supposed to be? Are they so fuckin lazy they can't memorize a script? Or are the writers so fuckin lazy they can't come up with something good earlier in the week? Regardless of either case, Scaturday Night Live drivel has persisted for 20 years too many.  And why is it still on the air?  BECAUSE YOU ASSHOLES KEEP WATCHING IT.   Turn your fuckin TVs off. Stop going to shitty movies like "Dude, Where's My Car" or "Get Over It". The days of stupid-heroes-gone-famous went out with Bill and Ted and Beavis and Butthead. GIVE IT A REST!   If you keep letting this shit seep into your brains you will become what they want you to be .. spineless, money spending, gag-line vomiting morons ... the people who constantly piss me off.   And ya know what's sad? No matter what I say or do, no matter what *you* say or do, and no matter what anyone does ... the majority will always be mindless, worthless, denial-ridden sheep who'll keep buying corporate logo t-shirts because their favorite sports figure tells them to. They'll keep buying tit jobs or throwing up their tofu lunch or jogging until they pass out from constant dehydration because they want a better self esteem and they'll keep going to see shitty movies because the supposed critics and "experts" say "two thumbs up!".  And people wonder why I'm misanthropic.   AGREED?

      could there be a worse feeling? mom called today and left a message... apparently a guy from a record label called for me in SC yesterday and got my number here. turns out stupid dumb fuck me replaced the 2 with a 5 leaving all 50 labels with the wrong goddamn phone number.   an upside, if there could be one... it is correct on the cover letter-- and i can send a "hey remember me" letter next week.... with a correction.... still.   i blew it. the biggest and most harmful mistake i have made. who would try and call me, get an out of service and track me down in SC only to learn i fucked up hardcore only to call me again on the right number? no one. a fuck up like that can turn a person against you. you look lazy. incomplete. slacker. no attention to detail. suck suck suck.  NO ONE.

      fuck went out with emily and L (and J who wasnt invited) tonight  uhh aaron got hired to intern at vagrant today. hes having a party friday. maybe i can get *him* to go to it?? :)  mmm so here is what i heard from MIKE HARBIN #1 Hi K, Thanks for writing! Where are you going to school? Unfortunately, we are in no position to hire a full-time employee. The label is currently 4 people working out of our house - we all work day jobs and do the label work in the evenings and on weekends. We have discussed getting an intern - not sure if you'd be interested in that a few hours a week. I'd imagine not if it involves a relocation!  We're hoping that this eventually turns into a full-time endeavor and that will someday expand and be able to hire on others - in which case, we'll keep you top of the list! I might be able to point you in the direction of others to check in with - are you in New York? Thanks again and take care. Mike silverthree   #2 Hi K, Iowa?! Is that in Ames? Burning Airlines played in Iowa once.  Thanks for the compliment - now you're definitely top of the list if  we're ever able to hire on someone. That's cool you worked with Vagrant. They're obviously a much  bigger operation than us and they're financially backed by a major  label. We are paying for the label with income from our day jobs. Seems New York or LA are really the places to be for working at a  label.  Would Roadrunner interest you? I have a friend there that I  could put you in touch with.  Would you be interested in spreading the Silverthree word in  Iowa? We have some postcards and stickers I could send you to  put in any cool clubs or record stores. Let me know - we'd certainly  appreciate it! Take care. Mike   nice man. speaking of, andy writes heya k,  I'm sorry about the situation with SilverThree- oh well! it was worth a shot...! anyways, I'd love to talk to you about the Cardia Street Team and your position on it. is that something you're interested in and or/have time for?  let's talk soon - IM, maybe?  hope you are well, -=A   THIS HAS TURNED INTO A DOCUMENTATION OF MY FUCKING CAREER SEARCH AND COMEMORATIVE EMAILS. WOW.

      life is hard.  really hard.  i need to get happy.  there doesnt seem to be a reason to.  horoscope says Take control of your power today and set yourself up on a runway of success, K. Realize, however, that the most efficient wings are the ones that are carefully trimmed. Strip away any excess baggage in your life. Things are coming to a critical climax at this time. This is not a time to back down. If anything, it is a time to push the limits even further. Look to the future with the same eyes you did as a child. Rid yourself of that which jades your thinking and clouds your mind.  am i getting an ulcer?  sadsadsad  things need to change

      the saga of my life  here is what has gone on between dad and i  #1 I SAY have some words for you and they are serious. read slowly, for i mean it ALL.   well, dad, you blew it. you knew what you had to do. the few weeks and the feeble attempt you made at being a good husband was not enough. it is too bad you never gave being a good father a shot. it amazes me mom lasted this long, with you living in the basement and showing the tv and duke more attention and respect.   maybe jus may still be there for you on occasion i sure as hell can tell you this: you have not given a shit about me since i was 12, when i started to defend myself and tell you what was on my mind... and i certainly have not respected a word you have said or a thing you have done since i was 12 and you told mom to "shut her mouth while she was still your wife."   (wow, kids remember that kind of thing? well you have no idea.)  i guess it comes down to this: there is nothing for YOU to be angry about. if you are being bitter and rude to mom (as history shows me you probably are, as usual) for doing something i would have years ago, i would quit. grow up and take responsibility and feel bad for what you put people through. ulcers for christ sake. having the courage to make herself happy for the first time in years is commendable you are nothing but selfish.   there are other people in the world, and imagine how much it takes to push them all away. for example- i am supposed to love you and mom more than about anyone. i do love mom, more than she knows... but you have never given me a reason to love you. if anything, you make it fucking impossible. ive tried, dad, but if those closest to you cant love you, maybe its time to reevaluate yourself. if anything, you should  be regretful. maybe now you know what it feels like to not be cared about by someone who is SUPPOSED to care the most. this is what i have felt like with you for 10 years.... and i stopped caring and accepted the fact you weren't going to change years ago.  i hope you realize how serious this is...  you could have prevented it. and when it comes to your relationship with me, well, it would have been nice to have the father be the adult in the relationship for once, but i gave up hope on that. you have a lot to learn, and maybe someday you'll care enough to open your eyes and see you are a very unpleasant person.  as it stands, i really dont want to see you anymore, which i am sure is more than ok with you, seems you care more about me checking my goddamn oil than anything else. you have only seen me after age 18 because of mom. (how many times have you talked to me on the phone from school? NONE. how many times did you call me in CA? NONE. how many times have you asked me about school or showed any support for actually graduating? NONE. how many times have you asked about work? NONE. how many times have you acted concerned? NONE. supportive? NONE. called me on my birthday? NONE. told me you loved me? NONE. how many times have you asked me about my career search? NONE. told me you were proud? NONE. how many times have you asked me how i was or if i was ok or what i was up to? NONE. how many times have you acted like a father, minus letting me live in your house? humm... NONE.)  those figures dont lie.  and dont bother starting now. things are a lot clearer in hindsight, huh?  i am a lot smarter than you would like to give me credit for... sad. i pray to god i am never half as self centered as you. and of you dont have anything mature to say to me, do not even respond. do, however, take every damn word i said to heart.  good luck and goodbye  k  #1 HE REPLIES   K,  What everyone needs to undertand, I have never had anything but love for my wife and my family in my heart.  I may not be good at showing it but I have had no help in showing it.  I'm a good man who has had made mistakes but never anything to deserve the sort of treatment and disreguard for my fealings and my efforts to do the best I can.  All I ever wanted was the "woman" I married and to raise a good, loving family and I have had my heart ripped out for doing so.  I mad a great effort and still would to make this marriage work but I can't do it by my self.  You say I could have prevented it, I was the only one trying to prevent it.  As for calling you, think about it, I can only stand being told how little you care about me so many times.  Every time I tried to be a father I caught hell from everyone.  You learn to sevive the best you can and hope the scars will heal.  Remenber this, I love you all and did the best I could.  Love, Dad  #2 I SAY   funny how you try to make this out to be moms fault for not trying. right. with that alone my respect for anything you might say plumits. she gave you a second chance when i never would have, and you didnt change a bit.  you knew you had to start showing people you gave a shit. you did not.  you say you had no help in showing it- guess what dad- YOU ARE THE ADULT. YOU ARE THE FATHER. in the case between you and i, you never once tried to act like it. you never apoligized for being an ass towards me. you never made an attempt. do you know what that does? pushes people away. so you have discovered.   you need to quit feeling sorry for yourself, because that is all this entire letter is, self pity. no, i dont feel bad for you. think about it- i have seen the way other familys operate and it seems like i have not had a dad since i was 12. it is funny- when other people start to notice and point it out, you know its not all in your head.  you say "I may not be good at showing it but I have had no help in showing it." like i said, you cant pass the buck on this one. youve treated me like shit. YOU are the father. please.  you say "I'm a good man who has had made mistakes but never anything to deserve the sort of treatment and disreguard for my fealings and my efforts to do the best I can." to this i say BULLSHIT. tell me why someone deserves to be in your life if all they do is criticize you and have total disregard for your relationship? you do not realize what you consider a few mistakes add up to 10 years of agony. of not wanting to be at home. of you sitting on your ass in the basement and the rest of the family being upstairs-- away from you-- to avoid the unpleasantness. tell me one way you have shown mom you love her in the last 10 years that was not inspired by the thoughts of her leaving you? and even tougher, show me one way you have shown me you have loved me? exactly. you are passively agressively blaming me for this, saying "As for calling you, think about it, I can only stand being told how little you care about me so many times.  Every time I tried to be a father I caught hell from everyone.  You learn to sevive the best you can and hope the scars will heal." when did you try to be a father? and when did you cetch hell for it? ASKING ME ABOUT MY OIL EVERY TWO WEEKS IS SOMETHING A STRANGER COULD DO. horrible attempt, if you ask me. you say you learn to survive the best you can and hope the scars will heal- well guess what dad, thats what i have been doing since i was 12-- and god only knows how long it has been for mom-- A LONG TIME. this is what i mean. take responsibility and quit being so selfish. maybe what you are feeling now is a small part of what we have felt for so long.  other peoples dads show seem to care about me more than you. strangers are nicer to mom that you. is it sinking in yet? you say "I made a great effort and still would to make this marriage work but I can't do it by my self. and I could have prevented it, I was the only one trying to prevent it." guess what dad- im not blind, nor deaf. the effort you made was both weak and shortlasting. you were "a tolerable person" for a few weeks. over thanksgiving, everything was back to normal. same at christmas, and especially over spring break. you will never change, and you KNOW that is what you had to do. you think you were the only one trying to prevent this? you have never been so wrong. mom gave you 6 months to see if giving you the rest of her life would be worth it. and you proved it wasnt. and to think i defended you! i actually thought you would pull your head out of your ass and see the light and take responsibility. you did not.   "All I ever wanted was the "woman" I married and to raise a good, loving family and I have had my heart ripped out for doing so." WHAT DO YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE WAY YOUR FAMILY HAS TURNED OUT? WHAT DO YOU KNOW???????? NOTHING. SO DO NOT FEED ME THESE LINES. IT SOUNDS GREAT, BUT IS TOTAL BULLSHIT. YOU WOULD HAVE TRIED TO BE A DAD RATHER THAN A BIOLOGICAL FATHER IF YOU CARED. YOU, AS AN ADULT,  WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT ME, AS A CHILD, GIVING UP ON YOU WAS A SIGN TO TRY HARDER. YOU CANT BLAME ME FOR THIS ONE, I WAS A KID. IVE GROWN UP, THINGS ARE A LOT CLEARER NOW, AND THE FEELINGS STILL STAND. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT NOW I HOLD  A WHOLE OTHER KIND OF PAIN IN THINKING THAT A FATHER WOULD ACTUALLY SEE HIS DAUGHTER WAS SATRTING TO HATE HIM AND NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. YOU DIDNT.   you say "Remenber this, I love you all and did the best I could." to this, i also disagree. being on your guard and trying to be pleasant on occasion is not the best you could. you more nicer to strangers on the street.   looks to me like you have a lot of thinking to do. and even more to realize.  quit blaming. its juvenile. dont fool yourself in thinking "oh i was a great father and husband, they mysu be making these years of misory up."  remember what i said about dying alone if things didnt change? well dad that was 7 months ago. what have you done to change it? exactly  #2 HE REPLIES  When I said I would try to change I was completely serious and I remain completely serious.  I made to jump to seeing a professional if that would help.  I need help.  I can't just know what to do because everyone watches me swim around in a fish bowl while I start to sink to the bottom.  It's the people that mean everything to me that I need help from.  Every bad encounter was not one sided, my pain, my hurt is and was as deep as antone elses.  I lash out the same as you when I get hurt.  This does not make it right but that is still what happens.  I'm a good, compassionate God fearing man who raised childen to be the same the best way I knew.  I will be the first to admit that my aggressive ways were not right but it was the only tool I knew how to use.  It has not been easy for me to struggle raising a family with all the ups and downs in my life.  I dont mean to make any of this sould like excuses, its not.  I just want you to understand whats in my heart and what comes out of my mouth are always the same thing when involved with the stress of an argument.  No matter what has happened in the past, don't ever think I was anything but proud of the person you have become and I do love you all.  Dad  #3 I SAY   guess what dad, if people honestly want to change, they will. you had years to do it. we all put up with you for that long. did you see me telling you any of this when i was 18? no. i gave you a shot. things remained the same. you didnt change. seven months is so long, but like i said--- when i saw you over thanksgiving, nothing was different. and that was only a couple months later. change, my ass. what a weak attempt.  everyone has problems. right now i am under more stress with school and work and finding a job and THIS BULLSHIT than i have ever been under before. for the last 4 years my schedule has been class all day work all night. 8am-12am is a awful schedule. did you see me taking it out on everyone around me??? NO. and you always have. always.   dont act like we didnt give you a chance. no matter what else was going on in your life family was SUPPOSED to be #1 and from what i have experienced, we were in last place.   look at mom-- look at all that she has been through-- her past, and all the bullshit she tolerated from you. she needed a stable happy family experience, one she lacked growing up-- and you could not even try to give her that.   face it: she raised us by herself. BY HERSELF. did you ever lift a finger? drive us around? help with school? give a shit? the list could go on and on and on.....  the truth hurts, doesnt it dad.  i did turn out good-- way better than one would have figured considering that half of my parental unit would hardly speak to me in my formative to adult years. i credit mom to keeping me sane.  your ups and downs..... what about moms? you are not supportive to her in one bit. NOT... ONE... BIT.  you say you would try to change. well you had your shot, nothing was different. giving mom flowers for a week to win her affections doesnt not cut it, for it soon went back to the same old mike crap. of course you are adament right now of wanting to change: it is sinking in, we all were not kidding. dad- the way things have been with you have inevitably fucked up my life, made mom miserable-- and "wanting to change" is not good enough. just do it already, if you care. thats all it comes down to. i do not want to hear any more excuses, or anymore "i need help." you had your chance. years of chances.  a real father would have been concerned when their kids and wife started to fade away from them. i honestly dont think i have seen love between you and mom for YEARS.   an apology would be a start. to mom. quit trying to make people feel bad for you. that is almost offensive. it makes me, and i am sure mom feel like you do not begin to fathom the way you have hurt us and have been over the last 10 years. funny, i have fought with mom as well.... but SHE cares about me. she wasnt an asshole 90% of the time. she didnt try to make me pack my bags and move out at the age of 13 for "being a primadonna" like you did. (yeah, the log of times you were a jerk to me is a mile and a half long.)  i know every encounter was not one sided, but who is the "father?" you. the instigator? you. who is the quick tempered one with the look of evil in their eyes when things dont go exactly their way? you. who is always right no matter how wrong? you. people tire of it, and tire of it quick.  if you are the god fearing man you proclaim to be, id start the repenting and start it quick. you have made the lives of the people you claim to love miserable. let that word soak in dad. dozens of times between 92-present i have pleaded with mom to just leave you, for you were nothing but mean, angry, over aggressive and demeaning. destructive would be a good word.  she didnt. she gave you chance after chance to change. time ran out.  other people noticed this dad, and that is humiliating. your own brothers and sisters have even discussed it with me. what is your problem? why do you talk me like im an idiot? why are you such a smartass? why do you never do any family stuff? they all ask me...... my response? i dont know. i just dont care anymore. if you spent a fraction of the time you spent wandering around in the woods on your family things would be fine right now.  if it were not for mom, you would never see me. to be clear, anything that is mine is leaving with mom. i sure will miss duke.   you need to go talk to someone. without mom, because she does not deserve to suffer and be unhappy anymore. you need to take time to work on you. let me tell you, you need it.   if you are adult enough to admit you do need to do this- then maybe i will begin to respect what you have to say. right now, it is painfully hard, if not impossible to do.  you need to admit to mom you have not been a good husband. but first you need to admit this to yourself. you act as if she just up and decided she didnt care anymore. this could not be further from the truth. listening to her cry to me from three hours away, saying she just cant live like this anymore kills me. you need to look past how YOU are affected and see what is coming of everyone else, because the misery is YOUR fault.   no problem you have had in your life could measure up to what you have done here.  you want to know an example of a fatherly thing to do? you were within 30 minutes of my house a few weekends ago. thanks for stopping in for dinner or something. (ps that is not an invitation. if i saw you right now id punch you.) my point is this: i have roommates who's parents drive 2 hours out of their traveling paths to stop in and take them out to lunch. my dad cant sign his own name on my birthday card.  you are trying to change, my ass.  old habits die hard, and you are too damn stubbern to ever admit that. you will always be a miserable person. you will never be happy. 85% of the world has lives well worse than yours, but you are so pissed off all the time all you do is take it out on other people.  no one will ever want to be around you again if that does not stop. EVER.  do not ever EVER express in words what you cannot express in actions. do not say you care about me until you show it. do not say you love any of us until you show it. do not make any more excuses. do not mention "wanting to change" again until you put some goddamn effort into it. words do not mean shit right now, dad.   you have a lot of time to make up for. A LOT.   my prayers are with mom. she needs to leave for HER own mental, emotional, physical and spiritual health. dont make it any worse for her  k

      life is hard  too hard to be profound right now  today i finished a 15 page jlmc paper a 5 page soc paper a 4 page anthro paper  and 2 2 page soc papers  GAWD  anyway things with ma and pa are as tough as always. "Please worry about yourself right now, not us.  Lord knows I wish I could have shielded you guys from this but I never was in control of any of this.  We love you and we know you are trying to help, that's all you can do.  I will need to work this thing out the best I can but I don't want to drag you down with me.  Take care of things in your life and please stay in contact when you can.  Love, Dad"  what????????????  i feel like shit cuz of all thats going on  stress kills  SONG OF MY LIFE? Sunrise, Sunset. Sunrise, sunset. Sunrise, sunset. Swiftly go the days. Sunrise, sunset. You wake up, then you  undress. It always is the same. A sunrise and a sunset. You are lying while you confess, keep  trying to explain. The sunrise and the sun sets you realize and then you forget what you have  been trying to retain. But everybody knows that it is all about the things that get stuck inside of  your head, like the songs your roommate sings or a vision of her body as she stretches out on  your bed. She raised her hands in the air and asked you, When was the last time you looked in  the mirror? Because you have changed. Yeah, you have changed. Sunrise, sunset. You are  hopeful and then you regret. The circle never breaks. With each sunrise and sunset there is a  change of heart or address. Is there nothing that remains? For a sunrise or a sunset. You are  manic or you�re depressed. Will you ever feel ok? It�s a sunrise and sunset, your lover is an  actress. Did you really think she would stay? For a sunrise and sunset. You are either coming  or you just left but you are always on the way. Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a  sonnet. They are really just the same. To the sunrise and the sunset. The master and his  servant have exactly the same fate. It�s a sunrise and a sunset. From a cradle to a casket.  There ain�t no way to escape. The sunrise and the sunset. Hold your sadness like a puppet, just  keep putting on the play. But everything you do is leading to the point where you just won�t know  what to do. And at that moment you may laugh but there is someone there who will be laughing  louder than you. So it�s true, the trick is complete. Now you have become everything you said  that you never would be. You�re a fool! You�re a fool! Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset. The  sunrise and the sunset. Sunrise, sunset. Go home to your apartment and put the cassette in the  tape deck and let that fever play. Sunrise, sunset. Where are you Arienette? Where are you  Arienette?

      blahblahblah  finals, schminals  i don't know if anyone knows what i mean when i say this, but does it ever feel like your world has abruptly flipped? like, completely overturned in a matter of days? i feel so detached.  folks can do that to ya.  this isn't happening. this isn't real. nothing is real. it doesn't feel real. this is right. this is wrong.  fuck. i'm so out of it right now, i don't ever know what the fuck i'm writing about. 	 even though i know i'm different than i was then, there are still parts of me that want to be someone's everything girl. i've felt like a letdown all my life. seriously, you wouldn't think it and you wouldn't know it (even the closest to me don't know it) because i hide it well. there is nothing monumental in my life that makes me feel accomplished, that makes me feel like i'm not just taking up other's space and air. i've always wanted to do something different for someone else, something that no one could ever do before.  i don't know what's happened to me, how i've become this anti-social hermit who only leaves the house for a select few. surely there must be a way to patch everything up inside to make everything come out the right way on the outside. i'm tired of feeling like this confused mess. there's so much i keep from everyone. there's so little i tell even the closest. i'm constantly afraid of decisions in the past that i've made (which is why i never speak of them. i already think poorly enough of myself). i have a thousand heavy skeletons inside the little black box that is my heart. over the years i've attempted to bury it, only to find myself digging it up to add another corpse to it. it's a vicious cycle, my secret little world. 	 iamanemokid says  i've decided that everyone, men, women, children, single celled organisms, should have a menstrual cycle at least once in their lives, so that everyone may know what it's like to bleed for 5-7 days and not die. it's like torture. so, when i become president of the world, it will be manditory that everyone/thing on the planet will have to bleed for 5-7 days. 	 word.	  there's nothing more frightening than large groups of bleached blond haired, painted toe nailed, oranged skinned, boobs popping out of their shirts, saying snotty things sorority girls. 	 	 severe thunderstorn warning.

      I am an oxymoron. I am an extroverted introvert. I am modestly immodest. I am democratically republican, or is it republicanly democratic? I am insecurely confident. I am actively lazy. I am brilliantly retarded.  	 	  I have fantasies like Ally McBeal  Standing behind you I had an odd fantasy Licked your neck-like Ally  We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies�all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes.   name that book  and......  ...on the Limits of Human Perspective  I've become increasingly frustrated lately over the limits of my perception. I mean, as a human, I have this built in limit to my perception. For the average human, clear mental vision is limited to the here and now. We cannot be more than vague about what's happening in the next room or even what was happening in the current place an hour before he/she arrived there. Our memories are for the most part a fog in which we see things semi-randomly float past. Our futures lay over the horizon... we may have an idea what's over the hill, but we can never know for sure until we are actually there. Now, I say that these are the limits of the average human because some people have acute perception of the past or future or of other places. But even then, I don't think there are people who have vision in all directions. It's usually just one or the other, and even then it's not perfect vision. It's splotchy. You may have noticed that our 5 senses are all here and now type senses. For example, I can see only what is currently happening. This is the limitation placed on my eyes, to the present time and place. This could be the reason that we cannot see in other directions, other ways. This makes much sense to me, and therefore it will be my conclusion until such time as I have something to add to it or replace it. I believe it's that simple. Our brain is overwhelmed by the present and therefore has a hazy view of the fog. Well, I'm going to make it a personal goal to learn how to better peer into the fog, even if there's only minimal results.  --credit to the guy--   N.L.A.

A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle, So I turned to run, The thought of all the stupid things I've done, I never meant to cause you trouble, And I never meant to do you wrong, And I, well if I ever caused you trouble, Oh no, I never meant to do you harm. Oh no I see, A spider web and it's me in the middle, So I twist and turn, Here I am in my little bubble, Singing, I never meant to cause you trouble, I never meant to do you wrong, And I, well if I ever caused you trouble, Oh no, I never meant to do you harm.

      there is a storm a'brewin. hot..  id love to wake up to the sound of rain on a tin roof too  I'm so tired of so many people being special to me. I'm ready to feel I'm really special to someone else.   I'm so tired of putting so much of myself and energy into friendships that don't go anywhere. I'm ready to grow in someone's life. Like an Oak Tree.   I'm so tired of spending my nights alone. Again. I'm ready to have those "laugh all night till your belly aches and your cheeks hurt" nights where you finally get in bed WAY later than you should, yet you wake up the next morning refreshed and so alive because that person is indeed in your life.   I'm so tired of feeling empty and having that continuous feeling like I'm searching for something. I'm ready to feel complete and fulfilled and found.   I'm so tired of crying. So tired of not letting myself cry. I'm ready to just drop that last tear and be done.

      im starting to wonder more and more about alex... turns out her buddy jeff she introduced me to, that happens to be from my hometown, was a customer at hastings.... he came through her line and she thought he was a looker so looked him up in the computer and called him... uhh i dont know if stalking is ok.  got an email at work today from chad... he was finally assigned his own store somewhere in IL. hes happy, so good for him.  good story- so we were at peoples last night seeing GTO play... and we think jeff was slipped a roofie. he only had 4 beers between like 9-2 and by 1 he has falling down and delirious he had no idea what was going on. long story short a guy was kicking the shit out of jeff and humping him from behind during pomeroys set, as jeff is not reacting and screaming about how he feels like hes being raped. so cut to ten minutes later and the guy is still kicking the shit out of jeff from behind, and jeff isnt doing anything about it because hes so fucked. so i have to shove him into my spot and squeezed in behind leah, where jeff was.... the guy stops being violent and spends 10 minutes screaming to me about how he didnt mean to "hurt me" and how he just wants to "fucking kill that guy." (jeff) and such. so its bad bar karma i guess to kick the shit out of strange ladies. the moral of the story is i had to save jeffs drunk ass and i dont even like him. we will see how long it takes to live that one down, considering he doesnt remember anything after 11pm and didnt come down until this afternoon.  im getting too old to enjoy the "scene" here.  scu asks: do i ever sit and wonder who i am... why yes, i do. i went through that pretty hardcore around this time last year, and i think i am better for it. that explains why i come off as indifferent regarding peoples perceptions of me a lot of the time. i guess it is hard to explain. but as soon as i felt i figured myself out (to a degree, of course) i felt i didnt have to prove much of anything to the people that are more or less inconsequential anymore. i dont know if that makes any sense. whatever. it is just something that manifests itself whenever im at the brink of having to make a big change. i guess that means that will be happening again here soon. wonderful.  but its good for ya. sometimes. until you make it totally self destructive analysis. that happens more often that not. that raises a question though: is that destructive introspection exactly that, or is it a cowardly lack of enthusiasm in looking for a silver lining. humm. maybe most silver linings are superficial bullshit anyways. so it goes.  raging optimism. thats me.

      just read this  i relate so some of it quite well     I don't know about my convictions. Not that I don't have any but that they are starting to become a little fuzzy and I cannot find a handle to grasp. My beliefs are being challenged in areas. There are things I've always just accepted as right and now I am growing up and realizing that I have to actually decide for myself. I've always been a very independent person and have made decisions on my own without caring what the crowd was doing. I had to be that way. I didn't grow up surrounded by the church and being guided by Godly counsel. I grew up searching the Scriptures in the quiet of my room, by myself, forming convictions and praying for wisdom. But I am sure I missed a few things along the way, things I didn't need to think about at the time.   I am scared. I am scared of not knowing exactly what I believe in, or perhaps not standing firm in exactly what I believe in. I am scared of the future. I am scared of people continuing to tell me how strong I am only to find out I am but a struggler along the same path of life that they walk, only I probably walk it with much less elegance than they do.    It's okay to be scared sometimes, isn't it? I know the end result is always in God's hands but there is always the fear of the unknown.    I just don't want to be too legalistic. I want to live in freedom. I don't want to be a Pharisee. I want to have compassion and love without condition and with understanding. I want to connect with people and meet them where they are in life. I want to be like Jesus.    Don't worry about my salvation, for those are not the convictions I write of. I fall more in love with Christ every day, more enamored with the way God calls us to Himself and guides the steps we take, more anxious to trust in His faithfulness and the plan He mapped out thousands of years ago for me. No, my struggles are not with God Himself or the Gospel He has given us. If anything, that is the only thing I am absolutely sure of at this exact moment, the only thing unchanging.    Tonight my struggles are with things that are insignificant to others but are very large and real to me. I feel very insecure right now as well. It's weird how quickly these things come upon us. I wonder what you would think of me as I sit here with all of my doubts and insecurities. I'm not especially outgoing so most people have to start conversations with me first. People used to tell me they thought I was a snob for this reason in high school, until they got to know me. You probably would not feel inclined to approach me if we just met on the street. There is nothing striking about me. I'm not beautiful. My hair goes frizzy when it's humid outside. I wear a size 12. Sometimes when I get really sick and lose some weight, I can fit into a 10. But somehow I always gain enough when I recover to get back into a 12; never above but never able to stay below for too long. I'm told all of the medicine doesn't help. I don't have a beautiful smile. I needed braces but my parents couldn't afford them. I stayed out in the sun too much as a kid and so acquired many freckles and moles here and there. My boss yells at me and says I'm going to get skin cancer because she had skin cancer from a mole. I can't stay out in the sun much anymore because it makes me sick. I get scared when I get really close to someone and I want to run. Then, if I do allow myself to get close and do something to screw it up, I really freak out and take flight. It's probably a result of my childhood but I should snap out of it and grow up. Sometimes I get really weepy. I just want someone to hold my hand right then and tell me it will be okay. Other times I couldn't shed a tear if my life depended on it and other times I wouldn't want you to come near me. That's when the wall is up and it's unbreakable.    Sometimes I write really long posts that I will later regret and want to delete, and sometimes I do delete them. Sometimes I pour out the contents of my head without really thinking and then I step back and hold my breath, wondering if anyone can relate or if they all will point and laugh at my insanity. And, apparently, sometimes I write long lists of my flaws when I�m having an attack of insecurity. I am one screwed up person tonight. Nobody will truly know what this whole post is about. I�m not sure I even do. I just needed an outlet and my fingers went to work. I really don�t understand half of what I�ve written. I would tell you it's just about one thing that's been on my mind today but it's really about more than that.>>>>>

      i cannot put into words what is going thru my head right now...  rumors have been going around twn that my mom had a boyfrend named rich n something who is a fucking druggie loser at the bakery. mom denies, and i told her if there was ANYTHING valid to this claim she better ne the one to tell me NOW or it is not forgivable.   ive spent the last 3 hours talking to my mom and dad.......... and im dying. i am 4 hours away and cannot comfort either one. they both are alone.... in so much pain.   i want my mom to TRY and love my dad. TRY.  i want my dad to see the pain my mom is in..  how am i going to be able to move across the country and persue my dreams when im so worried about them being ALONE?  anyway mark and paul and probably jim (jennys boyfriend too) heard rumors from this rick asshole that he had been dating my mom MONTHS AGO. what the fuck. mark was finally the one to comfront my dad. so dad calls me, the pain is pallable, and asks me to answer him honestly-- is mom seeing anyone......  my breath left my body. i thought i was going to hyperventelate. i started to cry... i started to have a panic attack. i got angry, i got scared. i wanted to throw up, and i could not get to mom fast enough.   they dont know what this is doing to me, and i think i would be in worse shape if i wasnt in the middle..  they cannot talk to each other. and they wont talk to anyone else. that leaves me.  i am so worried the family thinks less of her.  she adores them  she needs them. what if they abandon her? WHAT IF?  they are going to grow old alone. ALONE. what if something happens?  WHAT IF?  my dad was suicidal, he tells me. and he would call my mom and she would say "what can i do."  he tells me this from 4 hours away over the phone at 11pm.  i am so scared for them.  WHAT IF HE GETS THAT SAD?  ohh god, what if this is true.  ......... what then?  god please help me. please god be with my parents. now more than ever. we need you.  please. ive never felt so hopeless. and helpless. and alone.   how can i think about my petty shit when this is going on? HOW?  and what can my mom do about this? if he is called on it as sexual harassment, can he be fired? and if he is fired, will he come after my mom?  i am so scared.

      thanks for sending this mofo to me, dear. its appreciated.  Occationally the world seems clear. Everything falls into it's own little niche. Life makes sense in ways that you couldn't have really fathomed.  Attempting to convey, all these words we'd never say, but meant.   It's always sad losing an experience we may never feel again. Seems so final. So strange.  We cling to our past, and know that no matter how much time's past it will never be quite like it once was. Never smell quite like it once did. And Never feel quite like we once were.  Doesn't mean we would rather be there, than here. The loss of anything feels like a loss. Doesn't matter if the gains far surpase it.  When the time is right, you deal with these things, cite them, write them, relax in the notions that swirl around. You can not rekindle what you left, it will never be the same, never feel the same, never taste the same.  You are moving on, and that is okay.  Our own fear of death, and finality takes a role in our fears towards the end.  They are irrational, and even that is okay.  Do not try and force the feelings you want to hide away. Take the bandaid off quickly, for while it may sting, it won't sting as long.  And you can do other things while still numb, grow into new ideas and concepts, and learn what it means to cherish who a person is, and not be dependant.  Once upon a time, I saw a girl. Now all I see are jumbled pictures of that first night.  The only thing I choose to remember in a world of forgotten dreams.

But then it's right back into the fire with Moneen, New Amsterdams, and of course, Dashboard! � I can safely say there are no openings here right now. But that is not to say something won't become available before you head out here. I will certainly keep my ears open for any opportunities that i hear about. They do come past my desk every so often. � I know things are tough with jobs right now, but the only way to deal with it is to keep working / looking. At this point, nothing is easy when it comes to finding a job, no matter what profession. � Let me know if there is anything else I can do! � Take care and good luck! � Wayne  -----------  Hey K Sure I'll send one your way.... sorry I didn't get back sooner - I was actually in Chicago for an Alkaline Trio in-store(it's just Trio mania out here). How about I throw a Moneen advance in there too? That's our next release, and they're awesome, so I want to make sure word starts getting around about them! Yeah Aaron actually got here today, and we put him to work already =) I'll tell him you say hi! Congratulations on graduating! That's awesome.

      you know,  i have been really missing *him* the last 24 hours. walkgn by his place i had visions of popping in or discussions we had in certain places.  im not big in thinking on regret.... everything happens the way it is supposed to so i need to live and let live....  but.  someone once told me that your life is fated. actually he once told me life was fated. and that everything that is destined to be, will be. i do believe strongly in karma. everything you do comes back to you. maybeeven threefold. fate thought- the idea that no matter what you decide to do things will be the way they will be... i didn't like that, and until recently thought it shit and didn't want to believe it. yet on talking to someone and through a number of soul searching experiences it occurs to me that every person you meet who you grow to care for has a purpose and will profoundly affect you in some way if you think about it, and will in fact teach you a lesson. but is that fate, or just a celestine prophecy? is there just no such thing as a chance occurrance? i do think everything happens for  reason. i do. and that all you do effects who you are and what will in turn happen to you. but is it all predestined? and if so, what am i working so hard for?  he said it was fate that i go. i didnt go. did i blow it? was that the way it was supposed to be? one would like to think so. but its hard...  this intriguing thought developed from an idea that what we term d�j� vu is in fact not simply a feeling at all, but a memory surfacing, to tell you/to inform you when you are on the right path, (a signal or clue from the gods, perhaps?) because you have in fact lived this path before, and now that you are reliving it again, you are reminded of this and are being guided to the right choice. or maybe im stoned.

      I ave a name for it!! notfraudage, but frotteurism. you know, those creepy (sometimes not so creepy guys that rub all up on you at shows..... (defined as masturbation by rubbing against another person, the need to rub against another stranger, especially in a tightly packed crowd)   i hate it, and now i know what to call it.   and more good gto news  grubb says: Okay... you all won't believe this.... as you have read earlier in the day, all of our equipment has been  recovered and is now in our possession. as this day was one of the most  satisfying in so many ways in my life, i would have never thought it  could have gotten better. but, yet, it did.  approximately 6 hours after we received the call regarding our  equipment, i received another call from my friend, Dave Webber (channel  6 sports anchor). he called me from his cell and from inside a 1995  White Dodge Conversion Van which he had just purchased at an auto  auction. it was then that he told me that he bought the van for GTO!!!  so, now, we not only have ALL of our equipment back but we also have a  brand new van thanks to dave.  can you even imagine how we're feeling right now?!?!? with all this  luck and good fortune at the hands of others, we are once again more  grateful than we can express.  spread your wings and fly!!! grubb, bob, james and mike  ps... i really think i should go buy a lottery ticket!  to that i say this Congratulations. :) It is amazing things worked out as they did. If anything can make a group of people ask themselves what their future holds, whether this is what they are supposed to be doing, and a thousand other destructive questions, this is it. A situation such as this either brings people closer together or pushes them apart. You guys prevail.  ... and I am happy to say that your calling has been reinforced to a degree that is beyond anything shown to you thus far. There is no such thing as a chance occurrence, and things would not have worked out as perfectly if this was not what you were supposed to be doing. It is horrible that it had to happen under such grave circumstances, but your situation rallied the troops, if you will. Support came from people who had no idea who you were -- my mom even caught wind and wanted to know how she could help, for God's sake. This not only shows you guys how much people care, but hopefully washed away any doubts left in your mind regarding what you do. After shit like this goes down, what can't you handle?  Not to mention that is quite the initiation for Mike. :)  S is flying in and we will be at "the big show" June 20. As press savvy as you are I am sure you are aware that everything surrounding this experience was great promotion, regardless of circumstance. It only goes up from here!

      fuck yeah :) grubb says At 6:45am today, june 5th, i recieved a call from the omaha police  department telling me that detectives in their auto theft division had  found and recovered our equipment. the feeling was unexplainable.  elation, joy, gratitude, relief and so much more rushed through me like  it never has before.  at 9am bob and i went down to the police station and were taken to  identify the equipment. every single piece of it -- down to guitar  picks and drum sticks -- was recovered. it was one of the most  unbelievable feelings we've ever experienced.  two men whose names have been released to the media were arrested last  night as the perpetrators in the crime. as the investigation is  ongoing, that is all the information i am allowed to mention for now,  but we can all only hope and pray that these men are put away for a  long time so they do not have the opportunity to do this to anyone ever  again.  i want to say from the depths of our hearts how thankful we are to the  omaha police department, the council bluffs police department, the  media, our families, friends, fans and the entire omaha-area community  for their incredible support throughout such a dark time for us. it was  so powerful and moving to receive hundreds and hundreds of emails and  phone calls from people throughout omaha (and the entire country)  expressing sorrow and offering support in every way possible. in many  instances people i had never met in my life who had heard of our story  through the media contacted us offering equipment to play, money to  help us get back on our feet, and vehicles for permanent loan until we  were able to afford a new one. one young fan of ours even offered his  brand new guitar his parents just bought him last week. our friends in  the omaha/lincoln/council bluffs music community came forth in droves  offering anything and everything they could and many were in the  process of putting together a benefit show for us. it was truly  incredible.  we extend our gratitude and thanks to everyone who offered condolences  and support a thousand times over. we cannot thank you enough as it was  your support that kept us going and let us know we were not alone no  matter how hard it seemed. in the end, it is the culmination of  everyone's efforts on every level that brought us to this moment and it  is a good day not only for GTO but for the entire community.  while our van was torched and is a total loss, we are grateful for all  that we have had returned to us but most grateful, again, for all who  stood by our side throughout this entire ordeal. the last few days have  been grasshopper takeover's darkest moments and i am overjoyed to say  now that this is our finest hour.  SPREAD YOUR WINGS AND FLY!!! grubb, bob, james and mike www.grasshoppertakeover.com

      i sit and wonder.... are what i consider peoples feelings towards me merely mirrored projections of what i feel towards them? am i a realist? or am i seeing what i want to see alone? maybe it is some sick pair of personal ethnocentric blinders hiding the truth of the matter. silently and unknowingly declaring what i see the only way. the right way. the reality.  and that scares me. this makes me think about a lot of things.................

      riddle me this: when did neurotic become erotic?  maybe my tastes are changing in a rather disturbing yet eccentric manner.and by eccentric i mean fucked up. so it goes.  is it weird i am attracted to a boy who is willing to act like we are in junior high and hold hands and gaze and make out... who overanalyzes what i say and what i do not say.... (this, as opposed to macho clone BS. never could i date a guys guy.) maybe misunderstood is sexy. maybe im crazy. the kind of guy you can talk to for hours in what feels like a heartbeat. the kind of guy who you can make obscure musical references to. the kind of guy who you love to complain about sharing the bed with, but would not have it any other way. the kind of guy you can read without him having to say a word, and vis versa. the kind of guy who knows how to make you comfortable. the kind of guy who retains useless information you may have once brought up. a guy with noble convictions.  is there no such thing? :)  i need to get out of this town.

      is there anybody out there??? let me know. i feel im talking to air. anyone? anyone?  the quote on my mind:  went on a limb for you, capsized when i was 22  so i stay up late, thinking.... im 22. i am at the proverbial crossroads... reality. (read as: graduation.) what is a girl to do. thinking about J has got me down.... thinking about the nice emo boy that got away has got me down.... thinking about how sad my friends are has got me down..... but come on...  sometimes i do not know how lucky i am.... to be understood to have wonderful people around me to have what i need to be able to help  for the ability to grab the silver lining, as fleeting as it can be for my oportunities for the support of those i love, as far away as they can seem to be for the ability to rationalize  they seem like simple things, that is until you see people who are struggling with everything they have got to make their lives work.  all this talk about destiny and fate.... true or no, fuck it. things will always be ok. what doesnt kill you only makes you stronger. i atest. i cant say a life of bullshit makes me want to conquor the world, but i could not feel more prepared to fucking try. cliche what? i know, fogive me for waxing philospohical. thats what i get for the roomies being asleep and living the single life of thinking girl.  is it fair to trust that not all who wander are lost... and not all who are lost can wander? this is where my mind is right now. so it goes.   now on: kimya dawson and bright eyes, for soft, silly music is meaningful, magical

      so these last few days have been some of the most intense this cozy little abode has ever known. it is hard to begin the story, so forgive me if initially makes no sense. here goes.   so as much as i complain about J, i still spend more time with him than about anyone other than my girls, A and L. he gets on my nerves and picks drunkan fights with me, but when it comes down to it, we wouldn't have it any other way. J just graduated. he now has a BA in journalism. he is also unemployed, but to the fact that he can no longer work at the paper because he is no longer enrolled in classes. J has gone to look for a job here in town (any job he could get) every day for the last month or so. all he has been able to find thus far is one interview, that was scheduled for tuesday at blimpies, out of town a ways. needless to say, pickins are slim.   so since J is not in school, he has nothing to do. he sits and thinks, and it comes down to the fact that J's brain is thinking itself into pain and oblivion. thursday L, A and i walked down to main street and had ourselves a little girly night out, had a pitcher or two of beer, and chatted. J decided to "go out with his roomies" so all was well. anyway we get home at maybe 9:00, and L calls J.... who is not answering his cell...... and by 1:00 she is in such a frenzy over not hearing from him that A offers to go with her to his place to check on him, see if he is there, if everything is alright.   they go to J's, let themselves in, and there they find J, passed out between a chair and the wall, head back, eyes open. they get him up and get him water, and bring him back to our place so leah can watch over him. well this night i am kept awake until 5:30 am to muffled conversations in L's room. she spends the next 36 hours with J, and it takes forever for her to seperate from him to tell me whats going on.  turns out that Jhad consumed 2 bottles of vodka that thursday night, and walked 15 miles around town thinking about the quickest way to kill himself. jumping, stepping out into traffic, etc. he concluded that knives were the answer, soon found in his room. he replayed images of serated knives vs. straightedged knives going through flesh to L, which one he thought would be quicker, more resourceful.  he was a loser, if he couldn't find a parttime job here in ames, how was he supposed to find a career? he then felt bad for being so stupid and weak and even thinking about it.... and then felt even worse that people were worrying about him.   for two straight days he laid on our couch and would hardly speak, let alone smile. at anything. anyway L talked him down, thinking he had peaked. saturday dear old J was back to normal. they decided to move to chicago, and things looked bright and cheery and all was well. J was offered a shift working  for his dad's buddy doing the construction he had done the last few summers, and was scheduled to do it this morning, just as he has a few random times over the last few weeks (not a job, but merely covering other people's shifts and earning a few bucks.) or so he told L.   he called her at 10:30 last night to say goodnight, he was super tired and "had to get up at 5:00." and that was that. L and i stayed up late, waiting for A to get off work, and watched a little sex and the city. (again.) so at 5:30 this morning the phone rings. it is J.  "K!"  "yeah...."  "I NEED TO TALK TO L"  "uhhh alright."  so i go get L. two minutes she bursts in my room, bawling. J is in jail. out of town. he was arrested for drunk driving at 5:00 am. he was found passed out in his totaled car on the side of the interstate, eyes open, drooling....... the cops thought he was dead.   emts were called, and they did not know he was ok until the tried to load him on a stretcher and he snapped out of it a little. L did not find out that he never went home until she got him out of jail. instead he let her go the night before so he could drink..... a jug of wine... then get in his car and "go off roading for fun" so he could "accidentally" kill himself. he brought with him a case of beer to drink as he went.???  this morning all he could say was how he wish he would have died, or if nothing else killed someone else, so this all could be over. let me point out that J parties, but has never been a crazy drinker, and has certainly never been a depressed kind of guy. it peaked this morning. he spilled his guts to L, the first person in his life, regarding things that had happened to him when he was a child... and asked her over and over to break up with him because he was a fuck up.   as L sat in my room at 7:00 am i convinced her to call her dad. (he is a counseler for christian charities, teens and twenty-somethings, sexual abusers, abused, chronic depressents, unwed mothers, that kind of thing) just to see what he had to say because if anyone knew what had to be done, it was him. so she called him. she then finally got J to relent and let her call his mom. long story short, she explained what had happened thursday, and J's mom came down from his hometown to more or less move J home.   his mom is a photographer for a mag so thankfully works from the home, as does his independent graphic designer father. so they made an emergency appointment for this afternoon. they didn't give him any meds, but scheduled a day long evaluation tomorrow from 9am-3pm. he is still in a "life sucks, now i feel bad for making people worry, i'm worthless" mindstate. so L went down to his house to stay with him (watch him) tonight at his parents house....   i can tell ya they better get some fucking meds into his system, and fast. it takes like 6 weeks for meds to kick in, and L and J had intentions of being gone by then..... now what? so their future is forever changed.... can they move? can J get a reporting job with "the record box" checked on every application he fills out? will he even be alive to fill out these applications? is L going to put her life on hold for J who can't handle what is going on? i feel so bad for her, but all i can do is sit here and talk to her, which consists of more or less letting her talk. and i hate it.   anyway i feel better getting that out. i did tell S, but he is it cuz i am sure J is not looking for the world to know. and S is out of town so i trust that. but god..... could things BE more complicated?  and i saw the man i am in love with yesterday in the store. :) i miss seeing him around. the emo kid from my hometown came in on saturday, and has boughten two more bright eyes records following the one i suggested, and the good ones too. cursive is next- i love infleuncing people musically. har. hes going to see if his knows my bros bitch and get back to me, but does think shes a bad judge of character if she thinks i am a bitch. aww.  i have cramps and i am worried about ma and pa and L and my job and life and especially J

      have i posted this before? my new creedo, pure brilliance.  Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.  Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.  It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.  We ask ourselves "Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?"  Actually, who are you not to be?  You are a child of God.  Your playing small doesn't serve the world.  There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.  We are all meant to shine like children do.  We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.  It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone.  And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.  As we're liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

      "...they were either in agony or ecstasy; the two are often difficult to tell apart. I have even heard that fear and love, agony and ecstasy, are the same feeling, and that its all a matter of perspective...."  isnt that the truth. when you are lucky enough to be riding on the high (read as ecstacy, even love) the slighest change can lead you to question and rethink what you are doing, who you are, and where you are going. the slighest doubt can feel like tragedy. your high gives way to the fear and agony waiting patiently in the wings for is cue. these two emotions come and go, one to the other, all too frequently. so often, in fact, that the once distinct lines become blurred. one slips into the other.... this is a horrible feeling sometimes, but you have to appreciate that this makes you human. if you do not exprience this array of emotion, what will remind you you are alive? the adage says if i must choose between suffering and nothing, i choose suffering.  thats whats on my mind today.

      japanese raver girls crack my shit up  my new tattoo is officially healed. woo.   resume was sent to paramount today. wish me luck?  a month and 2 days and i am a college graduate and am moveing 1700 miles. this is beyond frightening.  i talked to my emo boy crush tonight... he knows jus's girl. also hates her, i might add. he thinks its a shame im leaving since hes "just getting to know me." he is the kind of kid i would indeed like to get to know. very genuine. seeks me out when its not necessary. this i like. he is, however, moving back "home." this is sad. he is doing if due to family stuff, and declares his intentions noble. i think he is right. im going to have to sprout some balls and make us hang out here soon.  awww. a crush at 22? :)  A poinsettia in poison rain/ Traded true love for insult and injury/ We washed it down the drain/ with one silver bullet and two vicodin/ We watched the sun fall crown/ on a city that sleeps in a world upside down/ A slow ticket straight out of town/ You went out with a bang when you took/ with you all my dreams underground.  L found J passed out drunk yesterday afternoon, that is not ok. all this time and hes still suicidal? they are moving him out of the house for good. then shauna called to her dad had passed away thursday night. (06.05)   he was such a damn nice guy..  i hope he got my e-mail saying i was thinking of him.    also heard from grubb and bob these last couple days...  k, thank you very much for your well wishes and congratulations regarding the recovery of our gear. we are so thankful to the entire community for standing behind us so powerfully during our darkest moment and finest hour. the day we received the call that our equipment had been recovered was incredible and then, when i would have never thought the day could get better, i received a call from a friend telling us he had bought GTO a new van! we've learned many lessons from this experience and one of the greatest is that there is truth in the power of the good will of humanity.  thank you for your support and all our best, always. curtis grubb / GTO http://www.grasshoppertakeover.com/  AND  k,        hey just wanted to drop a short note to say thanks for all the love and support you have given the band in the past, and more so last week in our darkest hour. can't believe we got our stuff back, seems like a bad dream that we just finally awoke from.  i hope they put those guys away for a long time cause they don't belong on the streets. you truley one of our greatest fans and friend. thanks once again and hope to see ya at a show soon... bob/gto  nice men, they are.

      i had a great fucking post a couple days ago. i published it, now where is it??  so S isnt coming. sad.  R and her boy in socal got ENGAGED. yay for her!   bizarre letter from mike the new gto guitarist.   reads:This is Michael Cioffero, the new GTO guitarist. I have been meaning to get  in touch with you but my computer has been messed up and I couldn't get to  my email for about a week. I hope you are doing well. I have had an  interesting ride these past weeks with all that has happened with the theft.  On behalf of the band, I want thank you for your support through it all.  Your email has meant more to me than I can explain. We have our gear back, a  new vehicle to travel in, and are ready to play some music! I hope to see  you out at the shows. Please come say hello!!!"  ok i thought that was cute. i replied nice to meet ya mike.  he replies: Thank you for your kind words. I acctually think I have met you before. My  band before this was George Zip and we played several times with the J's and  KKK and I think I meet you those times. Where are you moving? LA? San Diego?  I have a friend in San Diego and she loves it. Yea, it would be cool to see  you out on the 20. Thanks again for everything.  Michael Cioffero  doh. i hate it when that happens. oh those wonderfully deviant J's.  another thinker e-mail to eat up space and energy in your brain? "after some vicodin here it comes. existence is futile. emotions rage and wane. if only one could take a pill that says today is a sad day, and on. thoughts creep telling me to be stressed that my life is shit, that where i am is shit, and ask me constantly where i am going. telling me to lie just to make life more interesting. looking for someone to connect with missing the feeling of a mental journey with another mind and soul. and practicality always seeps in slowly like the dribble down your leg when you forget to shake it off. there are millions of people in the world with worse life's and situations and i am in some way positive that they find it in themselves to be happy/ content with their lot and future.  the kick that exists is that if only i could not be alone in this world that i too could be content with anything, if i could find someone to complete me. i guess that means that i dont believe that i have ever been whole. maybe when i am an old geezer i can look back and feel complete. until then i look in situations sunsets nature, music, and the arts for a glimpse of something that is beyond me, something that is whole, so that for whatever infinite time that i glimpse this my soul is tickled by possibilities and perfection. words thoughts and anything is not needed and becomes inconsequential because this IS. so i live my time looking or waiting for these moments and the time in between seems to be just that. so as i sit watching this blinking cursor my biggest insecurity, that i will be alone for the rest of my life, seems permanent but utterly ridiculous. what for? go look for your soul."  thats right.

      As I look to dig the root for the beginning of the question.  I stop in discontent at the wager of my direction.  Seeming as time will go on forever, and I'm am but a spec of dust to the universe, my way and life is to find some sort of purpose.  Purpose inside of bounds that tug at every angle.  Puritan ethic maintains in my moral sense, as old world glory keeps it's constant edge.  Escape brought has brought no sense, remaining all the same.  I'm just playing at some familiar old game.  I pace halls, keep awake at night, to hope to wake up with some sort of new edge.  Maybe it is the sought out form of perfection that is ever eluding; or the mischievous prowl for something more.  I know your fear, and I know the feeling all too well.  It's question that arises on days it doesn't belong.  A solution to the problem can never be found.  For if you look for salvation from another, you�re asking for an overwhelming strength.  I think everyone looks for a stronger person.  But it takes strength greater to find these persons, for they seek  the same in others.  I love your email.  It awoke stillness in me.  And I felt delight.  Thank you.  With love, your brother, Jon  wow. smart.  so S has tics to modest mouse for 7/15. sounds fun, not sure if i can go.  my emo boy wants me to stick around and go to the radiohead show with him in august.  ...tempting ;)

      long time, no speak. i just returned from omaha, where i had an actionpacked weekend....... details are sparatic, so here goes.  long, horrible drive... i get just past DSM and the car freaks out.... long story short (and an hour and three toothless yokals later) i discover i have bad fuel. so it goes. then i almost hit a deer outside CB. plus 60 miles of construction. (plus the horrid rainstorms on the way home that caused everyone to have to pull off the road... all and all a bad driving expereince.)  so anyways friday i went to the rice pep rally on the 10th street bridge in omaha for the first official fanfest.... then met up with emily at the ranch bowl to see GTO. this was the first time they had played with their recovered equiptment in omaha, not to mention the first time i had seen them with mike.... and holy shit. as i told grubb, i have an incredible feeling about all that is transpiring there. plus rolling stone was there, as well as the CEO of degy entertainment. (good story about that, hold tight.)  anyway emily and i spent most of the night smuggling beer outside and chilling with the guys and sean. it was fun, and mike was very cool. i didnt know who he was-- james tried to help me track him down, but once i met him we discovered i wasnt who he thought i was and he was happy... he referred to me as the better, cooler k all night. thanks, stranger.   anyway as i was explaining to mike who/ what i was in relation to the band and their history we got to talking about socal and the move and such.... and about the ceo in the house. mike said he "was cute" and he wanted to intorduce us. i said something about giving him my resume, joking. then i got to thinking... i had a letter in emilys car (resume) to send to the guy i got a letter from thursday -- i needed a stamp in order to mail it. so i ran and got it. i found mike, he found grubb to find the ceo, and mike drags me into the dark show and introduces me. after the show i see the ceo and he shows me the resume in his pocket and he says "he never lets a good one slip by."   so new york city, anyone?  scary.   got a new gto record, "long live rock n roll"  "no pressure" and "make love not war." very exciting.   im tired.

Within the last hour I was called by Chuck at Psychic Eye Book Shop, went in, interviewed, and went to the record shop to look into getting Tuesday and Friday nights, as well as Saturday days off.   2. By my calculations, that would be an extra 20 hours a week. Thats an extra $130 take home at a rad place to be. I would be happy if this worked out.  3. He more or less told me he was impressed with me and my style and I was "the candidate."  4. Yay!  5. I think we are going to look at bikes today. Score.  6. And see another dub show tonight.

      1. I read this today and I approve......  "Absence makes the heart grow fonder."   Even though that enormous hen in Robin Hood said it, it's not true. It only really applies if you have that sort of impossibly simple love that two animated, talking foxes can have.  Because the truth is that absence makes the heart grow blander.  You're easier to forget when you're not right in front of me, proving the universe wrong. You're only as beautiful as the picture thaat I have of you in my head, which fades ever quicker the less you voluntarily talk to me.  Because, I guess, I miss you the most when you're with me and making me happy and I'm realizing that this is but a taste of something greater that I'll never get to know.  2. I am not really in the mood to head to work soon.  3. Usually.  4. Silly songs are indeed magical.  5. My ma found a home for those birds. Aww.  6. The Cure is this weekend. How I hope I can go. But I know I can't. Oh, Robert!  7. I need to do laundry.  8. The world seems whole as I lie in bed at night and think sad thoughts that creep into my head. How is that?  9. Maybe I'm fucked up.  10. Maybe it's natural.  11. Either way I am OK with that. This shit is what has made me who I am.   12. Humm.

A cockatiel will often stimulate or 'pleasure' itself by rubbing its vent against a toy, a perch, part of the cage, a food container or even you - using your hand or foot to rub against!  Squeaking noises, a tail that moves back and forth, and a head that moves from side to side accompany the rubbing. This is natural mating behavior and in the absence of a true mate your cockatiel will use whatever appeals and whenever!"  5. .... she .... is.... masturbating? Birds? Ramona? Uhh.  Wow so OK.  6.

      1. I got a 2nd job today. Tuesday and Friday nights and Saturday days. They are giving me keys on my first day?  2. I am kinda excited. It is a dark little new age store that sells things like voodoo necessities, essential oils, healing crystals, wiccan gear and such. i dont know anything about this, but i will work with clairvoyants and readers and aura cleansers everyday, and that could be fun.   3. He got my tape today. All he said was he was making me one in the next day or so and smooch.  4. I am thinking too much.   5. So explain... what am i thinking.  6. I do think most people are more or less too insecure for relationships.   7. As I said, I also think this mutual internal awkwardness thing is what keeps people together in the first place. Subconsciously playing along is redeeming sometimes.   8. I've been very nostalgic these days. I suppose that happens when you go through major life changes. Transition. Whatever.   9. As long as you know where your weakness lies, you're going to be just fine. this doesn't mean you have to change, necessarily, just be careful.   10. Maybe my introspection is bullshit and I'm afraid to look for a silver lining and you shouldnt listen to me. Or maybe you should because a silver lining is nothing but superficial false hope. Hummm.  11. Raging optimist, arn't I?  12. My folks' divorce is final today.  13. There is no such thing as a forever love, huh.  14. He says- You know what I love as well? She says- What's that. He says- Or like intensly? She says- ? He says- Girls in sweaters/glasses, smell of burning leaves in the Nebraska countryside and The Onion  15. I say if you are not depressed, you're not paying attention.  16. And sadly I think that is actually based in reality.  17. Lyric of today "Still mapping it out like a masterplan/ Something to do with my idle hands/ Write you a letter addressed from California."  ;)

      1. Crush. What a perfect word to choose.  2. He said I was more cheery yesterday than he had ever seen me.   3. Was I? :) It was because I was with him, actually.  4. He did say that if I made that CD for him he would listen to it all the time and not skip Bright Eyes or the Faint. Even if it is meloncholy.   5. We are all sad and have fucked up family situations. So it goes.  6. A swell boy from CHitown named Nick sent me a kickass mixtape in the mail yesterday.  7. That is how it is: if you want me to marry you you must  a. not be too cool to play scrabble b. make mixtapes for me until you die c. be more fucked up than me  OK??  8. We are going to Oceanside here in a few to hang out with S's married friends. Woo.  9. We will see how that goes, chilling with the married people.   10. He remembered I was going to San Diego this weekend. I dont think I even told him. Aww. Crush indeed.  11. Tomorrow is 311. ;)  Whee.

I need to go to work.  7. Get it while I can. I suppose.   8. Uugghh...... OK I did work with him yesterday... we were not cute at all.

      dear you, i was looking for you tonight. you werent around, and i did not know what to do. waiting, repeating, searching and certainly longing. i need someone to convince me things can be ok. i really needed someone, anyone to be there. but i secretly hoped it was you.  no one came.  i drown sorrows. i close those thoughts out of my head. i self medicate, and still you are not here and things are not ok.  i was afraid i wanted to be alone forever. i thought that was how it was just going to be. then i met you. we spoke. it was then i knew i couldnt be alone. i am now afraid that i cannot be eternally independent. i could break.  no one else makes me dodge popups and write rambling stoney love mainfestos. you are states away. the distance is making the heart grow fonder... and weaker. a place to rest my head and breathe, that is what i think i need -to be whole again. whole in mind, whole in spirit. right now something in me is broken, missing, dying. and it affects every bit of my being. i think you could be the one to fix it, someday. and if not, you are the one who can give me solace and comfort.   hop a place. get some gas and hit the road. greyhound, raft, pony, scooter.... whatever it takes. get out here. find me. no regrets, i give that which i receive, and i will give and give. i need you. no more tears. amazingly i feel i know you in my heart. there is a space there shaped like you. waiting. tired eyes, battered prizefighter head angled with eyes at the floor, awkward nervous smile, smooth keen awareness.... these are the keys to my soul. i have a hand extended out to you and ask you to come.   .... love me*

      1. Yesterday J said he was a gooood tiiiime. I said I bet he was. He said it depended on what I thought a good time was. I said I liked listening to music that was made by people that are apparently sadder than i could potentially be, opinion battles and conversation on more than what was going on that second, scrabble, hanging out in the dark as long as other people are there, and well you know. And avoiding questions. ;) He said good answer, so we are ok.   2. Tomorrow I work with A. I was wrong about today. No dice.  3. Long day today.   4. However my horoscope for tomorrow says: "Love and romance blossom as a current or potential love partner comes on really strong with passionate demonstrations of affection. This person could have a lot to say to you, K, which might catch you by surprise. In the past, communicating may not have been this person's strength, but now it's like there's no stopping the flow of words. Listen, and guard your responses. You'll need to think about what is being said."  5. Exhale...............................

      1. I wish A were here right now.  2. Dyed my hair today. Too dark. Maybe the roomie will give me a cut today though. Pre- smoke, that is.  3. I do get to see him tomorrow, however. ;)  4. No call from HER today. She made the biggest fucking deal about calling today sometime. Come on, woman. Help.  5. That is all I have right now, seems I dont want to fill everyones heads with sadness.  6. And Sex and the City is on. Priorities, you know.   7. I did wash my car today. And vaccum it. And got gas. And put air in my tires. My dad would be proud.

      1. I have a lot to say. It is 11:00pm. I will be up all night thanks to the nap I took late this afternoon. Work, fuck it. It has thrown me totally off.  2. A asked me to go see the Trio with him. Aww.  3. Lisa and I have a lot in common. More than I ever would have thought. Did I mention that?  4. I do not really want to go home to SC. I do, however, want to see a few friends and "be there" for one specidically. ;)  5. He says, she says: J vs K She says:� � :) i feel ya.  He says:� � Hehe.  He says:� � No you don't.  He says:� � That's the problem.  He says:� � ;)  She says:� � haha maybe this is true.   6. More people need to be that straight with me. Hint Hint, A.   7.  Scu "is it bad to value freindships a little more than love?" The answer is as follows. My thoughts of the day.   It is certainly not wrong to value friendship �over love.... those are the people who tend to stick around despite whatever bullshit comes up, anyway. Friendship weathers better than love, in my �clouded experience.   Your friends are there to listen to you talk about how fucked up love is. There are more guarantees in friendships.   Emotions dont play such a hard part. Friends take things for face value, compared to the complications and confusion and double and triple and secret meanings and assumptions and misunderstandings in love. �Thats why all of the great "love relationships" I know are between people who started as best friends. Its hard to explain, but its just different.   8. How right am I though?  9. His girl is upset my his "history" with women. He doesnt know how to make this better. This is one of the reasons I dont like most girls. I say to him "While i can see how she could be weirded out by whatever may have gone on with you in the past, your "history" has nothing to do with where things are right now. Regardless of what you have or have not done with whomever, �there is nothing you (or she) can do to change it.   But atleast in my case I dont feel I can hold anything anyone I have ever been with has done against them because I was not a part of their life, in a sense, when these things occurred. very ambiguous, i know. �she just needs to realize that. Asking her to be ok with it is one thing, but asking her to accept there is nothing you can do about it now is another. If the tables were turned and it was you saying these things to her something tells me it would be very different."   Is that rude? Because if she doesnt accept my friend for who he is, they do not belong together. So I would feel with any good friend of mine.   10. I feel bad for him though. He isnt happy. Much like me, although I try to hide it. Im sorry things arnt going that great with him... but things will work out I suppose. They always do. I hear that what doesnt kill us only makes us stronger, or some shit like that. Im waiting patiently to see if this is true.   11. The longer I wait for things to just work out for me the more impatient I become. The more impatient I become the more jaded I become. The more jaded I become the less I put myself out there. The less I put myself out there, the less open I am to change. The less open I am the longer I have to wait. Its a cycle I cannot kick, I tell ya. I just hope to God I dont turn into one of those people who are only stable and grounded when things are fucked up and going wrong.... approaching everything as fucking damage control. But I dont see that happening soon. Please.   12. Speaking of masturbation, this morning at work a man was crouched in our little porn dvd booth at work for an hour uhhh "shopping." I was afraid to interrupt, so i just let him do his thing. Great story. Scu you may be right with the whole "animal or human acting �funny equals masturbating" thing.�  12. Cant stop thinking about poor J. I wish I were there. He needs to make out a little I think. That would not only cheer him up, but it would make him feel much better about everything.  ;) awwwww.................... He says "He sits at home listening to Bright Eyes and Outkast by himself.....wondering what it's like to kiss a grrl, as it's been so long that he's forgotten and he wishes he had some cookies." Poor guy. That town sucks the life out of sensitive kids. I can tell you all about it.   13. Tomorrow is my day off. I probably have to talk to my mom. And should call Boyle and Leah.  And maybe Jus.  14. I am not OK with turning 23.  15. G wants D, L, and I to come work for him. He called and formally asked Dawn.Thats it. No J or B or T. Sad. And no one from the CM store. Should I be happy about that, considering I have been ther 2 months? :) Yes.   16. I hope he had a good first day at his new job.. A.  17. I work with him a few days this week :) (Uhhhh Oh.......) muahahaha.

      i ask the cute emo boy whom i have a crush on if e were my brother, what should i get him for his birthday. he proceeds to answer "gettin' nasty with sis!!!"   ...mmm ok. i chuckle and reply that he had put mental pictures in my head that were grotesque and unacceptable. he then asks if he is indeed going to recieve this gift. i say time will tell. he asks what this means, and i say exactly that, time will tell. ;) hes a tease and i love that.  men. and they say women are the root of all that is evil?  we discussed hypersensitivity and feeling cathartic, as mentioned. he says he cries when he sees happy couples. i told him how it makes me sad to see others that way. i think we would be good together. maybe even great. he meets my "criteria" if you could call it that. hes so sweet. musically brilliant. a hopeless romantic. and across the country.   i love green stocking hats. i was mike for trick or treating today. i carved a jack skelington jackolantern last night. did i mention that? it is snowing ash thanks to the fires in rancho coucamongamonga. i wish he were here tonight. warmth if nothing else.  maybe he can swing a visit. ;)

      1. some say thinking about death- or the sudden loss of someone you never imagined the world without- is cathartic. i dont think so. all if does is make me question my falliblle nature and mental health.   2. i have met some great people here.  3. sadly i wont see many of them soon.  4. im too introspective. my brain keeps me awake nights scared to death of who i am, who i was, who i will be, who people think i am, where things are going, others well being, my own well being, humanity, etc etc etc. some say this mindstate is that of hypersensitivity. maybe so. maybe it does lead to ulcers and manic depression like J said. but feeling this is better than feeling nothing at all.

      so its like this. i am restless. i dont know where i want to be or what i want to do, but i do know this is not it.   im not sure where to go from here or how to change things. work will change soon... but again, i still wont be where i want in life. i will still be a parttimer with a degree. i will scrape by. i will be living with S. maybe she is right about the physical environment effecting me. i dont want to bring people here. and everyone lives "far" away. the boy issue is hindered even more thanks to the living situation. the family is not ok. i cannot really go back there. i would love love love to see a few kids from back home... A, L and S........ and J ;) but i dont want to go back there and face the sickening reality that is a crumbled family. its almost november. its 80 degrees. come christmas, this will no longer be acceptable.  like i said, i am restless. im most areas of my life. i am scared of moving in a new directon. change is good, and i am certainly a risk taker when it comes to most important things.... but i am still in this stalemate with myself. what is that cliche about having one foot in the past and one in the future causing you to piss on the present? maybe thats it. i am so concerned about what WILL happen and wont let go of what HAS happened that i am not being constructive with the time i have right now.  you think?  the ulcer feeling tells me i just hit the nail on the head.   in other news, today is my day off. this is nice. all i have done today is laundry and cleaning anf the like. and searched for my emo boy crush. looks like he is MIA.   my boss and i close together on halloween and have decided to dress as the white stripes. (perfect record store costume, thank you very much.) i will be meg, dressed in red pants and a black shirt, along with the "i heart jack" pin. she will be jack, dressed in red shirt and black pants, and of course the "i love meg" pin.   are we clever or are we clever.  i think i am off to watch saved by the bell.   did i mention i am fucking lame. and unhappy?

      notes to/on GTO  I just had to write and say... well I don't even know. First and foremost, thank you guys for a great trip to the heartland. There is something I feel I have to get across to you guys that somehow trancends words. But I try. I am amazed at what you guys have done. I am amazed by a crowd 1400+ strong. I am amazed by a fanbase that is one of the best crosssections of humanity I have seen. I am amazed by the people I have met through the GTO experience. I am so proud of you guys. I just want you to know that as cliche as it sounds I can't even explain how much I believe in what you guys are doing right now.   I am glad we got a chance to talk a bit... as I mentioned to C, J, B and M it is nice to be assured I am not considered some kind of lame-o groupie chick.... but like I said... I believe in what you guys are doing and have from go. Now it is year six or seven and I am still struck by what GTO does. What you have to say. Your philosophies. Your drives and motivations. What James said is right, there is just something there with you guys and I can't really put my finger on it. Music is a fucking powerful thing.   Can I just say... as I am sure you have heard time and again over the last few days,  this record is more than I could have ever hoped for. There are few records that are as brilliant in their entirety. Good things are to come for you boys, it is inevitable. Your heads and hearts are in the right place, the karmic world is in your favor, and you have certainly paid your dues. Now its on, and it is all uphill from here. It was merely a matter of time and patience, but I sincerely believe your time has arrived. :)  Anyway I relayed to M that realize I have only met him a handful of times, however it certainly doesn't feel that way. It's sad I didn't get to see him more while I was out there... we missed him back at the house post-show last night. :) But it was good talking to you the bit I did, thank you for that.   Also relayed to J how he effected my life. Hadnt met him wouldnt have met S. Hadnt met her, wouldnt be here in CA. That guy.......  I am still quite adament about scoring some M solo work... come on man, hook a girl up! :) I vow to harass you about it until you cave.  Running on two hours of post-show sleep I had to drop you guys a line and do my best to say thank you. Be sure to take good care of yourself, and keep in touch. Hopefully I will see you out West soon! M makes me cream, k

      here is the review of the elliott smith tribute/ memorial i went to with the ladies from work    Beck, Beth Orton & Others Honor Elliott Smith At L.A. Memorial Concert (LAUNCH, 11/04/2003 4:00:00PM)  By Lyndsey Parker  (11/4/03, 4 p.m. ET) -- Last night (Monday, November 4) at a memorial concert held at Los Angeles's Henry Fonda Theater, Beck, Beth Orton, and other esteemed artists and admirers paid tribute to late singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, who committed suicide on October 21. Proceeds from the event went to the Elliott Smith Foundation For Abused Children, about which Orton commented during her poignant acoustic performance, "This is a celebration of Elliott's life, and I'm doing this for what he's leaving behind, this organization. Perhaps he wasn't lucky enough to overcome what he suffered, but maybe by doing this, we can help others who have suffered."   The highly emotional evening featured performances of Smith's many brilliant songs by various acts from the Silver Lake artist community, where Smith had been living when he died. Local powerpop band the 88--accompanied by guest vocalist Fritz Michaud, who had been recording new material with Smith at the time of Smith's death--performed an unreleased song from those sessions, "King's Crossing," along with two other Smith compositions, "Can't Make A Sound" and "Got A Foot In The Door." Lou Barlow of Sebadoh/Folk Implosion and John Doe of X offered acoustic renditions of "Division Day" and "Rose Parade," respectively, and Alaska and the Radar Bros. both covered "Speed Trials." The Radar Bros. also performed "Between The Bars," and were joined by Steve Hanft (director of the Elliott Smith documentary Strange Parallel) on guest vocals for "Say Yes." Hanft's Strange Parallel collaborator, Jason Mason, performed as well, covering "Waltz #2" and the Smith rarity "Pretty (Ugly Before)" with his two indie bands, Wiskey Biscuit and Future Pigeon. Mason admitted between songs, "I feel like I'm on acid right now because the mood is so heavy," adding, "For all of you who just knew Elliott for his music, yes, he was so talented--but the person was just incredible."   Among the most touching moments of the night was the solo acoustic set by Tito Larriva of Tito & Tarantula, who performed a brand-new original number, explaining, "Elliott came to me in a dream last night, and he was singing this to me. So I'm going to try to sing this song he wrote. I don't even know the title of it." Seemingly on the verge of tears, Tito had to stop midway through the sad, lovely ballad, and was barely able to finish it. Another special moment was the performance by Papa M, featuring former Zwan members David Pajo and Paz Lechantin and Beachwood Sparks keyboardist Dave Scher; their string-laden interpretation of "Untitled," a song by Smith's early band Heatmiser, was positively goosebump-inducing. Finally, a particularly magical highlight came at the beginning of Rilo Kiley's set, when frontwoman Jenny Lewis crooned a gorgeous, entirely a cappella version of Smith's "I Didn't Understand" with the audience quietly singing along. When her bandmates joined her onstage to perform a plugged-in cover of another Smith tune, "The Biggest Lie," guitarist Blake Sennet remarked, "Elliott, on top of being one of the people who made me want to make a contribution musically, was also a very amazing and generous guy...He was a big inspiration for us. Thanks for letting us play these amazing songs."   Closing out the concert were Beck--who warmly declared, "I'm really happy to have this chance to pay tribute to Elliott and his incredible music," before wowing the sold-out crowd with his stunning unplugged versions of "Ballad Of Big Nothing," "Alameda," and "Clementine"--and Beth Orton, who performed Smith's "No Name #3" as well as her tearjerking original song "What We Begin," which she explained was written for her childhood friend who committed suicide last year.   But perhaps the evening's greatest tribute to Smith was the reverence and respect given to the post-show screening of Strange Parallel. Concertgoers had already begun to file out of the venue, but when the lights dimmed again and the movie began to play on the stage's big-screen backdrop, everyone returned to their spaces for the next half-hour, riveted to the screen, pindrop-silent except for a few heartfelt bursts of applause after Smith's live performance scenes. Seeing Smith on the screen, strumming his acoustic guitar and warbling "Waltz #2" in his fragile, haunting voice, made everyone in the house realize what a profound loss Smith's death truly is.

Seeing 2 Skinnee J's for the second time, this time at the Ranch Bowl in Omaha. It was some radio guys' birthday party with 5 bands on the bill. It it was a hot, sticky night in July. Ranch Bowl oversold the tickets by 100. No air conditioning. Kristen, Leah, and I were in the front among hot and sweaty people. We were being doused with water. The J's were the last band to go on. I didn't think I was going to make it out alive. It was the best concert I've ever been to. July, 2001.  5. Graduating from college. Ah ... It feels so good to be free. I'm glad I went through the ceremony because it felt so exciting to walk across the stage, shake President Geoffroy's hand, hear my family and Drew cheer me on, and know that everything I've learned in my life was worth it. August, 2003.  9. There were many nights were Kristen, Leah, Erin, Kathy and I would spend driving around endlessly in Sioux City listening to the ghetto tape. Ah yes ... those were the days. It doesn't sound very fun, but when you have nothing to do, even the most mundane things are hilarious. Summer, 1999  11. Sophomore year in the dorms, Kristen and I hosted hump day Wednesdays where our friends would get together and play asshole and get drunk all night long. On this particular occassion, a friend of ours spilled his beer and without pausing, he slurped it up from our carpet. That also may be the night when Chuck got on the phone and called the annoying girl down the hall and told her to go order a pizza (is that how it happened? I can't even remember?). It was very fun.

      i smoked with a nice coworker behind the store.   shouldnt smoke.  he apoligized for yelling at me about the other manager last week.  aww hed been thinking about it. i didnt care- he was venting. we all have to do it.  happy day off. i think they pushed back the recording of the boy i am crushing on.  yay for me, sad for him. he decided i was his musical pimp.  the other manager told a customer if they liked ICP they would definitely like his band.  that cracks me up.  we need to bond more. i was kinda mean to him yesterday. he wanted to know what was wrong.  i dont know how to tell you.

      so i told him i would like to smoke with him because he seemed like he would be... fun  i told him i read about him in that book as well, and that the writer was not so nice  i didnt want him to read it if it would hurt him  i told him exactly that, i dont want you to read it if it was going to make you sad  but he borrowed it anyway. i hope it doesnt get him down  hopefully we will work together soon  so umm yeah ive fallen pretty hard  being in the same room with him makes me happy  him being happy makes me happy  i like that feeling  he apoligized for being mean to lisa, he didnt mean it  see? he is so nice. lisa says hes scum free and the wedding is still on  my boss got a new job and put in his two weeks  sscaryy  we will see  i was asked out by the stalker  ewww no, my "boyfriend wounldnt like that"  uhh yeah  we went to the wild animal park in san diego today  it was awesome, only because the animals were not really caged, but more free and happy  the birds wings had been clipped to prevent them from reaching elevations though  sad. but the people i was with got some good giraffe pics. sweet.  lisa got us 311 tics  we saw nick in hollywood last wednesday at the zack hexum show  we were composed  although we got lost on sunset. so it goes.  so anyway our neighbors suck  blocking me in the garage and all  jerks  wow so have i mentioned i have grandious ideas of the two of us hanging out  we have a lot in common  so pretty  hes afraid to drive postpuff so maybe he;ll have to stick around  god.... hes so talented too.  im going on and on, i know. grade school style. but he blows me away  and i dont think i will ever be able to tell him that unless we hang out outside the store  and even then, only after he expresses some kind of minute attraction  he may.   maybe.  mmmmmm such pretty words.

      someone i promise i will credit says kids like him are rumored to have dredispositions for one night stands, egomania, and cracking the edges of easily enamored little girls who see the beauty of anyone who shares feelings with entire cities on a regular basis. they get to run away from what they do, every single night. they are a danger to the girls who want to cure them, care for them, and become the other half of every brooding boy- angel. they dont know or dont care what is best for them.   .. like me maybe?

K: i like S very much, dont get me wrong. we just cant get married yet :-) K: although maybe we should. L: i know.:-( K: id date S if he werent my associate. thats weird. K: or maybe im paranoid.

      so hey, alright. im just about to pop in tommy boy and crack open a beer. how ladylike. its raining out... very monsoon-esque. ive spent a good part of the night sitting outside on our bamboo enclosed balcony listening to the rain. thinking. trying to understand why things are the way they are and what its going to take to change them. not even changing them so much as bearing with them and surviving.  just being content with the way things are. thats all i really need.  i need to stop worrying about other people so much. how they are and how they feel and how what i say or do may or may not effect their lives.  always thinking about others ultimately is bad for you.  not to sound like im always a great person, but i try to be. to the point where i beat myself up, and that has got to change. i like being a little too nice, too trusting. i would choose to be this way over being like the rest of OC anyday.   give me a second, im going outside for a few. gather my thoughts, clear my head, breathe some clear air. wish you were here.   as i was aluding to... its not so much asking myself WHAT am i doing here as it is HOW am i doing here. not that i would be/feel/act any better anywhere else, its just that things arnt ok... and i wonder if they could have been different. i suppose that is inevitable.  i love the people i have met here, as bizarro as they may be. they have nothing to do with the blue funk im in. i heard somewhere that the first couple years after you graduate from college are the most depressed times of your life. so far i agree with this. what i feel is not like the phases i went thru in college.... at times depressed because i was lonely. or not lonely enough. depressed because of the family. depressed because i was truely an adult. depressed over simple realites such as school and work and easy, material, mindless, fleeting things.   things are deeper now.... what is at the core of the issue is more important and true. its a clear reality. this is how life is. ive entered a place where it is no longer prep time. no more rehearsals. game on, be alert.  this is partially exciting and partially scary as fuck. there is a fine line between them, i come to find out.   today is ash wednesday. no church for me.  homer would enter a "mmm.. sacreligious" here.   the rain makes me happy. makes the world seem very clean for once. and everyone slows down for a second. how travis bickle of me. but he is right, it does wash the scum off the streets. im only happy when it rains. ok, not true. im not exactly happy. but its the same macabre state of my dark mind that keeps me content when im miserable, the part that makes me grow from pain and hurt. that place in my brain that makes me work best under panic and pressure.   so it goes.  so drop me a line, i could use come comfort today.

      when i look at you its like praying with my eyes.  mmmmm happyy leap year day.  what?  saw 311 tonight. blissful. number 51.  they played their cover of white man in hammersmith palace for the first time in america.  thought of now: everyone is a musician to some degree, and the idea of whos word is more credible is open to interpretation. merely putting your own thought/input/interpretation into someone elses music makes one a musician. being a musician and being able to put it onto paper are two different things,

      for future reference, here is my sun chart. pretty accurate?  Ascendant in Scorpio   With this position, you are likely to be quite secretive about your emotions at first.   You reserve the disclosure of your true feelings for those who are close to you, those whom you can trust with the full intensity of your emotions. Once involved with a lover, your physical passions are very strong.   Sexuality at its best totally involves and overtakes you. For this reason you may be attracted to some unconventional kinds of sex in which you control or are controlled by the situation.   Your feelings are very intense, but that can backfire if the affair does not work out. If that happens, try not to hold a grudge against your former lover - some affairs just don't work out, and neither of you is to blame.      Sun in Scorpio   Of all the Sun signs, yours is the one most closely identified with sexuality. This is because you feel life intensely and need to express your passions in all that you do.   You will be very tempted to use your sexual magnetism to gain material or psychological advantage over your lover. For this reason you may attract less sophisticated partners whose naivete allows you to be in command.   You usually are very clear about what you desire, and you know it is worth waiting a long time to get what will satisfy you.   You tend to immerse yourself in an affair, then you are changed by it and finally become completely detached from it. Once an affair is over, it is finished for you forever. However, neither you nor your partner will be the same as when you met.      Sun in the First House   This position indicates that you are a person who stands out in a crowd. Because of this outstanding quality, you don't need to strive to make a stronger impression when you encounter someone who is attractive to you.   Elaborate courting is not your game. Because of your honesty, your love affairs begin and end quite abruptly, as you have no desire to continue a relationship that is no longer working well.   The main advantage of this position is that it indicates a strong, forceful personality. But you must use that power carefully in your love relationships.      Moon in Capricorn   You are not one to rush into a relationship, but you don't usually back off from one, either.   What you do want is a partner who is basically committed to you, so you know you are working with something real and lasting.   For you, the most important aspect of sexual expression is sincerity.   You have a significant ability to sublimate sexuality into other realms of affection. You may find much emotional satisfaction in caring for your partner in ways that are not physically sexual. The best relationship for you is one that is long-lasting, so that you have ample opportunities to express your love over a long period of time.      Moon in the Third House   You usually express your loving feelings verbally, and you should not hesitate to let your lover know just how you feel.   It is also a good idea to talk out personal problems extensively with your lover, because for you, that is the best way to deal successfully with them.   Indeed, words may be your primary method of transmitting love and understanding at all levels. In any intimate situation, your words of love and encouragement will heighten the sexual experience, so don't hold back.   Your best relationship with a lover is one that is chummy and casual, with much of the intimate informality of a brother-sister relationship.      Venus in Libra   A quiet, uneventful affair is boring to you, for it is continual change and growth that keep you interested and creative in a love relationship.   You insist that you and your lover be equal, not in a static equilibrium, but rather a continuing readjustment that keeps both partners on an even basis.   You particularly admire physical beauty in a lover, but do not let a person's appearance blind you to the beauty in his or her soul.   In the long run, you will be most satisfied with an all-around lover whose accomplishments and qualities are not just physical but extend in many directions.      Venus in the Twelfth House   At times you may find it difficult to decide exactly what you want out of a relationship, or you may find out what you would really have enjoyed only after the affair is over.   For this reason, it is a good idea to prolong your courtship in order to find out what each partner wants and expects before making a commitment.   You appreciate a lover who doesn't discuss your personal life with others; in fact, you are quite attracted to the idea of carrying on an affair in secret.   Note: Venus is technically near the end of house 11 and is therefore interpreted in house 12.      Mars in Sagittarius   You tend to approach any involvement, sexual or otherwise, with gusto, jumping right into what's happening without much ado.   You have a particular talent for bringing an overly thoughtful or melancholy lover out of the dumps and into a gleeful love session by your own open and positive approach.   Your sexual style borders on the athletic, providing a very energetic and healthful way of keeping yourself in trim. But take care not to neglect the more tender forms of love communication.   Be sure that your partner's fantasies and your own do not remain unfulfilled. In fact, a lover who fills in the details of your sexual expression would be ideal.      Mars in the Second House   You express your love in very physical ways - not bodily, but by surrounding your loved one with a variety of physical comforts, gifts and tangible tokens of love.   This is an excellent position in that you can achieve an endless variety of sexual stimulation simply by altering your physical surroundings to make them more sensual and pleasing.   On the negative side, you tend to be physically possessive of your lover, with all the problems that incipient jealousy brings.      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Love - Short Edition   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   for K(female)  born on 13 Nov 1980 local time 06:14 am  in Sioux City, IA (US) U.T. 12:14  96w24, 42n30 sid. time 09:19:27   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Planetary positions  planet sign degree house motion  Sun Scorpio 21°16'57 01 direct  Moon Capricorn 25°12'16 03 direct  Mercury Scorpio 04°05'09 12 direct  Venus Libra 17°03'14 11/12 direct  Venus is technically near the end of house 11 and is interpreted in house 12.

(enter lust here.)  so i worked all day on easter. and then i didnt get to go to an english mass, despite the catholic guilt complex. dad went to some woman named claudias parents house in cherokee with her and her kids. and mom went to bills parents. and jus was with amber and her family. and me? i went to lisas and then out with S and her mom. she got me a basket. is that sweet? im glad i have some "family" here.  ellen sent me pics of easter at joes. i am grateful. she knows i miss everyone although i never vocalize it.  some people are good at reading me, and i dont have enough of those people around.  S can. lisa can a lot. the girls i love at home could once.   .......sad.  so. something is right under my skin fighting its way out and i dont want to deal with it.   dearest SF i miss you, please visit me. i think i was closer with you than anyone so far. mentally. you know? we never had to say a damn word. move here?  everything going as it is has left me feeling like something is missing. and i know what it is.  i miss the contact. the humanity of it. what brings us all together.  where is that? goddamn..........................  so. yeah. i cant verbalize anything, but the moral of all of this BS is that i miss a lot of people.... and some people that have yet to come along.   -fin-

      i gave you the ability to hurt me. im coming to understand that in this specific circumstance people cant bother you/ hurt you/ disrespect you without your permission or acceptance of it. and i need to learn how to take things for what they are, no more, no less.   oh so jaded for 23.  and i blame you when i hurt. but its my fault. im too passionate about things when it comes to my emotions. i hate that about myself.  sometimes this life IS for the birds. and then there is a sweet cool breezy june night where you can be alone with your red wine, a smoke and your thoughts, and step outside yourself for a minute and see that no matter what it may feel like, oh sensitive dreamer, things are not as bad as they seem. not as harsh as you think. not always personal.  i mean......... i need to remember that. no more anxious feeling, ok? not everything people say/ dont say/ do/ dont do/ imply/dont imply needs to be taken to heart and played (and replayed and replayed) to death in the audio memory. its a very very destructive habit.  as i said, im too young to be so jaded. for having  some  intrensic smarts i need to rise above the drama. enjoy what there is to enjoy and not put it on the back burner as i obsess on potential negatives. i think i am wasting my life this way.  just because i said exactly what i mean doesnt mean i meant what i said.  but i miss you. youve been in my head/ heart a lot lately.  its not often that my feelings towards a person interacted with my happiness (being based on their happiness alone.)  im reading an amazing book by a man who seemingly is the most non-pretencious spin writer ive ever seen. and hes very introspective and can laugh about his own misery and bad decisions and emotional turmoil and lost love and suicidal tendencies and addiction and ocd behavior and morally inept excursions. and its quite healing. the whole time i think "reuniting the smiths! i love the smiths! i hope he pulls it off!" when in all reality i know damn good and well he didnt. no fear, mr. morrisseys record cant be selling as he had hoped, although all this wiltern dates sold out in seconds. so yeah, reunite?   "why with so many people in this beautiful world does anybody have to be alone"

      i think that harvest (neil young, thank you) is such a good record it hurts.  today someone told me that anyone who has carried paul westerberg's golf clubs is their hero. me, a hero?  ahh, i miss the music biz. id rather work as a music bitch over anything in film, anyday.   speaking of the film biz, today was so hard. i felt like i wasnt measuring up. (i was.) like i couldnt do anything right, whether i did or not. (i did.) like a fraud.  and i hate that feeling. i almost cried to the person(s) who called me on my lunch, being clearly premenstural, but i refrained.   i hate that.  what is going on with me lately? good god. like J said, i'll get it and it will be fine. it WILL be fine. everything.  boo. i heart mc chris

      654694677 I wonder sometimes what it is that she thinks about me. She never just says she misses me. She only says it after I do. So I think I just wont say it until she does from now on. I wonder how I am in her life. I have such a hard time trying to figure out her moods. Sometimes she seems really really into me and interested and others she just seems so ambivalent. I go back and forth in my head about this all the time and I feel like it is starting to take over. I just start to feel so lost and I cant think. I don't know what she is going to tell me this weekend. I don't know how I will react to it all. I am so scared right now to know and it is eating me up inside. I should have said it. I think she could feel it that day on the curb. But I didn't know how she would react. I didn't know if she would say it back or even if she feels that way about me. I just couldn't imagine her driving away after that. I'm starting to freak out again. This is hard.
