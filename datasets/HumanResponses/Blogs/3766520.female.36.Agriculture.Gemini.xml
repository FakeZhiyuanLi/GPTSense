      Tears fill my eyes,red & Puffy,Cruing for HOURS on End,Endouring the pain I feel of the world,Relieving the embarassment,Engulfed in Vunerability.Enraged by lack of self control,Ashamed to Accept responsibilties of Action,and mirrored reflections.Casting Always Judgement Upon others,and Self,Never accepting  the Deeper difinitions of self description. Covering your eyes in GREAT Shame to the the obvious obstrictions of True Beauty.Upon tiled floors drop after drop crimson liquid pools draining essence,taking in the shame/guilt ending the embarassement,sweeping up the shattered pieces of the mirrored reflection of a lost soul vunerable,and all alone too ashamed to ask for help Too scared to  continue on,six feet under in a Cold Dark Grave lies the Truth in reality,dressed in White,adorned with flowers laying in wait of a angelic Guide.

      You are in a  crowd,yet by yourself for where you want to go.You Struggle,do alittle better,,then backslide,to where you were before and feel guilty about it.. Realize that you that you can't be or do  whatyou are destined to alone. You Need God,but God is sends guidance in physical form.In a Human..

      I have Always been the type of person who likes to  have control over my Own  life,and the Lives of those who came into mine at any stage.Control seems to be a word I was born with on my lips if you speak to my mother,brothers,and sister,husband,and children..I Don't know if this came from my Gemini Birth sign,those Dreaded inherited genes,or Influences from my Past Life Lessons..Suffice to say that I guess you could say that I Liked to have some say in what was happening around me,to me and from within me..Through all my questioning,and turnings this I guess was one element which remained consistent so I guess it was trying to tell me that at least something was "RIGHT" for me...This could well explain the Many Battles i had during my Earlier years with Imposed Conditions and Thoughts being thrust at me..It is No Wonder that I spent Most of my Time Questioning and Rebelling when Others seem to Want Control,sooo Many ofMy thoughts and actions Many have SUCCEEDED back then..When I Look back I Wish i DID have control being a Victim of Physical,Emotional,Sexual Abuse..When I look back even to troubled times in my life,I could see that I Still had an element of control within me..I could let my Mother,or Other BULLIES know they were hurting me,or stand Firm and Pretend their words,and Actions meant little..It was an Act but again,it was that Control Aspect which allowed me to put on a mask to people and situations so that they would never Know the FULL Extent of My Emotions or Thoughts..it meant that I Also spent a Great Deal of time coming to terms with issues in the Dark of the night when there was Only me to witness the TRUTH of the situations..I Allowed myself to be Controlled by others...To be Victimized..These reflections gave me Courage to Face each New daymans to place burdens of the Previous day fairly,and squarely in the laps of those who tried to take my control from me..But,Hindsight,it now becomes quite clear that sometimes the determination to retain control almost sent me over the brink.The control aspect is one of the Main Reasons why I take back mine..I was  Sooo SICK of being  a Victim!!...Allowing  Others to"BULLY" me around because I'm "DIFFERENT" from Everyone Else..Just because I cannot hear them,DOESN'T Give them the God Given Right to  push,and shove me around..I had soooo Many conflicts with teachers,etc. who  teach one particular thing in one particular way to vary or modify the subject in question to suit individual needs.It just wouldn't sink in to me..For instance,One of my lessons was to Stand up for WHO,and WHAT I REALLY Am,and that's a Human Being!..Not let people critercize me,and "BULLY" me around..She put it in a particular sort of way that had me"STUMPED".When I got home,I Tried  to put my meditation into action.I guess  we could foccuss on the negative aspects of control in negative fashion,it is still important to remember that having control over  certain situations can be a very empowering thing..Taking ownership of something and controlling the ways it used in your life can help to tailor teachings and concepts to your own individual needs..Not everybody learns at the same pace or in Same way..it's up to Us to determine what we Both Need to Learn in a way these lessons will take place..Taking control of My Destiny meant that I allowed Opportunities to present themselves at the Right Time and the Right Place,,It also meant that I would spend Many hours weighing up the pros,and cons of Various options presented to me,,I no longer blindly follow the crowd in which I followed that was WRONG for me..I found myself beginning to REALLY Think about Where I Wanted to be headed and What I Wanted to be doing with the REST of My Life.One of the Most Revealing Things happen to me lately,It was Amazing for me and I felt like the Ropes that bound me Freed,and Released me from the Restrictions was Wonderful! Because i am a person who has Always learned  pretty much eveything the"HARD WAY",and who has Always followed "Blindly" into the footsteps of others I have Always found sets of routines,and structures to be RESTICTING!..Throughout my life,this has cast me  the Beat of a different drum and also had to conform to set the standards within myself as society expected.This progress in Many  things I've done Purely Because creativity and individually has been such a Hard subject for me..

      On November of 2002,I was driving to a job interview when I got lost,and lost control of my vehicle..I rolled my car COMPLETELY Over unto  his top,into a Ditch!..i was"Knocked Out"..When it was an Angel(And DO mean Angel..I Never gotten his name,or number so my husband could call him,and THANK Him Properly..He just VANISHED!!)who found me,and came to rescue me,and pull me soo Gently out of my Crushed Car..My heart was just trembling,and my body was aching soo badly as IF I Had Broken Bones all over the place..I seen the"Light" or something "White",and then I seen this"GUY"..He pulled me out from under my Crushed car,and Told me,I am back here on Earth..Till that day i been rather Confused as to WHY?...Because it was Not my "Time",and there's things I was called to do here on Earth.There is INDEED Angels..And I'm One of em'..I have encountered Numerous of Angels in my Life time,and I Must Say,I DO Believe! And what do you Know,There's One Now! ^i^ ^i^ ^i^

      When things go wrong,as they sometimes will,When the road you're truding seems all up hill,When funds are Low,And debts are High,And you Want to Smile but all you do is sigh,and Cry,When care is pressing you down a bit,rest if you must,But Don't Quit.Life is queer with its twist and turns as Everyone of us Learns,And Many a failure turns about,When he might have won had he stuck it out,Don't give up though the pace seems slow, You may succeed with another blow. Sucess is failure Turned inside out,The Silver Tint of the clouds of doubt,And you Never Can tell how Close you are it may be near when it Seems so far,So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit,Than you Must Not Quit..
