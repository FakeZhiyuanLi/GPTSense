      I've got a problem because a minute ago called my friend- Marcin .He wanted to go with me to the cinema or something and I didn't know what to tell him bacause i didn't want to go with him bacause I don't like him so much but i couldn't told him that, could I??I can't be so cruel. I told him that I'm leaving to my grandparents for a week but after that he would phone me again and what I would tell him I can't lie him any more, but I can't tell him the truth too. Please tell me what should I do.

      Here in Poland it's 10.35 in the evening and I've just watched my favourite film,, The Virgin Suicides" where the most handsome guy in the world Josh Hartnett is playing the main character. I've seen this film about 6 times but I still love it. But films that I really love are horrors I think these kind of films are the best!And I also like films about drugs like ,, Thirteen" with Evan Rachel Woods who is very good actress I think. I know that my note is boring but who cares. I supposethat nobody would give me a comment anyway so why should I write interesting things if nobody would read it. So please!!!Can anyone give me that one stupid comment!!!!??????

      I thought that you'll maybe comment my note but you didn't and I'm very dissapointed....:)but seriously I've just watched ,, Moulin Rouge" with my friends Caroline and Aga, that was a great film. I don't really like Nicole Kidman but she played very well in that film. Now we're watching ,, Gilmore girls" my favourite soup opera. But here in Poland we had got just 2 series of it but that's o.k. I don't mind. But I'm jelaous of it that you have all the films earlier taht here in Poland and that makes me furious!!!!!!But I'm not complaining. So I would like you to comment my note, please:)and thx

      Hi everyone  This is my first note and I don't know what exactly i could write about but I'll say a few words about myself. My name is Sonia and I'm 15. I'm from Poland and I live in the capital of Poland-Warsaw. My favourite music is punk, rock and nu-metal . My favourite bands are Good Charlotte, Blink 182, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Slipknot and Korn but the most I like is Good Charlotte. Now I'm sittink in my pink room with my best friend Aga who came to me for a week because she leave far away from my town. It's boring now because the weather is awful and we're sitting at home and doing nothing. I don't know what else can I say. I'm wondering if you like my blog but we'll see.
