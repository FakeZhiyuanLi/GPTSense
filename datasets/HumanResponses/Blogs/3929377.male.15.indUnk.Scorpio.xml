      There are a lot of things I wish I could do. No, that sounds corny, let me start again.  Four of my cousins let today. Two more and then it'll just be my brother and I, with my grandparents and my uncle left here at the house. That'll be ok, but a lot quieter, and by quieter I mean more boring.  The sad part is, the four that already left didn't say bye to me. The oldest one; Claudia, who's 19; was mad about something, and cried all last night and didn't say a word this morning. That's too bad, that she had to leave and all, we were just starting to be friends. It's not easy making up for 4 years away from each other. I'm not really sure when I'll see her again, but I hope I get to say good-bye to her.  My other cousins are getting back, which means I'll have to get off soon, but oh well. I'm drawing a blank right now anyways.  Sweet dreams, or have a nice day, whichever. Maybe both. Crap, I confused myself again.

      Hey man, I don't actually have anything to say right, or at least can't think of anything. The thing is once you start this thing, you can't stop. So even though I don't really know what to add, and in fact don't even  want  to add, I feel strongly compelled to all the same.   P.S. After writing all that out I thought of something to say.  The reason I haven't been on, or updated in the last 2 days is because 1. My uncle rebooted the computer and we had to re-install everything. 2. My cousins are whiny, crybaby, internet-hogs whose friends are 90 miles away, compared to my 10,000. I definitly win that one.  P.P.S. I thought of something else to write. I watched all 3 parts of the Godfather movies in the last week. And they were pretty cool. I wanna be a Mafia guy.  "Le politica y le crimen son la misma cossa." (Politics and crime are one and the same.) -Micheal Corleone,  The Godfather Pt. III

       Ok, so I remembered what conclusion; crap, I can't remember which it was; was, but here it is:  Conclusion ________ is that the song Happy Holidays You Bastard by Blink 182 off their Takeoff, Pants and Jacket should be the anthem of our time. For those of you not so familiar with it, here are the lyrics:  It's christmas eve and I've only wrapped two fuckin' presentsI  t`s christmas eve and I've only wrapped two fuckin' presents  And I hate, hate, hate your guts,I hate, hate, hate your guts,  And I'll never talk to you again,  unless your dad will suck me off  I'll never talk to you again  unless your mom will touch my cock  I'll never talk to you again  ejaculate into a sockI  'll never talk to you again,  I'll never talk to you again  &nbsp;  It's Labor day and my grandpa just ate seven fuckin' hot dogs  It`s Labor day and my grandpa just ate seven fuckin' hot dogs  and he shit shit shits his pants.  He's alway's fuckin' shittin his pants  And I'll never talk to you again  unless your dad will suck me off  I'll never talk to you again  unless your mom will touch my cock  I'll never talk to you again  ejaculate into a sock  I'll never talk to you again,  I'll never talk to you again  Crap, now that that's written out it doesn't seem so great, but when you hear it it's awesome. Sorry about he potty mouth, it was a necessary evil.  So long suckers!

          Having like 15 people around and still being lonely combined with having nothing to do gives you a lot of time to think. I've used this thinking time.... pretty  productively, I think. By productively I mean only about 20% of my thoughts were about sex.   Haha, I'm funny.  The other 80% of the time I've been philosiphasizing or however the hell you spell it, and coming to conclusions.   The very first one is that being dissapointed sucks. I'm not sure how much I can elaborate on that, but I think that sentence says the whole idea.  The not-so-first one is that I forget things easily. A good example is that I forgot the ACTUAL not-so-first conclusion I made.  The second conclusion I came to was I don't really know what love is. Stupid topic, I know, but I realized so many movies/books/TV shows are about love, but no one really knows what love is. Do you? I at leat do not. I've been working on it though. I think maybe...it has to do with thinking about the person all the time. And when you think about them you think of nothing but their happiness. That's right, not your happiness together, but her, I mean the person's happiness alone. Or together, or however they want. Even if the person's happiness depends on something else, that's all I want. Or you should want. Ahh fuck it. I think I might be in love. I wouldn't make a very good spy.  The third conclusion is once again that I'm terrible at remembering things.  The fourth conclusion is that under the right circumstances, ANYTHING is good on TV.  The fifth is a little tricky to explain, seeing as I haven't come up with it yet.  The sixth conclusion that came to me is that sometimes, you think you're doing really well. That you're making a lot of progress. And right when you think things are best it turns out you were all wrong and that you're right where you started.   The seventh conclusion is that I'm a dumbass and even if all my work has been for nothing I'll just start over and try again. Like a fucking cat going after a ball of yarn that's being held to high for it to reach. Yeah that's me, the dumb-fucking helpless cat. The sad part is I like it. (Let the record show that conclusions 2 and 7 are not related)  I don't think I should type out the other 20% of my thoughts, since I don't know who read this and I would like to preserve the innocence of our youth.  &nbsp;  Yeah ok, so most of those things were bullshit, but it was a good punch line, eh?

      A strange thing happened today....NOTHING.  No...not really, more like  I  did nothing, which from my point of view is the same thing. Funny things...points of views.This is where I have a story about points of views, and I actually do have one this time.  So this Senator goes to have dinner at a restaurant. His name is Roberts, it's name is Molto Bene. The nicest Italian restaurant in DC. So Senator Roberts is having a fine meal at The Molto Bene. He orders and enjoys all his courses, has three bottles of the finest wine in the house. In the middle of the meal, the senator is putting butter on his bread, but he only has enough for half the bread.  He calls a waiter over and he says "Hey waiter, give me some more butter." Now, unfortunatel for the senator, this was during the great butter shortage of '99, so the restaurant was really rationingit's butter. So the waiter says "I'm sorry sir, I'm not allowed to hand out any more butter." Then the senator said "Come on now kid, just a little more to finish off my bread" "I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to do that." Answered the young waiter. The Senator stood up, the very image of anger, and said, nearly screaming "Kid! Do you know who you're messing with? I am Chairman of 3 Committees! I am President of the Senate! I hold world leaders and multimillionaires under my thumb! And you won't give me more butter! Just who do you think you are?!?!" "I'm the kid with the butter, sir."  It all depends on where you're coming from....  &nbsp;  I guess I did some things though. I got online for a while, that's what I'm doing right now. Kaley IMed me today. It's been a loooong time since I talked to her. We asked each other stupid questions, she told me about Cody, and I told her about "The Whole Blair Thing." She's a good kid, I wish we had been better friends this past year. Maybe next year will be better than last (in that respect).  I realized that it's been 20 days since I talked to Amy. I'm a little mad at her still. The hard part is figuring out why. I couldn't really say...I kinda felt betrayed though. I'm gonna change all that once I get back.  Ummm I'm pretty sure that's all for now, it's 4 am here, and I'm a little sleepy. So good night then.

      Third time in 2 days, I'm getting better at this.  Pretty normal day today, got up at 2 pm Chile time, had breakfast, and took a shower. Then my cousin asked if I wanted to go to Valparaiso Ave. with her, and I acquiesed.  So off we went to Valparaiso Ave. We went to this place kinda like Saturday Market, lots of crazy stuff.  She bought some thingies for her hair and I bought a belt that would have been like 20-something dollars for abou four. It's great.  That took just about all of my day.  Oh yes, also, Amanda makes no sense and is bad at insulting and gets mad about almost anything. So never tell her your true opinion on something if it might conflict with her opinion. Apparently agreeing with her is worth more than telling the truth.  And: no, saying that two people aren't very good together is NOT the same as saying that one isn't good enough for the other.  Freaking morons....

          It's true, now that 've done it a couple times I can't have enough.  Guitar songs I've learned since I got here: Stairway to Heaven (partly) Good Riddance (entirely) On by Metallica (intro) That One Meieval Song That Everyone Know (mostly) Mary Had a Little Lamb Skip To My Lou The Titanic Song by Celine Dione Blackbird (polished off)  This has been a productive trip indeed.

      Yeah, so I've never posted one of these thingies before. It's kinda scary, actually.   What are you supposed to say in these things anyways?  Well, I guess I started this thing 'cause I'm about to go on a month-long trip to Chile. So I guess I started it so...people could know what I'm doing and stuff. I would rather I could just know what other people are doing...but this works too.   Um...so I guess that's all for now.   Come back soon to find out about my exciting adventures in Chile!

      I have the worst luck with airports: They wouldn't let us on a flight 'cause it was "too full." We almost missed the flight after that 'cause of that stupid rescheduling. I got taken out at the stupid freaking security gates for random checks MOTHER F-ING TWICE. AND they lost all our bags ('cause of the stupid unnecessary rescheduling). Well they got to Portland 5 hours later. But they still were lost for a little. So like I said, I have the worst luck with airports.  So the day I got back, I went to Terra Linda with Amy and Drew. We walked there from Drew's house (we could have gotten a ride, but Amy thought Terra Linda was only 2 blocks away. It's actually about 2 miles.) We were supposed to meet Monique, Jackie, Justin, Nick and some other people there, but Nick had dislocated his knee while we were walking so they were all at the hospital when we got to the school. What are the odds of that right? So then we went to Nicole's house and hung out there for a while. Then Amy and I had to go home so we waited on the corner of the Rec Center to get picked up, but her parents never came, so we had to walk home. It was 95 yesterday. We walked a total of like 5 or 6 miles. That didn't really help my plan to rid myself farmer's tan forever.  I finally met my bass on Wednesday. OH MAN! THE THING IS FRIGGIN' AWESOME! WHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! It sounds awesome, and it looks awesome, and it feels awesome (don't ask) and it's awesome. Congratulations to me.  Ok, so yesterday. Eric, Aaron, Sara and I went swimming. Before we went, Eric came over, and we put contact paper on a deck of cards. AND MADE THEM WATER-PROOF!!!! And it worked too! WE ARE FREAKING GENUISES!!! Well it was Eric's idea, but I helped make them so I get some credit too. Well they mostly worked, there were 2 or 3 that got a little soggy, but 'cause of the contact paper they stayed stiff and they still worked. We played 13 in the pool before Sara got there and then Go Fish when she was with us. It was great, but it takes a lot of leg work. Then, after we were done swimming, Sara had to go, but there were these three girls sitting close to the pool eating cake. And Aaron and I went to ask for some and they gave us the rest of it. So then Eric, Aaron and I sat on the curb and ate the rest of their Horse-cake. It was great. We're such bums...  Well, I'd best be going to play with my beautiful bass som'more.  So I'll catch ya later, man. (Like Bart says)

      I got this really cool mail. It was a chain letter, but it was kinda funny for once. So here it is:  Only in America......  Do drugstores make the sick walk all the way to the back of the store to get their prescriptions while healthy people can buy cigarettes at the front.  Do people order  double  cheeseburgers,  large  fries, and a  diet  coke.  Do banks leave both doors open and then chain the pens to the counters.  Do we leave cars worth thousands of dollars in the driveway and put our useless junk in the garage.  Do we buy hot dogs in packages of ten and buns in packages of eight.  Do we use the word 'politics' to describe the process so well: 'Poli' in Latin meaning 'many' and 'tics' meaning 'bloodsucking creatures'.  Do they have drive-up ATM machines with Braille lettering.   EVER WONDER ...  Why the sun lightens our hair, but darkens our skin?  Why women can't put on mascara with their mouth closed?  Why don't you ever see the headline "Psychic Wins Lottery"?  Why is "abbreviated" such a long word?  Why is it that doctors call what they do "practice"?  Why is lemon juice made with artificial flavor, and dishwashing liquid made with real lemons?  Why is the man who invests all your money called a broker?  Why is the time of day with the slowest traffic called rush hour?  Why isn't there mouse-flavored cat food?  Why do they sterilize the needle for lethal injections?  You know that indestructible black box that is used on airplanes? Why don't they make the whole plane out of that stuff?!  Why don't sheep shrink when it rains?  Why are they called  apart ments when they are all stuck together?  If con is the opposite of pro, is Congress the opposite of progress?   Yeah, that was it. That's a good one, isn't it. As far as chain letters go, anyways.  If flying is so safe, why do they call the airport the terminal?

      Great Ideas I've Had Recently:  A. Make: 1. A shirt that says "I hate wiggers" on it. (Originially "I love black people, but I f-ing hate wiggers" but I think that might get me in trouble.) 2. A shirt that looks like it came frrom abercrombie that says "I hate jocks" on it, or something along the lines.  B. Get bowling shoes and go bowling everyday I can.  C. Wear: 1. Do-rags every once in a while. 2. A real Scottish kilt if I can find it. No, that's not a joke.  D. Get a "Vote F*cker" shirt from my good buddy Geoff Smith over at the Oregon Bus Project.  E. Tell people I don't like to screw themselves.  That's all for now, tell me if you have any good ideas of your own.

      So ok, last night, I was thinking. And I couldn't think of a single reason why feelings are said to come from the heart other than because Hallmark says so. So I decided that MY feelings come from my spleen.  There's a spot in a my spleen for all of you.  I just got back from a trip to the north today. The drive each way took about 5 hours. more or less 500 km. That's about the distance from Portland to Vancouve BC. Only towards the Equator. It's warmer that way. You know...since it's winter here and we're in Southern Hemisphere and everything.  Awwww crap, I don't feel very inspired very right now. I'm only actually updating because Eva told me. And I kinda do what I'm told most of the time. It's just the way I was raised. And I...crap I'm boring.  Actually, I bought that acoustic I was talking about before. Well, classical, but whatever. It souunds really nice and deep and it was only about $60US. Which is awesome. I know have all the guitars I could need. Actually...it'd be nicee to have a decent electrtic....oh well. Another day.  Uh....I'm coming back on Wednesday, I leave at 4 pm Portland time, add like 30 hours to that and that's when I land. God damn distances, they always screw me over.  ALWAYS.  I miss everyone and I feel like giving lots of hugs. TO EVERYONE! Huge ones that last hours. God damn it I miss people.  When we were coming back from La Serena today, I realized that I-5 runs all the way from Canada to Chile. I've decided that I'm going to drive all the way one summer.  Gotta go watch Shrek 2 with my uncle and co.  "What kind of a knight are you!" "One of a kind..."

       William, your sexual personality is Omega-ETDN-9.   urlLink    Your sexual personality is determined by your sexual persona (Omega), 4 sexual scales ( E motional/Physical, Look/ T ouch,  D aring/Modest, Verbal/ N on-verbal), and your libido score (9).       As an Omega, you are someone who feels sexy, looks sexy, and really knows the ropes when it comes to lovemaking. Your sex appeal is more overt than others and your sexual confidence and awareness are particularly high.     Wow, check that out, I feel sexy. And apparently I'm daring too. Does that mean I like chains, leather and whips? I wouldn't really know since I've never tried them...hehehehehehe.    JEEZE-US. The sky just cracked and all the water in the world spilled out. It sounds like all those motherfucking drops of water wanna make the roof collapse on me.  Damn, I was gonna make it short, but I¡m feeling inspired.  Yeah, if that's what you wanna call it.  I went bowling again today. With my brother, uncle and uncles girlfriend. My brother and I conned my uncle into paying for it. It was pretty uneventful. Except we got 3 strikes in a row and my uncle decided it was good luck to say "Por la fucking shit" before throwing the ball. It actually worked pretty well for us.  Ummm I slept in until 4:30 today, watched TV in bed until 5:30. I couldn't remember what day of the week it was. My uncle said that was a sign I was having a good vacation. I told him it was a sign he had drunk too much.  Funny guy, my uncle.  Good night. And if nothing else, be happy the rain doesn't have a fued going against the wood in your house.

      Hello children.  The last of my cousins left today. It's reaaaaally quiet right now. Granted it's 1 am, but that shouldn't stop sound waves from being dispersed.  I went bowling today. First game I got 69. Second game I got 2 strikes and 2 spares and I got 103. Not bad, the second time around, but I usually get 115 more or less. Oh well, we were screwing around a lot. [Wow, that sounded really snobby, but I've decided to only the backspace button for mispelled words here. You know, to keep myself honest.] It was weird, 'cause this place used the same balls and screens as Sunset Lanes does back home, it was homesicking for me.(I know that's not a word.) My cousin Esteban, who I just realized is 17, found this size 6 ball, that had no holes in it, and he like launched it down the lane a bunch of times. Until he threw it like 3/4 of the way down through the air, and the manager came over and yelled at him a little. Hehe.  At the lane next to us, there was this girl. It was weird, she wasn't "hot" but she was attractive in a mysterious sort of way. She looked like she was a year younger than I, maybe less, and she was wearing jeans with a skirt over them with a studded belt over that. It was funny, 'cause I could tell the belt was from the same hands that made mine. I thought she was there with her parents and her older brother; who looked about 19; at first. That was until they kissed after she knocked down  1  pin. Ha, she had a little trouble with that. It was really weird. I dunno why I put that in here, but it stuck out in my day, so I guess I kinda had to.  Three pieces of good news involving music. #1: I'm pretty sure my dad bought my bass yesterday. I know that makes me sound like some spoiled rich kid, but between my brother and I we're paying for most of it, so don't give me crap. Fender Mexican Made P-Bass. Come over anytime, I'll show it to you. #2: My grandpa got through to my cousins and they left the classical guitar here. HA TAKE THAT SUCKERS. So I still have soemthing to keep learning on, 'cause I'm getting tons better. Really, 'cause I was terrible, but I can play a bunch of things now, like you can tell from previous posts. #3: Today, when I was at the mall; 'cause that's where the bowling alley is, on the top floor; we were walking and I saw some acoustic guitars for about $40US. I'm gonna go back later this week with my brother and see if we can't buy one.  Uhhhhhhhh one more thing. For those of you that have been reading this since the beginning. For those few of you that read it at all, there are some things in here that....I posted thinking I knew who would read it. I was generally wrong. For example the whole "you" affair...at the time I thought there was only one person reading this, I'm sorry for the rest of you that had to endure it.  Oh yeah, and there are some words I do not use lightly. Words that I will not use unless I know that I will mean them under all circumstances. A few examples of those are love, hate, and bacon.  Good night.

      Dude, Fight Club is a pretty cool movie. Except for the fighting, ironically enough. I guess that just leaves the club. Ha. I'm so dumb sometimes...but seriously, up until the part where the dude realizes him and Tyler are the same person, and all the blood, of course, that movie is very cool. I like the idea of starting a guerilla army to bring down consumerism. Sadly, the social and economical implications of doing it in one stroke the way it's done in the movies are much to catastrophic to be plausible. I guess that's why it's a movie, huh?  Nothing new here in Chile-land, just trying to get used to the boredom. I was better off at home, where even if I fried, I could be a tan fry. And I mean, not that I'm pale, but I was THIS CLOSE *holds fingers closely together* to getting rid of my farmer's tan; a couple more days swimming and it would have been done. Oh well, I guess I'm just gonna have to let by-gones be by-gones.  (So you can move the hell on, you and yo' momma.)  Uhhhhhh....It's 3:40am, give me a break.  I realized that cheap, soft-core porn is the same in any language. I mean....yeah.  Good fucking morning, Sunshine.
