       the funniest thing happend last night.. i was in my upstairs bathroom brushing my teeth n getting ready for bed.. (this was around midnight) and all of a sudden this HUGE moth flew in through the open window.. and i freaked out.. it was HUGE anywaiz.. i was trying to whack it with a towel, and then i tried to get it with a tissue.. and then shan came in to help me.. finally we decided to trap it with a empty toilet paper roll and so i trapped it inside the roll and shan slid a book underneath it.. then we tried to thhrow the moth out the window.. i shook the toilet paper roll and then i looked inside to see if the moth was gone but it was right by my hand and it scared me so i screamed really loud and ran to my bedroom.. with shan close on my heels.. we were laughing so hard.. finally we decided to try again.. this time we filled the toilet paper roll half with tissue so it couldnt touch my hand coz i was scared of it.. and then we threw the whole roll out the window.. we were laughing sooooooooooo hard.. and my mom and dad both told us today that they got woken up by our loud laughter n screaming.. HAHA it was funny.. another funny experience was the other night.. me and shan and malc n zack were home alone and it was like 9:30.. we were sitting around the computer.. and it was really dark.. we were getting scared.. coz i saw this weird flash through the other window so i decided to go close all the blinds.. i got up and it was really scary so i told shan to come with me.. malc n zack followed.. i closed all the blinds.. and i had to close the window in the kitchen.. as i was closing it zacks hand brushed against my butt and it freaked the life out of me.. i SCREAMED so loud that they all started screaming and ran from the kitchen.. then we were sitting aroudn the computer and we all hear a thump.. then we saw another flash and then heard another thump.. by now our nerves were really on edge so on the next thump we all got up and ran into the next room which is my sis's bedroom and HID there.. realizing that there were no blankets or anything to hide under, me and shan ran out to the family room and in two seconds flat grabbed and carried 2 blankets and 5 pillows back to the room.. there we spent our next 30 minutes hearing thumps and being scared.. we had the fone and decided to fone to see when my parents would come home.. we were REALLY scared.. finally someone came home..(it was my dad n jo but we didnt know that).. then jo came to her room and opened the door really slowly which freaked shan out and she screamed and we all started screaming and hid under the blankets.. jo must've thought we were nutz.. later on we were still freaked out like freaked out to answer the fone and go in the garage.. and we were genuinely scared the whole time.. but it was funny.. definitely funny..!

TUESDAY: unpacked from camping and basically did nothing  WEDNESDAY: did nothing again =(  THURSDAY: went to shans house to pick our song for special music and we tried to practice but robert wasnt there so derrick played for us but too high and derrick was trying to bring it down a key but it was difficult.. went to vancity and i slept over at her house too.. we watched maid in manhattan.. good movie! *thumbs up*  FRIDAY: woke up around 11 and watched bad boys (the first one) it was REALLY good!!! so suspenseful and funny too.. went to burnaby and vancity again to drop off shans aunt and then stopped by guildford for a bit to pick up sum stuff.. and then went back to the soongs house where me n shan washed derricks car, daniels car and their van.. it was fun i guess.. lol.. then we went downstairs n played sum good ol' nintendo!!

       get ready.. this is the only time i will ever say anything of this sort about America --------------------------------------------------------------------------   GOD BLESS AMERICA.. In memory of all those who lost their lives on this day 2 years ago (Except the b@$t@rd$ that drove the plane into the buildings) i'd like to dedicate this song:   Where is the Love  What's wrong with the world, mama People livin' like they ain't got no mamas I think the whole world addicted to the drama Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism But we still got terrorists here livin' In the USA, the big CIA The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK But if you only have love for your own race Then you only leave space to discriminate And to discriminate only generates hate And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah Badness is what you demonstrate And that's exactly how a n**** works and operates N**, you gotta have love just to set it straight Take control of your mind and meditate Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all  People killin', people dyin' Children hurt and you hear them cryin' Can you practice what you preach And would you turn the other cheek  Father, Father, Father help us Send us some guidance from above 'Cause people got me, got me questionin' Where is the love (Love)  Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love) Where is the love The love, the love  It just ain't the same, always unchanged New days are strange, is the world insane If love and peace is so strong Why are there pieces of love that don't belong Nations droppin' bombs Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug If you never know truth then you never know love Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know) Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know) Where's the love, y'all  People killin', people dyin' Children hurt and you hear them cryin' Can you practice what you preach And would you turn the other cheek  Father, Father, Father help us Send us some guidance from above 'Cause people got me, got me questionin' Where is the love (Love)  Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love) Where is the love The love, the love  I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder Most of us only care about money makin' Selfishness got us followin' our own direction Wrong information always shown by the media Negative images is the main criteria Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria Kids act like what they see in the cinema Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity Whatever happened to the fairness in equality Instead in spreading love we spreading animosity Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found  People killin', people dyin' Children hurt and you hear them cryin' Can you practice what you preach And would you turn the other cheek  Father, Father, Father help us Send us some guidance from above 'Cause people got me, got me questionin' Where is the love (Love)  Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love)  Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love)  Dear God, plz be with those who are suffering today, grieving the loved ones they lost 2 years ago, and remembering that tragic morning when it all happend. touch everyones heart today and forever. let everyone forever remember that this is what war does to the world; it ruins everyone.. it tears apart homes, breaks little childrens hearts, leaves people devastated, and forever scars everyones mind with horrible memories.. plz dear God, bless America today..   Amen.

       *yawnz* this morning rachelle woke up very tired.. well its her own fault too coz she slept at like 1 sum'n which isnt very late, but seeing as she hasnt slept very late recently she isnt used to it.. anywaiz, yesterday terry, her boyfriend, came over and they rented Tomb Raider 1 & 2.. they seemed to enjoy the movies and watched till almost 11 o'clock at night which is when terry went home.. then Rachelle watched worthless shows on tv till 1 sum'n when she finally decided to go to bed.. this morning was spent playing a couple video games and then watching a few minutes of tv before diving into her book report book War & Peace which Rachelle claims is a book harder than it looks.. it may be thick but thats no problem, she thought she had read many thick books in short amounts of time but this one was different.. a book thicker than the Bible.. hmmm.. 1300+ pages.. it took her an hour to read 25 pages.. dang that is tough.. well, her goal is to read 100 pages each day and then she should be done by 2 weeks.. anywaiz, it looks as though rachelles family is going out for the day.. jo n zack hav ea bday party to go to and her mother n father are going to go xmas shopping.. that should give rachelle enough time to watch tomb raider 2 again because it is due tomoro morning at 10.. well, her family is leaving soon and she is saying that she should make herself look busy so that they dont get suspicious.. more to come later

       once upon atime on a gloomy gray friday afternoon, rachelle walked into the mall with the mission of buying xmas gifts on her mind.. with $78.50 in her wallet and her brother at her side she walked in and out of shops trying to find the perfect gifts for those close to her.. as she spotted the perfect gifts, her wallet slowly drained and so did her energy but that did not stop her.. the crowds did not stop her.. tired feet did not slow her pace.. she had a mission to accomplish and she was going to no matter what.. finally, after a grueling 2 and a half hours, rachelle trudged home with a weary smile on her face.. she had just accomplished a great and gloriously grand feat--beginning and finishing her christmas shopping in one day and in only 2 and a half hours too.. great job rachelle.. here is a reward commemorating your success--may you forever be known as the fastest most efficient shopper of all times.. [applause]

       a light verse poem i wrote for english a while back..   It flies on wings When you're having fun And drags its feet When there's nothing to be done  There is too much to do And never enough And to get some more Is extremely tough  Arriving at school late Dressed less than nicely Is definitely a result Of not planning wisely  Missing a curfew And coming home late A lecture from parents Glaring as they wait  If making priorities Is a skill that you lack You'd better learn fast Cause you cannot turn it back.

       rachelle, the shape of your hand reveals that you are especially good at Believing in yourself  that is what i got from a hand analysis quiz thing.. i had to like analyze my hand.. and yeah.. hmmm so im good at believing in myself?? interesting.. i figure i only believe in my self properly when i have a good reason to or that im not gonna fail for sure..  right now im taking another quiz thing.. its like what is my signature colour or sum'n..   rachelle, your signature color is Champagne        Champagne  A sophisticated soul like you is best matched with a classic color that's always tastefully chic. That's why Champagne is your perfect pairing. You're probably known for your impeccable taste in everything from clothes to music to restaurants. And it wouldn't surprise us if you also had an unparalleled ability to know just what to say or do to handle almost every situation gracefully. Don't get the idea that your simple elegance ever makes you boring: You've got a charming flavor that makes others hang on your words to the last drop â€” and you're not afraid to let your bubbly personality sparkle. Sure, you may get teased at times for your love of life's finer things, but you've got diplomatic skills that are likely to take you far, both in social, and professional, situations. So here's to you, Champagne. Cheers!    yeah.. ok.. or not.. i am so not sophisticated.. im like.. a "who cares" type of person.. but then again not too carefree.. if ya know what i mean.. ok ive had it with these quizzes.. no more.. for now..

       *sigh* a relaxing day spent at home (in front of the computer screen doing english project) instead of at school in those overly-uncomfortable desks that they make us sit in.. just worked on english project all day long with a few breaks in between which consisted of playing sum tony hawk with zack and downloading sum music/listening to it too.. got a gamecube today.. unfortunately, the deal which said it came with the game of "ATV Racing Quad 2" or sum'n like that which is really fun.. they didnt have that game so mom got baseball 2004 or sum'n likei that.. oh well i gues we'll keep it and then we can get our Mario games like Mario party 5 and MarioKart and stuff like that i luv mario games they're so much fun.. =) anywaiz.. i hope there is no school tomoro coz its a snowstorm warning for tomoro.. so my bet is there will either be no school or we will be let outta school early coz of the supposed snowstorm which i hope happens.. =D yay!! we could get up to a foot of snow tomoro and that would be wonderful.. then i would hve another day to waste on my english project.. hahaha.. i hope that i get that thing done in time.. and i hope mrs. graham gives us an extension on the project and our book reports.. =S mehh.. oh well i think this stupid towel turban on my head is getting heavy so i shall go and blowdry my hair now.. toodlez..

       today i am depressed for an unknown reason. i have absolutely no clue. i think it's all in my head. of course. everything is "in my head". mehh. anyways, youth rally was this weekend. went last night. it was ok. went today for the afternoon. it was ok. nothing spectacular though. didn't really get "spiritually renewed" or whatever. i wasnt feelin it.there was so no ppl there. like compared to last year and the year before there was no one there pretty much. i guess its true that yu cant duplicate the first time. the first youth rally i think it was cool. can't really remember, but i think it was cool. anyways, after lunch, me, terry, frances, jonathan, renan, and malc went for an afternoon stroll in God's nature. we walked from deer lake school (where they were holding the youth rally) to deer lake LAKE and stayed there for a bit. it was fun. we saw a dog with 3 legs. it was very friendly and oh-so-cute. i want a doggie =( anyways, after that it was small groups. we went to one on bullying and one on drugs. then we left and came home. terry came over. we did our bio pre-labs and bio notes and studied chem. i think the chem test will be easy. somewhat. yeah. now terry is playing super mario bros 3 on zacks gameboy and i am just listening as jo watches him. and yeah. ok. im bored. yeah i think i want to play nintendo on the computer. yay!!

       i am bored. it is 5:32. i am bored. my tummy feels funny too =( hmm. whats on the agenda for tonight? well i just finished helping mom with the dishes. im probly gonna go upstairs now and dive deep into the wonderful world of biology. ahh homework. speaking of biology, one of the fishies died during the night =( it was the pretty one too. come to think of it, it was probly sick. when i was lookin at it last night it was breathing really heavily/hard. maybe he was sick =( well even though it was a fish i had less than 12 hours im sad. mainly coz it was the pretty one. it was blue and the tail had like yellow spots on it. =( well at least petsmart has a 14 day return thing. if the fish dies you can get a refund. im gonna get another one. im still gonna be well i guess the feeling isnt sadness its just disappointment. its really depressing to look into a lil fish jar thing and see a fish lying dead on the bottom of the tank. whats more, the fish is lying in the other fishes crap. the orange fish was pooping all night. seriously. if i did as much poop as that fish did last night, i would have had to poop like twice my size in crap. that is nasty. anyways, we had sum assembly thing today. trinity western university came. well sum dude from there. it was ionno boring but yet not coz we gotta miss class. i was tired though. tomoro sum other school is coming. mr. hosking says they're like ionno he duznt like them. oh yeah. back to tonights agenda. bio homework, then piano, then flute, then go back to petsmart to get another fishie. maybe ill drive again tonight =D yay!! hmm i should get started so i can squeeze sum french into my agenda for tonight. =|

       i was sposed to post this yesterday, it being valentines day and all.. so yeah i forgot so ill post it now!! another one of them poems we had to write for english class.. this one is a sonnet..!!      Love     Love can be as strong as Waves rolling across the seas Or soft and subtle like jazz And wind whistling through the trees. Love can be expressed in what we say, Showing that we really do care, The way we act from day to day, Or even just being there. Love is faithful, it sympathizes, Cares, listens, and understands If it is hurt it doesn't despise It laughs, cries, and never demands. But the ultimate gift of love to us was given, Love unselfishly died so we could be forgiven.         so yeah my poem for Valentines day.. hope yu all had a good one (mine was great!!) and yeah..!!    "Happy Hearts Day!!"

Minute after minute passes by me Seconds speed by even faster  It's the same scenery for a very long time and a whole half a day until I see it again  I'm forever stuck in this very boring race-like cycle When will it ever end?  Round and round and round I go I never stop yet I go so slow.     **(this poem is about the hour hand on a clock in case yu didnt catch on =D)**

       i am in a joyous mood. today was good. i like days like today. even though i am more fond of the season called "autumn" actually i like it especially towards the end when its like autumn-winter. anyways. days like today make me feel really happy. and calm. the air was warm. the sun was shining. everyone was happy. i liked it a lot. days like today make me anticipate summer and getting out of school and wearing shorts and tank-tops. and waterfights. i luv waterfights. anyways. i wore a sleeveless shirt today. i felt extra summery =D.. nothing brought my mood down today. not even the socials test. i think i did ok on this one. probly high 70 or low 80 percent on this test. yep. today was good. *sighz* i went rollerblading with zack after eating supper. the weather was perfect. a warm breeze over my arms as i skated down the path on the powerlines. the sun was low in the sky. yep. i am happy. now i have to do chem hw. but that wont even bring me down. coz i luv chem. its fun. it gets more fun when we have to balance equations, but we're learning about moles right now and its sorta confusing. anyways. i shoudl go do that now. bye =D

       ok. i dont even know why people get up this early on sundays. i stayed on the computer till like 2:30 last night LOL. and then i woke up at like 8:53 ARGH so early. oh well. good start to a day. i guess moms right that if i stay in bed thats the reason for a splitting headache all day long. ive noticed that. i think my family may go swimming later on. that will give me time to go for a nice long run all by myself to clear my brain of the cobwebs of sleep that are lurking around the dark corners. well, i will have to continue this drivel later.. dad wants the computer.. yay..

       *yawnz*. i am so bored. and tired. and have nothing better to do than write boring nonsense in here. today was church. communion service. potluck. some choir practice thing. sitting in the church parking lot bored. practicing parking with dad. going home and sitting in front of the computer trying to find good christian music to download. most of the christian music is too diluted for me, if you knwo what i mean by diluted.... its soo unmodern. all christian songs need to be more like the song mary mary "shackles" or by souljahz "rap revolution". two christian songs with really good beats etc. i need more of that. hmmm. my room is messy. maybe i'll clean it and then lie down on my bed with a good book and my music playing on my beuatiful stereo. but i would have to clean my room first. that sux. ARGH.

       today was full of interesting stuff. i got a piggyback ride from zack, jo, AND mom. hehehe we went to the pool and i asked zack first to see if it would work and then i was like YAY!! and got rides from everyone. first piggyback from mom in years!!! another interesting thing from today was my breakfast. i ate chocolate chip waffles. mom thought they were blueberry waffles, but when she got home she figured out she was wrong. so yeah i was really hyper today. =D going to school today was pointless. the choir went to rehearse at deer lake school so half the class was gone. we did absolutely nothing productive today. i would have to say that the most productive thing we did was set up chairs for assembly. chem class we watched some chain reaction thing that mr. okimi brought with his physics class (which had only 2 students today) and we watched it with them. it was kinda interesting but the ppl had like soo much time on their hands to make it. like y'know for example: a ball starts rolling and then it hits something which knocks somethign over which spills this stuff which makes somethign else move. sum'n like that. a 30 video of sum'n LIFESIZE (like they used tires) and yeah ppl must've been so bored. anyways. for band since mrs. kettner was with the choir we didnt do anything. nathan conducted us. i think he had too much fun. we got through the song once and it was horrid! then for assembly this guy that is like a missionary came and talked and showed a video of some of his missionary work stuff. he goes to like africa and ministers to the bushmen ppl. he actually baptized that guy in the movie "the gods must be crazy" and yeah. kinda cool. after that it was lunch time. fun times. i always get a good laugh from lunch time. thanks guys, i luv you ALL!! ;) then after that was bio class. mr. hosking just played chess with like bren all period and since almost all the class was still gone we did whatever. doing whatever included listening to mr. hoskings cool music on his cool discman (its soooooo outdated... hahaha its like a huge box). we listened to his music which included Cher - "Believe". YES GOTTA LUV THAT SONG. SO AWESOME hahaha. mrs graham got mad at us because she was trying to teach a class across the hall and yeah i guess the bass was up too loud and she was in a bad mood. oh well. her problem. blah. after that was socials class and we did nothign except watch Janelle draw cool drawings. her drawings are hilarious coz she donno how to draw. her drawing went from a demented looking guy having a ball thrown at his head to Bin Laden throwing a bomb at some guy pushing a cart. hilarious. so. a pointless day at school. i came home and then me, mom, jo, & zack went to the pool. it was fun. and then i went to church for vespers thingy and talked to terry. so. my day was great. boring/pointless but great. tomoro is church and im gonna be bored coz no one will be there. oh well. i have to do ppt tomoro for alicia. yay. time for bed. me tired. *yawnz*

       today was cool. i enjoyed today. it was enjoyable. that is why it was cool and i enjoyed it! so. i went to school, like usual, and had a pretty good day. OMG we made the most yummiest thing in the world for home ec today: APPLE CRISP. it was delectably delicious =D now i am preparing my mind for some fascinating socials and mind-boggling chemistry homework. it's going to be so much fun. as you can see, i am very happy/hyper right now. *sighz*. ooh-ooh!! mom got a pass for the gym. i should tell frances, then we could go again like usual. it used to be so much fun. we would get so hyper on the treadmill and it was a blast. well. i think i shoudl go change the water of the fishies, and then its tiem to dive into learning with my homework. =D

       ok. i have almost decided to take back what i said earlier. i have a new philosophy. one word: optimism. thats what im gonna do now. i give it all to God. He will help me through. i will try my best to keep a happy face on and i will be optimistic. no more of this pessimistic bullcrap. from now on i refuse to let that take over my life. it can be quite depressing at times. it even drives me to do things that i wouldnt normlaly do. no i didnt do anythign stupid, but i did think about doing stupid things many times. but that is not me anymore. i have come to the realization that it is stupid to waste my life obsessing over things of the past that i cannot change. i will let everythign happen thats going to happen and i will adjust and adapt to whatever comes my way. anyways. you probly get the point im trying to make. whoever is reading this sad excuse for a web page which didnt take any HTML skill whatsoever because it's all pre-made. and im too lazy to make it better coz i know i can, but im too lazy so that "redesign" thing is going to have to wait. =D  anyway. yes. tomoro is a better day. just like that out of eden song. LOL today i am hung up on finding songs to relate to my life. i do that a lot actually. anyways. i am hapy now. and i am going to practice flute for a bit now. end my wonderful msn convos and go upstairs practice flute for about 20 mintues and then watch tv until my eyeballs fall out. good night all =D

       what a day. i was pissed in the morning, then the afternoon went pretty cool, i would even say that it was almost splendid. then when i was on the bus going home i was sad again. *sighz* let me put it in more understandable terms: in the words of evanescence, "...fifty-thousand tears ive cried..." except in my case its probly more than 50,000. seems that ive turned into a wimp. i cry myself to sleep most nights because my life is pointlessly stupid and yeah. (mya song: "tears on my pillow", my pillow is soaked through). im under a lot of stress. im emotionally unstable, who knwos what i'll do next (mostly likely is cry, but who knows) and im also suffering from a broken heart. WHY does life have to be so complicated? i never knew my emotions would get the better of me, but lately, they've stolen my brain or something. emotional. thats what i am, an emo-freak, emo-wreck, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. sometimes im mad, sometimes im happy, most times im sad. *sighz* so what is this thing called life anyways? i dont get it. please, if you have the answer, i would like to know. because as of now my life has no purpose or point. what i need is a friend, a confidant, a ooh ooh i know what i want, a CHUM. thats what i need, a golly good jolly fun chum. where can i find me one of them? someone to have fun with, talk to, they'll listen, care about me. well i can think of someone, but im scared that i'll do sum'n that might make him frustrated or something. i wish i could have that friendly relationship that i wanta have with him, but i feel as though theres something there, maybe another girl? well. as the world turns, so do the gears in my mind, unfortunately the world turning has somewhere to go, my brain just goes on into oblivion...................

       okie. i took more of mush's quizzes from her page.. heres the results   You are a Seductive lover. The only thing you like to get out of romances are the passionate kisses and make-out sessions. Well, at least the perverted wretches like you.  Not that I don't like you, that is. No offense meant! You are seductive, attractive, and playful.    urlLink What Kind of Romantic Are You? (for girls)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     You are the Piano. You sophisticated devil, you. You are a proud bird, a classy chick, a debonare... well, you ge the idea. Most of the people you socialize with are just mere aquantances, you have very few true friends. The ones you do have are close, though, and they know that underneath your hard, glossy exterior, you are just a delicate instrument.    urlLink Which Musical Instrument Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Ah, you have a very...unique interest in guys. Often going for the bad-guy in movies, who are good-guys in life. Aw, what a sweetheart you must be. You have the perfect boyfriend(or maybe you HAD him) and would do anything for him. You believe in the saying: love is a many splendid thing! Love is like oxygen! Love lifts us up where we belong! Keep up that attitude, girl, and cherish every moment of love. Because you never know what could happen, and with a guy like you've got, you should never take chances. Live life and have fun! Your world doesn't revolve around him, but you're still crazy in love. Just keep that balance and whatever you do DON'T lose your friendship w/that guy. He's a sweetie and a lifesaver.

       last night i was so tired that i was watching tv and fell asleep on the couch. then i woke up 15 minutes later and went upstiars and fell asleep on my parents bed and then dad was like go to bed and then so i just sorta fell onto my bed wearing all my clothes and everything. later, when mom got home at like 1:00 she woke me up and i was like huh? coz the minute i hit the bed i was out. i woke up this morning at like 9:30 but it was actually 10:30 coz of the time change. i woke up and then went on the computer and tried to do some research [?] for my bio paper on "radical environmentalism" i didnt get very far for one of two reasons: 1. the computer was going very slow, 2. i was downloading/listening to music at the same time. after a few hours of slow going on the computer, i was talking to frances and we were both boreded so we decided to go out for a bit of a walk and meet each other halfway. so. for the next two hours, me, fran, and than (aka jonathan) went for a "walk". we went to mohawk and got slurpees, and then we went and sat out front of mcdonalds and just sat there. soon jonathan got big extras coz he was hungry and me and frances had some too. we sat there for like an hour or sum'n and then we went inside mcdonalds and jonathan was gonna get fries but he didnt. finally i went home and they walked me partway home. then i came home ate dinner and struggled with the computer until i decided to restart it. now i am here. mom french braided my hair and im going to take it out in the morning and have nice hair. im considering getting a perm, not like spiral curls or anything but a nice wavey look or sum'n. today was pointless. fun but pointless. if i think about it, i didnt get anything accomplished except i downloaded like 40 songs. lol. yeah. now its on to reading more of that drivel on various internet websites about "animal activists gone bad" blehhhhh

       today was a very interesting day. it started off uneventfully like usual with the normal bus ride to school. we got to school and went to our lockers and sharayah came and told us that there was no water in the school because as an april fools joke someone had dug this huge hole out on the field and was planning to dump mr. honeys (our principal) car in the hole. unfortunately, while they were digging they hit the water line and as a result there was no water. interesting. it gets worse. apparently the cops were there and are going to investigate it. however, the teachers said that until whoever did it confesses there will be no extracurricular activities. *sighz* i hope they dont cancel band tour or anything like that. i could care less if they cancelled the banquet because i highly doubt i'll be going to that. yay. this time around the girls are supposed to ask the guys LOL. yeah right. im so going. not. anyways. we stayed at school till about 9:45 and then they sent us home. it was great. me, frances, jonathan, terry, renan, and japhet all went to the mall. we ate mcdonalds and then renan and japhet left. me and jonathan and frances and terry walked to some park but jonathan and terry were like playing on the playground and me and frances didnt know that they werent coming and we just walked home. it was a long walk. very tiring. it was fun though. *sighz* im tired. and i have piano lessons tonight. AHAHAHAHA tomoros class challenge i dont know if im going though because our class seems quite unprepared. we'll see. i'll have to ask first if i can stay home, and i highly doubt that my parents will let me stay home. oh well. i guess i'll have to go. yay. well, time to practice before i go to piano. double yay!!

[10 hours later LOL i suck]. anyways, after that i got sidetracked and then dad ordered some pizza. he wen to pick it up. finally, the parents left to go downtown or vancouver or wait yeah robson street to eat at some chinese restaurant with tonz of ppl for george weir's 60 bday. yup. while they were gone, i practically ate a whole pizza and i finished watching Lord of the Rings: the fellowship of the ring. it was pretty good. interesitng. i hated how it ended coz now i have to watch more and i cant watch it for a few days coz im busy. speaking of busy, tomoro i have to harshly practice the piano for like 4 hours to perfect those 2 songs coz on tuesday im performing it. shiet. im in doodoo. anyways. after watchign the movie, i gave zack his piano lesson, and then i did basically nothing. i was doing my bio hw, but that never really got accomplished yet.... and what else.... i listend to more music. and now im on the net again. like usual. wasting my time. writign nonsense in here. yep. i have no life. i shall end this now. bye.

       hey hey.. today was good, then it started sucking.. then i gave a grand performance.. let me tell you how it went. well i already told you how the first part of my day went.. it was aritey. oh yeah. i cleaned my room. yay for that. then i ate lovely leftovers for dinner. that was great too. then after that, i wiated around until sunset. after sunset, ra-ool called me like he said he would, but unfortunately, i couldnt pursuade my parents to let me go out. dangit! anyways, i was/am pretty pissed with my parents because the one time i getta go out and they dont let me. ARGH! ACK! DAMN! anyhoo, after talking to ra-ool on the phone, i basically gave my parents a lecture for 45 minutes. i made some good points like i usually do in those situations. however, i think its gonna take more than talking to them to get the point across to them that i wanta have a stupid life. for crying out loud, i have only one year left to have a  life. after i graduate its hardcore university and after that its working my ass off from 9-5 every day earning a frickin living. they dont get it. oh well. sorry that i couldnt come out ra-ool n all. i wish i could.... my parents said that you guys sould come over so they can "get to know yoU" then maybe after that, we can chill. however, i said that "what would we do at my house??" mehh you guys shoudl come over then we'll rent movies n get pizza or sum crap like that. then after they've known y'all we'll do sum'n more else. anyhoo.... my plans for the rest of this lovely rainy evening are to once im finished on the computer, go upstairs to my room, set up the VCR, get some food and then watch Lord of the rings 1 n 2........ that'll keep me busy for a while =D anywaiz, i think im gonna do that soon... sum fun....... yay. laterz...............

       surprisingly enough, i wasnt too overly tired today. just a couple times when i felt like falling asleep and once when i did. i went with my dad to drop sum'n off at the mall or sum'n and i stayed in the van and i fell asleep. i drooled too. yay, eh?! so. what did i do today? i had a jam-packed fun-filled day. was quite tired when i woke up, but i managed to get out of bed. went to school and right when we got there, we turned around and drove to deer lake school coz our senior band had a performance there. we performed decently. better than expected, however the songs that were sposed to be perfected sounded a bit messed in places and well the less great songs sounded pretty good. so, overall we were pretty good. after that, we drove back to school and arrived back in time for lunch. after lunch we had bio, which was uneventful. after biology, tiffany told me that mr. hosking said that today was the day he was available to take us to dairy queen. so me, tiffany, and frances got permission from mr. johnson [socials teacher; yay we gotta miss socials!!] to go and us along with mr. hosking and his chemistry 12 class [which consists of one person named kevin roberts] piled into mr. hoskings car and drove off to DQ. i ordered a banana split.... the equivlent to three small sundaes coz it has 3 scoops, no piles, of ice cream. plus a banana. so yeah i had three small sundaes and a banana. after that, we drove back to school just in time for the last five minutes of the day, which me and frances spent cleaning out the trash in mr. hoskings car.... we found some incriminating evidence in there... but i'll keep that to myself.... =P after a comfortable bus ride spent sitting on the floor in the aisle, i arrived home and watched my favourite old movie from the sixties: "To Sir With Love". i luv that movie. its awesome. then i ate dinner which consisted of mashed potatoes, roast, and brocolli ... soooo yummay!! then i went with dad to the mall and then to the library, came home, read an archie comic on my bed for a bit, took a soak in the tub, and then got my hair french braided for tomoroz hairstyle =D soon, after im doing chatting to these cool ppl on msn, im going to go upstairs to my room and i MAY or may NOT clean my room. if im tired i wont i'll just sit there but if im not too tired i'll attempt to clean it. it's in a HORRIBLE mess like you wouldnt and couldnt imagine. yeah. ok   "you give me butterflyz"

       IM BACK from backpacking!!! it was so much fun =D  FRIDAY: we had to stay at the school and leave late because two of the sponsors couldnt leave until around 6. so school ended at like 2:00 and we had to stay at school for like 5 hours until we left because we left late around 7:00 or 7:30. anyways. we hung around school for a long while and packed ou backpacks, went to subway and ate subs, and just chilled. gabe and aaron lit a fire on the school steps with kerosene or gasoline or sum'n and they couldnt come on the trip. anywyas, eventually we left. and it was pouring rain all day friday too. we drove for like 3 hours in the pouring rain and into the night. unfortunately, we had to cross this ferry to get to the camping place, but the ferry had closed about 20 minutes before we had gotten there and so we had to find somewhere else to camp that night. after driving around for a long time we finally decided that there was nowhere to camp so we had to camp on the side of the road. at like 11:30 at night we were setting up camp on the side of the road in the pouring rain. and of couse me and frances had the bright idea to share one sleeping bag because it would be less weight for us to pack in, so we slept in one sleeping bag on top of this air mattress thing i brought. unfortunately, during the night the lil pin that holds the air in popped out and our mat deflated. on top of that, since it was raining, the underneath of the tent was letting water in and the sleeping bag was getting wet. so we had to figure out how to sleep so that we were warm and the sleeping bag didnt get wet. finally we wrapped the sleeping bag around ourselves and sleeping head to toe of each other fell asleep.  SATURDAY: woke up around 6:30 to COLD air but fortunately, no rain and just a bunch of clouds and the sun was going to come up over the mountains soon. we ate breakfast on the side of the road. as we cooked and took down our camp, ppl that were driving by were staring at us. it was pretty funny. and of course, since we were camping not on a campground, there were no bathrooms, that is except the bushes. what an experience. anyways, finally we crossed the ferry, drov efor like 10 minutes and got to our destination. now it was time to backpack. me with my 30+ pound backpack were going up and down the trails. the trail was pretty much flat wiht the occasional slight up or down. we stopped for lunch after about 2 hours and ended up waiting there for 2 hours because mr. hosking had to run back to the car for some first aid supplies because lizzy had blisters or sum'n. anywyas, we cooked our lunch because we had tonz of time and we were actually at someone elses camp site and they had a fire and they said we coudl use their fire while they went hiking. so ppl roasted hot dogs and ate food and everyone had a good relaxation time until mr. hosking came back. finally we all hit the trail again. unfortunately for me, i was really lazy and tired after our 2 hour rest and i just could not hike any further. especially because the next stretch of the trail was practically straight UPHILL and it sucked. i was so pooped i just made up my mind that i could not go on and just basically sprawled out on the foot-wide trail and said no i cannot do it. finally i got up and with much huffing and puffing made my way [slowly] up the trail. eventually we got to the top of the hilly part and i was like yay, but unfortunately for me, things just got worse. first i discovered that i have a phobia. my phobia kicks in when a rocky cliff-type dropoff is present and down hundreds of feet below is the vicious river roaring by. we had to cross 2 ridges like this and i was freaked ou the whole time. i was practically hyperventilating and almost started crying at one point coz i was so scared. after a reallky long tiem coz i was so slow, we finally made it down the mountainous part and continued our approx 1 hour hike on relatively level ground into the campsite. finally we got to the campsite and set up camp. for dinner we had a feast. renan had brought some corned beef in a can and some of those sidekicks rice stuff thats like flavoured with like cheese n brocolli or sum'n and we cooked up packages of noodles and had tonz of lovely food to eat. after that, we joined everyone else in the circle and had a lil worship thought which consisted of finding something around the campsite and then describing to everyone how it described us fully. and then after that, mr. hosking and mr. okimi "wowed" us all with their "mind-reading" skills. one of them would leave the vicinity of our circle and then we woudl choose someone and then the other person woucl eome back and read the mind and find out who it was. me and frances figured out how they did it and then there were more mind-reading games and other things like that. eventually everyone went to bed and me frances renan jonathan and japhet were standing around talking and mr. hosking came and told us to go to sleep. however, frances was like OMG we cant sleep in the one sleeping bag coz last night it was screwed up but i thought it woudl be fine coz tonight it wasnt raining. i still think that we coulda done perfectly fine in the one sleeping bag, but mehh. finally after much prodding on our part, they gave us mr. okimi's sleeping bag and we spread out frances sleeping bag on the bottom and put mr. okimi's on top. then we went to sleep. during the night i woke up a few times. the first time i coulndt move my legs, and teh second time i coulndt move my shoulders.  SUNDAY: woke up late, around 11:30. most of everyone else had gone hiking and it was just me, frances, jonathan, renan, japhet, mr. hosking, brandi, and danielle left in the camp. i wasnt feeling well, i think mostly because i was dreading going back coz i was scared of that one area, and i had a headache.... anyways, we ate a lovely breakfast of instant oatmeal and noodle soup. yay. finally, mr. hosking made us take down our tent and we prepared for the hike back. my pack was light coz i had drank most of my water and didnt refeill it, and also i drank all my gatorade and gave japhet my shoes. yep my pack was light. i had no trouble packing it back. a lil while into the hike, i took the propane tank from frances because she was complaining her pack was too heavy. anyways, the hike back went perfectly fine. i wanst scared through the supposed "scary" part. it was fine. the group that i hiked with arrived back at the cars last coz we kept stopping and yeah. oh well. it was good. after an almost 3 hour drive back, we arrived back at school. the drive back [which was me, frances, and mr. okimi] consisted of games such as naming fruits and vegetables using the last letter of the previously named one, and also other topics such as celebrities/famous people and yeah things like that. we also listened to mr. okimi's lovely music which included songs from shaggy - angel, to gloria gaynore - i will survive, to sir mix-a-lot - i like big butts. yep it was interesting. finally, back at school, everyone wiated for their parents to pick them up. we had to give daniel, frances, jonathan, and japhet a ride. my mom drove over jonathans backpack by accident because he left it underneat the wheel and she backed up and yeah kinda screwed up his discman =S lol. oh well. his fault i think. anyways, after dropping japhet off at the skytrain, we went home. and i went to the movie store to rent some movies. i rented james bond: on her majesty's secret service.. [i didnt like the ending!!], to sir with love, and we found "in the heat of the night" and bought it. yay. i took a lovely shower, ate some lovely sidekicks pasta, and watched my movie and went to sleep at like 1:30  today i woke up at 12:34 [weird] and then i went on the computer. i was still slightly sore from my backpacking trip, but mehh. around 2:00 i went out with mom, mrs. soong, shan, and mr. soong to shoe company in coquitlam and this 99 cents store which is the funniest thing in the world. they sell nothing over 99 cents. they even had a computer game for 99 cents. =S and weird "welfare" type food. interesting. nasty. i came home, and then i did nothing just did.. well nothing. and then i wen to the movies with shan around 7:00 and we watched "13 going on 30" and then ate some food an then sneaked into "shrek 2" yep. and theni got home around 11:30. yep. now i have to do my bio project and then study for chem test tomoro. yay. im sorta getting tired =S anyhoo, the movies were good. "IT'S A THONG" [shrek 2] that movie is hilarious. and 13 going on 30 was really good too. yep. well now i think i shoudl post this sucker and then do my hw. yay.

       back from tour. IT WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much fun!!!!! let me tell you how it went:  FRIDAY: left school at 1:30 and drove for about an hour to catch the ferry at tsawassen to go to nanaimo. during the busride all we did was listen to music and other normal stuff like that. i sat with matthew for all the busrides of the trip--rather, he sat by me. anyways. when we got to the ferry place we had to wait for like 30-45 minutes before we coudl board the ferry and i fell asleep coz i had a horrendous headache. anyways, the ferry ride was hilarious. me and frances and ren and matthew and alex and jonathan all sat near each other and we were telling LAME jokes such as "why did the monkey fall out of the tree? BECAUSE IT WAS DEAD" and frances started making up jokes such as "why did the bird lay an egg? BECAUSE IT WANTED A BABY!!" and she'd go hysterical. finally we arrived at nanaimo and then we drove for about 30-45 minutes until we got to nanaimo church where we ate dinner and then went home with our billets. our billet had a son with down syndrome that was about 9 years old or somewhere around there. he was HILARIOUS. he was really excited that we were going to be sleepin at his house and he was like "mom, can i sleep with the girls tonight? i like girls!" and then he was like showing us all his stuff in his house and he was looking through our stuff and saying the most hilarious things which i dont think i shoudl really get into detail. anyways, when he had to go to bed he was like "goodnight sweeties!" it was pretty funny.  SATURDAY: woke up around 8:00 and got ready and wen to church for our lovely performance, which according to Mr. hosking received an 8.5/10 so that means that it was pretty good. after eating we drove down to victoria. that took anywhere from 1-2.5 hours. everyone had to go to the washroom so we stopped at the empress hotel to use the public washroom there. OMG inside the empress hotel, well the part that i saw, its soooo nice in there. i got inspired by the lounge type pianist thatwas playin in the lil restaurant that was serving 4:00 tea. anyways, when we got to the beach, the weather on saturday had already been sun with clouds and we went to the beach so it was really windy. we stayed there for the longest time. it was alright coz we walked along the beach and found this really long kelp thing that must've been at least 20 feet long and i dragged it from where i found it for about a kilometre back to the bus. it was hilarious coz it was stuck in the sand with all this seaweed and when i was dragging it and pulling it out it got even longer and then it dragged this whole pile of seaweed with it and even a big branch thing too. anyways. after that we had to had dinner which was pre-ordered taco time which was pretty good.. and then we sat around or stood around for like an hour in the blistering cold coz it was freakin windy and finally they had worship and it was off to the motel. we stayed in a place called "blue ridge inns" it wasnt too bad. pretty good. when we were there a bunch of ppl went swimming, me, frances, ren, matthew, tiff, brittney, jon, and alex and mr. hosking went to tim hortons and a couple of them bought ice caps. then me and brittney bought a large popcorn chicken and shared it between the two of us.  while everyone was hanging around me and brittney were sooo bored so we got the brilliant idea to fill our bathtub with icecubes! so we got a small layer on the bottom of the tub and then it was melting pretty quickly coz our room was sooo hot. so we decided that we were gonna put sum water in the tub and make ice tea in the bathtub. that didnt work well coz tea only works in hot water so we made some tea in the sink and then made more tea in the bathtub. we used about 6 or 7 tea bags and then one burst so we started ripping them all open until the water was filled with black specks and then we started putting pepper and coffee whitener in it. it was hilarious. then we put shampoo in the toilet in hopes that when someone flushed it it would foam everywhere. it didnt work. anyways. when everyone had to go to bed, it was like 11:00 and we were just sitting around talking on the phone to the guys in the other room. frances eventually fell asleep and then brittney was talkin to jon on the phone for forever and me n tiff were bored so we put on my discman and started belting out the lyrics to cher, michael jackson, and tonz of other oldies songs and aqua. brittney was laughing at us. soon she was done on the phone and we were so hyper coz brittney made a pot of coffee and drank the whole thing and i brough chocolate covered espresso beans which we finished and i had had like 3 chocolate bars and a can of pop and like all this other candy. me and brittney and tiff were gonna make a dance routine to a song. then the phone rang and tiff was on the phone forever with alex so me and brittney got even more hyper by eating more candy [fuzzy peaches] and we both ate two packets of sugar that was provided. well, i ate mine both, but the first time we were looking at each other and brittney started laughing and spit sugar all over the place. the second time we decided not to look so we wouldnt laugh and then we turned and looked at each other and she spat her sugar all over the place and it went in the path of the fan and went all over my face. it was hilarious. anyways. after that we were SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO hyper. our room was so hot from our moving around so much that the window was just dripping like a waterfall with condensation. anyways we still wanted to make our dance routine so in order to get ideas we decided to put the tv on MUCH MUSIC and copy all the dance moves of the ppl in the music videos and our dancing was hilarious and we were so hyper that every 2 seconds we'd be fallin on the floor laughign soooooo hard. it was hilarious. and tiff was just lookin at us like we were morons. finally it became 4:00 in the morning and we were still hyper as hell and frances and tiff couldnt sleep coz me n brittney were soooo loud and hyper jumpin around and laughin so hard. finally we decided to settle down but we were wide awake and just sittin on the beds in the dark. finally around 5:15 we fell asleep and woke up about 2.5 hours later.  SUNDAY: woke up around 8. finally got up around 8:30. left the inn around 9:30. drove to craigdarroch castle. me and brittney were WIDE awake considering our 2.5-ish hours of sleep. i had a slight headache, but other than that i was pumped. sorta hungover from our caffeine/sugar hight, but it was ok. after craigdarroch castle, which was pretty cool, we went to inner harbour victoria, which is like downtown vancouver except not as busy and we were given 3 hours to walk around and do whatever we wanted just meet back at the bus in time to leave so that we could catch our ferry back. me, fran, ren, and matt walked around, went to the mall, ate in the food court [a&w and orange julius] and then we tried on dresses [only me and frances] then we went to this gift shop where i bought some Kahlua filled chocolates and some champagne filled chocolates which were absolutely delicious.. the kahlua ones were soooo awesome... i ate them all except theres one kahlua one left. anywyas. after the gift shop, we used the washroom in the empress hotel.... again.. and then boarded the bus for the almost hour long ride to the ferry place. when we got there we had to wait coz we were early for the ferry we had to wait about 45 minutes. then we boarded, and it was so crowded that we sat on the floor for a bit and then went upstairs and walked around outside and then went inside and ate white spot burgers. anyways. after the ferry, we drove the hour-ish long trip back to the school where we got picked up and then frances's mom dropped me off at home. now i am home sweet home.  its good to be home. tour was so awesomely fun. i'll remember it forever. i only got one picture though... with CODY.. the down syndrome kid. he wanted to take a picture with us girls. hehehe. anyways. now i am home. i am tired. i bought mom a spoon from victoria for a souvenir and i just gave it to her. i am tired. tired tired tired. i have homework. homework home work homework. chemistry. yay yay yay yay. must do now. this is a long blog. probly boring to with all my rambling on and on and on and on and on and on and on... oh well..........

       i took a quiz for "whats my gift of gab" and this is my results:      Laying On The Laughter  Laughter really is the best medicine. For a friendly and funny soul like you, nothing opens up communication lines and lowers people's defenses like a hearty chuckle, sidesplitting guffaw, or shared snicker. Whether you're trying to defuse tense situations or liven up dull ones, humor always seems to lighten the mood and get people talking.  Whether your wit is revealed through goofy jokes, dark humor, edgy sarcasm, or sophisticated satire, your true gifts are showcased when you're making wisecracks. So bring on the slapstick, the irony, and the jests â€” eventually we'll all be laughing with you.  hmmm. well thats interesting. i like to laugh. mary poppins. that song. lol. anyways! band fest concert was today. it wen pretty good, but coulda been better. mehh. at least its done. tomoro is mom's day. hehehehe i bought mommy a josh groban cd that she wanted =D and today was my mom and dads 21st anniv. shweet!! well, im having rather heated convos on the net so i shall go now. toodlez

       well. today was interesting. band fest started today and a bunch of other schools were there. in the end, i think the senior band will have around 75 people in it. pretty cool! so. we rehearsed today and we're gonna rehearse some more tomoro. i drank my energy drink today [rockstar energy drink!]. it didnt do a thing. my heart beat was normal, and i didnt feel energized, i was just my normal self. but then again, for me caffeinated drinks and the lot usually kick in at weird times. like the other night i drank a double-shot espresso drink thing to stay awake, and i swear it didnt do anything except the next day i was like super hyper. so maybe in a few hours i'll be like super super energized. we'll see. hmmm. today was so nice outside. we lay around on the grass during lunch time and just sat there. it was so nice. and warm. yep. i just finished doing my bio homework. it took forever coz i had to write out like 100+ vocab words. mr. hosking said if we do that then we'll get an extra 5 points bonus on this next test. and he said the test will most likely be out of something around 50 points so its like a bonus 10% on the test. yay!! a way to improve my biology grade. anyways, i have piano lessons tonight, and i havent practiced all week [typical]. i should get in the routine of pracgticing like 2 or 3 hours a day. that is if i wanta be like a professional pianist.. .ike my career or whatever. oh well. i think i needa do some socials homework though. more laterz.. =D

YESSSSSS go aqua. good timez. hmmmm maybe i should describe ACQUIRE THe FIRE now  friday: were sposed to leave at like 9:00 or 10:00 in the morning, but ended up leaving at like 1:30 coz of various delays. shan had to go to school for a test, mr. soong had to go to work to finish sum'n up, and mrs. soong couldnt find her pasport. we finally left and then stopped over in burger king in aldergrove before crossing the border. we ddrove for like 4 hours straight with a few stops because of daniels car troubles. me and shan had to go to the washroom soooooooo bad coz yeah we were holding it for the entire 4 hours of the ride and in order to keep our minds off our bladders we were like OK. we're gonna learn a song. so we put the discman on repeat on a song called "tarzan and jane" or sum'n like that by AQUA and sang it like 30 times. we must've been so annoying. anyways. we finally got to the tacoma dome [and were able to relieve ourselves.....] and we went for the first lil meeting thing. it was really good. the praise band was alrite.. they had harsh "rocker" voices, but it was alright. the songs ended up lasting like 10 minutes each though. oh yea. grits [the christian rap group] performed a mini concert. they are good, but the volume and especially the bass was too high so you couldnt understand what they were saying sometimes. it was interesting. anyways, after a rather entertaining [not being sarcastic] meeting, we left the tacoma dome, and drove to auntie ritchies house. we got lost or sum'n and then finally got to her house at like 11:30 or sum'n like that. we went to the church to eat dinner, then came back to her house and like 10 of us slept there while a few of the guys slept in the church. the people that came on this trip was the soong family, vanessa, kayel, me, terry, james, malcolm, kaarla, and jay. i rode with shan, and daniel, and vanessa in daniels car. we wen to sleep at like 2:30 or sum'n coz everyone was taking showers and there was only like 1 shower for the 15 of us. well there was 2, but no one wanted to use the upstairs one for various reasons. too much to explain. nutt'n big.  saturday: meeting started at like 8:30, but we all woke up late and ended up arriving at the tacoma dome at like 11:30. anyways, i woke up early and no one else was up. i woke up at like 7:00 and took my sweet time taking a shower and getting dressed etc. it was great. we then ate breakfast, and after a long time, all drove off to the tacoma dome. the speaker on saturday morning was REALLY good. i wish we hadn't come so late, coz he was really on fire, and yeah. after that meeting i saw renan and japhet and then we went and ate sandwiches for lunch, and then went back inside for another meeting after the lil sermon/talk thing, there was a rock concert. the rock bands that were there included trace, kutless, sum'n like to do with the number seven and the word sunday, and some other bands but i cant remember the names. and then after that, we ate dinner and then me, kayel, shan, and malc walked up to meet the fvaa ppl. we chilled with them for a bit and then went back for another meeting. by this time i was soooooooo tired that i fell asleep on the more slow parts of the "sermon" thing. anywyas, after that we left and went back to auntie ritchies house. on the way there we stopped at safeway and i bought an energy drink. i took a shower coz i didnt wanta take one in the morning coz i woudl have to wait forever and stuff likethat. then at like 11:30 we went to the church to eat again. after that, we came back and i was so wide awake coz of the energy drink. so we watched some tv and then i went to sleep at like 2:30.  sunday: woke up around 8:30 or somethign. not sure. everyone was tired and took forever getting dressed etc. finally aroudn 11:30 we ate breakfast/lunch [aka brunch i guess, lol] and then we packed up and drove off to the mall where i found fabulous deals and bought two pairs of shoes for $6 each and a pair of pants that was $20 but it was 60% off so it only cost me $8. after that we said good bye to auntie ritchie and started the long drive home. we arrived back at the soongs house at like 10:15 or so. i finally got home at like 10:45.  yepp. a really good weekend. the speakers at ACQUIRE THE FIRE were really good, the music wasnt bad... and yeah it was fun shopping and stuff. so yeah. thats my weekend. now i have to go do a bit of socials homework/studying and then its time to watch simpsons and king of the hill at 10:00 =D [i have no life!]

       this is so wrong. i am not a natural leader.. =S hehehe        Prince William   People already look to you for friendship and advice (of course, you're a natural leader). So just imagine how they'll flock when they know you've been matched with Prince William himself!   Though his official title is "His Royal Highness Prince William of Wales," he'd prefer it if you just called him "Wills." That's right, the hottie, heir apparent to the throne is your teen celebrity match. He's sexy (at 6'2"), single (just starting college), and smart (straight A's).   This royal bachelor would be more likely to take you to a hidden pub to raise a few pintsâ€”strictly a jeans-and-sweater affair, mind you, than take you on a tour of the Castle. You're sure to notice a down-to-earth wisdom beyond his years as this born leader has grown up in the public eye. And even if he didn't have that sexy English accent, how could you resist him as he looks into your eyes and tells you how dedicated he is to helping the environment, or you.   So if you want a nice intimate evening, just you, Wills, and a couple bodyguards (and the royal jet if you're lucky), this great Briton is all yours. After all those times people have called you "Princess" wouldn't it be nice if you could play the part for real and make the world a better place?

       this quiz is so true!! i luv a good laugh =D       Sticking-Tongue-Out Face   What's so funny? You are! That's why the emoticon that represents you best is as good-humored as you. No matter if knock-knock jokes, sarcasm, or slapstick get you going, it's clear that you've got more than a couple funny bones in your body.  Getting a laugh out of people isn't always easy, but it seems second nature to you. You're not one to take life too seriously, and you know firsthand that laughter really is the best medicine. It's no wonder people know to look no further than you when they want to have a laugh. Late-night TV had better look out. A hilarious new comic could be on the rise!     guess what?? im not even started my ppt presentation project thing. i am screwed. its 11:00. yup. i am so screwed.

       today was whacked up. but in all its "whacked-up-ness" i finally got some sense knocked into me. we went up to camp meeting today. i actually listened to the speaker today. he was actually really good. i got something outta the message, donno what, but i felt it. however, despite the speaker's "good-ness", i still have to say that i wasnt really feeling the music. the band had like 2 violins and a cello... i mean who can feel a praise band that has 2 violins and a cello? and if thats not enough, the fact that their harmonies sometimes sounded a bit off. they kinda made praise songs like "trading my sorrows" and "draw me close" sound a bit "hick-ish". yep. anyways, after the morning "service", we had lunch at the lintan's campsite again. a blast as usual. lol. i was so tired again. and then me, terry, james, ra-ool, and davis went to the lake. me, ra-ool and james didnt get in the water though. i was taling to ra-ool, and james was talking to some of his friends. oh well. i wasnt really planning on getting in the water. instead of staying up there and catching a ride home with ra-ool late at night, i decided that i was too tired and went home with my mom n everyone. im so wiped out right now. i need a good dose of piano playing. i might work on that chopin song later. yup. i think im gonna go and rent "the bourne identity" so that i can watch "the bourne supremacy" soon. coz yeah the previews look cool. so yeah. i shall leave.   it hit me today. ive been doing a buncha stupid things lately. and i realized that. i needa stop, and i am 100% willing to do so, and 100% am going to stop. first off, screw the blog i wrote about fricken lines. who cares. its the past. i will not follow through with that. also, i am not going to abuse alcohol. i think that casual drinking like once in a blue moon is ok as long as its in like small amounts, but no more abuse of that shit. i been thinking a lot lately. and yeah, there is a lot to look forward to in life. and im really feeling all ehh for all the crap ive done in my life. none of it paid off. none of it was worth it. i just wanta start over. yeah. today at camp meeting, something made me start thinking and i just wanta like be all "Godly" again. like not a freak or nutt'n, but not a rebel. its bad. i needa ask for forgiveness. i needa become a new person. i needa put my past behind me and become optimistic again. however, that doesnt mean im not gonna dye my hair black =D i cant wait to do that!!

DROWN. i'll drown in my shit-filled life. it's already pulling me under. i sometimes just wish i could DIE. leave everything behind me. why cant that happen? i already know how i want to die. its the perfect death. painless, and beautiful. death. the word in itself sounds so, serene. it is as calm as a quiet winter's day. the kind of winter's day that has dark gray clouds overhead, and endless snow-covered fields for miles and miles. life. what is life? does it have a point? will it ever stop hating me? what do you do when you feel like you cant go on like this? sure i know there are people out there who have it way worse off than me. but still. this is shit for me. argh. when will it end? this endless hellhole that keeps pulling me down. the darkness envelopes me. becoming one with the darkness is what i want most. being alive is not on my list of priorities--  --then again, there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, and the sun will shine again [am i gay? or rather, a lesbo? or maybe im bi. who knows. haha, jk]  like john cusack said when he acted as eddie thomas in the movie america's sweethearts: "i'm a paranoid schizophrenic, so i am an entourage." i think thats the kinda problem i have. i need help. lol.

       my dad decided to take us out tonight since he's leaving to go back to nevada tomoro. we went out for greek food, it was delish. after that we went 5-pin bowlingn. my score was 133. what a winner am i. before that outing today, i cleaned my room, listened/sang along to my music, and folded laundry while watching Mona Lisa Smile. hehe it was pretty good. but whatever. its hot right now and i have nothing else to say.   what is going on in my mind right now? i am confused as ever, yet, not confused at all. do i have what i want NOW? am i happy? i dont think i'll ever be completely happy. just because, there will always be someone negatively affected by something i do. you're probly thinking "okay. here she goes again" mehh. life goes on, yet i'll never let go of the fact that i cannot please everyone. oh well. the heart works in mysterious ways. in my case, it cannot be helped. i have issues. MAJOR issues. i think i need help. like brain help. or just help in general. whatever. oh yeah, remember that "route i took as an out" a little while back? turns out that route was only a short detour. now im back on track. and thats all i have to say...     There are times I swear I know you're here When I forget about my fears Feeling you my dear Watching over me, and my hope sees What the future will bring, When you wrap me in your wings  And take me where you are  Where you and I will be together Once again, we'll be dancing in the moonlight just like we used to do And you'll be smiling back at me Only then will I be free, when I can be Where you are  And I can see your face  Your kiss I still can taste  My memory awaits  Ohh, I see your star,shining down on me  And I'd do anything if I can just  Be right there where you are  Where you and I will be together Once again, we'll be dancing in the moonlight just like we used to do And you'll be smiling back at me Only then will I be free, when I can be Where you are  And baby there are times when selfishly  I'm wishing that you were here with me So I can wipe the tears from your eyes and make you see That every night while you are dreaming I'm here to guard you from afar And anytime I feel alone I close my eyes and dream of where you are  Where you and I will be together Once again, we'll be dancing in the moonlight just like we used to do And you'll be smiling back at me Only then will I be free, when I can be Where you are  Baby, I still believe, Oh, I've got to believe I'll touch you that sweet day That you take me there where you are   jessica simpson & nick lachey - "where you are"

       okie. went up to camp meeting yesterday, but i wasnt really feelin it.. so half the time i was outta it. sleeping, pissed off, or well, lets just say "off-center". did someshin bad. hehehe. oh well. we got to camp around 9:30, and headed off to our places. the youth hill, well it was cool, but then again, i just talked to kevin the whole time. he's cool. after that, lunch in the sweltering heat. it was so freckin hot. i tried to find ra-ool n jorge but they had mysteriously disappeared. so unfortunately for them, they missed lunch. oh well. i didnt eat much yesterday. i just sorta fell asleep in the van coz i was soooooo tired and it was sooooo hot. yup. after that, we miraculously found jorge n ra-ool, and then us along with davis went up to the waterfalls. it was quite funny. we started off by dipping our feet in, and that eventually turned into splashing each other which turned into davis n jorge throwing me in the freezing-cold-most-likely-glacier water. yup. oh, and did i mention my shirt was WHITE?!?! oh, and my make-up was EVERYWHERE too, so i made them wash it all off hehehe. well, after awhile i was like, to heck with it. and me n jorge started dunking our heads in the water and lying down on our backs n stomachs in the water. it was COLD!! anyways, i made jorge n davis pay. our attire for "hiking" back was me: jorge's shirt, davis's shirt. davis: shirtless. jorge: my shirt. goodness, he looked so LOVELY [aka. gay]. hahahaha. it was hilarious. ra-ool didnt really get wet though.. hehehe. on the way back from the waterfalls, i was "fast walking" and somehow i managed to [mildly] sprain my ankle. it hurted. so, ra-ool gave me a piggyback ride almost all the way back. [shpanxx ra-ool, when we gonna get our shirts made?!?!] anyways, after waterfalls, i re-applied my make-up, under ra-ools careful watch [obviously so he could learn how to do it himself.. hehehe] and then i played with and styled ra-ool's and jorge's hair. hehehe. it was fun. after that, chilled a while, and then went up the youth hill for another wholesome message, which i didnt listen to either. just chilled outside with frances, sharayah, ren, jon, terry, shan, jorge ra-ool, davis, and james!! whoa man, james was HYPER!! hilarious!! after that, went to the store and got a new CD and book. yay!! then we went home. wish i coulda stayed at camp =( all my friends.. etc.. oh well. whatever. anyways, today, i think im gonna get some shtufferz accomplished. GRRR. "rachelle, is that all you're gonna do today?" geez. get off my freckin case! its my damn SUMMER!!!! sheesh. for crying out loud................. WHATEVER. IM AN ASS. I HATE LIFE. IT SUCKS. WHY DO I SCREW UP EVERYTHING?

        what do you do when you say or do something you regret? like i know that the past is the past, but, is there ANY way to change it? i know its too late to go back... but what if in the past, i had wanted what you wanted? what if i DID want what you wanted? now its too late to say the things i should've said, too late to do the things i could've done... at first i thought it was just a lil thing, but it did more to me than i could've ever imagined. of course, now its too late. ive moved on, but what if i hadnt moved on? what if i'd ventured out into that little unknown place, just over the horizon... what would the outcome have been? having not done the things i could've done and having not said the things i should've said is screwing me up big time. i worry all the time. i stress all the time. in a word, im depressed. going into that downward spiral that'll make me more and more screwed up each day until i finally snap.  why??  why does it always happen to me? it seems that if im sposed to do sum'n, i dont or i do the wrong thing. and if im just sposed to not do anything, then i go n screw things up. am i a magnet for screw ups? maybe im just one big mistake. maybe i am not sposed to be here. this world isn't for me. im not meant to be here. thats why. i think thats what life is trying to tell me. that I SUCK. wednesday, july 14, 2004. yup. story of my life. wish i could've done sum'n about it. of course, if i did now, even MORE people would get hurt. and i think i've hurt enough people as it is. why? i could just cry right now. or rip myself up inside. even though i have what i want [?] i am still not completely happy. i should be used to that though, because no matter what, im never completely happy. its not coz i dont have enough or whatever, im not being selfish. well in a way im being selfish, but not for myself, i just want certain other people to be happy too. but it doesnt work that way. not in this dimension. or maybe i should say demention. thats what i live in: demention. or dementia. whatever. i am a paranoid schizo. everyones out to get me. why? why is life out to get me? if i make a good plan or sum'n, life takes me in the opposite direction so that i cant accomplish that one thing. if i want something, it goes the other way. always happens. argh. i should be happy, but im not. i am depressed. i'll snap soon. tomoro we're going to camp meeting for the day, and im already feeling like an antisocial outcast. yup. im going into that mode again. tomoro is gonna suck. i need a hug =(

       i finally found the perfect song for march 5, 2004   "Never look back," we said How was I to know I'd miss you so? Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind Where do I go?  And you didn't hear All my joy through my tears All my hopes through my fears Did you know, still I miss you somehow  From the bottom of my broken heart There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know You were my first love, you were my true love From the first kisses to the very last rose From the bottom of my broken heart Even though time may find me somebody new You were my real love, I never knew love 'Til there was you From the bottom of my broken heart  "Baby," I said, "please stay. Give our love a chance for one more day" We could have worked things out Taking time is what love is all about  But you put a dart Through my dreams through my heart And I'm back where I started again Never thought it would end  You promised yourself But to somebody else And you made it so perfectly clear Still I wish you were here  "Never look back," we said How was I to know I'd miss you so?   britney spears - "from the bottom of my broken heart"    yeup. that song would've been perfect on that day.....

       OKAY. I HAD A HUMONGOUS BLOG, AND THEN I ACCIDENTALLY NAVIGATED AWAY FROM THE PAGE. ARGHNESS. IT WAS HUGE. NOW I HAVE TO BLOG AGAIN :'(  ok. what was i saying? ah yes. i wrote that i havent blogged in a while. so i was saying what i have done since i last blogged. on sunday, went to that lil picnic.. fell asleep the entire time, then derrick poured cold water on me. after that, me, terry, malc, michael ui, and randy went to the theaters. we watched i,robot and spidey-man 2. both were SUPERB movies!! i got home around 1:15 =D anyways, next day i went to the dentist. i had a cavity, and got it filled. yay. it hurt =( anyways, after we got back from the dentist, i went out to metro with leanna, ra-ool, davis, jorge, jorge's cousin, shan, and terry... we ate out at boston pizza.. [little known fact to me: corona tastes like shiznit] after that, we went to playdium and yeah it was fun. AIR HOCKEY!! yay!! after that, we left, took the skytrian home, and yeah. said bye-bye to terry n ra-ool, and then the rest of us got off and me n davis said bye-bye to leanna coz she left yesterday for new york and yeah anyways, after that davis briefly tried to teach me how to drive standard. that way to drive seems cool, but arghness i must've stalled about 50 times... but whatever it was davis's fault. after that, i found ou that sparkling grapefruit is my new favourite drink... =P i got home around 11:20, and then we talked for a bit... [msn smiley ^o)] hahaha. anyways, i slept around whatever. i was tired. next day, ra-ool came over.. well, actually, he came over AFTER i FINALLY cleaned my room!! and THEN ra-ool came over!! we played video games.... OLD SCHOOL NINTENDO!! double dragon II, ninja turtles, and of course, SUPER MARIO BROS 3!!! after that, we sang along with music for like 2 hours almost i would say. BACKSTREET BOYS!!! "show me the meaning of being lonely" "you are my fire, the once desire" harmonizing was so much fun!! backstreet boys all the way, eh, ra-ool??!! after that, we rented movies, some movie i cant remember what its called but yeah it was pretty funny!! that night, eddy, bryce, and kaylee slept over coz we went BERRY PICKING TODAY!! davis tagged along too, but no thanks to him and bryce, we got "kicked out". coz davis n bryce weren't picking properly. they like just went ahead of everyone and just picked like crazy and the dude told them like 5 times or whatever coz they weren tpicking properly/thoroughly, and they werent like picking off the ground. yeah. so i only got $6. =( oh well. s'all good. after berry picking, we were bored, and bought pizza from d-hut pizza plus aka DHALIWAHL-HUT pizza plus, as me n bryce named it. the pizza smelled like the b.o. of east indians. it smelled like their food or whatever. anyways, the whole way back from macs to my house, me n bryce were talking with east indian accents "thank you come again" etc it was hilarious. we were laughign so hard. YEAH!! it was awesome. the pizza was arite, nutt'n special, kinda mehh. but i didnt really eat any. coz i wasnt hungry. anyways, today was a long day. im bored... tired... and i needa fold laundry...   question of the day: out or NOT out??

       im in a writing mood. im sposed to be going out to some bday party thingy at some park, but like like usual, the soongs are late. they were sposed to be here half an hour ago. and im sure that the minute i start writing what i wanta write, they'll get here. oh well.   why is it that when something that could be called positive or good happens, there's always something in the way of the perfect happiness that needs to be achieved? somehow the feeling isnt 100% happy. theres that lil nudge in the back of the brain nudging. all its doing is nudging. asking "how many people can you hurt in one day?" "why do you do the things you do?" "why do you always end up hurting others?" sometimes, you can make a HUGE mistake or you can just screw up [or whatever you wanta call it] in the worst of ways, and sometimes nothing happens. no one gets affected. but then again, in the very rare case of me, no matter what i do, no matter how significant or insignificant, shiet always comes as a result. sure there will be decent results, but along with those, theres ALWAYS that crappy little outcome that just sits there and stares you in the face asking why?? why do i do the things i do? why do i say the things i say? why do i live the life i live? it doesnt help that people jump to conclusions either, but i cant control what people think. assume all you want, ive given up on trying to make you believe what is true. you have the right to think what you want. i could care less. maybe i should just be so completely open with my thoughts and feelings that people would understand exactly what goes on in my mind. maybe i should just disregard the fact that i dont express what im thinking or feeling. or maybe it would be better if i just closed myself off from the world. just sat back and sort of put myself in my own little bubble where no one can affect me and i can affect no one. maybe that would be something good for once... maybe, just maybe, if i can run away from my feelings, my actions, my life. maybe if i can just be free from all this shittiness that has become my life, then i can have a decent life. a life free from pain, a life free from hurt, a life free from doing things and hurting people in the process. a life free from happiness. my happiness. i dont need it. if anything, in order to feel better for all the shit ive ever caused, i think i should just have all happiness taken away from me. heck, why am i writing this? i dont even know. its because of that little nudge in the back of my mind. the little nudge doesnt go away. its letting me know that i made a huge mistake. why do i wreck everything i touch? i dont know. i dont even know whats making me write this huge thing. obviously a part of me wants me to. what the FUCK!!    i want to get away...i wanna fly away

        feelings are very complicated things. sometimes you can control them, other times you cant. i wonder if its possible to control your heart? i think that its not. sometimes there are some rather surprising things to me that i find when i look in my heart [speaking metaphorically of course]   grr! blueberry picking. i have money now, lol!! i had to wake up at 5:30 yesterday morning and 6:00 this morning to go berry picking. the dude paid us 42 cents/pound. my feet are so sore today. and oh yes. i went out last night at 10:30 and got home at 1:30. i got in trouble, LOL!! vbs is fun. =D my group of kids are the greatest. so cute and hilarious. im gonna wake up at 8:30 tomoro [yeah right, but i i do,] i'll go for a run. and stop by a corner store and buy an energy drink that i'll drink tomoro night before vbs so i'll be all wired.................   maybe those lil things that cause tension between people could bring them closer together... all i know is SUM'NS goin down, just donno EXACTLY what...

       i was painting the railing in front of our house today. i got paint all over my hands and arms and legs. yeup. it takes forever to paint those stupid spindles. oh well. tomoro morning at like 5:30 i have to wake up and im going blueberry picking with leanna. arghness. i just got off the phone. hehehe.  here's a song. perfect for me. this song describes me, and how i feel bout my life. my theme song:   Linkin Park - "Easier to Run"    It's easier to run Replacing this pain with something numb It's so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone  Something has been taken from deep inside of me The secret I've kept locked away no one can ever see Wounds so deep they never show they never go away Like moving pictures in my head for years and years they've played  (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (If I could take all the shame to the grave I would) (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (I would take all my shame to the grave)  [Chorus] It's easier to run Replacing this pain with something numb It's so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone  Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back And never moving forward so there'd never be a past  (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (If I could take all the shame to the grave I would) (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (I would take all my shame to the grave)  Just washing it aside All of the helplessness inside Pretending I don't feel misplaced It's so much simpler than change  [Chorus] It's easier to run Replacing this pain with something numb It's so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone  It's easier to run (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made) It's easier to go (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (I would take all my shame to the grave)

       i like to play the sims. i got a new expansion pack today. "the sims superstar". the main reason i bought it is coz i found this coupon on the net on the sims site that was buy one get one free rebate type thingy. so im gonna send it in and they'll send me a free expansion pack of my choice. yay.  i woke up so early today. at like 9:00. went to church, and only now came home. i got new shoes, so thats a plus, but i have a headache and im tired like whoa. time to play sims: the unrealistic world that i created and control that i wish i live in.

[i highly doubt it] but yeah i hope. please please please. it'll make my summer feel worthwhile... *prayz*

       my nails are so long and pretty. i redid the nail polish on them last night. so pretty. lol. oh well, at least it keeps me from biting them.  last night i dreamed that me and some friends went to the evanescence concert. however, to our dismay, we arrived there at the end of the concert and then after everyone had left we tried to find the group and ended up running around the whole place and we were looking and looking and looking for them. we heard they were in this one place, and in order to get there we had to climb up like 30 flights of stairs. mr. honey [our principal] for some strange reason was there and he was locking all the doors coz he wanted everyone to leave. but me and tif kept running and running and running trying to get to the place where evanescence was. mr. honey was trying to prevent us to get there and he was running after us trying to lock all the doors. when we got to the place where evanescence was, we were told that everyone but amy lee was there and then all of a sudden just as we were looking at some evanescence barbie dolls and bobble heads [i have no clue why, must've been a messed up souvenir stand] i woke up.  yeah. this dream. a depiction of my disappointment. yesterday i found out that my friends dad, who was sposed to take us to the concert, wasnt feeling well. like not just a cold or nutt'n. he wasnt feeling well. heart condition. and it was actin up. or sum'n. plus he was under a lot of stress. they tried to get this other person to take us, but he was busy. so we couldnt go. darn-freakin-it!! oh well. i told my friend that he now owes me a concert. and theres a hoobastank concert some time this summer. and i wanta go to that too. perhaps. we shall see what the future holds.  time for more french 11 and spyro the dragon. ciao~

       oh yeah. i forgot to say. the funniest thing happend. last night, after the movies, i phoned my dad and he was coming to pick us up. leanna suddenly decided that she was hungry, so we started to walk across the parking lot to mcd's. when we were walking, these guys drove by in a car, and rolled their window down and called us sluts. puh-leaze. well it was like 11:30 at night... lol. anyways, we made it like ALL the way across the parking lot and were at like red robins, and then i saw my dad drive up to the theaters. we started waving like mad, but obviously he didnt see us. so. after our long slow walk towards mcd's we had to frantically run all the way back to the other side of the parking lot. talk about the days exercise. *phew!*  anyways. i just woke up. i had a fabulous dream. =P *sighz* wish i could go back to it. argh!!

       omg!! i have found my one true love. a certified hottie. the hottest guy. ever. allow me to prove myself:     [nice shirt]       ryan gosling. sooooo friggen hot. i love his smile. oh, and he's only 24!! ACK!! and he's CANADIAN!! I AM IN LOVE. i have found my one true love. *faints*   whoa. what happened? why am i on the ground. *correction* why was i on the ground? lol. anywyas, today was a ton of fun. i awoke around 10:00 and went downstairs to see my mom stripping the walls of the wallpaper. i helped her do that for a bit, then i went on the computer. after that i got sent outside to remove those fake lines from the 4 big windows on the front of our house. i also had to was the windows clean. that took me like 3 hours. and then in the middle of me doing that, jorge, leanna, and ra-ool came by. ra-ool n jorge started stripping the paint off the lil spindle railing thingy in the front of the house. oh yeah, and leanna threaded jorge's unibrow away. haha. jk. aww, no more visor! =P after that we washed the van. then i showered and then mom cooked pasta and egg rolls and leanna and i did ra-ool's hair. then we ate. after that, we all went to the movies. we watched "the notebook" and that is how i have found out that i love ryan gosling. after that, ra-ool n jorge left coz ra-ool has work tomoro and jorge has school. me and leanna snuck into shrek 2, and i think i have set a personal record: i saw shrek 2 three times in theaters, twice were sneak-ins, once i paid. yup. shrek 2 is hilarious. gotta luv it. besides. dont you think going to the theaters for $10.95 should be worth at least 2 movies? at least im getting my moneys worth. =P anyways. i got home minutes before 12 and i had a good day. today was fun. washing windows, sneaking into movies, and yeah. i think i should work on my french 11 course sometime soon. maybe tonight? hah. i think not. perhaps another day, try..... a few weeks from now? lol. i think i might play spyro tonight. perhaps i shall, perhaps i shan't. i am very indecisive, one thing i do know though, i write too much. ciao for now.

         What's Your Summer Dream Job?        Joystick Jockey  So maybe it's not the best way to meet a summer sweetie, but a dedicated gamer like you certainly knows how to beat the heat â€” hiding out in the great indoors, AC cranked. And it's about time you landed a plasma-screen gig â€” finally getting props for your dedication to couch conditioning and screen monitoring.  Let adrenaline junkies work their pecs, you've got the quickest reflexes this side of the Mississippi â€” and that's all the qualification you need when reporting to the keeper of high scores. So grab your joystick, chips-n-dip, and well-worn sofa seat â€” game on!  that is SOOO me!! speaking of which, i think im gonna go play some spyro...AFTER i do some french!! =P

       ok. i am stealing this from kayel's page, but with good reason. besides, she donno who wrote it anyways. and i like it. its really good. here it is:  "Have you ever noticed that the worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you and yet you can never have them. When the moment you can't feel them under your fingertips, you miss them? Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with them? Have you ever wondered which hurts the most, saying something and wishing you had not, or saying nothing and wishing you had? I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say. They are the things you get ashamed of. Because words diminish them, words shrink things that seemed timeless when they were in your head. Don't be afraid to tell someone that you love them. If you do, they might break your heart, but if you don't, you might break theirs. Your heart decides who it loves and who is doesn't. You can't tell your heart what to do, it does it on its own, when you least expect it. Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was to afraid to let you. Too many of us stay walled because we are too afraid to care too much for fear that the other person does not care as much, or at all. Have you ever loved someone and they had absolutely no idea whatsoever? Or maybe fell for your best friend in the entire world, and than sat around and watched them fall for someone else? Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle? We tell when we are afraid, afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us. But every time we tell a lie, the things we fear grow stronger. Life is about risks, and it requires you to jump. Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have, or could have had. You know you have something with that special someone when you two are sitting there in silence not saying anything to each other, but when you leave and you somehow feel that you had just experienced the best conversation you've ever had. That is something you should not lose."   yup. very thought provoking. and just before i read it, i was thinking to myself and i realized what my problem is. im too worried what other people might think. that might make no sense coz i claim that i dont care what people think. both statements are true. i dont care what people think, but i care what they MIGHT think. so once they think it i guess i dont care anymore coz i realize how little it affects me. i think thats why im so hesitant in everything i do. not only hesitant, but indecisive. EXTREMELY indecisive. sure sometimes i dont care, but sometimes i really cant make up my mind about certain things. back to what other people think. it bothers me. i worry. i know i shouldnt, coz when it comes down to it i COULD CARE LESS what the other person thinks of me and how they judge me. i guess i just worry bout what they MIGHT/WILL/COULD think. i dont know why i do that. coz what other people think, do, and say in regards to my thoughts and actions doesnt faze me. yup. i needa get rid of that worriness [is that a word?] of other peoples possible thoughts. i was thinking earlier and it hit me. many things ive done or rather HAVENT done have been affected by that stupid little fact that im worried of what people MIGHT think. i know this probly doenst make much sense. like its probly impossible to differentiate between caring about what people might think and not caring about what they do think. but there is a difference. and i can differentiate between the two. big difference. that little fact. its affected many of my decisions. many of my BIG decisions, and im not gonna get into detail. so. thats my problem. but how do i get rid of it? i need to push everythign aside. coz when it comes down to it, WHO GIVES A DAMN WHAT OTHER PEOPEL THINK? its all about me. i know its selfish, but when it comes down to it, its all about me, and whether im happy or not. i dont need the crap of not having ppl gossip about me and im dissatisfied with the decision ive made. its better to have ppl gossip about you and be happy. i think. coz i dont care. what they say is stupid. all that matters is that im happy. im not trying to come across as self-centered, and there is a difference between being self-centered and the fact that all that matters is my happines. there is a difference. ok. i feel as if ive been repeating myself over and over again and havent gotten my point across. do i even have a point? well i do, but then theres that other annoying fact that i am perfectly INcapable of expressing myself. the thoughts in my head are all jumbled up and i cant say them properly. ok. to sum up. i needa stop worrying about what people might think and focus on not only just my personal immediate happiness, but also that when im happy, that other people arent gonna get hurt in the process of me achieving my level of satisfaction, pleasure, euphoria, ecstacy, or any other word that can be used to describe happiness or whatever. yes. im blabbering on and on.  in regards to that passage i stole from kayel's page, it fit in with my thoughs too. coz some of the decisions that were affected by the possibility of ppl thinking low of me had to do with "love" or some other crap like that. [and yes, love can be crap]. anyways. that passage really has a good point to make. i like it. yeah.  ok i feel weird. as i sit here in this chair i feel as if i am levitating high above the ground in my chair. its a really weird feeling. i think its time for bed.

       okay. i eat too much. way too much. and if the rest of my summer goes like this, i'll be so fat by the time school starts. speaking of school, i started my french 11 correspondence course today. wow. its confusing. everything is written "en franÃ§ais" [no duh, but still]. difficultness. anyways. i saw a hilarious movie in theaters today: White Chicks. good stuff. hilarity to the max. i saw the movie with some of my most favourite people in the world: my cousins. my sis, jo, was there, and then malc and jez my cousins. the only person that was missing was mush. [we all wished you were there mush!] after that, my family, the dukes, the cautivars, and jez went to boston pizza for celebrating zack and zay's bday. it was fun. one of the waiters was gay. so we think. yay for him. =S after that, we went home. now i am home. i was on the phone, but now i am not. i think im gonna bring the ps2 up to my room tonight. im mentally debating whether i should or not. to stay up late or not to stay up late. that is the question. and since i have nothing else to say, and this blog, being like many of the other ones i write, POINTLESS, i shall leave you with that question. to stay up late or not to stay up late. yup.

        The Day:  yesterday was church. i had to run the powerpoint for praise. alicia got mad at me [slightly] coz i was late coming upstairs from youth class to run it. hello, dont get mad at me. if she says one word to me along the lines of "next time, dont be late" i'll just say right back to her "next time, dont ask me to run your friggen powerpoint" lol. yeeeup. anyways, after church it was potluck. then my family, the dukes, and the soongs, and jorge and ra-ool went to white rock. me and leanna walked around for like 3 hours. everyone else just sat around. me and leanna phoned ra-ool and we were like "omg. we're lost. we got on a bus and ended up in like semiahmoo. help!" and then we told them a street name and like 10 minutes later we see them drive by and we're just like hahahahahaha laughing and stuff and finally they saw us. of course we really werent lost and we really didnt take a bus. yup. it was funny. soon after that, we all went home. and soon after THAT, the dukes, my family, and the soongs all went down to richmond for that [asian] night market thing. [i gotta drive on the freeway for the first time coz i drove the whole way there, and i also gotta parallel park for the first time too!! yay!!] anyways, we walked around that crowded place, which was similar to a flea market, for like 2 hours or sum'n. i dont even know how long it was. then we went home and arrived home after 12:30. then i went on the computer for a bit and then went to my bed and read for like 10 minutes and then went to bed. and that was my day   Random Anecdote:  the funniest thing happend last night while i was brushing my teeth. it was like 1:30 and i was super tired. anyways, i was brushing my teeth, and then my toothbrush got stuck or sum'n and it somehow managed to fling toothpaste up my nose and all over my glasses. i was like WHAT JUST HAPPEND? it took me a lil while to realize that ooh. i have toothpaste up my nose. then i realized and did the necessary things to clean up my face. it was hilarious.   Miscellaneous Thoughts:  there is nothing going on in my mind. i have no random thoughts to tell you about. the only thing going through my mind is how the sliding door is open and i am cold and my ear hurts and im hungry. im also thinking about if i like my new "the day, random anecdote, miscellaneous thoughts" setup. it was an idea. tell me if you like it in my tag-board. =D

       after i finally finished folding [ack! there. again with the alliteration] last night i went to my bed. i read. for an hour. or so. "The Second Summer of the Sisterhood" [wow. that title has alliteration; i have a thing for alliteration lately] anyhoo. after falling into a deep sleep around 3:30, i slept for about the next 10 hours. then, close to 1:00 in the afternoon, during my lovely dream, which by the way was rather interesting, i was awakened with a phone call. leave it to one of my friends to call me during my sleep. oh well. it woke me up. yay. so i woke up. talked on the phone for about an hour, and then my mom went out. so, then i played some video games. SPYRO!!! [year of the dragon] i love spyro. i havent played it in ages, and today i finally beat this boss dude named Buzz [he's this overgrown toad that looks hilarious] and got to go to a new level. it is so cool. i cant wait to play again tomoro night!! after playing video games for like the entier afternoon [from like 2:00-7:00] with of course supper in between that somewhere, i lazily put on some clothes [no i wasnt naked but i put on y'know, CLOTHES CLOTHES] and went to church for praise practice. i have to run the powerpoint tomoro so yeah. now i am home. i wanta play spyro so bad. but since its practically Sabbath, i shall have to wait until tomoro night to play it again. *sighz*. im trying to think of something interesting to write in here. unfortunately for me, my life is anything BUT interesting. i think i MIGHT go take a shower now and possibly braid my hair for tomoro. or wait. no. i think i'll shower in the morning and just put my hair in a pony tail tomoro. im gonna wear pants tomoro. my outfit shall be all black. lately i havent really cared how i look. no makeup is perfectly fine for me. but tomoro i think i'll do the whole all black goth type look. black mascara, [heavy?] black eyeliner, and maybe even some dark lipstick, but i hate lipstick so we'll see on that. yes. tomoro is goth day. oh yes. hmm how shall i do my hair? i have to ponder that one for a while. i think. i'll..... im too lazy to braid it. maybe. we'll see. coz if i braid it i'll have to take a shower tonight, and im way too lazy for that right now. oh well. im writing exactly the type of turmoil-ish thoughts that go on in my mind. when im pondering, i think back and forth just like that what i just wrote and yeah its almost as if im talking to myself. but wait. i do talk to myself. oh well. ok. enough blabbering on and on about stupid stuff. bye!!

       You beleive in love. Your not sure why but all those cinderella fairytales really stuck in your head as a kid. You know the right person is out there but for now your fine as you are.      urlLink                                          Do You Beleive in Love     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    You beleive in it. But have lost your faith in it. Youv probably had quite the past with love and arnt ready to go back to that. You tend to push people away and because of this no one tries to get close anymore. Will you ever love again, maybe someday.     urlLink                                          Do You Beleive in Love     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    these results both describe where i'm at. yeah i took the quiz twice. the first result i think really describes where im at: im fine where im at right now, dont really need no one. the second result describes where my heart really is at: hurt, but really deep down. and i dont wanta get hurt again. yup. in a way, love sucks, but then again its great, not that im sure ive felt TRUE love from anyone other than my parents or sum'n like that. im trying not to get pulled into the whirlpool of fake pretty stuff that love is made out to be. coz i know its gonna pull me down again and smack me in the face with the REAL stuff that love is: hurt, tears, anger, pain. i dont wanta go through that again.

       1:34 AM. i am up. folding laundry. shirt after shirt. its never ending. today my mother decided to wash every single article of clothing we own. or something. i just got off the phone. i was on the phone for over 3 hours. or something. im not exactly sure. hmm. i am slightly hungry. maybe. today i was craving chocolate. and then just a lil while ago i was craving noodles [or "nootles" as i like to call them] i had some noodle craving the other night too. mmmm cravings. interesting. yes. i must fold laundry. laundry, laundry, laundry. its fun.  today us, the soongs, and the dukes went to some park in cloverdale. we bbq'd some burgers and had a lil picnic. it was pretty cool. i was reading my book: "The Second Summer of the Sisterhood" [sequel to "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"]. [i always wonder: doesnt "traveling" have two "l's" or is it really just one??] anyways. i also brought my pillow that i made in home ec. and lay there on the mat chillin to my evanescence music. i was feeling a bit anti-social. or maybe i was just pissed off. or well i wouldn't call it pissed off. just, well, perhpas i could call it peeved? whatever. i was just feeling anti-social. social outcast? perhaps. i dont particularly like people. i am more of an introvert person. i feel that i dont fit in in large groups. im not really one to like crowds. maybe thats just when im feeling moods like this one. coz usually, i like to be around people. im comfortable aroudn people. if im in the right mood, i LOVE being the centre of attention. oh yes, indeed. i love it.  ok. thats enough rambling on about crap. i think i'll end this blog now. *presses publish post* [ooh alliteration!!] *smacks head coz i am a retard*

       QUIZ TIME!! lol  u r immortal like me. U keep dark secrets to urself. u live in ur own dark soul. U cannot seem to find urself even if u try to find ur outside body. u feel like walls are closing in all around u. it rains on ur faith and washes it away leaving, torture suffering and pain behind that u have to face but can not escape from. Immortals DO have a good side though. To the IMMORTALS its a good side. They fall in love with mortals of the world they once were in. The mortals fall into a trap the immortals create. The immortals are very romantic and easy to fall in, love with. But eventually the mortals will give in to the romantic and loving side of our soulsUr eye color is black. Because u r immortal and have no communication with the mortal world. If u have any ?'s then message me. I will answer any ?'s u have      urlLink  r u a mortal?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       Your element is Rain: Sad, lonely, distant and unique. You are quite distant from emotion and people, but you have been made this way by one thing or another. Your are truly unique yet fail to see it, and are quite creative be it in art, music, writing, etc.. You used to let people in now you don't even bother to try having been hurt so many times in the past. Your attitude is that you don't need anyone but yourself, people are just trouble waiting to happen. But you really do want to trust someone no matter if you see it or not, deep down your waiting for someone to come and set you free. This kind of depression can turn dangerous, don't let them get to you. Not everyone in the world will hurt you, humans are humans and are not perfect. So most likely sooner or later you'll meet someone who feels like you do and perhaps your shell will eventually disappear.    urlLink   .:-|What is your true element?|-:. -With Anime Pictures and detailed answers-     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       interpretive    urlLink   *~  What kind of dreamer are you?  ~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       You Are a Werewolf    urlLink   A Quiz for the Odd and Extravagant: What Dark Ethereal being Would You Be?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    that was fun. yay!

       "Oh, Canada." the very words bring the warm fuzzies to my heart. lol. yep. i am in love with my country. nothing could beat Canada, ever. Canada is THE BESTEST country out there. yeah. all i can say is "happy birthday to the best damn country out there!!" oh yes. Canada is #1. the best, the beautifullest, the calmest, the... the.... well im speechless. the list is endless. this country rocks. yeah. last night when we were driving home i saw that they put the Canada Flag back up in front of the car dealership and hotel by guildford mall. it made my heart happy. hehehe  anyways. last night i went with the soongs and vanessa and kayel down to robson. we walked along robson for a bit browsing some of the [freakin expensive] shops. when in Buffalo, i found a pink sleeveless top that i fell in love with immediately. since everything in the store was 50% off, i decided that i must have the shirt. the total came to under $15. yup. i say it was a good buy. i had to wait in line at the cashier for like 10-15 minutes though. argh i think they needa get a second cash register in that store. oh well. after that, we went to eat at some chinese restaurant. yup yup! after that, mrs. soong wanted to rent some movies, so they rented "my baby's daddy" and "cheaper by the dozen" i wanted to watch "cheaper by the dozen" but we ended up watching "my baby's daddy" first. it was arite. nothing special. not that funny, but it had its decently funny points. oh well. after that we were going to watch "cheaper by the dozen" but daniel and vanessa were watching it downstairs. oh well. then i went home. and read a book. until 1:30. and then i woke up like 45 minutes ago. and now im here. again. like usual. wasting my summer away. i should eat. or something. i dont know what to do. i have nothing to say. i... i... argh. im bored!

LOL... =S and the village was hilarious. ok. catwoman was sposed to be my comic relief from the village, but it turns out that the village was my comic "relief" from catwoman. LOL. catwoman was pretty good though, but nothing beats the village and all its hilarity: mrs. clack, slow motion, nostrils, those we dont speak of, the forbidden colour, the safe colour, magic rocks... LOL. sure, there was this one part that was sorta freaky... and i was like plugging my ears coz the music is really what makes it scary, but in this one part this thing went across the screen and jez screamed/yelled. it was hilarious. we were like leaning close coz it was scary, but then it was sorta disappointing. oh well. hilarious movie. memoriez... good timez good timez!! well, they wanta go swimming coz malc slept over again, but im too lazy... would rather go look at that piano... we might get it... we have a "deal"... or sum'n... mehh anyhoo. oh. and now we're going camping to alberta instead of just a day trip... and more ppl are coming.. we're either leaving friday or sunday.. oh well. heh
