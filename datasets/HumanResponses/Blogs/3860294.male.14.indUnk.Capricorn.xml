      Day3(the Final Day)  Once again Todd woke us up at 6:30, grrrrrrrrrrr, we packed up, went to eat in the cafeteria. The guys got together in the gym for like an hour. We had a "guy talk" about sexuality and how it should be respected. haha the guy was stupid who gave the talk. but had some good stories like, one guy loved life so much, but one day he got his arm stuck between a boulder and a clif side while hiking ALONE. So he waited 3 days. He eventually cut his arm off w/a sharp rock. it took him HOURS! but he lived because he loves life so much, his arm means nothing. After that we headed over to the Conference. We had the worst seats! but it was ok. We sang praise and worship, by now i was beat. i was tired as i could be, and my clafs hurt from jumping. Then Mass started it was ok until the homily, geeze the guy could talk for forever! lol but it was soon time for communion. but during the blessing of the host, a girl was rendered unconcious by the holy spirit...in regular day MASS! how power is God...wow...haha...but she was unconcious for like 20. Then she woke up and we were all Dancing and SCreaming HAVING THE BEST TIME! the the bus ride home was fun lol, i watched people ply Maffia

      Day2  Ok Todd woke us up at 6:30. I went to the restroom cleaned up, went to breakfast, went to the conference and saved some seats. Then Praise and worship began. You should have seen everyone. they were all into it so much. It was really amazing. And my group looked really kool in our matching shirts, lol. Praise and worship lasted a while. Then it was eventually time for mass. Yeah Mass was long especially communion. But i LIVED! Lunch was right after that. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm food. we had sandwhiches then. Lol richard made a pyrmid out of the boxes...i mean he is like 6'+ and he could barely be seen over the top. Then the group moved its way back to the Conference. More Praise and worship. Then we split up. I stayed to hear a Father talk about the Media and hop it was affecting us all. Yeah it totally changed my veiws. It was nasty too. half naked women in ads. i cant believe its not illegal, but i realized what i needed to do. I have decided i will go into the media and forever change it. Thats my life goal now. Next the "young apostles" had a skit thingy where people ate things ina  certain amount of bites. the a girl had to eat someSPAM! lol she backed out right away and called up Fr. Jose. he ate it! i was amazed lol. after that, Adoration. Adoration is when the Bishop brings in the body of christ(most people will say its a piece of unlevened bread) but catholics believe its Jesus, but its when you express your intense regard and love and devotion to God and Jesus through deep mediation and prayer and ask for help if needed. But i couldnt believe my ears and eyes. Steubenville adoration is like no other. People opened themselves to demonic forces, others were rendered unconcious by the holy spirit. People were crying hysterically once the Bishop entered for no reason. People started laughing, for no reason. But really the holy spirit had entered and caused all this. I didnt realize what i had revieved from the holy spirit at the time. What did i recieve? I recieved belief. I had been dobuting God, but now, i cant think why i did. He is real! HE REIGNS! DONT FORGET!, after adoration we danced praised like no other lol. then My sis and I went to get emily a present and so we did. Then our group talked about our adoration expreience. it was a fun night. But once we got back to the dourms it was almost time for bed. but Todd bout all they guys a pizza lol. nothing better than Steubenville pizza! but then i heard something amazing. som guys were making their own music and dancing just cuz they wanted to! it was SO awsome. they were making a beat w/ empty bottles and some's guitar. It was fun. b4 i knew it, the time was 12:30, lights out. End of Day2.

      Day1 I packed up made sure i had everything. Kelly and I go to the church, find out we would leave like 30 min later, but i had a perfect time to look arround and see who is comming. I didnt know anyone that was lol. But then we packed up and went on the Charter busses and set off. About an hour into the trip someone asked Todd(my youth group leader) to put in Finding Nemo. You would think YAY! FINDING NEMO! but now everyone was like NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! lol AGAIN they said no because Todd lectured us on how Disney has a deeper meaning. A bad meaning. I mean it makes sense but come on i have heard that story like 5 times. lol. So eventually it went on. We made it into Lousiana arround 3 and stopped in Shreveport. Fun time. I went to Wendies to eat it was good. Then I went back on the bus where I called sarah. Neways the next thing i know i hear yellling. lol. Austin spilled some one's frosty on the seat. haha. it looked like poo. lol. We moved on to Alexandria from there. Nothing happened until we arrived at our Dourms. All the guys got off and went to their rooms. i found a nice spot set my sleeping bag and my boat up(lol my inflatable pool boat kept my comfy from the hard floors). Next we all went to the place where they held the Conference. We did some praise and worship for about 5 hours. then we went back to the dourms. we had about 30 min till we went to bed so i learned a card game. then it was 12:30 lights out. Day 1 came to an end.

      yeah i have been...  ...  ...  ...  Bored lately, so i havent really updated much so yeah w/e. Well, u know, i did change my site background music, so i did accomplish&nbsp;something new.&nbsp;School is comming up soon, itll be fun, i just cant wait to c my old friends. then also idk, i just, idk lol. but itll be fun at clark. I found out i only have 1 class w/rebecca and 1 class w/sarah, o well atleast were in a class together, but w/e. recently this one person i have talked to online, i wont mention her name, she is kinda weird to me. she gave up her faith, but in a situtation u would think u would want to be stronger in your faith. doesnt make sense to me, but neways... i tried convincing her to go into her faith again, but then again, most people dont veiw thing as the way i do. it just bothers me that someone cant believe in anything. i guess ill just have to accept the fact people can go through life clueless. O! i heard this on the radio, this might help out some people who read this: Is it a sin to swear? well, it isnt written in the commandments, but the only thing that relates to it is "Thou shall not use the Lords name in vain" by yelling out jesus christ and o my god as a swear word. but it does say in some parts of the bible that a person should not say words that would insult or make others feel bad....well yeah i gtg to Drivers Ed. now...       P.S. If yall want to email me, like about something to write about or w/e or make a crappy story, just email me or leave a comment...(my email=  urlLink shotpaintballer@comcast.net )

Thinking of something nice in my mind nothing. everything was bothering me. It was too hott. There were too many arrows. it was too...too, i never found out. Why was this happening to me u say? well too much DDR was simply to blame. I just came back at 10 pm from Main Event. The DDR machine there was nice. I left my house to go to main event arround 3. stayed till 10. sweating like crazy after the 1st 15 min. yeah it was all good. now i dont know what to say, nothing really to explain, cept for the pain i am in. well yep, nothing left to say...        hopefully i can sleep better now...
