      I'm back , I'm black and I'm feeling spunky, yo!( miss me?) Just got every thing confirmed for burning man, my first time( hey there has to be something left!!). Great way to spend the beginning of my 40th year on this rock, good friends, lots of alcohol and even more nakedness. Yummy! My big 4-0 is three days away, its going to be a wild little swaray, ya, ya, I'll post pixs! I've got my Harley tuned up and my black leather pants ready to go! Plus new tats lined up to get drilled into my flesh!!!! See, there is a GOD! LEO'S RULE THE WORLD! Hee hee hee!

      every once in a while, after i've been sitting around bitching about eating to much top romen and not anough sushi, something comes along to remind me of the perks of living my life. Like having a beautiful woman  sleeping in your bed  with your cat and being able to do a pen an ink drawing of them while they're still asleep..I'll eat top romen any day!

      trying to get ready for my  big 4-0 b-day, missed the opening at Bedlam, waiting to hear how it was. Got an e-mail from a friend on vacation in Asia, she's in tiland, floating in the salty sea, wish I was there. No art making today, interesting evening, one of those I'd rather keep to myself till I know you better... Did you know that Ichiban means NO. ONE in Japanese? at least , that's what she told me. HA HA it's funny how sweat can smell like sex, or is it that sex can smell like sweat? I always get things  back ass words, the story of my life... I just want to take my motorcycle for a ride and disappear into the horison...

      One of my favorite musicians had his birthday tonight( last night if your being technical) at the infamous BEDLAM down town. I got there late ( after 1am, hey I’m an artist, I own the night!!!) but Javier was still plucking away on his guitar with friends and making beautiful music. He has a band called the “Sunshine Boys” check ‘em out! There was , despite the late hour, still  a happy group of revilers, including one Danielle, piercing eyes mixed with lovely piercings and great conversation. Think of vanilla ice cream mixed with hot sauces, add a healthy dollop of brains and there you go. Also ran into Steve and Marine, his band “Wives and Lovers” will be @ The Big Foot Lodge Wed. Aug. 18th, well worth a look, they looked lovely as always and it was great talking with them. I’ve been hermit boy( for various reasons) so it was very refreshing to get out in this dirty little town and have a nice time. So happy birthday, Javier, and many happy returns!!! now I'm back home with Kwi my cat and my cocktail.  cheers!

       	 		 		 the ball was to big to fit through the door of my studio, so Timothy and Bridget let me put it in the parking lot of their loft and paint it there( sorry about the splatters!!!). I tried to leave as much of the LA stains that had built up on it from living at the Holly wood bowl for the last 2o years as I could.  The idea, a Mickey Mouse head( albeit a bit twisted) was a no brainer. Frank just finished the Disney Hall....soooo, big ball= mouse from hell! 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Frank Ball close up 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink emmeric .

      having one of those months, the kind when you remind yourself its good to be here . My " big  FOUR O" is the 31st of this month. That three year old little kid drawing all  over the walls with cray0ns is still trying to work his magic. I want to have some kind of wild celebration and surround my self with friends and stand up to shout" I'm still here, motherfuckers!!!". Have recently been having a hard time painting( ohhhh, poor me...) but am getting myself geared up again. On October 1st I'm in a West Memphis Three fund raiser show in Phx AZ . I'll post all the details as I get them, its a great cause. I was in a fund raiser for them at sixspace gallery( http://www.sixspace.com/gallery/wm3/), called “ Cruel And Unusual a Benefit Exhibition for the West Memphis Three" with Chad Robertson(http://www.chadrobertson.com/) great fucking artist who was at Otis with me , Exene Cervenka, The Clayton Brothers, Edward Colver, Glen E. Friedman, Camille Rose Garcia, Shepard Fairey, Jaime Hernandez,   Matt Mahurin, Marilyn Manson, Liz McGrath, Grove Pashley, Raymond Pettibon, , Floria Sigismondi.Winonna Rider and Jello Biafra both spoke to the crowd of over three thousand. It was a wonderful experience.  That’s it for now, keep painting emmmeric

      I'm in one of those moods, you know the one, when all you want to do is drink another glass of sake and chop your fucking hair off? Ya, that one. This turning  40 is a bit strange.  30 was a breeze, ( except for when i fucked up and got married for a year and a half, hi Amira!) but this 40 thing....Being an artist, I'm not looking to run the Senate ,( well, maybe the world...) but all I want to do is: PAINT! whaa whaa whaa! poor me! Alright, I'm over it! Now I'm off to chop OFF my fucking hair....
