        Today I went on a hike with the adventure program at camp.&nbsp; I have no idea where or how far we hiked but it was cool, unlike some of the campers.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were three campers, about 13 or 14, one boy and two girls,&nbsp;who were obsessed with King Arthur, Lord of the Rings, Heavy Metal, and Hot Topic.&nbsp; But they were so obsessed that they had elvish names and were calling each other King and princess.&nbsp; And then, they had sword fights and pretended to have bows and arrows for about and hour.&nbsp; What really scared me was when one girl decides to recite pi.&nbsp; They were like a mix of Jackie Evans(elf), Emily Shie(pi-sh), and Jennifer Wilburn(poser of Hot Topic).     &nbsp;   That was the excitement of the day until I&nbsp;got thrown in the pool by some counselors at camp with my clothes on...      &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    About a year ago at soccer camp one guy, Ben, was hitting on my friend Elena.&nbsp; She gave him her Sn and that was the end of that.... then about 6 months later he ims me begging me for her phone number and is freakishly stalking her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its hard to explain ....&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to the point ... tonight -&nbsp;a year later &nbsp;-&nbsp; he ims me :     &nbsp;     SlipX888 : i showed my friend a picture of u and he thinks ur totally hot!

      Hey Friends!   This is my blog.  I started it because I was bored.  This summer I've been working at Summer's Here, a day camp for kids ages 5-14.   Its awsome, and I love it.   I've met so many cool people, especially Hana- can't wait to party with you this weekend with Zoe, and Whitney.  Sadly, this is the last 2 week session, so camp ends in 2 weeks.   I will miss you guys, but at least my summer will truly finally start.    Tonight I had soccer practice.   3 people were there!!!   I think thats gotta be a record-low.   But my team, the Wildwings (I didn't make the name) is gonna rock this fall season.   Thanks to all of our new fowards!!!   And our goalie with a slight potential to be good.  :(  Oh well... not all teams our perfect.  More later...
