      in case anyone was wondering, it costs 83 cents to ship a cd in a slimline case in a bubble envelope first class.

      let me clear up some rules for the first mix, seeing as how questions are surfacing that i would have never thought of. #1 im making a CD.  if you want to make a tape thats cool (as long as its not for me.  i have no tape player.) #2 number of songs is up to you. #3 there is no theme for this mix.  just use it as an introduction to yourself, so when people start commenting we can learn something. #4 ALL CDS/TAPES MUST INCLUDE A TRACK LISTING.  dont leave anyone hanging.  thanks

      addresses will go out by may 1, for the first mixtapes. DO NOT WORRY if you go to coachella, just make the mix when you get back.  use the first mix as an introduction to yourself.  you dont have to explain the mix, (or defend it) so its open to interpretation.  anyone caught using the eminem song, "my name is" will be permanently barred from mixfriends.  the management

         heres the premise... make a mixtape. get a mixtape. its that simple.  if you are interested in receiving a mixtape from a random person every month, exposing you to the radness of far away lands, all you gotta do is make a mixtape. then... become friends, email, date, who knows. you can meet a bunch of new peeps. heres the catch. after the first couple months, mix THEMES will appear. a subsequent website will appear for participants to post their master mixes.

      how's everyone doing on the hip-hop/june mix?    here's a music poll to entertain the masses:  1) name your top three favorite songs of all time 2) top three artists of all time 3) top three album COVERS of all time (since we've already done albums in general)  mine:  songs- 1. get up offa that thing- james brown 2. walking after you- foo fighters 3. man in the mirror- MJ artists- 1. beck 2. bjork 3. aretha franklin album covers- 1. beck- sea change 2. they might be giants- flood 3. the beatles- abbey road

      JUNE MIX....   Here's my understanding for June mix.  Target send is June 1.  Theme is Hip-Hop/Rap.  you send to the person one below the person you sent to in may.  so last time it was TWO people down.  this time it's THREE people down.  isn't that right, js?    Just remember:  June 1st. Three people down. Hip-Hop/Rap Don't steal your music.  see you later guys.

      anyone own the re-release of brendan benson's debut cd, "one mississippi" and want to burn it for me? just wondering.  sidenote.  john frusciante (my personal hero and solo-artist extrordinaire, but more visible for his band red hot chili peppers) has anounced that he is going to release ONE FULL LENGTH ALBUM EVERY MONTH until next year.  the first one drops june 22.  what a stud.  and genius.

      Looking ahead to the June mix...  I have no knowlege or exposure to hip hop (sorry Ashley).  Rap and hip hop (and I don't even know if it's acceptable to lump them together) just never "grabbed" me. And, like any music, it's probably because I didn't take the time to sift through the music to find something I liked.  And, I'm  still open  to enjoying the June mix sent to me.  Consider this for June?  How about making the mixes from black artists?  (Am I right in assuming most hip hop artists are black?) That way it opens up the mix to much more music.  If not, I'll try and get a hip hop mix together...

       june's mix coming on like a HEART ATTACK   hi.  i pick  HIP-HOP .   now i know some of you might be scratching your heads at this point... but seeing as some of us really are music elitists- let's step outside the box.     HIP HOP.   and don't steal your music- if at all possible...which for some of you, i know it will not be.

      We may be music elite-ist and I don't think that is a bad thing.  I hope the person sending me the cd fills it with music  he thinks  is good and  I've never  heard it before.  My mix included stuff I really enjoy.  If the recipient doesn't like some of it, or all of it, it won't affect how I feel about it, but it will have offered something may be she hasn't heard before.

      still no mix over here? who was supposed to send to me. get on top of that.  i know a few people got mixes.  anyone want to comment to me besides saying, "the mix i got sucked."  ???  i think i have uncovered a tiny problem within our little system.  we represent a very tiny subsect of music afficianados.  almost everyone who participated in the first trade is a bit of a music elite-ist.  just admit it.  i think i have a damn good taste in music, but i did a lil' undercover work to find out about the girl i had to mail to and it was actually really hard to make her a mix.  once we start theme time, itll throw everyone out of their element.  IF YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS FOR JUNES MIX, COMMENT AWAY! -t mgmt

      last week, john frusciante released his first of 6 cds to come out in the remainder of 2004 (1 per month), "the will to death."    once you get past the extremely creepy cover art, its a good listen.  this disc is true john frusciante, clean, unpolished, and safe.  i would have like a bit more of the guitar layering that i have grown to love from JF, but its still a good listen.  if you dont own any solo JF, start with his last disc, "shadows collide with people."  ( urlLink actually you can download the acoustic version from his site, search under the demos section .)  +5/10

      Anyone for this idea?  Might I be so bold as to suggest we post our mixes and who we sent them to (and the date)?  It would: a)       Expose us to the music we're sharing, 2)       Make sure the right person is getting the right mix, and lastly)  Give the recipient and idea of when they will be receiving their mix.  We post our track list as a regular post and if anyone wants to make a comment they can.

      I got a great mix from Beth, a disc loaded with good music.  I especially liked Travis Morrisson cover of a Ludacris rap song  What's Your Fantasy?  and Beth Orton's cover of Cat's Steven's  Wild World .  There were a lot of artists I was unfamiliar with which is the best part of mixfriends.  I throughly enjoyed this disc.  Thanks for the effort Beth!

      patrick got your disc.  will give it a listen today.  tina im mailing out monday.  everyone else, hope things are good.  heres my question.  WHO IS THE ULTIMATE BAND BREAK-UP?  i say N.W.A.  not only did they break up but they all threatened each others lives on their following releases.  who knew that dre., eazy, ice cube, mc ren, and yella were such hooligans.

      Being the unofficial self-appointed Cake promoter that I am, I'd like to point every's attention to  urlLink this page .  Apparently, Cake is releasing a preview of each song on their new album, "Pressure Chief" each Tuesday.  I can't wait for the album to come out.  I think it's this September when it will be released.

      ok, heres what we are going to do. we will just post our playlist for our life mix on the site. you can find the number one songs  urlLink HERE  (thanks tina) ill be damned if i am buying any milli vanilli/50 cent/bryan adams songs from iTunes. plus after i wrote out my mix, it was god awful.  so heres the  NEW THEME  for august. we will go with resident jasons propsed theme  "BANDS THAT HAVE BROKEN UP."  i will make it a little bit easier and go with bands that are no longer making music.  so run with it. and post your life story playlists (including why the dates were important)!  addresses to go out tomorrow

      questions for y'all... 1- how many songs do you have in iTunes? 2- which artist do you have the most from? 3- what is your craziest playlist title?   i also have a question to ask.  i know it was my suggestion, but it is really kind of hard to find the billboard statistics, so let me know if you think we should make a different mix this month.  THE BILLBOARD BOOK DOES EXIST, but ive already gone to 3 libraries and im about at the end of my rope.
