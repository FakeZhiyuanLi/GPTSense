      Oh god, this is strange. I just got back from the Enchanted Castle (oh yay, tokens for everyone!) with my church and I am as exhausted as hell. Since this is my first post, I'm not sure what to write. Guess you should get to know me a little bit better. Umm, here are some things that I love: Elijah Wood, music, mocha javas, reading, relaxing, Elijah Wood, movies, vampires (of course who doesn't?), Asian stuff, Elijah Wood, speaking in different languages to infuriate people, going crazy go nuts, and Elijah Wood. I think that's all the time we have for today, folks. It's 11pm and I'm tired, so g'night.  TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES!!  Rachel/Mouse Wood

      well, at the moment i'm trying to create an alanis morissette fan website, and i must say i'm not having much luck. i have everything planned out - i even have a logo! but i need to find a server to post it on. i was thinking about using blogger as the base for the website, but that's just an idea. i don't know how it would work to do that, because i don't think you can post any pics on here or anything, and that kind of sucks. if anyone can help me find a good server (besides freewebs - i've got like 4 websites on that server), i'd be eternally grateful.  thank you so much to everyone for your love and support!!!!  mouse

       "anyone plain can be lovely anyone loved can be lost what if i lost my direction? what if our love is the cost? anyone perfect must be lying anything easy has its cost anyone plain can be lovely maybe our love is the cost"  -barenaked ladies, "falling for the first time"  isn't that a wonderful song? *sigh* despite the fact that i'm listening to it right now, i'm in a terrible mood. of course i was woken up today at 6:30 after about 4 or 5 hours of sleep, what else do you expect? right now i'm doing another "babysitting" job for my little brother. he's watching scooby doo in the same room as me, so i'm doing  some  of the job. ^_^  well, matt's coming over today and will undoubtedly be caffeine-high. (not that that's a bad thing, but for  this  little guy, it sort of is.) i'm feeling a little more awake now, but my stomach's starting to hurt and i think i might throw up on the keyboard or something. (lovely sentiment, really it is.) so i think i'm going to say good-bye for today and post sometime in the near future.  until then, adios!  mouse  p.s. "mouse" is my nickname, by the way. most people call me rachel, but i am known as mouse to those who know me well enough. if you want an explanation on that nickname, email me.

      ...so freaking tired. krystal is at my house right now and she's being all weird-like, like even moreso than she usually is. she said she took that personally, but, whatever. elmo threw up on the couch today (or yesterday) and i'm SO FREAKING AMAZINGLY MAD AT HIM! but i still love him.   well, tonight we plan on watching tons upon tons upon tons of movies, and hopefully we'll get to see 50 first dates because of the lovely sean astin. he is a great actor, i'll give that to him. and if you guys reading this ever saw the lord of the rings, then you'd be surprised to see him flexing his "glutes" in that other movie. he also has a lisp, which is pretty damn funny.  okay well that's all. i've posted enough for today.  au revoir. and toodles! no matter how gay that sounds.  mouse wood

       "there was nothing in the world that i ever wanted more than to feel you deep in my heart there was nothing in the world that i ever wanted more than to never feel the breaking apart all my pictures of you"  -the cure, "pictures of you"  jeez, i hate mornings. my mother woke me up today at 9:00 from a lovely dream that involved elijah wood and a harley-davidson  (oww-oww~!), only to tell me that i had to baby-sit my little brother nathan for an hour and a half while she took kyle to the optometrist. that probably sounds lame, but i think that during summer vacation, people need their  rest  for crying out loud. ...well, whatever. i'm up now, but i don't want to be.  hmm, i'm going to have to think of stuff to write about. it  was  raining when i got up this morning but now it's sunny. *hisses angrily* i'm not too fond of the sun. that's okay, though, coz i'm going to see shrek 2 again today and then come home to watch various brandon lee movies. god, i love brandon lee. R.I.P.  since not much has happened since i last checked up here (which was two seconds before i went to bed), i might have to sign off. one last thing, though - i had a craving for a smoothie last night so i decided to mix fruit juices, and i ended up blending orange juice and white grape juice. it's DELICIOUS. seriously. when you drink it you feel like you're on some tropical island. and for a tired little girl who got back from an evening at enchanted castle, that is pretty damn good.  well, tally-ho!  rachel
