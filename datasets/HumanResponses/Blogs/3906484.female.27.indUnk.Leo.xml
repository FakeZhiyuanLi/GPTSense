      So, not suprisingly, I didn't connect with Kerry.&nbsp; I tried.&nbsp; But, it doesn't really matter -- I'm not the average mid-western, christian, battleground state voter.&nbsp; Does anyone really like John Kerry? Maybe,&nbsp;eh, I doubt it. &nbsp;Anyone that says they like him are just lying to themselves to make the whole process less painful.&nbsp;   However, Bush sucks more. What are ya' gunna do?&nbsp; Suck it up...moving swiftly along....   Brilliant analysis of the speeches by  urlLink William Saletan  from Slate. Sums up my thoughts exactly.&nbsp; Some highlights:   About Gephardt:    Poor Dick Gephardt. He's the guy who conspired with Kerry to stop Howard Dean in Iowa....What does Gephardt end up with? A seven-minute speech at 8:30 p.m. on the night when the networks won't be watching. He warms up the crowd for Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader who decided not even to run for president. Worse, Gephardt has to deliver a line praising Kerry for picking Edwards. About Kucinich:    The band plays "Power to the People" as Kucinich takes the stage. He's one of those student-council types whose self-image as a world-historical figure can't be shaken by any audience or election result. About Bob Graham:    I stop taking notes. What possessed this man to run for president, I have no idea. He's so inanimate that when he delivers his last line, nobody's sure he's done. He simply steps back from the microphone and starts waving toward the Florida delegation. The band breaks into "Shout," which seems to be played only after the worst speeches. I guess it's the convention operators' way of waking people up. About Sharpton:    I'll say it again, he's a scoundrel. But if there's a better speaker in American politics right now, I'd like to meet him. About Dean:    If this were Dean's convention, how would it look? How would it sound? For starters, the nominee would be a lot shorter. Clinton was here last night, looking like a giant. Kerry's even taller. Standing where Clinton stood, Dean looks like a midget. Yet I'm certain Dean would have been a more authentic and authoritative heir to Clinton. Like Clinton, Dean believes he owns the room. Like Clinton, he doesn't need to search the crowd for approval. Self-approval is enough. It's the thing Kerry most conspicuously lacks, and the thing that can't be taught. About Teresa Heinz-Kerry, well, the whole thing is priceless -- do read it -- but here's an excerpt:    In the video, a friend vouches that Teresa has been "exposed" to people who have been treated badly. This is the way rich people talk about working people, and working people know it.

      1. Have you seen this documentary called Trekkies?   OH MY GOD! Oddly enough, I'm sure the Democratic convention looks much the same, as did Howard Dean Meet-Ups.   2. The Struggle of messaging.   I'm sitting on my couch, trying to hone our message. What can we say to get you to vote for us? It's a fine line, a slippery slope.&nbsp; The goal is to say something "meaningful" with out saying anything at all.   What are campaigns anyway? Do we really live in a Democracy?   3. Check out cooler-than-hipster mag  urlLink Vice Magazine , especially the Dos and Donts.&nbsp; Funny shit. I particularly like the "gay Japanese B-boy from Chile who got a javelin scholarship and once gave birth." Is that a Do or a Don't?

      So, I've been getting shit for criticizing the Democratic Party, namely Kerry. Well, it's because it's broken. The Democratic Party is broken and it lacks vision. It's bought and sold too, and those that choose not to see that are living under a rock.   Great article in the New York Times Sunday magazine this weekend. The cover story  urlLink "Wiring the Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy"  by Matt Bai explains this much more eloquently than I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, we have no message and are unable to think past any given election day. We are currently the weakest we've been in decades and lack a game plan to market our selves and moblize.   This guy, Rob Stein, put together a 40 slide power-point mapping out the&nbsp; Right-wing take over of the last 30 or so years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rob wants to essentially do the same thing and he and some others have formed the Phoenix Group, a clandestine group of wealthy donors that are sick of dealing with the Democratic Party establishment and are ponying up the money to rise from the ashes.   The goal is to save the party from "empty centrism."&nbsp;   Great article, read it.   Also note, the SEIU is doing great things for organized labor -- mixing it up a bit. Similar situation.

      " urlLink Washington Wives " is a new reality TV show following Teresa Heinz Kerry and Elizabeth Edwards on the campaign trail.&nbsp; Surprise, surprise! Tereasa comes across as&nbsp;"pompous and slightly ridiculous." Sounds like her husband. They do own 5 homes, one of which was imported from England. These are the voices&nbsp;of the working class?   Where's Judy when we really need her!   BTW, i learned how to link! thanks phil james!

      Interesting article in The Nation by Katrina vanden Heuvel this week called "Victory in 2004 -- and beyond." I'd link it but I'm not that smart.  &nbsp; She argues that the progressive voice has finally been heard and that now is our chance to really create substantial, effective positive change. I question this.&nbsp; Part three of her article discusses this "progressive uprising" where she states: &nbsp;   As has historically been the case, progressives gave Democrats their voice in the run-up to the 2004 elections. The campaign started with the unprecedented mobilization against the war in Iraq in 2002-03. Millions rallied around the globe, opposing a war that had not even begun. Although the Bush Administration spurned them, the New York Times heralded the demonstrations as signaling the rise of a new power in the world--global public opinion. And in the midst of that mobilization, progressive organizations here like MoveOn.org were expanding exponentially, building an Internet base of more than 2 million citizens.  &nbsp; When the lies and staggering incompetence of the White House were revealed in the war's aftermath, the fury among progressives made itself heard. At a time when Beltway pollsters and pundits were warning Democratic presidential candidates that Bush was too popular to take on directly, MoveOn began publishing full-page ads censuring the President for misleading Americans. Howard Dean's meteoric rise came because he tapped into that anger, realizing that Democrats were looking for a candidate who would challenge Bush across the board. "There's a lot of recycling going on," Dean complained as other candidates began echoing his aggressive stances.

      i just got off the phone with my ex, ben, the original ex and he suggested i should&nbsp;write about exboyfriends. i agreed, but said that i had to write about all of them, or at least the most significant ones. here are the top four, in time sequence order:&nbsp;  &nbsp;  ben, oh, ben. 7 years together, we just celebrated our 3 year break up anniversary. i first meet ben in 3 rd grade, in miss jenner's class. he was the new boy so we all had a crush on him. i remember he would pick his scabs so they would scare because he wanted to be pink when he grew up.&nbsp; ben's a great guy -- a brilliant writer. i love him. we were young together, traveled around the world together. he lives in seattle, he is addicted to women's basketball, he's into vice magazine, he's into all the hipster stuff but with out being a hipster. he's far cooler than i'll ever be and perhaps that's why we're not together.&nbsp; we're great friends&nbsp;and i wouldn't want it any other way.  &nbsp;  denis, oh denis was after ben. he's a russian jew from moscow, who&nbsp;i fell in love with in spain. he smokes way too much, drinks way to much (a common characteristic of all my lovers), and is a great lover. he has mastered 18th century english literature, has his phd in peace studies, and works regularly as a translator. we spent many spanish nights off our tits, dancing in dodgy discoteques then stumbling to the beach for the high noon sun.&nbsp; then we left spain and went our separate ways. i adore him.  &nbsp;  eric, oh eric was after denis. eric and i had a very tumultuous relationship. when it was good, it was fucking good, when it was bad, it was fucking bad. it was the puerto rican passion in him that caused the drama, and the english accent that neutralized it. he was a sailor, a writer, and&nbsp;a bartender.&nbsp; he&nbsp;possessed that hedonistic streak that i respond to all to&nbsp;well -- don't know if san francisco ever recovered. &nbsp;we were like two bundles of fire and when together it was amazing and dangerous, i believe it's what killed us.  &nbsp;  jkd, my sweetie. i fell for jkd during an intense part of my life, while on the Dean campaign. i didn't mean to let that happen, but he snuck in. he's endearing. also drinks too much, and like the three others, is a brilliant writer. he's intellect is far superior than mine and it intimidates me. i made mistakes in this relationship, i wasn't ready for it.&nbsp; so many nights together in the DFA flop house -- could the roommates hear? probably. he's&nbsp;a special guy.   those are the boys of my life. sprinkled in between are&nbsp;many other guys, whom i adore as well, whom have their own stories. i especially adore the ones that will likely read this blog -- you're special too.  &nbsp;  and right now, i'm single and loving it. could it be any other way?

      let's talk about gay marriage today. i love this topic because i can talk about fags and politics together.  one, ha ha mutha' fuckers! you stupid piece of shit republicans lost your battle yesterday.  the senate killed the debate about your proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage.   it feels really good to finally win something!  two, i've done my polling for my district.  it turns out even in rural Colorado, they don't give a shit. this was a pleasant surprise. almost 60% of rural coloradans support either gay marriage or civil unions. this is in a predominately republican district. this issue isn't gunna stick boys.  three, check out my dear friend ian miller's recent op-ed about gay marriage. i would link it but i don't know how to do that yet, you'll have to cut and paste. Here's an excerpt:  "The realities of living intimately with another person and the resultant emotions are human conditions, and not unique to one sexual orientation or another. We must put up with our partner's quirks and bad habits. We listen to their snoring. We deal with our husbands' and wives' "issues," mood swings and errant hairs. There are warts and toenails, strange funguses and body odor."  http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/story/1428829p-7552394c.html  Gee, I really want to get married. The fags have it all figured out.  GO FAGS! FUCK THE REPUBLICANS!   (I'm a bit sassy today, it's cuz i'm very hung over)

      I stole this thought from HOT micah, who actually stole this from the washington monthly. no original thought for me today.....  The right wing is claiming that John Kerry is the #1 most liberal member of the Senate and John Edwards being #4.  This is not the reality. I may actually like him if that were the case.  Here's the stats:  2003: Kerry - 1st (96.5) Edwards - 4th (94.5)  2002: Kerry - 9th (87.3) Edwards - 31st (63.0) 2001: Kerry - 11th (87.7) Edwards - 35th (68.2)  2000: Kerry - 20th (77) Edwards - 19th (80.8)  1999: Kerry - 16th (80.8) Edwards - 31st (72.2)   Average: Kerry - 12th (85.9) Edwards - 24th (75.7)  The rankings for 2003 are skewed by the campaign season, and a longer look shows that Kerry is liberal, but hardly a Paul Wellstone liberal, and Edwards is smack in the middle of the Democratic pack.  The only reason Kerry is as liberal as he is, is because he needs to stay elected in MA. I hardly think he harbors the convictions of Jimmy Carter or Paul Wellstone.

      First of all, a shout out to Derek and Romaine, my favorite radio talk show hosts. They're on Sirius OutQ, 149 -- satellite radio. I love them! If you haven't heard them, make it a priority. It's funny shit.  Also, I'm freshly addicted to Queer as Folk. I love Brian.  Question of the Day: what's the term for a women who is actually a fag? Because this is me. I am a fag trapped in a women's body. No joke. What does that mean? I'm not a fag hag, because fag hags don't get laid. A fruit fly? Is that what I am?  Please define me.  Secondly, when I was in Iowa, we were talking about fags and some cute, little, strait, do-gooder pulled me aside and ever so politically correctly said, "I think the term fag is offensive and derogatory and ask you to please not use this term." Of course I was like, "Fag? Fag's a bad word?"  I explained that the word had been reclaimed and he responded that it had not in Iowa, at least in the strait community.   Can a strait women in Iowa reclaim the word fag, or does it have to be done by the gay community?

      In Colorado, they hate Howard Dean. A group of us DFA alum were at the bar -- surprise, surprise -- the other night and the never ending GHD vs Dems debate continued. It was DFA vs. party establishment types.  These words were actually said by people paid by the Democratic Party:  "Howard Dean was the worst thing to happen to this party in years."  "Howard Dean set this party back by at least 4 years."  I still don't understand the reasoning for this. I'm thinking it was highly irrational as we were always referred to as "you Dean people." To me, by lumping us "Dean people" into a group like this, they were projecting the "us vs. them" paradigm, indicating that they feel threatened.  Funny enough, the next day I went to the 21 Century Democrats/Democracy for America grassroots training and 200+ people attended. That's the true result of Howard Dean. Maybe it's the awakening of the masses that is the enemy, at least to those who want to keep their power, including Democrats.

      why are the Democrats tools?  I question this every day. The more I work in this party, the more I wonder if we can pull it off.  The Democratic establishment is stuck in a spineless box, unable to create a platform.  The "anyone but bush" attitude is what kills us. What does "anyone but bush" mean? What is "anyone but bush's" health care platform or stance on gay marriage or economic development policy. Just because we are not something, doesn't me that we are something else.  Why do we let the Republican's frame who we are?  We can't define ourselves by something that we are not.

      Own Your Shit  yes, i have succumb - i have a blog. can't believe it took this long actually. my blog is called "own it" because that's what you've gotta do. own your shit is what it really means.   be comfortable in your skin, take responsibility for yourself and your actions. don't worry about other people's judgments, those are their issues, not yours. be alive, be kind, think about things.  my blog is about my politics, my anger, my youthfulness, my idealism, my cynicism, my sexuality, my power, my work.  the elbows will get greasy.

      in 1977, the "son of sam" was arrested in NYC after killing 6 people.  in 1994, President Bill Clinton claimed presidential immunity in asking a federal judge to dismiss, at least for the time being, a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Corbin Jones, a former Arkansas state employee.  in 1972, North Vietnamese forces block Routes 1, 4, and 13 -- all major South Vietnamese ground supply routes to Saigon. For the next two months, Communist forces repeatedly interdicted these and other key supply routes critical to Saigon's survival in an attempt to strangle the city.  in 1949, President Harry S. Truman signs the National Security Bill, which established the Department of Defense.  1821, Missouri became the 24th state.  it's also the Colorado Primary, George Tenent has been replaced, and it's my birthday.

       I'm coming around to Kerry -- shocking, I know. I listened to his speech again, this time on the radio, and it was far less horrifying than watching it. In fact, it was even good. The good thing about this whole dilemma is that I don't really need to like him anyway. It doesn't really matter what I think.   I predict a Kerry victory and Democratic control of the US Senate (and of course the Colorado one too!).    I know it's a few days late (as are my blog entries these days), but check out  urlLink William Greider's  take on the virtues of the Democratic Party.   An excerpt:   The contemporary Democratic Party has also drawn back from the kind of up-close engagement with ordinary people that used to be its hallmark. It is still very much a top-down operation, despite this year's efforts to knock on doors and talk to real people. The mass-market technologies of television-driven campaigns encouraged this distancing but have also weakened the party's ability to listen and learn, to grasp what's bubbling up in people's lives and how Democrats might respond imaginatively. A disconnected politician can still win elections, given the uses of big money, but he may also be blindsided by political upthrusts he didn't see coming. He loses self-confidence. He relies more anxiously on abstracted analyses from polls, policy experts and pricey consultants. Kerry's career and campaign reflect these limitations. Within his party, losing touch is a low-grade disease.

      who knew? for those of you that didn't take part in the Iowa Caucus chapter of my life, you can stop reading.  I'm in full agreement with  urlLink David Yepsin 's critic of Governor Vilsack's apology to the Latino Caucus for championing the "English Only" bill in 2002. In the Des Moines Register's article, Yepsin calls this nothing but pure politics, not true conviction. Why after all, would a Governor issue an apology for legislation he supposedly regrets from 2,000 miles away, to no one from that state, and not inform the state's local media? Well, it because he only wants to apologies half way -- knowing the popularity of the bill back at home -- and is only doing so because he wants to win a seat in the Kerry administration.  Sorry to my friends in Vilsack's office (matt and franny), but I'm going with Yepsin on this one.
