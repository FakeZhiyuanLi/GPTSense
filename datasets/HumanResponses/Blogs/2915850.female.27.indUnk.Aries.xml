      I must say, I hate it when people boast about how they got their blog to do that cool little mousover, or automatically list their top five favorite indie songs, or taste like cake--mainly because I can't understand what the hell they are talking about.  But being a complete novice to this new-fangled computer-talk myself, I do have to say I'm pretty happy about changing my blog  urlLink to match my shoes .  I guess I'm not very ambitious.

      It is February.  What it lacks in days it makes up for in drudgery.  February is long, cold, and grey.  February is the double-rolled toilet paper of months.  February is the crappy, low-budget sequel to January.  In February, my brain is an ellipses looking for a period.  These are the few feebled thoughts that I could muster for today.  Women would have a different place in history if Adam hadn't been such a fink.  Interpol may be a bunch of pretentious bastards, but they are pretentious bastards you can dance to.  Why are "potato," "monkey," and "Canada," so inherently funny?  The overriding emotion when I think of the fact that my parents will be staying with me for three whole days, and then be in town for three whole months, is much more similar to nausea than happiness.  But maybe it's a happy nausea.  The smell of drycleaning stores always vaguely reminds me of happy moments in my childhood that don't actually have anything to do with drycleaning.  I admit it, I can't resist a good dancing movie, but especially a good dancing movie with  urlLink Diego Luna  in it.  Hence my excommunication from the Superior Snooty Movie Club.  Brazilian waxes: liberating, or just a clever new form of torture?  If it weren't for all the damn catnip, my cat would have figured out cold fusion by now.  Sometimes it's nice to embrace  urlLink social conventions .

      When I was nine my father had a double bypass operation, and he decided that before he stared death in the face again there were a few things he wanted to get done.  Europe was one of those things.    So with my dad's healing chest looking like a YKK zipper he bundled us all on a plane to Munich, bought a VW van, and drove us through almost the entire western half of the continent in three months.  Sometimes my parents ask me if I remember all of the historically and culturally significant places I saw.  When they talk about how lucky I was to have played in Trevi Fountain, all I can remember is my perfect aim when I squeezed my hands together in the water, resulting in a spray that hit my sister dead in the crotch.  There were some big statues around, though.  But there was one thing that even my nine-year-old irreverent self was in awe of, and that was Europe's Cathedrals.  Coming from the Midwest, Cathedrals are few an far between, and none of them have that heavy, ghostly quality of something that has been around for centuries.  In fact most of them are a sort of 70's translation of grandeur; they all have the greenish burbur carpet, abstract rectangles of colored glass, and of course the ubiquitous gold-flecked laminate lamp covers.  Europe's Cathedrals were built by people who thought worship was serious business.  You won't see some hippie with a guitar singing in the Notre Dame.  No matter what country we were in, there was always one old woman dressed all in black kneeling in front of the largest statue, looking as if she were praying to the lord to spare the life of her first-born son.  There was lots of dark wood, giant blooms of red and blue glass, with several panes depicting the solemn, leaded faces of saints.  The smell of dust and the strangely comforting mildew of old books was everywhere, and hundreds of votives flickered at the feet of Jesus, Mary, and a few saints, their marble faces a smooth, quiet tragedy.       My sister and I went to a Cathedral nearly every afternoon we were in Europe.  We dropped our coins in the donation box and each lit a candle.  I don't know what my sister did, but as the flame began to catch I always whispered some prayer I can't remember, some ferverent wish that my nine-year-old heart must have thought was the most important thing in the world.    I'm not a religious person.  Confused is probably the best description of my spiritual upbringing.  My mother is a Catholic who hates the Pope, and my father is an agnostic when he's feeling generous (mostly he's an atheist who can't understand why all of these reasonable people went crazy).  But for a good year after I was in Europe I set up a little shrine in my room, lit a candle, and prayed to the Virgin Mary every night.  She was, after all, a mother, and like most little girls I was fairly convinced that mothers were holy.  But the most important element was trying to recreate the weight of those Cathedrals; I wanted the heavy, history laden air, the feeling that I carried with me every person who had ever lit a candle, closed their eyes, and hoped for something good to happen.  These days, with Mel Gibson's big budget gore-fest ruffling feathers, I am back to my religiously ambiguous ways.  I still like the idea of Santa Clause.  Buddha was an okay guy.  That's pretty much where my thinking on the matter ends.  But regardless of who hates who or which history is deemed the right one or what the true significance of a little strip of celluloid is, sometimes I still stop to think of the fact that hundreds of spectacular man-made works of art dot the earth.  Each is vastly different in aesthetic and religious context, and each fantastic in their own way, but the one thing that joins all of them is that they were built in homage.  The homage of our ability to dream of better things.

      Ah, the Academy.  Beacon of truth, justice, and ideals.  A symbol of cooperation and humanitarianism--the very origin of the accomplishments of man.    This was where I wanted to spend my life, imparting my knowledge onto the  tabula rasa   of tender-eared Freshmen, collaborating with my colleagues, conspiring to make the world a better, righteous, and pure place.    When I first took this job, marginal and low-paying as it was, I thought I was in heaven.  My stapling experience had finally paid off, and now I was moving up to a place where people thought for a living.  Imagine that.   Thinking , for a living.  And then you get to tell people what you think, listen to them tell you what they think you think, and have three months off to think about thinking for next year.  With all of that thinking around me, it wouldn't matter that I wasn't faculty, because these easy-going (three months off!), reasonable (thinking, remember, thinking!) people would treat me just the same, honoring my contribution to our collective mission.  In a way I was right.  They do treat me the same as they do their colleagues.  I get the same passive-aggressive emails, the same tantrum phone calls, and the very same evil, posturing lectures.  The corporate law firm that I worked in before this atrophied my soul.  This place tries it's best to downright kill it.    I know I was naive, and I know that I, of all people, should have known better.  Both of my parents were professors here, and though I never knew the exact reason that they both retired early, I certainly can't deny the whiffs of bitterness that came from any conversation relating to their careers.  In the end, they were dinosaurs to their department, adherents to an old cannon that quickly gave way to the Politically Correct nineties.  I mean really, who needs Shakespeare in this day and age anyway?  Just another dead white guy.  But that's not how knowledge is supposed to work, is it?  I always thought it was a process of building on ideas, of adding and enhancing, so that our understanding was richer, more complete.  Instead it seems like a game of proving who is right and who is wrong, then tossing dollar bills to the winner.  Of course, it doesn't help that our dear Governor Dickface has been consistently cutting funds to the University ever since he took office three years ago, so Department Chairs are beginning to resemble a circling pack of starving hyenas.  Now both my husband and I are on tracks that will make us completely unemployable by anyone except the academy, and I'm beginning to come to the realization that I really, really don't want to become these people.  I don't want to sacrifice honesty and friendship for a good wine party quip.  I don't want to spend my life envying my colleague's accomplishments, or catfighting for official praise.  All I can do is hope that maybe there is some place that is not like this.  Maybe somewhere in the Vermont woods, or the Himalayas, there is a group of people who haven't let go of the idea that sometimes being happy is better than being right.

      Admit it, nobody wants to write a boring blog.  Everyone wishes that their life could be fascinating, filled with anecdotes that illustrate the greater philosophy of life while unique in their content, style, and vision.  But anyone who has ever read a blog knows that the majority of them are mundane, self-obsessed ramblings of the socially inept.  I wish I could say that this is going to be one of the good blogs, the kind where I could write about  urlLink pooping  and it would sound like a trancedental epiphany.  But you know I can't promise anything.  I'll tell you this: if you think it's boring, try to think of it as minimalist poetry.  The real meaning is  in between  the words.  There.  Aren't I brilliant?  But I worked too hard to figure out how to make the title light-blue, and the comments say clever things, to spare you from hearing about my uninteresting little life.  You got here somehow.  Blame yourself.  So here are the facts.  At this particular moment, I am twenty-six.  I live in Minneapolis.  I am supposed to be writing my thesis for graduate school, but instead I'm frustratedly typing meanigless text in HTML code (what the fuck does 'href' mean, anyway?).  I'd like to say I'm in graduate school to write the Great American Short Story Collection, but it might just be a front for why I haven't found a real job yet.  I used to work for lawyers, now I work for academics, and I wish I worked for lawyers.  Lawyers yell.  Academics whine.  I'm sure you understand.  I am married and am in the process of buying a house, two things that my eighteen-year-old self would have scoffed at.  Many of my friends are currently having children.  Although I am not quite callous enough to scoff at that, it is something I feel like I can never do for many dark, neurotic reasons.  One of which is that am pathologically shy, which is probably why I started writing a blog, and probably why my posts have a strangely defensive tone.  Does anyone want to say that they are lonely?

      This is my second try at this.  My first attempt failed partly due to laziness, partly due to technical ineptitude, partly due to my horror at realizing that people might actually read it.  So why do it at all?  The same reason people scream in an empty room.  The same reason people have sex in public bathrooms.  The same reason we look away when we want to stare.  Because we all want to be heard, respected, loved.   urlLink Because we are all cowards.

      Today is my birthday.  It is a day that fills me with guilt and pity, because I know that most people don’t have a husband who will get up at seven in the morning just to take them to a birthday breakfast, much less a husband who will covertly buy birthday candles to go into the pancakes.  And they probably wouldn’t be able to eat their pancakes at a place like  urlLink Al’s , where they not only stealthily put candles in the pancakes, but they serve them up singing Happy Birthday loudly and totally off-key.  Lucky for me, though, the guilt and pity seems to be satiated by the searing pain in my back.  With the exception of a couple of carloads of plants, animals, and pocket fluff, we are all moved into our house, including our big, fluffy, wonderful king sized bed.  Unfortunately, or big, fluffy, wonderful king sized bed is sitting in an unassembled pile because the floors weren’t fully cured, so we have been sleeping on a pathetically flat, miniscule queen sized futon on the floor of our apartment for the past two days.  My now twenty-seven-year-old bones already hated me for lugging truckloads of boxes up two flights of stairs, so the futon on the floor has brought on a full-scale revolt.  “Give us back the good bed,” they say, “or the neck goes on strike.”  It’s already reduced its turning radius from a little more than 90 degrees to 45, just to let me know it means business.  And the knees and elbows are creaking in solidarity.  I’m supposed to go clean the apartment after work, but I think I might go to the house and put the bed together instead just to avoid a full-blown joint riot.  I can’t really complain, though, because considering how horrible it usually it, the move went fairly smoothly.  The sofa-bed made it upstairs without seriously injuring anyone, the giant mattress of the big bed practically flew over the second-floor balcony with the help of eight large men, and other than one brief moment when I thought the U-haul was going to take out the tree in our front yard, there was no serious property damage.  There was even leftover beer.  And the house looks amazing.  It’s dirty, it’s dingy, it’s missing gutters, the front yard is covered in weeds—but the feeling of going up  my  stairs to  my  bedroom, throwing a pile of clothes in  my  closet to fester until I get around to putting them in  my  washing machine, is nothing short of brilliant.

      You can never really be sure with Minnesota weather—it tends to suffer from depression and schizophrenia—but for today at least, it is spring.  The birds are chirping, the sky is covered in a comforting blanket of grey, the air is warm and smells of damp earth, new plants, and that eternal scent of life and vibrancy, armpits.  Yes.  Armpits.  As the sap once again begins to flow through the frost-bitten limbs of stoic trees, so the odiferous juices of our bodies begin to seep through our pours, each unique in its own way.  The University campus itself has its own particular flora:  there is the powdery, vaguely sour scent of the academic matriarch; the fierce and stinging astringency of the jock’s Just for Men; the spicy, life-affirming onion smell of the international student; the musky, aged tobacco odor of the tweed-clad professor.  I love it all.  I steal furtive sniffs every time I pass a human being, and once I’ve gotten a whiff I feel that we’ve traded some thing secret and fiercely intimate.  We are bonded for life.  I keep very close track of how every single important person in my life smells.  It is probably the most unforgiving test I have for significant others, ranking way above career status looks, and even personality.  All of those things work in tandem, of course, but one cannot spend the rest of their life with someone who doesn’t smell good in bed on a summer night.  It is simply impossible.  Conversely, my knees buckle every single time I sniff a guy with particularly gifted-sweat glands.  It might sound like a strange turn on, but it is definitely more  urlLink common  than most are willing to admit.  But my affinity with that subtle mix of artificial and natural pheromones goes far beyond the sexual.  I still remember the mellow smell of my best-friend in high school.  I could spend all day snorting the sour milk/pee smell of my two year old nephew.  Hell, sometimes, when I’m all alone, I even sniff myself.    So all I can say is, thank god for spring.  Thank god for open sweaters and sleeveless shirts.  Thank god for moist, warm winds.  Thank god for the pulse of blood in our bodies, and the sultry nectar of a good sweat- the smell as pretty and seductive as every meekly opening spring flower.

      I am sitting at work with the lights off.  For the first time in my working life, have both a door  and  a window in my office, but only the tiniest bit of light manages to squeeze past the hulking neo-Romanesque building across the street, so I’m mainly basking in the healthy glow of the computer screen.  Still, it calms me.  Like when my first grade teacher used to pull the shades and turn out the lights following afternoon recess to lower the spitball-to-air saturation.  My shoulders relax, my lids droop, and I can let the chaos swirl around me without having to join in or stop it.  Now, the things that are chaotic in my life might be utterly mundane to a normal person.  I haven’t killed anyone.  I have no life-threatening diseases.  I haven’t, as of yet, declared bankruptcy.  But I don’t deal well with chaos.  I think it has to do with the fact that I can only keep a certain number of things in my tiny little brain at one time: pay bills, clean bathroom, do taxes.  Then when I have to do other things, like buy a house, or move, or tear up a kitchen into possibly salvageable parts because I idiotically thought it would be a good idea to see if the hard wood underneath was salvageable (it’s not), I kind of flip out and forget to do things like sleep.  In fact, I believe I might be the only single-tasker left in a multi-task world.  I suffer from TMAD, or Too Much Attention Disorder.  I like looking at one thing for long periods of time.  Long novels.  Good paintings.  Opera.  Lord of the Rings.  If I could do math, I probably would have made an excellent accountant.  It means I’m grounded.  I’m focused.  I’m boring.  In fact, if I were independently wealthy, I would probably choose to sit in a chair and read while people brought me sustenance and occasionally carried me to bed after I’ve fallen asleep.  I don’t think it could get any better than that.  Although it probably wouldn’t make a very good reality show.

      I had a dream last night that I got an email telling me "You've had 8,000,000 new hits to your website since you installed SuperTag!"  I don't know what that is, nor if it even exits, but apparently my blog is important enough to my subconscious that I can't just ignore it for a while.  But one thing has become apparent.  This blog cannot be totally anonymous and interesting at the same time.  I've been fairly careful up to this point about mentioning any specifics at all about myself, and the truth is, it's just not as fun partaking in a totally self-absorbed activity without putting some of me in it.  So, for all of you 8,000,000 people who have been waiting with baited breath to find out who, indeed, is the woman behind the curtain, here's a little leg:  1. I live in Minneapolis.  Well, actually I live in St. Paul, and I am utterly devoted to it, but Minneapolis is where we found our house, so I must abandon my lovely, smelly, drunk twin city in shame.  2. I have two cats: a Main Coon who is gigantic and sickly, and a mutt who is small and rock solid.  They are both the most amazing, silly, loyal cats anyone has ever seen.  They even play fetch.  I also have a rabbit, but he spends most of his time pissed off that I exist.  He may look cute, but they he has nasty, pointy teeth.  3. I make a mean cheesecake.  4. My husband is in a  urlLink band .  I guess I've always had a thing for musicians.  5. I have also always had a thing for dorks.  For a while I chased the, roll playing, computer obsessed, slightly socially inept, might have worn funny boots for a  urlLink Shameful Purpose  kind of dork.  I think it is because I am a dork, and I felt I should stick with my own kind.  But one shouldn't have to spend most of their time with their significant other feeling embarrassed for them, so finally I figured out that I actually just wanted an intelligent, big hearted, arty, likes  urlLink cultish British comedy  dork.  Finally, I have found him.  6. When I'm feeling particularly stressed out I like to go to pet stores and look at kittens and fish.  7. Some of my happiest moments have been on a second class Indian train.  8. Jane Austin and Agatha Christie are two of my guiltiest pleasures.  Them, and a good  urlLink Bollywood  flick.  9. I wear black on the outside not because I'm black on the inside, but because I'm really terrible at matching colors.  My guess is that I'm just kind of red and mooshy on the inside.  10. The  urlLink pigeon lady  made me cry.  There.  Now you know me.  Was it good for you?

      Last night while my husband went out to see the third pre-screening of  urlLink Eternal Sunshine  this month, I went with two of my girl friends to have dinner and wine at a moderately yuppie restaurant.  The whole experience was a little strange, mainly because I’ve waitressed at moderately yuppie restaurants and I always hated serving groups of women.  They always ordered the cheapest stuff on the menu, couldn’t hold a drink to save their lives, and they always split the bill so that somehow I ended up getting stiffed on the tip.    Of course we were different.  We ordered the cheapest thing on the menu only because we weren’t very hungry, only ordered one bottle of wine because one of us really doesn’t drink (there was even a debate as to weather it was economically sound to order a bottle, since ordering by the glass would have been a whole three dollars less) and it occurred to me this morning that although I put in a fairly decent tip myself, we didn’t count the total amount, so our waiter probably ended up getting stiffed just because none of us can individually be trusted to correctly do math.    But all of that is beside the point.  What is the point was the discussion over dinner about impossibility of beginning friendships with members of the opposite sex.  One friend was enraged that going out for a beer with a co-worker from the IT department had become a date without her knowledge.  This was a follow up to another casual encounter with a different guy from the IT department which resulted in chocolates and flowers on her desk every day until he finally got sick of her ignoring him.  It may just be guys from IT, but she said the truth is that because her long-time, not-going-anywhere boyfriend lives out of town, she can’t go for a drink with any male without blatantly laying out her relationship status.  Hello.  My name is _____.  I belong to ______.  Shall we have a drink?  We talked for a while about how annoying this was, but mainly we talked about how sickeningly  urlLink unavoidable  it was.  It’s not exactly sexist, because women certainly do it too (a friend of mine was ambushed by a women who invited him over for wine and a movie, and instead sat him in the middle of the floor and lectured him about how she was “sick of playing games”), so my theory was that as people get older and more afraid of dying alone, any appearance of availability must be immediately grasped and throttled into marriage vows.    But it’s not just getting older.  Even when I was in high school and had a plethora of platonic male friends, those male friends inevitably  tried  to date every girl in our circle, they just generally weren’t very successful (in fact, the only guy who didn’t ask me out was the one I had a crush on).  Most of my college guy friends eventually confided to me that the only reason they approached me was because they thought I was cute.  I don’t have much of an opportunity to make male friends outside of my usual circle these days, but the few that I did, briefly, had this strange habit of not speaking to me if my husband was around.    The result of all of this is that I do have male friends, but most of them are really my husband’s friends, or are dating other women friends.  The all-female dinner thing is one of the few social interactions I have separately from my husband.  The other is an all girl book club, and an old pal and I are talking about talking knitting classes when our respective significant others go out of town this spring.  My high school self would have totally shot me by now.  But I am coming to terms with the fact that this is my reality.  I know now that it’s not that I’m necessarily selling out, as much as my perceived freedom when I was younger was really just naiveté.  I know now that a close network of women friends really isn’t all that bad.  In fact, it’s kind of nice getting giddy on a bottle of wine.    Of course, I could still rebel.  I could run away from my husband, live on my wits, ride the rails, sleep with whoever whenever wherever.    But knitting class just seems like so much more fun.

      I think I might be a psychological hypochondraic.  I always seem to be looking for some kind of mental abnormality in myself, and have diagnosed myself with several neurotic problems that no one else seems to think I have.  I suppose it's a good thing, seeing how ready the average psychologist is to prescribe medications that are supposed to make you happy and worry free and otherwise totally blissfull, but it is a little disturbing to realize that the things you think are in your head are, well, all in your head (not to mention it makes for some damnable circular logic).  I think that I can trace pretty easily where my neurosis about finding neuroses comes from.  One reason is that my entire family except for myself has been on some sort of depression or anxiety medication for years.  When I was in fourth grade my teacher recommended I go to a psychologist because, apparently, I wasn't "living up to my potential".  The child psychologist, an awesome high-school drop-out who taught me the  urlLink rubber pencil trick , said that I was perfectly normal, if a little high-strung, and it was the rest of my family who was in need of therapy.  Being the Unmedicated One might be something to be proud of, but it also means that I'm constantly looking over my shoulder for the monster in the closet that will turn me into a drooling lithium addict.  Another reason I am convinced there must be something wrong with me is because of my not-so-mild geekieness.  Of course I have a sense of separation from the rest of society. I read  urlLink comic books , watch pathetic amounts of  urlLink Fawlty Towers , and have never, not once, wanted to meet my co-workers at TGI Friday's for happy hour (though on some maudlin nights I can be seen sipping a Mudslide while I'm reading my comic books).  Because the rest of the world is supposed to be "normal,"  that must mean that I'm "abnormal."  But tell me what is normal about subjecting yourself to burned mozzarella sticks and a bunch of white people chanting "Whoomp, de it is!"  But probably the biggest reason I persist in combing my own mental landscape for abnormalities is because I want to be a genius.  I want to be the person that everybody thinks is on some magnificent, higher plane than anybody else.  But, as everyone knows, it is often the geniuses  urlLink who suffer most .

      If anyone ever asked me what the hardest part of writing my thesis was, I think I'd have to say it's words.  One would think that any person having chosen writing as their preferred profession (preferred is the key word here, unless you are completely devoted to the starving artist mystique), would like words.  Love them, even.  One would think that writers would constantly be talking about words, redefining words, making up completely new words.  I'm sure those writers are out there.  I'm sure that some of them are quite successful, but I'm one of those unlucky saps who loves thinking up stories but can't stand putting them on paper.    Its been the same way for pretty much all of my artistic yearnings.  When I was eight I wanted to be a children's book illustrator.  My mom and dad thought I was pretty good, so in their well meaning, misguided way they signed me up for a summer art class, which would end up turning me off of drawing forever.  The class was taught by a very mean looking woman who in my head is about a hundred years old, but more likely she was just in her late thirties and it was her meanness that transformed her into a decrepit old crone.  She was the kind of teacher would would tell you what she wanted not by actually teaching, but by pointing out how well one child was doing compared to, well, me.  She'd set down object after object in front of me, and doing my very best I could only scribble out vague approximations of flowers and wooden pyramids and bicycles, completely without shading although I added a few arbitrary lines which I thought of as "crosshatching".  Then the six year old in front of me would churn out these perfect sketches, a true replication of whatever 3-D object our teacher was currently torturing us with, complete with adorable perching ladybugs and unicorns frolicking in the background.  And our teacher would say "Isn't she amazing?  Now everyone, you should all be trying to draw like  her ."  Miserable bitch.  But that one experience has become the basic plot for every one of my artistic undertakings.  I played piano, but never quite learned how to read music.  At least not without squinting at the lines and whispering to myself "Every Good Boy...."  I learned how to read music for the trumpet, but never managed to hit the notes well enough to get into the youth symphony.  I started writing poetry in the fourth grade that got published in the school newsletter, but strangely enough people aren't that impressed that I can still write fourth grade level poetry.  And now there is my fiction career, which impresses several people, all of whom have absolutely nothing to do with the publishing industry or academia.  It's because of the damn words.  So I'm sitting here writing on my blog, because words matter less when you're just flinging them into the internetic ether (oooo...new word) as opposed to searing them onto paper to be read and laughed at by the editors of urlLink  mcsweeney's  .  Here, I can say anything I want, and my non-readers will simply accept it, and go on with their lives, perhaps slightly scarred.

      So we're buying a house.  It's something that most people do at some point in their lives.  In fact, at this particular point in my life it seems like just about everyone is buying a house, so not wanting to stir the pot, we thought we'd buy one too.  Of course, we went about it in the most methodical, cautious, and sane way possible.  Which is to say we poked around on the internet for about a week, drove past about five houses and looked at two, the second one of which we bought without ever having hired a realtor.  Now that the tornado of paperwork has cleared and we're in debt for the rest of our lives, we're beginning to realize that our house is a fixer-upper, and we, well, we don't actually know how to  fix  anything.  Isn't that fun?  At least my mother has been supportive.  When I told her that we bought a house she said, "That's great, but what are you going to do when the housing market collapses next year?"  We've taken to driving by the house every day at least once while our financer and realtor armwrestle for the final purchace agreement.  I think my husband does it because he enjoys it.  He imagines us getting old there, raising many generations of cats, planting tulips.  I do it because every time we go past I see one more thing that is terribly, terribly wrong, and so my sense of overwhelming dread is justified.  The windows need to be fixed.  The outside stucco needs to be fixed.  It's in a neighborhood with three apartment buildings and a block away from the railroad tracks.  There is a giant hole in the front yard.  The garage is about to fall over.  The gutters need to be replaced.  On and on the list goes, until my mental picture is not that I'm moving into a house, but a giant, money-sucking hole in the ground with little more to protect me from the elements than a plywood roof and a clothes line.  At least one thing I do know how to fix is a good, stiff drink.

      My entire life I've been more of the enraged armchair type of liberal, ranting to people who agreed with me because I couldn't find the facts to back up my beliefs when people didn't.  I mean, we're the good guys, aren't we?  Isn't that enough?  Who could possibly disagree with peace, love, and understanding?  Maybe I found myself more involved this year because of the sneaking suspicion that I wasn't as informed as I should have been.  Maybe it was one last stab at winning an argument.  But, of course, I  urlLink  lost .  urlLink Twice .  But it certainly wasn't for any lack of action, as ineffectual as that action may have been.  I was in Iowa in December, my feet blocks of ice, wandering around some po-dunk town scared out of my wits that I would find myself face-to-face with a shot gun or dog-faced inbred, or a dog-faced inbred with a shotgun.  It doesn't help that I sound like a complete idiot even talking to strangers I might have something in common with other than a democratic voting history, but my idea of canvassing was sad indeed.    Knock knock. "What." "Hi!  Have you thought about who you'd like to vote for in the democratic primaries next month?" "No." "Great!  Have a sticker!  Bye!" Run away as fast as possible before the shotgun comes out.  The best part of the whole trip was eating cheese fries in a bar with deer antlers as light fixtures.  And ranting to people who agreed with me.  Strangely, Dean didn't win Iowa.  But I didn't give up entirely.  Tonight I went to the DFL caucus to throw in my two cents, maybe try to keep a little argumentativeness in the race before the Kerry machine took over.  But instead of the good-humored pep rally I was expecting, it was more like a Sonic Youth concert with yuppies.  Self-righteous, ill-humored yuppies at that.  I probably would have felt more comfortable had there been a dog-faced inbred or two.  Half the people were complaining they didn't know what to do, and the other half was complaining that they had to tell everyone what to do.  The few times I actually got to speak to anyone they assumed I didn't know what I was doing even before I opened my mouth, which I guess is a hazard of looking young and lost.  But the end result is that I wasn't able to hear a single word anyone was saying, and I left early having very little confidence that my little scrap of paper would be counted with all of the other scraps of paper being jammed into envelopes that obviously weren't intended to hold that many scraps of paper.  The truth of the matter is that figuring out what's really going on, at least enough to make any sort of difference, just takes way more time than the average working graduate student has.  I admit freely that half the reason I was voting for Edwards was because I knew Kerry would win.  And he was kind of cute, in his way.  These people argue for a living, and sometimes finding the truth in what they say is like picking nose-hairs from an ornery rhinoceros--you know it's there, but you're not about to risk your life trying to find it.  Now I'm back in my armchair, ranting to myself.  At least it's a pretty comfortable chair.

      I love those Spring days when the air feels like it does that time you did everything you ever wanted your hair flying carried by the April wind your knees stuck out sideways on a red bicycle bruises on your ankles and chocolate ice cream on your face and your eyes burning forward your legs pumping your heart pounding throwing yourself towards tomorrow like the world is going to catch you and carry you and hold you up forever you've had some scrapes but nothing could ever burn the meat of your heart away and today is one of those days with a grey sky hanging over but my blue eyes burn blue into the cieling and my red cheeks are lighting red-light districts on the  cold empty avenue and my knees are still awkward flinging out a leg to catch the pavement just as I fall and fall and fall and my hands deep in my pockets reaching for smooth pebbles magic charms that carry that old burning heart that I turned into stone for safe keeping when the world had to stop carrying me in its big tired arms.

      I would like to apologize, my dear, three readers.  I realize I'm not off to a great start with this blogging thing, what with my only major posts describing armpits, my teeth, and people dying of cancer.  "And what's with these one line posts that are just links to someone else's blog?" you may say.  "If I wanted to read their blog, wouldn't I just go there in the first place?"  Yes.  You probably would.  Which is why I won't do it anymore.  After  urlLink this one .  I swear.  Really.  I do.

      After reading  urlLink this post , I started thinking about my own strange relationship with death.  My aunt and grandmother both died several thousands of miles away from me, and I never went to their funerals.  Though I was sad that I would never see them again, I honestly didn’t know them very well.  I still have vivid memories of summers spent at their houses, and that has always been enough.  For me, they were people close to my father, and most of the pain I felt from their deaths was seeing him so heartbroken.    When an acquaintance from high school committed suicide, at first I felt an overwhelming shock.  There is something desperate and broken about the idea of an eighteen-year-old boy ending his own life.  But on a more personal level, it was again an empathic sort of grief.  He had been very close to one of my best friends, and I felt that I was only sharing something that really belonged to her.  I could let it go at will, detach myself from it as being a horrible event in someone else’s life.  I think that the first time I really understood grief, the time it was so gigantic and overwhelming that I felt I couldn’t control when it came or went, I couldn’t—and still can’t—even see a way around it, was last summer when my husband and I watched his father die of cancer.    When we first got to Madison, he was still very much the same person.  Obsessively selfless, determined, dryly witty.  Although he was sick, he still worried about being the good host.  He even threw one of his famous backyard picnics, where there was too much beer, too much food and all of the children were so high on sugar they couldn’t remember how to walk.  He made a speech, thanking the caregivers of his elderly mother, and I know for certain it was the speech that made people cry, not the fact that he was so obviously ill.    But it  was  obvious.  He was in pain.  He was tired.  For hours at a time, the light in his eyes would grow dim and vague.  He wouldn’t be ready with a joke, he would just have to sit there concentrating on breathing.  I don’t remember how long it was we stayed.  It didn’t really matter.  Our only purpose was to try and make things easier.  In truth, we were probably trying to make the things that were happening not happen.  Even when the hospice people arrived--and this must have been a week or so before his death--we were still discussing ways that we could help him get better.  They knew they were there just to make him as comfortable as possible in the last days of his life.  We were still fighting our own battle against facing this horrible, inevitable thing.  We saw our hope dwindle until it turned on us into a fierce desperation, and then, finally, we began the completely unmanageable task of acceptance.  And I found out that accepting death, when it is right there in front of you, is like trying to eat the universe.  It is completely impossible and yet you can’t ignore it, because it is everywhere.  I still watch my husband struggling with it, and I know there are whole days that are lost to him,  because he is staring at the world through this immeasurable haze.  A year later, my own grief is like a giant monster in a closet.  Whenever it’s let out it seems terrible and uncontrollable, but eventually it goes skulking back to where it lives and closes the door.  I know that as the years go by, it will get smaller.  Maybe someday it will disappear.  But the closet will remain, and it will always remind me what was there.  I am hoping that as time goes on, rather than a hole left by a death, I will remember the space filled with the immense spirit of the man that lived.

      Stiff again.  I probably did more yard work yesterday than I have done in nearly a decade, simply because it is the first time in that long that I have had a yard.  As I raked and dug and poked, working up some respectable blisters, I realized something completely unexpected: I was actually enjoying myself.    I don't know how it happened, but I loved the smell of dirt.  I loved that I was breaking a sweat.  I loved working in the afternoon sunlight filtering through the leaves of our apple tree.  I felt rugged and satisfied.  I felt empowered.  I felt happier and more at peace than I have in months.  It just crept up on me.  After all of my complaining that I would never be able to tell a weed from a flower, I found myself unable to sleep last night as I mapped out the raised beds where I’m going to plant all of my hostas.  Maybe a year or two down the road, I plant a dogwood tree.  And some yaro.  And lots of daylilies.  Today I have been forced to admit that I may wish I was punk rock, but yesterday was proof that I am just a hippy offspring trying to contort myself into an urbane pose.  I like camping.  I like growing things.  I like eating food that’s good for me, and mornings when I wake up early and I’m not too hung-over to enjoy the sunrise.  I like—dare I admit it?—world music.  There, I’ve done it.  I’ve completely lost my edge.  Now you know that all of my angst is really just a put-on to hide the granola sentimentality beneath.  Here is some  urlLink surrealist Japanese Shockwave animation  to distract you from your disappointment.

      Behold!  A brand spanking new site design to celebrate my first attempt at weeding my front yard.  I needed some kind of bolstering, because my weeds aren’t your normal, tip-toe in the tulips kinds of weeds.  These are giant, monstrous, well rooted weeds.  Yup, I think I can say these weeds are more intimidating than a hip young college professor or that girl in sixth grade who was prettier, smarter,  and  nicer than you.    I’m also a little reluctant because I don’t actually have any grass in my front yard, so the weeds are really the only greenery represented.  The rest is just dirt and old leaves that were never raked up last winter.  But due to the fact that those weeds have doubled in size since the rain Sunday night, and I’m beginning to get slit-eyed looks from my neighbors, I should probably just buck up and dig in.  I was very disappointed to learn that there was no Super Weeder machine available at Home Depot.  I was looking for something big.  Destructive.  Preferably with a seat and a motor so I could drive it home at 10 mph.  But nothing of the sort.  When I typed “weed” into the Home Depot website it just came up with the usual nasty chemicals and twenty dollar spades.  I will be a little sad to see them go, those weeds.  Since I have never had a garden in all my adult life, and my own parents were of the “crabgrass counts as lawn” school, I wasn’t entirely sure if those green little furls were weeds or not, and so I was pretty excited to see what they would become.  In fact, even if they just became a carpet of dandelions, that wouldn’t have been so bad.  I’ve always loved that blanket of yellow on the highway.  And whose childhood would be complete without a June afternoon spent lying on your back, dirty toes dug into the earth, grass-stained knees pointed at the sky, filling the horizon with those white umbrella wishes?

      Five reasons my Asian-made ramen noodles are so much cooler than the ones you bought at Cub.  1.  Mine comes with not one, but THREE flavor packets per noodle package, including suspiciously red oil substance.  2.   My ingredients are written in Japanese.  Who really wants to know how much MSG they’re consuming, anyway?  3.  Yours has a picture of noodles and peas.  Mine has a picture of a cartoon kung-fu master.  4.  Yours is $.25 for a package.  Mine is $.25 for a case.  5.  Yours comes in Pork, Chicken, Beef, Shrimp and Mushroom.  Mine comes in Pork, Chicken, Beef, Shrimp, Tom-Yum, Miso and Fish-ball.  Boo ya.

      I am totally supposed to be at work right now.  But the fact that my husband just left to go on tour with his band, which is really depressing, and the fact that it is seventy degrees outside, which makes me feel a little bit better, along with the fact that my boss just went out of town today, which is really too convenient, means that instead of being in my little stuffy office looking for  urlLink work-appropriate-porn , I am sitting on my front porch, drinking a beer, and soaking up the good vibes created by being an unproductive member of society.  Hallelujah.  But I did promise the blank Internet world the rest of my dentist story, and although I may cheat the University of Minnesota out of some butt-spreading time, I will not cheat my three readers out of a story about my teeth.  Well, actually, I won’t really get into my teeth, since what really matters here is the dentist.  So we’ll skip ahead right past the Ghetto Dentist Who Didn’t Have Time for a Root Canal, and the Emergency Dentist Who Caused Further Emotional Trauma, to the moment I showed up in the chair of M.J., Senior Dentistry Student, with a hollow tooth, an abscess, and two enormous cavities.  M.J., how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.  1. Calls filling a cavity “Fucking around in your tooth” 2. When he hears I haven’t ever seen “The Apprentice,” he describes the show to me in detail, along with Trump’s infamous snakebite hand gestures, and how sad he was when the guy from Kansas didn’t win. 3. His latex gloves smell like swimming pools 4. Tells me to close my eyes before taking out the giant Novocain needle 5. Tells me I’m “awesome” as I sit in the chair drooling on myself. 6. Greets me every morning will a little dance and a “Hey, howya doin’?” 7. Spends half an hour carving away at the metal in my mouth because “I want all of your future dentists to say that this is a damn good filling.”  8. Holds my face whenever I start wincing 9. “Do you have to answer phones at work?  You might sound a little funny, but with any luck they’ll just think you’re drunk.” 10. Tells me stories about his wife and cats while pulling bloody pieces of cotton out of my mouth  I’m still no fan of drills and x-rays and giant steel girder needles, but I can say that every day I have to go see M.J. I have a little spring in my step.  Dare I say, I even think that going to the dentist regularly is a good thing, and I very well might do it, twice a year, maybe even three times.  Sadly, my days with M.J. are numbered.  In fact, that number is one.  One more appointment to get my root-canal cap before he heads off to an internship at the VA hospital.  But he has changed my life.  Because of him, I no longer shudder at the idea of going to the dentist before I am reduced to an Advil popping, whimpering idiot.    Take heart, dentist weary readers.  I have seen the future.  And it loves reality TV.

      I never used to have problems with dentists.  In fact, I even think that I liked going.  After a few minutes of getting minty sand rubbed on my teeth, a vigorous flossing and a pat on the back, I got a brand new toothbrush just for showing up, and a lollipop for not having any cavities (presumably to drum up more business).  My sister, who had been introduced to the dark side of dentistry at an early age, sulked knowingly in the waiting room, but I was fearless in my innocence.  These dentists got a bad rap.  They were nice enough fellas.  Of course, all of this changed the summer before my sophomore year in high school.  My usual scrub was interrupted by a long and arduous series of x-rays, which always made me kind of nervous anyway, because while you’re sitting there with a little lead blankey, everyone else  leaves the room .  Then while I innocently stared at pictures of puppies and tulips on the wall The Dentists discussed excitedly in another room that they’d finally get something bigger on my bill than sealants and fluoride treatments.  They came in with serious faces and glee in their eyes, and notified me that my jaw was too small to accommodate my incoming wisdom teeth.  They were growing in sideways.  They had to be removed.  Just a small procedure.  Nothing to worry about at all.  Almost everyone has had their wisdom teeth out, and a few of you, my dear non-readers, may be rolling your eyes thinking, “What’s the big deal?  I had to sleep in a chair for two hours and then got a free vacation on Percocet beach.  It was almost fun.”  Well, my dentist, either to cut down on overhead or just out of plain malice, decided that for my wisdom teeth OPERATION (there were big knives involved, and anything involving big knives is definitely an operation) all they needed to give me was a little extra dose of Novocain.  No general anesthetic.  No valium.   Not a puff of nitrous in sight.  Just plain old run of the mill Novocain, so I witnessed the whole scary thing in terrifying, lucid detail.  I'll spare you the bloody, drooling details, but after it was all over my mother brought me home and I lay curled in a quivering, cotton-stuffed ball on my bed waiting for her to fill my painkiller prescription.  At this point my cheeks were beginning to bruise and swell.  My mouth was throbbing.  This was the worst pain I’d ever felt in all my tender years, but I thought as soon as mom came home with the drugs I’d be okay.  All I had to do was wait it out, and soon I’d painless and high as a kite, and it would all be completely legal.    Now, I may have been one of those annoying high-on-life kids when I was sixteen, but even I knew that the Tylenol 3 my mother came home with was only slightly less effective as a painkiller than Nyquil.  The dentist might as well have prescribed two aspirin and a bottle of brandy for all the good it did me, and for the next three days I sat staring at the television watching soap operas and game shows, a straw between my puffed lips, afraid to move because changing the channel might make it hurt more.    The next week a friend of mine came over to watch movies, feed me milkshakes and laugh at my grossly swollen cheeks.  After about two weeks I started going out in public again, even though I looked like a Cabbage Patch Kid for a solid month.  When I went back to the dentist six weeks later to get the stitches pulled out of my gums (see? OPERATION), I still tried to be a good sport.  I sat in the chair bravely, not even wincing when they reached into my mouth with a pair of shiny, pointy scissors.  Then, as soon as I started to walk back to the reception desk, I collapsed onto the floor in a dead faint.  While I was out, voices came to me from the darkness:  dentists are evil and will try to hurt you.  Never ever go to the dentist again .  And for about six years, I didn’t.   Stay tuned for Part Two: Love in the Time of Dentistry

      I urge everyone to support  urlLink this cause .  Of the three candidate states, I think Alabama is probably the most logical choice, as I have never had the desire to spend absolutely any time in it, or any of the states it boarders.  South Carolina is out of the question, since I've heard it has a nice beach.  Mississippi is a second choice, but even that might be a littl risky since it is close to New Orleans, and I fear that may result in contamination of the pure hedonism I hold dear.  I urge everyone to contribute all of their support, prayers, money, and redneck family members.  The plan may be aborted if they receive fewer than 50,000 participants (is that a biblical number, I wonder?) so keep a sharp lookout!  Immediately refer anyone showing two or more of the symptoms below:  1) Recent conversion to any Christian fundamentalist religion (if person has selected "Missouri Synod" as thier prefferd denomination, this is the only symptom required for participation in the exodus).  2) Has uttered the statement "would you like some of my freedom fries?" without irony.  3) Is outraged at the outrage  4) Listens to Toby Keith  5) Has considered voting for GW in '04.  Remeber, it's for the good of your country!

      I usually get into my office about five to ten minutes late, open the window because my radiator was made in purgatory, and turn on my computer.  While I’m waiting for it to warm up, I usually find a nasty post-it note from my boss sitting on my chair telling me to do something I was supposed to do yesterday.  This is generally supplemented by a telephone message telling me the same thing.  Once the computer is on I look through the various proposals from Nigeria for VERY SPECIAL OPPORTUNIES, and respond in haiku.  I shall not be fooled By crooked politicians Who can’t turn off caps.   urlLink Then   urlLink I   urlLink stalk   urlLink my   urlLink friends   urlLink for   urlLink a   urlLink while .  Eventually, my boss walks into the office.  He always has change in his pockets, so I have time to get any nudity off the computer screen before he walks through the door.  While he makes photocopies he again asks me if I’ve done the thing I was supposed to do yesterday, and I tell him that I was just finishing up with it, when in actuality I forgot about it the moment I deleted his phone message.  Then I do my “filing”, which really means that I shuffle papers around the office until he leaves.  Once he does leave, I go to lunch an hour early, and generally come back about half an hour late.  After lunch I usually do some  urlLink important   urlLink work .  Then I go to  urlLink Metafilter  to find  urlLink more   urlLink important   urlLink work  to do.  After that, I start typing people’s names into Google, including--at least twice a day--my own.  As the day is winding down, I usually go into my private bathroom and take a nap.  Then I stalk my friends some more in case they updated their blogs over lunch, and leave ten minutes early.  I just got a raise.  Thank goodness for government jobs.

      Last night I was really going to work.  I had done the laundry, eaten brunch with my mother and bought ingredients for dinner.  All I had to do was sit down and let the prose spew forth like a fountain from the mouth of a partied-out frat boy.  But then the sky started to turn green, and as any good Midwesterner knows, when the sky turns green you can’t write theses, you have to stand in your driveway and stare at it until you get sucked up by a tornado.  Okay, so we didn’t get sucked up by a tornado (which is really too bad, since it would have been a great story) because aside from the sky being a really scary green, it started to rain, so we retreated into the safety of our living room for a Midwesterner’s favorite pastime, watching severe weather reports.  Believe me, we live for this shit.  The computer graphics on the TV were getting good and red right above our neighborhood around the time we noticed that the rain was coming down sideways.  As we grabbed our various four-legged creatures to take them into the basement, disembodied tree branches started blowing down the street.  We stayed down there for about half an hour, sitting in sawdust, too giddy to be scared.  Gabe made up songs on his guitar about our roof blowing away.  Things seemed to be fairly intact when we emerged, which was a little bit disappointing, since I’ve never had the opportunity to go to Oz and it would be a great excuse for not having my thesis done on time, but I did get a chance to stand in my driveway and watch the sky turn from scary green to eerie yellow, and apparently not too far from our house a bunch of  urlLink trees  were uprooted.    I never did get back to working on my thesis, but what could I do?  It was the will of god.

      Well, it’s over.  Just like that.  We didn’t hug.  We didn’t make any promises to see one another again, promises we knew we couldn’t keep.  We said our goodbyes, dry eyed and without drama, as if it didn’t matter.  As if there had never been anything between us.  As if I was just another dental patient.  It may seem silly, but I was a little bit surprised that after all we’ve been through together—the eighteen x-rays, the abscess, the botched root canal, the two huge cavities threatening to overtake the tender pulp—that there wasn’t a little bit more to our farewell.  At least a pat on the shoulder and a “See you around, kiddo.”  But I suppose the operative dentistry waiting room isn’t the place for pathos, and seeing MJ so blithe, all I could do was eek out a timid “Congratulations on finishing dental school!”  He laughed, looked a little confused, and walked away.  There was a moment as I sat in the chair waiting for the instructor’s OK on my Mesial Distal when he started to say, “You know, you are…” and I thought he would say  …my best, sweetest patient.  I’ll always remember the day you walked in with your gums full of bacteria and a look of terror on your face.   But all he said was “…my very last case.”  Luckily, because my mouth was stuck open with two vacuum tubes and various sharp metal things sticking out of it, he probably didn’t register my look of disappointment.  I left feeling just the slightest bit used.  Was I just an interesting case?  A smorgasbord of textbook problems?  Another mouth on which to practice direct pulp capping with adhesive resins?  But it was not a total loss.  The dental assistant did compliment me on the productivity of my saliva glands.  And MJ did massage my jaw when I said that it was beginning to get stiff (which actually sounded more like “Aaaw!  Aaaw!”).     And I did get my last filling for free.

      Okay.  So I ditched my carefully thought-out, slaved-over, home-grown template for a generic blogger one.  Even, perhaps, the most generic of the generic blogger templates.  But let's face it, it is time for me to realize that when I try to go too crazy with these things, they just end up looking crappy, mainly because I have no idea what I'm doing.  I may yet make a few modifications (I have to get my links back, and for some reason the side bar keeps getting shoved way down to the bottom of the page), but first I've got to squirrel myself away with a good book on CSS and some expensive graphics software so that I can get my site to look like  urlLink this .  Then I can take over the world.

      Oh,  urlLink Christopher .  I can’t tell you how many nights I’ve dreamt of getting inside that cavernous brain of yours, able to access that cathedral of thoughts.  How I’ve wished to sit across a table from you at some dark D.C. bar, buying you drinks at four in the morning, lighting your endless chain of cigarettes, memorized by the complex weaving of your hands and ideas.  I have been your admirer, your defender, your most devoted sycophant.  You are probably the coolest man in the world, and you know it.  You’re not the rumpled, cobweb encrusted leftist academic, mumbling in whiney, humanitarian terms smelling slightly of must and mold.  You are not the flakey hippie of tie-dye, group hugs and passive aggressive soy-based activism.  No, you are a true revolutionary.  A  urlLink firebrand .  A  urlLink revealer  of  urlLink villains .  You know the world is dirty and you’re here to let everyone know it.  You sit there at your typewriter and turn your syntax into bullets.  You’re fighting the good fight.  And you won’t let anybody— anybody —derail your mission.  Even if they happen to be right.  Or shall I say,  urlLink left .  None of us are perfect.   One of the things I love about you is the fact that you refuse to bow down to the sacred cows of your movement.  You can point out the chinks in our armor.  Our ideas must adapt in your hostile environment to be richer, more thought out.  If you don’t kill us, you’ll make us stronger.  Michael Moore is not perfect.  In a hailstorm of right-wing, FOX news propaganda, he very well may just be another mudslinger who happens to be on our side.  I’m sure that Moore’s new documentary is as skillfully  urlLink rigged  as all his others.  You’ve got to hand it to him, the man has a flair for drama, and nothing’s going to stop him from using it.  He’s already made up his mind on the issue.  He is looking for impact, and whether or not it’s unadulterated truth seems secondary.  But, dear Chris, there is a difference between criticism and  urlLink fanatical   urlLink bludgeoning , and I fear that in the last few years you have crossed that line.  Maybe you were truly, mentally scarred by the events of 9/11, and knowing that there were people out there who wanted to kill you tipped you a little off your rocker.  Maybe you’ve been seduced by the idea of the revolution against Saddam Hussein, despite the words of your own beloved  urlLink Orwell .  Or maybe, and I truly hope this is not the case, you’re just in love with your own  urlLink voice .  Let Moore have his film.  At best, it will mean the removal of a leader we can all agree is a dangerous idiot, and at worst it means the left will have to re-establish its deserved credibility.  At least these are costs we can all  urlLink live  with.

      I think that these last few days have been my first official summer weekend.  Long sunlit hours spent stretched out under the sky, without a moment’s worth of worry about laundry or schoolwork or leaking sinks.  I didn’t spend a single second vegetating in front of the television, throwing things at the local news casters, or huddled in a dark movie theater wasting perfectly good matinee weather.    I did, however, score some free tickets to a lovely  urlLink garden party  where I shook my booty to an afro-beat and re-lived the best moments of 1982.  The next morning I stretched my limbs and sauntered to an awesome vegan  urlLink breakfast  and a stiff bloody that left me pleasantly fuzzy for the whole afternoon. Then some friends came over and we watched some heated pick-up soccer, took an informal tour of our neighborhood gardens, and explored the fabulous white, graffitied wilderness that is BUNGE (I’m sorry I can’t include an explanatory link here—a bit of local privilege, I guess).  Then we spent a luxurious amount of time watching dusk fall  urlLink and   urlLink listening   urlLink to   urlLink music  on the porch.  Sunday was the only day of small tragedies, because we went to the  urlLink Animal Humane Society  and met a puppy we couldn’t leave behind, and then we had to leave her behind (some good person with a nice big yard and a bit of disposable income should go there and ask for a girl named Greta).  Then my Great Kite Flying Experiment ended with me breathless, pouting and empty handed, while a tree expertly maneuvered a very nice kite.  As of 10:00 last night it was still fluttering over 15th Avenue.  I cheered up a little, though, after a cat nap complete with cuddling cats, a large, home cooked meal and a Fucking Klutz (half  urlLink Pom , half really good tequila, and fresh lime juice).   It all made getting out of bed a little difficult this morning, but at least I woke up to a sun streaked sky, and I found this picture when I typed “tiger” into Google.

      I know I’m supposed to be posting about smoldering relationships between mother and daughter and the universalities found therein, but with my health as it is I don’t really feel like doing much of anything.  Particularly anything that involves a lot of thinking.  Although I feel physically awful, I feel strangely secure and comfortable when I’m sick.  I sort of retreat into my own snotty mental landscape--a world of chicken soup and orange juice and watching soap operas because they’re the only thing on TV at two in the afternoon.  Perhaps it is a defense mechanism.  To insulate my system from further shock my brain wraps me in a nice, mucous-y blanket of willful ignorance.  The power of these regressions is especially noticeable in summer.  While I was growing up I would usually get sick in November, so I wake up in the morning, stuffed up and crusty-eyed, and expect to see the leaves changed.  I even think I smell the soft damp of decomposing leaves and the inexplicably lovely perfume of wood smoke.  But instead everything is green.  The air is hot and slightly humid.  There isn’t a trace of crisp autumn wind to be found.  The result is that the gap between what I’m thinking about and what is actually happening around me gets even broader.  It’s a miracle I can find my way to work at all.  Especially without personal injury.  No matter.  I will return to real life soon enough.  But for now I’m going to snuggle a little deeper into the bunk bed in my head, and ride the socially sanctioned wave of my antihistamine high.  And for your entertainment, some  urlLink thoughts  on why everyone should be vegetarian.

      This morning my parents left for home after house sitting for some friends in town for three months.  This was the first time I have lived within two hundred miles of my parents since I left for collage, and the first time I have lived within 1,200 miles since they sold my childhood home in Minneapolis and moved out to Montana.  I had been particularly  urlLink nervous  about this, since I attributed our current functional relationship on the fact that I was far from home and financially independent.  But what I hadn't counted on during this extended stay was that I would finally get to know my parents as people, completely outside their rolls of authority, and that they were extraordinarily good people at that.  At last.  Though I remember my childhood as being fairly comfortable, my older sister developed a particularly volatile relationship with my mother when she was a teenager.  When I was in the fourth grade, I remember lying in my bed at five in the morning listening to them scream at each other in the kitchen below before my sister went to school.  I would stretch my body out stiff as a board, and squinch my eyes tight together, wishing that they were happy again.  Occasionally I would hop downstairs, hoping that I could keep them from fighting just by talking about something cheerful and inane about my school, but I think that just succeeded in annoying them both further.  Sister [glaring over her oatmeal]: "What are you doing?"  Me [said through the grin plastered to my face]:  "I want to get up too!"  Sister: "Why?  This is my time with mom."  Me [grin slightly fading]:  "Mom?  Is it okay if I have breakfast now too?"  Mom [at the stove stirring something that doesn't need to be stirred anymore]: "Maybe you should go to bed, dear."  So that was the end of that.  My mom and dad would have discussions about what to do with my sister, and it always ended up in a screaming match about who was forcing whom to be the disciplinarian.  So my sister was yelling at my mother who was yelling at my father who would sit in the dark in the living room drinking beer and listening to opera.  I was always kind of a freaky perfectionist kid, but because I believed that this turmoil was due to the fact that my sister was a bad girl (she really wasn't), I decided that the only way to resolve the situation was if I were to be extra good.  Everybody was really happy when I won that fairy-tale series for scholastic achievement in the third grade.  Why not win a collage scholarship in the fourth?  It didn't really work out so well.  It was the year of speed math tests, and since I was trying to answer everything perfectly, I never finished a single test.  Because I read so slowly, trying to get every word correct, I was taken out of the gifted reading class.  When I wrote a poem for the school newsletter, my teacher lectured all of the other students in the class on how they should try to be more creative, like me.  Therefore my reputation turned quickly from "nice girl" to "stuck up prissy bitch".  Finally, after my grades had plummeted and I cried openly in class about twelve times, the school referred me to a family  urlLink psychologist .  I was pronounced okay, and the rest of my family was put on happy drugs.  They had all been suffering from depression.  The drugs would solve all that, and we could finally be a normal, happy family again.    At first it really seemed to work.  The relationship between my sister and mother got noticeably better, and because of that my mother and father stopped yelling at each other so much.  When she moved out of the house a couple of years later, they went out every week for brunch just to talk, and I thought: Finally.  It's going to be okay.  My sister is out of the house and the only one left is me.  Smooth sailing.  After all, I'm the good kid.  Right? Next post:  The High School Years , or,  More Reasons Why Teenagers Suck

      Well, the party was mainly a success.  We didn’t manage to finish the keg, but there was also no nakedness (although I do find myself secretly disappointed, like maybe our party wasn’t worthy of nakedness).  Nothing and no one got broken, and even people from completely different arms of our social circle seemed to get along and make new friends, which makes me feel all warm and fuzzy.  Unfortunately, staying up way too late means my body is quickly being overtaken by a horrific cold, so I also feel kind of achy and foggy.  I am currently in that sick limbo where I feel completely fatigued and crappy, but I don’t sound bad enough to call in sick to work.  But it's not too bad since my job consists of sitting in a chair and staring at a computer screen, which is probably what I would be doing if I were at home anyway.  Life in the fast lane won’t allow me much repose, though, because this evening I have yet another raucous party to attend.  There will most definately be nakedness at this one, but instead of a big hairy drunken man, it will be in the form of my over-stimulated three year old nephew.  I bought him a dump truck and shovels in bright, primary plastic, because he loves to make volcanoes in the sand.    Three years ago today he was born in the Fairview hospital, during a terrible summer rainstorm, about three months early.  We rushed over as soon as we got the call despite the green sky and rain.  I still vividly remember standing in the ICU, wet and shell shocked, offering bleary congratulations to my freaked out brother-in-law.  I remember watching this little thing no bigger than my forearm reaching towards me with tiny fingers, while my sister, feet still numb, giggled and cried simultaneously.  I had absolutely no idea what was going on—just a vague astonishment that this was a brand new person, slightly red and wrinkled.    Now he’s waist high.  He knows all his colors, how to count to five, and that farts are really funny.  He’s sweet and naughty and has the most amazing blue eyes.  He likes to run fast, tickle people and play with things he thinks are gross.  Everyone has their opinions, but I think he’s going to grow up to be a famous writer.  Happy birthday, Rory.

      Woe be to those who do not think “soup” and “party” should be used in the same sentence.  There were buffaloes and time bombs and cheesy Italians.  There was fondling and cabbage and a general consensus that the 90’s sucked.  I tell you, these soup party things are going to become the new raves as soon as everyone finds out how fun it is to be in a room fool of people with warm, full bellies.  And research shows overuse of soup will not create holes in your brain.  Gabe and I are throwing our very first ever major party in our new house on Saturday, and I think I am the only person in the world who wakes up at three in the morning worrying about a party.  What if there’s a huge mess?  What if we’re too loud and our neighbors call the cops?  What somebody gets naked?  I don’t know what to do with nakedness!  I am  not  a  fan  of  nakedness!     Have I succeeded in establishing my complete and utter lameness?  It just furthers the point that I have to consider this party a breaking point in the way I think about homeownership.  I have been worrying about this place ever since I made the phone call to the realtor.  So much so that I haven't really had a chance to enjoy living in it.  I feel like I've been working constantly and the work will never be done.  As that may be so, why not enjoy working?  I get to tear up the tile in my kitchen just because I don't like the color.  I get to drill holes in my ceiling and play with electrical wires.  Best of all, I get to be reunited with a toy I haven't seen since my days as a tech theater dork: the random orbit sander.  So some stuff needs to be fixed.  It’ll be fixed.  So some things need to be cleaned.  They’ll get clean and then they’ll probably get dirty again.  So a naked guy just ran through my living room.  At least we’re all having a good time.

      I love the Midwest.  Folks say we’re provincial.  That we don’t know what’s going on in the world around us.  They think we’re unfashionable and quaint.  They think that Garrison Keillor is our cultural ambassador and that we’re all Scandinavian and go ice-fishing.    Of course, all of that is pretty much true.  No one is likely to move to Minnesota to make it big, unless they're stopping off at a certain  urlLink rehab  facility first.    Midwesterners don’t know the latest fashion.  We draw on our t-shirts with magic marker and wear the same pair of pants three days in a row.  We’ve probable never heard of the latest Southern California pop-punk band.  We huddle in smoky little holes listening to a couple of kids from  urlLink Moose Lake  play their Mexican made Stratocasters with toothpicks.  We’ve never gotten used to celebrity.  Every person over thirty five says they drank with the Replacements, and I don’t care how punk-rock the kids look at your party—they’ll still kick your ass if you try to diss Prince.  We’ve got about four weeks of good weather in the entire year, and the rest of the time we’re stuck in our houses trying to get away from the bitterly cold winter or the sticky, humid summer.  Sometimes we get sick of it and break out the grill in February, but most of the time we just have to find something amuse ourselves.  We battle our cabin fever by  urlLink writing , or  urlLink playing music , or shooting at things until they’re  urlLink art .  It’s not because we dream of being famous.  We’re not trying to develop the latest style.  We just need something to do.  We’ve got some of the biggest aw-shucks-smiles you’ve ever seen.  Our assholes are your saints.  We visit our grandmother on her birthday.  We keep up with all our friends.  Sure, we visit the coast.  We know it’s important for what it does—whatever it does.  We may even contribute a little of our weird, isolated  urlLink culture  and watch it bloom.  But we always come  urlLink home .

      I was in Madison this last weekend, enjoying a tenuous peace with some of my more conservative in-laws, when we heard about the death of Ronald Reagan.  After a few of the usual gasps and exclamations that follow news of any famous person’s death, my brother-in-law let out the most heart-breaking moan, turned to me and said: “I bet you’re really happy about this, aren’t you.”  I was a little shocked.  I thought I had shown remarkable strength in not starting a political argument about what we were eating for breakfast, and here I was being accused of callously wishing death on a defenseless, senile old man.  I know that most Republican Americans believe that liberalism is just  urlLink a tool of the antichrist  for world domination, but I’m hardly going to start picking on someone who probably can’t even tie his own shoes.  I wasn’t happy.  Alzheimer’s is a terrible disease and a long, torturous death.  I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.  In fact, I don’t think that I’ve ever had a particularly negative opinion about Reagan.  I was too young during his presidency to see the actual effects of his policies.  I was too young to listen to the Dead Kennedys or get the political undertones of Bruce Springsteen songs.  I was too young to understand that Iran Contra revealed anything more serious than that Oliver North was an idiot.  Any opinion I had of Reagan was my parents’ opinion, and that pretty much amounted to knowing that the wrong team had won.  Now, watching the gears of the political machine slowly shift direction so that they can use the momentum of Reagan’s death for their own gain, I’m starting to wish I had been happy, because the next couple of months are going to be painfully depressing.  Even  urlLink Kerry  announced that he’s going to stop campaigning for a week as a sign of respect (that’ll show those pesky critics that he’s not a centrist waffler), and I am just waiting for the tsunami swell of conservative memorials, retrospectives and commemorations, all with little Gee-Dubya perched on top.  Just you watch: Reagan will become the biggest American political hero since FDR.  And despite my not hating Reagan during his presidency, and despite the fact that I would never wish such a horrible death even on the human equivalent of a banana slug, must we forget in our posthumous huzaas that this  urlLink great leader  was called an airhead by his own authorized biographer?   "There is a basic inability of the political mind, the ideological mind ... to comprehend that a great man can be fallible in private, can sometimes be  urlLink comically fallible  in private."

      I can actually say that I've only been dumped twice.  This is not really because I am a particularly stunning individual that men cannot let go of.  It's more because I simply haven't dated all that many people.  But much more humiliating than my status as a pre-mature fuddy-duddy is the fact that I was dumped these two times by the same exact person.  The same tie-dye-wearing, relatively unattractive, upper-middle-class-suburban-hippie-punk person who went by a nickname  he picked out himself .  Now  that  was humiliating.  The first time he broke up with me I don't really remember much about it--only that I went out afterwards to eat seafood with my parents, and so teenage rejection and calamari are now forever intertwined in my memory.  But I do remember the second time.  Oh boy, do I.  It was at the  urlLink third lollapalooza , which, as everyone knows, was long after lollapalooza was cool.  Grunge was on the way out, but the media was still taking desperate whacks at Pearl Jam's dead horse.  To make it worse, it was a year of record flooding in Minnesota and the island where the festival was supposed to be held was under three inches of water.  They had to move the whole show to the St. Paul civic center, a cylinder of solid, windowless concrete thankfully no longer in existence.  The sound was terrible, relentlessly bouncing around those grey, totally uninsulated walls, and when  urlLink Front 242  took the stage I thought my head would explode.  I don't know who bought the tickets for the two of us, but just for the sake of drama I'm going to say it was me.  To his credit, my then boyfriend didn't spring it on me.  No, he made sure to send me plenty of passive-aggressive signals in the hours leading up to the break-up, such as wandering off without telling me where he was going, pouting when he was with me, and looking over my shoulder whenever I tried to talk to him.    So my pouting, inattentive boyfriend decided that it would be a good idea to wear Birkenstocks to the one arena rock show where you can pretty much bet that everyone else is wearing combat boots.  Not surprisingly, he very quickly loses one of them and has to get out of the crowd before he gets a broken foot.    Since he's trying to break up with me, he doesn't tell me where he's going, and so I spend the rest of the show wandering around a dingy concrete tube looking for him.  I find him wandering around in his tie-dye shirt and one shoe, run up to him in that over dramatic way teenage girls do, and hug him.  He doesn't hug me back.  I get the point.  I think he told me that he just needed some time to "see what's out there."  How humiliating is it to be dumped, for the second time, by a guy only wearing one shoe?   Ah, memories.  To be fair, we were really, really young, I was his first girlfriend, and he probably only got back together with me because I made absolutely sure he felt like crap for breaking up with me in the first place.  I also think that after he broke up with me I wrote him a really nasty e-mail quoted from a  urlLink Clive Barker  novel.  Yeah.  I guess we deserved each other.

      Although I have not yet embarked on the mind-numbing, hair-pulling, toe-nail biting task of writing actual code, the new template is in the works.  I’m already plagiarizing pretty pictures and messing with blissful color schemes, so don’t you worry your pretty little heads.  I’m thinking that something along the lines of a prairie storm would be appropriate for this Midwestern summer—lots of soft blue-grays and maybe a flash or two of brilliant green.  Last night I went to a show at St. Paul’s very own glittering dive palace, the Turf club.  Although I only had three beers, the mossy taste in my mouth this morning is making me wish I hadn’t had any, but there must be some sacrifice in the pursuit of the true rock n’ roll life style.  Actually, I smoked some cigarettes, too.  Actually, I smoked a lot of cigarettes, and that’s not part of the rock n’ roll lifestyle, kids, that’s just dumb.  Now my lungs feel like they’re full of thistles and I’m feeling guilty to boot.  But aside from the consumption of known carcinogens, it was a relatively lively affair for a Wednesday night and fully worth stinking up my nice work clothes.  The biggest treat was seeing  urlLink Dosh  again: the single fragmented microphone, drumstick, white-noise portion of the band Fog.  It’s amazing to watch one person armed with a sampler peddle become so sonically huge that he fills the entire club.  But it’s not just overwhelming waves of sound, either.  At times the music is so small and so pretty you think your heart might break just straining to hear it.  Everybody talks about the music that they would take on a desert island.  I think you’re supposed to say Mozart or Beethoven—something that will still be standing after all the other hip influences and cross-references are pulled out from under it.  I don’t know if I’d take a Dosh CD to a desert island—mainly just because I don’t want to be on a desert island—but I would like to take one out to some impossibly high, abandoned patch of moor.  I’d just lay there for a week or two, listening to the music ebb and flow, watching the clouds part and form, watching the heather bloom and die.

      Okay, so my last post was just kind of non-sequiter and weird, so I had to delete it.  From now on, I will impose a twelve hour waiting period on any posts to compensate for temporary insanity or drunkenness.  I have also come to the realization that I haven't really been updating, and that this blog is quickly drifting towards abandonment.  I had good intentions, but compared to so many other blogs out there, I can't help but feel this one is a little scruffy.  It needs polish.  It needs pizzazz.  It needs to get out of town for a while and put some raw cucumber on those bags under its eyes.  So, without further adieu, I shall begin massaging this neglected little thing back to life.  A new template.  Some pictures.  Some kick-in-the-pants prose.    Just you wait.  It'll be awesome.

      Trying to be a&nbsp;responsible Democrat, I’ve been watching the  urlLink Democratic National Convention  as much I’ve been able (I had a very surreal moment on Tuesday night as I listened to  urlLink Barka Obama  give one of the greatest speeches I’ve ever heard over the radio, while a muted  urlLink Jim Belushi , arguably one of the worst comedians of our time, hammed it up on my television).&nbsp; It’s been fun, but, let’s face it, these days the DNC is pretty much just a giant pep rally with uglier cheerleaders.&nbsp; Every once in a while I have to turn away from the thousands of people screaming for better health care and more money for inner-city schools, and listen to what&nbsp;everybody else is saying.&nbsp; You have to stay in the real world, after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And I must say, I’m rather taken aback by how ashamed of myself I’m supposed to be.&nbsp; Here I thought the word  liberal  was just the political counterpart to the rather benign  conservative .&nbsp; Instead, it appears that it is the counter part of  mainstream , meaning all regular, God-fearing Americans who would never align themselves with extremist revolutionaries like us  liberals .&nbsp;   No, liberal is not merely the term for a left-leaning political ideology, it is  the very erosion of all morals and decency !&nbsp; We want to funnel the world’s resources into the pockets of welfare mothers!&nbsp; We want national healthcare so that we can “inoculate” the nation with a mind-controlling serum!&nbsp; We want to use the UN to shelter terrorist enclaves as a front for our world-domination agenda!&nbsp; We destroy churches!&nbsp; Send white men to concentration camps!&nbsp; Kill babies!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  At the very least, we aren't very popular.&nbsp; In fact, it looks like the only places I can be a liberal without fear are in urban centers.&nbsp; I can only voice my political views without repercussion in dark, sordid bars and coffee houses.&nbsp; College campuses are riddled with them.&nbsp; So are art shows and theater.&nbsp; Is&nbsp;it just me, or does&nbsp;being liberal these days feel a lot like being gay in the 1920s?  Well then, maybe there is hope.&nbsp; First I’ll start a center.&nbsp; I’ll call it the Liberal Safe Zone.&nbsp; We’ll have off-shoot groups like Proud Parents of Liberals, and Mainstream Friends of Liberals.&nbsp; In a few years, maybe we’ll get a Liberal Studies department at the University.&nbsp; With time, a drama titled “Liberal as Heck” will air on Showtime, revealing to the world that Liberals have a lot of the same loves and losses as mainstream people.&nbsp; Then there will be a primetime sitcom about two best friends and roommates, one mainstream and one liberal (although the liberal will never be shown engaging in any sort of liberal activities) where the liberal desensitizes the audience by telling a lot of charming, liberal-centered jokes.&nbsp; Eventually we’ll have a makeover show on Bravo where we show mainstream people that eating tofu can be enjoyable, and reading the New York Times won’t make you want to worship the devil.  But it all starts with the individual.&nbsp; And let me be the first to say: I’m here, I’m liberal, and I’m proud.

      It might look like I’ve been ignoring this blog.&nbsp; I maintain it has been merely the electronic version of holding my breath.&nbsp; You see, for the first time in my life, I submitted some of my writing to someplace that wasn’t edited by myself or one of my friends.&nbsp; That’s right—in all of the thirteen years I’ve considered myself a serious writer (although it has only been five or so years that any one else&nbsp;could have considered me seriously) I have never thrown myself to the literary wolves.&nbsp; I haven’t a single honest rejection letter to my name, except for one that I got when I was eight and my mother submitted one of my stories for me to some stuck up children’s journal.&nbsp;   Unfortunately, the breath-holding didn’t work, electronic or not.&nbsp; In fact, in case you were wondering what the hell the title of this entry meant, it&nbsp;is a great exhilation of breath, with tongue extended, through slightly parted lips.&nbsp; Sadly,&nbsp;neither do I&nbsp;have a rejection letter to show for it.&nbsp; No, I aimed pretty high on my first try, and the great nameless powers that ultimately decide the fate of my ego are simply too busy to click “send” on an automatic rejection form.&nbsp; But at least I did it.&nbsp; I was a complete and utter emotional wreck for the last two weeks, but I did it.&nbsp; I keep telling myself if I do it more often it will get less painful.&nbsp; Kind of like a writer’s Scientology.  But now that the wait is over, I can semi-publicly begin to pick up the pieces of my shattered will and perhaps generate something rejection worthy once again.&nbsp; It’s a nice feeling, although it means I’ll probably have to spend a lot less time doing  urlLink this .

      My heart has always been in books.  I don’t necessarily mean stories, but actual, physical books.  Ones with pages and bindings and serif fonts.  Ones that turn brittle with time, their words snuggling back into that soft blanket of must.  It is the touch of light dust, the rustle of paper, and certainly—especially—that smell.  The inimitable smell, similar to cobwebbed basements but really, fundamentally, unique.  If you want me to fall in love with you, give me a crumbling volume of Mike Gold essays.  If you want me to marry you, hide an old copy of Jane Eyre under my pillow.  If you want to rekindle the old flame, set me loose in the New York library and watch the sparks fly.  Heaven, if there is such a thing, is not all bright lights and clouds.  Leave the harps for the cartoon characters.  Give me silence—nothing more than the occasional footfall—large, heavily draped windows, a desk, a small lamp and thousands upon thousands of old books.  I would read myself into eternity, and eat that smell for sustenance.  It is not very hard to find the root of this fetish. Both of my parents were English professors, so we had no shortage of books in my house.  Books loom in the background of every childhood memory, every giddy teenage phone call.   Our house smelled like books.  Our clothes smelled like books.  Even our pets smelled like books.  It was a painful separation when I had to leave all of those books for collage, but I did manage to bring along one full bookshelf that I retreated into when things got too big and strange and scary.  The important part wasn't even really reading, but just sitting there with a book in my hands, feeling its weight.  It is a mixed blessing that my husband shares my passion for buying books as well as the irrational fear of ever having to give them away.  When we packed up our old apartment this spring we filled twenty four boxes with books, much to the chagrin of the friends who helped us move.  Our cheaper bookshelves lean under the weight of books. Unpacked boxes of books still fill our closets.  We still have not only the hardbound textbooks, but also the flimsy paper workbooks from French, Botany and Math classes we took six years ago.  Together we’re building an eclectic library, from  Calvin and Hobbs  to  The Master and Margarita .  We never leave a bookstore empty handed, and our public library, though we love it, is woefully underused.  I guess we should probably worry about being overtaken by our books someday.  We should worry that our books might eventually fill every room, leaving just a meager weaving path down the hallway.  We should probably worry about becoming a pair of those old recluses who shuffle past their useless furniture muttering to themselves, who walk out the door to buy a bottle of antacid and stronger reading glasses, who might pause under the sun to chat with the little girl playing on the sidewalk, wrinkling her nose, smelling old books.

      After an ego-crushing battle with the simplest of blog templates, I have finally gotten the archives and links back and in the right place.  I also have a new mascot.  Welcome, Ophelia.  Except, even though I love the picture, especially the way it seems like it was meant to be used as a blog header, Ophelia was not my first choice.  I mean, I sympathize with the fact that she is forced to betray the man she loves, who then goes and kills her dad.  That really would suck.  But I'm not terribly thrilled about having a suicidal teenager as the personality of my website.  But I didn't pick her for what she's going to do.  I picked her for what she is doing:  sitting by herself by a stream, looking into the water, with a thoughtful look on her face.  Let's just pretend that instead of thinking of her prat of a boyfriend she's thinking something deep and inspiring and slightly more cheerful.  Actually, the real character behind this blog is not Ophelia, but Cordelia, the unlucky but stoic daughter in  King Lear .  I even thought about making all my posts appear to be authored by Cordelia, but that just seemed kind of corny.  Instead I decided to let the symbolism work its subtle magic. Until now, where I'm going to lay it all out for you in the most unromantic way possible.  (Note: What follows is in no way any kind of literary criticism but merely the ranting of an individual who co-ops artistic meaning for her own selfish purposes)  The title of this blog comes from the very first scene in the play where Lear disowns Cordelia, his youngest daughter.    Let it be so:—Thy truth then be thy dower: For, by the sacred radiance of the sun; The mysteries of Hecate and the night; By all the operation of the orbs, From whom we do exist, and cease to be; Here I disclaim all my paternal care, Propinquity and property of blood, And as a stranger to my heart and me Hold thee, from this, for ever.—        Rather harsh words.  And what did she do to deserve it?  Sleep with his brother?  Kill his mother?  Put black olives in his tuna salad?  No.  All she did was refuse to tell him how great he was in return for her inheritance.    Her two sisters lied through their teeth and split the entire kingdom between the two of them, which actually turned out to be very unlucky for poor old kooky King Lear.  Cordelia refused, saying that she loved him so much she couldn't possibly tell him how much, and rather than faking it she'd leave.  Of course, she does end up getting hanged, but at least she doesn't hang herself.  I picked the title partly because of its literal meaning, reflecting the (at least partial) anonymity of internet interactions.  I also picked it because I loved Cordelia, a symbol of both loneliness and strength, and because of my own habit as a writer of being able to prattle on about nothing at all, while I verbally clobber the things that are most important.  Well, there it is.  A brand new website design practically dripping with pretentious symbolic meaning.  I hope you will enjoy.

      The chemical smell of the new telephone poles that they're putting up in my neighborhood  Watching the manikins in the second floor windows of Saks Fifth Avenue getting dressed  Cigarette smoke in afternoon sunlight  Riding in cars with too many people in them  Spending several hours sifting through books in cramped used bookstores  Ramen  The smell of rain or snow, especially the smell of rain mixed with the smell of chalk and pencil shavings  Unchecked daydreaming  Listening to good music I've never heard before  Sitting in empty classrooms with the lights off

      The weather today is  urlLink unseasonably cold .  Raindrops and wind in the morning, and a brisk blue sky in the afternoon.  It feels much more like October than August, so it’s a little disconcerting look out the window in the morning, still clinging to the blanket, and see the trees still so full and green.  This is orange and yellow weather.  Soup weather.   People are wearing sweaters and drinking coffee but there isn’t a single class to go to or a pumpkin in sight.   As I walked to work, I could feel my nose gradually turning from its usual slight wino-pink to a terrifically undignified cherry red, but I didn’t even care.  The breeze swept through me and gave my insides a little more loft.  I feel re-inflated.  Crystallized.  I feel parts of me churning back to life.  Maybe that’s why I’ve been so obsessed lately with the dangers of dormant potential.  I can feel myself being revived in the dim corners of my brain.  I think that every person on earth could be described as a hurricane in a lead can.  True, some keep the lid off.  Others keep the seal so tight there is barely the hint of a breeze.  Some push everyone and everything around them just to keep the momentum going.  Others suffocate it to a wheeze.  Every single one of us has the capacity to churn the universe into something of our own creation, if we could only figure out how.  Problem is, we really don’t know how unless we’re Jesus.  I love this cool weather because it has allowed me to indulge in a little inner chaos.  It gets my blood pumping.  Makes me want to walk fast to nowhere in particular.  Stirs up the damp, dormant thoughts.  Speaks of change and possibilities.  Lets me get carried away.  So there.

      My friend  urlLink Chris  is a teacher. He’s the kind of teacher who thinks that getting a kid to think about something he’s never thought about before is as punk rock as you can get. He’s the kind of teacher who will talk about his favorite students with his drunken friends at a karaoke bar. He’s the kind of teacher who knows the total quantity of all the  urlLink gold in the world , who will brush up on his Greek mythology because he knows one of his kids likes it, who will try his damndest for every single student if they tried for him.  My friend Chris has a list of questions on his desk at home. He writes down new ones every day. When he brings them to class, they have to think about them quietly for twenty seconds, and then write their answer and why they came up with it. His questions make parts of your brain work that you never knew existed.  He asked me to help him think of more questions. I don’t know if these are as good as his. They might just be unwitting copies of questions from  urlLink that book  you used to bring to lock-ins in high school, but they were fun to come up with. I highly suggest you try it.  1. If you were an alien visiting earth, which place would you like to go to first?  2. If you could give any species of animal the gift of speech, which one would you pick?  3. What’s the coolest thing you’ve ever found lying on the sidewalk?  4. You’re in mid-fall off of a fifty story building. What’s the last thing you could have said to have prevented this?  5. If you could give your friends any superpower of your choice, but you could only give out each superpower once, which superpowers would you give to which friends?  Any thoughts?

      I’m always a little taken aback when I remember that there are really two lives I could be living.  I don’t mean the chance that I could have been born in a Yurt in Mongolia, or even the possibility that I could have turned out a cheerleader instead of a chronic dork.  I mean that I’ll be sitting there, worrying about mundane things, and then all of a sudden my mind flicks into gear and I’ll be thinking about art and books and paintings and music and all of the people in the world who have taken time to stare into space and really, honestly explore the lives they were living.  The wonderful overwhelming reality of it all.  Mortgage payments are quite real, but not as real as that anger, that sunset, that moment when the curve of someone’s neck nearly brought you to tears.  I think of all of those people with brilliant minds trapped in taxes and new cars and that flat screen TV they promised their husband for father’s day.  I think of the rage of that incapacitated brain.  I think of staring out the window of my office, wondering how anyone could deny that there is a world other than this.  Wondering how people could just talk in small ways about small things and never pick up a paint brush or even allow themselves to contemplate the miracle of an eyelash.  What I think about the most, however, is how close I come to that line.  How often I let myself get lost in the clatter of adult responsibility, how often I say I don’t have time to sit down with a pen, how often I lose that other world.  As if it didn’t exist.  As if I’d never known it.  As if it wasn’t more real than me.  Even for a minute, take the time to take a photograph that isn’t of your cousin’s wedding.  Sit down with a jar full of paint and touch up your toaster.  Write.  Read.  Dance.  Unzip yourself.  Walk the world.  Breathe.  Without that, the real world is dead.
