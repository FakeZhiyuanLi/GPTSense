      the last few days for me have been hard. starting sunday i found out that the little boy next door to me died on friday. he was only 5 and had been struggling with leukimia for about a year now. we all thought he was getting so much better, it came as a shock to everyone. monday i got to relax, i went to the beach with matt, ev, and alexis, which was good for me, i got to forget how sad i was, and remember how happy i could be.  matt was sweet, and i remembered all the reasons i love him. yesterday was perfect. tomm. i have the funeral. luckily, matts going with me, i dont think id be able to go without him. my parents are both not able to go, so i need matt to be there for support. hopefully afterwards we can go see princess diaries 2, (i love julie andrews). but i need to survive the funeral first. well, im gonna go now, peace
