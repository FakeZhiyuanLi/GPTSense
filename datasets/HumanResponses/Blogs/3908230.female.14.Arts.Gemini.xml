         The next genius, is Margaret DeCarlo, who is an example to anyone who wants to follow their dreams. She was born and raised in the ever-popular Arlington, Virginia. Her participation in the immersion program there, allowed her more creativity and cultural knowledge. Her skill, and passion, is creating objects out of nothing but what she finds on streets. Her main focus is bottle caps. This is something that she has done for many years, but only now is she able to call it her profession.       She hopes that with this award, she will not only be supported and able to do more, but also will be an example to people everywhere to follow what they feel in their hearts. She is hoping to do some traveling pieces in the near future, such as visiting countries that she never before was able to visit.

      8:23- Turn the sign on my bookstore from "open" to "closed".  8:32- I'm about to lock up and leave, when the phone rings.   8:49- I get off the phone with my friend Anya, who spent ten long minutes talking about the effect of reading German to babies.  9:01- I finally walk to my apartment, where I meet up with Halley and Mickey.  9:10- We start the "marathon" of old anime movies.  11:05- We finish "Spirited Away", and begin "Princess Mononoke"  11:42- I hate the gory parts, so I get up to make horchatas.    1: 06- Mickey has to catch his plane back to Spain. So he and Halley leave.    1:10- I check whats on tv (nothing good) and then sit down with a good book.  1: 50- After finishing up the book I was reading, I brush my teeth, think about how my life is in no way creepy, and go to bed.

      the first pillow that I buy will be covered in turqouise material soft as moss that would not be irritating--  there will be tight brown stitching that wont imediatly be ripped out--  there will be a scratchy annoying tag that I will rip out that says "do not remove"--  it will be so huge that it will be about half my height--  it will be extemely puffy, but not the kind of puffy that gets squashed down after about 10 minutes of use--

             When I was ten, I went to a school trip to El Salvador. I was amazed pretty much the whole time I was there: there were many things similar to the United States but most things were culturally different. For example, in the city, there was Burger Kings and bowling alleys. But there were also people by the side of the streets trying to sell stuff or clean your car, guys on the corners with huge guns, and huge walls with barbed wire and broken glass around the wealthy houses.              One of my most amazing and impressionable moments when I was there, was when we were at the beach house of one of the girls we were visiting. An ice cream vendor came walking up to us with his pushcart. He was trying to catch our interest: he showed us a duck that he had found and "saved". His ploy worked, because we immediately croweded around the duck that had a white film over one of its eyes. I can still picture that day.
