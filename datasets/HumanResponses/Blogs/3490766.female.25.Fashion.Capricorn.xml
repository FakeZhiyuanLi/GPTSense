						   There was this group of local construction workers that came into the store every single night like clock work. They were all quite flirt but there was 2 in general that I talked to more than the others. The one of them (we will call him Dave) was quite cute, but basically a loser in life who only wanted drugs, alcohol, and sex, and then there was the other (I'm going to call him Bob). Bob was a cutie, he was the quite type and to be honest not my type at all. He always came in and never strayed away from his "regular order". I thought he was quite boring yet at the same time intriguing. He and I would always swap words back and forth but usually nothing more than hello and goodbye. Dave was always disappearing from the job site and it did not take long for the other guys to know he was up at the store with me and my girlfriend. He was usually flirt, bust sometimes just down right blunt in a very sexual manner. But that was Dave, Bob was not that way, he would come in buy what he needed and leave. That was until night when I guess he had some time to spare. He came up and parked out front and we talked for most of the night. We spoke about his life and the divorce he was going through, we spoke about my life (not the dark side of it) and basically we just talked about any and everything for a good part of the night. That was the night that I found myself slightly attracted to this guy..

						   You know a person no matter who they are can only be expected to endure so much before they snap. My life was quite the simple one, I would go to school (law school) during the day and come home to clean and cook at night. A day that I did not get hit was a GREAT day. One day I gave my notice at the Law Firm as I did not want to keep having to avoid my own mother, and I could not keep plastering makeup on my black eyes and bruises. I did not need much money to live as Joe paid for most of the bills, so I picked up a little part time job at a local mini mart, I guess just as a way to start to pass the time. Nothing changed at home, and I found myself still covering those same bruises. I can say this to anyone who will listen, when you are being abused you begin to get down on yourself. You don't feel attractive even when people are telling you that you are, you don't feel smart even when you know you are. It's just the way it works. Well, I did the best that I could, even when I was in a rut I still went to work smiling knowing that when I was at work he could not hurt me. I was literally living two lives. One at work at one at home. I was my normal flirtatious self at work and my normal quite shy and scared self at home. I had friends that I worked with that knew my husband was no good, but I also knew how to be quite and reserved and not let anyone into my hell....

						   I ended up staying in Italy for a few days, before calling my brother back in the states and asking for his help again. I was Leary about calling my brother because he warned me that things would not change and that they would only get worse. But I chose to ignore him and now faced having to call him and hear the "I told you" so's. That didn't happen though, instead he asked me exactly where I was, and went out within an hour and wired me $2500.00 to make it back home. When I returned to Germany my brother was sitting at the terminal in the airport and gave me a huge hug, and then we went over and bought a ticket back to the USA. At that moment I left everything I had, including my husband, in the past and returned back to the US. My brothers all architects pulled together and built me a beautiful home, I went to work at my mothers Law firm and I basically pulled my life back out of the rut that Joe had put me in. I knew that I would not be able to avoid him forever so I did the best I could before he came back into my life. That is just what he did after 2 years, and he once again tricked me into believing that he was different and that he really wanted to make things work. And while I bought into his story (again) this time I kept some money and did not tell him about it. I did not allow him to move into the house that was built for ME. I got another house with him, and basically relived the past all over again. Joe became a cop and I was still at the firm. He beat me many many more times in the future and if I tried to leave he found me and beat me some more. If I tried to call the cops, he would have his police friends intercept the calls, and then he would come home and beat me some more. It got to the point that nightly I would pray to die in my sleep just so that the pain would stop. But it never did...

						   One day after we moved to Germany, Joe came in the house with a huge smile on his face and an envelope in his hand. He had bought tickets to a true Italian Oprah as well as booked us flights and a 4 star hotel in Naples Italy. I was so excited I could not sleep for days. Then finally the day of the trip arrived and I put on my prettiest outfit, spent hours on my hair (just like in the beginning) and came out looking like a star that fell out of the sky. We took the flight there, and Joe hates to fly so he was having a few drinks on the plane.  Being that I had not slept for days because of the anticipation of the trip I was both physically and emotionally exhausted on the flight, so I closed my eyes and slept the whole way there (a few hours). To my surprise when we arrived, I found Joe drunk off his ass. It seems that his fear of flying took over and forced him to drink himself stupid. Joe was not a serious drinker in general, he might have a beer here or a beer there but was never a 'heavy' drinker. That night the demons in Joes past revealed themselves and this time with a vengeance.  He beat me with the cord from the iron, then left me in Italy with no money, no clothes, and no way home. All I had was the clothes on my back and the 2 German Deutsche marks that I had in my pocket..

						   So, here I was living a secret life that no one knew about. It was my own private hell. When I would talk to family and they would ask how things were I would smile, swallow my pride and tell them that everything was just perfect. I stopped seeing my friends after they started to get suspicious. I had few that actually knew what was going on and stayed with me till the end.  I was always in the doctor's office claiming that I fell off my horse, or I was cleaning and slipped on the kitchen floor. I really don't think that too many people believed my alibis, yet nobody took any actions either. Finally one day after I was tired of being beaten, and humiliated I went to one of my older brother and told him what had been happening. I come from a 100% Italian family and I am the baby girl, so my brothers tend to be pretty protective over me. My brother was upset at me for standing for all that I had, but did not think twice before confronting Joe and letting him know that he was not going to stand by and watch some man kill his baby sister. Joe was very afraid of my brother and so angry with me for telling him what happened. He told me that he wanted to change and that he had found religion. He wanted to make it all up to me and wanted me to be able to trust him again. I was stupid and I decided to give it a try. I thought to myself "he was good once, maybe there is some hope". For about 2 months he turned back into that man that I fell in love with. He started wining and dining me. Flowers, teddy bears, chocolate and even a 2 CT diamond found it's way to my front door. I was sure things were back to the way that I once dreamt they would be...

						   Now to say the least.. Married life in my experience is not all that it's cracked up to be. Sure, don't misunderstand me, I was so happy to be married at first. I was "all grown up" while I was only 16. I would go to school by day and be a wife by night. I could go out on dates and stay up all night having sex if I wanted to, even on school nights. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I was always smiling and for what..? Just to be in the company of my husband. Then as time went on and summer break rolled around, I begin to grow bored, I mean I was no longer in school and yet Joe was at work all day. So, I started hanging out with some of my friends, both male and female. After all, this is what most teenagers do on summer break right? I started to spend all day at the beach, or at the mall. I was neglecting what I was supposed to be doing at home. I was not a "wild-child" by day and a semi-automatic wife by night. Joe was getting tired of coming into the house and finding that either I was not there, or I had been there all day with a house full of people and left it a complete mess. And while I will take responsibility for those things NOW, I did not see anything wrong with it back then. After a year of marriage going down the drain Joe started to get violent. It all started when he would yell at me and make me cry, then from there it was a slap, then a shove, until finally I spent one Christmas and the 2 months that followed it in the hospital with 14 broken limbs and many bruises, scratches and scrapes to accompany them....

						   Needless to say he was not locked up.. Instead my mother actually commended him on his bravery to stand up in what he believed in which at the time happened to be me! There was just one small problem with he and I being together... My family was moving to Korea (gotta love the military) and Joe was not. So, here I was torn between leaving my family and being with a man whom I barely knew but loved.. Or going with my family and taking a chance that he would still be there waiting for me when I returned. So, after quite a bit of soul searching and debating I decided I was going to stay with Joe. Being that I was a minor my mother could not just "leave me" with him as that would technically constitute abandonment (hey all those law classes are beginning to pay off *lol*) so instead she granted me permission and I married Joe a few days before my 17th birthday. Now before I go any further I want to tell you that here I am 25, and I am still married to Joe.

						   So here I was totally smitten by this man. All I kept telling myself was "This is the man of my dreams, the man I am destined to spend my life with forever".  I came into the house one day after spending all my time with him and decided it was time to have a talk with my mother. It was time to tell her that I had been lying to her all of this time and time to tell her that I just did not understand what the problem was with me wanting to be with an older man.  Needless to say I was so afraid as I came through my front door, How was I going to say what I had to say and make her see it my way? I needed her permission as well as her blessing and I did not know how well that was going to go over. So,after about 20 mins of standing outside mentally prepping myself for what I had to do, I walked in the house and before I could say anything I noticed that my mother was crying. Obviously, I wanted to say what I had to say, but the timing was clearly bad, so I put my thoughts and feelings on the back burner and tended to the current situation. It turns out that my twin brother had been murdered. The next several months were quite dark and lonely for me as well as the rest if my family. One night several months later, I was out with Joe, and as we always did he stopped around the corner of my house to kiss me good night, then continued around the corner to my house, where to my surprise my mother was waiting on a chair in the front yard for me to pull up. At that very moment my heart fell to my feet, and I was horrified that she knew that I had been lying to her. However, I could not let her see my fear because I knew that if she had, she would know I was hiding something. So, I casually opened the car door and turned to Joe and says " I am not sure if I am or not, I will check my schedule" making it appear that he needed me to babysit again. My mother stood up at the very moment and said "Oh, no sweetie, you're schedule is quite booked, now shut that door, and get your ass in the house, the MP's are on the way" (MP= military police). I shut the door and just gave Joe a look as to say "I am so sorry" and then I went into the house. When I got in the house my mother was right on my heels and the it happened there was an explosion.. "What in the hell do you think you are doing lying to me? How long has this been going on? I already lost your brother, am I supposed to just stand by and lose you too?" and so it was a long night. I came clean to my mother and told her everything. I told her that I loved him and he loved me. My mother did the unexpected and made me call Joe and 6 in the morning after a long night full of tears and triumph between the two of us (she & I). She wanted to talk to this man. So, I called him.. I mean I really had no other choice. He was brave and came over right then and there and my mom and my future husband sat there in that living room for 2 hours and talked (like humans). He informed my mother that he loved me and that he was willing to do anything for me including go to jail and he also told both myself and my mother that he had gone back to his sleeping quarters,packed his bags and waited for the MP's to show up and take him away for statutory rape...

						   It was all about love in the start. I was young (16) and living at home with my parents. I met him-we will call him 'Joe'. Joe was the guy that most teenagers adore, he was good looking, sweet, funny and older than I was. Joe was an E-4 in the US Army and I am still not sure if I hooked up with him as a way to escape from home into a world of my own, or if I hooked up with him to spike my mother. Either way he and I started dating and in a short time it became pretty serious. Things were great between us, we spent every waking moment together, when I was not in school and he was not at work, we were together. There was only one small problem he was 10 years older than me and no one in my family knew we were dating. I used to lie to my parents and tell them I was baby sitting. The few times that he was seen bringing me home at 3 or 4 in the morning, I just lied some more and told my mother that he was the guy I was baby sitting for. Mind you- he was very much single and had no children of his own.  Now to let you in on a little of our time spent together... We were like peanut butter and jelly. He treated me like a princess and to me he was my prince. He was always trying to "romance" me in one way or another. He would bring me flowers, candy and teddy bears. He would always ask me on dates. And when I say dates I mean the real kind.. The kind that makes a girl spend 2 hours in front of the mirror to go out to dinner with someone she has been seeing for a few months or more. I was so in love with this man and the greatest part was that he was just as much in love with me.
