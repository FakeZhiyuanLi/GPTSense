      This car was supposed to last me a life time.  It was my first new car.  I paid for it on my own.  But of course now, only 4 years later its taking an untimely death.  Apparently there was a crack in one of the chambers which lead to a fire and then an explosion which now leaves me with a car and no engine.  I'm not upset really about the money, cus really I've got it.  I'm just upset because this kind of thing shouldn't happen.  I just feel like lady luck is never on my side.  I never have to go looking for trouble its just always there waiting for me, like that annoying ex-girl friend who just doesn't get-ITS OVER!!!!    this actually brings me to my next idea.  I think one of my ex girl friends may indeed be to blame for this stream of bad luck.  I think she's cursed me or put some voodoo hex on me or something, because well I found out recently that after all these years (9) she still hates me.  I dated this girl for about 10 months my sophomore year in high school and well she still hasn't forgiven me.  What did I do you ask?  (1) I let her fall in love with me, but I think to myself, she was my first girl friend, I didn't think she was really in love with me, I mean she was 15 for God's sake, how could she have even comprehended what love was at that age. (2) After a few weak attempts at breaking up with her over the summer (where she chose just to ignore and not respond to my messages and phone calls) I decided to move on and see someone else. I know this was wrong.  I shouldn't have done this.  My only defense was well it was so many years ago and well I'm human. (3) When she started talking to my friend after we broke, to get information out of him and I'm sure to make me jealous - I didn't respond, and told my boy to 'go for it' apparently being understanding is not what she wanted.  I figured after however, that the past is the past and what happened when we were kids in high school stays in high school, but no, every person from my world she ever sees whether it be in Manhattan or in California or wherever she chooses to tell everyone how horribly I fucked her over.  I wish I could just make things better, but how do I seek forgiveness when I've let so much time go by, that I question whether I even deserve it.  I guess what I'm saying is that although most sane people would have gotten over this issue, it is still my fault.  I mean I am the bad guy in this story.  I hope I can learn from this and become more conscious of the way I interact with others.

      Ok so its 4 am and yes my blogs are primarily written whether on xanga or now on here in a certain level inebriation that only a select few can understand.  Does my drunkeness command a certain level of disrespect?  No, I don't believe so, because frankly, I'm a dumbass through and through, regardless of how much I decide to drinkg or not. Anyway, the highlight of my day revolves around the fact that my car broke down.  =(   My car is about 5 years old, pretty new, and yet it sits at my boy Kontai's garage where hopefully when he opens shop on monday will quickly be repaired because well the job of reserectors is to wake up the dead.  Yeah I quoted Tribe Called Quest, but well Q-tip is great!  Friggin my hero Emcee.  I wish I could rhyme half as well as he can, but alas the highlight of my freestyle session tonite was rhyming tom's river with some ish about how I was killin my liver.  Not impressed?!  Well neither am I.    I feel like I've lost a bit of my magic.  I used to be able to write.  I used to be able to breathe life, and now, I feel dead.  I need to find my muse.  Where is my muse?  I think she's drunk, or maybe just asleep.

Bloodninja: I can no longer resist the pizza. I open the box and unzip my pants with my other hand. As I penetrate the gooey cheese, I moan in ecstacy.

      	I look around and watch the screen as people walk past me.  I see them smiling, I see them crying, but inside I can hear them laughing.  It’s all a big joke.  A big game.  A mystery to me, but all so simple to those in the 'know'.          I woke up this morning, just like I do every morning but this time something was different.  I couldn't place my finger on exactly what had changed, but what I was aware of was this unusual scent of fear lingering in the room.            What could I be afraid of?  How much worse could things get?  I don’t have a job, a car, I rarely talk to most of my friends, and the bills just seem to keep pilling up.  The only thing that I have to look forward to these days is the bottom of my whisky glass and even that needs to be rinsed out.         What did I have left to fear?  All I've ever wanted of myself is to fill my niche, and now I've come to learn I don't have one.  Maybe that's my problem.          I grew up in two small suburban towns not more than 12 miles away from one another, yet for some reason skimming back through my experiences as a south Asian adolescent in central jersey, my history seems to be carefully blended into chapters and pages written by a pen not my own.  I mean I should know where I’ve been especially since where I’ve been was such a small place.   Maybe this memory lapse is because I kept a written journal of my thoughts threw these years and as I've gotten older I've simply lost touch with the person I once was, or maybe my distanced memory of my past is a result of a memory spoiled by extended problems with drugs and prescription meds.               Whatever the case it seems to be an insurmountable task to find out where I'm going when I'm not really sure of where I've been.  I have memories of walking with God and being shunned by angels.  I have glimpses of images of 'bondhooks' pointed at 'bondus' but I can't put together these thoughts.  Were they simply dreams?  How could they be real and yet seem so much more vivid then my last weekend adventure.  It seems like the things I should know of as fact seem to feel more like stories people have told me about someone else, and my own past is something so much different and less certain.  Which if true, could explain why the present is nothing like what I would expect for myself and the future is all the more clouded.             As these clouds slowly start to clear from the motions of these passing faces, I realize I'm surrounded by so many unfamiliar faces.  The people closest to me are as good as strangers, ghosts if you will, and yet how can I claim not to know them when I can't find my past.  Who am I?  Where am I?  Who can I ask?  Who would even know?          And so I stand up from my corner seat in the theatre and as I walk out I see an usher, rushing to my person to get me back into my seat, but before he can get me down, I ask him, "where am I?" and right then and there I realized I didn't belong here.  He wasn't looking to get me back in my seat; he just wanted me out of the theatre.  Out of the building.  It was as if the only reason I was sitting there in the corner was to hide, and his sole mission was to find me, and remove me.  And so he did.  I had to leave. This chapter is ending now; maybe I should just start from the begining...
