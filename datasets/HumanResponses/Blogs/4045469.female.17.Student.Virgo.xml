        Finally got myself out the house last night, and discovered that weed and alcohol taste better when they're free. Ha ha. Nobody really complained though, because it doesn't take much to get me drunk, and it's usually me who supplies the free weed via my brother.

        urlLink              I'm, suposedly, average and I'm fine with that, because after reading   urlLink   this     article, I realised that having a high/higher IQ isn't necessarily a good thing. Nor is comparing your level of intelligence to others, though the fact that I can say such and still take the test proves I'm nothing more than a contradiction. I'm an average contradiction... so sue me?!

        My mother asked me if I wanted to go on the weekly family outing (swimming)&nbsp;with them today, and as usual, I said no.&nbsp; Not only would I not be seen dead in swim wear, but I also don't concider this&nbsp;to be a&nbsp;"family", we're more&nbsp;the ruins of a family, than a family.&nbsp; Even when we were a family, I always felt like an outsider, she didn't even think to invite me until I questioned where they were going...&nbsp;so... Bah, back to my original point... which I haven't actually established yet... The convo went:      &nbsp;    Mother: &nbsp; Well good morning stranger.

         I don't like it at all, so I'm verging on bad.&nbsp; To me it just highlights the fact that I'm not "normal", so not normal that a law has to be passed to ensure I'm treated normal.&nbsp; I know it takes a lot of nerve to go to the hospital and have your arm stitched and admit you did it yourself, and it doesn't exactly help when you're looked down on as being an attention seeking idiot.&nbsp; I know, I've been there, but... I don't know.&nbsp; It makes me feel somewhat disabled, I'd rather, for some strange reason, that folks were up front with me rather than hiding behind a law that says they have to behave in a certain manner.&nbsp; I like honest reactions.&nbsp; Infact, I'd say the fact that the nurse scoffed at me in the hospital helped me in a way, it made more determined to stop.&nbsp; I didn't want to be looked down upon for the rest of my life.&nbsp; Inforcing laws just makes it seem like we're accepting it like any other disability, like something that can't be helped/cured, when it can.&nbsp; We shouldn't be accepting things, we should be changing them.&nbsp; Not that I have any better suggestions though so... Hrm.       Bah... I'm not making any sense, huh.      I suppose I just look upon myself as being as pathetic as most others do, so I kinda figure I deserve whatever harsh treatment I get.&nbsp; **shrugs**

        Been feeling extremely vulnerable recently.&nbsp; Like I could do something that would be concidered "stupid" again, and it would be totally outwith my control.     &nbsp;

        I'm begining to doubt I'll be able to keep up with everything when I start back at college again, and as a result everything will go to the shits, and I won't be able to cope with that again. So I'm unsure of what to let go of, and what to keep a firm grip of, in preparing myself for the worst.  I know it seems I just sit here alday, doing nothing, but it's this nothing that seems to be everything to me. It's this nothing that allows me to be me. When I attempt to do anything else, I end up getting seriously overwhelmed and I completely lose myself, and although I hate myself beyond belief, I really don't like that.  Confusing, huh? Times that by 100,000,000,... and you get how confusing things are for the whore, shoveling the shit in my head.  This isn't right. I mean, are things really supposed to be this confusing? Am I supposed to be feeling this tired and warped? Does everybody else feel the same way? If so, how the hell do you all cope with it? Sometimes I find myself so confused I can't even do the simpliest of tasks, tasks that don't actually require much thought, if any at all, like dishes, or even just watching a simple soap on TV.  Sometimes I feel I'm on top of the world, and could take on anything, others I forget where I am, who I am and what the hell I'm supposed to be doing. I've found myself, on many occasionas, seemingly waking up from some sort of dream, almost doing something dangerous. Yesturday I found myself just about to stick my hand in the chip fryer. I really can't go on like this.  But hey, maybe it's completely "normal" and I'm just a weak piece of shit.  It really gets to me sometimes, because I find myself coming across to people, that I really want to give a good impression of myself to, as a retard. I'm deffinetly not a retard. Well... I never used to be, not so sure about now...  As a child I was freakishly smart. I really was, and I loved it. I was a strange child. I spent many days indoors just pondering endlessly over anything and everything. I was quite the little philosopher, my mother was forever losing her temper with me because I questioned and complicated EVERYTHING. But it never struck me as odd until just recently, when it came up in a discussion, and no one could honestly say they experienced similar thoughts to mine when younger, though they all seemed to find similarities amongst themselves. Every teacher I had (and believe me that's a lot of teachers, considering I've been to over 28 different schools), never failed to comment on how clever I seemed (ok ok, I know it's their job to say that, to encourage learning, but the majority of them genuinely seemed rather taken by me), and the only national test I ever sat, I came out tops. T'is just a shame I never really put any of it to use. =( Seems like myself, and many others, let my so called "potential" just slip away.  Actually, no, the more I think about it, the more I realise my mother's constant lack of interest/concern probably played a huge role in such. Because since she was never around, and never posessed the desire to educate her children when she was, I had to learn to seek out answers and conclusions on my own, and thus I picked up a "skill" I found to be of much use throughout my young life. But now it just seems to have completely vanished. I can't think on my own, and when I try my brain just seems to short circuit.  I was your regular smartass, bever missing an oportunity to flaunt it either, but now that it's all gone, I'm nothing.

        Slow down you crazy child You're so ambitious for a juvenile But then if you're so smart tell me Why are still so afraid?  Where's the fire, what's the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out You got so much to do and only So many hours in a day  But you know that when the truth is told That you can get what you want Or you can just get old You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through When will you realize... Vienna waits for you  Slow down you're doing fine You can't be everything you want to be Before your time Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight Too bad but it's the life you lead You're so ahead of yourself That you forgot what you need Though you can see when you're wrong You know you can't always see when you're right  You got your passion you got your pride BUt don't you know only fools are satisfied? Dream on but don't imagine they'll all come true When will you realize... Vienna waits for you  Slow down you crazy child Take the phone off the hook And disappear for a while It's alright you can afford to lose a day or two When will you realize... Vienna waits for you  But you know that when the truth is told That you can get what you want Or you can just get old You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through Why don't you realize... Vienna waits for you When will you realize... Vienna waits for you.

        We all got booted out of Hutchy's because Billy got excessively drunk and attacked Hearty, so yer, that was um... entertaining... until we realised it meant a 3 hour walk home, which actually turned into a 5 hour walk home, due to Hutchy and Hearty refusing to leave Cheryl and I the fuck alone, "we're gentlemen, it's our duty to insure you get home safely". How patronising?! Grr!!! And gentlemen??? Ha ha ha ha ha. Yer... Anyways... So we eventually get home to find there's a full scale riot happening right on our door steps.
