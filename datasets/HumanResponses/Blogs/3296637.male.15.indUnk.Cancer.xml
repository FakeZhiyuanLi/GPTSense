      Jaime showed me these and I couldn't help but post them:   - The only acceptable sexual position in Washington, D.C. is the missionary position.  Any other sexual position is illegal.  - In Kentucky: "No female shall appear in a bathing suit on any highway unless she be escorted by at least two officers or unless she be armed with a club.  - In Connorsville, Wisconsin, it is illegal for a man to shoot off a gun while his female partner has an orgasm.  - In Maryland: "Every person who shall be convicted of taking into his or her mouth the sexual organ of any other person or animal, or who shall be convicted of placing his or her sexual organ in the mouth of any other person or animal, shall be fined.  - In Hong Kong, a betrayed wife is legally permitted to kill her husband, but may do so only with her bare hands.  She may kill her husband's lover, on the other hand, in any manner she desires.  - In Birmingham, England, it is illegal for a man and woman to have sex "on the steps of any church after the sun goes down.  - In Cour d'Alene, Idaho, police aren't allowed to walk up and knock on a car window.  Any officer who suspects that sex is taking place must drive up from behind, honk his horn three times, and wait approximately two minutes before getting out of his car to investigate.  - In Romboch, Virginia, it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with the lights on.  - An ordinance in Newcastle, Wyoming, specifically bans couples from having sex while standing inside a store's walk-in meat freezer.  - In Alexandra, Minnessota, No man is allowed to make love to his wife with the smell of garlic, onions, or sardines on his breath.  If his wife so requests, law mandates that he must brush his teeth.  -In Florida, having sexual relations with a porcupine is illegal.  -The penalty for masturbation in Indonesia is decapitation.  -In Krakow, Poland it's not only a crime to have sex with animals, but three-time offenders are shot in the head.  -There are men in Guam whose full-time job it is to travel the countryside and deflower young virgins, who pay them for the privilege of having sex for the first time. Why? Under the law in Guam, it is forbidden for virgins to marry.  -As recently as 1990, these states had laws against the use of dildos: Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Washington D.C.  - It is illegal for any member of the Nevada legislature to conduct official business wearing a penis costume while the legislature is in session.  - In Ventura County, California,cats and dogs are not allowed to have sex without a permit.  -In the state of Washington there is a law against having sex with a virgin under any circumstances (including the wedding night).  - Sodomy laws have been repealed—or are ignored—in most states, but not Georgia, where a man was sentenced to five years in prison for engaging in oral sex. With his wife. With her consent. In their home.  - The city fathers in Clinton, Oklahoma have banned local men from masturbating while observing a couple making love in the back seat of a parked car in a drive-in theater.  - Carlsbad, New Mexico, retains a law making it illegal under certain conditions for couples to have sex in a parked vehicle during their lunch break from work. The car or van must have tightly drawn curtains to stop strangers from peeking inside while the activity is taking place.  - Connecticut still retains an old law forbidding any kind of "private sexual behavior between consenting adults." This odd law makes absolutely no distinction between married and single couples.  - Prostitutes in South Dakota are still prohibited from plying their trade out of a covered wagon.  ...and I think that's enough for now.  It's random, but it's pretty funny, too.  Thanks Jaime.

        It's 11:45, and I still need to finish my math homework; the usual situation.  The process is as follows:    -Get home from school  -Get snack, pet dogs, etc.  -Take shower  -Think of bringing bookbag upstairs  -Stop thinking and turn on Xbox, play random game  -Bring backpack upstairs, do all of the homework except French and math (i.e. maybe 15 mins worth)  -Go on Instant Messenger and talk to people (If everyone is away doing homework, then idly look at profiles and surf the web meaninglessly)  -Look at clock, realize it's almost midnight, and you still have at least an hour's worth of homework to do  -Finish the homework (sometimes not), and go to sleep at one or two in the morning  -Wake up at 6:30 and complain about having too much homework and not getting enough sleep for the rest of the day  -Repeat cycle    If this seems to be close to what you do every day, then you are like most of us, a procrastinator.  But how do we brake the habit?    It seems that the majority of teenagers are procrastinators.  Sure, there is the occasional guy or gal who obsesses over their homework and turns in an essay five times the length it should be, but the majority of us spend the weekend doing stuff, and then end up on Sunday night with an essay and two tests the next day.    According to our Harvard-lecturer sermon today in chapel, we are all to anxious.  I don't know what makes him think that, as most of us are too tired to be anything by this time of year.  His whole sermon was on this topic, and he succeeded in coming to the same point multiple times without changing even the wording, reasoning, or even really examples behind it: We must relax.  But if this is the case, then the sermon is going almost completely against what the teachers are telling us.  While Harvard tells us to relax, they don't want another "anal-driven student" to their school, our teachers tell us not to slacken up until summer, and they load more and more homework and tests onto us.      How in the hell are we supposed to relax.    I won't even go into discussing why faculty members were fervently nodding their heads in agreement with Mr. Harvard, as that only leads to more confusion.      The whole point of this, however, is that our school is hypocritical in inviting this man to tell us to relax, while at the same time loading us more work than we've had most of the school year.    I also know this topic has drifted from one thing to another, and it started on Procrastination, which is where it will end, also.  By writing this blog, I've effectively procrastinated for a good twenty minutes, and will hate myself for that tomorrow when I'll probably have to end up taking the Bible quiz.    My Point:   Procrastinating sucks.
