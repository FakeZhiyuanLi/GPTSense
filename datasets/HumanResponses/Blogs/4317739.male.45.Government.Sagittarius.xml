In this series we are examining health care market in India, with special emphasis on how to make health care market to work for the poor.       Present Scenario:    ►Labyrinthine queues, indifferent staff, harried doctors, – the trademark of public healthcare facilities under the aegis of various governmental agencies.  ►Glass exteriors, sparkling corridors, state of art equipment, and presence of BIG money every where…. the private specialty and super specialty “Five Star Hospital.”  ► a small glass door, a poky passage… a few ill-equipped rooms, with astronomical charges, a busy doctor cum administrator (with some “friendly doctors” on the panel) discreet staff…that is your neighborhood nursing home.  ► the ongoing dispute between private medical college owners and the government, over quota, fee structure, capitation fee etc has characterized our medical education system in recent history.     2.    MAJOR ISSUES    Literature on public policy on health, with special reference to India, reveals that following issues have been attracting attention of policy makers.    Decreasing public (Government) expenditure on health --   a). Contribution of public expenditure in health in India has declined substantially since independence and today private expenditure is 87% of total expenditure while contribution of public expenditure is only around 13 %. The Human Development Report 2004 (Times of India, New Delhi, 28th July 2004) shows India ranks 171st out of 175 countries for whom data is available as far as public spending on health is concerned (0.9% of GDP). On the other hand, India ranks 18th out of 175 on private spending on health (4.2% of GDP).   b). Poor and inefficient delivery system in public sector. c). Rural - Urban divide in terms of facilities and availability of qualified manpower. d). Big infrastructure gap, which is highly skewed against rural areas. e). Issue of ethics in private sector.       3.  Present policy and status of human resource in health sector in India  .  The Annual Report of Ministry of Health and Family Planning, India, for the year 2001-2002 States as follows: -   “…In the past, during the 6th and 7th Five Year Plan periods, the policy of Government has been to  discourage  opening of new medical colleges in the country, as the existing medical colleges were considered to be sufficient to meet the medical manpower needs of the country.  This policy was reviewed after1991, when it was recognized that a large number of posts of doctors were lying vacant in many places especially in rural areas and there was tremendous pressure for gaining admission into medical colleges. As a result, new colleges were getting established even without basic requirements of infrastructure, equipment and faculty.In order to check the mushroom growth of medical colleges, the President of India promulgated an Ordinance on 27th August 1992 to amend the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956. The above Ordinance was converted into an Act of Parliament on 2nd April 1993. The main provision of this Act relates to seeking prior permission of the Central Government before establishing an institution imparting education in medical sciences, increasing the intake of students or introducing a new or higher course of study.     After the enactment of the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Act, 1993 and the Regulations issued there under, the Central Government have permitted establishment of 37 medical colleges; 19 private sector and 18 in Government Sector till date. Out of 37 medical colleges permitted, 6 medical colleges were permitted in the year 2001 -2002.”     Even today if one sees how issues are being made of capitation fee, admission quota’s, fee structure etc involving high court and supreme court with out realizing that it is not helping cause of medical education or health care in the country.     What country needs badly is qualified doctors in hordes not in trickle.     From the above one can see that we have been and are still very negative when it comes to granting new medical colleges.  Even after realizing that there is shortage of professionals in the field    (Ref.: Review of 1991   ) the Government further centralized the process of allowing new medical colleges in the name of quality. It is not understood how transferring power of sanctioning new medical colleges from Medical Council to Central Government going to help in reducing shortage and improve quality?  Quality can be checked only by professional bodies like Medical Council and not by generalists. Such policies only delay the process and sends negative signal which discourages normal business people to come forward in this sector as its looks to be the exclusive field of few selected.  This attitude further helps the existing private colleges as they function in a protective environment where demand for admission is huge. This creates a hidden monopoly. Like any other monopoly created in private sector, this too is exploitative, which is reflected both in the exorbitant informal fee charged by them and in the quality of education imparted.  This also led to creation of another monopoly of private practitioners because of shortages of qualified professionals; as discussed later in Para 4b.    Status of supply of doctors in India.    A. Total number of doctors has gone up from 61,800 in 1951 to about 0.50 million in 2001. So on an average we have added 9022 doctors per annum during last 50 years. Presently we are adding about 17,000 doctors per annum.  B. India has 0.40 doctors per 1000 people as compare to 1.0 and 1.5 in  low-income countries and world average respectively (excl. India and china).   C. If India wants to reach status of low income countries or world average then we need to have 41,000 or 81,000 additional doctor per annum on an average against the present number of about 18,000.  The demand supply gap would be further accentuated when we take into account the long gestation period (almost 6 years) for educating doctors. This is based on following assumptions.  ● we are working for a period from 2004 to 2014. ● population in India to grow only by 15 crores in next ten years. And today’s population is taken as 100 cr only. So we will be working assuming Indian population to be 1200 million in 2004. (Very conservative estimate!!) ● no change in doctor population ratio in countries or group of countries with which comparison is drawn. ●another 80,000 doctors (assuming 20,000 addition annually since 2000) have been added to the medical pool in the country since 2000 so we take doctors figure as on today as 5,83,000. ●Including various types of practitioners in health field, the total number are expected to be around 11,00,000 in India presently. For our work, we have taken base figure of 5,03,000 qualified physicians as reported in the National Policy on Health, Indian Medical Council registration data etc. This tallies with the data available in the World Bank and WHO data bank. [1]   [  1]     The data for other countries for comparative purposes has also been taken from the World Bank and WHO data banks. Hence we are safely presuming that all the data considered here refers to qualified physicians only.      4. Human Resource in health sector -- our  view.     We consider human resource development (and more so qualified professional) as the key for any health sector strategy. We consider this as a key strategy for following reasons: -    A. Theoretical model.    We consider consultants (i.e. doctors etc) in the health sector as key element. We believe that it is around consultant health care revolves. We take medicine, undergo operation, tests, hospitalization etc all under the advice of consultant. This applies equally to both, rich and poor. Only the rich may consult the best professional whilst the poor may land up with quacks also.  Imagine following scenarios.           Situation A:   - Number of qualified doctors reduces over next few years in the country a.      Can health care grow under such situations? b.     Will service not go down while costs may go up? Space vacated by qualified people will be taken by unqualified. Reach of good qualified service will reduce. c.      Will it not increase rural /urban divide or rich/poor divide further? Obviously qualified doctors will move towards greener pastures i.e. urban areas and rich people; leaving the rural and poor people left with lesser or unqualified professional.           Situation B:   - Increased Public and Private Investment in health-care infrastructure without commensurate increase in   qualified professionals. a.    Will quality health care grow even after investment in infrastructure? b.    Will higher private investment in such situation not attract existing professional from less lucrative markets to more lucrative markets? In case of India this threat is a reality in view of India being marked as health tourism destination. c.   This will be further accentuated by increasing tendency of corporate to tap health insurance sector, which will tend to increase health care demand by rich sections. d.    Will not all these factors create a further vacuum in already scantily supplied rural areas? e.   Higher private investment as said above would increase urban rural divide while higher public expenditure, without commensurate increase in health personnel will only help contractors and suppliers. May also satisfy bureaucrats that they are able to obtain high grants for their department and able to spend it. but outcomes??            Situation C:   - Suppose we follow proactive medical education policy, which helps in increasing supply of qualified professionals.  a.      Cost and quality of medical service will improve as accessibility and choices will increase. b.     Increase supply of qualified personnel will push creation of other infrastructure facilities, which go with consultants.              Situation D  : - Visualize a fully furnished hospital without doctor, which can actually be seen in some remote govt. hospital. Simultaneously imagine a small room with a table/chair and a doctor. People will not go to such a furnished hospital and will prefer to go to the single room clinic.  The above analysis reveals that supply of qualified doctors is the key to any health sector strategy.  This is what we have admittedly neglected on one pretext or the other (e.g. National Policy in the 6th&7th plan to discourage medical colleges and subsequent centralization of power for granting medical colleges).    This could have been avoided if our policy on medical education was embedded in reality and we had allowed market forces to determine the demand and supply of qualified professionals, keeping the role of State restricted to the extent of regulating quality.  Till as late as the 6th and 7th plan we did not recognize the need for more doctors and when we thought there is a demand supply gap we strangulated the supply in the name of quality control, (centralization of power to open new medical colleges). Paradoxically we haven’t succeeded in that too.  Is this a case of judicious allocation of resources?     This is a result of lack of clarity on the roles and objectives. Our view is that welfare function of the state will be best served if we regulate the quality and leave quantity to be regulated by markets.     We may even add that markets are a good judge of quality too provided there are choices and no shortages.  It is well known that in eras of shortage bad quality also get absorbed. Quality is discounted or recognized with premium only when there is abundant supply, which provides options to people to choose from. Let us not forget that various brands are established in market. Let us not forget parents try to send their wards to best school, which they find out by word of mouth. Word of mouth is a system of communication, which is time tested but it will work only when you provide choices and no short supply.      B. Health expenditures in India: -    As per the established data about 87 % of health expenditure in India is in private sector (Source: World Health Report 2000). The trend has continuously been in favor of private sector since independence. This is one of the highest health expenditure in private sector in any country in the world.                          When we reflect on this we realize that in a situation where we have a shortage of key element of health system (viz. paucity of trained doctors) how can we expect good health care. Rather shortage means high price and bad quality. And if shortage is there in a situation where market is highly fragmented and mostly in private hands then it can be highly exploitative (it tends to become hidden private monopoly). It becomes highly regressive further for poor as he spends higher percentage of their income on health.  c  . Core health indicators and doctors: -    An Analysis of core health indicators vis-à-vis doctors number and per capita health expenditure in $ ppp terms in countries with similar level of per capita expenditure has been drawn by me and it shows direct co-relation between number of qualified doctors and core health indicators with expenditure being same. Country with low doctor population ratio even with high per capita expenditure fair badly when compare to countries with high doctors ratio on core health indicators.   d.   Indian health markets – booming?    Many market research organization have been burning mid night oil painting the possibilities of high growth in Indian health sector in future. It is expected that the market size will grow from about USD 20 billion to USD 46 billion by 2012(“Healthcare in India: The Road Ahead" by the CII and McKinsey & Company in 2002).  India is being seen as a heath tourism destination. This seems to be a reality too as Indian markets are relatively more cost effective as compared to international market keeping the quality constant. Indian health market is also, expected to grow because of expected increased penetration by health insurance.  These forces will push the demand for various types of health services and if on the supply side the key element (viz. trained professionals) is in shortage then the demand will remain unfulfilled causing shortages. This will lead to shifting of trained professionals from non-lucrative markets to lucrative markets, increasing scarcity in already neglected areas.  From the above we are convinced that supply of doctors is critical and the most important intervention for improving health cares in India.  5.        Strategy/ Recommendations      a. Introduce a diploma course in medicine of three years. The diploma will allow him to do limited clinical practice. A diploma holder will be entitled to take admission for a degree course only after doing two years field experience. The experience can be even free  lance practice.   b. State intervention only to check quality while granting medical colleges and that too by professional regulator like medical council. Bureaucratic and political involvement should be barred. Rules to be modified to take away the intervention of state /central govt. role and leave it only to medical council.  c. Leave the quantity to be decided by the markets.  d. Higher support to medical education by the State either by setting new colleges or if need be by supporting colleges in private sector monetarily. This will help in better utilization of public private funds and bring about public private partnership.  e. No need for the government to set itself the task of prescribing fee limits – once there is open competition, the market will ensure that these colleges only charge the fee that is commensurate with the quality of education they impart. This will actually spur private colleges to be recognized as centers of excellence as well. f. If state wants to provide support to certain sections of the society the state can reserve seats in public sector colleges (on the same lines as done today). Similarly in private medical colleges government can reserve seats to help certain sections of the society, but will pay fees on behalf of such students as any other regular student by providing budgetary support.  g. State based CET to be conducted under the supervision and guidance of the regulator and all admissions to be based on CET merit, which will have scope to discriminate, in favor of socially backwards by following existing system. Even colleges may be given permission to conduct their own entrance examination, as given to few government owned colleges. This will help in developing competition among them selves to attract good students to have a name for themselves. We may climb a new ladder in higher education.  h. No issue of capitation fee and quota in medical college etc.  6.       Advantages of this strategy       This policy shift will have the following advantages.  a. Expansion of health care services leading to better and cheaper services for all and there will be happy space for swanky hospital too!  b. This will provide more options to the patients and hence better bargaining power.  c. Will fulfill expectation of many students desirous of becoming doctors and provide them with choices. More medical colleges mean better bargaining power to the students / parents, both for fees and quality of education.  d. Will break informal monopoly created in medical education and in health sector in India, which is hampering better health care in the country.  e. As we have been saying in our various articles choices is key to success in any public policy. We believe so because choices provide scope for selection. Selection and only selection leads to evolution and that is change. It also empowers people as they apply their mind to choose from various options. Indian history is full of evidences where given the choice Indian people have shown how sensibly they have selected  7.    Success of this strategy:     Can relaxing norms help? Whether private sector will find it lucrative enough to enter health education market?  Let the market decide.    Sunil Porwal is an IAS Officer of the 1983 batch.

      Rural Credit Thinking out of the Box  By – Sunil Porwal, Vinita Porwal & JP Rai  Almost everyone agrees there are two Indias. One India is represented by the urban success story - IT superpower, global recognition, rising forex reserves, increased consumer spending of the urban middle class, holidays abroad, and overcrowded shopping malls doing brisk business.  The second India, which unfortunately accounts for 70% of the population, is that which finds its place in the media glare only when hundreds of farmers commit suicide, children are sold, young girls are pushed into prostitution by the very people who should be protecting them, and of course, starvation deaths.   It is not that the Indian state has not tried to address the needs of this section. From direct beneficiary-oriented and area-oriented poverty alleviation programmes of the “Garibi Hatao” era of the 1970s, to the trickle down effect of the post liberalization era of the 1990s, governments in India have tried various ways to free this large mass of Indians from grinding poverty.  These efforts have been supplemented by large doses of subsidy, nationalization of banks to make rural credit more easily available, setting up of cooperatives, and more recently, SHGs (Self-Help Groups) and micro-finance institutions (seeking to replicate the success of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh).  Unfortunately, corruption has eaten away the lion’s share of the subsidies meant for the rural poor. The institutional finance arrangements have been cornered by the rural rich and industries masquerading as “agriculture” and “biotechnology”.  So, the rural poor remains just that - rural and very poor. His only option is to become the urban poor - and many are opting for this by migrating in millions to cities which are unable to provide the basic civic amenities to the people already resident in them. As a result, a new landscape is now dominating urban India - sprawling slums adjacent to the swanky high-rise luxury apartments of the residents of the first India.  The Common Minimum Programme seeks to address this by “The rural cooperative credit system will be nursed back to health.  The UPA government will ensure that the flow of rural credit is doubled in the next three years and that the coverage of small and marginal farmers by institutional lending is expanded substantially.” (Emphasis added).  What this statement implies is that a substantial section of small and marginal farmers are still seeking credit from non-institutional means. Or, the traditional moneylender.   The words most commonly associated with the traditional moneylender are “greedy”, “unscrupulous” and “usurious”. Since independence, and even before that, innumerable laws were enacted to wipe out this “scourge” from rural India.  The fact is that the moneylender still exists. Here are some recent reports:  “On an average, the spend on construction of a pucca house in rural areas was about Rs 1.13 lakh while in urban areas, households living in areas other than slums spent Rs 2.63 lakh. The average size of a pucca construction in rural areas was 42 sq m compared to 53 sq m in urban areas. The survey found that the 72% of the expenditure was made on materials while 21% was spent on labour. Further, it was found that rural households financed around 66% of the construction costs from own resources and the corresponding figure for urban households was 62%. Moneylenders financed 15% of construction cost in urban slums and squatter settlements. In other parts of the urban areas, the figure was only 4%. For rural areas, moneylenders financed 9%.” The Economic Times, 24th May 2004  “In a major move aimed at providing relief to debt-ridden farmers, the Andhra Pradesh assembly has passed the AP Agriculture Debt (Moratorium) Bill-2004 that seeks to place a six-month moratorium on repayment of loans raised by farmers from private moneylenders. It, however, does not include institutional lenders such as commercial, rural and co-operative banks. The new Congress government has come out with the Bill after it found that harassment by private moneylenders was one of the major causes driving farmers to commit suicide. It hopes that the farmers would be in a position to repay their loans after the on-going kharif season, which is expected to be good this year following a good amount of rains received in the last couple of weeks.” Times News Network, 23rd June 2004  Despite having been at the receiving end of all social, legal and economic action for over 60 years, how and why has the traditional moneylender survived?  And why have rural people still gone to him, despite other institutional sources of credit having been created specifically to meet his needs? Various studies have documented the main reasons due to which the rural poor approach the local moneylenders as being: Easy access to funds, Low transaction costs, Fixed and rigid repayment terms, Negligible lead time for loans, Loans available for consumption as well as productive needs The common caricature of the traditional moneylender as a pot-bellied ogre notwithstanding, the fact remains that he continues to exist, and that a substantial part of time to acknowledge that the major reason is that he continues to perform a role that no other institution has been able to take on.  The Chinese are credited with the saying “Wisdom begins with calling a thing by its right name”. Since China and the Chinese success story are the flavor of the season, let us apply this Chinese saying to our moneylenders:        Fact: Moneylenders continue to exist       Fact: They are a source of approximately 40% of the rural credit in India       Fact: All related laws enacted since Independence have sought to write-off amounts owed to moneylenders, or to make the process of recovering loans given by them very difficult.       Fact: These laws have increased considerably the risk profile of loans given by moneylenders       Fact: The higher the risk profile, the higher the interest rates.  So, while it is convenient to blame the greed of the traditional moneylender for the usurious rates of interest he charges, the laws are equally responsible.  It is worthwhile to examine this problem from another angle - that of the economic successes that India has had in the last few years. The sectors that have done well are those that have been opened up to competition, and where the laws of demand and supply have been allowed to operate.  Why would not the same work for rural credit? By hounding the moneylender, are we not creating an artificial scarcity? If we accept that moneylenders continue to have a role to play, would not the rural poor be better served by allowing more such moneylenders to operate? Increased supply of moneylenders as a source of credit would ensure more competition, which would translate into better terms for rural credit.  The policies that have been adopted till date have had the dual effect of limiting supply, and increasing the risk profile. At the same time, these policies have failed to eradicate the moneylender as a source of rural credit. Alternatives in the form of institutional credit have also failed - else, why would the moneylender still be around? So, the resultant effect has been to push the rural poor to moneylenders who are operating as near-monopolies in their respective areas, and with a very high-risk profile. Can we blame the moneylender if he charges rates that are high?  Over the years, governments in India have operated by the dictum “if you can’t beat them, join them”. So, we had one amnesty scheme after another for the urban and corporate tax evaders. The “black money” was to move from the “parallel economy” to the “mainstream”.  Since we have tried all these things for other sectors, it is worth having a new look at our approach to the traditional moneylender. If he is going to be around (and his resilience so far gives no reason to assume otherwise), would not the cause of the rural credit be better served by co-opting him into the system, and subjecting him to the laws of demand and supply?

            FEW IMPORTANT FACTS AND OBSERVATIONS – Micro-Credit.                                                                   By :- Sunil Porwal      1.  According to the Micro credit Summit Campaign Annual Report 2003, micro credit reached 3.6 million of poorest families in Asia; 4.2 million of poorest families in Africa and Middle East; 0.98 million of poorest families in Latin America and Caribbean; and 0.05 million of poorest families in Europe and Newly Independent States.  My comment: - how long poor should wait to have access to competitive credit!  “THE village moneylender in Bangladesh charges interest rates of over 150 percent a year. Citibank would love to get that kind of return on its investments -- so why isn't Citibank lending money in Bangladesh villages?”  Source :-(In a model for lending in developing nations, a Bangladesh bank relies on peer     pressure for collateral. New York Times; New York, N.Y.; Nov 22, 2001;  urlLink Hal R. Varian ).  My comment: -- why more moneylenders not entering this lucrative market?  3.     Such exorbitant rates are sought to be justified on the ground of high risks involved: no legal document, no collateral. In real life, however, default rate is very low because the lenders wield direct social power over the poor borrowers;and moreover, the latter sincerely try their level best not to lose this very last resort. The current trend of decline in interest rates in the organised credit market does not seem to have any bearing on the informal rural credit market because the latter operates in virtual isolation from the former – in areas where formal credit institutions do not tread Recycling of loans – borrowing in the formal market and lending in the informal – is often resorted to by propertied people having “proper connections”.  Source :-Social-Democratic Agrarian Programme in West Bengal and Trends in Agrarian Relations - Arindam Sen  My comment :- why not more people enter this market by developing “proper connections” ?  State regulated rural credit was originally justified by a raft of criteria: the need to displace informal finance on the grounds of the kind of monopolistic and exploitive practices excoriated in the All India Rural Credit Survey of 1954: the need to penetrate regions as yet thinly and imperfectly provisioned with credit… and the encouragement of a wider social dispersal of increased incomes in order to achieve higher levels of output and growth. (Sarap, 1991, Kohli, 1999)  My comment: - Recognition that moneylenders operate under   monopoly.       5.  Informal methods administration costs are, surprisingly, below those of banks operating much larger loans. Whereas banks reported operating costs on the order of 12% to 19% of amounts lent, informal moneylenders and associations were generally under 3% (partly because they carried little overhead costs). Furthermore, repayment rates tended to be higher for informal lenders. At least 80% of informal agents in Ghana and Nigeria reported no delinquent borrowers, and all expected virtually 100% repayment within three months of the due date. Thus, the data indicated that informal agents bore lower relative costs and losses on their small loans than banks did on larger ones, contrary to the common perception that small loans are costly and risky…  Source: --(World bank group findings – African region – number 79 – Jan 1997)  My comments: -- poor don’t borrow from one source. Many a times they borrow from both formal and informal sector. In such situation they are induce to repay high cost moneylender money first. – “ See how intelligent is our poor”.  As people need to borrow regularly it is vital for them to repay else they may deprive their source of finance itself, hence high rate of recovery.  People don’t want to loose their lender of last resort. .   6. While analyzing the demand and supply position of mF, it was observed that various estimates put the requirements of micro credit at Rs.15, 000 crore to Rs.50, 000 crore per year and an additional Rs.1, 000 crore is estimated for housing per year. As against these estimates, bank advances to weaker section aggregated Rs.9, 700 crore during 1997-98, while mFIs and SHGs are estimated to have provided about Rs.137 crore (cumulative up to September 1998), suggesting a vast unmet gap in the provisions of financial services to the poor. (Nabard report).  My  comment: - first we don’t agree with the demand projection as we feel that till demand is fully met its dangerous to predict demand as there can be big latent demand.  Secondly any lowering of interest due to competition will push up demand.   7. There is a substantial literature building on American research establishing that low-income households are less able to take advantage of low prices and are disadvantaged as consumers in a number of fields.   The argument that the poor pay more is also linked with data about access to credit.  Source:- THE DYNAMICS OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION AND NEIGHBOURHOOD DECLINE: HOUSING, WELFARE REGIMES AND THE UNDERCLASS, Alan Murie, Centre for Urban and Regional Studies, University of Birmingham, U.K.  My  comments: - continuous increase in inequality.  Dossier, Volume 14 #5 Churches Came to Terms with Money lending By      Curtis Fahey urlLink Curtis Fahey  is an associate editor of Compass in Toronto. Until the fourth century the Church Fathers condemned the taking of interest from the poor, but that was all. Subsequently, while church councils in the fourth and eighth centuries determined that the charging of interest was immoral, only clerics were positively forbidden to engage in the practice. The turning point was the period from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries, when three separate church councils condemned anyone who charged interest, regardless of the amount; one of these councils, in 1311, even threatened such evildoers with punishment as heretics. Both in England and on the continent, and both in the Catholic Church and in Protestant ones, the story was the same. Prohibitions of interest slowly but inexorably were cast aside under the pressure exerted by economic reality and changing theology, and the word usury itself, once applied to all interest, came to be associated only with interest levels that were clearly excessive and exploitative.   2. The facts that the Chettiar overseas firms were invariably housed on the ground floor of the Chettiar temple, the simplicity of their working attire which consisted of just a dhoti and a vest, and the donning of the vip¶ti on theiot forehead, all served only to take the edge off their profit-seeking activity, and made them seem more as this worldly ascetics rather than as shrewd calculating, avaricious moneylenders. (The Temples and the Social Organization of the Chettiars (Part 2) by Indira Narayanaswamy).  3.     Anti-Semitism since Jews were generally restricted to the pursuit of occupations that were taboo, such as money lending, the sentiment was also economic in nature. (Columbia Encyclopedia).  These are some examples to show century old taboo against moneylending.  The views expressed here are all personal and has nothing to do with my official capacity.

                            Making markets work for poor- Rural Credit- India                           By: - Sunil Porwal, Vinita Porwal, and J.P.Rai.  Poor in India suffer primarily because of lack of bargaining power in the markets where they participate. This lack of bargaining power is similar to what the rich used to face for cement, telephone, cars etc during days of License Raj.  Since late 80’s for various reasons we started de-regulating various markets, which essentially gave options to the consumers. This bargaining power to the consumer is the key to whatever improvement one sees in markets, which have been deregulated completely, or partially in India. E.g. Cement, steel, organized finance, housing finance, automobiles, telephones, etc.  Transferring this bargaining power has helped only the rich because, unfortunately, the socialist mind set allowed us to experiment only with rich men’s markets, as it was always thought that poor can’t survive in “markets.” So the benefit of this transferring of bargaining power mostly reached the rich, as most of the deregulated markets happened to be the affluent/ “rich men’s” markets. Poor men markets were never touched as it was presumed that the markets exploit the poor. The notion or mindset is that markets are bad and poor can’t enter markets. (Without realizing that he is already there in health, credit, water, energy etc markets).  We beg to differ on the assertion that poor can’t enter markets as he is illiterate and is not capable of bargaining. This tantamount to saying that poor are not intelligent. First and foremost is that poor have been entering various markets but he doesn’t enjoy them because shortages don’t allow him to bargain. We will like to say that given the options to choose from, poor too have capacity to bargain and take benefit from the markets. There are numerous examples to show that given the choice poor can intelligently decide. But if there are no choices then even educated and rich can’t bargain. You can’t bargain when there are shortages. Today the poor are unable to derive benefit of the markets not because he is poor, or illiterate etc but because most of the markets he goes to are full of shortages. How can one bargain in market, which is full of shortages? Were the rich capable of bargaining when there used to be shortage of cement during license raj in India? It is well known that in shortages not only prices go up but even bad quality is accepted.  Process of deregulation takes out this shortage from the markets. In the last 15 years have we ever heard of cement shortage? But till today we keep hearing of electricity shortage, water shortage, inadequate health services, non-availability of cheap credit etc.  We can help the poor in a short time if we can identify reasons for these shortages and remove them.  To elaborate on this we take the case of informal credit markets in India.  A Few facts about the money market  a)      Interest rates in unorganized markets have not fallen and spread between organized and unorganized market remains very high indicating shortage of supply in the latter.            b)      The micro-credit market is huge and coverage by government / donor /multilateral agencies supported vehicles is dismally low. Further the efficiency of the delivery system is not up to standard threatening the very sustainability of such efforts.       c) As per World Bank report and many other studies it is seen that the risk of informal lenders are low because people don’t want to lose their lender of last resort. Why moneylenders are exploitative?  The vast market and high interest rate in informal markets should make it very attractive for potential investor or other business people to become moneylenders. But then why this is not happening?  “THE village moneylender in Bangladesh charges interest rates of over 150 percent a year. Citibank would love to get that kind of return on its investments -- so why isn't Citibank lending money in Bangladesh villages?” Source :-(In a model for lending in developing nations, a Bangladesh bank relies on peer          pressure for collateral. New York Times; New York, N.Y.; Nov 22, 2001;  urlLink Hal R. Varian ). Our comment: -- why more moneylenders not entering this lucrative market and giving competition to existing lenders? The words most commonly associated with the traditional moneylender are “greedy”, “unscrupulous” and “usurious”. Since independence, and even before that, innumerable laws were enacted to wipe out this “scourge” from rural India. Mindset is that money lending is bad, blood sucking etc. all literature on the subject worldwide talks about ills of money lending.  In view of this various government world over have tried replacing them with various govt. supported credit program like RRBs, NGOs, Co-operative banks, credit societies, SHG’S etc. However, Govt supported efforts (top down approach) suffered from various problems associated with bureaucracy and have not succeeded in tackling the problem in any measure.         As compared to this the informal lenders have advantages of being reachable and sustainable with high efficiency.  In view of above facts the ground reality remains that the moneylender survives and enjoys the market as entry of people i.e. their own class who could have given right competition to them; was always condemned and the machinery proposed to meet the demand never functioned.  We have already seen above, the successful deregulation of some of the rich men’s markets. The sectors that have done well are those that have been opened up to competition, and where the laws of demand and supply have been allowed to operate and people have been given the choice.  Why would not the same work for rural credit? By hounding the moneylender, are we not creating an artificial scarcity? If we accept that moneylenders continue to have a role to play, would not the rural poor be better served by allowing more such moneylenders to operate? Increased supply of moneylenders as a source of credit would ensure more competition, which would translate into better terms for rural credit.  The policies that have been adopted till date have had the dual effect of limiting supply, and increasing the risk profile. At the same time, these policies have failed to eradicate the moneylender as a source of rural credit. Alternatives in the form of institutional credit have also failed - else, why would the moneylender still be around? So, the resultant effect has been to push the rural poor to moneylenders who are operating as near-monopolies in their respective areas with high interest rates.  Since we have tried all these things for other sectors, it is worth having a new look at our approach to the traditional moneylender. If he is going to be around (and his resilience so far gives no reason to assume otherwise), would not the cause of the rural credit be better served by co-opting him into the system, and subjecting him to the laws of demand and supply?  We can name them as “rural non banking finance companies “ or money traders.  The views express here are personal views of the authors.

                     Not “Trickle Down” but  “Push-up” will work!            By – Sunil Porwal, Vinita Porwal & JP Rai  Happiness to all can be equated with empowerment of all. In the Indian context let us see whether we are capable of being empowered with such low human development indices. (Year 2001-India ranked 115)  At the time of independence we adopted a liberal political model, a totally free democracy. Let us see how the masses have reacted to this empowerment. In 1977 they conveyed to Indira Gandhi clearly that they wouldn’t accept dictatorship. In 1980 they told Janta Dal, loud and clear, that the party in power has to govern well. In late 80’s they gave message that corruption at high places have no place. And in 2004 they took  the “shine” out of BJP led NDA’s  campaign.  The above illustrations show how judiciously they use power when times required them to be decisive. We feel that the electorate have not let us down, and the ills in our electoral and political system are more due to other factors.  Our farmers are decisive, canny and intelligent. Every day our farmer decides what to sow. If prices of soyabean in market goes up then area under this crop goes up. Mostly decision taken by farmers is right. Given the opportunity to use power, Indian people have shown, both in the political and economic fields, that they have the capacity to use power; which means we are capable of being an empowered nation provided people are allowed to participate.  Many a times people borrow from both formal and informal sector. As interest rates are higher in informal sector compare to formal sector, it is noticed that people tend to  pay high cost debt first. Aren’t they behaving the way we normally behave ?  Trickle down approach, whether economic, or social has missed this key element of Indian psyche and we are still not able to get out of the mind set of freeing the  poor from the clutches of bureaucracy, social elites, NGOs, politicians, Social workers etc.  This article will examine the following issues:  1. How and why “trickle down” has not worked? 2. Empowering people by providing opportunity to decide leading to faster economic growth and reduction of inequality. 3. Why our strategy will work.   1 How and why the “trickle down” has not worked  In 1956 we adopted the policy of growth and trickle down approach. We invested heavily in organized sector. Our employment even today in organized sector is only 8 %, not to speak of the period from the ‘50s to ‘70s. The question is, when most of the population is not part of organized sector and hence not part of the chain; how “trickle down” can help them?  Then in 1970 we started with a direct attack on poverty, where again the approach is top to bottom and it failed because of various reasons or succeeded in limited way.  In 1990, we embarked on macroeconomic interventions and structural changes. The structural changes programme mostly involved those sectors where heavy investment has been made during the various five-year plans by government. (Lot of money was there!!) They happen to be sectors where poor hardly participate and hence no benefit accrues to him either directly or by spin off, as he is not part of the chain. This only accentuated the inequalities. Thus it is clear that the trickle down has not been working because of skewed policies and development model , which the planning had launched.    2. Empowering people by providing opportunity to decide leading to faster economic growth and reduction of inequality.  To demonstrate this we take the example of financial markets in India with special reference to unorganized financial markets.  Financial markets in India can be divided into organized financial markets and unorganized financial markets. In organized financial markets in India interest rates have fallen down in last few years benefiting the rich. This shows that supply is more than demand in the market. In unorganized financial markets, mostly catered by moneylenders, interest rates have not fallen. So there is no benefit to poor, rather relatively he is becoming poorer.   He is becoming more uncompetitive vis-à-vis organized markets, as his cost of capital is much higher then the cost of capital in organized markets leading to increase in inequalities.  The unorganized financial market is huge at least in terms of number of borrowers participating in it. This indicates the existence of an opportunity, which can be unleashed.  Moneylenders mostly dominate this market and enjoy the invisible monopoly that is operating in the market.  As per World Bank report there are 7000 Micro finance institutions, serving 16 million people. (Ref.  urlLink www.gdrc,org/icm/data/d-snapshot,html )  Fewer then 2 % poor have access to financial services (credit.) from sources other then moneylenders. (Ref.  urlLink www.gdrc,org/icm/data/d-snapshot,html )  Fewer than 10 million of 500 million people who run micro and small enterprises have access to financial support for their businesses. (Ref.  urlLink www.gdrc,org/icm/data/d-snapshot,html )  This shows predominance of moneylenders when it comes to lending poor worldwide.  The mindset is that moneylenders are per se bad. So the vehicle, which is available and has been financing poor, has become a monopoly of few. A social ban is more far reaching than a legal ban. Thousands of examples are there to see that issues, which are legally banned but socially acceptable go on. But when it comes to things, which are socially not acceptable, even legal sanctity can’t help.  As we have stated above that high rates charged in unorganized markets is an indicator of huge gap in demand and supply. And in the previous article we have questioned this gap when conditions for perfect market exist.  To fill this gap, after socially discarding moneylenders, state and international bodies worldwide thought of various mechanisms to reach poor to fill the credit gap. These initiatives are in the form of RRB’S, Co-operatives, NGO’s, Self Help groups, Grameen Bank of Bangla Desh etc. But these initiatives suffer from following fallacies.  1.      Their reach is abysmally low. 2.      The transaction cost is high. 3.      They tend to become bureaucratic 4.      Development of vested interest and cornering of benefits by few leading to higher inequalities. 5.      Breeding ground for dirty politics. 6.      Questionable sustainability etc 7.      Notion that government loans are not to be paid leading to high delinquency  The resultant scenario- no competition to moneylenders and so the monopoly continues.  If we could have accepted moneylender in the system by not labeling  it as a socially undesirable animal it could have worked well because of following reasons.  1.      They have reach. 2.      They are sustainable 3.      Transaction cost is less. 4.      Higher efficiencies  By opting them in the system and accepting them socially as a desirable profession, it would have encouraged more people to enter this business leading to competition and choices to poor to select from. This will help poor to bargain and enjoy the benefit of participating in perfect market and getting empowered in the process.   Solution: -- Accept moneylender socially and admit that they have a role to play.  Outcomes of this acceptance of reality.  A. Fall in interest rates in unorganized financial markets.  More people will feel confident to enter this market leading to increased supply thus reducing supply demand gap causing interest rates to fall.   To what extent rates can fall in unorganized markets. Today interest rates in organized markets are on the average is about 12% and in unorganized markets it is about 50/60 %. So the spread is very large. Money market is a commodity market where trading occurs. The volumes in this market (unorganized markets) can be very high looking at the potential, as number of borrowers is very large. In high volume commodity markets the trading margins in India have been seen as low as 1%.  In organized money markets spread is about 3 to 4 %. The fixed cost of organized player is higher then unorganized player like moneylenders as other traders in India. So theoretically the spread can come down from 30 to 40 % to 4 to 10%.  This fall in spread will only benefit poor.  The fall will be dependent and directly proportional to the increase supply in the market which will in turn depends on increasing number of players entering the market, which in turn will depend on social acceptability of money lending as part of our system.  We expect that interest rates can fall substantially in unorganized markets helping poor immensely.  B. Reduction of inequalities.  The present system is increasing inequalities, as interest rates are higher in unorganized sector as compared to organized sector rendering them uncompetitive. Increase in supply in unorganized sector will reduce gap in demand and supply leading to fall in interest rates which will enhance competitiveness of poor participating in unorganized markets as compare to organized markets bridging inequities.  The rate at which inequality will reduce will depend at the rate at which interests will fall in market, which in turn will depend on predictability about social acceptance of traditional money lending concept.  Barriers to social acceptability of traditional money lending  Moneylender is like any trader trading in money. It is their monopoly, which is bad. It is the monopoly which is exploitative not moneylenders per se.  1.      Mindset that money lending is per se bad, blood sucking etc. all literature on the subject worldwide talks about ills of money lending. This mind set is without realizing the reality that moneylenders exist and if they were not there then poor would have been dying. Our social taboo against money lending has helped moneylenders to operate in a monopoly environment leading to exploitation of poor and increases in inequalities in all developing countries.  2.      Politicians will be afraid to accept money lending as a pro-poor measure because opposition against them can retort to say that party in power is helping moneylenders. This fear in my opinion is unfounded as this change in mindset is going to help poor in reality, which will be to the advantage of politicians.  3.      Moneylenders themselves may form a lobby and to protect their monopoly will try to politicize the issue on the grounds that money lending is bad. The fear of moneylenders that they will loose by opening of the sector is actually unfounded, as they will benefit by increased volumes after opening of the sector.  Opening or unleashing of many sectors of Indian economy has shown that volumes grow very fast (e.g. cell phones in last two years, automobiles, income tax collection jumped when rates are reduced, and many more markets have witnessed this). And we feel that the story will be repeated here also benefiting poor tremendously.  Initially Bombay Club opposed opening of Indian economy in many sectors but now it is seen that it has helped the participants of Bombay Club too.  So opening of money lending will help moneylenders also by way of increased volumes.  4        Bureaucrats, social elites, NGO’s, multilateral agencies etc will oppose it, as their stakes in the system will go down. But if it helps poor which is major stakeholder in the game, we have to ignore this minuscule opinion makers.  “In an era where the small entrepreneur is hailed as a key protagonist in economic development, such small-scale financial service providers are – by contrast - frequently ignored (if not despised) by development policy makers and practitioners.  Such a position, after all, provides a convenient justification for the mobilization of donor funds for micofinance”… ref – metro moneylenders by meenal patole and orlanda Ruthven for small enterprise development journal.  C. Unleashing the growth in economy  Reduction in interest rates in unorganized sector will increase net income of poor and their capacity to consume and borrow more. Many poor will become more viable and they will become part of positive business cycle, which will propel growth.  Looking at consumption pattern internationally India ranks much lower in terms of per capita consumption of many goods and services. Taking that about 30% of our population is consuming at higher rates then the balance 70 % will be consuming much less then the average. The less consumption levels offer much higher scope of growth. India’s move towards fully employed economy will be faster as market mechanism suggested will cover large Indian population.  Our suggestion to socially accept money lending will increase income of these 70% whose consumption is presently low and this will unleash their potential and that can have much greater multiplier effect in economy and growth rates may gallop. This will make India attractive destination for investment. The only thing, which can then stop India, would be the widespread terrorism in the region. We have a few ideas to tackle this also and may write about it in subsequent articles.  D. Empowering poor  As poor will have more options to choose from they will be in a position to bargain and exerts their influence in market leading to their empowerment.  E   Better recovery for formal credit agencies  Many a times people borrow both from formal and informal sources. Normally interest rates are higher in informal market and this induces borrow to first liquidate liability of informal sector vis – a vis formal sector.  Any lowering of interest rates in informal sector will benefit in recovery of dues of the formal sector .  3. WHY WE THINK IT WILL WORK  1.      Lifting social stigma.        As we say its social ban, which support monopolistic operation of moneylenders, once accepted socially, markets will take over and will ruthlessly balance the existing imbalance.  2.      Both stakeholders will be benefited.       The poor, as a major stakeholder, will be benefited by lowering of interest rates the other party in the market i.e. moneylenders will be benefited by the increased volume of credit off take. Credit off take will move up in tandem with fall in interest rates.  If we look at reduction of income tax rates one can see both the stakeholders i.e. income tax payers and government have been benefited. Similarly in car/ automobile sectors both stake holders i.e. suppliers and buyers have been benefited and hence both accepted the system. Hence where ever we have allowed/ unleashed market forces all the players participating in the market have been benefited.  In this case also as both the stakeholders will be benefited we are confident that the change will work and help poor.  3.      Impact on organized sector  Increase income of lower 70%, whose consumption level is low, will expand the existing markets for various goods and services thus helping organized sector too. Hence they will support such a move.  70% will give major “ push up” to Indian economy, which will work.   4.      Free economic system suits India as it is being superimposed on free political system  India has a free political system, which has worked well in empowering Indians politically. It has created an environment to enjoy freedom responsibly. Hence any changes in economic front, which makes general masses stakeholder will work well in Indian context. The proof is there when we liberalized many sectors of our economy.  5.      As it helps majority of Indians, it will make good politics also.  6.      Markets are ruthless.  Many people argue that Traditional bond between moneylender and borrower are strong and difficult to break. Markets are ruthless and they can break any bondage provided social acceptability is there.  7. Change of time leading to higher awareness, information flow, and technological revolution etc assures us that situation for perfect market to operate are quite high.

                            Mechanics of transferring power to poor                                                  By: - Sunil Porwal                                                           While we adopted a free political model but the mechanics evolved for economic and social progress over year’s strangulated people’s freedom, their capacities to think and make their decisions, as they were not given options to do so. Over the years we have experimented with statutes after statutes, laws after laws, rules after rules, regulations and regulators after regulations and regulators, schemes after schemes, plans after plans but still major section of the country is where it was. Helpless, health less, money less, waterless, education less etc. Rather some sections have been suffering constant slide in competitive terms.  Though tolerance of Indian society is a great strength but we shouldn’t be so complacent about anything. Let us not test the patience of the have not’s too much. We have to act and we have to act positively to empower them. The only way is to transfer excessive power enjoyed by public servants to poor. But how?  The way out is to create parallels/alternates to government interventions and increase competition in sectors wherever possible by providing choices to people. Choices make people to think and apply mind and decide. That application of mind is a journey towards truth and empowerment.  Element of subsidy can be build in the system where ever and for whomever it may be required for social and economic considerations.  Only choices to people will put desirable pressure on existing players and will break monopolies or oligopolies. In whatever sector it is, let it be water, education, health, electricity, rural credit, agriculture markets, agriculture processing etc.  People argue that how choices will be helpful if people don’t have purchasing power. To understand it we need to review evolution of Indian economy for last 50 years.   Though one can almost see a direct co-relation between purchasing power and bargaining power but is it always true? There can be situations when your desires and your purchasing power are of no use and you can’t bargain, as you have no options. Think of cement, telephone, car industry etc in India in let say 1980 and today. Though many of us had sufficient purchasing power but we commanded no or very little bargaining power in these markets in 1980. We were at the mercy of one or few supplier’s thanks to rules/policies/ mind set etc. A careful examination of these three markets in 1980 show: -  a)     Short supply of both goods and the agencies supplying the goods. b)     Government control on production and supply. c)      Queues and queues. And babu’s employed to regulate used their monopolistic power in most discretionary fashion. d)     Bad quality at cost plus rates were the outcome.  The late 80s’ saw the deregulation of cement sector, followed by the Cars and Telecom sectors’ liberalization along with many others. The results are visible:  a)     More choices to people. They can select. No shortage, no lines, no permits, no minister’s recommendation for telephone, etc.  b)     Better quality and more variety at competitive rates.   The main reasons for this empowerment are transfer of power acquired since independence by public servants back to the concerned people and not the increase in purchasing power. The mechanics of doing was to open supply channels to more participants making them to enter the market and compete. This process was not a simple privatization. Here we consciously opened supply lines to allow anyone having the wherewithal to enter the market and compete. This was done at no cost to government. The result is fast and widespread. No one had to run after its implementation, as the market creates enough pressure to make the stakeholders work. The imperfections in these markets were removed as the causative factors were dismantled and power was transferred to people. The change is helpful to all the stakeholders, i.e. consumers, suppliers, government etc and hence has not remained like a pilot project, and there is a sustainable change.  In these three sectors and many other sectors liberalized instead of a babu sitting in palatial secretariat taking decisions, now it’s the suppliers and buyers who are taking decisions. The power is transferred to the real stakeholders to take decisions and hence their empowerment.  Power sector vs. telecom sector reform - Reform process in Power vis-à-vis the Telecom sector in India since the early 1990s reveals that in power sector we followed two courses. First, the MOU route to set up generation capacity and second, the unbundling of state electricity boards. Both changes only created controversies and derailment of reform process in the critical power sector. Result- No Change. In telecom sector we followed the approach of providing choices to people and it has worked. Choices to consumers in power sector are not an unknown thing.   Poor men markets - The markets can be broadly divided in two segments. i.e. markets frequented by rich, eg. Car, housing loan, telephone, television etc. and second category is the market frequented by everyone irrespective of their income. Eg. Money market, education, health, water, electricity, agriculture, labor etc.  While we deregulated many of the markets frequented by rich but we shirk away from doing so when it came to poor men markets. Our socialist mind set didn’t allow us to touch poor men markets as it was always thought that poor can’t survive in “markets” and therefore can’t be exposed to the markets. (Without realizing that he is already there in many markets like, agriculture, health, credit, water, energy etc and is getting exploited due to imperfections in these markets).  Thus poor men have been deprived of benefits of bargaining power, which have accrued to rich men because of liberalization in their markets. If we follow same course in many of the poor men markets then we will see history repeating itself.  A look at various markets frequented by poor regularly i.e. agriculture markets, credit markets, health, water, education, electricity, etc one will find following features. : -  a)     Perpetual shortages of supplies and/or suppliers/ buyers etc   b)     Excessive public servants control, c)      Lack of choices and competition, d)     Bad quality of services at higher cost typical of shortage in a market.  The imperfection in these markets is due to ill-conceived policies and norms and excessive control. Dismantling these barriers can increase the bargaining power of poor at a much faster pace as has happened in cases mentioned above.   Agriculture markets: - Accrual of higher incomes to farmers in sustainable manner is the main concern of all. The way out is either to reduce input cost or/and increases productivity or/ and increased price realization.  Price realization of output can be increased by higher value addition or higher margins to growers. High tax regimes (excise, sales tax, and taxes on packaging material) is a barrier to the growth of processed food industry while monopolistic regulated markets all over India deny growers of wider options to sell their produce.  Reducing taxes on processed food and allowing parallels to the present regulated agriculture markets can go a long way in increasing growers’ incomes, which will in turn push capital formation and innovations in agriculture.  Though these have been recognized as critical constraints but we are still procrastinating over their implementation. Result public servant remains overpowered at the cost of underpowered poor. E.g. Amendment to Agriculture Markets Act of various states is languishing with the GOI, which is working on a model act from the last two years, but still we are where we were.  Actually what we need is legal space for players to operate parallely to APMCs. This can be achieved by simple notification under the saving clause of concerned Act. State of Maharashtra adopted similar route for its cotton monopoly scheme in 2002 successfully. Instead of going around amending the legislation the monopoly was broken by allowing other players to enter the market by notification under the saving clause of the Act.  Education markets: - India’s expenditure on education is relatively much better but commensurate outcomes still defy us. Quality is a major concern. There are no choices to people for free schooling other than government sponsored/ controlled schools. Hence power vests with the public servant and not with the poor who has no choices, no options to choose from.  Providing education voucher to poor can provide space to him to bargain and choice system will come into operation. This can be done by ear marking some funds to start with for this system. It can bring features of market into fully government-sponsored sector.  Vouchers can be issued by concerned district education officer and distributed by the collector of concerned district on the basis of prescribed norms. Schools getting vouchers, as fee will surrender same to concerned district education officer for payments.  The only malpractice can be over estimation of eligible people and sale of vouchers. Though we shouldn’t be so much concern about genuine sale of vouchers by some poor under distress but monitoring of false issue of vouchers may be needed.  Health markets: - 87% of health expenditure in India is out of pocket expenditure. Hence complaint of under involvement of public sector in health and the same cited as main cause for poor health indices.  In education expenditures in India are at par with many countries but still our levels are much lower. So just mere higher expenditure is not sufficient to improve a sector. Neither over regulation.  The key element in health sector is qualified doctors. Health sector revolve around doctors, on whose advice everyone takes treatment. India ranks quite low when it comes to number of doctors per 1000 people in the country. In India it is 0.4 as compare to 1 and 1.5 for low-income countries and world average respectively.   Let us imagine what would have been health scenario in India if we had 1 million doctors instead of present 0.5 million. If one studies the core health indicators and availability of doctors in comparative countries one notices that the number of doctors plays a significant role in health care as shown by the indicators. In India we have always been very negative in sanctioning medical colleges. Limited private medical colleges exploit students in terms of fees, engage public servant in rounds of unproductive regulations, court cases and thirdly low supply of qualified doctors.  There is a need to rethink on policy for regulating grant of medical colleges on urgent basis else prospective health tourism and health insurance in the country will divert professionals further from non lucrative markets to lucrative markets affecting poor further.  Government should only control quality through medical council instead of controlling number. Rather there is a strong case for government to support facilities, which increases supply of doctors.  Presently most of the expenditure in health sector in India is in private sector. There is a strong demand to increase public expenditure in health care sector. I think it will be better that the increased expenditure on health sector can be used for giving health vouchers to people. While increase in doctors on one hand will increase dispersion giving higher bargaining power to poor, the vouchers can further add to their bargaining power.   Water markets: - While in metros we get water for about Rs.300/- month per family including water bill, pumping and storage cost etc., in hinterland people land up paying much more for water. Large number of people in rural areas has to sacrifice whole day’s labor to fetch water on regular basis. The lost of opportunity by poor in such cases makes them pay actually much more for water.  Again the sector suffers from no choices and monopolistic state control. Over powered public servant dominates. Two-pronged strategy is needed in the sector. First recognize rights of people on water, which will provide incentive for private investment in creation and maintenance of water resources. And secondly incremental government expenditure to be incurred through voucher route to deepen markets.   System of issue, distribution and payment for voucher etc can be same as that in case of education sector.    Electricity markets: - Every family in India (even poorest of families) spends every day some money or the other for fulfilling their electricity needs. It may be in the form of candles, lantern, petromax, inverters, and generators etc. In one has to spend money to run and maintain many of these devices. The farmers also spend money for running diesel engines etc. Thus many people are capable of paying their electricity bills. Many studies have proved this. Though it may not fully match the cost of power that many sections may use once provided to them.  I have already discussed how we have approached this sector since early 90s’. The sector continues to be plagued by shortages and poor service. Reason is not too far to seek. Monopolistic state control of electricity persists till today. There is no choice and competition in the sector.  The right course for electricity sector is to create parallels of electricity boards in generation; transmission and distribution by mechanics of open access through stand alone entities or integrated entities. The only thing is that these parallels to electricity boards should be in the private sector.  In addition, if the State feels the necessity to give subsidy to deserving people, it can be done by way of vouchers so that market is not distorted and imperfections don’t occur.  Rural credit: - Poor borrow more than others. Many of them borrow from moneylenders for various reasons. Efforts made by government from time to time have failed to provide credit to poor. The supply channels have remained clogged causing shortages and situations for exploitation by moneylenders.  High rate of interest by moneylenders is an indication of short supply in the market. Thus no choices and competition resulting in exploitative interest rates.  Traders are present and trade in many items and commodities in rural area, so why not money traders? If we can allow private bankers then why not money traders, who are only allowed to lend. Century old taboo against moneylenders always forces us to react negatively to this class of people. As we talk of creating business environment for various businesses then why not we do the same for money traders so that supply of such traders increase leading to competition causing interest rates to fall. The way to provide this kind of environment, which enthuses new players to enter, is not to hound moneylenders but to recognize them.  This will provide more choices to poor to borrow and hence more bargaining power.  We can call them money traders or “rural non – banking finance companies” which will be allowed to only give credit. They will be required to apply for license to district collector and acknowledgement of application will be permanent license. No other regulation to hound them.  In all the above cases suggestions are to adopt approaches with following common denominator:  1)     More choices to people to increase the bargaining power then enjoyed by them presently. This will happen because of dismantling of certain rules/regulations/policies/norms etc.  Now decisions will come from bottom instead of top. It will be truly people’s decision and empowered decision. 2)     Secondly the subsidies through voucher system will provide scope for widening and deepening the markets and choice mechanism thus helping and empowering poor.
