       Planning the Marathon   I checked Active.com, and the registration for the 2005 Spirit of St. Louis Marathon doesn't open until 8am August 15.&nbsp; I'm planning to get online at 8:01am and signup.&nbsp;   I like doing triathlons andwill probably sign up for another one next year, but I think that I'm going to make running my primary focus for the next 6 months after the tri, starting with the half-marathon.&nbsp; I think I'm going to find a 10k for October, and maybe join the StL Track Club for their winter race series.

       I Must Be Crazy   So, here I am, less than 6 months from my first ever race (2004 Spirit of St. Louis 5K - 34:57), and now I've signed up for the Lewis &amp; Clark Half-Marathon on Sept. 18, 2004. I'm trying to work up to the 2005 Spirit of St. Louis Marathon. Then I want to run an ultra next year, too. I think I can do it...if it's a road ultra, at least. I'm looking forward to increasing my mileage slowly. This is the start of my blog to chronicle my training to reach these goals.

       Running "Up" in Forest Park   There is a 6 mile loop (it's actually about 5.7 miles) at Forest Park in St. Louis.  The St. Louis Triathlon Club runs there every Wednesday at 5:30pm, and as a member, I try to get out to run with them.  One way around the park goes up a long hill parallel to Skinker Ave., and the other way goes down.  I run with the club a month ago and went "down" in 1:06 and some seconds (5.70mi).  I figure that I paced myself pretty good that time, I went through the first mile really fast, and that had been my longest run of the year.  Yesterday, we ran "up", and it turns out the distance up is 5.72, but then again, you are running on the outside lane, so that's the difference.  1:04:08!  Good pacing, strong running, and the uphill was only about a minute and a half slower than the overall pace of the run, so that's great.  I'm sure my down time will improve significantly my next time out.  I feel strong and fast at the end of my 4-6 miles runs now, which means the long runs are doing what they are supposed to do.  My asthma is still holding me back during the second and third mile, but I think I'm going out too fast.  I went under 10:00 pace for the first mile again yesterday.  If I didn't have to take so many walking breaks, I think that I would be able to hold 10:xx pace the whole time.  Also, my left calf was killing me yesterday and this morning until I hit it with some cold water in the shower.  Adjusting to my new shoes (Pearl Izumi Push+) is going to be a pain in the ass.  *"Up", "down"...this sounds like the Comrades Marathon...only about 10 times shorter*

       Too Many Days Off   Yeah, that's right, a 5 day layoff.  All that talk about skipping a day, and wanting to run, but, alas, life changed and it was not meant to be.  I hung out with my wife on Friday because she got a day off, and then Saturday I worked for about 9 hours on her car, and I just didn't have the energy to do 9 miles after that.  But I finally ran today.   4.09mi in 48:19.  I finished really strong, and I tried to push through and run most of it, but I just don't have the legs yet for 4 miles straight running. But that's cool. I'm ready to keep up the work. It's all about improving over months, not weeks. I'm looking to improve my speed for the next year. That's the goal. I know the endurance will go up as I crank the mileage up. I think I'll add some speedwork in the form of fartleks or long intervals (800-1600) to finish out this year, maybe even Yasso 800's, and then put snap in my running next year with quarters.  I'm thinking about getting Daniel's Running Formula.  I've heard it's a very good book.

       On Days Not Running...   I don't know how I feel yet about not running and wanting to. I wanted to run yesterday, but I didn't. I figured that I needed to take a day off, because I'd run the two previous days, and then I'm running tonight and the long run (9 miles) on Saturday. I guess I'm okay with that, but it's weird wanting to run and not going. I know that I need to take a day off, and I can't crank up my mileage too fast or I'll hurt myself. That would be bad with only 4 weeks to the triathlon and 6 weeks to the half-marathon. I think I'm starting to get nervous, but I'm not recognizing it yet. I know I can finish both races, and I think I'll hit my time goals (sub-1:20:00 for the tri and under 2:45:00 for the half-marathon -- that's 12:30min/mi pace), so that's not the problem. I'm just not used to this kind of pressure. But it's GOOD pressure, don't get me wrong. Having goals and making plans of this sort is a good thing. And it all leads me toward a healthier, happier life. I kinda like to be a little twisted about all this. It makes me realize how much I want it, and how much I am willing to work for it.

       Going nowhere fast...   I hate treadmill running.  I mean, okay, I know I should be thankful, 'cause I can run anytime, and I never would have gotten started without the treadmill at the Y, but man, time sure does drag, except when I'm on a walk break, and then I forget how long I've walked 'cause I'm too busy listening to music or watching the TV's.  Yes, yes, I know, it's my fault.  I don't have to like it, though.  Here's the details:  4.00 miles - 48:46  On to better stuff...I'm really enjoying this whole running thing.  I started to do this to keep my weight dropping and health and yadda, yadda, but I'm really starting to like it.  And I'm looking at getting a second pair of shoes.  Turns out I underpronate a little, so I'm checking out the Pearl Izumi Push+.  And at only 80 bucks, I can't go wrong.   I think I want to race in October...

       Old Race Reports   This is a copy of my old race report to the Tri-deads.   RR: My very first race (or, Let the sneezing begin).. .  Sorry this is so late. What can I say, I got married two weeks later. :0)  St. Louis Marathon CEO 5K Run/Walk April 3, 2004 Time: 34:57  Short report: Fun race, got to watch the Women's Olympic Marathon Trials beforehand, perfect day to run (sunny and about 70 degrees), and I got enough dust up my nose to sneeze continuously for three days afterwards.  Long report:  I decided a long time ago that I was going to run a couple of 5K's before my first triathlon to test fitness and get some experience out in a race atmosphere, considering I do most of my training by myself. I wanted something big enough that I wouldn't be alone on the course when they picked up the finish line, but I didn't want to have to travel too far to get there. What better choice than a run in St. Louis, which is about 20 min. from my house (even though I live in Illinois). So I signed up for the 5K, a good starters distance I felt (and just slightly longer than the distance of the run for my tri in Sept.), and because I figured I had too much facial hair to sneak into the 1 mile fun run for the kids. I signed up around Dec. and didn't here much back after that, except that packet pickup was to be the day before the race (turns out I got number 20...talk about signing up early!). So I set about increasing my distance slowly, improving my speed, etc. Then the problems started, as they always do. First, I go and get engaged to the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with...there goes 14 whirlwind days of training out the window as I turned from a die-hard training fool into a soft and lovable never-able-to-go-away-from-my-girl fool. Ah, well, it happens, so I wasn't concerned. Ironically enough, my first day back training was...Valentine's Day...go figure. Next comes the exciting world of calf injuries, but I was able to rest and ice and get back on the treadmill to tough it out. Finally, I get to race day. My first ever. And the day of the Marathon Trials. So I wake up early, put down a Snicker's Marathon bar and start sipping on the Gatorade as I drive to the race site in beautiful Forest Park. If you ever come to St. Louis, this is the place to run! Wide bike/walking paths with wonderful scenery and just minutes from downtown (sorry, have to plug my home...Go Cardinals!!!). Anyway, I caught the last 30 minutes of the race and watched as Deena made the team with a second place finish, along with Colleen De Reuck winning and Jen Rhines taking third place. I then cruised over to the starting line of my race to wait out the last hour before it was time to go. Did I mention that drinking 32 oz. of Gatorade and 18 oz. of water an hour before a race does nothing but make you jog to the bathroom for that remain hour? Good times, let me tell you. So, after about 45 minutes of waiting and peeing and peeing some more, my parents showed up to wish me luck and watch my shuffle around in Forest Park. Oh, did I mention that my longest run before this was 5K...in February!!! I was looking forward to the first 2 miles but after that...well, we were just going to see what happened on the way back in. Finally, everyone started to herd over to the road were the race was to begin. I sprinted to the bathroom one last time (turns out that was the fastest I ran all day), and made my way into the crowd. I headed for the back of the pack (ah, home sweet home) and stood around waiting and joking with a few of the people around me. Suddenly, about 2 minutes to 11am, we hear a bang and everyone takes off running...and then stops. It turns out that the tire on a running stroller had popped, and sounded remarkably like a starter's pistol. Well, we stood around a little more and then everyone started to move in front of us. So we took off running. The first 200 meters was a nice downhill trot ("short strides, save the knees") and then onto the back portion of the marathon course, which was flat. Everything went quite smoothly, I was feeling good, and hanging with the guy I was talking to before the race (his name was Bill). We cruised out around a few corners and onto the flat roadways that made up the bulk of the course. The wind was blowing up a lot of dirt that made my eyes sting by the time I got to the water station, which was about halfway through. I can say with some certainity that I did not make it to the first mile markers before the leaders came back through, and we all cheered loudly for them. I was afraid at one point that a few of the thinner ones might be blown off the course from the 10 mph crosswind, but everybody made it out alright. I only had to walk a few times during the race, mostly because I can't drink water from a plastic cup and shuffle at the same time. And I got to spill most of it down the front of my shirt in front of the motorcycle cops watching a group of young, attractive ladies behind me. Yes, yes, I am Mr. Smooth. Lots of fun, nonetheless. It's quite a lot of fun to be able to run with other people. I especially enjoyed picking out the next runner in line and trying to catch them, and then doing it with the next person after I passed them. I finished strong and made sure I shuffled quickly the last 200 meters or so and started to haul @$$ when I saw that I could finish in under 35 minutes. And I did, with a 34:57. WOOHOO! Bill finished just behind me (about 600 meters out we decided to kick it in...yeah, that's what they call it). As soon as I hit the finish line and stopped running the sneezing hit. My nose went off every 15 - 20 seconds for the next four hours. I must have put half of the prairie up my nostrils, because the sneezing didn't subside for three days. I didn't care, through, 'cause I went out and ran and had a great time. The post race bagels from The St. Louis Bread Company hit the spot and I enjoyed myself immensely. I can't wait for the next race.  Have a great day, everybody!!!  Adam

       Chasing the dream...or being chased while dreaming?   So I was out for my run last night, a quick 3 miles before my longer run tonight.  I was pushing harder than usual to try and pick up my average pace, and it was already 7:30pm when I started, so I wanted to go home and eat.  Well, I got out to my turnaround point and found a collection of some kind of flying insect buzzing the trail.  I tried to run around them, and suddenly, I got dive bombed.  So, I turned around and burned rubber to get out of there.  Picture this, me, sprinting down the trail, being buzzed by some kind of bee/wasp/hornet/horsefly at my overwhelming 9 min/mile pace.  Yeah, sue me, I have allergies.   When I got home, I thought about this (searching for the positive).  It must have looked pretty damn funny, actually.  Well, I got a good, hard run in, so I can't complain.  I was also able to calm my breathing after the panting from the initial scare and the subsequent attacks and keep it steady.  That's got to mean something positive.  Here's the details:  3.04 miles - 33:20  In the words of REO Speedwagon: Keep pushing on!!
