      Well, of course I am... Yeah, you guessed. Mutsumi. Who else? I am clumsy, and a bit of a klutz, distracted and anaemic. I like long skirts and daydream a lot. Sometimes I feel like fainting too - but not to the point of others seeing my soul taking off! It seems I do look a bit younger than what I actually am. Could only be her, really. However I might be Shinobu as well, or so that's what Mark thought before Mutsumi came into the scene! (What I am in the end is a female version of Keitaro. And that would most certainly be Mutsumi, right?)  It's a fun quiz really, and quite clever indeedy. I have attached my results below as well as the link - in case you wish to give it a go!      (Oh dear! Are you even sure you answered the questions correctly?) Underneath your confused exterior, you hold fast to your certainties and seek to find the truth about the things you don't know. While you may not be brimming with confidence and energy, you are content with who you are and accepting of both your faults and the faults of others. But while those around you love you deep down, they may find your nonchalance somewhat infuriating. Try to put a bit more thought into what you are doing, and be more aware of your surroundings.    urlLink Which Love Hina Girl Are You?

        (Or would that be "Another Rainy Day in Dun Laoghaire"?)   An uneventful day at work today. Mark is out in Godalming, for a presentation with our SITA bosses. He woke up quite early, around 5h30 or so. I could not sleep very well after that.  Well, the thing is I burnt my tummy with my heat pad (for my interferon injections) some days ago and now it not only looks pretty nasty, as it is quite sore too. I am afraid it's got infected or something. If it persists, I will probably need to go to Dr. Kavanagh before our trip to Rio next week.  (I am tired of going to doctors, although Dr. Kavanagh is really nice and everything. It's just that I am quite fed up with being sick and needing to go to hospitals and GP's almost every month or so...)  And besides that my face has got quite itchy and red today, really annoying. Damn, damn, damn! If you have MS there's always something going on, really. And then you don't know if it's just a normal ailment, or if it's caused - or somehow worsened - by the MS itself.  I've noticed that since I got diagnosed, or maybe even before that (not quite sure now) it's getting harder for me to recover from, say, a cold. Everything seems to last for longer and affects me more. It's a pain in the behind, really...  (Or maybe... Maybe I am just becoming an old wreck and it's not the MS, but purely and simply "old age", ha ha...)  I didn't take a lunch break today because the weather is very very miserable, rainy and windy and chilly, and silly me did not bring an umbrella. Maybe Summer is over, after some 2 or 3 weeks of impeccable sunny and breezy days. Well, we'll be in Rio in only 10 days anyways, so, do not despair Andrea, do not...   What was I saying? Ah yes, since I did not have a lunch break (nor a real "lunch" mind you),  I'm gonna head home in 15 minutes or so, have a nice shower, wash my face and put some calming lotion all over it to see if the "itchy & scratchy" sensation goes away. And pretend I'm in a zombie movie... Actually not! I will just relax. Read some "Love Hina". Then switch on that dishwasher, bring the rubbish down to the garage (important thing!), have my injection, relax, relax, relax (not necessarily in that order)... And, last but not least, wait for Mark.

      I am  so  excited! This is my first post to this weblog thingy.  Welcome !   I have decided to make a weblog myself after Mark started to use  Blogger . I must confess I was a tiny bit jealous, he he! Just a bit...  Ah well, I will try and use this as a diary, for friends and family. However, I'm a bit lazy and don't know if I'm gonna be diligent enough to keep doing it, you know, everyday and so on!  (Will try at least!)  Not much news today, except that i have received a new neko! This one I ordered from  urlLink Cocoro , that great Japanese shop in Toronto. Murakami San is very helpful and, after ordering it on Tursday night, it's been promptly dispatched and arrived today (only 2 business days). Actually this neko is a picture frame. I still need to find someone fluent in Japanese to translate some of the characters for me. Not very likely to succeed here in Ireland, but let's see. If I were in Rio, that would be easy-peasy though.  It arrived broken, because it's quite fragile. The parcel was very well packed of course, but I can imagine how these things may be handled by those people in the airports, mail offices, delivery companies etc, and that in spite of all the "fragile" stickers that have been carefully attached to the boxes... It's a porcelain frame, thus, very likely to get damaged.   Thanks to Mark though, it's all fixed now (husbands are  SO  useful!!!). He used some Super-Glue and voilà! My neko frame is born-again! Here's a pic of my new neko acquistion (ain't that super-cute???)...     I've also ordered some new geta from  urlLink Cocoro .  Geta  are Japanese sandals, made out of wood, this one is paulownia. Right and left foot are the same (differently from our Western shoes that have left and right foot), and they have a silk strap (well, I usually see  geta  with silk straps anyways, but I'm sure they can be made of any other material, or fabric). They are the most comfortable shoes I ever worn, and I use them as flip-flops (I think Ireland is a bit too cold  and wet to go outside wearing them, unfortunately). This one has a black  hanao  ("strap") with an embroidered rabbit, and it looks and feels very nice. I want to take a picture, but now I am a bit tired!   What else for today? Emailed my friend Cíntia, my Mom is going bananas with no email (that Symantec anti-virus is messing up the dialup connection, it seems) and Mark is reading  Love Hina  right now! Who said  Love Hina  is "for gals"??? Nah-nah-nee-nah-nah... Boyz love it too, it seems! (Well, Mark does at least)... I'm also reading it of course, but I am only at volume 8. It's great, I highly recommend it, hilarious indeed. I will tell more in my next posts, hopefully.  Well, Good Night, if I'm not too lazy/too tired and things like that, see ya tomorrow...  Yaaawwwnnnn...

      It's been a long time since my last blog. As expected, I did not post anything while I was in Rio. We had a great time there, and this time I was completely relaxed, not worrying too much, about anything!   I need to tell about all the things we saw and did in those 2 weeks, skipping of course the travel in our way in! That was a nightmare! But at least we got all the suitcases and very quickly this time. But it was horrendous. At least this time Mark was with me. When it happened last year, I was travelling alone. They even put me at the Sheraton, with a wonderful bedroom, flip-flops and a fluffy bathrobe. But all I could do was crying, so stressed I was...   I was sick when we were there, as usual with a cough/cold. It seems this cough will never go away. And also, the bruise/burn in my tummy became very nasty and I needed to go to a Dermatologist there. She said it almost got necrosed! And prescribed me some topic antibiotic, which has improved things since the very first day. Well, not completely healed yet, but almost there.   We came back to Ireland on Saturday, arrived here last Sunday. All very tiring, but I happened to meet a lovely girl in the plane, Cristiane. She is a Brazilian living in Bristol, and we had a very nice chat. It was great. I will email her this weekend.   I was not very well this week and have been to my GP yesterday. It's the fatigue caused by my condition, and besides I was also quite dizzy and a bit nauseous today. So, I did not go to the office today, nor the day before yesterday. I expect to be back on Monday, as soon as I am recovered.   Mark is renting a car this weekend and tomorrow we'll go to a  Serono  training in the City Centre. They are releasing a new injector that hopefully will make these injections easier and, who knows, not as sore.   Now, it's time to go and read a bit, after a nice shower with lots of lemony shampoos and my new Molton Brown shower gel. Is there anything better than lots of lemony, citrussy, fresh bath stuff when it's Summer?? I love it, I feel very invigorated with these green scents... And I finally managed to get a bottle of  "Hierbas de Ibiza"  today, so, I am all fresh and comfy now...   Good Night now!

      Hello!  I didn't post anything these days, because I was sick (again!). Yes, on Tuesday and also yesterday, but now I just don't want to talk about it!  Today is the first day of my Hols! Mark is still working though, for officially his vacations start on Monday.  I am here trying to make a pancake, I know I am a lousy cook, but I will give it a try. I forgot to ask Mark if I need to stir the mixture (he prepared it yesterday, so it's just taking it off the fridge) and, in those 10 minutes where the pan is heating, when exactly do I need to add the butter! Ah well, I will try anyways.  We are leaving home at 16h30 to go the airport! Cannot wait to get to Rio! Bringing some more manga and also "Big Fish" to read in the plane! Great!  And I want to spread the news about a new manga that's being released this week by Tokyopop: "Princess Ai". It seems quite interesting and it's also been co-written by Courtney Love. The artwork is very cool, as everything you can expect from   urlLink Tokyopop  . If you are interested, please check this link for a preview (it contains the very first chapter of the book for your appreciation):    urlLink http://www2.fanscape.com/tokyopop/player.asp    I personally liked the graphics VERY much. And will certainly add it to my Amazon Wish List, he he!  Well... Now back to the pancakes. I messed it up. It was too big and it broke when I turned it up. But it was great, really. Horrible, but tasty. And finally, the 2nd pancake was burnt because I forgot to add more butter to the pan. Living and learning. Now I know, and the next time it will not be as bad, I am sure!  Well, talk to you now when I get to Rio! Sayonara!
