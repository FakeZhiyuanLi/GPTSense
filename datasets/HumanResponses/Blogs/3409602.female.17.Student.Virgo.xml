      I..kinda miss my ex a little..He's back to Indonesia to acc his Parents.. and i feel kinda weird..Bcos when we were together,he once left for Indo also.. that time was a rough time for us..*sigh* We were basically calling each other everydae..and i spend quite a sum of money trying to call him back from here..I wrote letters for him everydae,and put it in a box..with Love seeds..a shirt i bought for him,lyrics from songs..poems i created..and touching love messages.. At that time SARS was going on quite badly..and i made paper stars for him.In each strip of paper i wrote,praying to god,that he would come back safely from where he was,and i would gladly exchange half of my life for that..Stupid yeah? I guess love goes beyond all sacrifices,life or death..For when i love someone,i give my all,even when the tremendous hurt i recieve makes me wanna leave the world behind..  To the world, You may be one person. But to me, You may be the whole world.  Maybe thats wad it means..that how insignificant someone can be in this vast world.. yet when that special someone appears into yr life,it makes him/her seem like he/she is everything in the world..That even if the world was to be destroyed,all in yr heart that you care was the person that u loved.  When i reached into my pocket, i found that i was penniless. I was poor *so i think*, Till the dae i found you, For then, I realised, That i was the richest person in this whole world.  SOme things are wad money can't buy.Some things are never as precious until they were gone.Don't let the one u loved shed a tear,tell the person how much u care,for you never noe wad is going to happen tomorrow.Love hurts,especially when it's gone,without telling the other person how much u really cared deep in yr heart. *~.(,")Princess^Tiara(",).~*

      Today is 21/05/2004...And the last day of school..Quite sad you see,for i wun get to see my *beloved* frenx for a period of time..Yeah,we can still go out,but i guess it wun be like seeing each other everydae.. I love holidays,cos i could take a break...Sleep late..Watch tv progs till dawn.. and just do wadever i like..but...i really dread the feeling of being alone..Alone at home, alone on the streets,alone in my heart,my world...It doesn't feel good,like oil that can't be merged together with water(the groups of ppl out there*water*,me alone*oil*)...*sigh*!! If i could say why it would be becos during my sec sch daes,i abandon my frenx for love,love that i tot would last for an eternity,but i was so wrong.. thruout the years,12 exs,did i noe that love hurts,and could even make me do things that i would never dreamt of doing..hurting myself.If time could go back,i wish to tell my frenx how i regretted my choice of decision,and how i wish i could go back to the daes when we go out as a grp and enjoy,have fun..I realli miss them alot..*sob* Now,today,i oni have my classmates,of which my two sistas,Jane and Jieni,are the closest to my heart.I wish to tell them i cherish them alot and i don wish to lose them,but it seems kinda weird? I have my guy too..and i thank him for standing by me and loving me so much..i wish to tell him that i would give my all and love him with everything i have..and i wish to see him happy being with me.. *another new chapter unfolds, to bring abt the pains and happiness in life*
