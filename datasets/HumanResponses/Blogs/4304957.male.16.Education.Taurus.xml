      People this is my very own new blog, wish me luck! It's the holidays and I'm bored..freakin bored!!! I have no plans at all, still thinking of what's there for me to do. Everyone's enjoying their weekend and I'm stuck at home doing nothing till I found this page where I can post anything I want to feel my friends up with my latest infos.  A few months before,I was such a busy guy digging my head into works and activities in school. And I have to try catching up all the lessons I've missed in class. But now it's a totally different world compared to those busy days.  I was hoping to write more but I don't know what else to say. I've squeeze my brain and nothing came. I hope this is a nice start and a "  not so boring  " blog.   People!!! Do not hesitate to post any comments, whether it's good or bad I'll still take it in without any hard feelings.

      Finally...I did it!! I finally solve the problem of posting my pictures. Of course, without the help of my friend I wouldn't have succeeded. A very big thanks to you, Ashley. Oh..who's Ashley? This goes a long way back till end of May, when I was at a forum, District 308 B2 Leo forum to be exact. She's kinda cute and damn pretty...Oohh her smile!! Ok, snap out of it! (Poof) Well, I think I'll have to post a picture of her to prove what I said...  Talk about the forum, I missed those days a lot. Hanging out with guys ang gals you just happend to know that they're so damn cool and friendly. Well, I guess I'll definitely go down to Klang to visit this buch of so called " monkeys " or " chimpanzees ". No offense guys, but it's really fun having to spend my time with you all. I just couldn't bare the thoughts of eing there with them again, having a freakin good time!! Woah!!! Yeah!!!  To know why I said it's fun hanging out with them, just take a look at those pictures and you'll understand..

      At last, it seems like an eternity for my life here is boring!!  (Actually just a few days)  My life saver is here. At least there's something for me to do. What's that?! Helping my grandmother during the prayers of the Hungry Ghost Festival and dinner at night. (Pathetic Huh?!) Actually my main target/purpose is to get the lucky draw prizes. I don't know whether it's true but I think God punished me for being so greedy. I hevven't got any prizes the whole night. (Serves me right!!!)  Finally, I got those pictures taken during my friend's birthday party. I have no idea but it seems to me that I'm the only one who look the oldest there. (Aww man) I don't wanna look old. Mature is enough. And Yeah!! I have some new pictures that I've just taken today. I'll post them in later.  I've just heard a bad news. A friend of mine (Jack a.k.a Kin) just told me that if he's not on line tomorrow, he will not be online anymore-MSN Messenger. I have no idea why but I feel sad. I want to know his reason not because I'm a busy body like someone who wants to stick his head into someone else's business, I just care about him. I don't know why but maybe it's because he's nice to me. Wish he can get through all his troubles. And I wish him best of luck in his SPM and hope he doesn't get too stressful doing his revision.
