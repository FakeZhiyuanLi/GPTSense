      I will gladly add in any moments that people post but here is what I came up with.  --The infamous "I'm gonna get mine" game, where David Farrar told his friends he would score 30 points no matter what it took. He went 11-25 from the field (3-7 from 3). He finished with 25 in the 108-41 victory. David after the game had the audacity to then argue that he did not get enough shots even though Jeff took 20. Jeff also made 18 for a 37 point night.  --In the first 100 point game by the Quakers, Matt Vaught pulled a Lattneresque performance out by going 10-10 from the field. Even after the 101-25 schlacking the PG for the opposing team had the nerve to tell Jeff that "you guys really aren't that good."  --In the losers bracket championship Daniel Entzminger proved his worth by going 4-6 in a 5 minute span form behind the arc to clinch the teams first birth in the championships.  --Danny gave everyone of things to come in the upcoming year when he blocked Ben (no idea how to spell his last name). Ben was by far the best 1 on 1 player in all of IM. Ben was driving into the middle of the lane to shoot yet another floater over Jeff in the last few seconds of the game and Danny with his 12 inch vertical swatted his shot to save the game.  --As stated below in the history section, Danny and Jeff were discussing basketball strategy over a series of RBI Baseball. (to this day the greatest baseball game ever, Danny don't play with the cards) Danny and Jeff came up with the greatest defensive scheme known to man, the 1-2-2 trap. It forced Ben to pass the ball which he didn't do and shot 6-16 from the field and gave the Quakers their first championship.  --In the Quakers first attempt at 3 on 3, they reached the championship game where it looked as though things were going to be close until the start of the second half. Jeff had dominated the first half and the other team decided to double team and make Danny and Trent shoot. (shaking head in amazement) Danny and Trent started off the second half going 9-10 from behind the arc and clinching the Quakers first ever 3 on 3 championship.

      The Hustlin' Quakers were started with one thing in mind: WINNING.  After many days and nights of debating, arguing and RBI baseball, Jeff and Danny finally decided on the name that will always be remembered as long as Campbell is around.  The only back-to-back IM champs in the modern era. (since Andy Shell has been there)  Jeff and Danny set out to build a team that could have a chance of winning.  With two pieces of the puzzle in place.  J and D set their eyes on landing the top free agent that off-season, Trent Welch.  Trent turned down numerous higher paying offers from the Tyrants to play with this start up franchise.  Trent brought along with him a key contributor to the Quakers for three seasons, Kevin Reardon.  With the additions of Matt Vaught, the prototypical PF in the Quaker system and Ben Levesque, a physical specimen with great athletic ability (who left people in the hospital, literally) the Quakers were ready for their first Intramural season at Campbell.  The Quakers were virtually unknown and were the dark horses of the 2001-2002.  After a terrific season, marred by one humiliating loss to the Tyrants, the Quakers were very confident that they could get to the championship game At the start of the tourney, the co-founders both made bold predictions that the Quakers would lose to the Tyrants but beat them on championship night.  After watching the Tyrants slide past the Dynasty, Jeff and Danny devised what should go down as one of the greatest coaching moves EVER, of all time: The 1-2-2 defense.  With their new "genius" plan nothing could stop the Quakers, except one man, David Farrar(ararar) who fired up a pointless 3 that lost possession of the ball for the Quakers and allowed the Tyrants to tie the game and eventually win in OT.  Despite this set back, the Quakers regained their composure, edged out the Pharmacy team and made it back to the championship where the 1-2-2 did its job and gave the Quakers their first championship.  The 2002-2003 showed Jeff and Danny's recruiting abilities.  Myth has it in a talk with Jared Fries before Christmas, Jeff asked Jared what he was doing for the next season and Jared's response: "Not playing with this damn team."  Jared had his many critics around the league and Jeff and Danny were laughed at for picking him up.  The consensus was Jared is not that good of a big man who canâ€™t score and cant defend anyone.  What everyone failed to see was Jared's ability to play off of Jeff.  Letting Jared fly under everyone's radar was the perfect fit for him.  Every team was so worried about Trent and Jeff that they failed to realize that Jared and Danny were burying them.  Midway though November the Quakers were killing teams by 20+ margins. Some teams took it better than others, but the most memorable poor-sportsmanship award goes to the Naturals for injuring Kevin at the end of yet another blow out game. Kevin suffered by far the worst Quaker injuries ever, after his legs were taken out from underneath him as he went in for a lay-up. Kevin had to have staples for the gash in his head and broke a wrist and sprained a wrist in the process. The Quakers would play without Kevin 3 straight games over a two-month healing time. The second season like the one before had its own blemish (outside of injuries).  The Mandingos, a team with two coaches (both of whom played collegiate basketball) and Mike Craven, defeated the Quakers by six but did not have the team work to move out of the second round of the playoffs.  At the time Scott Smith, a member of the Mandingos and future Quaker, never saw the floor and was not utilized.  The Quakers trounced all competition in the playoffs and ran away with the banner beating WHAT?!? by 15.  While the night was an enormous triumph, it did have one setback.  Jeff, the Horse, was thrown to the ground and suffered a slight separated shoulder and a cut above his left eye.  Jeff, even with these injuries, had the trainers wrap up his head in a gay pink bandage and checked himself back into the game (even though he was only mere 84.3%).  The 2003-2004 season looked as though the Quakers were going to be unstoppable.  The loss of Danny, Chip and Brad seemed to be filled by Doug, Pat and Scott.  The loss of Danny was a lot further reaching than once thought.  Both Trent and Jared throughout the season made the comments "We would be killing people if Danny were here."  Even with the problems the Quakers still breezed through the season undefeated. A mark never achieved by any other Quaker team before.  The playoffs showed that this Quaker team was not ready, struggling through injuries in the guard positions and finding they hadn't had to win in the face of adversity yet.  They kept winning but not by margins they were of previous years.  Leading into the winner's bracket championship game, point guard and newly appointed assistant captain, Trent Welch got himself suspended for the first 10 minutes of the game.  After warm ups, Jeff told Trent "Your ass is at the scorer's table right at that ten minute mark and you owe me."  Trent came out with by far one of his best performances ever. He scored 24 points on 9-12 shooting and had 6 assists.  Trent led the way to a 58-44 victory.  The championship game looked as if the Quakers never showed up and has since been forgotten by one and all.  The up coming season looks as though it has a bright future.  Trent and Jeff the elder statesmen of the team are looking to regain their top spot in IM (to match the top spot they own in flag-football).  Jared's departure has left a HUGE hole at PF but a bright young star, Nolan Garner could be emerging into this less revered, but essential spot.  Jeff has finally made an offer that couldnâ€™t be refused and Will Houghton will finally be joining the team, along with his former "William Faulkner" teammate- Drew.  The latest acquisition of Hunter Dawson should fill the 3-point void this year, as the Quakers make run number four for the Championship.
