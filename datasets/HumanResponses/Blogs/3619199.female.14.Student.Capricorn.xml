      my sister is gay. my sister is a lesbian. my sister is not straight. my sister likes other girls. Jesus Christ O'Mighty i can say it over and over again, yet i can't make any sense of it. Gay. She's gay.  I don't get it. I don't understand how she can be gay now. I don't understand any of this. She's gay. It still doesn't click with me. She's a lesbian. I don't get it. I don’t know how I really feel about it. I mean she is my sister and all, but I don’t know what to think about her sexuality. When she first told me I was shocked, but I went along with it. I pretended I was fine and everything, but I’m not. I remember telling her before, how I thought gay marriage and all that stuff was great, and if two people love each other it doesn’t matter if they are the same gender. whatta bunch of bull shit. The fact is, I’m fine w/  other  people being bi or gay, but not her. I hate myself for being like this, how Slim Shady, but I can’t help it. I don’t know what the big deal is; I mean I was fine before she told me! It’s just now whenever we are watching TV or something and a girl appears, it always seems like she is checking her out (though she probably isn’t). I guess I should have seen this coming when she was always the first to watch the Victoria Secret Fashion Show(note to self: burn all catalogs containig women in underwear), but how was I to know.  I just wish I could pop some “heterosexual pills” in her mouth, and make her straight again. I don't think she ever was straight. When I think about it, I really don't know who my sister is. I've known her for all my life, without knowing her. Who knows what else she's been keeping for me, she could have three nipples for all i know! Okay, that's a little far fetched, but i really can't think rationally right now. Apparently, she's known for sometime now, i guess she was trying to get in touch with her inner Melissa Ethridge or something. Now she's a full blown rainbow-flag waving homo. Shame on me. I should be happy for her, she's not lying to herself anymore. But I can't help but be pissed. I don't know exactly why I'm pissed, but I am. I guess I had this little fantasy that me and my sis would finally go to college together and double date and talk about boys and laugh and giggle about the hottest guys on campus. I can't really picture myself going all gigglely over a guy or really wasting time talking about one, but still. Now I  never  have a chance to do that with her. I had this stellar fairytale world for us, now it's gone. I'm so selfish, all i can say is I I I I. I can't even take the time to see how she's feeling about coming out. I'm starting to think that i don't know a fucking thing about anyone anymore. Or anything, for that matter.

       vacation all i ever wanted  vacation had to get away  vacation meant to be spent alone!   Sorry guys, i just had a little "go go" moment.  There is a logical explanation for my sudden outburst of song (even though listening to the go go's isn't logical, just plain suicidal). I recently got back from vacation in Florida. Me and my family went to panama city beach for a little "bonding time". I actually expected the worse (hey, I like bonding with my family as long as we don't have to do it together) It's like some guy once said "there's no such thing as fun for the whole family". But to be honest (which is hard for me), i had a surprisingly fun time. Oh gawd, i can't believe i just wrote that. Quick, everyone run for shelter, Armageddon is NEAR!!!! But to be serious (which, is also extremely difficult for me), the vacation wasn't that bad. I guess i thought it would be one of those things where my parents would try to "get to know me" or "understand my transition from child to teenager" ya know, the basic Dr. Phil crap.  i was wrong. My dad didn't spend countless hours hounding me about responsiblity and my mom didn't go into one of her long "womanhood" speeches(which i am very thankful for). We just spent most of the time at the beach (no crap) horsing around (ha, i said "horsing around" i never say that!, okay i officially lost my mind, come to think of it, i never had it *ponders for a second* maybe i should look into getting one, they're probably rare nowadays).  Well i'm going to take some time to look for a brain. There was a lot of other things that happened to me on the trip, and i saw some, dare i say "interesting" people too, but i'm to tired to talk about it now (hey, vampires need there beauty sleep too, and i need as much as i can get). so i'll tell ya'll more later. I know you guys are on the edge of your seats (maybe you guys should be looking for brains too).   ............ vacation all i ever wanted, vacation had to get away    DAMN THAT SONG!  chow for now

      i've been readin' a lot of blogs lately (duh) and it seems like a lot of people are still in school right now or getting ready for summer vacation. I just got out of school maybe two or three weeks ago, and it feels like heaven (well actually heaven couldn't compare to this).  But from reading some of the blogs I've come to find that a lot of people  really  will miss being out of school for the summer. Now i personally find that insane (and trust me, i know insane)! I mean high school isn't all that bad (who the hell am I kidding it is), it's just I don't understand what's so  good  about it. It seems like the worst time of our lives instead of the best.  My mom says I should cherish my time in high school. Simply because I don't have to worry about responsiblity or a job, instead, i can just "find" myself! Well no offense to my mom, BUT WHAT THE FUCK! I'm so friggin' tried of trying to "find" myself, i never really  lost  myself, i think the problem is I don't  know  myself. If that makes any sense. On the other hand, I don't want to be 95 years old looking for my teeth on the porch and wondering why my high school years were so misreable (okay that's a little graphic). I guess high school is what you make of it. And right now I'm not exactly making the best of it.  Maybe it's not high school that sucks, but the people at high school that suck or the one's at mine anyway. My high school is full of little cliques such as the following: Preps Jocks Punks Freaks Druggies Nerds And everyone in between I'm bascially an outkast. Which is quite alright with me. All my friends are outkast too, so maybe that's my clique. The Misfits, The Unwanted, The Undesirable, The Losers, (i could go on all day). But when I think about it, all of those clique are so cliche. then again, this is high school I'm talking about.  Here are some of the main people who make other people's lives like mine a living hell.  Species: Snotnoseus Bitchus Common Features: Blonde hair  Characteristics: Never found to far away from a mirror, the species know as snotnoseus bitchus (more commonly know as cheerleaders) truly run the school. They like to give other people shit (because they can) and when bored they gossip about who is screwing who. With their Iqs lower than the temperature in Alaska, the snotnoseus bitchus are only good for one thing, sex (mostly with “jockus dickus”). They adore themselves, and despise people who aren’t like them. Natural Habitat: The Mall  Species: Jockus Dickus Common Features: Letterman Jackets Characteristics: While not all the of the jocks are complete dicks, their still is huge amount. The jockus dickus (mostly football players) are know to be complete and total jerks. They constantly bully kids who are smaller and weaker for no good reason, and they give no mercy. Not all of them are stupid, but they have exceptions. Most of their conversations include content about sex, and the only math they know are the size of their dicks. Natural Habitat: In the “Snotnoseus Bitchus" Pants  Species: Teacherus Devilus Common Features: there is vary of features, but they are mostly found with Detention Slips in hand Characteristics: Since the teacherus devilus control the school they are the main hell raisers. Some of them are cool but most of them want to fuck you up. They all work together to make students life a living hell and they won’t rest until the job is done. The ring leader is the Principal (or Head Bastard). Natural Habitat: THEY ARE EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  well there are plenty of others that i could go on and on about, but I'm pretty much bitched out for now. Maybe if I was a little more optimistic about this whole high school thing, i wouldn't be writing this. It's sorta like this quote I read from a book somewhere "The problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the problem." Well Chow For Now

      Question. Is it offensive, if you write a stupid comment on someone else's blog? I don't think so. Maybe it's extremely annoying, but  offensive  sounds like a pretty strong word.  One person actually emailed me (when my email address was open to the public), and told me that a comment I made on their blog actually  offended  them. But how can that be? I just joked around and suggested "therapy", no big deal right? Well, apparentley it is. I think what's offensive, and what's not, is pretty much subjective.  It's all really in opinion. Maybe the solution to this situation, is for me to stop commenting on blogs altogether. Fat Chance. I don't get why everyone is so uptight. I mean it was just a joke for god sakes (not a funny one, but a joke none the less). If the person I "offended" would just take the screw driver out of his ass, maybe he wouldn't have been so offended. Plus you can trash comments if you want to, just click the handy dandy garbage can, and BOOM it's gone! The point is this: I'm annoying, silly, and usually bored, so get used to my so called offensive comments. No blog is safe when I'm around, you might be my next victim (but I wouldn't lose to much sleep over it) I'm really not like this in my everyday life. I'm actually very introverted (it's always the quiet ones). Plus this is the friggin internet we're talkin' about here, you guys have to expect this kind of thing. I know blogs aren't meant for people's silly or "unwanted" comments, they are meant for thoughts, ideas, rants and raves. But who really cares. If you have a comment box, you should expect dumb comments. This is the human race we are talkin' about, there's stupid people! I just so happen to be one of them! So to make a pointless post more pointless, I'm not going away anytime soon, so you people can do one of three things 1. Get The Hell Over It 2. Ignore it all together (not that hard) or 3. Just Go FUCK YOURSELVES! (i think most people would prefer the first two choices, but I'm sure some people wouldn't mind doing that last one) Chow for now

      It's amazing the things people do when they are bored. I mean, who was the first person to say "I'm going to squeeze these thing-y's on this here cow, and drink what comes out", they must have been really bored, but they discovered MILK! That reminds me, i hate milk.  Anyway something is really bothering me. I've been getting a lot of pop-ups lately and they have all been about the following: Viagra Dating Advertisments The Atkins Diet Polls on how long J.lo's marriage will last and links to get porn I'm starting to think the internet revolves around sex. Maybe it's the  world  that revolves around it, but why? Everywhere you look there are online dating services and websites on how to get laid. And god only knows how many porn sites there are! I really don't understand the whole "porn" thing. I've never been on xxx site before, but i get the occasional online ad. I don't see the point really. What, do you just jack-off to the sight of naked woman and men touching each other? Well I guess everyone needs a sexlife, even if it is with themselves. But why does it seem like so many people are addicted to sex? Maybe it's me, but I can't help but think that sex is a drug. It actually seems like everyone is doing it except me. I'll probably be the worlds last virgin (next to Carrot top on the 1-800-ATT commercials). But that the least of my worries. Anyway, it seems like nowadays everyone is counting carbs or starting fad diets. Everyone is so obsessed with what they look like (it seems like it's always been that way). Every soda now comes in "diet", and there are more "makeover" shows than ever. Now, that's not a bad thing, but it's not a totally good thing either. It seems like the people (mostly women) who get on these "diets", don't wanna be healthy, but want to be a carbon copy of a victoria secret model.  What I'm saying isn't anything new, but it's not getting old anytime soon.  Whoa, this is turning out to be longer than I expected it to be. I'll stop preachin' now, I must be really bored.  To bad I don't live on a farm, I feel like milkin' something. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

      I've been listening to the radio for about a couple of hours now, and I can't help but notice a pattern. Almost all the songs are about love! That seems obvious, but I never really realised that there were so many songs dedicated to that one subject alone.  I mean, you have the "why don't you love me" tune or the classic "i can't live without your lovin'" ballad. After awhile it gets pretty old. So here's my top 5 list of the worst love songs ever. They might be break up songs, they might be make-up songs. But they have one thing in common, THEY SUCK!  5. "Achy Breaky Heart" - Billy Ray Cyrus The worst thing about this song is the Title itself. "Achy" seems like a word a 5 year old came up with, but even a 5 year old wouldn't want to listen to this song.  4. "Baby One More Time"- Britney Spears This song is so bad b/c it's so catchy. It's one of those songs that gets permantely stuck in your head. You find yourself singing it in the shower, or humming it at the grocery store. It's also one of those songs that you can't help listening to when no one is around (guilty pleasure song).   3. "Tearin' Up My Heart"- Nsync Song from a boy band. Need I say more.  2.  "My Heart Will Go On"- Celine Dion I have to admit, I actually liked this song at first. But it was played way to much. Talk about overkill. After awhile, Celine's voice gets annoying, and you find yourself gouging your eyes out with a spoon.  1.  "Take My Breath Away"- Jessica Simpson Talk about ruining a classic song. This song used to be great when it was done by Berlin, now it just sucks. Jessica sounds like she has a cold, yet the listener is the one who gets sick to the stomach.  Well there you have it, my top 5 list of the worst love songs ever. There are loads of other songs that could have been on the list, but I'm still trying to block them out.  Chow for now

      What is the point of summer vacation, if you are a required to do something for school? I thought the whole idea of summer was to do nothing but watch soap operas and talk shows all day, and party all night! I guess my concept was wrong.  I am "required" to read two books by the end of summer break. One for my Honors Literature Class and another just so my school can torture students.  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of reading (it is fundamental afterall), but I hate being told to read. I rather do something b/c I want to, not b/c I have to. It makes it much harder for me to read a book, knowing that I'll get tested on it when I go back to school. This summer I have to read The Count of Mounte Cristo  & Picasso at the Lapin Agile: and other plays  Now, that's nothing compared to what I had to read last summer. If any of you have ever read Great Expectations you'll know the hell I had to go through. If you haven't read it don't "expect" to much from it, you'll be asleep after chapter 1. The book was so dull I could hear my hair grow, but I eventually tore all of it out from extensive boredom. Anyway I've actually already started reading Picasso at the Lapin Agile, and it's surprisingly funny. It's by the actor Steve Martin (so I was a little reluctant at first), but it's hilarious! Here's a funny quote from the play  " Sagot- I know that there are two subjects in paintings that no one will buy. One is Jesus, and the other is sheep. Love Him as much as they want, no one really wants a painting of Jesus in the living room. You're having friends over the sofa. Somehow it doesn't work. And not in the bedroom either, obviously. I mean, you want Jesus watching over you, but not while you're in the missionary position..............."  I thought it was weird that this was one of the books to choose from on the reading list, but I'm glad I picked it. Most of the girls chose "A Walk To Remember". I saw the movie, and it was just a little to "touched by an angel" for me. I mean the plot is way to Danille Steele   "weird girl" meets  "cool guy" they fall in love "cool guy" finds out that "weird girl" is dying *crying scene* cool guy" marries "weird girl" she dies we all cry THE END For some reason that story line isn't to appealing to me, wonder why? *ponders* Oh i know why, CUZ IT SUCKS!!

I've noticied that not a lot of people comment to people's blogs (or maybe they do, and they get trashed)! Well feel free to comment to my post, though i really don't care about your opinion!  But You HAVE TO FOLLOW THESE RULES 1. They have to be stupid (that's not askin' much from you guys) 2. They have to be vulgar (i hate sweet comments! if you don't have anything nice to say, comment on my blog!) 3. They have to be in english (what can I say, i haven't takin' foriegn language classes yet) 4.  They have to be short (I have a short-attention span) And The Last Rule Is....................... 5.

      I'm going to write down my thoughts and ideas, and complete strangers will be reading every bit of it! Now, that doesn't sound so great when it's written out, but wtf! I don't know why I'm starting a blog, actually I don't know a lot of things, maybe that's my problem! Okay this is for all you people out there who have such lack of lives that you have to read about mine. The following is info about me   Species: The US did testing on me, so that's not a good sign Name: Uh, Can't remember Age: Not Legal Sex: Still Virgin Race: I thought color didn't matter? Height: Anyone got a ruler? Weight: Still measuring my height Dating Status: Today is June 12, 2004 Hair Color: I didn't learn my colors in kindergarden, so take a wild guess Eye Color: Let me get my mirror Characteristics: Aren't characters from cartoons? Hobbies: Doing things that I like to do  Well now you know me! Geez, you guys probably know more about me now, then I know about myself! Wait that doesn't make sense............Nevermind!

      God bless the man responsible for the creation of Welch's Fruit Snacks! I've eaten about three packs of them now, and I'm addicted. I wonder if it's  real  fruit I'm eating (probably not, cuz i never like to eat anything healthy). The ingredients are  Juice from concentrates  corn syrup sugar modified corn starch citric acid carnauba wax (...that sounds weird) alpha tocopehrol (what the hell) and some other things I can't pronouce, let alone take the time to type out. There is also a phone number on the back to call for any "Comments or Questions". Do people actually call? What would they possibly have to say that's half interesting. "HI, This is Darci from ohio, i just love the fruit snacks!" yeah, that sounds great. I would call in and say "Hey what the hell is up with these fucking fruit snacks, they give my dad gas and my mom grew a sixth toe on her left foot that resembles a small grape! By the way your  "berries 'n cherries" flavored snacks are delicious!" Okay, i would never do that, but someone should. I bet those poor people working the phones are dying of boredom. I would have strangled my self with a phone cord by now.............. Anyway, i finally got out of my house, well I made it to mailbox that is. I was planning on taking a walk around my neighborhood for so much needed air, but then i realized I would be  walking , and I'm to damn lazy for such an extreme thing like that. But i think my little trip from the front door to the mailbox is a major improvement (i usually never make it pass the driveway). Thank god for high metabolism. Anyway, I didn't feel like going back inside, so i circled my house a few times. It was a very educational experience. I learned that I actually had a backyard! and it has grass and flowers, just like the front yard (yeah, i know, i'm still taking it all in). wow, it's amazing the things you learn when you go outside. Who knows what else is out there, i could have sprinkler system for all i know (god forbid). j/k.  I think I need some more fruit snacks, it's been about 5 minutes, and I'm already having withdrawal symptoms chow 4 now

       Damn you, vile woman, you've impeded my work since the day I escaped your wretched womb.                                                            -Stewie Griffin, The Family Guy   I swear I have to get out of this house! Well it's 11:20 p.m., so it's not like i could if I tried, dare to dream. Anyway, my mom is starting to bug the hell outta me (love her as much as I do, but the woman really is crazy!). Today she kept nagging me about "keeping the house tidy" and all that shit. Now you guys may not think that sounds bad, but you obiviously don't no my mom (you lucky bastards).  I think it's time i introduce ya'll to the half of my parents who's responsible for my birth, and loss of sanity   My Mom Aka The Dirt Nazi Characteristics: my mom can be funny sometimes, but other times she’s just a pain in the ass. She likes to sing (though she sounds like a monkey on acid), dance, and have a good time, but she tries to hard. She is a generally good person, but I think she saves her rage for me (what an honor). She is the complete opposite of my dad and I sometimes wonder why they are still together. She is a clean freak and expects everything to be “spick and span”.  If someone doesn’t put their dirty shirt into the laundry after they’ve taken a bath, it’s like committing a sin to her. I think there might be a bible out there called “The Holy Book of House Cleaning”, cause she must be a “Cleanist” or “Neat Freakist” if so I’m definitely not converting, I’m perfectly fine with practicing the rituals of Slacker-ism. Apart from being a neat freak, my mom is overly emotional. Well maybe that’s exaggerating a bit, but she can definitely cry up a storm and flood the streets if she’s having a “moment”. I have to admit though, I am a bit emotional myself, it’s probably biological, damn you mom!  I guess if I look pass her insane cleaning antics and “pass me the Kleenex” episodes my mom is a pretty cool chick, *thinks for a moment* nope she's still a crazy nazi.

       Dip it low, pick it up slow Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back roll Pop, pop, pop that thang I'mma show you how to make your man say, "Oh"   why are all the dumb ass songs so addictive! "dip it low" by Christina Milian is probably one of the stupidest songs I have ever heard, yet i can't get it out of my head! It sounds more like a workout than a sex act. I would break my friggin' back tryin' to do all that crazy shit! After all that "rollin' around" and "pokin' it out" it I would need to call 911! I swear, songs like that have subliminal messages tracks in them. cuz there's no other logical explanation for actually listening to them. I just try to listen to the beat and not the words. Most rap and r&b songs are like that anyway. stupid lyrics and awesome beats. if people would actually take the time to listen to what some of these artist are saying, they might not like the song so much. the thing that annoys me the most is the use of the "n" word (don't act like y'all don't know what i'm talkin' about). i don't understand why it's okay for us to call each other that, but when a person outside of our race says it, we get all pissed. I hate when another black person calls me a ni-----, it's so unnecessary. The funny thing is, most white people are the ones buying the music, which really cracks me up. so what happens if a white person is singing along to a rap song and the word ni--er comes up, is he suppose to just skip over that part? i just wish rap (well some of it) wasn't so stupid, and had some meaning to it. well i guess not all rap is completely pointless. Thank God for Outkast and Kanye West! They are probably the best hiphop/rap artist out there right now.  oh well chow for now

      school starts tommorrow. I will officially be a sophomore in high school.  I still can't process it.  I've been dreading this day forever now, and it's here.  The day before I start school.  Most people dread the actual first day of school, but it's always pre-school anxiety with me. I'm left alone with my own thoughts (and thoughts meaning thinking, and, well thinking is something that is a rarity for me). My mind is in a fragile state right now, and I need some support. Okay I'll cut the crap, basically I'm nervous about starting school. Hm, 'nervous', I don't think that is the right word for this particular emotion, but I really don't know what is. It's indescriable really. I guess I would say that it's kind of like a mixture of dread, nervousness, and ......................maybe even exictement? I don't know why the hell I would be exicted to go back to school. I mean for god sakes this is  high school,  but I swear that I have something in the pit of my stomach.  Butterflies?  No, probably just what I had for lunch. I really shouldn't have had that 6th bag of Doritos, and maybe the moldy bagel was pushing it  That has to be the reason. I don't have any other explanation. Well, any logical one.  I don't know. I just keep thinking that  maybe  this year could be different.  God, I don't want to even think about last year. Being a freshmen.  Why the hell did I think it would be so great. I guess I was too caught up inside the world of teen movies and MTV, to realize what high school was about, and for some reason, Dawson Creek eps. didn't come close.  Freshman year just wasn't what I had planned. I swear to god, I couldn't have made it if it wasn't for the coke machines. The only thing to look forward to was the chance of getting a free Sprite from the machine, or extra change.  Pathetic. I agree.  I'm just hoping for, I guess, a new start this year. I don't know. Maybe I'm starving for attention? I mean to say I go unnoticed is more than an understatement. Bascially, I don't exist. I guess that kind of works in my favor though. I get to  see  a lot of stuff, without being  seen.  I know alot that goes around, because a lot of people don't even notice that I am around.  Wait, why do I care if people care? God, this is just another so-called 'phase' of my teen ridden angst, where I question not only myself, but the world. Hm, I should really stop watching Ricki Lake.  I wish I could go back to kindergarden. I was so oblivious to the world around me. Things were just so simple then, so easy. The only problems I had were learning how to fly, and getting Barney's autograph. Funny how things change.  Well not funny 'haha', more like 'ha,damn life sucks' funny.  I should really get over, well whatever my problem is.  I heard somewhere that there are only two kinds of people in this world. Those who stay up all night and cheerfully watch the Happy Days Marathons, and then there are those who stay up at night with tears in there eyes.  I never really got that until now (though i don't know why there can't be some kind of in between). Whats the point of being the Jan Brady to the worlds Marcia (i know, to much Nick at Nite for me).  Jesus, I really need some rest. Cause in a couple of ours, I'll be in school. And for some reason I think that this is the only time i'll be able to have some short of peace.

      4 more days......................  in just 4 more days............  hell will open up, locust will sworm our streets, the world will be over as we know it............  Yes, that's right. In 4 more days school will start.  The thought of going back to that hellhole I so dearly know as high school, makes me want to throw myself from the roof. I would do it, but I'm not sure it's high enough to cause certain death. Maybe break a few bones.  Hmm, that should at least keep me out for at least a good week or so..........  Oh nevermind, I'll have to go anyway.  I really don't know where the days have gone. Summer went by way to fast for my liking. Which is strange, cause I'm usaually bored to death during vacation (with that not having a life and all), but this vacation was different. I didn't even have one of those akward "hmm, i'm so bored i wish i was back a school now....." eposides. Well I had one, but I blame it on the heat (you will never ever witness me saying I want to go to school, willignly, anyone who does should seek help immediately).  I really should get over my aversion towards school. That  would  be the mature thing to do. Then again, "me" and "mature", don't really hit it off well.  My friends think I'm crazy not to want to get back to school. Actually, my friends are  estatic  to get back to school (note: get new friends). It's probably because most of them are athletic or into clubs and stuff like that. I've never really understood the concept of spending more time in school because you  wanted  to. Someone would have to put a gun to my head, and threaten to eat all the startburst in the world for me to actually  think  about joining an after-school activity.  My mom thinks I should join as much programs as possible for two reasons. 1) When I go to college it will look good on my applications 2) I need to get out more. And get something called a social life.....  I would, but I much rather spend my free time with a tv remote than with the kids at my school. Simply for this reason I could have a much more meaningful converstation with my remote control, then any person at my school.  Hmm, maybe I don't give the people at my school enough credit. They are good for some things. Like gossip for example. I mean, I guess it's always nice to know who's giving who a blow job in the back of the school bus......................... Okay I really suck at the "benefit of the doubt" thing.
