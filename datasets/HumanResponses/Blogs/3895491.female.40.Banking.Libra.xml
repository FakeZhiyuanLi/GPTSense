      The sales rally ended on Thursday so Friday was one of those days where you have to make up 3 days work in a couple of hours.&nbsp; Ugh. It was a beautiful day outside though and I treated myself to a walk through the park across the street from the office.&nbsp; The sun was nice and warm and it feels like summer is finally here.&nbsp; Although I was really busy, each time my cell phone rang I would pause for a moment and my heart would begin to pound.&nbsp; Was it him?&nbsp; Was all my waiting finally paying off?&nbsp; No, not this time, but maybe next.&nbsp; Maybe he’s been really busy too and just hasn’t had a chance to call.&nbsp; Maybe he’s been out of town or on a vacation. (I know, pitiful huh?)&nbsp;&nbsp; So I go throughout the day with no call.&nbsp; Maybe the address I sent the card to was wrong?&nbsp; I know now that I have to make the call.&nbsp; It’s what I should have done in the beginning instead of putting myself through all this.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I worked late until about 6:15.&nbsp; I was feeling pretty good, top down on the car, music playing loud.&nbsp; Justin called to ask if a friend could spend the night and Chase called to ask if he could BBQ some of the trout he caught last week with Grandma and Papa.&nbsp; Sounded like a fun evening.&nbsp; I put on the head set and started returning calls to friends and ended up just leaving messages.&nbsp; I had run out of excuses and I knew it was time to make the call.&nbsp; 6:30 on a Friday evening would hopefully be a good time to catch him on the other end.&nbsp; I pull over about 2/3 of the way home.&nbsp; I park the car and practice what I’m going to say.&nbsp; I must have sat there for 30 minutes.&nbsp; Not for a lack of words, but for a lack of courage.&nbsp; I know if anyone ever reads this thing you will have wanted to slap me – I sure would if I wasn’t the author.&nbsp; Part of this whole exercise is being completely honest with myself and these words describe my inner world.&nbsp; The world I don’t let people into.  &nbsp;  After a while I started to get mad with myself. I knew now that the odds of this thing going the way I wanted were pretty low, but now it was about something bigger.&nbsp; It had more to do with my overcoming what I was feeling.&nbsp; About admitting to myself that the reason I was feeling this way was because this was the first person I had allowed to touch me in so long.&nbsp; The first person I had allowed inside me.&nbsp; I was in love with being wanted and being touched…..and I wanted more.&nbsp; Like an alcoholic going through the cabinets looking for that hidden bottle.&nbsp; I want to wake up with an arm over my waist again.&nbsp; I want to feel breath on the back of my neck.&nbsp; I want to be wanted again.  &nbsp;  I’m a worthwhile person, I thought.&nbsp; This guy has no idea what he is passing on.&nbsp; One by one I thought of the wonderful things I have to offer to the right man and I started to perk up.&nbsp; I’m financially capable of taking care of myself and my two boys without any outside support.&nbsp; I’m a fabulous cook and enjoy trying new things just for the joy of it. I have a wonderful home that is beautiful, but comfortable.&nbsp; I am spontaneous and just plain fun.&nbsp; I’m a loving partner and am confident in my role.&nbsp; I’m comfortable in Vera Wang or a pair of Wranglers with my hair pulled through a baseball cap.&nbsp; Yeah, Mr. Schreiner, your loss.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But I had a call to make.&nbsp; So I put the car in drive and pulled away from my stop.&nbsp; As I accelerated down the onramp, I hit the speed dial to the number he had given me that fateful morning.&nbsp; My heart was pounding, but I had found a new strength and a new attitude.&nbsp; No more victim.&nbsp; After three rings the phone connected to a voicemail.&nbsp; I heard his voice and for a fleeting second the words I had rehearsed were gone.&nbsp; By the end of the message, I had regained control and pulled off something that said I had been busy but would love to hear from him.&nbsp; Short and sweet with a dash of cute.  &nbsp;  It’s now Sunday night and the call never came. No more excuses.&nbsp; It was a one night stand in every definition.&nbsp; It was truly beautiful for those many hours, but it was not to be and my heart needs to move on.&nbsp; They say that life is a collection of memories. July 4th 2002 is now one of those memories…..one I will visit in my mind again and again. &nbsp;&nbsp;Rodney Schreiner, you rocked my world and made me feel alive again.

      I’ve been out of town for several days at a sales rally/ manager’s conference.  It’s one of those where you’re in meetings and break out sessions for most of the day, then off to dinner and an evening event.  Not much free time. Of course there isn’t much else to do after the evening events so everyone gathers in the hotel bar and we have fun until the early morning hours.  I love the group I work with.  They know how to rally during the tough times and they really know how to celebrate when it’s time for fun.  One of my peer managers, Jan, has become such a wonderful friend.  She has been an incredibly support to me over the last year as I worked through the changes to my family structure, the effects those changes had on my job and my fears of entering the world of being single.  She is a remarkable woman and I have grown to love her so much. Earlier this year she had invited me to join her family in Puerto Vallarta for a vacation.  She rented a 10K Square foot villa for a week, full staff to cook and clean. It was awesome. I spent 4 days there and had a liefetime of fun. This conference allowed us to get together and exchange pictures, laugh about the good times we had in Mexico and catch up with each other.  Jan is single but has had a steady boyfriend for a few months now.  Over the past year we would have conversations about the guys she would date and the life of a single person.  I asked a lot of silly questions and she was always very patient, never making me feel bad about asking.  So I shared with her my magical experience with Rodney.  She knows just how important this first time was for me and gives me a big hug.  She asked if he was someone I would like to see again and I said, “yes”.  You can almost guess her next question.  “So, have you guys had any contact since then?   No, I replied.  “Why don’t you give him a call?” she says back.  I stuttered for a second.  “I want him to call me. You know…the guy is supposed to call”. She looks at me with her head tilted down, “What is this, high school?…pick up the phone and give him a call, what’s the worst that can happen?”.  Now that makes perfect sense to just about anyone reading this and I could see myself giving someone else that same advise but being on the receiving end really made me feel silly. Why was I making a big deal out of it? I can always count on Jan to put things into perspective.  Thanks sweetheart, thanks for the gift.  Now you have to know that I’m really scared to do this.  I can’t explain exactly why but my first intuition is to make excuses.  Being a sales manager, I am often in situations that would make most people uncomfortable but I have learned to put on my suit of armor and not take things personally in that environment.  This somehow seems different though and I know I’m really going to need to push myself to make the call...if even just as a personal victory.  I’m so scared he won’t want anything to do with me.  (My eyes welled up with tears as I wrote that.)  I feel so much more fearful of rejection now that I am on my own.  I know I’m the same person and I know I have a lot to offer to a relationship, but I have to constantly remind myself of that.  Jan shared with me the many times she had waited for a guy to call only to let the opportunity to pass by.    “If you really like him, you need to give him a call”.

      I know.  After I licked the stamp and set it in the mailbox I began to have second thoughts.  It was a really cute card and I played with the wording for quite some time.  It said something about how great the fireworks were on the fourth of July.  Inside the card I folded a short letter with a picture of me from that night.    Hi Rodney, Please let me apologize for our abrupt departure last week.  I realize now that asking you to leave was inconsiderate and I regret doing so.  Had we been alone, our morning would have been much different. I think also, I may have sent you the wrong message. I would like very much to hear from you again.  I had an absolutely incredible time and everyone in my office wants to know why I’ve had this infectious grin all week.  I told myself the next day that I shouldn’t expect to hear from you.  Two lives with different needs found each other and for those few hours the rest of the world didn’t exist.  No regrets of our time together.  But I also know what it must look like from your perspective when a woman consents to your advances so easily……that she must do this a lot.  You would laugh if you knew the truth.  I had no idea what I was doing, I just couldn’t stop.   So it’s a week later and I’m still thinking of you.  Even writing this note feels a little silly, but I would regret not trying. If you’re still thinking of me I would love to hear from you.  If not, thank you for making me feel alive again.  Sincerely,    The note included my phone number and e-mail address. As I read it now, my stomach tightens….It sounds so desperate.  But I couldn’t let it go unless I gave it a little push.  If I don’t get any response, I’ll just tuck it all away as an incredible memory.  (Sounds easy doesn’t it.)  You might be asking yourself how I got his home address.  It is absolutely amazing what you can find out on the internet.  A reverse phone index was all that was needed.  Hopefully it shows a little effort on my part.  Is this how a stalker gets started?   Mailed on Saturday making delivery around what?  Wednesday/Thursday? I’ll keep you posted.

      I’m not supposed to feel this way.  I knew it was just about two people who came together for a couple of hours. …..hours when the whole world stood still.  We each had our reasons and I knew better.  My friend’s all told me, “If you sleep with a guy on the first night, you’ll never hear from him again”.  And yet, it didn’t seem to matter.  Not at the time.  Logically it all made sense.  I’ve been with the same person for 25 years, been separated for 2 and haven’t been with someone in almost 3.  This was supposed to be about “getting back in the saddle again”.   About remembering how to give someone pleasure…and how to receive it.  It had been so long, I was so unsure.  It was July 3rd.  A girlfriend and I had planned a wonderful day in Santa Cruz.  Kelly lives in Sacramento and we don’t get together too often anymore.  We were both looking forward to the visit and our time together.  We spent the day at the Boardwalk, a place Kelly had never been.   She talked me into riding the Giant Dipper and several others I don’t usually ride.  We walked the beach, took pictures and shared thoughts and feelings about the marriages we had both recently left. It was good to see her smile.  We had a suite at the Capitola Inn.  Not a terribly nice place, but it was the last room in town within walking distance of the Village.  Our plans included some drinking and dancing later and we didn’t want to chance driving.     After a short nap we freshened up and headed into the Village.  We chose a small Café to eat at and had nice slow meal, again chatting away.  We really need to get together more often.  10 O’clockish we headed over to Zelda’s for music, dancing and fun. We had been to the same place last year and knew we would have a blast.  We found two newly vacated bar stools at the end of the bar and settled in.  The room was starting to get full now yet the two of us were still engulfed in our own little world. Over Kelly’s shoulder I notice this great looking guy.  He is standing in a group with two other guys and two girls.  I was listening to my friend but watching the hunk.   I kept an eye on him long enough so he would know I was looking.  He glanced back.  As the others paired off from his group, he stood within 5 feet of us with a buddy.  It looked like he was working his way over and I could feel the anticipation growing.  He was totally cute.    I must have glanced away for a minute but suddenly he was gone.  I‘ll bet I looked pretty silly as I craned my neck around the room searching for him but he was nowhere.  Later our eyes met from across the dance floor.  We both smiled, but it didn’t go any further.  This place starts to get real hot after a few dances so we went out on the back patio.  We were making friends, taking pictures and talking with some interesting people.  We had been sitting there for an hour or more when the two girls to my right left their seats only to leave nothing between Mr. Hunk and me.  Surprise, he had been within feet of me all this time.  Our eyes met and this time he started a conversation.  I liked him right away.  I liked his huge smile.  He was big and powerful but seemed gentle at the same time.  He was even aware that a conversation involved a two way exchange instead of just a male monologue.  Refreshing.  I loved his day old stubble and how he would touch me from time to time as we talked.  When he said he was from outside Sacramento, Kelly joined our conversation and I could see her nodding as though she knew exactly the place he was describing.  A strong jaw and a muscular build.  Hawaiian shirt and jeans.  His name is Rodney .A farmer in a family owned business that had been through several generations.  You may snicker, but I couldn’t think of anything better.  He had been married once but divorced several years ago.  He asked if I was single which I appreciated very much.  We moved inside to refresh our drinks and stood near the bar.  For the first time I felt his hand on the small of my back. Just a small touch at first, but when he did it the second time I backed right into his side. His arm came around the front and I just melted.  I spun around, facing him and after a long silent stare our lips touched.  Was the band playing?…I didn’t seem to notice.  After what seemed like forever I realized we were blocking the walkway and my friend was standing there probably feeling like wheel number three.  I broke away for a moment to speak to Kel and she looked at me and said, “Be careful, I’m going to go back to the hotel”.  My mind was racing, was I really doing this?  My heart was beating right out of my chest.  Kelly took off and I suggested to Rodney that we go for a walk on the beach.  It had been cool earlier in the evening but I don’t remember being cold when we left.  The walk lasted less than 5 minutes.  We were only half way to the water when our bodies intertwined (standing up) and passion took over.  We were past being gentle.  I could feel his stubble across my cheek and all down my neck.  We had to stop just to breathe.  I looked in his eyes and said, “We have to go somewhere”.  Rodney didn’t suggest his room so I gathered from earlier conversation that it was probably one room with 4 or 5 guys.  I suggested my hotel and we walked toward the street.  There were no cabs so we started the ¾ mile walk.  It was so quiet and still and no cars passed.  He gripped my hand and we kept a good pace stopping every so often to kiss and hold each other.  In between embraces we talked.  Family…life …kids…work.  I’m glad we walked.  He even made the comment, “I guess I’ll be coming to Gilroy a lot more”.  When we got to the suite I asked him to wait while I went into the bedroom.  Kelly awoke and asked if I was alone.  When I shook my head she offered to go out onto the couch.  I nodded and was so happy she offered.  I closed the bedroom door behind us and turned on the bathroom light.  Our clothes were off in seconds and we rolled in each others arms.  My hand moved across his chest, it was incredible.  Broad and dark.  Enough hair to be very masculine but not too much.  I can still feel it between my fingers.  Within minutes both of us were panting and covered in sweat.  Like a freight train bucking and rolling.    I have only had 4 other partners in my life so I do not have a lot with which to compare, but I know I was in more positions in one night than I had been in 20 years of marriage.  …and he could go and go.  The first act lasted over two hours and I was glad to rest.  As I climbed out of bed to get a drink of water, my legs collapsed and I found myself face down on the floor.  Before I knew what had happened I felt and arm around my waist lifting me to my feet. I climbed back in bed and Rodney snuggled in behind me, his arm over my waist.  I could hear his breathing behind me and noticed the change in sound as he dosed off to sleep.  I remember being so content at that moment.  I miss an arm around me…safe.  I miss the snore and the warmth of another body in my bed.  I too dosed off.    It couldn’t have been more than 45 minutes later and I could feel him getting hard behind me.  Within minutes the embers grew to a raging fire lasting 30 minutes or more.  This sleeping and waking happened twice more before dawn.  I should have been exhausted, but I was far from it.   Around 7am I awoke and realized that Kelly may have to go to the bathroom.  I woke Rodney and told him that he really needed to go.  I was feeling totally guilty that Kelly had slept on the sofa and explained that to him.  We took our last opportunity to touch and I gave him a very special kiss goodbye.  He jumped from the bed and asked if I had a pen and some paper.  Wouldn’t you know that I was in the only hotel without stationary?  I found a business card and an eyeliner pencil.  He wrote his number and I wrote mine.   A quick kiss goodbye and He said he was going up to the office to get a cab.  I watched as he closed the door behind him.  Yes, the most incredible Fourth of July of my life.    And at that point I had no further expectations.  I knew exactly what this was – a one nighter.  I finally had one.  He did take my number though so I thought maybe he’d call.  I wanted him to. As the week went by I kept checking my messages and nothing.  I started to feel kind of crummy.  Is there something wrong with me?  Couldn’t he at least call?  Yes, I have his number, but I’m a little old fashion.  I want him to make the call.  It’s been a whole week now and I still see him when I close my eyes.  The more I think about him, the more I believe we would really be great together.  Tonight I started feeling really yucky, almost crying.  Why am I feeling this way?  Why can’t I let it go? Why isn’t he calling?  Why can’t I call him?
