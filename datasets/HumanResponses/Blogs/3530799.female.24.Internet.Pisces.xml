      Things are quickly coming together here. In the past week we have ordered the wedding invitations, booked a fantastic jazz band called the Richie Dimino Quartet and have interviewed several officiants for the ceremony. I think I've found a good one, but I would like to leave the doors open to any friends or family who are willing to get an ordination certificate and put together a ceremony for us. (Please call if you're interested)   In other news, we have a big announcement:  We're expecting!    Louie's breeders are planning for his parents, Curly and JR, to have more pooches this fall and I've already sent in a deposit for first pick of the litter!   Did you know that Hemingway was known for naming his cats after his closest friends and literary inspirations? I briefly contemplated naming Louie something like Ernie, Ninny or Funk but feared that he would be beat up at the playground. Louie was named after a charming neighborhood in the center of Paris, (St. Louie). In keeping Lou's theme we're thinking of naming the new tyke, Albany.   Why Albany? First & foremost Albany is where our dear friend, ding-dong Scott Lobel, was reared. It is also where Michael was sworn into the New York Bar Association and where I got my first pair of glasses. On any given day, my glasses & Lobel are more beneficial to us than being a member of NY Bar Association.   Here is a list of other names in the running:    1. Winnie (Winnie Cooper from the Wonder Years)  2. Rory  3. Charlotte (s&tc)  4. Annie  5. Sadie (Because we don't want Devin to actually name his daughter this)  6. Rudy (Rudy Huxtable - Cosby show)  7. Lucielle (Lucielle Ball)   We like names that are simple but not run of the mill (ie, no Lady's, Daisy's, Ginger's or Princess'). If you have suggestions please post them by pressing the comments button at the bottom right of the screen....we aren't expecting the new pup until Oct-December...depending on when JR decides to give Curly a little lovin'  PS: Because of the high volume of requests, I've added more pictures of Louie to the site.

      Rumor has it that my Uncle Keene checks this website everyday for updates. I find this incredibly sweet and I just wanted to give him a little shout out!  Today we've been busy with after party arrangements. Nothing has been decided but we will not leave you out of towners stranded -- I promise.  A few people have said that they've tried to call Karima about some things. Please give her a little slack because she works two jobs! She teaches during the day and manages at Wolf Trap during the evening/nights! In fact she's prone to calling me at 12:30 am while driving home from work! You might find it easier to reach her via email: kwesselhoft@hotmail.com  More later, Rikki

      yesterday i went outside for a spin on my roller blades and&nbsp;this time i didn't fall on my darier! it was&nbsp;early but&nbsp;i put on a&nbsp;30 sun block to shield my victorian complexion from the florida sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;about 45 minutes later i returned home, slipped on my swim suit and went for a very quick dip to cool off. i was outside another 20 minutes. when i went back into the house i took a quick looksy in the mirror &&nbsp;i noticed my skin had turned a brilliant shade of fuschia.   today it hurts to move & i'll most certainly have tan lines for my bridal shower. my  urlLink sun block  is only a year old but it has clearly expired!&nbsp;don't let  urlLink this  happen to you!&nbsp;i'm replacing my bottle of  urlLink baby faces  with a&nbsp;50 spf.

      i just got my first pair of roller blades.&nbsp; i know i'm a little behind the times but i just wasn't interested when they first came out. now my tookus needs a little lift and this is one of the best ways to get it. i am a pretty good roller skater and an OK&nbsp;ice skater.... so i figured i should be able to handle this, no problem:  WRONG!  first, these skates take 5 minutes each to put on. none of this just lace em up and go, you have to lace and then velcrow and&nbsp;then lock your ankles into place with these little plastic things. after you get through all of that&nbsp;you have to figure out how to stand up without rolling away. luckily i was sitting on the passenger side of my car so I was able to fork-lift myself up&nbsp;by the "oh-shit" handle. my car is parked on a slant so i'm heading slightly down hill for my first go. i bend my knees slightly (to prevent tearing something) and keep my balance.  &nbsp;  i'm having fun! i head towards the back of my development (also a slight downward slant) and i'm doing pretty good. then i reach the first in a series of five speed bumps. the first one made me nervous, but&nbsp;i was able to skate around because cars weren't parked. as i approach the second one i try out the little break thing on the back of my right skate. it slows me down slightly but i'm still heading towards the bump with more momentum than i care for. i do my best to step over it but forget to pull the left leg up after the right leg has successfully hit the far side of the bump and land smack on my ass.  &nbsp;  not to be deterred, i brush myself off and head back towards my car. this time i'm on an upward slant which lends a little more control to the breaking issue. i step over the bump i just busted butt on, go around the first bump that i passed and try to go around the circle by the garages. i make it around the circle without many problems so i try to go towards the front of my development (no bumps and upward slant). i go past the office buildings and near the tennis courts and i'm starting to feel more confident. i hear a car coming from behind me so i go to move closer to the curb and this time i trip on a very small rock before falling to the ground. i stay there for a minute because by now my muscles are feeling it. i decide i've had enough for today. take my blades and socks off and walk home barefoot.

      I know the universe is expanding, but my world is shrinking. I'm running into people I know all over the place and it's just weird.   Recently, my friend Kristan and I were in the middle of Grand Central Station in NY and I ran into a guy I went to college with. I didn't know his name and we weren't really friends but it was completely odd to see someone from North Carolina in one of the busiest hubs of New York City.  A few weeks later I get a call out of the blue - a close friend from child hood is moving to New York and needs advice. We haven’t spoken in years but I’m happy to help. She’s great, I’m great, life is good.  Two days ago: I'm getting my hair done & reading  urlLink Jane  magazine. I started reading an article about two people who went on a blind date with one another. I glanced up at a picture and saw my high school friend, Kate Lanahan. Today, I check my blog and there’s a comment from Kate! See her blog:  urlLink britpoppa    Stalkoogling can be a little scary, but if you're an old pal from the past I'd love to hear from you!    urlLink Send me an email
