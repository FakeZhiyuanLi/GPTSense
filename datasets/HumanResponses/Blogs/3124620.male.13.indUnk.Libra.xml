                         Today on MSN, I saw an update about the  Supersize Me  documentary done by filmmaker Morgan Spurlock. I just realized what a bad idea this was. This man ate nothing but McDonald's fast food for 30 days in a row. What kind of idiot............. Here is an article from  urlLink FilmmakerMagazine.com :  "Provocateur Michael Moore didn’t have anything to do with the Sundance sensation Super Size Me, but his methods were a major influence on New York City–based filmmaker Morgan Spurlock, whose funny and infuriating documentary feature examining the obesity epidemic in America took the Best Director prize in Park City earlier this year. In the film, Spurlock famously embarks on a 30-day diet of nothing but McDonald’s fast food, supersizing portions when offered and realizing shocking weight gain and potential liver damage as he interrogates doctors, lawyers, dieticians, school lunch program mavens, Big Mac connoisseurs and former government officials about fast-food consumption. Complete with an on-camera rectal examination and a gastric-bypass procedure, it’s a gross-out blend of endurance art and guerrilla muckraking that Spurlock hopes will change America’s thinking about what it eats. Sundance audiences ate it up, guffawing at an animated sequence featuring Ronald McDonald frolicking with tots to the tune of Curtis Mayfield’s “Pusherman” and retching during the obligatory projectile-vomiting scene starring Spurlock’s Happy Meal. It seems only a matter of time before Spurlock’s handlebar mustache becomes as recognizable as Moore’s copious gut.   This man destroyed his health trying to prove something we already knew. Fast Food is bad for you. And it will be, until Americans lear the meaning of the word " urlLink Moderation "

               Creepy Origins:      Manwich brand, creators of the Sloppy Joe.   A man named Joe Sullivan, who owned a diner in the 1930's, came home to find his wife sleeping with another man. He killed the two and cut up their bodies, and explained to their families that they had run off. He sat down with his wife's parents the next day and served them a new kind of sandwich with a "Secret Sauce". While eating it, his dead wife's father said "these are pretty sloppy, Joe."  Was the new sandwich made of his late wife and the man she comitted adultry with? Is this how the product was named:   Man  Wich?
