      Sorry for taking so long to write! I'm working at Dino's camp this week, and by the time I get home I'm so tired I can hardly stand, or I have to go to a party, and can't stand for another reason!! lol  One of the other counselors (Karim) is totally sexy. He has a nice toned body because he's a soccer player. And he's an awsome kisser! He took me out for dinner tonight at the salsateria. Both our fave place! Then Dino saw us making out on the side of the road. (Oops, hope he doesn't tell dad!)  Karim is at soccer right now, but I can't stop thinking about him. He looks alot like the my scene doll, river, except his beard's better. Look it up on barbie.com   It's gonna be so hard to keep my hands off him at camp  in fromt of the kids! We went skate boarding today and yesterday and some of our kids saw us cuddling and holding hands. I don't really care if they know but I don't want them telling their parents anything bad about us!

      Sorry about those last entries, with our conversation. They would be quite funny if you knew dave.   I went downtown with Emma today. We bought friendship bracelets and all this awsome stuff from harmony, then these old records from orbit.   I got a blister on my foot so big it looks like toe eleven.   I jumped in a fountain.   We talked to Dino, he gave us gum and told me I had to go to a meeting tomorow, and that he'd call me, but he hasn't yet.  Hottest 51 year old EVER!  lol.   Can't wait for camp!!

      I got my new skateboard, I covered most of it with stickers, except for spider man's "egg sac" lol! I want to go skating but I have nowhere to go, and nobody to go with  I ditched jim, I forgot I was supposed to meet him, and everyone els is busy.   Matty asked me out, and I said yes. That was last night. He's gonna come vist me this summer. I really want to break up with him because long distance relationships suck, but I can't break up with him over the phone or on e-mail. And imagine how horrible it would be to get out or your car after eight hours of driving to see someone, and get dumped. Why did I say yes!? STUPID! STUPID! STUPID!  I think I did really well on my géo exam this morning. Hopefully, because  got nine out of 15 on my final project. At least I passed? Rees only got 7/15. Heheh.

He's so sweet.   I can't wait for camp! All my friends are doing other camps too, it's like, counsellor year. Sky's doing rainbow, and Louie's doing band camp, I seriously wish I was at band camp! Dino's is gonna be fun tho, check out my last entry for details.   Tomorow I get my skateboard, FINALLY!! It had spider man on the bottom, but I think I can cover it up with stickers and stuff, hopefully.   I can't wait!!!

      I feel really bad! I've been leading Jim on for like, ever!! This is what he e-mailed me last night:         At the beggining of thew year you said that you had a crush on me, (that was you rite, not one of your friends) and just the other night you said that i had no chance with you. In my experience a person doesnt go from liking someone to not liking them in a matter of weeks, so therefor i must have screwed up, what did i do?                                                                                                         -Jim   I don't think I ever had a crush on him, and he's never had a chance with me. What should I say when I e-mail him!?

      I'm thinking about moving out after my géo exam this tuesday. My dad said I'm "fucking useless" and my mom told me that my life has just been one failure after another. I really want to stay in school. The only thing I can't figure out is how to bring my drums and harps. Maybe I can come back for them if I find somewhere to stay?

I'm gonna try to get a band, but it's really short notice, so if you have any suggestions please e-mail me, (smashinwithapassion@hotmail.com).   Anyone who wants to, please feel free to come. Wednesday afterschool, we're meeting in the music room. Bring a bathingsute, food if you can, and all your friends!

      Only three people showed up to the party today. It was a horrible failure. Not even Laura came. :(  It was so awkward. The onlt people who came were me, matt, Jenna, and Josh Burley. We went swimming and to EJ. I can't believe nobody came!!  I was thinking about having another party next weekend, but my pride has already been shattered, and my confidence in my friends can't survive another blow.

      Today's my pool party. It's supposed to start in 20 minutes, but I'm scared that nobody will show up. It's supposed to rain. Paranoya!!  This morning Trinity Church held their services outside, and I listened and sang along, from my window. They should do it like that all the time, so I wouldn't ever have to get up early on a sunday again.   I'm going to go get changed for my party. I'm so scared nobody will come!! I hope Dino does, he said he'd wear a speedo.  hottest 51 year old ever!    later

      Just got this new blog so I could start posting mean things about people who know my other addy. I just had Jim and Emma over, and I want to go to Dino's to pick up my new shoes but my parents are to drunk to drive me. This sunday is the party. It's probably gonna suck because I only invited like, 20 people and I told them not to bring drugs or alcohol this time. Last time it was pretty bad. (for those of you who don't know we had to replace the carpet, re-plaster the ceiling, and put a wall back up.) Good times matt! I really miss sean and I don't know why I broke up with him. I'm wearing his pants right now, and Phil's boxers.   Yesterdday night was the last week of girls club. I'm gonna miss you guys!! Then I went to the barbeque at Edward Johnson. I was hanging out with sky, then people were talking about my friend abe, but I didn't have a friend abe. It was so weird! I hung out with him when sky left, and now we're friends. It's a bit creepy that he knew me though. He plays the tuba. I tried the tuba for a couple months but I drooled. (lol Nick the long and winding...river) I'm gonna stick with the drums for now.   I had drum lessons, and Steve told me it's okay to smoke, but never smoke cigarettes. I love you steve! I'm so sad that I can't have drum lessons in the summer. I don't know how I'll live with-out that hot beard!  I went skating for my "fitness plan" and met these guys. I won't say what we did, but it was so good I still feel really stoned. Maybe I'm just a permanent burnout. I hope so, it would be so cool!   I feel really bad because Jim so obviously wants me. I'm kind of leading him on, although I constantly tell him that he doesn't have a chance. My mom told me I was like paris Hilton because I am a whore and a bitch and I'm spoiled, but I'm not pretty or skinny or ritch. Thanks mom, I love you!!  There is someone stealing stuff from the music room, and he tried to pin it on me  again . I signed out birdland, and when I brought it back they planted it in my bag with a bunch of other music. I'm really pissed about that, and the brushes. I don't even care that they forged my name because everyone knew it wasn't me, but I can't afford my own, and now I don't have any to use. :(  My fingers are starting to hurt from typing all this, but I'll probably come on soon. I have no life.   later

      Sorry about the hasty retreat.&nbsp; I was gonna stop blogging, but i've become way to stressed to not vent.   This week was rehersals for BIG.&nbsp; Karim's not gonna come see it :( Sexy steve said he would tho. He's awsome.&nbsp; My feet are all torn up from dancing. I'm so tired and sore.   If you understand the whole "bases" system, please post a comment and explain it to me. All I can say is, tonight I was planning on going to the next one with Karim. I hadn't said anything to him yet, then my parents went out and I couldn't even talk to him because he was in such a hurry to get off the phone.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; :(&nbsp; :(   ANyways, the show should be good, so everyone should come see it. Its only 5$ with igo if you have a student card. I'm going to attempt the can-can, and if that's not enough of a reason to go, I don't think I can recruit you.   I missed writing to you guys. Thanks for reading! and instead of e-mailing me with comments, post them up here.   -brownie

And I have a meeting with Dino. He said that it was about the counsellors not watching the kids and just socialising with each other, and I think he's refering to me and Karim. For those of you who don't know, we met at camp and are rarely apart. I love him so much. I should be off.  &nbsp; l8er sk8ers - brownie/leslie d

       The blog's been down for a while so every time me or karim tried to write it just deleted our entry. Hopefully this will work.     &nbsp;  This thursday is Karim's birthday, and out three week anniversary. He's the best boyfriend I've ever had, so I want it to be special. We're planning on going cake tasting, at every different bakery in town and just having a bite. I've only got 15$ and I won't get payed before then, so I don't know what to get him! Any suggestions e-mail me or leave a comment!    &nbsp;  My friend Jeff told me this stuff that's kind of got me scared for him. I can't say what because I promised I wouldn't, but pray for him!    &nbsp;  Tonight me and Karim are having a picnique by the river. Can't wait! ;)    &nbsp;  Anyways, thanks for reading! Hopefully this entry will post. E-mail me and keep me posted at  urlLink smashinwithapassion@hotmail.com      &nbsp;  later sk8ers!   -brownie (lol Karim)  &nbsp;

      Karim: today was a great day as expected!!!  First we went to the spot where our relationship budded; the salsateria.  After some over spicy food we decided to go for a walk downtown.  Just our luck, it poured rain.  After this venture, we got ice cream and concluded our romantic walk***.  When we got bored of this Leslie had the *genius idea to go drivin around a bit.  Soonthereafter we found a parking lot and the rest should only be discussed in an xxx film haha jk not quite but it was steamy!  And that's a summation of our night together that we will never forget.    I love you!!!

      Karim took me to the red papaya for dinner last night. Then we made out in the park, then we went downtown and had a soap fight in the fountain.

      Karim came over last night for dinner and Aladin. He looked really sexy, but his cologne was to strong.   He was really sweet, untill like, halfway through the movie we were talking, and he asked me if I'd have sex with him in 2 weeks when his parents were out of town. I was like, NO!  He brought me a rose

Then we went to see spider man, and made out, and got slobber all over the place. It was a mess.   It took us like, 20 minutes to find the house. He has bad directions just like me.   petit frenchie du punk says:  I love you so much  Karim - see the stone set in your eyes, see the thorn twist in your side, i wait for you. says:  ya i know, just wanted to make u say it again  I've been saying it all night!!

Tell me what's up, and go see my show at the riverrun center trursday friday saturday the 19th, 20th, 20th. I'm "salesclerk #1" and I do the can-can in a riped miniskirt. By the way Karim, if I forget to ask you later, do you have any black boxers, peach boxers, or boxer briefs? And if anyone els has them that'd be great to, Thanks!  Today we did a dress rehersal for big. It looks really good, I'm impressed with the wayt it came together. It's especially good considering that we have like, half the cast of last year. "rejuvinating year". I'm also amazed by the techies, because they did so much more than last year. The sets are all gorgeous. You guys all have to come see it!!  Today Karim and me went to the park, then the ross.  I talked to Sam about it, since he knew anyways. Now he's on our side... the dark side** lol. I don't know when to tell my mum and dad though. He's at soccer now, good luck babe! TTYL!  I'm off anyways, you guys should all check out salad fingers at  urlLink http://www.fat-pie.com/flash.htm  it's the best!  l8er sk8ers! - brownie

      It's my birthday today!  Yesterday me and karim had a birthday dinner since he has soccer tonight. It was so sweet!! We went to guelph lake, and he made a vegetarian dinner. We almost went swimming, but it was to cold, I touched the bouey! Then we moved into the backseat of the car for some steamy birthday fun ;)  Today after rehersals I had an orthodentist appointement where I totally lost it! Wilk promised me that the braces would be off before summer. They're staying on until after school starts again! :# I'll have a fence around my teeth for another month!  For my birthday today I got a book, some jewelry, and my mum's letting me get my hair dyed and styled. And got together with karim (in the backseat) for some soup. (It wasn't actually soup, but it was hot and steamy!)  -birthday girl

Karim had to go to collingwood to see his aunt who got hospitalised like, 10 minutes before he was supposed to come pick me up. I miss him!!! (I hope you feel better soon aunty!)  I have to go to value village with my mum instead now, to buy costumes for my show. For those of you who have been inconsistent in reading my blog, i'm in "BIG The Musical" at the riverrun center. You should come see it!  Today on the way home, this weird guy was talking to me and like, coming onto me. Then he got off the bus at the community mental health clinic. He wants to come see BIG to!!  I'm off to value village... have some fun for me on my anniversary! love you Karim, call me when you get home (k)  -brownie
