      For some odd reason, I kept marching through that dark tunnel. As things of a terrible nature were thrown at me, I still walked. The reason, I thought was right, was good, was just beautiful to have. . . .   But along that path, through that tunnel, was an unseen trap. Even though at this very moment I can't stand my reasons for trying, still somewhat proud of doing so. I know you probably Do want to hate me, but similar to what you said, I don't care. I can barely care anymore, not just because you but from other things. I don't care at all if anyone can understand or not, I don't need anymore to understand it or me for that's just. . . .   . . . .There are Always those who won't even give a chance for consideration. Maybe I should become somewhat like them, for when I cared I was screamed at and slapped. . .  . . . .I fell into that trap. . . .Happy now? Are you content? Now it seems that you will be alone, just as you seem to desire. There is no more time for This, there is now but time for you and your thoughts. Hope you're happy. . .

      Yesterday Erich gave me[fixture] graduation present. It is super cool. Yet, looking at it now, it makes me recognise the fact that I don't want to leave. Though, I know with my life style that one day I would have to leave him for quite a while, I don't want that day to come as soon as this one has. Thankfully, I will see him and everyone else again. But it just seems that the though of separation from him and so many others is something that's just cruelly lapping my mind more and more.

      Mmmm, something new to ponder on. . .Ani Difranco has a song called "Origami" and I just Love it! It's lyrics are something that have really had an effect on me for the past couple of weeks. One being that it seems to be so true in meaning through my perspective. There are some lines that goes:  Men are delicate Origami creatures That need women to unfold them And hold them when they cry   Now, being who I am and all, I took that to not be so "general" as some might take it. Yet, these past couple of days have been quite testing with me and now I'm coming to realise that in various ways those lines are indeed true. Take my brother for example, no he's not a "man" but you need to view the concept I'm trying to convey here not the technicalities, he can be quite a pansy at times. He'll run off and do whatever, proving that he is a complicated little origami creature. For he has all these "things" about him that you can be quite amazed at. Sometimes it seems that he's created by the parchment of Ignorance, Foolishness&Bitterness[ mind you that in a way, we all have those qualities, I'm just super mad at him right now. . .  ]. Then that parchment was folded again and again to create him. Every time that origami falls he always seems to need exactly a woman to unfold him and hold him, a female saviour. Just like his father. Runs about and around and only comes for some form of affection or something similar to that. Or maybe I'm just not having a very nice perspective of the "male species,"so to speak, and that's mainly for the fact that most ones around me, as in Men, seem to have a quite positive effect on me at first and then either they or my mind turns as cruel as Tanzi can be.   Sometimes I feel as if I could cry because of them. But I guess that's because they're mainly from the same culture that gives young ladies and women only two choices in life. Which are to either get married and become a mother of like at least 4 children or become a nun in the Roman Catholic church. Naturally, of course, respect for me lessens because of that. . . Or maybe they seem to not like me and who I am becoming because they seem to acknowledge my accomplishments and then forget them But always seem to remember my failures and flaws. Plus, some just won't, and or don't, seem to believe that I'm not the same 9 year old that loves to help Everyone and watch babies. I'm now a 14 year old with plans that Will clash with yours and am becoming quite defiant with what you believe to be best. I won't let a man claim me, abuse me, run to me every time he does something foolish, control me, and Only come to me to cry on, I can't and will never. The day for something like that to happen and their culture to be my future is the day that poor Berni, poor Chi, lost her sense of herself and needs to be saved and reminded of who she is and what she believed in before it's too late. For no matter what they say, they don't seem to love me as much as some of you do, at least when it comes to what I like and enjoy and most importantly Believe in. . . And plus, the rest of the song goes:  And I am tried of being your savior And I am tried of telling you why  Funkeh!^_^

      Ah k, so of course Erich's going to be singer in a "garage" band, so to speak. Thing is, of course there are those who seem somewhat critical about it and the only thing I can and will allow myself to say is that You Need to Open Up Your Minds in Music. . .The thing is that what everyone seems to "like" isn't that much of music man. What seems to be In in mainstream is the whole "I'm a pathetic person/ teenager and no one hears me out as I scream for mercy while cutting my wrists and destroying my body" and the whole "Sex Sells Records!" and also "Half naked chicks are the Only thing a rapper needs for his video to sell along with drinks, diamonds, nice hair, looking as fly as evah, and speaking or "rapping" about nonsense." That's the thing, mainstream loses its sense of what Music really is. Music isn't just a way to show off and seem as if you have a "voice." Music is a form of expression through your voice, your mind, your words, and your hands. Your hands being that most instruments are basically finger functional.   Music isn't what everybody likes or what everybody may seem to want. It's just music, for everyone to hear out and either support or really just leave alone. Just because a person's voice may not seem to impress you or not match someone's voice doesn't mean that they can't sing and need to be banded from it forever. Because, first off[holds up finger, heh heh], they are entitled to their own voice and vocal individuality. Just because some chick doesn't sound like the lovingly synthesised Brittney Spears or maybe Lauryn Hill, doesn't mean she can't sing. Also, if a guy doesn't sound like some other famous well-known male singer, you have to look more closely at it all. For the fact being that the world of music is Not centred around those that are well known. Some would be amazed at the types of musicians that are Real musicians out there. Yet, because they aren't so popular and well known, some just don't give a rat's aaaaaaahh K. . . Anywho, there are soo many views on vocals when it comes to music that it gets to the point were you can't critise a soul if you dared. So really, if you haven't heard "music" beyond people like Ani Difranco, Arto Lindsay, Bjork[couldn't find accent for the "o"], Bitch and Animal and Phish, you really can't say much. Plus, you'll find one}in my opinion{of the true meanings of music, which is the depth of the lyrics and what they say and also the beauty of the song instead of, technically, the person. . .   Anywho^^; I'm just basically saying that I am supportive of him and the band, especially with how they're starting up and all, that type of band needs the most support. That is until I finally know what music genre they are and the type of lyrics they have. Or else, it shall be the end0_0. . .mu ha ha ha. . .

      Ah k, so I've been reading right? And there's this book with a chic chick that's totally fallen for a photographer, both of whom are supah dupah rich. . .But yeah, she's completely for him and he seems to distance himself at times, because that's best for his work. She reminds me of how sad some become because they are "in love" and it's like "eh!?. . .???" Makes me wonder at times, you know?. . .  [Oh, and in the book her name is basically "Moi"]

      A moment's thought. . .My devotion is something that seems to constantly be tested. The other day, I would not let Anything come in my way and pushed some aside for there was something planned that would include me, whether I end up crying on my way or breaking some . . .  Now, a thought of the past has come. Of all that I've done and tried in hopes that this works out with us and that I love ya. . .And am glad that you seem the same. For I realised that I'm almost bound to do anything for you, well. . .depending on what it is^_~

       Don't Break  No matter what you think or how you feel, you are never alone. There are those who feel and have felt the same, have had to stand alone all their lives, yet they found ways to stand. They discoverd reasons to stand and omit facts of being loved by those who seem to not love them enough to support them in their hardest times. . .in their mental emotional struggles in becoming who they are to become, the person seen in the future, the person seen now.   There's Something There  I remember that time when you told me that you loved me and always would, during that time when I was confused. Now I'm here telling you the same. I love you and always will, no matter what crazy things happen between us or the wack things we may do to each other as time goes on. There is something about you that I love, don't feel as if you're the outcast and no one cares. . I surely do^_~. Plus, we all are freaks in each others eyes, with the wack things we do each day.   ['live and comprehend that you can't be like everyone else and a group of people the same, that would be a dull world to live in everyday of your life 'just as you speak of being there for me, i am here for you]

      I don't fit in, nowhere to belong. Everything I like, is shunned by my friends. To "Fit in", and like everything that is popular. To not have to lie, to get out of stuff I don't like. But I feel like a freak. I can't do the things other people do, it just feels too hard. The pressure, its alomst unbearable. Why am I here? No one to share my secrets with. No one to help me when I feel down. No one to give me advice. Maybe I am just asking too much.  Yeah Unhappie.

      Interest, something of my interest. I'm against the war in Iraq, I've found it to be use in "freeing the Iraqi." For it seems that they are not free at all, prisoners being abused and most importantly a man imprisoned for the wrong reasons. Camilo Mejia Castillo was put in jail because he refused to return to Iraq to continue with the war. I read an article about it and got a little quote from it. . . "He realized that the war was based on lies about weapons of mass destruction and ties with Al Qaeda, and that the subsequent claims of saving Iraqis from a brutal dictator were a cover up for the real aim of this war: controlling the country's oil and other resources, and gaining a permanent military foothold in a strategic part of the world. He decided he could not, in good conscience, continue to participate in an 'immoral, oil-driven war'." Now, that surely has opened my eyes greatly to much of the war. Also, I signed a petition to help the women of Iraq, hopefully that petition will work out. I've gotten, also, an interest in an anti-war group called Code Pink. Truly, it is a women's organization against the war, but of course all genders are welcomed. My twin even had a pin supporting the group and I feel it to be my time to do more about the war other than despise it in my mind and my mind alone.

      Slowly, slowly thus it creeps, The utter silence we should never keep, Though now I wonder how long it shall stay, The simple thoughts of you on our happy days, The nights filled with words with a true meaning, The thought of love in our hearts ringing, Now I'm here, no longer the same, Whispering, before I sleep, your simple name. . . .  Poetry's fun. . .Think I need to sleep now, gettin' poetically }yeeah{

      Man, I have some funkie friends. So, instead of still going to the movies, we walked for a bit and ended up sitting on the corner talking. Mainly about what had just happened. As we sat, some little children started to gather to, I guess, "attack" us because some boy kept bothering us and calling us gay and stuff. Now, that shows how smart, open, and "simple minded" children around here are. Plus, Son was on the verge of throwing my shoe at the kid. Heh heh, that was after I threw my shoe at Lonzo and started to yell at him about "guys" in general and of how I'm getting tired of the ones around me, or the ones I know, and the ones that seem to have left me. . . I just raged on and on about how they'll only use me, use us, to help them because they can't feed themselves and stuff. Now, I'm pretty sure they can, but at that moment, all possible guys that I was friends with were basically ticking me off^^; And plus, I just had to get a lot out, from thoughts of those who have abused me mentally. . .  But wow, I would just snap out of myself and keep talking and everything was just so "argh." Plus, it's not smart to get me mad, I'm an artist, think of what I'll do if I loose my mind, man0_0. But, it's really nothing, I just started to draw. Drawing can relax me, so of course I was sitting on the corner of a street with two awesome people and was drawing. The thought of it is pretty funkie but the reason why isn't. . . |~*~|Ciao|~*~|

      So, seems someone can't spend time with me anymore. Okay, so yeah. . . . wasn't about to go to the movies still, didn't mean that at least being with me would be bad or anything. But no, seemed that hopping into the car along with those that you will be able to hang out with over the Summer is better. . . is easier. . . will make you happier. . . Guess I must not mean much to you anymore. . . .Tanzi's words are floating about now, must shun them>_ : : :Sorrie, just had to let it flow, might not mean it in a couple minutes: : :

      I'm one weird chik^^;. . . Ah well!^_^ Sooo, Erich's leaving in like 2 days and it's not cool man! I'm not going to be able to see him until, I think, around when school basically starts up again. I'm leaving for New Jersey[not Neon Jaguars. . .] in about 4 weeks, but I highly doubt that I'd be able to even talk to him on a computer of any sort. Ha, as if I'm going to "try" to call him? I can barely hold a conversation with him, it's so funny and soooo ridiculously sad at the same time. Plus, some people might get suspicious. . . But anyway, I'm going to miss him, I think?. . .Ha ha ha, of course I will^^;

      Distance is such an amazing thing. When you think that it isn't such a far distance, something always happens and makes it larger. Something random that can create illusions that soon become taunting in what you see. I thought I saw him but got some distorted image of what I thought was true. : : :Thought it was better but see something worse.: : : I saw something worse and I hated it dearly. Made me want to stab something with my pen, something chubby but not a human and not alive. . . I thought the distance had decreased, yet maybe that was just a dream. Well, let time pass and maybe it will finally decrease forever, or as long as it can.

      Wow. . . Things have had their own little change . . . eh. . .  Anywho, I'm losing my sight. . . I can't see things the way I use to. It's quite horrid to me. My optimism is on a dangerous low from just all this stuff in the parenting world that kills the Chi and now all I can think of is what will tomorrow bring? How will my life be able to escape from all of this? Why won't they Listen to me once in a while and why can't I smile on my own.   Everytime I think to the past my mind just floats away for a spell. Worries constantly haunting me in my pursuit of happiness. Just want things to be happy, I know nothing lasts forever. . Which is why I can't wait for this evil spell to disappear. Want to see and speak with my friends again. Want Erich to be alright now. Want to be somewhere and stay with ease and no more or this odd pain within me.   It's come to be now that I just barely care anymore. I can only care of getting out and flying away. . .I couldn't care less about my father now, though I see him everyday, it does not change my feelings towards him, yet only makes them worse. . . . Gives me more reason to create a better life for myself and those around me that I love, sadly I barely have any control on either things now. But ah well, must move on Right? Plus, I have been having dreams again, they've been random but have not left me feeling ticked or anything. Even the other night, I dreamt I was flying over an ocean that had a double bridge and it was in NYC, I learned to fly through these two women and created my own simple skills. I think that's one of the happiest moments I've actually had here On My Own and I just hope that I can find ways for that to occur more in these coming weeks. . .  ~*~Arrivederci~*~
