      It's communist, almost.  I anxiously awoke today, hoping to find the stuff I ordered. Didn't. Mailed the order just yesterday. Gonna be a long few days. Have never heard a speck of the music I ordered.  I'm naive without trusting. That sucks.  I hate people. Er... the way they love to pick at fucking stupid little things. My brother's only ten and he's been an asshole all day. Keeps this bullshit up about my "girlfriend" because I talk to Jessie for more than 8 seconds on the phone. He only does it because his friend's in town, so he wants to show off in front of her. And it's everyone, not just him.  I hate it. I wish she'd stop calling me with her stupid relationship problems. They're so ridiculous.  I keep having these 4 second periods of suicidal thought. I figure it's probably just habit, or something. That still can't be healthy though.  Conclusion: I  do  live in my head.  I don't know what to think. About people. I don't know how many of them actually want anything to do with me. Patrick doesn't. That is a good thing, but it doesn't help with my low number of friends as is. Jessie only calls because I don't hang up on her. Listening to her problems... got used to that a while ago. Never realized that I wasn't being a counselor, I was being used. By everyone who brought their problems to me. They didn't care when they stopped talking to me. Maybe I am naive and trusting. That's not good either.  Maybe I'm just self-absorbed and selfish. Maybe I'm getting what I deserve. I've been horrible to a lot of people, too. I hope they don't dwell on things like I do.  I keep thinking about people. I hate it, as it's pointless. I wish I knew Nicole better. She's gone to college. I wish I'd said something to Joanne. I never will. I wish I didn't think about so many people... seems fickle. I wish that I'd stop thinking that it's Jessie's problem to look over me... or that it were true. I kinda wish I weren't me. I wish I'd said something better to Allie than I did. Despite that it wouldn't matter - boyfriend. I wish I didn't hold onto these things. I wish I were better at fixing them. I wish I didn't have any appeal to people whose wishes I'm too timid to fill. I wish I were more comforting. I wish I were nicer. I wish I didn't pretend to be as good as I do. I wish I could have had one of the people I liked. I wish I hadn't said that in the past tense. I wish I didn't feel like so much was over. I kinda wish I could do a lot over. I wish I didn't feel the way I do about so many things that I should like, as a teenager. I wish I didn't need advice, because I hate it. I wish I didn't feel like I have no youth. I wish I wasn't pessimistic about everything. I wish I didn't feel like people were standing over me. I wish I wasn't paranoid about everything. I don't have a clue how to wrap that all together.  I really want someone to just hit me in my stupid face right now.

      It forms quite slowly. It's nothing of a magical series of moments that constructs some beautiful sonic movement. It's more of a process akin to the music itself - a glacially paced gravitation of pieces slowly boiling and melting together by keeping an ivory-knuckled grip on the inspiration - remembering a face. You won't drive faster to it. You'll stir it around in water you take medicine with.  There's something about Iceland, no?  urlLink http://www.noisedfisk.com/mumweb/photos/lighthousegardskagi.jpg  Even the people - just look at their cute, polite smiles.  urlLink http://www.noisedfisk.com/mumweb/photos/mumbw1.jpg  Really, though - it's no wonder music like Sigur Ros's and Mum's (the group pictured in the second link) is so... warming. There seems some untouched, idle, innocent beauty to the place that I can't help but fear being ravaged in a cultural invasion - I do fear it. Iceland deserves better. Iceland deserves to not be part of the rest of the world. I despise that that's a gift.

      I've recorded little. But there is a little. It's easier when no one's around as thoughts can hear themselves. Hate tv. Hate radio. Too many advertisements. So I resort to the internet. Aware of irony (hypocrisy?)...  pop-up blocker . Have thought about starting a little thing amongst friends in producing, duplicating, packaging and distributing their music. A tiny, one man, independent record label, if you must. Probably won't have anybody's music to work with, though. Except mine. Which makes it easier to focus. Maybe should start recording again. Thinking does nothing.
