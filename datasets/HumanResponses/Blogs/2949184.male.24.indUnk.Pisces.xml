      Now playing on iTunes:  Lifehouse "Hanging By a Moment"  I'm not a huge fan of Lifehouse.  Well, they're okay, but not something I want to listen to right now.  Tonight it seems like iTunes has a premeditated mission to play depressing music and make me feel worse about my pithy problems. So guess what? I'm gonna write about them here as long as my MP3's have me thinking about it.  So uh, take a piss or grab some water or whatever. this will probably be long.  I am probably gonna be fired from my job.  This doesn't please me, especially since it's one of the stupidest things one can get terminated over: short lunches.  I know it sounds dumb, but I'm already about to be suspended because of it.  So I did what seemed sensible to me.. I started scouting out other jobs and applied for one.  The only problem is I'm not exactly unemployed yet.  I just have this horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach that this whole mess will blow up in my face.  I put down a couple of close friends in the company as business references, mostly because I've held my current job for about 6 years and know tons of people.  But things like my situation have a tendency to spread around pretty fast, and if it reaches any of the management staff I'm certain to lose my job, even if I don't really want to.  I love the people I work with, I love the physical aspects of my job, I love the fact that I can get sweet discounts on electronic gear, but on the other hand, the company seems to want to drive everyone away.  I get to withdraw from my sociology class, because I somehow managed to suck really badly at it, and I don't really want a fail destroying my GPA.  I already told my dad, but I'm having a super-hard time figuring out how to tell my mom.   She just looks so proud when she tells everyone how well I'm doing, I can't bear the thought of how the news that I'm not actually doing that great will affect her.  I just wish I knew how she'd react before I tried to tell her, so I could brace myself.  This just in: I'm pretty damn sick of being alone.  I guess I just don't understand why it is I'm not attractive or whatever.  Well I understand it, but I don't understand how to get people to look past that.  I mean, I think i'm a decent guy, I just don't think girls look for decent guys anymore.  It seems like the guy can be just an utter and complete cock as long as he is good looking.  That kinda sucks.  I just wish I could find someone.  Becky says that I just need to be patient and someone will come along, but I'm not a very patient cat.  So yeah.  There's so much more I feel about this but there is no possible way to express it.  so yeah. that's pretty much it. I don't know what else to say.

      Now playing on iTunes: Tom Petty "Rebels"  BWWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! guess who's up a lot later than they should be?  If you gave up, or just don't give a shit: it was me.  And still is.  I picked up MVP 2004 Monday night.  I also saw my crush du jour, but that's a whole different topic.  The short story is, I played the hell out of it.  From when I popped 'er in the old gamecube till like 3:30 or 4 im the morning it was nothing but BASEBALL BASEBALL BASEBALL. what a fucking sweet sport. and finally, a game that does it some justice.  First, my disappiontments:  1) no Barry Bonds, 2) no expansion mode, 3) no Joseph P. Mauer.  I fixed those player gaffes pretty quickly but I'm still disappointed no expansion franchises can be creatred.  ehh... the third thing I did in the game (besides fixing Joe and Bonds) was found a Dynasty Mode™ based on my beloved Twins.  Then I played some games, first as the Twins, then as the AAA-level Rochester Red Wings, then as the AA-level New Britain Rock Cats.  SWEET!!  Building on All-Star's deal from last year they gave every team their real-life minor league counterparts, and it's as fully interactive as the big club. ramble ramble blah blah blah..  anyhoo, this game rocks my socks.  It should be on the top 11 list of any serious sports gamer.  Well that'll do it for me. Finally getting tired now.. ~ E

      Now playing on the iPod: Train "Meet Virginia"  Hah.. I guess I'm not making this as regular as I would have liked.  What has it been now, a week?  Anyhoo..  Today I was actually able to go to school without a jacket. Sweet.  The other thing on my mind right now is the iminent season opener for the Twins.  A lot of negativity has surrounded those cats recently and I for one am extremely optimistic for the 2004 season, what with the new "Soul Patrol" outfield of Stewart, Jones and Hunter, and the solid infield, and spanking-new local boy Joe Mauer behind the dish.  The only thing that really gets my panties in a bunch is this whole fiasco with Victory Sports One and the fact that there may only be 27 games available to me to watch.  That fucking sucks, my friends.  How am I supposed to watch my Twins on TV if nobody will pick the channel up?  Thanks a lot, Carl Pohl-ass.  I'm putting up fliers Friday to sell my PC.  I'm hoping to get $1500 out of it, which would mostly pay for my Mac.  I figured that if it comes to that, where I can't personally migrate files from my PC to my Mac, I can devise an elaborate system of pulleys, smoke and mirrors to make sure I keep all my files.  The main thing I'm worried about is losing my MP3's.  Oh well, we'll see.

      Now playing on iTunes: The BoDeans "Good Things"  Stuff!  1) my new DVD player is working flawlessly.  So yay for that.  I felt bad taking my old one out of my AV stack, but broken things shouldn't stick around.  Plus my new player doesn't exactly mesh cosmetically with the rest of my equipment, but it does give me 5 discs of progressive-scan glory.  2) went to the carshow tonight. Besides taking in many a mullet I spotted my new car: the Hyundai Tiburon.  I got into it and it was like it was tailor-made for me.  And in the dark blue it looks like a killer machine.  Which it will probably literally be if I get behind the wheel of one outside of the carshow.  Hooray for wishful thinking..  Things!  3) the Twins rock. Just thought I'd mention that.  4) And if anyone has any money they'd like to donate toward my Macintosh it'd be most appreciated. Thanks.

      Now playing on the iPod: Ben Folds "Eddie Walker"  This "spam" thing is getting out of control.  Pop-ups too.  For example, yesterday I was dutifully emptying my mostly-useless Hotmail inbox when I saw an email with a normal name and the subject line of "hi".  So being the smart guy I am, I opened it and I found the most absurd line ever in a spam email.  Here it is, exactly as it appeared:   CONGRATULATION  You have won FREE Dinner for two, from a lucky draw we conducted sometime back.   guh?  Quite possibly the worst spam email ever.  Though it did make me laugh quite a bit.  Thusly, I am saving it, and have already made it my screenname in the Windows Messenger.  "...tell us where to send your dinnercard."  How about I tell you to eat my ass?

      Now playing on iTunes:  Five for Fighting "100 Years"  Well I did it. I created the greatest thing known to man-- the official ES.com iPod travel kit.  I used Lunchbox® as the base for the kit, while using bubble wrap, the original packing foam and the box for my spare 1394/USB2 cable to house the iPod, cables, AC unit, dock, car charger and FM modulator.  It works out pretty damned slick I have to say.  Depending on how you look at it, either Echostar or Viacom caved, and CBS and Comedy Central are back on my dish.  Now i won't have to choose between Chapelle's Show and my PVR. *whew*  Now I just have to wait and see where Victory is going to land.    While I was reading the AP story from the Strib website I noticed another headline: "Somalis stranded by bus strike."  uh.. and?  So what?  I don't want to sound crass or racist but why is this even remotely relevant?  But the Strib being the Strib, they have to put the uber-liberal spin ov every damn thing they print, be it a (valid) continuous hate of quasi-President Bush or those oh-so-neglected Somalis.  Well you know what?  The bus stranded my friend Brandon.  But he's not in the paper.  You know why?  Because he's black, not from Somalia.  Thus, the strib has no reason to write about his plight.  This being said, there are tons of people who are at a loss because of the strike: university students, people that can't legally drive, high schoolers for extracurriculars, etc., not just poor people and Somalis.  So let's quit making it a class/race issue, and bond together and find a solution, instead of bitching about the problem.  Well that's it from me.  Night everyone.. E

      Now playing on iTunes: The Thorns "I Can't Remember"  my head hurts and it's uber-late, so this will be a short one.    I finally got Lunchbox® yesterday.  If you're wondering exactly what the hell that is, you need to visit my website.  Anyhoo, outside of that and dicking around on Photoshop I pretty much pissed away the day, just like spring break was meant for.  I also started to implement Lunchbox®'s intended use: the ultimate travel kit for my iPod.  Uh, it hasn't gotten very far yet.  It seems to have all the space I need but I need to figure out how to fill in the extraneous space.  I'll post a picture of it when I find my digicam.    Also, while bemoaning the fact that DISH yanked WCCO and countless Viacom channels off my television, I watched some of the Warroad-Orono hockey game and also saw that UPN was screening a POS called "The Mullets".  Now I was intrigued beause "Mullets" was pulled off the air last fall before I could even watch the show to mock it.  In contrast, "Luis" lasted longer this fall, and that was just a 30-minute Mexicans-vs.-Puerto-Ricans slur-fest.  I watched about 7 seconds of this putrid show today and I hope that it's pulled back off soon.

      Now playing on iTunes: John Mayer "New Deep"  Well I succombed to media pressure and yesterday I went to see  urlLink The Passion of the Christ  with my parents and some friends from church.  Wow, what an intense movie.  The suffering of Jesus during his final days on earth were portrayed so well on a human level, much more so than the countless Holy Week/Easter sermons, or the Bible, or even those cute little Sunday school stories ever could.  i was touched more deeply by this film than by anything else in recent memory, and the special part is that I was able to share in this moment with a packed theater, moved to a reverent silence, and that's where the success of "Passion" ultimately lies, in that people are albe to see whet he went through for us.  On a much weightier issue (wink wink) I decided over the weekend that a switch to Mac is in my future.  I was looking at the gleaming new G5's on Saturday and after playing with it for a good hour my decision was made.  So there goes another $1500 ... thanks a lot, iPod.   Just thought you'd like to know. :) Later.

      Now playing on iTunes: Wayne "Drop D"  I have to start titling these things.  Well today I went to CompUSA to pick up a car charger for my iPod.  I went up to the checkout and I found a familiar face staring back at me: Anna, the inexplicably cute redhead that seems to be there everytine I go, standing there with a smile waiting to clerk all of my geekified items.  So she did, and we made some small talk about how our respective stores were pretty slow lately, and as I picked up my bag and left she wished me a good night and told me to take care.  That made me smile.  It seems that just seeing her face and hearing her soft voice made everything alright.  I have had a positively shitty week and when I left CompUSA I felt great.  I reflected on this with my friend Jeff and the question came up: would it be wrong to ask this girl, who is paid to help people and be nice to them, out to dinner or whatever.. would that be crossing the line? I wasn't sure, because I like to believe that I'm not built with asshole tendencies and I don't wanna be that guy who hits on the waitress, and Jeff seemed to think it was OK though it would require brass balls.  Which I agree with. And also lack.  So maybe I can formulate a "plan b" and work up what courage I do have, and head over there one day and just up and ask her out.  After all, you don't know if you don't try.

      Now playing on iTunes: Dave Matthews "Everyday"  a string of disappointments.  That's the only way I can describe today.  Let's see.. well I went to my English class and I had nothing.  I was supposed to go to the PiPress yesterday for observational purposes but it got bumped from the schedule, which resulted in my profiles paper not being ready for prime time.  So needless to say my peer review wasn't productive.  Another stressful day in my sociology class.. I am in way over my head on that one.  I also got my hair cut.  Not a pleasant experience.  I usually see this chick Heather near my job to get my cuts; today I went to a place near my school and I walked out looking like I was headed back to my double-wide to watch Smackdown.  No good.  Hey, also I got positively beat down at work.  That wasn't fun.  Plus it started fucking snowing again. I HATE SNOW IN MARCH.  I also decided that if I'm ever afforded the opportunity to have children that none of them wil be named John.  Reason being, with only a couple of exceptions guys named John seem to be self-absorbed cocks.  Yeah, I said it.  It's probably just me.  But if I see or hear the name John I will usually bolt in the other direction.  No kids named Derek either.  Every Derek I meet is some sort of dead eyed loner.  I hate to generalize like that but a name is a very personal thing, and sometimes your very soul can be tied into it.  Well that does it.  Later ~ E

      Now playing on the iPod: Billy Joel "You May Be Right"  This post is coming live from Century.  I had an odd dream the other night that made me think a little bit today:  A girlfriend from my highschool days swung back into town, and guess what?  She wanted to get together and do something. Of course I agreed to, since I have nothing else going on, even though she was recently incarcerated and now on probation.  So I spent a few minutes putting myself together and cleaning my living space, then went out to meet her.  The only thing was that, for reasons unknown, I brought my buddy Emman along.  This proved to be fatal to my date as my ex wanted to spend the evening with him instead of being in the same vicinity of me.  And naturally when I woke up I was just a little creeped out.  But whatever....  It's been a week since I had my wisdom teeth out.  My mouth still hurts some.  The sad thing is, I never realized what a great pleasure it is to eat, after having nothing but soup and water for 4 days.  And to imagine that I took that shit for granted!  Though I did lose like 6 pounds in the process.  So that made me happy. Wheee! :)

      Ben Folds is accompanying the clicks from my keyboard, but that doesn't help the fact that THERE'S STILL SNOW ON THE GROUND.  It got up past 50 desgrees on Sunday.  That made me happy because I foolishly thought spring was almost here.  Instead, it rained/snowed yesterday, with a sharp decline in temp, and it was about the same today.  Cold, dark and dreary. Perfect.  Anyhoo, TWC says mid-50's highs will return next week, and I hope the sun comes back too.    On other fronts, John Kerry apparently crushed John Edwards (horrible first names but I'll touch on that another time) in the Super Tuesday caucases that virtually no one goes to.  To contrast this predictable outcome, here's a picture of Dennis Kuchinich and Al Sharpton looking baffled:     I don't know why, I just thought it was funny.    I also found out today through third-party fan info that apparently John Mayer is an arrogant bitch when it comes to impromptu meetings with his fans.  This made me sad.  Mayer is a guy I love listening to and occasionally watching bad shows like Leno and Today in order to catch him live.  So I'm secretly holding out hope that this simply isn't true.  But knowing the internet and its widespread reputation for airtight factual accuracy, I'm not too optomistic.  John or any fans are wlcome to let me know what's up.  well.. that's pretty much what's going through my head. Later.

      Well.. this is my first attempt at the "blog" in its true sense.  So um, bear with me..  Well today after I got home from school I was pretty bored.  So I did what I normally do: I fired up iTunes and cruised the internet a little bit (okay.. a lot.).  Anyhoo, I made a startling discovery: there are a lot of personal throwaway websites out there that are just absolutely stunning visually.  And that makes me sad insonde because THEY'RE BETTER THAN MINE!!  That wouldn't upset me by itself, since I have the programming skills of a comatose lab rat, but the fact that most of them are done by like, 13-16 year old kids absolutely frosts my calvanator.  So that made me sad. But oh well, at least I still have iTunes.

      Now playing on iTunes: Iffy "Double Dutch"  Still playing (and frustrated) with the format of this damn thing.  I switched the primary font to Franklin Gothic, and it appears that isn't a standard font on pre-XP computers.  But you know what?  If you don't have the font fuck y'all.  Or just like, deal with the default one.  I'm also tooling around with Dreamweaver, a program that sucks if you don't know how to use it, and one that would benefit from the patience I lack.  Sorry guys.  The big 25th anniversary shindig for my parents is right around the corner.  It was pretty sloppily prerared as we just decided right before Easter to throw it, but it's getting done.  The house is getting clean and Heather's been doing the running around making sure everything is straight with the food and the guests and everything like that.  So hopefully it'll go well.  We'll see I guess..

      Now playing on iTunes: Seal "Don't Cry"  This song serves as a good reminder for the folks in this news story:  urlLink Kournikova Sued by Parents Over Home   I love it when people are so unabashedly irrational you can only shake their heads at them.  Oh, and another thing.. why is this news?  Ehren's crystal ball prediction: KARE-11 will lead with this at 10:00 and the Pioneer Press will slap 'er on page A1, right under the story of women persevering from whatever they persevere from these days.  However, here's an ACTUAL news item:   urlLink Worker loses job after photographing soldiers' coffins   Peep THAT article out, my husky, internet-traveling friends.  And in case you're just too lazy to you know, read it, here's the gist:  A woman (yeah, they seem to be cropping up everywhere) snaps a photo of several flag-draped coffins on a US military cargo plane while at her job, and with nothing but good intentions in her heart, develops it and fires it off to the Seattle  Times  which gives it a prominent place on their Sunday front page along with a news item about the Iraq conflict and a feature about her and her job.  She then gets the ol' pink slip by the government for providing sensitive information to civilians.  And as always, there are two distinct sides to this story.  In defense of tami Silico, her act was one of kindness and compassion.  She simply wanted to show the families of deceased soldiers that they were well taken care of.  Then of course, there's that other side, the one that insists that the photo jeopardizes the most remote chance of the Iraq mission being successful, and thusly putting anti-war spin on it.  News flash: At least two thirds of this country is anti-war.  End of rant.

Wheeee!  That's pretty cool.  I've pretty much dedicated my life, or at least the next 19 seconds of it, to extolling the virtues of this Birmingham band.

      Now playing on iTunes: some crap by Huey Lewis.  I'm still playing with the blog layout.  One day I'll get it.  For right now though, it still kinda sucks.  Sorry about that!  So the Twins won again.  It's scary that they can get away with pulling out these victories, especially with Torii, Mauer, Mientkiewicz and LeCroy hurt.  Lew Ford has proven he belongs on the big club while filling in for Hunter in center, and Henry Blanco is certainly a surprise behind the plate.  Who would have thought that a veteran catcher making the major league minimum and carrying a lifetime batting average lower than Jessica Simpson's IQ could be the guy we look to for clutch homers?  But stranger, more frightening things have happened in history.  Just look at New Coke.

      Now playing on iTunes: stellastarr* "My Coco"  Well if you're one of the 2 readers who frequent this, you'll notice the absence of the gray backdrop and in its place a drab Blogger.com default scheme.  Reason being, I gave in to popular (among people I know anyway) opinion and downloaded Mozilla Firefox for my web browsing needs.  Upon doing so, I found that my blog page wouldn't load correctly, so I vainly spent an hour or so looking for a new skin that was pleasing to look at.  I suppose next time I just need to get off my ass and learn how to code CSS.  Firefox isn't the only new thing for me; yesterday I started sporting the Kyocera SE47 slider phone. Sweet.  It's a pretty nice little phone, it doesn't take up a lot of room in my pocket and it's loud as hizell unlike the LG I had for about a year.  So that's cool.  Yay for materialism.  On other fronts: Failure Sports One is still holding out and not making themselves available to cable or satellite outlets.  Oh, and I'm still making better onscreen graphics than they ever will  urlLink [yet another example] .  So eat my ass, Pohlad.  I get my Twins info from ESPN.com or Yahoo, my baseball-on-TV fix from Extra Innings, and a good dose of Herb and Gordon curtesy of WCCO.  Hah, looks like you LOSE, motherfucker!  Wait, that makes no sense...  Oh and by the way, I was lying the other night about putting up a new post after finishing my homework.

      Now playing on iTunes: Howie Day "Perfect Time of Day"  Once again, a while since I last posted. Fun.  So what the hell was I doing last week?? Inventory and school, foolios.  Lots of time invested in those. Not much time for sleepy.  The kicker: no sleep on Saturday night.  Actually, I got about an hour, but the fact that we lost an hour kinda negates that.  Oh well.  I did get my homework done so that's golden.  I just caught one of possibly only 33 Twins games I will get to see this year.  Things that looked good:  Joesph P. Mauer, the new FieldTurf, Joe Nathan.  Things that didn't:  Radke (no surprise there), Jacque Jones, Guzman/Rivas, the Failure Sports One onscreen presence.  I could do better.  Actually, I DID do better  urlLink [example] .  Eat my ass, Failure!  It looked SO horrible.  There are no possible words to explain how much like ass Failure's graphics looked.  Actually on second thought, maybe they were designed by Austin. It totally intruded on my experience of the game, almost as much as Radke serving up gopher balls right and left.  What a bitch!  I picked up some new DVD's today.  Good thing too, because I'm down to like 4 in my current collection that I haven't watched yet. (Identity, Sum of All Fears, Radio, Pi).  But I picked up Donnie Darko, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and um, A Walk To Remember.  don't ask me why.  That's all I got for tonight. So long, kids.

(linky)  urlLink Twins strike 8-year deal with FSN  (Star Tribune)  urlLink Minnesota Twins Telecasts Return to Fox Sports Net  (MLB.com)  urlLink Twins ditch their own TV network for Fox deal  (ESPN/AP)  elation is the best word to describe my mood.  plus now the Eels are playing on the iTunes 4.5 for Windows XP.  after many months of posturing, hardline negotiating tactics, and public-relations tug o' war, the Minnesota Twins hit the cable airwaves via FOX Sports Net North, and Kevin Cattoor and company are shuttering the Failure Sports One operations.  And you know what I have to say?  It's about goddamn time.  Not only did this Victory thing crush all hope of getting a stadium built in St Paul, but it caused many of the Twins fans to really beconme disenfranchised with the whole team experience.  Not that the TV "experience" was all that great to begin with this year.  Sure, Dick and Bert were there calling the plays, but the camera work was amateurish at best and I've already expressed my feelings pn their onscreen presence.  That being, it SUCKED.  Next time, in 8 years when the Twins try this stunt again, they should really find someone with training and/or experience when assembling a CGI team.  And another tip: when the back end of the bullpen leaves for more money and you trade away two other key players for contract concerns, you shouldn't piss off the paying fan base, which is exactly what the Twins did and is the reason the average attendance has dipped almost 2,000 fans per game since last year.  Now that this whole Victory unpleasantness is out of the way, I can get down to some serious Twins watching.... if only the on-field product would improve...

      Now playing on iTunes: DMB "Jimi Thing" the live shiznit.  Spring classes are almost over bitchez!  I wasn't sure at the beginning of the semester that returning to school was the right thing for me.  Now I'm so fucking excited to get my learn on.  Yay for me.  Things I learned this semester: 1) sociology can eat a dick.  2) there are still goths in college. shudder...  3) classes are alright to deal with as long as you KEEP UP.  4) walking around a lot causes me to lose weight.  5) having an iPod is the shit. especially when working in a c-lab or the library.  think about it.

      Now playing on iTunes: five for fighting; 100 years  as I'm a lazy bastard and in a hurry to write shit, you may notice my post lacking capitalization and/or punctuation.  it will not be a regular thing I assure you, I just have a lot to say and less time to say it in.  I'm pretty pissed at myself.  yesterday or rather last night Ehlenz invited me over to the hot tub. it's always a good time.  except this time was different; Ashley was also inviting her friend Stephanie over.  now from the first time I saw her, it's safe to say I developed a little crush on her.  well anyhoo, as things work out, we talked for a little bit, then nothing.  I was confused; after all, I was told by my 2 friends that Steph shared with them her attraction to me.  why, then, is it that when I try to talk to her, I get the cold shoulder?  no one quite knows... then tonight more of the same.  we share some small talk, then I just get completely blown off. it sucks. I'm receiving so many mixed mesages, it's almost not even worth it.  at the same time, I just have this aching desire to be with her.  well that's the gist.  the back stories that do nothing but complicate things include her boyfriend who is a narccisistic ass who treats her like crap and an acquaintance of mine that wants to be with her.  I just feel horrible. it's time to go to bed.

      Now playing on iTunes: Blackstreet "Take Me There"  I'm so awake it really isn't all that funny.  It was beyond hot today and yet somehow someone made the decision that the best mode for the air conditioner was 'off'.  85 degrees Fahrenheit in the hizzle?  no prob.  Things on my mind currently:  John Fogerty is vastly over-rated.  Seriously, just listen to him.  His songs are alright, but after hearing them so many times, they just get OLD.  I love CCR, but I can only hear 'Fortunate Son' so many times before I want to similtaneously vomit and plug a bullet in my head.  I still love my iPod.  Seriously, how can one little device be so damn cool?  I just put a grip of mp3's on it and I think my total is at around 23gb.  just too cool.  that and it's seriously like being in a tight knit community.  when I see someone with the trademark white earbuds or navigating the scroll wheel, a smile and/or nod is sometimes exchanged, and occasionally I've switched iPods for a few seconds to see what the other person is listening to.  I really miss Phil Hartman.  the Followers musical happened on Sunday. and Leigh just happened to be there.  I know it's been forever but I still like her a lot, and I just wish there was more time to talk to her yesterday.  but there was barely enough time to say hi, give her a hug and just look at her for a little bit.  sigh.  I really suck sometimes.

      Now playing on iTunes: stuff  Approximately 16 years and 2 internet connections later, I've returned to tear some shit up.  I had plenty to get angry about, and soon a new post will surface on  urlLink the Gripe O' the Week!™ .  But for now, let me bring you up to speed with the behemoth that is the DAWG:  1) someone actually did semi-well at school this semester.  I wonder who that was.  Oh wait, it was me.  I'm now rocking a B average which isn't a huge deal for most people but when you consider the kind of highschool student I was, it's pretty clutch.  Yet I'm still taking some ribbing from my buddies (ahem, Nerdle) that I can do better.  We'll see, come June 28th.  2)  Twins baseball on FSN rocks my socks.  No more of that Failure Sports One BS.  Dick and Bert are in fine form, but my beloved team is hobbled by injuries!!  Stewart, Rivas, Mientkiewicz, Mauer, Punto, Koskie, Guzman, Hunter, LeCroy... the list is much too long.  Let's get these boys back into game shape and rocket to the top of the standings.  3)  yep, I'm still employed by Ultimate Electronics.  For now.  4)  I'm so tantalizingly close to getting an iBook that I'm about ready to piss my pants.  Well not really.  But I am excited.  That's gonna do it for now.  The ol' typin' hand hurts.
