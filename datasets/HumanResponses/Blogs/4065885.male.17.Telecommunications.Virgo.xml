      Well the first 6 steps in my quest for world domination is completed...  Lets review:   1: Be Born  - Most people accomplish this, so  Im not all that proud of this one, but it needed to be done.    2: Get a Name  - Can't rule the world with out a name...    3: Introduced to Games  - This is when I began my trianing of the many skills I would need to win the world over. Some abilitys such as Shell Tossing, Hedgehog Spinning, Coin Collecting, and Power Pack Collecting.    4: Mastered the English Language  - I can read, Write (kinda), and add somethings, I was ready to take on the world... Sorta   5: Learned DOS  - DOS, the basis of the Windows operating system up until recent times. Back then I was making .bat menus that pwned Windows in everyway but GUI...   6: I used a   real   PC  - Bugged my parents into buying a real computer, not the Macs or the IBMs I was used to using in school, I wanted Windows, and for a brief moment, I wanted AOL... (Soon after using AOL I got AIM ^_^) I also discovered how the internet works to a degree here, thus spawning my love for Phones and Networks... And Especially Phone Networks    7: Graduated Middle School  - My hatred for most things with two legs began to grow, I learned here how smart, and stupid a person could be at the same time. I also learned that no one cares, unless its their problem.   8: Charity  - I learned that doing things for free earns people's trust. Now, Im a nice person, so I wouldent exploit it unless I had to... But, it was a good lesson on how people worked. For the record, I worked in the AV room in the High School for 3 years and had the master key 90% of the time.    9: Complete Eagle Project  - Done... I learned a bunch, most of which I'll post later in the form of an essay only 5 - 10 people will read....   10: Eagle Rank  - Almost done... The steps that follow will be made up as I go, but its really childs play ;)   Im sure that bored most of you into near insanity, but it can be used as a guidline... I guess.  So yes, I handed in my Paperwork to council today, and its in their hands now. Im sick of the topic, so Im sure you all are too. Im glad its semi-over and I cant wait to get on with my life... On a lighter note, I just finished watching the Olympics OP and... the tortch looks like a big blunt. Take it as you will.  No matter, 2 Days left ^_^

      Another action packed summer  ending  already....  Just got a call from my college (DeVry University) and im starting classes August 30th, as opposed to the original plan of November 1st, which was adapted from the first idea of me going to school in Missori, in July >_>  Yay...  ACT test was rejected, they didnt even grade it because of a screw up on the school's side. The only reason why I took that God forsaken test was for money, a scholarship no less... So the deadline passed and there is no reason for a retake. Whoop-t-doo.  So now that im done with this, here is an overview of the last 2 weeks of the summer....   [August 13th]  - Bringing paperwork to Suffolk county Council, last step for me other than to answer a few questions... *crosses fingers* {On the proof read I noticed that tomorrow is... Friday the 13th... Good Lord}   [August 15th]  - Leaving for camp, incase you havent noticed yet, I'm a Boy Scout, and soon to be leader ;)   [August 15th - 22nd]  - Camp, back that Sunday   [August 23rd]  - Registration with DeVry (College) Woo.   [August 24th]  - WAS my ACT test date -_-'   [August 30th]  - College ;_;  Thats the rest of my summer... If you want to go to the beach or do anything semi-fun afterwards, give me a call. If im not doing HW....

      First Post, As Im sure you can tell...  I have been working on this Eagle Project and all the paperwork associated with it for the last 13 months.... Yesterday I finally finished it. All the paperwork was filled out, pages sorted, blue cards filed, and questions asked. Only three steps left...  ~  Aquire Signatures ~  Submit to Suffolk County Council ~  Sit with board and review material  So even after all this work raising money, orginizing people, buying materials, putting up the pole, and doing the applications a group of 5 people can still turn around and tell me to shove it -_-'  All part of the lesson I hope. . . .  If you have no idea what Im talking about these links should help:  ~   urlLink What Is An Eagle Scout?  ~   urlLink Eagle Scout Rank Requirements   Maybe I'll post some new stuff later,  c05m0  urlLink
