      I can't write a poem, It's way to hard to think. The kids are screaming, My Desk is leaning And I can hear the kitchen sink. I can't write a poem, My page has been repeatedly cut. Carlee's stomping, And my dog is chomping At his naked butt. I can't write a poem, There's not a thought in my head. The rain is pounding, My alarm is sounding And my pencil's almost run out of led. I can't write a poem, I believe it's like a chore. You write for hours, About sunshine and flowers And you're expected t write more. I just wrote a poem, I guess it was pretty easy. Not about sunshine, Not about flowers, And nothing really cheesy.

      It's dark, Silent. You try to tiptoe your way towards the door. Not making a sound. You finally reach your destination And you grab the knob. Turning it ever so slowly I clicks and you open the door But you find yourself peering into an unfamiliar closet. A tear of ice runs down your face, For you know he is behind you. He grabs your shoulder And tries to cover your mouth. You bite, Hard. The taste of blood reaches your tongue, The taste of satisfaction. You hear what must be a scream But it's all a blur. You start to run, But you have no idea where. You are now outside, But it is dark. No lights, Not even the moon to guide you, Everything is against you. Suddenly, Something hits you. You fall. Now lying in a bed of blood. You try to play dead, But he isn't fooled. He starts hurting you. But you feel no pain. In your mind you have gone to another place. Another hit, Something worse than before. It brings you back from that wonderful place. You are now peering into his eyes. His face is red with anger, Eyes filled with determination. He is a stranger, And you are his victim. You think to yourself, "Was this really worth the money?" He is now out of sight. You lie there, Motionless. Your mind has taken you back to that wonderful place. And you realise, You have no feeling, You are dead.

      This morning, while I was brushing my teeth, I was walking around the bathroom. I stopped, standing in front of my toilet, when out of no where, a bird flew into the room and hit me smack dab in the face. I opened my eyes as I was falling just in time to see my toothbrush fly through the air and into the toilet, which was, ironically unflushed. I peered inside the toilet, holding my nose to block out the stench, and closed my eyes to block out the sight. Bravely, I reached into the bowl, under the water and started to feel around. Finally I grabbed something, pulled it out, and opened my eyes. To my horrific surprise, I saw I was holding an unmentionable item. I then screamed and dropped it back into the bowl, where it belongs!

      Shrouded by shadow, moving ever so slow, They sense something but how, I don’t know Every wretched word they utter makes me wench, Instead of climbing the ladder of wisdom they dig a trench. Following every little word, such happy little sheep, So it was their fate to be the exact opposite of deep. I can taste their discomfort, sour it is, It bubbles under the surface like a carbonated fizz. Before another moment wastes I make my pounce, This being stupendous leap of faith and not uncalculated bounce. I take my tool, using it as an uncivilized club, CRACK!  Goes the skull and they fall down with a thud, Their eyes still with that blank stare and a tiny blot of drool, Despite all their book learning they are yet a complete fool. Mass amounts of blood flows now, a boiling river of vengeance, A tickling sensation mixes both right and wrong, not a lot makes sense, Suddenly they snap out of it my actions have had no avail, Expressionless, dumbfounded, they ask if I broke their nail. With a terrible scream I take my steel-toed weapon of doom, Raise my foot and push them down, we’re the only two in the room. Snap!  There’s a crack and tissue flies all around, Alas they are gone, what satisfaction I’ve found, I snatch my original choice weapon for the deed, Looking for a new thing on which my soul to feed, Tightly I grip the thing and do a little hop, And clean up the mess with my Swiffer Wet Mop.
