      Okay so the other day this guy at work asked me about this new salegirl they have working. Well I told the truth, that she has horrible fashion sense. I mean she wore white sandals her first full day of work. No one wears white sandals, that's just wrong. So anyways, the next day she wore these 4 foot disco platform sandals. See I can rock those, it's not a question of bad fashion sense there, it's just that she wore them to WORK. If you're going clubbing or whatever, that's fine, but you don't get all professional looking and then put on tacky platform shoes, I have tall shoes but believe me, they DO NOT look like that.  Okay so back to what Mr. Closer was telling me. Well he asked me what I thought about her and I just shrugged. She's okay I guess. Didn't really think much of her, but then again I don't think too much of anyone their first week at the dealership.  So then he was like "you really don't like her do you?" and I said "well frankly no. Why should I?". The next day I was talking to my gal pal at the dealership about it and she totally agreed. The thing is me and H and M are all girls who don't have girlfriends. We've totally had bad experiences of being stabbed in the back by girls and we're extremely cautious of other girls. Guys we don't think much about but girls are catty. It might seem like a real contradiction I mean, the 3 of us not being friendly with the new girl but unless you give us a good reason to welcome you, then you're not.

      Okay, I now have I think 3 blogs on this site and 3 that are on different servers, I like to keep stuff seperate but I guess these 3 here are posts that really don't belong on my other blogs or that I really can't put there for the time being. As it is now my main blog is being moved (not by me), and in order to update the secondary one I need the first one, same goes for the 3rd one. Confused yet? Ya should be. Cuz I am.

      I had an interesting conversation today with a new friend and we got to talking about music. Well, I'm a huge fan of all music, well not all but...I basically listen for 2 main things that appeal to me, lyrics or the melody, well you might say that's all that's really in a song but I like to think most songs are a lil more complex. Well the ones that appeal to me anyways. It's fun talking to Joe because he has similar taste in music as me but we're introducing each other to bands we like. Most of the music exchanging has gone good, except that I really didn't like the Radiohead song he recommended, I just didn't like that I could barely understand the lead singer. A lot of songs I like I couldn't barely understand the lyrics, like "Run" by Snow Patrol, there was a section I couldn't not figure out and so it made the rest of the lyrics not make sense, so I got curious and I had to look it up. It all clicked after I got that one sentence. But after reading the lyrics, I realized what a sweet emotional song "Run" was. I never realized that before. So it totally bumped up my rating of the song. Okay so my top 5 songs of the week are:  1. Don't Take Your Love Away- VAST (This song is just a real masterpiece, it's got beautiful music, and the song is simple yet you can feel the emotion. It's just amazing and something you have to listen to.) 2. It's Over Now- Ricky Fante (He's got a really soulful voice, it makes you think the song is much older than it actually is, he was born a few decades too late) 3. Through The Blue- Evan and Jaron (it's sad and sweet, not too poppy) 4. Sweetest Goodbye- Maroon 5 (It's a lil poppy I know but I still love this song because it's a sad song, and I just love those) 5. Run- Snow Patrol (Like I explained above it's got incredible lyrics, and the singer's voice is great)

      Well I'm not unfamiliar with blogging, I already have more than 3 blogs but I kinda wanted something that allowed me to be less personal. I mean, I don't wanna share too many details on my life here. I wanna just be vague. So that's how it is.
