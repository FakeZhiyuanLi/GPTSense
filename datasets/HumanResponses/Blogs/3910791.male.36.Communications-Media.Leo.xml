      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was only one word that came to mind when I sniffed her panties--familiar. It was especially odd because four hours ago we didn’t exist to each other. But the perfume was definitely a room I’d been in before.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracy was this delightful lady I met downtown at this spot called The Basement, a dancehall in the basement of an abandoned church, not that far from the Capitol Building in D.C.  &nbsp; Washington was truly a tale of two cities-there was the mall and the Air and Space Museum and all that, but go about ten blocks in any direction and it was a totally different town-with faces, and dirt and violence and desperation.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in the toilet pissing and she bounded in the men’s room and threw up in the stall next to me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was wearing a tight pink lame skirt, and when she knealt before the porcelain god, the skirt split straight up the back and exposed the white satin of her panties. The contrast of her mocha-like skin and the shiny material caught my attention. I was a sucker for a damsel in distress.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were four other dudes in the bathroom laughing and trying to stay out of her line of fire. I rushed into the stall and locked it behind me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Wh-who the fuck are you?” she said, barely lifting her head from the toilet. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m the one that’s going to get you out of here.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stood, then closed the lid and sat on it. She was still attractive, even though she had just puked and was sweating like a horse.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What predicament?” she said, holding her head in her hands. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Well, you’re throwing up in the men’s room of a packed nightclub with a dramatically torn skirt. Sounds like a problem to me.” I handed her my handkerchief.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How do I know you’re not a psycho pervert?”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m a musician.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I don’t feel any better.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone pounded hard on the stall door behind me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Hey, you two break it up in there!”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Just a fuckin’ second!” I shouted back.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a pause. “Okay jackoff, you’re second is up.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took my jacket off and handed it to her. She put it on and snatched the remains of her skirt off and threw it in the unflushed toilet. She tied her black blouse to her waist.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You’re not too shy are you?”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m standing in a men’s room in my underwear. Does that sound shy to you? My name’s Tracy, by the way. Just in case anyone asks.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “My name’s Myron X. Nobody should ask though.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I unlocked the door and this bouncer the size of a Hollywood billboard with no neck and a NASA-like headset on stood there with a superior look on his face.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “My girlfriend was sick. Her name’s Tracy.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Then you better take Tracy home. Now.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He escorted us to the door. She walked in front of us. My jacket looked like a wrap skirt on her and did not conceal her choice in undergarments. The whole club stopped and watched our little parade. Tracy played it up, too, smiling, waving; she even loosened my jacket and flashed a couple of people. I liked her spirit.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I suppose I should thank you,” she said, after we got outside, walking past the line of people still trying to get in. She bummed a cigarette from some over made-up jailbait. “Nah, no one ever says thank you in polite society. Can I give you a ride home?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled. “Sure--you buying breakfast?”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I usually drink breakfast--I don’t eat it, I don’t cook it and I definitely don’t buy it.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Then how we gonna eat?”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked across the street. There was a small grocery store still open.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Are you privy to the culinary arts?”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “No doubt,” she said, “But we have to go to your house. My stove’s been busted since last winter.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m not taking you to my house. A week from now I’ll be standing in a holding cell trying to explain a rape charge to my lawyer.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You think I’d do that to you?” she smiled, “people in polite society don’t do things like that, now do they? Besides, if I wear this jacket home, I’m keeping it. I have a pair of jeans this would be smashing with.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled at her.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You’ll just have to trust me.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was five hours ago. Now she was sleeping on my couch in a T-shirt I gave her. I found her panties on the bathroom floor. Funny, I hadn’t thought about screwing her until now. Suddenly there was a tapping on my shoulder.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What are you doing?” she asked.

      interesting election coverage this year...an incumbent terror-warrior versus two of the richest men to seek the high office in American history. It's like Field of Dreams for real..."if you build the campaign, they will come."   the conventions are rock concerts for old people. The lollapalooza for all the hall monitors and squealers of the world. is there anything more unconventional than a convention?   If you're a politico, your job is to convince enough people you deserve the gig to have it? What if all gigs were like that? With most jobs you're trying to convince two, maybe three people tops, that you deserve it. What if to get a gig at Fed Ex you had to bring in a petition of three thousand signatures? Would you be able to do it?

      My connect at Citadel systems was this tall, thin Japanese guy named Chen. He told us to meet him at the News Bar in the Village. He was a tech assistant in the video game R & D department. He’d been there since his teenage years and was considered to be the Mozart of software programming. But over the last year the shine on his star has begun to fade and he was demoted to a lowly ops assistant despite the company posting a modest 30 million dollar profit for two quarters in a row. After he was dissed for a promotion for the third time, I heard about him unloading prototypes at cost.   	I hooked him up with this big-breasted com specialist from NASA named Doris and he’s treated me like his best friend ever since. Chen hits me off with beta tested  prototypes just to see how well they work. Then I sell copies to a few knock off companies I know. Pirate video games are still big on the black market.   	I told Gypsy, my intrepid tour guide, “Now, when we get in here, don’t say anything to him, only me. He’s crazy paranoid because the Citadel has people watching him. When I talked to him on the phone, he sounded like he was wigged out on Ping and up all night flying in from Paris.”  	“Usually no, but in his condition now, I say all bets are off. The only thing know I he isn’t armed.”  	“I’ll tell you what,” Gypsy said as we entered the News Bar. We sat at a table near the window facing the street so Chen would see us. “You buy one of those bottled juices over there and drink it down fast, then give it to me. If he tries anything, I’ll bust his ass with that bottle, but good.”  	“Just be cool man-" I said, stopping when I saw Chen at the window peering in. He was carrying a thick Halliburton briefcase. I motioned to Gypsy to go get a juice from the bar as entered and sat down.   	“What took you so long, man? I’ve been waiting almost an hour. I had to go get coffee-“  	“Get coffee?” I said, “Chen, this is a coffee bar-“  	“Coffee sucks in here. I had to Dean and Deluca down the street".  	“Just relax, Chen,” I said. He was more jittery than I thought. Chen was built like an Olympic swimmer, and his clothes always hung off of him. He was in a wrinkled black Italian suit, a white button down with a stain on the front, Frankenstein shoes, bug-eye wraparound shades and a red fez.   	“This won’t take long, I’ll get you back to the airport myself.” I flipped open my phone and dialed Jojo the Limo Driver. “What do you have for me?”  	Finally he seemed to relax and began to laugh. “I made this especially for you.” He put his case on the table and opened it. Gypsy came over with a nearly empty Snapple bottle. Chen tensed back up.   	“Who's he?”  	“He’s my ride,” I said, looking in the case, “This looks like a video camera.”  	“It is, except is uses a hard disk recording mechanism and the lens is especially designed for shooting bright targets in low light. It’s my movie bootlegger special.”  	“So I can take this to a movie theatre and shoot a better copy of the movie?”   	“Better than in the ones you’ve been sending me. But listen, you need a Teledyne Video Imager to filter the picture before you put it on videotape or DVD. Without it, you have copies that look like copies." Chen said.    	“And you did this for me? That’s touching. This thing is impressive. You still have any contacts in Southeast Asia? I can get Tom Cruise’s new movie next week, and I want to turn it over fast.”  	Chen started staring intently at his hands and rocking in his seat.   	“I’ll have to call you about that. Look, wire-transfer money six thousand for camera. And a few valium; I need some sleep.”  	Me and Gypsy looked disgustedly at each other.   	“Goddammit Chen, why didn’t you say that on the phone. I asked you if you were cool and you said yes!”   	“Look Myron X, I’m sorry, you know I’m not usually like this, but the pressure is killing me! The only time we are not watched is when we’re at work, So the only place any of us feels safe is at work. All the techs in my sector are either on powerful psychoactive drugs or banging each other in lice-ridden opium dens in Shanghai harbor. The perversion of people under stress is astounding. You know I haven’t slept in four days?”  	I looked at Gypsy. He whispered to me he had maybe a half dozen Adovans and eight pellets of Ya Ba, a wicked, savage recreational drug from Thailand. If I gave Chen any of that crap, he’d be a serial killer by tomorrow afternoon.  	The drugs would have to wait. My phone rang. I handed it to Gypsy.   	“If that’s Jojo, tell him I have any emergency rush to Kennedy for double the fee. Ask him if he’s get any Vees.”  	“Take care of that camera." Chen said. "I may be traded soon.” 	“Traded? Like a baseball player?”  	“Kind of.” A rival company will post a job opening at my level, maybe for a little more money, a little more prestige. Who ever the job listing is posted for always finds that person somehow. Then my company will do the same thing. I’ll apply over there and get hired and the same will happen at my company.” 	“What if you stay on?”  	“Then the job goes to someone else and you get phased.”  	“Phased?”  	“Yeah, phased out of your section, then you’re department, then out of the building.”  	“Jesus, that’s harsh. You should defect. Can you do that?”  	“Do you know what kind of voodoo I’d have to pull off to get that kind of action? Only the superstars even get that option. Everybody else is straight hustling. I’m telling you man, the more money this tech shit makes, the more these assholes want to play hardball.”  	Chen lit his third Pall Mall and stared past my shoulder at the street. I felt bad; all he probably needed was a couple hours in the Geisha House Massage Parlor, and I’d love to take care of him, but there was no time. Gypsy tapped his watch to remind me we still had a meeting with Dr. Hanif “Horseshoe” Muradi, noted electronic systems theorist and compulsive gambler. We sat quietly until JoJo the Limo Driver screeched to a halt outside in his fire engine red Cadillac stretch.   	We went outside.   	JoJo got out of the car. Sorry I’m late man, I had to run to the Bronx. Where we going?”  	“To the airport. Kennedy. This is my man Chen. He’s very cool people, so don’t mess with him, and don’t give him the run around. Unload him at Kennedy at the British Airways terminal. Can I give you the fee later?”  	“Yeah, no big deal. But cash though. You got an Valiums?” I’m still speeding from two days ago.”  	Jesus, doesn’t anybody just go to bed anymore?  	“All I got left are some Adovans."  I looked in my kit bag. I found a 35mm film canister half full of tiny yellow pills. I took out ten, took another two and swallowed them, then pulled Chen around to the other side of the car. I handed him the vial.   	“Don’t give JoJo any until you are out of the car at the airport. That flaky bastard will take them while he’s driving and you’ll end up in Boston.”  	I put Chen in the car and looked at Gypsy. He lit a Camel and spat at a dog pissing in the gutter. The limo pulled off down Sixth Avenue. We grabbed the camera and split.

      I'm approaching the two thirds mark of my novel "Word is Bond". This is the part of the marathon where you being to hallucinate and wonder why you thought this was so important to begin with. As long as I stay consistent with the theme, then I can make it to the other side.   The whole point is Silver is a bad person that wants to be a good person. She lies, cheats and steals, but only so she can provide for her friend Marris and her daughter India, the closest thing she has to a family. It isn't that she doesn't believe in love, she just doesn't think she deserves it.   So far everyone that's read it, got into it, although my first lesson is don't let anyone read it until it's finished, or close to it. And, until you write the words "THE END" you got nothing.   I shoulda been an architect or a dentist...

      LIAR’S POKER By  Myron X.   I didn’t know what demon was driving me into the street, but he was a relentless little bastard. I went downtown to check out the freaks and the crazy people.   Insanity was terribly entertaining. Word on the street had it that there was a poetry slam going down at the Mabogo Café. I knew the clique that was putting it on, Vagabond Arts and Media. There were about eight of them, but the only one I was familiar with the leader, Eric, a smooth-looking Asian that had his way with the ladies. He’d seen me performing around town and told me about the Vagabond slam. They were just hustling for money, just like everyone else.   	I was on the Metro train sniffing after this white girl that barged her way past me on the escalator. Her sweet perfume got me. She was nineteen at best, with too much eyeliner on and a tiny gold hoop in her pointed nose. Her jeans hung off her hips and her shirt ended just under her breasts.   	I followed her casually to the end of the platform. She stuffed her farecard in her back pocket, then pulled it out again and looked at it. When she did, a dollar bill fell to the floor. She walked away.   I walked up to the dollar and stepped on it. She looked back it me. I smiled. She rolled her eyes and kept walking. You go right ahead Miss Thing, keep on walking. I bent down and picked up the dollar. 	“Hey, that’s mine,” she said.  	“You talking to me?”  	“Yeah, I’m talking to you,” she said, “you took my dollar.”  	I heard the train coming.  	“I don’t know what you’re talking about. You trying to hustle me?”  	“I dropped that dollar. And then you took it.”   	“Look honey, anything that hits the floor is public domain.”  	“Don’t call me honey. You gonna give me a dollar back or do I have to call a cop?”  	“You would actually bring down the heat over a lousy buck? I’ll tell you what. I’ll give you a chance to win it back. You know how to play liar’s poker?”  	“Never heard of it.”  	“This’s the deal. Take this dollar. Look at the serial number. Now I look at another dollar. I bet that I have more repeated numbers than you do. That’s how you bet. You raise the stakes by using higher numbers.”   	The train pulled into the station. We sat in a pair of seats. I took out a dollar as the train doors closed.  	“Um, two threes,” she said.   	“Four threes,” I said, “Two fours.”   	“I have three fours,” she said, proud of herself.   	“Five Fives,” I said.   	“Bullshit. Let me see.” I showed her.   	“You do,” she said, “Now what?”   	“Now you find another dollar to play with,” I said, snatching the bill away from her.   	We played four more times. By the time we got to Gallery Place, I had all her money. She was good natured about it though. Nothing sexier than a sportsman’s attitude.

      LADY DAY by  Myron X.   I liked to drink with Lady Day because she was an ex-hippie jazz head from way back. Now she was the 48 year old owner of the Harbor Bar and grill in the small Jersey shore town of Long Branch. Whenever I needed to get out of New York and have a look around, I frequently found myself at her place. It was a block from the train station and I was always welcome on her couch.  She told colorful stories of her exploits and tactics during the social revolution of the 60s. She claimed to be one of the few that attended Woodstock and Altmont and survived them both.  I sat at the bed of the dark bar closest to the door and sipped a glass of wine while she herded the last of her regular customers out the door and locked it behind them.   “My regulars think I’m having an affair with you.”   She sat on the stool next to mine and poured her herself the remains of the carafe she set out for me. She was a weary white woman that filled a pair of jeans to the limit with her meaty hips, not wide, but soft and fleshy. Her eyes were a liquid light blue and she always kept a pack of cowboy killers in the breast packet of her ex-husband’s short sleeved, white Arrow shirts, which she was always wearing. Her D-cup support bra always showed through the material of the shirt.   “Who cares about them? They’re just mad because you’ve developed a taste for chocolate.”  She let out a low, sexy gut laugh that never quite made it past her lips. “I care about them sweetie. They make up with their wives and I’m out of business. I’ve always had a sweet tooth though.”  “You just after me for my money.”  “What money?”  “The fortunes I’m going to be swimming in after I sell this movie I’m writing. I’m buying an island in the Caribbean. Wanna come for a swim?”  “You’re cute. You remind me of this guy I used to date named Kevin. He was black. He was the sexiest man-he looked like Jim Brown.”  “Who?”  “You mean to tell me-”  “I’m just kidding.”  “We used to lay on the floor of his filthy apartment in Newark naked and high on pot listening to Miles Davis reading Eldridge Cleaver or Malcom X-he used to call me his funny valentine. You don’t remember that, do you?”  “Of course I do.” I said. I hummed a few bars of it into the bottom of my glass. She poured another one for each of us. She took a cigarette out of her pack and I lit it for her.   “I got a wedding invitation from my step-daughter the other day. Remember I told you about the guy Stephanie moved to Maine with, the dentist? Well, she got a ring out of him, along with the house with the white picket fence and the family car in the driveway.”  “You sound like it’s pissing you off.”  “It is...and it isn’t. Lord knows I’m glad Stephi stopped being a silly-assed tart and settled herself down, and I hope it lasts, I really hope it does. I hope she’s got some substance to her, not all shallow like her father. Boy, he was a piece of work. Worked like a slave just so he could have the latest whatever-car, tape deck, tennis racket, motorcycle, you name it. That’s how he always measured his success in real estate-by how much he had. At first he loved me because I was so simple; earthy was his term. Fifteen years later it was the very thing he couldn’t deal with. I didn’t want any of his junk, I wasn’t impressed with it. Said I was so behind the times. The smartest two things I did in my life was let him buy this place for me and letting him skip off to California with his vapid little secretary Tina Big Tits."   “Tina Big Tits...she sounds like a blow-up doll.”  “She was. And she did anything he said. He needed a woman like that, some gum-chewing, salad-eating bubble-head to do his bidding and his laundry. He used to like me because I sassed him. Then that changed and he had to get some from somewhere else.   “It didn’t bother you he was cheating on you?”  “Of course it did. He was my husband after all. I did love him in some twisted way. He was a liar and a cheap hustler, but he didn't start that way. That’s why I didn’t give him a hassel about a divorce. I told him to do what he wanted as long as he signed the bar over to me. He couldn’t handle his liquor anyway.” I nodded as she stubbed out her cigarette and gulped down the last of her wine. Lady Day was a cool jazz melody that simply didn’t end, she just hung in the air like cigarette smoke.

      I didn't know what a blog was until 10 minutes ago. Dom P stopped by, and he was on me about turning one of my sceenplays into an actual film. We agreed that this was the era of the DYI; anyone that gotten anywhere in the last 10 years, started out selling out the trunk.   Dom tlls me a blog is a kind of journal, where you can rant and rave and cats respond to it...  No Kidding.   He tries to tell me about some dude, out on Frisco, that's supposed to have a blog...I look up two names, but get nothing.   Wayne Chung...  That's the name, no kidding.   The site comes up and he shows me what's what.   How about that.   A little backround on Myron X; I'm a former DJ, redord producer magazine contributor, movie critic, screenwriter and a staff writer for a children's TV show...I've averaged a job about every three years for the last twelve years. I currently reside in Washington D.C. with my wife Nettie and our two kids...  More about that later.
