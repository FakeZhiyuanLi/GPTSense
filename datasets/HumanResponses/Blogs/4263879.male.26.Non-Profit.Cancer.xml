       we're scheduled to meet K's dad today, all of us. scary. not completely sure what he's got to say, and not completely sure how we're supposed to respond. but it's a step in a new direction; i'm glad that what we've been doing is generating enough interest - or has raised enough concern.       speaking of concern... i'm using up my hall passes with mak and ayah, walking on thin ice. just a matter of time before a slip up of chernobylesque proportions and i sink into the icy depths, the solid ground of support beneath me having finally been worn away. chait. drama lebih. nak kena jaga diri, jaga masa, jaga hati je. keep your head up. people care about you, act accordingly.       disappointment is such a nasty thing to bring home every morning. i need to stop that.      laters.

      saya ingin menyatakan kesyukuran saya kerana tidak ditakdirkan menjadi peguam. too much politics. i'd be liable to hit someone on my first day in court.

      courthouses should commence proceedings at 10; getting people out of bed at 5am to defend themselves in front of a sherry drinking officah of tha law would just encourage more violent crime. in short, yaaaaaaaawn, dagnabbit.  and the olympic games haven't really gotten to me yet. they really should get inline street included. yeah, man. that would whip the llama's ass.  laters.

      i was playing this really hokey game where you play a knight templar making your way through medieval europe and the holy land, hacking away at demonically possessed crusaders and saracens (isn't it lovely how they diplomaticised the whole christian-muslim conflict?), saving the ancient world from satan's mad scheme for world domination. hey, i told you it was hokey. anyway, i got stuck on the same level, dying over and over again.  i know how the game will end, it's pretty boring. but i kept on replaying that level, masochist that i am. maybe i should stop replaying the same level and move on to another game. i'm done with proving trivial points, like my emotional endurance. i want to play command and conquer and really screw things up on a mass scale. my personal life doesn't need crusading. i should just be glad that it's properly installed and running.  speaking of running: i need to sleep. in the deepest, innermost depths of my loins, i know this to be true. i wouldn't be spewing video game analogies if i were sober and well-rested. but even if i slept, i'd end up waking up on the same level again, not knowing how to quit to windows. (oh lord i did it again.)  mental note to self: must see zarim. burn him some porn. yeah. must make sure funds last long enough to see adik on the weekend. i hope i don't have to meet adik's sister. too complicated, no strength to smile and make nice. i have 2 rolls of film left, and i feel like walking. that should be a plan. i must formulate it properly.  but now, sleep.  sleep, goddamnit.
