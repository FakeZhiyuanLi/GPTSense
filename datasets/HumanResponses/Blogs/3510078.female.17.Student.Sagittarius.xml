       urlLink    Most people naively believe people when they say they're in the modeling business.  I don't know what I exactly am trying to prove, but I guess a little eye candy (or maybe I shouldn't flatter myself) wouldn't hurt anyway.&nbsp; urlLink

       Hey y'all! I'm trying out this online journal thing. I figure a place to keep my thoughts would be a good sort of therapy, I guess. So anyways, the name's Kaleigh (KAYlee), known as Kaleigh Jo or just plain ole Jo. I'm a seventeen year old southern redhead currently working in and out of a modeling career. Don't worry, I'm not ditsy, or a spoiled brat, or, based on my whereabouts, a hick!  Getting ready for a great summer and a great senior year in highschool ahead of me. Currently single, but not exactly looking, annddd not exactly NOT looking either. I'm a strong believer in fate, so when the right guy comes along, I'll know it, hopefully. Long stories in love. But who doesn't have any? Interested? Just ask me about 'em, I'll spill my heart out. ;) I love people, they absolutely fascinate me. So feel free to write me on this journal or AIM me at Goober3316. Actually, PLEASE do. I'd love to meet you!  Can't wait to get this thing started...:::crosses fingers::: -Kaleigh Jo-

       urlLink    WHAT KIND OF LOVE DO I NEED?   I'm a FROZEN QUEEN! :  You don't want love to come through to you, You like yourself the way you are. To be unreachable, no need to show feelings. Hiding everything inside you. Chances are you are already used to it. You say to yourself that you don't need anyone, that you stand on your own two feet or that you don't have time for these things. But in bitter reality, you are scared to get hurt. You feel safe where you are: by yourself; no one can hurt you there. You invent your own relationships in your dreams. The only thing you (think you) need to know is just if you COULD get a partner. That's it.   &nbsp; urlLink     Wow.  Surprisingly, and sadly, this isn't too far off...makes me sound pretty stupid, but I guess I haven't been kicking my own ass for no reason if this really does describe me.  Oh well. In the meantime, I remain a quiz FIEND! yay for quizilla.

      Do you ever find yourself nose pressed against the glass of Meaning, trying to see past the unruly window into tomorrow?   And you can't, you cry, and stomp your feet. Because your heavy breathing (careless nature of a careless human) keeps making things that much more unclear and jaded.  We need a room, a shed to break. Watch ourselves crumble in a room void of anything and everything and nothing at all.  The soul is a barren mystery.  And you are its keeper. But you're blind and you don't want to see.   Struggle for originality and depth, and rise up to lowered expectations that we've set for ourselves.  You're like all the rest, aren't you?  Another crow aching to be like an elusive bluebird .

      i want to be amazing. dangle my feet over the edge of a rotting bridge six hundred feet above the ground and not worry about what happens  if i fall. sit inside a raindrop and marvel at how wonderful it is to get wet. be your angel speared and broken, the kind you still lose your breath over, even when my knees are collasped, dramatic, overly insecure and losing more reason as i go. lie in the back of my mind and sip cool lemonade and not even have to think before laughing when you ask if everything's going to be alright, if we're going to be okay. because, of course we are. this is my fairy tale, love, this is my dream, we can fly on red ducklings if you want, we can be tied to a ship and blasted through the sky off to neptune, on the border of never never land, using foreign speech, a tongue new to you but suddenly it doesn't make a difference as long as you're attached to me by lip and hip and taste and waist alike, man and woman, it's all the same, we're all hungry to be loved by anyone. and you're just like any other lonely child,  bled out of your integrity and desparate for anyone, anything to belong to.  so maybe you can belong to me.

       I am so tired...of everything.&nbsp; Your mind can only take so much, and when it reaches that limit, your body physically suffers as well, I guess. I feel sick. I think I'm really just disgusted with myself.&nbsp;   I'm dealing with some issues right now, some people, some things of my past.&nbsp;It just won't go away.  He  won't go away .  I'm not running. I'm standing right here facing it, just very, very still.&nbsp; Isn't that enough?&nbsp;   I won't say I'm sorry for what I did. I'm sorry certain things happened. I'm sorry that you didn't like that. But I am not sorry for being who I am and the way I am.&nbsp;I will always be...this.&nbsp;It's the one thing that never changes, the one constant in the world: my brokenness.    You can either turn away now, or prove me wrong by actually accepting this. For now.    &nbsp;  --Lied.   She lied again. You knew.   Little girls grow up to be wives, and they lose all their dreams and aspirations.  No, not her.  There's so much that she could be, if  only she tried... and tried hard.  But she's hostile and hot tempered, unwilling to change her ways.   She lied again. You knew.   You never look at me, he said. You look,  but your eyes never seem to really meet mine.  Yeah, she knows; she's perfected it  as a way to get inside your mind, and keep you out of hers.  She's distant. LOOK AT HER.  See how distant she is?   She lied again. You knew.   Freedom to choose, freedom to fight;  it's what she believes in, what she stands for,  yet when she has it, she gives it away.  Freedom means honesty, and of that,  she already has too little.  Lying is her way of trying to mend what was broken.  Her way of beating the game. And she'll beat it. She always beats it.   But she lied again. And she didn't care that you knew.

      I'm having problems coping with my past...reoccurences are happening.   [queenly charges.]   Darkness bundles itself into corners, unfurling along the floor.  Generally, they say it's over as soon as you can't picture anything else in your mind.  But I don't know them and they don't know you.  So, I'll take you anyway.  Between the floor boards, moonlight twines with dust creating a froth that would be beautiful if I cared.  It seems that life is nothing until you meet someone you care about.   And I won't die like this again.  I won't tell you, or them. Because I don't trust you, or them.  I'm quite through with being open.   One man told me many times, that loving was nothing but a weakness and I knew he was bitter, so why listen? Well, listen now, my little children, my little cubs, he was right, and I'm not doing it anymore.  I'm simply cutting it off, the way I was supposed to before;  queens can't have liabilities.     [liberation.]   I know you're&nbsp; tired now, but there's no need to worry; we aren't going to be (anything) much longer, because you've decided for us and we're going to die.  And as I lay across from you, dust brushing the inside of my eyelids, (because how am I to maintain that beautiful blue&nbsp; in death?) sigh in contentment; you don't have to struggle anymore.  Vines twist into our bodies puncturing our hearts, wrapping around our lungs and don't you dare cry out, because this is what you wanted; your freedom, your liberation.   our skin decays, slips of softness blackening to moist petals; and they rain, swaying as the breeze stirs them; they fall.  our tongues shrivel, cherry wedges curling in upon themselves before drying, maturely ripened and ready to beplucked.  our bodies decompose; sweet sweat a peeling finish, hair a frothy crown,and forgotten vows a mocking murmur.  we die, beautiful and calm in the idiocy of a release that's nothing but a beginning to what you thought life mimicked (hell).&nbsp;   we died, side by side and we are still so alone.  we're dead, and I suppose that it really doesn't matter if you loved me or not, 'cause now I have Satan to love me and his kisses burn even more than yours.

      (Thanks Nick.) Only puttin up&nbsp;one song for now...love this song, and i'll post another good one called 'Take Care' later.  "She Changes Your Mind"  She changes your mind When you see the joy in her eyes It makes you feel It makes you feel  She draws your eyes from all the things That have made you numb And makes you feel And makes you feel  If I could open up my heart And let her out  I would never have to sing her name aloud It was your "hello" that kept me hanging on every word And your "goodbye" that keeps me listening  For your voice around each corner It keeps me listening  For your voice around each corner  And I'll sing songs to help me stay up all night long 'Cause I don't want to go to sleep And I'll sing songs and hope you're listening carefully And know exactly what I mean You know exactly what I mean (When I say)  If I could open up my heart And let her out  I would never have to sing her name aloud It was your "hello" that kept me hanging on every word And your "goodbye" that keeps me listening  For your voice around each corner It keeps me listening  For your voice around each corner  It's the song you must seek out When your night has just begun In the distance you can find the lips From which was sung a melody  It was your "hello" that kept me hanging on every word And your "goodbye" that keeps me listening  For your voice around each corner I was hanging on every word And your "goodbye" that keeps me listening  For your voice around each corner It keeps me listening for your voice around each corner.

       It actually rained in Arizona yesterday.&nbsp; It was short, but sweet.&nbsp; I was missing the rain in Louisiana.&nbsp; I always love the way it smells after a good rain in the desert.&nbsp; So, naturally, I wrote about it.&nbsp; Enjoy!    &nbsp; [- After the Rain .-]  But it's beautiful; water trickles down a crumbled leaf, and I wonder if people are akin to anything adjacent to themselves.  The droplet of star-shine glimmers, a flicker of galaxy trekking the crinkled membrane. So, we break, beings frail enough to fracture into so many slivers of human understanding, and it barely exists.   But it's beautiful, a fragile film developing across the open porch; the web trembles gently, humming while beads brook the thread.  I feel fragile sometimes; my fingers trail the railing, and paint flakes beneath my nails.  The shavings curl and float off, iodine orange stained flesh, and a starched tree leans over the roof. It's already paper, white and thin as it coughs against the scales on the roof; the roof itself heaves a heavy sigh, stretching and illustrating the tapering skin of cement.   Is it true, that people don't understand me, or is it just that I'm not telling them?  My mouth moves silently, air tasting the crevice between my lips, but not catching my words. Tears are burning beneath my eyelids, and they keep fluttering as if they could drive them back with a scarcewisp of wind.&nbsp;  Wood creaks beneath my bare feet, moist with many open mouths; they gasp and grasp for the rain that hits them, absorbing it and still drowning in air.  Their faces are cracked and dry, like desert ground.   I repeat myself, and I still don't know what I'm saying; it's what happens after the rain.   As the seasons change, and my soul takes flight, I believe that only the rain will cry my name;   maybe you could remember   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how I used to be.

      Hello all, made it safe to Phoenix, Arizona.&nbsp; At the grandma's now. Which means a lot of things: I will have more time online. More time to post. More time to IM. Actual time to make calls from my cell (after 9 PM). Time to rest. Sleep. Recooperate.  Calls start tomorrow night. For now, I'm too tired, without the ample energy needed to get into my usual conversations. Looking forward to hearing&nbsp;familiar voices, and new voices.&nbsp; You know who you are. ;) -Kaleigh Jo-   P.s. - Ben: Just email me, kid. Stop snooping on my site! lol.    &nbsp; Love you all dearly.

I feel naughty. ;)&nbsp; Definitely will post tonight... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick:&nbsp;I'm so proud of you! I know you hate hearing that.&nbsp; But I am excited.&nbsp; I'll be waiting for you at the LSU track. haha.&nbsp; And here's my site, in all its glory! lol.&nbsp; Have fun, I suppose.&nbsp; And I will call you when&nbsp;I get to AZ too.&nbsp; Promise.&nbsp; (Just like I have to everyone else. So much love to give, and so little time! heh.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ben:&nbsp;I tried getting a hold of you...Your poem..well it left me speechless.&nbsp; Thank you so much...really, more than words could ever express.&nbsp; Please write me back.&nbsp; I love and miss you. &nbsp; I miss all you and any of those I know that may stumble across my site.&nbsp; Call me if you desperately need to, long distance charges need not apply in such situations.&nbsp; I'll keep you updated... -Kaleigh Jo-

      (It's been raining all week.  I thought a little prose to fit the occasion would be rather appropriate. It's strange...so enjoy!)  [ rain drinker. ]  	 I'd been hearing rain for hours by then and it had became background music to my own breathing; there were no cymbals or drums in my private symphony, just the sweet imbalance of instruments unnamed. Cocooned but surely not expecting anything beautiful or winged to emerge from the sheets, I'd awaken to the ceiling, gray and whirling but no, that was just paint or the fan, which I had just noticed for the fiftieth time. 	Slowly, I'd risen to a sitting position, sheets still pulled to my chin though sliding from my shoulders in a reminder of why one shouldn't sleep nude or nearly so; the chill of getting up unclothed is enough to set them to pajamas and socks (them excluding me).         He sat outside my window---in the rain. And because of this I knew he must've been insane. My first reaction had been one that any person, let alone female, would think to see a man sitting outside their window in the rain (only he wasn't sitting out my window and staring at me, he was sideways, sort of, and staring into the sky). He looked wistful, intelligent, and barely tangible in a world of permanently opened Starbucks and chewed up Bic pens (yet there he was).         I don't know why I wasn't worried, for all I knew he could have been a very dangerous man. But while I sat there and stared at him (as he stared at the sky), I couldn't believe he would hurt me; with his black hair slicked over his forehead and wire framed glasses silver moons above his nose, why would he do anything but be?        His hand came up and he drank from a water bottle, and for some reason the action made me smile; this man in the rain outside my window, drinking from a blue water bottle, made me smile. I slipped one bare foot to the floor, skin soft and warm against cold, hard floor but it was perfect somehow, that contrast.           I was already whispering my words as I walked to the window, who are you? I reached the sill and lifted the glass easily, not leaning out but waiting for him to notice me. He did but barely turned his head and eyes in acknowledgement. I said what I had to and he shrugged.         I am White shadow, Silver night and, Red sky; I am. I don't know how long I stared at him after that, but I know he drank three times, and his throat moved four times with exception of the third time, in which he swallowed thrice, with one long, last draw.        You are a lot. I think I was mocking him, and I know he didn't mind. I knew him, he knew me and we'd actually been talking for months; we always said the exact same things as if each meeting was the first.   The second time he came, I had to have his name because during first incident we'd sat in silence on a clear morning. He gave them and a smile.         This time, in the rain, he'd stood and leaned into the window, dripping along the sill and floor as his lips pressed to mine. And I'd thought to myself that maybe the sky had cried for him. I had dispelled that thought as his hand had touched my cheek, wet and warm; the heavens had been broken and an angel couldn't fix it because he had fallen and sat in the rain outside my window. I supposed God could get mad later, and I could content for that one moment.

      argh. school is officially back in session, and I am officially tired, already. Not to mention my procrastination came knocking at the door just in time! I have a huge project to do allll tonight. should have started a week ago.   ...screw it. On a good note, I booked a photo shoot! September 16th. It's a hair show, and then a shoot for the salons, surprise surprise, but it's work, and it pays damn good. Better than anything I've had before.  Hope the jobs keep calling me like they have lately, so I won't have to waste MY precious time callin' THEM! heh. (I'm acting arrogant right now. AKA I'm kidding.) The party went well, orientation went well. I hope everyone else is well. and if not, call me cause I'll force ya to spill out yer guts. ;) it's all for you, my loved ones.

           Listen up, my little ones, do not fret when Kaleigh is out of reach.  I would suggest calling me on my cell if you really need to talk, but only for quick emergencies, and I mean QUICK. And this is why:      I will not be online any more today/tonight, or even all tomorrow and tomorrow tonight. My schedule is beyond crazy: I have to play host tonight, and even host tomorrow morning before orientation.  After orientation, I have summer reading to finish, a test to study for, and a project to prep.  After all this, I have errands to run, clothes to pick up, and AGH phone calls to make to the agency and my photographers.  (Possible shoot this weekend. Cross your fingers for me!)      These are the days when I love the label "Insomniac".          P.S.- Hello to all my newcomers! (I gave out my site to a few more friends.) Hope y'all enjoy!
