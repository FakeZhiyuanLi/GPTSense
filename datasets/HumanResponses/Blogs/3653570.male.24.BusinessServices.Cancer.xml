      Was asking someone a question recently and it goes something like this:  "Given 2 rooms, one is freakin cold and the other is freakin hot, which room would you rather sleep in?"  Well tat someone came out with an answer which blew my mind away! The answer given by this someone was, "I can't sleep in heat."  I just couldn't stop laughing, and it was said with such innocence! So cute I tell you! It's not a trick question or anything. Just wanted to find out the tolerance level of tat person. Choice of words yar!!  Well anyway , my answer would be the freakin hot room! I can't tolerate freezin rooms. How could anyone sleep and shiver at the same time! And for those who chose the freakin cold room, you can't bring in your blanket!!

      Kaoz, just woke up like a while ago. I actually slept in the night, can't believe it. Had reached home like about 7-something yesterday, took a bath and then went to bed just before 8pm. Wanted to take a short nap but little did I know tat it came to be a super long long long nap. Slept for 12 hrs man, its been like ages since I had this kind of sleep! Was really freakin shagged man.  Wat provoked this sort of deep sleep was the fact tat I was working till 10pm on monday, stayed up the whole night doing my blog and chatting on the phone, and then going off to work for another 9 hrs. The best part for such a long sleep is to wake up and have a smoke immediately! I was floating when I took the second puff, felt kinda good! He he...   During the sleep, I missed out on a number of things too. Firstly, my Dinner, I'm soooo hungry now, anyone up for breakfast with me! Then just found out from mummy tat there was an island wide black-out! I thought it was just a dream when I saw Scott waking me up, with a candle in his hand, telling me to go have my dinner. It seem like I was back to the old kampong days man. Found out this morning tat I had a few missed calls and sms's too. No point replying to the sms's now, its like long overdue already.  Thus here's a sincere apology going out to the following ppl for not responding: Scott, Eileen, Gene, Sue and Trevor. But please be happy for me tat I had such a well deserved sleep, was wishing for one like this since the "Tang Dynasty" came into power in China!

      Really wanted to blog yesterday night but was just to lazy and tired. Sunday was a lazy, fun, and tiring day for me. Work up early just to go to church. Met Trevor and his cousin, Nicole I think, outside church. Didn't go in but rather stood outside church, was kinda practicing being an 'out-standing' catholic. Found out from Trevor tat someone had a thing for his cousin before but I'm not gonna spell his name out for fear of being hit by a hockey stick again. The 3 of us ate breakfast ate Hups and then went our separate ways.  Not long after, the gang(not all of us though) met up in Gardens for coffee. And as usual we had our talk-cock session, believe Sue got lost at times. Hee hee... Dinner was good, lots of food, not very costly, just about $7 a person. Headed down to Bishan after dinner to catch the Best Bet. Not a bad show but also not worth $8.50, maybe 'Free' would have been a better price. I thought tat Mark Lee was excellent in the show.  Got home like about close to 1am? Not so sure, all I know was tat I was pretty tired. But I still stuck to my daily routine of logging on and reading wat me pals had to say in their BlogBlogs. Didn't fall asleep straight away, was on the phone. But like 15 minutes into the conversation, I just couldn't take it. Zzzzzz.....  Didn't go to gym this morning, overslept and once again, late for work. I really envy my boss, so much patience. Hee hee... Work was the same. Met me insurance agent after work. Kinda thinkin of investing my CPF into some Equity Fund, high risk, high returns. She also gave me a birthday gift, a Zippo. The lighter's nice, matt black, simple design, just how I like things to be, SIMPLE.  Anyway got home kinda late, about 2345hrs. Took me bath and here I am. Gonna stop for now, had kept someone waiting for too long liaoz... Right....  =)

      Hmmm.... Yesterday was a good day for me ai...! Lets see if I can remember everything tat happened. Met up with Franklin(Dom's bro), William(Frank's bro) and Alex(William's bro) at Franklin's house. It was good catching up with those guys, humorous guys I tell you!! Haven't seen them for quite a while and its also cos Frank & I share the same birthday! How often to you get to meet someone whose birthday falls on the same day as you man. Oh, Frank & William, they're Magicians! Not just being able to come up with superb combos in mahjong, but its really cos of their excellent card tricks so ladies dun be fooled by them yar! Anyway they were kind enough to teach me a few tricks too, didn't manage to trick any ladies so far maybe except for Lynn. Ya ya... hee hee... Thanks guys, believe the card tricks will come to good use soon, I hope. Its also about time I got to learn something new yar so Frank & William, please take note!!  Later on in the evening, met up with Sue at Gardens for dinner. Tried to get the gang down as well but only Trevor, Scott & Eileen turn up. As usual they took their own sweet time, thus me & Sue carried on with dinner without waiting for them. Liked the perfume Sue was using, think it was 'Deep Red" or something, maybe should intro to Eileen then maybe her FBBB will treat her better yar!! It then started to drizzle so we headed down to our fav hangout, HupSeng. Bloody Trevor was on form I tell you, kept making fun of FBBB and his all-important mirror!! Laughed my balls off I tell you!! But dun worry guys, picked them up before I went home... Raymond, Paul & Melissa joined us later. It just added on to the hilarious shit tat we were taking from Trevor. I salute you Trevor, you were damn happening last night!! Been too long since you came out with this sort of shit man!! Sue, Paul & Melissa left us early only to be replaced by Mr & Mrs Gene Ng. You know, HupSeng is kinda like an interchange terminal sort of thing, if a fren leaves, someone else will come along to replace him/her. Its like everybody has got to take his/her attendance every now and then! He he...  Got pretty tired later on, Gene & Joy came back to me place. I really shouldn't have allowed tat to happen. I was  violated  by them!! They took semi-nude photographs of me. I felt like an innocent child being photographed for all the wrong reasons. I feel like killing myself now. I don't wanna live anymore. Somebody kill me please, kill me, I want to die, put a bullet in my head.... Just Kidding!!

      Here's a big big big THANK YOU going out to my family for helping me with the birthday dinner. A big big big THANK YOU also going out to my pals who had graced me with their presence and presents as well. And also a special THANK YOU for my mummy, my elder sis(Val), my godmother(Jean)and my adopted sis(Eileen) who had all helped me or rather did everything for me yesterday. THANK YOU!!  Dinner was great not only cause the food(cooked by my mum & godma) was good but also coz I had my pals around me. After dinner, we headed for liquid room, not all of us went thought, just 5 great looking guys and 5 beautiful ladies. Reached liquid a bit too early, had to wait for about half an hour before we could get in. Liquid was way below standard yesterday, music wasn't fantastic, I seriously still prefer wed nights. Not only is it ladies night but mainly coz the music is more melodic. Anyway I could tell tat Joy, Sue and Joyce did enjoy themselves to  'some'  extend. There they were, just the 3 of them on the platform(a round stage about 3/4 meters high set at the middle of the dance floor), dancing vigorously and at times seductively to the hard pumping tunes. We could all just stare in amazement and amusement. And in case you're wondering, they were not drunk! We left liquid rather early, about 1.30am I think, like I said, the music was lousy. Headed down to S-11 for supper, dancing just makes you hungry. After supper we exchanged "goodnights" and then headed home.  Here's a list of some of the gifts from me pals: Eileen & Trevor - A Nissan 350Z Fairlady & a bottle of 1998 red wine. Gene & Joy - A bottle of Champaign, a bottle of 1998 red wine, a nike sling bag & a card. Aunty Lynn - Red packet. HuiLam - A bottle of 'ABSOLUTE CITRON'. Ivan - A bottle of 1998 red wine. Sue & Joyce - A tee tat screams "I like gals" & another tat says "TheBestShagEver". Portia - A silver cigarette casing. And I also found chewing gum, who gave me those? Anyway, thanx a million guys, really appreciate the gifts but its really the close friendship tat I treasure. Really la!!

      Ha ha ha ha ha... I'm now a year older, not any wiser though. Still as short, still as dumb, wats the point of getting older than. Anyway, think i better write up a schedule for the day's events.  0900hrs: Gotta be at work, hopefully i'll be early. 1300hrs: Leaving office, half day la. 1430hrs: Meet up with Eileen & trev for gym. 1600hrs: Head for home to prepare stuff. 1800hrs: Get an hour's worth of beauty sleep. 2000hrs: Dinner time. 2200hrs: Alcohol fever.  The thing is, I'm caught between 3 places where i could go to after the dinner thingy. I'm not very sure so i'm open to any votes on the 3 clubs tat i have in mind. And they are: (a) Liguid Room (b) lIqUiD rOoM (c) LIQUID ROOM  Let me know which place would be better so we wouldn't take to long to decide tomolo yar!!

      Hiya, just got played out by Mr and Mrs Gene Ng. Told me they were gonna join me for gym this morning, but just as I've predicted, they didn't turn up. Looks like I'll never find a gym partner! Wish you were here Tavis!!  And now down to some serious business. During the year 1979, the world was having its complicated problems. Conflicts emerged between nations, civil wars, depression and social unrest were common in many parts of the world. The people in Singapore were very much concerned about this and felt tat hardship in Singapore was inevitable. A couple decided to change things, they wanted to do their part for society and help in tat difficult point of time. Thus it was then, on the 25th of June 1980, they brought a child into this world. A child so innocent and pure, intelligent and brilliant. They hoped tat this child would bring joy and stability to the world. They hoped and prayed... But they were so wrong, this child brought calamity and sin! This child was a complete mistake! The couple wanted to commit suicide but God stopped them. God said he needed tat child to emphasize to the rest of the world tat, "not everything turns out as planned". That child is 'LIM BEH'! So always remember tat if you've tried your best and it doesn't go according to plan, its really okay. My parents had me man, how bad can yours be!

      Just woke up from a super deep sleep, man I really needed it. Was celebrating my parents 30th annivesary yesterday. Mum and Dad had rented a suite at Raffles the Plaza. Daddy had asked me to bring Eileen along, now you know why I say she's my adopted sis, parents kinda like her a lot. Met Eileen after work, we were at city hall around 1830hrs. So there we were, standing next to the entrance of Robinson's waiting for my parent's to bring us up into the penthouse suite. They were coming back from a movie(so cute right, parents still go out on dates every once in a while). Waiting for my parents wasn't tat bad as we started our usual hobby of watching people.  My parents met us around 1845hrs, brought us up to the suite. Mummy was telling me tat the suite which they were in, cost like 10k a day but they had special rates. Didn't really believe her until I entered the suite. It was BIG, 2 suites combined into 1. The bathroom(includes a built in sauna) is bigger than my room for gods sake! Anyway me & Eileen had quite a bit of fun taking pics around the suite. We even took a pic of the chef tat was bbq-ing our food for us! Managed to catch a bird's eye view of the Linkin Park concert being held at the Padang. You should have heard the screams from my little cousins, Cassandra & Belinda, when I told them they could see the concert from any of the 4 balconies in the suite. Before I knew it, they were occupying a balcony, calling their frens at the same time and bragging on how they could see  the backstage  of the gig. Fell asleep while I was there too, the sofa was just too comfortable and its also coz I was really tired. Got home before 2300hrs, took a quick bath then went back to sleep.

      Came back from the gym about an hour ago, had just finished eating me fav instant noodles(Indomee - mee goreng). Dun trust other imitations, this mee goreng rocks man. Gym was good today coz it was kinda empty. Good for me, dun like to be intimidated by the big muscular guys. Wat i hate about them is tat they'll always flex their muscles while checking themselves out in front of the god damn mirror! Bloody irritating man! It will only demoralized me and i'll end up wanting to leave early... The journey home was the same as any other day. Seated beside me was this lady who i think had spent the whole morning dressing up. She was the glamorous type, the type tat just turns me off. I hate  glamour gals . Just find them so fake.   GLAMOUR GALS:  Gals who think they're super-models; vain pots; wannabes; materialistic; flirtatious; heavy make-up; snobbish; etc...  The type of gal tat i'm attracted to is the "gal-next-door" look. To me, they just stand out of the crowd. Its like a big 'X-factor' to me. They dress simply, look great, cheerful, sweet smile, out-going personality. Many times when i see such a gal, i point them out to my guy-pals but they would say "she's not pretty" or "huh! Where got cute!". But only my gal-pals agree with me, especially my sis eileen(maybe just entertaining me). Hiyah, i just like those cute cute gals. I would rather have a relationship full of laughter than a relationship tats gonna burn holes in my pocket! Come to think of it, i really wonder how much these  glamour gals  spent on their  beauty suppliments  every month!!

      Hey hey... Just got home from a 8 hour mahjong session, kinda all drained out and stuff. Went over to Joy's place around 10 plus last night and came back home around 8am. Had almost forgotten tat i'm suppose to have lunch with my parents later. Its a father's day lunch thingy. So guess i can't sleep now for if i do, i'll wake up just in time for supper!  Since i have to be awake, let me tell you about my past relationship. I was in a relationship for abt 6yrs with this gal tat i met during my poly education. In fact, she was my first love and also my first real relationship(not some puppy love thingy). Our relationship had its sweet moments and really ugly times too. I mean tats just part and parcel of any relationship. The relationship started to turn sour during the last 2 yrs of it. I'm not gonna go into details for it really doesn't matter now. Many a times i kept wondering why it couldn't work out. I mean she was a good gf and all but things just didn't end up the way we wanted it to be. Its almost coming to a year since we broke up. As of now, she's happily attached to another guy. Saw his picture on friendster. My brother sd he looked a bit like me but i dun think so, he looks weird. Dun get me wrong, its not tat i'm jealous or anything, its just a comment, eileen says the same. Hee hee... I've already let go of her along time back and there aren't any feelings anymore. But i won't lie, there are times when certain incidents do remind me of her. Everything happens for a reason, this has been my motto since we broke up. We all have to learn from our past experiences in order to better ourselves. I kinda look at relationships differently now, kinda understand it more. My past has taught me a lot and i'm gratefull. At least i'm confident tat my next relationship will most likely be my partner for life. Then again it all depends on fate, if its not meant to be, then so be it ya. Cheers.

      Just finished my dinner. Mum made mashed potatoe, scrambled eggs, sausages, clam chowder soup and stuff. An excellent way to start me blog, full tummy and very awake!  Well, woke up late once again. Mum bought me a new alarm clock( broke the rest - threw them on the floor ) but its not annoying enough. Thus i usually sleep through it. Then again its all thanx to my sleeping disorder, only can fall asleep at 6 in the morning. Wanted to take a cab to work but thought tat since i'm gonna be late, might as well use the NEL, much cheaper and the scenery is much better.  Was kinda surprise to reach work earlier than i had expected. Was there before 9.30am but to my boss, tats being late for work, guess he should be pretty used to it by now. I'm suppose to start work at 9am. Thank god for EURO2004, boss came in at 11.45am.  Work was fine until after lunch. Can't really disclose my line of work, so lets just call it credit management yar. So wat happened was tat a lady called me up, and this was straight after i had seated myself at my desk. This 'Miss Chan' was calling on behalf of a person who had an a/c with the company. Turns out to be tat she was his gf, so i told her tat i would only converse with the a/c holder as its highly confidential. Tat damn  bitch  then retorted tat it shouldn't be a problem as she was his gf. She then became rude and bloody arrogant, really pissed me off! So i told her to  'fuck off'  and slammed the phone on her! Okay, i didn't do tat but how i wish i had. So i just explained to her tat it was the policy of the company and then said "Thank you for calling, goodbye." and hung up the phone. Why are some Singaporeans so disgustingly feeble-minded? Bloody moronic these assholes are, spoiling the image of the common ppl. I believe tat these ppl may most likely be the result of poor family up-bringing. I can't say tat its all becoz of their parents' mis-guidance, it could also be due to society as a whole. Most of us just want everything to go our way, not sparing a thought for the others around us, just being very self-centered( this implies very much to those ppl in-love with themselves ). Life's already a bitch, stop acting like one!  After work, went down to Thiong Bahru to meet my sister, was gonna hitch a ride back home from her. On the way home, we started passing remarks on some ppl we both knew. We then came to the subject about virginity, gf's and condoms. It felt kinda weird talkin abt this to my elder sis but it was just too amusing to really bother. Got home, took a shower and went to sleep. Got up to eat dinner and then started on this.  Gonna download more music now, support free music yar!!  =]

      Time i wrote about the ppl who have all made an impact in my life...   My Family    VERNON :  The coolest dad on earth. Lets me do almost everything i wanna do. Even allowed me to get my tattoo. He still goes pubbing every friday night. My daddy is 53 this year but he looks like my older brother(some ppl have actually thought so). Eileen thinks tat he's charming, i believe so too! If you see him, you might ask, "If tats your dad, wat happened to you."  JOYCE :  The most amazing mum. Always the first to notice if i'm down. Can tell her almost everything though i don't always do, some things a guy just wouldn't wanna discuss with his mum. Its coz of her tat i've inherited the eurasian characteristics. She always tells me to come home early and i do, usually early in the morning.  VALERIE :  My elder sis, 29 this year. Has 2 adorable boys already, one of them is my godson. I'm a GODFATHER!! She's the best sis, always thinkin about my bro & me even though she's got kids of her own to look after.  SCOTT :  He's my younger bro, had always been jealous of him. Has a eurasian look with chinese eyes. A handsome bitch he is, and he's also a police officer. Wow! Ppl know him as scott, and they know me as scott's bro, like i don't have a freakin name or something!   My Pals    EILEEN :  The adopted daughter in my family, my sis. Nobody can replace her. She's the best bitch anyone could have for a sister! She knows everything abt me and vice versa. Knew each other for abt 7yrs already. Ppl tend to mistake her as my gf cause we're damn close. Hiyah, narrow minded ppl! We're always looking out for each other, helping each other find the perfect partner. She sort of found hers already, so now its my turn yar!  TAVIS :  My soul brother man. Always has good advice but sadly enough, i don't always listen. When we're in NS, we directed a Britney Spears music video(Singapore Style), it was great fun, we even won first prize man! Cheers! He's now studyin in AussieLand, miss him alot.  GENE :  There's a lot to say about this bitch, but 1st things 1st, he's my brother! This guy is bloody good looking! Always makes the opposite sex take a second look at him. So if there's ever an accident involving a lady driver, Gene was there. In fact, the lady driver could also be Joy watching him spin.(Private Joke)  JOY :  Gene's gf, sorry ladies. Just got to know her for about 4 mths and she makes a superb pal. Very easy to get along with but also very head strong in some ways! Gene used to say tat Joy and me were kinda alike, maybe in character, not so sure. Anyway i'll always remember our toilet thingy yar!!  TREVOR :  Another mixed eurasian. Another bloody solid pal. He always willing to lend a helping hand. My inspiration to get my driver's licence, and tats coz he keeps disturbing me abt it. Also my number-ball kaki. He's 23 this year and he likes cats.  KEVIN :  He's a very close pal of mine. Used to hang out with each other a lot. In fact we went through shit together. Knew him since i was in sec 1. We actually went through secondary school as classmates, from sec 1 to sec 4. He's 24 this year.  HUI-LAM :  Superb pal, just got to know him for abt 5 mths. Its great fun to club and chill-out with him. We enjoy looking out for pretty gals but don't get us wrong, its just to admire and pass comment on the beautiful ppl in Singapore. Its like how gals would tend to ogle at Gene and comment on how good-looking he is. We just enjoy praising ppl and making fun of ppl who can't dance for nutz.  HUPSENG :  This is by so far, the coolest coffeeshop in Singapore!! Our hangout place, had many intelligent conversations & debates at this coffeeshop. But there is this fat drink uncle who is such a bitch. He's only nice whenever Eileen is there. Other than tat, he just gives us shitty attitude when we order our drinks.  Well, tats not all of my pals, but can't think tat much now, brain getting tired. Till next time yar. Cheers!

      Finally sort of completed the settings to my account. Got a little help from me little sis yar! The internet explorer has been givin me some probs, not allowing me to view and edit stuff as they should be. Well, was on MC today, felt rather shitty when i woke up. Maybe it was also due to the fact tat i woke up late again! Been having too many sleepless nites recently, and 'NO' its not because of EURO2004. I'm not very sure myself. Someone told me tat it could be mental stress. Maybe... but hey, i think its just my stoopid body-clock. Can't tell day from nite yar.

      Okay, wat you will expect to find here would mainly consist of my bitchin' about life in general. Then again I would post some theories on life by Dr. Fay, who is also known as ah-bee. You will all experience the different theories which I have to share, most of it being based on past experiences. You may not agree with my thinkin but I don't give a damn cause its wat I feel. So when you read my blog, step into my shoes, the world of Ngology and Bee Theories. Cheers.

        First of all, I want to&nbsp;apologize to my brother, Scott.      I shouted at him today and there really was no reason to. I had vented all my frustration on him and that is not acceptable. Once again Scott, I'm truly sorry for shouting at you.      As your elder brother, I'm very ashamed for what I've done!      &nbsp;   Had dinner with my darling's family today, food was good. Her parent's had even taken the trouble to buy cockles for me as they knew it was a favourite of mine. This is the 2nd time that I'm meeting them but its a little more than just saying  hello . In fact, my darling and I were actually  looking foward  to this meeting. Its more of an interview rather! Not really sure if I had passed the interview though but it seems that it's so far so good. Well at least now, my darling's parents know me slightly better, I hope...     &nbsp;   After dinner, we went back to my place. Was suppose to leave with Scott, Eileen and Trevor for hupseng but I wanted to rest at home for a while. So when Scott asked me if I was ready to leave, I told him to go ahead first. He looked disappointed and turned away. At that moment, my emotions just got the better of me. I thought that he gave me an  attitude-look  while he was turning away. So I&nbsp;screamed at him, "Whats your problem!" But Scott just continued to walk away. Then Eileen came in and asked me if I was okay and instead of calming down, my volcano erupted and I started shouting again. I was furious, super angry and I didn't even care when my dad came in to see what the hell was going on with all that shouting. I just stood up and walked pass him, went straight to my brother and confronted him again. My brother remained calm and just ignored me. He told Eileen that he'll meet&nbsp;her and&nbsp;Trevor&nbsp;at hups, then he left. Eventually, we did make our way to hupseng. A while later, Scott came and I apologized. He told me that it was okay but I still feel very very bad for what I've done. I had shouted at my own brother without any reason at all. Even though he has already forgiven me, I still feel that I've been such a bastard! I really don't like myself now, I feel so god-damn disgusted with myself!     &nbsp;   I'm really not sure why&nbsp;I lost my temper&nbsp;so suddenly, it was without any warning at all. I was perfectly fine the whole day, even to the point when I had reached home. Its true that there are some things on my mind that have been bugging me. Maybe I'm just too mentally stressed out now with my problems. But I really didn't want anyone to be the victim of my temper, especially those that I love.   This is the ugly side of Brandon Mark Ng.     &nbsp;   Lastly, I wanna apologize to my darling for&nbsp;frightening the shit out of her. Would also want to apologize to my sis and Trevor for spoiling their night. I'm very sorry guys!

        Attention all....!!     I'm on a very important mission today.     &nbsp;   I'm to wake my darling up at 7.15am but as you all have witnessed and even experienced, I can't really wake up early!    So how would it be possible for me to do so?    The answer is simple, Mr Brandon Mark Ng will not sleep.     I will endure the cold&nbsp;bitter night, torturing my frail body, keeping&nbsp;my mind&nbsp;awake&nbsp;with&nbsp;boring PC games, refraining from&nbsp;cuddling my pillow, restraining from lying on my comfortable bed, withholding the urge to rest for just 5 minutes (as it'll usually end up as 5 hours of sleep).     &nbsp;   I believe that some of you might be thinking that I'm such a " Drama MaMa " but please bear in mind folks, sleeping is my hobby, its my favourite past-time, its my passion, its the only&nbsp;reason&nbsp;for me to&nbsp;carry on living in this world of sin! As you can already tell, my mind is going insane already! Arrgh....!!!!     &nbsp;   But on the brighter note, I would like to announce that my hair has finally grown back to a reasonable length. Now its long enough for me to style it the way I want it to be.    Yeah baby yeah!     &nbsp;   *NOTE: I know that there is no such word&nbsp;as "Un-possible".    Looks like you can't make fun of my speilling! Ha ha, so sad, too bad!

       Guess what, I'm in a rather confused mood now. I'm both happy and at the same time sad.     &nbsp;    Happy because:   As of now, I can spend more time with my darling!        Sad because:   I got terminated from my job!       &nbsp;   Farked up mood right now. So once again I gotta go on a job hunt. But as I've always believed, "...everything happens for a reason...".   As of now,&nbsp;the only reason I can think of is that there is a better paying job for me out there. Wasn't earning that much but really enjoyed working with the people there! In fact, during my first&nbsp;month of employment, I had the choice to go for a better paying job. But I chose to stick to that job as I had enjoyed the company. Some of you might say that I'm bloody stoopid, maybe I am. But I feel that I'm&nbsp;more of a 'people' person rather than a 'money-loving' person. I'm not saying I don't love money, its just that I choose environment over money.&nbsp;I think that this&nbsp;might be due to my cancerian&nbsp;characteristics. Hiyah, maybe this time I should look for a job that really pays well.     &nbsp;   In case you're wondering, I got sacked because of my persistent lateness. Came to work late again and my boss felt that it was the final straw. Spoke to me 10 mins before I knocked off, informed me that my services to the company have been terminated. Kaoz, I'm like, so gonna miss my colleagues and stuff! Really enjoyed working with them. If its any consolation, I believe that my colleagues are gonna miss me too!&nbsp; =(

       Was having a late night talk with my darling. Had to end the conversation for a while as my Bluetooth headset needed charging. So gonna use this opportunity to bitch about something which I had been bitchin' for the last 2 weeks!     &nbsp;   Okay, its been like 2 weeks since I had this farked up haircut. You see, whenever I'm happy, I would just feel like getting my hair trimmed or trying out&nbsp;some new style. So on that fateful day, I decided to get my hair trimmed. Went to this hair salon, somewhere along Telok Ayer Street. Told the lady to trim the ends a bit while keeping the length. But that bloody bitch had brillant ideas of her own, she decided to cut my hair real short. On top of that, she also had it thinned too much! So the problem that I've been facing is, hair too short and too thin,&nbsp;super hard to style or rather can't style at all! Thus, no matter how much time I actually spend in front of the mirror, I just can't seem to get it to look right! I'm never going back to that bloody salon! And to add to that terrible, shocking, dreadful, terrifying experience, the haircut set me back 40 freakin' bucks! Imagine this, a bad haircut, a farked up hair stylist, and I still had to pay $40 for it, what the fark!     &nbsp;   So now, I've to like wash my hair 4 times a day just to entice it to grow faster. I reckon it'll be like 2 months before my bloody&nbsp;hair will reach&nbsp;the desired length. Hiya, now I've just gotta live with being a super ugly bitch for the next 2 months. My darling is kind enough to tell me that I still look the same. Or maybe she's just stating the fact that I've always looked weird! Watever!     &nbsp;   Would just like to say a big "THANK YOU" to that stoopid hair stylist, you've just made me realize that I should never, never again,&nbsp;cut or trim my hair at your farking salon! Bitch, slut, whore!

       Today was a day of ups and downs. Nothing&nbsp;to laugh about, here's the story...  &nbsp;  Well, was suppose to be at work at 10am toady. My darling woke me up at 7 something, told myself another 5 mins of rest and went back to sleep. Ha, this 5 minute thing never seems to work. Eventually, I woke up at 11.30am. My heart was farking racing, was in a panic state I tell you! Next thing I did was to call my boss. Told him I overslept. His reply was :"That is not a good excuse Brandon! Will let you know about your termination later!" Man, when those words hit me, I just felt like killing myself. Then I went back to sleep.  &nbsp;    My darling called me again at about 2 plus. Told&nbsp;my&nbsp;darling&nbsp;about it. She came over a while later.&nbsp;Her presence&nbsp;really cheered me up a bit. There's this thing about her that would just automatically brighten up my day. Even when I'm so down and stuff, seeing her never fails to make me smile! So anyway, my boss calls me around 4 plus. Tells me to come back to work on Monday. Hee hee, it was then when I felt at peace again. If this sort of thing keeps happening, I'm gonna have a heart failure soon!  &nbsp;  Eileen and Trevor came over for a movie marathon around 5pm. Well, we only managed 2 DVDs, "13 Going on 30" &amp; "Haunted Mansion". We decided to catch&nbsp;"King Arthur"&nbsp;at Junction 8. It was a good show, a well spent $8.50 I believe. Makes me wanna be a knight too. Hee hee...  &nbsp;  After the movie, headed down to Hups for supper. Met up with Roy and the odd couple. Had a few good laughs. Gene was having so much fun disturbing me. Really wonder why does he always do this? Not angry or anything, kinda used to it already. But he does make the group more 'cool' with his presence though! Ha ha...  &nbsp;    Anyway gotta run now, got some issues to settle. Once again, I feel weird. Must be my mood swings again. Been having it the whole day, damn shitty! Sianz....

        You are a King!  Strong, Wise, Noble, Compassionate. A Born Leader!   You are the epitomy of what every man should be. What sets you apart from the other men of rank and nobility is you combine every best quality they possess into one. You are skilled, motivated, ambitious, filled with a sense of purpose and morality. You know when to relax and have fun and when to be serious and courageous. You seek peace, prosperity and love in your life, and as a ruler, you seek it for your kingdom. Others follow you because of your ability to move them, and because you earned their respect. You are admired, even envied, but above all else, greatly loved.

      Oh man, my bloody gums hurt. And when I said bloody gums, I meant that they're still farking bleeding okay. Sunday night was a torture, tooth at the right back hurt like hell. Took like 4 panadol extras just to kill he pain, didn't really help though, still ached the whole night.   Went to the dentist the next day, Mr Dentist said my tooth had to be pulled out, was decaying already, bloody disgusting. But I was freakin happy cos I didn't want that farking irritating tooth, it had caused so much disturbance the night before, didn't get much sleep too. Mr Dentist gave me 2 days MC for the extraction, also made my mum poorer by $60 as she funded the dentist trip. Gotta return for another appointment on the 21st, gonna remove the stitches. The next problem I'll be facing would be the darn wisdom tooth on my left, heard that its gonna be pretty expensive just to remove it... Sianz!   Here's the culprit, being compared to a ciggie:

      Well, its been like damn long ago since I blogged. The reason being, I was kinda tied up with my darling, my friends, my work, and sleep. Yes people, I'm finally getting enough sleep, a bit too much at times though but who's complaining.  Recently, my boss got bloody pissed off with me. You see, on Monday(5th July), I wanted to take a half day leave for Friday(9th July) but he didn't allow that. Then on Tuesday(6th July), I came to work an hour late and still requested to take an urgent leave for half a day. He did ask me why and I explained that it was a personal issue I had to solve, the real reason being that I wanted to accompany someone as she was feeling hurt or something like that. He told me to go ahead but(there's always a 'but') said that he wanted to talk to me the next day. The next day, my boss called me after lunch to follow him for a "chat", more like a convict awaiting his judgment really! It was then when he gave me 2 options; either not to come to work late anymore, or not to come to work at all. Well, I chose the first. Man, I'm like so under super pressure now! Can't be late anymore, just another time and I'm farked! But you know, everything happens for a reason, so if I'm really sacked then its meant to be. Kinda worried now, so will be browsing the classifieds pretty soon... Sianz!  As for today, I'm on my alternate Saturday off. Spent the entire afternoon with my darling. Met her at gardens this afternoon at 12 something, was suppose to be there by 11am actually. Hee hee... Had laksa for lunch but it wasn't that good. The owner of the stall still had the cheek to name his stall as the "katong laksa". Bloody liar, cheat, con-artist, misleading innocent people(like me & my darling) into believing his laksa was actually good. Yucks! Never gonna eat there again unless its the only stall in Singapore selling laksa! After lunch, we headed back to my place to watch Shrek 2. Not bad, quite funny. Later in the evening, my darling went to meet her close friend at City Hall. Had actually promise her that I would sent her there but(there it is again) was feeling under the weather, felt like a fever coming on. No excuses though, "Sorry Dear, will make it up to you k". Anyhoo, I've gotta rush down to Hougang interchange now, gonna meet up with Trevor, Eileen and Scott for dinner at Mac's. Yeah...

      Man, its been a while since I last blogged. But I can't really help it. You see, as of now, most of my time will be spent on my darling. But I will always make time for my close pals too, afterall, nobody can live without their pals, especially me!  Well, as each day passes, I just become more and more and more and more in love with my darling. And the moment I'm separated from her(whenever we part to go home), I just start to miss her so much. I miss her when I'm at work, miss her when I'm eating my lunch, miss her when I'm in the bus, miss her when...eh...I think you get my drift. In fact, you can easily tell that she's always in my thoughts, this blog is entirely about her! I mean look, I'm freakin tired now but my darling wanted to read my daily blogs, tats why I'm here, otherwise I would have already been Zzzz-ing on my bed. I'm sooo into her can!  Took a half day urgent-leave today, was to attend to some personal admin. In the end, I ended up spending the whole day with my darling. It felt so good just being around her. We went to orchard, had lunch at Mos burger, went to Borders, then headed back to my place for dinner. Oh, the zodiac/horoscope books confirmed that my darling & I are a great couple, we sort of compliment each other in more ways than one. We are compatible, we are meant to be together! Don't believe, go Borders!!  Anyhoo, me darling is waiting for me to finish my blog. I always take so long but she's always patient and waits for me. See, told you my darling is the best!!

      Let me tell you a bit about my Darling.  My darling is no other than Miss SueLynn Tan aka Mrs Fay, Mrs Ng & Fay's Darling. I love her for the way she looks at me, her adorable eyes, her luscious lips, her tender kisses. Love her for the way she teases me, her enchanting smile, her loving hugs. I love her for the way she loves me, the way she cares for me, the way she holds my hand. Most of all, I love her for who she is and the way tat she is!  She's like so gal-next-door, cheerful smile, never fails to make me smile even though I've had a farked up day at work. Don't think I'll ever be able to get angry with her cos all she has to do is to smile, and my heart just melts. She has placed me under some sort of spell can. In fact, she did admit to keeping a voodoo doll with its pins and everything! Hee hee... Hiya, and whenever she's not beside me, I just can't stop thinking about her! Eileen can be my living proof! Just a while ago, I was with Trevor, Joy & Eileen at hups. Eileen kept asking me to go over to Roy's place and I was busy sms-ing my dear at the same time, then I answered, "Dear, don't want to go la". Kaoz, was so bloody embarrassed! You see, I was just too involved with thoughts of my darling, to the extent tat I called Eileen, 'Dear'. Hee hee... Darling, see wat you've done to me!  Anyway, just wanna let those Martha-Farkers out there know tat SueLynn is taken, so FARK OFF! Oh, and a special 'Thank You' going out to Mr & Mrs Tan for bringing my Darling into this world. Cheers!

      Here I am, sitting in front of my PC, a glass of red wine on my right. Time for a celebration? Hell yeah!! Why? Read on....  Started the day by waking up late again, wats new right! Side track a bit, my boss got tired of me being late so on wednessday, he told me tat I would start work at 0930hrs instead of the usual 0900hrs. Well, I'm still late lor, left my house at 0915hrs and arrived for work, hee hee, LATE. Would have been very much later but thank God for Sue, she woke me up at 0830hrs. But I went back to sleep again and due to her persistence, I was in the bathroom by 0900hrs.   Work was the same except tat for today, there were more arrogant GDMFSOB's than usual. Tell you, almost lost my patience. Was really looking forward to the spiderman movie so didn't really bother about the assholes tat much.  Left my office at about 1830hrs, then headed down to meet My Darling at orchard mrt. Yes you heard me right, "My Darling" aka "Mrs Fay". In case its not clear enough, guys, there is now a Mrs Fay in the group. You all better be nice to her as I have been to you all. There she was, in a red top and jeans. My kind of gal-next-door yar! Anyhoo(learn this word from her), we then made our way down to bishan to meet up with Trevor to catch spiderman 2. The show was good but it was great because I was next to her! After the show, sent her home and then moved to hups. Didn't stay for too long though. Was kinda tired. Got home, took a shower and here I am.

       Was supposed to meet my darling yesterday night but was not able to. As most of you would have guessed, I was asleep. It was a different kind of sleep though, I was in a coma! I had a  'total body shut-down sleep'  thingy!       In case you're wondering what the fark is a  'total body shut-down   sleep' , its the state your body goes through after a super-duper-fuper-tuper work-out! You see, I went to the gym with Gene in the afternoon yesterday. Must admit that not going to the gym for a month really decreases your strength. So thats why my body was kinda like over-worked out yesterday! Even till now, my bloody body is aching, haven't felt this way for a damn long time man! Shiok but pain!      So anyway, wanted to give my darling a surprise today. Was gonna meet her for lunch. Wanted to wait outside her office, but....(there's always a BUT) I was kinda behind time. She called me while I was waiting for the bus! Hiya, there goes my lunch surprise for her! Will try harder next time yar!

       The name of  Brandon  has given you sensitivity and appreciation for the finer and deeper things in life. You can enjoy reading, study, and contemplation about many different subjects. When your interests or curiosity are aroused, you work intensely at new undertakings, but your interests often wane when you encounter drudgery and monotony, with the result that you leave many things unfinished. Your name has taken you into many bitter experiences. The greatest lack in your life is stability and peace of mind. A peaceful and quiet environment, especially out in nature, is one of your greatest desires, but you are constantly taken into chaotic conditions. Because you have high ideals and are a principled person, you have been disillusioned and disappointed in people on many occasions and have experienced much aloneness. You are fond of outdoor sports, where you can find an outlet for your nervous energy. Impulsiveness could bring frequent accidents and unfortunate happenings into your life. You do not like to be restricted or to have your freedom curtailed in any way. You find it difficult to control your thoughts and could swing in moods from one extreme to the other. Your speech can become very critical and sarcastic when you are frustrated or crossed. This name creates a weakness in the heart, lungs, and bronchial organs, and could cause heart trouble, pneumonia, asthma, or tuberculosis. It also creates tension in the nervous system, particularly the solar plexus and stomach, causing nervous indigestion and relative conditions.       urlLink  Name   Quiz

       Going to church in a while, waiting for dear to come over to pick me up. Guys should be treated like princesses at times too okay! Scott and Eileen will be going too and I think we're like gonna meet quite a number of friends in church today.       Gonna attend a BBQ with my darling's family later. I'm still rather nervous to meet them, not tat close to rub shoulders yet you see. Anyway, I'm almost everything that her parents wouldn't want her to be with. Her parents don't like smokers, tattoos, foul languages in dialect especially, mentally challenged and stuff like tat.       Well, if you know me well enough, you'll understand that I'm all the above! But then again, this will not stop me from loving my darling or being with her. I believe that all this is rather surface thingys tat can be over-looked, I hope! Afterall, deep inside is what really counts. And I have faith that it'll all turn out well. If it doesn't, then I guess that I would have to kidnap my darling and elope to a another island where her parents would never find us. Was kinda thinking about Sentosa, close to home la!      Darling just sms me that she's on the way, so I gotta go get ready to welcome her with open arms!

         urlLink      I'm completely down-to-earth!   urlLink  Find your soul type  at  urlLink kelly.moranweb.com .    You are the most in touch with knowledge. It's the tree of life from which you tap the sap. You know what you want and you know how to reasonably get it.   Virtues:  You respect people with plans. When someone has their head on their shoulders, you know that they can see straightforward and keep their eyes on the mark. When it comes to looking at the future, you take a logical approach: what's within your ability? A fortunate attribute that you have is the ability to set a goal for yourself, higher than maybe you feel possible, but still keep yourself within reasonable bounds. You take the time to appreciate those surrounding you and they do appreciate you in return. Decision-making comes naturally to you when you take the time to consider each option. People only come to talk to you when they are looking for a logical, reasonable solution.   Aspirations:  You have an idea of what you can do with your life, but you push it up a notch. You need a profession that you can enjoy, so work towards it. You want to live near your friends and family while being as far away as possible. You also want to settle down while working in excitement and variation.   Quirks:  You don't appreciate drama queens and they don't appreciate you. When they need help, they won't seek you out because of your ability to see through their overly dramatic predicaments. You have leeway for humor, and sometimes love to participate in it, but when it becomes irrational behavior, others can count you out. Loud noises are bothersome, except when they come from you or your friends.   Factors:  Reach for the sky! Don't decide to do something because you're merely good at it, but choose something you might like to do, despite whether you're sure you can master it or not. Don't only save room for a few empathetic friends, but open up to everyone.   Future:  When looking for a job, if you work in all of your talents (logic, decision-making, planning, and definitely humor), you'll find yourself happy. Come to a compromise for location; live nearby your friends and take periodic vacations or live farther away and take frequent return trips.

          Just came back from lunch with my darling. Went down to her workplace around 1245hrs. I think I've kinda surprised her for actually being early today. Well, we had lunch at a "nearby" coffeeshop. Tell you hor, the bloody coffeeshop was like damn far away lor! And the sun was being a bitch, so bloody hot, almost had 3rd degree burns man!      Gonna get some sleep now, really tired. Was hanging out with Trevor &amp; Peter at hups till 6am this morning and I've been awake since then. The three of us actually had a splendid time, we were having a conversation about the number of girlfriends we used to have, also talked about the gals that Scott, Wayne and Jon used to chase. Bloody funny! Come to think of it, we were like schoolgals gossiping about our friends' relationships. Hee hee...          Facts that I've gathered from this morning's talk:      1)  Wayne used to like a lot of gals but didn't have much progress from any.    2)  Scott is a policeman.    3)  Peter not really waiting for Miss X anymore, not very sure though.    4)  I am so cute.    5)  Trevor will be migrating to Perth.           THIS   I  S A CODED MESSAGE FOR MY DARLING.       L  IKE IT OR N  O  T, IT WILL ONLY BE RE  V  EALED TO H  E  R.

        My sis, Eileen, is in distress!     No prizes for guessing what its all about! And no, its not about that   Fat Balding Bastard (ex)Boyfriend   of hers. In fact if I may say, its about a potential future  boyfriend/bed-buddy/playmate/sexual-service-provider.       Now that I've got your attention, its time you advice her on this issue.       The issue at hand:    1. . S he would like to have HIM as her boyfriend, I think.   2. . C an't understand why HE doesn't get the hint and do something about it.   3. . O nly waiting for HIM to take a step further and maybe establish a status.   4. . T old HIM before about how she felt about HIM.   5. . T his bloody "issue at hand" is damn obvious lor!      Anyway I suggested that she make the first move but she's afraid. I can understand why she feels this way.   But there are things in life where you just can't keep waiting and hoping for something to happen. You've got to go all out and make it happen!       Its like putting a match-stick beside a piece of paper and hoping that the piece of paper would start to burn. Look, if you don't make the effort to get up and ignite the bloody match-stick, then good luck to you. Guess that you're just hoping that somehow or other, a magical donkey would come by and strike the match for you! God damn dreamers!    So sis, I hope that I have convinced you to relight my, I mean, the fire!
