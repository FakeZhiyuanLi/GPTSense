      My life sucks soooo much right now. My friends aren't talking to me. It's Saturday, I'm all dressed up with no where to go, and I had to work yesterday. K just isn't interested in me anymore for some reason. I didn't get  a text last night from Aaron. Kill me. I need to stop wallowing around in my own self pity and stop listening to Norah Jones and Coldplay over and over again. God I suck.

      Yesterday after like 5 was terrible.  I hate my work. I hate people. I hate jerks, children, men, women, and my manager. He scheduled 4 people to work from 5-9:30 which in itself is dumb, because we never even have 4 people in the store buying stuff at once.  So he sent Danielle home at 6, and Christina home at 7. Once Christina left, buisness picked up from 7 to 8..We seriously had like 39847593 people in there, and only I was left with my manager. I had to wait on customers, fit shoes and do the cash register.  And since I was the one closing, I had to clean all the windows, mirrors, sweep, vacuum,  pop all the balloons, straighten shoes, dust and bring everything from outside in. Then from 8 to 9, NO ONE CAME IN. Oh wait, I mean one person. At 8:59. And he stayed there until 9:15. Because he probably knew I would have gotten off at 9 if he didn't come in. People are mean.  And then there was this man who I asked if he needed any help...He acted as though he didn't hear me, and walked ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE STORE to find my manager and ask him for help. I rang him up, and he asked me if we had something I'd never heard of, and he proceeded to call me stupid and I seriously almost cried. Apparently if you're a girl, you're stupid. Aj;lksdfjasldkf.  This other family came in at 8:45, and made me call over to Valley View to see if they had a pair of shoes we didn't have. I called over, and asked Robin (The manager) to hold them and that they'd be there in like 5 minutes to pick them up. Well Robin has a stick up her ass 24/7, and hates me, wishes I would die..Because once again I'm a teenage girl who's actually smart and she can't stand that. She bitches me out about how they close at 9, because you know I wasn't aware of that, and hung up the phone on me.  So yay, tonight I have off. Ohhhh no I don't.  My manager called me this morning at 11 and asked me to cover for someone tonight. Crap fuck crap. I hate that job sooo much. Quote from K-"Sometimes money isn't worth it."  Damn straight fool. Hell no it's not. He hates his job too. He cleans tables at one of our steakhouses. It sucks. A lot.  I talked to him last night after my terrible time at work, and he told me his life is just like majorly sucking right now.  That he has no friends, and he might as well hook some explosives to his car and run into a tree.  And how explosives were really easy to get. And how if he did it, no one would notice.  What the fuck? Am I not alive? Am i not his FRIEND?! I assured him everything would be okay, I'd miss him if he left, and that he was awesome. He IS awesome. And well, stupid....  I also chatted with Mary K and Aaron last night as well on my cell phone on AIm, but my phone just decided to die so I didn't get to really talk.  I told Aaron I could really use a hug, and he responded with "If I could, I would give you a hug." Aww how cute.  And apparently he's not talking to Mary K either, and she's very upset over it.  Whatev, they've done this like a bazillion times, it'll work out. I know it.  I have a hair appointment Tuesday, the day before school starts, and I'm going to go crazy with it.  CUT and highlighted. I'm not even going to look like me. yay.  I have to go putt putting on Monday will Al, WHit and Kel. Wooo fun.  I hope I talk to K today...I hate work. And I can't wait for school. I looooove school.  Out.

      Aaron texted me last night and the night before...He's still acting a little wierd though, I don't know what's up. K took me out for breakfast this morning. He didn't eat because he's wierd and says he only eats lunch, so he had water and watched me feed myself 3 very large chocolate chip pancakes and a large milk. He paid. How nice is that?  He also went on about how bad drugs are, and wow.  I really do enjoy talking to him, and share actual laughs with him too. He's just a nice kid. His driving on the other hand FREAKS THE HELL OUT OF ME. But I'll save that for later. (Oh, he also blasts rap. Yay!)  I'm out.

      Today's been pretty awesome..With it only being 4pm, but still.  I was woken up by Kal13 at 10:30 calling my cell phone, and then Amber called at 11, and then Kal13 called my house and my mom came and got me. Ughdafsdflsk. Damn ya'll, can I not sleep in for once?!  Anyway, I got my sorry ass up, and got ready, drove to Kal13's, picked them up and we went to Waffle House. The waitress was a bitch, so we were just as pleasant as always, and smiled and gave her a very large tip she didn't deserve. Because we nice slash awesome.  (By the way..Still no text from Aaron.)  We drove around and Amber made us go to some adult shop on Williamson. Dirty people worked their, and they sold lighters in the shape of penis'. "Dick lights" they were called. Ugh guh dirty, I had to leave. It was too sketchball for me.  I learned I have no idea where I'm going around this town, because I'm stupid and I've ONLY lived here for 17 years.  So laaa dee dah, we drove around forever, went to Ambers house, then Kali3 and I went to W1ldflower and picked up applications.  Drove to school to pick up my schedule. It was sooooo good seeing everyone again. Disapointing however to see that none of the boys got any taller.  My schedule rocks, and I have study hall 8th period which means I get to leave at 2:18! Yay!(2:18? What? Someone totally fucked with our schedules, and for some reason school goes to 3:10 now.  Like we're going to get sooo much done in that extra 2 minutes in each class. a;sldk;als)  And have 3rd lunch with everyoneeeeeee. Only like 2 other freshman are with us, so woot woot woot. They all looked so lost already, I love that. It's hilarious. Can't believe I'm going to be a senior. Holy shit.  English first, personal finace with Coach B..Yay!, Socialology (Current Affiars second semester), College Algebra, Anatomy, lunch, then Gov. Woooot. Love itttt. Weeeeeeee.  Kyle has been really sketchy lately....A text message I recieved from him yesterday said "I would come visit you at work if I didn't have to work myself...I'd come..LOL and KISS you." Like..what? WTF. Wierdo.  I have to go over to my grandparents tonight for dinner. Too see my aunt A who I haven't seen since THE DAY OF MY BIRTH. I've changed a lot since then..I hope she knows my name. She's really old.  La la la. Haven't talked to V all day. Hope she's okay. Saw Mel at school, waved. I love Rachel, I've missed her sooo much. We actually get to scream at eachother this year bc we're seniors! Yay. We've waited since junior high.  Saw Andrew, he waved all cutely. I love him, hes adorable. I still miss Aaron. Damnit. DAMNIT. Gotta run.

      So I'm not only an extremely creul person, I'm now a dumbass as well. I made Kyle come meet me all the way out at Target last night at like 10, not knowing Target closes at 10, and him not knowing I have a curfew at 11. Point one creulness. Point 2 creulness occured right before when I told him I was all excited about hanging out with him, and we only really hug out for approximitly 6 minutes. I feel like I'm merging into an R. Kelly state, even though he IS only 6 months younger. And he's like "badass" too. He's got tattoos and piercings. Jeez. Anyway, my point of being a DUMBASS, which if I could take back I really would because it was really wrong of me...I told Aaron I had a boyfriend. What the hell made me do that? I don't have a boyfriend. You see, for the past 3 weeks, Aaron has been really overly friendly and sweet and nice, he text messages me every morning inbetween midnight and 2:30am to just say "Hey." How cute is that anyway? I got to thinking, and decided to be all "Yeah, I'm dumping this guy I'm dating tomorrow..etc etc etc." And he responded with "You have a boyfriend!?" I said yes...blah blah blah, but that I hated him and such, and that I loved Aaron WAY more....(I'm sure he took that as a joke though...) But he didn't respond back. Eeeek. He's not talking to me, and I feel like crap. Crapity crap crap crap. Kyle has been iming me for the past hour, and I'm not talking to him for some reason...I signed off without saying goodbye, and now his away message reads, "why did she leave me without saying good bye?" Just kill me now and get it over with, please. And then there's James. Poor guy. Allison keeps telling him that I like him and can't wait to meet him. Blah blah blah, I couldn't care less about meeting him. He's not an interesting person, and ohhh wait for this..HE PLAYS GOLF. I canNOT date someone who plays golf. How..bland of them. I'm a bitch. School starts in 12 days. I'll be a senior. It'll be fun. All my friends are gone this week looking at colleges. I'll be screwed over and end up going to VWCC..what fun. And now I have 3 guys to juggle. And Mark..He's my next victim. Why can't I ever have anyone that I actually LIKE? He's 6'3, blonde hair, green eyes, plays guitar, is hilarious, smart, plays at the factory, lives like 4 minutes away from me...and hey..he thinks I'M hot. Hahahaha.. Too much to ask I guess....
