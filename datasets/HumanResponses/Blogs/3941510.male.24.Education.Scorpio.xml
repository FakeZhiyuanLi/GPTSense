      Hi all, sorry for not posting in awhile. Here is a quick update on what I've been up to:  My first week of training I ran every day. I couldn't keep this up because my shins and knees were bothering me. I took a couple days off, made sure to get good shoes, got some equipment, and now I'm back to running. I'd like to run everyday but my strict guideline is going to be not less than every other day, except if I'm injured.  I am going to be posting statistics for each of my runs on this site. I can do this because I got this great gadget that I highly recommend to anyone who plans to do a lot of running:  urlLink The Forerunner 201 . It allows me to track how far I've run, how fast I'm going, my average pace, number of calories burned, and a host of other statistics. After my run, I upload my previous run statistics to my computer, make a copy of the screen stats, and send it to the blog. Pretty simple. See below for some recent running stats. A quick note about them: They are not always accurate. The one downside of my Forerunner 201 is that it sometimes loses its GPS signal, and this can screw up the stats. For the most part they are correct, and they give me a good general picture of my progress, but there are anomolies.

      My official training with the National AIDS Marathon Training Program does not begin until September 19, 2004. I'll be running in my pace group on Sunday mornings from that point until right before the race. I must also run for at least 30-40 minutes three times a week, in addition to the longer runs on the weekend. All of this running amounts to a serious time commitment.  However, because I have a long way to go to get in shape, I unofficially started my own running regimen on July 11. I plan to run no less than 4 days a week, beginning with slow, measured 2 mile runs and increasing my distance by about 10% a week until I can run 6 miles at a 9 min/mile pace. I'd like to accomplish this by the time the official training begins.  My goal in the Mardi Gras marathon is not just to do a run/walk finish. Instead, I'm aiming to run the entire way and finish in under 4 hours. In order to do this, I need to maintain an average pace throughout the 26 mile race of no more than 9.16 minutes per mile. This is going to be very difficult for me, to say the least.

         Where does the money go?      The money we [the SF office of the National AIDS Marathon Training Program] raise will support the work of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. SFAF serves 130,000 individuals each year, providing housing assistance, one-on-one counseling, and treatment adherence programs, as well as advocacy on local, state, and federal AIDS - related legislation. Funds will also support Needle Exchange programs throughout the Bay Area to help stop the spread of HIV, as well as a program to support treatment access in the developing world.     What is the cost of fundraising?     In the past three years, we have raised $10 million for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, of which 46% went to expenses and the remaining 54% went to AIDS services and prevention. We are constantly working to keep costs to a minimum by seeking donations of goods and services. The results from this year's program will depend upon the amount that our participants raise. The more our participants raise, the lower the cost of fundraising.     Is my donation tax deductible?     Yes. Money raised through the National AIDS Marathon Training Program is tax deductible to the fullest extent of the law. All contributions will benefit the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, a non-profit 501-C (3) organization. The federal tax ID is 94-2927405.     Will I receive a receipt for my contribution?     Yes. The San Francisco AIDS Foundation will mail a receipt for all donations. You may also print out your confirmation page and save it for your records.     Will my employer match my contribution?     Corporate Matching Gifts can dramatically increase the value of your donation. Many companies will match the charitable contributions of their employees. Be sure to ask your company's Human Resources department to find out if your company has such a policy.      How can I donate by mail?      If you prefer to make your donation by mail, click here to download a  urlLink Donor Form . You will need to write the name and participant number of your friend in the upper right-hand portion of the Form [i.e. Jeffrey Wolf #SF-6012]. You can provide your check or credit card number as payment and mail or fax to the AIDS Marathon pledge office. The address and fax number for making donations are printed on the form.     What happens to my donation if my friend has to drop out of the training program?     Contributions will be processed immediately upon receipt by the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. If injury or other unforeseen circumstances prevent the AIDS Marathon participant from completing the training program, your donation will nonetheless benefit the Foundation's critically important AIDS services.  No refunds will be issued .

      I'm training for the  urlLink 2005 Mardi Gras Marathon , which will take place on February 27, 2005 in New Orleans. From September until February 2005, I'll be logging nearly 500 miles in this six-month training program put on by the  urlLink National AIDS Marathon Training Program .   I'm doing this for two reasons:   (1) To support the  urlLink San Francisco Aids Foundation . I was astounded to learn that approximately 1 in every 50 San Franciscans is living with HIV/AIDS. That's right, 1 in 50. Your donations will support HIV services and prevention programs in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties - to help keep people alive until there's a cure. A portion of the funds will also support treatment access in the developing world.   (2) To get in shape - something that hasn't been the case for all too long.   If I haven't convinced you to get out your debit or credit cards yet, you might, in the end, just like to donate in order to indulge in a bit of  schadenfreude . Many of you are aware how hard it is for me to get up before noon - I mean, uh, early in the morning. So, you might be tickled to know that your donation will, indirectly, ensure that  I get up and run a couple of miles at the crack of dawn every weekend for the next 6 months  or so - not to mention the shinsplints, blisters and other aches and pains I will incur along the way.    urlLink So choose your cause and donate now ! I've made  a personal commitment to raise at least $3,000  by Friday, November 26, 2004 - and I hope to raise even more. Any contribution you can make would mean a great deal to me (and I do mean  any  - a fellow  urlLink grad student  has already promised to donate $5, and you should all know that $5 in discretionary spending is, in fact, a significant sum for us impoverished grad students). More importantly, your  tax-deductible contribution  will make a huge difference in the lives of thousands of people living with  urlLink AIDS .   Thanks for your generous support. And don't forget to email this page to all your friends and family and badger them to donate. And have their friends and family donate. And why not ask your employer for a matching contribution (seriously, most companies will do this)?  Stay healthy and happy.    Best,  Jeff
