       Hmmm, just back from a jpn trip. Usually people said what's good abt their trip. i will said what's BAD;   1) In return i got a camera that cost 20 HKD cheaper if i buy it in HK argh!!!! >_  2) Alot of Japanese men get to see my lovely naked body when doing the hot spring thing.... I can sees many jealous eyes (no, not that eye, the usual eyes)   3) Sushi and sashimi is cheap which i discover on the last day.  4) Ramen is expensive which i also discover on the last day.  5) Japanese stuffs are made in China..... i only got 2 things that isn't.

But of course there are many fun and good things la.  planning my nxt trip there already la!!!! in abt 300 days la. cos they are having this expo thing nxt year ga!!!
