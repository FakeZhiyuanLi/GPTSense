      Well, this is a novelty. After two years on Live Journal I've decided to get a blog. I hear you can post photos/images on it directly, which would pretty much be the reason for me creating this blog. &nbsp; It'll probably just be for things like art. Sort of a cross between Live Journal and DeviantArt. Hopefully, however, I can post more publicly on here, as it's likely that no-one's going to know it exists for at least a while. &nbsp;  (Live Journal -   urlLink  www.livejournal.com/users/minimullet   )   (DeviantArt -  urlLink http://minimullet.deviantart.com )    &nbsp; So why  Ujimaflip ? - Well, it was pretty much the first thing that came into my head. I figured that  Spaceboy  would be taken,  minimullet 's a bit misleading, as I don't have a mullet (be it small or not), nor am I small generally. Something derived from my name would just be a bit... unoriginal. &nbsp; Now that's all sorted, it's time to peruse my journal, and make it feel more like home. &nbsp;  Currently listening to:   Love Will Find a Way  by Yes

      Alright, I've decided on how things are going to work-out with the various (couple of) blogs that I own. This is going to be what seems to be more the mature way of writing, i.e. observations: Thoughts about what's around me, but not about me.  So I'm talking things such as  there seemed to be a lot of good-looking girls in Derby today. Perhaps it's just because it's a gorgeous day and the weather's rubbing off on the ladies, or just making them wear as little as possible while still maintaining a touch of dignity. - I didn't think Derby was particularly notorious for it's attractive women-folk.     Speaking of Derby, I saw an interesting notice outside a church, something along the lines of  "Half the world's worry is caused by trying to make decisions when not enough information is known to make the decisions."  It made me think a little more than the usual crap on the front of churches, yet it does seem just a little bit presumptious...  __________  Something that made me chuckle yesterday, and seems to increasingly so is the amount of archived camera footage on the news (BBC is what I'm talking about, but I'd guess it's the same, if not more so, on other networks):   "Fifteen people were killed in Iraq today in fighting between multinational forces and armed rebels. A helicopter was shot down..."  *Cue (what I can only assume to be an) archive shot of an apache flying.*  But this wasn't the example which really made me laugh. There was better in the summary in the closing seconds:   "The Bank of England has raised interest rates by a quarter of a percent."  (That's right, right?) And whilst this was being said it just showed a clip of a highstreet. I guess there's not really much you can show for a story like that, but still, it did make me chortle.  These examples clearly aren't as good (bad?) as what happened a couple of years ago when Fox had some story or other involving the New York skyline, and the current skyline miraculously still had the WTC sticking up like... a sore thumb (or something a little more obscene)?

      I've just been on the Guardian's weblog list, and it seems that most of them are bloggers. - No Live Journals whatsoever. Perhaps Live Journal has some kind of issue with copyright; I don't know. It does suggest that blogs are better than LJs though. Get through the complications and it's clear sailing is what's suggested. It'd be nice to have a good-looking blog, but sadly my HTML, web-publishing etc. etc. skillz aren't particularly l33t...
