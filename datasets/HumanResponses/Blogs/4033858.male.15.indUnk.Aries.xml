      I can't seem to find my Microsoft Office 2000 CD anywheres at my house which if you ask me is a load of crap! I had to re-register frontpage with my new user on the computer, and I couldn't find the CD so there's nothing I can do (for now)  - Shippo-chan

      Hey, this is my 1st time posting to my blog  I've been having trouble with my website, but I got everything fixed. Which is good!  Today I went to the Y's Men's Picnic, and I had hotdogs, hamburgers, pop ... it's all good!  I couldn't have a blog on my own website only because of a few problems.   So, I am slowly getting through the summer, which has been BORING!   Have to finish this up quick before I go to sleep...  ZzZzZz...  Just joking!!   Well I g2g. Need sleep.   Bye 4 now!   Oh, and P.S.: Any LAF members out there? I say "HI!" to all of them! (my LAF name is "shippo")

       urlLink    Since this is my PERSONAL blog, I would like to show you my dog, Star! She's currently 1 year old. When I'm going on vacation, she going in a kennel :( but I heard that they take all the animals out for walks 2 times a day! For her that's spoiling her 'cause my dad takes her out at least 2 walks a week :( but she gets lots of excercise from running around in the back yard!
