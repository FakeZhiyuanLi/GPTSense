      I am still recovering from the wedding and the after math of saturday night...always a good time!  So i worked tonight will melissa...made some cash...which i wasn't expecting....but hey it's all good. so tomorrow is memorial day.  I was plannin on goin surfin' and maybe doin' a little fishing...but the weather is looking a little shitty and I think we're gonna scratch that.  But as always the party must go on, so we're contemplating what to do tomorrow night.  So many choices, so little time.  I'm sure we'll come up with something good.  After all it is a holiday...which is one more reason to party...hehe.  So the plans seem to be homewrekin' (as I like to call it) with Deedee and a crew that seems to vary from time to time.  Still not sure what the final destination will be, but there are many options none the less.  OH, and let me just tell you about my stalker! I now have more than one bar stalker.  Amusing, but scary at the same time.  Not sure how to handle the situation, but i'll come up with something eventually.  At least I have off tomorrow and I can contemplate something for the future.  Guys are weird, and I'm not sure of their thinking...but stalking is really not good.  I"m sure of that! well, it's late and I need to be getting some rest before the rest of today begins...I'm sure i'll have another fucked up blog to share, along with some fabulous pics...hahaha. Speaking of which I can't wait to get my pictures developed! u'll see soon enough. Along with that I would also like to say, that deedee has written a kick ass song, that describes a good part of my life as well.  I'll share it with you when she gives me the proper permission and copy right laws...haha. goodnight!

      and I like the lyrics...kinda spells my life out sometimes...  Don't Stay  Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe Sometimes I need you to stay away from me Sometimes I’m in disbelief I didn’t know Somehow I need you to go  Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities What you were changing me into Just give me myself back and Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities Take all your faithlessness with you Just give me myself back and Don’t stay  Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself Sometimes I’m in disbelief I didn’t know Somehow I need to be alone   I don’t need you anymore, I don’t want to be ignored I don’t need one more day of you wasting me away I don’t need you anymore, I don’t want to be ignored I don’t need one more day of you wasting me away With no apologies

      This weekend was Melissa's mother's wedding...The wedding itself was very simple in a park in Cartert.  Charming...reminded me that if, god forbid, I ever get married, it's gonna be a small thing.  I'd like to have a little something barefoot on the beach and then a big reception...cause that's the good part! And let me just tell you...the reception was fun!  Melissa's family is just about as much disfunctional as mine, so we get along..haha.  There was definately too much alcohol! We were all trashed, dancing and attempting to video tape the occassion.  Should show to be funny tapes to watch!  Today was mostly a series of hangovers and trying to clean up this mess in the apt.  which is still in major progress as we speak.  Of course we're gonna go get a beer and chill in a little while...(can't not drink on a saturday night, with no work!!!) All in all the weekend was kick ass, and I'm looking forward to doin' some surfin' on Monday.  Pigfucker...aka DD will be joining me to jam down the shore and chill on the beach.  I'm gonna have to check up on the surf reports to see if it's even worth bringin the surfboard and wetsuit all the way down there.  Got my fingers crossed though!

      So today I had the pleasure of working all fucking day...fun fun. I made some good money though, and rocked the resturants sales with my "u suck" ratings...haha! Melissa moved her shit in today... so the apt. is even a bigger mess! My girlfriend also had the pleasure of rolling around in my bed trying to pick up my scent...I find this funny and intriguing. On the other hand, this weekend is showing to be a very very interesting one.  I've got the wedding tomorrow complete with hotel room, open bar and shuttles...what more could you ask for! I do have to get up rather early which sux, but it's all good and will be worth it. I even get to get my hair did! JOY!  I'm sure i'll have lots of pics to show everyone how badly we were fucking up!  The bonus is no fucking fridays! At least until Sunday. But that's ok, cause Monday is surfing day!!!!! It will be the first time I'm going out this season...I'll try and avoid the sharks this time...hehe, but I can't promise anything!  Well, I gotta go find my dress and shoes and shit and start packin' stuff up for the weekend...we'll talk again on Sunday, maybe....if I live through the weekend :)

      So last night was fun. We all gathered at Lazy Lanagans for cocktails...i said cock, yeah so anyways, sandy decided to drink heavily...like it's anything new! I spilt a jack and ginger all over melissa...in the beginning of the night, I wasn't even buzzed yet! So we proceded to go into the bathroom and attempt to exchange pants. yeah, didn't go as planned seeing how she wears pants that are two sizes smaller than mine, but we did find out we were wearing the same underwear only in different colors!  rock on! so the end of the night comes, i'm stupid retarded and got scooped up by Christian and taken home.  From that point on things get foggy. I found out in the morning that I had multiple conversations online...none of which I recall, made myself yet another drink and attempted to cook spagettios. The only reason I know any of this is because I found the reminants of it scattered amongst the apartment.  Then I ended up going into work at 11 still hammered! Yeah, service bar is not fun when ur still drunk.  Of course the first drink I have to make for the day involves Jack Daniels, making me want to hurl, and the day just progressed on from there!  After work I decided to chill and watch tv (willy wonka was on and halted all productivity for a while..hehe).  Swung by Fridays to pick up the tattoo cream stuff that I left, grabbed Melissa and started another night of fucking up.  Target', yes, with the correct punctuation, followed by shopping at the porn shop with Sunshine.  Interesting deal.  We found some very interesting things, which led Melissa and myself to decide to buy a sex swing next time and have it as our center piece in the apartment. I'm sure it will make a nice addition to the place!  We then ended up the night meeting up with my girlfriend Jen at fabulous Fridays and yes, once again, drinking until closing.  God I'm an alcoholic! It's ok...u only live once right?  The liver is capable of regeneration...maybe.  So here I am again back home not looking foward to a double shift tomorrow followed by packing for this weekends adventures with Melissa's family.And that's it....so PEACE!

      So I finally got my first tattoo! I was supposed to get it days ago, but there were too many people there at the time, so today was my appointment. So the crew and I drove out for the experience.  Quite an interesting experience might I say.  At one point, when the artist was on the bone, it hurt but at the same time felt good, perhaps a little too good! All I have to say is if the lower extremity of my body kept vibrating the way it did...oh baby...the tattooist and myself would have been sharing a cig...hahaha!  So now i'm addicted, cause I want more... but i'll wait at least till after the summer to start again. I got too much shit to do, and not enough time to let myself heal!  As for the rest of the day, I told myself that there was not gonna be anymore drinking today, especially after all the hangovers from yesterday...but I lied. Another day, another drink, haha.  I can't help it, the peoples came in and well, one thing led to another, story of my life.  Today is another day, with yet another bar to visit! It's Joe's birthday, and what would that be like without Party time Sandy!  So let the festivities continue yet again!  Well, I got lots and lots to do tomorrow...it's gonna be another overproductive day packed with fun, so I must be off.  I leave you with this...Life is too short to drink cheap alcohol, cry over things lost, and worry about tomorrow.  Surround yourself with the people that mean something and your life will always be something.  Nice!

      So I didn't believe that you could get a hangover while still drinking...but I proved myself wrong today!  The party was fucking awesome! Good times good times.  I'm still soaking wet...hehe wouldn't you like to know why! haha,  you should have been there! Way too many hours of drinkin out in the sun.  I was glad to see the people that came out to jam with us.  Each day just seems to be a bigger party.  I keep partyin' like this and I may not make it to see my 24th birthday!  Anyways, I now have enough Jack Daniels to kill me! Let's just hope that doesn't happen...got way to much to accomplish yet!  So tomorrow is my tattoo appointment, very excited! I will have a crowd with me to enjoy my pain (I swear they get off on this shit, hehe).  And oh, I remembered a point Danielle brought up a while ago today.  A good question with a perfect response might I say. The doctor asked if she drank everyday...her reply...yeah, but sometimes I only have one! FABULOUS! I need to start using that! So right now my head is fabulously bangin' and I need to lay my body down, I have abused it enough for today!  And I leave this blog with the Larry joke....So, a Jewish man says after his husband dies.....

       Today was an overly productive day! Up too early to leave the bed, Mc D's for the B-fast followed by a lovely bar meeting and then revamping of the apt. and off to hell yet again! Yeah, so I'm used to being "the party" since I end up having to bartend all weekend, but tonight just dragged. Some pretty hot guys came in, (yes this does not always happen), so it made the night a little more interesting. Not to mention the amount of people I got completely trashed and the amount of shots I made.But my working weekend has just ended! I have off tomorrow!  I'll be having my i dunno how many-ith graduation party!  It feels like every day since I graduated we've been out celebrating! I'm sure my liver hates me. But it's gonna have to hold on a little more, cause i'm sure it's gonna be put to good use tomorrow!  I'm hoping the weather holds up so the party can be outdoors and indoors..hehe.  With the people that are coming i'm sure a wet tee shirt contest or the like will be brought up...damn perverts! It'll be a good time none the less. Things otherwise are still interesting, and although I would like to see the evil side of me come out and cause trouble, I'm being good and trying to be civil. Still taking things in good stride.  We'll just have to see where things lead me.  For now, Jack and I have jammed and I must be trying to sleep soon.  I gotta get up and be productive.  Many things to do tomorrow in preparation.  Along with some food buying there will be a raid of a specific alcohol store for festivity purposes...You know who you are and I'm comin to raid your shit....hahaha.  well, enough for now...

      So I've had some interesting information revealed to me today and it looks like melissa will be moving in with me...fun times ahead....haha.  Anyways, I've decided to take everything each day as it come. NO ONE is gonna keep me down and I'll make the best out of everything that comes my way.  So for now I need to try and sleep, got the bar clean up in the mornin' and I've been drinking enough for like three of us...so it's off to bed I go.  Let's hope tomorrow brings more karma for people who deserve it and everything to hopefully be a little better.

       Ok, so I finally decided to put my life on display.  At least this way my friends from home and across the country can keep up...I guess!  So major changes in my life have occurred. Like always, I'm pickin up the pieces and moving on...the story of my life.  Just when you thought you had something good, it all goes to shit. I'll get over it like all the other disappointments in my life. I've realized, that maybe I need some major changes.  I'm gonna go out and get the job I really want.  I'm gonna go out and do the things I want to.  Some more major changes are here!  Starting with my first tattoo! yeah, i'm excited!  I'm tired of feeling like I'm missing out, like i'm not getting what I deserve, and you know what...I deserve better! I'm gonna flip my life around from this point on! Fuck what I've known.  Fuck what I loved.  Karma will bite them in the ass.  It's my time to shine for a change! And on that note I would also like to say that when you finally become single, it's amazing what comes out of the woodwork! The amount of guys that have came to me, the things that they have said lately is amazing.  I never knew I was so admired.  I feel honored!  I felt like I was shit, and this concept is amazing to me.  So many people have came to me lately and told me what they really think of me and what I am in their eyes, and honestly, I'm almost in tears.  When I felt like a piece of shit, they actually admired me...unbelieveable!  I was hurt, trust me, I've been hurt alot in my life, but right now, I can't believe the people that have been at my side.  I have the most amazing friends, and I'm grateful.  From this point on, I'm turing over a new leaf.  I'm becoming the Sandy I should have been...carefree and open to new things.  I'm gonna get the job I always dreamed of, I'm going to do the things I always wanted.  Anyone who is missing out on who I'm going to be and who I am, should be sad.  Cause I have nothing to lose.  This past week has been interesting.  The partyin' I've done was out of control.  The people who were there with me, I thank you!  You are the people I will keep with me on my journeys!  I've had a good time. You have made me deal with the pain and the hurt that I've been through and made me realize that I'm not the one losing out...that it is those people who chose not to be in my life who are gonna lose out in the long run.  From now on in...it's gonna be me...the Sandy that I am supposed to be. The one who takes the world on her shoulders and smiles while she does it!  I will conquer all and make something of myself while everyone else looks at what they could have been.  From this point on...It's gonna be something different...something completely different, and I will be happy...I will be something.  And that's about it for now....

      Yesterday was massively productive!  I got up at the butt-crack and finally got to the county department to get my passport!YAY!  The power went out in most of Hackensack, so I didn't have to do anything with the highschool kids...good shit.  Then we went to the bar flair @ Geronimos....kick ass time...too much drinking!  I started with Jack on the rocks...that can tell you what kind of night we had!!!!  We left just a little bit early cause it was Ralph's last shift at TGIF, but of course we said we didn't drink enough...so more drinking!  I remember standing up on table 80 and attempting to steal a screwdriver to get the tricycle off the wall!  Things from the whole night are still a little fuzzy.  I do however remember coming home, and instead of drinking some water, I drank another beer...bad idea!  I had work this morning...and oh god was it ugly!  My sunglasses became a permanant part of my uniform!  After work I got to formally meet my highschool kids.  And they are GHETTO!  This is gonna a be a fun time...yeah right!  I let them out early...cause I couldn't take it anymore!  So now we trying to gather the groups and go to the Meadowlands Fair...and of course there will be more damn drinking.  Best thing for a hangover...another drink!  Hopefully we'll make it to see the new Spiderman tonight too.....SPIDERMAN!!!! I'm so excited!  If we don't make it tonight we are definately going tomorrow!  Fuck the bullshit...spiderman is important! ok...gotta get productive!

      The night was soooooooooooooooooooo slow at the beginning! We had some mishaps and therefore I worked with Marisa instead of Melissa.  Hopefully all will be worked out by Tuesday! We got a mini rush towards the end of the night and ended up making bank..... SWEET! So overall i'm very pleased!  Tommorrow is showing to be way too fucking productive! Since I was a fuck up on Friday, I need to get up extra early and finally get on my passport, otherwise I'm not gonna have it in time for Aruba!  Then I get to go out into the lovely "field" with the highschool kids and do some research.  Oh Joy!  Then it's back to apt. for sudzy shower time and then we're off to the bar comp. @ Geronimos!  That's gonna be a good time.  What is not gonna be a good time is service bar in the am on Tuesday!  I can already predict that I'm gonna be a fucking mess!  It's all good...cause after that we're gathering and going to the Meadowlands fair!!!! YAY! More good times!  In light of some new information, which I would rather not disclose...it looks like we're not going to Vegas after all...but it's all good, cause I got a better idea for the birthday.  I suggest we all go sky diving! What better way to spend your birthday than jumping out of a perfectly good plane! I'm excited!  Let's just see if everyone else is as excited!  For now, it's sleepytime for me...got lots to accomplish...so peace.

      I've made it to Sunday early morning and I haven't been trashed yet! Good girl! But the weekend is not over yet...Let's see if we can keep this going!  Monday night, however, is the bar comp. at Geronimos...which, in tradition, I have not been sober for in years!  Should definately prove to be a very interesting night! Got a busy schedule this week, so I need to try and stay as sober as possible!  I get to start playing with highschool kids on Monday morning...oh joy, but I will also be discussing the possiblity of going to the Dominican Republic for a semester to "studen teach." hehe if that's possible.  Would be pretty kick ass! But I need to be handling the shit at hand.  I passed up a fabulous trip to Pearl River so I can sleep and get my stuff accomplished in the am. So I'm gonna go do just that....pass out!  Tomorrow is yet another fun and exciting day!

      Where do I begin?  Tuesday evening was interesting.  Drunken pool and darts followed by a wonderful visit to Biagios... Abe was trashed, but decided to drive the soccer mom van anyways.  We ended up back at my apt. drinkin' Jack again.  And then that bastard did the unheard of!  He ripped the power cord out of my modem fucking my whole shit up!  Fucking Neener! We just said fuck it and passed out. To sum things up...I went into work Wed. morning still drunk!  Yeah, not a good time...and I had to work a double so by mid evening the hangover set in.  The beginning of the night was a little ugly...but got better as the night went on.  I made good money and jammed with some pretty kick ass people.  I didn't have the strength to go out anywhere yesterday so I just had a couple of drinks after work and back at the apt.  Melissa and I got to watch the tapes from Vegas....some funny shit!  She has me fucking up hardcore drunk before we got on the plane to come home!  Needless to say we laughed for a few hours with some Miller Lite and finally let it be bedtime.  Today I was productive...or at least I like to think I was!  Got all my laundry done... made it to the bank...and since I didn't have to work (YAY!) went to Bayonne to pick up my birth certificate came back and "fixed" my modem from Abe! Never underestimate the power of Sandy! hahaha.  Tomorrow is looking pretty productive as well.  I gotta find the place to get my passport, cause.....I'M GOING TO ARUBA I'M GOING TO ARUBA...NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH.  Sorry just had to rub it in!hehehe. ok...so now Abe is coming to kidnapp me once again...like this is something new...and we're goin' out!  I'm sure i'll have more stories later! hahaha.

      It seemed to have slipped my mind that I was scheduled for morning service bar today.  I realized it last night as I was getting plastered! And oh last night...or should I say all day and all night!  We all gathered around 12-12:30 to head out to the city for the Bar Expo.  Piled into the Asian caravan and were off.  The bar expo was so kick ass. We are going every year.  I don't even know where to start.  There was soooooooo much alcohol and energy drinks it was sick.  So being the level headed crew that we are, we proceeded to "test" every liquor, beer, mixed drink, wine, sake and energy drink at least 3 times...some more than others!  The scotch is what did me in! We bought flair bottles...so i can stop breaking things...hehehe and got to watch the flair competition.  Mike from Bourban St. was in it, and let me just say, he kicks ass!  There were also a couple of bartenders from Argentina...yeah if they all look like those guys...i'm moving there tomorrow! Hotties! We ran into a couple of other bartenders from around here that we knew...but they were no where near the drunken-ness that we were!  We took pics with the Hawaiian Tropic girls, the Coyote Ugly girls and chilled with a few other people working for alcohol companies...good shit.  Finally we had to go cause it was over...but our partyin' wasn't! Luis came out and met us in the village where we finally got something to eat to try and sober a little.  Then it was off to the bars yet again!  I think our first stop was the Fat Black Pussy Cat.  Real chill place. Although Luis and Ryan almost got raped in there a few times..hahaha. Then we were off again...we went to a couple of bars and proceeded to get trashed.  Dan, Melissa and their friend Brian met up with us at the Peculiar bar, where King found it funny to try and ID people at the door, until he got into trouble by the owner!  I remember chillin' at a bar called 1849...really cool place.  They had live music and shit.  Our final destinations included pizza and of course...Gray's Papaya.  You cannot leave the city without going there...it's like tradition! hahahaha.  I don't remember what time I got home...but I know I was fucking tired and passed out.  That was one kick ass day!  Now i'm trying to recover because tonight we're off yet again.  We're going to see some bands play at Mexicali Blues.  I gotta work a double shift tomorrow, so I hope we all don't get to messed up.  But then again...I got Abe drinking Jack...so I see everything going downhill!

      Another fabulous weekend in hell....hehe. Good weekend though. Some interesting happenings along with meeting some more interesting people! Got some numbers which I find to be the most amusing part!!! hahaha. Got asked on some more trips and even some dates...hahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaha. Guys are funny.  So now, finally, the weekend is over.  Tomorrow, however, begins another week of complete fucking up! In the afternoon hours we will be bringing the crew to NYC for the bar expo followed by bar crawling for the rest of the evening.  We've got an fun group coming with us, along with some more people meeting up with us later on in the city.  It's gonna be a fucking night! I'm gonna need recovery time, but once again, I'm denied! I get to work in the am on Tues. Oh joy once again! I also got a jammy phone call from Amsterdamn this morning...kinda brightened my day!  Glad to hear that all is well and stoned in that fabulous place...all I can say is that I wish I were there right now!  We also dicussed my birthday plans this weekend.  My last birthday was nothing to brag about since we basically just chilled out, so this year it's on!  So far the plans are looking like going back to Vegas! The Vegas five will be in attendence along with some sporatic others...just more fuckin up!  The plans are still in the making.  We have also decided to conger up some back up plans as well.  These are looking pretty sweet as well.  We've got the regular, everyday thing better known as A.C., Foxwoods in CT, as well as a fabulous trip to Canada....destination unknown.  There are so many places we could cause trouble in Canada!!!! This week we're gonna try and figure out were exactly we'll be heading along with the making of Ralph's going away present.  So if anyone has anything they'd like to share...get on it!  As for me right now, I'm exhausted.  Double shifts can kill ya! I need to get my ass to sleep because I have a very very very busy, drunkin', trouble makin', homewreckin' day tomorrow.  I'm sure i'll have lots to comment on! So G'nite

      Pretty kick ass night! I was in good spirits as well as the rest of my crew.  We got to rock the new uniforms...interesting to say the least.  Danielle was the mother of all boobs...that's all I gotta say.  I know she brought in a majority of our tips!!! I also got some "personal tips" which I would hand off to Natalia or Danielle on the other side of the bar.  Good shit. We made some pretty good fucking money this evening.  Much needed. So now i'm at home jammin', hehehe, with Melissa, about to cook some pizza.  Got another fabulous bar meeting in the morning followed by massive productivity since I"ve been a bum for a while now.  I also missed two phone calls from Amsterdamn...bad shit, seeing how everyone has a message for me to relay.  I need to start keeping my cell phone with me! hahaha. yeah right, that might happen! Ok, so i need to be doing some other shit right now....so i'm outtie 5000!

Made some money...not what I was expecting to, but I had a kick ass time reguardless.  Had a few drinks after work, as usual, and now I'm back home chillin'.  Got mad productivity tomorrow.  More than I think I know.  It's Friday so I have to work, but it's ok...ran into a few regulars who said they would come and jam with us tomorrow night....good shit!  I've noticed that jack goes down alot smoother than it should now...could be a bad thing...and could be a good thing...we'll see where it takes us! hahaha. anyways, i'll be at the bar yet again for a fabulous friday evening with Danielle and company.

      Last night was an interesting one.  Started out with dinner at this really cool resturant...and then the hopping started.  Eventually the hopping turned to crawling.  I'm not even sure how many bars we went to...I think 5 or 6.  I met a whole bunch of interesting people and crashed at a friends house.  I just got home now at like 2:30 and I get to go to glorious work! And i get to be a waitress for a change...I promise no breaking shit this time...I can't afford another trip to the emergency room! Well, I need to get my hungover ass in gear...so i'm off for now. Peace Love and Hair Grease! hahaha. it just sounds so stupid!

      So last night really gave my ass a beating! I was a bum all day...it was so nice!  I did clean up the apt. though...made me feel a little better.  But of course, I had to end the day at a bar...so I ran over to Biagios for a couple of beers. I did take it easy seeing how I have to work in the morning. Oh joy! I did make a decision on Aruba though.  I said fuck it, so I'm going! hehehe I get to go to Aruba!!!! What do I have to lose...not a damn thing! So I will be partyin in Aruba in August! Nice.  I do have to go out and get a dress and shit, seeing how I will be attending a wedding. Great more fucking shopping, gonna have to call out the girls on this one.  I'm gonna have to look like an actual girl! hahaha. Anyways, I was good tonight...only 3 beers.  My stomach couldn't handle much else after all the Jack, beer and shots from last night! It's ok...cause tomorrow I'm working...which will also be recovery time...followed by going out to dinner...hehe, and then we'll see what other festivities arise.  This week is also showing to be a mess! work and drinking all weekend, followed by the bar expo and the bar comp. at Geronimos.  I'm gonna be drunk...I can feel it already! ok well, need to put my mess of an ass to bed and try and get some sleep so I can go out and play again tomorrow!  a Au

      All I have to say is DAMN YOU ABE AND CORMAC! You bastards...I'm a mess right now.    Yesterday was very productive.  I was motivated to get shit done.  We went to two malls to get work shirts and stuff...and I got new sneakers...LOVE THEM! Got some cd's and we to Red Lobster for those fabulous biscuts.  Thats' when the drinking began.  Then we mazeled over to TGIF to get some money and check the shoppers report and had another drink. Then Abe and Cormac decided to kidnapp me for the night and got me completely retarded.  The night started at Bourban St. yet again...progressed to Biagios and ended up at Irelands. Bad..very bad.  I am so badly hungover...it's not even funny.  Fun night...can't deny that...but today I'm just hurting. I remember running into a couple of people from Geronimos... a guy I met through Deedee, some Cheesecake peoples, Scott and god knows who else.  I also remember stealing a glass from Irelands for Cormac...the rest is sort of a blur.  That's usually the way my nights end up! hahaha. I just got off the phone with Abe and he sounds just as retarded as I am...GOOD! Now he can feel my pain.  I was supposed to be productive yet again today...but I was passed out...so there goes that idea.  I'm gonna get motivated eventually and clean this place up cause I got peoples coming over to watch the Harry Potter movies.  Yes, I have not seen all of them, and they insist I go watch the third one with them, so I have to catch up. I need more coffee for all of this!  I leave you with the quote from Joe at Red Lobster, who is only helping my drinking probs...."What do you say we start with some appetizers....I'll have a beer!"

      I must say....Sunday at the bar......we clean up! All the stalkers come in...good times, and we make bank! Melissa and I kick ass...yet again!  It was an interesting one! I got invited to more festivities for the week...not sure which ones I'll attend...but hey it's all good, right? Had some Jack, he is my friend, as always...still jamming with him as we speak, it's only right I keep him by my side.  He had been the constant enjoyment that I have!  I enjoy Sundays....I have to work, which sucks, but the people I get to jam with make it all just a little bit better.  So this week, like all weeks, is looking pretty productive.  I have trips to the shore as well as trips to A.C.  Should show to be exciting none the less.  We'll just have to see what I'm willing to play with!hahaha.  So I also went online to see what kind of jobs are looking prospective...Some nice choices I might say.  There are a few in Hawaii, one in Alaska, a couple in Cali and a few in Jersey.  I must get on the resume tip and see where it leads me.  I'm willing to go where my heart tells me to go.  Speaking of going...Sunshine is leaving for Amsterdamn however you spell it, so I believe I'll be going out one day this week for a ride on the bike! I'm a little exicted seeing how I've never been on a motorcycle in motion!!!! hehe, maybe someday I'll tell you why it wasn't in motion! But i have been on multiple dirtbikes, but a motorcycle will be my first. GOOD SHIT! The bar expo is also coming up...but since I didn't get a chance to request off, it's looking like I'll be taking a Monday trip to it....all good, just another chance to hang out and drink in the city! At least i'll have friends coming with me! That is gonna be an ugly night! hehe.  So now I'm ending this up with the question that has been contemplated for the evening...besides the fact that I need to go fishing...and I'm not talking pussy ass fresh water fishing...real fishing in the ocean! I need to find a way to aquire my own boat.  Now I know the boat I have picked out to be my ideal boat is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too expensive for my pockets right now, but i'm willing to settle on a smaller craft for the time being.  It's just a matter of figuring out how to accomplish such a feat.  Anyone has any ideas, i'm all ears...let me know.  For now I'm gonna go and drink a little more and just chill out cause tomorrow is looking lovely yet productive...so peace.

      Today was a long day.  After the double shift, and the drinks from last night with the early morning bar shift...the day was looking pretty tiring.  A bizzare evening at the bar finished up the day, leaving me angered at a couple of people, exhausted, and willing to have a few beers. So that's exactly what I'm doing! Then I'm going to pass out and sleep like I have never slept before.  Snuggled in nothing but a sheet....FABULOUS! And now I need to take a moment to mention the Asian Invasion since he is an attention whore....The one the only, the crazy...ABE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There you happy again? It's not like we kidnapp each other constantly....ur name is always up in this bitch! hahaha. yeah, i'm delirious and need to go....so peace!

      So another fabulous night at the bar. I like my job but at the same time I hate it. It's a give and take situation.  I worked a double shift so it was a little rough, but I managed.  And tomorrow I get to go to a bar meeting followed by a trip to the mall and then mass cleaning then followed by work...fun day!  Should show to be productive! I also got an invite to Aruba in August. All expenses paid...spending money needed only.  Sweet deal, but not sure how I feel on the situation just yet, I guess we'll just wait it out and see.  We'll just have to see where life takes me...right?!  hahaha. On that note, I will be getting my resume together this week and attempting to apply for jobs seeing how I need to find out what I'm gonna be doing in this year.  If I happen to find a job that requires me to move, I wanna know this before I sign another fucking lease.  I'm at the point where I think I'll travel anywhere.  Hawaii is looking mighty good once again! I've got friends, I've got connections, and if I have a job...I've got it made! I need to get on the ones and twos though. I've been procrastinating for too long. I've got the degrees, I've got the experience, and god knows I've got the balls. It's just a matter of motivation now.  I'm on it. I'll conquer all and take over.  hehehe. Thats all for now. I need to finish my jack and get off to bed....Rock on everyone.

      Crazy night...well, afternoon into night. We got to Bourban St. around 6 to surprise Dan who thought he was coming in to go to work. Most of us were still hurtin from Great Adventure and the drinking the night before, but we made the most of it! I was already tipsy by the time he got there...Jack on the rocks will do it! Lots of people showed making it a good time yet again.  Ed was trying to get lesbianism going as a tradition at surprise parties....yeah, didn't work. I told myself I wasn't gonna take shots cause I had to drive home...but Dan made me do one of Irish whiskey...really good shit.  I had to cut myself off after that one! Imagine...Sandy cutting herself off...weird shit!  The night just got crazier and everyone got drunker.  Eventually I left with Melissa and Joe cause I'm working a double shift today...Oh Joy!  So now I must be going cause it's off to fabulous Fridays for a day of hell!

      Today was our FABULOUS trip to Great Adventure...and it was fucking awesome.  Not only did we have awesome weather..but a pretty kick ass time!  We headed out early in the am with two car loads...Ed's car had him, Danielle, Joe and Abe...my ride had me, of course, Danielle, Melissa and Sunshine.  Our day started out with us getting busted for having beer in the parking lot...damn rent-a-cops!  The whole day consisted of us fucking up and having a great fucking time...even considering we spent most of the day soaking wet...but that's what the bathing suits were for right?!  We got some sun and had tons of fun and finished up the day by going on the Dare Devil ride...you know the one where they hook you up on this flimsy little cable, drag your ass way up in the air, call out 3 2 1 fly and you pull the cord and just swing... Fucking kick ass!  Deedee and I opted to go with just the two of us and sent Ed, Abe and Joe together after our flight.  I let Deedee be in charge of pulling the cord to release us once we were at the top.  I figured she needed to step up to the plate and do something crazy.  And she definately stepped up! She did not let me down, and let me just say that, that ride is so awesome!  Everytime I go to Great Adventure, I'm gonna go on it!  It was the perfect ending to a great day there.  Once we all got off, we all smoked a cig...like we just had the most amazing sex!haha.  The rush was amazing...i would rate it second to sky diving.  That inital plunge was just wicked hot!  Eventually we made it back to Smack-n-crack...around 11, and the plans for more festivities began.  We all went home and showered and went out for more fun.  First stop...Lazy Lanigans.  Melissa,Joe, Danielle, Sunshine, Alfred and Angelo were all in attendance...then the party dispersed at last call to pick up Joe B from work and continue on to Biagios.  And let me just say that whenever we go in there, we know the majority of the bar!  Sometimes it's a good thing and sometimes it can be a bad thing.  Tonight showed only good though.  A couple of people from our group got trashed and at last call yet again we dispersed to find other destinations. Unfortuantely after the overproductive day I had, I returned home to my beer to relax.  I've got many things to do tomorrow and could use some sleep.  More productive-ness and more festivities tomorrow...hehe...I'm pretty much guessing that the partyin' is never gonna stop!  It's gonna be long kick ass summer! I'm outtie till tomorrow! g'nite.

This evenings minor festivities consisted of drunkin' bowling...I actually won a game..once again, I ROCK! I never win...but tonight...all me!

Lots of shit to do, followed by my favorite place to be...fucking Fridays :) Got most of my crews coming in tomorrow so it should show to be amusing, especially after Wed.'s fucking up!

      The night began with Danielle, Joe, Natalia, and myself running around to gather things for the surprise party.  We arrived at A's to set up and start the drinking. Slowly but surely everyone arrived  including some people I wasn't expecting to see...but were still much welcomed...and then the big dumb animal better known as Jeff fucked up the surprise aspect of the party.  Bastard child!  But the party went on anyway.  And let me just say it was one big wild fucking party!  Where do we begin?  Perhaps when girls were laying on the bar getting body shots done...or maybe when the drunken twister competition began...or maybe when a bunch of girls were hooking up with each other and lets not forget all the exposed titties and piercings!  Lesibianism was furiously rampant!  And yes there are pictures...they will be developed tomorrow...hehe. And yes I was involved in the body shot time...can't blame me right? My girlfriend also decided to cheat on me...that bitch...haha.  She is now dead in my eyes...or as long as i feel this funny saga should continue...ha.  The night at the bar of course ended up with pukey smurfs in the bathroom, next to more girls making out.  The party was then divided and we moved out.  Most of the furiously drunk people were carted to the diner to help relieve the alcohol poisoning that we believe a couple of un-named people had!  And a couple of us went over to Danielle's to continue drinking and fucking up!  A game of Kings followed by even more retarded twister!  Let's just say the evening ended up going on into the wee hours of the morning and I didn't get a chance to sleep unitl like 7:30 in the morning!  All in all...fucking night rocked!  Currently Melissa, Joe and myself are going to indulge in some fabulous Chinese food and then we're off yet again...fun fun:)

      yeah so sneaky sneaky things are going on today...hehe, i'm sure i'll have some info on it later tonight.  Saw Shrek last night...good movie! Wrapped up the evening at the roach house for some snacks, came home and passed the fuck out.  But i can now say that for one night...(just the night since I was drinking way early in the day) I did not drink at all! Rock on for me! The hangover was rough...but we're doin' good today...can't promise anything for this evening..hehe. Ok..production time..so peace

      The weather showed to be shitty and I got a big fat denial on the surfing and the fishing.  It's all good.  So change of plans.  Good times....It all began with Fridays. Picked up a few things shopping and stopped in to get Melissa from work.  Jack Daniels was in attendance.  Home to sober for the nights activities...coffee.  Shower and regroup.  Abe arrives and the night begins. First stop...Bourban Street.  Hung out with Renee got somethin' to eat and of course drink.  Sunshine arrives.  Deedee offically craps out cause she was out with Mommy and had to go to work in the am...Party pooper.  Next stop...Satin Dolls. Morton's crew arrives.  Continued to get ridiciously drunk.  Bonus...the girls bathroom is with the dancers dressing room...I got the best show out of everyone...hehehe.  Lap dances, pictures, more drinking and we were off again. Third stop...Pearl River.  Things are getting drunker as we go.  Jammed at the Hotel for a while...met up with Hippie and friends.  Linda arrives.  More drinking.  Fourth stop...Took the party to Hippies house for 5am bbq.  Bad.  Beer and grills are bad...but it was fun!  I remember falling over onto the house from just standing still.  Yeah bad.  Party continued until the sun started coming up. I remember talkin' to Hippie's girlfriend on his cell and saying some bad things...but hey I was drunk and they told me what to say...so whatever.  I probably have a death wish now..hehe. The party dispersed and I went on to location number five.  An undisclosed location where I continued to be a fucking mess and passed out.  Next thing I remember is waking up with a banging fucking head ache and reeking of jack.  Got back home not too long ago at like 4pm.  I missed the jam I was supposed to be at at Michaels house with the other crew.  I was supposed to be productive today and get shit done...yeah didn't happen.  But I am going to go see Shrek 2 today with Abe and god knows who else...so i will actually get something accomplished!  I'm shakey and badly hungover, but it was all worth it!  I cannot, I repeat CANNOT drink today...I need some serious recovery time.  Tomorrow will party again...hehehe.

So we made some decent money...as usual!  Tomorrow is the bar meeting/clean-up which should show to be productive...hahaha yeah right! It's gonna be long day none the less! My next couple of days off should show to be interesting....as long as the weather holds out.  Monday...dont' know yet...Tues.  Beach and possibly fishing...Wed. Medieval times but not before pre-gaming...hehe, and the count down till Aruba is getting smaller!!!!! I recieved my passport...so I'm all set to go!!!! Spooge aka Kris...is gonna be going to the Dominican Reb. this  Sept.  which he is very excited about...I tried to get a student teaching job to go along with him...but they have enough teachers...so it's all good, and I will be partyin' it up for another year here in Hackensack!!!!! I'm gonna be movin' in with the girls in Sept.  We are planning on building a fabulous bar...which might be so lovely accentuated by parts of the TGIF bar....in our living room...it's gonna be good year!

      The weekend was interesting...work as usual.  Monday morning I was supposed to go collect marine life for the highschool kids...but it just so happened that I got up a little late and missed low tide...oh darn! In the evening I went out with someone I had met to get some dinner followed by a couple of drinks...very very very good time!!!! Tues. I opted to tell my proffessor that I was working so I could go to the beach and fishing.  Unfortuately the weather in Jersey was not looking as good as I had expected...so instead Sunshine and I traveled out to the Hamptons in LI. The weather was a little overcast, but no rain...so it was all good!  I got to run around on the beach and collect some shells...very pleased at that! We hung around in town, did a little site seeing, shopping, and got some cocktails.  We retreated back to the ultimately fabulous summer house to grill some steaks and make dinner...but not before hanging out in the hot tub and taking a dip in the pool. The hot tub felt sooooooooo good...I needed that stress relief!  We stayed out there till almost 1am and decided to travel back seeing how the weather was about to get a whole lot worse...and wasn't looking to be getting much better towards home.  So finally we get back here and I'm thinking yes...I can go pass out and finally get some sleep since I was exhausted!  But no!!!!!!  As I walk up to my apt. door i'm meeted by Melissa throwing a phone at me while frantically searching for my car keys to steal my car.  -she was unaware that I had them on me..hehehe- So I get up on the phone and find out that a certain someone has gotten himself arrested...fabulous!!!! His sidekick is the one on the phone telling me he's walking to the Hillsdale Police Dept. after the cops had confiscated the car.  Lovely.  So now I regroup and plan to head back out to pick up these two idiots out in Hillsdale.  I find one drunken momo chit chatting with the cop at the front desk while the other one is being delt with.  Needless to say...after some time they were released into my custody and we finally made the trek home.  I was good and didn't beat their asses at the police station...only because I was too tired to do so.  But the next time I see them...I will be kicking asses and taking names!!! Surprisingly enough...the arrest wasn't for drugs!!!! Finally, someone from the crew has a drugless arrest!!!! Yay!  So after not nearly enough sleep...I had to get up and go out to collect more marine life...not pleased!  Then ran through the lab...set everything up..and tried to come back home to relax. Denied yet again!  Today was Melissa's court date...which I had forgotten...so instead of getting some sleep, I took the fastest shower of my life and ran out to court with her.  She did very well in court...let's just say that...and found out some more interesting information about her case...let's just say that there are lies about. We then regrouped again...got a little shopping done and now I have my 5 minutes of sitting still.                             Ok, that's over...now I'm running out to dinner...should show to be a fun night...followed by another morning of getting up way to damn early to play scientist again.

      Soooooooooooooo....Sat. was interesting!&nbsp; Not only did friday's look like the circus unloaded...it felt like it!&nbsp;&nbsp; I opted to take on service bar by myself since no one was scheduled.&nbsp; Interesting time...I was at the point where I was going to kill some of the dubs....but I managed.&nbsp; I finally got an outfit for the wedding in Aruba thanks to Leslie this morning...I can not tell you how greatful I am!!!! I could not find shit...but one day out with Leslie and I'm done...all I need are shoes now!&nbsp; Awesome!&nbsp; The countdown is now down to 25 days! I'm getting excited!!!!! hehehehe.  Anyways, I got my ass handed to me mulitple times this evening...but I was able to handle it...A little more than can be said about Friday evening!  Yeah, speaking of which, I believe Manny is gonna be in for a little surprise when he finally hears what went on...on friday night.  Lets' just say the resturant and staff were not satisfied with the service bar that night.  I could care less...but i'm sure i'm gonna catch heat for not saying anything. It's all good. Tomorrow is Sunday and I got lots of "my peoples" coming in...so we should definately make bank!  It's gonna be good time none the less!  I also get to meet the new..."hopefully" landlord tomorrow.  I need to look decent and like an upstanding person....hahahaa....fat chance!  We'll see what happens!  For now, I need to put the Jack down and get to sleep!  So peace out till then...

      Yesterday was soooooooooooooooooo awesome!&nbsp; The weather was spectacular and Abe and I drove down to the beach.&nbsp; We decided to jam at Point Pleasant for the day.&nbsp; The water was soooooooo rough...but of course we went in anyway! I lost the bottom of my bathing suit coming out, but luckily got it back up in time for none of the little kids on the shore to see my stuff! Jellyfish were rampant so we had to shower off after our dip.&nbsp; And let me just say that when I finally got home I had to shower twice to make sure all the jellyfish pieces were out of my hair!&nbsp; I made a quick stop in Bayonne to see Mommy cause she had presents for me! YAY!&nbsp; Abe got to meet my mother...which i'm sure was a trip for him!&nbsp; After our fabulous day we went over to Ed, Dan, Melissa and King's house for poker night.&nbsp; I was supposed to be Abe's lucky charm... but he fucked up and ended up out of the game later on! Neener! The night ended with a late night trip to Biagios for some cocktails...good shit.&nbsp; Today I got the pleasing news....at fucking 7:30 in the am...from my Proff.&nbsp; telling me that class was canceled today!&nbsp; I was gonna go back to the beach, but instead decided to go back to bed...which was much needed.&nbsp; Now i'm doin some laundry and getting ready to go out for another festive night!&nbsp; Gotta get the partyin' out now...cause tomorrow starts a long weekend of work...oh joy!&nbsp; It's ok though, cause&nbsp; next week is yet another trip to the beach with joe, melissa and who else knows!&nbsp; Good times!&nbsp; Ok, so for now i'm outtie!

      Ok so let's start with Wed.&nbsp; Wed morning Sunshine and I decided to bust down the shore for a day of fun. I wasn't feeling my greatest since we had drank ourselves retarded the night before...but hey it's all good.&nbsp; The weather turned out to be AMAZING, and we both passed out on the beach, needless to say, I have some very interesting tan lines! Played around in the ocean for a while and then jammed on the boardwalk, that's when the toothache set in bad.&nbsp; The orajel from 711 only helped for a little while...and then it got reallllllllllll bad.&nbsp; So Sunshine was a sweetheart and found me a dentist who would see me in the area for an "emergency."&nbsp; We mazeled out, and the dentist ended up giving me a prescription for an antibiotic and some Vicidan(SWEET!!!!)!&nbsp; We got it filled so I could function properly and then went off to try and go fishing.&nbsp; In the process we found out that a tornado...yes,&nbsp;a tornado was rolling into our area, so the fishing idea got a little canceled.&nbsp; It's ok, we're planning another trip for a later date.&nbsp; So when the rain, hail, wind, lightening and thundering subsided, we went back out to the boardwalk to fuck around and play games. Good times.&nbsp; We ended up at the Beachcomber to get something to eat and drink....of course!&nbsp; There was band playing so we stayed for a while to jam out.&nbsp; Since I was taking lovely painkillers the beers were fabulous! We decided in the mist of all this to stay and crash at my mommy's beach house and head out in the morning for more festivites for my birthday.&nbsp; Overall, with the exception of my pounding toothache, the day was absoultely fabulous!&nbsp; The beginning to a great birthday!&nbsp; In the am we headed out back to Smack-n-crack to meet up with the other fuck-ups to go paintballing.&nbsp; I took some more painkiller and we were off yet again.&nbsp; Paintballin' with that group was sooooooooooooooooooo much fun! We gotta do that more often!&nbsp; I kicked ass...that's all I gotta say! I fucked everyone up! I ended up with the least amount of battle wounds...which just shows I was awesome! hahaha. Melissa got the worst damage out of all of us.&nbsp; That bitch got hit twice in the tit, which resulted in the only scar!!!!! I'm currently quite sore....as the rest of us...cause we were doing commando moves and getting really into it!&nbsp; We all came home, regrouped, got some dinner and went out to the bar.&nbsp; Once again, I had taken more pain pills so the alcohol was fabulous! The rest of the night was good shit with all of us fucking up....oh yes, I will have pictures to show!!! Waking up today was rough.&nbsp; Between the soreness of paintballin' along with the drinking made the beginning of today rough.&nbsp; The rest of the night went smooth.&nbsp; The bar wasn't that busy, we still made some good money and I got lots of birthday wishes, cards and presents!&nbsp; Now I must be getting to bed cause I got a bar meeting in the am...but all I have to say is that this birthday kicked so much more ass than the last one and that they can only get better as they come!!! I'd like to thank everyone for everything! I had such a kick ass week!!!!!! You guys fucking ROCK! The summer is only going to get better from here on in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      So it's one more day till my birthday!!!! YAY! Last night was fun...the B-town, Buddaville girls and myself met up in Edgewater to grab some drinks and bullshit.  God I miss those girls! I miss hanging out with them all the time.  We get along no matter what! I feel bad that i'm always busy and running around, and we really never get together anymore...but I understand as well as they do, that we're all busy and we're all trying to find our place in the world.  We'll have to just make time for each other.  Today I've been a bum...because I can! I'm actually thinking of drivin' down the shore in a little while.  I could use some shore relaxin' time. I was supposed to go out with some people tonight...but i'm not feeling it right now.  I think I'd rather spend the night at the beach and go fishing tomorrow. I NEED TO GO FISHING! I need to get out on the ocean! Wed. night I'm sure will be more festivites...so it's all good.  Then of course we have Thurs.!!!!!! It's gonna show to be a good time! I'm just excited to have almost a whole week to do whatever I want.  It's nice.  Ok...so now i'm gonna go pack some shit for the beach...perhaps pick up my surfboard...and be out! So till then....

I gotta make a few phone calls...people I've been meaning to get in touch with....which whom all showed up tonight at the bar! I'm thinking of going down the shore for a few days...the weather is looking shitty, but hey, it's all good, as long as I get to go fishing! Thursday...my birthday....is still up in the air... most people who were supposed to come skydiving either got screwed to work, or just can't make it...so it's all good, we're gonna revamp the plans. I got all summer to skydive...so i'm cool with it. Personally i don't care what we do, as long as it's a good time...hehehe.  So paintballin' seems to be the main focus now..but we'll see how long I plan on stayin down the shore!!!!  Deedee is offically cut off....and written out of the will! She dared to not take off for work for my b-day...after I endured Hoboken for hers!!!! I took off, dealt with unacceptable people...even drove and didn't drink nearly as much as I should have!!!! So she's done! at least for now! She'll have some major ass kissin to do! Cause right now, she has upset me...so WHATEVER!!!!! She better have fun at work...cause she's number one on my shit list right now..yeah, that's right, I said it!!!! Especially after she crapped out on me on Sat.! Well, anyways, now that I've made it clear that Deedee sucks my ass...I need to be getting to sleep cause I have an overproductive day tomorrow.  Peace!

      I had to deal with the highschool kids again all day yesterday. Not so much fun...but it's ok.  Later that night we went to Hoboken to see FLF play...and let me just say, they kick ass! They put on an awesome show. I ran into a few people I haven't seen in a while, which was cool, then we were off again! We ended up at Biagios were I proceeded to get smashed! So now I'm badly hungover and I need to get productive yet again!  I gotta stop at the hated mall and get some CFM's for work. Then it's to the bar for more exciting nights at TGIF.  I have to drive to Bayonne tonight cause the fam and I are going to Penslytucky early in the morning.  Should show to be interesting. At least I have a day off!!! Well I need to get my as in gear...so peace!

      So this week has been so far very interesting...Monday I worked in the morning...and planned not to go out at night.  I needed a night off, but no...a group of us took a trip to Houlihans for dinner.  Alfred and Dan met up with us around dessert...we had a few drinks and called it a night.  Definately a relaxing night.  I finally got to see the rest of Harry Potter too! So now we have to go see the third one. Tuesday morning I got ripped from my joyous sleep to go to work for Leslie.  Seems her car broke down.  I wasn't pleased, but I still made money. That night we attempted to travel out to Roxbury for their bar competition.  We got a flat tire half way there! It felt like we were going to be killed by an 18 wheeler...interesting time!!! Anyways, some road guy came and saved us from the trucks and fixed our tire and we were off!  The bar comp. was fun and let me just say they have a kick ass bar!!!! I want one! We had a good time and saw sooooooo many beautiful people...hehehe.  We journeyed back towards home and stopped off at a diner to get some late night snacks.  This now brings us to today....I decided not to go in and play with the highschool kids...I just wasn't up to it! So now i'm cleaning up around the apt before I have to go to work yet again.  Tomorrow will be a productive day! Gotta go to FDU and then we're going to Hoboken to see FLF play.  Should show to be a good time.  And there are 8 more days till my birthday!!!!! Skydiving here we come! Until next time....

      Once again it's Sunday...but it's the 4th so it's ok!!! That means 11 more days till my birthday!!!!!! I'm excited!!!! Especially since we're going skydiving!!!! This weekend has been interesting. It was slow, but interesting.  Friday night Cormac, Melissa and I chilled at my apt. till like 5 in the morning bullshittin'.  Had a fabulous bar meeting on Sat. followed by massive productivity.  Had to pick up Danielle from the car rental place...and she brought me a present!!! So she's finally back from vaca. YaY! We also decided that our bar comp. is gonna be a Hawaiian theme, so most of the night of Sat. Ed, Lisa and I were coming up with ideas of things to do and stuff to break!  If things work out, its gonna be a funny fucking bar comp.!!!  They tried to move the date till late Aug. but since I'm going to compete and I'm gonna be in Aruba...we're gonna have it earlier! Made me feel special...hahaha. The bar got busy towards the end and we got to make some money...let's just hope tonight goes the same! After work we decided to make a stop at the Roachhouse for some food.  Ran into Christian, Jen, and Siarra, all stoned.  Funny shit.  Deedee and her date were also in attendance. He seemed like a cool guy...we'll have to see where this one goes!  Abe was his usual funny self...only now I wish I could remember the things he was saying...hahaha.  All I can remember is the one about the triangle of terror!!!!!  Anyways...I need to be getting productive...got things to do!

      So we ventured out into Hoboken to see our friends punk band play...but we were too late...fucking King!!!!! It's all good.  I got reminded that Dom (lead singer)'s brother is in Thursday...I completely forgot!!!! I always run into him no matter where I go!  I still remember runnin' into him at last years warped tour!  He always yells at me cause I always miss his band play...and they kick ass! That's what upsets me.  His band kicks ass and I always manage to miss them! I gotta stop fuckin up!!!! Anyways..I got molested and kissed on the head by some drunken guy at Maxwells..and who came to save me....not ABE!!!!! that bastard!  He just sat by and laughed his ass off! hahahaha. It's all good, I'll get him back!  So now I'm fucked up and I need to be sleepin' another productive day tomorrow! Money to be made!!!! peace till then!

And there is gonna be a third one!!!!! Very very excited! Anyways, I was so wiped out from the day with the children, then the fair and the movie that I came home and passed out! Yeah, needless to say I was late for work! The good part is that I didn't get in trouble!!!! yeah, I kick ass! After work I decided to get productive with Melissa and get some shit for the apt. and then she cooked me dinner! Imagine....I don't have to cook dinner all the time...soooooooooo fabulous! The rest of the night was a "Sandy" night, where we were bums!  We constructed a Pepito 2....and watched the first Harry Potter and half of the second.  I've been getting yelled at cause i'm not up to par with the Potter movies!  Today was another early day.  Got to jam with the high school kids again.  Only this time, I got to go out into the field and get disgusting.  I was covered in nasty Hackensack mud...GROSS!  But now i'm home and about to get up in the shower to get refreshed.  Then it's off to festivities again!  I've taken two days off from drinking so, I feel it's time yet again! hahahahaha.  Not sure what the plans are, but i'm sure we'll figure something out! till next time....

      Tuesday was such an AWESOME day!!!! The day started out by Melissa Joe and myself gettin up early to drive down the shore.  We spent the day out on the beach at Sleezside.  The weather was beautiful and the ocean was even better!!!! No jellyfish and lots of shells!  Sunshine met up with us down there in the afternoon with enough time to check out the beach scene.  We played around on the boardwalk for a little while...along with some lunch/dinner and beers.  Then It was time for fishing!!!! We stocked up on beer and headed out to Point Pleasant to go bluefishing on the Norma K III.  Fishing was so fucking awesome.  BLOODBATH!!!! And yes, we deflowered Melissa, this was her first time fishing!  The two of us put ourself into the fishing pool before we headed out to sea.  Needless to say the two girls on the boat kicked all the guys asses and won the pool!!!!!Yeah that's right we fucking kick ass! Our fish was almost 11lbs.!!!!  Covered in scales and fish guts we got something to eat and headed home for much needed sleep.  We got back to Hackensack around 4-something in the am, showered and passed out.  One of the best night's sleep in a long time! Now today, I opted to not go to FDU and sleep instead!!! But it's ok...I'll be there tomorrow.  Tonight we are going to Medieval Times, but not before going to the Whiskey Cafe to pregame for a while.  I am finally getting to go to Medieval Times!!! I'm very excited.  For one day of my life...I will be a god damn princess!!!  I'm sure this day is only gonna get better!!! We'll just have to see what happens!
