            *  UPDATED  *   WITH RESPONSES RECEIVED FROM ION ON JUNE 22, 2004!!  THIS LADY IS TRULY A GEM THAT APPRECIATES HER FANS.  SIX HANDWRITTEN PAGES OF RESPONSES TO  YOUR  QUESTIONS!   Finally compiled and sent out the list of questions for Ion.  Hopefully she'll have the time to answer them while she's FILMING EPISODES FOR SEASON TWO OF THE L WORD!  ;-P  Actually we dont know that this is the case but we're hopeful.  Thanks to the "Candygirls" for helping to come up with an outstanding set of questions, and a SPECIAL thanks to PRicanesq, Sistah4U, Mo and Storm for their valued input during the selection/editing process.        Ion Overman Questionnaire    1.	Are you currently working on any TV project or films other than “The L-Word” [“TLW”]?  Not at the moment   2.	If you were not an actor, what would you be doing?  I probably would have moved to New York and gotten a job with a fashion magazine.  Something that would allow me to shop, travel and play with make-up.   3.	Since your college major was English Literature, who is your favorite author and/or favorite book?  I have so many favorites, I can’t pick one.  However, one of my favorite books in high school was The Stranger by Albert Camus.   4.	You have become an instant success and a role model for all women, particularly women of color.  What advice would you give to those women of color who would like to break into the industry?  Assuming the person has talent, the most important thing is hunger.  You have to want it so badly, you can’t breathe.  All the stories you’ve heard about the emotional and financial stress and rejection are true.  But if you put your mind over matter and commit 150%, you have a shot.   5.	What was it about acting that made you decide to pursue it as a career, and what is the most rewarding experience you have had as an actor?  I’ve always been a loner and a bit of an introvert.  I love acting because it’s a way to be an extrovert for a short period of time, without really revealing anything about myself.  Also if I can successfully pretend to be another person, it validates what I like to believe is my understanding of human behavior.  The most rewarding experience as an actor is always having someone tell you that something you did on screen has affected him or her.  I love acting so much, I have a blast whenever I’m working.  And when someone is moved by something I’ve done, it’s a responsibility on one hand, but for me it’s the biggest thrill.    6.	Do you have a daily\weekly exercise regimen? If so, what does it consist of?  I actually hate working out.  I do it because I have to, but I should be more consistent.  However, right now I do about 45 min of jog\walking in my neighborhood, followed by about 30min of lunges, squats, sit-ups etc.  When I’m feeling really crazy, I’ll do pilates.  I do all of this in various combinations about 4 or 5 times a week.   7.	Your skin and hair are absolutely beautiful.  What is you beauty regimen? What are your favorite beauty products?  A gentle fragrance-free cleanser.  Prescription Differin cream at night.  In the morning I use an antioxidant by Epicuran called Alpha Lipoic Omega Complex, and of course sunscreen.  On my hair I use modern organic products (M.O.P.).  First I spray on their styling tonic (on wet hair), then big blobs of their leave-in conditioner and light hold gel.  Then dry with a diffuser.   8.	Other than collecting antique furniture, what other hobbies do you have?  I love to watch movies.  I go to the movies pretty much every week, and Turner Classic Movies is my favorite channel.  Also I love to shop, read fiction, hang out with friends and cook.   9.	What is your favorite film and why?  As with books, there are so many I can’t pick one.  But some of them are:  - The Man Who Came To Dinner - Sunset Blvd - All About Eve - Dark Victory - A Place in the Sun - A Streetcar Named Desire - Grease - Last Tango in Paris - Breakfast at Tiffany’s - Like Water for Chocolate - Godfather 1 & 2 - Pulp Fiction - Kalifornia - The Age of Innocence and tons more.  There are lots of reasons why a film becomes one of my favorites, but usually it’s the performances.  I love watching other actors.   10.	What is your ethnic background? What is your family like?  My mother is Black with a little American Indian (Sioux and Cherokee), and my father is a blond haired, blue-eyed Englishman.  I’m an only child, and my parents and I are close.   11.	Are you single, engaged or married?  Not married, but my boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years.   12.	What kind of animals do you have, if any? What are their names?  I have a fish named Sushi (trust me, he doesn’t mind), and I have shared custody of my parents’ Golden Retriever.  He’s 8 yrs old and his name is Bogie.   13.	What types of music do you like? Who are your favorite performers?  I love classical and Jazz (esp. Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Ella, Louis and Billie).  I also love Frank Sinatra.  I also love contemporary R&B and Hip-Hop like Jill Scott, Alicia Keys, Lauren Hill, Snoop, Ja Rule.  I also love Motown and the Beatles.  Again, too much to name.   14.	What year were you born?  Now, now, I do declare Miss  {webmistress' last name} .  You know it is impolite to ask a lady her age.   15.	Regarding your character in “The L-Word”, how are you like Candace and how do you differ?  Moreover, what do you feel is the most important aspect of her presence on the show?  Well our differences are superficial ones, such as occupation and sexual orientation.  But I think we are similar in determination and belief in ourselves.  Also in being true to ourselves.  I think Candace showed us that even strong women are human and can be ruled by their emotions.  That combination of strength and vulnerability is part of what makes us complex and interesting.   16.	How does it feel to know that after playing the role of Candace, so many women are attracted to you?  How does it feel to be a “lesbian sex symbol”?  I had no idea I was a “lesbian sex symbol” until I read the question.  But I am incredibly flattered.  Thank you.   17.	As Candace, your ex-girlfriend (Yolanda), your carpenter crew and the young lady introduced as Mikela were all women of color.  Did you have any say in this or to your knowledge, was this done intentionally/unintentionally by the producers?  I had absolutely no say in it, and I don’t know what the producers meant by it – if anything.   18.	“New York Post: The L Word - Gay ‘Sex and the City” By DANIEL RENZI Beals was so upset by Bette’s unfaithfulness towards Tina, she took out her frustration on the actress playing the part of the other woman. "That was incredibly distressing," (Beals) said gravely. "I couldn’t be with her on the set for a couple of days. I couldn’t talk to her. I would just look at her like, ‘You’re breaking us up!’"  Did Jennifer Beals really act this way or was she just kidding?  What is your reaction to her comments?  If you will, please tell us about your experience working with Jennifer Beals [“JB”]?  Until this Questionnaire I wasn’t aware of the article.  I don’t know if she was kidding or not.  But if she really did feel that way, I didn’t know it.  She was professional and we got our work done.   19.	The chemistry and sex scenes between you and JB were phenomenal!  Are the creators of the show aware of this?  Further, how did you feel about performing those scenes?   While we were shooting, the Powers that Be told us that it was working, and that they were pleased.  I was grateful for the challenge of performing the scenes.  I had never had a sex scene with a woman before, so as an actor I was determined to make people believe me.   20.	Of your fellow actors on The L Word, with whom did you spend more time with outside of the set?  I didn’t hang out with anyone off the set.  I did a lot of sightseeing, shopping and reading while I was in Vancouver.   21.	Are you aware of the negative responses towards you as "the other woman"? If so, how do you feel about that and would it have any effect on your return to TLW?  I wasn’t aware of the negative responses.  But I take it as a compliment.  It means I did my job.   No, that would have no effect on my return to the show.   22.	Since it seems a lot of people feel you really nailed the body language of a more tomboyish or butch lesbian, can you tell us if there is anything or anyone that you drew specific inspiration from, in your portrayal of Candace’s presence and mannerisms?  The first thing I did was think like a man.  And one day on the set, I asked one of the male crew members to walk back and forth for me so I could study his gait.  That was helpful.  It helped me get a grip on my center of gravity.   23.	To your knowledge, will Candace return next season and for how many episodes?  If so, can you share the direction in which the show plans to take the Candace character and/or in what direction would you like to see the character go?  I don’t know if Candace is coming back.  I haven’t been contacted.  I don’t know what Candace’s place could be since she has caused so much turmoil.  But I suppose anything could happen.   24.	What were your immediate thoughts and comments when you saw the website for the first time and have you shared it with any friends and\or family?  Well, I was and continue to be humbled, thrilled and grateful.  Yes, I’ve told everyone I know about it.   25.	Anything else you would like to tell us?  I’d like to thank everyone again for visiting the site.  I’m so glad you enjoy the show, and I hope these answers are satisfactory.       Thank you for your time and cooperation!
