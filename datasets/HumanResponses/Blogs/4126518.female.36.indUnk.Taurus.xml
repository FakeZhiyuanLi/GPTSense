       It feels like fall is arriving a little early this year.  I cannot believe that we are having such mild temps in August.  This is usually the hottest month we have here in Tennessee.  I will stop sounding like I am shocked and just be happy that it is so pleasant :).      I actually have all of our windows open, too, and can feel a wonderful breeze going through the house.      I tried really hard to get the boys outside today.  We went out for "maybe" 30 minutes this morning.  Thirty whole minutes!  I took Pixie out and tied her down to her little tie out thing and she was going nuts trying to get to me.  It was so funny to watch.  I had planned to just sit outside and work on my blanket, but ended up digging up weeds instead.      During our thirty minutes out there, a huge black cloud came up and really cooled things down.  After I had dug out all of the weeds that I was planning to pull, I let everyone come in.  It was lunch time anyways and Pixie was so much happier :).      Going to buy some groceries tomorrow.  Woohoo!  I absolutely hate going to the grocery store!  Hate it, hate it, hate it!!!  But we do need to eat and since we are scrapping the bottom of the barrel, we really need to get some more food.  However, I do know that whatever we manage to buy will have to last us for about three full weeks until Tim's next pay check.  Stretching out the food yet again.  It never ends and I feel like no matter how much we struggle we are never going to see that light at the end of the tunnel.      On top of having to buy groceries, we also have to buy the kids shoes, clothes and supplies for school.  UGH!!  I really wish our school district would get on the bandwagon with sending out the school supply list early.  Shoot, I would settle for having them mail them out to us a week or so before school starts.  But will they do that??  NO WAY!!!  We will not get our supply lists until the first day of school and then will get the lucky job of having to fight everyone else for what supplies we need.  As if having to buy all of these supplies is stressful enough esp with our finances, lets throw in a crowd of people fighting over left overs.

       I have a little bragging to do today. I weighed in (actually yesterday) and discovered that I have lost 4 whole pounds. Again, "Yay for me"!      I have always been someone that struggles with my weight. My hubby and I have decided that we are ready to start doing whatever we can to lose some much needed weight. All we have done so far is to cut back A LOT on what we eat. Since February when his position changed at work, he is now home every evening, so we started eating a lot more; mainly sweets. So, we have cut them out and only allow ourselves something sweet (only in moderation) over the weekend. Aside from cutting out the sweets, I have been drinking green tea (which is said to increase your energy levels), a lot more water and not drinking as much caffeine, and cutting way back on the amount of food that I am eating. I eat mostly chicken for my dinner every day, but will only eat half of a piece and save the other half for lunch the next day. As for veggies, well, I have these plastic serving utensils that I use to scoop out food onto everyone's plate and I will only make one scoop (sometimes not even a whole one) for my plate.      Tim, on the other hand, has just about stopped eating. I worry about him starving himself like that. He is basically eating a few crackers while he is at work and then eating whatever I serve to him for dinner. That is it! Doesn't sound too healthy to me, but I think he is just trying to get his stomach to shrink a little.      Haven't done any exercising, yet. It is my plan to start trying to do a workout every day once school starts back up for the kids. However, I have no idea (right now) how I am going to manage this since the only vcrs we have are all in bedrooms. Needless to say, our bedroom is way to crowded (with JUNK) to attempt doing a workout in there. So that leaves me having to use one of the kids' rooms for my workout. Guess we shall see how that turns out. Of course, I could try to sell my vhs tapes and try to get some workouts on dvd. Hmmmm, that is a thought.

        Believe it or not, we are now having some cooler weather here in Tennessee. We had some rain yesterday and last night and today it is SOOO gorgeous out there. Still looks like the bottom is going to drop at any time, though. I have even heard that we will be having lows this weekend in the 50s. Awww, sounds so pleasant. I can't wait to be able to sleep with the windows open :).   I have still been playing around with the codes today. I added the Weather Pixie today ;). Trying really hard to figure out how to do a calendar in here, but haven't been able to figure that one out yet. Have come across a couple of codes, but none of them were exactly what I was wanting :(.  Still trudging along on this last blanket. I think out of the three, I like this one the best :P. It is going to look so pretty when it is finally done.  Tim is not going to have to work this weekend "Yay". Well, I say, "Yay", but I think he is feeling a little disgusted because he has had problems with the things that they were going to be making LIVE this weekend. Could not get any technical help with any of it either, so they are putting it off until September 11th and when I hear that date, I have to say, "Mmmm" or let out a big sigh.  Took the boys to the library today. They weren't too sure if they wanted to go, though. I checked out two chapter books for Taylor, a couple of easy readers for Jacob and Phillip got a Yugioh (sp) book with codes and what not for the game.  I looked for the 5th Harry Potter book, but they didn't have it. I did see one book for Toxic People and how to deal with the ones in your life and another book called Friendshifts. I didn't check either of them out because they look SOOO long and I was really wanting HP (haha). Maybe next time....

       Sorry that it has been a few days since I posted. I have been playing around with the coding and figured out how to add buttons. So, "Yay for me"! I am also very slowly learning how to change the color of things in here to be more of what I like. Just bear with me :).  I have now completed two of the baby blankets and am working on the third one. I started the third one yesterday, but did not like how it was coming out. I ended up having to go dig out another blanket I made in this same pattern just so I could try to determine how the pattern should go and then restarting the blanket again. I am so much happier with this pattern than the one that I was trying to do.  I sent out the newsletter a little earlier. I have even collected several articles that I can use in future newsletters. Now I just need some sponsors to sponsor a contest for us again.

         I finished the first blanket out of the three blanket order and started to work on the next one. I would say that I am over a 1/4 of the way done with it already ;). I have received the info (specifics) for another blanket, but haven't actually received payment yet, so I guess we will wait and see about that one.      I found a couple of bookmark patterns that I really like. I hope to start on one of them really soon. I also came across a pattern for a scrunchy that I think I can manipulate to be a keychain.      Still trying to learn how to add things in here. I hope to have some buttons added soon, but I am not that great with HTML so you will have to bear with me. It is something that I might play around with over the weekend while Tim is gone. He is leaving for Florida in the morning, flying down, staying the night and driving back on Sunday. Should make for a long weekend.

        The weather has been a bit gloomy today. We had some storms roll through in the middle of the night and I guess the gloominess decided to stick around. It feels wonderful out there with a nice breeze and no humidity at all, but just gray skies. Ick!      On a good note, I have finished up the first blanket out of my three blanket order that I received over the weekend. I hope to start on the second blanket tomorrow.      Another good note is that I have been contacted about another blanket. Yay! I am just floored by these orders all of a sudden. I think it is the Lord's way of blessing me with things to do since school is about to start back. I have been dreading school starting because I, again, will be all alone with time to think and dwell (which is never good) and now I am getting blanket orders and I am about to be really involved with things in two groups that I belong to. One group is Crochetville  urlLink  (http://p084.ezboard.com/bcrochetville  ) and I will be helping out with a yarn swap :). The other group is Middle Tennessee Moms ( urlLink http://p072.ezboard.com/bmiddletennesseemoms ) where I am going to help out with running some events within the group. I am so excited!

       Spent some time today working on the newsletter and got it sent out by 8:30. That is a big deal for me because it usually takes me a couple of hours to finish up the newsletter and then get it sent out. I had the newsletter out this morning by the time I am usually getting online. So, "Yay" for me ;).      I have an order for three blankets that came in this past weekend that I am currently working on. I worked for a couple of hours on one of the blankets earlier this morning. Should have it completed no later than this weekend.

       I have just created this blog and am still in the process of learning my way around.  I hope to post current crochet projects that I am working on as well as events that I am participating in.
