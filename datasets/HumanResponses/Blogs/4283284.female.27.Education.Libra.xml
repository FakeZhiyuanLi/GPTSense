      The weather today has been just sublime, blissful.  Unfortunately I’m inside reading about animal cruelty.  What I would love to do right now is take a nap in a bed with freshly starched sheets next to a huge window, blinds open, and opened just enough to allow the soft breeze to cover my face.  There’s nothing more peaceful and luxurious than napping in the sun.  (It’s more comfortable inside because a) you don’t get suburnt and b) beds are more comfortable than grass.  The temperature is also more consistent.)  A quick internet search on the topic revealed many photos of cats and various other pets sleeping in the sun.  It seems they have something on us here.    A well known ode to sleep is the Beatles’ fabulous song  urlLink I’m Only Sleeping .

      This blog is today dedicated to the memory of  urlLink Dan Quisenberry , whose existence was brought to my attention only last night.  He played baseball AND wrote poetry – a novel combination of talents.  I suspect he made more money from baseball than from poems, but of course this is not important.  I also make more money from administering PhD’s than writing one, but cling to the hope that financial value is not the only kind there is.    Of course I also hope that the thesis I’m writing has value of any kind.  I’ve been worrying that it doesn’t, that it won’t help a single animal, that it is (or will be) a powerless collection of words.  (Words that I still have to write!)  But here is a poem by Quiseberry on the subject of words:   WORDS  don't believe that lie about sticks and stones  words are the strongest weapon under the sun  it's words that start wars, broker the peace  in the beginning was the word and it was God, and still is  and if you use the wrong ones i'll sock you in the nose ram your car  and if you use the right words i will praise you kiss your face and long for your company

      Although I realise the point is not to be a website, but a (we)b*log* of my thoughts and ideas, I thought I'd make the most of my new web presence.  Here is a photo of  urlLink Rita ,and one in her  urlLink red jacket  . People who make perjorative remarks about poodles should stop reading now.  Here is an out-of-focus photo of  urlLink Tully  in the sink. He looks grumpy because he's waiting for me to quit messing about with the camera and turn the tap on. I don't have any other good photos of him at work today.  And here is a photo of  urlLink me  at Jim Jim Falls in the Northern Territory. I'm wearing a hat it took me half a year to make when I was 15. In fact I'm sitting right at the top of the falls, but you can't really tell how far up it is. That's because of the  urlLink fractal  nature of our universe!

        Well it just wouldn't be appropriate now to use a 'first time' metaphor, whether or not it's the most fitting, as it's already been taken - (it wouldn't be the first time for the first time metaphor).        One of the other things which is just not right is not in today. :)    Here is a    urlLink  link      to something else which is incredibly not right, so be warned..  .           I'm afraid there will be many more!
