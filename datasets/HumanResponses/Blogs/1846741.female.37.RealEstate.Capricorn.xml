      Still haven't gotten very far in the planning and execution of the "Get my Life in Order" desire.  I just can't seem to take that next step that will get me where I want to be.  I still weigh the same.  My finances are just as bad.  And getting worse.  I feel drawn to write and to voice over work, but can't bring myself to act on that conviction.  I know what I need to do to make my life work, but am stuck at the same old place.  I want to be the person God created me to be more than anything else.  What do I have to lose right?  I don't like where I am, but it's familar, but I'll never realize my potential if I don't.  HELP!!!!!!!!!!

       Everything seems to be getting worse.  Not only did I get a call last night from the lady who handles one of my credit card accounts, I got a call this morning from my mortgage company.  I don't have the money for this month's payment and the payment I arranged last month to cover the July payment didn't clear.   I have a number for a lawyer to help with getting everything put in my name.  I need to talk to my boss.  They've let me know that they might - maybe- willing to help me out with everything.  Why do I let this happen?  I know what's coming, so why do I let it happen?  I hate this.  I'm intelligent, mature, responsible.  Why do I do this?

       Back once again.   I'm going to change my eating, work, spending and cleaning habits.    Really.  I am.  I've been working at making God the center of my life more the past week and it seems to have helped.  I don't want to be this way anymore.  But I don't want to lose what I like.    I shut down and I don't like that.  I don't want to avoid or delay, but there are some things I don't have a solution for, so I don't know how to face them.    Anyway.   Took my measurements and weighed in today.  Height:   245 pounds Chest:     57.5 inches Waist:     49 inches Hips:       57 inches  I want to take care of myself.  I need to take care of myself.  I just don't think I know how.
