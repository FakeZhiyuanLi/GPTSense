      I have decided to log what happens day 2 day in my life using bad grammer, spelling and a selection of disgusting metaphors for sex. enjoy!  For my first post i will be discussing uni,  heck we all will have to face this big one at some point...if its faceing or running away from like a big girl.  my sis finally got round to getting her act together with it and is off next couple of months...if u dont know much about me or who my sis is let me fill u in so far :-   "My name is Michael james ross, im 17 years of age and hope one day to be 18. I started out ok as a baby i was told, but as i grew into a 4 year old my perants realised that i was the bastard child satan didnt want. so he put me into daycare (planet earth) my toddler activities uncluded escaping playgroup and breaking into cars (True story) and hurting anyone who tried to soically interact with me. this behavour didnt continue you will be glad to hear. i grew alil and finished primary school with quite a brainy and positive attitude. fresh faced i looked forward to secondary education.  Lets just say that it was the worst time ever. The best thing about Secondary school was the fact that suddenly girls grew boobs...alllright! the worst thing about secondary school is once ur in it and through it you realise that the world is a bigger...darker and more confusing place then once thought.  I got through that period of my life with 6 C grades to my name. also a greater understanding of good music and fine girls...i took up Scratch Djing cos it always intrested me...i knew little about it then and the more i learn the more i love. I will do a post on the art of turntablism. music is my bag baby.      the reason i think they wernt As and Bs like my other friends got was because i discovered beer earlier then they did.  I would like to think i know alot about beer and learnt alot through beer. most of lifes problems, questions and triumphs are brought by, thought of and got through by the consumption of some form of alcholic Drink.    I still am yet to learn more about women...its tough when you say inapropreate things around them loudly...but u can bet anyone who is my friend says i am a sucker for a pretty face...    Im currently not doing much at college and getting an assortment of passgrades for it. i aspire to be a photographer and currently in the process of finishing a Twisted first portpholio for u guys to bear witness too. photography is another love of my life, it is also a common ground between me and my dad (very rare, i feal another post coming on). i tried my hand at being a writer and poet. if ur reading this post u are realising how bad it gets...i still try. u have to love my optimism and poor spelling :)  Im a soical guy and have a few close mates and many good friends. if you would like to be my friend there is a complicated and himuliating process that u have to go through. im that kinda guy really      i have a mother and a father. i know who they are too which is kinda cool. a sister who is weird but is loveable in her own way.      as for the voices i blame the government and women...EVIL I SAY!  Thats pretty much all you need to know about me for now...keep on reading the blog and u may get an erection, herpies or any form of medical problem."   I am hoping to go to uni at one point if i get the grades. it opens up oppertunites to great parties...lush girls and a career.  Your thoughts people?                  Uni a) waste of time b) worth a shot c) education rules (ahem BOOBIES)  Peace Out Dj Tramp Magic
