      what started out as a bad day turned out pretty good.. ok so im having way too much trouble in chem considering how much i like the class. it's just so frustrating when im making horrible grades and people around me are making 100s. ugh i will never understand that.. anyways everything else went pretty well. my sister had a concert at first colony tonight which went pretty well. everyone sounded pretty good and i got to see the incoming freshman for next year.  i know im going to sound like such a little kid by saying this but i miss my mom so much. i guess i've never realized how much i depend and care about her until she's away.. it just sucks that i have to find out this way.  so im having a really hard time deciding what to be for halloween.. if you have any ideas dont be afraid to let me know :)  i am so excited we are down to 1-2 rehersals a week. you have no idea how much this makes my life..  k well im going to bed bye guys goodnight and i'll see most of you in the morning!!  jess

      well i just want to start my first blog by saying hey to everyone!! but a special thanks goes out to all my friends at church.. our youth pastor who im sure you've heard me talk about might leave our church and move to san antonio. it really sucks because not only is he probly one of the best things to happen to our church, but this is the third time someone has left. i know God has a reaosn he is doing this, but it's really hard for me and everyone. so i wanna say thanks to all you guys for being there for me.  ok so on a lighter note we got third at sam houston!! im so happy that we did so well. we really have come a long way this season, and after last night i like our show a little better than i did before. yeah last year's show was awesome, but i just realized that we cant live in the past. im going to try not to use this as a soap box for all my complaints, but i do feel like there have been certain people that have become power hungry. but ohh well.. the season is pretty much over so we really dont have to deal with them anymore. :)  one last thing before i go.. my mom is out of town this week in las vegas. im really not looking forward to this week because my mom is usually the one who saves me in me and my dad's fights. he already told me tonight how i dissapointed him once again.. so i guess if you guys have time for me this week, say a prayer for me because im going to need it alright well im out!! i need to start the homework.. i've been up this morning since 7 after getting about 5 hours of sleep.. goodnight  jess

      *happy hump day*  today has been full of dissapointments. i wont get too into it but i think it is rude to say you will do something and then not do it. i mean i get my hopes up and then something comes up and the promise is no longer able to be kept..  so tomorrow is our last practice guys.. im sad, seriously. i dont like concert season. marching saves me and now it's over.  i have been listening to dashboard a lot lately which may not be a good thing.. this is my favorite by them..  "..I'm missing your bed I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak, And this bottle of beast Is taking me home  I'm cuddling close To blankets and sheets But you're not alone, and you're not discreet Make sure I know who's taking you home.  I'm reading your note over again There's not a word that I comprehend, Except when you signed it "I will love you always and forever."  Well As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs And sit alone and wonder How you're making out But as for me, I wish that I were anywhere with anyone Making out.."   alright guys sorry this wasnt the best entry ever but im kinda tired and i have a lot of things on my mind. see yall tomorrow  jess

      wow today was such a great day!! two in a row.. i hope i dont jinx it. so far this week i havent had too much homework which is good. but the homework i do get takes me forever and a day to finish..  ohh this is such a good song!! sweet home alabama.. im listening to a burned cd by the way  ok so let me explain to you how bizaar my moods are: sometimes i get these "urges" to clean. please keep reading before you decide how weird i am.. lol ok so anyways.. sunday i decided it was time to do some laundry since i hadnt done any in quite a while. so i walk into my room and every inch is covered with dirty clothes. it had been like that for a while but for some reason it really bothered me that day. so while im doing laundry i decide to clean my bathroom.. that turns into doing the dishes which turns into vacuuming, which turns into cleaning pretty much every room in my house.. lol so tonight i decide to practice. however, this is not possible because somehow between now and sunday the room where me and shelley do our homework and all that junk is trashed. so i start throwing stuff away and then i get in this mood again. i swear i may be the weirdest person alive because im an obsessive compulsive cleaning person, but my house looks great  laura i am soo happy that someone else likes hillary duff!! i love her and i thought i was the only one so it made my day that you like her too!!  so i think i may have the BEST blog EVER!! what.. you dont believe me?? just ask my readers..  angelkisses7891: so did you like the blog last night?? Sarcascio: Yeah Sarcascio: It was magical   k well im out for the night. bye guys have a great night and a great day tomorrow!!! i'll just leave you with a little of hillary's latest :)  jess  "..you can say you're bored - if you wanna you can act real tough - if you wanna you can say you're torn, but i've heard enough thank you you made my mind up for me, when you started to ignore me when you see a single tear, it isnt gonna happen here at least not today, not today, not today.. cause if it's over let it go and come tomorrow it will be so yesterday so yesterday im just a bird that's already flown away laugh it off but let it go and when you wake up it will seem so yesterday so yesterday havent you heard im gonna be ok?.."

      wow today was a great day!! G R E A T great. grades on the other hand arent too great.. but better than last 6 weeks. i managed a bring up my grade in spanish by like 20 points.. haha i love that class!! ok so we turn in this random notebook check thing. terrance and ashley are in that class with me. i get a 98 and i didnt turn in one of the 5 things. terrance got a 70 something and he didnt turn in one of the 5 things and ashley.. poor poor ashley.. she got a 44 and she had everything lol dont ask me how this works. apparantly maldonado took off points for ashley because she didnt put the date on her papers.. lol that sucks incredibly. but that's ok.. she's still pulling off better quiz grades than we are.  so enough about school. me and my mom and my sister went to the mall tonight. i was hoping it would relieve a little of the stress that is constantly with me. nope it didnt. i dont know why i am so stressed out but i swear im going to die of ulcers one day. lol yeah that was incredibly random. sorry guys.  yay for monday night football!! im praying that new england will pull off a win against the broncos.  so is anyone else excited that the last football game is here?? i've always been really sad when marching has been over but this year im sad that it's not lol it's funny how you can feel so passionately about something and then later you feel the complete opposit.  *ohh  relient k  is coming to town friday!! if anyone wants to go with me just let me know!! i wanna get a group together.. i have the link with ticket prices and all that stuff. give me a ring fool*  k well i better get to bed.. waay past my bed time :) bye guys.. i'll see you in the morning  jess

      im so confused about so many things right now. one of them i feel really guilty about. i dont understand why life has to be so complicated. i want something because i think that's the only way i will be happy. so now i have it and it should be wonderful but it's not.. i love what i have but i thought it would be so different than it really is.. i know im not making sense. i just dont understand why i can never be happy..  it's weird.. i always imagined my life to be a certain way.. friends that are awesome, a wonderful family, boyfriend, and great spiritual life.. well God has blessed me in all those ways and my life is so close to what i have always wanted it to be.. but im still not happy with it. i feel so empty..

      so im not sure if this weekend is going to be good or bad.. it started out great with jeff's party. by the way.. thanks jeff for having one!! it was awesome and i had so much fun!! but anyways i got home literally about 4 minutes late so my dad decided to ground me saturday night. so friday was good. i went to jamba juice and hung out with kyle since i never see him anymore. that was fun and then i had band which i was looking forward to because the game was supposed to be fun right?? wrong. matysiak started out the night by yelling at everyone for crap. it totally ruined my mood.. leave it to matysiak  so my halloween was ok.. my dad made me be home by curfew which is 11 30 so i didnt really bother going out after the game.  today was so much fun tho!! my dad had a company picnic thing at a ranch. they had inflatable things and bbq.. it was soo good!! me and my sister got in those sumo wrestler things which was really fun.  tomorrow im going to church with katy which should be fun. we are going to stop by panera bread for breakfast. everyone says they are really good but i have never been there. so i figure i should see what is so good about them :)  omg i am obsessed with dashboard again. i have been listening to their new cd lately and i love them so much!! you need to pick it up man. "..i'll be true, i'll be useful, i'll cavalier, i'll be yours my dear and i'll belong to you, if you just let me through this is easy as lovers go so dont complicate it by hesitating.."  well there's not much on my mind right now except that food sounds really good :) bye guys and have a great night!!  jess

      merry christmas!!  hey guys!! i hope everyone had a wonderful christmas and happy new year in a couple days!! i cant believe this year is almost over. it makes me feel so old hehe jk but seriously this has been my best year so far!!   well christmas for me was great!! my cousins flew in from utah and i only get to see them like twice a year so it was great to see them again!! my family is well which is great also. my aunt had neck surgery and she is reconvering well and my papa had back surgery and he is doing well also!! my break has been pretty awesome so far too!! i have gone shopping quite a but so far and im hoping that it's out of my system because im running out of money lol  ok this pisses me off soo much.. i was invited to go to the caymen islands with someone and their family this summer. i knew it would be asking a lot to go because my parents would have to pay for it. but when i ask my dad he doesnt even think about it before he says no. he says it would be too expensive so when i offer to pay for it myself he says that he wouldnt let me because he wants me to save for college.. but that doesnt make sense because my parents are paying for it!! he wont even put in the effort of calling her parents are talking to them about the expenses.. but what makes this even better is that while my sister is going to camp, going on a mission trip, and whatever else she's doing, im working and looking at colleges with my parents. they're not letting me do anything this summer because i have to work. i really hate my life right now.  jess

      hey guys  wow school is really coming down hard.. i mean tonight i have more homework than i've had in such a long time, not to mention  exams coming up.. but on the bright side we are almost done with half of our school year and to all those juniors out there, in a little over half a semester we're going to be SENIORS!! haha omg i am so excited yet so freaked out..  i hope everyone had an awesome thanksgiving!! with the exception of a couple things mine was great too  sometimes i wonder if life is really complicated, or if we just blow things out of proportion. for example, i like drama. life is so boring without it.. so i was wondering the other day if the reason me and my dad dont get along at all is my fault.. like maybe we fight because im the one starting them just so i will have a little drama to stir up my life.. ya know?? i hope im wrong.. that makes me sound like a horrible person.  happy birthday laura!! i am so excited about your party!!  omg i am an ace at chemistry!! i am soo pumped that i finally understand it so if anyone would like some help i would love for you to ask :)  so my dad and i were talking about some of my old friends the other day. he asked how they were doing and what they were up to, and i guess it just really hit me how much some of them have changed!! and with the exception of like a handful of people my group of friends has totally changed.. it just really surprised me.  alright well i still need to get an english paper together, study some more for chem and finish a lab, practice, study for math and then do a worksheet for it!! yeah im looking forward to it!! lol bye guys i'll see you tomorrow

      hey everyone  i got my Seventeen magazine in the mail today and britney spears is on the cover. surprisingly she has clothes on.. but ANYWAYS there is a box beside her that says, "WORLDWIDE EXCLUSIVE! Britney Spears 'the things i did weren't cool'" haha ohh man.. im not going to go there.  today was fun. in chem we made peanut brittle with the peanuts I bought at 6 45 this morning. it was wonderful. in english we're watching RADIO. i have no idea why we are watching it but im definately not complaining. spanish was better today.. ohh wait, that was a lie.  mr. matysiak made fun of my purse today after school. he kept saying peace and groovy and how hip it is.. lol so i bought a new one.  ok so sometimes you hear things you wish you didnt.. like after school when andrew said that john mayer is hot and he would do him. he's mormon too.. that has to be illegal or something.  ok so not being able to use AIM is KILLING me.. i seriously did not think it would be this bad and it's only the second night.. lol i dont think im going to be able to do this. seriously though.. call me to help me take my mind off of AIM. alright well im gonna hit the shower. bye guys. yall are amazing!!  j co

      today was just one of those days.  school was great for a monday. something hillarious happened in all of my classes today. it was great.  then i get home and the first thing my dad does is yell at me for something, except that my sister is the one that did it. it's funny how he automatically assumes it's me. then we go out to the bank and during the 30 minutes we are gone, i get 2 separate lectures. one about grades and the other about driving. grades i can understand, but i have done nothing wrong with my driving.  when we get home someone calls and invites me to a concert. im freaking out because i really want to go and they're box seats and it would just be amazing. i knew my parents wouldnt let me go but i guess i was praying for a miracle. so i ask my parents and long story short i cant go because it's on a school night and there are no parents going. i hate my life.  then my dad does what he does best and changes the subject to get mad at me for something else.. im so pissed off i dont feel like eating, so while im in my room during dinner, i hear  my family  talking about how i am going to fail out of college.. my dad thinks just because i want to do something on a school night that im going to fail out of college. that really hurts.  i am in so much pain right now i dont know what to do with myself. the thought of running away has seriously crossed my mind. i want to leave. obviously my family does not believe enough in me to want me here so i might as well go somewhere else.  sorry if im not myself tomorrow guys

      "so we talked all night about the rest of our lives where we're gonna be when we turn 25 i keep thinking times will never change keep on thinking things will always be the same when we leave this year we wont be coming back no more hanging out cause we're on a different track and if you got something that you need to say you better say it right now cause you wont have another day there's one thing only we cant slow down these memories are playing like a film without sound and i keep thinking of this night in june i didnt know much of love but it came too soon and it was me and you and yeah we got real blue stay at home talking on the telephone and we would get so excited and we'd get so scared laughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair and this how it feels..  as we go on, we remember, all the times we, had together and as our lives change, come whatever, we will still be friends forever  so if you get the big jobs and you get the big money when we look back now will our jokes still be funny will we still remember everything we learned in school still be trying to break every single rule will little brainy bobby be the stock-broken man can i ever find a job that wont interfere with a tan i keep thinking that it's not goodbye keep on thinking it's our time to fly and this is how it feels..  as we go on, we remember, all the times we, had together and as our lives change, come whatever, we will still be friends forever  will we think about tomorrow like we think about now can we survive it out there, can we make it somehow  i guess i thought that this would never end and suddenly it's like we're women and men  will the past be a shadow that will follow is round will these memories fade when i leave this town i keep thinking that it's not goodbye keep on thinking it's our time to fly.."  well that explains a little of what i've been feeling lately. im so excited to go to college, but then i think about possibly not ever seeing some of my friends again. i mean it just seems unreal to me how soon college is. i remember being in 5th grade thinking how far away the 12th grade seemed. next year im going to be in it..  i know that everything will work out in the end though. alright enough of that. im going to bed.  jess

      well the four day weekend has started off great. i slept in until 12 which felt incredible. it's been weeks since i've gotten to sleep in. then katelyn ashley and daniel came over and we watched dirty dancing. it was fun.  ok so i officially hate my job. maybe im an easy target but for one reason or another, my manager yells at me every week for something, and half the time it's not my fault! tonight he got mad at me for seating someone in a different booth.. why the heck does it matter as long as they get seated? ohh and what's even better is someone else told me to seat them in a different seat. i really dont know what to do about this..  well i hope everyone has an awesome valentines day and an even better 4-day weekend! bye guys.. call me and cheer me up :)  jess

      today was crazy.. it started out bad but then again with chemistry first period, it's hard to start a day nicely lol but anyways, i was really frustrated all day because i kept getting back grades that werent very good. i try hard but for some reason this six weeks im doing worse than usual.  but today after school really cheered me up! melissa and sara and i decided we wanted to have fun so after a trip to magpies, we went to krogers to buy some tortillas and a 2-liter jug of lemonaide. then we went back to sara's and hung out. it definately made my day a whole lot better!!  ok since thursday and sunday are my only nights to go out this weekend, we are making major plans!! im so mad i have to work 3 out of the 4 days i have off from school..  so daniel and i have decided school is too much and we're running away. if anyone else wants to come give me a holla  well now it is time to study for chem.. i think i may be stopping by starbucks again tonight so let me know if you wanna come  jess

      i've been thinking so much lately about next year, college, even after college. time goes by so fast and im scared about the future.. i've realized that i really dont want to grow up. i dont want to be on my own. i dont want bills to pay. i dont want to get old. i want to stay 16 forever. i want to be able to hang out with my friends, be dumb at school, and just be a kid. when i was little, my dad was always saying to enjoy being 10. enjoy being 13, because it only comes once in a lifetime, and once you're an adult, you're going to wish you could be 13 again.  i know you're thinking how insanely dumb i am for worrying about those things when it is so far away, but almost 17 years of my life have already gone by and it's gone by too fast.. i can remember playing dress up with my sister and playing with POGS in elementary school. i just dont want time to pass me by  well.. sorry about all that lol it was a little depressing.. alright well i will see you awesome guys at school and over the weekend!! enjoy your friday tomorrow!!  jess

      sorry it's been a while since i've written in here..  man life is crazy.. a good family friend was killed in a car accident saturday night. i've known her for as long as i remember and i just cannot understand how one second someone is here and the next their gone forever.. what's more is that her, her husband, and another couple went out that night thinking of having fun the night before the superbowl.. it really makes you appreciate the simple things in life.  so i got my first paycheck today and i made a grand total of $101.84!! and what do i do as soon as i get it?! spend it with a friend like any normal girl would :) melissa and i went on a little mall shopping spree and it was super fun  janet jackson needs to keep her boob(s) tucked away..  alright well im out like a fat girl in a softball game.. call me later

      today has been without a doubt the worst day of my life.  i wish so bad i could take back things i've said. i hurt my dad in so many ways tonight. maybe i shouldnt be writing this, but i need to let it out. my mom is in dallas until thursday and i miss her so much. i need her. i told my dad tonight that i hate him and i always have. i told him to go to hell. i never thought those things could come out of my mouth. im ashamed of myself. i've never felt this exact way before. i feel as if im not even living. my body is numb and im shaking. my dad said he's going to send me to boarding school. i think i believe him too. im not going to explain exactly how everything happened, but he did say some horrible things to me. i wish i wasnt living. i need my mom. i need someone i can talk to and that i know will listen. my dad doesnt love me and now i dont know if i love him. i want this feeling to stop.

      im so confused. i wish i could see into the future so i would know how things are going to turn out. im so bad at making decisions and knowing what i should do in certain situations. my heart feels one way, but my mind feels another. i feel like im being pulled in all these different directions. but at the same time i love feeling this way. i love the thrill of not knowing what is going to happen. i love that i feel this way. the only problem is i feel this way so often with so many people, i never know when it's genuinly real anymore.

      so today was 2004's graduation. it's sad but at the same time exciting. sad because things will never be the same. my friends are graduating and going to college. sometimes i wish things would never change.. that everything would stay the same forever. i mean i really do have a great life. sure i freak out about things but they are so insignificant. i look forward to getting up in the morning because i know i will be spending time with the people i care about most, and in a year we will all be graduating and going our separate ways. i wish my life would stay like this forever. never leave my friends, never live on my own, and never get old. sure there are things to look forward to as we get older and move on, but i will never have as much fun as i've had these past 3 years. all we have are the memories, and hopefully we will be able to keep those forever.

      Today was so much fun!! Business computer exam was easy, and I'm confident I made the A I needed.  I'm happy about making top band!! Next year is going to be amazing fun since I'm in there now :)  The Galleria was so much fun!! That cheesecake at the jewish deli was amazing!! I just wish I had money.. there were some very cute PUMAS!! lol Melissa.. that trolli man was pretty hot.. lol  People surprise me everyday..  All my friends are so amazing, and I am so lucky to have you guys!! Thanks so much for always being there through all the drama I go through. You've made this year worth while, and I'm looking forward to all the fun we're going to have this summer!!  So here's my sad story.. This morning leaving Starbuck's the Graduation song by Vitamin C came on the radio, and as I was singing I started crying. Even though I am thrilled to death that it's summer, it's still sad that the '04 year has come to an end. I mean no more crazy days with Coach Garwick criticizing my love life, and no more sharing food with Katelyn during lunch. Sure next year is going to have even more wonderful memories in store for me, but I'm going to miss the old ones.  Well I need to get back to studying. Bye guys I love you all and promise to have fun at those fun days without me :)  Jess

      Man what a day. First I need to give an apology.. Katie I am so sorry I couldn't go to your graduation party tonight. You know how my dad is.. he wouldn't let me go out because of my chem exam. I am so sorry.. you have no idea how much I wanted to be there.  I think I've been watching too much sex and the city. I'm slowly becoming addicted to that show and the ironic thing is that I've become addicted once the show is off the air. lol One day I want my life to be like that. Well maybe without all the sex. I just want 3 best friends and to live in New York. I guess we'll have to wait and see..  So I guess I should get back to studying chem. If you guys have any words of encouragement or just feel like talking you know you can call me  jess

      today has been the weirdest day. i have had so many ups and downs.  at my doctor's appointment today she said i might need a higher dosage of the medicine. great, esspecially since i havent been taking them.  then i went to pic up my prom pics today with kyle and i freaked out for no reason. when i got them i realized my mom ordered the 3 x 5's instead of the 4 x 6's and i was so upset. then as i was looking through them i got mad because they didnt come out as good as i had hoped. kyle had to calm me down. i am so weird.  today i found out there is a little rumor going around about me. i dont think that many people know about it, but it's gay and makes me hate school even more. i have never had this happen to me before and it sucks. so if you hear something outrageous about me and someone else dont believe it.  have you ever only wanted something because someone else wants it too?? ok story of my life. it's so annoying. i wish i could really understand how i feel about something before someone else is going after the same thing i am. sorry that's a little vague but i dont feel like explaining.  alright im out. call me tonight if you feel like talking. if not i'll see you tomorrow. ohh and by the way jeff.. i love the hair  jess

(no not sex) finding $20 in your jeans pocket!! THEN tonight i went shopping!! i was supposed to go to ramsey's house to study with deb but she gives horrible directions!! so yeah i went shopping and got 3 new shirts, a pair of headphones that go behind your head (i've wanted them forever!!), and some picture frames for prom pics!! it was so much fun. i love shopping and i dont care how materialistic that makes me sound.  well since i got no studying done today with deb i should probably go do some!! i am in such a good mood that studying for algebra 2 and chem cant ruin it!! yay ok well i will see you ballers tomorrow  jess  ohh no!! i just remembered that i have a doctor's appointment tomorrow afternoon and i havent taken my medicine in a looong time. uh oh..

      ohh my goodness i am so ready for summer. school is definitely kicking my you know what right now. i just dont care anymore. i need it to be over.  i am in such a mood to watch sex and the city!!  so i stopped taking my medicine. it's probably not a very good decision but i dont care. it always made me feel nauseous. but anyways i got into 3 fights with my dad with weekend. i got grounded thursday night, my car is gone for a week (if you see me driving dont tell them), and my cell phone is gone. i really cannot wait for college.  jeff im so excited about your party friday night!! summer is definitely going to be different without you here, but i know you're going to have an awesome summer with the scouts. just dont forget about us while you're away!!  ok in less than 2 weeks we're going to be seniros. i am so excited!! next year is going to be so amazing, but at the same time it's going to be sad. it's my last year with you guys, last season of football games, last first day of school, blah blah blah. we need to make it count!!  alright im hitting the homework. i'll see you guys tomorrow  jess

      hey guys!! wow this past week went by so slow.. i missed everyone so much!! i remember thursday night talking to terrance and melissa and laura and after getting off the phone i felt like i might start to cry. i guess it kind of hit me that in a year we're all going to be going our separate ways.. kinda sucks but then again im so excited. when i was at texas tech, this guy kyle (very good looking by the way) gave us our tour and during it i told him how pointless high school suddenly seemed to be. for the first time in my life i had no desire to go back to clements and finish out my senior year, which for me as you know, is so weird. i mean on the last day of school this past year i remember hearing graduation on the radio and crying lol but once you get to college and take the tour and start interviews, high school just seems so pointless.  so for the first time in my life i have no idea at all what i am going to do with the rest of my life. i have always planned on being an elementary school teacher. i have never even considered anything else because it seemed like something i wanted to do. also, for the past 3 years or so i have been set on going to texas tech. this past week of going to different colleges has totally screwed up my plans. the college we went to was texas tech and, of course, i fell in love with the people, the campus, the dorms, the school.. everything. but but then after going to stephen f austin, i am seriously considering going there for many reasons. sfa has never been a school i've wanted to go to. nothing about it ever appealed to me before, but after going there, i love it. there are so many things about it that dont even compare to tech. but then there are so many things at tech that dont compare with sfa. then my dad starts talking to me about how he thinks i should consider something in mass communications. i had never even thought about doing something with communications, but my dad feels it would suit me better than teaching because he feels that i am a people person, very social, blah blah blah. so anyways we check it out and now i feel like i would love to major in public relations or journalism. never in my life have i been so stressed out about this. the reason i never wanted to consider anything other than education is because i have to have everything planned out exactly the way i want them. now that i have no idea where im going to school and even what im majoring in, i feel like my life is so unorganized. last night at dinner i started crying when i was talking to my parents about this. i am just so stressed out about everything right now. i feel like i have to have a plan right this second and since this is the first time in my life that i dont, i cant handle it.  alright well just typing this out makes me feel a little better. i know that within a year i will hopefully have some kind of plan for my future. it's just these next few months that are going to stress me out completely. i mean this is the summer.. it's not meant for stressing and worrying, but yet that is all i am doing right now. lol it figures..  well i am so excited to be back in sugar land!! you guys are amazing and i missed all of you so much!! i dont know what i would do without any of you.. alright well i need to get ready for katelyn's. bye guys  jess

      hey everyone. man i am so tired. today my dad told me that i wouldnt be able to go out tonight because we needed to pack for the college touring trip as a family. yes he said "pack together as a family".  tomorrow i have to drop my car off to get inspected for the 4th time, but my dad is thinking he's going to drop it off for me because the last time at the inspection place this old indian man hit on me asking for my number and a kiss.  so i got paid $123.34 yesterday (monday). i cashed my paycheck with laura this morning and took out $75 (tuesday). i now have $6 to my name (wednesday at 1 11 in the morning).  nice job john and jack on the website! my favorite is terrance "i put my hand up on your hip.." lol awesome job guys!  alright well im off to bed.  jess  ohh and melissa.. now that i think about it, i remember i time i was babysitting for my church and one of the boys kept hitting my butt.. lol yeah little boys are horn dogs.

       here in this diary i write you visions of my summer   it was the best i ever had   there were choruses and sing-a-longs   and not a spoken feeling   im knowing that right now is all that matters      all the nights we stayed up talking   listening to 80's songs   and quoting lines from all those movies that we loved   it still brings a smile to my face   i guess when it comes down to it      being grown up isnt half as fun as growing up   these are the best days of our lives   the only thing that matters is just following your heart   and eventually you'll finally get it right      breaking into hotel swimming pools   and wreaking havok on our world   and hanging out at truck stops just to pass the time   the black top's singing me to sleep      lighting fireworks in parking lots   illuminates the blackest nights   cheery cokes under this moonlit summer sky   2015 riverside, it's time to say good bye   get on the bus, it's time to go      being grown up isny half as fun as growing up   these are best days of our lives   the only thing that matters is just following your heart   and eventually you'll finally get it right

       so today was our first day back for band. my summer is officially over. now i know that pretty much everyone was dreading it, but it's here whether we like it or not. there is no getting around it, so we might as well make the best of it. seniors, tonight was out last first day back EVER. it's sad, at least i think it is. i know some of you are like jumping for joy that it's our last year, but i find it sad. honestly, i was a little excited to come back. i havent seen some people all summer, and i really do like hanging out with the band kids. also, i think everything will go back to normal for the most part. this summer has been the most dramatic one i have ever had. im hoping that with band starting again it will kind of get us back in the swing of things, and help everything come back to normal. anyways i had fun. melissa and i have already thought of the flute section shirts and they are going to be AMAZING. definitely unbeatable, so dont even try. we were also thinking of some fun spirit days such as crazy underwear day, no deotorant day, and tutu day. let me know if anyone else likes any of these and we could make it official. ohh another good thing about band starting is that jeff is coming home that much sooner. i really do miss him and i know you guys feel the same when i say summer hasnt been the same without him. but in a way im glad he left for so long. it's really made me see how much i appreciate him. i know that i have really taken him for granted and i miss so many things about him. so only 3 more weeks. yay     &nbsp;   ohh happy birthday kyle!! sorry i got grounded or else you know i would have celebrated it with you and your family!!     &nbsp;   alright well im gonna go get some ice cream.. yummy!! bye guys     &nbsp;   jess

       hey guys!! john mayer last night was amazing!! it was so good!! first maroon 5 opened and they were pretty good. i really like them and their songs, but they were only on for like an hour. so then around 9 john comes on and like the entire place erupted and stood up for him. it was so cool. he played for about 2 hours and it was the best 2 hours of my life.. im not even kidding. ohh and i recorded your body is a wonderland and real world on my phone by him, and i recorded one from maroon 5. it was so good and definitely worth the $54 for tickets. alright well i know im kinda rambling on about this so i'll go ahead and get off. i hope everyone has fun tonight at the bbq. i so want to be there, but im grounded.    &nbsp;  im going to leave you with my favorite john mayer song from last night    jess    &nbsp;  Comfortable    &nbsp;  i just remembered that time at the market   snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart   and rolled down aisle five   you looked behind you to smile back at me   and crashed into a rack full of magazines   they asked us if we could leave    &nbsp;  i cant remember what went wrong last september   though im sure you'd remind me if you had to    &nbsp;  our love was comfortable and so broken in    &nbsp;  i sleep with this new girl im still getting used to   my friends all approve   say "she's gonna be good for you"   they throw me high fives   she says the Bible is all that she reads   and prefers that i not use profanity   you mouth was so dirty    &nbsp;  life of the party and she swears that she's artsy   but you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane    &nbsp;  our love was comfortable and so broken in   she's perfect   so flawless   or so they say    &nbsp;  she thinks i cant see the smile that she's faking   and poses for pictures that arent being taken   i loved you   grey sweatpants   no makeup   so perfect    &nbsp;  our love was comfortable and so broken in   she's perfect   so flawless   im not impressed   i want you back

      &nbsp; ok so im really starting to get pissed off with my dad. things have been pretty ok for the last couple of weeks, but now my mom is out of town and whenever she is things get bad again. all the sudden he's not letting me leave the house at all. his excuse is that i need to study for the SAT and i need to practice. however, when my mom was here he was not nearly this passionate about me doing those 2 things.&nbsp; my theory for it is that since he is the only one here, he has to prove that he still has power over me or something. by doing this he is basically not going to let me have a life. very cool of him, dont you think?? anyways all this just makes me want to leave for college even more. he still treats me like im 5 and am incapable of making my own decisions. it is so annoying. he tells me that i need to grow up and start learning responsibility, yet he wont allow me to do it. he's so paranoid that if he lets me go im never going to come back to him, and if he keeps treating me like this it is very possible that could happen. i remember that once he got mad at me for wanting to go out (this was at the beginning of the summer). he was like, "all you ever do is go out. what happens when the school year comes and you want to go out during the week?? if you keep acting this way in college you're going to fail out." gee thanks dad.. apparently because i want to go out during the summer, that means im going to want to do it during the school year, which means im going to do it in college, which therefore means im going to fail out. i am just so frustrated right now. he doesnt trust me at all..    &nbsp;  well on a lighter subject, my lessons teacher is stalking me. she calls my cell phone and leaves me messages, calls my house and leaves me messages, and emails me.. everyday.&nbsp;last thursday when some of us went to galveston, i skipped my lesson so we could leave sooner. she emailed my DAD saying that i skipped it and started bitching about me. ok i admit that i should not have skipped my lesson, but i didnt even know she had my dad's email!! like really.. what is this?? im kind of scared..    &nbsp;  well im gonna go.. i really want to go out so im going to try and talk my dad into it. bye guys.. yall are awesome!    &nbsp;  jess

       today was fun. i had&nbsp;to work which was not that fun, but it was a better day. then i came home, changed, and went over to michaels for a few. then i came home and got ready to go out to brennens for dinner and then to see a play. i love doing these things because i love dressing up!! yes i know, i am such a girlie girl, but i love it!! i just think there is nothing better than doing my hair, make up, and finding a dress and shoes to wear out for a night on the town. it makes me feel so pretty!! lol im serious though.. i only know a handful of girls that would dissagree with me. most girls love it and i am certainly no exception. well anyways, the play was pretty good. it was an agatha christi play and my mom loves her. it was a muder mystery.. blah blah blah. i mean it was good and very well done, im just a little tired of those kinds of plays.    &nbsp;  terrance katelyn meg and i were having a very nice discussion about growing apart once we leave for college. terrance is very sure that we will all still be friends, when the 3 of us are just trying to be realistic about the matter by believing that things are going to be very different once we get back from college. sure im going to want to see everyone and hang out and catch up, i just dont think relationships are going to be the same. we will all have new things in common. new friends, different majors and universities, new lives. but the whole time terrance was set in his ways by saying that we will all still be friends. and then he said something that is SO unbelieveably cliche, but so true. he said, "if you think positive, positive things will happen. if you think negative, negative things will happen." and looking back on it now, he is so right. i mean the mind is a very powerful thing. for about the past week or so i have been in a very depressed mood. i have been being negative about everything, hating my life. i am so dumb. things arent even that bad for me. i have wonderful friends, a wonderful boyfriend, and an amazing family. and for some reason when i woke up today i felt different about things. it really is like a little light bulb went off inside my head and made me realize that i have been acting like a little baby feeling sorry for herself. if i want my life to be better i have to make it happen. i have to trust that good things are in store for me, and i do. if i believe enough that i am going to have good things in store for me it will happen. i will make it happen. anyways thanks terrance. friendship is eternal :)    &nbsp;  well since this is officially our last week before band starts again so we need to make it amazing. i suggest strip poker or maybe another day at galveston?? let me know if you have something in mind and i will help put it together!! alright bye guys you all are amazing    &nbsp;  jess

       "..So quiet, another wasted night    the television steals the conversation    exhale, another wasted breath    again it goes unnoticed.     Please tell me you're just feeling tired    cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break    out of touch, out of time.    Please send me anything but signals that are mixed    cause I can't read your rolling eyes    out of touch, are we out of time?     Close lipped, another goodnight kiss    is robbed of all it's passion    your grip another time is slack    it leaves me feeling empty.     I'll wait until tomorrow    maybe you'll feel better then, maybe we'll be better then    so what's another day    when I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you    this mood of yours is temporary    it seems worth the wait to see your smile again    out of the corner of your eye wont be the only way you'll look at me then.." &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  i hate this so much.. nothing ever comes&nbsp;easy for me. &nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   ok so im supposed to be enjoying the last few weeks of my summer, but instead they have been horrible. my friends are fighting and im in the middle of it. i wish we could all just hang out without getting mad about gay things like, why didnt he invite me over? and why didnt they call me about the movie? i could understand that it might leave you feeling left out, but i promise people are not doing it on purpose. no one is intentionally trying to leave anyone out. there are just so many people in our group that it is impossible to invite every single person. so there.. im sorry if i offended anyone, but i have been wanting to say that for a while.     &nbsp;   ok so i just&nbsp;had one of the worst nights at work ever. there is this stupid annoying waitress who is always yelling at the hostesses and telling us how to do our job. but apparently im the only one that gets mad at her for it, because tonight she called me a bitch and told me i have issues. that is so rude! first of all i never did anything to deserve for her to call me that! second, she knows nothing about me, so even if i did have issues she wouldnt know. what the hell.. i hate it when people hate for me no fucking reason. she knows nothing about me and what i go through everyday so she has no right to say those things about me. &nbsp;    sorry about this entry. i am so stressed out right now.. i wouldnt be surprised if i got an ulcer or something from all this. it's summer.. im supposed to be enjoying myself and instead im worried about like 20 million different things. i need to get away or something. sorry again. i'll talk to you guys later.     &nbsp;   jess

      "..Does it comfort you to know you fought the good fight Basking in your victory, hollow and alone to boast your bitter bragging rights to anyone who'll listen While you're left with nothing tangible to gain.."  that sounds familier..  so i know no one wants to hear this but we have less than a month before school starts, and definitely only 2 weeks before summer band starts up again. but you know, this isnt all bad. i am so excited about starting my senior year!! we are going to have so much fun!! as for band.. well i cant think of anything good yet but im going to keep trying. i just cant believe how fast this summer has gone by. i've had a bunch of firsts this summer too.. i officially started my college search by starting visits. i had my first clubbing experience!! this is the first summer i've had a job and the first summer i've had a boyfriend. this is also the first summer i have been able to drive.. wow im thinking that has got to be my favorite one lol i've had so many good times like the slumber parties with the sex and the city crew, or just the sex crew lol sara.. strip poker still needs to happen!! isnt it weird how summer can almost seem magical?? ok i know that sounds totally corny and like i stole it from a movie or something but you know im right. i mean during the summer, life seems so carefree and i feel like i can take on anything. like suddenly im on top of the world and nothing can bring me down. not my dad making me stay home for no reason, not my managers at work being dicks, not even getting dissapointed once again. i love that feeling, and i only get it during summer. guys i love yall so much and i wish we didnt have to fight like we are now. maybe for just this last month of the summer, we could put aside whatever differences we have with one another and just enjoy eachother's company. i mean each person brings their own meaning to our group, whether its their smile, laugh, stories, or whatever. i know that i need each and every one of you, and im almost possitive you feel the same way. maybe we could make this last month of our summer the most enjoyable and memorable yet. you guys are amazing and i will see yall later  jess

      it's late and i have all these thoughts in my head so i am going to type them out.. sorry if they dont make sense.  we only have like a little over a month left of summer. i know it sucks that im already counting down the days until school, i just cant help it. i mean this summer has been so much fun. it's definitely been better than any others, and i hate to see it end so quickly. and this is the last summer we are going to have not as adults. a year from now most of us will be 18 and going our seperate ways to college. that blows. enjoy it guys.. make the best of every moment. dont let anything go by unsaid or unnoticed. yall are amazing and i am so thankful i have you. i mean all of you have made me who i am. you've turned me into the person that i am today, and i know that i have learned so much more from you guys than from my parents, family, and teachers. you guys are the real thing and you really understand me for me. you have no idea how grateful i am.  some people have been really making me mad lately. all i have to say is dont talk about me behind my back. that is so middle school.. lets act our age please.  what is it about guys?? i mean why is it that i cant go a few days without wanting one and i think lately it's been a little out of control. at least now im down to one and i think he's a keeper.. i just love that feeling i get when i think about him. the butterflies never get old. it's amazing what liking someone can do to you. i used to hate awkward situations with a guy. i remember in middle school when i liked someone i would tell everyone but say dont say anything!! and then once he found out it was the worst thing ever!! lol and i know i was not the only one!! you know you did it too.. lol we were so weird back then. but now thinking back on it, how can anything happen unless the other person knows. of course you should probly be the one that drops the hints instead of your best friend or the person that is supposed to be hooking you up. but you should definitely let them know. you never know what could happen unless you do. and if they like you back, it's the best feeling in the world. nothing compares to it. finding someone is without a doubt the best thing ever. and if you havent yet, dont worry. eventually they will come to sweep you off your feet. no worries.  alright well this has definitely been one of my more productive blogs i think. you may not have enjoyed it as much as i did writing it, but it's definitely helped me clear my thoughts and what not. ohh and sorry about that middle part. im really not that upset, it's just one of my pet peeves. but seriously, if you are upset with me about something, tell me. it's the only way it can get solved. good night guys. i love you all so much!  jess

      i wish that i could do what i want or express how i feel without having to worry what people will think. i realised last night that there is a whole other side of me that very few people know about. i feel like i have to be this person that everyone expects me to be, and it's really hard sometimes. by trying to make everyone else happy, im hurting myself in the process.

      hey guys. so it's been a while. last night we played murder in the dark at michaels vige's house. it was fun.. everyone would hide in the dark and then one person would go and find them. so i get home and my dad is mad at me (honestly im not surprised anymore.. i have just come to expect it) and he decides he wants to take my car keys and cell phone away from me. the ironic thing is that our whole neighborhood's power was out, so i hid from him in the dark and he couldnt find me. lol so yes i still have my cell phone and car keys but im guessing that tonight when he gets home im not going to be able to go out.  so these past few days i was with my cousins who are down from utah, and no they're not mormon. i think they're the only non-mormons in that state lol  im so excited about the john mayer/maroon 5 concert on july 24!! it is going to be so much fun!! im hoping that john will spot me in the crowd of thousands and we can begin our life together.. lol  ok i have the scariest story ever.. the other day i went to best buy to buy the phantom planet cd which by the way is amazing, and then i went to the exxon right by it to get gas. i park by a station and go inside to give the teller guy my money so i can get my gas. so there's this like 30 year old guy infront of me and as he turns around he stares at me and then turns to leave. i didnt think anything of it, except that when i turn around to leave the guy is at the door waiting for me! he opens the door for me and i said thank you and he's like no problem what-so-ever baby.. and then as im walking off i hear him say damn i'd like do hit that! EWWW ok so im not good at telling people to f off so i just tell myself im never going to see him again and it's not a big deal. so i go to my car and i see him drive off staring at me. then i realize my pump is broken or something so i go inside to tell the teller guy and he fixes it. so as im coming out i see that that guy has parked his van behind my car and is looking at me while talking on a cell phone. ok this is where i get freaked out. i finish pumping gas and get in my car and leave, and guess who follows me. i go all the way down sweetwater and he's still behind me. so then i turn into my friends subdivision and thankfully he keeps going.. that was very scary.. why do guys have to be such perverts?!  alright well i need to get dressed and eat something. frisbee today at 3 and then sara and i were talking about strip poker tonight?? call my cell, but im not sure if im going to be able to get out of the house. you guys are amazing and i'll talk to you later.  jess

       hey guys!! so band yesterday was very entertaining. between the waterballoons, seeing holly, winning the pizza party, and hearing about john's grounding, i had a good time.      so the taurus is getting painted.. woo hoo!!      last night michael made me watch the south park movie. that was the biggest insult to musicals ever.      so tonight i went to dinner with my dad and my mom. towards the end of it we got into the discussion about college and what's going to happen afterwards. i got chills all over my body and then i started crying. i dont know what came over me, but the thought of my being grown and totally living on my own scared the crap out of me. i know i complain so much about my parents and how horrible i think my life is right now, but i really do love my life just the way it is. i love my friends, i love my family, i love clements high school, and even band. i love every person that has come into my life. i dont want any of it to change. i am perfectly content with my life staying the same as it is now. i hate change. i dont want to grow up and get old and have to live on my own. that is just so scary to me, im not surprised it brought me to tears.    alright well im gonna go. bye guys      jess      "well she grew up with the children of the stars   in the hollywood hills and the boulevard   her parents threw big parties, everyone was there   they hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper and Bob Sieger and Sonny and Cher   well she feels safe now in the bar on Farafax   and from the stage i can tell that she cant let go and she cant relax   and just before she hangs her head to cry   i sing to her a lullabye      i sing..   everything's gonna be alright   rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye   everything's gonna be alright   rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye      well she still lives with her mom outside the city   down that street about a half a mile   and all her friends tell her she's so pretty   but she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while   cause even her smile looks like a frown   and she's seen her share of devils in this angel town      everything's gonna be alright   rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye   everything's gonna be alright   rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye      i told her i aint so sure about this place   it's hard to play a gig in this town, keep a straight face   and it seems like everybody's got a plan   it's kinda like nashville, with a tan      everything's gonna be alright   rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye   everything's gonna be alright   rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye"

       hey!! so last night was basically the best night of my life all summer. the sex and the city girls are so amazing!! between our kroger adventure with chicken weenies and hick women, the shaving cream fight, pictures of booties, showering together, skinny dipping while talking about the SAT, cucumber/mud masks, seeing Jesus, double shots of espresso, and streaking multiple times, last night was amazing!! that was such a bonding experience, and i think the booty picture should go in the year book!! lol i love you guys so much and nothing will ever come between us!!      I sit and wait does an angel contemplate   and do they know the places where we go   when we're grey and old   cause I've been told that salvation lets their wings unfold      So when I'm lying in my bed   thoughts running through my head   And i feel that love is dead   I'm loving angels instead   And through it all she offers me protection   a lot of love and affection   Whether I'm right or wrong   and down the waterfall   Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me   When I come she won't forsake me   I'm loving angels instead      When I'm feeling weak and my pain walks down a on way street   I look above   And I know I'll always be blessed with love   and as the feeling grows   She breathes flesh to my bones   and when love is dead   I'm loving angels instead
