       our outreach was fun... my partner was non other than of course, my bestfriend, NotNot. our foster family was composed of Nanay Linda, Tatay Leby, Ineng and Jon. We expected to be doing lots of stuff like cleaning the house, doing the laundry... but instead our nanay told us not to do anything but take care of Ineng so that's what we did... Ü we took her around... (actually she was the one who gave us the tour.... hehe Ü) and we bought her food from the tindahan just across our house... where 3sha and robbie were staying... Ü (promise 3sh u'd make a good tindera! hehe Ü) we took pictures and when it was about... 11:00 am, i started cooking the porkchop... NotNot helped a little bit... Ü we ate lunch and they told me it was good.... NotNot loved it actually... diba Nots?? hehe Ü nway.... when it was about 1:00 pm, we gathered together... and the children played games with Norms and Pielle as the "gamemasters" !! Ü Go Pielle and Norms! hehe Ü after that we performed a not-so-prepared dance number... diba jam?? hehe Ü (sorry, i forgot the cd)... but still, jam danced gracefully as always! Ü (nax) hehe Ü after that, we had a prayer service or something then, we went back to skul.... hehe ÜÜ the end.... Ü (do i make this sound like a bedtime story or something...) i'm kind of like an ingleshera 2day... la lng.. Ü

      haay.... grabe na ito!! Ü &nbsp; Anyone can be passionate, but it takes real lovers to be silly.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; The best thing to hold onto in this world is each other. &nbsp;  &nbsp; Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile, It takes only a smile to make a dark day bright. &nbsp;  &nbsp; The door to the human heart can only be opened from the inside. &nbsp; &nbsp; For it was not into my ear you whispered, but into my heart. It was not my lips you kissed, but my soul. &nbsp; If you love someone, put their name in a circle, instead of a heart, because hearts can break, but circles go on forever. &nbsp; &nbsp; Immature love says: "I love you because I need you." Mature love says: "I need you because I love you." &nbsp; &nbsp; Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have. &nbsp; &nbsp; Love enables you to put your deepest feelings and fears in the palm of you partner's hand, knowing they will be handled with care. &nbsp; &nbsp; You learn to like someone when you find out what makes them laugh, but you can never truly love someone until you find out what makes them cry. &nbsp; &nbsp; You never lose by loving, you always lose by holding back. &nbsp; &nbsp; Your soul-mate is the one who brings out the best in you - not perfect but always perfect for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;  ang kukyut ng mga quotes nya prahmis!! ÜÜ  &nbsp;    "It takes a minute to have a crush on someone,an hour to like someone, and an day to love someone...but it takes a lifetime to forget someone."    "Lucky is the man who is the first love of a woman,but luckier is the woman who is the last love of a man."    "Love me now, love me never,but if you love me, love me forever."    Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve,t oo short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity.    I like you because of who you are to me I hate you because of what you did to me I miss you because you want her, not me I love you and that's how it will always be.    Spoiler:  My friend, I hate to do this, but our friendship just can't last. The time we shared together has all faded in the past. I told you this would happen... Our friendship was bound to end. Although I know you care, I can't consider you a friend. Please don't try to argue, but try to understand... That time can change two people like the tide can change the sand. Our friendship has been lovely, but you see it just wouldn't do. For now I see you in a different way. I've fallen in love with you.&nbsp;           &nbsp;     i especially love the poem at d end.... la lng.. ÜÜ   &nbsp;

       luk   @ marga.... marga...'s post... i luv it... awww.... ÜÜ visit her blogger @  urlLink http://authentic_genuine.blogspot.com     &nbsp;   Argument   Q:&nbsp; What is Love? &nbsp; A:&nbsp; Love.&nbsp; There are three kinds of love... first is real love, crush, illusion. Pinakamasakit yung illusion kasi, for some of us... we say we love someone but we do not really mean it when we say it.&nbsp; Though sometimes involuntarily blurted... hindi mo pa rin matatawag na true love ang isang pakiramdam kung ito lamang ay isang paku-chaba ng pag-iisip. &nbsp; I don't know where I got that idea at all... bigla ko na lang nai-type.&nbsp; It's strange when I blurt out stuff like this.&nbsp; I say what I think involuntarily, regardless of how it might affect other people.&nbsp; Ganun talaga ako...&nbsp; There are times when I say what I want to, just because.&nbsp; It is never an issue though sometimes people take it the wrong way.&nbsp; Having to think back... there were countless times when I said stuff I meant but I never bothered to insist modesty.&nbsp; I was oblivious to what other people might've or rather... have felt.&nbsp; Thinking about these things, made me remember the times when I was very free-willed.&nbsp; I had never really paid that much attention... it's strange when I just... say things.&nbsp; I keep talking and talking and talking, until I don't have anything left to say... or until I've run out of breath... &nbsp; Now here comes the realy personal part...&nbsp;my insensitivity towards the world around me shifted when I entered the Honor's Class.&nbsp; Though it&nbsp;may seem as if it was alright... I was alright, it really never was from the start.&nbsp; I got pressured every single time, I always had to keep up... it was intense.&nbsp; Then and there have I realized that my&nbsp;insensitive self had not been active, at least no till later.&nbsp; I remembered it vividly.&nbsp; Grade 6 ako noon.&nbsp; Gosh... it seems like&nbsp;yesterday!&nbsp; Honestly, thinking back seems it all happened just yesterday...&nbsp; Anyway, there was this time when I blurted what I had in mind...&nbsp; It was surprisingly unexpected on the 6G honor students to hear me say such things.&nbsp; I guess they didn't&nbsp;really expect to hear me say such things... at least not yet.&nbsp; Afterwards, they began to accept me as someone who isn't always giving and all.&nbsp; I am opinionated and sometimes insensitive too... &nbsp; But you know... that is exactly what I like about this class.&nbsp; They're very open.&nbsp; And now that I am a Freshmen, it's all very clear.&nbsp; What I admire about the Honor's class is not the fact that they're all very intelligent and that they can withstand every 'jolt', but it's they're attitude towards people... Everyday it's the same thing since Grade 6.&nbsp; I come to school, they're all giddy about something, again.&nbsp; It never stops till bell time.&nbsp; For a short period of time in line... they remain quiet.&nbsp; As if to show a distilled disposition.&nbsp; And when that's over... the noise retaliates once again.&nbsp; It never stops... I silently watch what they do... the smiles on their faces, the laughs they make, the homeworks they share!!!&nbsp; It's all so... them.&nbsp; It's a unique bond between friends.&nbsp; Despite the fights, they remain bonded and close.&nbsp; Though not all of them are so close to one another... they still 'stick together'; siyempre, may pingsamahan kasi eh... &nbsp; It's nice to think that I am a part of this bond...&nbsp; I may not be tightly tied to them, I still think that were all good friends.&nbsp; Kahit na may mga napag-aawayan, it doesn't mean were not friends.&nbsp; And that's what I like most about this class... alam nila na dapat ang bawat tao na bago sa kanila... tinatanggap.&nbsp; It's very admirable...&nbsp; It's nice to know that I am welcomed amongst them.&nbsp; They understand me perfectly...&nbsp; The achievements, the reputation, the image... these are not those of which that make the Honor's Class... the Honor's class.&nbsp; It's their openness.&nbsp; I am happy that they accept me&nbsp;for who&nbsp;I am.&nbsp; I am happy that they like me for who I am.&nbsp; And most of all... I am happy that they welcome me into their bond... just as I am... &nbsp; Minsan ganun talaga ang buhay.&nbsp; Bigla ka na lang magugulat sa mga pagbabago.&nbsp; Kahit man naiilang ka, natatakot ka, nag-iisa ka... laging may ibinigay na gabay ang buhay upang ika'y maihikayat upang tumindig.&nbsp; Pasalamat ko sa Diyos na binigyn ako ng pagkakataon na mapasama sa kanila...Ü &nbsp; Sorry... is it too much?&nbsp;&nbsp;        &nbsp;  ang kyot noh????? ÜÜ ;p
