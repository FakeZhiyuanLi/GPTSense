      Venho mais uma vez postar uma letra...desta vez é&nbsp;da Dead Boy's Poem...Leiam a letra com a música de preferência...é excelente...   Dead Boy´s Poem    Born from silence, silence full of it   A perfect concert my best friend   So much to live for, so much to die for   If only my heart had a home    &nbsp;  Sing what you can`t say   Forget what you can`t play   Hasten to drown into beautiful eyes   Walk within my poetry, this dying music   -&nbsp;My loveletter to nobody    &nbsp;  Never sigh for better world   It`s already composed, played and told   Every thought the music I write   Everything a wish for the night    &nbsp;  Wrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin   Died for the beauty the one in the garden   Created a kingdom, reached for the wisdom   Failed in becoming a god    &nbsp;  Never sigh for better world   It`s already composed, played and told   Every thought the music I write   Everything a wish for the night    &nbsp;  "If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it   Remember only the verse, songmaker`s cry, the one without tears   For I`ve given this its strength and it has become my only strength.   Comforting home, mother`s lap, chance for immortality   Where being wanted became a thrill I never knew   The sweet piano writing down my life"    &nbsp;  "Teach me passion for I fear it`s gone   Show me love, hold the lorn   So much more I wanted to give to the ones who love me   I`m sorry   Time will tell (this bitter farewell)   I live no more to shame nor me nor you   And you... I wish I didn`t feel for you anymore..."    &nbsp;  A lonely soul... An ocean soul...    &nbsp;   Nightwish, "Wishmaster"
