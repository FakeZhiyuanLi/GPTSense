Now listening to Ocean's songs, quite nice, heard tat they are going to reveal who he is in august, duno how he look like...      Den searching for patents again, now got some idea of how patents work, maybe someday when I'm free (and have $), I'll contact one of the model making factory and ask them to make a model of my idea, den get a provisional application for patent, so got time to get capital and do survey.

So queue until very behind. Met Valerie and Wei Ying, found out that they study Chemistry duno wat... but sounds very de chim. Den we had to da bao to eat elsewhere cos FC2 no place to sit. Went to a study corner and ate our lunch.      Aft lunch, we were having an Environmental Science class (ES) together with class 01, taught by Mr Timothy Loo. Very funny when he calling names cos there is a duno wat long in class 01 so he call him long ge, den there is a Shun Fa in my class so he called him fa ge. Get it? Fa Ge = F**ker. The whole class laugh until siao. Den he talk and talk and talk until I almost fall asleep, luckily he let us off early...

        Today got up ard 7.30am, had to reach sch by 9am. So I left home ard 7.55am, reached the bus stop, bus 74 came... wah kao, full of ppl. Saw bus 165 behind so decided to take it to AMK mrt station and from there take mrt to dover. On the mrt, I discovered that all the stations from cityhall to dover take about 2 minutes each. I'm almost late for class, which is very lucky cos just aft I stepped into the design studio as Mr Idris is taking attendence, my name is being called... haha lucky for me but poor Raymond, he is late by about 20 secs or so...       Den we went to the duno wat place to have a common briefing. Mr Idris brief us about a project tat we have to do... blah blah blah... aft tat we went back to the design studio, our home base, to start doing the project work. Everyone has to draw something and try to distort it by moving it when photocopying it. I drew a pic of my digital cam, digital cam cover and my hp. As we are only required to do one, I decided to use my drawing of my digital cam.       Den lunch time, our group (Xin Hao, Raymond, Meme, Victor, Jun Qing and me) went to foodcourt 3, wah... full house, so we went to foodcourt 5. Eating KFC... so expensive, mac more cheaper... all of us bought Zinger meal. Den aft lunch, we went back to design studio to collect a sheet of notes given by Mr Idris. Had to try very hard not to fall asleep when Mr Idris is talking about the notes. The contents of the notes are very chim loh, a lot of words dun even noe how to pronounce...       Aft reading the notes, we went to photocopy our drawings. Went to a shop but the photocopying machine cannot reduce the size... ap. Den we went to the library to photocopy. Had to go back by 4pm so by the time we finish photocopying, it is minutes to 4 so we just take all the copies and rush back to the design studio.       Aft sch we went to the library again to photocopy some more, cos they say theirs is still not nice. So they photocopied some more, by cashcard no $$$ liao, so had to top up the cashcard but the auntie who is supposed to be at the counter went for toilet break. Think she stuck in the toilet bowl cos we waited for almost an hour for her to come back.       When the auntie came back, the cashcard couldn't be topped up cos nobody had ATM card, so Xin Hao and Victor went to borrow cashcard. Waited very de long for them to come back. While waiting, the rest of us talk with a senior about our course, he say until like very stress like tat. Aft they came back, they continued to photocopy some more and by the time they finish, it was almost 6pm liao.          Transport taken today: Mrt, bus 165, bus 74      Feeling: Sianz      Thoughts: Think about Her again... haiz... saw her online den suddenly disappear liao...

        Today had to exhibit our sketches and the photos we took during the past few days. Reach school at 8.45am, Mr Chandra said the common briefing for both class 01 and 02 starts at 10am, ap -_-''      Then Mr Chandra and Mr Idris started briefing us at 10am+... talking about all the same old rules... going to fall asleep -_-...zzZ Saw a spider on the ground while they were talking and after a few minutes when I look at the ground again, the spider was gone.      After that we were separated into different groups (same group as the Chinatown trip) and sitting arrangements. Wow, each of us get a desk to ourselves, haha, the desk is so big ^_^      Then we were asked to write reflections on the sketches we had done... sooo boring... I just write whatever I can think of and the air-con is so cold (16 degrees) that we had to go to the toilet to warm ourselves. Speaking of toilet, the male toilet near W15 is very 'smoky' cause everytime I went in, there is cigarette smell.       After about half an hour of writing, finally finish. So we went to look for the photoshop (which was very far from W15) to help print our photos, but due to some problems, we had to go back (a long long way...) to look for Mr Chandra to help print our photos. Went back to the Multimedia Lab and saw him... because there are no papers in the printer, so we cannot print out the photos. So after all this walking and walking and not eating lunch, we just wasted our time.      In the end, we had to make do with the 5 pictures we had. Went to see sketches of other people... I very de Zi Bei, all draw so good one... my one like cartoon... *_*      Finally can go off liao, me, Victor, Raymond and Jun Qing went off first, leaving behind Meme and Xin Hao. On the way past the sports hall, I sign up for the Chess Club, hahaha... -_-''' mad... den went to eat KFC. I went off first cause I'm going back to eat and I went over to the sports hall first to sign up for the Chinese Orchestra. Originally I wanted to join the String Ensemble but the practice is on Mon (5-7pm) and Tues (7-9pm) so quite troublesome and it would be very late when I got home.      Played bball at night again, today got bo, jd, kp, kh, jh, wp, zx, wh and me playing. Went to the court and saw people kicking soccer again... O_O# hate those who kick soccer at basketball court, everytime has to change place. But today got more people playing bball then soccer so not scared of them. Met the two guys from yesterday and a few more other guys. There are 14 of us so had to separate into 4 teams (3,3,4,4). We selected the captains (jd, kh, bo and one of the guy from yesterday)So the teams are choosen - Team 1: The two guys from yesterday and a muscular guy, Team 2: Bo, a very big guy and a guy in red shirt, Team 3: kh, wp, wh and me, Team 4: jd, kp, jh and zx.      Team 1 vs Team 2: Team 1 won. Team 3 vs Team 4: Team 3 won. Yay. Then final match, Team 1 vs Team 3: we won, hahaha ^_^ After that we decided to play full court, 7 on each team -_-''' (Team 1: Two guys from yesterday, muscular guy, wp, zx, kh and jd, Team 2: Red shirt guy, bo, wh, kp, jh, an tamil guy and me) alright it is a bit confusing when we just started playing but it is still very confusing after we've played for some time. ,,_-_ Team 2 loses and another team (those who are playing soccer on the court) challenges Team 1. Wh then went to hp.      After the lights went off, we went to buy water and sat down to talk again, wh came with xx later on. Some policemen came to ask us about some malay guys... blah blah blah. We continue talking and talking and went home.         Transport taken today: Bus 74     Feeling: Very full

        Today is performance day, had to meet very early, also had to wear white colour shirt. After meeting with the class, we went to the concourse to rehearse some more. Then the performance starts, our class is the fifth to perform. There are a total of ten classes.      Alright, it was our turn to perform. We went to the center stage and began hitting and banging. After that we bow to the judges and went back to our seats. Then they announce the top three best performance, the first to announce was "The return of the chewing gum". Then the second to announce was "Debamboo". At that time our whole class just went silent because nobody in our class thought we would win &_&, including Mr Chandra. Than the third to announce was "Storm". We got an envelope and inside it was $50. Haha, Mr Chandra said he's going to give us a treat next week.           After the whole performance thingy, it was time for lunch. What's more, lunch was provided - buffet style! Hahaha, food was very very nice and yummy. Drink was very very de sweet. After eating, a group of us went to search for the chess club again. Then we play weiqi for about an hour, in the end don't even know who won cause everyone in the club is going home and they had to lock the room, so we just have to stop playing. Then we went to the sports hall and continue playing a few games of chess. Then me, Xin Hao and Meme went to look for Mr Chandra to print out some pictures we took on tuesday in Chinatown. Mr Chandra said we had to come back an hour later so we went off first. On the way to the sports hall, Meme met one of her friends and talk for a long long time. Me and Xin Hao also wait for a long long time. Then we two went into a stationary shop and when we came out, we didn't see Meme. So we went to the sports hall and on the way there, I went to collect my concession card while Xin Hao went to look at the Wushu CCA. I went home after collecting my concession card.      Playing bball today, so long didn't play le. Got jd, kp, kh, jh, bo, wp, ws, zx and me playing. After everyone arrives, while we were opening numbers, got two guys ask us if they could join us so with the eleven of us, we had to play full court. The teams were decided, kp, kh, jd, ws, jh and me on one team while the others on the other. Maybe too long didn't play le, becoming lousier, two opens also cannot score... haiz... then leg also pain. Halfway playing it started to drizzle, luckily it's just a small drizzle. Then the lights went out, nobody take note of the score... -_-'' Ws and wp went back first while jd, kp, kh, jh, zx, bo and me went to buy water and talk talk and talk before going home.

        Today another long day... so tiring. Thought that we were supposed to meet at the multimedia lab but didn't see anyone there, later on then know that the whole class is at the design studio. Haiz... tomorrow doing performance, Jonathan came up with the idea of creating music using bamboo stick and Mr Chandra came up with the name "Debamboo" as our group name. So we started planning for the performance.      After that we went for lunch and then we went to the concourse to rehearse for a few hours till when Mr Chandra said he's going for a meeting and told us to continue our rehearsal. It was then that a whole lot of us got out to walk around the school. I went with Xin Hao, Raymond and Jun Qing to see the CCA openhouse. We then went to search for the chess club and finally found it. Then I saw Simon also in the chess club, haha, finally saw someone I knew. After that we went back to the concourse to continue the rehearsal. A lot of the bamboos are split by all those hittings and banging. After hours of rehearsing, finally can go home, yay!

        Alright, today going to chinatown, but has to meet Mr Chandra at 9am at the URA building. Met Xin Hao at Tanjong Pagar Mrt station. Walked to the URA building and waited for everyone to reach. In the end when the whole class has reached, Mr Chandra still haven't appear. Then at 9am sharp, Mr Chandra appear... Ta da!      Today we have to split into groups of 5 or 6 to complete some tasks. Me, Xin Hao, Meme, Raymond, Victor and Jun Qing formed one group. Then we went off to complete the tasks. Our group split into two groups - Me, Xin Hao and Victor went to take photos of the URA building while Meme, Jun Qing and Raymond stayed at the URA building to sketch and take photos of the "Coin" - A huge twisted coin which is displayed outside the URA front door.         After me, Xin Hao and Victor finish taking photos of the URA building, we went on to take photos of some shophouses. After that we went back to the URA building and only saw Jun Qing and Raymond sketching, don't know where Meme went. So the 3 of us also started to sketch the twisted "Coin". Then Meme came out from the URA building, it seems that she has gone in to find some information about the tasks we were supposed to do. After that we went to the location of the last task. Then we went searching for some shophouses which looks similar to the picture which has been given to us.                 We search and search and search and search and after about 1-2 hours of searching, we still couldn't find it. We saw a man selling ice-cream so we went to buy from him. Mmmm... it was so delicious. After eating the ice-cream, we continue searching. After about one hour of searching, we came across a Indian shop and Meme went in to ask about the address - Stanley Street No. 10, which she had writen down when she was searching for information in the URA building. The Indian man drew out the way for us so we went on searching for that street. Finally, after turning around corners and walking a very long way we found the shophouses which are exactly the ones in the picture. Haha ^_^ so happy we finally found it.      We took photos of the shophouses and then Meme, Xin Hao and Victor went to ask about some questions while the rest of us waited outside. They came out from the shophouses and it appears that they didn't get the answers to the questions. Then we realised the answers we need were already all copied down by Meme while she was searching for information in the URA building. All we had to do now is to sketch the shophouses and we finish all our tasks. Halfway sketching, it started to drizzle, luckily there was shelter above us so we could continue sketching. It seems that we were the only group managed to find the exact shophouses as the picture. The other groups just find some other shophouses which looks like those in the picture.           After sketching, the drizzle also stopped, so we went for lunch. I ate a plate of chicken drumstick noodle - $4 and a can of sarsi - $1. After eating, we went to find the Indian man and took a photo with him (well he helped to finish our task). Then we went to the place where we were supposed to meet Mr Chandra but didn't saw him so we went back to the URA building. Back at the URA building, we didn't see anyone else so Xin Hao called Mr Chandra and he said that we could go back home already... ap. It began to drizzle as we were walking towards the mrt station...      Went with my mum and sis to hougang mall at night to buy new jeans and shoes. Then went home to watch Guess Guess Guess ?_?         Transport taken today: Mrt, Bus 74, Bus 147     Feeling: Tired

        Today is the first day of school and had to reach LT1A(A) (wherever it is) by 8.30am. So had to get up very very early... so tiring -_-...zzZ      After I reached the Lecture Theatre, the teachers then talk talk talk       After the whole lot of us took bus 166 to a bus-stop near the park, it started to drizzle. Then while we were walking halfway to the park (which is so very very far away from the bus-stop), it started to rain... heavily. Got drenched by the rain #_#... ap rain. Then the whole lot of us had to stay in a semi-circular shelter to wait for the rain to stop.      Finally the rain stopped, Mr Chandra (Personal tutor for my class) took us to another small shelter and asked us to sketch something. So we left our belongings in the shelter and went to look for something to sketch. I walk and walk and walk and finally I found the beach. Then I started sketching the sea and when I finish sketching, I don't even know what I'm sketching @_@ then I went back to the small shelter to meet with Mr Chandra, he asked us to collect 2 interesting things from the ground... but another teacher said the park is a nature reserve so cannot take anything out from the park *_*. So I went photo taking with Meme, I took photos of almost everything interesting - 2 men fishing, a very creative looking thing which shows the direction the wind is blowing from (don't know what is it called), the clouds, the sun, the waves.                  Finally it's lunch time, paid $3 but the food wasn't very nice. After lunch we were supposed to meet at another point. So I went searching for that point, there are three points on the map and I thought our class was supposed to meet in the center point. So I went to that point and when I reached there, I didn't see any people from my class so I went to the point on the right and when I reach there, it was still not the right point. So I walk and walk back to the center point and asked one of the teachers. She said that it should be around the point on the right. So... -_-'' I walk and walk back to the point on the right and still didn't see my class. Again I walk back to the center point and then I saw my class. So we were supposed to meet at the point on the left -_-''      Our class was divided into different groups and we had to sketch again... sianz. Our group decided to sketch about the pollution of the sea. So I sketch the sea... again... then I saw my friends sketching, wah, so pro...      Halfway while we were sketching, it started to rain again... ap. Then we were stuck in a small shelter... again... waiting for the rain to stop.         At last the rain become smaller, we started to walk to the bus-stop outside the park (which is so very de far away). Waited for a long time for the bus to come. Finally got back to sp, went with Meme and Xin Hao to collect the Freshmen Package. Reach there then they say need to wait until 5pm then can collect, so ap. So we wait and wait and started queuing at 4.45pm. Wah the queue become so long at 5pm. Luckily we queued earlier. After collecting the package, I went home while Meme and Xin Hao stay in school to eat.         Transport taken today: Bus 74     Feeling: Very tired

        Haiz... time really flies very fast. Saw on friendster some of my pri sch friends' pic, they really change a lot. I think even if meet on the street also cannot recognize them... Among all my years of schooling, I find tat pri sch is the best, I really like my pri 6 class a lot. All of my pri 6 classmates are the best. On the contrary, I feel tat the frenship formed in poly won't be as close as those before poly, well, at least tat's wat I think for now. Scott Adventry is still the best! ;D      By the way, I found 2 of my pri sch classmates in frenster, both not in contact for abt 7 yrs already. So happy to be in contact with them again. Read christine's blog 2day, makes me think about the love between 2 person. Does true love exists? Well it reminds me of a movie I've watched some time ago - Love Actually. It's a great movie, the different love stories are also very interesting, one of which is tat a guy likes this girl, but his best fren is getting married to her, and he didn't tell her tat he likes her. He keeps avoiding her whenever she is around, which makes her think tat he actually dislike her. In the end, his best fren is married to her and he confessed his feelings to her during christmas eve. Here's the scene: It was christmas eve, he pressed the doorbell, the girl went to answer the door. He stands outside, playing christmas carols sung by children on a radio, and he is holding some cards with words written on them. His best fren asked who is at the door and he hold up a card, written on it was to asked her to say tat it was juz some christmas carols singers. Den he changed the cards one by one, confessing his love for her, but she is already married to his best fren. Tat is a very touching scene. There's a quote from the movie - "True love lasts forever". Is tat true? Maybe yes, maybe no...      Talking abt 2day, finally handed in our primer 2 drafts, sketches and mock-up model. Haha, so tml dun need to go SP to hand up. But den next week onwards shd be very busy cos going to do the actual installation, cadp and presentation slides... hope our budget can still remained at $0. Haha, den ES sure get A+.      Played bball at note again. 2day got a lot of ppl, 10 - bo, dz, jd, jh, kh, kp, wh, wp, zx and me. So rare tat so many ppl playing bball, but only played a few matches only, so sianz, everytime ask 8pm den 9pm den all will reach... haiz... anyway, my skills become lousy liao, shooting also duno how to shoot liao... now is 3.51am, must sleep liao, tml still need to go back sec sch...         Feelings: Sick     Thoughts: Hope my blocked nose can recover soon...

Love cannot be explained, it is a wonderful feeling, a moment of impulse. Me becoming more gong liao.

        2day finally went to watch Stella's performance at the auditorium, received a goody bag and inside it was the genki tea she advertised. The whole place was filled with ppl, saw tat she actually quite tanned, but her song's very nice. There's interaction with the audience as well. Took 50+ pictures but all very small leh, sit too far away liao. So few ppl go and get her autograph, like only less den 100 ppl, was thinking of buying her album for only $16, but no extra $ so didn't buy.     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink       Anyway, for the primer 2 thing, still not very much progress, hope can finish in time loh. I was beginning to think about wat kp said few days ago, renting a stall and sell things.
