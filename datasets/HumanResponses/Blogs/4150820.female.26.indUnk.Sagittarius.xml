       urlLink MSN Careers - 6 Business Lessons From Martha Stewart - Career Advice Article : "And in the end%2C she risked her billion dollar empire to save %2443%2C000 in a stock trade."  Wow. That's rough. Out of all the reports I had heard about the story I don't think that I ever caught how much she was losing on the stock trade. Hardly worth it.

       urlLink MSN Dating & Personals - Young women, same old problem : "And, for some men, there�s the fact that these young girls look up to them � as father figures and as mentors. That, in and of itself, is very attractive.�"  Gosh ladies!! If you are dating an older man for the father figure-ness, than you need your head checked. Ewww. I'm so over being told what and when to do something. I would ring the neck of a man that played that card.

      I got the photo albums from dad this afternoon. Perfect timing for the board's baby picture contest. Scrapping them will be my winter project. I have a lot of sorting and cropping to do. I know that I'll be busy.  Talk about TONS of memories. And some, from earlier in my childhood, aren't things that I recall but it's neat to see me at different stages.  It's been frustrating trying to find a job. I get so down thinking that I have this college degree just wasting away and at the same time paying for it through my student loan, which I'll be paying for till I die!! I drive by a MCD's some times and see the NOW HIRING on the marquee. *sigh* How can jobs that require an education not be available, but one that a monkey can do is?? I'd do retail before I do MCD's but damn it, I'll work there before I starve or ruin my credit. Thanks George. Speaking of the Prez, I think that AT&T outsources. I was getting the run around during a problem I was having with them and none of the customer service reps spoke clear English. WTF!! They had Indian accents (Indian with a dot). Not only did they screw up my request but I couldn't understand half of what they were saying....so should I be surprised that it got messed up in the first place? If you've got AT&amp;T test it out and call the customer service number. I'm boycotting AT&amp;T now. *Hmpht*

       urlLink MSN Dating & Personals - 7 habits you need to break : "Aimless whistling This is an especially insidious habit, because most itinerant whistlers aren't even aware what they're doing � until, that is, they notice the people around them desperately trying to claw open windows and jump out. On the other hand, if your new squeeze is an incorrigible hummer, the two of you just might be made for each other."  What super anal person wrote this article. Whistling is a line in the sand of romance? Since when?? Now singing the incorrect lyrics to a song, maybe, but whistling?

       urlLink Accuser files civil lawsuit against Kobe Bryant; experts say it could cripple criminal case : "said their client was owed money for pain, 'public scorn, hatred and ridicule' she has suffered as a result of the alleged attack last summer. "  This is just rediculous. I can't believe the grounds under which someone can sue another person. She is suing him because there is a question of her moral standing...and the American public may know that she is a slut. Hmmm...whose fault is that may I ask.   I wasn't in the room with these two but I have to question the character of a woman who would go alone in a hotel room of a married man... and not just any man, a successful and famous one. I guess I would make a poor juror for the prosecution. It's sad to know that in a day where the information about what is need to prosecute a rapist is out there and this woman may have failed to gain enough conclusive evidence to put her attacker behind bars.  I have to say that I'm not really on this girl's side. But, on the other hand, I'm not totally on the side of Bryant. He was so in the wrong for even putting himself in a position like that. He too has failed to learn the lesson set forth by other superstars.

      I had the most vivid dream about my ex this morning. Complete with sexual tension and disapproving glances from my father, who was also in it.  I don't need a book of dream explainations to see what this one means. *egads*  I put up a few things up on the walls in my office/craft room/girls only abode. *laughing* Made a difference. I need to get a few more things up and make it look finished in here...but I'm horrible with picking that kind of stuff out...nervous about putting colors and decorative stuff together. Strange right?  My neighbor got me back in the mood to scrapbook. She sells Creative Memories stuff. I'm a few years behind. This would be a good time to get caught up. I asked my dad to send me our albums. He has about half of the childhood pictures of me and my brothers. My mom has the other half. I think that she has a lot of the baby ones. I thought it would be a good idea to get those in a protected book.

       For whatever reason I woke up early this morning and hadn't had nearly enough sleep to be up that early...so I'm kinda dragging around today.  I laid in bed and watched the 6th season of Sex and the City. I so love the show. I'm sorry it's over. There are so many moments in Part One I identify with -- hence the popularity of the show. I'm sure I'm not the only one.      Ever since I started writing and learning about writing as a craft. I watch movies and read books with a new awareness and attention to detail. I don't just sit back and let it wash over me any more...I kinda take bits and chew it up, digest the work as a whole. It's kinda strange the way my mind has started working now that I've begun to put my own thoughts on paper.

      ...in lust for something new to do.... well not really.. okay yes.  I think I'm going to take my camera to the park this weekend. This area has such good ones. And it is suppose to be really nice. I can't wait to see fall here. All the trees. Fall colors are my favorite. Getting some good reference photos for a painting would be nice. Yeah, that's what I'll do.   No voice post today. I want to see how much that last one cost me. *laughing*
