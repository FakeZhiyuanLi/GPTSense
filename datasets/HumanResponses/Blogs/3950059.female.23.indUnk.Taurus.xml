       The S&M fish tank is almost fully set up now.&nbsp; I added a bunch of new fishies yesterday.&nbsp; In addition to my existing harlequins, I now have 6 neon tetras, a midnight blue male guppy and 3 fancy female show guppies.&nbsp; As soon as I find a freshwater hermit crab, and perhaps a pleco down the road, then the tank will be completely complete.    &nbsp;  I have given one of the guppies a new porn name,  urlLink Alysia Maelene , but now I need many more names (and a way to tell all the fish apart) for the rest of the new fishies.    &nbsp;  On a sad note, Bondage Betta seems to be dying.&nbsp; He's in quarentine for now, and is showing some minimal signs of improvement, but I don't think he'll ever make it back to the community tank.

       So I randomly and sort of impulsively cut my hair today.&nbsp; I had been growing it for the last 6 years and now it's way short.&nbsp; We weren't going to cut it this short, but in order to donate hair for wigs for kids with cancer, the cut hair needs to be at least a foot long.&nbsp; So, 14 inches got cut off and now my hair is up to my jaw.&nbsp; I don't think I like it.&nbsp; It's going to be one massive pouf when it goes curly.&nbsp; I can't even pull it back anymore.&nbsp; It's so sad.&nbsp; But I guess it will grow out.&nbsp; Eventually.

       It's almost lunch time and so far today I have really done no work.&nbsp; I am at work and I am being paid to work.&nbsp; But I have done no work.&nbsp; Everyone is really quiet and keeping to themselves today.&nbsp; It's finally Friday.&nbsp; I am too sleepy to concentrate on anything.&nbsp; I'm ready for a day of nothing but lazing around.&nbsp; Too bad I'll be cleaning out closets and "staging" rooms at home so the house can be sold.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  The one thing I am looking forward to this weekend is getting my hair cut.&nbsp; After 6 years of letting it grow long, I'm ready to take the plunge and chop it all off again.&nbsp; I'm still not sure what the end result will be... I think I will just let the hairdresser do whatever he wants to do with it.&nbsp; I'm anxiously anticipating the end result.    &nbsp;  The school screwed me over and cancelled one of the classes I was really looking forward to next year.&nbsp; I spent a good chunk of time trying to pick new classes from the very limited pool of classes that aren't full yet.&nbsp; I've managed to do it.&nbsp; My school year will not be as I had planned, but it will fulfill all my requirements and I will still get out at the end.&nbsp; Barring any other unforseen bumps in the road.    &nbsp;  At this point I have very little left to say, I'm just rambling in an avoidance of doing work.&nbsp; So now I will go find some other means of procrastination.

           The fishies at work had babies.&nbsp; I salvaged 7 of them.   &nbsp;  I'm still working on fitting my own fishies with S&M names... I'm also busy looking for some kinky S&amp;M themed decorations for my tank.&nbsp; Oh the joys of long summer days with nothing more to do than think of themes for your fish tank.&nbsp; And I'd just like to say that it was my boss who came up with the S&M theme!&nbsp; I have a cool boss.

        And I'm mad about it!  I paid good money for my extra large type recycling bin to hold all my many recyclables.  I just hope that whomever the culrpit is, he or she is putting it to good use and this was not just some random act of crime on a bar night.  Now I need to get a new bin!  Bah!    But on the bright side of the world, I acquired a new book today,  urlLink  Call me Crazy       by Irit Shimrat.  It is yet another book on mental illness and the need for reform in our mental health system.  I do need to find other books that have nothing to do with my present life.  If I keep working/learning/reading about mental health, I'll end up in the looney bin myself!  But I do enjoy it.  So I shall go read.

                Well, I have finally decided to abuse webspace for my own personal   pleasure. I have no real plan for this blog so it will evolve   over time. I also have no real desire to advertise or tell people   about my own little space. I'll just let people find me if they   happen to. For now, I suppose I get the hankering for blogging   whenever I am bored or blah, so expect my own little stream of   consciousness ramblings whenever I need to think about something and have no one to bounce ideas off of.  However, now it's bedtime and I will most likely post more soon.

       I have bad dreams.  I don't like my dreams.  I wake up hating the person I am in those dreams.  They're getting much too frequent and crushing my days.

       On my way to work this morning I witnessed a man seat dancing and mouthing along to the music emulating from his diskman.      I was strangely disapointed that my own music was not as inspiring and enjoyable as his. So, I am now on a quest, a mythical and what might be a dangerous quest, to find new music that makes me want to get up and dance.      Oh, and missing the last train leaving Georgetown is no fun at all.
