      I love salsa. It's one of the greatest foods ever. If I met the inventor of salsa on the street, I would shake his (or her) hand. I'd probably even give them 5 bucks.  If I met the inventor of plastic knives on the street... well, actually, I hope it would be a dark alley, so I could beat this person up.... but If I *had* to meet them on the street, I would make them come home with me and take all the plastic knives I have in my cupboard.  I've probably used plastic knives less than 5 times my entire life. About all they're useful for is spreading cream cheese on bagels, but then they tend to be weak and flimsy... and end up breaking in your hand. I don't even know why they put those teeth on them; the only things they can cut are the same things *I* can cut just by looking sideways at them.

      Last saturday was my birthday. I turned 26. I can now assign all the letters of the English alphabet to the years I've been alive. I don't know if I should be Z years old, or A years old, or whatever... I still haven't decided.  Anyways, we had a barbeque party at my house on Sunday. Jeremy and I flew our kites, and Jeremy got his to lead out 1400 feet of string.  I think my new hobby is going to be kite building and flying... As soon as I get my patio done. And, I don't want to do those speed kites... you know, those ones that can slice someone in two. My kite flying will be peaceful and relaxing.

      The dead cannot call out for help... because they are dead. God must do the calling. God must do what cannot be done - that which is impossible. In our state, we are in an infititely deep pit, and being the finite creatures we are, we cannot call for help. God must call into being that which does not exist: life for us.  Romans 4:16,17 (NASB)  For this reason it is by faith, in order that it may be in accordance with grace, so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,(as it is written, "A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS HAVE I MADE YOU") in the presence of Him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist.

      Sometimes when I'm writing some code, I get stuck on a tiny little detail that takes at least 3 hours to work out. After that I usually feel pretty good about my accomplishment, especially if the solution is quite elegant... which usually it's not. CTRL-Shift-F... "TODO: FIX THIS HACK".  However, after the 3 hours have gone by I'm faced with figuring out what the heck I was doing before. You know, the main task at hand. If you've seen my code, then you'll know it takes about 15 minutes to get back on track (comments are for wimps).  Now, what would be really cool is timing this perfectly so that I finish the tiny little detail 15 minutes before I go home. Since I know I won't be able to get any work done during that 15 minutes, I can leave early.  ... I hope Staley didn't see that comment up there.

      One of the teachers at the junior high I student taught at didn't come to the 8th grade promotion ceremony last night. According to her, she wasn't getting paid to be there, so she didn't need to show up.  ?  You are teaching FOR THE MONEY?!?!?! I.. ah.. wha... It's not about the freaking money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's about the students!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Knowing that there are teachers like that out there is reason enough to strive to be a great teacher.

      Here is a conversation I had with Jeremy today. It is concerning coming up with a function that can predict the movement of the stock market. Some believe that such a function would be self-destructive because as soon as it is put into practice, the system is changed, and the function is invalidated. In fact, if you even tell anyone else about it, you've already messed it all up.... Good job, slick.  (11:33:57) Jeremy: I think such a function doesn't exist.. at least not for the stock market.   (11:37:17) wobuzhudao: yeah.. I've been talking to Tom a lot about markets and stuff.. he's pretty smart with it all. Efficient market theory...etc... Actually, I think a very complicated function might exist (I haven't figure how to figure God in yet), but that you can't use it or tell anyone about it.. because then it would invalidate itself.  (11:37:56) Jeremy: if you can't use it, what good is it?  (11:38:13) wobuzhudao: it's math, and it's fun.  (11:38:14) wobuzhudao: duh  (11:38:21) Jeremy: And, do you think you are the only one with a fuction?  I bet if you come up with one, then many others have one.  (11:38:38) wobuzhudao: I didn't think of that  (11:38:40) wobuzhudao: man  (11:38:49) Jeremy: and your function is already invalidated before you even use it.  (11:39:00) wobuzhudao: I'd have to account for other people coming up with functions and using them  (11:39:21) Jeremy: I think you basically just have to have inside information about everyone's bid prices.  (11:39:24) Jeremy: which is the function.  (11:39:58) Jeremy: So, you know when you buy that someone buy from you for a much higher price.  (11:40:43) wobuzhudao: yeah.. Tom explained Efficient market theory to me yesterday... basically the only way to beat the market to get insider info.  (11:41:12) Jeremy: you should do that.  It is the only way to build the function.  (11:41:34) Jeremy: hey, you might go to jail, but that is worth it for the sake of math.
