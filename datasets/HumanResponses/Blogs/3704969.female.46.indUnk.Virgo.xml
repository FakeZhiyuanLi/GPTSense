       Hi Gang!  Thanks so very much to all of you who've sent those great encouraging e-mails and cards!  I'm making myself a scrapbook of them to cheer me whenever I feel a bit low during this trek.  My MRI showed only the one cancer site, and it's nearly as small as originally suspected, so that's good news.  My surgery is scheduled for April 23.  I'm working with a wonderful doctor (a two-time survivor herself) who has loads of great "mind-body" ideas for coping and using this time as a growth opportunity.  Being diagnosed with cancer does change one's perspective on many things - an experience I'm finding interesting and positive.  (The perspective, that is, not the cancer!)  The wonderful support I'm receiving is a priceless gift, and I thank you all.  Mary

       We have some important news to share. Last week, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. The tumor site is, we believe, small, and it appears that we have caught the whole thing early. It is not especially aggressive, and it is receptive to hormone therapy, which means there's probably Tamoxifen or something similar in my future. (That's a GOOD thing!) I expect to have surgery in the next few weeks, and then radiation, and maybe chemotherapy. We're all feeling confident and upbeat about 90% of the time...I've been telling people that my full time job now is to "not get voted off the island!". I hope to learn how to put up a website to keep everyone informed of progress.  The next step is an MRI on Tuesday. Please keep us in your thoughts and prayers during this challenging time. Thanks!! Mary

       Surgery happened yesterday from about 10:00 to 12:00.  The surgeon happily reported that the three lymph nodes that were removed showed no signs of invasion by the cancer.  They still need to do the more complete biopsy to be certain of the result, but they are 97% sure that the site is clear!!!  That was the big worry, so the all clear is the best news we could have heard.  It took about two hours for Mary to come out from under the anesthetic, then they released her shortly thereafter.  All slept well last night.  Mary is sore under the arm and where the lump was removed.  She is on the couch recovering and will likely be quite tired the next couple of days.  We had crepes this morning and it looks like life will be getting back to normal soon now the weight is lifted.  Some very good friends here have volunteered to provide evening meals for the next week.  We are very well cared for!!  Thank you so very much for your support, good thoughts and prayers!!!    ...Steve

       Hi all!  'Sorry to have been so out of touch, but I evidently am not one of the lucky souls destined to "sail through" chemotherapy.  The over-acheiver in me is disappointed, but reality is hard to argue with!  I had my first treatment last Wednesday (one week ago!).  It went fine, the staff was wonderful, and Steve and I went shopping afterwards.  By that evening, (when the calendar included a soccer game, science night at Haley's school AND the middle school band concert) I felt like I had had two drinks but also the hang-over at the same time.  To make a long story shorter, I felt pretty reasonable Thursday until evening, then slept my way through the next three days courtesy of Compazine.  I'm now taking a different anti-nausea drug which seems to have less of a "zombie" effect, and am feeling better today than I have all week.  Yeahh!!!  I munch on whatever sounds good whenever it sounds good - a skill I developed during my morning-sick pregnancies.  Raw almonds, Rice Krispie bars, toast with apple sauce and cold milk seem to be keeping me going!  I also have a craving for "comfort food" like tuna noodle casserole and baked macaroni and cheese, which is not helping Steve's diet program in the least.  I think I'm beginning to understand why breast cancer is the only cancer in which close to a fourth of patients gain weight during treatment!   I had my pre-bald wig fitting yesterday, and the nearly finished product looks great.  Sadly, they still need to add a little more gray to replicate my "real" color, but they're also adding a little more blonde on top, so I guess that's ok.  Our "head shaving" party is re-scheduled for next Tuesday to maximize my odds of feeling good - that's the day before my second treatment.  If all goes as planned, my last treatment will be on June 23rd, and I hope to be feeling reasonably well to celebrate my own special Independence Day.  I am so grateful to be able to complete chemo in only four cycles.  Then it's on to radiation, and tamoxifen or something like it. One other funny story to share - Right about when the nausea seemed to be lessening its grip, I realized that I was developing mouth sores.  (Not a big deal, just like you all of a sudden bit your cheek in four or five places at once.)  I called my doctor to report this new development, and he called in a scrip for "Swish and Spit", which I felt marginally well enough to go pick up.  (I'm not kidding, "Swish and Spit" is what it says right on the bottle!)  I had assumed that it contained come cortisone or something like it to soothe the irritation, so imagine my surprise when I "used as directed" and felt my whole mouth go numb!!  "S and S" is a highly effective local anesthetic!    Those oncologists are a hilarious bunch... We've also all been enjoying our new plaything courtesy of Aventis pharmaceuticals.  Someone in the marketing department must have been having a bad day when they decided to give out plastic self-exam guides (with a handy suction cup so you can hang it up in the shower), WITH your own personal "sample breast" attached!  This thing is very soft and pliable, comes complete with nipple, and makes a very, very funny toy for those of us with compazine-warped humor.  We immediately detached it from the instruction guide, so Hanna could model it for us.  We've also enjoyed seeing it as a hood ornament, a doggy fetch toy, and a paperweight.  Your drug dollars at work!! Your calls, thoughts, prayers, and many acts of kindness are keeping me going through this - Thank you all so very much.  Onward and upward!  Mary.

       Hi gang!  Good news:  I'm feeling much better every day, and today I would put that at 85% of normal.  It feels so wonderful to approach "normal" (for me, that is...).  Other good news:  the sun is shining, and I've cast aside my "Madonna-esque" post-surgery support lingerie in favor of the more regular stuff. (That may be more than you wanted to know, but it's a very positive thing!!)  More good news:  our catered dining schedule was a fabulous gift!  We have leftovers enough for a few more days - and everything that came in the door was delicious.  Special thanks to our "culinary crew"!   On the bad news side, we learned on Friday that I will be slogging through chemotherapy, which includes lots of extra-special effects to look forward to...   The good news there is that I can take a more intense program of the stuff which I can complete in six weeks (as opposed to six months!).  That will be followed by some form of radiation therapy, which means I don't have to make any summer plans to speak of as my calendar is already pretty full!  It looks like I will have lots of time to read some good books, and the unique opportunity to tan the top of my head!    Plus, as a good friend pointed out, I won't have to shave my legs all summer!  Such a deal!!     I'm feeling brave about this, but also nervous.  Needles never bothered me until they attacked en masse here lately.  I'm very curious to see what I look like with no hair, but it's an experience I could pass by, given the option.  Ah well, it's all worth that improved likelihood of no recurrence.  Nothing like the big C to give you great perspective.  My chemo is scheduled to begin on May 12.  Wish me well.  And know how grateful I am for your support.  Mary.

       I had my last chemo treatment today!  To salute my "graduation", the nurse put "Celebrate" on the CD player as the last IV bag emptied.  Steve and I disco-ed our way out the door! We got in the car and as we left the parking lot, I pumped my fist in the air and yelled "YA-HOO!!" Then we went and had a wonderful lunch, picked up the many prescriptions I will use over the next week or so, and headed home.  Steve went to put in a little time at the office, and I decided to put this post up while I still feel good.  The "yucks" will probably descend by Friday, and may last as long as Tuesday, but then I'll be  finished  with the toughest part of my program.  They say I should expect to see some hair growing in about 2 weeks, which is exciting!  Meanwhile, I have about another day and a half to use to get stuff done, so I'm "outtahere"!!  Hugs.  M.

       OK.  I've been feeling that everyone should be able to choose whether and when they receive my news, so no more e-mail updates!  If you've gotten here, great!  This way, I can post stuff here, and you can either come read it, or not - your choice.  (Special thanks to Dann Siems for "technical support"!)   It's Monday before Last Treatment Day, which means I've been to the grocery store, the girls have friends over, the laundry is in process, and I'm beginning to dread Wednesday.  On the other hand, it's wonderful to know that I only have to "face the dragon" one more time!  Each treatment seems to take me out of action a little bit longer than the last, but I've hung in there through three, so what's one more?!  About ten days from now, I hope to be feeling fairly normal and completely thrilled to have the "chemo" phase of this illness behind me.  Then I can make daily observations to detect hair re-growth on my currently bald head - an exciting prospect.  Please leave a comment and let me know how you like my "blog"!  I feel ever so up-to-date by doing this...old, fat and bald, but up-to-date, nonetheless!

       It's here!  The day when I start to feel "normal" again after my last chemo treatment!  One arm won't bend ("bone pain", they call it), but I actually have some "oomph" and am looking forward to doing things...about 4,00 at once, I think, to cover my backlog!  I sincerely hope that this experience will help me to never take feeling well for granted again, but I know that's a big order.  The weather here is glorious, which adds to the whole euphoric sensation.  I'm also going to have a chance to visit the lake in Minnesota before starting radiation treatments in late July, which means I can deliver the girls to language camp and they'll get a chance to see their friends.  All nice, traditional, normal stuff - what a gift.   I've put on about 15 pounds with the steroids and constant eating associated with trying to keep my tummy in line during the past many weeks, and I'm eager to return to my usual body image as soon as I can...speaking of which, maybe today I should pick up a magnifying glass so we can all keep watch for the first new downy hair on my head.  Its arrival is projected for next week, and I wouldn't want it to go unheralded!  'So much to look forward to...a swim meet, a road trip, sunshine, a romantic week-end to celebrate Steve's birthday, then I'll start my "part-time job" of radiation for 6 1/2 weeks, all while we undertake a large kitchen addition on our house.  (Obviously, I'm a big believer in distraction therapy!)  I also hope to do as much as I can to help Mr Bush return to Texas (or wherever he wants to go, besides the White House) in the Fall.  Life is good.  Friends are good.  Family is good.  Health is good.  ...and I'm so grateful for that understanding.  A special note for anyone who's been frustrated trying to leave a comment:  I fear that when I set up my blog I had the comment settings wrong, but I think I've fixed it now.  Please let me know!

       No, I'm not there yet, but I can see it from here!  Five radiation treatments down, only 28 to go!  My hair is very slowly coming back, which is great.  I'll be happy to stop looking like a kewpie doll without the top curl!  While I was in MN in July, I got a baseball hat made that says "No Hair Day", so I've been wearing that  a lot.  I suppose now I need one that says "Hair Growth in Progress" or something...  It's still wonderful to wake up each day without a headache or feeling queasy, and the best part is having the energy to do things.  I still run out of that energy before the day is over, but it's a huge improvement!  The girls and I had a wonderful trip to MN.  We saw as many people as my stamina would allow...if we missed you, we'll try for next time!  It was a very restorative break from the daily routine and environment.  Steve and I also enjoyed our long week-end together on the "West Coast" of Michigan in Saugatuck for his birthday.  We saw beautiful sunsets, strolled the beach and the shops, and relaxed.  We even played nine holes of golf!  Meanwhile, the girls had a great time at Spanish Camp in Minnesota. It's hard to believe the start of school is only about three weeks away...and the end of my treatments is two weeks after that.   I've already started taking Tamoxifen, which aside from the expected "sudden temperature shifts" doesn't seem to bother me.  I've been told about a T-shirt that reads:  "I'm Still Hot... It Just Comes In Flashes!".  I can relate!
