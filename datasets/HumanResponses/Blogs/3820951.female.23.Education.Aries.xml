      marc finally came around to finishing the compilation i asked of him tonight! yay! i wish he can teach me how to burn cds though...  marco…my only brother, my pal, my worst enemy, my tormentor, and my protector...all rolled into one unique guy. would mercilessly tease me from time to time about the most mundane things! although i kind of have a feeling that he’s only doing that as a way of making  lambing .=) can appear tougher as he really is cuz of his height, size, and intimidating goatee, but he really has a softer side. one can easily tell who he’s talking to on the phone with the give-away tone of his voice.&nbsp;a quick thinker especially when it comes to snide remarks and funny one-liners. the family’s go-to guy with anything pertaining to computers and electronics. expert cd burner!&nbsp;not very expressive but you’ll see how much he cares for his loved ones with the little things he does.  pasalubong !=) looking back on how we used to fight when we were kids, i never imagined that we'd turn out to be buddies…that's why i'm so grateful for the changes...

      Evita, your Emotional IQ is 124.   This number is the result of a formula based on how many questions you answered correctly on Tickle's Emotional IQ test. But your Emotional IQ score is much more than just a number: it's an indicator of success. Research has shown that people with high emotional intelligence scores — not necessarily those with the highest IQ scores — tend to be the most valued and productive employees and have the longest and happiest romantic relationships.   So, where are you most emotionally smart? Your test results show that your strongest suit is emotional management — how much you let your emotions affect the world around you. This is not to say, however, that emotions never contribute to your decisions. At times the emotions you are having are appropriate guides for your actions. And with your keen sense of emotional management, you'll know when and where to base decisions upon them.   Research indicates that if people who are strong emotional managers can work to increase their overall emotional IQ score, they can prepare themselves to handle any interpersonal exchange with amazing skill — especially by learning to be empathetic of others and by being able to express what it is they are feeling or trying to say.

      i looove lists! so this is a first of the many i'll post in here...=) this is a list i read from a magazine my mom wanted me to look into:  What She Wishes You Knew About Her    Universal truths all men should understand about women    By Heather Buchanan (Men's Health Best Life Magazine, Winter 2004)  She'll yell at you to pick up your dirty clothes but steal your sweaty T-shirt to sleep in when you're gone.  She knows that roses seem cliche, but she melts inside when you send them to her.  She'll fight to the end to maintain her independence but fantasizes about you taking care of her.  It's cheating as soon as you're doing something with another woman that you wouldn't want her to see, hear, read...  When you do something bad and she seems cool with it, she's not.  She'd love to cook for you but fears Le Cirque does it better.  She's afraid she'll never find a purer love than her daddy's love.  When you push her hair behinf her ears and look into her eyes and hold your lips over hers, she can't breathe.  She has no idea how to be strong and still say "I'm sorry."  She can love you and hate your guts at the same time.  She longs to receive a handwritten love letter.  When you ask her what's wrong and she says nothing, she wants you to keep questioning her.  She doesn't want you to solve her problems...just listen to them.  She holds on to an inner life and her own mysetries that she does not want to share.  She'll admire a beautiful woman before you will.  She loves when you draw a bath for her without her asking.  She wants you to know the difference between screwing and making love...but still be able to do both with her.  She wants you to go out with the guys more than you do. Really, she does.  Her biggest fear is that you will die before she does.  When it comes to aesthetics, she wants your enthusiasm, not your opinion.  She watches you when you sleep.  Monday Night Football = Trading Spaces  She sides with Carly Simon over James Taylor.  She wants to know that you are vulnerable to her feminine wiles.   She'll retreat into the bathtub so you won't see her cry.  She wants you to celebrate her moves, not say, "Wow, you dance like Veronica - you know, from Archie."  Baby talk good; dirty talk better.  She likes expensive floral arrangements when you screw up (and when you don't).  She wants you to probe her nightmares and make them go away.  She'd like it if you dueted "Summer Lovin'" with her at a karaoke bar.  She'd love you to get into a bar brawl to defend her honor.  She thinks about sex more than you do.

      this quote made me think long and hard...  'in friendship, as in love, we are often more happy from the things we are ignorant of than from those we are acquainted with.' -fracois de la rochefoucauld  ain't that true from time to time?  maybe that's why i'm terribly enjoying my relationships (friendships and romantically-inclined) these days...i'm ignorant in some aspects as i am immersed in the experience of knowing these people...i just want them to know that they're opening up worlds in me i wouldn't be aware of had they not come into my life...and i'm a better person for having known their thoughts and sharing in their lives.  to the people who matter, i value you.

      This is an excerpt of Kel's reaction from the testimonial I gave him... You're welcome Kel...and as your blog name says...It's true! It's true!=)   .:Grateful:.  From Evita, one of the relatively new people I've been chatting with during the show...   kel…one of the most interesting guys i’ve met in a while…an articulate and funny dj (wave 89.1 must feel so lucky to have such a dependable and well-liked staff in him). prolific and deep writer (be prepared to allot a day reading his musings on blogspot cuz you won’t be able to resist perusing his entries, go kel bell!). very charming and down-to-earth. no pretensions whatsoever which makes him all the more fascinating (his being transparent is so refreshingly adorable, it’ll do people more good to acquire the same attitude). passionate about the things he loves the most (such as his friends, his work, his writing, and his beliefs). ambitious (palanca-bound!) and intelligent (why is he studying philosophy you ask? he’ll tell you this: “i love to learn more…to gain better insight of what it means to be human, to revel in one’s highs and lows and plateaus”). intriguing right? hope to see you soon kel! thanks for the usual morning chat...take care!=)   What I really noticed is that the parenthetical remarks really gave even more punch than the non-parenthetical comments. I like it! I like it! :D  In any case, what I like about the testimonials I've been getting as of late was the fact that they've been giving me insights about my personality that I never even saw. With people who tell me how much of an "open book" I am, I realize that in spite of my being quite a loner and a recluse from time to time, I still manage to show that I'm far from being... anti-social. I'm just surprised how spot-on people who've never met me in person can sometimes be about their testimonials, although the funny thing is, in spite of the nature of my being a DJ, since they know me more through my chatting than through my being on air, they tend to know my "serious" side better than my not-so-serious side... but that's all good. Inasmuch as they can't capture my entirety, neither can I capture mine, anyway.  Thanx, Evita! This really made my day.  ::: It's True! It's True!

      Kel wanted me to read this piece he did on his take on relationships...He told me it'll be long and it is...I will need a day to react to all of this...so for now...I'm proposing you read this and be prepared to agree or disagree with the points presented...Kel, you really are something!&nbsp; &nbsp;   .:Justified:.  This seems to be in line with how I once wrote about Grace, which further tells me why I write little about her. There are so many things that are already given when it comes to me and her that there really aren't too many new things to talk about. We've more or less hit a comfort zone quite like most long-term relationships already. This is not to say that this is it for keeps, but bah Gawd, you have to admit that it's pretty ruddy close to that already.I realize that I don't seem to write about my girlfriend as often as people expect someone who's been with her for five years to. It's as though I'm asked to make it a focal point that “hey, look, Marcelle's taken!”, as though the way I ought to define myself is solely by how I have been dealing with Grace. &nbsp; But you see, I'm sure Grace wouldn't appreciate being defined as “Marcelle's girlfriend” as though she were some piece of property whose existence is dependent on the acknowledgment of her relationship with me. Neither do I feel comfort in feeling that I have to be compelled to write about her when there simply is nothing to particularly compelling to write about. Some would say that in my eschewing from writing much about her, I deny her recognition, but others who know better realize that it simply goes without saying. I don't have to overtly display my affection for Grace to prove that I love her. I don't have to call and text her every single minute to remind her how much I care about her. We see lots of couples who are so giddy in front of one another. Couples who make us squirm and mutter under our breath that they ought to “get a room”. Not to downplay their sweetness and all, but was their display ever a guarantee that they would last? I didn't think so, either. &nbsp; It is quite clear that in doing what I do, I don't want to be defined by the relationship. Rather, I want Grace and I to be the ones to define the relationship. Inasmuch as being “best friends” with someone could at times be relegated to proximity, so is loving someone, when the need to be defined by the relationship arises. Why limit one's self to being defined by a relationship when a clearly better alternative stands in the first place? This explains my recent departure from fixation with titles, as I have simply stopped obliging people to call me their “best friend” if they do believe me to be such. It's an exercise of constriction that is slowly but silently corrupting the very essence of what a particular kind of relationship ought to be. Besides, such titles of “my love”, or “my best friend” hold no guarantees if the person who bequeathes these words simply has no sense of commitment. Oh, yes, one can love, but can he really be committed? However, commitment is not my topic of the day, and as such, I shall save that discussion for some other time. &nbsp; I'm hardly the most romantic person in the world. Just about anyone who's known me before I got together with Grace can tell you that. I'm not being jaded or cynical about love because if I were, then what the Hades am I doing still in this relationship? However, I am a realist, and in being one, I cannot fool myself to live in a dream world, telling myself that love will pay the bills, and love will make me go and move beyond everything. Love is beyond a mere feeling, contrary to what The Darkness might believe. It's not just about the highs and lows of it, the “oh, we are so happy” bits of our relationships and the “oh, I need someone to hold me right now” moments conversely. Like any long-term relationship (Hopefully it ought to be long term...), love is going to find more plateaus than peaks or valleys, and these plateaus are exceedingly important in making or breaking a relationship. When “nothing much” becomes the order of the day, is love simply going to fade away?  &nbsp; It's not always going to be a honeymoon, nor a Pierre the French fighter pilot kind of a picnic, nor is it always going to be gloom and doom. When the non-happening moments come, they will be more crucial to the longevity (or lack of it) of a relationship in that chances are, there will be more plateaus, anyways. The fact of the matter is, we cannot possibly ignore that people seem to miss the point about getting into a relationship and define it as a case of loving someone because they need that someone. Rather, loving is the cause for needing. And even then, it becomes ridiculously clear that either person is well capable of living without the other, yet at the end of the day, they don't choose to say that they love anyone except that single person whom they decided to love. &nbsp; What is one's motivation for love, anyway? To make one look like “the man”, in the case of the trophy girlfriend? Plain companionship, which relegates your partner to being a dog? Intellectual discourse, which relegates your partner to being an encyclopedia? Charity, which relegates your partner to be some kind of an institution? Lust, which relegates your partner to a... let's not go there. When one looks at one's motivation for love and sees any answer that's remotely dubious, then it's high time to question if this love is genuine to begin with.Why love, anyway? Some (Like those who just loooove quoting that Mr. Callassanz urban legend.) would ask back, “why not?” But there are a million and one reasons for a person to not love another.  &nbsp; Maybe there's no attraction. Maybe there's no chemistry. Maybe one is not comfortable with being treated like a god or a goddess and being worshiped all the time. Maybe one wishes to fulfill something they see to be far more worthwhile than loving another in a romantic sense. Maybe one feels the time is not yet right. Does that mean that if one can successfully answer the question “why not”, then the motivation for love disappears? Of course not! If it did, then it's quite hard to understand how couples who fell in love over one another's looks still continue loving one another when all that external beauty has gone. If it did, then Nancy Reagan would've had no reason to stay strong for her late husband who completely forgot who she is every now and then.  &nbsp; Ergo, and I know I've said this a million times already, the answer is not “why not”. Perhaps, the better answer would be: Why ask why?Why do I love? Why ask why? I love because love is my motivation. I am blessed with a wonderful human being, among a myriad of wonderful human beings who touched my life, and yet I chose her because I chose her. Perhaps I never even chose to love her, but love chose me to be with her. Would it be forever? That's irrelevant to the point. Is it logically, rationally correct? Love moves beyond the realms of logic and rationality. If I could give a good reason why, then the negation of this good reason why I should love Grace will simply tear me away from her. I love her because I love her. It is for its own sake, and not for that of another.  &nbsp; Is it the perfect answer? I cannot guarantee it. Is it right? It feels right. What if I'm wrong? Then I live and learn. And so, with nothing but the certainty of uncertainty to guide me, why do I love? Why ask why? Why ask why, save for the fact that in asking yourself why, you discover for yourself that there really is no reason to ask why?In love, no matter how grizzled, no matter how uninitiated one may be, there will always, and I sure as Hades mean, always be a method to the madness. Ask not why. For the answers speak for themselves. I love Grace because I choose to love Grace. Why do I choose to? Because that power is what inextricably makes me and the one whom I choose to love, very much human.  &nbsp; As a human being, I am far from perfect, but the consolation is, I know that I can be so much more. I realize the same thing follows for her. In the final analysis, after all has been said and done, that unfolding of being that happens in this kind of relationship is simply something no amount of rationalizing or analysis could possibly make heads and tails out of. Why I do what I do is justified because I do it for the sake of doing it. As such, I bask in this small truth's consolation: that while very little is sure in this world, I am sure that I am making a choice, wrong or right as the case may be, for the right reasons.Think about it, jabronis. :::"

      last night in class, dr. reyes mentioned to us that writing and publishing a book may guarantee us a royalty of almost 1.3 million every year! take note, every year! she has a friend who wrote a series of books for children and earns the said amount for her published work. and according to dr. reyes, her friend goes on vacation abroad with the whole family each year and each one of her kids owns a bmw...all these just from the royalty she gets from the books! hmmm...seriously thinking of publishing a book for pre-schoolers now...  i went to powerbooks today to look at the storytelling books i'm considering for my thesis. my aim is to establish a reading list of storytelling books with positive family values for pre-school children ages five to six. although i'm thinking of just focusing my study on one book and trying to see what values are presented in the stories. when i went to powerbooks, i saw these disney collection of storybooks and they're so amazing! i would have bought the whole collection if i only had the money! they're all hard-bound and all the disney cartoons and movies ever created are in the said collection. there's the princess treasury which has all the princess stories (of course!) and then there's the classics collection and then there's the adventure collection (featuring the disney pixar movies of toy story and monsters, inc.) and so on and so forth. the two volumes i would have to get for my thesis are the family story collection since i'm focusing on positive family values...both books amount to 1,600 pesos already...gosh! i have to save up for those! and aside from that, i also wana get the care bears storybook collection which i think costs around 500+. it was really a delightful surprise seeing that care bears book because that's the primary cartoon i remember from my childhood! i also saw strawberry shortcake and my little pony of which i had stuff and dolls of the said characters when i was a kid. i really want to buy those books for my collection...and of course to someday pass on to my children...i hope they grow up to be lovers of books like i am...i'm going to guide them to be as such...  i wasn't able to chat with kel this morning...sad...  and i haven't heard from rich too...as we had some sort of a rift last night about his ever-pending visit here...  oh well...i think it's going to rain soon here...kinda dark outside...

      speaking of lost friendships, this song indicates pretty much how all of us feels when we lose a best girl or guy friend...even though it's a break-up song, the thought's the same, you miss the kind of person that you were when you were still best friends...  the man i was with you - jimmy bondoc  listen just hear me out  yes i know we agreed  when we break up we'd never give in to this need  to admit to each other  i miss you   listen just hear my cry  no i won't break my word  if i do say i miss you it would never be heard  let my heart whisper  all that it needs to   *how could you make me take a start?  then just leave me here hanging  can't even say how i'm feeling  how could you make then break my heart?  if i can't say that i miss you  let me say one last thing   #i miss him  and all the things he could do  yes/oh, i miss him  just as much as i miss you  oh, i miss him  i know you're wondering who  yes, i miss him  i miss the man i was with you oh i would never be the same   listen just hear my voice  can you hear all the tears?  that i'm planning to hide  for the next thousand years  just as long as you know that  i love you   repeat *,#  except last line  how can i blind then find the light?  how can i find the kind of right?  how could you take away my sight?  how could you lose me in the night?  then you took away the heart in me  now i'm losing this fight  no i would never ever be the same   ooh.. ohh   oh, i miss him  and all the things he could do  yes, i miss him  just as much as i miss you  oh i miss him  i know by now you know who yes, i miss him  i know by now you know who  i miss him  i miss the man i was with you   oh, i would never be the same

      chatted with kel again this morning...  the guy's melancholic since a close friend will be leaving for japan soon... at first i couln't understand what he was trying to say to me and then he asked me this: "have you lost a best friend before?" and of course i have...it felt terribly heartbreaking to feel someone special slipping away from your life...i've had my share of losing friends...but nothing can be more hurtful than losing a bestfriend...that's because with a bestfriend, you really share your life and all your thoughts and all your dramas...and to lose contact with that being who's accepted you and loved you with all your eccentricities...it's just heartbreaking...  i do know what it feels like to lose a best friend...

          I hope you’ve seen the flicks Bridget Jones’s Diary and About A Boy so you’ll better understand what I’m trying to say. Nevertheless, I believe my points are pretty clear even if you’ve never read the books or seen the movies. Just want to share my thoughts…     I thought it was Bridget Jones all over again. But this time, Bridget was male, ironically played by Hugh Grant, who also played Daniel, Bridget’s jerk of a boyfriend in Bridget Jones’s Diary. It’s no secret that Bridget, along with Ally McBeal, has become an icon of female singlehood, carrying the angst and the pain that comes along with the search for the right man. In the movie About A Boy, based on a novel by Nick Hornby, Hugh Grant plays Will Freeman, a singleton who is out to prove he is bloody Ibiza, a small island lying 90 kilometers off the east coast of Spain, in the Western Mediterranean and can survive on his bloody own.      “I used to think I was pretty cool. I didn’t mean anything, about anything to anyone and I knew that guaranteed me a long, depression-free life,” he said. Ibiza indeed. Will was on his own and from the looks of it, he was doing fine just by himself. That was until he met a boy who made him feel like he may not be so fine after all. While Will thought being unattached was pretty cool, Bridget thought being single was a curse. Will was also probably bothered by his single state, but, like most men, he refused to admit it. Bridget showed us single females how to laugh at how ridiculous we sometimes act as an effect of being alone. Despite the subscription to the usual fairy tale ending, she showed there is light at the end of the end of every tunnel. If that light turns out to be a special someone or finding peace in oneself will really depend on the person.     Bridget and Will have certain similarities. Both were single, thought aloud, and counted in quids and units. Both made us laugh at ourselves. But while Bridget released her angst by writing in her diary (which is what I also do), Will vegged out in front of the television. While Bridget strategized about getting a man to commit, Will strategized how to shag a girl without the consequence of a commitment. Bridget confused work with her love life; Will did not even have to work at all.      There are certainly differences between the single male and the single female. Because I am female, I cannot write much about how single men think. The opportunities for me to get a single man to talk about singlehood are rare. Most of them try to avoid the discussion, like singlehood is not at all an issue even. I get the general impression that males are more comfortable with being single than their female counterparts. They seem to be less worried about finding the right woman. This is probably their recurring fear of commitment allows them to desire something other than a serious relationship with the opposite sex.      A guy friend of mine said with all the opportunities afforded single men and women nowadays, he believes he could survive and be happy with single life. Of course, one of those opportunities he was referring to was the fact that some women nowadays are not too keen on having serious relationships anymore. To him, women have evolved into creatures that would go for one-night stands, like the men have been doing all this time. “At least now, you can have a casual relationship and not fear that the other party will haunt you for it,” he admitted to me. He loves the freedom from responsibility so much so that he has a lot of girl friends he’s “friendly” (read: sexually active) with and not one of them is committed to him.      Honestly, I really did not know if I should throw up or thank him for making me think of all these stuff on singlehood, sex, dating, commitments, etc. On one hand, I do agree there are more opportunities now for single people. On the other hand, I resent the almost chauvinistic remark about how women have changed over the years, as if the change occurred only to please men. Single people, especially women, now have more choices to consider. Some decades ago, their choices were pretty much limited to getting married or being a social disgrace. Single people can now have the opportunity to find fulfillment in knowledge, work, leisure, politics, or even spirituality. Also, there’s more entertainment now than ever before. It would not be too hard to entertain oneself through the new media and technology we now enjoy.      The main choices, however, still remain. You either get married or be a social disgrace. But at least now, you have more chances to be happy even if society deems you a disgrace.     I, however, resent the articulated perception that women, because of the so-called “liberation” movement, have become as casual about sex and relationships as men. Well, sadly, I think that perception has a tinge of reality. In a good way, I believe this behavior somehow lessens their obsessive desire to find a partner. But in a bad way, it also lessens the importance afforded to them by the opposite sex. I am not going to preach about what is right and what is wrong. At the end of the day, we must be responsible for the choices we make and the acts we commit. If a woman does not want to be treated like a sex object, then she better stop acting like one. And if a man wants to be treated with more respect, then he’d better achieve a modicum of maturity.      Men and women approach single life differently. Women tend to be more concerned about being judged by society and not being able to find the right partner. Men tend to see it as a freedom from responsibility. But I recognize that some men are just as worried as women about not being able to get married in this lifetime. In fact, some of the few single men I talked to about singlehood are more scared of growing old alone than the women. One of them even conceded that women are stronger in dealing with aloneness because men, culturally, have always been taken cared of, if not by their mothers, their girlfriends, or their wives. After all, they are expected to provide for all the women.      Women, on the other hand, were brought up to please men so that when the time comes, they will be good wives and homemakers, whose financial needs will eventually be provided for by their men. Because they were brought up to care for others, then taking care of themselves becomes an easier task.     I do not, however, think that one gender is more or less than the other. To me, males and females are equal but they still have different roles to play. Who plays the role is another matter. What was interesting about the flick About A Boy was that it gave us a whole new perspective of single life, this time courtesy of a single male. It allowed the audience to peek at a single man’s mind for a change. Unlike Bridget Jones, it didn’t highlight the romantic relationship as the solution to all of single life’s problems.     Single people could actually exist without desperately aspiring for marriage, like it was the sole source of happiness and contentment in the universe. The movie was not about finding true love, which is the theme for most movies about single women. It was about finding people and meaning in life. It was not just about a boy. It was about making sense of single life.

      what a day!  i haven't gotten a decent sleep ever since monday because of the thousand things i had to do...and still i'm not yet done with everything...i'll be so so so happy come sem-break...  today in the montessori training i'm having, we took the edwards personal preference psych test..this is actually the only time somebody explained to me what the results meant (even though i've taken it around 10 times already, i think)..but now that i know, i'm not sure if i'll be happy or not..the overall test result is 85% reliable..i'm an achiever (as expected), dominant, and wants to be taken cared of (so true!). but then it also said that i'm not sorry for my wroingdoings and that i'm not loyal to my friends..i know i'm loyal to my friends for one thing. that's why considering that the interpretation was 85% reliable, i'm having mixed feelings right now....  after the long exam and interview with the head principal, i wanted to unwind so i went to buy my toiletries at makati supermarket..while i was paying for my items and thinking of how i'll go home if it's raining hard outside, dad called me and said marc's in the area that's why i can ride home with him. so i texted marc and he passed by the supermarket's entrance to pick me up. i'm just so glad he can now do things like that for me. i used to be very jealous of him since he's the only one among us dad will ever trust our car (and even our SUV) with..even though i took two (yes, two!) sessions of driving lessons and now have my driver's license with me..i think when i'm given the chance to finally drive, i might need a refresher course again..sad really..i already learned the skill but i wasn't given the opportunity to practice it..=(  still, i'm really thankful marc was there for me when i needed him this afternoon..  now, i have to go back to typing papers..another early class tomorrow..gosh..  evitz can hardly wait to get some decent sleep and much-needed pampering..

      as the title goes, i have a gazillion papers to write..  this morning, during the montessori training, we realized for sure that our fellow trainee who cried yesterday because she got ribbed by our trainor, will not be back anymore..which is really sad as she was already one of the very few who made it past phase 1 of the application..lots of other hopefuls would have done great things with the opportunity given her..i guess her ego was really hurt that's why she quit just like that. our trainor said she was just challenging the girl who suddenly didn't show up, she should have been open to suggestions since it was for the trainee's own improvement. anyway, to each his own, right? i just hope that that person who suddenly left realize that criticism doesn't necessarily mean negative criticism, it can definitely be constructive criticism (which is really how i always remind myself to see it every chance i get). and more often than not, that's the purpose why it was given to you in the first place, to help you along the path of realizing your best self..  every one in my class seems to be afraid of ms. alcantara, the head of directresses (who is also our very commanding trainor)..i would hav reacted the same way too had i not taken my first term of master studies this term. the lessons with ms. chichi are really helping a lot..it's just so wonderful i can recite and talk with confidence now than before when i'd rather blend in the background. yes, evitz is working on improving herself and is very excited about this work every day and night!  the papers i have to make before the week ends: album for maria montessori psychology classes, DAP for saturday, thesis proposal revisions also for saturday (ideally), and the developmental profile of the preschool child, Ashley..

      gosh i so missed writing here!  i'm missing chatting with certain people too as i have been terribly busy with MA classes and my whole day training sessions at montessori. not that i'm complaining, i'm actually very thankful for the opportunities which seem to be coming my way these days..so very thankful..  just wish i have multiple selves where one can focus on all my requirements for my MA classes, one which will do my assignments for my training classes (yes i have assignments for my montessori training! i feel like i suddenly enrolled additional courses! but as this is the job i'm aspiring for, i can only do my best and pray i'll survive..ah well..), one to finally really fix my things and room, and one which can do all the relaxation and sleep for the other parts of me...  i have a couple of papers to do tonight but i couldn't let another day pass by without writing here..having this blog has more than provided me a way to continue my writing but to also keep track of the thoughts i'm having and the events happening to me..this is really great for me..  yesterday, mom made marc buy certain grocery items before we had our dinner. erik and i went with him and kept him company while he drove. erik pointed out that it's amusing to see that each of us has a particular favorite series which matches our personality, according to her...marc' can't stop talking about the ingenuity of the concept behind the series "24", erik's one of the biggest "CSI" fans you'll ever meet, and me, i've been longing to have the dvds of the six seasons of "Sex and The City"...does that mean i'm into sex? hmmm...  dad drove me and erik yesterday morning to our respective places of destination which i thought was just so nice of him..considering he was on vacation and could have slept in late(we were already on the road at 6am)..and then we found out from marc that dad did the same thing for him too when it was time for him to go to school (around 8am)..and that was just sweet..  today was my second day of montessori training and it was..interesting to say the least..one of our trainors (actually the head administrator of the school) criticized one of the trainees for using words which the latter didn't know the proper meanings of..i hope she's fine now as she was crying on our way home and was telling us she made up her mind to quit already..i think she was just rattled by our head's straightforwardness..that'll be so sad if she quits now..

      i was trying to manage my email inbox by erasing useless mails when i came across this list... it's a list of some very beneficial instructions for life...(i think i've already said before that i love lists so here's my second posting of such kind). i hope whoever gets to read this will seriously consider following even just one instruction...for his/her own life improvement.=)  evitz will sincerely follow items 1, 4, 13, and 17.  .: I N S T R U C T I O N S  F O R  L I F E :.  1. Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk.  2. When you lose, don't lose the lesson.  3. Follow the three Rs: Respect for self, Respect for others, Responsibility for all your actions.  4. Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.  5. Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly.  6. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.  7. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.  8. Spend some time alone.  9. Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values.  10. Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer.  11. Live a good, honorable life. Then when you get older and think back, you'll be able to enjoy it a second time.  12. A loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation for your life.  Do all you can to create a tranquil, harmonious home.  13. In disagreements with loved ones, deal only with the current situation. Don't bring up the past.  14. Share your knowledge. It's a way to achieve immortality.  15. Be gentle with the earth.  16. Once a year, go someplace you've never been before.  17. Remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other.  18. Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it.  19. Call your mother.  20. Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon.  We convince ourselves that life will be better after we get married, have a baby, then another. Then we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough and we'll be more content when they are. After that, we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. We will certainly be happy when they are out of that stage.  We tell ourselves that our life will be complete when our spouse gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, when we are able to go on a nice vacation, or when we retire.  The truth is, there's no better time to be happy than right now. If not now, when? Your life will always be filled with challenges. It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway.  Happiness is the way. So, treasure every moment that you have and treasure it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time with...and remember that time waits for no one.  So, stop waiting....  - until your car or home is paid off - until you get a new car or home - until your kids leave the house - until you go back to school - until you finish school - until you lose 10 lbs. - until you gain 10 lbs. - until you get married - until you get a divorce - until you have kids - until you retire - until summer - until spring - until winter - until fall - until you die  There is no better time than right now to be happy.  Happiness is a journey, not a destination.  So...work like you don't need money, Love like you've never been hurt, And dance like no one's watching.

      just came from testing and interview with maria montessori school in ayala alabang...  i'm kind of tired and hungry (because the school does not have a canteen, the principal said it's because canteens, most often than not, only sell junk food) but at least i'm one of the few who made it past phase 1 of the application process..yay!!!:D even got a compliment from the principal as she said i was "very bright" while looking at my transcript of records and test results. (though she noticed i did not do well in math..my usual waterloo..oh well)  big big smile on my face...considering there were about 30 guys an girls when we started this morning and i'm one of the very chosen 5 people who made it through..i'm just sad for the others who tried out their luck but weren't as lucky as the ones left..i had very fun and good conversations among each of the girls i got to know..maybe i'll run into them again in the future..it's a small world after all (as one of us established, realizing that a couple of the applicants knew some of her close friends from school or work)..  a girl i got acquainted with today said i looked familiar and was trying to place where she knew or saw me..just seems odd to me as i have been getting that comment almost all the time, and no matter where i am or who i am with..hmmm...  anyway, my week-long training starts monday, 7am to 4pm..have to be at red ribbon alabang town center at 7 so i can board the shuttle going inside the village and into the school..so excited actually..yay! this is definitely one of the most positive feedback i've had in a long long time..=)

      i am so glad les is a very good and reliable friend...he's always been like that to me anyway. but i so appreciated him last night when he and arf passed by school after my 9pm class ended, just so i wouldn't have to commute alone. and it was raining at that! and he came from ateneo rockwell so i'm really really thankful i can always rely on him like that. he more than makes up for not having a car by making sure i got inside our house safe every time we go out. thanks les!

      both my parents want me and my sibs to move out when we get married. no buts and ifs about it since they say we have to learn how to be independent. my mom said it'll do us good when we start our married life in our own place so that we can feel that we really have moved on to the next phase of our lives...
