       Ok, i dunno what to put here, so i'll write a story.. yes, that seems in order.  Once there was a little boy called Adam. He liked whistling and singing and all things musical. He especially liked the guitar and vocals.  One day, he met a girl called... Jane. At first they hated each other... completely drove each other up the wall. That's why Jane stole his guitar. Which Adam got a little bit annoyed about and ripped her dress. Then things got  real  bad. --censored-- And then jane moved away. Which was just as well because Adam had been planning to set Jane's house alight. Fifteen years later, Adam moved away too. And Jane moved away from where she moved to after meeting Adam.  Perhaps it was fate.. or perhaps it was because they had dodgy estate agents.. but whatever the reason, they managed to end up in the same district.. and even on the same road.  "Oh my God.. Adam Levine?" "What?" "It's me, Jane!" "Jane?" "Jane Cai." "Wha..?" "I stole your guitar in 4th grade?" "My guitar? Errrr..." "Oh never mind." Jane didn't think anything of it. But she hadn't really expected him to have gotten so... fit. Which is why she didn't dream about him, or him and his guitar, or him ripping her dress that night... Not at all! **A week later** Adam runs up to Jane as she sets off to Sainsbury's. "Jane Cai!!!! I remember you!" "Really?" "Yeh! You know, I had a major crush on you in 4th grade.. right after you stole my guitar. In fact, right up to when you left really," he says, blushing.  Jane didn't want to admit it but she did too. Right after he tore her dress.  Part 2 coming soon.

       "I'm so bored," says Jesse, sprawled across the grungy brown couch, which looked like it once been white. "Let's watch Wimbledon," suggests Adam. "I heard Henman's through to the final!" says Mickey excitedly. "Can't wait to check out his le - I mean, his moves. Moves. I was not just about to say legs. Moves. Ooh Lilo and Stitch! Can we get the DVD?" "I was thinking more of practising our songs. Our recording session didn't go too well yesterday." Jesse grunts. "Oh come on," says Adam, dragging himself off the armchair and making his way to their practice room, which they have padded with bits of sponge, cushion and bubblewrap to avoid the neighbours from complaining. "Nnnng," comes the grunt from Mickey, who starts to claim that somebody has stuck his bottom to the floor. "Oh Mickey get your lazy ass here and get on that bass," says Jesse, rolling off the couch and attempting to roll right into the practice room.  "I told you already! I'm stuck to the carpet!" "Oh you lazy old git," says Jesse, coming back to grab Mickey by the ear and drag him over to the practice room. They start playing. "Why aren't you playing or singing?" Jesse wonders.  "In case you hadn't noticed.." ".. Hey, wait a minute, where's Ryan?" "...Ryan is not here and we do not have drums backing, and you and Mickey are out of time. And Mickey seems to be playing Pop Goes the Weasel." "Doo doo doo doo," hums Mickey, jutting his head forwards and back (rather like a chicken) to an unknown beat. "So where the hell is Ryan??" demands Jesse. "Dunno. Call him on your cell phone," suggests Adam. "OK." "Well what are you waiting for??" Adam says irritably after about 5 minutes of watching Jesse fiddling with a thread on his trousers. "Don't have a cell phone." Adam heaves a huge sigh and buries his head in his hands.  I cannot believe I am stuck here with there loons,  he thinks.  It's a wonder I haven't cracked up yet.   "Well then call him using the regular phone!!" Adam yells.  "Adam, keep your wig on! I think.." Adam shoots a glare at Mickey who immediately shuts up.  Why do I live with a bunch of weirdos??  There is an awkward silence, after which Jesse creeps out quietly to use the phone in the hallway.  "Please stop looking at me like that," says Mickey quietly, his sanity curiousy returning to him.  "Sorry," says Adam, quickly averting his eyes to his guitar.   Everything is so fucking fucked up. Ryan isn't fucking here. Where the fuck is he? We can't do any fucking thing without the fucking drums. Jesse is fucking getting on my fucking nerves. Mickey has lost his fucking sanity. Jane fucking caught me with Malpreet. I don't even fucking know who I fucking prefer. I wish all this fucking fucked-up-ness would fucking go away. And I can't stop fucking swearing. Even in my fucking head.  I'm full of regret For all things that I've done and said

       "Hey," says Ryan. "Oh, hi," says Jane, jumping.  He has a real knack of creeping up on me.  "Latte?" "Yes thanks." Ryan buys the lattes and they go to sit down. Ryan smiles at her.  Uh, cool. So his smile is nice. Please stop smiling. "How have you been?" "Hah, still trying to get over last night really." "Me too," chuckles Ryan. "You have no idea," says Jane.  Oh crap, did I say that out loud? Now he's gonna ask..  "How do you mean?"  Great.  "Well, it was nothing really. I bumped into someone. That's all." "Oh really?" says Ryan distractedly. "How about you?" "Oh same old same old.. Mickey my housemate is being a weirdo as usual..."  "Cool, you live with other people?" "Yeh, three others. We're in a band." "Cool," says Jane, rather intrigued. "Yeh, Mickey's a bit strange sometimes, but I have to admit, his quirks are funny too."  Jane starts to fall asleep.  Maybe I shouldn't have asked him about his housemates. God.  "...Jesse found some random chick and Adam... actually, I don't actually..." Jane's ears prick up.  Well, there's gotta be about 10 million Adams in the world.  "...But I think he did, he was that guy with the drinks. Told him to get over some girl. I think she dumped him or something. You know, I'm not too clear on the whole thing myself. I think he knew her since childhood, something like that... I think that's why he got so upset about the break-up..." "I see," says Jane, clearly not seeing.  "Mm hmm." They just sit there drinking for a while.   I wouldn't call it an  awkward silence.  It's kinda nice with him. She's so pretty. I wonder when we have to start recording again. I hope Mickey hasn't eaten the letters again. He has a thing with paper and card. I can't wait! Oh God this is where all my dreams come true. I can't believe it.  "Woohooh!" "What?" "Sorry, did I say that out loud?" "Yes..." "Well I'm really happy because our band got a record deal!" "That's great!" "We've been waiting so long..."  OK, don't bore her already Ryan! She doesn't want to know about your band and whatever. Ask her about  her.  "So, um, what do you do?" "Oh, I'm the manager of a company." "Wow, that's cool. Really cool." Jane smiles. "What does a manager have to do? I never knew what exactly they had to really.." "Haha, not much! I have to go into the office most days, paper work and calling people up sometimes, but my secretaries do that. I don't even know some of them! I have to have lunch and coffee with 'business partners' and people, but other than that, I just lie around.. I'm a normal person, as you can see!" "That must be so cool..."

       "Gimme some toast." "Make your own." "I'm scared of the toaster." Adam looks at Mickey boredly. "What? Really! I am! I saw a programme on the Discovery Channel about it!" "We don't have the Discovery Channel." "OK, well I saw a programme about this toaster that was a time machine and then the guy died and his dog got buried alive," says Mickey, scared. "Well the toaster is NOT a time machine and you will not DIE and you don't even HAVE a dog," says Adam irritably. "You never know." "Fine. But you're getting the butter yourself." "But the fridge could be..." "I don't care Mickey." "But -" "Just eat the toast." Enter Ryan. "Nice morning today," he says brightly. Everybody kind of just grumbles a bit.  "I met a girl called... actually, I can't remember her name..." says Jesse, shrugging. "I met a girl called Bob," says Mickey thoughtfully. "Actually, I'm not that sure that was her name..." "I met a girl called Malpreet," says Adam soberly. "I met a girl called Jane." Adam's ears prick up.  Can't be her,  he thinks.  But she was at the party. Might have been her.  "Anyway, I've got to go soon, meeting someone soon," says Ryan.

       Jane opens her eyes.  Huh. I'm at home now. Cool.  She rubs her eyes.  Woah.. I feel tired. And headachey.  Sits up.  Woah. Damn partay. But I only had a few sprites.. ah well, sprite has the effect of ecstasy tablets on me I guess.  She drags herself out of her bed, disgusted that she hadn't changed to go to sleep the last night and is still in her mini and low low low top. She goes to shower.   Why have I got some number written on the back of my hand?  she wonders. She decides not to wash it off and carefully tries to preserve it. When she comes out, she decides to make up for last night by wearing a long sleeved shirt and the baggiest trousers she can find.  She picks up the phone and dials.  "Hello?" "Hello? Who is this?" "It's Ryan."  Oh, so  that's  who it is.  "It's Jane." "Oh hi. Hi."   What am I supposed to say now? I can't just say "Oh I just phoned to find out whose number I had on the back of my hand". I'll have to invite him somewhere or ask something. Oh God. Help.   "I erm... do you wanna, do you.. I-I.. no, I mean.."  Crap crap crap think of something.  "You wanna have coffee some time?"  Saved!  "Yeh, that would be great." "Starbucks in about an hour?" "That's good." "OK, see you then then." "Bye." Puts down phone.

       "Sorry." "No, it's all OK," says Adam. "It doesn't matter." "Were you two going out?" "I guess.. maybe we were. I dunno any more. Hmm..." "I didn't know that you..." "It doesn't matter. It's not your fault. Don't worry. It's nothing. This is normal. It's fine. All fine." "Are you sure?" "You're a beautiful girl Malpreet," he says, smiling.  Malpreet blushes, even redder than she already is. Adam isn't red at all.  He's so cool. She's so nice. Why did Jane have to come in and spoil the whole damn evening?? How was I supposed to know she was gonna be at this party? I guess it doesn't matter. She'll get over it. I think. I'm not good with these things. Ahhh! Doesn't matter. Ryan was right. I should be over her. I'm over her. Yeh.

       Janey backs out of the door. Turns around. Starts walking away.  Don't run. Walk walk walk. You're in heels anyway, wouldn't want to trip up now would you? Walk walk walk right away.  So she walks.   OK. I am gonna kill Malpreet.  She stops walking.  Wait, why should I? She's the one who hasn't done anything. And really, Adam hasn't done much either. Because I've been doing the same with Ryan. Well... we aren't really making out but..  OK, so just relax. That incident in the loos.. That was nothing. Nothing to worry about. What am I doing, thinking about it??? It was perfectly normal. Normal normal normal for a guy like Adam to get off with some girl at a partay. Because any normal guy would do that. He's normal. If he didn't he wouldn't be normal. And that wouldn't be good would it? People should be normal. OK, stop thinking about normal. Is it even normal to think about being normal??

       Each person's account ---- Jane opens the door to the Ladies'. As she steps in, she sees a couple making out.  Haha,  she thinks.  Wait a minute... is that Malpreet? Hehe, well I'm glad she found somebody.  "Malpreet!"  Perhaps I shouldn't have said that so loud. Disturbed her maybe. Ripped her away from this new guy she's found.  Malpreet and the guy pull away from each other, and turn to look at who called out Malpreet's name.   Wait, I know him. Where's he from?  "Jane..." the guy says.  He knows me. I must know him too. Oh my God, it can't be...  "Adam."  Of course it is. Who else looks so sexay in that way? This isn't funny. I'm gonna kill Malpreet.  ---- The door of the Ladies' opens.  Great, I'm making out in the women's loos. Oh well, who cares who sees me?  "Malpreet!" somebody says.  Well this is just great. Her friend's come in to do the whole "ooh who is this/can you introduce me/ooh how is he/tell me all the details" thing. Or exchanging lipsticks or something like that.  Adam and Malpreet pull away and look at the person.  Oh my God, that's...  "Jane..."  It's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her. What the hell am I even doing here??  He thinks suddenly.  This is not funny.  "Adam." Jane stands there.  Frozen.  ---- The door of the Ladies' opens.  Hmm, I guess some people do actually come in here. I hope it's not one of those weirdos that just come in here to cry. That would completely ruin me and Alan's lil thing we got going on here.  "Malpreet!"  What? Who is it? OK, we're pulling apart to stare at the new girl. Oh, it's...  "Jane..." says Alan.  Wait a minute, how do they know each other? Oh well, doesn't matter. Wait, am I missing something here? What's going on? Why is Janey looking so..  "Adam."  Who? Is this guy called  Adam ?? Why did he not tell me that? I've been calling him Alan all night! Oh my God. OK, something is definitely going on here. They are just staring at each other like mad. This can't be good.

       Jane laughs.  Ryan is so funny,  she thinks "Tell me another one," she says. "Ryan shakes his head and laughs. "I'll be right back," says Jane, getting up and heading for the Ladies.

       malpreet puts down her drink and sighs  I'm all alone,  she thinks.  Nazrene's got james, Shivani's got Charlie, Philippa's got Matt and Janey's got that random guy. Who have I got? nobody.   And then magically, as if somebody had heard her cry, somebody came and sat next to her. "Hey," says he. Malpreet doesn't realise he's talking to her. "I'm Tom," he says, and Malpreet looks up. "What?" she says, defeaned by the noise. "I'm Tom," he yells. "Oh, hi Dom," she says. "I've had 17 beers," he says proudly, grinning. Malpreet smiles, with no clue of what this guy is on about. Suddenly Tom falls off his chair, unconcious.  Oh my God,  thinks Malpreet. She gets off her chair, turns around and is about the run away when she walks straight into somebody.   Oh great,  she thinks. Then she sees his face.  Oh my God sexaaay!!  "Sorry," she says, and adds, "I'm Malpreet." The guy replies with something but she can't quite hear it. He repeats it and she deicdes that he is saying "Hi, I'm Alan. It's OK." "You wanna get away from the noise," yells Alan, pulling her somewhere quieter. Malpreet feel a strong urge to kiss him. She hopes Alan does too. She takes him by the hand in search of somewhere away from the rest of the partay.  Here's a room.  She opens the door find none other than Charlie and Shivani involves in some rather passionate kissing.  Woops.  And immediately shuts the door.  The next door along is the Ladies.  This'll do. nobody comes in here anyway.  And in they go.

       Someone comes rolling towards Adam. "Hey man!" it says. "Mickey??" "Hey, where'd that chick with the red top go?" says Mickey, getting up. "Dunno. Off somewhere with her friend," replies Adam, shrugging. "You let go of her? Sounds like somebody needs some friendly bacteria!" says Mickey, whipping out a Yakult. Adam laughs and shakes his head. "Are you still thinking about Morcheeba?" says Mickey knowingly. "Who's Morcheeba?" says Adam. "Oh you mean Jane?"  "Yeah whatever, Morcheeba Jane, Jane Morcheeba, same thing..." The two sit, watching the party. Then a girl comes over and sits next to Adam. Mickey's eyes brighten and he goes to sit next to her. "Has anybody ever told you that you look like Emma Watson?" he asks her in his "romantic" voice. "Is that meant to be a compliment?" she says disgustedly, and consequently turns to Adam. Adam is shocked upon seeing her amazingly beautiful face and nearly does the whole open-mouth thing again. "I'm Adam," he says. "I'm Jess," she says. And before he can stop himself, "Want a drink?" "Sure," she says, smiling. "Just a Coke thanks." "OK."Adam leaves and gets the drinks. On his return, Mickey is gone, but there are mice drawn conspicuously in chalk on the wall. "Sorry about Mickey, by the way," explains Adam. "He gets a little... excited, sometimes."  Jess smiles nervously. "So," says Adam. "You having fun?" "I'm thinking it could get a little better," says Jess suggestively. "Oh really?" says Adam, amused. "Yeah." Jess moves up until she is right up against him.  Oh my god. Am I sweating? I'm sweating. This can't be good. Sweat isn't good. Why am I sweating? This guy is sexaaay! OK. Not quite as sexy as his mate, that Mickey guy, but I'm hardly gonna admit to liking  that  weirdo.  She's so beautiful. Wow. I think he likes me. I hope he doesn't try to get it on too soon. I always seem to attract superficial, shallow man-sluts.  Eww. He's sweating. Um. Shall I move away now? I don't want my new top to get wet... Jess moves off.  What should I do? OK, she's slowly moving off my arm. Did I scare her? Oh god it's the sweat, isn't it? It's always the sweat. It's cos of that advert, "All girls prefer dry men". That's what it is. I knew I should have gone and bought some Lynx.   "Well I'll see you sometime. Would you like my number?"  Play it cool. Cool is the word. Or funky. Funky could be the word too you know. Shut up Mickey voice! Where is my Ryan voice? So. I want her number. Can't seem too desperate though, don't want to seem like a man-slut. Ok, breathe. Then say "Um, I guess" casually. Ok, go.  "Um, I guess," says Adam casually. "Ok, here you go," says Jess.  Woah, she has phone number cards? Posh! But I guess she's quite rich. That's good I guess. Jane's rich too though. Cool. I attract rich girls. That means rich dads.  Jess leaves.

       "Heeey," says a random guy, swivelling Nazrene around by her shoulder. Nazrene looks horrified.  "Oi! She's with me!" says James, grabbing Nazrene round again.  "I am indeed," Nazrene giggles approvingly. "Aw come on man, share!" says the guy, trying to grab Nazrene back. "You made me do this..." James pulls Nazrene back and whacks the guy around the head. Nazrene smiles proudly. A crowd has started to form around them. "OI!" yells a blonde. "That's my cousin!" "Oh my God, is that Hilary Duff?" somebody says. Hilary flicks back her hair and says smugly, "The one and only." "I don't care if you're Hilary Duff or some tramp with a dog who wants to steal frappuchinos! This has nothing to do with you," says Nazrene, rather annoyed that Hilary stole her thunder. "What do you mean it's got nothing to do with me??? My cousin just got whacked because of you!" Meanwhile, James and Hilary's cousin are snarling at each other. "Well then it's between him and James! You have no right to be involved. Why are you even arguing with me?" "Hmph. Because." "Because what? Cos you're a celebrity?" "No!" says Hilary, aware that half the partay is watching her. "Because... erm..." "Attention seeker." "UH!!! Man eater." "What??? Ignorant cow." "Loser." "Moron." "Freak." "Wannabe." "Slut." "BITCH!!!" And thus, Hilary receives a giant slap across a cheek. "Aaaaahhh!!!" yells Hilary, who unwisely decides to jump onto Nazrene. Nazrene chooses to go for the hair, while Hilary blindly attempts to scar Nazrene with her fake nails. We are afraid the rest is --censored--

       "So are you from around here?" "Well, I'm from Kinkayston," replies Jane. "Really?" says Ryan in wonder. "I live there too!" Jane smiles. "This partay's erm, good," she says, watching some guy (who is in fact Mickey) slide across the floor and into a table leg. "Yeh." They sit in silence for a while, drinking.  Damn she's hot. Damn he's hot. I wonder what she thinks of me. But not as hot as Adam. Or is he? I must stop thinking about Adam. Is my hair right? But I can't. I'm going out with him.  I wonder if I'll pull tonight. But it was just one dinner I guess. Does that even make us "going out"? She smells nice. I wonder where Adam is.  Maybe it doesn't. Does that mean it's OK for me to think about how sexy this guy is? I hope he's getting loads of girls. He's getting too old too quick. Life's too young to find "somebody speical" yet. He smells nice. Well actually he doesn't, but I'm sure he does normally. And Jesse and Mickey... They are just strange. But Jesse normally ends up with some girl clinging onto him anyway.  This silence isn't so bad. Wow, even awkward silences with him are good.  Ryan smiles at Jane.  And he doesn't do that freaky teeth thing.

       "Where are you from?" asks Red Top. Adam thinks she is getting a bit too nosey for her own good.  She's just trying to be friendly,  says the Ryan voice in his head. "Kinkayston," replies Adam, feeling stupid as he says the strange name. "Really?" says Red Top, rather intrugued by the name. "I'm from Kent." "Oh really," murmurs Adam, not the slightest bit interested.  "Yes. I had to travel about two hours to get here you know, because my dad took the Mercedes and I had to get the train." "Oh." Red Top finally shuts up to emit a high pitched giggle. Adam cannot figure out why she is giggling. "But you know, Mike's my brother, so I thought I just had to come. I didn't think he had so many friends though. I mean, how do you know him?" "Ermm," says Adam slowly.  Who the hell is Mike?  "He's really a friend of a friend, really." "Oh I see. Would you like me to introduce him?" "No, it's alright, really, I've been introduced already, I think." "Oh OK." Adam sits there with his drink, not saying anything. Another girl comes over and whispers something in Red Top's ear.  "Oh my god. Really? I have to know all about this!" Red Top exclaims and says to Adam, "Sorry, I have to go now. Maybe I'll see you soon. Can I get your num -" She gets yanked away into the crowded by her friend.

       "Wooh! This is gonna be one rocking partay!" screams Shivani above the noise of the music and other people screaming. "Well you're all right, you've got Charlie," grumbles Malpreet. "Let's go get drinks," suggests Nazrene. "Damn, the free ones have run out." "I don't want a drink yet," says Jane. Philippa has wandered off somewhere with Matt.  What am I doing here?  Jane wonders. "Don't worry, some hot guy will find you," says Nazrene psychically. Jane has grown used to this now.  I don't want some hot guy to find me. I want Adam.  "Well you can't  have  Adam right now. He's not here." And it isn't long before a hot guy finds Jane.  "Hey," a voice purrs (God that's disturbing). Jane almost jumps out of her skin. "Hey," the voice repeats. Jane turns around. "Err, hi," she says, managing to smile. "Can I get you a drink?" "Um, yeh." He walks her over to the drinks. He grins at a guy who has his head down and two drinks in his hand. "What do you want?" "I've have a Sprite." He looks at her strangely. "I mean, erm, Sprite with vodka. Yuh." And so he gets her the Sprite.. with vodka, and gets himself some random drink.  "You look great," he comments.  Oh my god he's hitting on me , thinks Jane. "Thanks." "What's your name?" he asks. "Jane," she replies. He laughs.  That makes two of us then, Adam,  he thinks. "How about your name?" "I'm Ryan."

       "Oh no. Techno makes me hyper. Somebody help me," says Mickey nervously as he steps into the partay. "This place isn't bad," says Adam, catching some blonde's eye. "Looks like it could fall in any minute though," inspects Ryan. "Hey look! Free Pringles!" exclaims Jesse, who runs off immediately and isn't to be seen for much of the night. Ryan grabs some beers and he, Adam and Mickey sit down on a couch.  "Woah, that girl is totally checking me out!" exclaims Mickey. "Dude, that's a man with a ponytail." They sit, just downing the beer, watching more people pile in. Then they realise that all their beer has gone and there is no more free beer left.  "Damn," says Adam.  The three pick themselves up and head towards the centre of the crowd. A guy with a moustache elbows Mickey in the stomach ("ouff") and a girl in a red top smiles at Adam. "There you go, i saw that girl smile at you, now get over that Jane already," says Ryan gruffly. "It isn't like she  dumped  me," replies Adam rather annoyedly. "Just get her off your mind OK?" "Jeez, you were the one that brought it up..." mumbles Adam. Adam follows Mickey and Ryan wander aimlessly through the crowds. Suddenly he feels a hand on his wrist. "Hey," says the girl with the red top. "Er.. hi," says Adam awkwardly. She grins at him... rather provocatively in fact. "Go buy her some Pringles," says Mickey into his ear. Adam looks at him.  "Sorry, I meant get her a drink, not Pringles." Adam looks hopingly at Ryan, but he and Mickey have already gone and anyway, Ryan probably would have shoved him into the girl.  "So...?" says Red Top. "Ermm..." Red Top looks at Adam hopingly. "Err... do you want a drink?" Red Top's eyes brighten. "Sure." Adam wanders over to where he thinks the drinks are, but then realises that it's just a big poster advertising Budweiser. He nearly even walks into it. Sheepishly and hoping that nobody has seen him, he wanders off to another corner to find a drink.

       Jane steps out of the Jeep. How did Nazrene talk her into wearing a mini? And a veeeery low cut top. With lacy bits. Must have been partly Shivani's fault too. And Malpreet's. And hell, Philippa's too.  She watches as James, Nazrene, Charlie, Shivani, Philippa, Matt, and Malpreet climb out of the Jeep.  How the hell did we all fit???   Nazrene doesn't quite make it out of the jeep well though, and trips and falls on her face.  "WOOOOOOOOH! LET'S GO PARTAY!!" scream Shivani and Nazrene simultaneously. (thank you lucy) "I'm just psychic," says Nazrene knowingly to Shivani.  Philippa cuddles up to Matt and Malpreet wanders off somewhere.  "Let's go," says Shivani, literally bouncing.

       "Whose party are we going to again?" Jesse wonders. "Mike's." Jesse thinks. "Who's Mike?" "Who knows?" "Who cares? There'll be hot chicks and beer!" "Adam, this is where you'll remember what it is to be Adam again." Adam burps. "Can I drive now?" asks Mickey. "No." "But I haven't drunk ANYTHING." "I know, but you're alive, and that's a hazard to anyone." Mickey scowls. "You can just stay in the back and do your dot-to-dot porn." "Wahey! Well I suppose that's just as good," says Mickey excitedly, whipping his pen out. "Are we there yet?" wonders Jesse. "Nearly. It's in some random deserted old town hall that nobody goes to any more." They pull up at a rusty building, with music blaring out, kind of making the whole thing vibrate. "We're here."

       Jane waits by the phone all morning.  When is he gonna ring me?  She decides to watch CD:UK.  What am I gonna do if he doesn't ring me? He had better ring me. I wish I knew where he lived,  she thinks, unfortunately unaware that he lives only across the road.  You know, that tattered old Ford looks rather familiar. I think it was at the restaurant.  But as Adam's car was "around the corner", Jane thought nothing of it.  She rings up Nazrene. "Hello?" "Hi Naz, it's me." "Are you coming then?" "Erm.. yeh. But Adam isn't." "Why not?" "He hasn't phoned me yet. And I don't have his number." "Ah well. You can come alone. Get off with a few guys..." "I can't do that!" "Hmmm?" "I'm with Adam." "So? Ah well, suit yourself." "Where is it then?" "Can't remember. James is picking me up, so meet at mine and you can come with us." "OK. See you there." "Bye!"

       "Woah. Why are you wearing a weird brown hat, Ryan?" "It's my hair. And I'm not Ryan, I'm Adam." "What?" "Have you been eating that weird stuff in the garden again Mickey?" "Ehhh?" "Weirdo. How did i make a band with these people?" "Remember what i said," says Jesse quietly into Adam's ear, as if he is a spy, as he walks past.  Adam turns around, and finds that Jesse has disappeared.  I go on one date and whole house goes weird. Is this even about the date?  "Hey man." "Eh." "I'm really glad you got a girl and everything, but you know, we're thinking... you can't get too serious. I mean, a date? You should be out there pulling 13 girls a night in a club with us!" advises Ryan. "You're only 18 for God's sake!!" "Yuh... I know man. But she's special. And i've known her since I was like, 3." "Loosen up and forget about her." "Dude, why are you trying to ruin this?" Adam wonders desperately. "Do you think this is all about you?" "What?" "Everybody else is being affected! We only just get a record deal and you go all silent after one beer?? This isn't the old you, Adam, and you know it. She's changed you. It's only been a few days but you've changed so much. You weren't even excited when Mickey bought a pornographic dot-to-dot book yesterday. What's up, man?" "There's nothing wrong. Why have you all got against this?" "Do you realise that we have to record our songs soon, Adam? The last thing we need is you with Janice on your mind and everybody else worried about your awkwardness!" "The name is Jane." "Whatever. I'm sorry about yelling at you, man. Anyway, there's a party tonight. It'll help you loosen up. And she won't be there, don't worry. Just get off with a few girls and you'll remember what it's like to be single and in a band again." Silence. "Fine," says Adam. "Fine."

       "Dude. Dude! Wake up, dude." "Ehn? Wha.." "Dude, I gotta tell you.." "What? What the hell are you doing here?" Adam says sleepily, not actually sure who is breathing in his face so violently. He tries to shut out the constant mumbling someone seems to be doing.  "..but I don't think you should.." "Who are you? What are you doing in here?" "..so i think... what? It's Jesse, man." "What are you doing here? What time is it?" "Erm.. I think it's four or five or something..." "Why are you here?" "Well I never got a chance to say this, but hey, congratulations on the date." Adam rubs his eyes and looks at Jesse suspiciously. "Is that all?" "Well..." "What do you want?" "Well I wanted to say.. keep away from her. You don't wanna sound too keen. I mean, you gotta..." "Are you giving me dating tips?" "Ermm... well... you could put it that way... But I think you'll find it more agreeable if we don't give it a name, really." Adam stares at him. "Look man, you've gone all weird since that date thing." "What?" "Dude, listen to me; dates are bad for you. They make you go all weird up here," says Jesse, pointing at his ear. "What? And don't you mean here?" Adam says, whacking Jesse's head. "OW!" "Now go back to sleep. Go." "I ain't finished with you though dude." "JUST GET OUT! I NEED TO SLEEP."

       "We need beer. Harry Potter and Pringles are just not enough." "I agree with Mickey." "Well I'm not getting the beer, I've only got 10p left on my credit card and I always buy everything." "Fine I'll get it." Ryan ends up spending £12-99 on a crate of beer. On his return he is horrified to find Jesse drooling over Hermione. "So, are we just gonna lounge around all night watching the Chamber of Secrets? Hardly a worthy celebration of getting a record deal," decides Adam. "You're right," says Jesse, "We should go rent out Spy Kids as well." "What the hell are you on Jesse?" mumbles Ryan, wondering how he got talked into watching Harry Potter in the first place. "Actually, I recently tried eating the plastic cover thing on new tapes.." "That was a rhetorical question." "Oh, sorry..." "Hey, this is the bit where the big spiders come.. wait for it.." says Mickey excitedly. "Will somebody switch Harry bloody Potter off???" yells Ryan. "NO!" Jesse emits a quiet yelp.  Nobody notices Adam is being unusally quiet.  "...I think she should straighten the hair.." "...I've heard that ceramic ones are good.." "...Dude, why are we, sorry, YOU, talking about hair straightening???" "Er, guys? I'm gonna take off now. To my room, i mean. I'm a bit erm.. tired." "What? But Adam, you haven't finished watching Harry Potter! I mean, the party's not over," says Jesse.  "I'm just.. yeh." "We're going to the studio tomorrow, by the way. Start recording." "Oh. OK." And he goes upstairs, and falls asleep immediately, even with the racket of "Nooo, it's a trap Harry!" from downstairs.

       Adam returns home from school. (That sounds so wrong.) The last night, after he got back, he had walked in with a stupid smile and went straight to his room.  "Hey look who it is!" Adam drags himself through the front door. "You haven't spoken to us all day!" "So how was it?" "How was what?" Adam says, hanging up his jacket. "If you're referring to work, some kid managed to break the new drum kit the school bought." "No, you moron, the date!" says Mickey. "Oh, that." "Trying to sound casual now, are we?" "What?" "Did you pull?" wonders Jesse. "On a first date? Adam? No way..." "Yes actually, I did." "Seriously?" exclaims Ryan. Adam is rather offended. "Good thing you wore a shirt, man," decides Jesse. "That was the key. Touche," he adds, kissing his fingers like a french guy. "Err.. OK." "What was it like? What's her name? Who is this new and mysterious woman who has entered thine life?" says Mickey. Everybody turns around and stares at Mickey. "I've erm, been reading .. stuff." Everybody turns back around to Adam and STARES. "What?" "Well answer the man's question then!" says Jesse. "What? Why?" "Come on man! We gotta know!" "No! That is between me and Jane." "OOooOOhhHH, so her name's Jane now, is it?" "Oh God." "What have you got to hide, eh?" "Yeh dude. We're friends - we're a  band . We have this infinite web of ever-bonding erm, bondness. Does that mean nothing to you?" Everyone stares at Mickey again. "Sorry." "No, it's not that.. it's just that I like to keep things private." "Look man, there are some things we just ain't meant to know. But this ain't one of them." "Will you just let me through so I can get a beer?" "Only if you tell us." "I'll get the beer for you," suggests Mickey. "No, we don't have any left," reminds Ryan. "What? But I bought like a whole crate on Saturday!" exclaims Adam. "I know, but we had this party this.." "You had a party?" "Well... it was more of a..." "..Of a gathering.. kinda thing." Jesse scratches his neck. "You had a party and you didn't even tell me?"  That is bloody out of order. I'm the only one who works, making me the sole provider of this damn "family" and all they do is partay? and without ME?  "Well.. we didn't know we were having a party. It was kinda.. what's that word?" "Spontaneous?" suggets Ryan. "Yeh, that's the one." "What?" "Wait a minute, haven't we told him yet?" "Told me what?" "Oh my god. You are going to fry in happiness when you hear this!" Everyone turns around to stare at Mickey again. "Burst, i meant burst, not fry." "Shut up Mickey," says Ryan. "Adam," he says, looking him in the eye, seriously, "We got a record deal." Silence. "You could have made up something more believeable, you know," says Adam. "What? You don't believe us?!" exclaims Jesse. "Look! Here's the papers!!" says Mickey, shoving it into Adam's face. "Dude, that's a porn magazine." "Oh, sorry. here they are, look!!" Mickey tucks the mag into his pocket and resumes shoving papers into Adam's face. Silence. "Seriously? We got a record deal?" "Yeh dude!! WE GOT A RECORD DEAL!!" "OH MY F*CKING GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!!!" "I knew he would fry with happiness. Burst, burst, not fry."

       Jane wakes up at 10-30. The good thing about being the manager of such a big company is that nobody even notices or cares if you don't show up.    Woah, 10-30 already! Better get up.   The phone rings.  "Hello?" "Hi! It's Nazrene." "Oh hi," says Jane sleepily. "You know, I had the most.." "..wonderful dream last night. I know I know." "WILL YOU STOP WITH THE PSYCHICNESS??" "Sorry." "Anyway, I was going on this date with.." "Janey, that wasn't a dream, that HAPPENED." Pause. "Seriously?" wonders Janey, intrigued. "Yuh! There was a dodgy waiter and at the end when you were about to leave you sprang out and kissed him." "Naz, the psy.." "Sorry." "Anyway." Long pause. "Anyway what?" "I dunno. Why did you phone me again?" "Oh yeh. Are you gonna come to Mike's partay or what?" "Oh that. I dunno." "You can come with Adam." "I guess." Pause. "I'd have to ask him first though." "Yeh." "But I don't have his number. He rang me." "Oh you silly moo." "Damn." "Well ring me when you find out, OK? I'm only supposed to invite like one friend and I don't wanna waste that invite." "You invited Phil, Shivani and everyone else as well didn't y.." "Yup." Jane laughs. "All right, I'll call you soon."   This should be easy,  she thinks to herself.  I'll just wait for him to call me. Or bump into him on the road or something.

       "That was a very enjoyable meal," says Jane. "Yeh. yeh, me too," Adam says, trying to nod, although secretly thinking about how gross it was. "Dessert?" "Oh gosh, I really am full. I don't think i could eat much more." "OK," says Adam, glad that she declined the offer, because he felt that the £37 left on his credit card wouldn't really benefit from buying another bit of fancy cake. "Yeh, me niether." "This is a nice restaurant," says Jane.  "Yeh. Yup. Yah. Yes. Yupity -" "Adam." "Sorry." Silence. "Erm.. check!" Adam yells, waving his hand around. Jane closes her eyes.  Just concentrate on the hair and don't think about his weird arm waving movements , she instructs herself. The annoyed waiter comes with his nose in the air. He places the bill smugly in front of Adam, with the hope that Adam won't be able to afford it.  £36.90  Oh good,  thinks Adam,  Not only have i got enough, but I can even buy myself a packet of those funny alien crisps as well!  He pulls out his Tesco's credit card and places it on the little plate with the mints holding the curled bill down.  "Thank you, sir," the waiter says, taking the card and walking off. He comes back with the card and a small packet of mints wrapped in green tissue paper each for the two. Jane notices that hers has some kind of serial code. Something like 02089493556 but she doesn't take any notice of it and pops a mint into her mouth.  "Erm, are you cold?" wonders Adam aloud, as they walk to their cars. "Um, not really." "Well i am," he says, and hugs her close.  He smells of.. well,  man . Hmm,  she decides.  But man's good.   She smells of.. summer. Wow. This is amazing because I've never actually known what summer smells like before.  Adam decides to pretend that his car is round the corner so he won't ahve to go through the embarrassment of introducing his tatty old thing to her.  "Yeh, just around the corner, uh huh." "OK." Jane turns around to face him. "You know, tonight was nice. Really nice." Adam blinks.  What am i supposed to say? Without her thinking i'm all weird and wimpy? I gotta retain the machoism.  "Erm, yuh, it was good." He closes his mouth, not daring to say more.  is he gonna kiss me at all? Am i gonna have to kiss her? What if she doesn't want me to? I hope that evil waiter doesn't come poking around again... I wish he would get on with it. Oh crap, what if he does? Aaah! What am I meant to do? What would Ryan do? Hold her hand? OK, I'll hold her hand.  Adam takes both Jane's hands.  Ok.. so he took my hands. Woah, he's hot. I mean, his hands are hot. OK, so what do I do now? Smile. I gotta smile. Come on man, smile!  Adam forcibly smiles at Jane, bearing nearly all his teeth.  Oh my god. He's smiling at me now. This should be a good thing. Why am I so freaked out then? Must be because he's showing me all his teeth. Why is he doing this?? Oh crap. I said smile, not grin like a madman! Great, you've blown it now. Close your mouth, Adam. JUST CLOSE YOUR MOUTH.  Adam's mouth comes abruptly to a close.  Woah. He can get serious pretty quick. Was it because of me? Do i repulse him? Oh god! Oh God, she looks scared now. Quick, do something. Anything.  Adam closes his eyes.  Why is he closing his eyes? Is he going to kiss me? I'm not ready. You could have done ANYTHING but close your damn eyes! What, did you think the whole problem would just disappear if you couldn't see it??? God, Adam, you are useless... Maybe I should just go now. Say good bye or something. There is something up with this guy.   "Um Adam, it was really great seeing you again, and dinner was really nice. But I have to go now. I'm getting a bit cold and I really should be getting back." "Um. Ok." Jane looks at Adam.  What the hell am I supposed to say to her??  "Well, it was.. erm, nice. And it would be, um, nice, to see you again. Have a, err, nice, um, journey home. You - um, you're, you're really, erm, nice." "Err.. yeh? Well you're nice too." "Well.. um.. see you some time then!" "Yeh. Bye." And Jane gets into her car. Adam starts to walk to the end of the street to wait until she is gone.  Jane sits still in her Lexus. Walking, walking, walking away. She decides to start the car. As Adam hears the revving of the engine, he looks back at her and sees her car, but she cannot see him. He carries on walking. Jane is about the step on the pedal. She stops. Gets out. Runs to Adam. Kisses him. Gets kissed back.  Goes home.  I know that goodbye means nothing at all

       "Are you ready to order?" says the waiter, who has again just sprung out of nowhere and is again trying to look down Jane's top. "Erm, yes. I'll have this um, steak-y thing, this one here," Adam says, pointing at the picture on his menu.  So bloody expensive here , he thinks.  "And you madame?" "I'll just have the  salmon ," Jane says, glancing childishly at Adam and his shirt, "With the lemon dressing."  wow, it's so cheap here!  she thinks. "A very good choice," says the waiter, also glancing at Adam's shirt.  Aaaahaha,  he thinks, smirking,  That guy will never pull her with that shirt! Mwahaha.   And off the waiter went, grinning once again.   And so they sat waiting for their food. "So... what have you been up to in the last few days?" "Well.. I gave some Yao and Tom and some other people a promotion.. you know, they really have been working very hard hese days." "Oh," was all Adam managed to say.  Yao, Tom, does the list never stop? So much competition...   "And you?"  "I've, yeh, I-I've been good." "Yeh? You know, you never told me what you do. Where do you work?" "Oh.. well.. I um, well, I work at this school." "You're a teacher?" "No.. I'm just a kinda music helper kinda sorta.. um.. thing." "Hahaha."  "So, explain what this google thing is again?"

        Damn, is she buying this stuff about the mouth thing?    Did he really think I was gonna buy the stuff about the mouth thing? Stupid male, probably spotted some hot chick with a hot car and couldn't help himself.   "So, um, you look great," says Adam, brushing away the spot of saliva on his shirt. "Heh, thank you. Um, you don't clean up bad yourself." The two simultaneously give out a nervous laugh.  Oh god.  they think simultaneously.  "Some wine?" says the waiter, popping up from nowhere, and trying to look down Jane's top.  "Erm, ok. What you got?" says Adam, not very knowledgeably.  "Would you like to try the new import we have just received from Southern France this evening?" "Why not? Jane?" "Yes, that would be nice," she says, smiling at the waiter.  Oh ho, she's smiling at me!  thinks the waiter.  I think i'll slip just my number under her napkin...   And so the waiter walks away with a grin on his face and comes back with the wine.  "This is nice," says Jane, nodding. "Yeh," agrees Adam, although he doesnt really agree; he decides he'd rather have a bottle of budweiser.  "Hmm."

        Crap , thinks janey as she races her Lexus down the streets of Kinkayston.    Crap , thinks Adam as he races his tattered old Ford down the streets of Kinkayston.   Why he didn't just pick Janey up, seeing as they live on the same street, beats me.   Woah, whose Lexuz is that? What a stunner..  thinks Adam as he pulls up near the restaurant.  Damn, who is it? Woah. Some hot chick with a hot car. Whew.    Oh god. This is it, I guess  Thinks Jane.  Adam pulls himself out of his car, rather ashamed of his car, parked next to the Lexus. He strides into the restaurant.  "Erm, reservation for two?" "Your name, sir?" "Levine." "This way, sir." "Err, thank you."   We're walking towards the table with the hot chick. Uh oh, he got me confused. Why does this always happen to me? It always ends up in some embarrassing scene as well. stupid restaurant.  Adam worries.  Jane looks up.  Is that Adam? Why is he wearing pink?    Oh my god, that's Jane. Oh my god, Jane was the hot chick. Oh my god. And she has a Lexus! Oh my god. Wait. Oh man she's hot.  Adam's jaw literally falls open.  "Here, sir." "Uuuh? Uh. Thunker," Adam says, meaning to say "Oh, Thank you," but not quite managing, what with the open mouth and all.  Silence. Adam's mouth is still open.  "Hi." Jane says awkwardly. "Uh." Adam grunts (hi) "Um, why is your mouth open? What is it? Have I got lipstick on my teeth?" "Uoh, uoh, uoh," says Adam quickly, shaking his head (No, no, no) "Err... ok then." janey blinks. "Ih huh hah..." (It's just that) Adam closes his mouth with his hand, realising he has dribbled a bit and there is now a conspicuous dot somewhere down Ryan's shirt.  Ohhh shit.  he thinks  just grrreat.  "I'm so sorry... I um, have a um, medical, er, thingy, with my mouth, and the thingy with the erm... yuh." Janey laughs.

       "Hey, Adam, ain't you supposed to be on a date?"  yells Ryan, not moving his eyes from the TV. "OOoooOOOhhhHH!" mock the other guys. "A date?" "Shut up." "It's 7-30 already," says Ryan. "WHAT?! You were supposed to remind me when it was 7!!" "Really? Sorry man." "What am i supposed to do now?! It takes like half an hour to get there!!" "Not if you drive fast," suggests Mickey. "Err.. ok. Well I gotta go shower now. Shall I wear green t-shirt or black?" "Green." "Black. "Man, you can't wear a t-shirt!" Ryan exclaimed frantically. "Why?" "Cos you're going on a  date ! Nobody wears t-shirts on a date. You'll never pull." "The man is right," says Jesse. "You gotta wear a  shirt !" says Mickey, laughing, and then realising he didnt even make a joke. "Oh man.. I don't have a shirt!" "What do you wear to work then?" "Erm, t-shirts." "God." "Well i'm gonna go shower now. Can somebody lend me a shirt?" "Yeh, sure." Adam runs off to the shower. About 30 seconds later, he reemerges with a towel around him.  "So where's the shirt?" "Sorry man, the only one I got left is this one," Ryan says, holding up a salmon coloured shirt. "Dude! It's PINK!" "Yeh, I know man, but it's the only clean one i got left." Adam lets out a rather disappointed burp. (hehe) "Fine." He puts on the shirt and retreats to his room to put on his trousers (which was a sensible idea.. you know.. not changing in the living room...)  Oh crap. Only 5 minutes left to do my hair? How am i gonna manage that??  He thinks frustratedly. So he pours a handful of gel and manages to get his hair semi-done. And out he rushes.  Every bus, every train, Ever cab, every lane is JAMMED

        omg omg omg what am i gonna do???  Janey paces up and down the room in her new dress.  Damn, why is it so awkward?? Maybe I should eat something, keep my mind off the whole thing. But what if i throw up? And I'll probably forget the whole thing.  She checks her clock. 5-30.  Arrrgh!! Still another 2 hours before I have to leave! What am i supposed to do?!  she thinks. While she argues with herself, Harold, the old weirdo (rather pervy too) is watching her rather amusing facial expressions through his telescope.  Only eighteen,  he thinks,  and so beautiful.  Anyway, Janey was getting bored, sweaty and frustrated.  What am i doing here?! Why did I get ready so early?!

       (author's note: This is not my interpretation of Nazrene, and please do not get offended.. I just wrote the words to fit... but you're very spontaneous and fun in this!)   omg omg omg what am i supposed to wear? Which perfume? Will I have to wear foundation? But I don't even like foundation! It dries my skin out.  Janey thinks... although she knows that worrying is completely futile. She calls up Nazrene in search of advice. "Hello?" "Hi Naz, it's Janey!" "Oh cool! So you coming to the partay then? We're gonna be having a ROCKING KINKAY TIME!!!" "Err.. maybe. It depends." Pause. "Depends on what?" Pause. "Err.. well actually, that's why I'm ringing you. I need some advice." "Really? I'm good with advice, me." "OK. Well, you remember Adam? Wait, you weren't there..." "Who, Adam Levine?" "Wha..? How do you -? Wha-? Where did you..." "Oh Janey Janey Janey... have you not taken any of our undeniable psychicness into account? Sure I haven't met the guy.. but badaboom I know him!" "Err... OK. Anyway -" "Omg, are you going out with  Adam ?" "Well.. I guess." "Then you can come to the partay!! Perfect!" "Yuh. But I need your advice on what to wear. he is so funny and amazing.. and he has his own band!! But I don't want to seem too... desperate.. and I dunno. He's so... random. In a wonderful way. And I've never met anyone quite like him. What am I supposed to wear? Do? Say? He's so.. different. I dunno what to do." "Hmm." Janey can hear Naz's brain tick. "How about that pretty little purple dress?" "The one I got from Prada?" "yuhuh." "You mean the one with the silk straps and the white.." "..embroidery with the little holey things at the bottom. Yes, that one." "How do you know about that dress?? I only just bought it yesterday!" Janey says, confused and scared. "Janey Janey Janey." Nazrene taps her nose, unaware that Janey cannot see her, "The psychicness!" "Oh, that. You know, you must stop doing that. it's scary."  "Ok." Nazrene shrugs, still unaware that she is on the phone. "Right.. so the purple dress. Isn't that a bit low?" "Don't worry darling.. It'll be fine." "Er.. ok." "And don't worry about the rest. It'll just come. Because he should be deeper than that.. and anyway.. it's a first date. You've already made a good impression. What else?" Nazrene says knowledgeably. "Ok. well, thanks for your help." "Byee!!" Jane puts down the phone, worrying about Nazrene's freaky psychicness and her "date".

       Jane waits by the phone while watching the OC.  Damn Seth and Ryan are fit  she thinks.  When is Adam gonna phone me?!?!  *Ring ring* jane immediately grabs the phone. "Hello?" "Hello Miss Cai, this is Tom Baker from British Gas and we are conducting a survey on - " "No sorry I have no time please don't ring back later I'm sorry good bye." She cuts in hastily. Five minutes later. *Ring ring* "Hello?" "Jane!! It's me, Naz Baz.. Do you wanna go to Mike's party on Saturday? Remember to bring a partner! Oh my god and I'm finally going out with james!! And - " "Erm maybe sorry I can't talk now somebobdy important might be trying to get through you know what i'll call you later ok bye."  Ten minutes later.  *Ring ring* "Hello?"

Damnit,  she thinks,  why are so many people calling me today?!  Half an hour later. *Ring ring* "Hello?" she says, frustrated and hoping it isn't her brother's best friend's cousin (the one that fancies her) or somebody stupid like that. "Hi." Pause. Jane is getting annoyed and hoping it isn't another one of those pyscho stalker callers. "Look, I have some important - " "It's me, Adam." "Oh." Pause. "Oh hi. I didn't know it was you." "Uh huh. Do you have something you're busy with? you sounded kinda urgent.." "Er.. oh, n-no, no.. It's all fine now. Tom's fixed it," she stammers. "Oh. Ok," Adam says, wondering about Tom and whether he too was competition. "So.. erm.. you wanna go out for dinner some time?" "Erm.." "I mean.. y-you don;t have to.. I'm not.." "No, sure, that would be great." "Oh. ok," he says with a grin that shows through his voice.  Ohmygodhejustaskedmeouttodinner ohmygodohmygodohmygod OHMYGODADAMLEVINEJUSTASKEDMEOUTTODINNER  she thinks as she struggles to breath..  it's getting harder and harder to breathe...  "Thursday.. 8? At erm.. Luigi's?" "Yeh. Sure." "And I'll make sure i bring enough money!" jane laughs.

       "So.. how have you been all these years?" "Well, after I moved away, I moved away again.. to here. And what brings  you  to Kinkayston then?" "Well... I'm hoping for a record deal. I've found me a band.. Well nearly. We've got 4 members so far." "What are you called?" "Kara's Flowers." Janey gives Adam an amused look. "What? It's cos of a girl called Kara." Janey emits a small laugh. Silence as Adam sits there nodding to himself while sipping his latte for some reason. "What have you been up to?" "Me? Not much really. Well.. I'm alright. Yeh." Nods. "I set up my own company... I have Yao and Ben working for me now. Hahaha.. Well Yao is my deputy and Ben.. You know, I don't actually know what Ben does. I think he's a toilet cleaner or something. Hmm.." "Oh. There's a Yao now, is there?" Adam says, clearly jealous and curious and annoyed. "He's just a deputy. It's a growing company. Yeh. It's called Google." she says proudly. "What's that?" "Do you have the internet?" "No." "OK then. Don't worry about it." Long awkward silence while Adam wonders what the hell Google is and whether Yao will be a threat. Jane thinks about Adam's hair. "You know.. I have to go now Adam. It was nice meeting you again." Jane starts getting up. "Um, can I have your number? Maybe I'll call you some time." Pause. "Er, sure." Jane scribbles her number down, secretly thinking abuot how she must NOT wait beside the phone as soon as she got back from her meeting. "Ok, bye then." "Bye."

       At starbucks  "What do you want?" "Erm.. I'll have a latte." "Ok, two lattes please." "No, I'll pay for mine - " "Don't worry... I know I don't even have enough money to pay the rent but small things like this don't matter." "No, really." "No no no, I gotta pay you back for that ripped dress, right?" "Haha.. Ok then, just this time." "You mean there'll be another time?" Janey laughs.. rather embarrassedly, actually.  Adam scrounges around in his pockets. *Jingle jingle* "Oh crap. I've only got enough for one," he says rather sheepishly. Janey bursts out in laughter, like so: "AHAHAHAHAHA.. ahem. Don't worry, I'll pay for me. In fact I'll pay for both of us." Adam looks sheepish for the rest of the morning.

       And then what happened? Well i'll tell you what happened. And i will try to make this as long as possible.  "You wanna grab a coffee some time?" "Err, sure!" "You know, I never quite got over when you stole my guitar. It kinda made me appreciate when i did have it. I almost died, you know." "Really? Well that was my favourite dress you know, it was Barbie." Adam laughs. --awkward silence--

       Janey's pager rings. "Oh. I'm needed in the office." Ryan looks disappointed. "Maybe I'll catch you later then?" "Yeah, that would be best." "Dinner some time maybe?" "I guess," says Janey with a smug feeling inside. "I'll pick you up at 7-30 tonight then?" "Tonight?" "Are you busy?" "Well, no, but.." "Me neither," says Ryan. Janey laughs. "Alright then, tonight it is. Do you even know where I live?" "No. Are you gonna tell me?" Janey laughs again and tells him her address. "Really? I just live down the road!" "Seriously?" "Yeah! This is amazing! Wow!" "What number do you live at then?" "46." "Weird.." "I know! And you live at number 25!" "Hehe, listen, I've got to go now." "Alright, remember, 7-30!" Janey departs from Starbucks feeling happy.
