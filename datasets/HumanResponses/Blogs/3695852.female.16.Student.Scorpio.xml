      this morning was horrible... i wanted to go to the damn flea market but my lazy ass uncle won't give us a fuckin' ride!!!  I mean that's why he's living with us so he can provide us some sort of transportation since my mom doesn't know how to freakin' drive.  I mean i know ain't wiser than she is...  but come on now my dad has been teachin' her for like 3 or more months now... and then she blames my dad for not being able to teach her better??? she's the one who don't wanna listen to my dad.  she doesn't like being told what to do.  I mean this shit is all her fault.  She's the one who wanted us to move... she spent a bunch of money just movin' to this trashy trailer.
