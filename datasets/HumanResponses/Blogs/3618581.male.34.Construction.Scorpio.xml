      In a few more days we have to go to the doctors to get a sonogram done. Tonyas hoping it's a girl, I'm hoping it's healthy. I didn't tell her but I'm hoping its a girl also. And if it's not then we'll try again. I went looking for another job today. I'm looking for another full-time job or even a part-time one. So far no luck but it's only the first day. Had a rough day at work and I'm really tired so I'll write more later or tomorrow.

      It's been a few days now and I haven't had anything to report. Tonya has been feeling pretty sick lately. I'm wondering if her doctor is going to take her off work. I told her don't worry if he does. I'll just look for another job while she stays home. I think struggling will be a good thing for me. I've never had to struggle before, mom was always there. I feel I'm ready for a good struggle. Oh yeah, we've changed our minds about a name if it's a boy. The name if it's a boy will be Tristan Michael. I really didn't care for the other name and I won the arguement. Oh yeah, no more kidney stones. WOOHOOOO. Passed them the other night.

      My mood is:    Last night I had to go to the hospital this time. At 8pm I had a real bad pain on the right side of my stomach. As I was driving to the hospital I had to keep pulling over so I could vomit. The pain was really bad. I get there and the take me in and hook me up. They finally come back at 1:30am and tell me it looks like a kidney stone. I'm thinking "Great, just what I needed". Then the nurse tell me that since I drove myself to the hospital that she couldn't let me leave till the pain-killers wear off. By the time I got out of there it was 3am. I wasn't in a very good mood. It feels a little better today. I've been taking vicodin for the pain. I hope I feel better tomorrow.

      My mood is:    Well, we had to go to the hospital for her pains again. They are worried that it might be a tubal birth. They are thinking that her egg got stuck in her tubes. I really hope it's not that and that her pains are from something else. I've waited to damn long for this for something to happen. I'd really hate to lose this baby but the doctor said if thats whats causing her pain and she goes through with this pregnancy then she could die. Just my luck, huh. We'll see what happens when she goes to her doctor later today.

      My mood is:   Well, it's 4am and we just got back from the hospital an hour ago. She was complaining that she had a pain in her stomach. It seems that the pains were from dehydration and stress. Her immature sister doesnt seem to think that I deserve a child. But what she thinks doesn't matter anyway. She also thinks that I abuse Austin. I spank him (not often) and only once. I never spank him more than one time. But it's ok for her to choke him, slap him, and tease him. What I find funny is that if you ask him whose meaner me of her he'll say she is. She said she wants nothing to do with this baby or us, which is fine by me. I like it better that way. Alot less stress. If somebody isn't going to treat my child good than I don't want them in their life. It's funny how you think certain people are cool with you but then when something happens you find out what they really think of you. Tonya can choose to talk to people like that but I refuse to. I don't need stupid little kid drama in my life. I have more important things and people to worry bout.

      My mood is:    Well, the test has confirmed it!! We are going to have a baby. This is the best news I've gotten in a long time. Man I am so HAPPY. We already have the names picked out. For a girl it'll be Selena Sheila and a boy it'll be Jaheim Mikel. The baby will be here in Febuary. I hope it's born on my moms birthday, that'll be cool. Well let me get going for now. I have some calls to make. Peace-out.

      My mood is:    I'm very moody and agitated today and I'm not sure why. I think the heat might have something to do with it. I'm sure the stress has ALOT to do with it also. It's amazing how much money can stress a person out. Theres nothing I can about the heat so I guess I'll just have to get over it.

      You know what I don't like? Shady people. I hate people that are nice to your face and as soon as you turn are around they talk crap about you. I live in a small town upstate now and it seems like everybody backstabs up here. Then my girlfriend wonders why I dont wanna make any friends up here. I hate this town and most of the people up here. We're planning on moving but we're not sure if we're gonna move back to The Bronx or Virginia Beach. We have to wait till next week to find out if she's pregnant, that would be the deciding factor of where we move. I loved growing up in The Bronx, but it has changed so much and I'm not sure if I want to raise a child there now. Besides the fact that it has gotten way to expensive down there. So far we're leaning more towards Va Bch. I'd rather my kid play in a yard than on concrete. I had a good childhood but I wanna give my kid more than what I had. Below is a recent pic of where I grew up.

      Lately I've been feeling kinda down. I've been thinking of the "old" days alot. Kinda makes me feel old. I miss those days alot. Not sure if I miss them because I had fun or because my mom was around then and I was happy. It's been 18 months since my mom passed and I still miss her bad. I miss hearing her say my name. I miss her smiling face and her laugh. I still don't feel complete without my bestfriend but I have realized that I can live without her. My life has to and will go on without her. I never thought I would be alright without her but life has shown me different. It's gotten a little easier lately but I still have my bad days, just not as many. Well let me leave it at that for now. I'm going to try to come here and post as much as I can.

      I wanted to just give a little remembrance to all my friends I've lost through the years.  Georgie, Sekret, Peter, Paulie, Mike, Joyce, Joy, Liz, Anton, Lil Joey, Nicky Donuts, Crazy Sal.  And to those that I've forgotten over the years.&nbsp; I can't wait till we see eachother again. The streets of The Bronx may have gotten you but God has you now. Rest In Peace my friends.

      It's almost 3am and I have to be up in a few hours to go to the doctors for the sonogram. Me and a few other people have been wondering if we might be having twins. Tonya has gotten so big so quick. Twins would be a handful but I'm ready to take what God gives me. I really feel I'm ready for this but another side of me hopes I'm ready for this responsibility. When we come back from the doctors I'll post the sonogram on here.
