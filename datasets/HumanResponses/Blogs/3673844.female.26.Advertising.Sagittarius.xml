      I manage to keep up my active lifestyle today...ie: waking up as early as 6am for a morning walk with my parents and take a bloody early shower. Been quiet energetic since Fri and hope to keep this up.  Started swimming again...drove all the way up towards Sg Buloh to swim at this very nice countryhomes residence. Dun ask me how I got in... :)  I plan to get a self-tan lotion by this Fri just so I could apply it on while i swim on Sat this week...mid morning. With that, hopefully I gain healthy tan and perhaps look slightly slimer. hehe  As for the title...Shieko has been playing these 2 tracks for the whole day...and I have for the 3000 times ask her the title and band. M at this sorry state of not remembering names, and people. Imagine...I have met my boss wifey for sometime now in the gym...and frankly I can't still recognise her if I see her on the st. but I m very sure I recognise her shape...trim and lean.  Next task...spend some good time downloading songs...and buying CDs again.   My next next hobbies is to try out gardening. I might just do up a small garden up in the balcony. When I share this with mom...she says nobody is gonna see it. But deep down I knew she's gonna forbid me to do the gardening outside as she is quiet paranoid about the crime that is happening all the time in our life. More so with the snatch thief hoo-la-boo now.  So, yeah...something to keep me going. Hopefully, by the time they move to their new home next year I could transport all the lovely plants in pots there. Maybe I will stay with them for couple of years before I leave the nest and build my own...

      I woke up someday ago thinking it has been long that I have not really wake up fresh in the morning. It has been like waking up to a dull day, stale air and un-energized at all.  However something happened this morning. I woke up at 6 am and took a shower....something which I have not been doing hours this early since my high school day. Plan to reschedule my life again...must wake up early to welcome the rising sun and morning dew.  That's it for the day. Not more blogging my own site. Till I have something more interesting to fork out. Maybe some heart thumping news at work someday later. Hehe.

      Hiya all...  Life have been so busy and sometime meaningless having stuck here in a matchbox day and nite, hence I decide to set up my own blog to have bit of fun and amuse myself. Let's tiong came upon the idea of having a blog to vent out frustration, to becok becok a bit and share something about life, politic, friendship and travelling . Thanks to the Malay writer, Uncle Dal having given the idea of this "tiong" when I asked him what's other term for being kaypoh. I never have much hobbies in my whole life...and I guess it was lost in translation ever since I enter adulthood. For a start, after many many years...here's a brand new beginning to a new hobby. Hehe...hope I will be able to keep this spirit alive and blog with interesting thoughts to share. Let's blog, people and have fun!

      I know I have not been bother to blog for sometime now.... but its all for the "breath more fresh air and wake up early" routine I intend to keep up now.  Just as I m enjoying my new routine...I get on to tidying up the table next to my bedside and hope to reaarange the mess create by the part-time house keeper. Yeah...u hear it right....the somebody who's suppose to tidy and clean the house twice a week is ironically someone who mess up my room every tues and fri.  Nevermind if the bags and magazine she dumped on my bed when it should have been on the table...nevermind if the shoes underneath my bed is outside the room in some dark corner....nevermind if she for some reason want to put the small dumpbin on my bed when she mop the floor(thankfully clean as it is just used as a tissue and face cotton dump)...but to discover the 2 figurine loses an arm and a couple of fingers is very disturbing for a slow saturday.  My heart is aching as to why she tend to break stuff and not even alerting any of us even after 20 years of working in this household. Why all the mess and object not in place? Our theory for years is that she wants to prove that she did touch and clean those spots. But hey...nobody is complaining...nobody....as we were never home when she is here...  Those fingers....delicate and soft...are some of my precious possesion...not becoz it is expensive...but its something I pick personally and spend on to keep as a collection from my travelling. A possesion that I have lotsa trouble hand-carry it home. I did feel heart broken when one of this figurine broke her finger the first day I arrived home from Shanghai...but I manage to stick it back with a super-glue then...and it manage to deceive the eyes of many.  So where is the arm and the few fingers she broke? Did she just dump it hoping I wont realise becoz she thinks I dun care how my room is being manage?  If I could I will want to catch her before leaving to work next tues. Mom is right when she said this woman has a very bad heart, she is a rot....though when I was younger I thought it is a common behaviour of a maid. And of all....she is someone my mum is willing to put up with for the reason the whole family is just to busy.  SO there u have it...a woman...who have the house to herself twice a week and nobody knows what she is up to apart from the dumpbin...the bags...those precious books...the wrapping up of any object she thinks worth keeping in a bag and everybody thought their stuff gone missing till they discovered it hidden in a bag...the old nespaper place underneath every rack of the shoesrack for whatever decor sense she have and now the figurine.  What bout the rest....we really have no idea. I hope when we finally move to the new place next year...she wont be working for us...as by then...most of us isnt gonna be around...so there's less tidying up to do...as if there's lesser tidying now every tues and fri.   @#$*%^!??
