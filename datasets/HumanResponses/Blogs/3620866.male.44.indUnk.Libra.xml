      My poor, neglected bike has had it's revenge!  I have a lovely red 1996 Honda VFR750 which has pretty much not skipped a beat in 72000km.  I bought it at about 18000km and it has only used a few headlight bulbs, very few tyres and a chain and sprockets to speak of.  I was reading just this week about how wonderful the VFR is as a used bike, but watch out for the regulator/rectifier because they are notorious for failing.  They actually listed a website with some good ideas to prevent it happening which I was going to look at one day soon. See  urlLink http://www.one-ring.net/vfrfaq/reg-rect.html  Not soon enough apparently!  After coasting to a stop with everything dead I immediately suspected a fuse.  Years ago I called my mechanic out to a roadside breakdown on my BMW K100RS only to discover it was just a fuse.  Once I found the fuse it was in fact blown.  Honda has wisely installed spare fuses so I put the spare in (It's hard to get at) and it blew immediately, without even switching on.  Well, that was the last 30amp fuse so I used the last bar of battery on my mobile to phone my mechanic (the same one as before) who told me it was the regulator/rectifier.  I just had to unplug it and drive on - but not too far because the battery would not be charging.  All sweet until I get the bill for the new bit!  I might try to use the fixes on that website too.  I wonder if the bike was a bit fickle because I have not been riding it much lately on account of I am teaching my boy to drive.  I hadn't ridden it for about 2 weeks so that might have something to do with it.  Only a couple of months and he should be able to get his license so back to the bike as much as possible!  Teaching someone to drive is a subject in itself and maybe source for another post soon!

      I heard today of some of the details of the proposed developments in Ralphs Bay, Lauderdale. It is unbelievable that the government could even consider allowing this development which will have such a drastic impact on a beautiful area. It's not just the building area but the infrastructure which will destroy the total feel of the area. I'm told there will be huge walls built in the bay and on the Foreshore and in Frederick Henry Bay to allow the development to proceed. The only people to benefit are the already mega-rich developer and the rich people who would populate the new area. Everyone else, including local businesses will suffer the decline in the attraction ofthe area.  I must admit I was softly against the proposal but now am firmly opposed to it.
