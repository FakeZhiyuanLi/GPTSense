       I'm calling this blog "Why I Wish My Car Was More Like a Mac Than a PC"   Have you noticed the amazing number of computer magazines that exist?  Well, I spend my time stripping covers off of old magazines at work, so I always take the time to peruse them.  Without fail, all of the PC magazines have articles like "What to do when Windows crashes again" or "How to protect your computer from all those awful PC viruses."  On the other hand, Mac magazines have fun articles about how you can use your super-wonderful-awesome-aesthetic Mac to do all sorts of great things.  I am a Mac user of one year, and I love my computer....no, worship is more the right word...and I'm not a technology person.  My computer is beautiful...his name is Max :)  My car, however, is more like a ruddy PC that likes to break and wreck my plans and cost me money.  Boooooooooooooo I say to my car.  this is a horrible blog, but the point is that I love my computer and hate my car.  If only I didn't need my car to get to work so that I could afford my computer.  Again, boooooooooooooooooooo I say!  Booooooooooo!

       I am taking (well, just finished taking) a class in Educational Policy Studies.  While these classes are always a thrill a minute and full of people who will spend their lives theorizing about education without having ever set foot in a classroom(where do you think No Child Left Behind came from?), this class had in it a bloke I found most irritating.  Here's the thing:  he didn't believe that things like tracking, biased testing, or racial stratification existed in schools.  It wasn't that he thought that these things weren't a problem, no he just didn't believe in them.  So obviously if he didn't believe in them, they must not exist and anyone who thinks that tracking and testing do exist must be stupid.  Yes, stupid.  This scintillating gentleman (who of course I had to be in a group with for the final project) actually called me stupid for believing in tracking and biased testing.  He thought it was ridiculous that I believed that members of the dominant (WASP) culture had an advantage over others.  He found it laughable that I believed that students who attend schools like New Trier (t.v. station that broadcasts to three different countries) had an advantage over students in places like East St. Louis (no toilet seats, not to mention textbooks).  I'm sure you can all understand my opinion on the matter at hand, so I won't bother to explain myself further except to say that it is people like this who are destroying education in the United States today!  It's no wonder that there is a teacher shortage!  Not only are (many) teachers grossly underpaid, but they are forced to work under legislature developed by "stupid" people like this boy in my class who have never set foot in a classroom!  How am I supposed to stay passionate about what I do when the reality is I will also have to follow the rules of "No Child Left Behind"?    Lots more to say on this, but it's late and I've still got papers to write!

       So, I'm getting married in 27 days.  Since it's on my mind, the impending marriage often comes up in conversations.  Lately, I've noticed that instead of saying congrats or asking me if I'm excited, the majority of people I talk to ask me if I'm nervous or scared.  I get told I'm so brave for getting married considering the divorce rate.  In general, people seem to be of the opinion that marriage is something that I have to do rather than something that I want to do.  Where is this coming from?  Did I miss the memo about being afraid of marriage?  There is certainly no box to check on my wedding checklist that tells me when to get cold feet.  It's not even so much that I don't understand why people are skeptical of marriage, but rather that they would impose their skepticism onto me.  Isn't it simply more polite to say congrats instead of "are you scared?"  Make no mistake.  Marriage is not something I'm being forced into.  I don't feel like I have to do it to satisfy social norms, my parents, or anyone else.  This marriage is not about taxes or legal issues.  It's not because I want to wear a white dress and eat cake.  I want to get married.  I am excited to take part in a ceremony that will declare my love for my future husband.  Nothing major will change in our lives after the ceremony, we already live together as husband and wife and I view Ted as my family.  But seriously, why this sudden fear of, and even disdain for marriage?  It's everywhere!  I'm no traditionalist by any means, and I certainly respect a person's right not to get married.  Is it too much to ask that you respect my right to marry?

       Wow!  After spending an hour trying to create a name for my blog that no one else was using, I finally made it.  While Toot and Puddle was not my first (or even 30th) choice, I am surprisingly happy to be Tood and Puddle.  More later after I figure the rest of the hoo-ha out.

       I was talking with a friend about the whole concept of blogging last night, and he brought up several interesting points.  One being that blogging is somewhat self-absorbed, and they other being why not just keep a journal.  I've done a lot of thinking, and I agree that blogging is pretty self-absorbed.  The whole idea is to post your innermost thoughts and opinions and let other people read it.  As for the whole journal issue, I've been a would-be journaler for years.  I just can't seem to get into writing my thoughts into a little book.  It seems such a waste of time to write to myself what I could just think to myself.  Thus, the interest in blogging.  I'll freely admit that the voyueristic quality of a blog lends a certain appeal to me.  I much more enjoy writing all this junk in my head when there is a chance that someone might read it.  It's not even so much that I want to spread my opinion, rather there is some comfort in the fact that the thoughts screaming in my head my find a small amout of validation in the world.  It's almost as if, if I just think the thoughts they have less meaning than if there is the possibility that the thoughts will be discovered.  Does this even make any sense?  I dunno, but it's my blog and I'll write whatever I want! :)

       I'm busy printing out programs for my wedding, and since I was bored I decided I might blog.  I really haven't got anything exciting to say, but that's ok....no one will read this anyway! :)  Spring semester grades are already posted!  I'm sad to say that my 4.0 Grad School GPA has been dashed to pieces by a wicked little A- that I got in that crappy EPS class I had to take.  Oh well, I'm surprised I didn't do worse considering the way I mouthed off to the teacher about what real education is like rather than listening to him talk about education as if it existed in a vacuum.  Still no word from the Peace Corps.  I'm starting to get really frustrated with them.  Luckily Ted is super-optimistic and keeps me from being overly anxious as I was from some government nurse to grant us the medical clearance we need to serve.  That's all there is.....  Does anyone have any good books I need to read this summer?  Oh wait, no one reads this so no one will answer....but if no one happens to have any suggestions I would more than welcome them!

       What I like about blogging is that I can rant and vent about things that I don't like about people without having to be rude to someone's face.  This blog is essentially going to be about how certain people annoy me...So if you don't care to read about it, quit now.  I've taken to exploring the world of my fellow bloggers to see what they could blog.  I've decided that there are WAY too many people who can't seem to form their own thoughts.  Foucault this and Nietzsche that.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for reading philosophers and discovering the theories, thoughts, and whatnot of others.  I think it's great to use the thoughts of others to expand your mind.  But Foucault is only one man and he doesn't know everything.  I think it's dumb to put all your chips into one school of thought.  At least learn how to apply what you've read in Philosophy for Dummies to the world as it exists today.  Read as much as you can....And then form your own thoughts and opinions about it.  Please.  Another kind of person that I've been running into a lot lately is "He Who Knows Everything" or "Let Me Tell You Why I'm Better Than You".  Very annoying.  You don't know everything so get over it.  For whatever reason, I seem to be bumping into this type of person more and more lately.  Example...Tonight at a bar I meet someone I've never met before (who also turns out to be one of those people who expects that I should be afraid of marriage).  He says "Hi I'm ________ and you're Erin.  I've been to your apartment before when our mutual friend was watching your cat.  I noticed your Tori Amos CDs......I got over that phase a long time ago."  Well congratulations darling.  Obviously you are so much better than me.  I really should explain further to justify my annoyance, but it seems pretty clear to me that someone I don't know snooping in my apartment and then using that snooping against me when we meet is annoying.  And I don't feel the need to justify my annoyance to the no one who reads this.  I'm so glad that you were able to "get over" Tori Amos.  However, Tori got me through dark times following a violent sexual assault, so quit judging me because you've decided you're above that type of music.  Let's conclude with happy thoughts....I'm getting married in 12 days to the most wonderful person I know.....And that makes me better than everyone else :)  Just kidding!

       Since it's been awhile since I've blogged, I figured I'd better write something.....  I've been married for almost 2 weeks now.  The wedding was the most fabulous it could have been and I quite enjoyed myself.  Not only did I get to look awesome and marry Ted, but everyone we love was there!  And I hear the food was good....I only tasted a few green beans because my dress was so tight I couldn't eat!  One nice thing about getting married is all the money people give you.  We got close to $3000!  It was fun to put all that money in the bank.....but sadly, we then had a lot of bills to pay and it's most gone now :(  Even better than the money, however, are the awesome gifts that you get.  Registry gifts are always appreciated since we registered for the stuff because we like it.....but the non-registry gifts are WAY better.  I make a point of never buying anything off someone's registry, so I appreciate those who went to the trouble to actually think of something wonderful for us.  I won't list gifts because that's tacky, but let me just say that all non-registry gift items (excluding, of course, the shelf with chickens on it) were much loved and appreciated.  However, marriage is not all fun and money and presents.  Oh no.  One major annoyance has been the fact that both Ted's parents and my own called this week to say "Now that you are married, you're not on our health insurance anymore.  Have fun with that."  Let me tell you, this has been a royal pain in the ass.  I'm still insured as a grad student, but Ted isn't....and he needs insurance to pay for his prescriptions.  So, we figured it would be easy to add him to my graduate insurance.  I now finally understand what they GEO is always griping about.  Sure I can add him....that'll be $745 for the next two months!  Yeah right.  I then realized that I can get part time benefits at Borders....except open enrollment was closed.  But lucky for me....I had a "life event" (I got married) so I could still join!  Yippy I say!  Now all I need is proof that I got married.  Well, unlike every other county in this country, when you get married in Cook County you don't get a complimentary copy of your marriage certificate which is the only way anyone believes that you actually got married (by anyone I of course mean health insurance, social security, etc).  So I had the joy of calling Cook County and for $18 they are going to send me a piece of paper that proves I'm married.....but they can't send it today because Reagan died.  Now, I've got my proof, so I can get insurance, right?  Nope.  The drama continues because my darling Ted has a pre-existing condition, so the new insurance company won't insure him unless they have proof from the old insurance company that he was insured before.  So we call the old insurance company.....well, this has gone on for long enough and you all understand the aggravation.  Lesson to be learned -- make sure you parents tell you your insurance will end more than 24 hours before it ends.  I swear, I actually had more interesting things to blog about than insurance.....but it's gone now.  So I'll leave it with this....Ted and I each got our first pair of birkenstocks today and it was fun! :)  By the way...the blogging spellchecker suggested that I replace Ted's name with "teats".  I found that amusing! :)

       I've finished the first week of my last four week of graduate school!  It's crazy to think that I'll have a Masters degree in less than a month.....and that Ted and I will be moving away from the University.  It's crazy to think that in November I could be living in South Africa, or Madagascar, or just about any place Peace Corps volunteers can go.  Now if only they would hurry up with that damn medical clearance!  The word is that we'll hear in 2-4 weeks....but I doubt that's true.  It's so frustrating waiting to hear about the next step in your life from a government agency.  I'm taking two classes right now.  One of them is on Issues and Trends in Early Childhood Education.  I was excited to take this class because I love discussing me field.  I was surprised by the fact that most of the class isn't in Early Childhood.  In fact, most of them teach junior high or high school.  I thought then that this would be a great opportunity for me to spread the word about the importance of Early Childhood.  It seems, however, that they would rather talk about high school.  It's nearly impossible to get anyone to focus on the fact that this class is supposed to be about children ages birth-8 years.....not 12-18 years.  My favorite topic to date though, was when one teacher brought up this exciting questions "Why do we even need preschool?"  Yikes!  I then got to spend the next two hours defending my profession.  I'm too mentally exhausted to get into all the details of the importance of early childhood education....but perhaps in a future post.  Sadly, my other class isn't nearly as argumentative.  It's interdisciplinary Teaming Methods....which I've had the pleasure of learning about and practicing in nearly all of my other Special Education classes.  So...it's really boring.  And we have to take quizzes!  I haven't had an exam, let alone a quiz in nearly 3 years.....I really don't see why this is necessary in my very last class in Grad. School!  The whole point of a quiz is basically to make sure that you do the reading.  If, at the Graduate level, a person chooses not to do the reading, I think that is a decision that they are capable of making.  I almost always read....I think articles about my career are interesting.  However, in this class we read chapters that include definitions of who the teacher, special education teacher, occupational therapist, social worker, etc are.  I know who these people are....I'm on of them and I've been working with them for years.  I don't think reading about who they are is really beneficial to me.  Well, that's all the blog I've got for know.  I know that you, my nonexistent yet adoring audience that is the internet, must have enjoyed reading :)

       I am anxious and cranky.  Not even watching every episode of Buffy ever made seems to be working to cheer me up.  Hence the lack of blogging because blogging requires motivation, and motivation is something that I never have when I am anxious and cranky.  Why so cranky you ask?  Where to begin....  Well, there is the fact that I have only 3 days of classes left.  Yikes.  I'll have a masters degree and will be done with school until the time I am ready to return for my PhD.  I've never not been in school, so that's kind of freaky.  But it isn't really the done that's freaking me out so much as it is the leaving.  In just about a month, I'll be moving in with my parents again.  Now, married and living at my dad's house is something that I never planned on being, but that is now part of my shamble of a plan.  I don't want to leave here if I don't have to.....here is where I know how to be who I am.  I don't know how to do that there.  And this brings us to the "if I don't have to" part of our show.  You see, I'm totally willing to pack up all my belongings, give away my cat, and move into my dad's basement with no real job IF and only IF we can leave for the Peace Corps in November.  I'm not willing to be homeless, jobless, and catless if the Peace Corps is going to tell us that we can't go.  I'm willing to make very significant sacrifices in my life for the chance to serve with the Peace Corps, but I don't think it's fair for them to ask me to make these sacrifices when all they've told us so far is that we will "probably" go.  I'd hate to have passed up several very exciting teaching jobs because I can't sign a contract, and I'd hate to move into my dad's house because I can't sign a lease......all just for a maybe.  And then of course, there's always the fun of explaining to people every single day why we haven't heard anything yet....We are still waiting for medical clearance.  Apparently it takes forever.  That's all we know.  Please stop asking.  We promise you will be the first to know as soon as we hear anything.  I just feel like my life is in limbo right now.  I've always had a plan for what comes next....and if I had things my way, the plan would be to hang out at my dad's for a few months until we leave for Africa.  Unfortunately, the plan is not for me to make right now.  The plan all lays in the hands of some nurse in D.C.  Her plan is about the same as mine unless she decides not to clear us....and then of course there is no backup plan.  I would have a backup plan except for the whole can't sign a lease can't sign a teaching contract issue.  And that's why I'm anxious and cranky.

       Ted and I are moving next week.  We're packing up and leaving college behind for good.  It's all very strange and I don't know how to feel about it.  I love our apartment, and I like living in Urbana......I like my job, school, all of that.  But school is over now so we've gotta leave.  I guess it might be easier if we had some clue as to what was going to happen next.  I mean, Ted and I plan on joining the Peace Corps, but that decision is really out of our hands now.  We're moving in with my parents while we wait to hear one way or the other.  It's strange and uncomfortable leaving your fate in the hands of someone you've never met.  Our recruiter tells us not to worry, but how can I not worry when I have to put my whole life on hold for something that may not happen.  As it is, I'm sick of talking about the Peace Corps since it's all anyone ever asks us about....so no more on that subject.  There are some benefits to being done with school other than the satisfaction of having a Master's Degree in a field I'm super passionate about.  I finally have time to do things other than school!  Red and I just bought a bunch of new books, and I love having the time to sit down and really enjoy them.  Right now I'm reading Anna Karenina, and even though Oprah chose it for her silly book club, I have to give her (or whoever chooses Oprah's books) credit for choosing a truly beautiful translation.  It is so truly fabulous to be able to enjoy a book without that little nagging voice in my head telling me I really should be reading this article or writing this paper.  I've also recently taken up knitting and jewelry making.  I had to have two hobbies because knitting takes a long time to create a product so I need the instand gratification of jewelry making.  I was talking to Ted the other day about how I have discovered this amazing joy that comes with making something with your hands.  My whole life I've been that smart girl who reads books and I never fully appreciated or realized the other kinds of intelligence I could possess.  There is a great satifaction that comes from creating a piece of fabric out of two stick and some yarn or taking tiny random beads and putting them together to create something beautiful.  I feel like most of my life has focused on school and on learning from books, and now I've discovered a whole new way to learn.  That's all for now, packing calls....

        	 		 		 So, in my boredom as a lonely married lady, I decided to play with my blog again, and I discovered how to post cute pictures of my husband and I.  On another note....how is married life?  I get asked this question at least a hundred times a day.  So, listen up all you nonexistent blog readers:  Married life is lovely and I highly recommend it....except for the part where once you get married you never see each other anymore.  That's kind of a bummer.  Seriously though, when you know you've married an amazing person, nothing is more wonderful than being married to that person.  It's great to wake up every day and see that person and know that you are going to live this amazing adventure called life.  So, that's how married life is. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Erin &amp; Ted in Florida 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink toot and puddle .

       I really am horrible at this whole packing thing.  As if packing weren't normally bad enough, Ted and I have to pack up stuff that we plan to possibly not see again for two years but also pack up stuff that we will need/want to use in the next several months.  So basically we have to do a lot of sorting.  Some stuff obviously goes in the won't be needed for two years pile such as our blender or our dishes.  My dad will certainly have these things available for our usage.  However, books and CDs are trickier.  Some books are packed away, but we still have boxes of books yet to be read.  The sorting of our hundreds of CDs is particularly painful.  CDs we haven't looked at in months suddenly look so enticing.  And who knows, maybe in October will come the day when I desperately need to listen to the Bangles again!  I'm always thinking I'm going to need things that I won't need!  Speaking of packing, I really should get back to it.....

       Well, this is really only the most recent of numerous incidents that have led me to loathe, despise, and otherwise hate that oh so awful phone company known as SBC.  How's about a little story kiddies?  Not so long ago....just about a year ago to be exact....a lovely and charming young woman named Erin called SBC to have the set up her DSL so that she could enjoy the internet all day long.  Now, at the time, if you didn't sign up for a year of serivce, DSL service cost $50/month.  If you did sign up for a year, DSL service only cost $30/month.  Now, being the lovely, charming, and honest girl that she is Erin tells the SBC lady that she isn't sure she can commit to a year of service since she may be moving out of the country.  Now listen up darlings because this is extremely important:  The DSL lady says "Oh, well it's your lucky day because if you move to an area where SBC cannot provide DSL service than the $200 early cancellation fee is waived."  So, Erin thought this was great and agreed to a year of service.  Suddenly it's August again and it is time for our heroine to move on.  It is just 3 weeks shy of completing her year of DSL service with SBC, but she figures there will be no problems since she is leaving the country.  She could not have been more wrong.  New DSL lady says, "It sounds like you were given some misinformation.  I'm sorry that you were given this misinformation but since you were misinformed we will have to charge you that $200 fee."  Erin, of course, asks to speak to a supervisor.  After a long and heated battle over the misinformation Erin learns this about DSL service:  If you move to an area where SBC cannot provide DSL service than the cancelation fee is waived IF AND ONLY IF you continue phone service.  If you move to an area where SBC cannot provide DSL OR phone service than you must pay the cancellation fee.  How does this make sense???  Luckily, Erin is very good and yelling at SBC professionals on the phone until she gets her way.  They agree that she will not have to pay the cancellation fee since she was given misinformation (i.e. blatantly LIED to).  However, they will first have to charge her the fee and then she can call them back to have it removed.  How does this make sense????  Moral of this story:  Do not believe anything SBC employees tell you!  Yell at them when they lie to you!  And most important of all....get the name and employee ID number of everyone you ever talk to there so that when you call back to get the cancellation fee removed you can say that Sean, employee ST41704, said that it was ok.  We wouldn't want there to be any misinformation, now would we?
