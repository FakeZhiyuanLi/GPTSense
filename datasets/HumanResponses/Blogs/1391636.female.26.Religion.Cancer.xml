       1/1998   I failed You again, broke my promises  When will I ever get it right?  This path is so narrow, so hard, so straight  I keep stumbling, unable to keep up the pace it seems everyone else is going  Don’t want to be left behind  Don’t want to lose face  But there You are, reminding me of what’s important   At the foot of the cross  I lay down my fears  At the foot of the cross  I shed m tears  I lay my burdens down  I lay my burdens down   I rise off my knees, feeling so lightweight I could almost fly  Carefree, I begin down the path again  Not paying attention, I slowly collect things of this world  They begin to weigh me down  And I begin to stumble again  Face down, You once again carry me back to Your love   At the foot of the cross  I lay down my fears  At the foot of the cross  I shed m tears  I lay my burdens down  I lay my burdens down

       &nbsp;1/1998   As I find my way home,  Returning from giving in to my sin,  I am reminded of the Jewish tradition of sacrifices to atone for sin,  And also that there is no sacrifice for intentional sin,  No way to be outwardly cleansed of the dirt that covers my body, my soul.   The cross, where Your Precious Son shed His blood so that I might spend an eternity in Heaven with You  The cross, where the Ultimate Sacrifice was paid for all sin, unintentional or not  This precious gift I do not deserve, find hard to receive such grace, such love  And I know how much You must love me   You can’t even look at me, while I’m covered in my sin  I cry out to You, but You are unable to help me in Your Holiness  Yet You point my vision elsewhere  I follow Your finger, and at last my gaze falls on The Answer   The cross, where Your Precious Son shed His blood so that I might spend an eternity in Heaven with You  The cross, where the Ultimate Sacrifice was paid for all sin, unintentional or not  This precious gift I do not deserve, find hard to receive such grace, such love  And I know how much You must love me

       1993   There’s a butterfly in my coffee  There’re clouds in my tea  Ever since you walked out the door  The sky’s been fallin on me   I am a cemetery plot  And I’m taking the bus to come see you  I’m bringing a can of yellow spray paint  And a pile of rubber dog doo   Stop signs have turned purple  And seem to say “go”  Houses drop on “Glenda”  And why, I just don’t know   I saw my Sunday-school teacher  Trimming a bush  That was wearing a flannel shirt   I walked up to my gym shirt  And asked “want some travel brochures?”  The bushes turned around  And it said “boo”  While I ate my lunch of jell-o   I wanted to eat a “barney” magnet  And sit back  And just be mellow   I put dirt in my room  To grow flowers in the floor  I used to hunt kids in the street  But got caught and don’t know more   I am a cemetery plot  And I’m taking the bus to come see you  I’m bringing a can of yellow spray paint  A pile of rubber dog doo   Follow me down the “yellow road”  Where aminals fear to tread  Drink of me  And eat of me  And soon we shall be dead   G  There may be acceptance   Climb to the threshold of  Your own beliefs  Not with the statement  Of others

       1998   She was a peculiar woman, he thought while nursing the margarita and a bad headache. He looked out through dark sunglasses at the volleyball players on the beach, young and tan. He hated the way she’d left last night, but he knew he couldn’t have stopped her even if he’d wanted to. She needed this time alone, he knew.

       1994   I’m not really sure how it all started. It was one of those things where one day, life was just… different. And I knew it – there was a different smell in the air, the sky was just slightly more violet, and life tasted different, more… deep. I could tell today something was going to happen. Something just had to! I’d gotten so bored with my life the way it was. Every day it was the same story: wake up and get ready, drive to Dusek and Schauer where I worked as an “administrative assistant,” which is just a fancy title for a secretary.

       1998   She sat down at the desk to write the brief note, perhaps for the last time. Pausing, Claire thought of all the years that had passed so quickly. They had met nearly thirty-four years earlier. It had been late summer, same as now. From the moment she had met Eric they had been best friends. On that first day of college they had both been scared, although she too proud and stubborn to admit it. Finding themselves in a strange new world and alone, they clung to their new friendship. Boldly, they fought the world together, from eight o’clock classes to final exams. And, of course, the perpetual rumors about their relationship. “We’re just friends,” they both claimed to their friends and anyone who pestered them. There were the brave few who pressed on, boldly making claims for the future: “You two will be married one day, I’m sure.” Claire and Eric both laughed off the annoying outsiders, and clung tighter to each other, knowing no one else truly understood.   Always a perfect gentleman, he never took advantage of the closeness she allowed him. He never took liberties other men would have. She grew to admire him for that. Both talked of the days they would marry and stand in each other’s weddings. They dreamed of being Uncle Eric and Aunt Claire to the other’s children. They laughed about growing old and joked that when their spouses died, they’d marry. Claire and Eric did all the things best friends did, fighting against society when it assumed the nature of their friendship.   Life went on for several years like that. They both graduated and found jobs, pursuing the American dream. Claire dated, as did Eric, but nothing seemed to work out. When Eric turned twenty-eight, suddenly feeling very old (Claire laughed to think of the naivety then), he began to examine his life. Claire and Eric spent many late nights on the phone or out for coffee talking about the past nine years. Both feeling like things hadn’t gone according to the plan (for that was to marry shortly after graduation and start families) and questioning if they ever were going to find themselves the “right” person, they grew melancholy and nearly desperate.   Separately but together they came to the decision to marry each other. It seemed almost natural. After all, everyone else had seen this years ago. No one was surprised, not even their closest friends. For their honeymoon, Claire and Eric traveled to Mexico, not far from their Tucson apartment. As they got promotions and Claire changed jobs, they moved into a modest house in a safer neighborhood, bought new cars, and paid off their college loans. They found out a few years into their marriage Claire was unable to have children, and although Eric was disappointed at first, he easily adjusted and rarely brought the topic up after that.   They went on vacations and traveled the states, and in their later years, Europe as well. Eric got involved in a few sports teams and later joined the country club. Claire busied her time outside of work with some women’s groups and research for her projects. Life just went on. The days and months turned into years. And suddenly, Claire found herself here, married for twenty-five years at the age of fifty-six, completely bored with her life. She hadn’t expected constant adventures with Eric, or passion, for she’d never felt that for him. It had been a marriage of great comfort for both of them, always able to talk to each other about anything. The transition from best friends to lovers hadn’t even been that awkward, all things considered.   And, Claire reasoned with herself, she really had no right to expect or demand anything more than she had. After all, she had a devoted and loving husband, a nice home, a decent job. But there was something missing. In all of her practicality and reasoning, she had never figured in romance, passion. Claire found herself looking back, not with regret, but with longing. She desired candlelight dinners and kisses on her hand and sweet embraces. She wanted more than casual conversation over dinner and mediocre sex. Claire, however, couldn’t ask Eric to change. In fact, she didn’t want him to. It wasn’t exactly his fault he wasn’t romantic. She couldn’t expect her best friend to act that way.   So she found herself, the last few days, packing her bags, making plans without Eric, buying plane tickets. She wasn’t leaving him, Claire had told herself, but she was taking a vacation. She couldn’t bring herself to consciously realize that she would probably never return. Eric was the only complication. She wasn’t sure how to tell him without it sounding like his fault. But time was slipping away, and she jumbled some words onto the paper. Closing the desk, she placed the note on the counter for Eric to see when he came home. Picking up her bags, she glanced around one last time before closing the door. Walking down the front walk, she could hear the phone ringing inside. Claire stepped into her car after tossing her luggage in the back seat – just a simple valise and her purse – and started her car. At the age of 56, Claire drove away from her life, in search of romance.

       7/1995   what did i ever do to  make you hate me?  i did not ask to be born...  you gave me life ON PURPOSE.  some would say that its  your JOB to love me –  UNCONDITIONALL.  that means no matter how  many times i screw up,  no matter how much i  distance myself from you,  your love will always be  there for me.  if that’s how you feel, i don’t  see it reflected in your  actions - they speak  louder than words,  although you don’t say  much either.  its my life and i can  do whatever i want to  with it.  that means whoever i want  to be or become i can  be. because i have the  right to make mistakes.  how can i learn anything  about life here, in  this atmosphere?  in accepting who you are  and who you want to be  and who others are,  how can you not accept  me too? but you haven’t.  perhaps you do not realize  that there is worse than  me. i am not evil  or a satan-worshiper.  i am smart, well-educated,  and have a purpose in  life. can you not see this?  i don’t deal drugs or  even do them. i’ve never  even tasted beer or any  other alcohol. i am  a virgin even. what is  wrong with me?  is it that my space is  “cluttered?” because what  is clutter to you is  organized to me – it  makes sense.  do you think my priorities  are all “wrong?” just because  they are not the same  as yours does not mean  they are wrong. different  goals require different  priorities. i am not  going to become you so  our priorities must be  different. if they were  the same, it would  be wrong.  NOT understanding is the  worst part. i ask  myself why?  my tears fall.

       Now I’ve come to a glitch in my faith life (one of many, I assure you). Here’s what I hate about this time of year. There’s so much to do, I hardly get any sleep, there’s always something more, and everyone’s stressed constantly. AND THEN. As if that’s not enough for Satan to use to screw me up and draw me away from God, he’s gotta actually do more. And then he goes and attacks me somehow, whether it’s through something at home or a relationship or work or school or whatever. But I don’t even have the time or energy or the strength to fight back! When I need to be on my knees most is when I “can’t.”   It’s just not fair! He hits when we’re down. It’s low. It’s sneaky. It’s Satan. I just don’t know what to do now. It’s just that there’s this one thing on top of everything else that’s unavoidable, that one thing that my mind focuses on instead of the other stressful stuff, but honestly is, in itself, stressful stuff. And if I’m not being rendered useless enough by finals etc., there has to be more on top of it.   So, to make a long story short… Do I give up? No, that’s the point. No matter how much I submit and give up and know God’s will and want God’s will and strive for that in all my actions and being, my “heart” still wants… the other. Why can’t they line up? Why can’t my desires go away or die or whatever? I don’t get it!   Maybe it’s all… God’s safety net. It’s the desire that keeps me in submission to God. So is God “torturing” me with this predicament because He wants to keep me in submission? That’s not my Jesus. He’s using my desires for His glory, yes. But I give them up and they just come back to me. And I’ve asked God, does that mean I get to keep them? No answer. But status quo. It’s the thorn in my flesh.   It goes back to this – Satan is a big jerk. Paul’s thorn in his flesh kept him in submission, kept him focused and humble. Mine’s just making me… frustrated. And how do I live for today? In submission.   It’s this constant battle we live in, between the desires of the flesh and the willingness of the spirit to obey. Many times the flesh wins out, and we act upon our desires. It’s called sin. But there are many times when the spirit is obeyed. Just because we are not in sin does not mean, however, that the sinful flesh’s desires are gone. We can be in complete submission to the will of God with our actions, and the wants of the human nature are still there. Submission does not take those away.   Submission is not just actions, though. We are called to submit… everything, to His authority. Everything is under the authority of Jesus Christ. This means not only actions but desires and thoughts and dreams and feelings and everything else.   And submission is not just a one-time event, but a continuing process. It must be done over and over and over again. We live life minute by minute, and so also must submission take place.   Submission is an interesting thing. I had submitted my will to God before, in the sense that I knew what He wanted me to do and so I gave up my plans and took on His. He then filled in all the necessary details, like motivation and talents and passions. And I suppose on a smaller scale I submit to God every day when I am obedient to His commands.   But this summer, I learned a deeper meaning of submission. I am sure that I do not know the breadth of submission, but I have felt the depth. Submission involves a lot more than just knowing God’s will and doing it. You don’t have to know what God wants of you in order to submit. You just have to trust Him. Know that His plan is better than yours will ever be. Believe that He will take care of you, that He will honor your sacrifice, and that He will do something wonderful with it. Trusting Him is a hard one. Even harder is trusting the other people involved.   I learned that it was a lot easie6r to submit to God when I knew the other people in the situation were living lives in obedience to His will, that they would listen to Him. But when I didn’t trust others to be living that kind of life, it was harder to submit. It’s not that I didn’t trust God. But in a sense, I didn’t. I trusted Him to work through people who were obedient to Him, but I was unable to grasp that He could work through people who weren’t. That takes a lot of trust!   Another thing about submission is that it is hard. I didn’t want to. I knew what I had to do, what I was called to do, and I just held on to my desires and my dreams anyway. The amazing thing about God is that when we do something out of obedience, even if we don’t want to, He honors that. Yes, He cares about our motivation and He wants us to willingly obey Him. But He honors our obedience even when we’re not willing.   Submission can be a kind of test. There are some things that we have to give up just so that we’ll get them back again. There are some things that we have to give up so that they can be purified before God returns them to us. There are some things we have to give up that we will never get back. It’s a test of our faith, our trust in God.   The funny thing about submission is that we know all about it. We hear about it in church, we read passages in the Bible about it, we know the stories of people who’ve done it. But we so rarely experience it ourselves. We do not know what submission is, on a personal level. Intellectually, we understand. But in our hearts, we do not.   Without actually going through the process of submission, we cannot know the amazing… response within us. It is a feeling of freedom, and of peace. We now know deep within us that God is truly in control. He always was, but we are able to truly acknowledge it within the depths of our hearts. We don’t have to pretend like we are in control any more. We are no longer responsible for what happens. God is in charge. We are free to continue living life, being obedient to Him. There is peace, knowing His will is perfect and is what is best, for us and for His glory.   And yet I come back to the point that submission cannot be everything. I can be in complete and total submission, but I will still be human. My human nature, my desires and wants and wills and dreams, will be in constant conflict with the spirit of Christ within me. This is irreconcilable! There is a constant battle going von, between the flesh and the spirit. The Bible talks about this over and over again.   So where does this leave us? At the point of grace. Flesh and spirit will always fight, and the spirit will not always sin. There will always be sin in the believer’s life; we cannot escape our human nature. God knows this. He desires us to be perfect, true, and we should always strive for this. But there is a wonderful thing called grace for when we fail. My sins do not come between me and God because of His grace. Because of His justice, there had to be an atonement made for all my sins. But because of His grace and His love, He sent His Son Jesus Christ to die and be that atonement. I do not have to die because of my sin. I can have heaven because of Jesus. That is grace.

       “a whimsical semi-biographical tale”  1997     Prologue   The amazement in my eyes I’m sure is visible to anyone who notices me walking down the street. This was not what I knew of Chicago. I knew the poor, the filthy, the hungry. The people were mean and scary in themselves, without even making a move. Around them I felt like a thin wisp of lace at the edge of my memory, ready to crumple into nonexistence at the slightest touch or noise. But here on this street, amidst the lush green trees, the brick sidewalk, the blooming flowers carefully planted behind locked gates, and towering high rises with their noble residences, here I felt like a fine tapestry, protected and valuable, yet on display for all to regard its’ beauty. Here, walking down North Erie Street, I felt safe, guarded, and grown-up.      Chapter 1    It all began two months ago. Late at night, after working a long day at a boring desk job – clerical, mostly – I tried to relax by exploring the world outside my bedroom, using the phone as my connection to the vastness that constantly escapes me. On the computer screen before me, an ad flickered, changing. I usually don’t even notice ads, because I’m not interested, and even if I am, I don’t have any money to buy anything. For some reason, though, the new ad caught my eye. “Free 30 day trial. Tired of spending nights alone?”

       I worked a summer in San Francisco, with four other college students, and countless needy people. In two months, the five of us worked with over 500 people in 27 youth groups, servicing over 20 organizations. We worked six or more days a week together, most of the time over 17 hours a day. We spent our days “off,” as rare as they were, together – in pairs or as a group. Some of us built very strong and close friendships. My best friends that summer turned out to be Jason and Lisa. Jason and I went to church together, ate meals together on our days off, went shopping, and would just hang out. Since everyone else had to work on July 4th, we decided to go to the fireworks together. We walked to North Beach, where we went to this cool Italian restaurant. Over pizza, and later waiting for the fireworks, we talked about a lot of things, including God, our faith, and relationships.   Later, reviewing the day and our conversations, as well as the situation in general, I came to one conclusion: Jason was in love with me. He had been hinting at it and I had been avoiding it. Now the dilemma was mine: I was pretty sure I didn’t love him that way, and we had to work the whole week together. I was in emotional agony the whole week. I felt I couldn’t talk to anyone because we all worked so closely together. Finally, I broke down and confronted Lisa; she was his other best friend. She confessed it was true. I attempted to confront Jason several times, but didn’t want to be too assertive. He said a couple of times he wanted to talk to me, but either the timing was bad or he would change his mind. Six weeks later, on the night before I returned to Chicago, I finally confronted him and forced him to talk to me. It was our last chance for a face-to-face heart-to-heart.   So it all came out. By this time I had figured out in my own heart what my feelings were, and what God’s will was. I loved him, but God’s will was not for us to be together. It sounds so simple, put into one sentence, but there was a lot of prayer, searching, tears, and agony behind those decisions. And so I had to share with Jason where I was, and in a way that he would not be hurt. The story doesn’t end here, but for my purposes, it does (you can ask me some time for the rest of the details, but not if you’re in the mood for a good love story).   So, why this story? One reason, two examples. This story illustrates a very Biblical concept we often fail to do: speak the truth in love. There was a whole lot of turmoil, pain, and agony, most of it unnecessary, in this story, for all involved. Jason should have talked to me in the first place, instead of telling Lisa, or at least when it became necessary because it was affecting our jobs. I should have spoken to him when I found out, and when I had peace from God about the situation. So that was the BAD example. The good one: we actually did sit down and talk, and though we weren’t brutally honest, we did speak the truth in love. No, it wasn’t easy, and it did hurt a little, as well as put us both in very vulnerable positions, but it also felt good. To finally speak truthfully and be able to deal with it all, it felt good.   Now speaking the truth in love didn’t solve anything right away, but it set us on a path where we were able to deal with it. We would have stayed friends until the tension became unbearable and drove us apart. Our friendship wouldn’t have lasted to Christmas. As it is, we have been able to remain friends over a long distance (he is now in DC) and despite many differences.   I believe we need to, as Christians, speak the truth in love more often. What exactly does this mean? First, it means talking, right away, to the person(s) involved and not to third parties. This is Biblical. Secondly, it means speaking the truth. I understand that truth is open, sometimes, to interpretation, but it is not open for creative additions, or noteworthy subtractions. A lot of the time, we don’t like the truth – it doesn’t serve our needs, or detracts from our agenda, or is uncomfortable. But, nonetheless, the truth is requir6ed by God. Lastly, it means being loving. We need to consider the other person: their feelings, their perspectives, their background, their live situation, etc.   As a church body, as Christians, as brothers and sisters, we need to speak the truth in love. Because we love Christ, because we love our church, because we love each other, we need to make a conscious effort to always speak the truth in love. I think we’ll all be pleasantly surprised with the results, on our relationships, on our church, and on our community

       Bed so empty, me alone  Rumpled sheets, wrinkled clothes lay on the floor  12:00 flashes on the VCR  Power went out again  Rain splatters against the side of our – my – trailer from a dangling gutter  Dishes lay unclean in the sink  TV still blaring sports – how you left it  Time stands still  I am frozen without you life seems motionless  Star at the door – will you walk back through any moment?  Phone rings and your voice answers on the machine  I run my hand over where you always are  The place seems still warm from your body  How can I move on, forget  So used to doing everything with you  Can barely breath  Get up, shower, change clothes, eat, try to start anew  Door swings open – you, with flowers and an apology

       Has anyone really figured this life thing out?  I see so many people rushing through their days  How did they decide who they were?   Did they read a book, watch a movie, talk to a friend  Or did they just know?   Everyday decisions, the little and the big  How do I know wha'ts right and what's wrong?  Everything seems good  All my options are great  But what am I supposed to do?   If life were a book  I'd read the last page first  Just to know  Which choices I'd made  Let's just sit for a while  And read to each other  Pages of the chapters of our lives   Adventures in lands afar  Like 'Frisco, Arizona, and Budapest  Homebound adventures that changed the world  Yesterday I was becoming  Who I am today  But who will I be tomorrow?   The dreams for my life  Will they ever come true?  A home and a family and a chance at my mission  If they don't, will I become  Bitter and jaded and hard  I want to stay open  I want to feel free  And keep on pursuing "me"

       I've just finished moving my poetry and (mostly unfinished) short stories to this blog from my old aol account. I tried to include the date wherever I had them, when they were originally written.

        “Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.” Song of Solomon 2:7     The volumes of wisdom held deep within that short utterance are inescapable. Solomon speaks of patience, of waiting on God’s perfect timing. He does not offer these words lightly, as if waiting casually for one’s beloved is an easy thing to do. They bring to one’s attention the complete surrender of one’s own will to God’s perfect will which is absolutely necessary for a healthy love life and a healthy person.   How exactly does one wait on God for something that seems so much a necessity as the air we breathe and the food we eat? To be honest, that’s something I’m still working von. The first step is to realize that the God we serve loves each of us very much. He took precaution in the creation of the world, making sure that our every NEED has been taken care of. There is ample food on this earth, though we may mismanage it, for none to go hungry. There is ample air in our atmosphere for all to breathe, though we pollute it and endanger our descendants. Most of us can say that we have always had a roof on our heads and a bed to sleep in and we fail to acknowledge the gracious provision of God in those little things. And those who have had to go without know that even in their time of need, God provided some way, somehow, and brought them through.   So our loving God who takes care of all our needs is the one to whom we should look to when we are feeling needy, as though we are going to be overcome with loneliness, or that we will simply wither away without a significant other, or when we are tempted to fulfill our needs in ways that God would not approve of. And as we turn to Him, He shows us that indeed all of our needs are taken care of. Feeling lonely? God surrounds us with friends and family who love us. And when they aren’t around, we always can turn to Him and His infinite love to comfort and care for us. Feeling needy? God shows us time and time again what our real needs are. Take an honest look at your life. Do you really NEED a boyfriend or girlfriend? Or do you simply WANT one, to fit in, to make you feel loved, to help you struggle through the tough times, to fulfill your desires? If you honestly look deep within yourself and can evaluate your reasons for searching for a partner, you will hopefully find wants, needs, and desires that God can and will fulfill in other ways. Our God is incredibly creative, just look at the creation around us! And He can definitely be creative in the ways He chooses to fulfill our needs.   So I don’t really NEED a boyfriend or girlfriend, you say, but I really WANT one. Well, that’s good! God did not create us to live as islands unto ourselves. He created us to live together, to live in community with each other, to form friendships and relationships, to have families, to love each other. And He gave us the wonder of male-female relationships and the spectacularness of marriage. He also created, in His perfect will, the perfect time to give us those special relationships. To not wait on His perfect timing is to turn to God and say, “Your will is not good enough for me. You have not provided for all of my needs. I’m taking matters into my own hands.” Too many people today do this, and end up with broken hearts, broken relationships, broken marriages.   I myself have succumbed to the lie that I am in control of my life and that I can provide for my own “needs” through relationships that were not God’s will. Through God’s grace, I have suffered no deep harm. I carry no scars from physically intimate relationships. My heart has not been broken because I’ve loved the wrong man. In my pursuit of ridding myself of the loneliness I’ve felt through dating relationships, God was always right there, making sure that I didn’t make any mistakes that would harm me permanently. And He kept protecting me in that way until I could finally see with my own eyes that my own pursuit was not satisfying me.   When I finally was able to realize that I would never be able to have my needs met until I surrendered them to God, what a deep and immeasurable sense of calm and peace I felt! The burden to provide for myself was lifted. I then knew that I would never do without that which I truly needed. And if I didn’t have what I was seeking, it was because God knew that I didn’t NEED it as I thought I did.   To truly surrender in my quest for love and a marriage partner, for me, involves taking a step back from dating. The destructive ways that dating can affect us are innumerous and also inescapable. This surrender also involves sitting back and waiting, as patiently as I can (which I must admit is not that much), for God to tell me to proceed. To me it means not pursuing a relationship with any man other than one of friendship. For right now, that path that God desires for me to walk on is one of singleness. I hope and pray that one day that will change, and in my humanness I hope that day is sooner rather than later. But whenever God chooses to bless me with the privilege of marrying – for that’s what marriage is, a privilege – whenever that is, I know that it will be the right time. When the time is finally right, I know that I will be ready, that my future husband will be ready, and that God will be in our relationship so strongly bonding us together and to Him that we will be together “till death do us part.”

       She lived in a humble but sufficient apartment, deep within the heart of the city, with her husband and children. Although on the streets outside were crowded and noisy, the constant interruptions of life and death ever-present, the small apartment offered a homely refuge, such that upon entering, visitors nearly forgot where they were. As she walked down the streets during the day, her heart was constantly broken for those she saw, the men and women sleeping on the sidewalk, passed out from too much drinking or drugs the night before, often in pools of their own urine and vomit, and the men and women who were always to be found, selling goods to ease the pain of day to day life, or selling themselves in order to live until the next bitter day in the heartless city.   But inside that small apartment was love, a love that bound the family together, daily drawing the children home to after school snacks instead of what the streets had to offer, drawing her husband home after work instead of to the bars or worse, and drawing herself home despite the continuous and overwhelming needs of the people who live unlike herself. For the work was never done, the needs never filled, the hurting never gone. The love inside those walls offered a refuge, a place of comfort despite the harsh realities of the world within which they all lived. They were not unaware that the life they lived was filled so fully, and indeed they all felt blessed and daily praised their God for being so gracious to them.   She awoke each morning to the warmth of her husband lying beside her, offering sweet kisses before the day started. Lunches made for the children with loving notes on their napkins, breakfast served as they all sat at the small kitchen table together, the paper read by both herself and her husband before all left to go to school and work. She was always home before her children, and she offered cookies and milk, or carrots, and questions about their days of learning. They told stories from the playground, about new students, of lessons they learned inside and out of class. She sat with them as they did their homework at the kitchen table; no television until it was finished.   She prepared dinner, perhaps meatloaf or a casserole, or on Fridays a frozen pizza as a special treat alongside a rented movie. Her husband always arrived between five-thirty and six, depending on traffic and the availability of parking spots. When he came in, he would greet her with a kiss and a sparkle in his eye as he told her again and again how beautiful she was. He hugged and kissed his children, asking them about their day and telling them about his own. Their children would clear away their homework and set the table for dinner, as they then all sat down to dine together. Conversation was casual, parents affirming each child and gently pushing them to strive for mor8e than average and for better than what the streets had to offer. The love of the family grew stronger with each passing day, each word spoke in kindness, each pat on the back or kiss on the cheek.   After the children’s homework was done and it was time for bed, she would read each a story, or tell one she held deep within her heart of her own life or of someone who’s life she had had the privilege to come into contact with. The stories always filled their imagination with colorful images and provoked them to sleep filled with dreams. And as she tucked them in, she would sing of the love of their heavenly Father who would take them all home some day to a city far grander than the one they lived in. And then she would turn to bed as well, held tight in the arms of her husband as they spoke words of love to each other and renewed their promises to each other of life together.   Life was not without its struggles. Sometimes money was tight and they knew not where the rent would come from. Other times pain attacked them as the world was cruel, through teasing classmates or verbal abuse from those who were embittered by their own losses. And still there were times when life was cruel and dealt hard blows such as illness and death, and broken friendships with those who could not understand their life. But always, there was love. They clung to each other in the midst of life’s trials, knowing that again the clouds would roll away, the sun would shine, and laughter alongside happiness would again fill their small abode.   On Saturdays they drove outside of the city and the painful cruelty with which it constantly bombarded them, and they escaped to the countryside, the mountains and the beach. They would hike the hills and dunes, or rest on the long stretch of Oceanside beach, digging their toes into the warm sand. From the top of the hills they could look over the entire city and remember its beauty despite the pain it encapsulated. And from the beach they could look out across the ocean and imagine lives far different from their own in places they could only see in their dreams. Sometimes she would make up stories for her children, telling them of kings and emperors and princes who fought for women of honor, or of peasants and the happy lives they lived despite bondage and the simplicity of it all, or of faeries and all the mystical beings hidden to the human eye in forests far away.   Often they would return after the sun had gone down, sleepy children carried in each arm or slowly walking alongside to the car, and restfully returning to the city. The refreshing power of their days away was nothing compared to the renewing strength of Sunday mornings at church, where they went faithfully each week, along with the others who made up the small but devoted congregation. The pastor was a humble man who often spoke on the sacrifice of God by sending His Son Jesus Christ to a fallen world to save them because of His unconditional and unending love for humanity. The people struggled together, dealing with the losses life dealt them, but gaining strength from the believers around them.   And so life was good, though not flawless, it had in itself a feeling of perfection because it was filled with love and also pain, the reality of the world never overwhelming her family but somehow instead strengthening them and drawing them closer to each other and to their God. So they loved boldly, lived fearlessly, and knew they had been blessed far beyond their wildest dreams. And life was good.

       i think it is,  rather,  that you are the right  shape  for me  &nbsp;  tall enough to be  commanding  but not overpowering  &nbsp;  some would say  lanky  but it is just that you have  long limbs  (i have those too)  &nbsp;  i think your arms would  wrap around me  perfectly  to keep me warm and safe  &nbsp;  and my face would fit  just right  between your shoulders and jaw  where i would like to nestle it often  &nbsp;  indeed,  it appears to me that  our bodies are  two adjoining puzzle pieces

       i believe that you remind me of lavender  now, then, don't be offended at such a feminine notion  i meant in no way to compromise your masculinity  and, rather, i have no idea why this is true  its simply that, when i see the color, i think of you  or while reading books on herbs, the tall bodies bring to memory your form  and to smell it awakens all my senses to you

       can i miss you  when i don't know your name?  can i feel the burn of your lips  without ever experiencing it?  can my side feel cold because you're not there  although you never have been?  can silence hurt my ears so much  though i've never heard your voice?  can my tongue miss its dancing partner  without ever tasting you?  can my mind forget memories  we don't have?  can my heart be so lonely  without its other half?

       i still remember the details -  your hair, long and flowing  your eyes, deep and searching  your hands, large and comforting  &nbsp;  but, i cannot remember the big picture  how your body fits to mine  how your touch feels against my skin  how your voice sounds to my ears  &nbsp;  i am afraid i will forget it all soon  even the words you've said  even the looks you've given  even the smiles thrown shyly in my direction  &nbsp;  what then will i do  when you are less than a memory  but instead a distant feeling  like a still breeze  not quite escapable  but i am unable to grasp, define it  &nbsp;  what then will become of me  of you  of us?  if i cannot remember  did it ever happen

       you are on my mind  -sometimes only - don't flatter  yourself  i find myself asking  what could have become of us  had i not ended it all  and truthfully it scares me  &nbsp;  were i my mother at this age  i'd soon be getting married  awfully, frighteningly young it feels  at the same time  it makes me feel rushed  as if i needed to settle down  how quickly youth passes  &nbsp;  my thoughts return to you  although we haven't spoken in months  my fault, i suppose  but truthfully i can't really stand you  and i wonder how ever we lasted  as long as we did  i come up empty  &nbsp;  you are a passing thought  like a car down the street  here one moment  then gone forever  like that, you were in my life

       O, Ryan's belt  so shiny and new  with a big silver buckle  and a stripe of bright blue.  &nbsp;  He got it for Christmas  from his mom and dad,  so he wore it everywhere.  It was the only one he had.  &nbsp;  He wore it with jeans,  and his red-checkered shirt.  He wore it with shorts  as he played in the dirt.  &nbsp;  He wore it to church  with a bright blue bow-tie.  Ryan wore it to bed,  and all through the nigh'.  &nbsp;  One night in bed,  he was trying to sleep,  when up in the sky,  a sight made him leap.  &nbsp;  Three stars in a row,  shone, twinkling bright,  deep in the sky,  in the middle of the night.  &nbsp;  Just then, Mom came in.  In a soft voice she said,  "Ryan what are you doing?  Why aren't you in bed?"  &nbsp;  So Ryan, he pointed  to the three stars above.  Mom smiled at Ryan,  and spoke to him with love.  &nbsp;  "My son, those three stars,  what do they look like?  Not a baseball or a TV,  not like his bike.  &nbsp;  Ryan thought hard,  then he said with a smile,  "I know those three stars,  though it took me a while.  &nbsp;  "It's my belt!" he exclaimed,  and he jumped up and down.  Then Dad walked in,  wearing a frown.  &nbsp;  "What's all this?" Dad asked,  confused by the sight  of his son awake  in the middle of the night.  &nbsp;  "My belt, my belt!"  Ryan spoke with a shout.  Dad crossed the room,  and at the window looked out.  &nbsp;  "Where am I looking?"  Dad asked with a glimmer,  and Ryan, he pointed,  to the three-starred shimmer.  &nbsp;  "Those three stars?" Dad asked Ryan.  "I know what those are,  There the Belt of Orien,"  They all looked from afar.  &nbsp;  [Christ / Salvation something here - the "meat" of the story"]  &nbsp;  Now Ryan feels comfort  when he looks up above  and sees his blue belt.  He remembers the love  &nbsp;  of Jesus who died  on the cross for our sin.  He fought death and Satan,  and in the end, He did win.  &nbsp;  O, Ryan's belt,  he loves it so much,  but not like he loves  his Jesus' touch.

      For me, it's not a sexual temptation at all.&nbsp;    Not to be holier-than-thou or conceited or even blind to my own humanness - it's just never been an area I've been tempted in.&nbsp; Where I get caught is in emotional entanglements and crushes and things like that.&nbsp; The consequences are huge.&nbsp; I can't focus on ministry, on God, on what I'm supposed to be doing.&nbsp; Singleness is a gift from God and yet instead of reaping those benefits I drown in the consequences of crushes.&nbsp; God can't use me if I'm not focusing on Him.&nbsp; I struggle so muc in mis-interpreting coed relationships.&nbsp; That's one of the reasons I wanted a boyfriend or at least a serious prospect here before I go to San Francisco.&nbsp; It doesn't look like that's going to happen and that's ok because God is in control.&nbsp; But, I'm really worried about this summer.&nbsp; Three coworkers in ministry there, male, my age or older.&nbsp; And to me, one of the most attractive things in a guy is passion for ministry and a heart for God.&nbsp; They all have this.&nbsp; It has the potential of ridding me of any effectiveness that I might have and of any changes God may want to do in my life.&nbsp; This is the summer. &nbsp;This is my future.&nbsp; This is the rest of my life.&nbsp; I will not let Satan take that away from me.&nbsp; It's going to take an act of God, though, just because I know my track record.&nbsp; I'm trusting He's in control.&nbsp; My job is to focus on Him.&nbsp; Otherwise all is lost.

      undated (Spring 2001)    Though we may feel defeated, as one who has lost the battle, as one who has fought the prince of despair unsuccessfully, let us not forget: our Risen Lord has won the war! Let us act as those who are victors because as Children of the King we are to partake in the conquering defeat of Satan, the biggest loser of all. Let us not walk with backs bent and heads hung, but with the confident stride of those who celebrate Easter daily. LEt us not speak and act in bitterness, anger, depression, or malice, for our Lord is coming and will have His vengeance. Let us instead speak and act in the love and grace Christ has extended to us, who have, too, committed sins punishable by death. Let us live with faith as our eyesight and grace as our feet, remembering each person we meet is a child of God, remembering our God has a plan for each of us, remembering that the battle we fight on a daily basis is not with humans of flesh and bone but for their souls and ours and is in spirit. And so let us come boldly unto the throne of grace to worship our victorious King, who not only sits on His regal throne, but also can be seen bent down, arms open wide, smile on His lips, laughter in His eyes, as we, His eternal children, run, toddling, to Him. Let us not walk as defeated, but as victorious, for our Lord has fought the only battle of importance. And He has won.

      Some days, I feel like when I can't (or won't) express myself, God does it for me.&nbsp; Like on the drive here, the torrential rains.&nbsp; I'm so angry and sad and upset and frustrated.&nbsp; Mostly angry after yesterday.&nbsp; I have to leave.&nbsp; I need to be gone.&nbsp; I can barely stand being in the same room as some of those people.&nbsp; In the words of the book I'm reading, there are only arrows and no romance.&nbsp; Basically, this place is killing all the good in me and all the bad parts of me are thriving.&nbsp; I hate who I'm becoming.&nbsp; I'm starting to doubt if I can even make it through July.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Rene might be coming back too.&nbsp; I had to control myself just when talking to Rebecca, her sister.&nbsp; I'm afraid to even see her - I might not be able to stop myself from expressing a few things. Like how she ruined any chance I ever had of effectively reaching the senior highers.&nbsp;   &nbsp;Man, I can't pray these days.&nbsp; Can't read my Bible.&nbsp; Can't manage to be more than "pleasant" (and not really very that) to some people.&nbsp;   So glad that Dana called today.&nbsp; I needed that.&nbsp; And Robin at Waukegan - seems like they really want me.&nbsp; And the church in Rochester Minnesota.&nbsp; Nothing seems "perfect" yet, but I haven't even decided what would be perfect to me.&nbsp; I want to be close to Al and all my friends and family, but those are six hours apart, so that doesn't work.&nbsp; So I don't know.&nbsp; I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.&nbsp;   I want to be "overcome by my love for Jesus" that I can do something extravagant, passionate, outrageous.&nbsp; Not even caring what others think.&nbsp; Completely abandoned to Jesus and Him alone.&nbsp; Eyes and heart set solely on Him.  &nbsp;  I know my journey isn't over, but I find myself wanting it to be

       So self-centered! I totally forgot that today is the day Dave and Carrie are going to see the other church. How insensitive! Jesus, be with them. Guide them. Give them Your strength to do this. I'm not gonna ask for them to stay, but I'm not asking them to go. Just wrap Your arms around them and give them peace, rest, calm assurance.

      God,   Thank You for providing for me. Thank You for answering my requests and concerns and thank You for the answers to the things I was afraid to speak. You knew my heart and take such good care of me. It means so much to me that Al is willing to have me move up there. And that Betsy offers her church and moving services. And Ray's help within the Covenant. And Jen's compassionate response. And Aunt Shirley's too. Thank You for surrounding me with friends and family in these trying times. I know that we're not close in body, but I know now that we are in spirit and heart. Thank You so much for that. It means more than I know.    And thank You for Susan coming up this weekend for SN:AG. I need that.     Here I was so upset earlier this week, not knowing what to do with my feelings and situation. You totally just took me through that process in Your time. You calmed my major fears and answered my deepest wonderings without me having to beg. I guess You knew I really couldn't handle it. The answers came so clearly this time. I know now that I'm in Your will, because I know why You brought me here - for Dave and Carrie. And I know its ok for me to leave - thank You for giving me an open door. Lots of open doors. I'm not really ready to close this one yet, but I'll do it when You tell me to - I know its right.     Thank You for showing me Your will. You know how I need that. I know I'm so selfish and all I think about is me - just look at "my plan." That is what I want for my life. I know in my head that more than that I want to do Your plan. Its gonna be hard on my heart giving up the parts of mine that don't fit.   I need Your robe

      God,  I don't want to leave, don't want to go back there. I'm not happy. Happiness isn't everything, but its something. If it were just my social or personal life, I would throw myself into my work, suppress, regress, deny, pretend. But I don't like my work. I'm not happy there either. I don't like:    Being far from family  Being far from friends  The size of the community  The size of the church  The church  My progress with my job  My lack of personal life  How unmotivated I am  How little hope I have  That I'm alone  My volunteers  JL  That when (if?) I leave, I'll feel like I've done more harm than good  That I'm even thinking about leaving  That I have to think about leaving  Not seeing Sarah for years  Not knowing where I'll be in six months  Financial situation (including car)  Always being tired  An ungrowing ministry  Cold, hard people.   What do I like? Not much.   Getting to preach occasionally  Having freedom (some) within my job  RM 2001 prospects and change  Rochelle, Danielle, Brian  Pastor Dave and Carrie  The Rosatis  The Myers  Being on my own  Dallas and Montgomery  Being the one who "went off and did it"  Being in youth ministry  Being (I think?) in God's will  Hope (but its quickly dwindling)   I know You never promised happiness. You never said I wouldn't be miserable. Somehow, I didn't think….     I'm not depressed. That's something. I don't want to go back. Tonight was the second time I've cried this trip. I really don't want to leave. I don't know if I can. I have to.     My way? I'd stay through Thursday. Take B to a jazz club for his birthday. Go back well rested. Maybe see Sarah again before leaving. Get home and send out resumes. Immediate positive responses and offers and I feel God's leading to go. And I'm gone. And I don't even care about what I'm leaving behind. I get an awesome job where I can be debt-free fast and buy or lease a new truck. I get an apartment that lets me have two cats and a dog (and maybe some fish). Fireworks, now "Moose," becomes mine. B decides to go to seminary near me and that he's ready for a relationship, with me. I make new friends and keep close with my current ones. Mom is nurturing. Dad is a Christian. I don't worry about Al. B and I get married, stay or move close to Al or other family. We have dozens of babies (ok, five). We're a close, healthy family, and we're close to our extended fam. Kids grow up and go to college and are successful and get married and have babies.&nbsp;B and I are the gray-haired couple walking down the street holding hands still. We have a fiftieth wedding anniversary. After that, who knows.     I know that's my way and I often don't get my way. I could give up all of my dreams and be happy - as long as I know I'm in God's will. I don't even know anymore. How do I keep going, put up with the mundane and all the crap, do the day to day, if I don't even know His will? How do I stand if I don't know which rock I should be on?

       I have all these emotions that I can talk about rationally, but I don't feel them anymore.&nbsp; I want to feel them, but something's in the way.&nbsp; I don't know if its my unwillingness to be vulnerable, or a defense system protecting me because of the past, or the depression.&nbsp; The strongest emotion I have is the overwhelming... fear, concern, worry, whatever... about my finances.&nbsp; The last time I felt anything was last weekend at Homecoming.&nbsp; I feel nothing at church.&nbsp; I feel nothing at home.&nbsp; On the phone.&nbsp; EVen while visiting Al, although I was in interviewing mode, and I was noticeably relieved and relaxed.&nbsp; I did enjoy the fall colors on the dirt roads yesterday and today.&nbsp; ANd I smiled a couple of times tonight while working on my scrapbook.&nbsp; ACtually got teary-eyed when reading old love letters from Michael.&nbsp; BUt on a consistent basis, I'd like to ... feel again.&nbsp;

      I’m sitting at the same park as before, when it rained so hard.  The sun is out today and it’s hot – beautiful enough that this Sunday afternoon the parking lot is full of families enjoying what could be the last afternoon of summer.  School started last week.  Teenage boys with fishing poles in hand, children laughing on the playground.  A small sailboat crosses the even smaller pond.  A couple walks their dog.  The nearby highway barely intrudes on the picture-perfect afternoon.  Sun reflects off the rippling lake like a million sequins, or diamonds.  Sitting alone in the shade of a large acorn tree on my blanket, I do not feel alone, for I am surrounded by life and, strangely, involved in it, too, as part of the scene.  No one bothers me and, for the moment, all I worry about is if someone will steal my unlocked car.  It’s so hot that it too deserves to partake in the summer, breathe its air and absorb one last piece of it.  Acorns keep falling from above.  A daddy-long-legs spider tries to cross my blanket but I shoo him away.  In this moment I do not even wish for another to share it with – perhaps some but spray (I’ve killed several mosquitoes already), but nothing else.  The insects of summer all cry out their last calls.  There was a party here earlier – remnants of it remain, but do not taint this place, only add to its charm.  It’s humid, but not stifling so.  The sailboat is stuck in the shallow rocks near the shore – its crew struggles and breaks free, heading out again towards the center where the waters are cool and deep and full of mystery.            What is at your center, where you are deepest?  If I did more than wade in your banks, if I dared to swim out to the mysterious parts, what would I find there?  Have others dared to go there?  Have you let them?  The shore is beautiful – clean sand and smooth rocks, lined with leafy trees that whisper gently in the wind but do not bend.  Small waves gently beat upon the shore, hinting of what may be out there, in the deep parts, where your heart lives and soul resides.             What if I were to row out, and in a moment of bravado, jump ship in one smooth and calm movement?  I’d dive down as far as I could go in one breath, eyes open to see through the clear waters, before returning to the surface, gasping for air.  It is cool and refreshing and my whole body is aware of my surroundings.  Taking a deep breath, I again go beneath the surface, exploring the mysteries that are beneath appearances.  It is much of what I expected, and much not.  There is no resistance to my being here – you have been wanting and wish and hoping against reason for this.  It is scary, makes us both uneasy – I can feel the waters chuckle nervously around me.  I swim tentatively, slowly, enjoying each new discovery, and you know you are safe.  There are places that are beautiful, full of life and creatures and sights and stories.  I marvel in it all.  And there are dark and cold places, where remnants of others are, bones and shells of long-dead creatures, tears and hurt and pain.  I proceed cautiously but do not turn away, for these places are part of you and so they are beautiful too.  Exploring further, I reach a current of fresh water.  I follow it to the source and find the most beautiful and amazing place of all, your soul.  Here I can see your true beauty, knowing all your stories and how they’ve shaped you, understanding the dark places, feeling what you’ve felt, knowing your character and the person you are.  It is at once too much and not enough.  In this place I feel my love for you confirmed and overwhelming, spilling out of me, becoming part of you.            Swimming towards the surface again, I take the air in not in gasps or gulps but sighs, as if it is no longer what I need to survive.  My rowboat has drifted and a bird is perched on the edge.  I see my meal sitting on one end, and realize it would no longer be satisfying.  I want to stay here, in the calm and deep, floating on my back looking up at the sun, swimming and kicking to make waves, and exploring more of you.  The shore is no longer desirable, and wading will not quench my longings.  Even to row out every day and spend all my waking hours here would not be enough.  I want to, I need to, be here always.            My vision jumps into focus and I see I am standing, toes in the sand, looking out over the lake.  There is a choice to be made, and I waver.  It’s been a long time since I last went swimming – what if I forget and drown?  The water brushing over my feet feels cold, maybe too cold.  It’s not a swimming lake and the others would look at me strangely if… but my heart cries out for the journey, the adventure, the mysterious.  So quickly, before losing nerve, I shed my clothes and dive in.

      Things I dream about but dare not hope for: -         Passionate love affairs -         Deeply intimate relationships -         First kisses -         The electricity of a touch -         Declarations of love -         The knight who pursues  How… blissful, and absolutely terrifying!  I watch on TV when a couple has their first kiss, and I think, it’s so slow!  I could never handle the uncertainty for that many moments before it happens, when faces are close and hearts are wildly beating and eyes dart about shouting out their questions.            I much rather prefer the comfort of sitting on a couch snuggled close enough to feel each other’s breathes and watching a movie.  My head longs for those moments, when everything is “warm and fuzzy.”  But my heart cries out for the other stuff.  All that is within me protests against its cries.  The uncertainty, unknown, tension, uncontrollable torrent of emotions, these are not what I desire.  And so I live my life without them.  I’ve set up rules and guidelines and a situation for myself that is safe.  I still allow my heart to dream, but stifle its longings and silence its pleas for more.  And I wonder why I’m unhappy.  If only I could get past… myself… to the passionate life my heart was meant to live.  How do I get there?  Where does one begin to pursue such a journey (path?)?            The most obvious way in my mind is to begin a romantic relationship.  Alas, those are not easily come by.  And my heart, too, protests the casual fling, disallowing me to participate in such activities, or at least not engaging itself in them and leaving me… lacking what I need to engage myself and making the experience a failure.  And so even more hopelessly than casual flings, serious romantic relationships are even harder to find.  This leaves me without answers.  How else does one do more than appease the yearnings of the heart?            There must be a way.  There must be more than this.

      I went for a walk today.  It rained – poured, actually, a glorious feeling.  It’s still raining, and the thunder is so loud it causes me to jump.  The lightning illuminates the whole sky.  I am soaked to the core, my hair dripping.  Not ready to go inside yet, I’m sitting under a pavilion at the park.  I’m starting to get cold – should have thought ahead to bring a dry sweater or something.  A stray raindrop runs across the bridge of my nose and down my lips – it tastes clear and fresh, unpolluted.  The wind, though cold, awakens every part of my body and reminds me that I am alive.            The week was spent indoors.  In my depression (due to lack of job and money and housing at the end of the month, and no time spent with Jesus), I stayed in my apartment, slept a lot, and went on the occasional job interview.  I ignored my roommates.  I haven’t been to a store in what feels like forever.  I’ve done a lot of writing, but not a lot of interacting with people.  Not surprisingly, I don’t miss people that much.  The outdoors – the wildness, freedom, the pieces of nature that beckon to be explored – these I miss.            I’m wrapped in my blanket now, the one from the trunk of my car, and it keeps me slightly warmer.  I’ve decided I must stay at least until I finish my latte.  Vanilla today.  I really wanted a mocha, but didn’t have the money.            Had a long-overdue conversation with Jesus today.  We talked about my situation, how I’ve messed up everything, how I’m super-stressed about finances and jobs and places to live, and I really need to trust Him.  We talked about my friends and family, things I think I need and things I want, ways I want to change.            I can’t see the path in front of me – things were so clear six months ago, weren’t they?     If You Want Me To by Ginny Owens     The pathway is broken The signs are unclear I can't find the reason why You led me here But just because You love me the way that You do I will go through the valley If You want me to   Now I'm not who I was When I took my first step And I'm clinging to the promise You're not through with me yet And if all of these trials can make me like You I will go through the fire If You want me to   It may not be the way I would have chosen 'Cause it leads me through a world that's not my home But You never said it would be easy Only that I'll never go alone    When the whole world turns against me And I'm all by myself And I can't hear You answer my cries for help I'll remember the suffering Your love put You through And I will go through the valley If You want me to             I don’t know what I want anymore (does it matter, really?).  Urban ministry?  The church?  Missionary?  Single?  Married?  Kids?  Worldly standards of success?  I don’t feel strong enough right now to be a maverick, but everything within me rebels against being “standard,” “status quo,” “normal.”  I am a dichotomy and I confuse even me most of the time.            The rain is letting up a bit.  Another huge crack of lightning, making me jump again.  I am safe and protected here.  The raindrops were huge and round earlier, rolling down my arms and neck and forehead.  I’m barefoot now – my socks were soaked anyways, and the wet grass felt good under my feat.  It was a nice walk, through the woods, around the lake, even over a bridge.  And I didn’t see another soul while out, probably on account of the rain.  How can I describe Boy S?  He’s… wonderful.  Compassionate and funny, shy yet brutally honest.  He has a good heart, even if he doesn’t share his feelings well.  Kind.  He makes me feel safe.  I love the twinkle in his eyes that he gets (or gives) when the situation is just right.  He’s super laid-back, loves the outdoors, and loves people though he’d never admit it.  He’s the youngest of four, which my mom says is a lot better than Boy P, who was the oldest.  My mom said she could see how Boy P was my type, how he would have been a good match for me.  And Boy S is a lot like Boy P, but different in some key ways as well.  And the way I feel for Boy S is very different from how I felt about Boy P (past tense for sure finally).  It’s not this overwhelming slosh of emotions that renders me stupid and out of control.  I didn’t jump in feet first and drown this time.  I don’t feel like I’d go overboard.  And I’ve already spent more time with Boy S in three months than in four years with Boy P.            With Boy P, I always felt sure that he was “the one.”  I’ve felt that way about other guys too – Boy J, Boy L, Boy K, Boy M, Boy O, to name a few.  I like the not-knowing, the uncertainty, the yet-to-be-explored.  I like that my heart is unsure (especially since we are, after all, just friends and there’s no reason to think he feels anything towards me but friendship).  It’s starting to get colder.  I should finish my latte so I can go home.  I had such high hopes to read and write.  Oh well.  The weekend’s almost here.

      Had coffee with Boy S on Sunday.  It was good in a lot of ways.  For two hours we had a good conversation where he actually asked questions and made his own conversation without me asking all the questions.  That was really nice.  It didn't seem to "click" though.  Like, if it had been a blind date, I probably wouldn't go on a secon done.  He gaimed some weight too, at least in his face (which I suppose comes just from not working 18 hour days and eating better food).  I wasn't really feeling the chemistry though.  It did feel like we were on e4qual ground, which has been a concern of mine.  He's so tall, the goodbye hug was awkward.  He might have invited me to a concert (how can I not be sure?  It was more like an announcement that "downhere" was going to be at C than an invite to come,b ut that seems like his style.  I had to invite myself, more or less.)  So many dilemmas come out of this.  I don't really want to be the one doing all the work in this relationship.  I emailed, I called, I even drove the furthest.  That's what I had with Boy P and why it eventually ended for me.  There's also the issue of personal convictions.  If I don't believe that women should pursue men and if I don't really believe in dating (all of which is true), then what am I doing?  Do I betray my convictions, as so many of my friends have done and I've been so critical of their hypocrisy?  Or do I lose the relationship completely, because if I don't pursue it, it might just fade away?  And while he's my ideal in many ways (so many more than any guy I've ever known), he's not doing it for me, I'm not feeling the attraction.  Boy P was ideal too and I felt the chemistry, but I ended it (whatever it was) because I was doing all the work.  Without looking at the whole God aspect adn treating this just as a personal issue, what is the healthy thing to do?  It feels wrong to betray my convictions (duh, but seriously, it doesn't feel right in any sense, I get this pit at the bottom of my stomach when I think about it) even though everybody else seems to be pushing me in that direction.  There's also the part of me that's not content to drop the friendship.  I've been ok doing that with others (Boy P, Boy M, Boy V to name a few).  I feel like if I dropped him, years later I would regret it and look back with a sense of longing.  I could wait for the God-perspective.  Sometimes that clears these issues up immediately.  But I'd like to be able to make healthy relationship decisions fo rmyself without that piece.  Does that make sense or is it a betrayal of my faith and relationship with God?  Is that denying my dependence on Him, am I acting self-reliant?  As much as my relationship with Him has been non-existent since I got back from Arizona, He has been at work in my life and through me.  I've had more conversations about faith issues than ever before.  I've seen a huge change in A.  I know, on the flipside, that my ministry at church could be hugely more effective if I talked with God.  Isn't it clear I have no answers?  I just ask questions, pose both side of the argument, and wait.  Silence.  No reason within myself, no solid direction from outside myself.

      I feel as though i am all black, and am surrounded by darkness.  There are faint lights in the distance, all different colors, but they do not glow warmly - they are enticing in the sin they represent.  But I wish for complete darkness.  I cannot shut otu their dirty light, nor can I make the pure light come.  I cannot command it to rain down from the heavens, cannot demand its presence.  I stumble, alone, without direction.  There is not even a hint of what to do, how to act, what may change my circumstance.  Only the beckoning of the lights.

      So I should be talking with my kids righ tnow.  They're right outside my door.  I don't have the self-control to choose them over me.  Is that wrong?  Bad?  Should I not be doign this job at all?  This church doesn't feel like home.  Is that me or them?  My last church did.  The one before that did too.  Am I just really screwed up?  I've been waiting (although technically I should have been praying and reading my Bible and pursuing the answer) for something clear from god on future direction, something like my original calling.  The other day I just caem to the realization that I don't like working for churches.  At all.  Don't want to do it again.  Is that my sign?  That was a me thing.  I was kinda hoping for a God thing.  And I'm so frustrated with Presbyterians in general.  We can't do the cool activity next week with communion because session has to approve things like that.  Well poop.  It made me cry.  And it was like B didn't even hear what I'd said - she suggested we could do it another time AFTER session emets again and she didn't get that it went with the specific lesson for next week.  She didn't want to meet - was on the phone my first 45 minutes here.  Didn't get to tell her the shitty week I had.  I'm so overwhelmed with crappy emotions right now.  How can I do this?    THIS  .  Junior high youth group.  Dinner.  Lent service (gag).  Senior high youth group.  Drive home.  Cope with roommates.  Try to sleep.  Start over.

      Well, the doctor's stuff turned out... ok.  I'm trying to be positive (well, I don't really have to try that hard - maybe I just haven't really thought about it that seriously).  It's not terminal or fatal, and it won't really affect my day to day life very much at all.  I have  urlLink Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome   (PCOS).  It could be worse.  I could be dying.  I could have to have surgery.  As it is, all I have to do is take a pill every day.  That's not that bad.  I think I freaked the doctor out a little bit, because I didn't have any questions and I didn't seem too worried.  It's just that, well, I've always thought that I would adopt my kids and that I wouldn't be able to give birth to them, and I've always wanted boy children (who are just carriers of this genetic disease).  My mom said she always thought she would adopt too, but she didn't.   I've got my  urlLink Music from the Coffee Lands  cd in - they're singing in Spanish.  This is what it sounds like to me: el mismo cabon la forsfa /  mumuman' /  el muna foralan porlna /  el pornas le preguntas /  soy entraboynadertandato /  estas la minongas cha cha cha /   I don't think that's what they're saying.  Still, it's a good cd.  I just don't think I'm ever going to get Spanish.  That could be a big hindrance to moving to Panama.

      Egad!  Another boring day.  P gave me a task, a small brochure to prepare, but it was done within an hour, and now I'm back to nothingness.  J came in with someone else and asked me to print something for them - specifically a 758 page document, and then make a photocopy of it so there were two copies, one for each of them.  Somewhere, trees died and the earth cried a great wail at the ... waste.  Last night the kids were... memorable.  Junior high resulted in a conversation that was meant to get their input on summer youth group but ended up just being 1) a criticism of how things are done now [i.e. boring and we need more games, always more games, and food too] and 2) a list of activities they want to do [i.e. ValleyFair and the zoo and overnights and lockins and retreats and the list goes on but my free time does not and when do they expect these things to happen and  what in the world do they have to do with Jesus ?]  The senior high were slightly unhinged, as usual, but playing outside tu burn off steam only made it worse and their comments to each other were out of line and voluminous.  So we came inside and made everyone go around and give one compliment to each person.  It ended up really good and taking way more time than we had, but a practical lesson on what the early church was like, instead of the lesson I had planned, which was more studious.  And on a personal note, it was nice to hear how others see me in a positive light and, especially from the kids, the good things that they like.  K and I went out for a drink afterwards - we'd been planning on doing that for, months, and could never get the date right.  Quite enjoyable, although the Wild were playing (or should I say losing) and the tvs were turned up way too loud and our waitress was frustrated with us because we only ordered one drink apiece (hello, I'd like to actually be able to drive my car home).  But conversation was enjoyable.  And I had all these good thoughts last night and now they're gone again.  Driving in my car I always get good stuff to write, songs, essays, whatever, but they always leave my head the moment I get out of the car.  Maybe I should move into my car.  Or not.

      What a boring day today.  Yesterday too.  I've had no work.  And today I was supposed to have a 10:30 meeting that would have produced work for me to do, but, alas, one of the members stepped out for another meeting and hasn't returned.  An hour and a half later, still not here.  So I've been doing other stuff, like producing brochures for church, and reading the news in Panama.  Got my application off, finally completed at 5:00 yesterday.  Rainy today - all grey and stuff.  But I finally got paid from the piano lessons, so my bank account no longer has a negative balance.  That's good.  I am desperately in need of something to do (something that isn't filing - I have some of that to do).

      I straightened my hair last night.  Not because I really wanted it straight, but simply because I didn't want to have to wash it the rest of the week.  For anyone reading this who has curly hair, perhaps you share this with me - my scalp hurts today.  It hurts every day that I have straight hair.  I don't know why, but it does.  It doesn't hurt at all why I leave my hair natural, or if I curl it with a curling iron, or if I hide it under a hat.  It's just the straight that hurts.  How can that be?  I don't do anything to my scalp, it's just the dead hair that is attached to it that I've temporarily altered.  It makes no sense.  My Panama application is due today.  Yesterday I finished questions 1-16 (numbers one through 11 were of the "what is your name?" nature).  There are a total of 35 questions.  I'm never going to get it finished.  And my videotape won't be there in time, either, since it's not edited at all and I have no money with which to mail it off until Friday.  Hopefully they'll understand.  I really think the timing of it all is, well, wrong, but everything else about it seems good.  Who knows.  I'll just wait and do what I can.  If I don't apply, I know I'll regret it.    Doctor's appointment got bumped to Friday.  The agony!  The anxiety!  I am so impatient.

      Update about our trip to the Birchwood Cafe.  It was gross.  Icky.  Even desert (Chocolate Mousse pie and Key Lime pie).  No sugar in our coffee or pie whatsoever.  And dinner was... interesting.  Full of ingredients I'm sure I'll never eat again and never have.  L liked it though; she finished some of my food.  Good for her.  There just weren't enough options so I had to choose something I was less than thrilled about in the first place.  Bad sign.  Oh well.  They want to go out for Ethiopian.  But I'm broke.  Until payday.    Next   Friday.  That was poor planning.

      I no longer want to harm any of my roommates.  Or their relatives or friends who call.  Because, well, quite frankly, there are more important things in this world, and I'm tired.  My labs came back - the nurse called and so I had to return the call when I got home from work yesterday.  I spent easily five minutes being transferred around until they found the right nurse and then waited for her to come on the phone.  She said my labs and coem back and they were, quote, WEIRD.  Thanks so much for clearing that up.  What does it mean?  Oh, no need to get freaked out, we're just going to send you to a specialist and let me transfer you to the receptionist right now to set that up.  Great.  Thanks so much for making it easy.  But wait.  That's right.  My appointment is in a week and I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY TEST RESULTS ACTUALLY WERE.  Am I dying?  I everything ok?  (Obviously not)  Am I broken?  More importantly, am I fixable?  Who is this yahoo that they're sending me to?  I went to the HealthPartners' website to look him up and his bio said that he reads medical journals and likes to inform his patients of new things that are going on in the field.  Yippee.  I'm glad my doctor can  read  and might actually try to help me.  That is not the kind of information I was looking for.  His picture came up as a big box with a little red X in it.  Thanks.  So now I have to wait a week to see a doctor about whom I know nothing other than that he's literate and I know nothing about why I'm even going there, other than my labs came back WEIRD.  Pardon me if I'm a little high-strung about this.  I am glad that I am a permanent employee now and don't have to worry about healthcare costs for at least a while.  That's the   only   bright spot right now.  And I have to call my mom (with whom I've been struggling to actually communicate with due to the fact that all I do lately is listen) tonight and try to get a word in edgewise and tell her what's going on (or at least the fact that something is going on but nobody knows what yet. Well, the nurse does.  So does the doctor probably.  But not me.  The important one.  Envision the world revolving around  me  right now.).

      So now I feel bad about being mean to the person on the phone yesterday.  Somebody really was dead.  A housemate's stepmom.  Long-term terminal, but still.

      Can we talk about what should happen to people who call at 4:30 in the morning?  This sort of thing should be outlawed.  Three times, mind you, the phone rang.  I had just gotten to sleep, after being lazy yesterday, skipping work, and sleeping in until noon.  So logically I couldn't fall asleep last night (thereby ruining all benefits of the previous day's sleep and time off).  Finally around 4:15 I drifted off into blissful sleep, only to be woken up by the phone ringing!  First they left a message.  So I fell right back to sleep.  But then, ten minutes later, they called back again.  Let the answering machine pick it up, but no, they hung up and CALLED RIGHT BACK!!!  So I answered with a "What?!?" as rudely as possible, only to have it be a sibling of a roommate who was looking for them.  Like I cared.  All I have to say is, there better be somebody in the hospital or some similar sort of emergency that would warrant three 4:30 phone calls.

      ARGH!!!  What a long day.  Spent the better half the afternoon surfing the web (nothing at work to do) and exploring all the blog possibilities and setting up some new blogs, trying to find a space that I could throw some pdfs out there to link up and share (no luck).  But then I had some work to do, updating some web links.  Only I lost all brain function completely and ended up doing half of them wrong, only to figure it out later and have to re-do them.  I hate that.  Talked to L.  A's out of town this weekend, so we might go to the  urlLink Birchwood Cafe .  We have plans to go to the May Day parade on Sunday, and have a little band practice too.  I have mega cleaning and laundry to do this weekend too, as well as it's my first weekend off without major working to be done, so sleep is in order.  Maybe I'll skip off work early.  (maybe?  of course I will)

       urlLink  This is how my morning started.  Alarm clock.  6 am.  Snooze button.  7 am.  Now there's a cat who wants to be pet and she curls up with me, moves quickly thereafter to nap on my foot.  Get up, shower, get ready, leave house.  While walking to the bus I realize that I've forgotten the all-important sheet from the doctor with the lab tests to be run.  So I walk back (making me miss the 8:10 bus that I was going to be so proud I got on, since I usually get the 9:01), grab the sheet, and start out again.  It's beautiful outside, the sun is shining, I'm wearing my sunglasses (and an outfit that I think is pretty darn cute), life is good.  I make the 8:20 with mucho time to spare.  I start reading a new book, Just Jesus, but all I really got read was the foreward and a few pages.  Then I walk from the bus to the clinic across the Wabasha bridge (not wearing sunglasses, it's so beautiful out, who wants to add some grey for the sake of avoiding crows feet later?).  It's a long walk (ok, 15 minutes).  The lab gets me right in and out (well, all they had to do was draw blood, so how hard was that?).  Walk back across the bridge. Take the Kellogg street path through the riverside park at Cedar and Minnesota.  Smell the lilac trees (or whatever they are, they smelled beautiful and remind me of my childhood - our neighbors always had the purple ones hanging over their fence into our backyard, and then on the walk to school somebody else had the white and red ones that hung over the sidewalk.  Maybe those were two different types of trees.  Who cares?  They smell like spring and childhood and innocence and a time long gone.) which just refreshed me and put me in a good mood.  Stopped for coffee and a muffin before going into work (update: two hours later, coffee gone, muffin untouched).  A great way to start, right?  My boss is even gone today, taking a vacation day.  Yippie.  Not that he's a bad man or that I dislike him.  He actually gave me high praise this week and did my performance review and was very gracious and I got a raise and put on permanent status.  But it's still more fun without him here.  But the work I have to do today?  I just spent an hour and a half basically saving a file to multiple locations on the web.  Different versions of the file.  Like 50 different versions.  BORING.  That's what I did yesterday too.  Oh, it's not like the days that I spent going through the meeting minutes looking for double spaces instead of single spaces between words because they leave funny characters when published to the web.  But just mind-numbingly boring.  Way to kill all the life that I experienced already today.  I read  urlLink Lileks  blog today (spent a lot of time reading my new discovery yesterday too).  Dilbert not funny.  Of course, all this time that my brain has not had to work on work has kept it busy thinking about yesterday and how frustrated I was at A & L.  Kept me up late last night being frustrated about it.  I'll have to get more about that later.

      So... turning 25 wasn't nearly as horrible as I thought it would be.  It was kinda a bummer of a day.  Got the last of the cavities filled (I think I can now apply for a permit to be a radio tower).  Had to take notes at some meeting which was just... blah.  And met my new counselor, who is very nice.  It was just... like its totally scary (I was shaking while filling out the forms for why, I don't know) and hard because I had to answer questions that I didn't really want to, but wonderful because there was a commonality and a sense that things can get better.  And Daddy called and I talked to him for a while and that was good.  Mommy called a couple of times too (though never when I was home).  Al called while I was at work and a bunch of people emailed and I got a bunch of cards on Monday.  Not traumatic at all.  And A & I watched "The Princess Bride" on tv which was just fantabulous.  Got the interview tonight.  Not nervous.  Feeling actually more prepared than I thought I would be.  But that's because had the SRC meeting today so I had plenty of time to use my brain to think about other things, like questions I should ask, what I want to communicate, etc.  There's a lot to do tonight besides that, too, because I've got youth group to plan.  And I'm starving and need to eat.  Almost time to go home!

      My sister called our dad the other day, because she hadn't talked to him in like 2 months and we're going to see him this weekend, and with it being Father's Day and then his birthday at the end of the month, we figured we should get a gift.  They talked for 17 minutes, and it was her talking for the whole time.  This is why I haven't called in 6 weeks.  What do I have to talk about, that's worth saying to someone who's not really talking back?  I did find a new chiropractor that I can walk to from work, and Monday night I scheduled an appointment to see a counselor, and now I have to cancel it because as I was looking for a new one (the one they were sending me to wasn't at a convenient location), I found that my insurance contracts Lutheran Social Services, which means I can get faith-based counseling.  I'm so excited.  I called this morning and made an appointment.  It's on my birthday, but the counselor that I'm with has late hours; my appointment is at 5:45 and I could have gotten an appointment as late as 8p!  That's exciting too.  I didn't really need to spend more of my virtually non-existent sick hours on that.  Same with the chiropractor.  Now as soon as I get all these cavities filled, I'll be in tip-top shape (5 down, 4 to go!)

      Finally told A & L about the Panama job.  They were pretty good, but it did get blown over a little, just because, well, we're all in the same boat.  We went out for drinks last night (ending with A deciding no more margueritas on weekday nights, but L & I got strawberry daiquiris with virtually no alcohol but they sure cost enough).  A had had an interview on Friday and then she left for the weekend and we all hadn't really talked about that, plus she had some new career thoughts.  L is still undecided, even about whether to stay in MN or move back home, although the PeaceCorps is now looking like more of an option for her.  So, my little thing wasn't really that big of a deal, since we're all freaking out about what the next step is.  It's terrible, I have to say, but I absolutely CANNOT STAND the new staff person at church.  It's probably entirely wrong of me, but she just rubs me the wrong way every time I talk to her.  She used to have my job, and then she went to seminary, and now she's back but with a different (translated: children not youth, 3/4 time instead of 1/4 time) job.  I never knew her when she was here before because, well, I was living in a whole other state and didn't even know the church existed.  She talked to me on Sunday and was so... condescending.  I hate that.  She was all, I'll help you in any way I can and I'd love to be a point person to help you problem solve and of course you don't know anything about how to do what you're doing and I know how to do everything so just lean on me but I won't actually do your stuff because I have boundaries and aren't I just so wonderful?  Please.  I wanted to scream, jump out of my skin, and then calmly explain to her that I've been doing this for EIGHT years and thank you kindly but I don't need your help would you please leave me alone.  But, of course, this is church, and so I just smiled and nodded and pretended to be elsewhere.  And she called me today at work and... just even the sound of her voice grates on me.  I just want her to go away.  Its been a while since I've disliked someone this much at church.  Back in MI there were several people....  but that's an entirely different story and situation.  This makes me want to leave, even more.  I know that I may look like I'm 12 and so perhaps have just graduated from high school and don't know what I'm doing, but she didn't even ask.  She just assumed that I'd never been a yp before and would need her help.  Thank you, but I got along fine for the nine months before you showed up, I think I'll survive.

      Well, I didn't get the Panama job.  I'm really disappointed.  More so than I thought I'd be.  Realistically, I know that if they didn't want me (especially this early in the game), I don't want to be there.  It was such a... dream, though.  This weekend L asked me about that job plus the one in Bloomington that I've got an interview for later this month (have I mentioned that one yet?) and I told her that I liked the Panama one better, especially when I think about the path that each one leads me on.  The Bloomington one is a normal suburban church yp job - there's part of me that hugely protests "what I'll become," what the end result is, when I travel that path.  The Panama one, I didn't know what the end result was, but it didn't feel... like that.  Dammit.  I really wanted that job.  And I can tell... it's coming.  I am going to be depressed.  I got a stress headache, not 15 minutes after finding out.  But... I'm feeling dark already.  I'm going to schedule an appointment with a counselor (like the doctor wanted me to back in March) so I can get put on meds.  I was waiting, truly, to find out about Panama, because they want to put you on meds for a minimum of 6 months, and if I was leaving at the end of August, why bother.  But now, well, why not.  It's upsetting because it means that I don't have any way out of my current situation for a while.  That's not true entirely, but I have no  acceptable  ways out.  So I'll be working for the State and doing the part-time thing at church and... there's a big part of me that screams UNACCEPTABLE to that too.  I'm really just not content with my current situation, the status quo.  I hear that's all that being 20-something is about, but I'm not buying it.  And just because there are hundreds of thousands of other unhappy people out there doesn't mean I have to be one too.

      I've been reading  urlLink The Poisonwood Bible  by  urlLink Barbara Kingsolver  at A's recommendation (warning, I might give away key factoids and plot-spoilers).  I'm still not all the way finished with it and it's been two weeks of reading it on the bus and staying up late.  But it's really good.  And really difficult at the same time.  It's about a missionary family in the Congo starting in 1959.  When I say difficult, I mean that the father is a southern baptist evangelist who decides to take his family to the Congo and his definition of his purpose there is to baptize everybody while totally ignoring all of their culture and way of life.  He doesn't even get to know people individually, just yells a lot about sin and repentance and damnation and baptism.  It's hard to take the, well, brutal honesty of the description of his mission - I know that for a long time many people treated missions like this, and sometimes I'd just rather forget about that.  This morning as I was reading it, I was overwhelmed with the desire to hop into the book (or a boat across the ocean) and just go and hug people and sooth their pains and make everything all better.  I'm not so much pulled to do the evangelism talking-about-God thing (although that could just be a result of my not having really talked to Him in quite some time, and also sometimes that just happens, I just get into conversations about Him without realizing it).  I just get overwhelmed sometimes with grand dreams of compassion.  Maybe... I don't know.  Like I have any clue about anything.

      So, some background before I go into this... A & I got this book in the winter called  urlLink Buy Book, Get Guy .  And while it wasn't a revolutionary book at all, nor did either of us get a guy aftewards (we weren't expecting miracles), it was a decent read for the used book price I got it for.  There was this one vital piece of information that we have since discussed at length over the past... 9 months.  It's this simple idea of making eye contact and smiling.  At a guy.  At the same time.  I seem... incapable of doing it.  I can make eye contact.  Or I can smile.  But not both at the same time.  So, I can either be Strange Girl Who Stares, or Weird Girl Smiling To Herself.  But I cannot be Cute Girl Interested In Hot Boy.  This, I seen to be incapable of.  But, today, I did it!  Maybe its the new drugs I'm on, 'cause I am feeling pretty good today.  I'm walking to the bus stop (btw, caught the 8:46, could have caught the 8:35 but I thought it was the 8:31 so I didn't rush, very proud of myself for getting up at 7:30 today; also have gone running 3 times this week!  Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday!  My therapist will be so proud of me!) and I walk past this park/playground, and there was this cute boy on one of those big industrial lawn mowers, and he was coming down the sidewalk towards me, so I hopped into the street, not desiring to become lawnmower food.  He smiled at me as I passed, and I kinda looked, then looked away and smiled.  But later, while I was waiting at the bus stop, he came driving down the street on his lawnmower, and as he passed me, he smiled and I looked at him and smiled.  And as he continued down the road away from me, he kept looking back (arguably to remove the tree branch attached to the back of his lawnmower), I kept glancing at him and smiling.  It was a lot of fun for me.  So, yay me!  Progress in my life!

      Trying to not be freaked out, but, let's be honest, I am.  I had another appointment with my therapist, and we talked about getting put on meds, and he really seems to want me on them sooner rather than later.  So I did the responsible thing today and called my gp to schedule an appointment.  I just assumed, I guess, that I wouldn't be able to get an appointment in the 24 hours until I leave for the big Chicago trip.  But there were, like, 3 appointments all in the afternoon when I'm not at work.  So I have an appointment at 2:20.  A little freaked out now.  I shouldn't be, right?  I mean, I've been thinking about this for a long time.  There've been times when I've felt like this was the only option, that I'd exhausted all the rest of my resources.  So what's the big deal?  But yeah, it's a big deal.  Mucho thanks to my friends who have been great help giving suggestions on how to further get to know Mr Wonderful from the other weekend.  The consensus was that I could email him as a sort of thanks and let him take it from there.  Avoid stalking (note - do NOT show up on Sunday morning at his church, even though he told you which one it was) at all costs!  I walk a fine line.

      Well, where to begin?  So much....  First of all, met a most wonderful guy on Saturday.  Unfortunately, I was working for church and so it was really inappropriate to pursue anything.  I learned an awful lot about him through some conversations (sufficient information to do some internet stalking for a while, learn his last name, etc), enough to know that I'd really like to get to know him better.  But, alas, no current method to do so.  Sent email to friends asking for advice.  We'll see.  He really was just... yummy.  Gorgeous and muscle-y and lead a great devotional on urban ministry and, yeah, other than him being 5 years younger than me (and that makes him pretty young)....  Camping was good, although there were some times when A & L & myself almost killed each other.  But we survived, as will our friendships.  A is gone now for the long weekend and won't be back until Sunday - more sucky family stuff going on for her, I feel bad that she's gotta spend a bunch of time with them.  The falls at Gooseberry were awesome, and we walked across them and in them and around them and took tons of pics that I'll try to post somewhere soon when I get them developed.  Saw Split Rock Lighthouse from a distance, and that was beautiful too.  Spent a little bit of time in Duluth, which was much better than I ever thought it was (used to make fun of it, having never been there, calling it dull-uth).  Will definately have to go back on my own or with B or someone who can do some good window shopping / browsing.  A & myself decided to move and get an apartment together, so now begins the great search.  Had a nice long talk with my dad and C last night (it was his birthday on Monday).  She's gotten into some strange new-age (although actually ancient asian practice) healing tai-chi like thing, and is hopeful that it will cure the cancer.  What does one say to that?  My sister is mad at me and has done some stupid things so that I'm real frustrated with her as well.  I know she's busy planning a wedding (2 and a half weeks) and painting their entire house, but the rest of us have lives too.  I called up one of her bridesmaids to plan the bachelorette party and she talked with my sis and they picked the day after I leave for Chicago on the mission trip, a trip I've had planned for months and she's known about for months.  So they're going to have it without me.  That's just rude.  And she was ticked with me on Saturday night, presumably because she had to leave her house in the middle of painting for a ten minute drive to Elk River (a 35 minute drive for us) to meet us and drop off the tent, which she was supposed to have dropped off any time during the week (only a 10 minute drive from where she works).  NOT MY FAULT!!!  I'M SORRY YOU WERE STUPID!  You know, the world does not revolve around her, even if she is the bride.  I am not in the wrong here.  The world doesn't revolve around me, either, but I would like some recognition of my existence and importance.  Lots has gone on in my life and she doesn't even care.  Did she ask me how my interview went (very well, mind you - could be a career move in my future)?  No.  Am I going to call her and tell her about camping or that I'm moving apartments or ... anything?  No, because she has made it clear that she doesnt' care and doesn't have the time to deal with people other than her fiance or issues other than the house or the wedding.   ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Oh, sweet Jesus, I need a new job!  I don't think I can work here much longer.  It's driving me crazy!  I need something of substance, to be making a difference, to be doing something vaguely important.  Not determining which computers need to be replaced.  Or answering phones.  Actually, the answering phones part isn't that bad, because usually its putting people in contact with people who will help them.  That's ok.  I enjoy that.  I am a helper, by nature.  I am not helping anyone in this job.  I really want the thing at Peace to work out.  They need to call me.  And I hope that I get approved for the car loan (although the likelihood of that happening is slim) - Harvey keeps lowering the price.

      Wow, I've been sentimental lately.  Maybe fall is the season for that.  Spent all last week thinking about old youth group kids.  And just now I was reminiscing about Bryan, of whom I  never  think.  I almost want to call him to see if he's going to Homecoming.  But no.  That's not my job.  If he wants to see me, he can get a hold of me.  It's hard - respecting myself enough to do that.

      I know I haven't posted in a while.  Want to get back into the swing of it.  Big weekend for me.  Big last couple of weeks, actually.  I bought a car on Saturday.  I know!  Huge deal, as far as I'm concerned.  urlLink  2001 Daewoo Nubira in Silver.   It took such a long time to get, and it cost more than I think I can afford, but still.  I have a working car now!  And it only has 34,000 miles on it.  Considering my now-dead Civic had 167,000 miles on it, was blowing white smoke from the exhaust, and needed oil every time I filled up on gas, let alone the fear I had every time I drove it that it would break down and leave me stranded somewhere.  Now I have a pretty car!  (The picture doesn't do it justice.)  Talked to my mom last night.  She had the closing on our old house on Friday, moved into the new house on Saturday, and had the closing for the new one this morning.  She had lots to talk about.  It was good to talk to her about the church stuff that's been going on (more about that later) too, because she was right there on my side, and made me feel like I wasn't overreacting or being too sensitive or anything.  I thought I was right.  We're going to an apple orchard this weekend!  I'm so excited!  A & L and I will be driving down and spending a good portion of Saturday afternoon picking apples and drinking cider and doing... orchard things.  Yay!  More problems with Pastor B.  Two weeks ago (the... 10th) I went in for my regular staff meeting with her.  It had been the first in a while since the summer schedule was different and didn't work for her.  It was also one day shy of my one-year anniversary, and she decided to use the opportunity to tell me all the thinsg I'd done wrong or had fallen short on in the past year.  Yeah.  Like an hour of "you could've done better" and "you screwed up when...."  Some of it was simply uncalled for, and some of it could have actually been dealt with if she had talked to me about it when it happened, back in April or whenever, because now I have no memory of said incidents and can't defend or deny or explain or accept responsibility or anything, because there's nothing to stand on.  So frustrating.  And she wants to add more to my list of duties, which means working more than they originally asked me to.  This is fine with me, and I don't want to be defensive, but I want it to be clear that this will mean I am turning in more hours and they will be paying me more.  They asked me originally to be 12-15 hours a week, and it's turning out recently to be more like 15-25.  Let's be honest here, folks.  So that's been really frustrating.  And A hasn't seemed like herself lately.  I wonder if she's just not happy living in the small apartment with me.  She has a bigger room, a place to escape, and for the past three weeks, she's even had a car to give her the freedom to leave if she needs to.  But she's also got a new job that isn't as cool as she thought it would be.    I'm definately going home for my college's Homecoming now.  It's next weekend.  I'm totally excited.  We're even planning a Female Flag Football alumni vs current students game, which I'm very pleased about.  It'll be a shorter trip home than I'd like,  because of the new youth group schedule, but still, it's a trip home where I'll get to see my friends and family, so I'm happy.

      Argh!!!  Called Pastor B to let her know that I wasn't going to come in today.  Didn't realized until last night that she thought I would be coming in  this  week.  I was planning on doing it next week.  We don't have any programming this week.  She was understanding, since she knew my car died a painful and horrible death this weekend and I couldn't make arrangements that fast for alternate transportation.  BUT.  She's got this real negative side, like overly critical of a lot of not very important stuff.  Or, maybe it's just that instead of encouraging me and supporting me to do the things she wants me to do, she makes it seem negative that I haven't done it already.  But there hasn't been a ton of communication about that stuff.  Ok, the camp calls I understand, they should have been done by now.  But calling the 6th graders to invite them personally to the group because she's heard some negative feedback, well, how was I supposed to know?  Nobody said anything to me.  And in the last four days I've sat through 5 hours of meetings, all specifically about the youth.  You think somebody would have mentioned it....  I know I could be doing a better job.  But I could be doing a worse job.  And when there's another church who actually WANTS me, not just tolerates me as a warm body in the interim, well gosh darn it if it doesn't make me want to work there even more.  To be fair, Pastor B doesn't know that I'm considering another church, that there's anybody interested.  She doesn't care about me as a person, though, and that's been my complaint for quite a while.  I need a pastoral staff who cares about me, even if it's just because they know that my emotional etc health affects the whole program.  I did have quite a busy last few weeks.  I worked almost 50 hours in the last 2 for church, on top of working full-time for the State, moving to a new apartment during the State Fair over Labor Day Weekend, and my car dying on Sunday morning.  It's not like I don't have STUFF going on.  When will people get that?

      So I hate using the phone.  But I was doing a really good job today, making phone calls to people I don't know and being the bearer of ungood news (mainly that we're taking some of their computers away).  I was really proud of myself (you would be too if you understood how much I hate making phone calls).  I stopped briefly to read an email that I got (cuz yahoo has that instant notification thing when one comes through), and it almost made me cry I was so happy.  Peace Lutheran still wants me!  I'm really glad.

      I'm fighting all these demons in my head.  Just being in the same room as this woman who now works at EPPC.  I feel the need to leave.  I wish Walgreens had been open so I could have gotten my prescription - at least I'd feel armed and protected.  I want soemone to talk to who'll tell me that I'm good at what I do, and someone to help me get over the whole situation.  Running away won't solve anything - sure, I won't be reminded of it as often, but it still will all have happened.  How do I deal?  I want to know how the kids are, what they're doing, what happened to so-and-so, how Matt is.  I want to warn her of all that happened, express how  wrong  they handled everything.  I want to drive by and see what things look like, and I want the whole town to not even exist.  I want to prove I'm worthy, but also that I don't need to prove anything to them.  I feel like I'm totally crazy.

      Beloved,  It's been a long time since I've written you, or even thought of you.  I seem to have lost you, or hope in the idea of you even.  Where are you?  Where am I?  I wish I could fill these pages with poetic phrases of my longings for you.  Instead, my pen hovers over the paper, unable to compose.  I love you, this I  know .  Right now it is merely a part of me, and not something that drives me or defines me.  I want to say I know you're out there, that when the timing's right we'll be together.  I have lost some (but thankfully not all) of my confidence in this.  And the thing is, I feel so capable of continuing on this way.  I can take care of myself, have career and life goals that are not shaped around you, and I know that life will go on and be... fine, without you.  I don't  need  you.  Such is the problem of being a 21st century woman.  We want to need you, but we don't want to at the same time.  In my head, I know that there are things about you that I will need.  Perhaps the way you help me deal with my family, or convince me to go outside my comfort zone, or make me blush just with a look.  I don't knwo the ways I need you though.  You're not concrete.  And I feel like I'm losing more of you as time goes on.  Can I lose you when you're not even here?  Or am I just losing parts of me?  I wish you were here right now - I have a feeling you'd clear up a lot of the fogginess in my head.  How much longer will it be?  When will you come?

      Talked to Pastor B today about the lent drama.  It went really well.  I didn't want to do it, but am so glad I did.  I used my feeling words, and accepted my responsibility in the matter, but didn't get emotional.  Actually, I don't get emotional at all lately, unless it's anger.  That's not right.  No comments about my haircut or color.  Well, two.  Sidenote: Pastor B does   not   have good hair.  First day of Lent - I'm giving up TV, and I did it, all day.  Granted, I was home and awake for maybe an hour total, but still.  I'm keeping PBS and the news, so I can stay "tuned in" to current events, and I can watch on Sundays because they don't count in Lent, but I'm not home much on Sundays.

      I  feel  very frustrated right now.  The actual meeting at church was fine - not exactly worth my time, but they were paying me....  I had so much negative energy afterwards though that I went to Target, and tried to turn it around by spending money on gifts for other people.  Unfortunately for Matea, they didn't have the right kind of pom-poms, so she got no new toys.  So the  urlLink Lenten drama  (see Feb 18 - my perma links aren't working).  Pastor B & S & DJM were having a meeting today where they'd review my work, see if it fit in the time constraints, etc.  Asked her tonight what the consensus was ahd she said it was a "little" long and they cut it down to six parts.  SIX!  They cut 40% of my work!  Now I know that I acted fairly laid-back about my work, but I was really excited about this project.  I completed it in 2 days.  I did props and staging and mics and everything.  It left me thinking, what's the point?  I am feeling as though some of my greatest moments of creativity are seriously crippled at my church.  I can understand the time I wanted to have communion and we couldn't because session has to vote on it - fine, that's the beaurocratic nature of the beast.  But then S & I were planning to do a stations of the cross for the kids using the teens, and I shared the idea (which people loved) and then Pastor B & DJM turned it into something completely different, without asking or consulting me, or even telling me until last week.  So they turned it into this drama thing which I did get input on, and then Pastor B asked if I'd be willing to write it, and I did, and AGAIN my ideas are scrapped.  Ok, so they kept 60%.  In school that's a failing grade.  That's about an hour's worth of work wasted.  I am feeling not appreciated.  I keep using feeling words so that when Pastor B and I talk on Wednesday I can use those words, and I can't be argued with.  Feelings are never wrong.  Perhaps how I act on feelings, but you can't tell me to  feel  differently.  I hate conflict - real conflict, that is.  I don't want to talk to Pastor B about it because I'll be defensive and I'll feel like I'm hurting her feelings, and I know in part that I'll be overreacting because I'm more sensitive than I let on and that's not fair to others.  So I feel even worse for feeling upset and needing to discuss it.  I know it would be healthy for me to have this conversation because I usually avoid them.  A does things that annoy me and I let them slide because I don't want to make her feel bad, or I'm trying to understand, but then she keeps doing them and I keep being annoyed.  That doesn't help.  I tell people at work I'll help them at their convenience, and carry on conversations with people who annoy the crap out of me because I don't want to be mean.  I can be strict.  I can uphold the rules.  I can be mean in jest, or unwittingly.  But I am too fully aware of my own feelings all the time to hurt another on purpose (unless I'm really mad - if I lose my temper, watch out!).  Am I a people pleaser?  I feel awful.  I feel wrong for being frustrated, and I know that's not true.  I'm upset.  I feel stifled and unappreciated.  Just one of the many reasons I keep looking for a new place of ministry.  I need to write my  urlLink Luther  essay, but not with the mood I'm in.  I'd love a nice long bubble bath, but we only have a shower.  And the toilet's running constantly again, so there's this incredibly aggravating sound in the apartment.  I was bitchy today.  I try to avoid using that word, but really, I was.  Really, right now, life just isn't the greatest.  Romantically I haven't a prospect in the world, unless I want to go back and flirt with our barely legal waiter from Friday night.  Emotionally I"m not feeling much of anything.  I miss my friends from college and the kinds of relationships we had, the things we talked about.  Physically I'm not that tired, but I have gained some weight that I'd like to take off, and I haven't worked out since Christmas.  Intellectually I've been slightly challenged at work lately, and I have a roommate with whom I can have smart conversations, as long as we can agree to disagree.  Spiritually I haven't done much (if anything) for myself lately.  I don't worship at the church I work at, but I've been too busy to be willing to spend free time trying someplace else.  I have learned a lot in my studies for youth group, but no one's been teaching me.  I have almost no fellowship with people who believe what I do.  The only evangelism I do is by just living my lfie, and I haven't done a very good job of that lately.  And I miss serving for the joy of serving.  Yeah, I work at a church, but it's  work .  I don't have time to volunteer at Open Arms or with the homeless or anything.  It's a recipe for burnout.  How do I stop?  Some of life is the way it is.  To change it would mean ... no money, or moving states, or being a different person than I am.  The solution that   I   see isn't available, that door isn't opening.  So I'm trying to make the best of the situation, but I guess I'm just really making a mess instead.  Listening to: "Streams" by Various Artists,  Job  by Cindy Morgan

      If you haven't noticed yet, I definately have a "type" of guy that I'm into.  Here's two more beautiful examples.    Now, just for the record, I like Jeremy Sisto in the Jesus miniseries, but not as Elton on Clueless.  Actually, I don't really like him when he has curly hair.  But he's so... charming and charismatic as Jesus, with the long hair.  He did a really good job in that movie.     I referenced Dermot Mulroney earlier - he really does look like the guy from high school.  Wish I had a picture of him so that you could see.    Contrary to popular belief, I'm not entirely boy-crazy.  Just lately, I've been appreciating God's handiwork.  Yeah, that's it.  No, here's the deal.  Putting the pics up makes it really easy for me to see that I've got a type.  I've known this, of course, and so do some of my friends who protest when I say I don't like blonds (ew, they look like my dad).  But really.  Isn't it obvious?  Dark hair.  Tall and lanky.  Perhaps a Jewish nose.  Oh, and pretty.  I know, so superficial.  Truthfully, that could all go down the drain if I found an amazing guy who walked every day with Jesus.  There's still a chance that he's out there, and that he looks like any of the above or below-referenced beauties.  Listening to: Josh Groban, "Never Let Go"

      It's so hot inside all the downtown buildings today.  It was yesterday, too.  We're all melting here.  And falling asleep.  It's a killer to be sitting at a computer, doing all the boring/tedious work you put off all week but now it's Friday and you might as well catch up... and have it be so warm.

Hopefully tomorrow we can go see  urlLink Beyond Boreas: A Puppet Show of Frozen Follies and Mythical Meltdowns .   The frappuccino is not helping.  I am still tired.  Wish I could go home early.

I'm walking through the skyway telling myself, I look good.  I look great.

I feel good about doing it, too.  The second time I went to donate blood, back in August or September, they told me that my donation was going to be used for up to four babies!  That got me hooked.  Plus, I know there are lots of people who can't give blood, whether it's because they're not healthy or whatever reason.  Like A, who passed out and chipped a tooth once, so now she can't give.

       urlLink the friday five    1. Are you superstitious?  No, on a practical level I don't believe in "all that stuff."  I am, however, much of a germophobe.   2. What extremes have you heard of someone going to in the name of superstition?  I can't think of anything.  I know when I was little we used to skip down the sidewalk, trying not to land on cracks.     3. Believer or not, what's your favorite superstition?  Throwing salt over one's shoulder seems... silly.  Walking under ladders always mades me duck my head a little bit.   4. Do you believe in luck? If yes, do you have a lucky number/article of clothing/ritual?  No, I don't believe in luck.  I actually was part of a church that wouldn't have potluck dinners because it used the word "luck," so they had "Community Dinners" or something to that effect.  I don't have a favorite number (except when exaggerating, and then it's usually 27 or 42), and I don't have lucky clothes (although some definately make me look cuter than others).   5. Do you believe in astrology? Why or why not?   I don't.  I used to read my horoscope all the time, and it never came true, and then it seemed to be a little... religious for me, so I stopped reading altogether.  I just recently have allowed myself to read, in fun, a horoscope or two.  They still don't come true.  I was supposed to meet a guy on the 8th of this month, and... NO.

      I'm sitting at Nina's Cafe reading C S Lewis's  urlLink Mere Christianity .  It's a really good book.  Very logical and still entertaining.  There was this great line, "Christianity is the story of how the rightful king has landed, you might say landed in disguise, and is calling us all to take part in a great campaign of sabotage."  That really stirs up the rebel in me.  And I'm listening to  urlLink Liz Phair ; it arrived this week and its still very new to me.  I haven't had much chance to listen to it.  Nina's Cafe is connected to an art supply store, and is frequented by a wide variety of patrons.  All of the above combined (plus the vanilla mocha which reminds me of JM), make me feel like writing.  The other day I felt like journaling so I got out my  urlLink Love Catcher  - it's supposed to guide me to find the love in my life.  It just left me wanting someone.  I was supposed to review the past and see if there were any patterns, especially destructive ones.  I couldn't see any, well, other than my not taking any action.  Let's review....  Brian Wade.  My first "real" boyfriend in seventh grade.  I believe our entire relationship consisted of a school dance, and then smiling at each other in the hallway for months.  In eighth grade there was Scott, who was about 4 feet tall and in seventh grade.  After school got out we went on a "Clean Up The Fox River" event and that was about all of our "relationship."  It was my first real date, though (group date, my mom called it).  I had a crush on Matt Zerby for nearly 7 years, on and off through junior high, high school, and college.  I either hated him or loved him.  I was never his type (as evidenced by his wife, who may be my polar opposite on this planet).  We flirted back and forth (or teased, I supposed, since I didn't realize until later that it may have been flirting - how much easier years of my life would have been if I could have recognized flirting earlier).  I was good friends with his sister.  Their older brother is cute, too.  Briefly I had crushes on two other Matts (all three at the same time for a while), one being my next door neighbor four years older than me, the other a guy from school a year or two older who was in the school play.  Marie B and I both had huge crushes on him and we probably egged each other on.  I wonder if he's gay?  A lot of the guys in the theatre from my high school are.  More high school crushes....  Pete Milbourn, but only for a week or so until someone showed me how stupid I was being.  Brian McGreer and I may have gone out on a non-date but nothing happened.  Mark and I flirted back and forth junior year and spent hours on the phone together, until he decided he wanted to date my best friend.  He did send me the best (beautiful and biggest) bouquet of flowers I have ever received , on my birthday that year.  I had a big crush on Brian Drab for the last two years of high school.  He was on the soccer team and GORGEOUS (looks like  urlLink Dermot Mulrooney  from "My Best Friend's Wedding").  We had the same piano teacher.  He was either really shy or not interested at all.  Heard he went to college and got a beer belly.  Too bad.  He didn't date anyone in high school.  I actually dated Kevin Pitz for six weeks the summer before senior year.  He was a year younger, so I drove us around.  It was very official, though, because on our first date we had to meet each other's parents.  He was really short, though, with blond skater hair.  He was my first kiss.  I wasn't attracted to him, though, and broke it off.  We had a great fourth of July though.  Then senior year I liked Daryl (a friend of Mark's) and even pursued him a little (I remember writing my phone number on his hand).  Our one and only date was seven hours long.  Four months later he called me and asked me to prom.  I declined.  Then came college.  I went to Homecoming freshman year with Garth Underwood (it would've been amusing if I'd married him, and then my sister would be Underbakke and I'd be Underwood.....).  We were hooked up by mutual friends, and we both had red hair.  We spent a weekend together with some other couples, but then he broke up with me.  Then I dated Michael Barclay, who was a really great guy.  He had been interested in another one of my friends, and a third was interested in him, so it was a little complicated.  We dated for two weeks, broke up for  two weeks (day after Valentine's Day), and then dated for two and a half months (the longest relationship so far).  He was my second kiss.  That summer I dated another Michael, who was much older, divorced with three kids, and lived downtown Chicago.  My parents didn't know about it.  It ended when he went to Russia to marry a girl named Olga.  Yeah.  I had a big crush on Vince Linden for a few years.  We had a deep email relationship but not much more (other than him being beautiful).  Shortly after I got over him I found out he was into athletic girls, so I wouldn't have even stood a chance.  Mike Noe and I were best friends for two years before things went awry.  One summer he dated my best friend Susan and I dated his best friend Brian.  Brian had a thing for his best friend Sherry, eventually getting her pregnant and marrying her.  Mike and Susan broke up because Mike liked me, which then killed our friendship for a while, but we recovered.  He just moved out to L.A. to be with his girlfriend of four years.  Then there was Bryan Silver, one of the greatest loves of my life.  Four years.  He looks like  urlLink Richard Gere  in "First Knight."  We were really good friends and I liked him and he liked me, but nothing ever happened.  I was madly in love with him for a long time.  The summer I was in San Francisco was the summer of Jeremy and Jason.  They both liked me.  Jason won (probably only because Jeremy and I were mature enough to realize that we would kill each other if left alone together), and then I broke his heart.  Not on purpose, it just wasn't meant to be.  My summer in Arizona finally got me over Bryan.  And then I liked Justin.  A lot.  Only he was my subordinate.  And really shy.  We had some great late night conversations, and I think we would have been great together.  He was three years younger than me and still finishing college.  Now he's in Chicago getting his Master's degree.  Over Christmas, I met my dad's wife's half-step-nephew and liked him, but never got the chance to go anywhere with it.  And that's it.  All... 22.  In 13 years.  Three kisses, a lot of hand holding, a dozen or so dates, one Valentine's day, one fourth of July, all in all five months of dating.  Not terribly impressive, except maybe in the volume of guys I've managed to crush on.  So what's going to make the next 10 years different?  I have no idea.

       urlLink the friday five   1. What's the most daring thing you've ever done? Within 24 hours I decided to take a job in Arizona for the summer (from Minnesota) and left within 2 weeks.  2. What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of? I'd really like a tattoo.  3. On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle) I'm pretty cautious.  Probably a 2.  4. What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky? In Arizona I made some of the best friends I have.  And I got over a guy while I was there.  And had the chance to heal over getting fired.  5. ... and what's the worst? I was really unprepared for that summer (and, to be honest, a little emotionally unstable).

       urlLink Dictionary.com/frustrated : "frus-trate To prevent from accomplishing a purpose or fulfilling a desire; thwart: A persistent wind frustrated my attempt to rake the lawn.  To cause feelings of discouragement or bafflement in.  To make ineffectual or invalid; nullify. "  Huh.  I didn't know that's what frustrated means.  I know what it feels like.  Boy, do I know.  (Note to A: don't read this.  Especially when you're already upset with me for mother nature.  But seriously, you were warned.)  Note to everyone else:  I have a problem expressing myself.  Specifically (to use A's word), expressing when I am upset, hurt, wronged, angry, or otherwise.  Now, I do a fine job of expressing it to others, but to the person(s) with whom I am upset, I just can't.  I think this stems from the way I was raised - there was never conflict in my house.  If my parents disagreed (which I don't ever remember even experiencing), my dad is so laid-back that he would be non-committal and ignore the situation, and my mom was so... sacrificial? that she would make the decision in his favor.  My dad will lose his temper every once in a while, but I don't know if I can count on one hand how many times family members and I have had positive interactions over conflict.  College and other friends have helped, and sometimes I'm capable of pushing myself to say what I'm thinking and feeling, but usually only at the perceived "end" of a relationship when it's most comfortable.  This is not an excuse for my behavior.  But please understand.  So this weekend I was "crabby," as A called it.  I was mad for a lot of the weekend (Friday night and Sunday specifically).  And yes, it was "that time of the month" and so my hormones were a little more out of whack than usual.  And yes, I hadn't been taking my medication (which is NOT a mood-altering drug, but helps me have the energy to be me).  Regardless, I still think I was justified to be upset over the things I was upset about.  I have waited to talk about this because I wanted to know if it would go away (key sign that, in fact, it was just hormones).  It hasn't.  And A's comment yesterday about me needing to take my meds so that a repeat of this weekend wouldn't happen just upset me further.  It had nothing to do with that, and everything with people just doing crappy things.  Another note: I am easily agitated.  Lots of things annoy me.  I realize this is a serious (potentially fatal) character flaw.  Usually it's insignificant things, like stupid Minnesota drivers or people walking too slow in the skyway.  I don't lose my temper, I don't break out in rage, I don't conceal and carry.  I just FEEL.  Usually I'm not close enough to whatever is upsetting me to do any damage.  Rarely am I that upset with something near me.  And if I am, I seem to be unable to express it constructively.  I rather just let it sit inside of me and fester.  Yeah, that's healthy.  Part of this is, I think, feeling that, in my anger, I am somehow wrong to feel this way, and that the other person/thing really isn't at fault, but me.  (Now I sound like A, but that's another story.)  And so, as I try right now to write about what frustrated and upset me this weekend, I find myself needing to apologize.  "I'm sorry, but I think that the things you did were really crappy."  I don't think that's the best way to say it, but it's what comes to mind first.  I know I should use "I feel... when" statements, but seriously, who wants to sound like a junior high school assembly?  To sum up, A, if you're reading (like I told you not to), yes, I think you did crappy things this weekend and that I was justified to be upset.  And, yes, I handled it incorrectly.  And no, I'm not still mad.  And for the rest of you, hopefully someday I can figure out how to get upset without self-destructing in the process.  Because it's really not that fun to be mad.

      Could life be more complicated?  This is what I get for making blanket statements.  I rashly said this weekend that I wasn't reformed in my theology.  Well, guess what, that's totally wrong!  I spoke out of my butt, apparently.  I AM a reformed theologian.  Who knew?  Wanna know why?  Well, even if you don't, you get to find out.  Here's my simple explanation of reformed theology, based widely on  urlLink this document .   The Bible  - it's a good thing.  Use it.  As the basis for everything.  It's authoritative, it's true, it's written by God.  God  - He's sovereign.  As in, in control of everything.  EVERYTHING.  And over everything and above everything and generally the one in charge and BETTER than everything too.  Sovereign = ruler, king.  That's the God of reformed faith.  Calvin  - yeah, we like him.  A lot.  TULIP, all that, it's good.  We believe it.  Yes, I'm a Calvinist.  Always have been.  I should finish reading the  urlLink Five Points of Calvinism .  Hmm.  Where did I put that?  The World  - yeah, go into it and DO something.  Surprisingly enough, I can't really find anything specific about Jesus.  I mean, He's mentioned in TULIP, but... I'm looking for more.  I'll try to get back to this.

      Part of the concert involved special guest  urlLink Jeremy Camp .  I have enjoyed his "Stay" album since it came out, and have had a bit of a crush on him as well (which, as it turns out, wouldn't work for a variety of reasons, including the fact that he just got married in December).  I absolutely LOVE his music.  There's a song called "I Still Believe," which is about life being crappy and still believing, still having faith.  He told us that it was the first song he wrote after  urlLink his wife's death three years ago .  If I've got my math and details right, he was 22 and they'd only been married a few months.  Now he's 25 (and remarried) - he's my age.  Then he sang the song.  I had to try to keep myself from crying, it was so moving.  Also, after the concert I was standing by the Compassion booth, and an old co-worker came up to me.  This was someone I'd worked with at the church I'd been fired from.  She's a super-sweet person - before I got fired she had me over for Easter with her parents, since I couldn't go home and my family wasn't coming up.  Back in the fall I had been at a training session where  urlLink I met the person they hired to replace me  (but not really, because they revamped their entire staffing structure at the church), and then shortly after that I found out that the associate pastor had left.  I finally felt able to "release" the whole situation - I no longer check the website for updates, etc.  Talking to this wonderful woman I found out that the senior pastor had recently left - he was the one who, essentially, fired me.  I just don't know what to do with that information.  He and his family went back to California.  Long ago I stopped thinking that I saw him on the street or heard his voice (although there was this one horrible temp job I had where someone down the hall had the same voice as he did and it grated on me every day and kinda put me on edge).  Now it's really over.  I mean, he's not dead or anything, but he's definately far far away.  Yay.  Sorry if I sound like a horrible person, but what he did was awful, and I haven't found a way to forgive him yet.  While I'm glad things turned out how they did, because it obviously wasn't a situation I wanted to be part of, and I never would have gotten to make the friends I have now or had the Arizona experience or anything else that has happened in the 2 years since, the experience itself is within the top 2 most horrible times I've ever lived through.  I need some lunch.  Listening to: Kenny Bristo and Bj Irmiter, " urlLink 113 " on the same CD

      I got to go to a really awesome concert this weekend.  I sponsor a child named Iriseth, who lives in Columbia, through  urlLink Compassion International .  Compassion emailed some of us a while back because they needed volunteers to work at their booth at a concert at the Xcel this weekend.  I was free, so I decided why not.  I figured I would get to listen to a bunch of cool music (if not see it, since I figured I'd be busy working the whole concert) and do something good with my time.  I like Compassion.  I joked all week that I was going to be "selling children" at the concert, but really, it's a pretty serious thing.  On the top of one of my piles was a little boy who was not even 4.  I don't know all of the criteria for how they select children, but what a sucky life, to start out so young, being in need of so much help.  I gave him away first.  The cool thing was that I got to see most of the concert, since I ended up being a rover and not working at the table.  It was a combination concert - the  urlLink iWorship tour  and the  urlLink Adoration tour  happened to come to the Twin Cities at the same time, so they joined up, which meant that everybody cut their gig in half, but you got, like, 4 times the concert.  It started at 6:30 and didn't get out until almost 11!  I had an awesome time.  I stood in the back of the main level (not the floor, but the seats) right around door 117 (if any of you know where that is) and had a pretty good view the whole time (except when this one guy between me and the stage would stand up, but he didn't do that much).  What was great was that I really felt free to worship.  In  urlLink college , all of a sudden worship looked different than it had at my  urlLink church  growing up.  We barely clapped for the little kids' choir growing up, and all of a sudden, people were praising God with their whole bodies!  It was strange and unnerving at first, but God gave me the gift of eyelids - seriously, He showed me I could worship quite well with my eyes closed, and then I wouldn't be paying attention to anyone but me & Jesus.  I had quite a few friends who were charismatic in their worship styles, and secretly longed to be able to express myself freely like they did, with hands lifted high, jumping about, whatever.  I could never seem to escape myself (or thinking about others around me) though.  Since college, I've worked at quite a few churches, all of which have been conservative in their worship.  It's a struggle to get my current church to clap during a song to the beat.  And when A & I go to The Rock where other people are worshipping freely, I feel overly-conscious about what she (and others) will think of me.  It's irrational, I know, but it's always been that way.  Well, this weekend I was alone.  No one there knew me.  And I finally felt able to praise God with all of me, hands lifted, dancing, voice.  It was wonderful.  More later.  Listening to: Jeff Deyo & Rita Springer, "Bless the Lord" on  urlLink Worship Leader's Song Discovery , volume 43

      Many, many things to think through about this weekend.   First things first.  We painted!  Here's what we did:        Isn't it pretty?  Ok, if you can't tell, the blue and the yellow are the living/dining room.  We're thinking we're going to do the entry-way in blue and the kitchen in yellow (it's all really one room anyways).  The taupe/khaki is A's "cave" as it is now affectionately called, and the fluorescent lime green (it's not that bad, really), is my room, which is only about a quarter done.

      That's right, today is BEAUTIFUL!!!  It is a Mocha Malt Frapuccino Day!     That is, of course, until you're reminded of things like AIDS by  urlLink this email article  I got today.  Nonetheless, it is beautiful outside.  We bought paint yesterday.  I was so giddy at Ace that I could barely contain myself.  We got home and taped and spackled, and then were so excited that we painted the blue wall.  Pacifica, it is.  It took about an hour (we decided not to use the rollers, but just to do it with brushes).  This morning, A decided that she was unable to attend work today.  She is painting and sleeping.  I am jealous, but not overwhelmingly so, because my shoulders will appreciate the break.  Our ceilings may not be that high, but it's still work.     I am a  urlLink Starbucks  girl.

      Well.  About not blogging yesterday - I was at the world's most boring meeting ever, also known as my monthly SRC gig, where I take minutes for someone who's taking minutes about things I really don't (but perhaps should) care about.  Now I'm back.  Bridesmaid dress FINALLY ordered.  Bride actually had bad dream about me not being able to be in the wedding because my dress hadn't come in yet.  We don't want that - I mean, we don't want the bride having nightmares.  That's no good.  These beautiful shoes that I am wearing were a mistake.  A will tell you that the shoes are hideous, but I disagree.  They are charming.  And they perfectly match my burgundy pants.  They're  urlLink Hush Puppies , so one would think they'd be comfortable.  But they're not.  I got them second-hand at a local store, and they had barely been worn.  I know why.  I've always known they were painful.  Somehow I forgot this fact this morning, when I put them on before WALKING TO WORK.  3 miles in painful shoes.  Blisters on feet (multiple, that's right) before I even got to work.  So, sadly, away they will go.  They're so painful I almost feel bad giving them to Goodwill - some poor person will find them and think they're a great deal and go home and their feet will bleed from these shoes.  Alas.  On the plus side, it means I get to buy shoes soon.  Our landlord told us we can paint!  Oh, the joy!  We walked to  urlLink Ace Hardware  last night and picked out paint samples, and then finalized our decisions at home.  My walls will be.. some sort of "Grass" color (not Prairie, but another....).  A's will be... Coconut or Caramel or some food that started with a C.  And then the living/dining/everything room will be a beautiful yellow on 3 walls and blue on the fourth.  I don't remember their names.  Very happy.  My wallet situation took a down-turn this week, and A is being so gracious as to allow me to pay her back when I get $$ next week.  This means our apartment/attic/living hole will look... NICE (read: not ghetto) when my mom comes up next weekend.  I'm going to take that Friday off so I can install shelves in my room and the living room as well.  We saw a totally hot guy yesterday at the  urlLink gym .  Now, I'm going to repeat this, in case witnesses yesterday didn't learn.  When you are at the gym and fumbling with some piece of equipment, and said cute guy comes over and offers to show you how to use it, by all means, let him!  Even if it just means watching in wonder as his muscles ripple and move.  Even if the only words you can find are, "uh, sure" or nodding your head.  Try to smile.  Try not to drool.  If you can be so bold, make eye contact.  Establishing any sort of positive contact/interaction with any cute guy CAN NOT be bad.  Even if you make a fool of yourself, which I've been known to do many a time (story coming up), hey, at least you got to be in the presence of gorgeous.  I am naturally a very shy person.  And, quite frankly, if anyone I'm with is braver/bolder than I, I'm quite happy to remain quiet and aloof (which other people see as b*tchy).  Conveniently, yesterday A was not being her usual bold brazen confident self, and I got to be the one to talk to cute boy.  Now he's mine.  I am formally claiming him.  Unless, of course, he has a wife, or worships satan, or turns out to be otherwise undesirable.  Lest anyone get the wrong opinion of me, last night events at the gym were rather out-of-character for me.  When L & I would do open mic at the  urlLink Coffee Grounds , there used to be this really good-looking guy who played a 12-string, and he was married, and he'd talk about his wife, and sometimes she was there, and sometimes she wasn't.  Once after we performed, he came over to us and gave us compliments, tried to encoruage us, embolden us.  I actually was unable to speak.  He was that good looking.  And isn't it a beautiful thing to be in the presence of someone that beautiful?  God does great work!  :-)  Listening to: Zen Voyages, "Amazon Rain Forest"

Unlike earlier, when I LIED (or assumed that the process would be easy and hence over quickly) about having ordered my bridesmaid's dress for Betsy's wedding, I am now finally actually able to do that.  It's this small matter of getting measurements.  You can't do it yourself.  They yelled at me for that and wanted to order me a size 16.  I wear a size 6 pants.  Yeah.  All the bridal shops in my neighborhood, sans una, close before I get off work.  And the one that's left, well, it's very popular and I just didn't want to mess with that madhouse for the "small" matter of getting my measurements taken, especially when I wasn't ordering the dress through them (over the phone to a company in Illinois, actually).  Well, today I resorted to begging and pleading, and found out that if you act helpless enough and smile pretty enough, a very short woman (she was not much taller than my naval) who is super-nice will come down from Alterations and take your measurements.  She has saved me.  I am about 3 weeks late in ordering this dress.  Thankfully, at least all the dresses are different colors, so they weren't waiting for my order to send all the others in (matching dye-lots and all).  Thanks once again, Field's!

      Everyone is getting married.  Apparently, I have missed some crucial memo or meeting or event where everyone hooked up.  Maybe it was last week while I was sick (I am feeling much better now, thank you, just a head cold and a little cough).  One of A's college roommates called over the weekend to say she's engaged.  This led to a discussion of exactly how many single friends either of us have left.  Very few was the consensus.  I have gotten obscene amounts of sleep lately.  Saturday I was showered, dressed, and ready to leave the house by 5.  PM.  That's ridiculous.  However, those... three hours of life were very productive.  Hopefully A will detail her weekend on  urlLink her blog .  I am quite frustrated (no, that's not the word... disappointed isn't right either, distraught?  perhaps a bit melodramatic... we'll just settle for "upset") about the turn of events.    Senior high youth group last night was good, even though only one kid showed up.  We had a good time talking with her, and a very... serene time spent journeying the "exodus" story.  Complete with dark room and candles.  And purple sand to throw in the candle.  Hopefully I can get some good pictures of the finished product to show here - a 5 week project in-the-making.  My single (very, very single) self is signing off for now to go back to the world of work.  Well, not really work, seeing as there's no actual   work   to be done.  But I will be in my cube.  My large cube.  Larger than it will be in the future.  Think big.  It will be ok.  Small is good.  Really.  Listening to: "Rock Me All Night" by Liz Phair

       urlLink the friday five : If you...  1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve? I'm not sure, but I know this - the portions would be of a reasonable size, not this giant-have-to-get-a-doggy-bag kind going around restaurants these days.  2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell? books and coffee.  Maybe books about coffee.  And artwork.  Artwork of books and coffee.  3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be? Fictional coming-of-age romance, if I could think of something worthy of being published.  Or, self-help, how to live your life (some people just need my help!)  :-)  4. ...ran a school, what would you teach? about the Bible and God and Christianity and Jesus and all things therein related  (I don't think therein is used properly there, but I like it)  5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it? folk songs, love songs, fairly mellow (not norah-jones-ish though, I think that's a little overdone).  I'm a big fan of doing cover songs, so I'd probably just scam a bunch of other people's good stuff.

      And it's now settled into my bronchial system.  I sound like a man.  I would say that I could sing tenor or even bass, but that's not true, because any singing I do sounds like a cat being strangled.  Or worse.  But here I am at work.  And one of my bosses is on vacation for a week.  The nice one who gives me good work and projects, not the... grumpy one who gives me stupid gopher work (photocopies, hole punching, mail sorting, etc).  What to do with myself?  Blog.  Unfortunately, not much is going on of late, since I am sick and have spent every waking hour 1)working, 2)eating, or 3)watching movies.  So I must come up with a story from my childhood.....  Let's see......  (Still thinking)  Ok, not a story from my childhood.  How about one from last week?  A & I went to the Y to work out, and afterwards decided we needed to go to Target to get, of all things, locks for the lockers.  Trolling through the store, looking for locks (if you want to know, at the University/Midway location they're on an endcap in the "Home" section) when A suddenly sees an old roommate of ours.  Now, for some background information, this old roommate, J, lived with us at Asbury house, along with about a billion other people (ok, there were six official residents, but then there were boyfriends that spent the night and girlfriends, and for a while, 2 cats whose names I never did get right).  I have to say that J is a fine physical specimen of the male form.  He and A briefly (and I mean BRIEFLY) and a "thing" that I don't think can even be qualified as a "fling" it was so short.  I believe neither of them was thinking clearly.  Well, after that, J quickly became the most annoying roommate ever (which, if you knew the rest of the people that lived there, was a pretty hard thing to accomplish).  So much of a pain, in fact, that he was one of the main reasons A & I moved out and got our own place.  A, of course, told our landlord this, who may or may not have repeated this to J.  But J moved out (or was forced out?) a little before we did, and was supposedly moving back with his parents about 45 minutes north of the cities.  And then we saw him at our Target.  Yes,   our   Target.  He didn't see us.  Or, at least, he didn't make contact with us.  Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.  Who knows?  We made our lock decisions and rushed out of the store before further interaction could be made.  On telling of this story, perhaps it's not as funny as it was when it happened.  Maybe I'm just not a good storyteller.  I've often wondered that.  I mean, I'm a good story-reader, but that's a lot different from story-teller.  Hmm.  I'll have to think about that.  Comments welcome.

      That's the good news.  The bad news is that a co-worker of mine who may have what I have said her doctor told her 4 weeks.  4 weeks of being sick.  She's on week 3.  She asked how long I've been sick.  I said Monday.  I guess I'm in for the long haul.  It's been interesting, how the virus has morphed each day to present with a different set of symptoms.  Perhaps this is a virus created by the drug companies just so that we have to buy all of their products.  Today I am breaking rules.  I am wearing white pants.  Before Memorial Day.  Before the official start of spring.  Gasp!  I like breaking rules.  Well, ones that don't have consequences.  I'm hungry and I'm afraid of my lunch.  That's never a good sign.

      Very Sick.  Slept all day yesterday.  Literally.  I was awake for, maybe, 8 hours total.  And I'm still tired this morning.  I will survive though.  I did go to work today (hence the blogging, since we have no internet at home).  Being sick makes me grumpy, and weak, and unable to control my tongue.  Bad for work.  Bad for junior high youth group tonight.  Perhaps they will have mercy on me (and consequently themselves) and be kind tonight.  Maybe it will be a "hug bug" night.  I did watch "The Ten Commandments," all 3 hours and 40 minutes of it, yesterday, and parts of "Prince of Egypt" and "The Wizard of Oz."  Can you tell what tonight's youth group lesson is about?  Alas, we learned over the weekend that the boy I could have had a crush on is, still, in fact dating his girlfriend, and while he has not yet proposed, apparently still plans to do so.  No more crush.  The death of a crush is always such a sad thing.  Especially since crushes are, in their most pure and innocent form, simply happy thoughts about another, and while a rather frivolous way to spend one's time, much better than, say, planning genocide or vacuuming.  Yes, that's right, I'm not fully coherent today.  Terribly sorry.

         I fear I am getting sick.  Yesterday I talked with my mom on the phone and she was just getting over a bad cold, and I happened to have said, I didn't get sick this year.  My mistake.  The season is not over.  How stupid of me.  I woke up this morning with a sore throat.  I am taking the above, which taste extremely disgusting, but enable me to stay awake and soothe my throat (unlike Nyquil, which would just put me to sleep so I could ignore the pain).  Speaking of pain, A & I went to PowerBarz, a combination of Step Aerobics and Weight Lifting.  OUCH!!!  There are muscles in places I didn't know muscles were, and they hurt!  There's this one on the inside of my elbows that, at this moment, prevents me from extending my arm fully.  Who needs arms?

      Its getting increasingly harder to walk to work.  After yesterday morning's fiasco came the walking home experience, which involved high gusting winds and RAIN.  Then this morning I leave the house to find out that it's   winter again  .  Who knew?  Not prepared for this (as in no long underwear, no ear warmer, and I shaved my legs this morning, which was silly, because it would have been an extra layer of protection), I braved it out in the 9 degree weather (with windchill around 17 below).  Starbucks saved me (the light at the end of the tunnel) and provided a place for my legs to thaw.  I am not looking forward to the walk home, although I hear the windchill is now up to about 8 below.  I take solace knowing that  urlLink others join me in this plight .

      Ok, I'm the first one to admit that I don't particularly care for or about my job.  After all, this is not what I went to college for.  This is what you do when you get fired from what you want to do and can only find a part-time job doing that, so you do administrative support work instead.  This is not a job that requires a college degree, especially not a specific one.  I'm pretty sure you have to be a high school graduate, but other than that....  Anyway, there are some aspects of my job that I've... shall we say... invested a lot of time into.  One of them happens to be our reports page on our intraweb.  We did a major revamping of it about a month ago, which included many many hours of my working in this great program called  urlLink SoThink DHTML .  And while the work itself is not hard, per se, it is incredibly monotonous and painful, especially because some of what we have out are "team" reports, and there are 20 teams, and each team has its own page, and then we'd go and change one thing, but that meant the same thing had to be changed on all 20 pages... you get my drift.  Well, our reports guy went on vacation a few days ago (to Hawaii, he and his wife go every year, for about 3 weeks) and so other people are "in charge."  Which basically means that everything goes to pot and people freak out about the smallest things.  All this to say that, because of a "security issue," my reports page has been "pulled" and is no longer functioning until at least tomorrow.  If they destroyed it, they're in big trouble.  Do they want to re-write the page?  I don't.  And I don't want to have to re-do ALL the links (imagine, hundreds and hundres of typing small corrections into a little dialog box....)  Very frustrated.  Perhaps this will make the walk home (uphill) easier.

      Today I walked to work. As the crow flies, it's only 2-3 miles, with one large hill (downhill on the way there, thankfully) that I'm sure adds somethign to the distance.  And the logical question is, why did I walk to work today?  Let's back up a bit.  I take the bus to work, in downtown St Paul, from the Selby-Dale neighborhood.  It's an enjoyable bus ride, about 6-10 minutes, and the bus stop is no more than 2 blocks from home or work on either end.  We've got the Metropass program at work, so it's cheaper than driving and parking (and paying for gas, etc).  So I only use my car for church and errands.  But last week the bus drivers went on strike.  No more free transportation (ok, not free, but they take it out of my paycheck before I even see the money, so, kinda free).  No more carefree, stress-free mornings on the bus (except when that weird-smelling lady sits next to you, or the guy who tried to pick you up once is riding again today....).  Now, I'm driving.  Not only am I driving, but in order to park in the cheapest spot possible (although yesterday I did see a lot that was $1/day, but I didn't believe it) for $2/day, it's a good 10-15 minute walk from the parking lot to my building.  And it takes probably 10-15 minutes to drive to the parking lot.  So instead of it taking 10 minutes to get to work, it now takes 30, and costs more (they're still taking the MetroPass $$ out of our paychecks until the strike is over, and then we can request a refund), and is infinitely more frustrating.  Yesterday one of my co-workers who lives farther from downtown mentioned that he's been walking, as he is vehemently opposed to commuting, for ecological reasons etc.  I realized that I agreed with him on that point, also having a distaste for commuting, and also loving the environment (although not enough to rid my life of plastic completely).  And, I got it in my head that I should walk to work.  So I did.  It only took 45 minutes, and I had my walkman, and my ear-warmers, and I took out the trash, stopped by the ATM, and got coffee and a muffin, all within that time.  I even forgot to walk briskly, so as to get to work quicker, because I was enjoying myself so much.  Almost forgot that I was going to work, it was such a lovely stroll.  However, we will see how I feel about the "stroll" home.  Uphill.  Up the Cathedral Hill.  I sense pain already.  (The other forseeable problem is good walking shoes that look appropriate with work clothes.)  There was a good article in yesterday's  urlLink Star Tribune  about the bus strike.  Also, if you would like to get involved, my bus driver friend tells me the thing to do is to write the  urlLink Governor  and request he make the bus driver's "essential employees," which would require them to work under their old contract while in dispute.  Everyone wins that way.  Well, sort of.  As much as anyone can win in this situation.

      So I was reminded today of the first (and only, because I'm not stupid) time I swore in front of my parents.  I was sixteen (or soon to turn it) and was learning how to drive.  My dad had been teaching me on Saturdays mostly, in the parking lot of his store and then on the ride home (funny side note, he would recline his seat all the way and go to sleep, and I'd been driving not very long....) and sometimes out in the country (the official test of good driving - can you check out if the farmer has sowed his rows straight without going off the road?).  But this time I was driving and BOTH parents were in the car.  This flustered me to no end, and about 3 blocks from my house I was going to make a left turn into a parking lot, and there was a car coming, and instead of hitting the brake I slammed on the accelerator, while doing a left turn, hit the curb, took a chunk off the hubcap on the passenger's side, and said "sh*t!" which was quickly followed by "sorry."  I'm not actually even sure they heard it, they could have been so confused and scared about what had just happened.  But there it is.  One time, my mom was talking to my sister, and my mom called someone a b*tch, and my sister said, "ooh, can I say it too?"  My sister was a senior in high school at this time.  Now then, anyone who wonders why I might be a little... conservative, shall we say... take this into account when judging me.  Listening to: Maroon 5, "Harder to Breathe" and "This Love"

      I'm walking outside to get some fresh air so that I don't fall asleep at work.  Coming back from Caribou, crossing the street, two guys in their truck turn off their very loud rap music so they can tell me I'm sexy.  Thanks, I think.  How is one supposed to respond to that?  Sorry I haven't blogged much lately, that is, my apologies to my 1.5 readers.  Bridesmaid dress has been ordered for Betsy's wedding.  No pictures available anywhere, otherwise I'd share....  Actually, I haven't seen them at all.  What I know is that mine is lilac (we all get to wear different colors of the same style), they are full-length skirts and some kind of embroidered top.  I still haven't made arrangements to fly to Sarah's wedding in Boston.  I'm mostly broke right now.  Conveniently, the YWCA in my neighborhood is waiving its joiner's fee until the 21st, so hopefully I'll be able to join and save myself the $100.  More later... must finish making a table of contents on a 211 page document.  :-(  Listening to: Michael Jackson, "Billie Jean"

Forgive me, but I didn't actually know anyone was reading, so I didn't think to actually explain myself.  I grew up in a Christian home, Christian community, went to a Christian college, and have worked in many a Christian church.  Needless to say, there's a whole inside language and so forth that go with this...  So about Lent.  The way I understand it, Lent is a time to prepare one's self for Easter, the celebration of the day Jesus rose from the dead, conquering death and evil.  There's this whole tradition of giving stuff up for Lent, and I did some research to see where that came from.  Beliefnet's Kenneth Briggs answers:  When I was a kid, everyone in my family was supposed to give something up for Lent, but I never got the point. And we were told that Sunday was an exception, when we could go back to our old ways. True?    'Tis little wonder that this practice gets fuzzy in an age of go-go affluence. The tradition of giving something up for Lent goes back to the time when doing without was an actual hardship--when it was about relating to Jesus' suffering during his 40 days in the wilderness. Some devout souls still follow that path of penance and sacrifice. But often today the custom, when it's still followed, is largely about me, yet another grand gesture for improvement of the anxious self. Giving up Johnny Walker Black, or the Four Seasons restaurant or Godiva chocolates or Havana cigars or afternoons at the casino, may be a terrific tactic for instilling temperance or weight loss but hardly ranks with following Jesus' suggestion to the rich young ruler that he sell all he had and give it to the poor. (Scripture notes, wryly, that the young man "went away very sad for he had great possessions"). As for Sunday being exempted, since no church expressly requires people to do the give-up thing, that would be a personal decision.    urlLink Here's another article on giving up stuff for Lent   And yet  urlLink another , hopefully helpful, explanation about Lent  As a reference, here's  urlLink Beliefnet's Lent tool   I'm just gonna let other people do the talking, since they can explain it better.  But let me explain me.  I gave up TV for Lent.  Probably sounds stupid to a lot of people (except my roommate, who is visibly and audibly ecstatic).  Here's the deal - I watch too much TV.  Too many shows, too many reruns, too many channels (and we don't have cable), way too much time spent on something that is, essentially and purely, entertainment.  And not even good entertainment.  There's so many wrong or misleading messages in most TV, and bad commercials, and language, and sex, and... all this grossness, that usually I just ignore for the sake of entertainment and taking my mind off my life.  I'm a fairly ... aware girl when it comes to TV - I know when something's being shown that I don't agree with, and I don't let it have the power of persuasion over me (all those shows I watch with teenagers having sex have yet to change my mind on the issue, even though it really does seem "normal" and if "everyone's doing it").  That doesn't mean, however, that I don't get   involved   with TV.  I have favorite shows, and favorite characters, and favorite storylines.  There are shows I could watch in reruns until I've missed a week of work (yes, I do have the first four seasons of  urlLink Dawson's Creek  recorded on VHS).  I'd like to take this chance to cleanse TV from my system.  It should have much less importance in my life.  When out for dinner with my friends, I should not say, "Shoot!  I forgot to record ___ (fill in the blank)!"  It's not much of a sacrifice to give up TV (obviously it won't cause me any physical pain), but hopefully giving it up will help me to re-prioritize my life and give things that actually have significance and meaning a higher place.  Ideally, also, this means that instead of sitting watch TV on the nights that I'm home, I'll spend some time reading, mostly books about Jesus, or my Bible.  Or just doing more productive things, like writting letters to good friends, or keeping my apartment clean.  And, of course, I might get to bed earlier if I'm not up late watching " urlLink That 70's Show " reruns.  We'll see how it goes.  I've never given something up for Lent before - it wasn't a practice in my family growing up, or in my church, or really at any of the churches I've worked at.  Sean,  thanks for letting me know you're reading!  Did I explain myself well?  I'm still feeling a little fuzzy about the issue.  Listening to: Eric Clapton, "The Cream of Clapton"

      What's for lunch today?  Well, glad you asked.  Half a bag of deli-mustard pretzels from yesterday.  And a Java Chip Frappuccino (yes, that is the former Chocolate Brownie Frappuccino.  I asked.  And yes, I'm aware that I can't actually spell Frappuccino right.  But I do it the same way each time.  Charming, no?)

      The last few days have been interesting.  Talked to my dad on Sunday night and found out he's been called back to his temporary job, and he had an interview on Monday, a second interview.  He's been out of worklong enough - I really think he deserves this.  Talked to my sister on Sunday night too.  We hadn't talked in 3 or 4 weeks (despite the fact that we live less than an hour apart).  Amazingly enough, neither of us had much to say.  Tried to talk to my mom.  She hasn't called me back yet.  Huh.  Did get an email though.  I've been broke all week.  Actually brought all my change to work on Tuesday - $15 - so I could enjoy coffee until payday (tomorrow).  Had minor crisis yesterday while driving to church, realized (remembered?) that my spending habits suck and I'm so crappy at finances and I might not be able to go to Boston for Sarah's wedding.  A helped me out, though.  We might be driving together.  Instead of me flying alone.  Personal life has been... more exciting this week than it has been in a while.  Church was rough yesterday.  Two of my junior high boys (ok, my only two junior high boys) were over-the-top last night, and I had to keep them afterwards to tell them that if their behavior was ever repeated, I would send them home and talk to their parents.  That's always a fun conversation to have.  Small amount of hammock-sitting, too.  Such a delight.  I know A thinks she loves hammocks more than anyone in the world, but I gotta say my appreciation for them is up there.    Co-worker gave me a Krispy Kreme today.  It didn't go so well with the Pop Tarts I was eating for breakfast/lunch.  So later I had a frapuccino and mustard pretzels for lunch/afternoon snack.  Guess what I feel like right now?  Finally got rocks for the bottom of Monster's fish bowl.  They're purple, and coordinate nicely with his red body and blue stripes.  He really likes the rocks.  Hangs out with them a lot.  He's much happier and more active, too.  Plus, it keeps the water cleaner for a longer period of time.  Peace out!

      I have not posted much lately (or at least, it feels that way).  It's not that I haven't had anything to say - in fact, there have been quite a few things that I've thought I should blog about.  But I've been caught up in (a little bit of) work and, (more involving) reading some really good blogs.  I particularly recommend  urlLink Tequila Mockingbird .  It's hilarious.  And while this may not be what you came here for today, I've decided to write down a few of my political/social welfare beliefs.  Just to clear things up for my own head.  All life has worth.  Hence, I am pro-life.  And pro-adoption.  And very anti-partial-birth abortion (as well as the other kinds, too).  Things don't necessarily work they way they are right now, but they're not TERRIBLE.  So I don't think we need to become communist or socialist or a dictatorship (heaven forbid!).  Just a few tweaks.  Homosexuality is wrong.  I don't want it in my church (although I would love homosexuals to be part of my church and faith community, as long as they're non-practicing... it's a fine line, I realize).  And I don't want gay marriage to become the norm.  However, I think that I'm in favor of civil unions.  Just as long as it's not in my church.  Again, a fine line, I realize.  The cycle of poverty needs to be stopped.  This means government support for programs that address homelessness, families without food, minimum-wage, joblessness, etc.  I would love it if communities did this all on their own, if churches started programs to take care of the "downtrodden, fatherless and the widow."  But in the absence of this, I think the government should step up to the plate.  Let's face it.  We're a world power.  We have a higher standard of living than the rest of the world.  So when they ask us for help (or even before they ask for it), we should gladly give it, with as few strings attached as possible.  I'm all for international aid.  Especially when it comes to AIDS.  (If someone runs across a job that involves moving to Africa and hugging and loving on people with AIDS, sign me up.  Send it to me.  I'm on the next plane.  Hasta la vista America.)  The environment is very important to me.  Please don't mess with it.  I'm sorry, Bush, but you haven't done a good job here.  Not even a so-so job.  I realize that you've had this whole war thing to deal with, and I appreciate you taking care of that problem.  This is important too.  Stop pollution, cutting down forests, work on clean water, stopping global warming, proper land management, etc, they're all important to me.  Not so important that I take time off work to protest at the capitol, but still very important.  They do influence the way I vote.  And eat (note: cows are bad.)  Freedom is good.  I like having the freedom to worship, to work where I want to, to say what I want to, and generally be free.  And equal as a woman.  I know other countries don't have this to the same extent we do.  I appreciate it.  This does mean we have to also protect ourselves from those who don't want us or others to have freedom.  But don't spend all the money on our armed forces.  So, that's the basics.  The UN has yet to impress me.  In every world situation I've studied (Rwanda and this recent Iraq for example), they have yet to do anything.  Really.  Action is important, people.  Otherwise, what good are they?  Kofi Annan, I appreciate your commitment to peace and the global perspective you have, and I know that it is much different from my American-media-fed-world-view, but I still think sometimes you've got to get off the shore and into the water.  The Republican party stands for several things that I agree with, namely abortion and homosexuality.  I like the freedom that the Republicans feel to express their religious views right alongside of their political views.  However, they need to stop giving money to the wealthy.  They already have it.  And they can step it up in a lot of other areas.    The Democrats spend money the way I like, on social welfare programs and not the military.  I wish they would spend more time speaking about their faith, because their lack of this makes me think they don't have any.  And I wish they would spend less time criticizing GWBush.  John Kerry - I think I may end up voting for you.  However, your current ad where you talk about the war in Iraq makes you sound stupid.  We should involve the international community?  Don't you think we've tried?  They really don't want to be involved.  It's just a naiive thing to say.  GWBush - if you could change your environmental policies, you'd have me sold.  To all interested parties - I am of legal age to vote, and when I am properly informed, choose to vote.  Any information you'd like to send me that is not political doublespeak or insults to the other party, I will gladly accept.  Listening to: Josh Groban (pitter-patter)

      rarely are lyrics better than I think they are, but here are some  "i'm not a perfect person.  there are many things i wish i didn't do but i continue learning. i never meant to do those things to you. and so i have to say before i go, that i just want you to know  i've found a reason for me to change who i used to be a reason to start over new, and the reason is you  i'm sorry that i hurt, it's something i must live with everyday and all the pain i put you through, i wish that i could take it all away and be the one who catches all your tears, that's why i need you to hear  i'm not a perfect person. i never meant to do those things to you and so i have to say before i go that i just want you to know  i've found a reason for me, to change who i used to be a reason to start over new, and the reason is you i've found a reason to show a side of me you dind't know a reason for all that id o, and the reason is you"  I can think of quite a few people I could say this to.  Mostly guys that I've dated or... been friends with.  And not in a "I'm going to change to get you back" or a "I want you back" sort of a way.  Just... I've learned a lot about myself from others, from the ways that I've treated, from how I've hurt because I hurt them.  It changes the way I go into things now, and sometimes the way I leave things.  For instance,  I dated a guy in the beginning of college, M, who was a really great guy.  As a person, as a friend, he was wonderful.  And terribly romantic, and patient.  He was my second real boyfriend, and it took two weeks of dating (and college dating meant that we got together at least once a day) before he kissed me, and then he was super-cool when I said I didn't want to.  He was so much more into me than I was into him.  And I knew it.  But I liked... being adored, being treated that way.  He'd hold my hand and he'd say nice things and every moment I was with him I felt beautiful and loved.  I didn't love him, though.  I knew it would never work out.  I stayed in the relationship too long, though.  He got hurt, eventually, when I broke it off.  He wasn't in the same relationship I was.  It hurt so much to know that I had put him through all that, needlessly.  So I made myself a promise that from then on, I would only date guys to whom I was atracted.  It sounds like a silly promise, but one that hasn't always been easy.  I had a history of dating guys I wasn't terribly physically attracted to, but they were wonderful people.  This resolve has been tested a few times, too.  There was a time when another friend of mine, M (also, I know, it makes it confusing), who wanted to date me, and I thought long and hard about it because we were best friends and it would have been perfect.   I talked to a friend of mine who was engaged to a guy she was friends with at first, and then they fell in love, and I asked her how that happened.  And she explained it in a way that I don't remember, but I do know that I interpreted it to mean things weren't going to change with the way I felt about M.  On the flip-side, I have been attracted to a lot of guys who haven't wanted to date me.  I haven't asked why (who would?).  This leads me to believe that either 1) those attractions, when they finally happen at the same time, are amazing and those people are so special to have found that, or 2) there's something wrong with me.  I'm choosing to believe 1.  We'll see how I feel about that at 35.  Speaking of flips and flops.  I'm wearing sandals today (ok, they're not technically flip-flops), and they make a lot of noise when I walk, especially stairs.  Does anyone (ladies, I mean) know how to get them to stop flipping (or flopping, if that's the noisy part)?  Listening to: Hoobastank, "The Reason"...  Coming up next: Josh Groban

      I somehow didn't remember that fish ownership was so demanding.  Monster needs to have his water changed like once a week!  But he's feeling much better now that he's got clean water with oxygen in it.  He may have just looked at me and smiled.  Last night in youth group the junior highers thoroughly impressed me - I didn't bring the paper to work that I wrote down what they said, so I'll have to share it later.  Stay tuned.  Volunteering for A's employer's  urlLink charity event  tonight.  Hopefully this means I'll be serving chocolate (I expressed my desire not to serve alcohol, which seems to perhaps have complicated things, but we'll see...).  Apparently the 8:41 is not running.  I know that Metro Transit said when the buses came back (Monday) that no routes had been cut, but seriously, I haven't seen it all week.  I was there today long before 8:41, and yet I got on the 8:54.  Yeah.  Benefits of it being Administrative Professional's Day: free pizza today for lunch, courtesy of the Management Team.  Note to self:  when out getting coffee, DO stop by the vendor in Norwest, who is cute and has a nice slavic accent.  I just got a white rose from a co-worker for being an "Administrative Professional" - also known as Support Staff.  AT least there's one week a year when I feel appreciated for this mindless peon job.  Must finish breakfast before consuming lunch.  Played this exercise with an email friend, and thought I'd share.  Comment back with your answers if you wish.  I'd love to hear your answers too (and know who's reading)...  4 positive words to describe your character -->loyal, gracious, puerile, and priggish (word A & I learned last week) 3 most tragic flaws -->pride/self-esteem, contraryness, fear of people (or just social interaction with strangers) 2 most annoying habits -->sleeping through my alarm clock, being perfectionistic 1 pet peeve. -->I have this neighbor who perpetually parks his truck in a terrible spot in the alley and makes it impossible for anyone else to pass.

      I started a new book last night (after having finished book 2 of Lord of the Rings and being too broke to purchase book 3 right now) by  urlLink Calvin Miller  (see the link for biography information).  The book I'm reading is "A Requiem For Love," which is basically a dramatic, poetic retelling of the creation story.  Here's the part that caught me last night:  [God speaking to man] "... There is nos uch thing as 'giftless' love. The very words accuse each other. My gift to you is love, but Worship is your gift to Me. And Oh, most glorious it is! Worship always calls Me 'Father' and Makes us both rich with a common joy. Worship Me, for only this great gift Can set you free from the killing love of self, And prick your fear with valiant courage To fly in hope through moments of despair. Worship will remind you That no man knows completeness in himself. Worship will teach you to speak your name, When you've forgotten who you are. Worship is duty and privilege, Debt and grand inheritance at once. Worship, therefore, at those midnights When the stars hide. Worship in the storms till love Makes thunder whimper and grow quiet And listen to your whispered hymns. Worship and be free."

      Monster (my work fish, a male beta) is the only fish left.  Bandit passed away on Friday night.  I'm going to let the tank sit empty for a while to hopefully get rid of some toxins or just... let it be.  Had a pretty good weekend, even though I spent way more money than I should have.  Rent was awesome, as was Tanpopo.  On the way to Rent (we parked in the Fields' lot) we stopped in so I could show A the  urlLink ballerina prom dress .  A coworker of mine doesn't like it, but he's 50, so I don't think he counts.  We had a good time at Rent, despite having to sit through the first half next to these annoying middle-aged ladies, and then just being in general freezing cold the whole time.  Saturday morning I went to a meeting and secured a  urlLink community garden plot  for A & myself.  Then I did some cleaning (not much though) and took a trip to buy groceries and some stuff for gardening.  Spent much of the afternoon on the balcony planting, with the cats wandering around the roof.  It was gorgeous out.  I think I could have gotten a nice tan if so inclined.  Then I got my hair cut and stopped by the fabric store since I was out that way.  Got some nice "scrim" to change the draping over my bed - white now instead of blue.  Much better.  My room is still a mess, though, so I don't think you can really tell.  I need to do laundry.  And take a bunch of stuff to Goodwill.  And vacuum.  Kitties shed a lot.  Watched "Miss Congeniality" and ate pizza for dinner.  No, wait, pizza was Sunday lunch.  Saturday night I made potatos and chicken with mushrooms and garlic.  And coleslaw.  Eh, not too great, but not horrible.  Next time, I'll use the right kind of vinegar.  Sunday was spent waking up late (skipping first service and most of Sunday School) and then after church going over to a church lady's house to rake her yard with the youth group.  We had a good time and were done by 1:15.  Stopped by Target, indulged myself with Krispy Kremes which I'd been craving for weeks, and bought light bulbs.  I know, terribly exciting.  Youth group last night went ok, much better than the junior high lesson on the same.  Only six kids though, and all from the same vehicle (most from the same family, plus 2 friends).  It's been a disappointing way to end the year, with declining attendance, especially since at the beginning of the year we were prepared for low attendance with the schedule change.  I did get to watch Crossing Jordan when I got home, despite the storm that blew through here.  Drove very slow on the way home.  But I kept myself company with thoughts of a charming guy and things he said.  [remaining calm]  Work today sucks.  Boring.  Not too much to do.  Just enough that I should be occupied, but they're all crappy projects.  Nothing even remotely fun.  Blah.

Note to those who do not share the same political beliefs as me: you might be surprised what you find has actually happened in my country.  Here's how this works.  You set up a country, and then every day you get a certain number of issues (your preference) to deal with, and then the following day you can see how your decision has affected your country.  It's kinda neat.  I'm just glad I still have an Authoritarian Democracy, and not a Dictatorship or anything like that.  Yeah.

      I mean, I've been here all day, but have yet to do anything that really relates to, well, work.  Probably because the next task I have to do I abhore.  It's awful.  But at least while I spend the next 2 hours doing it, I can intermittently blog.  Yay for you.  So I went and took this quiz yesterday linked from somebody else's blog.  And then it turned out to be an online dating thing.  But it was free, and I was stressed at work, and it was a fairly decent way to de-stress.  And then I found someone who was fairly compatible.  The key definition of "fairly compatible" being "he loves Jesus alot."  So most of you haven't known me when I've had a real-life crush (not these silly celebrity ones I've made up recently), but, well, I tend to get a little crazy.  Go overboard.  And I fall really hard and really fast into "love."  So please feel free to point out, at any time, that I am being IRRATIONAL or STUPID.  I thank you in advance.

       Dear S,   GET OUT OF MY LIFE!  I leave meetings with you, asking God how much longer I have to be at this church.  I get home only to express if I don't harm anyone soon it'll be an act of God.  You are not my boss.  You don't supervise me.  I realize you used to have my job, have more education than me, and have children older than me, but that does not mean you get to tell me what to do.  If you think I'm doing a crappy job, talk to B, or personnel.  By all means,   take   my job.  I really don't care at this point.  Let me fail if I'm doing something wrong.  Don't be so condescending.  I have been doing this for... let's see... nine years!  But have you ever even asked that?  No, you just assume I haven't a clue what I'm doing.  Have I mentioned how many mission trips I've led?  BEFORE even knowing you existed?  Imagine that!  Really, get off my back.  Unless Pastor B has told you to supervise me, which 1) she need to tell me, and 2) is a gross conflict of interests, please don't.  If I want your help, I'll ask for it.  Otherwise, butt out.  Overall, you treat me like a child, demand things that you have no business in, and make me look bad in front of others.  Much of tonight's conversation was plain out of line.  Really.  Shouldn't you know better?  Review your job description.  Does it talk about me or my programs?  It shouldn't .  So stay out!    God,   What's the deal?  How much longer do I have to work at this church?  How can I fix this problem with S?  And why do my fish keep dying?  I don't feel like you want me to leave here.  Stuff is definately NOT RIGHT there, though.  What do you want me to do?  What am I supposed to be learning?  Who am I supposed to be becoming?  I don't see it anymore.  At first, I really needed this place, to be involved in ministry and not married to the church, to be somewhere I could hea.  But now it's unclear.  I love the kids - don't I always? - and I don't feel like I have at other churches when its time to leave.  I can see planning next year and still being involved.  S is driving me crazy.  I can't deal with it anymore.  I probably should have done something before, but things were getting better.  I am so angry with her for tonight: the way she treated me, the things she delved into that weren't her responsibility, the fact that she did so in front of others.  Show me where I'm wrong.  Show me my faults, my flaws, my errors, my sins.  Correct me first.  I have to trust You with this.  I don't know what else to do.  Please.

      Apparently, I'm a b*tch today.  Granted, I am a lot of the time, but... especially today.  Earlier I was on the phone with one of my co-workers who really makes things more complicated than they need to be, and I tried to put it as bluntly as possible how I felt about that.  Without, of course, making her cry.  And I just got off the phone with a co-worker at church and I may have... been a little too b*tchy for that particular venue.  But, darn it, we're not going to be spending money that way!    Let me explain.  First of all, this co-worker and I have a history of disagreements (well, I frequently disagree with her and am generally annoyed by her, as well as the fact that she's ditsy, she also acts condescending towards me.  I realize that she has children older than me, but that doesn't mean I'm a child and need to be treated like one.  She is not my supervisor, either, but tends to act like it from time to time.  Did I mention she used to have my job?).  And the area of finances she was bringing up has a history of being misused.  We run 3 fundraisers a year, and we state that they support YOUTH MISSIONS and/or the YOUTH MISSION TRIP.  In the past, the money from these has accidentally gone into the youth general operating fund, and we've had to correct that error, to remaint true to our advertising.  Also, I understand that there is a history of this happening before I've been at this church, and so it's a minorly touchy subject.  Well, we've got a mission trip this summer; we're taking 9 youth and 3 adults to Georgia with YouthWorks! Inc.  It's in the vicinity of $250/person PLUS transportation to and from (and we're in Minnesota here, so, that's significant).  At least one of the students is getting a full scholarship, and we're paying for the adults as well (because if they're taking time off of work/life, they shouldn't have to pay for it).  Then add in if we're doing anything fun post-trip on the return, or getting t-shirts or anything, and you've got some expenses.  Our mission fund isn't that big, so the kids are going to have to be paying for part of their expenses themselves.  We've done a thing this year where if they work at the fundraisers, they get to earn a share of the profits.  Now, some people think that this OTHER youth trip that's being taken (with the whole denomination, not just our church) should get some of those funds.  Oh no, not true my friends.  This trip is not mission or service related at all.  Now, I fully support our youth going on this trip, and it's expensive and they should be able to do some fundraising and/or get some sort of scholarships from somewhere.  But not the youth mission fund!  We've got other accounts.  We can do other fundraisers.  Some people just don't get this.  And now this co-worker of mine is one of those people, and she has also taken it upon herself to demand a full budget reporting (especially in regards to this mission trip) for tonight's committee meeting (of which she is NOT the chair, and, oh yeah, she's not my boss).  To that I say, BITE ME!  She called today to ask if I was going to have all the information available, and I said no, I wouldn't, and she said that it was important and we had discussions to have, and I said that all the information that we would need to be able to have that conversation we would have.  I think this may have confused her, but it was true.  I don't have a budget with specifics.  But that won't be necessary in order to determine what money will be spent on other youth activities.  On top of that, everything else is annoying me today, too.  Other annoying coworkers, annoying computer programs, people making demands on me that are unreasonable or not taking into account my being in the middle of several other projects, etc.  WORK SUCKS.  On the plus side, my bank account is no longer in the red.  It now has 22 cents in it.  Yay!  Payday is Friday.....  :-)  Soundtrack to Life: "Cold Mountain" soundtrack (it kinda sucks though, but it's burned from a co-worker.  I may have to destroy it.  Eck.)

      Didn't exactly blog like I thought I would.  Sorry.  The guys came and fixed my computer and didn't even yell at me too much, so that's good.  I still have a mini-headache, despite taking 2 Aleve (my headband is too small today, and pushing right into that part of my head that gives me headaches).  I'm pretty caught up on work right now, so... any fun ways to pass the time this week would be appreciated.  Oh, I have minorly solved part of the cash flow problem - teach a piano lesson on Wednesday.  There's an easy $20.  I only have to make it until Friday morning.

      I've killed my computer.  Not all of it (obviously the internet still works), just basically anything having to do with Microsoft Office.  It's my fault.  See, it's my work computer, which is fairly nice and new, with Office XP installed on it.  The only problem was that I wanted to be able to use Microsoft Publisher, so I installed it from the Microsoft 2000 CDs I had.  The thing is, when I did that, I foolishly installed ALL of Microsoft 2000.  Today I thought I'd try to solve my problem by un-installing all of Microsoft 2000 except for Publisher.  Bad news.  There is no more Office XP either.  It keeps asking for CDs (which they only have upstairs on 3rd floor with the tech people).  So, basically, I can't DO anything with my computer.  Well, not entirely.  I can make updates to the web pages and I can surf the net.  All in all, not a terribly bad way to spend the next three hours, but not the best way, either.  At least I'm not too far behind in my work that losing 3 hours will kill me this week.  Now, how to explain this all to tech....  They love me up there, you know.  :-)  There's sure to be more posting today.

      Muffin died this weekend.  Flushed her down the toilet on Saturday.  As goldfish go, she was with us such a short time.  3 days.  C'est la vie, n'est-ce pas?  Not even a picture to memorialize her. However, one of the little girls at church had a dolly with her on Sunday morning that didn't have a name, and she may now be named Muffin.  That's at least something.  Good news though... Monster lived through the weekend!  He's actually doing quite well.  For a Betta fish, I'm sure that I worry about him too much.  He needs some more water.  I should do that.  He's such a handsome fish.  And good quality entertainment, especially on days where no one is at work and/or I have nothing to do.

      I read  urlLink this article  today about the anniversary of the Rwandan genocide.  Here are the two things that struck me:  1) 28,000 people were present at the ceremony in Kigali.  Over 800,000 were murdered.  That means that for each person at the ceremony, nearly 29 people were killed.  Those present represented 3.5% of the total murdered.  Disgusting doesn't even seem to start to describe it.  2) This statement, "Scholars concluded that the killers -- mostly civilians spurred on by hate propaganda -- did their work five times faster than gas chambers used by the Nazis in World War II."  Have we learned nothing?  Haven't we as a species improved at all?  The answer continually seems to be no.  I think about ALL the stories of human history, and we don't seem to learn anything from any of it.  Vietnam?  Cambodia?  Rwanda?  Germany?  And now maybe the Sudan?  Sometimes it seems like....  I don't know.  I've lost the words.

      This song is by  urlLink Pink , and will be used as the theme for our upcoming (and final of the school year) unit in youth group.  Daddy was a soldier he taught me about freedom  Peace and all the great things that we take advantage of  Once I fed the homeless I'll never forget  The look upon their faces as I treated them with respect   This is my Vietnam  I'm at war  Life keeps on dropping bombs  And I keep score   Momma was a lunatic she liked to push my buttons She said I wasn't good enough but I guess I wasn't trying  Never liked school that much they tried to teach me better  But I just wasn't hearing it because I thought I was already pretty clever   This is my Vietnam  I'm at war  Life keeps on dropping bombs  And I keep score   This is my Vietnam  I'm at war  They keep on dropping bombs  And I keep score   What do you expect from me?  What am I not giving you?  What could I do for you to make me OK in your eyes?   This is my Vietnam  I'm at war  They keep on dropping bombs  And I keep score   This is my Vietnam  I'm at war  Life keeps on dropping bombs  And I keep score   This is my Vietnam   This is my Vietnam    So, what does this spark for you?  What are your "Vietnams," the things that keep you at war?  Please comment!

       urlLink the friday five :   1. What do you do for a living? For a living?  Well, to pay my bills, I work for the State of Minnesota in the Department of Employment and Economic Development in the Rehabilitation Services branch, downtown St Paul, as "Support Staff," which is supposed to mean that I'm a mindless peon who types and files, but in actuality I'm much more computer-literate than all of my coworkers, so I do website stuff and computer training and fix people's computer problems and generally are the Queen of All That Is Computer-Related.  To keep me sane (and to keep me happy, doing what I was meant to do but doesn't always pay the bills), I work with teenagers at a church in the suburbs.  2. What do you like most about your job? I like the freedom I have, the chance to "fix" people's problems.  Sometimes I like the people (but not often).  3. What do you like least about your job? Stupid people.  Church politics.  Take your pick.  4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because _____... Stupid people.  A lot of the time, people ask me for help on things I know nothing about but they think I should.  I actually have a sign up at work that says, "I am not omniscient," because people are surprised when I can't tell them the answer, even though I've told them time and time again I know nothing about xyz.  5. What other career(s) are you interested in? I'm looking to move towards social work and out of church work, although I greatly enjoy working at a church.  The problem is that I love Minnesota but I really don't like the churches here, especially the ones that are hiring, of which there are very few.  I think that with a social work agency, I would still be able to do things that I enjoy (talking with and counseling teens), and not have to deal so much with the other stuff.  Then, too, I could go to any church I wanted to, and volunteer my time (youth group, Sunday School teacher, worship committee, whatever I feel like, or just be a "regular" member and sit in the pew).

      Look at the picture on  urlLink this page .  How can you not be moved when people do things like this?  A, by the way, self-immolation is a Buddhist practice that, perhaps, you don't want to involve yourself in.  Just a comment after recent discussions about buddhism.  I've been studying Vietnam and Rwanda lately.  I know, depressing topics.  Rwanda just because it was recently the 10-year anniversary of the genocide there.  Over 800,000 people killed in 100 days.  Amazing.  Horrifying.   urlLink PBS  has some nice video clips you can watch.  Vietnam because we're going to start a series in youth group next week, to finish out the year, called "My Vietnam" based on the song by Pink.  I think we're going to talk about things that make us feel like we're at war with ourselves, or things that give us great internal conflict.  But I'm not sure yet.  All I know is that I need to know more about Vietnam.  I've watched some movies, read timelines and histories.  I might need to spend some time on Saturday at the library.  I wonder if they're open the day before Easter?  Sorry if all of this is depressing.  I'll post Pink's lyrics later.

      I got fish last night!  Lots of 'em.  (Ok, 5, but that's a whole chunk as far as I'm concerned, more than a handful.)  I got a Male Betta to bring to work - eventually he's going to live with a hydroponically grown flower of some sort.  I'm leaning towards a Calla Lily, but haven't yet found out if they can live with Bettas and/or be grown hydroponically.  Oh, his name is Monster.  He has been moved to his new container (instead of the one he came in) and now his color has returned (he's red with some blue markings on his upper fin) and he's swimming about quite happily.  At home, I got a 10-gallon fish tank (for the same price as the 5-gallon one!) and four goldfish-type fish.  The black one's name is Smoky, the largest (2-3 inches!) is Bear, and then there are two multi-colored ones that are Bandit and Muffin.  I have some great pictures of the cats (especially Matea) trying to get at the fish and generally being cute.  When I get my film developed....  The drama last night went really well - the kids did an excellent job, nobody forgot their lines, costumes looked great, nobody threw up, and everyone really liked it.  Pastor B even made a mention at the end that I was the one who wrote it, and everyone afterwards gave me great commendations.  I could seriously use some moolah right now.  I probably shouldn't have bought the fish.  I forgot that I needed to get my prescriptions refilled....  oops.  Yeah, so....  I don't know.  I've really got to learn to be better with money.  I have made vast improvements.  No overdraft charges in, like, 3 months!  That's real progress for me.  And yesterday I remembered to get the oil changed in my car.  Good for me.  Of course, I need to get the tire patched so I'm no longer driving on the donut, but that costs money too.  Soy estupido a veces!

      I was all excited about the beautiful Easter flowers I ordered at church.  An Easter Lily and Cyclamen, to be exact.        Now I find out that, along with the Calla Lily that I'd like to try to grow, they are poisonous to house pets.  Must find a way to keep Romeo and Matea (pictures soon to be up) from eating (and consequently dying) new plants.  Hmmmm.  Any thoughts?

      I borrowed this idea from  urlLink Mikao's World    FIRSTS   First job: I had a paper route in junior high, one of those local papers that people don't even pay for but got every Thursday First screen name: redcleo First funeral: My grandpa (mom's dad) died when I was 7. First pet: My parents had a cat named Fritz when I was born.  He hated everyone but my dad.  We also had fish.  Then we got Alexander, who was the best cat ever (sorry Romeo and Matea and Dallas and Montgomery and Shadow and Midnight and Stripes and Bootsie, but it's true!) First piercing/tattoo: Ears pierced for my 10th birthday.  It was my dad's idea. First kiss: I have the memory of kissing Doug Brock-Jones in 4th or 5th grade, but he denies it, and it was so long ago, who cares? First one that mattered: Michael Barclay, freshman year of college.  It told me, unfortunately, that we had to break up. First love: I fall in love easily.  But real love?  I know that I was really in love with Jason. First enemy: My former best-friend Lindsay in fifth grade.  She made the rest of the year hellish. First big trip: We went camping all the time, so I don't know.  We went to Toronto when I was in junior high, and when I was in high school I saw the ocean for the first time.  Those were big. First concert: Sad to say, but Carmen.  Ewww. First musician you remember hearing in your house: Amy Grant   LASTS   Last car ride: Home from church on Sunday night Last kiss: Romeo, my cat, this morning Last library book checked out: Yeah, they don't let me check out books anymore.... Something about overdue fines.... Last movie watched: Under the Tuscasn Sun  Last beverage drank: Toffee Nut Frappuccino (Cream, not Coffee, even though I requested the Coffee version - sad, decaffinated me) Last food consumed: Salmon-flavored frosted-strawberry Poptarts (cuz, when you use the toaster oven to make salmon, even 2 days ago, the poptarts you put in it this morning will come out smelling, and tasting, like salmon, but it wasn't as bad as you'd think, as long as you like salmon)

      I'm losing my mind here.  WAAAAAAAAAYYYY too much work.  For multiple jobs.  All at the same time.  By me.  I cannot do this much.  So why am I blogging?  It seems that no matter what I do, it will be wrong, so why not vaguely enjoy myself while being wrong?  Yeah, I know, the logic.....  Really, though, this job is stressful this week.  And big stuff going on at church, too, and I don't have any time to do it in.  Can someone find me an extra 6-12 hours?  Thanks!

      Not that it wasn't enjoyable, but it was, indeed, long.  A & I took Friday off to do laundry and prepare the place for guests.  This involved installing shelves - unfortunately, Ace was out of some of the basic elements, so our shelving units are only half completed.  I did purchase a lovely power drill and install all the standards.  Everything looks much nicer than it did before.  Now if only the kitchen could be improved somehow....  A's friend D showed up around 3, and then my mom came into town around 6:30.  We walked over to  urlLink Barbary Fig , a great Mediterranean restaurant being featured on the Food Network this weekend supposedly.  A & D & E (bad boy!) were out when we got back, but they came home only slightly soused.  Something, we're not sure what, happend between A & E when she walked him out, but you'll have to see if you can pry the details out of  urlLink her .  Saturday morning A made pecan pancakes for all of us (D and my mom spent the night; I had a very sleepless night in a sleeping bag on the hardwood floor, emphasis on hard, in the living room, getting pounced upon by cats).  My mom and I went for a lovely walk down Summit and I pointed out all the buildings downtown that I've talked about or go to, and then we toured the  urlLink Cathedral of St Paul , and then we walked home.  She had to leave to make it to my sister's friend's wedding, so off she was after lunch.  I spent the afternoon buying crap at  urlLink Target  (spending an ungodly amount of money) and getting a headache, and then trying to sleep it off while watching  urlLink You've Got Mail  (warning, their site has an annoying popup wanting you to download something - don't).  It is one of my favorites.  A & D woke me up just in time to catch the very ending.  :-)  We went to  urlLink Tanpopo  for dinner and, while we had to wait for almost 40 minutes, had  excellent  Japanese food.  Got home and set all the clocks ahead for  urlLink Daylight Savings , which always annoys me this time of year, but I'm thankful for in the fall.  I had to be at church early on Sunday, so I said "goodnight" and then proceeded to read long into the night, defeating the entire practice of closing my door and not watching the  urlLink movie .  Needless to say I was very tired and got to church a little late, but not too late.  Church was busy, full, blah blah blah usual stuff.  Stopped at Target (again, I know!) on the way home, bought more crap, this time including some plants and a miniature bonsai tree, and then stopped at  urlLink Frank's Nursery  to get a start on my vegetable garden.  This summer we'll be eating, hopefully, carrots, sweet peppers, lettuce, cucumbers, beans, and artichokes.  I really wanted carrots last year, but by the time we were ready to buy seeds, there were none to be found.  I also started some lavendar, rosemary, cilantro, and catnip.  It was a very enjoyable afternoon, sitting on the balcony in the sun with my hands in dirt.  Youth group went really well.  I only had 3 kids come, and had no volunteers (my fault though), and the candle didn't turn out so I have to re-craft it tonight, but the lesson part was really... invigorating.  We were talking about blood - earlier in Lent we had discussed sin, but it was an "unresolved issue."  There were so many things to discuss, and the kids just kept asking questions and trying to understand it all.  We delved into animal sacrifice, the reliability of the Scriptures, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Abraham almost sacrificing Isaac, Jesus's act of sacrificial offering for our sins, and so much more.  They just kept asking questions, and they really wanted to know the answers!  It made me feel good, because not only did they walk away with some understanding, but I was glad to know most of the answers.  I'm feeling wordy today because A was in a... less than talkative mood when I got home because of a crappy day with her family, and I totally understand that.  Apparently we're no longer having her family over for Easter; instead they're going to a restaurant.  Oh well, it could have been fun, but could have been a disaster, too.  Her family's... crazy.  Or at least... a little messed up.  And then today.  Just work so far.  Boring boring.  Hopefully I'll fix the candle tonight.  It'd be nice to get the rest of the stuff for our shelves, too, but that's all dependent upon  urlLink Ace .  Listening to: Nothing

      I was having such a good dream this morning, until a wrong phone number (the message sounded kinda like a fax machine) at 6:30 woke me out of my slumber.  Alas, I tried to climb back into the dream, but it was gone.  It was actually about being kinda snuggly with a boy (don't let your thoughts go to the gutter, here, it was a perfectly PG dream), one that I know, and he looked like him!  That never happens.  But it was his face and everything.  Oh....  Upon falling back asleep (and staying in bed past the time I should have already been at work), I had more stressful dreams, like about having conflict-resolution conversations and getting ready for the day and the drama that's coming up next week.  Then Romeo decided to lick my right ear (it was the one sticking out of the covers, since I was trying to hide from the blinding sun).  A lot.  I think he pretty much cleaned it out.  EWWWWWW.  At least he's a cat.  Matea (the other cat) insisted on showing her belly to the world while stretching on the table in a sun-spot.  Perhaps she was trying to worship the sun goddess (or whatever kitties feel inclined to be religious towards).  It was so cute I almost didn't get to work.  But I'm here.  Mostly because I had a great April Fool's Day prank to play on one of my coworkers (pictures will be up when available) and I was supposed to teach a class this afternoon.  The class was cancelled, but the prank was excellent.  D almost lost his temper, I think.  It involved four boxes of multicolored  urlLink Peeps , a  urlLink coloring book , and a  urlLink My Little Pony  "Happy Birthday" banner.  Did I mention that the coworker on whom I played this little gag is a 50-year-old man?  With a scraggly pony-tail, unmarried, always wears black and white, and works as an accountant?  Oh yes, it was fun.  Many people since have said "Happy Birthday" to him, despite the fact that it was in February.  Hehe.  I realize that at some point in the near future this is going to come back to haunt me.  Hopefully it happens on a day I'm in a good mood, so I can take it in stride.

      We started our trip at 10 pm on Wednesday night.  It was raining.  We stopped sometime on Thursday and had a picnic.   We arrived very late on Thursday night.  We stayed in the dorms at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.   We were very tired.   We slept in late on Friday, tooled around town, and then I went to the Rehearsal Dinner while A ate out.  Saturday I went to Sarah & Chuck's wedding.  It was very beautiful.  I read Ephesians 3:14-21.  At the reception, there was a dance, but I don't like to, so I sat out.   The centerpieces were made up of flags from all the countries the couple had been to.  I claimed Sweden.   Saturday evening, some of Sarah's friends and I cleaned their new apartment.  Sarah had just moved in the week before, and the craziness of a wedding had quickly taken over the small space.  I was glad to help.   Sunday, A & I went to Boston.  We slept in again, so we really didn't spend that much time there.  We did see some cool historical things, like the USS Constitution   Then we drove up the coast and visited Gloucester.  There was a nice memorial to those who had died at sea,   some birds,   and the ocean (Atlantic).   Notably, we touched the ocean,   found a lobster trap,   and saw this store that made us giggle.   Monday we started our long trip home.  This is what most of the trip looked like.   We stopped by Niagara falls, but didn't get out of the car.     We also stopped in Erie, Pennsylvania, to see Lake Erie   and this statue.   We spent the night in a Motel 6 in Toledo, Ohio (don't recommend that particular one), and continued the drive Tuesday.  We stopped in Gary, Indiana (Shh!  Don't tell A's dad)   and at my mom's house to pick up an air conditioner.   There was a knight in shining armor waiting for us at a gas station,   but he ran away when I got pulled over for speeding.   Finally, home again!   Kitty feet!

      I just stopped by the photo place, a bit early, but just in case my pictures were ready.  They're not.  Instead of being ready by 11, now they probably won't be ready until 12.  So, I'll pick them up before 1 and get to posting them for you (and me).  Whatcha thinking about today?

      We're back from Boston, and boy are we tired!  I don't recommend driving to Boston from Minnesota.  Really.  Pictures will be up tomorrow afternoon, but until then I thought I'd leave you with some pictures I snagged off the web of things we did or saw but  didn't  get pictures of.  We stayed at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, home of my good friend Sarah (the bride), and also some others (read more tomorrow).       On Saturday while I was at the wedding, A went to Fenway Park to see a Red Sox game.   Sunday we both went into the city of Boston   and did some sight-seeing.  We found the Granary Cemetery,   looked across the water at the USS Constitution,   and ate calamari at an interesting Italian place (actually just down the street from these)   where we heard the funniest things.  None was as good as the tshirt shop down the street, where the owner (in a thick, Italian-Boston accent) said to another guy, "yeh, well, he owes me a favah."  Really?  Straight out of the Godfather.  Or... something.

      I can't believe the day has gone by so fast!  I am working a half day tomorrow, and then I'm computer-less until next Thursday!  A and I leave for Boston tomorrow night after youth group.  The 20-something hour drive should end soemtime Thursday evening.  Friday is unscheduled until evening, when I need to be at  urlLink Sarah & Chuck's  rehearsal dinner, and then Saturday is the wedding itself.  But, the wedding's at 10, followed by a luncheon and dance.  So, I think I'll be free by dinner (especially since they're not serving a dinner).  A's not going with me to either event, and has plans to see a game at  urlLink Fenway Park  Saturday night.  Sunday and Monday are unscheduled, but we need to start the drive home by Monday afternoon, so that we can be home by Tuesday night and go to work on Wednesday.  Are you tired?  I am, just reading that description.  But it should be a blast.  Oh, and I'm without a computer that Wednesday because I have to be at a stupid meeting for work.  Bah.  Fun pics of Boston and the wedding are promised when I return.  A's got plans for a pink flamingo....

      I got this article off of  urlLink The Ooze , and it was originally posted on  urlLink The Next Wave , a website that I haven't had much time to explore, but will try to in the next few days.  The author also has her own  urlLink blog , where she talks about  urlLink reaction  to this article.  I must admit I was taken aback by this article.  But only because the church I work in currently has the following staff:  Senior Pastor: female Associate Pastor: search committee, vacant for over a year CE Director: female Youth Director: (self) female Office Staff: female, female Organist: female Choir Director: male Janitor: male  So, yeah, I haven't really "felt" the reality of her article lately.  But that doesn't mean it's not true.  And some of the things she refers to are...  urlLink abhorrible .  The part where women aren't supposed to be emotional, especially.  And here's the strange thing about working in my church.  Last week, I had a... painful conversation with our CE Director about homosexuality (she thinks its ok, I don't).  One of the things she brought up in that conversation (when we moved more to the postmodern mindset stuff) was that she believes the reason we are moving away from the logical/rational/modern mindset to the postmodern/emotional/feeling mindset is because men aren't in the church anymore and women are.  Um..... WHAT?  No, I'm sorry, but... just NO.  There's more in this article, but I don't want to offend too much.  Or confuse.  Because, to be honest, my ideas and perspective on "women in ministry" is not clear and paradoxical.  But I'd like to know what you think.  Read the article.  Get back to me.

      Courtesy of the Star Tribune, this article was published yesterday.  I want to put something "out there" on the record.  I am a firm proponent of ABSTINENCE.  I myself have been practicing it for going on 26 years now.  It works (no STDs, no unplanned pregnancies).  Why have I chosen to be abstinent?  Mainly because I believe that it's what God wants (check out His book - The Bible).  I made a promise in junior high that I would remain celibate until my wedding night, and I intend to keep it, even if I never marry.  However, that doesn't mean I'm in favor of abstinence-only teaching.  I think that abstinence should be offered up as the ONLY SAFE SEX.  But I also think that youth should be taught how to prevent STDs, pregnancy, etc.  I also think they should be taught the consequences of having sex before you're ready.  I think that parent-teen dialogs should be open enough to share thoughts on the matter.  If I had kids, I would say to them, "I don't want you having sex.  But if you do, use a condom."  I don't think that teaching kids to practice SAFER sex (because abstinence really is the ONLY SAFE SEX - I did a report on this in college) means you're telling them it's ok to do it.  It just means you value their life over their sometimes wrong choices.  That's all I have to say on the matter.  I am wondering what you think....

         A & I did Race for the Cure on Sunday.  We invited both of our moms (it being Mother's Day and all), and so hers joined us.  (My mom is a seven hour drive away, and had just been here the month before, so no blame there on her not wanting to come up.)  We actually did the Walk, not the Run.       I just got our shirts last night (picking them up prior to the event was a minor fiasco), and so I'm prompted to write about all the people I know suffering from Breast Cancer.  My dad's mom, Lois, died in May, 1978, a month before I was born.  I don't know much about her, except that she was a schoolteacher for a long time, and was deeply loved by all she left behind.  My dad's sister, Shirley, has had treatment over the past couple of years.  I'm not sure if she got a double masectomy or what went on - things are a little unclear.  She is in good health, though.  My dad's wife, Candy, is in stage 4.  That's supposed to mean no cure.  The cancer has spread to some spots on her pelvic bone and spine.  She believes she will be cured.  Some of us are less optimistic.  My dad has, obviously, suffered a great deal from Breast Cancer, being that so many women whom he loves have been affected with it.  A friend of mine from high school/church, her mom has Breast Cancer.  She was diagnosed probably close to 10 years ago, and I haven't heard an update lately.  She was doing really well for a long time, though.  My cousin's wife, Natasha, was diagnosed last fall.  She stayed home from the family Christmas party (she was in the middle of chemo), and I played with their daughter, Zoey, for a long time.  So cute.  Apparently, Natasha had to go on fertility drugs to get pregnant, and they're what caused the cancer, so Zoey (age 1 1/2 at Christmas) will be their only child.  And lastly, the reason why we did Race for the Cure, one of my youth group families, the mom had Breast Cancer some time before I started working there.  She invited us to race on her team.  So if you ever need to think about someone who's been affected... look no further.  I know enough for several people.  Rockin' out to: nothing (blessed silence!)

      In the list of things I wonder about comes colleges, and how my life would have been different, had I chosen a different one.  The strange thing about playing the "what if" game is that I'm very happy I went to the school I did - I think it was the right one for me, and I benefited greatly by being  urlLink there .  Here, however, is a brief list of other schools I almost went to.   urlLink University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana  (what would I have studied?  and everyone else from my high school went there.  way to get away from it all.)  urlLink Illinois State in Bloomington/Normal  (yeah, um, no.)  urlLink Gustavus-Adolphus  (Summer Crush went there, A almost went there.  small world.)  urlLink Macalaster  (about a mile from where I currently live.  very strange.)

       urlLink TV Tuesday :  1. What show would you like to see brought back for an hour or two episode, to see how the characters are doing now? (This should be a show that it might be possible to do a reunion on.)   Ally McBeal.  I really miss that show.  But it ended really well, so it'd be hard to bring it back.  They did a good job with closure.   2. Pick a show that could not realistically be brought back for a reunion, because some or all of the cast members are gone. What if they could have done a reunion before it was too late? Name the show you'd most like to see.   I can't think of anything.   3. Which reunion show have you watched and thought 'Wow, they should have left that one alone!'   I don't think I've ever enjoyed one.  I like the spoofs, like the Brady Bunch movie - those are worth making.  But the reunions?  Eh.   ~Bonus~ Which do you prefer- a 'reunion' episode of the series, or a 'cast reunion' where the actors sit around and talk about the making of the show?   Reunion episode, even though they're always disappointing.  I'd rather be disappointed with bad writing and acting and storylines than with loser actors who wish they were still in the glorydays.

      Today, along with  urlLink Blogger  re-creating itself, I have decided to as well.  A few weeks ago I bought a bookmark that said, "Wonder is the beginning of wisdom."  Socrates said it, and he was definitely wiser than I am (although I am finally learning how to spell "definitely." So I've decided to try to focus my thoughts in this way, at least for a while.  And as far as old thoughts go... I did write a post this weekend, but it won't go up until tomorrow.  It'll be good. I saw the  urlLink parrot man  in the skyway again today, only he had a red shirt on, short shorts, and, surprisingly, no parrot.   I wonder  where the parrot went?

      Well, I have a new crush.  A & I went to a party tonight hosted by a friend of hers (a forner co-worker).  I had had a tiny crush on him before, until we found out he was about to propose to his girlfriend.  A few months pass by, and now he's broken up with her instead.  This party we went to, we were almost the only females there, and definitely the only single ones (although A would argue that none of the guys were single).  He did talk about "bachelor life" and throwing the party to "pick up girls," but all in jest.  Or, mostly in jest.  He touched my arm at one point.  Yeah.  The thing is that I already know him, who he is, what he stands for, what he believes in.  He's real.  Sure, I don't know much about him, but every interaction I've ever had with him has been... real.  Why do I bring this up?  I have the tendency to read into things, to build them up to what they're not, and I did this with my last crush.  It was all email, and when we met in person. I just didn't feel a connection.  And I promised myself not to date anyone else without some "chemistry" on my part.  I either feel it or I don't - I can't make it up, or pretend, or ignore.  I haven't gotten physically involved with any of my boyfriends because I didn't feel it (or the very few to whom I was attracted obviously weren't with me, or they didn't try anything).  I never understand all the times I see on TV or movies when people are making out (or more, use your imagination) even if they don't like the person, of just because they need to get it on.  I can't do that - I'm not like that.  Maybe I think too much; I've always been super-aware when a guy's been going in for the kiss (or whatever) and it always freaks me out.  My mind races and I'm totally not calm and not in a good way.  I don't think it's supposed to be like that.  So my old crush, I just didn't feel it.  And I don't know how he feels or what he thinks is going on.  I'm trying not to lead him on, but I also don't want to jump the boat if there's no need to.  Maybe he just wants to be friends.  New crush I'm going to name SC, for Summer Crush.  I don't think anyone else gets to know his initials yet.  Well, A will figure it out, but that's it.  He's rebounding right now, or at least that's what I'm supposed to remind myself.  Gosh darn it, though.  He feels very strongly about politics, and I'm pretty sure at first look we don't agree on much.  But a lot of my political ideas are... moldable.  Yes, some are written in stone, but for the most part I'm uninformed.  And while here in Minnesota I call myself conservative, I'm much more liberal than I let on, or than I think I am.  Being here has made me cling tighter to my conservative roots - more so than I actually believe in.  I guess I'm saying that it's not really all real, my feelings of being conservative, and that I'm open for discussion in a lot of ways.  I should get some sleep.  Pleasant dreams of Summer Crush....

      First of all, I highly doubt that anyone is out there reading.  The only time the counter changes is when I visit the page to check the counter.  Hah.  I am a blog-loser.  Secondly, I have no internet access at home.  Heck, I don't even have a computer at home (well, a working one.  I have two in the basement in storage somewhere, but they're not worth the plastic they're encased in).  So weekends are a no-blog-zone.  Thirdly, my church paid for me to go to this training conference on Post-Modern Ministry, so I was at that Monday and Tuesday.  Lastly, yesterday I just didn't feel like it.  And there wasn't much to say.  I mean, there's thoughts running around in my head, but not much worth sharing.  But today, as a spark to my blogging flame, there was a sight worth mentioning..  I was walking through the skyway and saw, for the second time, this... man.  Middle aged, yellow muscle shirt, very short cutoff jean shorts, and... (here's the kicker) a parrot on his shoulder.  That's right.  Just walking around as if this is normal.  Bleached blond hair.  Yellow parrot (kinda matched the shirt, I guess).  I mentioned this to a coworker, and he said that even when this person doesn't have the above outfit on, and is dressed normally, he's still got the parrot, and is still kinda freaky.  Man, there are a lot of weirdos out there.  And, men, short shorts are so not allowed anymore.  They shouldn't have been in the first place.  If you're gonna wear them, you better be flaming (cause I'm going to think you are anyway) or it should be Halloween.  More work on the CD.... any suggestions?

      I'm finally catching up on sleep from my trip to Savannah!  I haven't felt like blogging since I've been back (relax, it's only been since Saturday night, and I only have a computer at work), but thought I owed my non-existent public an excuse and at least one post before I leave again.   That's right, I'm leaving again.  Tomorrow I head down to Peotone, Illinois, for Betsy's wedding.  I'll be back next Wednesday though.  The last trip was good.  Unfortunately, all the pictures I'd uploaded in the week before I left... mysteriously left my server.  I've had time to fix some of them, but not all of them, so you'll just have to suffer.  Sorry.  Maybe A will guest blog while I'm gone, maybe not.  We've both been pretty busy.  She's got some family stuff going on too, and a lot of trips away on weekends for the rest of the summer.

      So, here I am.  The infamous "A".  If you haven't figured it out yet, that stands for Amanda.  Not much to say about me.  Maybe just a little blogger illiterate.  Kell typed all of these draft posts (one for each day) and told me, if nothing else, I should post those...well, no can do.  Can't figure that out to save my life.  So I guess that means I have to tell you a funny story or something....hmm... Well, there's always my terrible hatred of geese.  Canadian ones, specifically.  They are terrible animals.  Hereafter, they will be referred to as "devilbirds", because really, they are.  Case in point: Last night I had just dropped a 13 year old girl off at her home when I got lost on my way out of her maze-like subdivision.  I finally figured out I was going the wrong direction (and knew which direction was the correct one), so I pulled into the parking lot of this classy office building (with a pond out front, notorious for attracting the aforementioned devilbirds) to turn around.  On the way out, the sun was glaring in my eyes.  I hear a "Thud!"  Loud profanities leave my mouth.  I put the car in park, get out, and sure enough, there was a devilbird lying on the ground in front of my car.  More profanity.  I hate the birds, but don't get me wrong, I don't want them to DIE!  So, I approach the bird to check for vital signs, when the little @#$%!& flapped up to its feet and came running at me hissing!!

      Last fall I went home for my  urlLink college 's 40th Birthday / Homecoming.  It was only my 3rd year since graduating, so I didn't expect a great turnout from my class.  However, I did expect there to be a fairly large turnout for the birthday celebration part.  It was rather disappointing.  Still, we had some fun.     We had hoped to revive "Female Flag Football," a game played while in school between the majors or that last year, just within the youth ministry major.  It just didn't get organized in time.  Here are some pics, however, of me and my friends with a football....  Kate and me   Kate and Amy   Amy and me, watching the soccer game

      Ok, so I'm a geek, and I readily admit that.  Today, in an effort to get ready for my week-long absence from work, and in light of the fact that three days after I get back our new website goes live, I had quite a few web changes to make.  Most of them involved emailing someone else and telling them to make the changes (due to permissions on the servers, etc), but some of them involved creating new pages and brochures and getting those ready.    So, I'm done now.  We have two pages left that we need to get the information for before we can get those out.  I'm not really critical here, but people seem to think so.  When I get a new job, they'll be amazed at the things they thought they could not do, but can.  I'll give you a link to the  urlLink old site , since it will be disappearing July 1st, in case you want to see my handiwork (it sucks, I know, but we have NO freedom with design in the old setup).  You won't be interested in any of it unless you really care about people with disabilities and them having jobs.  But there it is.  Oh, and I've started to peel from my sunburn.  One shoulder (the left, in case you were wondering).  That's it.  I'm officially a mutant.  Or at least a freak.

      I've been pretty busy at work here the past few days.  We leave on our  urlLink mission trip  to  urlLink Savannah, Georgia , tomorrow morning at 7 am.  This has meant a lot of extra work to get ready for the trip, and also to take care of things for while I'll be gone.  Double-duty, instead of half-duty, like it sometimes feels here.  Sorry about the lack of posting.  I've asked A to guest-blog for me while I'm gone, but I don't know if she will or not.  Tune in to find out!    My major sunburn from last weekend still hasn't peeled.  I'm afraid that it will start tomorrow around 8:00, just in time for a two-day van ride.  Yeah.  According to the  urlLink Today show , Georgia's weather is "oppressive," in terms of heat and humidity.  Yay.  I am excited about our trip, especially since our site director sounds really great, and we'll hopefully come out on top financially, since one of the other groups was able to find a student to take our open spot.  Plus,  urlLink gas prices  have gone down, and I planned to spend around $2.15/gallon, and that isn't the case anymore.  This makes me feel not so bad about buying those  urlLink Starbucks  gift cards for the site staff.  I've got my letter all ready to send to  urlLink Wisconsin  in contest of my speeding ticket.  I also mailed out a  urlLink Father's Day  card to my grandpa today.  Unfortunately, I made an error on the one for my dad, and can't fix it until I get home, so his will be arriving late.  (OK, major funny, because I wrote "I love you, grandpa" on the card for my dad.  Now, what would you think?  Yay, my daughter is pregnant out of wedlock!  Probably not the message I wanted to send.) He needs an up-to-date picture of me anyways (last time I saw him he was carrying around my high school graduation photo that's eight years old).

      Stealing this from  urlLink someone else's blog , who stole it from a friend...  A - Act your age? I prefer to think not.  As I  turn [gasp!]26 next week (thank goodness I'll be gone and no one will know), I like to think that age means nothing (but if it didn't, why would I care if anyone knew my age?).  I also like to think that sometimes I act like a goofy teenager (or younger), and sometimes I act wise beyond my years.  That's probably just wishful thinking.  No one's ever said to me, you have an old soul.    B - Born on what day of the week? Saturday  C - Chore you hate? Cleaning the toilet (ewwwww!)  D - Dad's name? Wesley  E-  Essential makeup item? Mascara.  I almost never leave the house without it.    F - Favorite actor? I currently have "crushes" on Vincent D'Onofrio and Ivan Sergei.  G - Gold or silver? Silver. Gold disappears on me, since my coloring is so pale and I have red hair.  Trust me.  H – Hometown? St Charles, Illinois, a far suburb of Chicago.  I - Instruments you play? Piano since 2nd grade (that's 18 years) and guitar (self-taught, self-professed to be not very good)  J - Job title? Administrative Support Staff / Interim Youth Ministry Director (depending on employer)  K - Kids? Nope.  2 cats, Romeo and Matea, who are featured often here.  Also, I have  urlLink PCOS , so I'm not sure if I'll be able to have kids.  I'd love to adopt instead of giving birth, especially if I can't, or if I'm not married in a "few" years.  L - Living arrangements? Cute, cozy "2"-bedroom apartment with A and our 2 cats and 2 fish.  Wonderful balcony that's huge, with A's hammock on it and some plants.  Great view of downtown from our kitchen table.  M - Mom's name? Karen  N - Need... $$$. Blinds in my bedroom (it's only been 9 months that I've been changing in front of an open window...).  More time to sleep.  A new job.  O - Overnight hospital stays? Not really.  One nighttime trip to the ER for... digestive tract stuff, but I didn't really stay overnight, just until like 4 am.  P - Phobia? Any place or event where I have to enter alone or potentially be alone in a crowd.  Strangers.  Talking on the phone.  Can we say,  urlLink Social Anxiety Disorder ?  Q - Quote you like? "wisdom begins in wonder" is my current (Socrates).  R - Religious affiliation? Christian, evangelical, calvinist, probably Baptist,  urlLink Evangelical Covenant .  S - Siblings? One sister who's 24 this year in August and is married.  T - Time you wake up? Between 6 and 8:30.  Yeah, I know.  My alarm goes off at 7.  Sometimes I wake up before then, but don't make myself get out of bed like I should.  Nobody cares when I get in to work and I take the bus, so... I'm pretty lazy in the morning.  U - Unique talent? I do pretty good dressing others (as in, " urlLink What Not To Wear " and the like) but amazingly enough can't really dress myself that well.  I always end up... missing it somehow.  V - Vegetable you refuse to eat? Eggplant, parsnips, zucchini, tomatos, cooked onions  W - Worst habit? Talking while others are talking, spending money I don't have, I have a lot of bad habits.  X - X-rays you've had? My intestines.  See  O .  Y - Yummy food you make? Apple pie with a caramel/pecan topping.   Z - Zodiac Sign? Cancer.

      Commie is the new name of my PDA, an iPAQ 3955.  I didn't want to name it Packer, in case people thought I was a  Wisconsin Packers fan.  Commie, however, has prompted me to attach this graphic to his exterior:       My car's name is Sly (as in Sylvester).  He looks like this:    Prior to that, I owned a 1992 Honda Civic LX in navy blue.  He was never named, which was supposed to prolong his life, but it didn't work.  There was Skippy   who was both my first car and my fourth car.  I drove Skippy in high school for two years, and then my sister got to drive him while I was in college.  My dad then bought me Merle,   who lasted many years, through college and into Michigan.  My sister then owned Skippy, and sold him to me (Merle was given to a college professor).  He had a computer problem, and I drove the church van for several months.  Briefly I drove a really old truck.  Skippy was fixed, and then promptly died again, when I bought my Civic.  Which died on Labor Day 2003.  And then I bought Sly.  Other things that have been named?  Most recently, the squirrels that hang outside our apartment, Merle, Berle, Earl, and Girl.

      That's right.  Starbucks Vanilla Mocha VENTI.  I haven't slept well the last couple of days, which accounts for most of that.  While I love that my bed is directly under a window, when there are storms, this interferes with sleep.  It was too hot Monday night for decent sleep.  I woke up several times, once to go to the bathroom (which I never do), and when I got back in bed I had major stomach muscle issues.  Last night there was lightning, and then Romeo, who had escaped earlier, meowed mournfully through most of the night, which kept me awake.  I did pet him for about half an hour around 4:30 in the morning, just to make him be quiet.  And I've had a headache on and off today since 4 am.  I'm a joy to be around today, let me tell you.  This sleep thing is one of the reasons why I'm switching medications.  On drug A, if I take it in the morning I don't eat lunch, and if I take it at night my sleep is very light, and if I take it a couple of hours before dinner I can't fall asleep at all.  Hopefully, drug B will alleviate some of this.  It's especially annoying since I used to sleep like a dead rock.  Yeah.  We're in the final stages of our mission trip now.  We leave a week from Saturday for Georgia.  I'm also in the process of answering a bunch of questions for a church that might want to hire me.  And right after we get back from Georgia, Betsy's getting married.  June is busy.  Unfortunately, I'll be gone for my birthday.  That's ok, though.  It's a big scary number, as far as I'm concerned, and I'd rather just ignore it.  It's not that I'm vain (although most would say I am), but more that I don't feel OLD.  Some would argue 26 is not old, but it sure seems it to me.  I'm sure I'm supposed to be married and pregnant by now.  Or own a home.  Or at least be debt-free.  None of this is true.  I don't even have a full-time job in the career of my choosing.  Undeveloped as of yet, that's what I am.  No jokes, A, about my chest.  I leave you with fun pictures of Matea.

We have a big machine in the basement that does it for you, and so I take the paper downstairs, set it up, and push a button.

      "The  nothing  of conversation has its gradations, I hope, as well as the  never .  A clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion.  He must not head mobs, or set the ton in dress.  But I cannot call that situation nothing, which has the charge of all that is the first importance to mankind, individually or collectively considered, temporally and eternally - which has the guardianship of religion and morals, and consequently of the manners which result from their influence.  No one here can call the  office  nothing.  If the man who holds it is so, it is by the neglect of his duty, by foregoing its just importance, and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear."  " You  assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given, or than I can quite comprehend.  One does not see much of this influence and importance in society, and how can it be acquired where they are so selcom seen themselves?  How can two sermons a week, even supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer Blair's to his own, do all that you speak of? govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week?  Once scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit."  " You  are speaking of London,  I  am speaking of the nation at large."  "The metropolis, I imagine, is a pretty fair sample of the rest."  "Not, I should hope, of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom.  We do not look in great cities for our best morality.  It is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good; and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt.  A fine preacher is followed and admired; but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood, where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character, and observing his general conduct, which in London can rarely be the case.  The clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners.  They are known to the largest part only as preachers.  And with regard to their influencing public manners, Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me, or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of good breeding, the regulators of refinement and courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies of life.  The  manners  I speak of might rather be called  conduct , perhaps, the result of good principles; the effect, in short, of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend; and it will, I believe, be every where found, that as the clergy are, or are not what they ought to be, so are the rest of the nation."  - Mansfield Park by Jane Austen, pages 72-73, written in 1814.

      Well, I'm sure those of you that cared about pictures from Boston will appreciate these non-feet-themed pictures.  There were some boats in the harbor in Gloucester (pronounced gluster?)   See the thing on the plate with tentacles?  A ate that.  Just popped it in her mouth, whole.  EWWWWW!!!   This picture taken just to prove it.   These pictures taken in Gloucester also, at the memorial to those who've died at sea.     Stopping by Niagara Falls, A took these pictures as we drove through.  Amazingly enough, they all look pretty much the same.       We kept seeing this sign on roads (No HC) and we couldn't figure out what it meant.  We decided it meant No Hot Chicks, and we weren't allowed to be there, so we quick had to put on our "ugly" faces.  Alas, no pictures of the ugly faces.   Ohio welcomed us through on the way back (surprisingly enough, not on the way to Boston though), although we didn't really feel welcome, nor did we want to be there.  Ohio is big.  And annoying to drive through.  I don't recommend it.   I got to hang out with N & D & their daughter S, who will be two this month.  We went to college together, and I was really glad to catch up and meet S.  She is so cute!  We made friends.   Pictures from the reception....       So we also stopped in Erie, Pennsylvania, and took this picture to prove how windy it was.  A is gonna kill me for making this picture public....

      There's an article on Singleness and Christianity that I recently read that I really liked.  It's called Daring To Hope (it's a html file, not a pdf like I usually do).  I've highlighted the parts in green that really struck me as... truthful, and resonnated within me.  I don't really have much to add.  Rockin' out to: Rascal Flatts

      It was a lovely long weekend.  OK, well, for those of you who live in the Midwest with me, it was not exactly lovely.  Nonstop rain.  Four days.  It's supposed to let up sometime tomorrow.... Doubtful.  A went camping with her parents all weekend, so it was pretty quiet.  The cats are still all riled up from our trip to Boston, so they provided some entertainment.  There was decent TV on.  Mostly, I slept and cleaned and took care of some things I've been meaning to.  I was going to do some more planting (the first set of seedlings got washed away in the rains of a few weeks ago), but it keeps raining.  So, instead, Monday I watched  urlLink The Omega Code .  It was pretty good, for a Christian-produced Armageddon movie.  Better than  urlLink Left Behind , which was also good, but B-quality, if you ask me (which, you're here reading my thoughts, so I'll take that as asking....)  Bought some new stamps at the Post Office today.  I switched from my usual Breast Cancer Research to:    Work is boring.  Have I mentioned that lately?  I need to make some phone calls about potential jobs.  I sent out resumes right before we went to Boston, and got a few nibbles.  No new openings that have interested me since then, however.  I wonder how L is doing on her job search.  She's still in Florida, staying at her cousin's.  I'd like it if she came up here for a visit (hint hint, if you're reading this L).  June's going to be busy.  Just a warning.  I'll try not to be too crazy.  Rockin' out to: SheDaisy Wisdom Source: Mansfield Park by Jane Austen Today's Wisdom: Revelation 7:13-17.

That is why they are standing in front of the throne of God, serving him day and night in his Temple. And he who sits on the throne will live among them and shelter them.

      I have a really large bruise, and I don't know how I got it.&nbsp;  When I got home from canoeing, there it was.&nbsp; It's about the size of my fist, and dark purple and you can see veins and everything.&nbsp; I'd post a picture, but the only way to do that would be to let A take a picture of my butt with her camera-phone, and that's just not going to happen.&nbsp; That's right, it's on my butt.&nbsp; Now, I usually take note whenever my butt is touched, so you'd think I'd know how I got a huge bruise.&nbsp; But, no.&nbsp; I have no idea.&nbsp; Maybe I was briefly abducted by aliens....&nbsp; Do I have any repressed memories about that?&nbsp; Can you have repressed memories from 3 days ago?

      Mine would be right now.&nbsp; I have one of the most boring tasks ever to complete at work.     We recently had a major overhaul of our website, which now requires me to look at the code for every single page and edit it.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; I've almost put myself to sleep.&nbsp; And I'm hating whoever wrote these pages in the first place.    Also, I am sunburnt.&nbsp; Today is the first day that I haven't had to take aspirin for the pain.&nbsp; I went canoeing with the  urlLink Sierra Club 's  urlLink Inner City Outings  on Saturday.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun, however, when I left the house in the morning it was cold and overcast.&nbsp; It turned into a beautiful day, complete with sunshine and clear skies and warm.&nbsp; No sunscreen for me, though.&nbsp; I am so glad that I was wearing a tshirt (not a tank top) and pants (not shorts), so the area burnt has been kept to a minimum.&nbsp; Just my arms.&nbsp; I think the right one is going to blister and peel, and it's going to be gross.    Sunday I felt awful - I had forgotten how sick I can get when I am exposed to too much sun.&nbsp; Nauseated, tired, dehydrated, general all-over ickiness.&nbsp; Plus, for the first 2/3rd of the day, I was cold, like, really cold.&nbsp; Only towards the evening did I get over that and finally warm up.&nbsp; (Of course, then I was too warm.)&nbsp; So, I called in sick for my shift at the Bridge.&nbsp; I probably could have gone, but I just felt like poop and didn't think I could give it 100%, and they deserved that.    Really, there's not much more to say.&nbsp; I'm just stalling.&nbsp; I don't want to go back to editing code.&nbsp; You can't make me.&nbsp; I'd like to say there isn't enough money in the world, but I know what my checkbook looks like.

      9/2/97 Betsy - here i was, thinking that i wasn't going to freak out at all about this last weekend.   And i haven't yet, but i've gone over it in my head and if i don't verbalize soon i'll really go crazy. So, you get to put up with me venting (as you always do so graciously). So realize that i'm actually fine - i just need to express myself (everything is clearer then soemhow, you know?).  yikes! (as a sidenote) i'm in adolescent development (psychology) at 8am and i'm totally hyper - going stir crazy. there's theater seats in here so it's comfortable, but i don't think i can sit for any longer. aaahh!     and as another sidenote... i go to my first staff meeting today at 1:15 - very excited. actually go into the office tomorrow - have to werite all the sunday school curricullum tomorrow so i can photocopy on friday so i can sleep in on saturday. um... 124 lessons in one afternoon? doing a lot better about the internship - talked to vince Saturday night about it and he was cool - very helpful and understanding (btw, its 9/4 now).   well, all's old news now. kinda. very tired - just woke up from a very nice nap. now i'm in my night class. blah. i wish i was elsewhere, but i'm not.   very far behind in the sunday school lesson thing. wrote, like, four. oh well. funny how right no i'm loving my classes and could careless about my internship. i'm sure that'll change. it doesn't help ray being gone. just feeling... overwhelmed and completely incompetent.   9/9   blahblahblah. feeling like i could be doing something more important with my time - sad thing is i'm in foundations of youth ministry. wish the prof would shut up and teach us somethign practical. just blabbing on about stuff that doesn't apply to my background. seems our church is the exception - we're actually doing thigns right. prof needs to climb down off his soap box now. l8r   9/12  four hours until my world falls apart. funny, isn't it..... talked to jenny zerby for awhile about it. and ray. i just don't know. i don't know if i can survive the next four hours, knowing that... (or at least thinking that i know) my world is going to fall apart. and... just when i thought thigns were looking up. my sister was supposed to call me here, but she hasn't. i am going to try to take her back to judson with me tonight. think that'll be better than leaving her at home. i don't even want to go home.   it's taking every ounce of my strength to just... stay alive. you know the feeling. i don't mean to bum you out. really. it's just... i need to get this all out. and i know you'll listen, and that you actually care.   i think in a little bit i'll call vince. i'm not sure, but... i might. he's been through this. (or what i think this is.) anyways, i probably should do some actual work, so... i'll let you go. i'm sure i'll write you more tonight.

      It was a busy weekend. But first, let me start with an article I read in the paper today.     urlLink Poor Martha Stewart   The author makes some good points.&nbsp; The stats about child welfare are incredible and saddening.&nbsp; He references a report by the Children's Defense Fund of Minnesota, which is available  urlLink here .    Need something to listen to while I ramble on?&nbsp; How about...  urlLink an&nbsp;oldie ?    Now that you're jiving, maybe you'll be more willing to listen to me....    So Friday and Saturday were fairly uneventful for me.&nbsp; I did clean house and rearrange furniture on Saturday, and managed to pick up a package at the  urlLink Post Office  (containing a beautiful, albeit hard to wear out of the house with just a t-shirt and jeans,  urlLink bracelet/ring thing ).&nbsp; Sunday was the big day though.&nbsp; I met the kids at 8:00 in WBL to get ready for the worship service we were leading.&nbsp; All in all, it went well, but it took so much of my energy, I was spent by 11:00 am.&nbsp; Then it was off to  urlLink Mervyn's  to buy cheap furniture.&nbsp; They're closing, you know, and that meant I could work on refinishing the youth room... cheaply.&nbsp; I ended up with 6 round cafe tables and 2 rectangular ones.&nbsp; All are unfinished plywood/pressboard, and should present a great opportunity for individual creativity.&nbsp;  urlLink Mosaics?&nbsp; Paintings?&nbsp; Poetry? &nbsp; Who knows....    I got a quick nap when I returned home after eating some pasta, and then it was off to my first-ever shift at  urlLink The Bridge .&nbsp; I had a really good time.&nbsp; For confidentiality reasons, I can't really tell stories, but let me just say that the kids in my youth group now seem calm and might not get in trouble that much this fall.&nbsp; :-)    Work is boring today.    Oh! In other news that I forgot to tell you, I've come out of my boy-induced psychotic episode (see last Friday).&nbsp; I am, again, calm and focused, not stressed out about being 26 and not having a boyfriend in at least the last 4 years and having no prospects and when are you going to get married and have kids and buy a house in the suburbs?&nbsp; Really, I'm ok.&nbsp; I don't really feel my biological clock ticking ( urlLink I'm not really sure I even have one, and if I do, it's on life-support ).&nbsp; Sorry if that last link doesn't work (my internet is acting really funny so I can't check it right now).

        Remember the wedding I went to a few weeks ago (you're asking yourself, which wedding, there've been so many!)?&nbsp; Let me refresh your memory.&nbsp; Ok, looking back through my archives, I realize that I haven't really spoken of Betsy's wedding (my   urlLink  only reference    is that it indeed will happen, and then some comments about the bridesmaid's dress).&nbsp; It was two weekends ago, on July 3rd, which was part of my long absence from blogging.&nbsp; It was great fun, yadda-yadda-yadda.&nbsp; That's not the point of the story, really.&nbsp;          Since I was a bridesmaid, there was, naturally, a corresponding groomsman.&nbsp; To protect his identity (and my pride) we'll call him Wedding Guy (clever, I know).&nbsp; Let me just say that Wedding Guy was nice, engaged me in conversation when we went out after the rehearsal dinner, paid more than polite amounts of attention to me, and even walked me to my car.&nbsp; Towards the end of the reception when he was leaving, he came over to say goodbye to me specifically (not the others around me).&nbsp; I was quite enchanged.&nbsp; He's cute and was nice to me, and that's really about all I know of him (except that he can drink more than his fair share of beer and still drive safely).    I felt the need to tell the Bride my thoughts on Wedding Guy, particularly since Wedding Guy was the Groom's brother (and yes, this would mean that for the past two weeks I've been fantasizing about Betsy and myself being sisters-in-laws which would be so cool since we've been friends forever).&nbsp; I wanted to tell her, being that she's gone through a lot of crushes with me, and especially because I had begun to doubt that Wedding Guy knew I was interested too.&nbsp;&nbsp;I often fail to communicate my interest (since it happens so rarely that I'm in these situations), and have even failed to realize that guys were hitting on me until later.&nbsp; Yeah, I know.    So I told the Bride, and the following reply made me smile great smiles.&nbsp; Also, it put me in a dilemma of sorts.     Hmmm...&nbsp;Wedding Guy....Now for the fun part, the funny thing about your email was that Wedding Guy's comment about you was "too bad she lives in Minnesota!"&nbsp; You really made an impression on him! I am glad you had a good time with him.&nbsp; I am sure that if you livedaround here he would waste no time persuing you :)&nbsp; Now, that part is good for you, and I hope you enjoy the compliment,&nbsp;Wedding Guy&nbsp;is a connoseur when it comes to women - that is he is picky.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the distance issueis probably a good thing, because in my opinion, although he is ahandsome, charming man, he is not good enough for you.&nbsp; He is&nbsp;a construction worker (he workes hard, this&nbsp; is a good thing) but he is rather prone to drinking and gambling with his construction worker friends, and he has had live-in girlfriends, so although you interest him tremendously, he would have to change his ways... not that he wouldn't....but let's just say that your lifestyles don't exactly go together.&nbsp; As for the not dancing, as the bride, I forced him to dance with me, but he has no sense of the beat, so I think he feels rather uncomfortable on the dance floor, don't be insulted!Anyway, I was flattered for you that he liked you so much (you looked GREAT on Friday and Sat!) but I wish we could have hooked you up with someone more your type.... I will let you know if he mentions you in the future!      It is always nice to like someone and find out they like you back.&nbsp; This rarely happens to me.&nbsp; A and I spoke about it last night, and figured out that the only time this has ever happened to me is a few rare times of crushing on someone right before we dated, and there are only... three examples that I can think of where that happened.&nbsp; So, I was ecstatic, looked like I had a coat-hanger stuck in my mouth for a while, and couldn't really concentrate on anything else.    However, reality soon comes about.&nbsp; I have, since sophomore year of college, been commited to 1) not dating (I prefer courtship, which may seem merely like an issue of semantics, but it's not), 2) marrying someone who is as spiritual if not more than myself (and that's in reference to the Christian faith, and probably a fairly specific variety if you want to get into it).&nbsp; So, truthfully, Wedding Guy breaks those rules, those values, those ideals I held.&nbsp; Now, first I was saying, can't I break them just this once?&nbsp; But then I answered myself, no, you can't, because if you break your values for the one time that it presents itself, they're not really values.&nbsp; (Does that make sense?&nbsp; It's hard to put into words.)    So... God and I had a long talk last night (I've been having trouble sleeping lately, mostly because I am switching from Prozac to Wellbutrin).&nbsp; There was another major issue we dealt with, and that's the church job I've been interviewing for, which appears at the moment to be a closed door since I haven't heard back from them and I was supposed to by Wednesday.    It's this ridiculous conversation I have with God.&nbsp; Me: Here's what I think, feel, want.&nbsp; But I really want what You have planned. [pause] But again, let me tell you what I want.&nbsp; Really, no, i want Your will. [pause] But I really want it, so, if You could work it out.... No, that's not right, really, Your plans are better.    Do I sound crazy yet?&nbsp; It's this awful dilemma.&nbsp; I really want to be virtuous and a woman of integrity and high moral standards and all that other stuff.&nbsp; I have been extremely critical in the past of those who have professed to have the above and then acted completely differently when presented with another option.    On the other hand, I want to believe the best in people, too, even though that's completely against God's position on the state of humanity (see   urlLink  Calvin   :   urlLink  Total Depravity   ).&nbsp; I (for the most part, except when I'm in a foul mood), like to see the potential, the good (ok, mostly, or only, with guys that I crush on.&nbsp; It's a bad habit, I know).&nbsp; So I think "he can change" and that secretly he doesn't want to be the way he is and that Wedding Guy will end up like my Uncle Darrell, who wasn't anything special when he married my aunt, but is an amazing man of God and leader in his church and everything I'd want in a husband (except the navy career and the working in a nuclear power plant).    And&nbsp;on that&nbsp;third hand, I really want a relationship, a boyfriend, a husband, a family, or just someone to talk to on the phone romantically ( do not  read "phone sex" into that).&nbsp; And I really am interested in Wedding Guy.&nbsp; I need to email Betsy back and get her to talk me out of this situation.&nbsp; My heart and my will wrestling is not fun, nor pretty.

      I read this interesting article today on  urlLink ChristianityToday.com .  It's a columnist that I like to read frequently (wish she published more than once every other week), and frequently I find that she's written things that I would have said or thought.   (The highlights are the parts I found most interesting or agreed most with)   urlLink Independence Daze   Camerin is right in many ways in this article, especially when she notes that getting married later in life results in women being more independent.  I've been "on my own" for the last 4 years (and one month and 14 days, thank you), and I've become quite used to doing things for myself.  When I lived in  urlLink Michigan , there was no one else to do certain things for me, since I had very few friends, and most of them were older or people I wouldn't call for whatever it was I needed.  (There was one time when I was asked out on a date by the tenant above me, and I called MR to let him know in case I wasn't in church the next day and ended up dead somewhere; and there was WM, who replaced the computer in my car so that it would run again.)  But, suffice it to say, no one held the door open for me so I could get all the groceries in.  I did my own shopping (and carrying), put together furniture (granted, the cheap  urlLink Wal-Mart  or  urlLink Target  kind, but still), fixed my own computer, kept 2 cats alive and clean, and called the maintenance guy for the building when the pipe in my ceiling broke.  And  urlLink Minnesota  was no different, for even though for all of my stay here I've had roommates (or housemates), with the exception of A, most of them have been fairly removed from my life.  When I moved into Asbury house, my sister borrowed a truck and helped me with one load, but then I moved the rest of my stuff until 4 am, all by myself.  And in my current apartment, I've installed shelving (got to buy a electric screwdriver for that), replaced the lightswitches with white toggles instead of yellowed ones, and even added a dimmer switch.  A has replaced two shower heads, all by herself.  It's not like we don't WANT guys around, because, let's face it, both A and I would enjoy their company every once in a while.  (And A probably would appreciate not having to call her brother to help her install her air conditioner next time.)  But, we don't NEED them to do silly little things.  If they were around, they would have done all of those things, and I wouldn't be any less happy than I am right now (although my feeling of satisfaction when I use the dimmer switch would be significantly different).  However, in their absence, somebody has to do all that stuff.  And that somebody is me.  And the author is right when she says that often, when refusing an offer of help, it's more out of habit than anything.  You do get used to doing it yourself.  I have.  Two arms full of groceries up to the third floor, two cats in the doorway struggling to get out... I can handle it on my own (though a cat may escape from time to time).  So if men need to be needed... what am I supposed to do about that?  I don't know very many at any rate, especially single ones that would like to be needed by an attractive available mid-twenties girl.  A at least knows a few.  And she asks them for help from time to time.  If men need to be needed, what do women need?  Shouldn't I be able to answer that, being a woman myself?  I do know that the whole being independent thing is a great feeling.  I like knowing that I can take care of myself.  My mom has said the same thing.  She went from her parents' house to the dorms to married life, and now having been single for the past seven years, she's done a lot of things she didn't know she could do.  Like buy a house, fix plumbing, buy a car, etc.  She is much more secure in who she is now than she ever was before.    I think it would be a better situation if men needed to be wanted.  I  want  a guy to open the door for me, carry heavy things, fix minor household problems.  Do I  need  one, no, but I'd sure like it.  Does that work for the guys out there?  Is it enough that you're wanted?  Cause in this day and age, I really don't think you'll be too happy with a woman who  actually needs  you, to balance the checkbook, drive the car, mow the lawn, etc.  Don't we equally share tasks these days?  I don't need to do the dishes, I can share, if you'll let me mow the lawn every once in a while (which, by the way, is a bad example, because I hate mowing the lawn).  I would like to hear what you all think about this....  Really.   urlLink Camerin  would too.   Rockin' out to:  urlLink Caedmon's Call  Wisdom Source: The last chapter of The Red Tent by Anita Diamant Today's Wisdom:  urlLink Proverbs 31:10-31   "Who can find a virtuous and capable wife? She is worth more than precious rubies. Her husband can trust her, and she will greatly enrich his life. She will not hinder him but help him all her life.  She finds wool and flax and busily spins it. She is like a merchant's ship; she brings her food from afar. She gets up before dawn to prepare breakfast for her household and plan the day's work for her servant girls. She goes out to inspect a field and buys it; with her earnings she plants a vineyard.  She is energetic and strong, a hard worker. She watches for bargains; her lights burn late into the night. Her hands are busy spinning thread, her fingers twisting fiber. She extends a helping hand to the poor and opens her arms to the needy.  She has no fear of winter for her household because all of them have warm clothes. She quilts her own bedspreads. She dresses like royalty in gowns of finest cloth. Her husband is well known, for he sits in the council meeting with the other civic leaders.  She makes belted linen garments and sashes to sell to the merchants. She is clothed with strength and dignity, and she laughs with no fear of the future. When she speaks, her words are wise, and kindness is the rule when she gives instructions. She carefully watches all that goes on in her household and does not have to bear the consequences of laziness.  Her children stand and bless her. Her husband praises her: 'There are many virtuous and capable women in the world, but you surpass them all!'  Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last; but a woman who fears the LORD will be greatly praised. Reward her for all she has done. Let her deeds publicly declare her praise."

      There've been some good articles out there lately, and I thought I'd share them with you.    (notes on the following articles: all of these are copyrighted by their original sources; they are also all PDF files; all of the highlights were provided by me as insight to what I found moving; most if not all of the links were provided by me as well, as reference points; the original documents can be found on the web as of this date, but some will not be able to be found later, so if you want to see the original without my comments, you should probably do that sooner, rather than later.)   urlLink Young teens "hooking up" to avoid relationship maintenance  by Jeremy Iggers -A few things... oral sex is too sex.  Otherwise we'd call it... something else. -I can't imagine the danger presented by this idea of not "needing" emotional connections with a partner and just getting sex from them.  Plus, if it is possible to do that, it's not something that all of us can do.  I'm really sure I can't get physically involved with someone without getting emotionally involved as well (one of the many reasons I haven't gotten physically involved with someone).   urlLink Whatever Happened to 1 Corinthians 7:7?  by Fr. Gregory Jensen -Celibacy as a viable option?  It sure doesn't seem so in this day and age.  But the author has a point.  Life is full and rewarding and complete without sex.  It's along the same lines where some people think if you don't have kids you're missing out on life.  I'll admit that both kids and sex are valuable and significant, but life isn't incomplete without them, just different.  I wish more people would realize that.  I think my biggest problem if I decided to be celibate (as in permanently), or if I decided not to have kids, would be dealing with everyone else, who would either think I was deprived or ignorant (to give up sex), or selfish (to not have kids).   urlLink Mentally ill youth 'warehoused' in detention centers, study finds  by Erica Werner -This is truly a crime.  Haven't we reached the point these days where a majority of people recognize that many mental illnesses are biological, and that most are treatable with medication and/or talk therapy.  So why are we warehousing kids in juvie?  This clearly isn't what's best for them. -I realize this probably means more government funding.  Do the benefits outweigh the costs?  I think so.  Money spent paying psychologists and psychiatrists to help kids be fully functioning members of society turns into money those doctors can spend immediately, and secondly it turns those kids into people who are not a drain on the system but able to contribute, hold jobs, raise families, etc.  Obviously, the latter is a decade or more down the road, but still a worthy goal. -I tried to find the report online, but it's not out there yet.  I'd really like to read it though.   urlLink All Messed Up  by Bart Campolo -It's the last part of what Campolo writes that resonated with me.

      It's been a long time, baby!  I've been crazy busy, or at least away from home and a computer, for the last several weeks, which has meant you've all had to do without me.  So sad.     This past weekend I was in Betsy and Mike's wedding, and it was wonderful.  I also visited my grandpa who is in the hospital.  He seems to be doing better, but he is 91, so, if you are the praying type, yours are appreciated.  I'm not feeling terribly wordy today, so I'll just leave you with some pictures.

      So I've been reading this book,  urlLink Real Boys , by  urlLink Dr. William Pollack . It goes about describing the myths that society teaches to and about boys, how they are to behave, feel (or, more precisely, not), etc. And while I've only read the first two chapters, I've done a lot of thinking (hey, they're long chapters - I'm on page 63) about how I treat boys and men, what my preconceived notions of maleness are, what I expect, etc.   The more I think about this, especially related to chapter 2, I think that I do alright. In chapter 2, Stories of Shame.... which is mostly about how mothers and fathers treat their very young (infant to kindergarten) boys, how they discourage all negative emotions but anger, how they teach them to not cry and "be a man," how these behaviors cause boys to not talk about their emotions or experiences at all because they feel shamed for breaking the "Boy Code."   So I got to thinking, how do I talk to guys? The ones that I've been close with (and I'm thinking of several specific examples), I realized that I have talked to like I would a girlfriend, regardless of whether or not I was attracted to them (some of them I was, some of them I wasn't). I just... expected them to share with me the way any of my female friends would have. And for most, while it took occasionally a little prodding to get them to be open, we really talked, about things that mattered, situations, emotions, life. And not just over e-mail or late at night, where it's easier to be open and unguarded. I'm talking about in-person, face-to-face conversations.  And then I realized how strange that is, that I would treat guys like girls, simply because my own father doesn't know how to share an emotion (or even have one, my sister and I are convinced) to save his life. He is the most repressed, guarded, closed person I know. So   why  , with that example of masculinity for most of my formative years, would I not think all guys are like that? I am confused.  Of course, I also had to think about the stereotypes I have for guys and girls, the double standards, etc. One of the major ones I can think of is that, in a husband, I want a guy "with a spine, a backbone." But the more I analyze that, I realize that I really appreciate that in all of my friends, regardless of gender. I also want someone who clearly knows what he's doing in life, where he's going, and where his passions are. While this doesn't have to be the case with all of my friends, especially because we're all in our 20's and life just seems uncertain and undecided at this point, it is something that I truly appreciate and admire whenever I see it in people. I have felt, for most of the last 10 years, that I knew exactly what I wanted out of life, and while this has become less firm in the past year, I'm still fairly focused. I think that anyone I was going to join my life with permanently (as I consider marriage to be, permanent), I would want to know what I was getting myself into. I'm not saying that things can't change, that there can't be mid-life career changes, or that I'd be unable to handle a major trauma that caused any sort of permanent change (like paralysis, loss of speech, etc). When those things come along, you deal with them, together, in the best way you can. But I don't feel that I could join my life with someone who didn't even know whot hey were or what they wanted out of life. This would hold true if I were a lesbian, too, so it's not gender-specific.  Just so I'm not presenting myself as completely stereotype-free, or so you don't think I think I'm flawless when it comes to gender assumptions, allow me to share some of my preconceived notions.  Guys like sports. They don't multi-task well. They're stronger and taller than me. They're probably more physically active. Guys aren't fans of classical music, opera, or musicals in general. (as a side note, opera is not my thing either. who does like it?) I expect most guys to have feelings, but not wear them on their shoulder. They don't cry in public, unless it's a funeral (or maybe their favorite team just lost the pennant or whatever). Guys like to grill. And eat meat. On that note, they consume far more food than I ever do. I hear they're loud (from my sister, who just celebrated her one-year wedding anniversary). They detest Kenny G (which I agree with wholeheartedly) and any guy who is considered "pretty" and adored by many teenage girls (example: n*sync, josh groban). When young they play with trucks and guns, and "action figures" not dolls, and never babies. Girls are icky until they become an object of fascination, at which point they basically want to nail all of them, even if they don't like them or find them attractive. They talk about sex with their friends, like beer, and have probably seen a Playboy or two. Their bodies are warmer than girls (which makes them better for cuddling with, which they don't like, unless as a prelude to, as heard on Everybody Loves Raymond, "lower cuddling").  Now, for the record, I know plenty of guys who break a few, if not several, if not many, of these "rules." Most of the guys I know don't actually fit this mold. And, frankly, I don't want them to. The guy I just described would disgust me. I don't want to know him. And I feel bad if our society is pressuring guys to be "that guy." According to my rules, I don't think I know any "Real Men."  But I do. I know many wonderful, caring, testosterone-filled men, who don't drink beer, avert their eyes at appropriate times, share their feelings, can control their sexual urges, and generally act like people I would associate myself with. They love Jesus, respecct women, want to get married and have kids, love their mothers, and a few of them don't even like sports at all.  I feel sorry for anyone reading who doesn't know that kind of guy. A, this goes for you, too. We've talked about this. Good guys are out there. Why don't they make the press? I'm not sure. Please share stories here about some "good guys" you know. And if you are one, I'd love to hear from you, too, about what it's like to be a guy.

       while riding the bus, a woman got on with her 3-year-old son (I know this because there was much discussion about how old he was, complete with the holding up of fingers). The bus was fairly empty this morning, even though it was 8:30 in the morning, but maybe no one goes to work on Fridays anymore. This boy was fascinated with all of the adult males on the bus. He just stared at them. He had the sweetest look on his face, and his expression was one of wonder and admiration. I wondered if he'd ever seen an adult male before, from the way he treated them. Obviously, that couldn't be the case. And it wasn't as though, by the age of 3, he already had been taught negative things about women, because he was wonderful to his mother. He didn't even glance at me once, though. I was sitting behind an apparently very fascinating man, at whom the boy stared for easily six or seven minutes. It made me sad, beause I thought that probably he doesn't have a daddy at home, or even an uncle or older cousin that come around very often, if he's this fascinated with older men. What is growing up like that like?

      All over my state is legislature to  urlLink ban smoking . Many people are for it, many people are against it, I am fairly indifferent since I so rarely go out to places where smoking is obnoxious.   The coworker on the other side of my cubicle wall works for another department, and I find her completely and entirely annoying. But on the rare occasion that she provides some good laughter, it's ok. (Still, I won't be upset when we move this fall and I don't have to listen to her scream, "Michelle! Michelle!" every day.) Today she was talking (to Michelle, I presume) about the smoking ban, and how she just didn't want the government to interfere with her freedom to make stupid choices. She actually said, "if I want to be stupid and not buckle up [in my car], I should be allowed to. It shouldn't be a law."   Wow. That's deep. She might get a  urlLink Darwin award  for that some day. Or for dying from smoking (she's not smoking this week, though, because she's been sick. Hmm.) Rockin' out to:  urlLink Scandalous , by Mis-Teeq

      A while ago (last fall?) I received a sweatshirt with the Blogger logo on front. It's very soft and cuddly. You can't tell from this picture, but it feels like a big hug, just to put it on.         No, I'm not selling for Blogger. (But in case you're intrigued, here's the  urlLink store .)  Why do I bring this up? Well, it's that time of the year. I spend a good six months of the year dreaming about wearing tank tops, putting them on at ridiculous moments (like when it's 30 below because I live in the frozen artic tundra) and then complaining I'm cold, and in general lusting after my large collection. I try to layer them with other articles of clothing so I can wear them to work, to church, to... wherever.  But now it's that other time of the year. The time where I long for sweatshirts and  urlLink comfy pants  and  urlLink cuddly blankets . However, it's pickin' hot outside. Ok, today isn't that bad (77 F), and the humidity dropped majorly overnight (down to 52%), but it's still tank tops and shorts weather outside. The idea of being snuggly almost makes me cringe (well, except from inside my cube here at work, where it's freezing every day of the summer).  We'll probably have an  urlLink Indian Summer , too, considering how late it got warm this year. deep sigh.

      While not something I've done very much of (if any, really, depending on your definition), that is, in fact, what I will be talking about today.    The summer of 99 I went to San Francisco to work with an organization that brought youth groups to the innercity to minister to the homeless. I discovered country music, and the first CD I bought was Kenny Chesney. I would listen to it at night before falling asleep, and often would have a song or two stuck in my head all day long. Occasionally this would cause me to break out into humming or song at weird times.   One night, after getting into my pj's, there was a knock on our door (the girls, that is). It was one of the boys (who will remain nameless but who has made an indelible impact on my life). He was entirely embarassed that I was standing there in my pj's (I think it was that I wasn't wearing a bra, but who knows), and said he'd come back tomorrow. But I didn't care, and we talked in the doorway for a few minutes. I think it was during this conversation (although many events of that summer have merged together) that I started singing to myself "Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me" by Kenny Chesney (don't know the song? Listen below). I'll never forget that he looked at me and said, if you're not careful, I'll take you up on that" (or something to that effect).  To this day, when I hear this song, it makes me smile. Kind of a warm glow inside. Always nice to know that at some point in time, there was someone who wanted to kiss me. Even if it didn't happen.

      Is less than ideal. Having troubles with my new cell phone service providers. They're stupid. They have failed to fix my problem. I talked with them twice today, each for at least 15 minutes. Yesterday it was 3 times, plus a call to Qwest. Friday it was 3 calls also, and a call to Qwest. I have no problems with Qwest. It's not their problem.     So, this is what I found today to cheer me up. Or, Cher me up. I'm not sure.         Wisdom Source: Real Boys by Dr. William Pollack

      I'm staring at my coffee mug trying to believe what it says.    You can view all of them (and order) from  urlLink Natural Life . Mine says "Life is Good." I'm trying to believe that, really, but let me just share a few things that are getting in my way today. (BTW, I bought this mug at  urlLink Cocoon  where my mom got me a gift certificate for my birthday.)  First of all, I have no work today. And I really mean none. My boss isn't here. My supervisor isn't in yet, and I don't know if she's coming in at all. There is no work on my desk. I have updated my website, cleaned out files, burned stuff onto CDs to clear up my hard drive, dusted, filed, even made labels for folders until the year 2010. I didn't bring any church work with me today, so I don't have that. And I didn't bring a book to work this morning, so I can't read. What am I going to do, stare at the walls of my cube?  Secondly, I heard some disturbing stories yesterday as I volunteered. Due to confidentiality, I can't really tell much about them. But let me say a few things. What kind of a world is it where you can  urlLink drop a baby off at a hospital , no questions asked, but you can't call the police anonymously and get them to drive by a location where there's a teenage girl with a bullet in her leg? Apparently we don't have a  urlLink CrimeStoppers  in Minnesota, and even if we did, I'm not sure that this situation counted. It just doesn't make sense to me. Her life was clearly in danger, but there's that whole confidentiality thing that wasn't supposed to be crossed, either.  I have learned about kids who've been in prostitution since elementary school, kids born to moms addicted to crack, kids who've been in the system for over ten years and just want to get out, kids who only want to find their parents so they can kill them, underage girls who are pregnant by much older boyfriends, and the list goes on.  I really struggled with this last night. God and I had a long chat about  urlLink free will . It's not that I don't believe in it, because, clearly, all of those situations and so many more can only be explained that way (we could get into it deeper, talking about temptation and Satan and so forth, but I just want to keep it here for a moment). My problem last night was more along the lines of, how could You let us have free will, when You know what horrible things might happen?  Plus, I totally believe in predestination and God's sovereignty and all of that. I am truly a  urlLink Calvinist  at heart. And so far, I've been able to accept whatever's come my way with a simple, "I don't understand it, but I believe God's got a plan for this." This stuff I've heard and seen recently, though, when it's more... personal, when there are individual lives being destroyed, it's much harder to trust what He's doing, and easier to just believe we're in control of this whole thing.  Which is totally not true. I am so not in control. A is thinking about moving, which leaves me totally NOT in control of my living situation until she decides. Do I get a new  urlLink roommate ? Do I move into someone else's apartment (so obviously a stranger since I know no one here other than A and L, who is moving back soon hopefully)? Do I put all my stuff in storage temporarily and live at my sister's house? I can't afford to live in an apartment by myself, especially not the one I'm in currently. But I really like it. The point being, I'm not in control of that. I can barely get control over my checkbook.   All this to say, (and with some degree of anti-climatic-ness) I have no answers. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. (Well, I know a few things, like that Fred is Red is a  urlLink Target  brand.)
