      Oh joy.  It's raining again.  Funny... I don't remember moving to Seattle.  I halfway expect to see the squirrels and other critters lining up in twos around here.  At least there is some thunder with these latest rains.  Gotta follow the rules, ya know - hehehe  Speaking of rules, I wonder if the new receptionist would be interested in learning a few of them?

      I just found out someone has actually read this thing!  I'm so excited!  I know it's not the most interesting thing in cyberspace, but it's mine and I am proud of it.    I know I could go out and stir up some readership if I wanted to, but I'm not nearly that motivated.  I'll let people discover this on their own.  If anyone does read this please leave me a comment.  User participation is encouraged!  Thanks for reading!  Kisses - Carrie

      Oh...  One other thing...  She smells good too.  Between her and the thunderstorms moving in I'm having quite a frisky afternoon.  Kisses - Carrie

      Okay - I am officially in lust with our new receptionist.  She is absolutely incredible.  It's probably a good thing I will only be working here a few more weeks.  I could get myself in trouble otherwise.  She is 24 and recently moved to town to be with her boyfriend (too bad).  She's tight and thin and has absolutely fantastic legs (and ass).  She has long, straight dark hair and brown eyes to go along with her perfect skin.  Nice full, pouty lips as well.  Very kissable.  She's wearing a light green sleeveless top and matching skirt that really shows off her body.  I'm not joking when I say she could easily be a model.  She's that perfect.  Now if I could just do something about the puddles im making...  Kisses - Carrie

      Okay I'm ready for the rain to be over.  I have not seen the sun all week and it's starting to affect me.  S is turning in her notice today.  I guess there is no turning back now.  She seems totally at ease with everything.  I wish some of that would rub off on me.  The packing begins this weekend.  Ugh I hate packing.  And this will be serious packing, not half-assed moving a couple of miles packing.  It helps that S is keeping her condo here in town so we can leave extra junk here.  She is renting it out to a friend of hers (the same guy who rented it while she was in Prague).  She says she will probably sell it at some point, but she doesn't want to worry about doing that right now.  I can understand that.  Our ongoing debate is what to do about our vehicle situation.  We are trying to decide if we are really going to need two cars up there.  Having two cars would not be an issue except for the fact there is literally nowhere to park them.  We would have to park them on the street, and that is constantly full.  Finding a space for one car will be hard enough, and two downright impossible.  My biggest concern is the fact I still don't know what I will be doing once we move up there.  S can pretty much walk to campus from our duplex, but I'm sure she will need a car from time to time, and ours would not be available to her if I had it at work.  I think at this point we are going to leave my car here with my parents (if they agree - we haven't asked them yet since my mom is being such a bitch) and use her car up there.  A convertible in a New England winter should be fun! (sarcasm)  Well my lunch break is over so I should get back to work.  I'll try and post more over the weekend if I can.  Thanks for reading!

      Hello loyal readers (yea right - maybe read er ).  Well my typical post-trip illness has set in.  I always seem to get sick after I take a trip.  I blame the stale air in airplanes.  At least I don't usually get sick DURING the trip.  That would be no fun at all.  I woke up yesterday with a slight sore throat.  It seemed to go away during the day but came back later yesterday evening.  This morning it was much worse and I had the beginnings of a nice headache to boot.  I've managed to drag myself into the office but I'm not sure how long I will be staying.  The worst part is my growing illness made it impossible to really enjoy the lovely thunderstorms we had  ALL  night long last night.  Those of you who know me know what I mean by "enjoying the thunderstorms".  Actually I was able to enjoy the storms by myself (hint hint), but it's not nearly as fun as it is when I can play with S.  I did't want to get her sick.  Other than that I have a serious case of senioritis or whatever it is called in adulthood.  I have a hard time giving a damn work-wise now that I know I will be quitting very soon.  I just don't care anymore.  Of course I was never the most dedicated employee to begin with, so you add this on top of things and I'm well into Slacker range.  I'm sure it will even get worse right until my last day (whenever that will be).  Part of me would not mind my bosses cutting me loose the same day I turn in my notice, but I'm pretty sure they will need to keep me around for at least a week, probably two.  Well that is enuff for now I think.  Have a great day!  Kisses - Carrie

      Whew.  Back home at last.  The trip to Boston was good, but exhausting.  I should have gone ahead and taken tomorrow (Tuesday) off as well.  You always need one extra day at home before returning to work after a trip, especially a "working" vacation.  I really don't consider what we did as a vacation.  I think we considered it more a business trip since more than half the time was spent on finding a place to live and other stuff like that.  At least we got to see some of the city on Sunday (most of the city if my legs had anything to say about it!).  I'm getting more and more excited about the move as it gets closer.  It's amazing how fast time is flying by.  It does not seem like we will be living in a new city in a little over a month.  That being said, it is getting close to the point where I give my notice at work.  That should be interesting.  I have always taken great pains to keep my professional and personal worlds separate.  None of my coworkers have any idea as to my lifestyle choice.  Once I give my notice I'm sure the questions will start "So where are you going?".  I'm not looking forward to that.  I'm not sure how I am going to respond.  I'm not ashamed of being a lesbian, I just want my privacy.  All I need is all the nerds in my office (I work in an engineering office) to think about me and another woman.  I'm sure they do that enough as it is.  I don't need to encourage them.  I'll probably give my notice after July 4th.  No sense breaking the news before a paid holiday.  Let's see... July 4th is a Sunday... So I think Friday the 9th sounds pretty good.  Might as well break the news on a Friday.  Hopefully that will help stem the tide on the questions.  It's weird.  I've never really quit a job before (except for that sandwich shop job I had for 3 weeks in HS, but that doesn't count).  Of course this is the first "real job" I have ever had, so I do not have much to compare it to.  I'm not sure how my bosses will react.  It could go either way really.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens.  Well I think I have droned on long enuff.  I probably shouldn't worry about boring my audience since there doesn't seem to be one.  See that counter down in the lower right hand corner?  I think all the hits listed are from me checking to see how many hits I have had.  Pretty pathetic huh?  Maybe I will include some sex talk in my next submission.  That should bring the pervs in.  Kisses - Carrie

      Hey Peeps!  I'm in Boston right now trying to find a place to live.  For those of you who don't know, my girlfriend (yes I'm a lesbian) starts grad school next term.  We are both quitting our current jobs (no great loss for me I assure you) and moving up to Boston so she can attend school.  Today starts day two of finding somewhere to call home for the next two years.  Hopefully today goes better than yesterday.  I have been to Boston once before - for my brother's graduation from HBS a few years ago.  I really didn't get to experience much of the town that trip due to all the usual graduation crap, so this is really my first chance to really snoop around.  So far I like it, but ask me again in the middle of the winter.  I've never lived anywhere where it actually snows with some regularity.  Well, that's semi-true. I was born in Wisconsin, but I don't count that since I don't remember anything about it.  I'll have to write more later!  We have apartments to see!  Kisses - Carrie

      This is my first time blogging.  I know... I know...  Late to yet another fad.  Just like always.  I must have been a lemming in a former life.  I can't promise to most scintillating posts in the world but I will try and keep things interesting.  Watch this space!

      Well it is done.  I am officially unemployed.  Today was my last day at the office.  I apologize for the lack of posts the past few days but I have been so busy I have barely had time to check my e-mail let alone update the world on my current status.  Today was weird for me.  I may have mentioned it before, but this is the first job I have ever quit, apart from a menial sandwich shop job when I was in HS.  It kinda felt like I simply walked away from the past three-plus years of my life.  For all the time I have put forth the past years, I have very little tangible results of my effort.  That leaves me feeling kinda empty.  Like I didn't make a difference or something.  Hopefully when we get to Boston I will be able to find a job that will help me feel more connected to actual tangible results.  Thats my goal anyway.  We will see how reality will differ from fantasy.  I think the thing (well, person really) I will miss the most is the new receptionist.  God she is incredible.  Today she was wearing perfect jeans and a little lavender/purple baby tee top (casual friday).  Both the jeans and top were pretty tight and showed off all her curves.  I could just sit and watch her for hours.  She is such a nice person too.  If only she knew what I was thinking about when I talked to her!  Depravity hardly covers it.  The next few days will be the worst of the summer I think.  Tomorrow we are moving a bunch of stuff into storage.  Hopefully it's not too ungodly hot (yea right).  I hate just storing stuff but we really don't have a choice.  It seems wasteful or something.  Our new place just won't be big enuff for everything we currently have.  Sunday will be our final day of packing.  The movers come 1st thing Monday morning, so we have to get everything packed and ready to go by Sunday night.  Fun fun fun.  S and I then start our nice long drive Tuesday morning.  We're kinda playing that part by ear.  We don't have any reservations or anything on the way up, so we will just find places to stop as we go.  I'm kinda looking forward to the long drive actually, which is weird for me since I usually hate long drives.  I guess I'm looking forward to just spending time with S and not have to worry about packing or whatever.  I'd perfer to spend some time alone with her in a nice bed and breakfast somewhere instead of hurtling down the interstate in a cramped car, but B&B's get terrible gas mileage.  I don't know how often I will be able to post to this here blog the next few days.  The next message may have to wait until we get to Boston.  I'll do what I can!  Thanks for reading!

       Whoo Hoo!  My hit counter has passed the double century mark!  Where's the champagne?  I hope everyone is enjoying what I am writing.  I know it's not the most exciting stuff in the world, but what am I supposed to do?  Lie?  Speaking of liars has everyone seen that Bush/Kerry web cartoon thingee?  Check it out!  It can be found at  urlLink http://www.jibjab.com  .  It is hilarious.  It's kinda big so those of you on dialup may want to pass on it until you catch up to the 21st century (sorry Nicole!).  I actually tried to watch some TV last night.  It was probably the first time I have sat down and tried to find something to watch in two months.  Now I know why I stopped.  There is nothing but crap on.  We have like a zillion channels and not one of them is showing anything worth watching.  What really peeved me is that the Democratic National Convention started yesterday and the major networks were pretty much ignoring it.  Sure it was being covered ad nauseam by the cable news channels, but why no love on the major networks?  I think it's sad that more broadcast time was spent choosing the latest "American Idol" cheeseball singer than will be spent on choosing the next President.  I was watching a bit of CNN's coverage.  Wolf Blitzer and his ilk were sitting and talking to a woman who I think was the governor of Michigan (some midwestern state anyway).  They were having a pretty relaxed, candid conversation over whatever and I was pretty impressed with her.  Than all of a sudden she flipped her "political" switch and answered some question using all the right buzzwords and catch phrases.  It made me ill.  One second she is cracking jokes and stuff then she suddenly became a robot spewing the party line.  As soon as she went into robot mode I changed the channel.  Don't they know that spewing such over-practiced garbage just turns people off?  We can tell actors when we see them.  Oops... I started ranting about politics.  Sorry about that.  It won't happen again!  I had something else I wanted to say but I can't remember what it was now.  Oh well.  I'm kinda used to that.  My memory is terrible, and I think it's getting worse.  I've seriously considered taking ginsing or whatever it is that is supposed to help your memory.  It's that bad.  I hope I haven't written any of this before!  Well off to work!  I hope everyone has a great day!  Kisses - Carrie

      This is so unfair!  Not only has my company hired the hottie receptionist recently, they have made an offer to another pretty sweet woman engineer (yes they do exist! I saw her!)  Why couldn't they have hired these new hotties six months ago?  Why was I stuck with only a bunch of nerdy loser guys as co-workers until only recently?  On top of that we just got a new shipment of computers this morning.  Three pallets of boxes all emblazoned with the Dell logo.  Our equipment lease was up so everyone in the office is getting a new machine (with flat-screen monitors no less!).  It's just my luck that all these changes happen while I'm almost out the door.  Sorry - just wanted to rant.  Kisses - Carrie

      Ahhhhhhhh...  Finally a relaxing weekend!  S and I decided to take a break from the packing and moving chaos that is our lives and have a relaxing weekend for the first time in months.  Friday nite we decided to eat-in (not that kind of eating you pervs (that came later)) so we ran to the store to get some ingredients.  I guess were were not paying much attention and we somehow ended up with low-carb raveloli (sp?).  Somehow I missed the big, bold lettering that screamed "half the carbs" right on the front of the package.  We noticed the screw up when we got home, but we decided to try it out anyway.  That was a mistake.  The stuff was vile.  I think we would have been better off boiling up one of our moving boxes.  Cardboard would have been better than that stuff.  So now low-carb pasta is added to my list of things never to buy again (along with low-fat sour cream).  So we ended up ordering a pizza.  S gave the pizza dude a little bonus tip for answering the door in her bra.  We watched our DVD of Spiderman in preparation of seeing Spiderman 2 the next day and went to bed (hehehe).  Saturday we slept in (one of my favorite things in the whole world) and did a few errands in the morning (nothing exciting unless you count getting an oil-change exciting).  We went to the movie (more on that in Carrie's Movie Corner) that afternoon and went out to dinner afterwards.  Yum yum.  And to cap everything off we hit Marble Slab. Super yum yum.  I got my usual - Amaretto with chocolate chips in a waffle cone.  I love Marble Slab.  Actually I love just about anything to do with ice cream.  Of course it means I'll have to hit the treadmill an extra 20 minutes tonight, but it's well worth it.  (Oh we made love Saturday nite too.  I think we have both been missing that!)  Sunday we got back into the packing mode, but we were interrupted by some lovely midafternoon thunderstrorms, so our usual rule came into effect.  3 sessions in as many days!  Life is good!  So that brings us to Monday morning.  The last monday morning I will spend here at this job.  That feels kinda weird, but good at the same time.  My replacement is supposed to start on Wednesday.  I'm supposed to help show her what I do and everything.  I think that is gonna be kinda weird.  And now boys and girls (hopefully more girls than boys), it's time for Carrie's Movie Corner!  This week's movie is Spiderman 2.  I liked it but I liked the original better.  S was undecided.  We both thought that there was too much time spent on Peter Parker's struggle with his choice between being Spiderman and being a "normal" person.  Those parts just seemed to slow the movie down, especially the scenes with his Aunt.  I know that stuff is all important to show the inner conflict Spiderman has, but we both thought it was too much.  And what was up with the skinny neighbor chick?  That scene with her and the cake added nothing to the story.  We both thought that she might have a purpose later in the movie, but she never appeared again.  The movie was best when Spiderman was doing his hero stuff.  Too bad he didn't get to do more of that.  There was also not enuff Kirsten Dunst for me, but that's just personal preference (hehehe).  I think it's time to rent "Bring it On" again.  Mmmmmmmm... Cheerleaders...  I was kinda suprised by how many little kids were in the theater.  I'm talking about toddler-age kids.  The movie was rated PG-13, mostly for violence.  I thought several scenes (the hospital scene especially) were way too violent for little kids to see.  The fights between Spiderman and the octupus guy were not too bad, since it is Spiderman who is doing the fighting, but the scenes where the octopus guy was beating up on innocent civilians were way too intense for little kids.  So endeth another segment of Carrie's Movie Corner.  Thanks for reading!  Kisses - Carrie

      I came across this link in a chatroom.  I thought it was interesting (the link not the chatroom):   urlLink www.auracolors.com    You answer a series of questions and your personality is characterized into various "colors".  I was an 8 on " yellow " (fun-loving, free-spirited, energetic, and childlike) and " blue " (loving, nurturing and supportive), a 5 on " abstract tan " (bright and curious, childlike) " green " (powerful and intelligent) and " indigo " (new energy, new consciousness, new age), and a 4 in " violet " (inspirational visionaries, leaders and teachers) and " magenta " (nonconformists).  I was a 1 or 0 in the other categories.  I'm not sure if I trust any of these online personality tests, but I thought this one was spot on to how I see myself.  Take the test yourself and let me know how you came out!  Kisses - Carrie

      I wish my Weatherpixie over on the right had a little more variation to her wardrobe selections.  She's been wearing the same two outfits for the past two weeks.  They have to be getting pretty grungy by now!  Ick!  Short post today.  Perhaps I'll be in the mood to write more later today.  Take care everyone!  Kisses - Carrie

      Sorry for the lack of posts recently.  There's just nothing happening to me that is worth writing about.  I told ya that I was boring!  I spent all weekend packing and unpacking and repacking.  God this is taking forever.  I'm ready to just walk away from it all and start all over again in Boston.  I would be serious about that if it wasn't for the fact that we will both be unemployed soon, and you tend to need money to start your life over.  New clothes, furniture and furnishings cost $$$, and that will be in short supply in the very near future.  Sure, S has quite a nest egg saved up for her school expenses, but we are quite sure we will be in debt by the time she gets done.  We are just not sure how much!  That somewhat depends on what kind of job I get up in Boston.  I have not even had time to think about that.  I should be updating my CV and all that fun stuff, but I just haven't had the time or energy for that.  That's probably a mistake on my part, but it's hard looking for a job in a city you don't live yet.  It makes the interviews kinda difficult.  That's my life at this point.  Packing and stressing.  Hopefully now that S is finally done with work she will be able to make some decent progress during the day instead of us scrambling to things done after work.  It will be nice to be able to sit down and enjoy each other's company in the evenings.  Who knows... Maybe the sex will start again.  I miss the sex.  Well I have blabbed for long enuff.  I'm signing off now.  Have a great day everybody!  Thanks for reading!  Kisses - Carrie

      Well it took the powers-that-be less than 3 days to find a replacement for me.  Nice to know that I am that expendable.  It really makes me feel special.  The woman who is taking over my job is coming from an archtiect's office here in town.  I've actually worked with her a couple of times on projects we were chasing together.  She's nice and all, but I don't see her as being a very good fit here.  Of course it's none of my business since I'm outta here.  My bosses did ask if I could stick around another week.  My replacement will not be able to start until the beginning of August.  I would have said no thanks except for the fact I could really use the money.  S and I are beginning to realize the move is gonna be more expensive than we had thought.  I think I can hang as a lame duck for 2 more weeks.  S's last day of work is today (lucky bitch) (love ya S!).  I guess she's just gonna have to handle all the packing duties during the day since I will be slaving away at work.  Yea right.  More like sitting on my duff at work.  Like I'm gonna be giving any more effort than the bare minimum around here.  My God it's freaking hot.  The weatherdude on the TV said we hit 99 yesterday.  I can believe it.  I'm just glad I have covered parking during the day.  Third degree burns from a steering wheel are never a good thing.  And if the little metal buckle thingie is in direct sun?  Forget about it - Call a cab.  And as a reward for reading all the way down to the bottom of today's post, I have something to confess...  I'm going commando today.  I usually go pantiless on Fridays (unless Aunt Flo is visiting).  Just a little FYI for ya.  Until later!  Kisses - Carrie

      I am exhausted.    I did not get much sleep last night (and not for good reasons!).  I woke up about 2:30 and couldn't fall back asleep.  I guess all the stress is catching up with me.  I tossed and turned for about an hour then got up and tried to read a bit, but that didn't help.  I even tried a certain... ummm... activity... that usually puts me in a content mood but still no luck.  So if this post seems a bit lethargic you know why.  I'm ready for the move to be over.  I'm sick of seeing boxes everywhere and we still have a couple of weeks to go.  Where did all this shit come from?  I had no idea we have as much stuff as we do.  It's amazing how much stuff you can cram into a closet or cabinet.  It just keeps on coming.  I filled 6 boxes with junk out of the second bedroom closet last night and I swear the closet still looks full.  It's like we are not making any progress, despite the fact we are working our asses off every night.  The questions have begun at work.  "So I hear you are leaving us!  Why are you leaving?". Repeat 30 times. And I have to lie every time.  I have always considered myself an honest person, so all the lies chip away at me.  But I have no choice.  If I break down now and announce to the office that I am gay, my final two weeks will be hell (well, more hell than they are already).  Just one more reason i am ready for the move to be over.  I'm still not talking to my mother.  I'm afraid I will say something that I will regret later.  I know that I should sit down with her and try and have a decent conversation with her before I leave, but I have a feeling that is not possible right now.  Both of us are waaaaay to upset right now to have a productive discussion.  I guess we will see what happens as my departure nears.  I think that is enuff drivel for now.  Thanks for reading!  Kisses - Carrie

      Wow the Receptionist looks good today.  Her legs are fantastic.  She's wearing a fairly short skirt (very tasteful) and no hose.  You can tell she works out.  She has some great definition, especially in her thighs (not that I was looking or anything ;) ).  I wonder if she used to be a cheerleader.  She has cheerleader (or a gymnast) legs.  I wonder how I could bring that into conversation...  Oops!  Back to work!  I'm still on the payroll for at least two more weeks!  Kisses - Carrie

      Whoo hoo!  The little counter thingee says my blog has had 100 hits!  Kewl!  Of course, most of them are probably me making sure things look right, but it's still kewl.  The counter seems to have been getting faster, so maybe more people are checking my blog out.  It would nice if they at least said hello though.  It's supposed to be hot here this week.  Highs in the upper nineties.  I'm not going to miss that when we move.    I take that back.  I will probably miss that when it's like zero degrees and snowing in Boston.  I'll miss wearing shorts at Christmas.  S and I moved a bunch of stuff into storage yesterday.  That's always fun.  I already had some stuff in storage from when I moved in with S last year.  Now I have even more.  For some reason it seems to be my stuff that is getting put away.  Most of S's stuff is coming to Boston with us.  I'm not sure if I should be upset about that.  Of course all her stuff is nicer than mine, but it would still be nice to contribute SOMETHING.    The main problem is that our place in Boston is smaller than our current condo, so not everything we currently have will fit properly.  We could cram it all in there if we wanted, but we would jumping over stuff constantly, and that's not fun.  We do realize that when we get up there we will discover we made some poor choices on what came and what stayed.  Sure we could move everything up there and figure out what to put in storage later, but we are really trying to minimize the amount of things we are taking up there, mostly due to the cost of moving the stuff.  We are being smart and are hiring professional movers to take care of anything, and the more they move the more it costs.  Since both of us will be unemployed in a short period of time we are trying to cut costs as much as possible.  Well my fingers are tired.  I'll try and write more later.  If anyone is reading this please say hi!  Kisses - Carrie

      Well I still have a job.  At least for another couple of weeks.  Of course that could change at any time.  My bosses were suprised and disappointed that I was leaving the company.  They offered me more money to stay, but of course I had to turn them down.  I should have threatened this months ago!   It was a looooooong conversation with them.  Much longer than I had anticipated.  I think they were trying to figure out why I was leaving.  I have always kept my private life completely separate from my work life.  Nobody at the company knows my choice of lifestyle, and I was not about to change that.  Technically it is against the law for employers to ask personal questions like that, but my bosses never seem to understand that.  I had to skirt the real reason I was leaving several times.   Next week should be fun.  I'm already expecting a barrage of questions from my co-workers on the details of my departure.  I will have to fend them off the same way.  I hate doing that to people, but in this case I feel I have to.  Letting them onto my secret at this point will only raise more questions, and I don't have the energy for that.   Well enuff about that.   S and I went to see the new Harry Potter movie earlier today.  It was good, but I think if I had not read the book I would have been completely lost.  The look and feel of this movie was quite a bit darker than the previous two, but that is true about the books as well.  I did however feel the new movie was almost too dark.  In the first two movies, Hogwarts looked like a wonderous, fantastic place that would be kewl to visit and just wander around exploring.  In this movie it looked much more depressing.  Dank, dark and dreary.  Not at all a place I would want to attend school.   I also felt that the storyline seemed a bit choppy.  I know parts of the book had to be left out in order to keep the length of the movie halfway reasonable, but I thought there were a couple of important items they skipped over completely.  The movie made no mention of who made the Marauder's Map.  I would have thought there would have been the explanation to where the names "Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs" came from.  It's a rather key element to the whole series of books.  Harry did not even question Lupin on how he knew how to work the map.   Well that's the end of Carrie's Movie Corner.  Our next film will be Spiderman 2 (I hope).   This sucks.  This is the first time I have been online in weeks and none of my friends are around.  That figures.  I supposed I should have expected that since my life is so out of sync with everyone else (apart from S).  I guess I'll just have to go bore myself to tears in a chatroom somewhere.   I hope everyone is having a great weekend!  Stay safe!   Kisses - Carrie

      You know... It's hard to be motivated to get work done when I don't know if I will still be an employee by the end of the day.  Of course I have somewhat felt that way since the decision was made to move to Boston, but it is especially bad today.  I just don't care anymore.  That is all.  Kisses - Carrie

      Well this it it.  I'm turning in my notice to my bosses this afternoon.  I am totally freaking out.  I could barely sleep last night and I couldn't eat this morning, which is a pretty big deal for me.  I doubt I will be able to eat lunch either.  Maybe I have discovered the next great diet fad - "Carrie's quit your job diet".  It's gotta be healthier than Atkins!  Of course you may die from stress.  My brother called me yesterday and told me all about the baby.  I can't wait to see the pictures!  Everyone is doing well.  I'm kinda sad that I won't be able to see my niece until Christmas.  Oh well.  I guess that's what happens when your family is spread from one coast to the other.  I think S and I are going to take a break from all the moving chaos and go see the Harry Potter movie tomorrow.  I've heard it is pretty good.  I wanted to see Spiderman but we figured that HP would be out of the theaters soon so we better see it while we can.  S promised we would see Spiderman soon.    It's funny - we used to go see all kinds of movies.  Now we are both so busy we barely have time for anything.  It's sad really.  I feel terrible that I've been too busy to see or talk to any of my friends.  The biggest problem is that I don't see it getting better anytime soon.  I feel like I'm running out of time on EVERYTHING.  The days are slipping by and it's like nothing is getting done, despite the fact we are both working our tails off.  And it's not just our friends that are being neglected.  I feel like S and I have been neglecting each other.  I mean it's not like we are ignoring each other, it's just that we do not spend as much time together as we used to.  Even our sex life has taken a hit.  We are both so exhausted at the end of the day we aren't in the mood for playing, and that is saying alot if you know me at all.  Normally we would be all over each other all the time.  We both tend to run a little hot in that regard.  I'm sure that things will return to normal once we get settled down in Boston.  At least I hope it will.  The shower massage has been getting WAAAAAYYYY too much action recently.  Well I have probably shared too much information already for today, so I'm gonna wrap this up for now.  Thanks for reading!

      Well I am officially an aunt!  It turns out my brother and his wife had their baby late last nite.  The baby's first name is Virginia, but I'm not sure how to spell the middle name (My sister-in-law is asian and it's some family name).  Evidently everyone is doing great.  The baby was 6 lbs. 15 oz. and 19 1/2" long.  I don't know much else at this point.  My brother called my parents sometime last night but was not able to talk long.  He is evidently supposed to make all the calls today sometime, which is good since I have loads of questions!  Thanks to all the excitement I did not sleep very well.  For some reason I had a very weird dream about playing in a laser tag tournament or something like that.  I usually don't remember my dreams, so on the rare occasion that I do I try and analyize them.  I've only played laser tag once (i was like 12 or something), and I didn't particularily like it, so I'm not sure what the dream is supposed to mean.  Usually the dreams I remember involve sex, which is probably why I remember them in the first place.  But laser tag?  WTF?  If I make any breakthroughs on the intrepretation I will let you know!

      Well I could be an auntie at any time.  I called my sister-in-law earlier this evening to wish her good luck tomorrow on her C-section, and it turns out she was on her way to the hospital right then.  I didn't get to talk to her for obvious reasons, but my mom said she talked to my brother and he said my sister-in-law had gone to the doctor earlier this afternoon and he said to go directly to the hospital.  Evidently he did not think the baby was going to wait until tomorrow morning.  So as I type this the baby may or may not already be born.  It's an odd feeling really.  I'm excited about becoming and aunt but sad at the same time that I can't be there for my brother and sister-in-law.  I suppose I will be seeing the baby even less than my parents, considering I will be all the way across the county in a matter of weeks.  Actually I take that back.  My sister-in-law's family lives on Long Island, which is only a couple of hours away from Boston.  I'm sure I will be able to see them when they come to visit her folks.  Maybe I won't be as much of a stranger to the baby as I feared.  Well I am expecting a phone call at any moment.  I will let everyone know what happened as soon as I can!

      Strike one against the new receptionist.  She smokes.  She must not smoke very much, but she does.  The only reason I know is that she had a cute little leather case sitting on her desk, and I was naive enough to ask what it was.  I thought it was a case for a cell phone or something.  It turns out it is a sleeve for a pack of cigarettes.  It even has a little pocket for a lighter. If I smoked I would definately want one.  I'm not going to go into a rant about smoking right now.  All I need to say is that in my eyes, her attractiveness has dropped a notch since this morning.  Oh well.  Nobody is perfect.  Kisses - Carrie

      Wow... Short weeks after a holiday weekend sure do fly by.  Big news!  My bro and his wife will be having their baby tomorrow!  I'm gonna be an auntie!  I talked to by bro last nite.  He said that they had gone to the doctor late last week and evidently their baby (supposedly due on the 18th) has not turned.  They have a C-section scheduled for Thursday morning.  I'm so excited!  I'm gonna try and be the kewlest auntie ever!  Time to hit babies-R-us!  On a more selfish note, I'm kinda hoping the new baby will distract my mom from attacking my choice of lifestyle.  Now that I think of it, some of her frustration is probably due to the fact she is about to have her first grandbaby, but it's all the way out in California.  She's probably upset that she will only get to see her (supposedly the baby is a girl) a couple of times a year.  I think my mother has always expected me to produce a "local" grandbaby or two, and obviously that is not going to happen given the direction of my life.  Ugh.  Well I should probably get some work done.  I'll try and post more later!  Kisses - Carrie

      Hey loyal readers...  Sorry for no new postings the past few days.  I did not have a chance to be online much over the holiday weekend.  I was too busy defending myself and my choice of lifestyle against my mom.  All in all a pretty lousy holiday.  At least I got to see my brother.  He had come in from NYC for the long weekend.  Too bad most of it was consumed by my mother being on my case.  I would have never gone up to my parents house at all if he hadn't been there.  I have never officially come out to my parents, but I'm sure they had figured things out on their own.  They aren't stupid.  I guess they felt it was some kind of phase or something.  Actually it's my mother who has the problem with my being gay.  I think my dad just wants me to be happy.  So when I say "they" I actually mean her.  The topic of my choice in lifestyle has never come up until this whole Boston move materialized.  I think my mother finally realized that it was not "just a phase", and she has taken it upon herself to "cure" me or something.  Don't get me wrong... She has often made off-handed passive/aggressive comments towards me the past few years, but she has never openly attacked me until recently.  Like I need anymore stress on my life right now.  Damn...  I'm out of time.  I'm sorry folks - I'll have to finish this later.  I have to run to a meeting.  Who the hell schedules an 8AM meeting the morning after a long holiday weekend?  I'm pretty sure that is illegal.  I hope everyone had a great weekend and I'd love to hear all about them!  Kisses - Carrie

      So I move from the Gulf Coast to New England and the hurricanes still find me.  At least whatever is left of one anyway.  That's what the weatherdudes are forecasting.  We are not too worried.  I doubt there will be much storm left by the time it gets here.  I am overwhelmed by the dozens of submissions for my previous post.  I'm also the Queen of England.  I didn't expect much audience participation but I figured SOMEONE would ask me something.  My counter keeps going up (albeit slowly) so I know people are visiting.  Say something dammit!  Moving on...  S and I are probably about halfway done with the unpacking.  I did the kitchen yesterday so we can finally start cooking at home.  We were getting tired of take-out.  We took a break last night and spent the evening watching the opening ceremonies for the Olympics.  I thought they were very well done.  I was cursing NBC every time they cut away for their damn commercials.  Talk about mood-killers.  They totally disrupted the flow of the whole experience.  I suppose that is to be expected though.  God forbid that 5 minutes pass without a commercial!  We need to get a TIVO ASAFP.  We both loved that big sculpture thing breaking into chunks and floating around the stadium.  That was pretty kewl.  We both thought the torch-lighting part was kinda lame though (S thought the big torch-thing looked like an erection as it was coming down, but then again she has a naughty mind).  Nothing will ever beat whichever one had the flaming arrow light the torch.  I think that was a winter olympic one though (Albertville (sp?) maybe?).  Our other favorite activity was checking out all the hottie athletes in the procession.  I was falling in lust about every 2 minutes (mostly with the women but some of the guys were very cute too).  We were trying to guess what sport they would be doing later in the competition.  And what was up with the uniforms the US team was wearing?  They were quite ugly.  And I want to give Roots a big FU for emblazoning your name on both the hat and the jacket.  I don't remember seeing logos on the outfits of any other teams.  God I hate the commercialization of the Olympics (and this is coming from a marketing major).  Well I better sign off before I really get worked up.  Thanks for reading!

      I got this idea from Sascha's blog (thanks Sash!)(Yes plagarism is still alive and well, but is it still plagarism if you credit the source?  I don't remember how to do a proper bibliography anymore)  Anyway, here it is:   I want everyone who reads this to ask me 3 questions, no more no less. Ask me anything you want, even if it's extremely personal. I DON'T CARE. It's part of the fun. Then I want you to go to your journal, copy and paste this allowing your friends (including myself) to ask you anything.   So there it is folks - ask away!  Interactive entertainment at it's finest!

      The movers finally made it.  It took them long enough!  I was really really really getting sick of sitting on the floor or the kitchen counter.  We broke down and bought some cheap folding chairs on Tuesday, but they were not very comfortable.  I was starting to have fantasises involving just sitting on a nice comfy couch.  How sad is that?  We will also be happy to sleep in a real bed.  The air matress we had was just not cutting it.  Whenever one of us would move or roll-over the other one would practically be bounced off the other side.  Not good.  Bonking your head on a hardwood floor at 3am is never fun unless there are interesting sexual positions involved.  Now that our stuff is here I suddenly have plenty to do.  Sandy has been keeping pretty busy with school-related stuff, but I literally had nothing to do until today.  Now there are boxes to unpack and decorating to do!  Whoo hoo! (more the decorating part than the unpacking part).  I hate unpacking but I love decorating.  I just wish we had some money to spend doing it.  Oh well.  I will just have to make due with what we have.  Gotta run!  Boxes beckon!  Kisses - Carrie

      Wow S really knows her stuff.  She fixed my formatting problem in no time.  No wonder she used to get paid the big bucks.  I had no idea what she was doing but it worked, and that's the important thing.  She will be well rewarded... hehehe.  I would like to give some love out to our new upstairs neighbors.  They are allowing us to share their internet connection for a few days until we get ours up and running.  Thanks guys!  As soon as the movers show up with our pots and pans I'll make you some brownies or something.  Well we are in our new place but there is not a lot we can do until the movers get here.  We went out and got a bunch of cleaning stuff today so we can give the place a good washing before our stuff shows up and gets in the way.  I'm always scared moving into a new place.  Who knows what kind of person the previous tenant was?  That's not something I want to think about very hard.  Well I would say I'm heading off to bed but since we do not have ours yet I guess I have to say I'm heading off to pallet!  Goodnight everybody!  Kisses - Carrie

      Well we finally made it to Boston (well, Waltham anyway).  We have to sign the papers and get the keys to our new place tomorrow.  Our furniture and other stuff won't be here for a few more days, so I guess we are sleeping on the floor until then.  The past couple of days have been tough.  Nothing like driving 500+ miles three days in a row.  I am in serious need of a good stretching workout.  Sitting in a car for hours and hours on end really starts to bug me.  I don't know how those long-distance truckdrivers do it.  The long hours in the car together were very good for us relationship-wise.  It was the first time in weeks we had to really really talk.  It was good being able to vent our frustrations and anxieties (sp?) to each other.  I think we both really needed it.  We are now ready to take on whatever challenges await us.  Challenge #1 for me would be FINDING A JOB.  We did make a mistake of not packing enough CD's with us in the car.  We only had the 6 that were in S's CD changer.  After hearing those same 6 CD's about 30 times we finally had to stop and buy some new ones.  We stopped at a Wal-Mart in some BFE town to see what they had.  That was a mistake.  Their selection was crap.  I had been in a somewhat Euro-pop mood, but amazingly enough they don't have much of a selection of that in Podunk, North Carolina or whereever the hell we were.  After I bit the head off of some poor sales idiot for confusing the Stone Roses with the Stone Temple Pilots (hello?) we made due with a couple of compilation discs (like "Hits of the 80's" or something like that).  That was fun.  We thought about putting the top down and singing along as we drove, but that's not much fun when you are speeding along at 85 mph.  Just to let you know, we do not have internet (or phone) service set up yet so I will not be fully online for a few more days.  I will have to make due with some other means of internet access.  I'm hoping there will be a Starbucks or some other Wireless Access Point near our apartment so that I can connect that way.  I figure there are several places like that in Harvard Square, and that is only a couple of blocks from our new place.  Well its getting late and it has been a long day.  I think I'm gonna hit the shower and curl up in bed with S.  I'll post again soon!  Kisses - Carrie

      Hiya Peeps!  This is gonna be a quickie today. We have to get back on the road in a few minutes. We stayed the night in Atlanta. We are not quite as far as we were hoping but that's mostly due to getting a late start on Tuesday. We had to do some last-minute stuff before we left so we did not leave town until noon or so. Then we had to stop somewhere near Beaumont to vacuum out the car thanks to a bag of chips that exploded when I tried to open them. I guess I don't know my own strength! We did not feel like sitting in shards of cool ranch doritos for 1800 miles so we found a carwash and sucked out the car.  Thanks to all the delays we were only able to make it to Baton Rouge that night. We tried to make up some time by driving 500-something miles to Atlanta. We could have gone further but we were both getting kinda zoned after 8 hours in the car, so we decided to stop and find a place to stay the night.  Well I am paying for this by the minute so I'm gonna sign off. I miss everyone and I will try and post a better update at our next stop!  Kisses - Carrie
