      Wow, where do I start? I have been spending the past couple of years thinking about what I have become, and how I have got were I am today? It is so amazing to me and at the same time unbelievable. While I don't have piles of money or a college degree even for that matter. I have done outstandingly well. I have a great job were I make more money then I ever imagine just 5 years ago? Here I shall take you back to the days of high school. I come from a small town of about 12,000 people (less then what is in the pentagon on any given day) and as you might imagine everyone knew everyone and was always someone in your business. I had my selected few friends and instead of being like most other kids in my school I was from a fairly poor family. While others drove around in there hondas and trucks with their 4 wheelers and motor cycles I was stuck trying to get a job to buy a little 1978 ford bronco II. I was not exactly popular although everyone knew me not too many particularly cared to. When I was 16 my mother began to leave my step and I was kind of left to fend for my self bouncing from friends house to friends house from couch to couch it was odd how it all worked it seemed my friends and my ex girl friend's parents all seemed to care for me more then my own parents?!? They all loved me or at lest they said they did. Then one day I met a new friend who was about 5 years my senior. He was nice and had a hefty appetite for beer as did I so we got along great. I began going there daily and before you knew it we had a group of about ten of us we became well known for fighting for any reason you could come up with it just didn't matter to us what the reason was. A couple of friends of mine became worried one of them being my friend Jake. Jake was on of my friends who I thought would be most likely to succeed. As well as many of my other friends who all had money set aside for college and had there future set me on the other hand had nothing no money no plans not a damn thing but an ability to drink and till 2am and still make it to class . Now back to the present. Here I am making a living and able to by at least some of the finer things in life. And all those friend who had it all (in my eyes). Have little more then a high school education. I don't quite understand it, Well I mean I do but it is all so surreal to me. I once was a man begging for any car that I could get and now I am a man who gets mad if I get sub standard service at enterprise!?! The thing that bothers me most is that I was not suppressed by no one nor was I taunted or teased, I may have been looked down on or what ever but I never really thought I cared till this past year when I have had an overwhelming feeling of wanting to go back and show people what I have done with my self. Is it arrogance that drives me or is this just natural? I am so confused as to why I would even want to see those people who didn't care about me or all those who did, why would I feel the need to try to ?Justify? Myself and my being? If I don't care then why? I guess some where I do care?  CK "It's not what you know it's who you know."

      "What do you mean you are still going to talk to him?" This is how it all starts when it comes to my wife with concern in my "Friends." Here I will give a brief over view. I have two friends that I consider my "bestest good friends" as a matter of fact my first son is named after them Jayson and Jaycob. Jake on one hand is a reserved well thought out kind of person (he rarely makes good decisions in life for himself in the past anyway) and then there is Jayson the loud obnoxious, egotistical, arrogant,pompous, pig.... You get the idea. He from what Jake and myself can gather has to have a mental condition, for he is absolutely convinced that every woman either wants him or he has been with and on top of that he tries to live like we did in high school (drink all night, hook up with just about anyone, fight just for the fun of it, among other things I rather not reveal at this point ;) ) . But, all that aside he is still like a brother to Jake and myself, at least that is what we consider each other as. So here is the deal, Jake and myself both have relationships and Jason does to but the difference is that he has little respect for his girls feels and is more then happy to talk about all the woman he has been with right in front of her. That is no biggie because that is his relation and whatever he does there is fine. The problem comes in when he disagrees with someone i.e. our misses. He is an @$$ hole and tends to go off with a vengeance. While Jake and I have grown to deal with his horrible behavior they have not and then as if they are not pissed enough at him then they come to us talking about how they hate him and expect us to do something. This is the part where it gets sticky. He is our "Bro" and I know he is a total @$$ hole, but you know what he has been there when no one else was and for that I will never stop talking to him nor will Jake.
