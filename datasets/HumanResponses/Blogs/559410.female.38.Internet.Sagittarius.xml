      I'm alone in the office today, doing the last bit of packing.  Once this is done, I'll have Saturday and Sunday to relax a bit before getting on the plane Monday at 5pm.  I'm really looking forward to some down time, I must say.

      The movers are here today and it's freaking me out.  Two days had been scheduled for this move, but it looks like they are nearly done.  Tomorrow, the Salvation Army is coming to pick up the furniture, etc. that I'm not taking.  Almost done...

      More pictures... My sister Karen and my nephew Blake came to New York for a visit.  It was the week-end after I got back from Copenhagen, so I was pretty jet lagged and had lots of work to do.  Karen and Blake dropped me off at the office after brunch...Blake, who is seven, didn't want to leave...I got him hooked on to Bionicle.  When they left, they went straight to FAO Swartz to buy some Bohrok.   Karen took some great pictures of the view outside the windows of the LEGO Direct office.  Not the same view I'll have in  urlLink Billund ...    urlLink

      The movers are coming on Wednesday, but instead of packing I decided to post the pictures from my last trip to Denmark.  About three weeks ago, there was a Bionicle team meeting in  urlLink Copenhagen  that Jeremy (who works with me on bionicle.com) and I attended.  The day before the meeting, we visited  urlLink Little Device  who is developing a new game for the site, and had dinner with Dan, Anders and Nils.    urlLink     The next night, after the Bionicle meeting, everyone went to dinner.  It ended up being quite a fun night.     urlLink

      Thursday night was the big LEGO going away party at the  urlLink Screening Room .  My co-worker, Danny, is going back to Billund and his last day in NY is next week too, so it was a combined send off.  Of course, I ended up getting pretty mushy (I'm really going to miss seeing my friends in this office), but not quite as mushy as Danny...      urlLink

      As I was starting to pack this week-end, not only did I produce 5 garbage bags full of clothes and shoes to get rid of, I found some old pictures of Jim and I back in the Day.  This picture was taken at a club opening in 1993.  I don’t remember which club... it’s when I was working at New York Magazine and I had a press pass… *sigh*

      I was going over the Brooklyn Bridge tonight, and looked back to see the "tribute of lights".  Rationally, I understand it.  But the glow at "ground zero" only makes me think of the days and weeks after the attack.  It makes me remember, so intensely, the shock, fear and sadness I felt when it happened.  I know there are many people who have been much more effected by this than I have, and have lost people they knew and loved.  I can't imagine.  Even without any personal loss, I can't seem to get back to normal.     People seem to be amazed that I can leave New York for a place that’s...well... out of the way.   I’m fine with moving to a place doesn’t have skyscrapers that people want to fly into.  I’m fine with a place that’s a little less “exciting” than New York city.

      My first week in Denmark...  I've been staying in Billund this week, at a place called Gravh&#248ven, which is impossible to pronounce and apparently means "tomb" in English.   I have a bedroom/bath in a 4 room dorm (sharing a living room and kitchen).  Right now, there are only 3 of us living there, a guy from LEGO in Enfield, CT and someone who works for Avis.     This week-end, I went to  urlLink Kolding  to look at an apartment and check out the city.  It's about 40 K from Billund and it has a castle that's about 700 years old.  I’ve decided to take the apartment and I may be able to move in next week... my furniture won’t show up until the end of April, but I wouldn't be in the "tomb" anymore...    Saturday night, Sanne took me out in Vejle with lots of other LEGO expats...it was so much fun that I only remembered that I had my camera for one picture...     urlLink

      I thought this was worth a blog.  It turns out that I am only 46% bitch, which according to thespark.com is still 72% higher than most people.  The only consolation I have is that Tomas Clark is a bigger bitch than I am (48%).    urlLink The Spark  is a site with lots of fun tests like that.  The main test is  urlLink The Personality Test , and according to that I'm a bitch too...no, actually, I'm a POLITICIAN ( Dominant Extroverted Abstract Thinker ).

      While playing with iPhoto, I realized that I could export my photos to a QT slideshow movie.  And, I could add one of my MP3s from iTunes.  I love  urlLink Apple .  The only problem is that it's 5.5M, so it may take awhile to download.  Don't do it if you're on dial-up.

      I was hoping that my last three week trip to the states would be the last of my business travelling for 2002, but no such luck.  At least I got to see lots of friends and family.

      Here are some of the pictures from last month and my trek through the states (only a couple eastern and midwestern ones).  There are pictures of my niece, Constance (below) and my nephew, Blake.    There's a also a picture of the flowers that Lars sent me while I was in New York by myself and pictures of us at the Lousianna museum (just outside Copenhagen) the day before his birthday.  When went to dinner at Soren K in the  urlLink Black Diamond library  in Copenhagen (great suggestion, thanks Dan!) and saw a Duran Duran jam.  Fun.  I spent my birthday, yesterday, in all day meetings and on a plane.  Boo-hoo.  But Lars has planned a trip for us in Prague as my birthday present!  Yay!    urlLink

      Lars and I had the cheeziest New Year's Eve ever in Hurgada, Egypt.  We went to a party in a big tent, with musicans, belly dancers and food that made us ill for days and days. Here are pictures of the entire trip to Eygpt.   urlLink     Despite our sickness, we did get to go to Ciaro for two days and see all kinds of old stuff.  I even went in the Great Pyramid of Giza!

      As I mentioned in an earlier blog, my birthday present from Lars was a trip to Prague on Valentine's Day week-end.  Prague is a great city, but it was so amazingly COLD.

      Lars and I just returned from a week of meetings in Toyko and Seoul.  We got the rare opportunity to look around a little in both places, and it worked out that we had an extra day in Korea for sightseeing.  In addition to visiting a shooting range, we took a tour of the Demilitarized Zone on the border of North and South Korea.  It was rather eye opening, since my only real reference to the Korean war is M*A*S*H... it was also a bit surreal and certainly put a new spin on the current situation in North Korea for me...     urlLink    The Bridge of Freedom in Korea

      I finally made it to Madrid to see Jim and Emmanuelle, just in the nick of time.  In addition to being shown around the city and a side trip to beautiful Toledo, I got to see both Jim and Emmanuelle's studios and I am now a proud owner of a Jim Kendall painting (a long-time dream come true).  Unfortunately, Lars couldn't come with me (he had to work), the only thing missing while having a wonderful time with good friends.   urlLink

      Lars and I (mostly Lars, since it was my first) had a traditional Danish Easter lunch for a few friends on April 18th, and we took a couple of pictures... there are also many of pictures of the house we are buying!  These were taken before the deal was finalized, which is going on now.  As you can see by the pictures, it's a fixer upper and we have a lot work a head of us.    urlLink

      With just 13 days before we move into the house, it's a bit frantic.  Lars has been working very hard on the kitchen, and it shows.  By the end of the week, we'll have the granite counter installed, new windows and a nearly completed kitchen.   It doesn't look likely that the bathroom will be anywhere near done, but we both have two weeks holiday from work after we move so we'll have time to get everything in order before resuming our normal lives... but once we get the inside done (or done enough for the time being), we'll move on to the outside and the garden.    Lots of new pictures, take a look!   urlLink

      When I got home after being away for work for two weeks, so much progress had been made on the house!  It's really starting to come together.  All the hardwood floors had been sanded, and Lars had been busy putting up molding in the bedrooms and gutting the kitchen.  The kitchen and the bathroom are the big rennovation jobs we still have to complete before we move in (in mid July, so not much time left!).  Lars is doing most of the work on the kitchen himself, right now, in fact.  I need to get over there to help out and continue removing tile from the bathroom walls, oof.   I also took some pictures of the utility room and the garage, which I haven't shown here before.   These new pictures just give some different views of the house.  More to come before the week-end is out.    urlLink

      We are now officially home owners!  We had the keys to the house before everything was final and started working... We started by cleaning everything and painting the bedrooms.  In the main bedroom, we ripped out the closet and Lars has since built a new one and ordered new sliding doors.  Both of us will have a room for an office. We spent one beautiful Sunday afternoon mowing the lawn and trimming the hedges, but the garden and lawn are definitely phase 2.   This group of pictures are about a month old now, and since then we've painted the living room and all of the wood floors have been resanded.  Apparently there is no kitchen right now, Lars has ripped it all out in preparation for our NEW kitchen (I'm currently traveling for business, so I got out of having to remove wallpaper--yay)... and we get new windows in a few weeks.  More work in progress pictures will be posted soon.    urlLink

      The past few months have been incredibly busy and I've been neglecting my blog terribly.  I do have some updates, including pictures of the bathroom as it's being remodelled.    In July, Lars and I went to the Grøn concert ( urlLink where Suede performed ) and I took some pictures.   urlLink     I also have pictures of the bathroom from a few weeks ago.  We've enlarged the bathroom, taking some space from the utility room.  It's been quite a process, but we're getting close to having a nice bathroom.  Yay!

      The past few weeks have been cold, rainy, difficult and emotional.   Work has been... more frustrating than usual (as per my previous post).  But today is a bank holiday in Denmark, which makes for a much needed long week-end.  The holiday is Whitsun, which is another name for Pentecost, and is held on the seventh Sunday after Easter.  It's a holiday in a number of European countries.  And the weather has been glorious!  Last Sunday I ran a 5K race (Lars ran the 10K version of the same race), which has gotten me inspired really start running again.  I have a 5K route through the forest near our house and with this wonderful weather it's been a great revitilizing experience.  I walked the route yesterday and took some pictures.   urlLink     It's good to remember there's more to life than LEGO...

      Lars and I hosted a party for the BIONICLE team in April.  It was while shooting the extra footage for the DVD, so everyone was around.  This was just before everything started going to hell, but just after I found out that it would.  The changes that have been made on the team were the worst possible changes... definitely for me personally, but I also think for BIONICLE in general.    Well, it was an amazing thing to be a part of for the past four years.  I believe that time has come to run, not walk, to my next adventure.  Very sad.   urlLink     The producer of the extra DVD content, Pam, has a very cool blog herself  urlLink foo.fa.raw.net

      Every Wednesday, I get my  urlLink Real Astrology  fix via email. Rob Brezsny has a gift for creating amusing, thought provoking and quirky horoscopes. I'm determined to make this week's come true.  I'm overdue for some excessive laughing...  SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21):  urlLink Laughter Yoga  is a new international phenomenon that began in India. Practitioners gather together regularly to engage in half-hour sessions of nonstop chuckling, chortling, and cackling. Yogic breathing exercises supplement the therapeutic value. The month of June will be an ideal time for you Sagittarians to launch local branches of these Laughter Clubs. The astrological omens say you'll be running into an extraordinary number of funny things. That's lucky for you, because you have a lot of accumulated tension to purge, and the best way to do that is by having hilarious experiences.
