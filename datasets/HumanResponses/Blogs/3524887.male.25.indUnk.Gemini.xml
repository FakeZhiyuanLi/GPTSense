       Holland vs Sweden  26/06/04 KO 0245 --->Hat-Trick Challange! Sweden are trouble with some injury to first team players. Anyway the Sweden's bench had lot of talent and quailty lads which will be ready to field up any hole in the squad. Holland on the other side was in better situation when going for selection of players, everyone want to play! Holland is on fire again and prove that they can be so dangerous when they can play together as a team and playing to the coach's tactic. Sweden is unbeaten as they are lucky not to lost against the Italy and Denmark which they managed to grap the equaliser in the last few minutes. Sweden and Holland have lot of good offensive players and they perform better when playing attacking football. Larsson and Van Nistelrooy should get their on the scoresheet. Should expect more goals in this game. As it always say, never change a winning team (Sweden's injury problem and Holland's stars selection problem). Team performance should depend on selection of players for tonight game.   PR: Expect Holland to win.  Result:  Holland vs Sweden

       France vs Greece  26/06/04 KO 0245 --->Shocker! France finally played a game that had pleased everyone and advance to this quarter-final match with the surprising Greece. France was still not impressive during the the win over Swiss but they had improved and getting much better in shape. Greece play a tough group matches and have beat the host Portugal and draw with Giant Spain. They lost to Russia 1-2 but fight back to score a goal for advancement. Seem like Greece play better and have more luck to play against Giant team. France will be much happier to meet the Greece but a little mistake from the defence could cost them the game as their defence seem to be unstable. Greece need to perform another counter-attacking tactic in order to shock the holder which I believe they are capable of.  PR: Receiving +ball will be recommended.  Result:  France 0-1 Greece

       Portugal vs England  25/06/04 KO 0245 --->Future stars shine! Both Portugal and England managed to win two matches in a row after losing their opening match. With so much young and exprience talents in both squad, both look equally strong and tough. Portugal may have the advantage of playing host with so many Portugese cheering than the English but most Portugal's stars are still not in very good form yet. England's form is peaking after matches and matches and seem like they are in very good state now. Once again Rooney will need his good form to find the winner for England and if he does, England wil stand a very good chance for the semi-final. Portugal need to play at the standard they play against Spain in the last game and they need to stop wasting chances which they are during the Group stage. If both countries are willing to start with attcking tactics then it will be a match not to be missed!  PR: Winner to decide in extra time.   Result:  Portugal 2-2AFT PK(8-7) England

       Germany vs Czech Republic  24/06/04 KO 0245 --->So tough German! After playing so hard and without luck in the last game against the hardworking Latvia, German are in a difficult position. They need to avoid defeat to have the chance to qualify for next round. The German got to play hard in their defence in order not to conceed to the already qualify Czech. Czech might be fielding only some first team players in this game but definitely their bench players are still very good players that have the required standard in the squad. Without their first team defenders playing at the back, Czech may conceed but their attacking pressure must not be neglected. Germany need to win to qualify and all will depend on how Voller play his tactic tonight.    PR: Germany to draw. Receiving +ball will be recommended  Result:  Germany 1-2 Czech Republic    Holland vs Latvia  24/06/04 KO 0245 --->Winner takes all! Both team need to win and hope Germany's failure to beat Czech for a place in the last eight. With so many world class players in the Dutch squad but they still have not played together and perform as a world class team. Holland are capable to beat Latvia in any meeting but not this time round. Holland are in lot of pressure at the moment and surely they cannot play as their usual standard. Latvia are in very good form with their shinning star striker Verpakovskis on fire, they might have a chance to make history. Very fast in counter-attcking and against the full attacking Holland tonight, their tactic will be more useful than any other game. Not to forget, if Holland draw with Latvia and Czech crash Germany, Holland might advance.  PR: Latvia to win. Receiving +ball will be recommended  Result:  Holland 3-0 Latvia

       Croatia vs England  22/06/04 KO 0245 --->Defending Fortress! Did England really play very well against the Swiss in the last game? I personally do not think so. Maybe only Rooney did play at his very best which lead England to win. Croatia played very well against the holder France but was unlucky not to keep their lead and will have to defeat England to qualify for the next round. Croatia will have the chance to win if they can keep pressing on England and shooting the ball on target. This requried fitness and team flair which Croatia do not really do possess. England to play defence and draw goaless? I hope they do not apply to this tactic as I do not trust James. Croatia will have to play more attacking tactic which it suit the England counter-attcking style. England can win if they can score and lead in the first half.   PR: England to win.  Result:  Croatia 2-4 England    Switzerland vs France  22/06/04 KO 0245 --->Undefeated must go on! France need to stay undefeated to qualify. They have stayed 20 international game undefeated and could this be the end of the run. Switzerland can play with everything they have now as they do not have any choice. Do it or die game, just like Croatia. Must operate in attacking mode until they scored. Still can't find the net in this tournament yet and I believe they will in this game. France are still not finding the form which lead them in world cup 98 and euro 2000. They are slow and lack of fitness but luck is on their side which help them lead the table. Unless they find their form back in this game if not, I believe Switzerland may destroy the France's run. I think a small wage on Switzerland to win the over-rated France can be a option.  PR: France to draw. Receiving +ball will be recommended.  Result:  Switzerland 1-3 France

       Russia vs Greece  21/06/04 KO 0245 --->Russia roulette may row the last time. Russia was out of the tournament after losing to host nation Portugal. This time round pressure is on Greece. Russia may play more comfortable in this game with any pressure and thus display better football. Greece just need to avoid defeat and may qualify for the next round. So will Greece still choose to play defensive tactic and allow the Russian to bombard them? All knows that Greece perform better when they are the underdog and not the favorite, therefore there may have a twist in scenario this time round. Russia are surely not as weak as they seem too be if they really playing with ore confident and less pressure. Tonight Russia may break the duck and hit a few balls into the back of Greece's net. Greece may get the job done if they could find the net and lead by half-time.  PR: Russia to win. Receiving +ball will be recommended.  Result:  Russia 2-1 Greece    Spain vs Portugal  21/06/04 KO 0245 --->Portugal on the mission Finally the much awaiting game in Group A has arrived! Whoever win will qualify for the next round. Surely result from the other game between Russia and Greece will affect the outcome on this fixture. Hard to comment what will happen for the outcome now but both teams must be preparing some winning formula for sure. Portugal look sharp again when they finally won a game and put them a step into the final eight. Spain in the other has taken a step back as they failed to hold their nerves and let Greece stole the important equalising goal. Both team suffered in the hand of Greece. Portugal surely need the win more badly than Spain and if they are confident and with home crowds fully behind them, they may emerge as the winner. Spain will have better chance if Russia can do them a favour by beating the odds in which they still could afford to lose by close margin result. Time for Real Madrid's galatico Luis Figo and Raul to battle it out!  PR: Portugal to qualify. Letting -ball will be recommended.  Result:  Spain 0-1 Portugal

       Latvia vs Germany  19/06/04 KO 2359 --->Germany march on! After a superb performace from Germany from the last game, they had proved that Germany is still a tough competitor in this tournament. Latvia was unlucky to throw away the only goal they scored in the first half and ended up with nothing after the final whistle. Latvia do not look too good in defence and against the tough German, they have to rely on their speedy counter attack. If Latvia can sneak a couple of goals, they might be the three pointer instead but I doubt they can do it this time. Germany is on fire now. They have been criticized for some poor display in friendies and seem hopeless for this tournament earlier on. The German will only be the one who know what they are made of and I believe they will rise to ocasion and display one of their best performace tonight game against the lowly rated Latvia.  PR: Germany to take lead by half-time. Letting -ball will be recommended.  Result:  Latvia 0-0 Germany    Holland vs Czech Republic  20/06/04 KO 0245 --->Battle up once more. Holland and Czech have met twice before this tournament and ended with a draw and a win for Czech. With dismay in the Holland's camp which have affected the standard of their football diaplay. Czech was lucky not lose and instead gain all three points from Latvia with their determination display. If Czech got the determination and the formula that they use to beat Holland, they can do it again. Don't forget Czech's Rene Bolf, Zdenek Grygera, Jan Koller, Pavel Nedved and Tomas Rosicky are suffering illness and injury. Responsiblity may rely on Vladimir Smicer. Holland have some injured players back in contention and selection for the first eleven may prove crucial for Holland's qualification chance. Holland's coach Dick Advocaat facing huge pressure now will have to re-shuffle their playing tactic to play better football in order not to suffer any lost of points again.  PR: Czech clinching the winner. Receiving +ball will be recommended  Result:  Holland 2-3 Czech Republic

       Bulgaria vs Denmark  18/06/04 KO 2359 --->Rumble match Bulgaria can't afford to lose this encounter with Denmark. Both team need the 3 points to have hope of going into the next round. Bulgaria attack was a positive one but lost of confident and lack of mental strength in defence during the match with Sweden has make Bulgaria look really bad now. I believed those Bulgarian will understand the situation they are in now. As for the Danes, they miss the points against Italy which they should have won. They got to play with the standard or even better against Italy if they do want get into a must win situation for the last group game against Sweden. If Bulgaria do not tighten up their defence, Denmark should have not problem finding the net a few times. I believe the Bulgarian will make life difficult for the Danes surely.  PR: Denmark to get the winner. Letting -ball will be recommended.  Result:  Bulgaria 0-2 Denmark    Italy vs Sweden  19/06/04 KO 0245 --->Heated match! Italy had lost Toti and Del Piero's is having all the pressure now. It may be a good sign for Italy to play with only one playermarker rather than two. They got to knock in goals tonight if they do not wish to pack their bags and ready to leave Portugal. Basically Italy did nothing wrong in defence line expect they seem too be tired running under hot sun. Maybe playing at a later time might help them a bit. Sweden, the first team to score 5 goals in this tournament so far. Very good team work and confident whenever they have procession in opposite half. Larsson is still so sharp as ever and Ibrahimovic will have to perform at his peak in order to unlock the steel lock of Italy.  PR: Basically a typical draw game! Receiving +ball will be recommended  Result:  Italy 1-1 Sweden

       England vs Switzerland  17/06/04 KO 2359 --->No more mercy! Switzerland was lucky to have the one point after they were playing with just 10 men against Croatia in the last match. Swiss seem to have improve in their overall play but still lack the lethal finishing. Swiss's defence may seem strong but they were merely lucky not to have concede any goal yet. If they want to win this game, they have to rely on their strikers as both had not scored for a long time. England was unlucky not to take any point from the showdown last game. Defensively they are up to task but their goalkeeper was really in a bad shape. Any more mistakes from James could end England chance for the next round. If England can perform the way they did in the first half against the mighty France, they could win this game. Owen and Rooney should be fully fit after being substituted in the last game.  PR: England to win by a goal.  Result:  England 3-0 Switzerland    Croatia vs France  18/06/04 KO 0245 --->Champion to next round? Defensive style of Croatia had failed to take the advantage of 10 men Swiss and being held back for scoreless draw. France did not perform at their world class standard but was lucky enough to top the table. The defending champion will go into the next round if they manage to beat the determined Croatia's defence line. Croatia may surprise France if they can score the opener and defend till 90 mins which they are capable of. Match will go either way if no one take the lead by half-time. There is news from Croatia camp that they want to rest some of their important players for the last game against England. Will that mean France will have a comfortable win or just some news to disturb their opponent mentality.  PR: Croatia! Receiving +ball will be recommended.  Result:  Croatia 2-2 France

       Greece vs Spain  16/06/04 KO 2359 --->Revenge matchup Spain will have all the reason to win tonight game against the improving Greece. After denying Spain victories in both qualifying games, Greece will have all the confident they wanted for so long. The Greek has proved to the world that luck from their side have made them look one of the most likely underdog to going forward into the next round. As for Spain, let hope their poor history of displaying world class football in major tournament do not haunt them again. They can win this game easily if they can manage to score a couple of goals in the first 45 minutes. Will Greece perform a mixture of luck and determination to deny Spain confident? Early goals from Spain will do the job nice n clean. Don't forget that whoever win will book a place in next round for sure.  PR: Spain to lead at half-time. Letting -ball will be recommended.  Result:  Greece 1-1 Spain    Russia vs Portugal  17/06/04 KO 0245 --->Fire up Portuguese! What else can you say when these Russian have to face host nation after playmarker had been send home. Russia's coach has lost respect from his players and many still think they can't do any better without their best and experienced midfielder. If Portugal do not take up the 3 points, they will almost facing exit from the tournament. Host nation still have their home fans cheering for them and hoping Portugal will fire up at this moment. They do have a squad of talent and experience players all round who can lift their play to the peak. Last word! Portugal have to win of they want to get into the next round. Russian cannot rely on the defensive tactic against the Portugese anymore. Early goals from Portugal may help them to build more confident before going into second half.  PR: Portugal to lead at half-time. Letting -ball will be recommended.  Result:  Russia 0-2 Portugal

       Czech Republic vs Latvia  15/06/04 KO 2359 --->Red Knight war cried! Czech are having pressure at the moment. They not only need to win this game but also to win in great style. A team that had peak since last year, good or bad? Well at least the mighty Czech had beaten big names in europe in the qualifier and some friendly. Strong from midfield to attack, Czech will attack and score goals rather than playing defensive no matter if they are leading or not. Latvia had stunned most soccer fans after taking up a slot in this tournament. They play defensive in most of their games and had most of the result they wanted. Counter attacking style of play is the only weapon Latvia has in their coach's tactics book. Fitness may be the factor to decide if Latvia can overcome the huge odds on them. Czech will have to score earlier goals to deny being upset in this game.    PR: Czech will gun down the underdog. Letting -ball will be recommended.  Result:  Czech Republic 2-1 Latvia    Holland vs Germany  16/06/04 KO 0245 --->World War 2  "Group of Death", exit of Hollamd or Germany to be decided in this game? With all the world class strikers all available for Holland at the moment, they have the craftier attacking style in europe. As for Germany, their thrifty defence will have a huge montain to climb to prevent any shot hitting onto the back of their net. Germany will still rely on their old but reliable defenders to accomplish the task. Holland have problem in their camp and team spirit seems very low as recent international friendlies has shown. Holland fail to score any goal and lost two games with a 1-0 results. Germany can't do any better as they flop in recent friendlies too. But will experience of the old German deny the total football of Dutch?  PR: Draw is more appropriate for this game. Receiving +ball will be recommended.    Result:  Holland 1-1 Germany

       Italy vs Denmark  14/06/04 KO 2359 --->Defend rumble Italy and Denmark are well known for their defensive tactic. Denmark seem like will be missing a few important players tonight. Just hope they don't lose their original tactic if they want to deny the odds on them. Italy seem like perfect in this tournament. Don't forget what the Italian are capable of, wait and wait before scoring a goal. If both team know they could not afford to lose their opening games, outcome will be only one. Statemate!  PR: Draw is more appropriate for this game. Receiving +ball will be recommended.  Result:  Italy 0-0 Denmark    Sweden vs Bulgaria  15/06/04 KO 0245 --->Return of the legend What Sweden has been missing for is the key man in the attack. Henrik Larsson. What more do you want from Sweden when they have proved their strength in the backline and toughness midfield players. They can play and win games with only a goal in the last few months but all are without Larrson. Bulgaria in another point of view is a lucky team to have quailfy for this tournament. Lack of fitness in their attacking and defence could cause them the failure to overcome the Sweden penetration attack. If only Bulgaria could be as lucky as Greece to score an early goal, Sweden will celebrate when referee blow his final whistle.  PR: Back the Sweden in all aspect. Letting -ball will be recommended.  Result:  Sweden 5-0 Bulgaria

       Croatia vs Switzerland  13/06/04 KO 2359 --->The battle of underdog Swiss has not perform well in their last few international friendly matches which lack the type of determination that Swiss bring themselves to quailfy for this tournament. Defence had not been a problem for the Swiss expect slow passing in midfield make the Swiss look weak in holding possesion. In other words, they seldom control the game and have to rely on the back four. Croatia seem to get on form at the right moment.Croatia in all look more complete and could really go far if fitness and injury do not hit them. They do have big names playing in major european team and thus make them look more favourite in this showdown. Croatia really can perform well in tournament as record shown. If Swiss still have not tighten up the midfield line by tonight, they will be the prey for the Croatia.   PR: Croatia to go with the odds. Letting -ball will be recommended.  Result:  Croatia 0-0 Switzerland    France vs England  14/06/04 KO 0245 --->Premiership Champion against England France's trio Veira, Pires and Henry have know England's players playing style by heart. This can help them for this game. In other words, France can be the one celebrating if luck do not help England a bit. France seldom lose their matches ever sice they are crowned as world champion but of course draw may not be avoid. Rooney is the key in this game. He can be the one who can win this opening game for England if he can perform at his peak. England backline is fragile which could cause them the game if France can find the net early in this game. Don't forget England always perform better when they are the underdog.  PR: Draw is more appropriate for this game. Receiving +ball will be recommended.  Result:  France 2-1 England

       Portugal vs Greece  12/06/04 KO 2359  --->Home team against a fast improved team in last 6 months.  Greece has shown improvement in away matches since their last failure to go into WC2002. Pratically a proven giant killing team in their home of Greek. Advantage on playing in hot weather and always perform well against the odds in the qualifying round especially against the mighty Spainards. As for Portugal, home soil advantage can be the winning factor in this opening game. With Figo, Rui Costa, Jorge Costa and various stars playing in big european team, they will perform well if they can forget what had happened two years back in Korea. Young players from the European Cup winners FC Porto will have all the confidence to perform at the peak of their talent. Don't forget Solari still have the winning formula that he bring back the world cup for Brazil in the last world cup.   PR: Greece to hold Portugal for a goaless result or a narrow win for the home teams. Receiving +ball will be recommended.  Result:  Portugal 1-2 Greece    Spain vs Russia  13/06/04 KO 0245 --->Neutral ground match up Don't even think Spain will be playing at home standard in this game against the big-sized roulette as the Spainard will most likely lose all the high ball challenge in this game. Russian will overcome the odds if the central mastermind Mostovio and side wizard Karpin could deliver world class passes into the Spainard safeguard area. Spain, a born loser in major tournament, might break the curse again. They did show the world in last world cup but without experienced backline hold by Hierro(retired) and company, this could be another upset for the Spanish supporters if the new backline failed to clear the high balls bombarded by the Russian troop. Just a trick from Morientes can bring glory to Spain if he's not properly man-marked.  PR: A 50-50 game in my opinion and odds for Russia has hugh return. Receiving +ball will be recommended.  Result:  Spain 1-0 Russia
