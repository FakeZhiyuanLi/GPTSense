						       I find that my thoughts take me to many different places while I'm lying in bed for hours, looking at the lights that dance behind my eyelids, uncomfortable and overhot or cold by turns as I shift around within the soft sheets that feel like sandpaper...I can't vouch for the coherency of this post...its basically what I often do on paper...but I felt like feeling the keyboard under my fingers...so you get treated to my midnight...well one-o-clock...ramblings. Oh...and in case there was any doubt they started from the first word.  This is what I do when I can't sleep I just follow my thoughts...wherever they take me. And I find its a lot easier to get them out of my head, so I can ignore them and get some sleep, if I write them down. It makes for the need to regularly take a pile of papers out of my room to recycle...when I get around to it...when I decide my room has reached the point of clutter just past messy and into slovenly...whatever that's supposed to mean  well I can see that my meanderings seem to have even less of a point than usual...lucky anyone who's decided to try and read this...its why I called my website Random Musings...seeing as it was created...and developed and added to only during these non-coherent, tired, but completely unable to sleep episodes...Which, by the way, I reformatted and added a guestbook to right before beginning this diatribe...  The world, it seems to me has begun to move in two opposite directions...its really almost a paradox of sorts...it seems to be both shrinking, becoming small. Bridged by technology: planes, telephones, the internet, cars, trains...etc... And yet in other ways it seems to be becoming larger. More expansive...  And I don't know that I like either of them really...but it seems (rather ironically) that it is the expanding that seems to be making me feel more claustrophobic...as the world seems to shrink...it becomes easier (to my mind) to escape from the rut...to go elswhere...meet new people...Though it also makes it seem that there are fewer places to escape to and less chance of getting far...but in a way that's good because it gives you the security of knowing that your lifeline the network of relations, friends etc are still within reach...  But it also seems that it removes a means...a direction of escape...if even for a little while...from the responsibilities, the rigid societal structures that have been built up...that are imposed upon us and ingrained in us throughout our entire lives...Its like that song by Great Big Sea really:  Penelope Released January 2002 (written by Chris  Hynes) Penelope works in the market Down in the coconut trees She’s  saving up all her money To go to America across the sea  She once had  an uncle He lived in Detroit town They got all his post cards But his  body has never been found  To this day To this day  She got a job  as a domestic Workin' for the minimum wage All her friends back home in  Jamaica They say, ‘You really got it made in the shade’  But they don’t  see her sweat and grind And her bended on her knees She wishes she was  back in Jamaica Beneath the coconut trees  Penelope’s back in the  market She found what it was all about Oh no, she doesn’t regret  it She’s just glad that she got out  But others aren’t so  lucky They’re there till the day they die Trapped in steel and  concrete No beach No moon No sky    or a story my mom has  called...oh what is it called, working towards what you already have?  or  something similar...  its just that it seems that the world...my future...is just coming a bit too fast...I mean I know that I'm ahead of a lot of people...in that I know what I want to do...its just that...I don't know that I want to do it yet...if that makes any sense whatsoever  I mean, yes I want to go into geology, I want to learn about it...study it...and eventually take a career in relation to it...its just that there is so much else that I want to do...and I look at my parents...who are great people who also knew what they wanted to do...but because they fell in love, had a family, and have to take care of us are stuck in a sort of half-life in terms of employment...because not too much money can be made as an artist...so they work for the post office...for people they don't like, with horrible management, making enough to have us in the lower-middle income, range so we can live comfortably...eat well, live with more luxuries than a lot of people out there in the world...but they are stuck there...in these jobs they don't like, unable to do a lot of things I know they would like to do...  Not having done a  lot of things they wanted to do....  I know my dad wants to paint full time...I mean he'll come home from work and go down to his studio...which he always talks about expanding...maybe taking over the garage for his studio or the like...but with one thing or another it just doesn't happen...not enough time at one point, not enough money at another, or sometimes its just not enough energy....but I mean he'll come home and he'll paint...or sketch or sometimes he'll just sit in the old chair he claimed for his studia and just look at the painting he's working on for an hour...sometimes he'll start working on it after that, other times he'll go upstairs...  anyhow I guess what I'm trying to say...in a roundabout, verbose manner...is that I suppose I'm a little bit frightened of trapping myself without having seen something of the world...without having taken the chances offered to me to expand my knowledge...I don't know that I want to go into University and immediatly streamline my studies to geology...yet I do want to enter it now as well...its just that I want to do other things take other courses as well...I don't want to be trapped to one path...one viewpoint...one disipline....and I want to learn things that don't just satisfy my curiosity, my wants and needs...I want to learn things that will help other people...I want to do things that will make some sort of difference in someone's life...  which I suppose brings me to how the world seems to also be expanding, it seems to be expanding in its problems...the troubles that abound in people's lives, in regions, in nations, everywhere...perhaps its simply me becoming more aware of what's occuring globally or perhaps it what my social teacher referred to as convergence theory...perhaps its simply a bunch of occurances, of forces coalescing like steam building up pressure until it all explodes in a flurry of activity.... But I look at the world today and I wonder what good we really can do...we can help one person...help their brief spark glow more brightly...but that leaves millions of others out there who aren't going to get help...there is only so much that can be achieved...and in some cases I think that the attempts to help end up doing the opposite...but does that make the attempts any less worthy?  I guess I just have to say I just don't know...there are so many things that could be done...but so many of them just aren't possible, or wanted by those that make the decisions...or hold the resources...in the end it ammounts to the same thing I suppose....and there are so many...so many...war, disease, famine, drought, abuse, depression, poverty...not to mention the little everyday problems that surround us...which can cut just as deep, a friend's misfortune, a death, an injury... anything really...heck even the little girl you babysit who trips and scrapes her knee and then cries as you hold her and tells you how she wants her mom, and how she wishes her mom wouldn't leave her even if its just for a night...  And no one can heal all of them...to even begin to make a difference in some you have to pick your battles...but how do you choose them really? Particularly when everywhere you turn it seems there are more and more issues to be faced...more problems cropping up...all of them as unsolvable as the ones before...as unsolvable as the ones that will come after...  Perhaps it get easier to decide...easier to pick the battles as you become more solid as a person...begin to understand yourself more...at least that's what I always tell myself...because I do know that no one can face all of these problems...not even a person who could dedicate their entire life to them could do it...  And I guess that's the crux of the matter...the reason its so difficult for me to accept...its as my friends tell my I am the cynical optimist...my optimistic side tells me constantly that only by making the efforts can a difference be made...and that it is possible to make a difference...while my cynical side watches and quietly draws attention to the expanse of problems out there...and that even in making an effort...my contribution on its own is like attempting to scratch a diamond with a nickle...  But I guess that's why I need my optomistic side...I mean it keeps me going...keeps me busy... gives me the motivation to do what I need to do...but I guess it becomes slightly weaker at 2:00 in the morning...seeing as that seems to be the time when the dark little thoughts start to appear...oh well...  A person who is completely happy...does not exist...a person without a dark side is incomplete just as a person without a light side is incomplete  as I begin to sound like a druid: balance, balance, balance...but I really do believe that a balance is important...in life...in nature...in everything...but I'm more the neutral good type...balance is important...but if you don't strive for what you feel is right...well then what can you really do? Existentialism is only bleak if you look at it from the middle....  and with that bit of cryptic thought (I can tell you that when I read that when I wake up I'm almost garuanteed to go "huh?!?") I think I'll head to bed...because my mind feels suffieciently cleaned out to allow me to shut it down...  ~Night

						   Well I don't know that I need to explain... or whether you want to read an explanation but seeing as that has never stopped me before here I go.  I had a blog a while back and I kept it up infrequently for a while... but due to many circumstances, including not having access to the internet at home, it fell by the wayside. Well my desire to blog has been rekindled also by many circumstances including the fact that I now have internet access in my house, and reading the blogs of many others including Phoenix (who I'd link to but his is passworded),  urlLink Homie Bear ,  urlLink Life's Anthems , and  urlLink Between Lightning and Light   The musings I have placed here that are dated before today... were written on the days they display but were snatched from the storage room of my computer's memory... I'm sure if I searched hard enough I could find more... but I don't really know that its necessary.  Now a warning for those who haven't already caught on (ie by reading my first post) I tend to write in this sort of thing late at night when the thoughts swirling aroundin my head do not allow me the simple pleasure of sleep... other people simply call this insomnia (but that's not as fun). The posts will likely vary greatly in content depending on mood, what had happened during the day... etc. And no one... I repeat no one is obliged to finish reading any of my posts... whether you are friend or foe my ramblings often make little sense to some and or resonate with others...  Now that you are warned you are also welcome to post comments to tell me what you think of my thoughts, or to do some random rambling of your own. Drop a gem and get everything off your head... or just say hi.  Oh... and please excuse randomly placed commas, and typos that I am sure are more than rampant throughout these postings... keep in mind most of them are done late at night (or early morning) when I am quite exhausted, I do little or no proofreading, and I'm not doing them to be perfectly gramatically correct I'm writing to just get stuff out of my head.  Enjoy  ~Em

						   Well this is a little bit different from my previous musings in one way... It is not written while I am suffering from insomnia... though I'm dead tired so I figure the result should be pretty darn close to the same.  Well the cousins are leaving today after being here for a week and half (for a week of which they were staying at my house) . And I have to say I am actually a bit relieved. Oh, they're wonderful boys for the most part... very nice... but a week is almost too long to have four of them running around your house. Particularly because they are all at ages where patience... or understanding the need for some quiet time... or for realizing that yes, people do sleep past 7:30 and that chasing eachother about the house is not an activity appreciated by others at that time in the morning. *rolls her eyes*  But anyway Matt and Sem's parents should be hear within the next ten minutes... and then I'll get a modicum of peace... and then Sunday or Monday (not sure which at this point) the rest of the family is off on holidays (I stay here because of work). While I would like to go with them it will be nice to have some quiet, peaceful time in the house.  Well I've just looked over what I've written previously and its much to factual and coherent to fit in with my other posts so I think I'll abandon the daily rote of what is happening in my life and go on to more abstract musings....  People seem to be obsessed with things... we don't ask people "to watch our things/stuff", we say "she/he has so much", "Oh wouldn't you love to have that?" and many, many more phrases of the like. I am certainly not innocent of this myself... as I often think about what I would get if I had the money... though it invariably seems to involve computers, books, music (playing or listening), or some sort of equiptment for outdoor activities (bikes, kayaks and the like)...  But it really hit me today as something that was pervading in the air... perhaps its the presence of my aunty Beth and her son who have been here for over a week now. They are nice people and also very wealthy... and obsessed with stuff...  Gareth quite frequently will send me e-mails... or talk to me on the phone about the new such and such he has... his mother is constantly shopping... and it doesn't seem to really make either of them any more happy really.  I, personally am very hard put to understand this... oh, I am certainly not thrifty if I go out wiht my friends I tend to spend money... but usually on food or something to share between us... (or a movie and they are so expensive lately that a movie alone is enough to get rid of the money burning a hole in your pocket)...  But even that I can see in relation to the whole phenomenom of consumerism... in developed countries it seems that that is the driving theme the cogs of the wheel that drive the whole system... the need for more stuff... But its not so much a need as a burning desire... its the demand that keeps the supply coming... or perhaps it is the supply of so much that creates the demand that drives this wheel...  I really don't know and the one who can figure it out definitively will have modern economics pinned down.  It is in our blatant and rampant consumerism that everything seems to run... but it also appears to be giving us a growing sense of momentum as we hurtle down a slope that could eventually lead to our doom.... (my that was a bit fatalistic of me wasn't it?)... But it really is something to think about... the more we take out of the earth the less there is... but not only are we taking resources out of the Earth we are also putting pollutants back in. This spells disaster for many species every day and as we begin to burn holes in the food web the worry is that this will come back and hit us...  As a species we have a mentality not unlike a twenty year old guy (or girl for that matter), we seem to beleive that as a species we are untouchable... immortal and will be here forever. But like the twenty year old if we fall off the cliff the species will go... exitinct. Its happened to many species before and it can happen to us if we aren't careful... and all our concrete and iron buildings, all our designer clothes, our gas-guzzling vehicles aren't going to save us... nope, in fact if we continue the expansion of these and the other industries at the rate they are growing now... they may do the opposite.  "Progress" seems to be the watchword of the day, a country's successfullness is measured in its growth (per capita, per annum) but perhaps a different scale should be used. Scientists have done this experiment many times... students have heard it in science and done questions related to it in math many, many times over.... if there are bacteria/rabbits/[insert rapidly growing population here] doubling every day... or even every year... it doesn't take long for the space to fill, the food to run out... all the incredible little multitude of limiting factors to come into play in their lives and well then good bye population.  Now people may argue all they want that this is in a closed system, but my answer to that is that we are in a closed system. We might be able to send people up in space... but we aren't getting any life sustainging resources up there... the earth is in and of itself a closed system and we are stuck on it.  Now I don't want to sound all doom and gloom... because I'm not. I just think we need to change our attitudes... rather than more, more, more and grow, grow, grow... I think we should concentrate on balance. I truly believe we can live in a certain balance... not that it would be easy and it would take a few generations... but by cutting back on a lot of our production of goods we do not need and that don't even really add that much to our lives, by concentrating on our effect on the environment... on taking as little from the Earth as possible... by slowly changing our lifestyle we can save the Earth for generations to come.  And I think that's something everyone could agree is a worthy cause... I mean like I said at the beginning we are obssessed with stuff... we're greedy little buggers and shouldn't we want to keep the largest 'thing' we have in good condition: the Earth.  Over and out.

						   The world is full of people who, individually, are more variable than the shapes of snowflakes but who seem to become almost identical when placed in a large group. I suppose I’m a bit of a person watcher… it comes from simply sitting and watching/listening rather than talking to people, and its amazing the differences you see when you really look at a person everything from appearance, to mannerisms, to personalities. But if you take a step backwards and look at different groups of people, the larger the groups the fewer differences between them you see. I’m not talking about appearance or clothing but more in terms of behaviour. This makes me wonder whether this indicates that we are essentially all the same at the core or that our sameness is superficial and it is only in the elimination of too many important details, of pulling the microscope back too far. So that the differences are lost.  This in turn makes me wonder whether it really matters, but then again isn’t it the question that we all seem to ask ourselves… what is different about me… or am I the same as those around me? Are we the same as those we dislike or are we different.  Our construction, the biology bit of it in any case, would lead one to suspect that we are all essentially the same. Every living being on this earth is given shape using the same language or code. The same repeating sequences of amino acids, phosphates and sugars. So perhaps on that basis every living being is essentially the same at the core. Then can we justify hate or revulsion of any other living thing… even something so widely loathed as a spider or a cockroach? Or are we simply repulsed by such things as the show us aspects of ourselves we don’t want to see?  On the other hand the variation possible using the genetic code is so vast as to be innumerable… so the potential for difference, the basis upon which we are all built gives immeasurable variety.  If, however, we are essentially different does that not leave us even more isolated from those around us? Does I not make us, as individuals compleyely unable to truly understand one another only able to reach across the great chasm that separates us from everyone else with a tenuous and fragile line of shared situation, language, touch…  Both outlooks seem bleak as I’ve written them here. And perhaps they are. But here I will adopt an existentialist viewpoint: Things are bleak, they always will be so all you can do is keep on going and try lessen the bleakness…  Anyhow back to the question at hand…. Both viewpoints seem so mutually exclusive and yet I find that I believe both… and I don’t mean to say that in such a way that suggests I believe one in some situations and the other in others… I believe them both… simultaneously. I believe both that everyone, every person, every being share the same essential core, not of humanity… but of… life, I suppose. Though that isn’t even quite the right word for it. I believe that because of this core common to all that we are all intrinsically connected… kind of a collective unconscious of all life… But at the same time I believe that we are all isolated from everyone, and everything else by our access to the world. Everything we see, we know, we are told, is filtered through our senses, our experiences. I truly believe that no one can truly understand another person’s feelings or experience even if they have gone through the same… I suppose an easy example would be someone who likes mushrooms as opposed to someone who doesn’t. They both have eaten the same thing… but both have come to completely different conclusions… and perhaps even taste completely different things.  Wll anyway yet another reason why I tend yo consider myself one big bag of contradictions…. Heck just look at the characters that pop into my head… all of them have come from me and really are just different aspects of me. I sometimes feel I have more personalities than someone diagnosed with the disorder… Its just that all mine are blended together in one mix that is then what the world sees…. Or doesn’’t see thather…. There are some personalities that are much stronger than others… at least on the surface. Scathach for example represents a darker more aggressive side of me… but though it seems a strong piece it is really quite buried under the rest of my traits… which is probably one of the reasons I enjoy writing her character so much… it allows me to unbury that side of me and just get some of it out.  Well, anyhow, enough from me… its almost 3:00 and I’ve gotten enough out of my mind that I should be able to sleep now… sometimes I think that writing these Random Musings, as I’ve taken to calling them, is really just a non-magic version of a pensieve (A reference to Harry Potter for those who started giving me weird looks at that moment) they allow me to just lay thoughts that are swirling around my head too quickly to quiet them… and then they lose their urgency and sort of return quietly to the back-shelf until next time… anyway I have to work tomorrow so I tear myself away from these writings with some reluctance. Until next time…
