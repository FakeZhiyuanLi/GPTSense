       I'm melting!!!...  Not really...but I feel like hell...staying up till 2 AM in the morning and waking up at 8 the next morning is not a good idea, I've been feeling tired the whole day, the only way keeping me sane...is probabely coke and work...very tired indeed.  Got a call from my traveling parents, and from what I can tell, they have been doing way to much driving and way too little sleep. It looks like it takes about 10 ours to drive to Quebec from Toronto, and when they finaly got there, they had trouble finding a place to stay...very troublesome, and the hotels there is very expensive...$120 a night...  Err...as I said in my last post, I finished the handbook last night and sent out the version 3, well..today I again got e-mail replays. But only 1 with a very minor change, so I guess that made my happy enough...so all I need to do is the add the cover and schedual and I am done. But printing present a problem once more, because I do not know how to print it in a book fashin...err...and they want to see hard copys tomorow...got to get this problem figured out...and make sure I don't screw up...  The stress and the deadline have been deadly...after I present this thing tomorow...I'm taking a couple of days off with this and going to enjoy my self and camp that's coming up in a week...and actually take a break during my vacation...  Anyways...going to go back and finish the handbook and print it correctly (hopefully) and get to bed before 1 in the morning...

       What a long day it hav been...  Up until tonight...it was a good day. Remeber the draft that I finally sent out?...today I got about 10 e-mails back saying that there is something wrong with it that should be changed...which I could have done easily until I relized the massive changes that these people have made. Which have brought me here...2 o'clock in the morning writing this post with my last bit of energy...the whole change took me about 4 hours to do, so I have been working from 10 last night till today 2 in the morning...I am tired...but at least it's done. Who knows? Maybe tomorow when I wake up I'll face another 10 e-mails...oh well...this is the part I choose to do and I'm going to stick with it, and all in all, I am the best....or so I think ;)  Well...the life without parents is...so far very nice, I have been serviving and been having some fun, so I guess I am kind of enjoying this.  I never get a break, after all these hard work, I can only sleep for a couple of hours because I am giving a piano lesson 9:30 in the morning...I don't usually do these things this early, but oh well...and in the afternoon, I have worship practice for tomorow and a full day of meeting with the people to discuss the handbook and getting it ready to print...-_-...I am soooo tired...  Anyways...even the coke and coffe is not working on me anymore, so I guess I netter go to bed before I break down...so  Later Days  "I am soooo tired" - Me  Neo

       AHHHHHHHH!!!! HOME ALONE!!!!  Alright.....:D  So my parents are getting ready to leave for the trip around Canada...they'll be gone for 5 days, so tomor when I wake up...I'll be waking up to a empty house for 5 days...HOUSE PARTY!!!...nah.  err...the hand book issue was finally solved after some thinking and everyone seems to be happy...just hope it gets approved in time so I can print it...time is always against me...-_-  Remeber how I said in my post yester day that I can't take another server break down for the medias on the site?...well...it broke down...but this time for other reasons than computer bugs. It looks like our bandwith is being used a lot lately...and the 10GB bandwith was shot within 15 days. So now I can't log on to the server or do anything. We're on lock down for the rest of the month...-_-...oh well   Later Days...  "Why, Why do you keep going?" "Because I choose to"  Neo...

       No matter how much they can do, always...always there will be a downside to them...  Last night I finally got my Handbook sent out...this morning to my complet surprise, the 5 people that I send it to...4 of them bounced back...-_-... and for the rest of the day, these guys have been on my ass asking for the draft when their the one who couldn't find the space the recieve it...when times like this, I wished that everyone used Gmail...:D  Naruto Spot will be once again up tomorow, I had the honor of again looking over the site and find bugs and so on...it was a good night of work and we got everything fixed up and looking like new. All I need to do it to upload the current Naruto Shows and we should be ready to go tomorow. Hope the server doesn't break on my again. I can't take another server break-down...  Seems that my parents will be leaving for a quick tour of Canada this weekend, they'll be going to a couple of places...but since I am all booked Friday and Sunday, I can't go with them >  Later Days...

       Well....finally got the handbook done today, the content anyways, the cover still need some work, I'll get it done tomorow...kind of tired now after a full day.  I want to get my passport today, so we can have over trip at the US, we're thinking of going to NY for a couple of days...4 to be exact, we're going to drive over (which I think will be a lot of fun) and stay there and visit a few places and have some fun. I think it'll be great.  A lot of anime for me today, Chobits, Samuria 7, Naruto...fun fun fun, love these animes...only if the download times are not so huge -_-...but I got a new Bit Torrent client, and it seems to be faster, so we'll see. :D  A couple days ago, one of my house phones decide to break on me, today, I finally got around to fix it but the service fee is crazy!...just for the tech people to simply look at it, it will be $30, and than they'll give you a "complet" bill after they finish fixing it...I really don't have that much money to fix a simple cordless  phone, so I guess I'll find somewhere else to fix it. How troublesome...  My friend have been working on a new lay-out for Naruto Spot, and I can say it is looking good!...it'll be up in a couple of days, so go and check it out!  The chinese's have already won 10 gold in the olympic game, the have more than any other country!...this really is coming as a surprise for me, I never realized that the chinese were strong at these games, but I'm very proud of the team and hope they keep it up. :D  Later Days  "Pollution will be recognized as a serious problem when it interferes with TV reception" - Hugh Arscott  Neo...

       Well....I would say today was a nice and productive day...  I finally got a cover for my handbook today!....thank godness...now all I need to do is mess with photoshop, put a title, and send it off...the deadline is today, but I feel too tired to do it now, another 12 hours wouldn't hurt. :P  I got to spend some quality time with my family today, had dinner, did some games, watch the Olympic game...a guy like me can get use to a life like this...everyting is good. :)  Later days  "Television's influence is much too subtle to be detected by its victims." - Milton Shulman  Neo...

       No post yesterday...I was feeling really really sick so I decided to stay in bed...wasn't a bad idea or I would have been really sick...Lucky me :D  Just though I do a little post before I go to the airport and pick-up my father...gosh is sure good to have him back even just for a little while...err...this project that he have been doing overseas have beening very...busy, so he only get to come back every 3 month...oh well...at least me and my mother can take care of our self...I don't really know when he's plane is arriving...I'm guessing around 9 o'clock...so, I'll be off by than...  I was watching the olympics...and I see China have done well in synchronized diving 10m platform for Women...I'm glad...I predict that the Chinese will also do very well in bedminton, and table tennis...they always do...well...I wish them luck...maybe I should be saying that to the Canadian team? ;)  The handbook is still missing a cover...tomorow will be my last chance...and also my deadline...and this is one deadline I intend to keep, time is running short for everyone...so I can't afford to screw up now...not that I will...I already have a idea of what I will do, just need to run it through my team and we should be done in less than 10 minutes, wish me luck.

       Yes indeed today was a great day...  I finally got everything done for my handbook...other than the cover page of corse...I was able to go over it many times today and fix up anything that may be wrong with it and found some more pictures on Google to use as background Pictures...so I basically have everything done. Now regarding the Cover...I've decided to take a really crazy/Nice Idea picture this coming friday and slap it on as the cover...we've done it many time before...I don't see why it wouldn't work now...the only problem - I need to think of that crazy/nice idea...well...got another 24 hours...times to dig up my brain and loss some sleep again...  I finally got to watch the Naruto special that I have beening waiting this week...what can I say?...1 hour of pure fun and excitment...I love Naruto, and what is even better?...the naruto site me and my friend have been working on...  had a review...a rather good one on that note...and we are quite happy about it, if you got the love for Naruto, check out our site's review at: http://kyubinetwork.com/index.php?id=sitereviews/nspot/index.htm ... a bit of traffic wouldn't hurt...:D  Anyways...today I have relased that my father is coming back to Canada this week...he have been away on a project in China for many month now...and he's finally coming back!...too bad he's leaving again in a month but...I'll just enjoy the time for now...we have a lot of planned made, we were thinking of going to Disney World this summer, really looking forward to it...

           Is summer suppose to be tiring?... Because I am...             I found myself sleeping very badly and waking up very early today...probabely only 4 hours of sleep...-_-...so very tired...my body is aching all over the place...ouch!                 But even with all my limitations, I still    manage to get alot of work done today...I finally decided to take up my Volunteering work today and start doing some...I was told if you do more voluteering work, you will better your chance in getting into a university...who knows? Maybe their right...           Anyways...I discovered some major flaws in my handbook today and took me 5 hours+ to fix it...turns out all my page size was not correct and was not ready for printing, and since many pages of my handbook had ridiculously complex format, when the page size was changed...well...everything just want......I'll let you imagine the rest...           But all in all I was able to fix it...but what do I get other than a very tired body &amp; mind?...even more problem, now because of the new page size, I have doubled the number of pages I orginally had which present a problem because I don't have as many background images...and my time is running out for more real life photography...so let's see if Google can help me out on this one. Still no cover though, my pastors want to see a full hand book this coming Sunday, I don't know where I can dig up a cover...oh well...I'll do the best I can...but time is against me...it was always against me.           But...overall it have been a ok day, I'm sure to get a good night sleep after all this...after all...I'm still just a kid. :) ...well...at least boredom haven't kicked in yet...(this is about the only summer that I'm not bored) but I have a feeling I soon will be...

       well......at least the water is back on...:)  I was able to install the final version of Windows XP Service Pack 2 without any trouble, and in all honesty it is a great looking service pack...Microsoft have focused much on its security this time around and I think they have finally gotten something right ;)...and for all of you that are not as computer savy as you should be...this service pack will show up on your winodws update on the 28th and you can express install from there...all in all it's great.  This morning, I have noticed a piece of software that have come across my way...Ad-aware...not the Ad-aware 6 everyone have being using, but Ad-aware 6 Speical Edition. So I decided to give it a download and it is GREAT!...it scan files much more carefully and it is able to pick up all different kind of adware and spyware...I would recommend it to everyone...you can go grab it at download.com...but...I need to warn you in fairness that it is kind of slow comparing to Ad-aware 6 and according to others...it some times delet the wrong files...but no problem at my end...so go grab it...  Even with all these great things...my situation of my handbook still haven't changed...uptill this point no one is able to give me something decent for the cover...Time is running out (since the deadline is the 14h) I can only wait one more day...if still nothing good, than I'll have to make it...err...I really don't want to go there...-_-  The weather here in Toronto have been very cool...unlike the last couple of years when it's suppose to be 30+....but this year in the middle of August is surprisingly...very nice & cool, I almost have no use for my AC in my room anymore, but I'm going to keep it anyways...just in case... ;)  All in all....it have been a good day...just wish someone would give me a decent cover page...oh well...nothing I can do...  Till then...  "Ignorance is Bliss"  Neo...

       Nothing have been going right today...when I work up this morning...to my complet surprise, I realise that I have no water and I didn't wake up early enough to save some water to use for the rest of the day...-_-...lucky me...  And if that is not the only thing that is not going well...the Handbook I'm working on for my Church's Summer camp is in desperate need of a cover page, and it almost seems that no one in my church or my handbook team have any artistic skills whatsoever...what does that boil down to? I need to ride shotgun and make my own cover, and if I ineed need to...it will not be pretty...oh boy, this will really make my day...  And what is even more depressing is that I just realized today what many doesn't want to...My summer is half shot!!...only a few more week until I need to sit back down into that classroom and well...learn and achieve...as much as I like reading and writing and other "eductaional" stuff, school is not on my favourt list...(well, not any more)...  Well...what am I going to do with all these stuff?...I guess I can only do them, forget about them and hope for the best...oh well...let's hope the situation changes in the next 24 hours...

        Well Well Well.....finally...my own mind blog...I always wanted to do something like this...but never got around to it...I think this is a great tool to write down how I feel, opinions and...who knows what might come across my way...  Some happy news today I guess...my English youth pastor got engaged today to one of my friend, really happy for them both...but right after the good news...more responsibilitys, more things need to be completed for the hand book and my GM position...things are going well I guess, since I am on my summer vacation, there is much time to relax and rest. But a bit of work is always needed just to keep me away from brain dead state. ;)...well.....nothing much to add...but I am really enjoying this, hope this will last.
