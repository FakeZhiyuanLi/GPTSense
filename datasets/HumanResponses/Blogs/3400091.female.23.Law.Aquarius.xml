      Alright, this is getting annoying... where is my period?  Pseudo made me lasagna last night and I drank an entire bottle of wine by myself. He emailed me this morning to tell me how great I was last night. Jesus, did I black out?   There is a grain of sand in my gum, it is the current bane of my existence.  In staff meeting this morning, new young boy who works here unintentionally made 3 consecutive farting noises with his boat shoes and I laughed my ass off.

      Feeling physically ill from 2-digit long bank account balance.  Fun weekend- in sports bar sunday night, eating chicken wings and drinking beer, psuedo pulled out his dick at the booth. Can't remember why he did, but all of a sudden, there it was. Totally floored.   Think I set the record for most Sex and the City episodes watched in a row. Or hours spent in a bathrobe.   Saturday night had "great fucking sex" with psuedo (I've found when he compliments me throughout the night, our romps are just that much better.), which was unduly interrupted by his dog licking my foot mid-climax.  Got three cute new Juicy dresses from Saks- orange, pink and turquoise- hell yes! (Then got last month's Saks bill in mail today and clapped hand over mouth in utter shock. Should be a great anorexic three weeks coming up until next payday.   Fantastic! Buy shoes, no money left for food, lose weight!

      Phew... things back on track with pseudo:    P: So I pick you up after the game for drinks?  Me: Pick-up sounds nice. Look forward to it. Call first though, so I can usher out whatever hot studs I have over.  P: Miss Brunette - will you entertain the possibility of joining me for drinks atop some building in the ctown area?  I would like that very much. Is 11ish too late for a gorgeous brunette like yourself?  Me: not for such a respectable male suitor as yourself... I will surely be waiting.  P: What does you wardrobe look like now and for the night?  Me: Right now, yellow lace dress and a black cardigan, black heels. Looking adorable I might say. Tonite, maybe whipping out a new skirt, might bring out a new pair of Pradas yet to be seen by *Pseudo*, a tshirt, we'll see.  P: I like what I am hearing... You name the place tonight...ill get home probs quick shower then we will rock - close them down and then head on home to crisp ac and sheets?  The last part work?    Ah... we are definitely back to cruising altitude. Looking forward to that first glass of chardonnay and a view of downtown Charleston...

      Day halfway over... thank god. Had terrible bantering emails with pseudo-boyfriend all morning. Seems to think my denying hooking up with old flame last night is ludicrous ("two people of the opposite sex just do not hang out and watch movies drunk... there is no way there is no sexual attraction. If you just admit it, I'll leave it alone.") Anyway, I staunchly denied it (we did make out. dammit.)  Drove home to eat lunch and decided on a little angry Fiona Apple for the ride- stuck at light on Meeting Street with windows down awash in sunshine from moonroof and realized how much I love living in this city...  Wow. Just got phone call from long distance boyfriend, who has no inkling of other hook ups here. Told me it was "good to hear my voice." Cringed, but then cooed something to the effect of "You too..." and hung up quick.  Can't wait to use remote controlled vibrator again at the bar tonite with psuedo boyfriend. God, he loves that thing!

      You know it was a rough night when you wake up to a half empty beer on your nightstand. Ugh.   I'm sitting here at work, dazed and eating some beef jerky. Looks like rat shit in contrast with the crisp white papers and manila folders of my desk...  So I'm totally avoiding the huge, looming error I made last night; namely, hardcore making out with old flame/best friend. Not hungover, but feeling strangely ill from guilt- this is weird, I haven't given two shits about cheating on a guy since I adulterously banged one of my best friend's older brother.  My thong is strangling my ass.  Got to start working. No email yet from psuedo-boyfriend. Have a feeling he might be pissed. Hope he didnt notice old flame's car at house until 4 am...  oh hang on: he emailed me just now:   You and the drunk have a nice bang last night?   Yeah, he's pissed. Fuck.

      First posting! How exciting.  If this were a diary, I suppose I would say... had another wonderful night with psuedo-boyfriend/neighbor: walked dog on beach, did my best wind-swept, thoughtful expressions. We walked, threw the tennis ball, toes in the sand, dicussed the possible textures of the dog's shit after the consumption of large amounts of sea water, and we laughed...  Mexican dinner, chips and cheese and 2 pitchers of margaritas later, I gave "the best blow job he's ever gotten." Still getting rave reviews over email today. Something about inflicting paralysis.  email received:  "Well done...well done last night...ear to ear..."   Skirt is see-through today. Has gone unnoticed by any attorneys or other such superiors.   Saw hottie attorney from 5th floor in elevator for 3rd day in a row. This time I remarked "You must think I'm stalking you," in a near purr, and we exchanged some banter until my stop. Hoping to see him again tomorrow; might try to live my elevator make-out dream.  Can I just say that the Washingtonienne is hilarious... makes me wish I'd thought of it first. However, stay tuned. I'm only just getting warmed up.

      Wearing four-seasons-ago Trina Turk plaid mini-kilt today and waiting to hear about it from the bitter, horse-faced human resources woman who has a personal vendetta against me, my legs and my outfits (women around here are spiteful, eh?). Once I wore this miniscule Lilly skort and got called into her office. Horrible day.   As if I needed another reason not to wear Lilly Pulitzer.   My reason #1: the masses of bourgeouis girls who save their menial job paychecks to buy one $180 dress so as to fit in with those to whom that is pocket change; at an event like, say, a steeple chase. Sounds terribly snotty, but it is my pet peeve. Then those who can in fact afford these dresses have to rise above this- which I excel at, being the fashion maven that I am- and can only use their Lilly dresses as closet-corner stuffers (come on, we all have these, items of clothing that merely serve the purpose sitting in the back of the closet with massive price tags still on, to fill the corners so we don't have to actually reach back there to see whats there. Or maybe that's just me. I found a $350 Rozae Nichols suede shell encrusted halter top yesterday- going to have to wear that one)- but it is annoying anyway.   Wow, that was a venemous rant. Going to have to search my soul to find out where that spit and piss came from. Hope I didn't offend anyone.  On to bigger and better things- boyfriend and I had a talk last night- tears of joy involved on my part (slightly tequila drenched), really learning to flex my emoting muscles- ones I didn't really know I had. We discussed our future together and how mad about eachother we are and how we are going to move away together. Going to keep things said private (translate: way too syrupy and sappy to put into print) but let me say that if I play my cards right and win this in the end- I'll be married to this guy.  (!!!!!!) (already planning outfits for trip to meet parents!)

      Note to self (and other cat owners): Do not jerk off boyfriend in bed with kitten in room, as rapid movement/swishing sounds will most definitely cause kitten to pounce.   So tired. Sort of sunburned. Going to go investigate new hot law clerk coworker just informed me of.  I can still look, can't I?  Email from boyfriend:  "What do we do tonite- will the moat be closed yet?" Ah, period times.  p.s. holding some filing for one lady attorney I work for who absolutely despises me (presumably for my adorable outfits and shiny hair. It's not my problem you have a FUPA and 3-D moles on your face. Christ.) and she has done some doodling on the side. At first looks like innocent frills and loops, but in one loop she has drawn an angry face- complete with furrowed eyebrows, beady eyes and a mouth with fangs. I am more than a little disturbed.

      Ooouf, one more hilarious one. Came to me while looking through old photo albums and saw one of my 7 yr old self hanging with an older teenage girl poolside. My mom reminded me her name was Gina and it all came rolling back to me (no pun intended, once you read the following):  I was attending a corporate family cookout with my parents and brother and had resigned to playing with the big kids in the pool until long after dark (and long after pruning- not a fan.) Anyway, you know how it is when you're young- no time for getting out and going to the bathroom- especially when it's a shit lurking behind your quake hole...  Anyway I did the typical clench and stand still until the urge passed, presumably consequence free, until time to leave. The gracious Gina took the young, helpless (but definitely trying to act cool) shiteful me to the bathroom to change.   Wearing a one piece is pretty tricky, and taking it off poses a dire lack of privacy, but neither of the above holds a candle to when you have a small, marble-sized turd in the crotch of said garment awaiting its escape.  And escape it did. I peeled off my wet suit and out popped a little brown nugget, which rolled aside the toilet and under the sink.  "OhmiGOD what IS THAT!?! Eeeew..... GRooooooosss!" Gina wailed in horror, both hands flailing as she backed away.   Playing it cool, I stood there, naked with my suit in hand, and shrugged. Elongated pause as I looked down at the turd, thinking, 'you little fucker. I sure as hell don't remember pinching you off.'   Quelle disaster.  Working with it, I rebounded with a dramatic: "Huh? Oh that? I don't know... I mean, EEEEW, gross!!!"  Telling this story always brings me to tears of laughter. I could tell a million more. But as of right now, I have terrible cramps (HELLO, PERIOD!!! I love you.) and am off to pop some confiscated pain pills and go to sleep.  Bonne nuit!

      ha, I just realized that last entry went against the two heavy points I had made in the previous one. If you didn't notice the drinking and the peanut butter eating, you weren't paying attention to my "taking a break from boozing" and "new Mary Kate diet" affirmations of yore.  I am such a joke.

      In an effort to impart some of my history on this flimsy storytelling (in manner of shedding light on current behavioral patterns) I share now a flashback I had after visiting with my best friend for a few hours yesterday in Savannah.  (in kitchen of house in Richmond, VA)  Teetering on 5 inch, orange satin Prada heels, your heroine slurs into a cell phone at nameless caller on other end of line.  After one particularly gut-grabbing laugh, a small trickle of pee down her inner thigh becomes impossible to hide.  (pointing at pee, still on phone, she looks down teetering around, then with hand over mouthpiece of cell phone loudly whispers) "Oh... ha... I just peed on my Prada shoes. Who does that!??"   One of many grand tales of taking leaks that I have to offer.  It is absolutely pouring outside and I'm stranded indoors while my parents are at a wedding boozing it up. I'm getting into the whole lounge act with my new Juicy orange terry dress (one of... what, 8- holy hell, I DO have 8!!!) and a jar of crunchy peanut butter.  It's 7 pm now- I'm now off to finish watching Gigli. Ordered it from On Demand. Not sure why, just wanted to see what the hype was all about. (ok, reason #2, the much more legitimate one: I have a closet obsession with J Lo. See: lucite clear wedge heels I purchased after seeing her wearing them in numerous photos.) (ahh shit, I might as well offer reason #3 too.... I've been drinking wine since about 5... by myself...)

      Well I'm home for the weekend- getting some TLC from the parents and a break from the boozing and spending (actually, boyfriend went out of town to a wedding in DC- coincidentally, the wedding of the guy who took my virginity, and one of his best friends - so I figured I had no real reason to stick around.)   7:00 am wakeup from Dad for a walk on the beach and noticed "1 missed call" on cell phone- boyfriend had taken time away from his long lost best friends on a romp through DC to call little me! So adorable. Definitely in love.  Today begins day of my new Mary Kate diet. Something has got to be done (and I really would like to achieve that chic model look in my Joie silk cargos rather than, well, looking like white silk cargo.) I am hoping that my stating this in a semi-public arena (ok, who am I kidding, only I and a handful of others read this,) I will be forced by karma to stick to it. We'll see.  Watched Love Actually last night.... loved it. Made me think of boyfriend and how I plan on spending the rest of my life with him (holy shit! - - did I just say that?!? Where doth my bachelor/slut/floozy days go??! It's ok... I didn't want my 'number' to get into the 40's anyhow.) Off to have some coffee, turn down some wonderful mom-cooked breakfast for GNC shake (whats up, Mary Kate!) and head off to the beach.  Have I mentioned life is good?

      Observation:   Going along with my previously mentioned pregnancy paranoia was the assumption that my tender boobs were certain symptom. I had emailed my friend as I do once a month ("Unf, but I just KNOW I am... I mean, how could I not be? Ugh... doesnt it mean you are if your tits hurt? They're KILLING me...") and I had optimistically chocked it up to pre-period pangs... but alas....  I have (like the detective I am) deduced the real cause of said pain. D-cup girls, I implore you- try to remember to wear a bra when getting it from behind. Granted, I am a tiger in the sack (shameless self-promotion,) but they can really get to bouncing around, and I pryed myself away from the rhythm concentration long enough to look down- jesus mary and joseph I had to stifle a laugh- but that is indeed what can be held accountable for the week-long soreness (and this morning's soreness.)  Anyway, just had to puff up my feathers, there. I love making these kinds of discoveries.

      Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck!  On way to breakroom for some caffeine libation I passed a mirror and instictively glanced in it only to find... purple lips.  Not just a few dots, like totally blotched, puffy purple lips- they got the shit bit out of them!  It looks like I have chewed a pen to its fruition and it came all over my lips. I now vaguely remember some furious biting during one particularly out of hand portion of last night.  Have lunch date with best friend and her parents in Savannah today and no shade of lipstick to disguise this catastrophe... This must be chic on some European runway, right? Fuck!  on a lighter note- hand came perilously close to box of krispy kremes in breakroom but I used the force to direct it instead to a coffee cup- phew. That was a close one.

      So I have been hugely preoccupied this whole week with echoes of last month's "thinking up baby names" quandary, but as I had to go to my yearly gyno checkup yesterday, it was doubly stressful. I was mentally prepared to have some new scary doctor come in with my cup 'o pee and say, "And I have some good news- you're pregnant!" Damn that early withdrawal method.  Getting IUD next month- cannot wait. Baby prevention that lasts up to 10 years with ne'er a thought. Boyfriend calls it "I get to come in you?" device. We poured over the information sheet at dinner laughing giddily about our soon-to-be good fortune. Cannot wait. Going to be best $500 I've ever spent.  So everything went well (no bebes- but had thought up Catesby, Charlie and Grady) and I went (baby-free) to the liquor store and got some tequila, went home and laid in my hammock in my bathrobe with a big margarita and a smile.  In keeping with the celebratory chain of events of the afternoon, when boyfriend got home I went down to pay a visit (in new Vince off shoulder shirt- thanks, mom + saks), homemade cheese quesadilla in one hand and a pitcher of leftover 'Ritas in the other, just in time for the NBA draft at 7:30.   So while he watched the draft, munched on quesadilla and margaritas and kicked back, I happily gave him a masterful blowjob, then resigned to a nap. Am I not the most perfect girlfriend? Jesus.  Fastforward to amazing sex for 2 hours- which resulted in "island bed-" where we somehow jolt the bed out into the middle of the room. I slept wonderfully, to say the least.  Planning trip to his house in Taos, New Mexico to fuck in the hottub outside while it's snowing. I think I might be in love.

      Last night HBO featured a hugely entertaining Real Sex (what number, I do not remember; #80? #132? Must be up there pretty high, since I've been watching these shows on mute after my parents went to sleep since I was in 7th grade.) It was centered on an anal sex seminar called Butt Sex 101.   My roommate was watching it upstairs and I was watching it downstairs, our laughs filling the apartment simultaneously as various flabby women gave it to their husbands up the ass with strap-ons. Pretty vulgar little program. Never seen so many aholes in my life. There was even a plastic spiderhole to pass around and play with. I guess it was karma for my 'quake hole' discussions of yesterday.  This morning pseudo didn't have to wake up until 11 so I went down to his apartment and crawled in bed with him for some pre-work snuggles.  I was overcome by the mushy-ness of the situation as I lay with his head on my chest, playing with his hair planting little kisses on his head while I softly recounted the HBO starhole special. I listened to him drift in and out of snoring and smiled thinking how this guy is probably my best friend here. However, in keeping with our inability to keep our hands off eachother, with 6 minutes to go he had my pants off, and when I finally left for work, my satin skirt was a wrinkled mess and my knees a little weak.  My computer is finally up and running again, after it crashed this morning, presumably after I looked at a sexual picture yesterday- so in an effort to clean up my tracks before the IT person came to fix it, I did a scanning program and something came up called: SexList.  Needless to say this induced much laughter, now I'm sure there's an office rumor that I look at porn. Which I so do not do (grew out of that phase in college.)  Have mom's credit card number; will spend.

      This day blows.  I have a terrible hangover. And I'm getting nothing done.  holy shit, ha- roommate/deskmate just now discovered that I changed the radio station to some slow, smooth jams station- being the card-carrying racist he is, he was appalled; me, I will sing along to "Everybody Plays the Fool" and daydream about what that Neville brother's giant birthmark tastes like.  Anyway, I just ate a box of those veggie chips that a coworker of mine claims she doesnt like. Pretty sick. Girls are so weird. I have a feeling she only said she didnt want them and gave them to me so I'd eat them and bear the brunt of their caloric quantity- not a big fan of girls.  "My Girl" was playing on the radio before roommate and I went to go get cokes from the breakroom and as I shoveled ice in my cup I made up a little ditty to the "My Girl" tune:  me: "Quake hole (quake hole, quake hole!) Talkin' bout... quake ho-ho-ole... quake hole!  I dont need no quake hole... I got tha month of may..." roommate: Actually you do need a quake hole, or you'd probably die.  me: Holy... hell. We'd all die if we couldn't shit.  roommate: My grandmother was once in the hospital cause she couldnt crap. She was literally, 'full of shit.' me: High five for granny when she finally pinched off that heat stick, eh?  So last night at Gilroy's, 5 vodka cranberry cocktails deep, I was pretty sober but drunk enough to make a terrible scene about pseudo staring at this tall, statuesque blond - with one eye- using the other one in conversation with me. Oh, and he was trying to get me to eat the pizza (remember: 'we need to feed these.') So, in sticking with my ever-present fatal flaw of wicked insecurity in the face of something that actually is a mutual source of love and adoration for me (translate: he loves me how I am, I adore him- so I conjur up said blonde in order to pick a fight, get more reassurance to my own outward appearance, whine and in the end, attempt to destroy something I really want, just for the sake of destroying it- hmm, FEAR.?), I bitched and cried and woke up today to realize the absurdity of my actions.   Can I just say, on a serious note- in a perfect world, no one would be sickeningly beautiful, hugely wealthy, name dropping designers or breathing on the spot on the hood of their car then wiping it away with an elbow. Actually, the only thing that would matter to anyone would be finding that one person you're meant to be with, at least the one you can stand, laugh with and who keeps you on your toes- no matter what the inside label of your shoe says. THAT would be the source of happiness.  That being said, when I was lying in pseudo's bed this morning, he leaned over to look at me, smiled, put one finger up to his mouth to say "sssh," paused, then farted. If I didnt already know it, I knew then, I've got the one for me.

      It is absolutely pouring outside. Too bad my pee-on status in this office only offers me a window view when I'm going to a. kiss someone's ass or b. going to pee.  Huge daydreaming for me today. Rain making me want to be scrumping pseudo on a boat out in the ocean somewhere, or rolling around in a sleeping bag in a tent (or any such outdoor venue where rain can be enjoyed.) Email from him really turning me on:  "Just started to rain very heavily here - really coming down.  I wouldn't mind being knee deep in the Madison right now fishing for big browns and rainbows watching bald eagles fish beside me.  Man that was the life."  Lord, could he be any hotter?  Rain + hot, rugged fly fishing pseudo-boyfriend causing me to browse online for various, unneccessary outdoor items: North Face fleece, raincoat, hiking boots, Tarponwear fishing shirt, new LL Bean backpack, reminscent of one I had in 8th grade. Saw girl last night at gym with an awesome Orvis tote like my dad's... might have to spring for one of those.   Racking brain for last four digits of mom's credit card number...

      So after I go running on the Battery last night, soaking in the huge houses and the Mercedes, Porsches and BMWs, I returned home sweaty and hungry (hungry being the operative word: I am a such an amateur at this anorexia shit) to a phone call from pseudo saying I had 5 minutes to get my ass in gear for a Norm's Pizza mission- beers and pool.  In a ploy to appear more adventurous, low-maintenance and a general "good sport," (I am a good sport: have endured hand of ball smell on face, many a dutch oven, post-tobacco-dipping kisses and thorough discussions on how many ass-wipes different varieties of shits require-- ok, I laughed through that one, but...) I went to said pizza joint in running gear, sans shower. Quelle stinkpot!  At pizza place, 2 pitchers of Papst Blue Ribbon deep, a little maharaja of a man showed up and began circling our pool table pointing out shots and yelling at our friend, The Terrier, to quit ignoring his "ad-wice." He was small, he was brown, and he was shouting and spinning about like a hairy, glassy-eyed dradle... Fiesty as he was, I believe he just wanted some friends, but anyhoo we played "Name That Drug,", laughed into our beers then finally got him gone with a few faux-threatening swings of the pool cue.  My point is, I had another brush with potent racism last night as the only thing I could think of while watching said bombed brownie was, "He looks just like the Indian 7-11 worker I knew back in middle school," that my best friend and I called Raj-Raj. A man of perpetual cherry red-lips (could be the access to Slurpee, could be some new bindi lip stain very hot in India but not quite into the swing of things in Richmond, VA), Raj Raj might not have even been his name, but it was fitting, and he sold me Lik-M-Aid, Charleston Chews, daily horoscope rolls and The National Enquirer; and I liked him.   Or Habeeb (I think we all had a Habeeb in our underage drinking phases) who sold us Boone's Farm at the Penny Saver on the dumpy side of town. A proud owner of a mint-green Toyota Corolla (once again, should not know this) Habeeb facilitated many a wasted night for me. Thank you, Habeeb.  And for that matter, thank you Indians. Without you, there'd be no Apu, no Yoshi (10th grade boyfriend) to instill in me the fear of an uncircumsized penis, no college algebra teacher that caused me to fail because I just could never get over how he said "And den, you diwide, de nummbah..."

      Today has been chock full of references, jokes and racial slurs towards the Asian population. Brings a tear to my eye.  1. I was trying to shove a huge stack of paper into a hole punch and it was rough going: "This is like trying to shove Shaq in a tiny asian woman." (isn't he banging a tiny asian woman? what a huge dong.)  2. Random Asian girl (ok, I at least have the resources to sound more knowledeable and less ignorant/racist on this one: she is actually Korean. But see? Do we care?), who had my position before me, emailed back to say hi to some ex-coworkers.... and attached a few photos. Apparently she moved back to the motherland- photo of her plus 4 Koreans with blond streaks and purple eyeshadow. Said roommate, who sat by her for 3 weeks:  "Man, now which one is she? I can't tell. They all look the same. All Asians look the same. Damn slant-eyes." (I love people from South Carolina.)  3. My inability to stop going "Hiiiiyyy- ohhhhhhh!", a la Ed McMahon, Chinese chop-on-table chef, an Asian version of one of the Seven Dwarves, etc., etc.....  4. Another co-worker said there's nothing he'd rather see less than two Asian people having sex (to which I responded, or an Asian girl having explosive diarreah on herself, in a bathtub, wearing knee socks....) See link below and brace yourself.  www.tubgirl.com   Have a great day, and.... HIIIIII-OHHHHHH!!!!  Getting no work done. Random outbursts of laughter (followed by either Asian sound, imitation or reference.)

      Some biatche in a stupid Mitsubishi Galant (embarassed I even know the variety of middle-class, depressing automobile) who just moved into my building has bought the parking space I've been stealing for the past 6 months. I remarked to my roommate/deskmate:  me: "Fuck that slut in the stupid Mitsubishi."  roommate: "She'll probably turn out to be your best friend or something."  (after he receives one very hairy, mean look from me...)  roommate: "Come to think of it, she drives a Mitsubishi, so probably not."    Yay for snobbery! Love the little bubble of cleanliness, $80 face cream and premium-octane gasoline I live in.

      Whenever it rains here in the morning and I'm walking down the street to my office buildling, I'm whisked back to my days in France when I was 16. It always rained in that place, and there were always huge buses blowing crap on you from the street and everything smelled like breakfast. What a miserable corner of the world.   There's nothing worse than being homesick, fat (and getting fatter) and under the watchful eye of a drugged up, crazy ex-nurse who tells you in broken English- "Eef you want le lunch, yoouh pahck eet youh-sulf."  Little things kept me going on this trip (and kept me eating,) like the multitude of random dog shit deposits along the city streets (friend and I took many photos of these), one giant infected goat anus at a French provincial vineyard (photographed this, too) and a spraypainted grafitti sentence on the wall of the busstop: "Fuck the Frogs."  I guess the France memories can be attributed to more than stank buses and the cafe's fragrant bacon wafting across Meeting Street- I have put on a few lbs, here, people. I blame it completely on new love interest who, not without a hefty desire to eat, himself, constantly showers me with flattery about being "too skinny" and needing to "feed these" (grabs a handful of one of my tits.) Under such conditions, pizza, fajitas, cookies, chips and lots and lots of beer seem quite appropos.  I had some strawberries this morning and am pounding black coffee until I'm somehow deflated back to normal size.   Morning sex session today solid- rain outside, icy air-conditioning, eyes still crusted shut- really not feeling being at work today.  Have more to share later. Must maintain some semblance of responsibility/productivity or my new powder blue Marc Jacobs suit I wore today will just mock my unprofessionalism...

      Have not taken lunch break today in feeble stab at being anorexic for the next 2 weeks. Really giving me terrible heartburn.  supposed to go to departing coworker's happy hour party at fancy shmancy hotel bar across street after work at 5 but dont see myself making it, as I cant have drinks before I go to the gym and loosely made a pact with myself this morning to not drink beer/ more than a glass or two of wine for the next 2 weeks. I believe it can be done!  Oh- I bought some of that K-Y Warming Liquid the other day- just to see- "creates a gentle warming sensation"- turns out you dont need this stuff if you're as unbelieveably horny as I am- only makes for a greater mess. Might try it out at work just for fun.  oh- news flash! Psuedo is no longer "psuedo..."- I think I have a boyfriend! (DAMN hot gym lover for waiting 4 months to call me again until NOW! Might just keep that number stored in the old cell.)

      Last weekend was great. Parents came to town and met boyfriend (loved him), successfully avoided ex-boyfriend who was in town (sans knowledge of current boyfriend, so called me 37 times moaning to my answering machine. fag.), met brother's new girlfriend, broke ankle in new JLo lucite heels (well, not sure yet, going to get xray during lunch today) and bought a plethora of goodies at Williams-Sonoma.  Confused about life as of late, however. Things with boyfriend escalating beyond any level I've ever experienced before, and without a set precedent to dictate what I should do, I'm sort of scared and thrilled and nauseous at the same time.  So life starts changing without your even knowing it and then all of a sudden everything is different, or on the parapet of being different, and before you know it you're getting a new job, a new apartment, moving somewhere where you have no friends, no life, following the person you think you might be in love with and all the things you held on to and leaned on for so long are let go of like a handful of sand on a windy beach.  Boyfriend and I went out to dinner at Basil last night and sitting across from him in the loud, dark restaurant, he dribbled out excitement-laced monologues about all the things we could do, places we could go, together, in our new town... and he reached his hand across the table and covered mine with his and said, "You always get quiet when I talk about this. You don't want to move. I can tell." Which is totally untrue, all I want is to be around him, but I'm just so scared. Scared cause it could be so fantastic.  Just as scared as I was the one time I was sitting at my desk in college listening to Dashboard Confessional realizing that Major Jones, the most evil heartbreaker, really didn't care about me. It's those harsh realities, good and bad. They shake you to the core.  I have one hand painted with my new Essie Boathouse polish and the other is bare because people keep on walking past my desk making a nailpainting mission impossible. Hoping my ankle is not fractured; awaiting email from boyfriend; gagging on black coffee; wondering why shoe repair place has not called me back about my new satin Prada heels; pondering the direction of my life....

      In furthering my quest to be Jessica Simpson (purely with an eye for fashion and accessories) I have finally gotten a Cecilia du Bucourt shawl!!! So excited. Can only find them on ebay. Yips for me.   http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3490214021&ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT

      Uh oh.  So I ventured a guess that perhaps more than a few of my buddy secretaries around here had stopped liking me- I could just tell they weren't as charmed by me as they used to be when I was a hard-working, ass-kissing little worker bee. Perhaps due to my leaving early and pretty much not even showing up lately, I was right- just sucks to hear it rather than wonder about it.  Anyway, really need a new job bad. Don't like being disliked.  Late night of wine and scrabble and I feel like butthole and just want to go to bed. Big weekend- parents coming in town and taking boyfriend out to dinner. First-time meet for dad. Big time.  I forsee myself throwing up at 2:30 today. Creeper hangovers the worst.

      So I didn't come to work yesterday. If I have to hear one more time "so and so was looking for you" or "hungover yesterday?" or "you could have called..." I will unleash my wrath upon these zombies in the form of 7 plagues: 1. permanently extended middle finger 2. evil glares 3. gaseous releases 4. unexplained outbursts of tourette-ish swear words and dirty insults (hairy vagina bastard fat fucker ahole bitch!) 5. "I will be paying someone like you to be doing this for me in a few years, and I will be paying them better." 6. "Who told you that was ok to wear today? Fucking idiot." 7. post-it on forehead that says "Fuck off." (oouf, that was some mean shit.)  Anyway, went to minor-league baseball All-Star game post-party after having 2 gin martinis in apartment before hand. Could not resist having said martinis while in bathrobe with hair up in curlers. Against specific instructions laid out by boyfriend, I wore an extremely bust-exposing little Nanette Lepore number (he said the horny players would be looking if I wore something sexy, so to cover it up. whoops.) and indeed got plenty of attention, which I will not deny facilitating (come on, some of them were really cute.) The final straw for boyfriend was when one who I had been mouthing to all night came up in and said, "You've got a tight looking woman right there." (ego just inflated 13%.)  So I woke up yesterday morning at 1 and decided work wasn't going to be an option; met boyfriend and the Terrier for lunch at the Kickin Chicken, watched some Cubs then went to run the dogs at the park. Fun times. Quelle beautiful rainy day.  Afternoon nap preceded by "quick feel" as we call it. Quick feel usually involves one of us saying "Man, I'd really like to feel a little penis in vagina right now," followed by explosive giggles, then one or the other climbing on top and the 2 minute "quick feel" turns into a marathon sex mission, segueing into a really solid nap.   I am in relationship bliss. Finally, someone I'm enormously attracted to, who is my best friend, laughs at farts and they like afternoon pre-nap sex. I mean, seriously. Let's seal this deal.
