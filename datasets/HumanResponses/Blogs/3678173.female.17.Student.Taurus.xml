      derek broke up with me. i was talking to him and i mentioned that my voice must be as repulsive as my touch or something...being spiteful, and he says "where is this coming from? what have i done? i don't understand. this is all coming from you." trying to make me feel bad, outright lying to me, trying to pretend it was all okay when i knew it wasn't. thats really the only thing that still makes me a little mad now. so i told him where it was all coming from. i know him, i knew. and we talked. he said he was messed up right now and he needed to be alone. he says he still loves me, still feels the same but he needs to be alone. my hands were shaking so bad i could barely hold the phone (yeah..the phone, i know). i started to cry but i didn't want him to hear me so i said i had to go. i wanted to go see brandon, he has that personality of someone who will always be there, and its good. so at two in the morning i set out across town. dave saw me crying so he wouldn't piss off. then he recalled maze had gone to the cabin to get it ready. im like "fuck"  so i came home and cried some more....when did i become so weak? when did this happen? ive always been the ice-queen (my fathers been calling me that for about six, seven years now) and now i am crying out of my own emotions? its weird. i called him at 3 30 in the morning, i didn't give a shit. i wanted him to say the truth, to tell me he didn't love me, to set the cold in my veins that would make me strong.  "tell me you don't love me," i said, "tell me the truth" "i still love you marlaina, i can't say that" "how can you love someone and not want to be with them?"  the truth is he doesn't love me the way i love him. other wise he wouldn't have broken my heart twice, otherwise i would be able to make him stay. to love him is to be hurt, and i know it. i just want it to go away. i don't want to love him anymore, but it won't go away, why won't it just go away? i don't want to hurt anymore.  so he needs to figure things out. i wish i could be angry at him. at least when he cheated on me i had my anger, and my pride, and i would not let myself go back to him, and tried for two years to forget him, trying guy after guy, ah i hate it. why do i have to fall in love with one who doesn't love me? im afriad that when he figures things out and is ready for a relationship, that i will just run back to him. just let myself be walked all over. i hate it. i hate how weak i am.  that was 3 days ago. we were fighting off and on since then. it was the saddest thing to watch how we had deteriorated, to see what we had become. and after that i thought for a long while, and i tried to figure things out and i realized "why am i being spiteful to him of all people?" i love him. and i think i always will, there will more than likely be more loves in my life ahead, but if you truely love someone it doesn't go away. life is a search for the person who will love you in return. i realized i don't want to add to his pain, to make it harder for him, i want him to be happy, whether it is with me or not. this new revelation has made things better, ive stopped crying now, it still hurts oh god it still hurts, i feel like i am hollowed out, he was my good thing, he filled me up. i still want him, hopelessly, devouringly, and irrationally.

      mmm i was up till four in the morning last night and fuck am i shanked to hell. everybody came over and watched the texas chainsaw massacre. i heard that it was based on a true event, and im watching this, and im like, no fucking way...only the "police footage" made me wonder. so i looked it up afterwards and i was right, it is bullshit. there was no massacre with 5 teenagers and a crazy guy with a chainsaw. however, the habits and the character of the villian were loosely based on a real guy though, ed gein (sp?) and he was creepy as fuck. liked to dig up dead woman and put thier genetalia in female gich and wear it around all day. Made a nipple belt, a vest of human skin, he cut their faces out and would wear them as masks, etc. the real stories very disturbing.  then brandon stayed around and we talked and played an amazing hentai game till 4 30. We always have the best conversations. sometimes i feel like he knows me better than anyone, even derek, but that could also be coming from the shit we've being going through lately. we talked about things and it was good. we are joined somehow by an unseen bond... i don't quite know how to describe other than his essence is known to me and appreciated.   he loves me still. i remember 2 years ago, or was it three? and brandon and derek both told me they loved me. that was when i was still an icequeen. i told them they had to be mistaken, it was only lust, only lust... no one could love me anyhow. ah god i cared about them so much, i care for them even more now. the memory tears me up inside. makes me want to scream and do wild things. i wish i could make two of me. one for brandon and one for derek if it makes them happy. i love them both, but different loves. different confusions. i hate the world sometimes. how i am causing the ones i care about the most pain. i can still taste the bitter irony.

      i almost missed my chemistry exam this morning. i thought it was in the afternoon but i guess it was in the morning, but thankfully my brother calls me up and is like "what are you doing?!?!?!"  me: "sleeping...what the fuck do you think im doing its nine in the fucking morning" (im not very pleasant for about an hour after waking) dave: "well you better hurry. christine and freddy are here and they say that they have chemistry right now" me: "fuck"  so i ended up being a half hour or so late. if i hurried prolly could have gotten there in ten minutes, but i didn't feel like hurrying. it went alright tho. managed to bullshit my way through the majority of it although i left one question blank.   mmm got my social major project back, got 97% on it which is good because my average is shitty. with the extra 3% i get on my final mark for getting that damn thing in early i should hopefully (knock on wood) be above 80.

      hes growing distant and i can feel it. when he came down this weekend i felt as though we were worlds apart, and after a year of being together it was more than slightly disconcerting. i tried to talk to him about it and he says he's sorry and he needs to figure some things out, his priorities, his plans before he'll be good again.   i wonder where i stand in those priorities.   i hate it all. i hate myself for not being the person i want to be, and should be. I hate how weak i am.  i hate that i want him so badly and he is so indifferent to me. I hate how my desire for him annoys him. I hate how i need him more than he needs me i hate how he can never share things with me. i selfishly want to be the one he talks to when hes all mixed up like he is right now, the one he figures things out with. I hate how instead, im the one on the other side of the chasm trying to reach out to someone who doesn't want to be reached. I hate how i feel more alone right now then ever before.

      fuck has it been hot here these past few days. jimmy's is nice and cool&nbsp; and no ones been at home allowing me to strip everything off. i invited brandon daymen and kathy over to fuck around for a bit yesterday. brandon got here first and we decided to act like a pair of jilted bitches and&nbsp;whipped out the ice cream, &nbsp;two spoons, &nbsp;and sat on the love&nbsp;seat eating it while talking about various things with&nbsp;little clothing on us.&nbsp;lol soon after&nbsp;daymen shows up (late as always lol) and he looks in the front window (hope the neighbors enjoyed the show) and&nbsp;says "what the&nbsp;fuck are you two doing....??" lol he joined us shortly afterwards. we played mario party..it was all wonderfully exciting i tell you. fuck i hate summer. everyone has lives and better places to go and i dont and am&nbsp;left partying with adrian for my friday nights...not that i don't enjoy his company just...yeah.   mmm kathy got her ass stuck in house arrest again. lol she's always stuck in the house during the summer. i guess that night she and brandon went to her house for a while, brandon fell asleep and she was going to wake him up after he rested for a bit "he looked so peaceful..." and the cunt fell asleep herself. they were rudely awakened from their extremely erotic dreams when brandons mum comes to see if he is here because he is late for work. mmm things like that leave a bitter taste in your mouth. Stupidity i think. lol i did the same thing....a few times lol mmm and jimmy is being a real cock about it. thinks i am lying to him when i say i was sleeping when they left. well fuck you then   &nbsp;&nbsp;oii, waxed my legs. fuck did that hurt. i was only three strips in and i wanted to stop. lol prolly could hear me hollering god knows what for blocks down. mmm pain

      lol i collapsed in the restaurant today. it was actually kind of amusing. these people came in and i went to give them some coffee and anyways, first step out of the kitchen it was&nbsp;as though i was unplugged from the&nbsp;room "ohh fuck" i said. jimmy and robert heard me and asked what was wrong. "mm nothing i just got realy dizzy there for a moment. so i went and gave the people there coffee and went to go&nbsp;get the menus and&nbsp;it was like the floor fell out from beneath me. i put the coffee on the table and went to pull a chair out from the table and i just wasn't fast enough and i kinda slowly fell to the floor. fuck that must have been funny to see. the customers were all going, "what the fuck?!?!?!" and jimmy and robert were buzzing around lifting me up, giving me juice, lecturing me on my color. lol being sweetly annoying. kathy right there in the brunt of it. "get her some juice" she says to jimmy. just about shit myself. lol   other than that not much else is going on. look at this town...fucking miracle when something does happen.
