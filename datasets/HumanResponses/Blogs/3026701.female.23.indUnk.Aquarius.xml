         Dangeresque #1 is my first zine in almost 3 years. I'd rather not talk about my last one right now, but I used to run Screamqueen Distro if that helps.  It's half-size, about 28 pages, the cover is hand-stamped and embossed, and the zine is handbound - sometimes with black thread, sometimes with minty floss. It depends.  It's mostly essays, three of which are about films. Secretary, 28 Days Later, and The Shining are written about. I've also reprinted my research paper on Riot Grrrl I did about a year-and-a-half ago. But by no means is this an academic zine. It may be text heavy, but I tend to avoid academic language and prefer to have things as reader and user-friendly as possible.  I've decided to sell it at $2 right now for US people, $2.50 for non-US people. With Paypal fees (yes, my account can accept credit cards), it'll be $2.36 US/$2.88 INTL. My e-mail & Paypal address is  urlLink dangeresque@REMOVETHISPARTgmail.com .  If you want to order it via snailmail, please e-mail me or PM me for my address. I do not have a P.O. Box anymore.

         These were made using conversation hearts leftover from Valentine's Day (um, go to any store that sells seasonal candy the day after the holiday and stock up! I got each box for 25 cents each!), glaze, magnets, and a hot glue gun. The magnets are 0.5 inches wide, and I got a pack of 50 at Michael's for $5.99 (you can get it for less than that if your local paper puts Michael's sales ads in them on Sundays, they usually have a 40% off coupon in there).   I haven't decided if I'm going to sell these online yet. If I table at the Bizarre Market in Richmond on June 26th, I may sell them there first.   Oh yeah, the Necco candy company is putting some strange things on their conversation hearts these days. I have quite a few that say "LET'S READ" and a couple that say "FAX ME". The hell?

        Samples/Various Front Covers     Inside of one book     Inside spine of one book  I have made some small notebooks using cut up Wonder Woman calendars as the covers. The notebooks, when opened are 3 1/2" x 5", 3 1/2" x 2 1/2" when closed. There are 60 pages in each book. The notebooks are handbound with floss, so they smell minty fresh. The paper used is recycled acid-free copy paper, and construction paper is used as the inside cover. With the exception of the copy paper, everything I used was stuff I already had lying around the house. It should be noted though, that Wonder Woman is not on all covers of the books, at least not all front covers. Sometimes she is on the front, sometimes on the back, sometimes barely at all. It depends on the notebook, since each are different.  If you would like to order one, it is $1.50 postage paid in the US per book, $2 postage paid outside of the US per book. Wholesale rates can be worked out for distros, etcetera. I can accept Paypal, although fees would have to apply. If you would like to order via snailmail or Paypal, contact me at  urlLink thatimpossiblesound@yahoo.com  for more information. When ordering, please let me know if you absolutely have to have one with Wonder Woman on the front cover, or on there at all, or if you just want me to choose one for you randomly.
