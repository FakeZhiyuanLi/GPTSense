       An early start with lunch in the Community Club jointly organised by The Indian Activity Group. It was going to be a boring saturday, but eventually, thanks to Harriet it wasn't just an ordinary boring saturday. The gigs at youth park was boring. Nothing much actually because the irritating josh was there. That makes it even worst. Went off halfway to have dinner in cineliesure and got myself a bottle of e33. Which was humbly shared with Harriet. Draw down to Paragon to get my new really really big wallet. Great neated and pull-up bag in black. The next stop was at Kovan interchange. Some ordinary gig, but it was a great experience. Eventually all of them were so simple. Wait till The Piggery haunts the stage. Partying and drinking section was next, but it eventually ended up in a fight. What a plesent situation it was.

       Such a day of absolut calmness. Never really went hectic. It's of such beautiful presence and enjoying myself with certain laughter and joy. I guess my trying to get back together into this certain chapter is going smoothly. English lesson turned out well. Such great personal experience shared by Mrs Manmohan, gives me various mind-views of both myself and corey. I finally realise that time is the most important subject of all time. It's of great treasurence and patience is needed no matter how bad the situation gets. Supposing I'd then just let things cool off and carry on with life. Someday sooner after the situation settles in calmness, then maybe things would be realise and considered. Had a great long walk with Rachael after slacking with Huilin and Suman. Had really open mindsets of the various situation. Thanking Rachael for atleast believeing in corey and getting things back together could be uphold. Slacking sensation seems to be very crazy. With people like Rachael and Huilin, well things can get worst criticising both parties. It was great fun by the way.

       Today I had suffered alot. Not only on what that I've done, also to that of how my dear bestfriend had treated me. It's very very painful when he gets up to this kinda behavious. It's really very unreasonable. Can't imagine that he even swear and curse at me. Was I that of harm to him? I still don't understand. It looks like he hates me alot. It's of no reason to behave in such a manner. Not only that of how he was, he also said the most heart breaking sentence that he'd not want to talk to me anymore. Isn't it so painful when you've thrown in all that effort and suddenly it comes to an end like this. Don't one would feel all used and of in great pain when such a thing happens? Why can't he think of how I've suffered and not think for others? Why can't he just spare few moments thinking of my pain? Isit that I'm of worthless to him? No one understands why it ends in such behaviour. Because when that thing happened in the morning, he was behaving as normally as possible. Smiling, laughting and joking away. Now thats of great pain to any human being.

       Ordinary day in school. But 5 periods of maths is sickerning. I skipped that damn IT thingy. I find it a waste of time. No mood to eat. No mood to do anything. He says that he still hold some sort of grudge against me. But why I don't understand. That makes me very sad. And I suppose that today would be the saddest day of my life. On how much that I've begged you and you won't want to accept all that I've said. You've thought all for youself and you've never thought about me just a single bit. Your anger&nbsp;plays now an important role in your life.&nbsp;Maybe I'll&nbsp;plunge to my death and you'll know how much I want you back. I've got no other choice.&nbsp;

       Today was kinda stress. Well, It was such a waste I wasn't at canteen arena. That blady ugly looking keling want to find fault when I'm not around. I'm going to pound on them tomorrow. The head, Faiezad have been informed and he'll be in school tomorrow.

       Such a horrible day in school. Not only that I woke up at 8:20am for school, I had to face almost mustness as well. I'm talking about RACHAEL. I don't think it's fair for you to be so silent towards me and ernie. Well, if you wanna things to cool down then you could have told me. I said I wanted time off. I didn't say we don't have to talk no more. I can't believe you turn up to be in this way. Well, if you're willing to lose a friend, then I don't mind. Cause it's you who made that decision and not me.  I'm quite felief today. Was able to spend sometime chatting and smsing the one that I've part with pain. I think one goes and another come. But I would want both. Can't believe I nearly died today. Crossing the road blindly is becoming a trend.

       Today would be the 3rd week that we've prolong muteness. It's quite long actually and even people who're not close to me begin to wounder whats wrong with things. 3 weeks for a best friend to be ignored is far too much time already. But I suppose I'll be waiting again for the right time that he would speak. For I hope things are fine around him and his swifting his way along the streets joyfully. For this side ain't a good or nice shot to be in. Suffering everyday from any memories that I could dig up to. I've also reach up to a state of dead emotions. Smiling and laughting with tears and the eager to cry. =)

       Alone from the skies turn bright till the dawn rise above upon us. Without a single soul to bother, I flock around the greatest moments of life alone to the park. Taking some really good breath-stopping walks and later to woodland's causeway point to get myself workedup. It was fun indeed but I still miss those smiles I use to share with one another. Will it ever return? Or will I just have to be like this forever?

       Such a confused and lonely day it was today. For the first time ever, we had to lean back and enjoy the fan for tamil lesson as I presume we've not done a single work. Sitting there and shit-chatting our lives away. English was such a fake, not only had we gota put on our mask infront of our special guest, I actually swept the whole classroom.&nbsp;Not to mention about recess, Huilin threw the ice at those kelings, and those kids think that I was the one who threw that cube. How could I have done that when I don't even have a cup of ice beside me? Well, I suppose they caught their scapegoat due to that of how enemy we are towards each other.   &nbsp;

       What a trip. What a trip. The tour guide, mr wong was a real weird person. At times his voice just gets too high and get us in great shock. And the boat was a wavey experience. Felt like puking but I suppose sleeping was the perfect time round. It's tiring actually and I really feel back pains due to the constant sitting.

       Such a heavy day it was today. It was racial harmony day and well, the school looks more like a mini pasar malam. Everyone is selling everything, not to mention that some were actually putting themselves on sale due to bad business. Running around in ethenic costumes trying to get as much customers as possible. What a pity. Also had my tamil N' level oral examination and I suppose I spoke my hearts out, the invegilators must have been so touched and just had their tamil rubbed off. Such demystifying convosation titles.

       Such a hectic day it was today. I had to face the DM early in the morning for throwing a fork at my innocent schoolmate. The punishment was to clean the canteen till this friday. Today I teared in school for the first time. Everyone was in shock[not really everyone, cause some didn't care.] to watch me in despair. Had a real talk with Mrs Tai and she explained to me whatever that I've to do and I feel that well, if he don't wanna talk or he don't care about me even if I cried, it must just be that his not ready for anything. I'll forgive him and i'll just leave him alone I suppose till he feels the right time to turn his face towards me. But I still do care for him and I DON'T hate him. Hope for this moment to pass us fast and I can stretch a smile without putting a mask.

       Suffering from the moment of joy. I begin to develop hate and great anguish. It's not easy anymore and I'm suffering every moment of it. Feeling fustrated for the slightest things and I feel very weak standing in such position. I feel the blood running down the center of my palm and dripping all over the place. What am I going to do next? And thanx to Manmohan, now even my form teacher knows about my cutting wrist. Please stop adding to the burdon. I'm really feeling weak and not strong already. To add on to the loosing of blood.  &nbsp;

       Down from day to night it's just another boring saturday. Went out with Mom to do some administration stuff. Bought myself two shorts. What a relief after just surviving with two shorts. Hope the day pass fast for tomoroow and monday. Wishing for the best during school.

       School was just ordinary today. Nothing special happened. Just felt so not in the mood for any sort of education at all. Mother tongue was kinda cool. Talked alot with Saleh, Kartik and Suman. Can't believe that Kartik lost his brand new phone. Had to lend him mine which was with Fadzulie. Recess was great. Well, after throwing some ice at those fucking indian keling bitches. They deserve it, don't they? Hope the normal academic soccer team would win this match cause they're playing soccer almost every afternoon. It's a waste if they don't win. Would be having dinner at some posh restaurent called Vanash at Indoor Stadium. Hope it goes smoothly. &nbsp;

       School was regular as possible. I got myself 31 cuts on my left wrist because I kinda wanna let all my anger/misry/quaries out physically then of keeping it all in my heart. But I guess I won't do it again cause I made Jas cry and I feel bad about it. Also I nearly got caught with my fags when my teacher told me to empty my bag. What luck? After school went smoking and ended up alone when Rach and Ernie had to go home and settle themselves their own things. Guess I'm just going to be alone another afternoon.        &nbsp;

       I'm begining to feel all alone. To feel very solitary to feel that no one is there for me to look upon accept that handfull. It's not really worth cause they ain't the people with that sort of lifestyle whom I seek to. Those who use to address me as a friend just died away like there ain't another day. It's hard to cope with such a notorious situation and I know I won't be able to do that. I've completly lost all my laughter and all those muscles that I've been widerning are fake. A black mask to overcome my misery. But there ain't any use of it cause deep down I do feel left out by the friends that were once there. Would things like this ever stop? Would people in such cruel world start getting their sense back? Will they start feeling for others? Or will they just drown in their own enjoyment and leave those who were there, out?

        The Fragile:   Still looking out for the one and always keeping an eye. Not being a stocker but being someone of an eagle eye. Wish for the clearence to be soon for that I could squeek a word soon     The Adam and great laughter:   One day out with Jas to catch ourselves MEAN GIRLS. It's really hilarious and I've got memories of our other movie we went to. She helped me on getting myself 2 bottles of alcohol for school tomorrow. I'll share, DON'T WORRY!     The general spectrum:   it's just raining and I hate it but love it. It's not good for an outing but it's a kind support for sleeping. Emotionally engaged with Nine Inch Nails. trent Reznor, you are the greatest.

       Took a ring, and it's time we have good meal during recess. Had various sorts of order, almost 30% of whom are ordering would be those I hate. Due to their selfish character. I did offer him a call too. Nothing really went good. It was ordinary. Oral was great. Cause I stutter along the passage but did great for my picture and convosation section. The invegelator is pretty. [1 of them only.]

        My thoughts:   Are things for real? Have you notice my scent? Or should I begin with a prelude? Don't you or won't you understand me? Will my feelings be true, that it's over?     My verdict:   It's time I humble down and start the fresh. I've all not wanted separation. Regardless of on which side it is. We shall never end up in tears, misery and despair. And we should let things go easy now. Complete depletion ain't the right track. For I humbly pray: We all get back together again.     Their words:   She had spoken. I've understood now. And her words are harsh. Her words are re-occurring in my mind. And Rachael would made it possible with all her sentences that she puke it all out on me. As her words are strong. And her sentences are all mighty towards me.

       Today would be the first of the worst day. I'm antisocial. Very much like someone who have been discarded after draining every single drop of asset from me. I know myself that I've not done a wrong so big to harm one physically or emotionally. The out come seems with over joy. I'm hurt deep down and I found to be a waste. And I doubt a job well done on my N' level oral examination. Can I last this downpour? Will I be approach or will the silence just stay forever?

       Saturday ended up with Social Studies Remedial for 3hours. Swiftly chagred home afer that and went to far east. Meet up with quite alot of friends even though I'm suppose to study there. Not to mention, getting caught up with 3 malay bapoks in town. Dancing and walking around town like bunch of lost souls. And caught up with few of my school mates. Like mad fools. Can't even behave themselves in public.

       A plain bore in the morning, as out tamil teacher keep blabbering on the importance of our homeworks and our behaviours. English seems to be in an understanding episode as I actually explain to my classmates on how I actually am regardless of my violentness. Accounts test was a hazard. I can't believe it's been actually called a mock test and we are all like throwing answers everywhere. It was so crazy and assuming Miss kwok giving total hope on us.

       Crazy appitie for a game of floorball regardless of my medical condition. Ring-a-round the court in conspiring the ball into the net. It was a hard knock as I seem to not be well added that burdon. Jieren was so retard with the stick. Not even taking the initiative to whack the ball once. Claiming that he don't wanna get himself all wet. Mother tongue seems to be kinda chaotic from other lessons. We seem to mock around more today. Pouring water on suman's file and emptying the hole-puncher in his pocket. And not to mention being the main culprit of damaging his file.

       Such a boring day it was. Pathetic afterschool we had, drooling our day at the tim sum coffee shop and of course cracking few jokes. Possibly great but yet it's not really a great kick off. Edmund's outing was really weird. Never expected something like that from him. Tomorrow would be one of the first few steps of Priority. Relating voicecheck on Linkin Park's One step closer, A place for my head and In the end. Interesting setlist, yet it is harder than I thought. Stressing every inch of my face muscle on their tracks. It was pretty easy from other bands.

       Simple saturday with almost 20% of the day sleeping. Went out to town alone just to rush upon my heavy heart with the increasing burdon that piles up every day. And down to bedok to catch up with my grandaunt and my cousin. Really miss them alot and glad that the contact bloom. Wish upon a thousand laughter for the future.

       Astonishment arises every second as the ring-a-bell arouses us with the annual National Day Celebration. Performances were covered with varid colours. The Hip-hop entertainment section was shit. Never more I wanna see them without a compertition and gaining glory. We're forming the SGSS's Alternative Rock band. Consisiting of Davin on Guitars, Hakim on Bass and Me on lead vocals. We're still planning on accruding a rapper, drummer and another guitarist. Please fill in your support and for the talented performers out there, we're seeking your position.

       Astonishing cleared doubts with Miss kwok over the incident. Infinate signs of relief. Thanking the mere unexpected closure's helper like Ai Zhen, Cindy, Dex, Davin, Shermane, Huilin and Ernie to be there for me. Regardless of the undefined friendship with the guys, I suppose they just tend to not be interested. They look upon my end and fall upon a sweet afternoon with my sour death. Can't blame this selfish approach cause either they can't stand like a man, they can't provide a fist or they wanna see me crippled. In either option, I do see everyone fitting in either one. But they just don't take the time to think that, if they were in my situation, I'll be sure helping them in their unrespected motive. Cause I'm of such great beings and they're of none.

       Oridinary space in school. Accounts lessons was a great hazard. Seemingly being a scapegoat of my classmate's rascalness and deligently scoling my teacher mad, I don't think i'm in the wrong at all. English lessons came to be a movie panorama. Chemisrty was a sleepover and common test was kinda simple. Speed it all thru with confidence and did all that I know. Can't imagine doing silly stuff and sharing retard moments with Jieren together with little gossips and giggles around by classmates. Not to mention, even smsing with Jas and Ernie at such moments. Soccer supporting wasn't that normal esp when Jieren was around. He seemingly took over corey's position as the joker. Laughting and creating nonsensical tricks like telling edmund to kick the ball to this express kid's face. And doing retard things to irritate any of our classmates as possible. Mom's birthday was celebrated in Swensen's and later at this most panoramic view at Bottle tree village. Such cold and spine-chilling breeze accompanied by the warm food treats and some heavy chat, well it seems relaxing. Planning a way down to that place again. Such a great experience.

       Wash upon a thousand drops of rain from up above so high. Unable to clear my vision and crossing streets blindly. Was waiting for the 3rd bus when I saw corey in it. For the first time, I didn't dare bored the bus regardless of whom my enemy is on it. I just flash a standstill and waited for another. Crossing down the alley into a stop as I gaze upon a sight of my cousin, vignesh. Walking together and sharing mindset of each other's problems. It's been a long while since we shared open topics. The route to school got diverted once Ernie got me a call in pleading me to wait for her, she was late. The chat between me and vignesh blossomed and I sincerely know how she finally feels. The day was fine and the spirits were quite low. Corey was sick and he had to go home. Message him twice to take care and to visit the doctor. Hope he does so, his got a match tomorrow. And hope his feeling better.

       I celebrate the mark of this very day in return of my long missed best friend, Thana. Fortunately from friendster and the thanking effort of Vignesh, I got back thana's contact. As usual, talking as much nonsense and feeding as much vital information as possible. Taking each other back to the track on where we started. Really miss her pressence, now that she's back. I need to mend things up with her. Got myself two beautiful books. 1 entitled World's worst murder and another with world's unsolved mysteries. Such interesting books Gonna start reading it to the end. It's rejoiceful now cause not only that I've gotten back my long time bestfriend, i've also complete the most sickerning homework of all time, Maths.
