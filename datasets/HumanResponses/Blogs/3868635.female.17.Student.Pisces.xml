      Oh my fucking god. Sorry about the language...but what the fuck is going on?! I'm so confused now. For the past two weeks, people have generally been shunning me. Friday night, I finally went out with Rox and Graeme. I found out that Laurie was supposedly the one who has lately not been able to stand me. Apparently she was telling everyone to basically not invite me. Well, I get home tonight, and guess who calls! So...is it really her and she was just bored tonight? Or is it someone else? What the fuck...I don't know who to talk to and who to believe anymore. It's so fucked up. Oh well, Julia gets home tomorrow, hopefully that will help to level me out a little bit. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I suppose my self esteem issues that I used to think that I deal with must not have been as greatly terrible as I had previous thought. If they were, then I probably wouldn't feel so much of a just popped balloon. This past week, I've been flying around like crazy, happy and confident one moment, and lonely and worthless the next. Now, my balloon has landed, deflated and limp on the dirty floor. I guess it has been poked at countless times over the past few years, but now they've all put their strength together, picked up the big needle and with one big prod, have managed to conquer. Right before I leave, I'm sure that we'll have a party or some type of meaningless gathering of the sort where I'll be able to mask what's really going on with drugs and alcohol and I'll feel a little better, but that's not until the last moment, and not before then because then perhaps some people's consciences may nag at them for not doing anything again until that last moment. At least then I'll be however many miles away from it all. They'll be able to form better excuses than "oh, I thought that you were busy." Everyone knows that that excuse is the ultimate bullshit. You had no intention of contacting them, and then you say that with the 50% chance that you'll be right. I am not stupid, I've been on the other side of this for a long time. I suppose Karma has just flipped the tables. What I don't understand is how come just me? Things couldn't be better for everyone else. They're always busy, if not working or with their boyfriends or families, then each other. Me? Well, I tried to go out with Mom, that consisted in looking for stuff that she needed until she got tired. The one night that I got invited out with everyone, they all knew that that was the one night that I had already had plans. It must be bad though, because forever now they'd cleared tonight to try to have a party somewhere. I managed to get the house to myself until midnight or so, with my parents out who don't' mind drinking that much anyways. I'm not going to kid myself, that's all that they wanted to do anyways. They wouldn't even accept that, rather, they didn't acknowledge it and just went off and made their own plans. I suppose they've got something planned for tomorrow night, and Sunday, I'll get home with an email in my inbox from last night at 8pm saying, "Hey Katie! Wow, it's been sooo long! We miss you! That's why you HAVE to come to  > and we'll party! I hope that you haven't left for your aunt's cottage yet, Love, so and so." Ya, bullshit. At 8pm on Saturday night I hadn't yet left for a cottage that I was going to for the weekend. I'd be willing to bet that's what will happen. Unless word doesn't spread that I'm actually going, and then I'll get a call on Sunday night when everyone else gets&nbsp;home from work&nbsp;saying "Well, it's too bad you work on Sundays because we would have loved your company at the party last night." Didn't stop anyone else! But then again, according to everyone, I don't' actually work anyways. I feel like I'm in some type of Stepford Friends situation. I just don't understand it all. But I suppose I did have it coming. I've had it coming for awhile, and I guess I've dodged it for long enough. Although I'm still pissed off that it was not always at all just me who didn't' want other's to go and I"m being punished. Holy Fuck, I"m selfish. Not that I have anyone else in life to care about. Every one seems so fake and superficial. I just want to know why. Why now? What happened? There are several other times where I could justify all of this, but why now? Oh well, I suppose there's really only 2 more weeks of this. After that, sure I'll be home for another week, but if I really get bored, I'll pay $20 and leave the city and go to MY apartment. Well, mine and Julia's. Only 2 more weeks....

      40 hours I've worked this week. And people say that I don't have a real job...  So anyways, I spent my day in the office. Nothing terribly exciting came of that of course, I got alot done, people were in good moods. It was good considering...  I tried to not think too much about friends, family, school etc...It just can get to be too much.   Tonight Uncle Mur brought Mike, Dad and I out. That was quite enjoyable, I had a fun evening. It's been awhile since I've enjoyed myself like that-doing something I mean.

      Ok, so tonight was girls night. While everyone chattered about whatever mindless thought popped into their heads, I found myself wondering when that moment was, when was that moment that we all began maturing at different rates, our personalities spiraling off in oppisite directions? It's not that I didn't enjoy myself, but can I honestly still call them my best friends?   Who in the past could I have really called my best friends. Two people spring to mind, and interestingly enough both friendships were destroyed by relationships-one being engaged by both parties of the friendship, and one due to an outsider edging in. I find myself missing both, but particuarly one more than the other.  We have grown up together, knowing each other since we were 2. For awhile, I felt myself compelled to talk to her about issues, she seemed the most level with me. Especially for more worldly issues. She didn't mark me as strange when I would call at any random time and begin babbling on about some random conspiracy that I have just discovered, so my newest evidence that the wolrd will be ending soon. In fact, these phone calls were even reciprocated. We could talk about our lives, and the lives that we live. It never seemed to end, and while conversations with others would tend to follow down that never ending path, it would usually turn into a monotone drone on and on about the same old things. That, or into gossip about so and so. I hate when friendships reduce to that. The feeling that it is so necessary to have a conversation with someone that it isn't real, it's instead all about so and so.   I want so and so out of my life. They have plagued it for too long. I want conversations to regain meaning. Why don't I feel anything anymore? When was the last time that I did?   On my walk home this evening, i realized that I may appear as if I am becoming depressed again. But I don't feel depressed...should I? I just feel as if something is missing, that I'm lacking something that used to be there. Things just don't click when we're together anymore.   I just really want someone that I can talk to and have a connection with. Just someone that I can discover. I want to connect with another human-it's been so long since I have. I realize that this is becoming repetitive, but I don't care. I suppose I figure that if I talk it out, perhaps things will become more clear.   In fact, I am really glad that I have started this. Writing in my diary has just gotten depressing as before, I found myself writing it to someone. Someone that I could count on to always be there to invade my privacy. But I didn't mind, he knew me better than anyone, and I knew him. The bond that we share is inexplicable...who knows where it originated, and while we can deny, I am starting to realize that it will always be there. It's just a strange connection on who knows what level. I don't know if I have ever felt as at ease to tell anyone some of the stuff that I've told him. On top of all that, right before our friendship depleted due to the new coming relationship type thing, he experienced a whole side of me that no other has. I was able to express myself as a physical being and not only emotional. Now when I look back on it, I feel silly that he knows more about me than any other, and he is just another face in the hallway. I think that I have come to terms with it though, I just wish that I had someone new that I felt that comfortable with.   If I could be anywhere right now, I'd be lying on a grassy hill, looking up at the stars with the company of a human. I wouldn't care who, but just someone that I wouldn't feel compelled to talk to. Just another human beside me. Someone to cure my chronic loneliness. That's what I love about cities, crowds, just anywhere with people is the energy from other humans. I sometimes wish that I could stand in the middle of a crowd, invisibly and just take it in.   I had always vowed to not get hooked on drugs or alcohol because it is an escape, but that's what is happening. Days without having a joint or two are becoming nearly unbearable. Or just a shot or two. Anything to take a little of the responsibility off of me of having to behave. Behave in no matter what maner, it woulnd't matter. It's too hard to figure out how I should act...how do you know what to do or say? They help you decide, help you not care. Prom was amazing for that reason. I left inhabitions behind and just allowed myself to be taken over. As a result, I thouroughly enjoyed myself. I got to live my life as someone else. It was like watching a movie but I got to experience. For once I was the star that got to dress up, say those witty lines at the cheesiest of moments, throw caution in the wind and do as I wished. It was the perfect oppurtunity and I got to write the script. I didn't second guess a thing, I just acted impulsivly and it was the most amazing relieved feeling in the world.   Same sort of with the cottage, when I felt that I could not tollerate a situation, I had a beer or a rum and coke. I got relaxed. Although I'm disapointed that I did have that heroine with the weed, I don't regret it. I didn't feel as if I was out of control, my mind just-well I felt good. That felt good. I was relaxed. That's what cottages are for though, right?  I would like to know though the reason why my working is inferior to everyone elses. I put up with the same stuff, I worked just as much this week as everyone else. So what? I get paid a little more. That's just in the description of my position. I didn't apply for a minimum wage mcjob. Why can't I express my feelings towards work along with everyone else when they are? Some things just drive me up the wall.   Oh well, this was just another day in my life. I think that I will now retreat to my bed and relax. Tell myself a bedtime story about what *may* happen in the future. Afterall, a girl must do what she has to to keep her head above water, n'est-ce pas?  Farewell for this evening...

      Perhaps I am bipolar, perhaps the world around me is, but my mood has done a 580Â° since last night. I've been there and back again.  Nothing was resolved, but I am ignoring things, therefore so are others. It's a nice little cycle, which just defines to me more and more the reasons for myexcitementt about moving.  So, today I opened the mailbox and found 2 items pour moi (it's actually ironic that I say that in french). The first envelop was from Philemon containing my report card (46% last term in french; hence the irony.) and the second was from Dawson-finally. That made me feel better.   THen I babysat. That was ok...but I am so over-exhausted for no particular reason. It's emotional I suppose.   But anyways, I got home and had a long chat with Ash, which was nice because it's been a long time. I guess they got over whatever they had against me last weekend. We tried to start organizing a camping trip.  Im still having mixed emotions about the Cottage. It was fun, but for some reason I can't fully get that sorted out in my mind. I just wish that I had a boyfriend.  I realize that that last statement has consumed my thoughts over the past what-5 years? It's just I suppose the reasurance that I can count on that best friend to be there for me when I need them, and that they'll come to me when they need someone. I realize that it's selfish, but wouldn't it be nice to have someone specifically special to you, and to whom you are specifically special? I guess it's just easier to say that I want a boyfriend rather than I want a best friend. It's more conventional at least.   But also, for some reason I find it much easier to talk to guys than girls. I suppose because they are more easy going, and they judge me as a girl in general as opposed to girls who think "she's so strange and most definatly NOT friend-worthy...let's not talk to her around certain people so that they don't know that I'm friends with her". This is not to say that I haven't experienced guys doing this either.   Actually, I'm going to go off onto that for a bit. So, I was finishing Generation X last night, and I can identify SO much with Claire. She talks about Tobias in a way that my thoughts are decoded and written out. The way that she knows that she has an obsession and comes to terms with the fact that she can't deny it. The way that while he can be such a jerk to her, she still longs for him. The way that she really is interested mainly for physical reasons. After 2 1/2 years of well everything good and bad, I sit her some days and still think about those summer days, "studying".   Which is I guess why I find myself in the situation that plagues me now. My thoughts are bombarded with short stories that I think up in my head, involving me and others-other specifically- to help me not think about those times, days, moments where bliss was acheived. It is much easier than trying to remind myself of the bad days, they just make me upset. It is easier to defer thoughts with the silent longing hope that one day these short stories may become true because in my world they are realistic.  My world...what world is that? Does everyone have their own world, or am I the only one with such a large misconception of day to day activity. For everyone else's sakes, I hope that they have their own worlds. The universal one is awfully boring. I would go crazy without an imagination, but is that just because I am more of a creative type?   Inspiration is the key though. You can't shut off that universal world, as much as we sometimes wish to. Everything around us, no matter how "out there' it may seem was someone inspired and influenced by the universal society that we live in.  Have you ever had a friend that was like a tv? Well, I admit it, I am friends with a TV. I mean, how am I not? Have you ever tried converse with a television? Chances are, you'd find our voice getting lost, bouncing back at you. You are bombarded with images, stories, annectdotes and the most useless infomericals...despite what you say. I was going to try to come up with an example conversation, and while I could just copy and paste an msn conversation to perfectly illustrate my point, I have decided to leave the fragments of anonymity that may still be left and end this statement like this.   I think that this is a good time to publish a disclaimer:  What I write here is not in the intent to bad talk someone, to hurt them, to downplay my relationships with anyone or whatever other feeling that could come from it. Rather, it is an outlet for what is going on inside of me so that I don't turn around and hurt others. I feel like a can of beer being shaken and shaken and shaken until it is about to explode, and this is just allowing the can to be opened a little to release some of the built up pressure. If every someone were to stumble across this and were affected, insulted or even just mentioned, then well-I'm not sorry that I said it. At the moment,this is how I feel. I'm not going to hide it. But these are feelings harbouring inside of me. Isn't it better that I release this here? Would you really rather that we release this to our mutual friends so that perhaps they develop similar feelings? or to you directly so that you can be hurt? If I have made peace with my friendships, then why bother disrupt them?  I am friends with who I am for specific reasons. Every single person that I care for as some redeeming quality that makes them special to me, and of course, there is some specific thing that really really just bugs the hell out of me about that. But that's life, right?  And next time that you ever have the urge to get mad at someone because they pointed out one of your flaws-stop and think. Have you ever said or even thought someone not so nice about them? Chances are pretty good that you have. So just shut the fuck up and stop being so goddamn hippocritical all of the time. It's not money, or religion, or language which cause so many rifts in our world, it's hipocrasy. If we'd all sit back and reflect for a second, I think that we'd all realize that this is pointless. Why bother act so stupidly all of the time. Actions have consequences, so think before you act.   Goodnight.

      Well...This is my first post. I'm not writing this in the intent to necessarily be read...But it's more so for myself. I've found myself with a lack of outlet for my creativity, thoughts and just my overall me-ness. I am not so much accepted as who I am, not that I truly know who that is. I am starting to get a much clearer view, but it's still not set. I don't even know what to think anymore? It's strange, why have I not been invited anywhere lately? Perhaps it is due to the events on Canada Day...not that I really know what those said events were. Or perhaps it's that I'm so openly eager to escape-leave this place behind. My life is finally beginning to begin though. I had never really expected to be moving out at 17. The thought of leaving my family, friends, and comfort zone in this suburbia behind-all for a big city, bursting with culture and who knows what else. One thing for sure is that it will not be the small town of 35,000 where I'll be attending a school of 600, 150 in my grade that I have known since kindergarten. Instead I'll be attending a college along with 6,000 other strangers.    This being said, I'm not upset that I'm leaving. As a matter of fact, as I mentioned it's the complete opposite. I truly am eager; anxious. I love my family and friends to death-most of the time. When things are good, they're great...unfortunatly, there's the flipside to be taken into account. When things get rough, it's unbearable. Pettiness always seeps through into the relationships like an overbearing gas, suffocating us all. We go about blindly, not analyzing consequences.   Honestly, as terrible as it is, I just wish that I had a relationship-one that could be BOTH physical and emotional. Why does it always seem to be one or the other? To be fair though, this is largely my fault. Why do I always target guys that I could see possibly taking interest in me and try to be myself-well the part of myself that I find to be socially acceptable, pull them in, and then lose interest. Twice this year I have done this, and both times were terrible. Both saw me at my very worst moments, and still stuck around until I just ignored them for long enough. Why am I always so terrible like that. One helped me see through a messy "breakup" of sorts, and the other through a miserable, sickening bus ride. Even after my attempts to show how I was too busy for a relationship afterwards, they stuck around. I always just dismiss the genuine guys. And here I am, sitting at my computer at 10:54 on a warm, summer Wednesday evening, lusting after this guy. This guy that I know, but don't really know. We've talked, hung out-always using school as an excuse, but he's never really shown any particular interest in me. Afterall, he does like someone else. Oh well, Prom was enough for me...or so I thought. It just really left me wanting more. Although, truthfully it has given me a little strength to not fall back into the oh so familiar rut that plagued 2 1/2 years of my life. That is most definitely NOT somewhere that I'd like to end up at again. So here I am, talking for the most part about my messy "love" history. Really, I suppose I should really re-evaluate when I say that I have no experience in this field. But how can I now deferenciate facts from fiction...what really happened, and what memories are fabricated? I suppose that this whole blog will just become one jumbled fiction and non-fiction, distorted photograph of my life.  Photography. Why can I not keep it up? I really wish that I had pursued it...it's the one thing that I have been most passionate about in my entire life. I suppose film follows down that trail, but its not black and white stills. If only I could afford to keep it up, but truthfully at this point, I am just hoping that I can afford to feed myself from month to month.  And at this rate, that will be an expensive task. Why is it that food is beginning to control my life. To ease my concerns, I tell myself that it doesn't look like I'm gaining weight, and if I drink more water, it will just flush out the excess fat. It's not. I'm just now drinking water compulsively. When I don't have a glass in my hand, my mouth goes dry and I start to think about all of the dirty, jiggle fat sticking to my insides and I can't focus on anything but getting another big glass to flush it all out. Why can't water just flush all of the bad out?! Why is it not working? How long will it take until I can commit myself to a regime that works? At this rate, I am stuck in this perpetual spiral of hopelessness.   Well, I must go and refill my glass of water, as I'm beginning to become uncertain once again whether it's half empty or half full-lusting after that which I'll never have...   Adieu.
