      So.  Here we are.  Here I am.    I got a 98 on the  very last AP Euro test of all time .  That was pretty much the only good thing that happened all day.    Pretty much.   urlLink

      there is, unavoidably, something to be said about my last name.  my entire name, in fact.  sure, there are lots of indian kids with insane ethnic names in american public schools but, honestly, that's excusable and will probably work to their advantage in life anyway (colleges love blatant ethnicity).  but my name; jacqueline chiquoine, is almost like my mother was trying to be mean, taking out her hostility towards her own mother (named Jeanne) for naming her Jeanne.  She too needed a reason for her young daughter to hate her when she came home from every first day of school, during which i met at least half a dozen teachers who never learned french.  each one would fumble through the first syllable: "chick...I'm sorry, how do you pronounce that?"   "shi-coin.  like an 'S'" "oh, that's right.  chick-oin.  lovely!  so french!" at which point i would give up, and feel old Zepherine (great great grand something or other) and Madeline (very early ancestor, who was probably one of the only ones who actually came from France) rolling in their graves.  had they suffered the same problems from ignorant english-speaking fools?   besides my mother's supposed francophilia (or post-natal insanity?) another thing I always held against her was the length.  jacqueline has ten letters, chiquoine nine, so you would think she'd pick something like ann or Lois as my middle name - or, hell, forget it all together.  but no, its the reliable, ever-popular Elizabeth.  not french - too bad - but nine letters.  Twenty-eight letter names are not easy for budding five-year-old readers to spell and memorize.  yet, somewhat miraculously, i learned how to do it, because every book i could get my hands on had JACQUELINE written in huge, scribbly, occasionally backwards lefty scrawl on the first page.

      yeah, i know its early.  but there are so many things to do that i look for more reasons to procrastinate.  a person who has influenced me.  or  a goal which i have set and achieved.  well, since i don't make goals and certainly don't achieve much besides living to see another day of boring suburban hell, the last one is out.  the first one is a possibility (one of them has to be, anyway) though i don't think, as good as i am at bullshitting, that i could write something convincing about either of my parents (groan) or my disabled mentor or my black female teacher because none of these people exist.  pardon me for not being a walking white girl cliche.  since the college is in new york city, i'm going to give these admissions essay readers the benefit of the doubt and trust they wouldn't think i was on drugs if i wrote about lou reed or just generally strange for writing about a person i do not personally know and will probably never meet.    since there are always empty spots and my record is good, i'm probably in anyway.  ah!  make this year end quickly.

      there's this part of my personality that has always frightened me when considering the future; i'm obsessively devoted, yet terribly flighty.  one minute my life is completely

      seriously guys, unless you currently are or have in the past, avoid working retail at all costs.  or else your views of the american consumer will be forever tainted by such delights as  facing, shoplifting,  and fat old people who pull  scams  on you by telling you they have cancer and then stealing film from god knows where, using their sob story to get you to return it without a receipt and give them cash.  people pull scams on eckerd all the time.  its really not that hard, i guess, considering five people work in my store.  (teenagers suck too, by the way.)  just today i had some fat, middle-aged man with thinning red hair and child molester glasses (like those coke bottle ones from  i know my first name is steven , the greatest four hour lifetime movie of all time) buy a giant box of condoms and a bottle of lube.  supressing my shudder was almost as hard as trying not to gasp when that fingerless old man waves to me.  the only interesting people i've met so far are these british triplets that always come in and make penis jokes to each other that are only half-intelligble to me because i'm an accent-ignorant american teenager.  they're always really gross looking, and collectively smell like a melting driveway.  but they call me  "love", so that's fun.  there is, however, one gift working at the drug store with a bunch of middle aged ladies and a college drop-out has bestowed upon me.  and that is the burning desire to go to college and never spending any more time than i have to working retail with a bunch of losers.  get out while you still have time.  good night, loves.  tomorrow is mother's birthday, and i should get up early and make her food or something because  she's depressed; either about turning forty-three or not being able to pay her car insurance or both.

      look at that, a comment.  unexpected, but very nice.  i never thought people would be reading this shit, its just stream of conciousness crap to go along with a xanga and a live journal and my ever-depleting young brain cells.  hoorah.   truth is, i'd write a lot more if i actually had something to say.  i'm one of those unlucky nerds with no friends who, instead of making up lame fantasy stories about dragons or writing fan fiction, just writes about being an unlucky nerd without friends (or creativity).  and, honestly, who wants to read that?  eventually i will be interesting and live in new york city and have friends.    by the by,  the philosophy of andy warhol  is a good book.  they should teach it in schools.
