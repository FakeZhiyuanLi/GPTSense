      It's weird to have "Leaf" as the title of this entry.  I felt like all my life I've been a leaf, the greenish thing that is around the flowers.  Flowers are beautiful.  They are the ones that people like to look at.  They are always on the spot light.  They are always special in different ways.  Leaves are not noticable.  They are either green or brown.  They can be in different shade of green and brown, but that does not make a difference to a lot of people.  People always say that if there is no leaf, the flowers would not be as beautiful as they are.  That's because leaves are so plain, plain things would make pretty things even better and noticable.  I believe I'm a leaf.  I'm always around people, the ones that shines.  People like me are necessary to make others better.  All my life I tried to work my way up to become a flower, but now I'm tired.  Tired of changing myself, I know that no matter how hard I try, I can never become someone else or even change my appearance.  When I see others being happy, I would want to join them and see if I can receive the happiness they had.  However, it does not always work that way.  And mostly it always end up the other way around.  A leaf can never become a flower.  This is a statement in which would always be true.  All my life, I've never been under the spot light.  No matter how hard I tried, no one seem to notice me because I'm like many others.  I blend in, that's why I'm not outstanding.  Because I'm a leaf, I appreicates the friends that I have around me.  They are wonderful and unique.  However, being around them makes me realize more about how plain I am as a person.  I'm never a very significant person to anyone in their life.  This is the story of my life as a leaf.

      Crying often starts with sad feelings.  My heart starts to feel the pain.  Starts to have difficulty breathing.  My nose starts to feel werid and I know it starts to turn red.  Tears comming up in my eyes.  As more tears gathers, it flows out my eyes and goes down my cheeks.  Then some drops down on my clothes or on the floor.  Trying so hard to breath and stop myself but the tears are still comming.  It's hard to stop yourself from crying.

      I haven't really explain what Final Fantasy means to me.  As most people know Final Fantasy is a very popular video game.  I love the characters in Final Fantasy XII.  It also has a second meaning to me.  My final fantasy, the fantasy that I know that would never come true.  After all it is just a fantasy.  I don't know if everyone in this world has his or her own fantasy.  My fantasy is to live in a peaceful place where there is no discrimination, jealousy, hate, dipute, and broken heart.  This is pretty impossible in the world today.  I guess I have this kind of fantasy as my FINAL fantasy because I'm so afraid to get my feelings hurt and my heart broken.  I'm tired of all of the things that I mentioned above.  I want to live in a place where everything that is being done is for a good purpose and for love.  I'm kind of foolish and maybe a little slow.  I had done wrong things that I regreted from doing so.  I don't want that to be in my fantasy.  My fantasy has to be pure and clean...

      What makes a person hate his/herself?  I dont know the answer to that question if others ask me about themselves.  But I do know the answer to that question about myself.  If I ask myself, what is good about myself.  I really dont know what to say.  If I ask myself what do I dislike about myself, then there would be a long list in which would just take 10 minutes to finish because I kind of know what is wrong with me.  All the things that I dislike about myself adds up and become hate.  I hate myself for being a stupid idiot.  I hate myself for many reasons that I cant even list them out in public.  I dont deserve anything.  Nothing at all.  Maybe people would think that Im very negative, but I'm just telling the truth.  So one day if you discover something you dislike about yourself, dont be like me.  Try to fix it and start liking it.

      I hate myself for many reasons, but today I hate myself because I was in a position that I never wanted to be.  I never wanted to be hurt, but i did.  I never wanted to hurt others and I also did.  Never before did I hated my mouth.  I felt like I have a big ass mouth that just hurts others feelings.  I feel so guilty.  I never meant to make him sad, I never meant to hurt him.  Why I had to say the things I said before.  I'm such a idiot.  I can't stand myselft.  I hate myself.  There is nothing good about me.  Just hate myself for doing that.  Hate, such a strong word...

      This is a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley.  I like it so i'm posting it.  hope anyone reading it would like it too.  Music, when soft voices die, Vibrates in the memory- Odours, when sweet violets sicken, Live within the sense they quicken.  Rose leaves, when the rose is dead, Are heapd for the beloved's bed, And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone, Love itself shall slumber on.

      Just after reading one of my friend's writing, I am so afraid that I was the one that got her into such pain that she is in now.  I felt guilt running in my blood along with the pain that I'm experiencing now.  I know you can never say that you felt the same as others because you are not them.  I began to realize that I'm so childish and selfish that I'm actually putting my friends in pain.  I'm in great fear of getting hurt.  It makes me sometimes don't want to face certain people because just by being with them gives me that fear of feeling the same pain that I had just not long ago.  Maybe people would wonder what kind of pain it is, well, all I can say is the kind of pain that you receive from carelessness from someone that you care a lot about.  I try very hard not to have a confusion between my friends, so before I do anything, I actually ask very specific details.  And those details disappointed me so much.  Many times, it's not about getting me to be involve in something that they do, but more of telling me what they are going to do in advance because not everything they can do, I can do too.  And is it that everytime, that your friend has something to do, you have to ask them if you can get involve once you find out?  Like I said, what if you find out late, then you don't get to do the thing that you want to do.  I'm so different, I like to tell them and ask them if they want to do it or not.  However, just realizing that they are doing the things that I can do and they were doing it without me, and even more find out about it from other people's mouths afterwards and not them...  It's so painful just to think about it.  The feelings turn from extreme anger into deep pain.  I don't get how you can be so close to someone and not want them to be involve with things that you do.  Maybe I'm just so different because I like to get my friends to be involve with things I do and thinking that they would enjoy as much as I do.  I love to tell my friends things and hearing things from them as a return.  I hate when I was the last one to find out about something about my good friends from others.  I hate when I'm the one left behind.  I began to question for my need of existence upon them.  Maybe I should just disappear forever and leave them alone.  Like my other friend said, take a break, but I'm afraid this break would take forever.  Separating from your good friends is very painful, it's like tearing a part of you away.  However, just because I'm afraid of feeling that pain, doesn't mean that I shouldn't do it.  It's for my own good and for others.  I think I should really do that.    I don't know if others are feeling the same way as I am right now.  I think that friendship is so addictive.  I'm so depending on it, that I expect to see my friends everyday.  They are the first people that pop into my mind everytime I thought of something to do, no matter it's a boring thing or something fun that I want them to enjoy with me.  But sometimes realizing that I'm not the one that they care and notify about when there's an activity, it hurts me a lot.  When I thought I suppose to be the one that knows things before others because that we are such close friends, hearing things from others but not them hurts me a lot.  I guess friendship can be really selfish sometimes, at least for me.  Maybe I really don't understand the concept of careless.  If only I know how to let go maybe my friendship would be a little easier for all of us.     This entry is not a complain to anyone.  And I hope if anyone reads it would not cause any pain or misunderstandings.  I wish the best of lucks to all of my friends.  I love you all.

      Friendship can be confusing sometimes because it is divided into different levels. These levels even intercept themselves and make it even more confusing. This is one big problem for me. When you thought that you are very close friends but end up the different way. You are just the inbetween. Dont you hate the feeling of unclearness? The level of friendship is not base on time. I know for sure that time does not play a big part in this. Maybe it helps but it is not the essential element in this type of relationship. I use to believe that the longer you know someone, the closer you will grow to them and actually know them better. However, I have to admit that I'm very wrong. Some times, you can just know someone for a short period of time and will be very close to that person because you felt the bond within. That person gives you trust and love. He/she actually understands you as a person and your perspective towards other things. Wherelse, the other one is the total opposite. You can know them for a long time, but you end up not really "knowing" them and vise versa. This can be very disappointing...

      Live is full of confusion.  If everything in life can be clearly place on the table where everyone knows about the true, then there wont be any confusions.  If everyone would have the same understanding towards things, then there wont be any confusions.  Confusion causes many problems.  People tend to get their feelings hurt from that.  That's why people like others to be honest to them.  However, if you ask for something then others would ask for the something return.  I don't think confusion is something that anyone can avoid unless they tell the truth and nothing but the true.  Others can also take it in differently, then that's another type of confusion.  And I have to say, I hate confusions!

      I dont know what love really is now.&nbsp; i dont know if i really love someone or not 'cause when he is with someone else, i dont get jealous.&nbsp; when you love someone shouldnt you be jealous when they are with someone else?&nbsp; i thought i liked him and i thought i wanted to be with him, but i didnt.&nbsp; maybe i was afraid, afraid to be with anyone.&nbsp; i dont want them to dislike me or hate me.&nbsp; i dont think i deserve to be with anyone 'cause i think im going to hurt them with my low self-estem.&nbsp; im afraid to meet his friends 'cause i think his friends are not going to like me and maybe look down&nbsp;at me.&nbsp; i dont ever want something like that to happen to me.&nbsp; i dont want to hear such conversation regarding me that goes like this: his friend:"that's your girl?" he:"yeah." his friend:"what is wrong with you, her!?" he:"yeah i know, dont ask.&nbsp; i dont know what was wrong with me." his friend:"i was about to say.&nbsp; you can do better than that."  so i guess i will be better of without a relationship.

      whenever it rains, it always makes me sad.&nbsp; people always refer to the rain as tears from the sky.&nbsp; it is crying for all the sad things that was happening on this world.&nbsp; but scientifically, it is just a type of weather.&nbsp; the rain makes me tear.&nbsp; it puts&nbsp;my heart in pain.&nbsp; it reminds me of all the&nbsp;sad and bad memories i had in the past.&nbsp; the kind of memories i&nbsp;would never want to remember.&nbsp; when the rain drops on&nbsp;me, it is&nbsp;adding weight to my&nbsp;body, to my mind, and to my heart.&nbsp; i hate rainy days.&nbsp; hate them so much.&nbsp;
