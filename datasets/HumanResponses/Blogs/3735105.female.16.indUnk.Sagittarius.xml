      went out with triana tonight. saw anchorman. it was funny.  ooh i saw armando and we talked for awhile.  i missed him soooo fucking much. we're gonna start hanging out again. yayayayyayayyay.  and i saw maria at the mall yesterday. she got our numbers. hehe. i hope i can go out with her soon too.   now i just need to see omar and reta and i'll be suuuper happy :D  me and triana are gonna start practicing tennis soon.. yaaaay.  that should be lots of fun. and i really need the practice too.   and now for the wonderful realization i came to today: guys are assholes. every single one of them. there are no exceptions.. maybe a few. but those are hard to come by.   and that my friends is why i am going to lay off all of my guy friends.. which sucks for me because almost all of my friends are guys.. and im going to just forget everything and start new.   but i must see dan... and armando. dan is just too cute of a cat and i miss armando way too much.   i guess thats all for now. take care kiddos.

      forget his name, forget his face..&nbsp; forget his kiss, his warm embrace.. &nbsp;forget the love that you once knew, remember he has someone new..&nbsp; forget him when they play your song, forget you cried the whole night long..&nbsp; forget how close you two once were, remember he has chosen her.. forget you memorized his walk, forget the way you used to talk..&nbsp; forget the things he used to say, remember now he's gone away.. &nbsp;forget his laugh, forget his grin.. forget the dimple in his chin..&nbsp; forget the way he held you tight, remember he's with her tonight..&nbsp; forget the time that went so fast, forget the love that now is past..&nbsp; forget he said he'd leave you never, remember now he's gone forever.   *sigh*

      heh. that makes me laugh.. lately, i've been having really weird dreams. i had a lucid dream last night that didnt turn out too well. im not even sure if it was a lucid dream or not because every time i demanded something to appear, it didn't. and i got mad... which then led to just a regular dream. man, that sucked. and then sometimes when i'm dreaming i think that it's real life. and then i wake up, and i think i'm still dreaming. god, its been happening all week and it's freaking me out. for all i know all this happening right now could be a dream in itself. dan says i shouldn't worry. it's not so much that i'm worried, i'm just curious as to why things like that happen. i think i'm gonna start reading up on it because i'm a curious little cat. heh.   i had super bad cramps today.. so i'm gonna tell you what i did to make myself feel better. i took an hour long bubble bath. and it felt soooooooooo good :D and then i layed down on my bed for about half an hour and drank some hot chocolate. ooooh it was great. lol alrights well i'm talking to dan, so good nites.   p.s. i don't like it when anonymous people comment on my bloggy therefore i have disabled that option. :)
