       Encircled in purple stratospheric haze, Saturn's largest moon, Titan, appears as a softly glowing sphere in this colorized image taken on July 3, 2004, one day after Cassini's first flyby of that moon. Titan has a dense atmosphere composed primarily of nitrogen with a few percent methane. The atmosphere can undergo photochemical processes to form hazesImages like this one reveal some of the key steps in the formation and evolution of Titan's haze. The process is thought to begin in the high atmosphere, at altitudes above 400 kilometers (250 miles), where ultraviolet light breaks down methane and nitrogen molecules. The products are believed to react to form more complex organic molecules containing carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen that can combine to form the very small particles seen as haze.This ultraviolet view of Titan has been falsely colored. The main body is colored pale orange as seen in true color images. Above the orange disc are two distinct layers of atmospheric haze that have been brightened and falsely colored violet to enhance their visibility. It is not currently understood why there are two separate haze layers. This and other questions await answers as the four-year Cassini tour continues, with many more planned flybys of Titan. The upcoming October 2004 flyby of Titan will be 30 times closer than that of July 2.The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.

       As winter approaches on Mars, NASA's Opportunity rover continues to inch deeper into the stadium-sized crater dubbed "Endurance." On the other side of the planet, the Spirit rover found an intriguing patch of rock outcrop while preparing to climb up the "Columbia Hills" backward. This unusual approach to driving is part of a creative plan to accommodate Spirit's aging front wheel.Spirit, with an odometer reading of over 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles), has already traveled six times its designed capacity. Its right front wheel has been experiencing increased internal resistance, and recent efforts to mitigate the problem by redistributing the wheel's lubricant through rest and heating have been only partially successful. To cope with the condition, rover planners have devised a roundabout strategy. They will drive the rover backward on five wheels, rotating the sixth wheel only sparingly to ensure its availability for demanding terrain. "Driving may take us a little bit longer because it is like dragging an anchor," said Joe Melko, a rover engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. "However, this approach will allow us to continue doing science much longer than we ever thought possible." On Thursday, July 15, Spirit successfully drove 8 meters (26 feet) north along the base of the Columbia Hills backward, dragging its faulty wheel. The wheel was activated about 10 percent of the time to surmount obstacles and to pull the rover out of trenches dug by the immobile wheel. Along the way, Spirit drove over what scientists had been hoping to find in the hills -- a slab of rock outcrop that may represent some of the oldest rocks observed in the mission so far. Spirit will continue to drive north, where it likely will encounter more outcrop. Ultimately, the rover will drive east and hike up the hills backward using all six wheels. "A few months ago, we weren't sure if we'd make it to the hills, and now here we are preparing to drive up into them," said Dr. Matt Golombek, a rover science-team member from JPL. "It's very exciting."For the past month, the Spirit rover has been parked near several hematite-containing rocks, including "Pot of Gold," conducting science studies and undergoing a long-distance "tuneup" for its right front wheel. Driving with the wheel disabled means that corrections might have to be made to the rover's steering if it veers off its planned path. This limits Spirit's accuracy, but rover planners working at JPL's rover test facility have come up with some creative commands that allow the rover to auto-correct itself to a limited degree. As Spirit prepares to climb upward, Opportunity is rolling downward. Probing increasingly deep layers of bedrock lining the walls of Endurance Crater at Meridiani Planum, the rover has observed a puzzling increase in the amount of chlorine. Data from Opportunity's alpha particle X-ray spectrometer show that chlorine is the only element that dramatically rises with deepening layers, leaving scientists to wonder how it got there. "We do not know yet which element is bound to the chlorine," said Dr. Jutta Zipfel, a rover science-team member from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, Germany. Opportunity will roll down even farther into the crater in the next few days to see if this trend continues. It also will investigate a row of sharp, teeth-like features dubbed "Razorback," which may have formed when fluid flowed through cracks, depositing hard minerals. Scientists hope the new data will help put together the pieces of Meridiani's mysterious and watery past. "Razorback may tell us more about the history of water at Endurance Crater," said Dr. Jack Farmer, a rover science-team member from Arizona State University, Tempe. Rover planners are also preparing for the coming Martian winter, which peaks in mid-September. Dwindling daily sunshine means the rovers will have less solar power and take longer to recharge. Periods of rest and "deep sleep" will allow the rovers to keep working through the winter at lower activity levels. Orienting the rovers' solar panels toward the north will also elevate power supplies. "The rovers might work a little bit more every day, or a little bit more every other day. We will see how things go and remain flexible," said Jim Erickson, project manager for the Mars Exploration Rover mission at JPL.

        A rock outcrop with a view of the surrounding landscape beckons NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit on sol 203 (July 29, 2004) of its journey of exploration on the red planet. This view is a mosaic of images taken by the rover's navigation camera at a position labeled as Site 80, near the top of the "West Spur" portion of the "Columbia Hills." Directly ahead are rock outcrops that scientists will examine for clues that might indicate the presence of water in the past. In the upper right-hand corner is the so-called "sea of basalt," consisting of lava flows that lapped onto the flanks of the hills. The view is toward the south. The field of view is approximately 170 degrees from right to left and is presented in a cylindrical projection with geometrical seam correction.  urlLink click here to see the picture

       One of the pleasures of stargazing is noticing and enjoying the various colors that stars display in dark skies. These hues offer direct visual evidence of how stellar temperatures vary. A good many of the summer luminaries – such as brilliant Vega which stands nearly overhead during the late-evening hours – are bluish-white, but we can easily find other, contrasting colors there as well. Look at reddish Antares, and the yellowish-white Altair. And considerably removed from this summer retinue, brilliant topaz Arcturus holds forth in solitary splendor in the western sky. Double color Probably the most colorful double star in the night sky can now be found nearly overhead at 11:30 p.m. local daylight time: Albireo in the constellation of Cygnus, the Swan, also known as the Northern Cross. Albireo supposedly marks the swan’s beak. A small telescope or even a pair of steadily held binoculars, will readily split Albireo into two tiny points of light of beautiful contrasting colors: the brighter one a rich yellowish-orange, the other a deep azure blue, both placed very close together. An absolutely stunning view will come with a telescope magnifying between 18 and 30 power. If I’m with a group of people with my telescope under the summer sky, I always make it a point to look at Albireo, commenting that it’s the star that commemorates the New York Mets, because of that ball team’s colors of orange and blue. Many people insist stars are just plain white. Certainly, star colors are not easy to see, chiefly because our eyes’ color sensors – the cones of the retina – are quite insensitive to dim light. At night, the rods take over, but they are effectively color-blind. Only the brightest stars can excite the cones, unless binoculars or a telescope is used to intensify a star’s light. Color perception is aided further by the close juxtaposition of a contrasty pair of stars as in Albireo. Bound or not? Albireo is believed by astronomers to be a physical pair bound by gravity, although there has never been evidence of any orbital motion between these two colorful stars. The projected separation between the two is just over 400 billion miles. At least 55 solar systems could be lined-up edge-to-edge, across the space that separates the components of this famous double star. At least that's how it appears. It is possible that one star is much farther away than the other, and that they're not actually orbiting one another. By the way, there is an interesting rule about the colors of telescopic double stars. If the stars of the pair are equally bright, they have the same color. If they are unequal in brightness, they have different colors. If the brighter star is the redder of the two, as in the case of Albireo, it must be a giant star; if it is the bluer, then it is what astronomers call a main sequence star, like our Sun.

         Black holes suffer a bad rap. Indicted by the press as gravity monsters, labeled highly secretive by astronomers, and long considered in theoretical circles as mere endpoints of cosmic evolution, these unseen objects are depicted as mysterious drains of destruction and death.So it may seem odd to reconsider them as indispensable forces of creation.Yet this is the bright new picture of black holes and their role in the evolution of the universe. Interviews with more than a half dozen experts presently involved in rewriting the slippery history of these elusive objects reveals black holes as galactic sculptors.In this revised view, which still contains some highly debated facts, fuzzy paragraphs and sketchy initial chapters, black holes are shown to be fundamental forces in the development and ultimate shapes of galaxies and the distribution of stars in them. The new history also shows that a black hole is almost surely a product of the galaxy in which it resides. Neither, it seems, does much without the other. The emerging theory has a nifty, Darwinist buzzword: co-evolution.As a thought exercise, co-evolution has been around for less than a decade, or as much as 30 years, depending on who you ask. Many theorists never took it seriously, and no one had much evidence to support it. Only in the past six years or so has it gained steam. And only during the past three years have observations provided rock-solid support and turned co-evolution into the mainstream idea among the cognoscenti in both black hole development and galaxy formation."The emerging picture of co-evolving black holes and galaxies has turned our view of black holes on its head," says Meg Urry, an astronomer and professor of physics at Yale University. "Previously, black holes were seen as the endpoints of evolution, the final resting state of most or all of the matter in the universe. Now we believe black holes also play a critical role in the birth of galaxies."The idea is particularly pertinent to explaining how massive galaxies developed in the first billion years of the universe. And it is so new that just last week theorists got what may be the first direct evidence that galaxies actually did form around the earliest black holes.Chicken-and-egg questionLike archeologists, astronomers spend most of their careers looking back. They like to gather photons that have been traveling across time and space since well before Earth was born, some 4.5 billion years ago. Rogier Windhorst, an Arizona State University astronomer, has peered just about as deep into the past as anyone, to an era when the universe was roughly 5 percent of its present age.Earlier this month, Windhorst and a colleague, Haojing Yan, released a Hubble Space Telescope image showing the most distant "normal" galaxies ever observed. Though stretched and distorted by the technique used to spot them (an intervening galaxy cluster was used as a "gravitational lens"), the newfound galaxies, Windhorst's team assures us, resemble our own Milky Way. They are seen as they existed more than 13 billion years ago, within 1 billion years of the Big Bang.Practically side-by-side in time, discovered in separate observations made as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, are compact but bright objects known as quasars. These galaxies-to-be shine brilliantly because, researchers believe, each has a gargantuan black hole at its core, whose mass is equal to a billion suns or more, all packed into a region perhaps smaller than our solar system. The resulting gravity pulls in nearby gas. The material is accelerated to nearly the speed of light, superheated, and swallowed. The process is not entirely efficient, and there is a byproduct: An enormous amount of energy -- radio waves, X-rays and regular light -- hyper-illuminates the whole scene. Quasars also seem to be surrounded by halos of dark matter, a cryptic and unseen component of all galaxies. Co-existing around and amongst all this, researchers are coming to realize, is a collapsing region of stars and gas as big or larger than our galaxy.It was no coincidence that the announcements of the two findings -- distant quasars and normal galaxies --were made together at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) Jan. 9. Co-evolution was on the minds of the discoverers.Among co-evolution's significant impacts is its ability to render mostly moot a longstanding chicken-and-egg question in astronomy: Which came first, the galaxy or the black hole?"How about both?" Windhorst asks. "You could actually have the galaxy form simultaneously around a growing black hole."Urry, who was not involved in either finding but was asked to analyze them, explained it this way: "We believe that galaxies and quasars are very intimately connected, that in fact quasars are a phase of galaxy evolution. In our current picture, as every galaxy forms and collapses, it has a brief quasar phase." So when a quasar goes dormant, what's left are the things we associate with a normal galaxy -- stars and gas swirling around a central and hidden pit of matter. Quasars are cagey characters, however. (The term is short for quasi-stellar radio source; astronomers first mistook the objects for stars within our galaxy in the early 1960s.) When one is firing, its brightness can exceed a thousand normal galaxies. The quasar outshines its entire host galaxy so significantly that scientists have not been able to see what's really causing all the commotion. That veil is lifting as you read this, however, as telescopic vision extends ever backward in time and data is fed into powerful new computer models.Evolving ideaDemonstrations of co-evolution began to emerge in the mid-1990s when researchers found hints that the existence of a significant black hole at the center of a galaxy was related to the galaxy's shape, says Martin Haehnelt of the University of Cambridge. Only galaxies with a spherical bulge-like component appear to accommodate supermassive black holes. Our Milky Way, if it could be viewed edge on, would display a good example of one of these galactic bulges: Imagine the profile of a stereotypical flying saucer, though with a wider and flatter disk. The Milky Way is smaller than many galaxies, however, and it has a correspondingly less massive black hole -- roughly 2.6 million suns worth. It almost surely once had a quasar phase, astronomers say.At any rate, in the mid-1990s no one knew for sure how prevalent black holes were. Theory and some observational data pointed to the likelihood that they were ubiquitous.Then, in the year 2000, astronomers found solid evidence that black holes lurk deep inside many and probably all galaxies that have the classic central bulge of stars. Further, an analysis showed a direct correlation between the mass in each black hole and the shape and scope of the bulge and the overall size of the galaxy. At an AAS meeting in June of 2000, John Kormendy of the University of Texas at Austin, presented evidence for 10 mammoth black holes whose masses were related to their galactic bulges. Kormendy worked on a large team of researchers led by University of Michigan astronomer Douglas Richstone. This along with other studies in surrounding months by other teams served as a collective turning point for co-evolution, several researchers now say, advancing it to a stable quantitative footing."Subsequently the idea of the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes became more widely discussed and accepted," Haehnelt says. Evidence continues to mount. In 2001, two separate teams showed that many smaller galaxies that don't have bulges also do not seem to contain significant black holes.Over the past six months or so, other important studies have emerged, providing independent confirmation to some of the initial work. Haehnelt: "It becomes more and more clear that supermassive black holes can significantly change the structure and evolution of galaxies."The first large-scale scientific meeting devoted to co-evolution -- a sure sign of a theory coming into its own -- was held just three months ago, sponsored by the prestigious Carnegie Observatories.There are many variations on the basic theory of co-evolution. Each version attempts to explain a vexing fact: In the blink of a cosmic eye -- just a half a billion years -- invisible spheres of matter were born, and several gained the mass of a billion or more suns and were driving the shape and texture of swirling agglomerations of newborn stars.Co-evolution is not a done deal. Perhaps, some have suggested, a huge black hole simply collapses out of a pre-galactic cloud and serves as a ready-made engine to drive further galaxy development. Even staunch supporters of co-evolution say there are still viable theories, not yet refutable, putting the immense black hole in place first, and others that have the galaxy solely responsible for driving the formation of a black hole. If black holes did grow incrementally, it is unclear whether cooperative construction reigned from the beginning, or if it kicked in after some certain amount of mass was gathered. "I think it is still unclear whether black holes play any role in the formation of the first galaxies," said Cambridge's Sir Martin Rees, who has collaborated with Haehnelt and who long ago authored some of the first scientific papers on the question. "Indeed," Sir Martin says, "there is a lot of debate about whether black holes can form in very small galaxies, and whether there is a link between the 'small' holes that form as the endpoint of the evolution of massive stars and the holes of above a million solar masses that exist in the centers of galaxies."Another dark matterInfusing itself into the equation is an utter unknown: dark matter. This as-yet-undetected stuff permeates all galaxies, researchers believe. A halo of it surrounds our Milky Way. Dark matter does not interact with light, but it does possess great gravitational prowess, acting as invisible glue to help hold galaxies together.Dark matter is taken into account in the leading co-evolution models, but only in a general, overall sense. Some researchers, however, think dark matter, more than a black hole, is clearly connected to a galaxy's birth and development.Just last week, the first possible direct evidence was announced for dark matter halos around early quasars. The finding, by Rennan Barkana of Tel Aviv University and Harvard astronomer Abraham Loeb, appears to be the first glimpse at the anatomy of the most distant quasars. Importantly, it supports the fundamental ideas of co-evolution, Loeb said. But it also makes it clear that dark matter will not be denied a chapter in any book about the theory. Laura Ferrarese, a Rutgers University physicist, analyzed the new dark matter finding. She says it shows that a supermassive black hole, the stars around it, and an all-encompassing dark matter halo are working in concert to build structure. Taken with other evidence, Ferrarese sees dark matter's role as more significant, or at least more obvious, than many theorists have considered."There is an observational correlation between the mass of the black hole and the mass of the dark matter halo, not necessarily the mass of the galaxy itself," she said.Through this haze of fuzzy information and diverse thinking, theorists must work to explain a stark and staggering fact: Somewhere between 300 million and 800 million years after the Big Bang, the first black holes were born and managed to each gulp down a mass of more than 1 billion suns.Now before you ponder how these Sumo wrestlers of the early universe must have thrown their weight around in any evolutionary wrestling match, consider this: A black hole typically holds much less than 1 percent of the overall mass of the galaxy it anchors.Shining light on the dark agesThe early history of black holes -- what went on in the 500 million years leading up to objects observable with current technology -- is tied back to the development of the very first stars. Speculating about it requires first rewinding to the very beginning.When the universe was born, there was nothing but hydrogen, helium and a little lithium. All this raced outward for about 300,000 years before anything significant happened. The gas was too compacted and therefore too hot to be stable. Gradually, the stuff of space expanded and cooled enough for gas to "recombine and stabilize to neutral states," as scientists put it.The hydrogen was still too hot to form stars, so more expansion was needed. A long stretch of boring darkness ensued, during which some ripples began to ruffle the otherwise smooth fabric of space."For 300 million years, nothing happened," explains Windhorst, the Arizona State University astronomer. "The universe is just sitting there. Then all of a sudden the first stars began to shine."The exact timing for first light is not known. But the ensuing 500 million years are the so-called dark ages of cosmology. Or more precisely, they represent the illuminations of the universe and the elimination of the dark ages."The tail end of that is what we're seeing," Windhorst says of the latest Hubble and Sloan survey observations. The first black holesScientists once imagined galaxies forming by a sort of monolithic collapse, in which a giant cloud of gas suddenly fell inward. The modern view is one of "hierarchical merging," in which bits and pieces build up over time. A rough outline of how it all went down is fairly well agreed upon. The initial ripples in space drew together into knots and filaments, locally and over broader scales. Individual clumps of gas collapsed, and stars were born.The first stars must have been massive, perhaps 200 times the weight of our Sun or more. They would have been almost pure hydrogen -- the primary ingredient of thermonuclear fusion, which makes a star shine. Massive stars are known to die young. Some survive just 10 million years (the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and just reaching middle-age). A colossal explosion occurs, sending newly forged, heavier elements into space. Remaining material collapses. A mass equal to many stars might end up in a ball no larger than a city. The result: a stellar black hole. These object are so dense that nothing, not even light, escapes once inside a sphere of influence known as an event horizon.Stellar gravity wells can weigh as little as a few suns. But the inaugural versions might have been 100 times as massive as the Sun or more.During all these tens and hundreds of millions of years, more stars are being born from the detritus of the first stars. Locally denser regions of gas contract. Stars form groups of perhaps a few dozen, which might be attracted to other star clusters. Eventually, clusters of many thousands of stars develop and began to look and behave like something that could be called a sub-galaxy. Some probably harbored growing black holes near their centers.Here, theory struggles. Intuition might suggest that many of these huge stellar black holes simply merged until one central object attained enough mass to drive the shape and future development of its galaxy.If that intuition is right, however, which black hole became the center?"It may be a question of being in the right place at the right time," says Roger Blandford, a theoretical astrophysicist at Caltech. "It could be accidental."In fact, nobody knows for sure if the first super-sized black holes developed from a series of mergers -- several dozen solar masses becomes 200, then 1,000, then 10,000, and so on -- or if they collapsed from the condensing gas cloud. "Do they start from 100 solar masses or a million solar masses? That's a good question," Blandford said. "My personal guess is that they start from a few hundred solar masses, but that's a much more speculative business."In fact, nobody knows for sure if the first super-sized black holes developed from a series of mergers -- several dozen solar masses becomes 200, then 1,000, then 10,000, and so on -- or if they collapsed from the condensing gas cloud. "Do they start from 100 solar masses or a million solar masses? That's a good question," Blandford said. "My personal guess is that they start from a few hundred solar masses, but that's a much more speculative business."Researchers on both sides of the middleweight argument mostly agree that the bulk of a jumbo black hole doesn't come through early mergers. Once a critical mass is achieved -- and this appears to coincide with a point in time prior to what astronomers can see today -- a black hole seems to gain most of its mass by swallowing gas from its environment.Amid all the squabbling over middleweights looms the likelihood of much larger merger candidates. Mega-mergersGalaxy merging is almost a given. It is thought to have contributed significantly to the past growth of the Milky Way, for example. The early universe, having not yet expanded much, was incredibly crowded. Like racked billiard balls, nascent galaxies were more likely to collide. If two galaxies merge, so should their black holes. Recent computer modeling speculates the event would be violent, unleashing tremendous light as gas is trapped between the two black holes and then rushes toward the more massive one. Galactic mergers take millions of years, so they can't readily be observed in progress. A recent peek into a nearby galaxy provided evidence for the scenario, however. At the heart of galaxy NGC 6240 astronomers found not one but two black holes, roughly 3,000 light-years apart and closing on an apparent merger course. The Chandra X-ray Observatory observations show that NGC 6240 is actually two galaxies that started joining forces about 30 million years ago.Other indications of mega-mergers come from relatively nearby quasars.Richard Larson, a Yale astronomer who studies star formation in galactic nuclei, says galaxies can go through several quasar phases during their lives. In studying quasars at more reasonable distances (which also means not so far in the past), he consistently sees signs of recent galaxy mergers or other large-scale interactions that served as triggers."Interactions and mergers are an excellent way to dump a lot of gas into the center of a galaxy," Larson explains. "The first thing this gas does is suddenly form huge numbers of stars."Bursts of intense star formation seem to last about 10 million to 20 million years around a typical quasar. Some of the gas that does not go into generating stars falls on in to the black hole. This violent phase of consumption is the one that is readily observed, because the castoff energy turns the incoming gas and dust into a glowing cloud. Eventually, the chaos settles and the new stars become visible. Later, the quasar itself is left naked. Finally, it goes dormant.Larson figures this scenario for black hole feeding probably applies to the most distant quasars, too. And it supports the notion that black holes do in fact gain most of their bulk by accreting gas.Fresh spinTo sort out the specifics of co-evolution, astronomers will need to see more of the universe and inspect it in greater detail. The prospects are good, especially toward the end of this decade.A project called LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) would search for "gravitational waves" kicked up in the aftermath of black hole mergers, perhaps proving that such colossal collisions do occur. The NASA satellite is tentatively slated for launch in 2008.A vastly improved understanding of dark matter is also needed. Several telescopes should contribute to this effort, but since no one knows what the stuff is, forecasting any sort of resolution is highly speculative.And the specific mechanics of black holes must be investigated fully. For now, theorists don't even know exactly how matter is shuttled inward and consumed. Much of this work can be done by observing the nearby universe. Roger Blandford, the Caltech theoretician, has suggested a novel way to prove that early mergers were not serious contributors to black hole growth. Blandford says two primary parameters characterize black holes. Mass is the most obvious. A more subtle measurement is spin. Yes, black holes seem to spin. The idea only emerged from theory to relatively firm observations in May of 2001, and it remains unproven.But if spin can be proved a universal aspect of black holes, then the rate of spin can be used to infer something very important about a black hole's history."If black holes grow by merging, by combinations of black holes, they should spin down quite quickly," Blandford explains. "This then becomes a fairly good argument that, if you can show that black holes really are spinning rapidly, they probably didn't grow by merging, but would have grown by accreting gas."Most important, vision simply must be extended further back in time, beyond the quasars that are now being studied, says Karl Gebhardt, a University of Texas astronomer and a member of Richstone's team."They're essentially the tip of the iceberg," Gebhardt says of the objects so far observed. "We are projecting from what we see in a very special number of objects to the whole sample. That is part of the problem of the uncertainty now."Hubble may extend current vision a bit, but the next boon in deep-space discovery will likely have to wait for the James Web Space Telescope, planned for launch in 2010. Billed as the "first-light machine," the JWST will be Hubble on steroids, and it should muscle its way to a better view of a good portion of the cosmic dark ages.It is ironic to think that when JWST goes up, many astronomers and cosmologists will be banking on black holes to light the way to a scientific account of the earliest epoch of the visible universe, an obscure time they have long dreamed about and can now, almost, see.

                                                                                                             That double-header of a rover mission to Mars -- Spirit and Opportunity -- are both moving toward fresh rounds of science-gathering and could survive far longer than once expected. Opportunity at Meridiani Planum, has received the go-ahead to "deep dive" into a large impact crater dubbed "Endurance", while on the other side of Mars, the Spirit rover at Gusev Crater is within days of reaching the "Columbia Hills" and studying geology that appears to offer unique insight into that region’s history. Meanwhile, scientists and engineers that operate the robotic twosome are looking at "wintering over" schemes -- putting the mechanized explorers in hibernation mode, and then restarting their duties on Mars next spring. Mars rover scientists detailed future plans at last week’s American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting, held in Denver, Colorado. Taste-testing the hills "Things are about to get very, very interesting," said Steve Squyres of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and principal investigator for the science payload carried on each of the Mars rovers. At Gusev Crater, Spirit has been making remarkable progress driving toward the Columbia Hills. "The hills are starting to get too big. So the images cut off the top of the hills…and that’s kinda cool," Squyres said. Those pictures of the hills already reveal exposed bedrock and other features that look "very interesting, indeed," he added. "We should pull up at the base of those hills within another week, or a little bit more. Then we’ll see what we see," Squyres said. A preliminary plan is to have Spirit traverse southward, along the margin between the hills and the plains of Gusev Crater. A variety of geological features is in that direction. "I don’t have high confidence to be able to climb high into the hills," Squyres said. "But as we get closer and closer…I can see that plan being altered significantly." Squyres told the AAS audience that Spirit will first "take a taste" of the hills with its science gear, "then hang a right". Exactly what the traverse will be like after that will be decided by what is found, he said. "That’s what is interesting about this mission. You can’t plan too far ahead because Mars will surprise you," Squyres explained. Enduring Endurance The Opportunity rover at Meridiani Planum is perched at the edge of the stadium-sized Endurance impact crater -- a feature roughly 65-feet (20 meters) deep and brimming with thick and old layers of bedrock and rich in sulfates, hematite, and basalts. Careful study has been done of a section of Endurance tagged "Karatepe" -- a layered band of rock. That piece of real estate is seen by rover drivers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California as a safe entrance ramp into the roughly 430-feet (130-meter) diameter crater. This spot is less steep and more approachable than the rest of the crater’s rocky outcrops. "It is a rocky surface, but there are these little spherules we call blueberries all over the place," said Jim Bell of Cornell University and leader of the panoramic camera team for the Mars Exploration Rovers. Bell told SPACE.com that the potential risk of having Opportunity drive on a plywood-like surface covered with spherules acting like ball-bearings has undergone detailed assessment. "The slopes are gentle enough. The rover wouldn’t go tumbling down the hill…but it would slide and be hard to control. You could get in a situation where you sit spinning your wheels trying to get back up," he said. Big cliffs Squyres said Endurance crater is "just a stunning, beautiful, spectacular place." But such a hole in the ground "can be a permanent rover trap," he added, and "a one-way trip doesn’t appeal to any of us very much." "This is a dangerous place for a rover. There are big cliffs that we could drive off and die. So we’ve been very careful here," Squyres said. In going into the crater, and taking a prudent route, Squyres said that Opportunity would drive slowly forward with its robot arm stretched out, steer to a band of exposed rock, do its business and then back out, straight up the hill. "The vehicle goes backwards as well as it goes forward," Squyres pointed out. So far, so good Regarding the overall health of the twin vessels of Mars exploration, both robots continue to perform well. Several things could kill the rovers, such as a key electronic part failure or the wearing down of a critical mechanical piece of equipment. To date it has been so far, so good as the robots continue to march their way across the martian landscape. "If both of those things hold out, then what is probably going to get us is dust build-up on the solar arrays," Squyres said. "Right now, we’re seeing a pretty sharp drop off in solar power on both vehicles. That’s a consequence of both the onset of winter and declining solar power because of the dust build-up." Despite this issue, Squyres said rover engineers think the two robots will survive through the winter and to the next spring on Mars. Wintering over: spring back to life? Staying alive is tougher for Spirit than it is for Opportunity. That’s due to Spirit’s higher latitude exploration zone on the red planet, Squyres reported. "We’re already looking at maps of the Columbia Hills and trying to pick a good spot to winter over," he said. Part of the wintering over strategy will involve positioning the rovers to soak up as much continuous sunlight, even as the Sun moves low in the martian sky, Bell said. Secondly, the robots are to be oriented so that communications links with orbiters zipping overhead is maximized, he pointed out. "It’s a combination of those two things -- finding that sweet spot," Bell said. Coming out of hibernation mode in the spring, "we’re looking at the final demise of these vehicles perhaps as late as the onset of our second winter on Mars," Squyres concluded

         When Venus crossed the Sun June 8, showing up as a clear black dot to the  urlLink delight  of millions of skywatchers around the world, astronomers noted something less obvious: The amount of sunlight reaching Earth dipped by 0.1 percent for a few hours. The result was not a surprise, but since Venus hadn't transited the Sun in more than a century, the effect had never been measured. The drop in sunlight was similar to what happens when a large sunspot crosses the solar surface. But these forms of natural sunblock don't behave as you might expect, as witnessed by folks who froze their tails off a few hundred years ago across much of the Northern Hemisphere. Two types of transits Sunspots are cool, dimmer regions of the solar surface, packed with pent-up magnetic energy that sometimes unleash storms of X-rays and superheated gas. When they transit the face of the Sun, they are often visible without magnification to skywatchers using  urlLink safe viewing techniques  (looking directly at the Sun can cause permanent eye damage). The planets Venus and  urlLink Mercury , both orbiting inside Earth's path, also transit the Sun. Sunlight reaching Earth is monitored by NASA's Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite. The Venus transit proved to be a good test of instrument sensitivity. "Because of its distance from Earth, Venus  urlLink appeared  to be about the size of a sunspot" on June 8, said Gary Rottman, SORCE Principal Investigator and a scientist at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Rottman and colleagues saw greater reductions in the Sun's energy coming Earthward during a stretch of  urlLink intense solar activity  last October, when several  urlLink huge sunspots  generated a record-breaking string of solar flares. At one point, sunlight dimmed 0.3 percent for about four days, due mostly to three large sunspot groups. "This is an unprecedented large decrease in the amount of sunlight," Rottman said, and it is comparable to the decrease that scientists estimate occurred from roughly 1645 to 1715. During a broader period, from the 1400s to the 1700s, Europe and North America were plunged into what came to be called the Little Ice Age. Dearth of sunspots Scientists could not measure solar radiation back then. But sunspots were recorded by several astronomers, and Rottman and others believe there is a correlation between the climate of the time and the lack of sunspots. "For a period of about 50 years, there were almost no sunspots," Rottman said in a telephone interview. "The total amount of radiation was, we assume, about three-tenths of 1 percent less" than in normal periods of solar activity. If you've been paying attention, that might sound backward. Rottman's team measured a decrease in sunlight when Venus transited the Sun, and similar decreases are recorded when sunspots are present. So why would there have been less radiation in the late 1600s when there were very few sunspots? Rottman explains: Sunspots indicate greater solar activity in general. While they do dampen sunlight while on the face of the Sun, they are surrounded by intensely bright regions called " urlLink faculae " or "plage." When sunspots are on the limb of the Sun -- just rotating onto or off of the face -- the plage are prominent from our vantagepoint, creating a significant increase in radiation that far outweighs the dip of radiation caused by the rest of the sunspot's transit. Seen on a graph, total visible and infrared radiation increases just before a sunspot appears, dips slightly for several days as it crosses the surface, then increases again as it disappears. A lack of sunspots indicates inactivity in the Sun, and less radiation overall. Still a mystery The reduced solar activity of the 1600s and 1700s is called the Maunder minimum, after the solar astronomer Edward Walter Maunder, who during the 1800s investigated the historical sunspot records. Nobody knows for sure why it occurred or whether it will happen again anytime soon. In fact, the whole concept remains controversial, because it's not clear how well astronomers were counting sunspots during the Maunder minimum. And the exact tie to climate is not understood. Most tend to agree, however, that there was a distinct lack of solar activity. "Something very different was happening during the 17th Century, and it produced a much more permanent change in the Sun's energy output at that time," Rottman said.  urlLink Live Sun Cam   urlLink Mysteries of the Sun   urlLink The Sunspots of October 2003   urlLink Photos of Venus Crossing the Sun

       ........................The Atom..................{part one} Most of us are familiar with the fact that any matter whether a liquid, or a solid, or a gas, is made up f molecules. A molecule is the smallest particle that a compound can be reduced to before it breaks down into its element. For example, if we took a grain of table salt and kept breaking it in half until it got as small as it possibly could and yet still be salt, we would have a molecule of salt. If we then broke it in half again, the salt would change into its elements.  1-a grain of salt 2-can be reduced to 3-a molecule of salt {sodium chlorine: . .} by  urlLink mohammadreza_naserian

       As scenes of rioting robots are in the trailer, it is probably not giving away too much to say that there are elements of I, ROBOT that resemble another 20th Century Fox science-fiction film of long ago, namely CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. Now, robots and apes are not all that similar, but both movies concern near-future societies in which a non-human slave force shows signs of rebelling against the ruling class. Nobody will be surprised that I, ROBOT is infinitely superior in terms of special effects and it’s got much better plotting – the screenplay by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman, from Vintar’s story, which in turn derives the basic precepts of its universe from the work of Isaac Asimov, is in fact quite a good murder mystery. What APES has that I, ROBOT lacks is a passionately subversive spirit. This may seem like an irrelevant criticism, as good science-fiction (especially in the movies) need not be in the least subversive to work. However, I, ROBOT is just out there enough that we can feel something a lot more outrageous pulsing along under the more than proficient but less than daring surface. In 2035, most menial work is done by polite, intelligent-seeming machines that resemble contemporary crash test dummies. Robot-hating Chicago homicide detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), newly back at work after a nightmare-inducing tragedy, is called in to investigate an apparent suicide at U.S. Robotics. The victim is the firm’s chief scientist, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), who had met Spooner in the past and has for some reason left a holographic message for the detective. Spooner suspects murder – in fact, he believes Lanning was killed by a robot. This would seem to be impossible, as the first and most important of the Three Laws of Robotics states that a robot cannot harm a human, or through inaction allow a human to come to harm. However, a prototype robot called Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk) appears to be able to violate the Laws of Robotics and also (much to Spooner’s consternation and dismay) seems capable of independent thought and even emotion. But why would this robot kill the creator he claims to love? And what is U.S. Robotics chief Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) trying to hide? The puzzle aspect of I, ROBOT is its most compelling feature. The structure is strong and we genuinely do not guess exactly what is going on right away, although the clues are laid out for us fairly. Another bonus is Smith’s performance, which is intelligent and charismatic enough to carry us along even over the rough patches. Smith’s demeanor is noticeably darker here than usual – he’s not a cold fish and he’s definitely got a sense of humor, but the rage under the surface is a lot closer to volcanic than playful this time out. As the voice and basis for the expressive if very subtly detailed face and form of Sonny, Tudyk is thoughtful and appealing, making the self-aware robot the most likable character in the film Here is where the movie runs into one of its problems. Several key supporting performers have apparently been directed to be cold and unemotional – the energy level goes way down during their scenes, some of which entail massive exposition that could have used any and all available torque. Also, while this may be a controversial view, the gleaming, basic look of the robots is visually intriguing at first, but comes to look uninflected later – the CGI when the robots are not interacting with live performers is dimensional yet feels more digital than visceral. Director Alex Proyas stages some great action sequences and he and the writers show signs of having a message they would like to convey (there are a couple of plot points that are analogous to contemporary political issues). They also want to put across some thought-provoking moral ambiguity, which is usually welcome in movies, especially in this genre. However, they tend to pull their punches a bit, so that the ending feels both diffuse and defused. They want us to root for both humanity in general (even when we see humans bullying the subservient robots) and for Sonny’s right to exist in specific terms (although it is plain that most if not all of his brethren really are high-functioning automatons). In terms of statement, they have their cake and eat it, too – it just tastes a bit bland that way.

       Future travelers will be putting down their luggage in far-flung places, underwater, in the air and around the planet. They'll get amazing views from bizarre living quarters that build on "outrageously successful" billion-dollar projects on Earth, and they'll take adventures that have long been the province of science fiction. That’s the vacationing landscape of the 21st Century envisioned by various travel analysts. Thomson Holidays, a leading travel and destination group based in the United Kingdom, just issued a report on the future of leisure travel. The report is an outgrowth of the Future Holiday Forum, an event Thomson organized late last year to bring together architects, technologists, travel journalists, experts on social trends of the future, as well as authorities on sustainable tourism. The conclusions are a sweeping preview of the changing needs and expectations of globetrotting travelers two decades out. They include way-out expeditions and down-to-Earth jaunts. No-frills travel will include brief, affordable breaks to locations such as Moscow, Rio and Cape Town. The Middle East and South America will vie for top billing with traditional European destinations. And others say regular civilian flights to space could finally become reality. Ride the Cosmoplane Development by 2024 of the Cosmoplane - a successor to Concorde - will make it possible for adventurous travelers to go farther and faster. More traditional types of destinations won't be crowded out of the picture. In fact they'll just get more crowded as an aging population swells the ranks of folks with time and money to spare, looking for new places to wander. China is predicted to be the world's number one tourist destination within 20 years. Elsewhere in Asia, countries along the Silk Road such as Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan are likely to see a dramatic rise in tourist numbers as backpackers seek out new destinations. Other destinations that can expect throngs include Qatar in the Middle East with its positioning as the 'Real Arabian Experience', Ljubljana in Slovenia as a city break, and Slovakia for its natural scenery and outdoor sports potential. Then there’s Brazil for its unbeatable combination of beaches, rainforest, nightlife and cities, according to the report. Other key predictions: In the 2020s, people over 50 will outnumber younger generations. This aging but very active population will holiday more frequently in increasingly exotic locations, thinking nothing of jetting off to destinations all over the world. The 'real holiday' experience for travelers is seeking many different experiences. That includes "zorbing," in which "zorbonauts" climb inside a large inflatable ball and are rolled downhill; skydiving; watching polar bears in the wild; and mind-and-body getaways at yoga retreats. A new breed of tourist will seek out eco-friendly holidays. Less than 1 percent of people currently look for sustainable destinations, but this is predicted to grow to 5 percent by 2024, with many people only traveling to places that protect or benefit the environment. Beyond Earth In the wake of the first private, manned mission to space -- SpaceShipOne's history-making  urlLink trip beyond the atmosphere  on Monday -- space hotels may also be on the horizon, according to other analysts. "It's only a question of time and money," explained Howard Wolff, senior vice president of the international architecture and design firm Wimberly Allison Tong & Goo (WATG), from his office in Honolulu, Hawaii. Wolff noted that the ability to create habitats in space exists. "The obstacle is not technology," he told SPACE.com. "The Catch-22 is that a space hotel won't be affordable until there is a mass market for space tourism … and there won't be a mass market until it's affordable." The missing ingredient, Wolff said, is a commercially viable fleet of reusable launch vehicles. "You can't have a successful hotel if you don't have the means of getting people there." Visionary clients Wolff, who is spearheading his company's development of concepts for a hotel in Earth orbit, is optimistic. "The interest exists among prospective travelers," he said. "Several companies are already testing the next generation of vehicles. The hotel investment community is intrigued but skeptical. All it will take is one entrepreneur with deep pockets who is willing to take a bit of a financial risk." WATG has been involved in ambitious on-Earth destinations for travelers in 130 countries on six continents, such as: The Venetian in Las Vegas; Atlantis, Paradise Island, in the Bahamas; and The Palace of the Lost City in South Africa. "We've worked with visionary clients who have invested well over a billion dollars to create a single resort that generates a handsome return on investment," says Wolff. "Others thought they were crazy, but their properties turned out to be outrageously successful." Wolff predicted that the first hotel in space will be a mixed-use project with commercial and research applications that will make it easier to finance. What will fly? WATG’s visionary space hotel concept includes portions that will have partial Earth gravity "for creature comforts like being able to flush a toilet and take a shower" as well as weightless environments "for scientific experiments as well as the sheer thrill of the experience," Wolff explained. Having designed destinations for well-heeled travelers for over half a century, the folks at WATG have a pretty good handle on "what will fly," a confident Wolff added. Fly indeed. For those among us who want to stick closer to Earth, the WATG futurists also envision a potentially revolutionary helium-filled airship hotel. The concept melds elements of traveling by cruise ship, hot air balloon and airplane. No need for travelers to unpack. Passengers can hit any number of destinations in a given trip. Unlike an airplane, the airship hotel would cruise at a leisurely pace and at low altitude, giving camera-snapping sightseers picturesque viewing along the travel route. Deep Six those anxieties Afraid of the heights, be it spinning around in a space hotel or taking cloud-banking turns in an airship? Then deep six those anxieties and check into Hydropolis. Planning is already underway for this watery habitat to be built in Dubai, the second largest of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is being tagged more and more as the Las Vegas of the Middle East, known for its  urlLink over-the-top hotels . Hydropolis is no exception, albeit under the water. It is slated to open in December 2006. Planning documents for the venture point out a few factoids: For one, the medium "water" is a basic elixir of life. Then there’s the basic fact that a human is 75 percent of water, and that a person’s wellbeing requires regeneration of this basic substance. "Sanus per aquam" -- health through water -- is therefore not a trend, "but rather an expression of health-consciousness, a synonym for well-feeling, and of harmony of body, mind, and spirit," Hydropolis designers suggest. Hydropolis is to be located off the Jumeirah coast. As the world's first underwater luxury hotel, the plan is to construct three distinct areas: one on land, a connecting tunnel, and the submarine complex. There will also be a ballroom, spa, restaurants, shops and separate underwater villas. "Hydropolis is a splendid refuge far away from the stress factors of everyday business life and is ideally suited for guests from top management seeking to regenerate their inner strength," explains a project fact sheet. Pod hotels Hotel "pods" that can be moved to any spot on the globe is the way to go, contends Nadi Jahangiri, Director of m3architects in London. He and collaborator Ken Hutt foresee the pop-up pods planted anywhere from the Australian rainforest to the Antarctic. "We propose a temporary, licensed, pre-fabricated, self-sustaining, transportable facility that can be located on sites and locations all over the planet in places where establishing a traditional holiday resort would be unacceptable environmentally and politically," Jahangiri and Hutt reported at the Future Holiday Forum. These futuristic pods can remain in place for up to 15 years, or could be dismantled as demand drops for a destination. Constructed on stilts, the holiday pod is designed to leave only a small mark on the local environment. A pod would be fabricated off-site, then transported to a select location and assembled on the spot. Each pod would be self-sustaining and easily transportable from site to site. All waste produced by the hotel pod would go into a disposal unit at the base of the structure. The hotel would create its own operating power, making use of Sun-soaking, energy-providing photovoltaic cells. Different sized rooms within a hotel pod can be upgraded or downgraded according to a tourist’s travel budget. Inside the rooms, ‘active’ walls and floors will show changeable images. Pod guests can use this mode-changing select-switch and pick whatever mood they wish, be it an ocean panorama, desert landscape, or jungle scene. Guests would arrive by helicopter. Hugh Edwards, Marketing Director for Thomson, said the Future Holiday Forum -- which focused on Earth-bound travel -- underscored a number of trends. While he expects destinations such as Spain, Greece and Italy to remain popular, the forecasts are based on projections from experts who have carried out in-depth research into future trends. "Holidays in pods, mini-breaks to Rio and family holidays in Qatar are very likely scenarios for holidays of the future," Edwards said. MORE :  urlLink WWW.SPACE.COM

       By:  urlLink Brian Berger Space News Staff Writer Thirty-five years after the world watched three Americans leave Earth on a mission to be the first to land on the moon, the United States is plotting a return to the lunar landscape. But while the destination is the same, the motives have changed. Then the goal was to prove to a divided world simply that it could be done and done best by a free society. Now the driving motivation is to demonstrate the technologies and hone the skills needed to venture beyond Earth’s own backyard. U.S. President George W. Bush, in dropping the exploration gauntlet during his speech at NASA headquarters in January, said the United States would return to the moon by 2020 “as a launching point for missions beyond.” Beginning no later than 2008, Bush said, the United States would begin launching robotic missions to the moon to prepare the way for extended human lunar expeditions. Bush said the moon is a good place to test the equipment and approaches needed if humans are to operate in even more challenging space environments. And the moon’s natural resources and other attributes, he said, have the potential to reduce the costs of further space exploration. Paul Spudis, a planetary scientist and a member of the presidential commission advising Bush on implementing a national space exploration strategy, said the president got it right when he called for going to the moon first. “We are going to the moon to basically take the first step beyond low Earth orbit,” Spudis said. “The key thing the president articulated in the vision is the use of lunar resources. It’s something we don’t know how to do, but something we need to be able to do if there is to be a big future for humans in space.” Doug Cooke, NASA’s deputy associate administrator for exploration systems, said the U.S. space agency’s moon agenda is still very much a work in progress. “At one end of the scale, we are talking primarily about preparation for exploration beyond the moon -- developing vehicles, spacesuits and other hardware and testing operational capabilities and techniques,” Cooke said. “At the other end of the scale, if there are outside interests that want to develop the moon and they come into play, that could drive us harder toward more permanent capabilities.” Cooke said NASA is hard at work evaluating a range of approaches to accomplishing the broad objectives spelled out by the president. NASA has put out a broad call to industry for long range lunar mission proposals and hopes to award several study contracts before the end of the year. Cooke said NASA should have a better understanding of the range of possible approaches by September. Some moon advocates, such as Spudis and Klaus Heiss, director of High Frontier, favor picking a promising plot of lunar real estate and plopping down as much infrastructure as needed to sustain a variety of human and robotic activities. Others, such as Marc Cohen, a researcher at NASA’s Ames Research Center, are advocating building a mobile habitat that can traverse the lunar surface to new destinations while waiting for its human occupants to arrive. Regardless of how NASA gets there, Cooke said the driving motivation behind going back to the moon is to prepare for increasingly challenging missions. “We’ve always thought the moon was important, at the very least, for preparing future exploration,” he said. “It has been 35 years since we did it for the first time and a lot of the experience we gained during the Apollo program has been lost.” As NASA sets out to design the vehicles, habitats and other equipment it will need for extended stays on the moon, Cook said the agency also would be keeping one eye on Mars. “We need to be mindful of the long range of exploration,” he said. “The more that we can do that is common for what we will need for Mars missions, the more efficiently we can progress down that path of exploration.” Perhaps the most tantalizing feature the moon and Mars have in common is the presence of water -- a critical element for sustaining a human presence, and not just for drinking. Cooke sees water, whether present in the surface or atmosphere of Mars or frozen in the lunar surface, as a valuable source of fuel for all manner of space vehicles. “The water ice is probably the first thing that would be investigated because it might have immediate application to various missions,” Cooke said. Those applications, Cooke said, include providing potable water, breathable oxygen and fuel for nuclear thermal or chemical rockets. The search for water could well lead to the lunar poles, a destination favored by Spudis and others in large part because of the intriguing signatures returned by the Lunar Prospector and Clementine missions of the early 1990s. “You can readily make the case that because of the presence of [potential resources] in the dark areas and near permanent sunlight offers an ideal environment to learn the things we need to learn,” Spudis said.

       NASA engineers are hard at work on a lunar spacecraft expected to be the first in a wave of robotic probes that will pave the way for future human missions. The spacecraft, called the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), is the first mission out of the gate under NASA’s space vision of sending more robot and human explorers beyond Earth orbit. “This mission is the first concrete step in laying the groundwork for humans to go back to the moon,” said Jim Garvin, the lead scientist for moon and Mars exploration at NASA headquarters in Washington. “So there’s a lot resting on its shoulders.” Set for a 2008 launch, the probe is expected to circle the moon for at least one year and return detailed maps of the lunar surface, data on the moon’s radiation levels and an in-depth look at its polar regions for resources that could be tapped by future astronauts. But everything is still on paper, and project engineers have a narrow window in which to design, build and integrate the spacecraft to meet their intended launch date. Engineers at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., are designing the actual spacecraft bus, while the instrument payload will be provided by private industry. An Acquisition of Opportunity for the payload was announced June 18 and a final design is expected to be in hand in November. “This is certainly a quick development mission,” Garvin said in a telephone interview. “There’s not a lot of time to generate a high-reliability flight mission.” Exactly how LRO will make its moon measurements is still an unknown, though mission planners can envision a number of routes private payload designers might take. “This is not a science mission, it’s a measurement mission,” Garvin said. “For example, we don’t have any lunar maps at the scale of a landing site since the Apollo missions, but there are a variety of ways to make them.” LRO’s topographic map-making instruments may include one or more of the following: conventional radar, laser-based range systems like Light Detection and Ranging, or a system known as synthetic aperture radar that combines radar measurements with computer analysis to make detailed measurements. High-resolution cameras similar to those used in the one-meter resolution Ikonos satellites owned by Space Imaging Inc. will be required to photograph the lunar surface. Part of LRO’s mission is to identify potential landing sites for future missions and any nearby hazards, such as boulders, which could shift and knock a lander or human down, Garvin said. LRO’s imaging system also is expected to be able to look into permanently shadowed regions of the moon and its polar regions to look for signs of large water ice deposits — on the scale of football fields — that could be viable resources in future missions. A critical part of any prolonged human stay on the moon is the amount of radiation astronauts will be subject to during a mission. LRO’s instrument set also should be able to determine the biological effects of that lunar radiation environment. Jim Watzin, lunar exploration program manager at NASA’s Goddard Spaceflight Center, said NASA engineers have already begun preliminary design work on the spacecraft. Even without a final payload in hand, Goddard engineers have been able to define some of the parameters their spacecraft must meet. Since time is of the essence, LRO will make use of conventional technology instead of untested tools. That means a chemical-fueled rocket will push the spacecraft moonward as opposed to more exotic approaches, such as an ion engine or other propulsion methods. A conventional approach also keeps costs down, an important point since the mission’s total budget from development through first-year operations is set at about $90 million. “We’re constrained to be a Discovery class [mission] in cost, so we have to limit ourselves to a Delta 2 launch vehicle,” Watzin said. Because of that rocket limitation, project engineers know their final spacecraft must weigh about 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds), half of which will be propellant to not only push LRO to the moon, but keep it in the proper lunar orbit once it arrives, Watzin said. And because the spacecraft will be making detailed maps from an altitude of about 50 kilometers (31 miles), LRO will need to be able to accurately point itself in any direction, he added. The spacecraft will also require a robust power and communications system to relay large amounts of data to Earth and sustain its science instruments. “We’re pushing the spacecraft design as far as we can go knowing, in general, what the capabilities it needs and having some idea on the classes of instruments it will have,” LRO project manager Craig Tooley said in a telephone interview. Lunar pathfinder The future of NASA’s lunar exploration exploits may ride heavily on the data LRO sends back to Earth. If LRO’s lunar maps point out an obvious point of interest on the surface, the space agency may choose a robot lander mission to drop on the area for a more detailed study. A second possibility would be a second orbiter, armed with more science instruments, to conduct more reconnaissance. “The early months of [LRO] would target things that the second mission would follow in this lunar robotic program,” Garvin said. “But we’re talking about moderate-class missions here, not billion-dollar, 100-yard wandering rovers.”     urlLink www.space.com

        DENVER, COLORADO – Those twin robots hard at work on Mars have transmitted teasing views that reinforce the prospect that microbial life may exist on the red planet. Results from NASA’s Spirit and Opportunity rovers are being looked over by a legion of planetary experts, including a scientist who remains steadfast that his  urlLink experiment in 1976  proved the presence of active microbial life in the topsoil of Mars. "All factors necessary to constitute a habitat for life as we know it exist on current-day Mars," explained Gilbert Levin, executive officer for science at Spherix Incorporated of Beltsville, Maryland. Levin made his remarks here Monday at the International Symposium on Optical Science and Technology, the 49th annual meeting of Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). Provocative find Levin has a long-standing interest in time-weathered Mars and the promise of life today on that distant and dusty world. NASA’s 1976 Viking mission to Mars was geared-up to look for possible martian life. And it was Levin’s Labeled Release experiment that made a provocative find: The presence of a highly reactive agent in the surface material of Mars. Levin concluded in 1997 that this activity was triggered by living microorganisms lurking in the martian soil – a judgment he admits has not been generally accepted by the scientific community. Now roll forward to 2004. Consider the findings of Spirit and Opportunity, the golf-cart sized robots wheeling over Mars at Gusev Crater and Meridiani Planum. "Those rovers have been absolutely sensational, pouring out thousands of images. Those images have lots of information in them. And I’ve tried to deduce something in there relative to life…and I think I found a lot," Levin told SPACE.com. Squeezed out of the soil In perusing rover imagery, Levin reports there is clear evidence for liquid water existing under Martian environmental conditions. "The images should be reviewed against the background of surface temperatures as varying from below to above freezing reported by both Spirit and Opportunity," he explained. Levin points to the potential for mud puddles on Mars, showing an image of clearly disturbed martian soil after rover airbags bounced across Mars’ surface. Possible standing water and sinkholes can also be seen in rover imagery, according to his analysis. In some pictures, the often-discussed "blueberries, " tiny spheres of material, disappear as if submerged underneath mud-like surroundings, he added. Then there are tracks left by the machines as they roll across the martian terrain. Self-taken shots by the robots show what Levin said appears to be water squeezed out of the soil which then freezes into a whitish residue left in embedded tread marks. Similarly, Levin added, are images taken by Opportunity of the results from an operation of the robot’s Rock Abrasion Tool, or RAT. The center of that particular RAT hole is largely white, possibly indicating the formation of frost since the hole was drilled, he noted. Organisms there now? "The evidence presented strongly indicates the presence of liquid water or moisture at the Mars Exploration Rover sites," Levin reported at the SPIE meeting. "Mars today could support many forms of terrestrial microbial life." Other scientists are cautious to point out that the presence of water does not guarantee life. Rather, it means one crucial ingredient exists. There is clear evidence for frost or ice on Mars, the former Viking experimenter stated. At some point of the day -- when temperatures climb above freezing -- there’s going to be moisture…"and that’s enough to support microorganisms," he said. None of the many new findings about Mars revealed by Spirit and Opportunity, Levin concluded, conflict with, or render untenable, his long-held belief that the Viking Labeled Release experiment in 1976 detected living microorganisms in the soil of Mars. "I contend that today you could take a great many Earth microorganisms, put them on Mars, and they’d grow," Levin said. "And I think there are organisms there now. They may have come from Earth. They may have originated on Mars. They may have come from a third place that populated both Mars and Earth." Rocks can be kicked up from one planet by an asteroid impact, drift through space for eons, then land on the other. Other studies have shown that these rocks could potentially  urlLink transport life , in a dormant phase, from one planet to the other. Levin said that he thinks the "greatest speculation" would be to say there can be no life on Mars. Moon used as Earth bio-shield If indeed Mars is rife with life, care should be taken in hauling back to Earth specimens of rock and surface materials from the red planet. NASA has indicated that, next decade, robotic craft could be dispatched to gather and return to Earth select samples of Mars for detailed laboratory study. Could those bits of Mars, perhaps laden with martian microbes, act as dangerous cargo? As a precaution, Levin advocates a kind of bio-shield strategy for Earth – but using the Moon. The new NASA vision to reestablish a human presence on the Moon is good timing, Levin said. "Bring samples of Mars not to Earth but to the Moon," he said. "There we would have built a scientific laboratory in which scientists could examine the samples and determine whether or not there is a hazard."

        Despite a 24-hour delay, a NASA spacecraft bound for Mercury was successfully launched early Tuesday, the first step in a seven-year journey to the small planet.  A Boeing-built Delta 2 rocket shot the spacecraft MESSENGER off planet at 2:15:56 a.m. EDT (0615:56 GMT) on a pillar of flame above its launch pad at NASA’s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The on-time space shot easily made its 12-second window, with none of the delays that  urlLink scrubbed  a previous attempt to launch the spacecraft on Aug. 2.  “This was another great Boeing and NASA success as we bid MESSENGER farewell,” said Chuck Dovale, NASA launch director at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, after the launch.   urlLink MESSENGER , an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging, is the first NASA spacecraft to Mercury since Mariner 10 passed by the planet three times between 1974 and 1975.  ““Mercury is very hard to get to,” explained MESSENGER science team member Ralph McNutt, from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, during the Aug. 2 launch attempt. “To get there, the MESSENGER spacecraft is about 55 percent fuel, about the same amount as the Cassini spacecraft to Saturn.”  MESSENGER is also expected to provide some hints to questions about Mercury’s density, interior and exterior composition, as well as its surface features and magnetic field. The spacecraft is taking a roundabout path to Mercury, swinging by three inner planets before entering orbit around Mercury in March 2011.  There were some weather concerns prior to MESSENGER’s liftoff. Nearby cloud cover, and the failure of launch weather balloons to reach high into the atmosphere gave launch planners some concern. But the clouds dissipated and one last batch of weather balloons reached their designated height of 90,000 feet before launch.  A good start  Cape Canveral launch officials applauded as MESSENGER’s Delta 2 booster sent the spacecraft on its way.  Four minutes into the flight, the spacecraft-rocket combo shed its first stage and ignited its second stage for a four-minute burn to reach orbit. After a 37-minute coast phase, MESSENGER’s Delta 2 booster again fired its second stage for a three-minute burn. The spacecraft’s third stage also made a short, two-minute maneuver before MESSENGER separated from its rocket and began its trip to Mercury about 59 minutes after launch.  MESSENGER then loosed its two solar panels to generate power and switched off its batteries. The event marked the end of the first leg of MESSENGER’s five billion-mile journey to Mercury. Over the next seven years, the spacecraft will swing by the Earth once, Venus twice and Mercury three times before reaching a final orbit around the small planet.  After a year of science observations, the spacecraft will have completed its primary mission.  “The mission ends with a whimper,” McNutt said, adding MESSENGER’s fuel tanks were budgeted to provide enough propellant for a single year around Mercury. “By about 2015 or 2016, gravity will crash [MESSENGER] into the surface of the planet.”  Dovale said NASA’s next science spacecraft launch will come on Oct. 7, when the agency will launch the Swift Gamma Ray Burst Explorer atop a Boeing Delta 2 in a space shot to be staged from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

       from nasa newsletter   Alan Buis (818) 354-5011Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. Gretchen Cook-Anderson (202) 358-0836NASA Headquarters, Washington Sandy Miller Hays (301) 504-1638USDA Agricultural Research Service, Washington News Release: 2004-188 August 2, 2004 Scientists' Showdown With Soil Moisture At The O.K. Corral Tombstone, Ariz., is a dusty place known for Wyatt Earp's famous 1881 "Shootout at the O.K. Corral." This year, from August 2 to 27, it will be known as the place where scientists from NASA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other institutions gather and study soil moisture to improve weather forecasts and the ability to interpret satellite data. By identifying how much moisture is retained in soils, hydrologists will be able to determine how much more water can be absorbed, and thus better estimate the potential for flooding, or the amount of water that can sink into the water table. During July and August, the U.S. Southwestern monsoon season is characterized by a wind pattern shift that exerts a strong influence on precipitation and temperatures across the Western United States, Mexico and adjacent ocean areas. This change in winds over the region creates many rainy days and heavy rainfall, which are ideal conditions for studying soil moisture. The study, called the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004, will use ground teams, airplanes and NASA satellites and instruments to measure soil moisture in Tombstone and Sonora, Mexico, where water supplies are critical. Researchers from NASA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Sonora Research Institute and more than a dozen universities will be on the ground and in the air with advanced technology to get a better read on soil moisture. The Soil Moisture Experiment 2004 scientists also want to know what atmospheric conditions create long-lasting rainfalls over a large area. By determining which factors create large or small rainfall, hydrologists can provide better forecasts and know how much water will be available to people. "The Western U.S. relies on water from the Southwestern monsoon system to fill its aquifers. Accurate measurements of soil moisture will assist in better water supply forecasts associated with the monsoon in the water-scarce western U.S," said Tom Jackson, USDA Agricultural Research Service hydrologist and lead for the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004. From space, NASA's Aqua, Terra and QuikScat satellites will provide various measurements. Aqua's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer instrument will measure soil moisture; Terra's Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer will provide vegetation status; and Terra's Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer will measure the surface temperature. The SeaWinds instrument on the QuikScat satellite will observe the monsoon winds that bring in the moisture from the Pacific Ocean to the U.S. Southwest. Closer to Earth, microwave radiometers on the Naval Research Laboratory P-3 aircraft and the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer on NASA's ER-2 high-altitude aircraft will fly over the areas to measure soil moisture. The Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer will also help test new methods for remotely sensing water content in plants. Meanwhile, ground instruments will measure the temperature and percentage of moisture in soils from 2 to 40 inches deep. The satellite, airplane and ground data will be compared. The Soil Moisture Experiment 2004 mission adds to two prior soil moisture experiments in 2002 and 2003, and is part of the larger North American Monsoon Experiment, led by NOAA, which is dedicated to understanding how the Southwestern U.S. monsoon season works. Monsoons need to be accurately understood and predicted by weather and climate models, because their influence on seasonal weather, including floods and droughts, can significantly disrupt regional economies and populations. Dr. Eni Njoku of JPL is a member of the Aqua Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer science team. JPL manages Quikscat, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer on Terra, and Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer. NASA's Earth Science Enterprise is dedicated to understanding the Earth as an integrated system and applying Earth system science to improve prediction of climate, weather and natural hazards using the unique vantage point of space.

         A bright Perseid streaks just below the Andromeda Galaxy, M31, during the 2002 shower.   urlLink  Joe Orman    took this 5-minute exposure through a 40-millimeter lens at f/2.8 on Ektachrome P1600 slide film    The source of the Perseid shower is comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the Sun in a long, roughly 130-year ellipse. The comet sheds bits of its material each time it returns near the Sun. This debris keeps traveling along near the comet's orbital path, creating a sparse "river of rubble" in space. The comet swept past the Sun during the summer of 1862 and made a return appearance in December 1992. By no coincidence, in the early 1990s the Perseids performed spectacularly — displaying a new, additional, much briefer peak with outbursts of up to several hundred meteors per hour in 1991, 1992, and 1993. This new peak was slightly offset in time from the weaker, longer-lasting "traditional" peak of Perseid activity. In the years after the comet's departure, the strong, new Perseid peak decreased. For the last three years it has failed to appear at all. Accordingly, Perseid forecasts have generally returned to normal — with the maximum lasting about 12 hours centered on the time when the Earth is at the place in its orbit marked by the Sun's ecliptic longitude being 140.0° (equinox 2000.0). In 2004 that time is 11h  urlLink Universal Time  on August 12th (7 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, 4 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time). So North America, especially the West and Hawaii, is optimally positioned to catch the peak. The consensus among meteor astronomers is that the particles of the new, 1990s peak were probably shed by Comet Swift-Tuttle during its swing by the Sun in 1862, and that as far as this rich filament of meteoroids is concerned, the show is over. But now, astronomers Esko Lyytinen of Finland and Tom Van Flandern of Washington, DC, suggest that the new Perseid peak could stage a return appearance in 2004. They predict that this year, the one-revolution rubble trail released in 1862 will be passing just 0.00132 astronomical unit (about 200,000 km) inside Earth's orbit at the time of solar longitude 139.440°. That's 20:50 UT on August 11th, favoring meteor watchers in Eastern Europe and eastern North Africa eastward to central Russia, India, and western China. Lyytinen and Van Flandern base their prediction on the same techniques they used (rather successfully) in forecasting the intensities of the Leonid showers from 1999 through 2002. "It is very uncertain what kind of a shower this will give," notes Lyytinen. "If the numbers of particles released for the 1862 trail were the same as for the Leonid parent comet, I would say a ZHR [zenith hourly rate] of around 100 is possible. But," he adds, "we must also consider that the Perseid parent comet is a lot bigger than the Leonid comet, so there may even be a slight chance of storm-level activity," meaning a ZHR of 1,000 or more. Lyytinen and Van Flandern believe that most of these meteors could be rather faint, 3rd and 4th magnitude. If an outburst happens, it is likely to last no more than about 40 minutes. Last, because recent perturbations by Jupiter are directing old Perseid meteoroids about 0.01 a.u. closer to the Sun, the core of the broader, "traditional" stream may be shifted closer to Earth،s orbit, resulting in a stronger-than-average annual shower. In fact, Lyytinen and Van Flandern suspect that the Perseids tend to put on stronger-than-average displays at 12-year intervals (12 years being Jupiter's orbital period), and that 2004 is one of the favored years. The 1992 display might not qualify for comparison because the parent comet was nearby — but 1980 brought an excellent show punctuated by many fireballs, and 1968 was rated quite good despite bright moonlight. Will we be similarly rewarded this year? If so, the enhancement would come into play only around the date of the normal maximum, perhaps even appearing as a new, additional peak. So there could hardly be more incentive for meteor watchers to be out in force this month. One thing is certain: the Moon will be dark and the meteors bright.

        The crew of the International Space Station (ISS) flawlessly completed a spacewalk Tuesday morning, preparing their orbital home for a new cargo ship and retrieving experiments attached to its hull.  ISS Expedition 9 commander Gennady Padalka and NASA ISS Science Officer Michael Fincke are safely back inside the space station after a 4.5-hour spacewalk that found them consistently ahead of schedule and so eager to work that ground controllers repeatedly urged them to take breaks and enjoys the scenery.  “It’s a great view,” Fincke said during a rest early in the activity as he watched the sun rise during one of the spacecraft's 90-minute orbit of the planet.  The spacewalk was the third extravehicular activity (EVA) for the Expedition 9 crew and began when Padalka and Fincke opened the outer hatch of the station’s Pirs Docking Compartment at 2:58 a.m. EDT (0658 GMT) Tuesday morning. By the spacewalk’s end at 7:28 a.m. EDT (1128 GMT), the astronauts had completed all of their EVA tasks.  Preparing for ‘Jules Verne’  Expedition 9’s primary task during the spacewalk was to prepare a docking port on the aft end of the station’s Zvezda Service Module to receive an unpiloted European supply vehicle expected to make its first delivery in the fall of 2005.  The cargo-carrying Autonomous Transfer Vehicle (ATV), named Jules Verne by its builders, is an unmanned spacecraft developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). It carries three times the cargo capacity of Russia’s unmanned Progress ships, and may also be used to move the ISS if needed.  It took the Expedition 9 crew about 30 minutes from exiting the space station to reach their Zvezda worksite, but once the astronauts arrived, they were all business.  Padalka and Fincke removed six obsolete laser reflectors used for docking, replacing four of them with more modern versions. The crew also installed two antennas - to allow the Jules Verne ATV to communicate with the space station - and removed a cable from a faulty television camera that will be retrieved in a later spacewalk.  The astronauts also replaced a series of space exposure experiments, including a folding replaceable cassette container filled with materials and a Kromka experiment that measured contamination caused by the station’s thrusters.  “I did not work much,” said an energetic Padalka during the spacewalk. “I’m not tired.”  Drifting in space  Despite their busy schedule, Padalka and Fincke snagged some 40 minutes of down time while outside the space station when mission controllers reoriented the station using its Russian thrusters.  The reorientation was required primarily to counteract the effect of the Expedition 9 crew, NASA spacewalk commentators said.  When the Expedition 9 crew first ventured out to the aft of Zvezda, U.S. station handlers put the ISS under U.S. momentum gyroscope control to prevent Russian thrusters on the module from firing while crewmembers were near.  But the heavy work activity on Zvezda’s aft by Padalka and Fincke increased the momentum load on the gyroscopes and the station began to drift slightly off course. The drift led ground controllers to institute power conservation procedures that temporarily cut off primary S-band communications with the Expedition 9 crew, though a backup system reestablished contact.  NASA officials said Russian and U.S. station controllers had anticipated the drift, but concluded it posed no danger to the crew or station. It was easily cancelled out at about 5:15 a.m. EDT (0915 GMT), when Russian thrusters were fired while Padalka and Fincke were at a safe distance from Zvezda’s aft.  By 6:00 a.m. EDT (1000 GMT),the spacewalkers resumed their work.  One more to go  Padalka and Fincke still have one last spacewalk to perform before they turn the ISS over to new tenants in October. Some of those activities will also be ATV-related, NASA officials said. Tuesday’s spacewalk was the 55th EVA made to support space station and the 12th staged from the Pirs compartment. The spacewalk marks Padalka’s fifth career spacewalk and the third for Fincke. The three Expedition 9 spacewalks to date total of more than 10 hours of EVA work for the astronauts.

        Flip a coin. Heads, Earth is a common sort of planet. Tails, and ours is as unusual as a coin landing on edge. That's about the state of knowledge for scientists who ponder the question of our planet's rarity.  But lack of knowledge is a cornerstone of speculation, and several scientific papers and books have conjectured everything from our solar system being unique to it being run-of-the-mill.  The latest toss of the coin is tails, suggesting we may be very, very alone.  Jupiter, the outlier  Theorists involved in the new study acknowledge the distinct possibility that there could be many solar systems similar to ours, as others have suggested, and that we haven't seen them because technology has yet to allow their detection. But they raise an interesting counter-argument:  All known extrasolar planets are roughly as massive as Jupiter or much more so. In studying about 100 of these, the scientists found most are similar to one another in terms of orbital characteristics, and that Jupiter is the oddball. The results are 98 percent on track by a scientific measure known as the significance level.  It follows that perhaps the known extrasolar planets formed in a different manner, one by which rocky, Earth-like planets would not be created.  "We have shown that the solar system, as represented by Jupiter, is formally not part of the distribution of observed extrasolar planetary systems," Martin Beer of the UK's University of Leicester told SPACE.com. "From this result we suggest that we may be looking at two different methods of planet formation."  Those two methods have been laid out previously by others.  How to build a planet  The leading model of planet formation -- conjured before anyone knew there were planets around other stars -- is called core accretion. A rocky core develops first, then an object either becomes a terrestrial planet (like Mercury, Venus, Earth or Mars) or it attracts huge amounts of gas and grows into something like Jupiter or Saturn.  An alternative method forms a gas giant planet via the gravitational collapse of a knot of material.  Scientists disagree which way the outer planets of our solar system were born. The core accretion model has shortcomings. For one thing, when run on a computer, Neptune and Uranus typically don't show up. Further, observations reveal that Saturn has a solid core but Jupiter does not.  The gravitational collapse model has been invoked to explain some these discrepancies. It is also appealing as a method for making the gargantuan gaseous planets found around other stars. Most are a few to several times the mass of Jupiter and orbit incredibly near to their host stars on wildly non-circular orbits.  In all but a handful of these setups, rocky inner planets are not possible because they'd be consumed by a giant or gravitationally booted out of the "habitable zone," a comfortable region that can support life, Beer explained. Earth and Mars both orbit stabily in just such a temperate area, thanks to the fact that the outer planets are far away and on nearly circular orbits.  If gravitational collapse formed the known extrasolar planets, then there's no need for rocky cores.  "Without these rocky cores, terrestrial planets (that is, Earth-like) do not form," Beer points out.  Answers soon  "More observational work is required if the solar system is to be shown to be a 'normal' planetary system," Beer said.  The truth will soon be known.  Finding giant planets takes time. Scientists monitor the gravitational wobble a planet induced on its star. To make a detection, they must monitor a star for roughly the same number of years as it takes for a planet to make an orbit. So most of the discoveries so far have involved planets that orbit in days or months. But planet hunters are beginning to find Jupiter-sized planets that take years to go around their stars (Jupiter's orbit is nearly 12 years).  (This "selection" problem can be likened to a commercial fishing boat with 5-inch holes in its net. After catching a few large ones, the fishermen determine there are no fish smaller than 5 inches in the sea.)  A firmer answer to our uniqueness will likely come around the end of this decade from NASA's space-based Kepler mission, due to launch in 2007. It is designed to detect Earth-sized planets by searching 100,000 stars for four years, looking for tiny dips in stellar brightness that would indicate an orbiting object.  Beer's team included Leicester's Andrew King, Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore and Jim Pringle of the University of Cambridge. The study will be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

        a stellar explosion in which a star may be completely disrupted, leaving a compact stellar remnant such as a neutron star or black hole. At maximum light, the supernova can have luminosity about 108 or 109 times that of the Sun. The luminosity decays after the initial outburst, in certain classes of supernova, the decline being exponential with a half-life of about 80 days. In massive stars, the supernova occurs when the star has used up all its available nuclear fuel and it reaches a lower energy state through gravitational collapse to form a more compact star. In white dwarf stars in binary systems, accretion of mass onto the surface of a neutron star can be sufficient to take the star over the upper mass limit for stability as a white dwarf and it collapses to form a neutron star resulting in a supernova explosion

        A Russian rocket successfully launched the largest telecommunications satellite ever to serve Spanish-speaking customers in Latin America - as well as North American and European markets - into space during a Tuesday evening flight. Sitting atop a Proton-M launch vehicle, the Amazonas satellite rocketed away from its staging grounds at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. "The Amazonas satellite will revolutionize communications in Brazil and across the Americas," said Mark Albrecht, president of the McLean, Virginia-based International Launch Services (ILS), which marketed the launch. The Amazonas satellite lifted off from Baikonur's Launch Pad 39 at 6:32 p.m. EDT (2232 GMT), the first step in its journey into orbit. A Breeze M upper stage was expected to deliver the spacecraft into a geosynchronous transfer orbit about nine hours and 11 minutes into the flight. Spacecraft separation was expected to occur at 3:45 a.m. EDT (0745 GMT) on Aug. 5. Amazonas was built by France's EADS Astrium for the telecommunications firm Hispamar, a Brazilian subsidiary of Hispasat in Spain. The spacecraft weighs about 10,020 pounds (4,545 kilograms) and is based on EAD's Eurostar E3000 satellite platform. Its mass, combined with satellite's 63 transponders, makes Amazonas the largest ever launched for Latin American telecommunications services. It is also the most powerful satellite in the Hispasat fleet. "Amazonas is the most important satellite for Latin America," said Hispasat chairman Luiz Perrone. During its 15-year designed lifetime, the satellite will be managed from a control center in Rio de Janeiro, he added. Amazonas carries 36 Ku-band transponders and 27 C-band transponders designed to expand Spanish-speaking telecommunications from the basic television broadcasting to include Internet, corporate communications and broadband applications. In addition to providing telecommunications services to both North and South America, Amazonas will also serve parts of Europe as well. The successful Amazonas launch marked the third Proton launch for ILS in 2004 and the seventh successful flight overall this year. The group's next launch, a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office to ride an Atlas 3AS, is slated for Aug. 27 using an Atlas 2AS rocket.

        Gamma-ray bursts are the most powerful events in the universe, temporary outshining several galaxies and likely signaling the birth of a black hole. But astronomers have been puzzled by one burst, noted in 1998, that was comparatively dim. Was the weakling a loner, a total "freak" as one astronomer termed it? Or have others like it simply gone undetected. The answer is written in this week's journal Nature, in which scientists tell of another weak gamma-ray burst. With two in the books and more expected, astronomers are now confident there is a whole range of strengths of these interesting flashes of high-energy radiation. Mysterious bursts Gamma rays are part of the electromagnetic spectrum of radiation, which includes long and lowly radio waves on one end, visible light near the middle, and X-rays toward the high end. Gamma rays are the most energetic, having the shortest wavelength. Gamma-ray bursts, also called GRBs, were first noticed in the 1960s. In just a few seconds or less, an extreme outburst can put out as much radiation as several galaxies. The bursts typically occur outside our galaxy, many billions of light-years distant. Their brevity makes them hard to study. In recent years, however,  urlLink observations  have linked gamma-ray bursts to the formation of black holes immediately after supernova events, the explosive ends to massive stars' lives. The gamma rays shoot out in two opposing jets along the rotation axis of the black hole. Only those bursts that are beamed directly at us can be seen with present technology, because gamma rays don't stray far from their beamed direction. Meanwhile, most supernovas don't emit detectable gamma rays. Instead, just an expanding ring of other radiation is noted. Closer at hand A gamma-ray burst on Dec. 3, 2003 was detected by the European-Russian Integral satellite. Other telescopes on the ground and in space examined the event's afterglow in radio, visible light and X-rays. The eruption, catalogued as GRB 031203, was relatively nearby at some 1.6 billion light-years away. Being close, it ought to have been bright. But GRB 031203 was about one-thousandth as strong as other gamma-ray bursts. Scientists are calling it a sub-energetic gamma-ray burst that resembles the 1998 event. The finding fits theoretical expectations, showing the 1998 burst "was not a freak event, and in fact there are probably many more sub-energetic GRBs like this out there," Caltech graduate student Alicia Soderberg, lead author of one paper in the journal, told SPACE.com. "The fact that they are sub-energetic makes them fainter and therefore harder to detect." That suggests there is a relationship between the strongest and weakest stellar explosions, and that there is a continuum of events in between with differing outputs, Soderberg and her colleagues say. More to find Sub-energetic gamma-ray bursts will one day outnumber their more powerful cousins once more sensitive telescopes are put on the case, the researchers believe. "This is an intriguing discovery," said Caltech Professor Shrinivas Kulkarni. "I expect a treasure trove of such events to be identified by NASA's Swift mission scheduled to be launched this fall from Cape Canaveral. I am convinced that further discoveries and studies of this new class of hybrid events will forward our understanding of the death of massive stars." Two papers on the burst are published in the Aug. 5 issue of Nature. The lead author on the other is Sergey Sazonov of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. "The idea that all GRBs spit out the same amount of gamma rays, or that they are 'standard candles' as we call them, is simply ruled out by the new data," Sazonov said.

        In a prelude of more problems that are likely to arise, both of NASA's Mars rovers experienced glitches this week as they plow through unknown engineering territory, operating well beyond what the mission blueprints called for.  The twins are working at reduced capacity while project managers try to figure out what's wrong. Both rovers had 90-day primary missions and have more than doubled that time on the surface of the red planet.  Spirit is climbing the rocky Columbia Hills of Mars, examining bedrock for signs of past water.  While executing commands on Aug. 1, a semiconductor component on Spirit failed to power on as intended, according to a NASA statement issued today. The component, a programmable gate array, directly affects usability of the rover's three spectrometer instruments, which analyze light from various targets.  Fix likely  Subsequent commands for using the miniature thermal emission spectrometer in that day's sequence resulted in repeated error messages.  The most likely cause is a timing issue of one instruction reaching the gate array microseconds before another that was intended to precede it, engineers have determined. If that diagnosis is confirmed, a repeat could possibly be avoided by inserting a delay between commands that might reproduce the problem. Until then, Spirit cannot use the miniature thermal emission spectrometer, the Moessbauer spectrometer or the alpha particle X-ray spectrometer.  "While we're being very cautious in how we operate today and tomorrow, we expect to verify the problem and resolve this issue with a relatively easy workaround," said Jim Erickson, project manager for the twin rovers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  Already, Spirit has been driving backwards on just five of its six wheels, since the right front wheel developed extra resistance in July. Managers are saving the wheel for use only when it is truly needed.  Spirit has traveled more than 2.1 miles (3.5 kilometers) since landing in January.  Opportunity  On the other side of the planet, Opportunity has driven about 66 feet (20 meters) into Endurance Crater, looking at older bedrock with each step down. The rover's odometer is nearing 1 mile (1.5 kilometers) for its entire mission.  Four times in the past two weeks, Opportunity has sent error messages while successfully taking pictures with its microscopic imager, officials said. The problem might be related to degradation of flexible cabling that runs down the rover's robotic arm to the instrument.  As a precaution, the rover team is being cautious about using the arm while they try to diagnose the problem.  "We are being very conservative about this because we certainly don't want to do anything to jeopardize the instruments," said Ken Herkenhoff of the U.S. Geological Survey Astrogeology Team, Flagstaff, Ariz. And lead scientist for both rovers' microscopic imagers. "We are running more diagnostics that we hope will identify the problem."  There are potential explanations might lead to restoring full use of the arm. But mission managers know the rovers' days are ultimately numbered.  "We will no doubt have more issues with them in the future," Erickson said. "We'll do everything we can to milk the most value out of them while they are usable, but they won't last forever."

         A dark spot marks Saturn's south pole in this new image from the Cassini spacecraft. It was taken July 13 and released yesterday.  Around the polar region, concentric rings of clouds can be seen. To the north, wavy patterns are evident, resulting from the atmosphere moving with different speeds at different latitudes. Other observations have revealed that Saturn's winds change dramatically over time, having slowed down by 40 percent over two decades.  Cassini was 3.1 million miles (5 million kilometers) from Saturn when it snapped this infrared view. Contrast has been enhanced slightly to aid visibility.  The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. It is run out of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colorado.

         Alan Buis 818/653-8339 Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. Lynn Chandler 301/286-2806Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. Gretchen Cook-Anderson 202/358-0836Headquarters, Washington NEWS RELEASE: 2004-192 August 4, 2004  Activation of the Aura spacecraft, launched July 15, is continuing, with the mission going very well so far. Just over an hour after launch, the spacecraft separated from the Boeing Delta II launch vehicle. This was followed shortly thereafter by deployment of the spacecraft's solar array and transition to Sun point mode. The next day, the spacecraft transitioned to Earth point mode, where it remained another day before transitioning to fine point mode, the mission's normal operating mode. S-band communications with the space network began immediately, followed by routine ground network contacts. X-band playbacks from the solid-state recorder to the ground network are now ongoing as well. All spacecraft subsystems have demonstrated readiness to support science operations, which cannot begin until the instruments are fully activated and Aura has reached its nominal orbit altitude. With respect to orbit altitude, four of six planned ascent burns have been completed. The fifth ascent burn is planned for Fri., August 6. The Aura ascent plan anticipates reaching a nominal altitude of 705 kilometers (about 438 miles) this month. All four instruments are powered and are systematically being activated; the following are some of the highlights that have occurred so far. The antenna launch latch for the Microwave Limb Sounder primary reflector has been released, and the receivers are undergoing characterization activities. Good output power from the Microwave Limb Sounder THz module gas laser local oscillator has been confirmed. The Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer translator has been unlatched, as has that instrument's pointing control system gimbals. The Sun-shield door for the High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder has been released. Transition of the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer, High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument to science mode is paced by their significant outgassing requirements, which last about 30 days. "From what we have seen so far, satellite performance appears very solid," said Rick Pickering, Aura project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. "Also, the performance of the entire operations team has been tremendous. Not only are all the team members inherently sharp and well-trained, many of them have extensive experience with Aqua, which is paying great dividends." Aura, a mission dedicated to the health of Earth's atmosphere, will help us understand and protect the air we breathe. Aura will help answer three key scientific questions: Is Earth's protective ozone layer recovering? What are the processes controlling air quality? How is Earth's climate changing? NASA expects early scientific data from Aura within 30 to 90 days. Each of Aura's four instruments is designed to survey different aspects of Earth's atmosphere. Aura will survey the atmosphere from the troposphere, where mankind lives, through the stratosphere, where the ozone layer resides and protects life on Earth. With the launch of Aura, the first series of NASA's Earth Observing System satellites is complete. The other satellites are Terra, which monitors land, and Aqua, which observes Earth's water cycle. The High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder was built by the United Kingdom and the United States. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., developed and manages the Microwave Limb Sounder and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument was built by the Netherlands and Finland in collaboration with NASA. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center manages the Aura mission. The Microwave Limb Sounder is intended to improve our understanding of ozone in Earth's stratosphere, which is vital in protecting us from solar ultraviolet radiation. The Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer is an infrared sensor designed to study Earth's troposphere and to look at ozone and other urban pollutants.

        .By SPACE.com Staffposted: 05 August 200402:28 pm ET   Like Voyager before it, the Cassini spacecraft has detected lighting at Saturn, but it doesn't sound the same and scientists hope the episodic strikes will teach them something. The NASA probe recorded the electrical activity on a radio receiver. "We are detecting the same crackle and pop one hears when listening to an AM radio broadcast during a thunderstorm," said Bill Kurth, deputy principal investigator on the radio and plasma wave instrument from the University of Iowa. "These storms are dramatically different than those observed 20 years ago." Voyager noted lightning from an extended storm system at low latitudes. It lasted for months and was much the same from one day to the next. Cassini found lightning that is highly episodic. There are large variations in the occurrence of lightning from day to day, sometimes with little or no lightning. There are possibly several short-lived storms at mid-latitudes behind the readings, scientists said Thursday. The root cause may be shadowy. When Voyager visited Saturn, the rings cast a very deep shadow near the planet's equator. The atmosphere in a narrow band was permanently in shadow -- making it cold -- and located right next to the hottest part of Saturn's atmosphere. Turbulence between the hot and cold regions could have led to long-lived storms, scientists speculate. Now it was summer in the southern hemisphere and the ring shadow is distributed widely over a large portion of the northern hemisphere. This causes the hottest and coldest regions to be far apart. The Cassini observations could help scientists learn something about Saturn. The planet's ionosphere, a hot, ionized layer above the atmosphere, can block low-frequency radio waves. By measuring the lowest frequencies that can be detected by Cassini, scientists can determine the density of Saturn's ionosphere. Cassini has made other findings, according to a NASA statement. The craft discovered a new radiation belt just above Saturn's cloud tops, up to the inner edge of the D-ring. The belt extends around the planet. With this discovery, the radiation belts are shown to extend far closer to the planet than previously known. "This new radiation belt had eluded detection by any of the spacecraft that previously visited Saturn," said Donald Mitchell, who works on the magnetospheric imaging instrument out of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. "With its discovery we have seen something that we did not expect, that radiation belt particles can 'hop' over obstructions like Saturn's rings, without being absorbed by the rings in the process." The spacecraft is also tasked with exploring Saturn's 31 known moons, including Titan, the largest. Cassini's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer captured Titan glowing both day and night, powered by emissions from methane and carbon monoxide gases in the moon's extensive, thick atmosphere. "Not only is Titan putting on a great light show but it is also teaching us more about its dense atmosphere," said Kevin Baines, science team member for the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "What is amazing is that the size of this glow or emission of gases is a sixth the diameter of the planet." The Sun-illuminated fluorescent glow of methane throughout Titan's upper atmosphere -- revealing the atmosphere's immense thickness and extending more than 435 miles (700 kilometers) above the surface, was expected. However, the nighttime glow, persistently shining over the night side of Titan, initially surprised scientists. "These images are as if you were seeing Titan through alien eyes," Baines said. "Titan glows throughout the near-infrared spectrum. If you were an alien it would be hard to get a good night's sleep on Titan because the light would always be on."

        TORONTO, Canada -- A second team of rocketeers competing for the $10 million Ansari X Prize, a contest for privately funded suborbital space flight, has officially announced the first launch date for its manned rocket. The da Vinci Project, led by Brian Feeney of Toronto, Ontario, said Thursday the group plans to loft its Wild Fire Mark VI spacecraft on Oct. 2, just days after the planned launch of another X Prize contender, the U.S-based SpaceShipOne. The balloon-launched Wild Fire event will be followed by a second launch within two weeks to snag the X Prize purse, according to the plan. "We want to win the X Prize, we’ve got a very good shot of winning the X Prize, we are determined to win the X Prize," Feeney said during today’s announcement at Wild Fire’s Downsview Airport hangar. "The most important thing is that we compete." Feeney’s announcement comes on the heels of a July 27 launch-timetable  urlLink announcement  by the backers of SpaceShipOne, a rocket ship built by aerospace engineer Burt Rutan and his Mojave, California firm Scaled Composites. SpaceShipOne is slated to make its X Prize flights beginning Sept. 29. "Today is a historic day," said Gregg Maryniak, executive director of the St. Louis, Missouri-based Ansari X Prize Foundation, during today's press event. "When you have one space ship, you have a test flight, when you have two, you have a horse race." X Prize contestants are required to give 60 days notice – Feeney’s team gave it three days ago -- before making their two-flight attempt in order to win the $10 million. Teams must successfully demonstrate their vehicle’s ability to launch three humans to an altitude of 62 miles (100 kilometers), return them safely, then repeat the feat within two weeks with the same spacecraft. More than 20 teams from around the world have registered for the competition. Racing SpaceShipOne The competition between SpaceShipOne and Wild Fire is fierce, especially after the much-publicized first suborbital  urlLink flight  of SpaceShipOne on June 21. That flight was not an X Prize qualifying one and da Vinci team members are confident they are still in the game. "It’s very exciting," said Doug Gellatly, a Toronto accountant who has spent two years volunteering with the da Vinci team. "I’m so looking forward to the launch." At the time of the SpaceShipOne announcement, Feeney publicly disclosed today’s rollout but acknowledged that his team was still $500,000 short of the funds needed for launch. Since then, the effort has found a new title sponsor, the online casino firm Golden Palace.com, which has pushed the effort forward. In honor of that, the da Vinci Project has been renamed the Golden Palace.com Space Program powered by the da Vinci Project. The all-volunteer da Vinci team spent about $350,000 of cash, $4 million of in-kind donations and they've put in 150,000 man-hours in pursuit of the X Prize, Feeney said. Feeney himself will pilot the first flight of his team's rocket ship, which is to be staged from above the team's launch site in Kindersley, a town in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The 8,500-pound Wild Fire spacecraft will also carry the weight of two additional people – X Prize vehicles must be able to launch three humans – as well as an eight-track tape, a laptop computer, and a ball kicked by famed soccer player David Beckham. Unlike SpaceShipOne, Wild Fire has not undergone any test flights and Feeney said he would not disclose when such shakedowns – if any – were scheduled before the Oct. 2 flight. “We do have a few drop tests scheduled,” he told SPACE.com. “We will fly.” Feeney said Wild Fire and the da Vinci team will most likely arrive at the Kindersley launch site about a week before the first space shot. It should take about three days for the two trailer trucks packed with the Wild Fire rocket, balloon and other equipment to travel from the team’s Toronto hangar to the launch site, he added. Balloon launch from Kindersley Spaceport Like SpaceShipOne, Wild Fire will launch from high above the Earth after hitching a ride with a mother ship. But where SpaceShipOne is carried under the belly of a parent airplane, Wild Fire is towed with the world’s largest reusable helium balloon. Wild Fire’s current flight plan calls for its wide balloon to fly up to an altitude of 80,000 feet (24,384 meters) with the spacecraft dangling by a cable about 750 feet below the balloon’s crew quarters. From balloon top to rocket bottom, the entire assembly measures about 1,000 feet. Once the balloon-rocket duo reaches the proper altitude, Wild Fire will ignite its engine – a hybrid rocket fueled by nitrous oxide and a “proprietary blend” of solid propellant – and launch spaceward at a target height of 71.5 miles (115 kilometers). “It is not based on rubber,” Feeney said of the special solid fuel blend. Rutan’s SpaceShipOne uses a hybrid engine powered by nitrous oxide and rubber material commonly used in tires. A laptop computer equipped with modems will be Feeney’s primary communications hub with ground crews, supported by a short wave back up system if it is needed. During reentry, the spherical 6.5-foot (2-meter) crew compartment separates from Wild Fire’s cylindrical body and both sections renter the Earth’s atmosphere, protected from the heat by a carbon-fiber thermal protection system. Parachutes are then designed to deploy for both the crew compartment and detached body, ensuring that at least 90 percent of the spacecraft returns home to be launched again two weeks later. "It’s going to be one hell of a ride," Feeney said. Meanwhile, officials in Kindersley are preparing their agricultural town – affectionately dubbed Cape Kindersley – of 5,000 residents for Wild Fire’s flight. The town’s  urlLink website  not only highlights the merits of Cape Kindersley, but also lists supposed launch times – between 5:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. to avoid high winds – and offers viewing information for both of Wild Fire’s X Prize qualifying flights. “It will take relatively bad weather to keep us on the ground,” Feeney said. Family support Feeney has spent eight years leading the da Vinci Project charge, with the backing of his family. "This is something he’s always wanted to do," Joan Feeney -- Brian’s mother – told SPACE.com. "We didn’t really quite understand it at first, but we support him." John Feeney, Brian’s father, added that both he and his wife are concerned. "But we’re parents," he said. Melissa Feeney, Brian’s 20-year-old daughter, said that while she wouldn’t necessarily be the first to stand in line for an X Prize flight, she stands behind Wild Fire, the da Vinci Project and her father. “I am so proud of him,” she said.

        HOUSTON (AP) _ The University of Texas and Texas A&M University are planning to construct what they call the world's largest telescope with the help of a Houston businessman's $1.25 million gift. Scientists say that the proposed $400 million Giant Magellan Telescope would collect 70 times more light than NASA's successful Hubble Space Telescope and could produce images that are 10 times sharper. The new scope could be placed atop the Andes Mountains in Chile as early as 2015, permitting scientists to view the earliest formation of planets and galaxies. Businessman George Mitchell donated the money to Texas A&amp;M, his alma mater. But The University of Texas in Austin, which runs the McDonald Observatory in the Davis Mountains of West Texas, has promised to match the funds over the next two years. The Carnegie Institution of Washington, Harvard University, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Arizona and the University of Michigan are also partners in the project. The founder of Mitchell Energy &amp; Development Corp. and a longtime philanthropist, Mitchell says he wants to help his alma mater. "I feel that their ability to do something in the physics department would help raise the image of the university, and I think this is a great field to be in because a lot of people are interested," Mitchell told the Houston Chronicle in Thursday's editions. "We were able to work out a joint deal (with Texas), which is kind of unusual. When we're not playing football, we're going to actually try doing something good together." The telescope's six large mirrors would surround a seventh central mirror, all on a single mounting, to be constructed in Chile. The telescope's light-collecting area would be twice the diameter of the largest current telescopes

        One of the four astronomical instruments on the Hubble Space Telescope shut down earlier this week and engineers are trying to pin down the problem. The other three instruments continue to operate normally. The instrument, called the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), does not make the classic pictures that Hubble is famous for, but instead splits light into its constituent colors. It has been used to discover dim stars that reveal clues about the age of the universe, study planet-forming environments around other stars and provide insight into black holes. The STIS stopped working Tuesday, Aug. 3, going into what officials call a suspended mode, according to a NASA statement released Friday. Mission managers think there is a malfunction in a power converter. It is not known if the glitch can be fixed. The spectrograph was installed during the second Hubble servicing mission, in 1997. It was designed to operate for five years. NASA says it has met or exceeded all its scientific requirements. NASA has convened an Anomaly Review Board to investigate the problem and determine if the instrument is recoverable. "A final decision on how to proceed is expected in the coming weeks as analysis of the problem progresses," according to the statement. The instrument is not slated for replacement by the next servicing effort. That mission, which NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe cancelled in January due to safety concerns for the space shuttle fleet, is up in the air right now. O'Keefe reconsidered his decision and said a robotic mission might be undertaken, though he continues to resist  urlLink expert suggestions  that a manned shuttle mission to service the telescope remain a serious option. Hubble's other instruments -- the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), the Advanced Camera for Surveys, and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera 2 -- are not affected by the problem. The STIS is used for about 30 percent of Hubble's observing time. A standby list of targets for the other three instruments will likely take up that time. Hubble has otherwise been in good health. But its batteries and pointing gyroscopes are expected to fail in the next two to three years. If they are not replaced by a robotic or human servicing mission, Hubble will likely cease operations by 2008, engineers  urlLink have concluded . more:  urlLink www.hubblesite.org   urlLink www.space.com

       in "Endurance Crater" opportunity   As NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity creeps farther into "Endurance Crater," the dune field on the crater floor appears even more dramatic. This false-color image taken by the rover's panoramic camera shows that the dune crests have accumulated more dust than the flanks of the dunes and the flat surfaces between them. Also evident is a "blue" tint on the flat surfaces as compared to the dune flanks. This results from the presence of the hematite-containing spherules ("blueberries") that accumulate on the flat surfaces.  Sinuous tendrils of sand less than 1 meter (3.3 feet) high extend from the main dune field toward the rover. Scientists hope to send the rover down to one of these tendrils in an effort to learn more about the characteristics of the dunes. Dunes are a common feature across the surface of Mars, and knowledge gleaned from investigating the Endurance dunes close-up may apply to similar dunes elsewhere.  Before the rover heads down to the dunes, rover drivers must first establish whether the slippery slope that leads to them is firm enough to ensure a successful drive back out of the crater. Otherwise, such hazards might make the dune field a true sand trap.  AND SPRIT  IN COLOMBIA

        urlLink   NASA researchers have teamed up with a pair of Silicon Valley firms to build a supercomputer that ranks alongside the world's largest Linux-based systems. When complete, the Space Exploration Simulator supercomputer will provide 10 times the data-crunching power of NASA's current supercomputer capacity. "Our space scientists in the past were starved for [computer] cycles," said Walter Brooks, chief of the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) division. "Sometimes people would submit an idea and it would take weeks to get an answer." Brooks told SPACE.com the new system will allow scientists to run complicated computer models, such as those used for research into planetary formation or solar physics, alongside the meticulous space shuttle engineering studies critical for NASA's return to flight. NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California -- home to NAS -- is developing the new supercomputing system as part of its collaborative Project Columbia with the aid of Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) and the Intel Corp. in the Silicon Valley. Plans call for a network of 20 powerful SGI Altix computers, each with 512-processor systems, equipped with 500 terabytes of local data storage. Once the computers are linked, their 10,240 Intel Itanium 2 processors will power the Space Exploration Simulator over a wide range of studies, including space shuttle modeling, climate change, mission safety and aeronautics. "This will enable NASA to meet its immediate mission-critical requirements for return to flight, while building a strong foundation for our space exploration vision and future missions," NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe said in a statement. During the Columbia investigation, engineering and shuttle computer models took up most of NASA's supercomputing capacity, leaving Earth and space science studies by the wayside. With the new system, a single computer node can handle the return to flight shuttle modeling requirements, opening the rest for scientific research. The space agency also plans to allow the public science and engineering communities access to a portion of the Space Exploration Simulator for their own studies. Ames and SGI researchers already had one 512-processor Linux computer -- built last year -- named Kalpana in honor of astronaut Kalpana Chawla who died with her fellow crewmates in the Columbia accident. A second machine has been linked to it, with the remaining 18 expected to follow over the next three months. Since the Space Exploration Simulator relies on off-the-shelf technology, researchers can upgrade the system as more advanced computer chips and processors become available. Those internal upgrades are key, since the 20-computer system has consumed the available space at Ames. "NASA, 20 years ago, led the way in computing," Brooks said. "When you're building the world's most complex vehicle, tackling hard problems like debris and crew escape…we need that kind of computing ability."    urlLink    by  urlLink www.space.com

       CASSINI PHOTO RELEASE Posted: August 16, 2004  With eyes sharper than any that have peered at Saturn before, the Cassini spacecraft has uncovered two moons, which may be the smallest bodies so far seen around the ringed planet.   This image shows the tiny 'worldlet,' temporarily dubbed S/2004 S1, as it makes its way around the planet. A white box frames the moon's location in the image. Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute  The moons are approximately 3 kilometers (2 miles) and 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) across -- smaller than the city of Boulder, Colorado. The moons, located 194,000 kilometers (120,000 miles) and 211,000 kilometers (131,000 miles) from the planet's center, are between the orbits of two other saturnian moons, Mimas and Enceladus. They are provisionally named S/2004 S1 and S/2004 S2. One of them, S/2004 S1, may be an object spotted in a single image taken by NASA's Voyager spacecraft 23 years ago, called at that time S/1981 S14.  "One of our major objectives in returning to Saturn was to survey the entire system for new bodies," said Dr. Carolyn Porco, imaging team leader, Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo. Porco planned the imaging sequences. "So, it's really gratifying to know that among all the other fantastic discoveries we will make over the next four years, we can now add the confirmation of two new moons, skipping unnoticed around Saturn for billions of years until just now.²  The moons were first seen by Dr. Sebastien Charnoz, a planetary dynamicist working with Dr. Andre Brahic, imaging team member at the University of Paris. "Discovering these faint satellites was an exciting experience, especially the feeling of being the first person to see a new body of our solar system," said Charnoz. "I had looked for such objects for weeks while at my office in Paris, but it was only once on holiday, using my laptop, that my code eventually detected them. This tells me I should take more holidays."  The smallest previously known moons around Saturn are about 20 kilometers (12 miles) across. Scientists expected that moons as small as S/2004 S1 and S/2004 S2 might be found within gaps in the rings and perhaps near the F ring, so they were surprised these small bodies are between two major moons. Small comets careening around the outer solar system would be expected to collide with small moons and break them to bits.     This shows the second new 'worldlet,' temporarily dubbed S/2004 S2. Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute   The fact that these moons exist where they do might provide limits on the number of small comets in the outer solar system, a quantity essential for understanding the Kuiper Belt of comets beyond Neptune, and the cratering histories of the moons of the giant planets.  "A comet striking an inner moon of Saturn moves many times faster than a speeding bullet," said Dr. Luke Dones, an imaging team member from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. "If small, house-sized comets are common, these moons should have been blown apart many times by cometary impacts during the history of the solar system. The disrupted moon would form a ring, and then most of the material would eventually gather back together into a moon. However, if small comets are rare, as they seem to be in the Jupiter system, the new moons might have survived since the early days of the solar system."  Moons surrounding the giant planets generally are not found where they originally formed because tidal forces from the planet can cause them to drift from their original locations. In drifting, they may sweep through locations where other moons disturb them, making their orbits eccentric or inclined relative to the planet's equator. One of the new moons might have undergone such an evolution.  Upcoming imaging sequences will scour the gaps in Saturn's rings in search of moons believed to be there. Meanwhile, Cassini scientists are eager to get a closer look, if at all possible, at their new finds. Porco said, "We are at this very moment looking to see what the best times are for retargeting. Hopefully, we haven't seen the last of them."  The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.

          EUROPEAN SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY NEWS RELEASE  Posted: August 17, 2004    Observations by an international team of astronomers with the UVES spectrometer on ESO's Very Large Telescope at the Paranal Observatory have thrown new light on the earliest epoch of the Milky Way galaxy.         This ESO image shows the globular cluster NGC 6397, located at a distance of approx. 7,200 light-years in the southern constellation Ara. It has undergone a "core collapse" and the central area is very dense. Credit: ESO        The first-ever measurement of the Beryllium content in two stars in a globular cluster (NGC 6397) - pushing current astronomical technology towards the limit - has made it possible to study the early phase between the formation of the first generation of stars in the Milky Way and that of this stellar cluster. This time interval was found to amount to 200 - 300 million years.  The age of the stars in NGC 6397, as determined by means of stellar evolution models, is 13,400 +/- 800 million years. Adding the two time intervals gives the age of the Milky Way, 13,600 +/- 800 million years.  The currently best estimate of the age of the Universe, as deduced, e.g., from measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background, is 13,700 million years. The new observations thus indicate that the first generation of stars in the Milky Way galaxy formed soon after the end of the ~200 million-year long "Dark Ages" that succeeded the Big Bang.   The age of the Milky Way   How old is the Milky Way ? When did the first stars in our galaxy ignite ?  A proper understanding of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way system is crucial for our knowledge of the Universe. Nevertheless, the related observations are among the most difficult ones, even with the most powerful telescopes available, as they involve a detailed study of old, remote and mostly faint celestial objects.   Globular clusters and the ages of stars   Modern astrophysics is capable of measuring the ages of certain stars, that is the time elapsed since they were formed by condensation in huge interstellar clouds of gas and dust. Some stars are very "young" in astronomical terms, just a few million years old like those in the nearby Orion Nebula. The Sun and its planetary system was formed about 4,560 million years ago, but many other stars formed much earlier. Some of the oldest stars in the Milky Way are found in large stellar clusters, in particular in "globular clusters", so called because of their spheroidal shape.  Stars belonging to a globular cluster were born together, from the same cloud and at the same time. Since stars of different masses evolve at different rates, it is possible to measure the age of globular clusters with a reasonably good accuracy. The oldest ones are found to be more than 13,000 million years old.  Still, those cluster stars were not the first stars to be formed in the Milky Way. We know this, because they contain small amounts of certain chemical elements which must have been synthesized in an earlier generation of massive stars that exploded as supernovae after a short and energetic life. The processed material was deposited in the clouds from which the next generations of stars were made.  Despite intensive searches, it has until now not been possible to find less massive stars of this first generation that might still be shining today. Hence, we do not know when these first stars were formed. For the time being, we can only say that the Milky Way must be older than the oldest globular cluster stars.  But how much older?   Beryllium to the rescue   What astrophysicists would like to have is therefore a method to measure the time interval between the formation of the first stars in the Milky Way (of which many quickly became supernovae) and the moment when the stars in a globular cluster of known age were formed. The sum of this time interval and the age of those stars would then be the age of the Milky Way.  New observations with the VLT at ESO's Paranal Observatory have now produced a break-through in this direction. The magic element is "Beryllium"!  Beryllium is one of the lightest elements - the nucleus of the most common and stable isotope (Beryllium-9) consists of four protons and five neutrons. Only hydrogen, helium and lithium are lighter. But while those three were produced during the Big Bang, and while most of the heavier elements were produced later in the interior of stars, Beryllium-9 can only be produced by "cosmic spallation". That is, by fragmentation of fast-moving heavier nuclei - originating in the mentioned supernovae explosions and referred to as energetic "galactic cosmic rays" - when they collide with light nuclei (mostly protons and alpha particles, i.e. hydrogen and helium nuclei) in the interstellar medium.   Galactic cosmic rays and the Beryllium clock   The galactic cosmic rays travelled all over the early Milky Way, guided by the cosmic magnetic field. The resulting production of Beryllium was quite uniform within the galaxy. The amount of Beryllium increased with time and this is why it might act as a "cosmic clock".  The longer the time that passed between the formation of the first stars (or, more correctly, their quick demise in supernovae explosions) and the formation of the globular cluster stars, the higher was the Beryllium content in the interstellar medium from which they were formed. Thus, assuming that this Beryllium is preserved in the stellar atmosphere, the more Beryllium is found in such a star, the longer is the time interval between the formation of the first stars and of this star.  The Beryllium may therefore provide us with unique and crucial information about the duration of the early stages of the Milky Way.   A very difficult observation   So far, so good. The theoretical foundations for this dating method were developed during the past three decades and all what is needed is then to measure the Beryllium content in some globular cluster stars.  But this is not as simple as it sounds! The main problem is that Beryllium is destroyed at temperatures above a few million degrees. When a star evolves towards the luminous giant phase, violent motion (convection) sets in, the gas in the upper stellar atmosphere gets into contact with the hot interior gas in which all Beryllium has been destroyed and the initial Beryllium content in the stellar atmosphere is thus significantly diluted. To use the Beryllium clock, it is therefore necessary to measure the content of this element in less massive, less evolved stars in the globular cluster. And these so-called "turn-off (TO) stars" are intrinsically faint.  In fact, the technical problem to overcome is three-fold: First, all globular clusters are quite far away and as the stars to be measured are intrinsically faint, they appear quite faint in the sky. Even in NGC6397, the second closest globular cluster, the TO stars have a visual magnitude of ~16, or 10000 times fainter than the faintest star visible to the unaided eye. Secondly, there are only two Beryllium signatures (spectral lines) visible in the stellar spectrum and as these old stars do contain comparatively little Beryllium, those lines are very weak, especially when compared to neighbouring spectral lines from other elements. And third, the two Beryllium lines are situated in a little explored spectral region at wavelength 313 nm, i.e., in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum that is strongly affected by absorption in the terrestrial atmosphere near the cut-off at 300 nm, below which observations from the ground are no longer possible.  It is thus no wonder that such observations had never been made before, the technical difficulties were simply unsurmountable.   VLT and UVES do the job   Using the high-performance UVES spectrometer on the 8.2-m Kuyen telescope of ESO's Very Large Telescope at the Paranal Observatory (Chile) which is particularly sensitive to ultraviolet light, a team of ESO and Italian astronomers succeeded in obtaining the first reliable measurements of the Beryllium content in two TO-stars (denoted "A0228" and "A2111") in the globular cluster NGC 6397. Located at a distance of about 7,200 light-years in the direction of a rich stellar field in the southern constellation Ara, it is one of the two nearest stellar clusters of this type; the other is Messier 4.  The observations were done during several nights in the course of 2003. Totalling more than 10 hours of exposure on each of the 16th-magnitude stars, they pushed the VLT and UVES towards the technical limit. Reflecting on the technological progress, the leader of the team, ESO-astronomer Luca Pasquini, is elated: "Just a few years ago, any observation like this would have been impossible and just remained an astronomer's dream!"  The resulting spectra of the faint stars show the weak signatures of Beryllium ions (Be II). Comparing the observed spectrum with a series of synthetic spectra with different Beryllium content (in astrophysics: "abundance") allowed the astronomers to find the best fit and thus to measure the very small amount of Beryllium in these stars: for each Beryllium atom there are about 2,224,000,000,000 hydrogen atoms.  Beryllium lines are also seen in another star of the same type as these stars, HD 218052. However, it is not a member of a cluster and its age is by far not as well known as that of the cluster stars. Its Beryllium content is quite similar to that of the cluster stars, indicating that this field star was born at about the same time as the cluster.   From the Big Bang until now   According to the best current spallation theories, the measured amount of Beryllium must have accumulated in the course of 200 - 300 million years. Italian astronomer Daniele Galli, another member of the team, does the calculation: "So now we know that the age of the Milky Way is this much more than the age of that globular cluster - our galaxy must therefore be 13,600 +- 800 million years old. This is the first time we have obtained an independent determination of this fundamental value!".  Within the given uncertainties, this number also fits very well with the current estimate of the age of the Universe, 13,700 million years, that is the time elapsed since the Big Bang. It thus appears that the first generation of stars in the Milky Way galaxy was formed at about the time the "Dark Ages" ended, now believed to be some 200 million years after the Big Bang.  It would seem that the system in which we live may indeed be one of the "founding" members of the galaxy population in the Universe  index from: spaceflightnow.com   urlLink http://http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0408/17milkyway/

         In a dramatic ending that marks a beginning in scientific research, NASA's Genesis spacecraft is set to swing by Earth and jettison a sample return capsule filled with particles of the Sun that may ultimately tell us more about the genesis of our solar system. "The Genesis mission -- to capture a piece of the Sun and return it to Earth -- is truly in the NASA spirit: a bold, inspiring mission that makes a fundamental contribution to scientific knowledge," said Steven Brody, NASA's program executive for the Genesis mission, NASA Headquarters, Washington. On September 8, 2004, the drama will unfold over the skies of central Utah when the spacecraft's sample return capsule will be snagged in midair by helicopter. The rendezvous will occur at the Air Force's Utah Test and Training Range, southwest of Salt Lake City. "What a prize Genesis will be," said Genesis Principal Investigator Dr. Don Burnett of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif. "Our spacecraft has logged almost 27 months far beyond the moon's orbit, collecting atoms from the Sun. With it, we should be able to say what the Sun is composed of, at a level of precision for planetary science purposes that has never been seen before." The prizes Burnett and company are waiting for are hexagonal wafers of pure silicon, gold, sapphire, diamond and other materials that have served as a celestial prison for their samples of solar wind particles. These wafers have weathered 26-plus months in deep space and are now safely stowed in the return capsule. If the capsule were to descend all the way to the ground, some might fracture or break away from their mountings; hence, the midair retrieval by helicopter, with crew members including some who have performed helicopter stunt work for Hollywood. "These guys fly in some of Hollywood's biggest movies," said Don Sweetnam, Genesis project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. "But this time, the Genesis capsule will be the star." The Genesis capsule -- carrying the agency's first sample return since the final Apollo lunar mission in 1972, and the first material collected beyond the Moon -- will enter Earth's atmosphere at 9:55 am Mountain Time. Two minutes and seven seconds after atmospheric entry, while still flying supersonically, the capsule will deploy a drogue parachute at 33 kilometers (108,000 feet) altitude. Six minutes after that, the main parachute, a parafoil, will deploy 6.1 kilometers (20,000 feet) up. Waiting below will be two helicopters and their flight crews looking for their chance to grab a piece of the Sun. "Each helicopter will carry a crew of three," said Roy Haggard, chief executive officer of Vertigo Inc. and director of flight operations for the lead helicopter. "The lead helicopter will deploy an eighteen-and-a-half foot long pole with what you could best describe as an oversized, Space-Age fishing hook on its end. When we make the approach we want the helicopter skids to be about eight feet above the top of the parafoil. If for some reason the capture is not successful, the second helicopter is 1,000 feet behind us and setting up for its approach. We estimate we will have five opportunities to achieve capture." The helicopter that does achieve capture will carry the sample canister to a clean room at the Michael Army Air Field at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground, where scientists await their cosmic prize. The samples will then be moved to a special laboratory at NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, where they will be preserved and studied by scientists for many years to come. "I understand much of the interest is in how we retrieve Genesis," added Burnett. "But to me the excitement really begins when scientists from around the world get hold of those samples for their research. That will be something." JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology, manages the Genesis mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver, developed and operates the spacecraft. Los Alamos National Laboratory and NASA's Johnson Space Center contributed to Genesis payload development, and the Johnson Space Center will curate the sample and support analysis and sample allocation.

       Future Mission Concepts May Become Reality 08.12.04   NASA is considering nine astrophysics experiments that could pave the way toward future space missions designed to reveal the nature of the universe and how life was formed. The candidates are mission hopefuls for becoming part of NASA's Astronomical Search for Origins Program. Operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., the Origins Program seeks to answer the basic questions regarding our universe and the origin of life. Selected from a pool of 26 proposals, the concept finalists offer an array of experiments and methods for studying astronomical objects and their chemical composition. Researchers now have eight months to refine their projects to outline mission objectives and possible spacecraft design. Image to right: Scientists want to know more about the soupy mix of free-floating organic compounds that led to life in the universe. Credit: NASA Many of the projects plan to investigate the universe as it exists today, while others will use their technology to peer back in time to examine the cosmic past. One such instrument could be the Hubble Origins Probe. With its powerful sensors and camera, the Hubble Origins Probe concept proposes the construction of a highly-advanced space-based telescope. The Probe would use instruments originally designed for the Hubble Space Telescope to analyze the birth of individual stars, planets and black holes that formed millions of year ago. One a broader scale, the Baryonic Structure Probe intends to detect and map the flow of chemical matter into early galaxies. Understanding the path of these galactic chemical currents would give scientists tremendous insight into the twisting and churning mechanics of the universe. Many scientists believe the universe is expanding outward from a central point and occupying more and more space. The Cosmic Inflation Probe aims to measure the shape of the universe's expansion by locating galaxies that formed early in history. The immediate location of the galaxies would be compared with their beginning position and used to define the shape of their expansion.     Image to left: Deep space research missions like the Hubble Space Telescope have shown us a universe we previously only dreamed existed. Future missions will extend our reach into the cosmos and allow us to discover the principles and mechanisms for the development of galaxies, planets and life. Credit: NASA Focusing on more than just the past, scientists are also devising ways to scan the present cosmos. The Origins Billion Star Survey mission intends to count all of the larger planets in the Milky Way, as well as the stars within 30,000 light years of the Sun. Looking to understand the building blocks of life, the Astrobiology Space InfraRed Explorer observatory will search for organic materials in space and attempt to identify how they enter a planet's environment. Time will tell which designs make it from the drawing board to the launch pad. Whatever the results, individually or collectively, any of one of these missions may show us the universe of yesterday, how it exists today, or where it might be tomorrow.

            بارش شهابی برساووشی ۲۷ تير هر سال همزمان با برخورد زمين با توده ذرات برساووشی فعال می شود و تعداد شهابهای آن به تدريج افزايش می يابد تا در حوالی۲۲ مرداد به اوج خود می رسد در اين هنگام زير آسمان تاريک می توان شاهد ۴۰-۶۰شهاب در ساعت بود. پس از آن تعداد شهابهای برساوشی به تدريج کاهش می يابد تا اينکه در ۳ شهريور با خروج زمين فعاليت آن به پايان می رسد. اما محاسبات Esko Lyytinen (محقق فنلاندی) نشان می دهد که اختلالات گرانشی سياره مشتری باعث می شود که امسـال شهابواره های برساوشی ۰/۰۱ واحد نجومی به خورشيد نزديکتر شوند در نتيجه زمين از بخش چگال تر توده ذرات عبور می کند. او پيش بينی می کند که بارش ساليانه امسال از حالت عادی خود پر تعدادتر باشد. زمان اوج آن ساعت ۱۵:۳۰ (به وقت رسمی ايران) ۲۲ مرداد محاسبه شده است. حتی تعدادی از محققين با توجه به دوره تناوب ۱۲ ساله سياره مشتری برای افزايش فعاليت بارش برساووشی دوره ۱۲ سال را در نظر می گيرند. رصدهای دهه های گذشته تا حدودی اين مطلب را نشان می دهند ولی به هر حال اين مطلبی است که رصدها بايد آن را تاييد کنند. اما ويژگی امسال بارش برساووشی فقط در همين خلاصه نمی شود. محاسبات Lyytinen نشان می دهد که علاوه براين امسال زمين از فاصله ۰/۰۰۱۳واحد نجومی رشته ای از شهابواره های برساووشی عبور می کند. اين رشته ذرات از عبور سال ۱۸۶۲ دنباله دار سويفت-تاتل به جا مانده اند. او زمان برخورد زمين با مرکز رشته را ساعت۲۰:۵۴زمان جهانی (حدود ۱:۳۰ بامداد ۲۲ مرداد) محاسبه کرد. محاسبات Vaubaillon( از رصدخانه پاريس) و Sergey Shanov (محقق روسی) نيز اين گفته را تاييد کرد.پيش يينی مقدار ZHR کار مشکلی است. دوره تناوب دنباله دار سويفت-تاتل بيش از دوره دنباله دار تمپل-تاتل(منشاء بارش اسدی)است بنابراين شناخت ما از اين دنباله دارکمتر است و اين عامل باعث می شود پيش بينی ZHR برای بارش برساووشی امسال مشکل تر از پيش بينی بارش اسدی باشد.به عقيده Lyytinen اگر مکانيسم خروج ذرات از دنباله دار سويفت-تاتل مانند تمپل-تاتل باشد آنگاه برای اين برخورد ZHR حدود ۱۰۰ پيش بينی می شود ولی هسته دنباله دار سويفت-تاتل حدود۸ برابر بزرگتر است و اين عامل می تواند باعث افزايش ZHR حتی تا حدود ۱۰۰۰ شود ولی اين ذرات بسيار کم جرم خواهند بود. بنابراين افزايش تعداد شهابها در زمان ياد شده محتمل است ولی اکثر اين شهابها نسبتا" کم نور(قدر۳-۴) خواهند بود. بر عکس اوج ساليانه ، مدت زمان برخورد زمين با اين رشته ذرات فقط۴۰ دقيقه محاسبه شده است.  آماده رصد هر چند که بارش برساووشی در ۲۱-۲۲ مرداد به اوج می رسد ولی اين بارش بيش از يک ماه فعال است و اين امکان ايجاد می شود در شبهای تابستان رصد آن در برنامه کاری گروههای نجومی قرار گيرد. چند روز قبل و بعد از اوج بارش برساووشی نيز تعداد شهابها قابل توجه هستند بنابراين می توان از ۱۷ مرداد رصدها را شروع کرد. رصد اين بارش را می توان از ساعت۱۱ شب شروع کرد.البته بهترين زمان بعد از نيمه شب و قبل از سحراست که در آن وقت ارتفاع کانون بارش زياد می شود. شهابواره های برساووشی با سرعت حدود ۶۰ کيلومتر بر ثانيه وارد جو می شوند و شهابهای سريعی محسوب می شوند. در شبهای اوج ،بعد و ميل کانون به ترتيب ۴۶ و ۵۸+ است. برای رصد اوج تيز بارش (ساعت ۱:۳۰بامداد ۲۲ مرداد) بهترين منطقه اروپا و غرب آسيا است. بنابراين برای رصدگران ايرانی فرصت خوبی فراهم خواهد شد. خوشبختانه امسال نور ماه هم چندان مزاحم رصد نيست.

           تحليل جو تيتان از روي تصويري که کاسيني در نخستين پروازش از نزديکي تيتان به زمين ارسال کرد. بزگترين قمر زحل يعني تيتان که با گازهاي ارغواني رنگ استراتوسفر خود احاطه شده است هدف فضاپيماي کاسيني در تصوير برداري روز سوم تير بود. عکس پايين درست يک روز بعد از اولين گذر نزديک کاسيني از کنار اين قمر تهيه شده است. تيتان داراي جوي چگال است که به صورت عمده از نيتروژن و درصد کمي متان تشکيل شده است. از اين رو فرآيندهاي شمييايي گوناگوني در آن رخ مي دهد.  urlLink    عکس هايي مانند اين کليد فهم مراحل تبديل وچرخه گازهاي جو تيتان اند. تصور مي شود که اين چرخه در لايه هاي بالايي جو تيتان آغاز مي شود. يعني ارتفاعي در حدود ۴۰۰ کيلومتري از سطح آن که تابش فرا بنفش مولکولهاي متان و نيتروژن اين بخش جو را تجزيه مي کند. دانشمندان بر اين باورند که محصول اين تجزيه، دوباره با مواد ديگري واکنش مي دهد تا مولکولهاي آلي پيچيده اي را که حاوي کربن، نيتروژن و هيدروژن هستند تشکيل دهند. اين مواد همان ذرات بسيار ريزي هستند که مواد مه آلود جو تيتان را تشکيل مي دهند . اين تصوير فرا بنفش از تيتان به صورت مجازي رنگ آميزي شده است. در تصوير اصلي بدنه تيتان به رنگ نارنجي کمرنگ ديده مي شود. در بالاي صفحه نارنجي رنگ تيتان دو لايه درخشان و مه آلود جو قابل تشخيص اند که به رنگ ارغواني رنگ آميزي شده اند تا واضح تر ديده شوند. البته هنوز کاملا مشخص نيست که چرا اين بخش مه آلود جو تيتان به دو قسمت جدا از هم ديده مي شود. اميد است که اين سؤال و پرسشهاي ديگر از اين نوع در مدت چهار سال مأموريت کاسيني پاسخ داده شوند. طبق برنامه ريزي انجام شده در اين مدت کاسيني چندين بار ديگر از نزديکي تيتان عبور خواهد کرد. کاسيني هنگام عبور بعدي اش از نزديکي تيتان در اکتبر ۲۰۰۴ (پاييز امسال)، ۳۰ بار نزديکتر از دوم تير خواهد بود. مأموريت کاسيني-هويگنس پروژه اي گروهي است که در آن ناسا با آژانس فضايي اروپا و آژانس فضايي ايتاليا مشارکت دارد. آزمايشگاه پيشران موشکي ناسا که بخشي از سازمان تکنولوژي کاليفورنيا در پاسادناست کار مديريت مأموريت کاسيني-هويگنس را براي بخش مطالعات فضايي ناسا در واشنگتن به انجام مي رساند. مدار گرد کاسيني و دو دوربين متصل به آن در خود سازمان JPL طراحي و ساخته شده اند. گروه تصويربرداري نيز در سازمان مطالعات فضايي واقع در بولدر در کلورادو مستقر هستند. تصويرهاي اين تيم تصوير برداري در سايت رسمي آنها که در زير آمده است قابل دسترس است.  urlLink http://ciclops.org/  همچنين مي توانيد اطلاعات و تصويرهاي مورد نياز خود در مورد مأموريت کاسيني-هويگنس را با ملاقات سايتهاي زير به دست آوريد

         مسائل نجوم وستارگان را مي توان از اولين موضوعاتي دانست كه بشر كنجكاو وحقيقت جو را در سكوت وتنهائي شب به ديدن خود دعوت كرده است.در اين ميانه مسائلي را كه نمي توانستند درك كنند با خرافه ها مخلوط كردند والبته دانشمندان زيادي از ايرانيان (به گواه تاريخ )در نفي ويا رد اين مسائل تلا ش  بسياري كرده اند.همين بس كه مي توان ايران را يكي از خاستگاههاي اين علم در جهان چه قبل يا بعد از اسلام دانست، بالا ترين تبلور اين علم رادر ايران ميتوان بعد از اسلام در فرهنگ ايران خاصه در اشعار فرهيختگان ايراني ديد  . بطوريكه از بررسي اين آثار ميتوان ديد كه اين دانشمندان وشاعران ،  عليرغم  پذيرش  بي چون وچراي  بعضي خرافه ها به وضوح يا تلويحاً سعي در اصلاح اين تفكر داشته اند كه از اين افراد مي توان به :  ابوريحان بيروني ، خواجه نصير الدين طوسي ،ابوبكر محمد ابن ذكرياي رازي،وشاعراني چون حافظ ، سعدي وسنائي ، خاقاني ، نظامي و ...اشاره كرد،از اين بين حافظ بر خي از تجليات و افكار نجومي را بيشتر در آثار خود به كار برده كه نشان ميدهد اين دانشمند فرزانه علاوه بر علم كتاب و شعر در هيئت نيز دستي توانا داشته است كه از آثار اين شاعر نوانا نمونه هائي را به اختصار نام مي بريم:  1- در رد يا نفي اختر گوئي كه در بين عامه جايگاه خاصي پيدا كرده بود وبعضي از دانشمندان نيز ناخواسته براي گذران امور به اين مسائل دامن زده اند.            از چشم خود بپرس كه مارا كه مي كُشد             جانا گناه طالع وجرم ستاره نيست                                   بگير طره مه چهراي وقصه مخوان                   كه سعد ونحس زتاثير زهره و زحل است 2- ارنفاع گرفتن خورشيد كه نشان از اقبال بلند بوده و با اسطرلاب انجام مي شده.              ز آفتاب قدح ارتفاع عيش مگير                 چرا كه طالع وقت آنچنان نمي بينم   نام برده مي شود.Pole star-كوكب هدايت كه به احتمال قريب به يقين همان ستاره قطبي يا   3                در اين شب سياهم گم گشت راه مقصود         از گوشه اي برون آي اي كوكب هدايت 4 - مقارنه ي ماه ومشتري كه تصور ميشد اگر در اقبال كسي اين رويداد باشد داراي  بهترين موقعييت در آسمان ورمل و اسطرلاب باشد.          گفتم كه خواجه كي به سر حجله مي رود؟        گفت آن زمان كه مشتري و مه قران كنند   5 - ستارههاي هفت گانه يا خوشه پروين كه در گذشته به آن عقد ثريا هم مي گفتند                  غزل گفتي و‌در سفتي بيا وخوش بخوان حافظ            كه بر نظم تو افشاندفلك عقد ثريارا  6- در زمان حياط حافظ رويداد نجومي ويژه اي روي داد كه آن را در شعري گنجانده كه مشتري در صورت فلكي قوس و خورشيد در اسد واقع شده بوده.             به آهوان نظر،شير آفتاب گير                            به ابروان دوتا قوس مشتري بشكن  7- در قديم مرسوم بوده براي ثبت رويدادهاي ويژه،  مكان خورشيد  و ستاره ها  را  در صور هفت گانه ثبت مي كردند ويا سال آن را با حروف ابجد رمز مي كردند كه حافظ هم در گذشت خواجه قوام الدين را كه خورشيد در جوزا وماه در سنبله يا خوشه  بوده در شعر آورده است0                  هفتصدوپنجاه از هجرت خير البشر                    مهر را جوزا مكان و ماه را خوشه وطن  8-  ماه و سياره زهره در سحر گاهان با نور توصيف ناپذيرش نظر هر سحر خيز دلسوخته را چنان مجذوب خود مي كند كه اشك عبادت و ديدن آنها از نظر حافظ بهترين شاهد عبادت هستند.            زجور كوكب طالع سحر گهان چشمم               چنان گريست كه ناهيد ديد ومه دانست 9-  مكان ماه در هر يك دور ماهانه را كه بيست وهشت روز است ودر هر روز در همان ساعت   در مكان خاصي ديده مي شود منازل ماه ميگويند ومنازل خورشيد هم همان دوازده ماه است كه در   شعر گفته شده خداوند اينها را دائما به منزل ميرساند.            ماه وخورشيد به منزل چو به امر تو رسند      يار مه روي مرا نيز به من باز رسان   10-  در صورت فلكي دب اكبر ستاره اي است بنام عناًق كه در كنار آن ستاره كم نوري بنام ُسها وجود دارد كه در قديم شكارچيان براي امتحان ميزان تيز بيني خود از آن استفاده مي كردند كه حافظ كم نوري آن رادربرابر با ستاره" شهاب  ثاقب" مانند ما وخدا  مي داند.               ز رقيب ديو سيرت به خداي پناه خواهم        مگر آن شهاب ثاقب مددي كند ُسها را       مثالهاونمونه هاي ديگري نيز در اشعار حافظ از اصطلاحات  نجومي واسامي صور وستارگان بكار گرفته شده كه از آنها مي توان به:  كهكشان، اسد، شهباز ، سنبله ، سماك رامح ، شلياق ، دوپيكريا جبار ، نسر طاير ، ُزحل ، مشتري  زهره ،  ماه وآفتاب و .....:كه استفاده از آنها كاملا به دور از خرافه هاو با استفاده از اصطلاحات صحيح نجومي وكاملا درست وصحيح بكار گرفته شده اند كه نشان از جايگاه اين علم در بين ايرانيان وفرهنگ آنها دارد.

         دانشمندان موفق به استفاده از ابرهاي گازي به عنوان تلسكوپي عظيم شده اند. اخترشناسان روشي را يافته اند كه به كمك آن مي توانند با به دام انداختن ابرهاي گازي در فضا از آن براي ساخت تلسكوپي غول پيكر بهره گيرند.تلسكوپي قوي تر از هر تلسكوپ ديگري كه تا كنون توسط بشر سلاخته شده است.با كمك اين ابزار ، اخترشناسان مي توانند نگاهي دقيق به حاشيه سياهچاله ها بياندازند. جايي كه تا كنون از تير راس رصدهاي اخترشناسان پنهان مانده است. اين روش بسيار جذاب در مقاله اي كه گروهي از محققان موسسه CSIRO (مركز مطالعات استراليا) ، دانشگاه آدلايد و موسسه اي پژوهشي در هلند به چاپ رسانده اند مورد بررسي قرار گرفته است.اين مقاله براساس كارهاي رصدي انجام شده هيلي بيگنال ،است .وي دانشجوي دوره دكتري بوده و هم اكنون با VLBI همكاري مي كند.رصدهاي وي با كمك آرايه تلسكوپهاي راديويي استرالياCSIRO در شرق استراليا به انجام رسيده است. با كمك تكنيك جديد ارايه شده اخترشناسان قادر خواهند بود جزيياتي در حدود 10 ميكر ثانيه قوس را تفكيك كنند.اين قدرت تفكيك عظيم معادل آن است كه از روي زمين يك حبه قند را برروي سطح ماه آشكار كنيم.اين توانايي خيره كننده كه تقريبا 10 هزار برابر بيش از توانايي تلسكوپ فضايي هابل است ، دانشمندان را قادر مي سازد تا جزيياتي تا 100 برابر از كم سوترين اجرام عالم را آشكار كنند. هدف اصلي طرح جديد بررسي جزييات جديد در خصوص سياهچاله هاي بزرگ و نحوه تشكيل جت هاي عظيم ماده در اطراف سياهچاله است كه تا ميليونها سال نوري در فضا امتداد مي يابند. با كمك تكنيك جديد دانشمندان مي توانند تا فاصله يك سوم سال نوري از منبع اين جتها نفوذ كنند و به اطلاعات ارزشمندي در خصوص اندازه جت ها در محل شكل گيري خود، الگوي ميدانهاي مغناطيسي و نحوه تغييرات فعاليت اين جتها در طول زمان دست يابند.هدف ديگري كه اخترشناسان مي توانند با كمك اين تكنيك، به بررسي آن بپردازند، بررسي سياهچاله هاي مركز تپ اخترهاي دوردست است. اساس تكنيك جديد همان پديده اي است كه باعث چشمك زدن ستاره ها در جو زمين مي شود.كهكشان ما نيز داراي جوي نامريي است كه همانند لايه اي ظريف از ذرات باردار فضاي ميان ستاره اي را پر كرده است. عدم يكنواختي اين ساختار گازي عظيم موجب شده است تا در نواحي از اين محيط، مجموعه گازها به شكل عدسيهايي از جنس غبار درآيند و موجب متمركز شدن يا واگرايي امواج راديويي گردند كه از منابع بسيار دوردست به سمت ما در حركتندو به دين ترتيب باعث مي شود تا اين منابع به شكل متناوب ضعبفتر و يا قوي تر از آنچه واقعا هستند به نظر آيند.اين فرايند باعث ايجاد نوعي چشمك زدن يا برق زدن اين اجرام دور دست مي شود. همانند جو زمين كه چشمك زدن تنها براي منابع نوري نقطه اي و بسيار دور رخ مي دهد ، در مقياس بزرگ نيز اين پديده تنها براي منابع بسيار دور رخ مي هد. منابعب كه آنقدر دور باشندكه تنها به شكل منبعي نقطه اي به نظر آيند. تپ اخترها در چنين موقعيتي قرار دارند و اين پديده براي آنها رخ مي دهد. چشمك زدن تپ اخترها بسيار آهسته تر از ستاره ها رخ مي دهد. بنابر تعريف تغييراتي كه در بازه كمتر از يك روز به وقوع بپيوندد را سريع در نظر مي گيريم و البته تا كنون چشمكهايي با نرخ دو يا سه بار در ساعت نيز رصد شده است. ميزان تغييرات در شدت و ضعف سيگنالها كه در اثر اين پديده رخ مي دهد، بسيار متنوع است و وابسته به منابع راديويي، اندازه ساختار ابر غباري ، سرعت حركت زمين و جهت حركت زمين در مدار خود به دور خورشيد و همچنين سرعت و جهت حركت ابر گازي در فضا تغيير مي كند.محققان هم اكنون به الگوي تغييرات اين امواج راديويي در خلال يك سال پي برده اند و با كمك اين الگو آنها مي توانند تصويري دوبعدي از نواحي منتشر كننده امواج راديويي در يك تپ اختر تهيه كنند. پژوهشهاي اخير برروي تپ اختري به نام PKS 1257-326 متمركز شده بود و الگوي چشمك زني يكساله اي براي آن كشف شد پيش از اين نيز دو مورد الگوي تغيير ساليانه چشمك زني در مورد دو تپ اختر ديگر كشف شده بود اما مورد اخير تاخير فازي بين دو طول موج 8/4 گيگا هرتز و 4/8 گيگاهرتز را از خود به نمايش مي گذاشت. اخترشناسان معتقدند اين فركانسهاي بالا مربوط به عمق بيشتري از درون جت ها است يعني در واقع دلالت بر شواهدي در اعماق جت ها دارد جزيياتي كه از نظر بزرگي معادل 10 ميكر ثانيه قوس است بنابراين نقشه اي دوبعدي در حد دقت ميكرو ثانيه قوس از اين منابع به دست آمده است.امواج دريافتي از اين تپ اختر در يك بازه 45 دقيقه اي تغييرات شدتي معادل 40% از خود به نمايش مي گذارند و اين بدان معني است كه صفحه هاي گازي تاثير كننده بر اين تپ اختر در فاصله اي حدودا 50 سال نوري از زمين قرار دارد. اين روش در صورتي كه بتوان از ان در بررسي تعداد زيادي از تپ اخترها استفاده كرد مي تواند درچه هاي جديدي به شناخت تپ اخترها بگشايد اگرچه به نظر مي رسد كه به دليل مقدار كماين گازها در اطراف زمين عملا تعداد زيادي از اين منابع را نمي توان با اين روش مورد بررسي قرار داد .

         گذر زهره را پشت سر گزاشتیم مریخ نوردها در حال پرسه زنی در مریخ هستند و انبوهی از رباتها در اطراف مریخ آنرا نظاره می کنند کاسینی-هویگنس زحل و اقمارش را زیر نظر دارد باقی سیارات منظومه نیز بی نصیب از این هجوم نیستند عطارد نزدیکترین سیاره به خورشید به پیشواز مسنجر یا پیغام بر می رود تا پیام ما زمینیان را به عطارد نیز برساند تا عطارد هم در امان این هجوم روبوتی نباشد حال از مسنجر بیستر بدانیم ماموریت که با یک روز تاخیر دو روز قبل پرتاب شد وقرار است در سال 2011 به عطارد برسد ماموریت مسنجر زیاد طول نخواهد کشید چون در نزدیکی گرما بخش منظومه قرار دارد . ام برای این گرما تدبیری اندیشیده شده است و آن خنک کننده ای پیچیده است اما همین تکنولوزی نیز از پس گرمابخش منظومه بر نمی آید. در آیند ای نزدیک از جزئیات بیشتری از این ماموریت سخن می گوییم

        . در حالی که مریخ نورد روح در دهانه 160 کیلومتری گوسف دردامنه تپه های کلمبیا که به یادبود از دست رفتگان فاجعه کلمبیا به این نام نامیده می شود بالامیرود تا نشانه هایی از گذشته ای خیس یا پر آب در سیاره سرخ فام بیابد اما در سوی دیگر مریخ خواهر دو قلوی روح فرصت از شیب گودال پایداری به عمق 20 متر و پهنای 160 متر پایین می رود تا دیگر عاشقان ماموریت های مریخی دیگر آنرا تنبل ننامند زیر برادر او نزدیک به 2 هزار کیلومتر در مریخ قدم زده اما او فقط حدود هزارو اندی کیلومتر در مریخ پرسه زده است .دو مریخ نورد در هفتمین ماه فعالیت خود کشفیات زیادی کرده اند و اخبار خوشی را به زمین فرستاده اند کشف سنگهایی که با ساختار هماتیت (خون آب)که دلیل فعالیت آب در سیاره سرخ در گذشته ای دور است . اما خبر بدی که در سایت مریخ نوردها به چشم می خورد خرابی یکی از چرخهای مریخ نورد روح بود که دلیل آن یخ زدن روغن در یکی از چرخهای ارابه مریخ نورد است. من هم به عنوان یکی از علاقه مندان ماموریت مریخ نوردها سعی دارم که اخبار به روز تری را خدمت شما برسانم . به امید موفقیت این ماموریت و شما دوستان محمد کاظمی

           در طی چند ماه گذشته اخبارمتعدی درباره تلسکوپ هابل شنیده ایم جالب است بدانیم که ناسا با ماموریت های بین سیاره ای که به نظر سخت می آید به خوبی عمل می کند و مشکلی ندارد ام با ماموریت هایی که یک ذره با جو فاصله دارند خیلی مشکل دارد مثلا با همین نازنازی خودمون هابل تلسکوپی که علم نجوم هم به صاحب اسمش هم به خودش خیلی مدیون است تلسکوپی که بیشتر عکسهای دوستاشتنی علم نجوم مثل تصویر فرازر ف هابل رو به ما داده تصویری که هیچ تلسکوپی قادر به گرفتن اون نیست اما این عظمت علم حال کم کم به آهن قرازه ای تبدیل می شود خبر خرابی یکی از پنج ابزار هابل مرا به سختی آشفته کرده چون ناسا نیز ماموریت تعمیر هابل را لغو کرده است . دلیل ناسا برای این کار مشکل امنیت پرواز برای فضانوردان است همیشه که این جمله رو می بینم یاد حرف لیام کندی در کارگاه گذر زهره می افتم اون می گفتم که من حاضر برای هابل و خدمت هاش نیز جون رو فدا کنم پس اگر این طور است چرا ناسا به فکر امنیت افرادی است که فقط به فکر علم هست این ابزا ر به دلیل اختلالات در سیستم انرزی تلسکوپ خراب شده البته دستگاه عمر مفید خود را (STIS)هستند بگزریم نام ابزاری که از هابل خراب شده است

        می گویند زمانی که خواجه نصیرالدین طوسی به شهر مراغه رسید دراین اندیشه شد که رصد خانه بنا کند با هلاکو خان مقصود را درمیان گذاشت هلا کو خان گفت این که چه فایده است . همان نجوم به چه دردی می خورد. خواجه گفت پس تا شب صبر کن و به یکی از غلامان بگو که تشتی را در موقع مقرر از بالای بام قصر به زمین اندازد شب شد و هنگام شام غلام تشت را از بالای بام به پایین انداخت ناگهان تمام حضار سراسیمه شدند و به هرسو گریختند اما هلاکو خان و خواجه در سر جای خود نشسته بودند که خواجه به امیر گفت چون ما از بالای سر خود خبر داشتیم نهراسیدیم اما اگر خبر نمی داشتیم می ترسیدیم پس علم نجوم به درد اخبار و پدیده های آینده نیز می خورد سپس هلاکو خان دستور ساخت اولین رصد خانه ایران راد داد.
